These  pods are about twenty inches long, and from half to three-quarters of an  inch in diameter. We call them pods for want of a term which would more  accurately describe them; but they are not flat, neither have they that  sort of hinge on one side, and slight fastening on the other, which  plainly show how the shells of peas and beans are to be opened. On the  contrary, these are round; but there are two opposite lines along them,  where the colour alone would induce any one to suppose the skin to be, as  it is, thinner than elsewhere. Having the fruit before us only in a dry  state, we can describe it in no other; but at present a knife could  scarcely be made to penetrate the thicker part, and does not very easily  make its way into the thinner. The fruit, which lies in little cells  within, is a pulp, or paste, somewhat like that of tamarinds, but  smoother, and not so sweet. There are pips in it nearly as hard, and  about half as large, as those of a tamarind, containing a kernel in each.  It should be added, that in the stems of this locust tree wild bees still  deposit their honey.    W.G.C.           *       *       *       *       *        FLOWERS.    (_To the Editor of the Mirror_.)      On reading the MIRROR, No. 337, my attention was attracted to one of your  many pleasant and amusing extracts from the \"Public Journals,\" bearing  the title of \"Flowers.\" Being myself a great admirer of that beautiful  and delightful part of creation, I was led to peruse the article with  somewhat increased attention. In all ages flowers have been regarded with  peculiar sympathy; they have been associated with the calm serenity of  virtue; they have been strewed around the altars of devotion; have been  made to accompany the lonely, unobtrusive works of merit; and hung around  the grave of faded and departed innocence, thus silently, but powerfully,  depicting virtue, the essence of felicity. Although I do not consider you  to be accountable for statements contained in the articles extracted from  other journals, still I presume you would not knowingly make your work  the vehicle of any matter which would lead your readers astray. I have,  therefore, ventured to call your attention to a particular part of the  above article, and to correct what I presume to be a misstatement.    In the article alluded to, the writer states, \"It has been said that  flowers placed in bed-rooms are not wholesome; that cannot,\" he remarks,  \"be meant of such as are in a state of vegetation,\" &c.    Now plants, it is well known, respire similarly to animals, through the  pores of their leaves. By the agency of the sun, during the day, a  quantity of pure gas, called oxygen, is given out; but on the contrary,  during the night, or absence of the sun, gas of a most noxious and  pernicious nature is emitted, and at the same time a portion of the pure  air (oxygen gas) is absorbed. The greater part of the atmosphere must  therefore be impregnated with this deleterious gas. Taking into  consideration the confined state of a bed-chamber, the great increase of  perspiration of the body, with the continual increase of carbonic gas  from respiration, and this in an apartment where every thing _ought_  most sedulously to be avoided which in the least tends to deteriorate the  atmosphere, it must be evident the practice ought to be avoided, if we  are desirous of preserving health.    Flowers in a state of vegetation are, I consider, more pernicious _at  night_, or during the absence of the sun, than those plucked and put  into water, provided they be not immersed too long a time; for  immediately the stem is severed from the plant, the vital action, if it  may be so termed, ceases, and decomposition commences; but till the  decomposition has been going on some time, nothing of a pernicious nature  need be apprehended. In like manner, directly the vital principle becomes  extinct in animals, decomposition ensues. For the space of five or six  days, however, no perceptible alteration of the fibres is visible; but  after that time a compound of gases begins to exhale from the body,  accompanied with a fetid odour, till the parts are entirely decomposed.    The effluvium arising from the _farina_ and _petals_ is  considered unwholesome, however agreeable it may be to the senses,  whether the plant be in a state of vegetation or not, it being too  powerful for the olfactory nerve.    S.S.T.    Our pages are always open to the correction of our readers, and in  this instance we thank _S.S.T._ for the above, although we think he  has misconceived some portion of the article on \"Flowers,\" the writer  adding to that passage quoted by our correspondent, \"_provided fresh  air is frequently introduced_\"; of course, he does not refer to the  _night-time_, although it would have been clearer, had he suggested the  removal of flowers from bed-rooms during the night.--ED.           *       *       *       *       *      CIRCULAR TEMPLES.    (_For the Mirror_.)      These structures are generally supposed to have been built with  astronomical allusions, especially the noble temple at _Stonehenge_.  Circular temples existed among the Israelites. In Exodus, c. xxiv. v. 4,  it is written that \"Moses rose up early in the morning, and builded an  altar under the hill, and twelve pillars.\" Again in Joshua, iv. 9, Joshua  set up twelve stones; and it is well worthy of remark, that the twelve  pillars of Moses and Joshua correspond with the number of stones of the  inner circles at Abury. It is possible that these stones were plastered  over, and probably highly ornamented, as in Deuteronomy, xxvii. 2, we  read, \"Thou shalt set thee up great stones, and plaster them with  plaster;\" and there is a large, upright stone in Ireland, which,  according to the legend of the country, was once covered over with gold.  On some of these pillars it is likewise probable that certain characters  were traced, as among the Israelites words of the law were written upon  similar obelisks or columns.    The earliest temples in Greece were formed of obeliscal columns; and in  some parts of Africa the custom obtains to this day. Hence the pillars of  our present temples are the most ancient; and subsequent builders of holy  sanctuaries filled up the intercolumniations till the temples were  constructed as we now see their ruins in Athens and elsewhere. But many  of the early temples were round; and it is a curious fact, hitherto  unnoticed, I believe, that the altar end, the sanctum of our earliest  Saxon churches, is circular.    JAMES SILVESTER.           *       *       *       *       *      ST. OLAVE.--A MANX LEGEND.    (_For the Mirror_.)      [Magnus, King of Norway, having committed sacrilege, by opening the grave  of St. Olave, he was commanded by the spirit of the offended saint to  perform the voluntary penance of quitting the kingdom in thirty days. He  obeyed this intimation, and immediately left Norway. Having conquered  many of the Western Isles, at length he established himself in the Isle  of Man. Afterwards attempting the reduction of Ireland, he was surrounded  by the natives and slain, with the whole of his followers.]        Olave, of rocky Norway's saints, the holiest and the best,    Entomb'd in tumulus, enjoys a calm and peerless rest;    By all of heav'ns votaries in saintly rank renown'd,    As high in blessedness, and chief in holy missal crown'd.      The dead--in holy, stilly peace, the sacred dead repose,    Afar from earth's turmoil and grief, and all of sick'ning woes;    From racking pain, and withering pride, and avarice's care,    Secure they rest in solitude, unaw'd by sin or snare.      To sack the gloomy sepulchre of lately living clay,    From cheerful day and life remov'd, by dreaded death away,    Is crime indeed of blackest hue, deserving exile's fate,    From native climes ordain'd to feel an outlaw's dreary state.      Could Norway's priest-despising chief, deem sacrilege a crime    Fitting for absolution,--or dark penance of set time    That daring such all dreaded sin, he gazes on the grave,    And tramples o'er the hallow'd dust of canoniz'd Olave.      Lone sepulchre in holy earth--sure wickedness so dire,    Of holy man, and sacred place, incenses heaven's ire;    Can less than ever banishment from Norway's ice bound land,    Stay sure revenge--pursuing fate--and justice' awful hand?      Away he sails--the foaming seas as Corsair now he laves,    Dauntless--heroic--daring winds, and man-entombing waves,    To visit other lands afar,--to combat chiefs of fame;    In battle-field to spread around the dread of Norway's name.      Lone Mona's sea-girt isle he dares with spear and flashing sword,    Usurping regal rule and right by power of pirate horde;    Yet vengeance drear, and dark desert of direst actions, crave    A bloody death, a justice clear, and dark usurper's grave.      On Erin's lovely land he falls--awarded darksome doom,    When, ruffian-like, he dared profane the saintly Olave's tomb:    He leaves his conquests, kingdoms, crowns, and all of earthly state,    To sleep in loneliness, and fill his dark predicted fate.      _Kirk Michael, Isle of Man_.

At Luton, Beds. Sir Richard hears of an ALCHEMIST, who lives at the  village of Lilley, midway between Luton and Hitchen. The whole of his  interview with this eccentric personage, will doubtless be interesting to  our readers.    It was four miles out of my road, but I thought a modern alchemist worthy  of a visit, particularly as several"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11406"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 12, No. 340, (#2)"],[1,"to one of his  guard. He received it; and striking away a projecting stone in the wall,  out rushed the hundred sequins. The prior clasped his hands in agony,  that so much money should have been so near, and yet have escaped his  pious purposes, The soldiers took off their caps for the discoverer, and  bowed them still lower when he threw every sequin of it into the shakos  of those polite warriors. The officer, to whom he had given a double  share, showed his gratitude by a whisper, offering to assist his escape  for as much more. But the stranger declined the civility, and walked  boldly into the presence-chamber of the sublime podesta.    The Signer Dominico Castello-Grande Tremamondo was a little Venetian  noble, descended in a right line from Aeneas, with a palazzo on the  Canale Regio of Venice, which he let for a coffee-house; and living in  the pomp and pride of a _magnifico_ on something more than the wages of  an English groom. The intelligence of this extraordinary stranger's  discoveries had flown like a spark through a magazine, and the  _illustrissimo_ longed to be a partaker in the secret. He interrogated  the prisoner with official fierceness, but could obtain no other reply  than the general declaration, that he was a traveller come to see the  captivations of Italy. In the course of the inquiry the podesta dropped  a significant hint about money.    \"As to money,\" was the reply, \"I seldom carry any about me; it is so  likely to tempt _rascals_ to dip deeper in roguery. I have it whenever I  choose to call for it.\"    \"I should like to see the experiment made, merely for its curiosity,\"  said the governor.    \"You shall be obeyed,\" was the answer; \"but I never ask for more than a  sum for present expenses. Here, you fellow!\" said he, turning to one of  the half-naked soldiery, \"lend me five hundred sequins!\"    The whole guard burst into laughter. The sum would have been a severe  demand on the military chest of the army. The handsome stranger advanced  to him, and, seizing his musket, said, loftily, \"Fellow, if you won't  give the money, this must.\" He struck the butt-end of the musket thrice  upon the floor. At the third blow a burst of gold poured out, and  sequins ran in every direction. The soldiery and the officers of the  court were in utter astonishment. All wondered, many began to cross  themselves, and several of the most celebrated swearers in the regiment  dropped upon their knees. But their devotions were not long, for the  sublime podesta ordered the hall to be cleared, and himself, the  stranger, and the sequins, left alone.    For three days nothing more was heard of any of the three, and the  Vicenzese scarcely ate, drank, or slept, through anxiety to know what  was become of the man in the scarlet cloak, and cap striped green and  vermilion. Jealousy, politics, and piety, at length put their heads  together, and, by the evening of the third day, the _cavalieri_ had  agreed that he was some rambling actor, or Alpine thief, the statesmen,  that he was a spy; and the Dominicans that he was Satan in person. The  women, partly through the contradiction natural to the lovely sex, and  partly through the novelty of not having the world in their own way,  were silent; a phenomenon which the Italian philosophers still consider  the true wonder of the whole affair.    On the evening of the third day a new Venetian governor, with a stately  _cortege_, was seen entering at the Water Gate, full gallop, from  Venice: he drove straight to the podesta's house, and, after an  audience, was provided with apartments in the town-house, one of the  finest in Italy, and looking out upon the _Piazza Grande_, in which are  the two famous columns, one then surmounted by the winged lion of St.  Mark, as the other still is by a statue of the founder of our faith.    The night was furiously stormy, and the torrents of rain and perpetual  roaring of the thunder drove the people out of the streets. But between  the tempest and curiosity not an eye was closed that night in the city.  Towards morning the tempest lulled, and in the intervals of the wind,  strange sounds were heard, like the rushing of horses and rattling of  carriages. At length the sounds grew so loud that curiosity could be  restrained no longer, and the crowd gathered towards the entrance of the  _Piazza_. The night was dark beyond description, and the first knowledge  of the hazard that they were incurring was communicated to the shivering  mob by the kicks of several platoons of French soldiery, who let them  pass within their lines, but prohibited escape. The square was filled  with cavalry, escorting wagons loaded with the archives, plate, and  pictures, of the government. The old podesta was seen entering a  carriage, into which his very handsome daughter, the betrothed of the  proudest of the proud Venetian senators, was handed by the stranger. The  procession then moved, and last, and most surprising of all, the  stranger, mounting a charger, put himself at the head of the cavalry,  and, making a profound adieu to the new governor, who stood shivering at  the window in care of a file of grenadiers, dashed forward on the road  to Milan.    Day rose, and the multitude rushed out to see what was become of the  city. Every thing was as it had been, but the column of the lion: its  famous emblem of the Venetian republic was gone, wings and all. They  exclaimed that the world had come to an end. But the wheel of fortune is  round, let politicians say what they will. In twelve months from that  day the old podesta was again sitting in the government-house--yet a  podesta no more, but a French prefect; the Signora Maria, his lovely  daughter, was sitting beside him, with an infant, the image of her own  beauty, and beside her the stranger, no longer the man of magic in the  scarlet cloak and green and vermilion striped cap with a topaz clasp,  but a French general of division, in blue and silver, her husband, as  handsome as ever, and, if not altogether a professed _Diavolo_, quite as  successful in finding money whenever he wanted it. His first _entree_  into Vicenza had been a little theatrical, for such is the genius of his  country. The blowing-up of his little steam-boat, which had nearly  furnished his drama with a tragic catastrophe, added to its effect; and  his discovery of the sequins was managed by three of his countrymen. As  an inquirer into the nakedness of the land, he might have been shot as a  spy. As half-charlatan and half-madman, he was sure of national  sympathy. During the three days of his stay the old podesta had found  himself accessible to reason, the podesta's daughter to the tender  passion, and the treasures of the state to the locomotive skill of the  French detachment, that waited in the mountains the result of their  officer's diplomacy. The lion of St. Mark, having nothing else to do,  probably disdained to remain, and in the same night took wing from the  column, to which he has never returned.    As we love to \"march in good order,\" we begin with the plates, the most  striking of which is the Frontispiece, _Marcus Curtius_, by Le Keux,  from a design by Martin, which we are at a loss to describe. It requires  a microscopic eye to fully appreciate all its beauties--yet the  thousands of figures and the architectural background, are so clear and  intelligible as to make our optic nerve sympathize with the labour of  the artist. The next is a _View on the Ganges_, by Finden, after  Daniell; _Constancy_, by Portbury, after Stephanoff, in which the female  figure is loveliness personified; _Eddystone during a Storm_; the  _Proposal_, a beautiful family group; the _Cottage Kitchen_, by Romney,  after Witherington; and the _Blind Piper_, from a painting by Clennell,  who, from too great anxiety in the pursuit of his profession, was some  years since deprived of reason, which he has never recovered.    In the _poetical_ department we notice the Retreat, some beautiful lines  by J. Montgomery; Ellen Strathallan, a pathetic legend, by Mrs.  Pickersgill; St. Mary of the Lows, by the Ettrick Shepherd; Xerxes, a  beautiful composition, by C. Swain, Esq.; the Banks of the Ganges, a  descriptive poem, by Capt. McNaghten; Lydford Bridge, a fearful  incident, by the author of Dartmoor; Alice, a tale of merrie England, by  W.H. Harrison; and two pleasing pieces by the talented editor. Our  extract is      LANGSYNE.    BY DELTA.      Langsyne!--how doth the word come back    With magic meaning to the heart,  As Memory roams the sunny track,    From which Hope's dreams were loath to part!  No joy like by-past joy appears;    For what is gone we peak and pine.  Were life spun out a thousand years,    It could not match Langsyne!    Langsyne!--the days of childhood warm,    When, tottering by a mother's knee,  Each sight and sound had power to charm,    And hope was high, and thought was free.  Langsyne!--the merry schoolboy days--    How sweetly then life's sun did shine!  Oh! for the glorious pranks and plays,    The raptures of Langsyne!    Langsyne!--yes, In the sound, I hear    The rustling of the summer grove,  And view those angel features near,    Which first awoke the heart to love.  How sweet it is, in pensive mood,    At windless midnight to recline,  And fill the mental solitude    With spectres from Langsyne!    Langsyne!--ah, where are they who shared    With us its pleasures bright and blithe?  Kindly with some hath fortune fared;    And some have bowed beneath the scythe  Of death; while others, scattered far,    O'er foreign lands at fate repine,  Oft wandering forth, 'neath twilight's star,    To muse on dear Langsyne!    Langsyne!--the heart can never be    Again so full of guileless truth--  Langsyne! the eyes no more shall see,    Ah, no! the rainbow hopes of youth.  Langsyne! with thee resides a spell    To raise the spirit, and refine  Farewell!--there can be no farewell    To thee, loved, lost"]]]
