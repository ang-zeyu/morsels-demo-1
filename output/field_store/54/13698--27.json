I believe I am as ugly as  she is--in my way.  What did she say that for?\"    After she had known Miss Minchin longer she learned why she had said  it.  She discovered that she said the same thing to each papa and mamma  who brought a child to her school.    Sara stood near her father and listened while he and Miss Minchin  talked.  She had been brought to the seminary because Lady Meredith's  two little girls had been educated there, and Captain Crewe had a great  respect for Lady Meredith's experience. Sara was to be what was known  as \"a parlor boarder,\" and she was to enjoy even greater privileges  than parlor boarders usually did.  She was to have a pretty bedroom and  sitting room of her own; she was to have a pony and a carriage, and a  maid to take the place of the ayah who had been her nurse in India.    \"I am not in the least anxious about her education,\" Captain Crewe  said, with his gay laugh, as he held Sara's hand and patted it. \"The  difficulty will be to keep her from learning too fast and too much.  She is always sitting with her little nose burrowing into books.  She  doesn't read them, Miss Minchin; she gobbles them up as if she were a  little wolf instead of a little girl. She is always starving for new  books to gobble, and she wants grown-up books--great, big, fat  ones--French and German as well as English--history and biography and  poets, and all sorts of things.  Drag her away from her books when she  reads too much.  Make her ride her pony in the Row or go out and buy a  new doll.  She ought to play more with dolls.\"    \"Papa,\" said Sara, \"you see, if I went out and bought a new doll every  few days I should have more than I could be fond of.  Dolls ought to be  intimate friends.  Emily is going to be my intimate friend.\"    Captain Crewe looked at Miss Minchin and Miss Minchin looked at Captain  Crewe.    \"Who is Emily?\" she inquired.    \"Tell her, Sara,\" Captain Crewe said, smiling.    Sara's green-gray eyes looked very solemn and quite soft as she  answered.    \"She is a doll I haven't got yet,\" she said.  \"She is a doll papa is  going to buy for me.  We are going out together to find her. I have  called her Emily.  She is going to be my friend when papa is gone.  I  want her to talk to about him.\"    Miss Minchin's large, fishy smile became very flattering indeed.    \"What an original child!\" she said.  \"What a darling little creature!\"    \"Yes,\" said Captain Crewe, drawing Sara close.  \"She is a darling  little creature.  Take great care of her for me, Miss Minchin.\"    Sara stayed with her father at his hotel for several days; in fact, she  remained with him until he sailed away again to India.  They went out  and visited many big shops together, and bought a great many things.  They bought, indeed, a great many more things than Sara needed; but  Captain Crewe was a rash, innocent young man and wanted his little girl  to have everything she admired and everything he admired himself, so  between them they collected a wardrobe much too grand for a child of  seven.  There were velvet dresses trimmed with costly furs, and lace  dresses, and embroidered ones, and hats with great, soft ostrich  feathers, and ermine coats and muffs, and boxes of tiny gloves and  handkerchiefs and silk stockings in such abundant supplies that the  polite young women behind the counters whispered to each other that the  odd little girl with the big, solemn eyes must be at least some foreign  princess--perhaps the little daughter of an Indian rajah.    And at last they found Emily, but they went to a number of toy shops  and looked at a great many dolls before they discovered her.    \"I want her to look as if she wasn't a doll really,\" Sara said.  \"I  want her to look as if she LISTENS when I talk to her. The trouble with  dolls, papa\"--and she put her head on one side and reflected as she  said it--\"the trouble with dolls is that they never seem to HEAR.\" So  they looked at big ones and little ones--at dolls with black eyes and  dolls with blue--at dolls with brown curls and dolls with golden  braids, dolls dressed and dolls undressed.    \"You see,\" Sara said when they were examining one who had no clothes.  \"If, when I find her, she has no frocks, we can take her to a  dressmaker and have her things made to fit.  They will fit better if  they are tried on.\"    After a number of disappointments they decided to walk and look in at  the shop windows and let the cab follow them.  They had passed two or  three places without even going in, when, as they were approaching a  shop which was really not a very large one, Sara suddenly started and  clutched her father's arm.    \"Oh, papa!\" she cried.  \"There is Emily!\"    A flush had risen to her face and there was an expression in her  green-gray eyes as if she had just recognized someone she was intimate  with and fond of.    \"She is actually waiting there for us!\" she said.  \"Let us go in to  her.\"    \"Dear me,\" said Captain Crewe, \"I feel as if we ought to have someone  to introduce us.\"    \"You must introduce me and I will introduce you,\" said Sara.  \"But I  knew her the minute I saw her--so perhaps she knew me, too.\"    Perhaps she had known her.  She had certainly a very intelligent  expression in her eyes when Sara took her in her arms. She was a large  doll, but not too large to carry about easily; she had naturally  curling golden-brown hair, which hung like a mantle about her, and her  eyes were a deep, clear, gray-blue, with soft, thick eyelashes which  were real eyelashes and not mere painted lines.    \"Of course,\" said Sara, looking into her face as she held her on her  knee, \"of course papa, this is Emily.\"    So Emily was bought and actually taken to a children's outfitter's shop  and measured for a wardrobe as grand as Sara's own. She had lace  frocks, too, and velvet and muslin ones, and hats and coats and  beautiful lace-trimmed underclothes, and gloves and handkerchiefs and  furs.    \"I should like her always to look as if she was a child with a good  mother,\" said Sara.  \"I'm her mother, though I am going to make a  companion of her.\"    Captain Crewe would really have enjoyed the shopping tremendously, but  that a sad thought kept tugging at his heart.  This all meant that he  was going to be separated from his beloved, quaint little comrade.    He got out of his bed in the middle of that night and went and stood  looking down at Sara, who lay asleep with Emily in her arms. Her black  hair was spread out on the pillow and Emily's golden-brown hair mingled  with it, both of them had lace-ruffled nightgowns, and both had long  eyelashes which lay and curled up on their cheeks. Emily looked so like  a real child that Captain Crewe felt glad she was there.  He drew a big  sigh and pulled his mustache with a boyish expression.    \"Heigh-ho, little Sara!\" he said to himself \"I don't believe you know  how much your daddy will miss you.\"    The next day he took her to Miss Minchin's and left her there.  He was  to sail away the next morning.  He explained to Miss Minchin that his  solicitors, Messrs. Barrow & Skipworth, had charge of his affairs in  England and would give her any advice she wanted, and that they would  pay the bills she sent in for Sara's expenses. He would write to Sara  twice a week, and she was to be given every pleasure she asked for.    \"She is a sensible little thing, and she never wants anything it isn't  safe to give her,\" he said.    Then he went with Sara into her little sitting room and they bade each  other good-by. Sara sat on his knee and held the lapels of his coat in  her small hands, and looked long and hard at his face.    \"Are you learning me by heart, little Sara?\" he said, stroking her hair.    \"No,\" she answered.  \"I know you by heart.  You are inside my heart.\"  And they put their arms round each other and kissed as if they would  never let each other go.    When the cab drove away from the door, Sara was sitting on the floor of  her sitting room, with her hands under her chin and her eyes following  it until it had turned the corner of the square.  Emily was sitting by  her, and she looked after it, too.  When Miss Minchin sent her sister,  Miss Amelia, to see what the child was doing, she found she could not  open the door.    \"I have locked it,\" said a queer, polite little voice from inside. \"I  want to be quite by myself, if you please.\"    Miss Amelia was fat and dumpy, and stood very much in awe of her  sister.  She was really the better-natured person of the two, but she  never disobeyed Miss Minchin.  She went downstairs again, looking  almost alarmed.    \"I never saw such a funny, old-fashioned child, sister,\" she said. \"She  has locked herself in, and she is not making the least particle of  noise.\"    \"It is much better than if she kicked and screamed, as some of them  do,\" Miss Minchin answered.  \"I expected that a child as much spoiled  as she is would set the whole house in an uproar.  If ever a child was  given her own way in everything, she is.\"    \"I've been opening her trunks and putting her things away,\" said Miss  Amelia.  \"I never saw anything like them--sable and ermine on her  coats, and real Valenciennes lace on her underclothing.  You have seen  some of her clothes.  What DO you think of them?\"    \"I think they are perfectly ridiculous,\" replied Miss Minchin, sharply;  \"but they will look very well at the head of the line when we take the  schoolchildren to church on Sunday. She has been provided for as if she  were a little princess.\"    And upstairs in the locked room Sara and Emily sat on the floor and  stared at the corner round which the cab had disappeared, while Captain  Crewe looked backward, waving and kissing his hand as if he could not  bear to stop.        2    A French Lesson      When Sara entered the schoolroom the next morning everybody looked at  her with wide, interested"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14600"],[0,"Theory of Silk Weaving (#2)"],[1,"drawn end and end on two sections having 8 shafts each.    Figs. 13, 14 and 15, while not strictly belonging to the class of section  draws, may, however, be considered under this heading. The idea is to draw  a certain number of ends in one part of the harness and another group in  another part, be it straight, point or skip, which will cause the effect on  the cloth to be accordingly transposed or broken up.                                                                      [Page 15]         *       *       *       *       *    THE WEAVES AND THEIR CONSTRUCTION    In any woven fabric we distinguish two systems of threads, the _Warp or  Chain_, running lengthways in the cloth, and the _Filling or Weft_,  crossing the former at right angles.    This crossing or interlacing consists of every individual warp-thread being  placed alternately under and over one or more threads of the filling  system. The arrangement of this interlacing is technically called the  _Weave_, and the variety in which the points of crossing can be distributed  is practically endless.    It is principally the weave that lends to a fabric its character,  influenced, of course, by the material used, the size and tension of the  threads and the combination of the colors.    The weaves are divided into three main classes: _the Foundation weaves_. In  the silk business they are known under the following names:      #The Taffeta Weave,    The Serge Weave,    The Satin Weave.#    In the foundation weaves each thread effects only one crossing in one  repeat of the weave, and the points of interlacing occur in a given  rotation. A repeat in the foundation weaves comprises the same number of  warp-threads as of _picks_ or filling threads, and if this number is 8, for                                                                    [Page 16]  instance, the weave is called an 8-shaft or an 8-harness weave. In marking  out a weave, the warp-threads are represented by vertical lines, the  filling by horizontal ones, or in each case by the space between these  lines. The places where a warp-thread lies over the filling are marked with  paint or simply with a cross. In a similar manner we mark out the _chain  draft_, which indicates the rotation in which the shafts are raised.           *       *       *       *       *                                                                      [Page 17]  THE TAFFETA WEAVE    [Illustration: Fig. 16]           *       *       *       *    [Illustration: Fig. 17]                                                                      [Page 18]  This is the simplest and oldest method of interlacing. The odd numbers of  warp-threads cross the even numbers after every pick; hence of two  warp-threads one will always go over the first pick and under the second,  and the other end under the first and over the second pick. Taffeta cloth,  therefore, has the same appearance on both sides, and in cotton and wool  weaving this weave is technically--and properly indeed--called the _Plain  Weave_. It has the smallest repeat, 2 warp-threads and 2 picks, and the  exchanging of warp and filling is the most frequent possible. The cloth  thus produced is firmer and stronger than that obtained with any other  weave.    Fig. 16 is a taffeta on 4 shafts straight draw, the draft executed in the  manner which we have already mentioned in explaining the drawing-in drafts.    Fig. 17 on common designing paper, illustrates a taffeta made on 8-harness,  skip draw.    Be it mentioned that the drawing-in draft and the chain draft will be added  throughout this work, the former over the weave to correspond with the  respective warp-threads, the latter to the right of the drawing-in draft.           *       *       *       *       *                                                                      [Page 19]  GROS DE TOURS WEAVES    [Illustration: Fig. 18]           *       *       *       *    [Illustration: Fig. 19]    In this weave the working of the warp is the same as in taffeta, except  that instead of one pick, two or more are inserted in the same shed. It is  mostly used in selvedges, where it serves to give more firmness to the edge  of an otherwise loosely woven cloth, and prevents the weaving ahead of the  edge in a tight weave. Gros de Tours is sometimes used, especially when  cotton or wool filling is employed, with a view to lay two picks nicely  side by side, whereas a thread entered two ply with the taffeta weave will  always receive some twist, which may disturb the perfect evenness of the  fabric.    Fig. 18 is a Gros de Tours with two picks on four harness straight through.    Fig. 19 illustrates this weave with three picks drawn end and end on two  sections of four shafts each.           *       *       *       *       *                                                                      [Page 20]  SERGE or TWILL WEAVES    While the taffeta weave produces either an entirely smooth fabric, or one  with a distinct transverse rib as in gros-grain, the twill weave forms  diagonal lines on the cloth, running either from left to right or from  right to left.    To make a twill, not less than three ends and three picks are required, of  which each thread floats over two of the other system and interlaces with  the third. The rotation of the interlacing is always consecutive, that is  it moves with each succeeding pick one thread to the right (or to the left  if the lines are to run in that direction). If warp and filling have the  same texture, that is the same number of threads in a given space, the  twill lines will form an angle of 45 deg.; if the warp stands closer than the  filling, the incline will be steeper, and in the opposite case the angle  will approach more the horizontal.    The weaves can be expressed in numbers, for instance: the 3-end twill warp  effect would be marked 2-1, which indicates that each warp-thread goes over  two and under one pick.    Twill weaves are called _evensided_ when the arrangement of \"warp up\" and  \"filling up\" are evenly balanced, and _unevensided_ if either warp or  filling predominate on the face of the fabric; the latter class is  therefore subdivided in _Warp effects_ and _Filling effects_.    In the following a number of serge weaves are illustrated, the French  designations being added in some cases, as they are still extensively used  in the trade.
