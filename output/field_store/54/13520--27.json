The above was true not only in Goa and Bombay where I  worked as a general reporter for The Indian Express  (1965-66) but also in Toronto where I worked as a copy  editor on the foreign desk of The Globe and Mail in  1975-76. The foreign editor would throw at me reams of  teletype copy from Reuters, Associated Press,  Agence-France Presse, and The New York Times News Service   on a current story, such as race riots in  Johannesburg, or post-revolution democracy woes in Portugal   or the Patty Hurst kidnapping by the Symbionese  Liberation Army in San Francisco, and ask me for a  10-inch column story. This required that I cut out a  lot of 'facts' from the 2000 words of wire copy and  shape a news story in about 500 words.    Going back to Goa, I remember the one-sided coverage  that Navhind Times carried during the month-long  campaign for the historic, first general elections held  on December 9, 1963. And I was part of it.    Now Vaikuntrao Dempo, younger brother of Vassantrao,  was a Congress candidate in the Pernem constituency.  The Dempo Brothers had made a substantial cash  contribution to the national Congress Party, in effect  buying a ticket for Vaikuntrao in the Goa elections.  The local Goa Pradesh Congress Committee, headed by  Purushottam Kakodkar, a freedom fighter and an apostle  of Mahatma Gandhi, was deluged with names of suitable  candidates. It was hard pressed to make a judicious  choice, a key problem being the candidate's vision of  the future of Goa.    At this time, after the 30-member Goa Legislative  Consultative Council, headed by Maj.-Gen. Candeth, the  mustachioed military governor, was dissolved and a writ  for the first democratic elections was issued, two new  political parties came into being and declared their  election platforms. One was the United Goans, led by  Dr. Jack de Sequeira, which stood for a separate state  for Goa. The other was the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party,  with Dayanand Bandodkar at its helm, which stood for  Goa's merger with Maharashtra. The Congress, waffling  in between, promised that Goans would be consulted  about its future in the Indian union.    The elder Dempo let it be known that his paper would  support the Congress in the elections and, therefore,  all news coverage must be oriented towards Congress  candidates. And as the chief reporter at the paper, it  fell to my lot to deliver the news with this bias. On  the campaign trail, I traveled the length and breadth  of Goa, speaking to Congress candidates and often  manufacturing 'news' that purported to show that  people, by and large, were in favor of Congress  candidates. Lambert and I even drove to Pernem one day  to see how Vaikuntrao's campaign was coming along.    However, my one dependable contact was none other than  the 50-year-old Purushottam Kakodkar. His office in  Panjim was open to me at any hour of the day. Knowing  that our paper was solidly behind him, he was generous  with his time and forthcoming, giving me full access to  campaign reports sent to head office from the various  constituencies. During the campaign, Lal Bahadur Shastri,  the Indian Home Minister, visited Goa to lend his  support to the Congress candidates. Kakodkar arranged  for me an exclusive interview with the minister. In the  interview, Shastri affirmed that a separate status for  Goa was on the cards. A day after my story appeared on  the front page, Kakodkar told me that Shastri was  pleased with my report and had asked him to extend his  congratulations to me. I was more than touched by this  solicitude. I was feeling giddy, riding on the carousel  of a mutual admiration society.    My friend Ben Saldanha of PTI in Panjim filed a report  based on my interview; so did Joshi of The Times of India   bureau. As a representative of a news agency, Saldanha,  of course, had to be objective and he was. As a  matter of fact, he would often feed me stories about  the other two parties, based on the 'inside'  information he had received. He himself couldn't use  that information for his news agency, but I could. And  whenever I mentioned this 'fact' to my editors, I was  told to just let it pass.    Now, as the campaign was getting into high gear,  another friend L. S. Bhandare, an architect by  profession, who represented UNI (United News of India)  told me that the United Goans' campaign (workers  dashing about in open trucks with loud music and  handing out campaign literature) reminded him of  elections in London, England. He too drew my attention  to how successfully the UG party was appealing to the voters.     Convinced    But having persuaded myself willfully with  auto-suggestion, and having been on a one-track  crusade, I remained convinced that Congress would win  the day. On the eve of the election, a day of pause in  electioneering, I wrote an upbeat story (about three  takes) and handed it to Mr. Salkhade, the news editor  from Maharashtra. He scanned the intro and set it in  the tray of stories for the front page. Then he looked  up and said to me, \"You know, Kakodkar is going to be  the chief minister of Goa.\"    It was about 4 p.m. Something in the tone of his voice  gave me pause. Then a wild notion entered my head, a  spur-of-the-moment impulse, with no rhyme or reason, a  mad folly that sometimes seizes lovers at play. I  phoned Kakodkar.    \"Hello, Purushottam.\" Although only 28, I was now on  first-name basis with him.    \"Hello Ben.\"    \"It's a day of rest for you today. Is everything okay?\"    \"Fine.\"    \"I've just finished writing my lead story for the paper  tomorrow. Looks like Congress will win with an  overwhelming majority. You must be pleased with the  campaign. What do you think?\"    \"We have to wait and see,\" he said in a voice devoid of  any emotion, but not exhausted. In this respect,  Kakodkar came across as cool and circumspect, a man in  full control of his emotions.    Mr. Salkhade was busy editing copy at the other end of  the newsroom, beyond earshot. That wild notion came  rushing again, prompting me to make the pitch, even if  it was only hypothetical.    \"Purushottam, can I ask you something?\"    \"Sure, of course.\"    \"You know our paper has been very good to you and the  Congress. And I, more than anybody else, have been  responsible for all the publicity you've received. Soon  you'll become the chief minister of Goa. Now I want to  ask you: what will you do for me?\"    A pause and, \"What do you mean?\"    \"What I mean is, if you become the chief minister, can  I be your press secretary?\"    \"I can't answer that.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"I can't do it.\"    \"Listen, I know you're not the chief minister yet. But  in the event that you do become the chief minister,  could you not at least tell me what your disposition  will be?\"    \"No.\"    \"You know, I can't believe you're saying this. I am not  asking you for a job. I already have a job. All I am  asking is, if you become the chief minister, what will  you do for me? That's all.\"    \"I can't do anything,\" he said.    \"That's the answer I get after all that I have done for  you? I am disappointed. Goodbye and good luck tomorrow.\"    \"Thank you,\" he said and put the phone down first. I  pictured him, in his customary white khadi bush shirt  and pants, wearing a self-righteous expression on his face.    During this call, over the carriage of my Underwood  typewriter, I was watching the news editor for my voice  carried unusually far. But he was focused on his work  and didn't look up in my direction.    I lit up a cigarette and hunched over the typewriter,  dismayed beyond description. I had heard that Kakodkar  was a highly principled man, and then with a sinking  feeling in my gut, I realized I was being used, a means  to the end. I shall never forget that moment.    Then I walked to my favorite bar to nurse my bruised ego.    Three days later, the election results came out. The Congress   was wiped out without a single seat in Goa. The MG won  14 seats to the UG's 12, with two independents, plus an  independent winning in Diu and a lone Congress victory  in Daman.    I kept brooding about Kakodkar. Did he know something  that I didn't? Was that why he said he couldn't do  anything for me? I had no heart to ask him that. After  that personal and private telephone conversation, the  two of us carried on as if nothing had happened. And  during the next year, my encounters with Kakodkar  became strictly professional but cordial.     Echoes in Toronto    But the manipulation of news by newspaper proprietors  was not limited to Goa. I heard a similar echo in  Toronto in the nineties.    In the 1988 elections, the Progressive Conservative  Party of Canada, led by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney,  had won a second majority with 169 seats out of 295 in  the House of Commons. The Liberals were in opposition  with 83. In the ensuing five years, the Mulroney  government brought in a new bill called Goods and  Services Tax, a highly controversial measure that  proved unpopular with the majority of Canadians. Still,  the government went ahead and passed the tax bill -- a  7% tax on all goods and services effective January  1990. During this term, Mr. Mulroney was also  criticized for being too friendly with the Americans.    In the 1993 election, the public was fed up with the  Tories (PC) as reflected in the opinion polls. But the  press and media had no clear idea as to how deeply the  people loathed the policies of the Tories. The shocker  came on the night of the election-October 25. The fall  from grace for the Tories was as stunning as it was  deserved. They won only two seats in total, each in the  province of New Brunswick and Quebec. The Liberals, led  by Jean Chretien, returned with a huge majority of 177  seats. The Liberals are still in power, having won the  next two elections in 1997 and 2000.

The Death of Daphnis.    _THYRSIS. A GOATHERD._        THYRSIS.      Sweet are the whispers of yon pine that makes      Low music o'er the spring, and, Goatherd, sweet      Thy piping; second thou to Pan alone.      Is his the horned ram? then thine the goat.      Is his the goat? to thee shall fall the kid;      And toothsome is the flesh of unmilked kids.        GOATHERD.      Shepherd, thy lay is as the noise of streams      Falling and falling aye from yon tall crag.      If for their meed the Muses claim the ewe,      Be thine the stall-fed lamb; or if they choose      The lamb, take thou the scarce less-valued ewe.        THYRSIS.      Pray, by the Nymphs, pray, Goatherd, seat thee here      Against this hill-slope in the tamarisk shade,      And pipe me somewhat, while I guard thy goats.        GOATHERD.      I durst not, Shepherd, O I durst not pipe      At noontide; fearing Pan, who at that hour      Rests from the toils of hunting. Harsh is he;      Wrath at his nostrils aye sits sentinel.      But, Thyrsis, thou canst sing of Daphnis' woes;      High is thy name for woodland minstrelsy:      Then rest we in the shadow of the elm      Fronting Priapus and the Fountain-nymphs.      There, where the oaks are and the Shepherd's seat,      Sing as thou sang'st erewhile, when matched with him      Of Libya, Chromis; and I'll give thee, first,      To milk, ay thrice, a goat--she suckles twins,      Yet ne'ertheless can fill two milkpails full;--      Next, a deep drinking-cup, with sweet wax scoured,      Two-handled, newly-carven, smacking yet      0' the chisel. Ivy reaches up and climbs      About its lip, gilt here and there with sprays      Of woodbine, that enwreathed about it flaunts      Her saffron fruitage. Framed therein appears      A damsel ('tis a miracle of art)      In robe and snood: and suitors at her side      With locks fair-flowing, on her right and left,      Battle with words, that fail to reach her heart.      She, laughing, glances now on this, flings now      Her chance regards on that: they, all for love      Wearied and eye-swoln, find their labour lost.      Carven elsewhere an ancient fisher stands      On the rough rocks: thereto the old man with pains      Drags his great casting-net, as one that toils      Full stoutly: every fibre of his frame      Seems fishing; so about the gray-beard's neck      (In might a youngster yet) the sinews swell.      Hard by that wave-beat sire a vineyard bends      Beneath its graceful load of burnished grapes;      A boy sits on the rude fence watching them.      Near him two foxes: down the rows of grapes      One ranging steals the ripest; one assails      With wiles the poor lad's scrip, to leave him soon      Stranded and supperless. He plaits meanwhile      With ears of corn a right fine cricket-trap,      And fits it on a rush: for vines, for scrip,      Little he cares, enamoured of his toy.        The cup is hung all round with lissom briar,      Triumph of AEolian art, a wondrous sight.      It was a ferryman's of Calydon:      A goat it cost me, and a great white cheese.      Ne'er yet my lips came near it, virgin still      It stands. And welcome to such boon art thou,      If for my sake thou'lt sing that lay of lays.      I jest not: up, lad, sing: no songs thou'lt own      In the dim land where all things are forgot.        THYSIS [_sings_].        _Begin, sweet Maids, begin the woodland song_.      The voice of Thyrsis. AEtna's Thyrsis I.      Where were ye, Nymphs, oh where, while Daphnis pined?      In fair Peneus' or in Pindus' glens?      For great Anapus' stream was not your haunt,      Nor AEtna's cliff, nor Acis' sacred rill.        _Begin, sweet Maids, begin the woodland song_.      O'er him the wolves, the jackals howled o'er him;      The lion in the oak-copse mourned his death.        _Begin, sweet Maids, begin the woodland song_.      The kine and oxen stood around his feet,      The heifers and the calves wailed all for him.        _Begin, sweet Maids, begin the woodland song_.      First from the mountain Hermes came, and said,      \"Daphnis, who frets thee? Lad, whom lov'st thou so?\"        _Begin, sweet Maids, begin the woodland song_.      Came herdsmen, shepherds came, and goatherds came;      All asked what ailed the lad. Priapus came      And said, \"Why pine, poor Daphnis? while the maid      Foots it round every pool and every grove,      (_Begin, sweet Maids, begin the woodland song_)      \"O lack-love and perverse, in quest of thee;      Herdsman in name, but goatherd rightlier called.      With eyes that yearn the goatherd marks his kids      Run riot, for he fain would frisk as they:        (_Begin, sweet Maids, begin the woodland song_):      \"With eyes that yearn dost thou too mark the laugh      Of maidens, for thou may'st not share their glee.\"      Still naught the herdsman said: he drained alone      His bitter portion, till the fatal end.        _Begin, sweet Maids, begin the woodland song_.      Came Aphrodite, smiles on her sweet face,      False smiles, for heavy was her heart, and spake:      \"So, Daphnis, thou must try a fall with Love!      But stalwart Love hath won the fall of thee.\"        _Begin, sweet Maids, begin the woodland song_.      Then \"Ruthless Aphrodite,\" Daphnis said,      \"Accursed Aphrodite, foe to man!      Say'st thou mine hour is come, my sun hath set?      Dead as alive, shall Daphnis work Love woe.\"        _Begin, sweet Maids, begin the woodland song_.      \"Fly to Mount Ida, where the swain (men say)      And Aphrodite--to Anchises fly:      There are oak-forests; here but galingale,      And bees that make a music round the hives.        _Begin, sweet Maids, begin the woodland song_.      \"Adonis owed his bloom to tending flocks      And smiting hares, and bringing wild beasts down.        _Begin, sweet Maids, begin the woodland song_.      \"Face once more Diomed: tell him 'I have slain      The herdsman Daphnis; now I challenge thee.'        _Begin, sweet Maids, begin the woodland song_.      \"Farewell, wolf, jackal, mountain-prisoned bear!      Ye'll see no more by grove or glade or glen      Your herdsman Daphnis! Arethuse, farewell,      And the bright streams that pour down Thymbris' side.        _Begin, sweet Maids, begin the woodland song_.      \"I am that Daphnis, who lead here my kine,      Bring here to drink my oxen and my calves.        _Begin, sweet Maids, begin the woodland song_.      \"Pan, Pan, oh whether great Lyceum's crags      Thou haunt'st to-day, or mightier Maenalus,      Come to the Sicel isle! Abandon now      Rhium and Helice, and the mountain-cairn      (That e'en gods cherish) of Lycaon's son!        _Forget, sweet Maids, forget your woodland song_.      \"Come, king of song, o'er this my pipe, compact      With wax and honey-breathing, arch thy lip:      For surely I am torn from life by Love.        _Forget, sweet Maids, forget your woodland song_.      \"From thicket now and thorn let violets spring,      Now let white lilies drape the juniper,      And pines grow figs, and nature all go wrong:      For Daphnis dies. Let deer pursue the hounds,      And mountain-owls outsing the nightingale.        _Forget, sweet Maids, forget your woodland song_.\"        So spake he, and he never spake again.      Fain Aphrodite would have raised his head;      But all his thread was spun. So down the stream      Went Daphnis: closed the waters o'er a head      Dear to the Nine, of nymphs not unbeloved.        Now give me goat and cup; that I may milk      The one, and pour the other to the Muse.      Fare ye well, Muses, o'er and o'er farewell!      I'll sing strains lovelier yet in days to be.        GOATHERD.      Thyrsis, let honey and the honeycomb      Fill thy sweet mouth, and figs of AEgilus:      For ne'er cicala trilled so sweet a song.      Here is the cup: mark, friend, how sweet it smells:      The Hours, thou'lt say, have washed it in their well.      Hither, Cissaetha! Thou, go milk her! Kids,      Be steady, or your pranks will rouse the ram.          IDYLL II.      The Sorceress.        Where are the bay-leaves, Thestylis, and the charms?      Fetch all; with fiery wool the caldron crown;      Let glamour win me back my false lord's heart!      Twelve days the wretch hath not come nigh to me,      Nor made enquiry if I die or live,      Nor clamoured (oh unkindness!) at my door.      Sure his swift fancy wanders otherwhere,      The slave of Aphrodite and of Love.      I'll off to Timagetus' wrestling-school      At dawn, that I may see him and denounce      His doings; but I'll charm him now with charms.      So shine out fair, O moon! To thee I sing      My soft low song: to thee and Hecate      The dweller in the shades, at whose approach      E'en the dogs quake, as on she moves through blood      And darkness and the barrows of the slain."]]]
