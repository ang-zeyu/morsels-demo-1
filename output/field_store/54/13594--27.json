To have laid down no more than the lands and dangers seen in the  Investigator and other vessels under my command, would have left several  open spaces, and obliged the seaman to have recourse to other charts  where the difference of positions might have perplexed; the discoveries  and examinations of former navigators which come within the sphere of  each sheet, are therefore incorporated with, or added to mine, but so  marked as to be distinctly known. In making the combination, alterations  in their longitudes were frequently necessary to agreement; and that they  might be made with every regard to accuracy, the charts of the former  discoveries were compared with the astronomical observations, narratives,  or manuscript journals, when such could be had, and the alterations  introduced where there seemed to be the best authority. This has been  done with the charts of the east coast of New South Wales, published by  Mr. Dalrymple from the manuscripts, as it should appear, of captain Cook;  and since it may be thought presumptuous in me to have made alterations  in any work of so great a master, this case is selected for a more  particular explanation.    Time keepers were in their infancy in 1768, when captain Cook sailed upon  his first voyage, and he was not then furnished with them; his longitude  was therefore regulated only by occasional observations of lunar  distances and some few of Jupiter's satellites, which even in the present  improved state of instruments and tables, require to be connected by time  keepers before satisfactory conclusions can be drawn. Errors of greater  or less magnitude were thence unavoidable; at Cape Gloucester, where I  quitted the East Coast, my longitude was 201/2' greater than captain Cook's  chart--at Cape York where the survey was again resumed, it was 581/2; and  to incorporate the intermediate parts, it was necessary not only to carry  his scale of longitude 201/2' more west, but also to reduce the extent of  the coast. The chart was compared with the narrative and chart in  Hawkesworth, and the log book of the Endeavour with them all; when it was  found that reductions might be made in various places upon one or more of  the above authorities, for differences between them were frequent and  sometimes considerable, and in one instance alone a reduction of 12' in  the chart was obtained. It is said in Hawkesworth (III, 202), \"As soon as  we got within side the reef (through Providential Channel) we anchored in  nineteen fathom;\" and afterwards (p. 204), that the channel, \"bore E. N.  E. distant ten or twelve miles.\" In the first chart the distance is 141/2  miles, and nearly the same in that which accompanies the narrative; but  in the log book it is said to be 21/2 miles only, which corresponds with  having anchored as soon as they got within the reef, and has been  adopted. In some cases it was not easy to make a choice between these  different authorities; but I have commonly followed the narrative and log  book when they were found to specify with precision, and they generally  produced such corrections to the chart as brought the longitudes of  places nearer to my positions. Captain Cook's track in Plates XI. XII.  and XIII. is laid down afresh from the log book; and many soundings, with  some other useful particulars not to be found in the original chart, are  introduced, for the benefit of any navigator who may follow the same  route.    The reconstruction of the charts in the Atlas was done upon various  scales, but that no error might escape unseen, the least was of _ten_  inches to a degree of longitude; they were then reduced by Mr. Thomas  Arrowsmith to four inches, this being thought sufficiently large for a  general sailing scale; and each reduced sheet was scrupulously compared  by me with the original before it went into the engravers hands, and the  proof impressions with the drawing until no errors were found. To those  who may read this voyage with a view to geographical information, a  frequent reference to the Atlas is earnestly recommended; for many  particulars are there marked which it would have been tedious to  describe, and should any thing appear obscure in the narrative the charts  will generally afford an elucidation.    From the general tenour of the explanations here given, it will perhaps  be inferred that the perfection of the Atlas has been the principal  object of concern; in fact, having no pretension to authorship, the  writing of the narrative, though by much the most troublesome part of my  labour, was not that upon which any hope of reputation was founded; a  polished style was therefore not attempted, but some pains have been  taken to render it clearly intelligible. The first quire of my manuscript  was submitted to the judgment of a few literary friends, and I hope to  have profited by the corrections they had the kindness to make; but  finding these to bear more upon redundancies than inaccuracy of  expression, I determined to confide in the indulgence of the public,  endeavour to improve as the work advanced, and give my friends no further  trouble. Matter, rather than manner, was the object of my anxiety; and if  the reader shall be satisfied with the selection and arrangement, and not  think the information destitute of such interest as might be expected  from the subject, the utmost of my hopes will be accomplished.    * * *    N.B. Throughout this narrative _the variation has been allowed upon the  bearings, and also in the direction of winds, tides, etc._; the whole are  therefore to be considered with reference to the true poles of the earth,  unless it be otherwise particularly expressed; and perhaps in some few  cases of the ship's head when variations are taken, where the expression  _by compass_, or _magnetic_, may have been omitted.

But still I also  have in many places formed theories of my own, whether they are right  or wrong it will be for scholars to judge. I had no space for entering  into any polemic, but it will be found that my interpretations of the  systems are different in some cases from those offered by some European  scholars who have worked on them and I leave it to those who are  acquainted with the literature of the subject to decide which of us may  be in the right. I have not dealt elaborately with the new school of  Logic (Navya-Nyaya) of Bengal, for the simple reason that most of the  contributions of this school consist in the invention of technical  expressions and the emphasis put on the necessity of strict exactitude  and absolute preciseness of logical definitions and discussions and these  are almost untranslatable in intelligible English. I have however  incorporated what important differences of philosophical points of view  I could find in it. Discussions of a purely technical character could not  be very fruitful in a work like this. The bibliography given of the  different Indian systems in the last six chapters is not exhaustive but  consists mostly of books which have been actually studied or consulted in  the writing of those chapters. Exact references to the pages of the    xi    texts have generally been given in footnotes in those cases where a  difference of interpretation was anticipated or where it was felt that  a reference to the text would make the matter clearer, or where the  opinions of modern writers have been incorporated.    It gives me the greatest pleasure to acknowledge my deepest gratefulness  to the Hon'ble Maharaja Sir Manindrachandra Nundy, K.C.I.E. Kashimbazar,  Bengal, who has kindly promised to bear the entire expense of the  publication of both volumes of the present work.    The name of this noble man is almost a household word in Bengal for  the magnanimous gifts that he has made to educational and other causes.  Up till now he has made a total gift of about L300,000, of which those  devoted to education come to about L200,000. But the man himself is far  above the gifts he has made. His sterling character, universal sympathy  and friendship, his kindness and amiability make him a veritable  Bodhisattva--one of the noblest of men that I have ever seen. Like many  other scholars of Bengal, I am deeply indebted to him for the  encouragement that he has given me in the pursuit of my studies and  researches, and my feelings of attachment and gratefulness for him are  too deep for utterance.    I am much indebted to my esteemed friends Dr E.J. Thomas of the Cambridge  University Library and Mr Douglas Ainslie for their kindly revising the  proofs of this work, in the course of which they improved my English in  many places. To the former I am also indebted for his attention to the  transliteration of a large number of Sanskrit words, and also for the  whole-hearted sympathy and great friendliness with which he assisted me  with his advice on many points of detail, in particular the exposition  of the Buddhist doctrine of the cause of rebirth owes something of its  treatment to repeated discussions with him.    I also wish to express my gratefulness to my friend Mr N.K. Siddhanta,  M.A., late of the Scottish Churches College, and Mademoiselle Paule Povie  for the kind assistance they have rendered in preparing the index. My  obligations are also due to the Syndics of the Cambridge University Press  for the honour they have done me in publishing this work.    To scholars of Indian philosophy who may do me the honour of reading my  book and who may be impressed with its inevitable    xii    shortcomings and defects, I can only pray in the words of Hemacandra:      Prama@nasiddhantaviruddham atra    Yatkinciduktam matimandyado@sat    Matsaryyam utsaryya tadaryyacitta@h    Prasadam adhaya vis'odhayantu.
