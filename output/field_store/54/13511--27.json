The importance of the last two points is  demonstrated by the facts that, when oxygen is cut off, alcoholic  fermentation--giving rise to the well-known odor of apples--sets in in  the cells, and that in an atmosphere with 20 per cent. of carbonic acid,  germination ceases. The open pneumatic system, which consists in drawing  warm air through the heaps spread on a perforated floor, should yield  better results. All the processes are thoroughly controlled by the eye  and by the thermometer, great cleanliness is possible, and the space  requisite is only one-third of that required on the old plan. Since May,  1882, this method has been successfully worked at Puntigam, where plant  has been established sufficient for an annual output of 7,000 qrs. of  malt. The closed pneumatic system labors under the disadvantages that  from the form of the apparatus germination cannot be thoroughly  controlled, and cleanliness is very difficult to maintain, while the  supply of oxygen is, as a rule, more irregular than with the open  floors.    [Illustration: IMPROVED PNEUMATIC FILTERING PRESSES.]           *       *       *       *       *          A NEW FORM OF GAS WASHER.    By A. BANDSEPT, of Brussels.      The washer is an appliance intended to condense and clean gas, which, on  leaving the hydraulic main, holds in suspension a great many properties  that are injurious to its illuminating power, and cannot, if retained,  be turned to profitable account. This cleaning process is not difficult  to carry out effectually; and most of the appliances invented for the  purpose would be highly efficacious if they did not in other respects  present certain very serious inconveniences. The passage of the gas  through a column of cold water is, of course, sufficient to condense it,  and clear it of these injurious properties; but this operation has for  its immediate effect the presentation of an obstacle to the flow of the  gas, and consequently augmentation of pressure in the retorts. In order  to obviate this inconvenience (which exists notwithstanding the use of  the best washers), exhausters are employed to draw the gas from the  retorts and force it into the washers. There is, however, another  inconvenience which can only be remedied by the use of a second  exhauster, viz., the loss of pressure after the passage of the gas  through the washer--a loss resulting from the obstacle presented by this  appliance to the steady flow of the gas. Now as, in the course of its  passage through the remaining apparatus, on its way to the holder, the  gas will have to suffer a considerable loss of pressure, it is of the  greatest importance that the washer should deprive it of as little as  possible. It will be obvious, therefore, that a washer which fulfills  the best conditions as far as regards the cleaning of the gas will be  absolutely perfect if it does not present any impediment to its flow.  Such an appliance is that which is shown in the illustration on next  page. Its object is, while allowing for the washing being as vigorous  and as long-continued as may be desired, to draw the gas out of the  retorts, and, having cleansed it perfectly from its deleterious  properties, to force it onward. The apparatus consequently supplies the  place of the exhauster and the scrubber.    The new washer consists of a rectangular box of cast iron, having a  half-cylindrical cover, in the upper part of which is fixed a pipe to  carry off the gas. In the box there is placed horizontally a turbine,  the hollow axis of which serves for the conveyance of the gas into the  vessel. For this purpose the axis is perforated with a number of small  holes, some of which are tapped, so as to allow of there being screwed  on to the axis, and perpendicularly thereto, a series of brooms made of  dog grass, and having their handles threaded for the purpose. These  brooms are arranged in such a way as not to encounter too great  resistance from contact with the water contained in the vessel, and so  that the water cast up by them shall not be all thrown in the same  direction. To obviate these inconveniences they are fixed obliquely to  the axis of the central pipe, and are differently arranged in regard to  each other. A more symmetrical disposition of them could, however, be  adopted by placing them zigzag, or in such a way as to form two helices,  one of which would move in a particular direction, and the other in a  different way. The central pipe, furnished with its brooms, being set in  motion by means of a pulley fixed upon its axis (which also carries a  flywheel), the gas, drawn in at the center, and escaping by the holes  made in the pipe, is forced to the circumference of the vessel, where it  passes out.    The effect of this washer is first, to break up the current of gas, and  then force it violently into the water; at the same time sending into it  the spray of water thrown up by the brooms. This double operation is  constantly going on, so that the gas, having been saturated by the  transfusion into it of a vigorous shower of water (into the bulk of  which it is subsequently immersed), is forced, on leaving the water, to  again undergo similar treatment. The same quantity of gas is therefore  several times submitted to the washing process, till at length it finds  its way to the outlet, and makes its escape. The extent to which the  washing of the gas is carried is, consequently, only limited by the  speed of the apparatus, or rather by the ratio of the speed to the  initial pressure of the gas. This limit being determined, the operation  may be continued indefinitely, by making the gas pass into several  washers in succession. There is, therefore, no reason why the gas should  not, after undergoing this treatment, be absolutely freed of all those  properties which are susceptible of removal by water. In fact, all that  is requisite is to increase the dimensions of the vessel, so as to  compel the gas to remain longer therein, and thus cause it to undergo  more frequently the operation of washing. These dimensions being fixed  within reasonable limits, if the gas is not sufficiently washed, the  speed of the apparatus may be increased; and the degree of washing will  be thereby augmented. If this does not suffice, the number of turbines  may be increased, and the gas passed from one to the other until the gas  is perfectly clean. This series of operations would, however, with any  kind of washer, result in thoroughly cleansing the gas. The only thing  that makes such a process practically impossible is the very  considerable or it may be even total loss of pressure which it entails.  By the new system, the loss of pressure is _nil_, inasmuch as each  turbine becomes in reality an exhauster. The gas, entering the washer at  the axis, is drawn to the circumference by the rotatory motion of the  brooms, which thus form a ventilator. It follows, therefore, that on  leaving the vessel the gas will have a greater pressure than it had on  entering it; and this increase of pressure may be augmented to any  desired extent by altering the speed of rotation of the axis, precisely  as in the case of an exhauster.    Forcing the gas violently into water, and at the same time dividing the  current, is evidently the most simple, rational, and efficient method of  washing, especially when this operation is effected by brooms fixed on a  shaft and rotated with great speed. Therefore, if there had not been  this loss of pressure to deal with--a fatal consequence of every violent  operation--the question of perfect washing would probably have been  solved long ago. The invention which I have now submitted consists of an  arrangement which enables all loss of pressure to be avoided, inasmuch  as it furnishes the apparatus with the greatest number of valuable  qualities, whether regarded from the point of view of washing or that of  condensation.    [Illustration: Longitudinal Section. Elevation. Transverse Section.]    Referring to the illustration, the gas enters the washer by the pipe, A,  which terminates in the form of a [Symbol: inverted T]. One end (a) of  this pipe is bolted to the center of one of the sides of the cylindrical  portion of the case, in which there is a hole of similar diameter to the  pipe; the other (a') being formed by the face-plate of a stuffing-box,  B, through which passes the central shaft, C, supported by the  plummer-block, D, as shown. This shaft has upon its opposite end a plate  perforated with holes, E, which is fixed upon the flange of a horizontal  pipe, F. This pipe is closed at the other end by means of a plate, E',  furnished with a spindle, supported by a stuffing-box, B', and carrying  a fly-wheel, G. The central pipe, F, is perforated with a number of  small holes. The gas entering by the pipe, A, makes its way into the  central pipe through the openings in the plate, E, and passes into the  cylindrical case through the small holes in the central pipe, which  carries the brooms, H. These are caused to rotate rapidly by means of  the pulley, I; and thus a constant shower of water is projected into the  cylindrical case. When the gas has been several times subjected to the  washing process, it passes off by the pipe, K. Fresh cold water is  supplied to the vessel by the pipe, L; and M is the outlet for the  tar.--_Journal of Gas Lighting_.           *       *       *       *       *          THE WIND MILL.

It is  not possible that these sentiments should have been allied to any  feelings of apprehension. Fear is acknowledged to be a most mighty  master over the visions of the imagination. It can \"call spirits from  the vasty deep\"--and they do come, when it does call for them. It  trembles at the anticipation of approaching evil, and then encounters in  every passing shadow the substance of the dream it trembled at. But such  could not have been the origin of the form which addressed itself to the  view of Lord Londonderry. Fear is a quality that was never known to  mingle in the character of a Stewart. Lord Londonderry examined his  chamber--he made himself acquainted with the forms and faces of the  ancient possessors of the mansion, who sat up right in their ebony  frames to receive his salutation; and then, after dismissing his valet,  he retired to bed. His candles had not been long extinguished, when he  perceived a light gleaming on the draperies of the lofty canopy over his  head. Conscious that there was no fire in the grate--that the curtains  were closed--that the chamber had been in perfect darkness but a few  moments before, he supposed that some intruder must have accidentally  entered his apartment; and, turning hastily round to the side from which  the light proceeded--saw--to his infinite astonishment--not the form of  any human visiter--but the figure of a fair boy, who seemed to be  garmented in rays of mild and tempered glory, which beamed palely from  his slender form, like the faint light of the declining moon, and  rendered the objects which were nearest to him dimly and indistinctly  visible. The spirit stood at some short distance from the side of the  bed. Certain that his own faculties were not deceiving him, but  suspecting that he might be imposed upon by the ingenuity of some of the  numerous guests who were then visiting in the same house, Lord  Londonderry proceeded towards the figure. It retreated before him. As he  slowly advanced, the form, with equal paces, slowly retired. It entered  the vast arch of the capacious chimney, and then sunk into the earth.  Lord L. returned to his bed; but not to rest. His mind was harassed by  the consideration of the extraordinary event which had occurred to him.  Was it real?--was it the work of imagination?--was it the result of  imposture?--It was all incomprehensible. He resolved in the morning not  to mention the appearance till he should have well observed the manners  and the countenances of the family: he was conscious that, if any  deception had been practised, its authors would be too delighted with  their success to conceal the vanity of their triumph. When the guests  assembled at the breakfast-table, the eye of Lord Londonderry searched  in vain for those latent smiles--those cunning looks--that silent  communication between the parties--by which the authors and abettors of  such domestic conspiracies are generally betrayed. Every thing  apparently proceeded in its ordinary course. The conversation flowed  rapidly along from the subjects afforded at the moment, without any of  the constraint which marks a party intent upon some secret and more  interesting argument, and endeavouring to afford an opportunity for its  introduction. At last the hero of the tale found himself compelled to  mention the occurrences of the night. It was most extraordinary--he  feared that he should not be credited: and then, after all due  preparation, the story was related. Those among his auditors who, like  himself, were strangers and visiters in the house, were certain that  some delusion must have been practised. The family alone seemed  perfectly composed and calm. At last, the gentleman whom Lord  Londonderry was visiting, interrupted their various surmises on the  subject by saying:--\"The circumstance which you have just recounted must  naturally appear most extraordinary to those who have not long been  inmates of my dwelling, and are not conversant with the legends  connected with my family; to those who are, the event which has happened  will only serve as the corroboration of an old tradition that long has  been related of the apartment in which you slept. You have seen _the  Radiant Boy_; and it is an omen of prosperous fortunes;--I would rather  that this subject should no more be mentioned.\"    The above adventure is one very commonly reported of the late Marquis of  Londonderry; and is given on the authority of a gentleman, to whom that  nobleman himself related it.--_The Album_.           *       *       *       *       *      THE CROSS ROADS.    (_For the Mirror_.)        Methought upon a mountain's brow      Stood Glory, gazing round him;    And in the silent vale below      Lay Love, where Fancy found him;    While distant o'er the yellow plain    Glittering Wealth held wide domain.      Glory was robed in light; and trod      A brilliant track before him,    He gazed with ardour, like a god,      And grasp'd at heaven o'er him;    The meteor's flash his beaming eye,    The trumpet's shriek his melody.      But Love was robed in roses sweet,      And zephyrs murmur'd nigh him,    Flowers were blooming at his feet,      And birds were warbling by him:    His eyes soft radiance seem'd to wear,    For tears and smiles were blended there.      Gay Wealth a gorgeous train display'd.      (And Fancy soon espied him,)    Supine, in splendid garb array'd,      With Luxury beside him;    He dwelt beneath a lofty dome,    Which Pride and Pleasure made their home.      Well; seeking Happiness, I sped,      And, as Hope hover'd o'er me,    I ask'd which way the nymph had fled,      For _four roads_ met before me--    Whether she'd climb'd the height above,    Or bask'd with Wealth, or slept with Love?      I paus'd--for in the lonely path,      'Neath gloomy willows weeping,    Wrapt in his shroud of sullen wrath,      The _Suicide_ was sleeping,    A scathed yew-tree's wither'd limb,    To mark the spot, frown'd o'er him.      I wept--to think my fellow-man,      (To madness often driven,)    Pursue false Glory's phantoms, then      Lose happiness and heaven:    I wept--for oh! it seem'd to be    A mournful moral meant for me!      But lo! an aged traveller came,      By Wisdom sent to guide me,    Experience was the pilgrim's name,      And thus he seem'd to chide me--    \"Fool!

Four kinds of ordeals were chiefly used by our German ancestors:--1.  \"The Kamp fight,\" or combat; during which the spectators were to be  silent and quiet, on pain of losing an arm or leg; an executioner with a  sharp axe. 2. \"The fire ordeal,\" in which the accused might clear his  innocence by holding _red-hot_ iron in his hands, or by walking  blind-fold amidst fiery ploughshares. 3. \"The hot-water ordeal,\" much of  the nature as the last. 4. \"The cold-water ordeal:\" this need not be  explained, since it is looked on as supreme when a witch is in question.  The cross ordeal was reserved for the clergy. These, if accused, might  prove their innocence by swallowing two consecrated morsels taken from  the altar after proper prayers. If these fragments stuck in the priest's  throat he stood _ipse facto_--condemned; but we have no record of  condemnation.           *       *       *       *       *      GEMS.      Forgive not the man who gives you _bad_ wine more than once. It is more  than an injury. Cut the acquaintance as you value your life.    If you see half-a-dozen faults in a woman, you may rest assured she has  a hundred virtues to counterbalance them. I love your faulty, and fear  your _faultless women_. When you see what is termed a faultless woman,  dread her as you would a beautiful snake. The power of completely  concealing the defects that she must have, is of itself a serious vice.    If you find no more books in a man's room, save some four or five,  including the red-book and the general almanac, you may set down the  individual as a man of genius, or an ass;--there is no medium.    The eye is never to be mistaken. A person may discipline the muscles of  the face and voice, but there is a something in the eye beyond the will,  and we thus frequently find it giving the tongue the lie direct.    I never knew a truly estimable man offer a finger, it is ever a sign of  a cold heart; and he who is heartless is positively worthless, though he  may be negatively harmless.    Cut the acquaintance of any lady who signs a letter with \"_yours  obediently_.\"    Always act in the presence of children with the utmost circumspection.  They mark all you do, and most of them are more wise than you may  imagine.    Men of genius make the most ductile husbands. A fool has too much  opinion of his own dear self, and too little of women's to be easily  governed.    A passion for sweetmeats, and a weak intellect, generally go together.    I have known many fools to be gluttons, but never knew one that was an  epicure.    The affection of women is the most wonderful thing in the world; it  tires not--faints not--dreads not--cools not. It is like the Naptha that  nothing can extinguish but the trampling foot of death.    There is a language in flowers, which is very eloquent--a philosophy  that is instructive. Nature appears to have made them as emblems of  women. The timid snow-drop, the modest violet, the languid primrose, the  coy lily, the flaunting tulip, the smart marigold, the lowly blushing  daisy, the proud foxglove, the deadly nightshade, the sleepy poppy, and  the sweet solitary eglantine, are all types.
