Humanity abhors the assailant of womanhood, and this charge upon the Negro  at once placed him beyond the pale of human sympathy. With such unanimity,  earnestness and apparent candor was this charge made and reiterated that  the world has accepted the story that the Negro is a monster which the  Southern white man has painted him. And today, the Christian world feels,  that while lynching is a crime, and lawlessness and anarchy the certain  precursors of a nation's fall, it can not by word or deed, extend sympathy  or help to a race of outlaws, who might mistake their plea for justice and  deem it an excuse for their continued wrongs.    The Negro has suffered much and is willing to suffer more. He recognizes  that the wrongs of two centuries can not be righted in a day, and he tries  to bear his burden with patience for today and be hopeful for tomorrow.  But there comes a time when the veriest worm will turn, and the Negro  feels today that after all the work he has done, all the sacrifices he has  made, and all the suffering he has endured, if he did not, now, defend his  name and manhood from this vile accusation, he would be unworthy even of  the contempt of mankind. It is to this charge he now feels he must make  answer.    If the Southern people in defense of their lawlessness, would tell the  truth and admit that colored men and women are lynched for almost any  offense, from murder to a misdemeanor, there would not now be the  necessity for this defense. But when they intentionally, maliciously and  constantly belie the record and bolster up these falsehoods by the words  of legislators, preachers, governors and bishops, then the Negro must give  to the world his side of the awful story.    A word as to the charge itself. In considering the third reason assigned  by the Southern white people for the butchery of blacks, the question must  be asked, what the white man means when he charges the black man with  rape. Does he mean the crime which the statutes of the civilized states  describe as such? Not by any means. With the Southern white man, any  mesalliance existing between a white woman and a colored man is a  sufficient foundation for the charge of rape. The Southern white man says  that it is impossible for a voluntary alliance to exist between a white  woman and a colored man, and therefore, the fact of an alliance is a proof  of force. In numerous instances where colored men have have been lynched  on the charge of rape, it was positively known at the time of lynching,  and indisputably proven after the victim's death, that the relationship  sustained between the man and woman was voluntary and clandestine, and  that in no court of law could even the charge of assault have been  successfully maintained.    It was for the assertion of this fact, in the defense of her own race,  that the writer hereof became an exile; her property destroyed and her  return to her home forbidden under penalty of death, for writing the  following editorial which was printed in her paper, the _Free Speech,_ in  Memphis, Tenn., May 21,1892:      Eight Negroes lynched since last issue of the _Free Speech_ one at    Little Rock, Ark., last Saturday morning where the citizens broke(?)    into the penitentiary and got their man; three near Anniston, Ala., one    near New Orleans; and three at Clarksville, Ga., the last three for    killing a white man, and five on the same old racket--the new alarm    about raping white women. The same programme of hanging, then shooting    bullets into the lifeless bodies was carried out to the letter. Nobody    in this section of the country believes the old threadbare lie that    Negro men rape white women. If Southern white men are not careful, they    will overreach themselves and public sentiment will have a reaction; a    conclusion will then be reached which will be very damaging to the moral    reputation of their women.    But threats cannot suppress the truth, and while the Negro suffers the  soul deformity, resultant from two and a half centuries of slavery, he is  no more guilty of this vilest of all vile charges than the white man who  would blacken his name.    During all the years of slavery, no such charge was ever made, not even  during the dark days of the rebellion, when the white man, following the  fortunes of war went to do battle for the maintenance of slavery. While  the master was away fighting to forge the fetters upon the slave, he left  his wife and children with no protectors save the Negroes themselves. And  yet during those years of trust and peril, no Negro proved recreant to his  trust and no white man returned to a home that had been dispoiled.    Likewise during the period of alleged \"insurrection,\" and alarming \"race  riots,\" it never occurred to the white man, that his wife and children  were in danger of assault. Nor in the Reconstruction era, when the hue and  cry was against \"Negro Domination,\" was there ever a thought that the  domination would ever contaminate a fireside or strike to death the virtue  of womanhood. It must appear strange indeed, to every thoughtful and  candid man, that more than a quarter of a century elapsed before the Negro  began to show signs of such infamous degeneration.    In his remarkable apology for lynching, Bishop Haygood, of Georgia, says:  \"No race, not the most savage, tolerates the rape of woman, but it may be  said without reflection upon any other people that the Southern people are  now and always have been most sensitive concerning the honor of their  women--their mothers, wives, sisters and daughters.\" It is not the purpose  of this defense to say one word against the white women of the South. Such  need not be said, but it is their misfortune that the chivalrous white men  of that section, in order to escape the deserved execration of the  civilized world, should shield themselves by their cowardly and infamously  false excuse, and call into question that very honor about which their  distinguished priestly apologist claims they are most sensitive. To  justify their own barbarism they assume a chivalry which they do not  possess. True chivalry respects all womanhood, and no one who reads the  record, as it is written in the faces of the million mulattoes in the  South, will for a minute conceive that the southern white man had a very  chivalrous regard for the honor due the women of his own race or respect  for the womanhood which circumstances placed in his power. That chivalry  which is \"most sensitive concerning the honor of women\" can hope for but  little respect from the civilized world, when it confines itself entirely  to the women who happen to be white. Virtue knows no color line, and the  chivalry which depends upon complexion of skin and texture of hair can  command no honest respect.    When emancipation came to the Negroes, there arose in the northern part of  the United States an almost divine sentiment among the noblest, purest  and best white women of the North, who felt called to a mission to educate  and Christianize the millions of southern exslaves. From every nook and  corner of the North, brave young white women answered that call and left  their cultured homes, their happy associations and their lives of ease,  and with heroic determination went to the South to carry light and truth  to the benighted blacks. It was a heroism no less than that which calls  for volunteers for India, Africa and the Isles of the sea. To educate  their unfortunate charges; to teach them the Christian virtues and to  inspire in them the moral sentiments manifest in their own lives, these  young women braved dangers whose record reads more like fiction than fact.  They became social outlaws in the South. The peculiar sensitiveness of the  southern white men for women, never shed its protecting influence about  them. No friendly word from their own race cheered them in their work; no  hospitable doors gave them the companionship like that from which they had  come. No chivalrous white man doffed his hat in honor or respect. They  were \"Nigger teachers\"--unpardonable offenders in the social ethics of the  South, and were insulted, persecuted and ostracised, not by Negroes, but  by the white manhood which boasts of its chivalry toward women.    And yet these northern women worked on, year after year, unselfishly, with  a heroism which amounted almost to martyrdom. Threading their way through  dense forests, working in schoolhouse, in the cabin and in the church,  thrown at all times and in all places among the unfortunate and lowly  Negroes, whom they had come to find and to serve, these northern women,  thousands and thousands of them, have spent more than a quarter of a  century in giving to the colored people their splendid lessons for home  and heart and soul. Without protection, save that which innocence gives to  every good woman, they went about their work, fearing no assault and  suffering none. Their chivalrous protectors were hundreds of miles away in  their northern homes, and yet they never feared any \"great dark-faced  mobs,\" they dared night or day to \"go beyond their own roof trees.\" They  never complained of assaults, and no mob was ever called into existence to  avenge crimes against them. Before the world adjudges the Negro a moral  monster, a vicious assailant of womanhood and a menace to the sacred  precincts of home, the colored people ask the consideration of the silent  record of gratitude, respect, protection and devotion of the millions of  the race in the South, to the thousands of northern white women who have  served as teachers and missionaries since the war.    The Negro may not have known what chivalry was, but he knew enough to  preserve inviolate the womanhood of the South which was entrusted to his  hands during the war.

[Footnote 3: The technical term for nervousness is  _psycho-neurosis_--disease of the psyche. There are certain \"real  neuroses\" such as paralysis and spinal-cord disease, which involve an  organic impairment of nerve-tissue. However, as this book deals only  with psychic disturbance, we shall, throughout, use the term  _neuroses_ and _psycho-neuroses_ indiscriminately, to denote nervous  or functional disorders.]    To still other people nervous trouble means fear,--just terrible fear  without object or meaning or reason (anxiety neuroses); or a definite  fear of some harmless object (phobia); or a strange, persistent,  recurrent idea, quite foreign to the personality and beyond the reach  of reason (obsession); or an insistent desire to perform some absurd  act (compulsion); or perhaps, a deadly and pall-like depression (the  blues).    As a matter of fact, the neuroses include all these varieties, and  various shades and combinations of each. There are, however, certain  mental characteristics which recur with surprising regularity in most  of the various phases--dissatisfaction, lack of confidence, a sense of  being alone and shut in to oneself, doubt, anxiety, fear, worry,  self-depreciation, lack of interest in outside affairs, pessimism,  fixed belief in one's powerlessness, along whatever line it may be.    Underneath all these differing forms of nervousness are the same  mechanisms and the same kind of difficulty. To understand one is to  understand all, and to understand normal people as well; for in the  last analysis we are one and all built on the same lines and governed  by the same laws. The only difference is, that, as Jung says, \"the  nervous person falls ill of the conflicts with which the well person  battles successfully.\"      SUMMARY    Since at least seventy-five per cent. of all the people who apply to  physicians for help are nervous patients; and since these thousands of  patients are not among the mental incompetents, but are as a rule  among the highly organized, conscientious folk who have most to  contribute to the leadership of the world, it is obviously of vital  importance to society that its citizens should be taught how to solve  their inner conflicts and keep well. In this strategic period of  reconstruction, the world that is being remodeled cannot afford to  lose one leader because of an unnecessary breakdown.    There is greater need than ever for people who can keep at their tasks  without long enforced rests; people who can think deeply and  continuously without brain-fag; people who can concentrate all their  powers on the work in hand without wasting time or energy on  unnecessary aches and pains; people whose bodies are kept up to the  top notch of vitality by well-digested food, well-slept sleep,  well-forgotten fatigue, and well-used reserve energy. That such a  state of affairs is no Utopian dream, but is merely a matter of  knowing how, will appear more clearly in later chapters.          CHAPTER II    _In which we learn what \"nerves\" are not, and get a hint of what they  are_    THE DRAMA OF NERVES    AN EXPLODED THEORY      =\"Nerves\" not Nerves.= Pick up any newspaper, turn over a few pages,  and you will be sure to come to an advertisement something like this:        Tired man, your nerves are sick!      They need rest and a tonic to restore        their worn-out depleted cells!    No wonder people have believed this kind of thing. It has been dinned  into their ears for many years. They have read it with their breakfast  coffee and gazed at it in the street cars and even heard it from their  family physicians, until it has become part and parcel of their  thinking; yet all the time the fundamental idea has been false, and  now, at last, the theory is exploded.    So far as the modern laboratory can discover, the nerves of the most  confirmed neurotic are perfectly healthy. They are not starved, nor  depleted, nor exhausted; the fat-sheath is not wanting, there is no  inflammation, there is nothing lacking in the cell itself, and there  is no accumulation of fatigue products. Paradoxical as it may sound,  there is nothing the matter with a nervous person's nerves. The  faithful messengers have borne the blame for so long that their name  has gotten itself woven into the very language as symbolic of disease.  When we speak of nervous prostration, neurasthenia, neuroses,  nervousness, and \"nerves\" we mean that body and mind are behaving  badly because of functional disorder. These terms are good enough as  figures of speech, so long as we are not fooled by them; but accepting  them in their literal sense has been a costly procedure.    Thanks to the investigations of physiologist and psychologist, usually  combined in the person of a physician, \"nervousness\" has been found to  be not an organic disease but a functional one. This is a very  important distinction, for an organic disease implies impairment of  the tissues of the organ, while a functional disorder means only a  disturbance of its action. In a purely nervous disorder there seems to  be no trouble with what the nerves and organs are, but only with what  they do; it is behavior and not tissue that is at fault. Of course, in  real life, things are seldom as clear-cut as they are in books, and  so it happens that often there is a combination of organic and  functional disease that is puzzling even to a skilled diagnostician.  The first essential is a diagnosis as to whether it be an organic  disease, with accompanying nervous symptoms, or a functional  disturbance complicated by some minor organic trouble. If the main  cause is organic, only physical means can cure it, but if the trouble  is functional, no amount of medicine or surgery, diet or rest, will  touch it; yet the symptoms are so similar and the dividing line is so  elusive, that great skill is sometimes required to determine whether a  given symptom points to a disturbance of physical tissue or only to  behavior.    If the physician is sometimes fooled, how much more the sufferer  himself! Nausea from a healthy stomach is just as sickening as nausea  from a diseased one. A fainting-spell is equally uncomfortable,  whether it come from an impaired heart or simply from one that is  behaving badly for the moment. It must be remembered that in  functional nervousness the trouble is very real. The organs are really  \"acting up.\" Sometimes it is the brain that misbehaves instead of the  stomach or heart. In that case it often reports all kinds of pains  that have no origin outside of the brain. Pain, of course, is  perceived only by the brain. Cut the telegraph wire, the nerve, and no  amount of injury to the finger can cause pain. It is equally true that  a misbehaving brain can report sensations that have no external  cause, that have not come in through the regular channel along the  nerve. The pain feels just the same, is every bit as uncomfortable as  though its cause were external.    Sometimes, instead of reporting false pains, the brain misbehaves in  other ways. It seems to lose its power to decide, to concentrate, or  to remember. Then the patient is almost sure to fancy himself going  insane. But insanity is a physical disease, implying changes or toxins  in the brain cells. Functional disorders tell another story. Their  cause is different, even though the picture they present is often a  close copy of an organic disease.    =Distorted Pictures.= It should not be thought, however, that the  symptoms of functional and organic troubles are identical. Hysteria  and neurasthenia closely simulate every imaginable physical disease,  but they do not exactly parallel any one of them. It may take a  skilled eye to discover the differences, but differences there are.  Functional troubles usually show a near-picture of organic disease,  with just enough contradictory or inconsistent features to furnish a  clue as to their real nature. For this reason it is important that the  treatment of the disease be solely the province of the physician; for  only the carefully trained in all the requirements of diagnosis can  differentiate the pseudo from the real, the innocuous from the  disastrous.    False or nervous neuritis may feel like real neuritis (the result of  poisons in the blood), but it gives itself away when it localizes  itself in parts of the body where there is no nerve trunk. The  exhaustion of neurasthenia sometimes seems extreme enough to be the  result of a dangerous physical condition; but when this exhaustion  disappears as if by magic under the proper kind of treatment, we know  that the trouble cannot be in the body. Let it be said, then, with all  the emphasis we can command, \"nerves\" are not physical. Laboratory  investigation, contradictory symptoms, and response to treatment all  bear witness to this fact. Whatever symptoms of disturbance there may  be in pure nervousness, the nerves and organs can in no way be shown  to be diseased.      THE POSITIVE SIDE    =\"Nerves\" not Imaginary.= \"But,\" some one says, \"how can healthy  organs misbehave in this way? Something must be wrong. There must be  some cause. If 'nerves' are not physical, what are they? They surely  can't be imaginary.\" Most emphatically, they are real; nothing could  be more maddening than to have some one suggest that our troubles are  \"mere imagination.\" No wonder such theories have been more popular  with the patient's family than with the patient himself. Many years  ago a physician put the whole truth into a few words: \"The patient  says, 'I cannot'; his friends say, 'He will not'; the doctor says, 'He  cannot will.'\" He tries, but in the circumstances he really cannot.    =The Man behind the Body.= The trouble is real; the organs do \"act  up\"; the nerves do carry the wrong messages.
