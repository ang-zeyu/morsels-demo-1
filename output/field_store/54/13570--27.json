Take four large bunches of asparagus, scrape it nicely, cut off one inch  of the tops, and lay them in water, chop the stalks and put them on the  fire with a piece of bacon, a large onion cut up, and pepper and salt;  add two quarts of water, boil them till the stalks are quite soft, then  pulp them through a sieve, and strain the water to it, which must be put  back in the pot; put into it a chicken cut up, with the tops of  asparagus which had been laid by, boil it until these last articles are  sufficiently done, thicken with flour, butter and milk, and serve it up.           *       *       *       *       *    BEEF SOUP.    Take the hind shin of beef, cut off all the flesh off the leg-bone,  which must be taken away entirely, or the soup will be greasy. Wash the  meat clean and lay it in a pot, sprinkle over it one small  table-spoonful of pounded black pepper, and two of salt; three onions  the size of a hen's egg, cut small, six small carrots scraped and cut  up, two small turnips pared and cut into dice; pour on three quarts of  water, cover the pot close, and keep it gently and steadily boiling five  hours, which will leave about three pints of clear soup; do not let the  pot boil over, but take off the scum carefully, as it rises. When it has  boiled four hours, put in a small bundle of thyme and parsley, and a  pint of celery cut small, or a tea-spoonful of celery seed pounded.  These latter ingredients would lose their delicate flavour if boiled too  much. Just before you take it up, brown it in the following manner: put  a small table-spoonful of nice brown sugar into an iron skillet, set it  on the fire and stir it till it melts and looks very dark, pour into it  a ladle full of the soup, a little at a time; stirring it all the while.  Strain this browning and mix it well with the soup; take out the bundle  of thyme and parsley, put the nicest pieces of meat in your tureen, and  pour on the soup and vegetables; put in some toasted bread cut in dice,  and serve it up.           *       *       *       *       *    GRAVY SOUP.    Get eight pounds of coarse lean beef--wash it clean and lay it in your  pot, put in the same ingredients as for the shin soup, with the same  quantity of water, and follow the process directed for that. Strain the  soup through a sieve, and serve it up clear, with nothing more than  toasted bread in it; two table-spoonsful of mushroom catsup will add a  fine flavour to the soup.           *       *       *       *       *    SOUP WITH BOUILLI.    Take the nicest part of the thick brisket of beef, about eight pounds,  put it into a pot with every thing directed for the other soup; make it  exactly in the same way, only put it on an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12539"],[0,"Observations Upon the Windward Coast of Africa (#2)"],[1,"the Purrah    Of the _Termite_, _Termes_, or _Bug a Bug_, as it is called by the Natives  upon the Windward Coast of Africa    Of the Camelion    On the Interment of the Dead    On the Amusements, Musical Instruments, &c. of the Africans    Concluding Observations    Vocabulary of the Languages of the principal Nations of the Windward Coast  of Africa    DIRECTIONS TO THE BINDER.

The narrow stripe of blue cloth suspended behind from the covering which  adorns one of the figures in the back ground, distinguishes a female in the  state of virginity.    This distinguishing mark of _virgin purity_ is uniformly removed upon  entering into the matrimonial state, and is called by the Timmauees  _Tintanjey_.    In the Plate of Bance Island, River Sierra Leone, page 33, is a correct  representation of the _Pullam_ tree, described in page 38, as bearing a  species of silk cotton, or ether down, and is much revered by the natives,  who consider it in many instances as their _Fetish_.      *       *       *       *       *      ERRATA.

CHAPTER I.          _Remarks from the Period of my Embarkation at St. Helens, to my arrival at  Sierra Leone--Sketches of the Land discovered in the Passage--its Bearings  and Distance--with Observations upon the Bay and Entrance of Sierra Leone  River, &c._    Previous to my arrival and landing in the river Sierra Leone, on the 6th of  April, 1805, I shall notice my passage, and display the sketches I have  taken of the land we fell in with, its bearings and distance, for the  observation of the mariner, which from position and prominence to the  Atlantic, claim his most serious attention in running down the coast of  Africa to-windward.[1]    On the 9th March, 1805, I sailed from St. Helens in the ship  Thames,  commanded by James Welsh, in company with a fleet  of ships bound to the  East Indies, under convoy of his Majesty's  ship Indostan. We had a  favourable run down Channel; but,  after making to the westward of Scilly,  a heavy gale of wind  separated the Thames from the convoy, which we never  afterwards  regained, and were therefore obliged, at all hazards, to  proceed for our destination upon the coast of Africa.    Nothing interesting occurred during a prosperous and quick passage, until  the high land of Sierra Leone appeared in view on the evening of the 5th of  April. We came to an anchor outside the Capes, and weighed the next  morning, steering our course for the river.    The space between Leopard's Island, situated to the north, and Cape Sierra  Leone to the south, forms the entrance into the river Sierra Leone; being  in latitude 8 deg. 30\" N. and in 13 deg. 43\" W. long. and is computed about seven  geographical leagues distant. The river empties itself immediately into the  ocean; and its level banks to the north are covered with impervious  forests, while those to the south exhibit the romantic scenery of an  extended chain of lofty mountains and hills, clothed and ornamented with  foliage of the most luxuriant nature, exciting the highest admiration in  those who are susceptible of the impressions which the sublime works of the  creation never fail to inspire.    Upon entering the bay, the eye is attracted by an extensive river,  circumscribed by the foregoing outline, and exhibiting upon its banks an  assemblage of the productions of nature, vegetating in their native purity.  This view is animated by the prospect of the colony of Sierra Leone, and  the masts of vessels  and craft which commerce, and a safe anchorage,  encourage to assemble before it, and by numerous natives paddling with  great dexterity in their canoes.        [Illustration: PALMA bearing S. by W. distant about 8 leagues from A  Published Aug 1 1807 by G & W Nicol]        As I shall have occasion to speak hereafter of the importance of this bay  in a commercial and agricultural point of view, I shall not at present  enter into farther details; but only suggest that I consider it as a  position from whence active enterprize may perform its operations  throughout an extensive district, and derive the most important advantages.    At two. P.M. came to an anchor before the fort and settlement of Bance  Island, which we saluted with seven guns. The river is navigable up to this  island for ships, and small craft proceed a number of miles higher, on the  branches of the Port Logo and Rochell. It is obscured from the view by the  island of Tasso, until bearing round a point of that island called Tasso  Point; the eye is then attracted by a regular fortification, and even an  elegant range of buildings and store-houses, which, with great propriety,  may be considered as one of the most desirable positions upon the windward  coast of Africa, to command the interior commerce of the countries  bordering upon the river Sierra Leone and its branches, and that of the  rivers to the northward, the Scarcies and adjoining rivers, the Rio Pongo,  with the Isles De Loss, Rio Grande, Rio Noonez, &c. and those which fall  into the sea from Cape Sierra Leone to Cape Palmas.    Tasso is an island adjoining, about a mile and a half distant, of some  extent, and a remarkably fertile soil. It is attached to Bance Island;  bearing cotton of a very good staple, and is capable of producing any  tropical production. Considerable labour and expense have been applied to  introduce cultivation into this island, and to exemplify to the African the  advantages derivable from his native soil, by the civil arts of life; while  under a still more scientific superintendency, it would become a possession  of very considerable consequence in an agricultural view.    Bance Island is little more than a barren rock, of about three-quarters of  a mile in extent. The entrance into the fort is through a folding door or  gate, over which, throughout the night, a watch is constantly placed. The  expectations excited by its external appearance were by no means lessened  by a view of the interior of the fort, in which were assembled several  traders, and chiefs, with their attendants. I was much the object of their  curiosity and attention; and in their manner, all came up to me, to  _give  me service _, as expressed in the idiom of their language. This ceremony is  simply performed by touching the fingers, accompanied in the Timminy  language by the usual obeisance of  _Currea _, or, how do you do? The reply  to this is _Ba_, which means good, I return you service.    The Grumittas, or free black people, are assembled outside the fort, in  houses or huts built with mud, upon the general construction in Africa,  which usually is an oblong square, raised little more than eight feet; or a  circle of the same height, over which is thrown a roof of bamboo, or other  thatch, supported by posts about five or six feet asunder, forming a  canopy, which shelters them from the rays of the sun, or the inclemency of  the weather, and affords a shade under which they retire in the extreme  heat of the day, where they repose in their hammocks, or rest upon their  mats. This group of buildings or huts is denominated Adam's Town, from the  black chief who presides over these labouring people. Their numbers may be  estimated at about 600. Originally they were slaves to the proprietors of  this island; but from a very humane and wise policy, they have been endowed  with certain privileges, which rescue them from an absolute state of  slavery, and prevents their being sold as slaves, unless they are convicted  by the laws and customs of their country of some crime or delinquency.    Among these people are artizans in various branches, viz. smiths,  carpenters, joiners, masons, &c. under the superintendance of Europeans in  their different trades, who for ingenuity and adroitness in their  respective capacities, would deserve the approbation even of the  connoisseur in these arts; while in many other instances they discover a  genius of the most intelligent character, and a decency in their dress and  manners distinguished from that among the surrounding tribes; which is the  never failing consequence of the influence of the arts of civilized society  over barbarous customs and habits.
