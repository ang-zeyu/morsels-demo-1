'Apollo and the Mouse' suggests hypothetically, as a possible explanation  of the tie between the God and the Beast, that Apollo-worship superseded,  but did not eradicate, Totemism.  The suggestion is little more than a  conjecture.    'Star Myths' points out that Greek myths of stars are a survival from the  savage stage of fancy in which such stories are natural.    'Moly and Mandragora' is a study of the Greek, the modern, and the  Hottentot folklore of magical herbs, with a criticism of a scholarly and  philological hypothesis, according to which Moly is the dog-star, and  Circe the moon.    'The Kalevala' is an account of the Finnish national poem; of all poems  that in which the popular, as opposed to the artistic, spirit is  strongest.  The Kalevala is thus a link between Marchen and Volkslieder  on one side, and epic poetry on the other.    'The Divining Rod' is a study of a European and civilised superstition,  which is singular in its comparative lack of copious savage analogues.    'Hottentot Mythology' is a criticism of the philological method, applied  to savage myth.    'Fetichism and the Infinite,' is a review of Mr. Max Muller's theory that  a sense of the Infinite is the germ of religion, and that Fetichism is  secondary, and a corruption.  This essay also contains a defence of the  _evidence_ on which the anthropological method relies.    The remaining essays are studies of the 'History of the Family,' and of  'Savage Art.'    The essay on 'Savage Art' is reprinted, by the kind permission of Messrs.  Cassell & Co., from two numbers (April and May, 1882) of the Magazine of  Art.  I have to thank the editors and publishers of the Contemporary  Review, the Cornhill Magazine, and Fraser's Magazine, for leave to  republish 'The Early History of the Family,' 'The Divining Rod,' and  'Star Myths,' and 'The Kalevala.'  A few sentences in 'The Bull-Roarer,'  and 'Hottentot Mythology,' appeared in essays in the Saturday Review, and  some lines of 'The Method of Folklore' in the Guardian.  To the editors  of those journals also I owe thanks for their courteous permission to  make this use of my old articles.    To Mr. E. B. Tylor and Mr. W. R. S. Ralston I must express my gratitude  for the kindness with which they have always helped me in all  difficulties.    I must apologise for the controversial matter in the volume.  Controversy  is always a thing to be avoided, but, in this particular case, when a  system opposed to the prevalent method has to be advocated, controversy  is unavoidable.  My respect for the learning of my distinguished  adversaries is none the less great because I am not convinced by their  logic, and because my doubts are excited by their differences.    Perhaps, it should be added, that these essays are, so to speak, only  flint-flakes from a neolithic workshop.  This little book merely  skirmishes (to change the metaphor) in front of a much more methodical  attempt to vindicate the anthropological interpretation of myths.  But  lack of leisure and other causes make it probable that my 'Key to All  Mythologies' will go the way of Mr. Casaubon's treatise.          THE METHOD OF FOLKLORE.      After the heavy rain of a thunderstorm has washed the soil, it sometimes  happens that a child, or a rustic, finds a wedge-shaped piece of metal or  a few triangular flints in a field or near a road.  There was no such  piece of metal, there were no such flints, lying there yesterday, and the  finder is puzzled about the origin of the objects on which he has  lighted.  He carries them home, and the village wisdom determines that  the wedge-shaped piece of metal is a 'thunderbolt,' or that the bits of  flint are 'elf-shots,' the heads of fairy arrows.  Such things are still  treasured in remote nooks of England, and the 'thunderbolt' is applied to  cure certain maladies by its touch.    As for the fairy arrows, we know that even in ancient Etruria they were  looked on as magical, for we sometimes see their points set, as amulets,  in the gold of Etruscan necklaces.  In Perugia the arrowheads are still  sold as charms.  All educated people, of course, have long been aware  that the metal wedge is a celt, or ancient bronze axe-head, and that it  was not fairies, but the forgotten peoples of this island who used the  arrows with the tips of flint.  Thunder is only so far connected with  them that the heavy rains loosen the surface soil, and lay bare its long  hidden secrets.    There is a science, Archaeology, which collects and compares the material  relics of old races, the axes and arrow-heads.  There is a form of study,  Folklore, which collects and compares the similar but immaterial relics  of old races, the surviving superstitions and stories, the ideas which  are in our time but not of it.  Properly speaking, folklore is only  concerned with the legends, customs, beliefs, of the Folk, of the people,  of the classes which have least been altered by education, which have  shared least in progress.  But the student of folklore soon finds that  these unprogressive classes retain many of the beliefs and ways of  savages, just as the Hebridean people use spindle-whorls of stone, and  bake clay pots without the aid of the wheel, like modern South Sea  Islanders, or like their own prehistoric ancestors. {11a}  The student of  folklore is thus led to examine the usages, myths, and ideas of savages,  which are still retained, in rude enough shape, by the European  peasantry.  Lastly, he observes that a few similar customs and ideas  survive in the most conservative elements of the life of educated  peoples, in ritual, ceremonial, and religious traditions and myths.  Though such remains are rare in England, we may note the custom of  leading the dead soldier's horse behind his master to the grave, a relic  of days when the horse would have been sacrificed. {11b}  We may observe  the persistence of the ceremony by which the monarch, at his coronation,  takes his seat on the sacred stone of Scone, probably an ancient fetich  stone.  Not to speak, here, of our own religious traditions, the old vein  of savage rite and belief is found very near the surface of ancient Greek  religion.  It needs but some stress of circumstance, something answering  to the storm shower that reveals the flint arrow-heads, to bring savage  ritual to the surface of classical religion.  In sore need, a human  victim was only too likely to be demanded; while a feast-day, or a  mystery, set the Greeks dancing serpent-dances or bear-dances like Red  Indians, or swimming with sacred pigs, or leaping about in imitation of  wolves, or holding a dog-feast, and offering dog's flesh to the gods.  {12}  Thus the student of folklore soon finds that he must enlarge his  field, and examine, not only popular European story and practice, but  savage ways and ideas, and the myths and usages of the educated classes  in civilised races.  In this extended sense the term 'folklore' will  frequently be used in the following essays.  The idea of the writer is  that mythology cannot fruitfully be studied apart from folklore, while  some knowledge of anthropology is required in both sciences.    The science of Folklore, if we may call it a science, finds everywhere,  close to the surface of civilised life, the remains of ideas as old as  the stone elf-shots, older than the celt of bronze.  In proverbs and  riddles, and nursery tales and superstitions, we detect the relics of a  stage of thought, which is dying out in Europe, but which still exists in  many parts of the world.  Now, just as the flint arrow-heads are  scattered everywhere, in all the continents and isles, and everywhere are  much alike, and bear no very definite marks of the special influence of  race, so it is with the habits and legends investigated by the student of  folklore.  The stone arrow-head buried in a Scottish cairn is like those  which were interred with Algonquin chiefs.  The flints found in Egyptian  soil, or beside the tumulus on the plain of Marathon, nearly resemble the  stones which tip the reed arrow of the modern Samoyed.  Perhaps only a  skilled experience could discern, in a heap of such arrow-heads, the  specimens which are found in America or Africa from those which are  unearthed in Europe.  Even in the products of more advanced industry, we  see early pottery, for example, so closely alike everywhere that, in the  British Museum, Mexican vases have, ere now, been mixed up on the same  shelf with archaic vessels from Greece.  In the same way, if a  superstition or a riddle were offered to a student of folklore, he would  have much difficulty in guessing its _provenance_, and naming the race  from which it was brought.  Suppose you tell a folklorist that, in a  certain country, when anyone sneezes, people say 'Good luck to you,' the  student cannot say a priori what country you refer to, what race you have  in your thoughts.  It may be Florida, as Florida was when first  discovered; it may be Zululand, or West Africa, or ancient Rome, or  Homeric Greece, or Palestine.  In all these, and many other regions, the  sneeze was welcomed as an auspicious omen.  The little superstition is as  widely distributed as the flint arrow-heads.  Just as the object and use  of the arrow-heads became intelligible when we found similar weapons in  actual use among savages, so the salutation to the sneezer becomes  intelligible when we learn that the savage has a good reason for it.  He  thinks the sneeze expels an evil spirit.  Proverbs, again, and riddles  are as universally scattered, and the Wolufs puzzle over the same  devinettes as the Scotch schoolboy or the Breton peasant.  Thus, for  instance, the Wolufs of Senegal ask each other, 'What flies for ever, and  rests never?'--Ans"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14082"],[0,"Le Corbeau = The Raven (#2)"],[1,"eux, sinistre, maigre et augural oiseau de      jadis signifiait en croassant: «Jamais plus.»_    This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing  To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;  This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining  On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,  But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,                                    _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!        _Cela, je m'assis occupé à le conjecturer, mais n'adressant pas une      syllabe à l'oiseau dont les yeux de feu brûlaient, maintenant, au fond      de mon sein; cela et plus encore, je m'assis pour le deviner, ma tête      reposant à l'aise sur la housse de velours des coussins que dévorait      la lumière de la lampe, housse violette de velours dévoré par la      lumière de la lampe qu'_Elle_ ne pressera plus, ah! jamais plus._    Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer,  Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.  \"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath sent thee  Respite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!
