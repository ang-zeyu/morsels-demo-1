Among the experts on the public aspects of the question were:--MR.  BRYCE, who has been an ardent lover of the wilds throughout his  distinguished career on both sides of the Atlantic; LORD GREY, who paid  special attention to the subject during his journey to Hudson Bay in  1910; MR. KIPLING, whose _Jungle Books_ revealed the soul of wild life  to so many readers; and MR. ROOSEVELT, a sportsman-naturalist of  world-wide fame, during whose Presidential terms more wild-life  conservation was effected in the United States than during all other  Presidential terms put together, before or since.    To this I am graciously permitted to add that HIS MAJESTY THE KING was  pleased to manifest his interest in the subject by taking the _Address_  with him to read on his way to India; and that HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE  DUKE OF CONNAUGHT, Governor-General, who has shown his own keen interest  on several occasions, has marked his approval by writing the following  letter for publication here:--           Dear Colonel Wood,         I have been reading with the greatest interest your       address on Animal Sanctuaries in Labrador and also the       draft of the Supplement which you were good enough to       send me for perusal. You have certainly been so far       rewarded for your trouble by having collected a great       weight of testimony and of valuable opinions, all       endorsing the useful cause to which you are devoting       yourself.         I know from reports that many varieties of game, which       were threatened with extinction in South Africa ten years       ago, have, by the timely establishment of game reserves,       been saved, and are now relatively numerous. I may add       that this end has not been obtained simply by the       establishment of the reserves and by the passing of       game-laws, but by enforcing those laws in the most rigid       manner and by appointing the right men to enforce them.         From personal experience I know what the game reserves       have done for East Africa. In these reserves the wild       animals are left to breed and live in peace, undisturbed       by any one but the game-warden. From them the overflow       drifts out into the surrounding districts and provides a       plentiful supply for the hunter and settler. What has       been done in Africa could be done in Canada and       elsewhere. You have so much land which is favourable to       birds and beasts, though unfavourable to the settler,       that it would seem to be no hardship to give up a       suitable area or areas for the purpose of a reserve.       This, with the infliction of heavy penalties for the       ruthless destruction of animal life, should secure a       fresh lease of existence for the various species whose       extermination now appears to be imminent.         Please accept my best wishes for the success of your       work, in which you may always count upon my greatest       sympathy.         Believe me,         Yours truly,         ARTHUR.          II. VERIFICATION.      In order to make quite sure about conditions up to date, I spent two  months last summer examining some 1500 miles of coast line, from Nova  Scotia, round by Newfoundland to the Straits, and thence inwards along  the Canadian Labrador and North Shore of the St. Lawrence. On the whole,  I found that I had rather under- than over-stated the dangers  threatening the wild life there, and that I had nothing to retract from  what I said in my _Address_ and _Supplement_.    As I spent one month among the fishermen of Nova Scotia and  Newfoundland, who commit most of the depredations, and the other month  among the people along the Canadian Labrador, on whom the depredations  are committed, I enjoyed the advantage of hearing both sides of the  story. It was very much what I had heard before and what I said it was.  The argument is, that so long as there is no law, or no law put in  force, every man will do what he likes--which is unanswerably true. I am  also afraid that there is no practical answer to the logical deduction  from this, that so long as bad men can do what they like good men must  do the same or \"get left\". Good, bad and indifferent, all alike, are  squandering the capital of the wild life as fast as they can, though the  legitimate interest of it would soon yield far better returns if  conservation was to replace the beggaring methods in vogue to-day.    I would urge the earliest possible extension of thoroughly well enforced  wild-life conservation laws to the whole Labrador peninsula; and I would  venture to remind the Commission again, as I did in my _Supplement_,  that the wild life of Arctic Canada is even now in danger and ought to  be efficiently protected before it is too late. But, for the present  purpose, I shall revert to Labrador only; and, for a practical  beginning, recommend the immediate adoption of conservation only in the  \"Canadian Labrador\".    So far as I could judge from talking things over with the south coast  trappers, most of the fur-bearing animals seem to be holding their own  fairly well in the market. But it should be remembered that, with the  recent great rise in prices, fewer skins may mean more money, and that  even the establishment of fox farms, and the probable establishment of  other fur farms, may not overtake the present increasing demand, which,  in its turn, must tend to deplete the original source of supply still  further, unless strict conservation is enforced. There was a wonderful  supply of foxes a year ago, though nothing to the muskrats which  swarmed down south last fall. But failure of food further north may  have had more to do with those irruptions than any outburst of unusual  fecundity. Caribou apparently remain much as they have been lately. But  the hunger of wolves and the greed of men are two enemies that nothing  but conservation can keep in check. Of course, genuinely \"necessary  food\" is not at all in question. I know an old hunter, living at  Pokkashoo in summer and St. Augustine in winter, who brought in sixteen  caribou last season. But he gave fifteen away to really necessitous  families and kept only one for himself.    The whale factories at Lark Harbour and Hawke Bay, on the west coast of  Newfoundland, were both closed for want of whales. The only one in the  Gulf that was working last year was at Seven Islands, on the North  Shore, 300 miles below Quebec. I happened to be almost in at the death  of the biggest finback ever taken. But, speaking generally, the season  was not really prosperous. The station of Seven Islands is worked by  Norwegians, who are the most exterminatingly efficient whalers in the  world. They worked their own whaleries to exhaustion and raised so much  feeling against them among the fishermen that the Norwegian government  forbad every factory along the shore. They then invented floating  factories, which may still be used in Canadian waters with deadly effect  unless we put whaling under conservation. The feeling among the  fishermen here is the same as elsewhere, strongly in favour of the  whales and strongly against the exterminating kind of whaler, because  whales are believed to drive the bait fish close inshore, which is very  \"handy\" for the fishermen.    The spring sealing of 1912 was a failure on the Canadian Labrador, as  the main \"harp\" herd was missed by just one day. The whole industry is  carried on by Newfoundlanders and men whose vessels take their catch to  Newfoundland, because the only working plant is concentrated there. The  excessive spring kill greatly depletes the females and young, as it  takes place in the whelping season, when the herds are moving north  along the off-shore ice; and this depletion naturally spoils not only  the Newfoundlanders' permanent industry itself but the much smaller  inshore autumn catch by our own Canadian Labradorians, when the herds  are moving south. The Canadians along the North Shore and Labrador look  upon the invading Newfoundlanders, in this and other pursuits, very much  as a farmer looks upon a gipsy whose horse comes grazing in his  hayfield. And the analogy sometimes does hold good. When men under a  different government, men who do not own a foot of land in Canada, men  who do not pay specific taxes for Canadian rights, when these men  slaughter seals on inshore ice, use land and inlets for cleaning fish  and foul the water with their \"gurry\", and when they also \"egg\" on other  peoples' islands in defiance of the law, then the analogy is perfect. It  does not hold good, of course, in ordinary fishing, which is conducted  under Dominion licence and vigilantly watched by Commander Wakeham. But  whether Canada is not giving away too much for what she gets in licences  is quite another question.    The excessive spring kill by the Newfoundlanders does not seem to be the  only reason why the local seal hunt is not so good as it used to be. The  whites complain that the Indians along the coast kill an undue number of  seals on the one hand and of caribou on the other. But fishermen all "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15019"],[0,"A Queens Delight (#2)"],[1," little cold again, then put in your Flowers, and let  them stand close covered twenty four hours; you may put in but half the  flowers at a time, the strength will come out the better; to that liquor  put in four pound of Sugar, let it lye in all night, next day boil it in  a Gallipot, set it in a pot of water, and there let it boil till all the  Sugar be melted and the syrup be pretty thick, then take it out, and let  it stand in that till it be through cold, then glass it.        _To make Syrup of Hysop for Colds._    Take a handful of Hysop, of Figs, Raisins, Dates, of each an ounce, of  Collipint half an handful, French Barley one ounce, boil therein three  pints of fair water to a quart, strain it and clarifie it with two  whites of Eggs, then put in two pound of fine sugar, and boil it to a  syrup.        _To make Orange Water._    Take a pottle of the best Maligo Sack, and put in as many of the peels  of Oranges as will go in, cut the white clean off, let them steep twenty  four hours; still them in a glass still, and let the water run into the  Receiver upon fine Sugar-candy; you may still it in an ordinary Still.        _To dry Cherries._    Take a pound of sugar, dissolve it in thin fair water, when it is boiled  a little while, put in your Cherries after they are stoned, four pound  to one pound of Sugar, let them lye in the Sugar three dayes, then take  them out of the syrup and lay them on sieves one by one, and set them  before the Sun upon stools, turn them every day, else they will mould;  when they look of a dark red colour, and are dry then put them up. And  so you may do any manner of Fruit. In the Sun is the best drying of  them, put into the syrup some juyce of Rasps.        _To make juyce of Liquorish._    Take English Liquorish, and stamp it very clean, bruise it with a  hammer, and cut it in peices; to a pound of Liquorish thus bruised, put  a quart of Hysop water, let them soak together in an earthen pot a day  and a night, then pull the Liquorish into small pieces, and lay it in  soak again two dayes more; then strain out the Liquorish, and boil the  liquor a good while. Stir it often; then put in half a pound of  Sugar-candy, or Loaf-sugar finely beaten, four grains of Musk, as much  Ambergreece, bruise them small with a little Sugar; then boil them  together till it be good & thick, still have care you burn it not; then  put it out in glass plates, and make it into round rolls, and set it in  a drying place till it be stiff, that you may work it into rolls to be  cut as big as Barley corns, and so lay them on a place again: If it be  needful strew on the place again a little Sugar to prevent thickning; so  dry them still if there be need and if they should be too dry, the heat  of the fire will soften them again.        _A Perfume for Cloths, Gloves._    Take of Linet two grains, of Musk three, of Ambergreece four, and the  oyl of Bems a pretty quantity; grinde them all upon a Marble stone fit  for that purpose; then with a brush or sponge rake them over, and it  will sweeten them very well; your Gloves or Jerkins must first be washed  in red Rose-water, and when they are almost dry, stretch them forth  smooth, and lay on the Perfumes.        _To make Almond Bisket._    Take the whites of four new laid Eggs, and two yolks, then beat it well  for an hour together, then have in readiness a quarter of a pound of the  best Almonds blanched in cold water, & beat them very small with  Bose-wart, for fear of Oyling; then, have a pound of the best Loaf-sugar  finely beaten, beat that in the Eggs a while, then put in your Almonds,  and five or six spoonfuls of the finest flower, and so bake them  together upon Paper plates, you may have a little fine Sugar in a piece  of tiffany to dust them over as they be in the Oven, so bake them as you  do Bisket.        _To dry Apricocks._    First stone them, then weigh them, take the weight of them in double  refined Sugar, make the syrup with so much water as will wet them, and  boil it up so high, that a drop being droped on a Plate it will slip  clean off, when it is cold, put in your Apricocks being pared, whilst  your Syrup is hot, but it must not be taken off the fire before you put  them in, then turn them in the syrup often, then let them stand 3  quarters of an hour, then take them out of the syrup, and tie them up in  Tiffanies, one in a tiffany or more, as they be in bigness, and whilst  you are tying them up, set the syrup on the fire to heat, but not to  boil, then put your Apricocks into the syrup, and set them on a quick  fire, and let them boil, as fast as you can, skim them clean, and when  they look clear take them from the fire, and let them lie in the syrup  till the next day, then set them on the fire to heat, but not to boil;  then set them by till the next day, and lay them upon a clean Sieve to  drain, and when they are well drained, take them out of the Tiffanies,  and so dry them in a Stove, or better in the Sun with Glasses over them,  to keep them from the dust.        _To make Quinces for Pies._    Wipe the Quinces, and put them into a little vessel of swall Beer when  it hath done working; stop them close that no air can get in, and this  will keep them fair all the year and good.        _The best way to break sweet Powder._    Take of Orrice one pound, Calamus a quarter of a pound, Benjamin one  half pound, Storax half a pound, Civet a quarter of an ounce, Cloves a  quarter of a pound, Musk one half ounce, Oyl of Orange flowers one  ounce, Lignum Aloes one ounce, Rosewood a quarter of a pound,  Ambergreece a quarter of an ounces. To every pound of Roses put a pound  of powder; the bag must be of Taffity, or else the powder will run  through.        _To make excellent Perfumes._    Take a quarter of a pound of Damask Rose-buds cut clean from the Whites,  stamp them very small, put to them a good spoonful of Damask Rose-water,  so let them stand close stoopped all night, then take one ounce and a  quarter of Benjamin finely beaten, and also searsed, (if you will)  twenty grains of Civit, and ten grains of Musk; mingle them well  together, then make it up in little Cakes between Rose leaves, and dry  them between sheets of Paper.        _To make Conserve of Roses boiled._    Take a quart of red Rose-water, a quart of fair water, boil in the Water  a pound of red Rose-leaves, the whites cut off, the leaves must be  boiled very tender; then take three pound of Sugar, and put to it a  pound at a time, and let it boil a little between every pound, so put it  up in your pots.        _To make Conserves of Roses unboiled._    Take a pound of red Rose leaves, the whites cut off, stamp them very  fine, take a pound of Sugar, and beat in with the Roses, and put it in a  pot, and cover it with leather, and set it in a cool place.        _To make a very good Pomatum._    Take the Fat of a young Dog one pound, it must be killed well that the  blood settle not into the fat, then let the outer skin be taken off  before it be opened, lest any of the hair come to the fat, then take all  the fat from the inside, and as soon as you take it off fling it into  Conduit water, and if you see the second skin be clear, peel it and  water it with the other: be sure it cools not out of the water: you must  not let any of the flesh remain on it, for then the Pomatum will not  keep. To one pound of this fat take two pound of Lambs caule, and put it  to the other in the water and when you see it is cold, drain it from the  water in a Napkin, and break it in little peices with your fingers, and  take out all the little veins; then take eight ounces of Oyl of Tartar,  and put in that first, stiring it well together, then put it into a  Gallon of Conduit water, and let it stand till night; shift this with so  much Oyl and Water, morning and evening seven dayes together, and be  sure you shift it constantly; and the day before you mean to melt it  wring it hard by a little at a time, and be sure the Oyl and water be  all out of it, wring the water well out of it with a Napkin every time  you shift it; then put in three pints of Rose-water; let it stand close  covered twelve hours, then wring out that, and put it in a pint of fresh  Rose-water into a high Gallipot with the _Faeces_; then tie it close up,  and set it in a pot of water, and let it boil two hours then take it  out, and strain it into an earthen Pan, let it stand till it be cold;  then cut a hole in it, and let out the water, then scrape away the  bottom, and dry it with a cloth, and dry the pan, melt it in a  Chafing-dish of Coales, or in the Gallipots; beat it so long till it  look very white and shining; then with your hand fling it in fine Cakes  upon white paper, and let it lye till it be cold, then put it into  Gallipots. This will be very good for two or three years.        _To make Raisin Wine._    Take two pound of Raisins of the Sun shred, a pound of good powdered  Sugar, the juice of two Lemons, one pill, put these into an earthen Pot  with a top, then take two gallons of water, let it boil half an hour,  then take it hot from the fire, and put it into the pot, and cover it  close for three or four dayes, stirring it twice a day, being strained  put it into bottles, and stop it more close, in a fortnight or three  weeks it may be drunk; you may put in Clove Gilly flowers, or Cowslips,  as the time of the year is when you make it; and when you have drawn  this from the Raisins, and bottled it up, heat two quarts of water more,  put it to the ingredients, and let it stand as aforesaid. This will be  good, but smaller than the other, the water must be boiled as the other.        _To make Rasberry Wine._    Take a Gallon of good Rhenish Wine, put into it as much Rasberries very  ripe as will make it strong, put it in an earthen pot, and let it stand  two dayes, then pour your Wine from your Rasberries, and put into every  bottle two ounces of Sugar, stop it up and keep it by you.
