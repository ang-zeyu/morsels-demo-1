If it were possible for adults to really remember their own feelings  and aspirations in adolescent years, or if it were possible for us  with enlightened sympathy to gain access to the enchanted garden of  youth, we should be more adequate guides for the boys and girls around  us. As it is we entirely fail to appreciate the heights of their  ambitions, hopes, and joys, and we have no measure with which to plumb  the depths of their fears, their disappointments, and their doubts.  The transition between radiant joy and confident hope in the future to  a miserable misinterpretation of sensations both physical and  psychical are rapid. It is the unknown that is terrible to us all, and  to the child the changes in its body, the changes in its soul and  spirit, which we pass by as commonplace, are full of suggestions of  abnormality, of disaster, and of death. Young people suffer much from  the want of comprehension and intelligent sympathy of their elders,  much also from their own ignorance and too fervid imagination. The  instability of the bodily tissues and the variability of their  functions find a counterpart in the instability of the mental and  moral natures and in the variability of their phenomena. Adolescents  indeed \"never continue in one stay;\" left to themselves they will  begin many pursuits, but persevere with, and finish, nothing.    Youth is the time for rapidly-succeeding friends, lovers, and heroes.  The schoolfellow or teacher who is adored to-day may become the object  of indifference or even of dislike to-morrow. Ideas as to the calling  or profession to be adopted change rapidly, and opinions upon  religion, politics, &c., vary from day to day. It is little wonder  that there is a special type of adolescent insanity differing entirely  from that of later years, one in which, owing to the want of full  development of mental faculties, there are no systematised delusions,  but a rapid change from depression and melancholy to exaltation  bordering on mania. Those parents and guardians who know something of  the peculiar physical and mental conditions of adolescence will be  best prepared both to treat the troubles wisely, and by sympathy to  help the young people under their care to help themselves.    One of the phenomena of adolescence is the dawn of the sexual  instinct. This frequently develops without the child knowing or  understanding what it means. More especially is this true of young  girls whose home life has been completely sheltered, and who have not  had the advantage, or disadvantage, of that experience of life which  comes early to those who live in crowded tenements or amongst the  outspoken people of the countryside. The children of the poorer  classes have, in a way, too little to learn: they are brought up from  babyhood in the midst of all domestic concerns, and the love affairs  of their elders are intimately known to them, therefore quite early in  adolescence \"ilka lassie has her laddie,\" and although the attraction  be short-lived and the affection very superficial, yet it is  sufficient to give an added interest to life, and generally leads to  an increased care in dress and an increased desire to make the most of  whatever good looks the girl may possess. The girl in richer homes is  probably much more bewildered by her unwonted sensations and by the  attraction she begins to feel towards the society of the opposite sex.    Probably in these days, when there is more intermingling of the sexes,  the girl's outlook is franker, and, so far as this is concerned,  healthier, than it was forty or fifty years ago. It is very amusing to  elders to hear a boy scarcely in his teens talking of \"his best girl,\"  or to see the little lass wearing the colour or ornament that her  chosen lad admires. It is true that the \"best girl\" varies from week  to week if not from day to day, but this special regard for a member  of the opposite sex announces the dawn of a simple sentiment that  will, a few years later, blossom out into the real passion which may  fix a life's destiny.    The mental and moral changes that occur during the early years of  adolescence call for help and sympathy of an even higher order than do  the changes in physical structure and function. Some of these changes,  such as shyness and reticence, may be the cause of considerable  suffering to the girl and a perplexity to her elders, but on the whole  they are comparatively easy of comprehension, and are more likely to  elicit sympathy and kindness than blame. It is far otherwise with such  changes as unseemly laughter, rough manners, and a nameless difference  in the girl's manner when in the presence of the other sex. A girl who  is usually quiet, modest, and sensible in her behaviour may suddenly  become boisterous and self-asserting, there is a great deal of  giggling, and altogether a disagreeable transformation which too  frequently involves the girl in trouble with her mother or other  guardian, and is very frequently harshly judged by the child herself.  In proportion as self-discipline has been taught and self-control  acquired, these outward manifestations are less marked, but in the  case of the great majority of girls there are, at any rate, impulses  having their origin in the yet immature and misunderstood sex impulse  which cause the young woman herself annoyance and worry although she  is as far from understanding their origin as her elders may be. The  remedies for these troubles are various. First in order of time and in  importance comes a habit of self-control and self-discipline that  ought to be coeval with conscious life. Fathers and mothers are  themselves to blame if their girl lapses from good behaviour when they  have not inculcated ideals of obedience, duty, and self-discipline  from babyhood. It seems such a little thing to let the child have its  run of the cake-basket and the sweet-box; it is in the eyes of many  parents so unimportant whether the little one goes to bed at the  appointed time or ten minutes later; they argue that it can make no  difference to her welfare in life or to her eternal destiny whether  her obedience is prompt and cheerful or grudging and imperfect. One  might as well argue that the proper planting of a seed, its regular  watering, and the influences of sun and wind make no difference to the  life of a tree. We have to bear carefully in mind that those who sow  an act reap a habit, who sow a habit reap a character, who sow a  character reap a destiny both in this world and in that which is  eternal. It is mere selfishness, unconscious, no doubt, but none the  less fatal, when parents to suit their own convenience omit to  inculcate obedience, self-restraint, habits of order and unselfishness  in their children. Youth is the time when the soul is apt to be shaken  by sorrow's power and when stormy passions rage. The tiny rill  starting from the mountainside can be readily deflected east or west,  but the majestic river hastening to the sea is beyond all such  arbitrary directions. So it is with the human being: the character and  habit are directed easily in infancy, with difficulty during  childhood, but they are well-nigh impossible of direction by the time  adolescence is established. Those fathers and mothers who desire to  have happiness and peace in connection with their adolescent boys and  girls must take the trouble to direct them aright during the plastic  years of infancy and childhood. All natural instincts implanted in us  by Him who knew what was in the heart of man are in themselves right  and good, but the exercise of these instincts may be entirely wrong in  time or in degree. The sexual instinct, the affinity of boy to girl,  the love of adult man and woman, are right and holy when exercised  aright, and it is the result of \"spoiling\" when these good and noble  instincts are wrongly exercised. All who love their country, all who  love their fellow men, and all who desire that the kingdom of God  should come, must surely do everything that is in their power to  awaken the fathers and mothers of the land to a sense of their heavy  responsibility and of their high privilege. In this we are entirely  separated from and higher than the rest of the animal creation, in  that on us lies the duty not only of calling into life a new  generation of human beings, but also the still higher duty, the still  greater privilege and the wider responsibility of bringing up those  children to be themselves the worthy parents of the future, the  supporters of their country's dignity, and joyful citizens of the  household of God.    Another characteristic of adolescence is to be found in  gregariousness, or what has been sometimes called the _gang spirit_.  Boys, and to almost as great a degree girls, form themselves into  companies or gangs, which frequently possess a high degree of  organisation. They elaborate special languages, they have their own  form of shorthand, their passwords, their rites and ceremonies. The  gang has its elected leader, its officers, its members; and although  it is liable to sudden disruption and seldom outlasts a few terms of  school-life, each succeeding club or company is for the time being of  paramount importance in the estimation of its members. The gang spirit  may at times cause trouble and lead to anxiety, but if rightly  directed it may be turned to good account. It is the germ of the  future capacity to organise men and women into corporate life--the  very method by which much public and national work is readily  accomplished, but which is impossible to accomplish by individual  effort.    3. Changes in the Religion of the Adolescent.--The religion of the  adolescent is apt to be marked by fervour and earnest conviction, the  phenomenon of \"conversion\" almost constantly occurring during  adolescence.

Richard, according to the romance which  bears his name, \"could no longer repress his fury. The Marquis he said,  was a traitor, who had robbed the Knights Hospitallers of sixty thousand  pounds, the present of his father Henry; that he was a renegade, whose  treachery had occasioned the loss of Acre; and he concluded by a solemn  oath, that he would cause him to be drawn to pieces by wild horses, if  he should ever venture to pollute the Christian camp by his presence.  Philip attempted to intercede in favour of the Marquis, and throwing  down his glove, offered to become a pledge for his fidelity to the  Christians; but his offer was rejected, and he was obliged to give way  to Richard's impetuosity.\"--HISTORY OF CHIVALRY.    Conrade of Montserrat makes a considerable figure in those wars, and was  at length put to death by one of the followers of the Scheik, or Old Man  of the Mountain; nor did Richard remain free of the suspicion of having  instigated his death.    It may be said, in general, that most of the incidents introduced in  the following tale are fictitious, and that reality, where it exists, is  only retained in the characters of the piece.    ABBOTSFORD, 1st July, 1832          APPENDIX TO INTRODUCTION.    While warring in the Holy Land, Richard was seized with an ague.    The best leeches of the camp were unable to effect the cure of the  King's disease; but the prayers of the army were more successful. He  became convalescent, and the first symptom of his recovery was a violent  longing for pork. But pork was not likely to be plentiful in a country  whose inhabitants had an abhorrence for swine's flesh; and         \"Though his men should be hanged,       They ne might, in that countrey,       For gold, ne silver, ne no money,       No pork find, take, ne get,       That King Richard might aught of eat.       An old knight with Richard biding,       When he heard of that tiding,       That the king's wants were swyche,       To the steward he spake privyliche--       \"Our lord the king sore is sick, I wis,       After porck he alonged is;       Ye may none find to selle;       No man be hardy him so to telle!       If he did he might die.       Now behoves to done as I shall say,       Tho' he wete nought of that.       Take a Saracen, young and fat;       In haste let the thief be slain,       Opened, and his skin off flayn;       And sodden full hastily,       With powder and with spicery,       And with saffron of good colour.       When the king feels thereof savour,       Out of ague if he be went,       He shall have thereto good talent.       When he has a good taste,       And eaten well a good repast,       And supped of the BREWIS [Broth] a sup,       Slept after and swet a drop,       Through Goddis help and my counsail,       Soon he shall be fresh and hail.'       The sooth to say, at wordes few,       Slain and sodden was the heathen shrew.       Before the king it was forth brought:       Quod his men, 'Lord, we have pork sought;       Eates and sups of the brewis SOOTE,[Sweet]       Thorough grace of God it shall be your boot.'       Before King Richard carff a knight,       He ate faster than he carve might.       The king ate the flesh and GNEW [Gnawed] the bones,       And drank well after for the nonce.       And when he had eaten enough,       His folk hem turned away, and LOUGH.[Laughed]       He lay still and drew in his arm;       His chamberlain him wrapped warm.       He lay and slept, and swet a stound,       And became whole and sound.       King Richard clad him and arose,       And walked abouten in the close.\"    An attack of the Saracens was repelled by Richard in person, the  consequence of which is told in the following lines:--         \"When King Richard had rested a whyle,       A knight his arms 'gan unlace,       Him to comfort and solace.       Him was brought a sop in wine.       'The head of that ilke swine,       That I of ate!' (the cook he bade,)       'For feeble I am, and faint and mad.       Of mine evil now I am fear;       Serve me therewith at my soupere!'       Quod the cook, 'That head I ne have.'       Then said the king, 'So God me save,       But I see the head of that swine,       For sooth, thou shalt lesen thine!'       The cook saw none other might be;       He fet the head and let him see.       He fell on knees, and made a cry--       'Lo, here the head!  my Lord, mercy!'\"    The cook had certainly some reason to fear that his master would be  struck with horror at the recollection of the dreadful banquet to which  he owed his recovery; but his fears were soon dissipated.         \"The swarte vis [Black face] when the king seeth,       His black beard and white teeth,       How his lippes grinned wide,       'What devil is this?' the king cried,       And 'gan to laugh as he were wode.       'What!  is Saracen's flesh thus good?       That never erst I nought wist!       By God's death and his uprist,       Shall we never die for default,       While we may in any assault,       Slee Saracens, the flesh may take,       And seethen and roasten and do hem bake,       [And] Gnawen her flesh to the bones!       Now I have it proved once,       For hunger ere I be wo,       I and my folk shall eat mo!\"'    The besieged now offered to surrender, upon conditions of safety to the  inhabitants; while all the public treasure, military machines, and arms  were delivered to the victors, together with the further ransom of  one hundred thousand bezants. After this capitulation, the following  extraordinary scene took place. We shall give it in the words of the  humorous and amiable George Ellis, the collector and the editor of these  Romances:--    \"Though the garrison had faithfully performed the other articles of  their contract, they were unable to restore the cross, which was not  in their possession, and were therefore treated by the Christians  with great cruelty. Daily reports of their sufferings were carried to  Saladin; and as many of them were persons of the highest distinction,  that monarch, at the solicitation of their friends, dispatched an  embassy to King Richard with magnificent presents, which he offered  for the ransom of the captives. The ambassadors were persons the most  respectable from their age, their rank, and their eloquence. They  delivered their message in terms of the utmost humility; and without  arraigning the justice of the conqueror in his severe treatment of their  countrymen, only solicited a period to that severity, laying at his feet  the treasures with which they were entrusted, and pledging themselves  and their master for the payment of any further sums which he might  demand as the price of mercy.         \"King Richard spake with wordes mild.       'The gold to take, God me shield!       Among you partes [Divide] every charge.       I brought in shippes and in barge,       More gold and silver with me,       Than has your lord, and swilke three.       To his treasure have I no need!       But for my love I you bid,       To meat with me that ye dwell;       And afterward I shall you tell.       Thorough counsel I shall you answer,       What BODE [Message] ye shall to your lord bear.    \"The invitation was gratefully accepted. Richard, in the meantime, gave  secret orders to his marshal that he should repair to the prison,  select a certain number of the most distinguished captives, and, after  carefully noting their names on a roll of parchment, cause their heads  to be instantly struck off; that these heads should be delivered to the  cook, with instructions to clear away the hair, and, after boiling  them in a cauldron, to distribute them on several platters, one to  each guest, observing to fasten on the forehead of each the piece of  parchment expressing the name and family of the victim.         \"'An hot head bring me beforn,       As I were well apayed withall,       Eat thereof fast I shall;       As it were a tender chick,       To see how the others will like.'    \"This horrible order was punctually executed. At noon the guests were  summoned to wash by the music of the waits. The king took his seat  attended by the principal officers of his court, at the high table, and  the rest of the company were marshalled at a long table below him.  On the cloth were placed portions of salt at the usual distances, but  neither bread, wine, nor water. The ambassadors, rather surprised at  this omission, but still free from apprehension, awaited in silence  the arrival of the dinner, which was announced by the sound of pipes,  trumpets, and tabours; and beheld, with horror and dismay, the unnatural  banquet introduced by the steward and his officers. Yet their sentiments  of disgust and abhorrence, and even their fears, were for a time  suspended by their curiosity. Their eyes were fixed on the king, who,  without the slightest change of countenance, swallowed the morsels as  fast as they could be supplied by the knight who carved them.         \"Every man then poked other;       They said, 'This is the devil's brother,       That slays our men, and thus hem eats!'    \"Their attention was then involuntarily fixed on the smoking heads  before them. They traced in the swollen and distorted features the  resemblance of a friend or near relation, and received from the  fatal scroll which accompanied each dish the sad assurance that this  resemblance was not imaginary. They sat in torpid silence, anticipating  their own fate in that of their countrymen; while their ferocious  entertainer, with fury in his eyes, but with courtesy on his lips,  insulted them by frequent invitations to merriment. At length this first  course was removed, and its place supplied by venison, cranes, and other  dainties, accompanied by the richest wines. The king then apologized to  them for what had passed, which he attributed to his ignorance of their  taste; and"]]]
