The circling throng an opening drew        Upon the verdant-grass      To let the vast procession through      To spread their rich repast in view,        And Elder J. L. pass.        Then Elder J. with lifted eyes        In musing posture stood,      Invoked a blessing from the skies      To save from vermin, mites and flies,        And keep the bounty good.        Now mellow strokes the yielding pile        From polished steel receives,      And shining nymphs stand still a while,      Or mix the mass with salt and oil,        With sage and savory leaves.        Then sextonlike, the patriot troop,        With naked arms and crown,      Embraced, with hardy hands, the scoop,      And filled the vast expanded hoop,        While beetles smacked it down.        Next girding screws the ponderous beam,        With heft immense, drew down;      The gushing whey from every seam      Flowed through the streets a rapid stream,        And shad came up to town.    This spirited achievement of early democracy is commemorated today by  a sign set up at the ancient and honorable town of Cheshire, located  between Pittsfield and North Adams, on Route 8.    Jefferson's speech of thanks to the democratic people of Cheshire  rings out in history: \"I look upon this cheese as a token of fidelity  from the very heart of the people of this land to the great cause of  equal rights to all men.\"    This popular presentation started a tradition. When Van Buren  succeeded to the Presidency, he received a similar mammoth cheese in  token of the high esteem in which he was held. A monstrous one, bigger  than the Jeffersonian, was made by New Englanders to show their  loyalty to President Jackson. For weeks this stood in state in the  hall of the White House. At last the floor was a foot deep in the  fragments remaining after the enthusiastic Democrats had eaten their  fill.          [Illustration]    _Chapter Three_    Foreign Greats            _Ode to Cheese_          God of the country, bless today Thy cheese,      For which we give Thee thanks on bended knees.      Let them be fat or light, with onions blent,      Shallots, brine, pepper, honey; whether scent      Of sheep or fields is in them, in the yard      Let them, good Lord, at dawn be beaten hard.      And let their edges take on silvery shades      Under the moist red hands of dairymaids;      And, round and greenish, let them go to town      Weighing the shepherd's folding mantle down;      Whether from Parma or from Jura heights,      Kneaded by august hands of Carmelites,      Stamped with the mitre of a proud abbess.      Flowered with the perfumes of the grass of Bresse,      From hollow Holland, from the Vosges, from Brie,      From Roquefort, Gorgonzola, Italy!      Bless them, good Lord! Bless Stilton's royal fare,      Red Cheshire, and the tearful cream Gruyere.        FROM JETHRO BITHELL'S TRANSLATION      OF A POEM BY M. Thomas Braun         _Symphonie des Fromages_         A giant Cantal, seeming to have been chopped open with an ax,       stood aside of a golden-hued Chester and a Swiss Gruyere       resembling the wheel of a Roman chariot There were Dutch Edams,       round and blood-red, and Port-Saluts lined up like soldiers on       parade. Three Bries, side by side, suggested phases of the moon;       two of them, very dry, were amber-colored and \"full,\" and the       third, in its second quarter, was runny and creamy, with a \"milky       way\" which no human barrier seemed able to restrain. And all the       while majestic Roqueforts looked down with princely contempt upon       the other, through the glass of their crystal covers.         Emile Zola    In 1953 the United States Department of Agriculture published Handbook  No. 54, entitled _Cheese Varieties and Descriptions,_ with this  comment: \"There probably are only about eighteen distinct types or  kinds of natural cheese.\" All the rest (more than 400 names) are of  local origin, usually named after towns or communities. A list of the  best-known names applied to each of these distinct varieties or groups  is given:            Brick        Gouda         Romano          Camembert    Hand          Roquefort          Cheddar      Limburger     Sapsago          Cottage      Neufchatel    Swiss          Cream        Parmesan      Trappist          Edam         Provolone     Whey cheeses (Mysost and Ricotta)      May we nominate another dozen to form our own Cheese Hall of Fame? We  begin our list with a partial roll call of the big Blues family and  end it with members of the monastic order of Port-Salut Trappist that  includes Canadian Oka and our own Kentucky thoroughbred.      The Blues that Are Green    Stilton, Roquefort and Gorgonzola form the triumvirate that rules a  world of lesser Blues. They are actually green, as green as the  mythical cheese the moon is made of.    In almost every, land where cheese is made you can sample a handful of  lesser Blues and imitations of the invincible three and try to  classify them, until you're blue in the face. The best we can do in  this slight summary is to mention a few of the most notable, aside  from our own Blues of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Oregon and other states  that major in cheese.    Danish Blues are popular and splendidly made, such as \"Flower of  Denmark.\" The Argentine competes with a pampas-grass Blue all its own.  But France and England are the leaders in this line, France first with  a sort of triple triumvirate within a triumvirate--Septmoncel, Gex,  and Sassenage, all three made with three milks mixed together: cow,  goat and sheep. Septmoncel is the leader of these, made in the Jura  mountains and considered by many French caseophiles to outrank  Roquefort.    This class of Blue or marbled cheese is called fromage persille, as  well as fromage bleu and pate bleue. Similar mountain cheeses are made  in Auvergne and Aubrac and have distinct qualities that have brought  them fame, such as Cantal, bleu d'Auvergne Guiole or Laguiole, bleu de  Salers, and St. Flour. Olivet and Queville come within the color  scheme, and sundry others such as Champoleon, Journiac, Queyras and  Sarraz.    Of English Blues there are several celebrities beside Stilton and  Cheshire Stilton. Wensleydale was one in the early days, and still  is, together with Blue Dorset, the deepest green of them all, and  esoteric Blue Vinny, a choosey cheese not liked by everybody, the  favorite of Thomas Hardy.      Brie    Sheila Hibben once wrote in _The New Yorker:_    I can't imagine any difference of opinion about Brie's being the queen  of all cheeses, and if there is any such difference, I shall certainly  ignore it. The very shape of Brie--so uncheese-like and so charmingly  fragile--is exciting. Nine times out of ten a Brie will let you  down--will be all caked into layers, which shows it is too young, or  at the over-runny stage, which means it is too old--but when you come  on the tenth Brie, _coulant_ to just the right, delicate creaminess,  and the color of fresh, sweet butter, no other cheese can compare with  it.    The season of Brie, like that of oysters, is simple to remember: only  months with an \"R,\" beginning with September, which is the best, bar  none.      Caciocavallo    From Bulgaria to Turkey the Italian \"horse cheese,\" as Caciocavallo  translates, is as universally popular as it is at home and in all the  Little Italics throughout the rest of the world. Flattering imitations  are made and named after it, as follows:        BULGARIA:       Kascaval        GREECE:         Kashcavallo and Caskcaval        HUNGARY:        Parenica        RUMANIA:        Pentele and Kascaval        SERBIA:         Katschkawalj        SYRIA:          Cashkavallo        TRANSYLVANIA:   Kascaval (as in Rumania)        TURKEY:         Cascaval Penir        YUGOSLAVIA:     Kackavalj    A horse's head printed on the cheese gave rise to its popular name and  to the myth that it is made of mare's milk. It is, however, curded  from cow's milk, whole or partly skimmed, and sometimes from water  buffalo; hard, yellow and so buttery that the best of it, which comes  from Sorrento, is called _Cacio burro,_ butter cheese. Slightly salty,  with a spicy tang, it is eaten sliced when young and mild and used for  grating and seasoning when old, not only on the usual Italian pastes  but on sweets.    Different from the many grating cheeses made from little balls of curd  called _grana_, Caciocavallo is a _pasta fileta_, or drawn-curd  product. Because of this it is sometimes drawn out in long thick  threads and braided. It is a cheese for skilled artists to make  sculptures with, sometimes horses' heads, again bunches of grapes and  other fruits, even as Provolone is shaped like apples and pears and  often worked into elaborate bas-relief designs. But ordinarily the  horse's head is a plain tenpin in shape or a squat bottle with a knob  on the side by which it has been tied up, two cheeses at a time, on  opposite sides of a rafter, while being smoked lightly golden and  rubbed with olive oil and butter to make it all the more buttery.    In Calabria and Sicily it is very popular, and although the best comes  from Sorrento, there is keen competition from Abruzzi, Apulian  Province and Molise. It keeps well and doesn't spoil when shipped  overseas.    In his _Little Book of Cheese_ Osbert Burdett recommends the high,  horsy strength of this smoked Cacio over tobacco smoke after dinner:         Only monsters smoke at meals, but a monster assured me that       Gorgonzola best survives this malpractice. Clearly, some pungency       is necessary, and confidence suggests rather Cacio which would       survive anything, the monster said.    Camembert    Camembert is called \"mold-matured\" and all that is genuine is labeled  _Syndicat du Vrai Camembert_.

Santa Cruz, the port town of Teneriffe, like La Guayra, rises at the  base of great hills. It is a smiling, bright-colored, red-roofed,  typical Spanish town. The hills about it mount in innumerable  terraces planted with fruits and vegetables, and from many of these  houses on the hills, should the owner step hurriedly out of his  front door, he would land upon the roof of his nearest neighbor.  Back of this first chain of hills are broad farming lands and  plateaus from which Barcelona and London are fed with the earliest  and the most tender of potatoes that appear in England at the same  time Bermuda potatoes are being printed in big letters on the bills  of fare along Broadway. Santa Cruz itself supplies passing steamers  with coal, and passengers with lace work and post cards; and to the  English in search of sunshine, with a rival to Madeira. It should be  a successful rival, for it is a charming place, and on the day we  were there the thermometer was at 72 deg., and every one was complaining  of the cruel severity of the winter. In Santa Cruz one who knows  Spanish America has but to shut his eyes and imagine himself back in  Santiago de Cuba or Caracas. There are the same charming plazas, the  yellow churches and towered cathedral, the long iron-barred windows,  glimpses through marble-paved halls of cool patios, the same open  shops one finds in Obispo and O'Reilly Streets, the idle officers  with smart uniforms and swinging swords in front of cafes killing  time and digestion with sweet drinks, and over the garden walls  great bunches of purple and scarlet flowers and sheltering palms.  The show place in Santa Cruz is the church in which are stored the  relics of the sea-fight in which, as a young man, Nelson lost his  arm and England also lost two battleflags. As she is not often  careless in that respect, it is a surprise to find, in this tiny  tucked-away little island, what you will not see in any of the show  places of the world. They tell in Santa Cruz that one night an  English middy, single-handed, recaptured the captured flags and  carried them triumphantly to his battleship. He expected at the  least a K.C.B., and when the flags, with a squad of British marines  as a guard of honor, were solemnly replaced in the church, and the  middy himself was sent upon a tour of apology to the bishop, the  governor, the commandant of the fortress, the alcalde, the collector  of customs, and the captain of the port, he declared that monarchies  were ungrateful. The other objects of interest in Teneriffe are  camels, which in the interior of the island are common beasts of  burden, and which appearing suddenly around a turn would frighten  any automobile; and the fact that in Teneriffe the fashion in  women's hats never changes. They are very funny, flat straw hats;  like children's sailor hats. They need only \"_U.S.S. Iowa_\" on the  band to be quite familiar. Their secret is that they are built to  support baskets and buckets of water, and that concealed in each is  a heavy pad.     [Illustration: Mrs. Davis in a Borrowed \"Hammock,\" the Local Means   of Transport on the West Coast.]    After Teneriffe the destination of every one on board is as  irrevocably fixed as though the ship were a government transport. We  are all going to the West Coast or to the Congo. Should you wish to  continue on to Cape Town along the South Coast, as they call the  vast territory from Lagos to Cape Town, although there is an  irregular, a very irregular, service to the Cape, you could as  quickly reach it by going on to the Congo, returning all the way to  Southampton, and again starting on the direct line south.    It is as though a line of steamers running down our coast to Florida  would not continue on along the South Coast to New Orleans and  Galveston, and as though no line of steamers came from New Orleans  and Galveston to meet the steamers of the East Coast.    In consequence, the West Coast of Africa, cut off by lack of  communication from the south, divorced from the north by the Desert  of Sahara, lies in the steaming heat of the Equator to-day as it  did a thousand years ago, in inaccessible, inhospitable isolation.    Two elements have helped to preserve this isolation: the fever that  rises from its swamps and lagoons, and the surf that thunders upon  the shore. In considering the stunted development of the West Coast,  these two elements must be kept in mind--the sickness that strikes  at sunset and by sunrise leaves the victim dead, and the monster  waves that rush booming like cannon at the beach, churning the sandy  bottom beneath, and hurling aside the great canoes as a man tosses a  cigarette. The clerk who signs the three-year contract to work on  the West Coast enlists against a greater chance of death than the  soldier who enlists to fight only bullets; and every box, puncheon,  or barrel that the trader sends in a canoe through the surf is  insured against its never reaching, as the case may be, the shore or  the ship's side.    The surf and the fever are the Minotaurs of the West Coast, and in  the year there is not a day passes that they do not claim and  receive their tribute in merchandise and human life. Said an old  Coaster to me, pointing at the harbor of Grand Bassam: \"I've seen  just as much cargo lost overboard in that surf as I've seen shipped  to Europe.\" One constantly wonders how the Coasters find it good  enough. How, since 1550, when the Portuguese began trading, it has  been possible to find men willing to fill the places of those who  died. But, in spite of the early massacres by the natives, in spite  of attacks by wild beasts, in spite of pirate raids, of desolating  plagues and epidemics, of wars with other white men, of damp heat  and sudden sickness, there were men who patiently rebuilt the forts  and factories, fought the surf with great breakwaters, cleared  breathing spaces in the jungle, and with the aid of quinine for  themselves, and bad gin for the natives, have held their own. Except  for the trade goods it never would be held. It is a country where  the pay is cruelly inadequate, where but few horses, sheep, or  cattle can exist, where the natives are unbelievably lazy and  insolent, and where, while there is no society of congenial spirits,  there is a superabundance of animal and insect pests. Still, so  great are gold, ivory, and rubber, and so many are the men who will  take big chances for little pay, that every foot of the West Coast  is preempted. As the ship rolls along, for hours from the rail you  see miles and miles of steaming yellow sand and misty swamp where as  yet no white man has set his foot. But in the real estate office of  Europe some Power claims the right to \"protect\" that swamp; some  treaty is filed as a title-deed.    As the Powers finally arranged it, the map of the West Coast is like  a mosaic, like the edge of a badly constructed patchwork quilt. In  trading along the West Coast a man can find use for five European  languages, and he can use a new one at each port of call.    To the north, the West Coast begins with Cape Verde, which is  Spanish. It is followed by Senegal, which is French; but into  Senegal is tucked \"a thin red line\" of British territory called  Gambia. Senegal closes in again around Gambia, and is at once  blocked to the south by the three-cornered patch which belongs to  Portugal. This is followed by French Guinea down to another British  red spot, Sierra Leone, which meets Liberia, the republic of negro  emigrants from the United States. South of Liberia is the French  Ivory Coast, then the English Gold Coast; Togo, which is German;  Dahomey, which is French; Lagos and Southern Nigeria, which again  are English; Fernando Po, which is Spanish, and the German  Cameroons.    The coast line of these protectorates and colonies gives no idea of  the extent of their hinterland, which spreads back into the Sahara,  the Niger basin, and the Soudan. Sierra Leone, one of the smallest  of them, is as large as Maine; Liberia, where the emigrants still  keep up the tradition of the United States by talking like end men,  is as large as the State of New York; two other colonies, Senegal  and Nigeria, together are 135,000 square miles larger than the  combined square miles of all of our Atlantic States from Maine to  Florida and including both. To partition finally among the Powers  this strip of death and disease, of uncountable wealth, of unnamed  horrors and cruelties, has taken many hundreds of years, has brought  to the black man every misery that can be inflicted upon a human  being, and to thousands of white men, death and degradation, or  great wealth.    The raids made upon the West Coast to obtain slaves began in the  fifteenth century with the discovery of the West Indies, and it was  to spare the natives of these islands, who were unused and unfitted  for manual labor and who in consequence were cruelly treated by the  Spaniards, that Las Casas, the Bishop of Chiapa, first imported  slaves from West Africa. He lived to see them suffer so much more  terribly than had the Indians who first obtained his sympathy, that  even to his eightieth year he pleaded with the Pope and the King of  Spain to undo the wrong he had begun. But the tide had set west, and  Las Casas might as well have tried to stop the Trades. In 1800  Wilberforce stated in the House of Commons that at that time British  vessels were carrying each year to the Indies and the American  colonies 38,000 slaves, and when he spoke the traffic had been going  on for two hundred and fifty years. After the Treaty of Utrecht,  Queen Anne congratulated her Peers on the terms of the treaty which  gave to England \"the fortress of Gibraltar, the Island of Minorca,  and the monopoly in the slave trade for thirty years,\" or, as it was  called, the _asiento_ (contract). This was considered so good an  investment that Philip V of Spain took up"]]]
