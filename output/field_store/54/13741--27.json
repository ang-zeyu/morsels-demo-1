Women also were treated with equal  severity and all manner of mutilations were practised. Such atrocities  have of course been suppressed by the Congo Free State.    Having reached Southampton, we went on board the S.S. _Leopoldville_, a  ship of about 5,000 tons burden, very clean and well-found. She belongs  to the _Compagnie maritime belge_ which runs a ship every third week  from Antwerp and Southampton to Boma and Matadi. We sailed about 2 p.m.  and a savoury smell from the galley reminded us that it was about seven  hours since we had breakfasted.    Some of the passengers were English military officers and miners bound  for the Gold Coast, but most were evidently officials of the Congo Free  State. The conversation soon turned upon the agitation in Europe against  the Congo Government, and it was extraordinary with what sorrowful  indignation the various charges were refuted. This impressed me greatly  at the time for it was in marked contrast with the indifference shown by  an average Englishmen when his country and methods are abused by  foreigners. Probably the explanation is, that we are so used to  unmerited abuse, that we regard it as part of the normal order of  things. The Congo State on the other hand, has only recently become  sufficiently prosperous to attract attention.    One of the passengers dressed as a Catholic Priest, proved a veritable  mine of information. This was Mgr. Derikx, Prefet Apostolique of Uele in  the Upper Congo. He had had five years' experience of the country and  was well versed in all its institutions and ways. Another was a young  military officer, M. Arnold, already of the rank of Commandant, for he  had shown distinguished service in the field--or rather the forest--and  also as an administrator at a State Post. There were also many other  officials, soldiers, lawyers and commercial agents on board.    I determined therefore, to read the various books and reports written  against the Congo--whether the writers had ever been in the country or  not--then to question the officials who had worked there, and finally to  see the actual condition of affairs for myself.    We tumbled about in The Bay of Biscay a little and the motion did not  much aid the digestion of the contents of histories and blue and white  books. A welcome break was therefore made when we reached Teneriffe on  June 29th. It is early afternoon and the view of Santa Crus from the sea  is very beautiful. In the foreground is ultra-marine coloured water; on  shore, bright yellow houses with red roofs dotted among palms and other  foliage of vivid green, and behind all, frowns the great grey mountain  12,000 feet high. The hills stretching up from the sea are in many cases  terraced for gardens and vineyards and a new hotel stands out  prominently on one side. It is a glorious picture, but if the eye is  delighted as the boat approaches the shore, the nose is offended  immediately on landing. Streets, houses and people near the harbour are  dirty and odoriferous and as the shops are all shut for a saint's day,  the town looks dismal in spite of the bright sun.    After changing some money at the shop of a jew who gave us the wrong  amount and looked injured when we insisted upon the right, we took an  open carriage and drove to the Cathedral. The building is not imposing  from the outside, but is highly gilded within where is the famous Holy  Cross which gives the town its name. There are also many wax figures  representing saints, mostly dressed in the costume of the seventeenth  century and enclosed in glass cases. The boy who acted as our guide  having discovered our nationality, pointed out with great glee _English  organ_, _English clock_. and finally with satirical humour--probably  unconscious--_English flags_. These flags are those lost by Nelson at  the siege of Santa Crus where he lost his arm and a good story is told  about them. An ambitious British middy stole them from the Cathedral and  was very disappointed, when instead of being at once promoted, he was  forced to apologize and restore them.    We next drive up a broad, fairly well kept, boulevard to the Bull Ring  situated in an open space behind the town. A woman conducts us into the  ring and shows us the stables in which the infuriated beasts are kept  before they are asked to shed their blood for the idle amusement of the  spectators. On the walls are many names which look like British, and the  guide is quite astonished when we refuse to add ours to their number.    Commandant Arnold here takes on board six camels, for it is hoped these  ships of the desert will also sail equally well in the forest. The  experiment is at any rate not expensive, for they only cost L16 each and  will carry several hundred pounds weight of baggage.    From time to time the Congo Government has been charged with forcing the  natives to work against their will and with ill-treating them, and it  has also been alleged that the native soldiers committed many atrocities  during the wars against the revolting tribes. Many of these charges have  been collected and published in _Civilisation in Congoland_ written by  Mr. H.R. Fox-Bourne, the Secretary of the Aborigines Protection Society.  The author has not travelled in the country himself, but relies chiefly  upon the evidence of the late Mr. Edward Glave, at one time an official  of the Congo International Association, and of the late Mr. Sjoeblom who  was a Swedish Missionary in the Congo. The book is not cheerful reading,  for indeed it is chiefly a record of crimes which have been committed in  the past.    It has been frequently stated that acting under the orders, or at least  with the connivance of the agents of the Congo State and those of the  Commercial Companies in the country, the native police or sentries have  punished in a most barbarous manner all those natives who refused to  work. It is alleged indeed, that these sentries have actually cut off  the hands of those who did not collect the rubber or food-stuff demanded  by the agents. To even read of such sickening horrors is terrible, and I  was therefore much relieved to find that none of the State officials on  board had ever seen natives maimed in that or any other manner by the  soldiers of the State. There seems however, to be no doubt that the  native chiefs in the past mutilated both the living and dead as  punishment for crime. Mgr. Derikx told me that he had heard of a case  where a chief had ordered that the hand of his own son should be cut off  because he had committed adultery with one of his numerous wives.    We arrived at Dakar, the capital of the French colony of Senegambia, at  daylight on July 3rd. Navigation is not easy here, for a reef runs  parallel to the coast and the channel between, is neither broad nor  deep. The town is built on the shores of a bay and faces an island  strongly fortified. The whole colony is being rapidly developed; a  railway runs to St. Louis and roads are being constructed across the  desert towards Timbuctoo and the northern coasts. A flourishing  industry in palm oil is carried on and Dakar is also an important  military centre. Several of the officers however, were engaged in the  peaceful pursuit of fishing at the end of the breakwater when we  arrived.    At Dakar, Commandant and Madame Sillye come on board. The former has  served for ten years in the Congo and is now taking out ten horses  purchased in Senegambia, from which he hopes to breed. They are a fine  looking set, very quiet and well behaved, and take up their quarters  opposite the camels without creating any disturbance. We have now quite  a menagerie on board. Besides the camels and horses, there are pigeons  to be trained as carriers, guinea pigs with which the doctors  investigating the terrible disease the Sleeping Sickness, will  experiment and several dogs belonging to the passengers. Various kinds  of rubber and other living plants also occupy an appreciable part of the  promenade deck. Passengers and cargo indeed, are strong evidence of the  earnest way in which the Congo is being developed.    It is necessary now to turn from the actual visual facts and to study  the statements of others. While doing so however, we must bear in mind  the main outlines of the history of the Congo Free State. The opening up  of the Congo was entirely due to the initiative of King Leopold of  Belgium aided by the explorations of the late Sir H.M. Stanley. In 1878,  after Stanley's first descent of the Congo, a society of philanthropists  was formed called the _Comite d'etudes du Haut-Congo_ but this was  changed in 1882 to the _Association Internationale du Congo_. Stanley  and a French officer, M. de Brazza, then both worked up from the coast  at the same time and the former reached Lake Leopold on June 1st 1882,  while the latter concluded treaties with the Chiefs on the north bank of  the river and founded the French Congo.    The International Association of the Congo at once organised itself into  an Independent State and on April 22nd 1884 a Declaration was made by  the Government of the United States of America that it recognized the  flag of the International Association as that of a friendly Government.  At the end of 1884 and the beginning of 1885, Conventions were arranged  between the Governments of Austria, Germany, Great Britain, Belgium,  Denmark, Spain, France, Italy, Holland, Portugal, Russia and Sweden and  Norway and the International Association of the Congo in which all those  countries recognised the flag of the International Association as that  of a friendly Government. It is therefore clear that the chief Powers of  the World regarded the Association as an Independent State and  negotiated with it as such.    At the same time the Powers of Europe were annexing various parts of  Africa, and with the idea of regulating in a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15250"],[0,"Myths and Legends of China (#2)"],[1," Hindu Kush. That  brings us somewhat nearer to Babylon, and the apparent convergence  of the two theories, the Central Asian and the Western Asian, would  seem to point to a possible solution of the problem. Nue Kua, one of  the alleged creators of human beings, and Nue and Kua, the first two  human beings (according to a variation of the legend), are placed  in the K'un-lun Mountains. That looks hopeful. Unfortunately, the  K'un-lun legend is proved to be of Taoist origin. K'un-lun is the  central mountain of the world, and 3000 miles in height. There is  the fountain of immortality, and thence flow the four great rivers  of the world. In other words, it is the Sumeru of Hindu mythology  transplanted into Chinese legend, and for our present purpose without  historical value.    It would take up too much space to go into details of this interesting  problem of the origin of the Chinese and their civilization, the  cultural connexions or similarities of China and Western Asia in  pre-Babylonian times, the origin of the two distinct culture-areas  so marked throughout the greater part of Chinese history, etc., and  it will be sufficient for our present purpose to state the conclusion  to which the evidence points.      Provisional Conclusion    Pending the discovery of decisive evidence, the following provisional  conclusion has much to recommend it--namely, that the ancestors  of the Chinese people came from the west, from Akkadia or Elam,  or from Khotan, or (more probably) from Akkadia or Elam _via_  Khotan, as one nomad or pastoral tribe or group of nomad or pastoral  tribes, or as successive waves of immigrants, reached what is now  China Proper at its north-west corner, settled round the elbow of  the Yellow River, spread north-eastward, eastward, and southward,  conquering, absorbing, or pushing before them the aborigines into  what is now South and South-west China. These aboriginal races, who  represent a wave or waves of neolithic immigrants from Western Asia  earlier than the relatively high-headed immigrants into North China  (who arrived about the twenty-fifth or twenty-fourth century B.C.),  and who have left so deep an impress on the Japanese, mixed and  intermarried with the Chinese in the south, eventually producing the  pronounced differences, in physical, mental, and emotional traits,  in sentiments, ideas, languages, processes, and products, from the  Northern Chinese which are so conspicuous at the present day.        Inorganic Environment    At the beginning of their known history the country occupied by the  Chinese was the comparatively small region above mentioned. It was  then a tract of an irregular oblong shape, lying between latitude 34 deg.  and 40 deg. N. and longitude 107 deg. and 114 deg. E. This territory round the  elbow of the Yellow River had an area of about 50,000 square miles,  and was gradually extended to the sea-coast on the north-east as far as  longitude 119 deg., when its area was about doubled. It had a population of  perhaps a million, increasing with the expansion to two millions. This  may be called infant China. Its period (the Feudal Period) was in  the two thousand years between the twenty-fourth and third centuries  B.C. During the first centuries of the Monarchical Period, which lasted  from 221 B.C. to A.D. 1912, it had expanded to the south to such an  extent that it included all of the Eighteen Provinces constituting  what is known as China Proper of modern times, with the exception of  a portion of the west of Kansu and the greater portions of Ssuch'uan  and Yuennan. At the time of the Manchu conquest at the beginning of the  seventeenth century A.D. it embraced all the territory lying between  latitude 18 deg. and 40 deg. N. and longitude 98 deg. and 122 deg. E. (the Eighteen  Provinces or China Proper), with the addition of the vast outlying  territories of Manchuria, Mongolia, Ili, Koko-nor, Tibet, and Corea,  with suzerainty over Burma and Annam--an area of more than 5,000,000  square miles, including the 2,000,000 square miles covered by the  Eighteen Provinces. Generally, this territory is mountainous in the  west, sloping gradually down toward the sea on the east. It contains  three chief ranges of mountains and large alluvial plains in the north,  east, and south. Three great and about thirty large rivers intersect  the country, their numerous tributaries reaching every part of it.    As regards geological features, the great alluvial plains rest upon  granite, new red sandstone, or limestone. In the north is found the  peculiar loess formation, having its origin probably in the accumulated  dust of ages blown from the Mongolian plateau. The passage from north  to south is generally from the older to the newer rocks; from east to  west a similar series is found, with some volcanic features in the  west and south. Coal and iron are the chief minerals, gold, silver,  copper, lead, tin, jade, etc., being also mined.    The climate of this vast area is not uniform. In the north the winter  is long and rigorous, the summer hot and dry, with a short rainy season  in July and August; in the south the summer is long, hot, and moist,  the winter short. The mean temperature is 50.3 deg. F. and 70 deg. F. in the  north and south respectively. Generally, the thermometer is low for  the latitude, though perhaps it is more correct to say that the Gulf  Stream raises the temperature of the west coast of Europe above the  average. The mean rainfall in the north is 16, in the south 70 inches,  with variations in other parts. Typhoons blow in the south between  July and October.      Organic Environment    The vegetal productions are abundant and most varied. The rice-zone  (significant in relation to the cultural distinctions above noted)  embraces the southern half of the country. Tea, first cultivated  for its infusion in A.D. 350, is grown in the southern and central  provinces between the twenty-third and thirty-fifth degrees of  latitude, though it is also found as far north as Shantung, the chief  'tea district,' however, being the large area south of the Yangtzu  River, east of the Tungting Lake and great Siang River, and north of  the Kuangtung Province. The other chief vegetal products are wheat,  barley, maize, millet, the bean, yam, sweet and common potato, tomato,  eggplant, ginseng, cabbage, bamboo, indigo, pepper, tobacco, camphor,  tallow, ground-nut, poppy, water-melon, sugar, cotton, hemp, and  silk. Among the fruits grown are the date, mulberry, orange, lemon,  pumelo, persimmon, lichi, pomegranate, pineapple, fig, coconut, mango,  and banana, besides the usual kinds common in Western countries.    The wild animals include the tiger, panther, leopard, bear, sable,  otter, monkey, wolf, fox, twenty-seven or more species of ruminants,  and numerous species of rodents. The rhinoceros, elephant, and tapir  still exist in Yuennan. The domestic animals include the camel and the  water-buffalo. There are about 700 species of birds, and innumerable  species of fishes and insects.      Sociological Environment    On their arrival in what is now known as China the Chinese, as already  noted, fought with the aboriginal tribes. The latter were exterminated,  absorbed, or driven south with the spread of Chinese rule. The Chinese  \"picked out the eyes of the land,\" and consequently the non-Chinese  tribes now live in the unhealthy forests or marshes of the south,  or in mountain regions difficult of access, some even in trees (a  voluntary, not compulsory promotion), though several, such as the Dog  Jung in Fukien, retain settlements like islands among the ruling race.    In the third century B.C. began the hostile relations of the Chinese  with the northern nomads, which continued throughout the greater  part of their history. During the first six centuries A.D. there was  intercourse with Rome, Parthia, Turkey, Mesopotamia, Ceylon, India,  and Indo-China, and in the seventh century with the Arabs. Europe  was brought within the sociological environment by Christian  travellers. From the tenth to the thirteenth century the north  was occupied by Kitans and Nuechens, and the whole Empire was under  Mongol sway for eighty-eight years in the thirteenth and fourteenth  centuries. Relations of a commercial and religious nature were held  with neighbours during the following four hundred years. Regular  diplomatic intercourse with Western nations was established as a result  of a series of wars in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Until  recently the nation held aloof from alliances and was generally averse  to foreign intercourse. From 1537 onward, as a sequel of war or treaty,  concessions, settlements, etc., were obtained by foreign Powers. China  has now lost some of her border countries and large adjacent islands,  the military and commercial pressure of Western nations and Japan  having taken the place of the military pressure of the Tartars already  referred to. The great problem for her, an agricultural nation, is  how to find means and the military spirit to maintain her integrity,  the further violation of which could not but be regarded by the student  of sociological history as a great tragedy and a world-wide calamity.      Physical, Emotional, and Intellectual Characters    The physical characters of the Chinese are too well known to need  detailed recital. The original immigrants into North China all  belonged to blond races, but the modern Chinese have little left of  the immigrant stock. The oblique, almond-shaped eyes, with black iris  and the orbits far apart, have a vertical fold of skin over the inner  canthus, concealing a part of the iris, a peculiarity distinguishing  the eastern races of Asia from all other families of man. The stature  and weight of brain are generally below the average. The hair is black,  coarse, and cylindrical; the beard scanty or absent. The colour of  the skin is darker in the south than in the north."]]]
