The jump has been from the 7 in. rifle as the  largest piece to the 110 ton Armstrong; in armor, from 41/2 in. of iron to  the Inflexible with 22 in. of steel plating. The new Armstrong gun of 110  tons, tried only recently, with 850 pounds of powder and an 1,800 pound  shot can pierce all the targets, and so far guns have the victory over  armor. This gun developed 57,000 foot tons of energy, and will probably  reach 62,000. Imagine the Egyptian needle in Central Park, shod on its apex  with hard steel, dropped point downward from the height of Trinity steeple;  it weighs 225 tons, and it would strike with just about the effect of one  of the 110 ton gun's projectiles. Two of these guns are ready for the  ironclad Benbow, and the Italians have several equally powerful of 119 tons  from Herr Krupp. The most powerful gun in the United States, the 15 in. or  the 12 in. rifle, has a muzzle energy of 3,800 foot tons.    Ships like the Inflexible are the most powerful afloat. A steel water-tight  deck extends across the ship, and she has 135 water-tight compartments. Her  guns and engines amidships have a protection of 24 in. of armor, and  amidships she has a citadel carrying two revolving turrets, each containing  two 80 ton guns. Her turret armor is 18 in. thick. She can make 14 knots,  and she has cost $3,500,000. But she has a low freeboard, and the guns,  therefore, get no plunging fire.    The French ship Meta has her heaviest guns mounted _en barbette_, high  above the water line, giving a splendid plunging fire.    Either of these ships could enter any of our harbors and hold us at her  mercy.    The entrance to the harbor of Alexandria, Egypt, is about 5 miles across.  At the time of the bombardment the protecting fortifications were situated  at the east end, in the center, and at the west end. On the west there were  mounted 20 modern guns of great size and power, and there were 7 others at  the east end.    Although the Egyptians fought bravely, they did very little harm to the  English fleet, while on the second day the defense was silenced altogether.  Following the bombardment--as in Paris--came the reign of mob law, doing  more harm than the shells had done; and it is a possibility that every such  bombardment would be followed by such an overthrow--at least temporary--of  all forms of law and order.    The ships that had silenced the Alexandria batteries--which had 27 heavy  guns more than we have--could reach our coasts in 10 or 12 days, and we  would have nothing to meet them.    Armor-clad casemates are beginning to take the place of masonry. A  tremendous thickness of masonry is built up to the very embrasures for the  guns in the steel-clad turrets. This (the Gruson) system has been adopted  by Belgium, Holland, Germany, Austria, and Italy.    In 1882 England had 434 heavy modern guns behind armored shore batteries;  besides these at home, she had 92 in her colonies, of which 13 were in  Halifax and 11 in Bermuda--for our express benefit.    What we have are brick and stone casemates and earthworks. A sample granite  casemate, with iron-lined embrasure, was built at Fortress Monroe, and 8  shots were fired at it from a 12 in. rifle converted from an old 15 in.  smooth bore. This gun develops only 3,800 foot tons of energy--a mere  nothing compared with the 62,000 foot tons of the English and German 110  ton guns.    General Abbott showed most conclusive proof of the worthlessness of masonry  forts in pictures showing the effect of the shots. The massive 8 feet  thickness of granite was pierced and battered till it looked like a ruin.  Not a man inside would have been left alive.    He also showed a \"disappearing\" gun in an earthwork, the gun recoiling  below the level of the parapet and being run up to a firing position by a  counterweight. In 1878 Congress stopped all appropriations for defenses,  and nothing had been done since.    General Abbott said that we needed submarine mines or fixed torpedoes,  which should be thickly interspersed about the channel and be exploded by  an electric battery on shore. To prevent these torpedoes from being  exploded by the enemy, the surface over them should be covered by plenty of  guns. Heavy guns and mortars were needed to resist attacks by heavy  iron-clads. Movable torpedoes were valuable, but only as an auxiliary--a  very minor auxiliary--compared with submarine mines. We should be cautious  not to infer that torpedoes made a satisfactory defense alone, as they must  be protected by large and small guns, and they form only a part of the  chain of general defenses.           *       *       *       *       *          THE STEAMSHIP GREAT EASTERN.    [Footnote: See Engraving in SUPPLEMENT NO. 584.]      The history of the Great Eastern is full of surprises. It is always that  which is most unlikely to happen to her which occurs. Not long since we  recorded her sale by auction in Liverpool for L26,000. It was stated that  her purchasers were going to fit her out for the Australian trade, and that  she would at once be sent from Dublin to Glasgow to be fitted with new  engines and boilers, and to undergo thorough renovation. Lord Ravensworth,  in his address to the Institution of Naval Architects, spoke recently of  the bright future before her in that Australian trade for which she was  specially built. Yet at this moment the Great Eastern is lying in her old  berth in the Sloyne at Liverpool, and unless something else at present  quite unforeseen takes place, she will once more play the undignified part  of a floating music hall. It seems that although she was certainly sold, as  we have stated, the transaction was not completed. Her owners then cast  about for the next highest bidder, who at once took her. He is, we  understand, a Manchester cotton spinner, and he paid L25,500 for her. It is  no secret that Messrs. Lewis made a considerable sum out of the ship last  year, and the knowledge of this fact has no doubt induced her present owner  to follow their example. The ship left Dublin on Sunday, April 3, under her  own steam and in tow of two Liverpool tugs, the Brilliant Star and the  Wrestler, and arrived in the Mersey without accident on Monday, after a  passage of only thirteen hours. Mr. Reeves, formerly her chief officer, has  been made captain. Mr. Jackson is still chief engineer. We cannot at  present explain the fact that she went more than twice as fast as she has  done recently, her engines making as many as 36 revolutions a minute, save  on the assumption that while lying at Dublin much of the enormous growth of  seaweed on her bottom died off, as will sometimes happen as a result of  change of water. Her engines and boilers, too, have had a good overhaul by  Mr. Jackson, and this may account in part for this improvement. It is much  to be regretted that the scheme of using the ship for her legitimate  purpose has not been carried out. It is not, however, yet too late. The  Great Eastern was not a success in Dublin, for one reason, that a beer and  spirit license could not be obtained for her. It is said that notice has  been given at the Birkenhead police court that any application for a  license of a similar kind will be opposed. Whether the ship will be as  popular a resort without as she was with a license, we cannot pretend to  say; and we may add that all our predilections are against her degradation  to the status of a floating music hall. The greater her failure as such,  the greater the chance of her being put to a better use; and it may help to  that desirable end if we say here something concerning the way in which she  could be rendered a commercial success as a trader.    It may be taken as proved that the present value of the ship is about  L26,000. Mr. De Mattos gave, we understand, L27,000 for her, and he bought  her by auction. The last sale gives nearly the same figures. If we assume  that there are 10,000 tons of iron in her, we may also assume that if  broken up it would not fetch more than L3 a ton at present rates; but even  if we say L4, we have as a total but L40,000. To break the ship up would be  a herculean task; we very much doubt if it could be done for the difference  between L26,000 and L40,000; her engines would only sell for old iron,  being entirely worthless for any other place than the foundry once they  were taken out of her; as for her boilers, the less said about them the  better. In one word, she would not pay to break up. On the other hand, by a  comparatively moderate further outlay, she might be made the finest trading  ship afloat. There are two harbors at all events into which she can always  get, namely, Milford and Sydney. There are others, of course, but these  will do; and the ship could trade between these two ports. By taking out  her paddle engines, she would be relieved of a weight of 850 tons. The  removal of her paddle engine boilers would further lighten her, and would  give in addition an enormous stowage space. By using her both as a cargo  and a passenger ship, the whole of the upper portion could be utilized for  emigrants, let us say, and the lower decks for cargo, of which she could  carry nearly, if not quite, 20,000 tons. She would possess the great  advantage that, notwithstanding she was a cargo ship, she would be nearly,  if not quite, as fast as any, save a few of the most recent additions to  the Australian fleet. There is every reason to believe that she has been  driven at 14 knots by about 6,000 horse power. We are inclined to think  that the power has been overstated, and we have it on good authority that  she has more than once attained a speed of 15 knots. Let us assume,  however, that her speed is to be 13 knots, or about fifteen miles an hour.  Assuming the power required to vary as the cube of the speed, if 6,000  horsepower gave 14 knots, then about 4,800 would give 13 knots--say 5,000  horse power. Now, good compound engines "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1167"],[0,"A Strange Disappearance (#2)"],[1,"way as though she were weighing something in her own  mind; but then her manner had been peculiar throughout. Whatever it was  that aroused my suspicion, I determined henceforth to keep a very sharp  eye upon her ladyship. Levelling a straight glance at her face, I asked  her how it was that she came to be the one to inform the authorities of  the girl's disappearance.    \"Doesn't Mr. Blake know anything about it?\"    The faintest shadow of a change came into her manner. \"Yes,\" said she,  \"I told him at breakfast time; but Mr. Blake doesn't take much interest  in his servants; he leaves all such matters to me.\"    \"Then he does not know you have come for the police?\"    \"No, sir, and O, if you would be so good as to keep it from him. It is  not necessary he should know. I shall let you in the back way. Mr. Blake  is a man who never meddles with anything, and--\"    \"What did Mr. Blake say this morning when you told him that this  girl--By the way, what is her name?\"    \"Emily.\"    \"That this girl, Emily, had disappeared during the night?\"    \"Not much of anything, sir. He was sitting at the breakfast table  reading his paper, he merely looked up, frowned a little in an  absent-minded way, and told me I must manage the servants' affairs  without troubling him.\"    \"And you let it drop?\"    \"Yes sir; Mr. Blake is not a man to speak twice to.\"    I could easily believe that from what I had seen of him in public, for  though by no means a harsh looking man, he had a reserved air which if  maintained in private must have made him very difficult of approach.    We were now within a half block or so of the old-fashioned mansion  regarded by this scion of New York's aristocracy as one of the most  desirable residences in the city; so motioning to the man who had  accompanied me to take his stand in a doorway near by and watch for  the signal I would give him in case I wanted Mr. Gryce, I turned to the  woman, who was now all in a flutter, and asked her how she proposed to  get me into the house without the knowledge of Mr. Blake.    \"O sir, all you have got to do is to follow me right up the back stairs;  he won't notice, or if he does will not ask any questions.\"    And having by this time reached the basement door, she took out a key  from her pocket and inserting it in the lock, at once admitted us into  the dwelling.        CHAPTER II. A FEW POINTS      Mrs. Daniels, for that was her name, took me at once up stairs to the  third story back room. As we passed through the halls, I could not but  notice how rich, though sombre were the old fashioned walls and heavily  frescoed ceilings, so different in style and coloring from what we see  now-a-days in our secret penetrations into Fifth Avenue mansions. Many  as are the wealthy houses I have been called upon to enter in the line  of my profession, I had never crossed the threshold of such an one as  this before, and impervious as I am to any foolish sentimentalities,  I felt a certain degree of awe at the thought of invading with police  investigation, this home of ancient Knicker-bocker respectability. But  once in the room of the missing girl, every consideration fled save that  of professional pride and curiosity. For almost at first blush, I saw  that whether Mrs. Daniels was correct or not in her surmises as to the  manner of the girl's disappearance, the fact that she had disappeared  was likely to prove an affair of some importance. For, let me state  the facts in the order in which I noticed them. The first thing that  impressed me was, that whatever Mrs. Daniels called her, this was no  sewing girl's room into which I now stepped. Plain as was the furniture  in comparison with the elaborate richness of the walls and ceiling,  there were still scattered through the room, which was large even for  a thirty foot house, articles of sufficient elegance to make the  supposition that it was the abode of an ordinary seamstress open to  suspicion, if no more.    Mrs. Daniels, seeing my look of surprise, hastened to provide some  explanation. \"It is the room which has always been devoted to sewing,\"  said she; \"and when Emily came, I thought it would be easier to put up  a bed here than to send her upstairs. She was a very nice girl and  disarranged nothing.\"    I glanced around on the writing-case lying open on a small table in the  centre of the room, on the vase half full of partly withered roses, on  the mantel-piece, the Shakespeare, and Macaulay's History lying on the  stand at my right, thought my own thoughts, but said nothing.    \"You found the door locked this morning?\" asked I, after a moment's  scrutiny of the room in which three facts had become manifest: first,  that the girl had not occupied the bed the night before; second, that  there had been some sort of struggle or surprise,--one of the curtains  being violently torn as if grasped by an agitated hand, to say nothing  of a chair lying upset on the floor with one of its legs broken; third,  that the departure, strange as it may seem, had been by the window.    \"Yes,\" returned she; \"but there is a passageway leading from my room  to hers and it was by that means we entered. There was a chair placed  against the door on this side but we easily pushed it away.\"    I stepped to the window and looked out. Ah, it would not be so very  difficult for a man to gain the street from that spot in a dark night,  for the roof of the newly-erected extension was almost on a level with  the window.    \"Well,\" said she anxiously, \"couldn't she have been got out that way?\"    \"More difficult things have been done,\" said I; and was about to step  out upon the roof when I bethought to inquire of Mrs. Daniels if any of  the girl's clothing was missing.    She immediately flew to the closets and thence to bureau drawers which  she turned hastily over. \"No, nothing is missing but a hat and cloak  and--\" She paused confusedly.    \"And what?\" I asked.    \"Nothing,\" returned she, hurriedly closing the bureau drawer; \"only some  little knick-knacks.\"    \"Knick-knacks!\" quoth I. \"If she stopped for knick-knacks, she couldn't  have gone in any very unwilling frame of mind.\" And somewhat disgusted,  I was about to throw up the whole affair and leave the room. But the  indecision in Mrs. Daniels' own face deterred me.    \"I don't understand it,\" murmured she, drawing her hand across her eyes.  \"I don't understand it. But,\" she went on with even an increase in her  old tone of heart-felt conviction, \"no matter whether we understand it  or not, the case is serious; I tell you so, and she must be found.\"    I resolved to know the nature of that must, used as few women in her  position would use it even under circumstances to all appearance more  aggravated than these.    \"Why, must?\" said I. \"If the girl went of her own accord as some things  seem to show, why should you, no relative as you acknowledge, take the  matter so to heart as to insist she shall be followed and brought back?\"    She turned away, uneasily taking up and putting down some little matters  on the table before her. \"Is it not enough that I promise to pay for  all expenses which a search will occasion, without my being forced to  declare just why I should be willing to do so? Am I bound to tell you I  love the girl? that I believe she has been taken away by foul means,  and that to her great suffering and distress? that being fond of her and  believing this, I am conscientious enough to put every means I possess  at the command of those who will recover her?\"    I was not satisfied with this but on that very account felt my  enthusiasm revive.    \"But Mr. Blake? Surely he is the one to take this interest if anybody.\"    \"I have before said,\" returned she, paling however as she spoke, \"that  Mr. Blake takes very little interest in his servants.\"    I cast another glance about the room. \"How long have you been in this  house?\" asked I.    \"I was in the service of Mr. Blake's father and he died a year ago.\"    \"Since when you have remained with Mr. Blake himself?\"    \"Yes sir.\"    \"And this Emily, when did she come here?\"    \"Oh it must be eleven months or so ago.\"    \"An Irish girl?\"    \"O no, American. She is not a common person, sir.\"    \"What do you mean by that? That she was educated, lady-like, pretty, or  what?\"    \"I don't know what to say. She was educated, yes, but not as you would  call a lady educated. Yet she knew a great many things the rest of us  did'nt. She liked to read, you see, and--O sir, ask the girls about her,  I never know what to say when I am questioned.\"    I scanned the gray-haired woman still more intently than I had yet done.  Was she the weak common-place creature she seemed, or had she really  some cause other than appeared for these her numerous breaks and  hesitations.    \"Where did you get this girl?\" I inquired. \"Where did she live before  coming here?\"    \"I cannot say, I never asked her to talk about herself. She came to me  for work and I liked her and took her without recommendation.\"    \"And she has served you well?\"    \"Excellently.\"    \"Been out much? Had any visitors?\"    She shook her head. \"Never went out and never had any visitors.\"    I own I was nonplussed, \"Well,\" said I, \"no more of this at present.  I must first find out if she left this house alone or in company with  others.\" And without further parley I stepped out upon the roof of the  extension.    As I did so I debated with myself whether the case warranted me or not  in sending for Mr. Gryce. As yet there was nothing to show that the girl  had come to any harm. A mere elopement with or without a lover to help  her, was not such a serious matter that the whole police force need  be stirred up on the subject; and if the woman had money, as she said,  ready to give the man who should discover the whereabouts of this girl,  why need that money be divided up any more than was necessary. Yet Gryce  was not one to be dallied with. He had said, send for him if"]]]
