In 1861 the population  exceeded 11,000. By 1911 it had grown by steady increments to 33,578.  The private diary of a resident of about 1850 would read like an old  world record. The watchman in the Minster Precincts still went his  rounds at night and called out the time and the weather; sedan-chairs  were in use; the corn-market of the neighbourhood was held in the open  street; turnpikes took toll at every road out of the town; a weekly  paper had only just been started on a humble scale, being at first  little more than a railway time-table with a few items of local news at  the back; a couple of rooms more than sufficed for the business of the  post office.    In 1874 a charter of incorporation was granted, not without some  opposition; it had been, up to that time, the only city in England  without a mayor, except Ely and Westminster.    An account of the church which is now the cathedral church of a diocese  that was only constituted in 1541, must of necessity trace its history  for some centuries before it attained its present dignity, and when it  was simply the church of an abbey. Three centuries and a half of  cathedral dignity have not made its old name of Minster obsolete; it is  indeed the term usually employed.[2]    The village was first known by the name of Medeshamstede, the homestead  in the meadows. There is no evidence that any houses were built at all  before the foundation of the monastery. There was probably not a single  habitation on the spot before the rising walls of the religious house  made dwelling-places for the workmen a necessity. As time went on the  requirements of the inmates brought together a population, which for  centuries had no interests unconnected with the abbey. The establishment  of the monastery is due to the conversion of the royal family to  Christianity. It was in the middle of the seventh century when Penda was  King of the Mercians, and his children, three sons, Peada, Wulfere, and  Ethelred, and two daughters, Kyneburga, and Kyneswitha, became converted  to the Christian faith. On succeeding to the throne, Peada the eldest  son, founded this monastery of Medeshamstede. The first Abbot, Saxulf,  had been in a high position at court; he is described as an earl  (_comes_); and most likely had the practical duty of building and  organising the monastery, as he is called by Bede the builder of the  place as well as first Abbot (_Constructor et abbas_). This was in the  year 654 or 655 (for the date is given differently by different  authorities), and Peada only lived two or three years afterwards. His  brothers in turn came to the throne, and both helped to enrich the  rising foundation. The elder of the two, however, had lapsed from  Christianity, and killed his own two sons in his rage at finding they  had become Christians; but afterwards stung with remorse he confessed  his offence to S. Chad, who had brought the princes to the knowledge of  Christ, and offered to expiate it in any way he was directed. He was  bidden to restore the Christian Religion, to repair the ruined churches,  and to found new ones. The whole story is told with great particularity  by the chronicler, and it was represented in stained glass in the  cloisters of the abbey, as described hereafter.    The church thus built must have been of considerable substance, if, as  recorded, Peada in the foundation of it \"laid such stones as that eight  yoke of oxen could scarce draw one of them.\"[1] It has nevertheless,  utterly perished. We read of the continued support bestowed by a  succession of princes and nobles, of the increasing dignity of the  house, and of the privileges it acquired; but there is nowhere a single  line descriptive of the buildings themselves. Gunton does indeed speak  of a goodly house for the Abbot constructed by King Peada; but he must  have been capable of strange credulity if he imagined, as his words seem  to imply, that this very house was in existence in the time of Henry  VIII. He writes thus:[3] \"The Royal Founder ... built also an house for  the Abbot, which upon the dissolution by Henry the Eighth, became the  Bishop's Palace. A building very large and stately, as the present age  can testifie; all the rooms of common habitation being built above  stairs, and underneath are very fair vaults and goodly cellars for  several uses. The great Hall, a magnificent room, had, at the upper end,  in the Wall, very high above the ground, three stately Thrones, wherein  were placed sitting, the three Royal Founders carved curiously of Wood,  painted and guilt, which in the year 1644 were pulled down and broken to  pieces.\"    [Illustration: The Cathedral; from the North, c. 1730]    There is no doubt that this first monastery was utterly destroyed by the  Danes about the year 870. The very circumstantial account given in the  chronicle of Abbot John, derived from Ingulf, is well known; but as it  is entirely without corroboration in any of the historians who mention  the destruction of the monastery, recent criticism has not hesitated to  pronounce the whole account a mere invention. It is unnecessary,  therefore, to give it here. The account \"may have some foundation in  fact,\" Professor Freeman admits, \"but if so, it is strange to find no  mention of it in Orderic.\"[4] But the discredit thrown upon the minutely  graphic story of Ingulf, does not of course apply to the actual fact, of  which there is ample evidence, that the monastery was burnt by the  Danes. Matthew of Westminster says:[5]--\"And so the wicked leaders,  passing through the district of York, burned the churches, cities, and  villages ... and thence advancing they destroyed all the monasteries  (_coenobia_) of monks and nuns situated in the fens, and slew the  inmates. The names of these monasteries are, Crowland, Thorney, Ramsey,  Hamstede, now called Burgh S. Peter, with the Isle of Ely, and that once  very famous house of nuns, wherein the holy Virgin and Queen Etheldreda  laudably discharged the office of abbess for many years.\"    The re-edification of the monastery, henceforth known as Burgh, is due  to Bishop Ethelwold, of Winchester, with the approval and support of  King Edgar. This was accomplished in 972. We have now reached a point  where all can take a practical interest in the subject, because portions  of this church are to be seen to this day. The exact site of the Saxon  church had always been a matter of conjecture until the excavations made  in the course of the works incidental to the rebuilding of the lantern  tower (1883-1893) finally settled the question. Many students of the  fabric supposed that the existing church practically followed the main  outlines of the former one, possibly with increased length and breadth,  but at any rate on the old site. It is now ascertained that the east end  of the Saxon church was nearly under the east wall of the present south  transept and the south walls of the south transepts of both buildings  were but a very few feet apart. The dimensions of the former church both  its length and breadth, were as nearly as possible half of those of the  existing one. A description of the present appearance of the remains  will be found in a later chapter (see page 80).    The Church of Bishop Ethelwold was not without its vicissitudes. Nothing  was more promising than its origin, and the circumstances of its  building. King Edgar and Dunstan, whom he had made Archbishop of  Canterbury, were very enthusiastic in extending the growth of monastic  influence in the country. No less than forty Benedictine convents are  said to have been either founded or restored by Edgar. Bishop Ethelwold  was entirely of one mind with the King and Archbishop, in the  ecclesiastical reforms of the day. Mr Poole well describes the  commencement of the work. \"At Medeshamstede the ruins were made to their  hands, and they at once commenced the grateful task of their restoration  and appropriation. As usual, we find certain supernatural interferences  assigned as indications of the divine approval of the work. It is  related how Ethelwold was directed by God, in a dream, to go to the  monastery of S. Peter, among the Mid-English; how he halted first at  Oundle, supposing that to be the monastery intended; but being warned in  a dream to continue his eastward course, at length discovered the ashes  of the desolated Medeshamstede. It needs but little ingenuity to collect  from this that Ethelwold, having received some vague intelligence of the  present condition both of Oundle and Medeshamstede, started from  Winchester, determined on reaching either or both; and that being less  pleased with what he saw at Oundle than he expected, he extended his  progress to Medeshamstede.\"[6] The Queen is said to have overheard the  Bishop's fervent prayers for the success of his object, and to have used  her influence with the King; but he probably required very little  persuasion to undertake what was so much to his taste. It may be  mentioned that if we accept the date 972 for the completion of the  re-building (the Chronicle gives 970 for its commencement), the very  same year witnessed that well-known scene on the River Dee, when King  Edgar held the helm of a royal barge as it was being rowed by eight  vassal kings.    [Illustration: Remains of Saxon Church]    The King came to visit the monastery thus rebuilt under his direction.  The Archbishops, Dunstan and Oswald, with a large company of the  nobility and clergy attended at the same time. The King is said to have  inspected some old deeds which had been saved from the general  destruction a century before, and to have wept for joy at reading the  privileges belonging to the place. He therefore granted a new charter,  confirming all the old privileges and possessions. Since in this charter  no allusion is made to the triple dedication of the church, but S. Peter  alone seems named as the Patron Saint, it is not "]]]
