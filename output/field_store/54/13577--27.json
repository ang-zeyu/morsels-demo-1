[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1261"],[0,"Betty Zane (#2)"],[1,"this story, were born.    Ebenezer Zane, the eldest, was born October 7, 1747, and grew to  manhood in the Potomac valley. There he married Elizabeth McColloch,  a sister of the famous McColloch brothers so well known in frontier  history.    Ebenezer was fortunate in having such a wife and no pioneer could  have been better blessed. She was not only a handsome woman, but one  of remarkable force of character as well as kindness of heart. She  was particularly noted for a rare skill in the treatment of illness,  and her deftness in handling the surgeon's knife and extracting a  poisoned bullet or arrow from a wound had restored to health many a  settler when all had despaired.    The Zane brothers were best known on the border for their athletic  prowess, and for their knowledge of Indian warfare and cunning. They  were all powerful men, exceedingly active and as fleet as deer. In  appearance they were singularly pleasing and bore a marked  resemblance to one another, all having smooth faces, clear cut,  regular features, dark eyes and long black hair.    When they were as yet boys they had been captured by Indians, soon  after their arrival on the Virginia border, and had been taken far  into the interior, and held as captives for two years. Ebenezer,  Silas, and Jonathan Zane were then taken to Detroit and ransomed.  While attempting to swim the Scioto river in an effort to escape,  Andrew Zane had been shot and killed by his pursuers.    But the bonds that held Isaac Zane, the remaining and youngest  brother, were stronger than those of interest or revenge such as had  caused the captivity of his brothers. He was loved by an Indian  princess, the daughter of Tarhe, the chief of the puissant Huron  race. Isaac had escaped on various occasions, but had always been  retaken, and at the time of the opening of our story nothing had  been heard of him for several years, and it was believed he had been  killed.    At the period of the settling of the little colony in the  wilderness, Elizabeth Zane, the only sister, was living with an aunt  in Philadelphia, where she was being educated.    Colonel Zane's house, a two story structure built of rough hewn  logs, was the most comfortable one in the settlement, and occupied a  prominent site on the hillside about one hundred yards from the  fort. It was constructed of heavy timber and presented rather a  forbidding appearance with its square corners, its ominous looking  portholes, and strongly barred doors and windows. There were three  rooms on the ground floor, a kitchen, a magazine room for military  supplies, and a large room for general use. The several sleeping  rooms were on the second floor, which was reached by a steep  stairway.    The interior of a pioneer's rude dwelling did not reveal, as a rule,  more than bare walls, a bed or two, a table and a few chairs--in  fact, no more than the necessities of life. But Colonel Zane's house  proved an exception to this. Most interesting was the large room.  The chinks between the logs had been plastered up with clay and then  the walls covered with white birch bark; trophies of the chase,  Indian bows and arrows, pipes and tomahawks hung upon them; the wide  spreading antlers of a noble buck adorned the space above the mantel  piece; buffalo robes covered the couches; bearskin rugs lay  scattered about on the hardwood floor. The wall on the western side  had been built over a huge stone, into which had been cut an open  fireplace.    This blackened recess, which had seen two houses burned over it,  when full of blazing logs had cheered many noted men with its  warmth. Lord Dunmore, General Clark, Simon Kenton, and Daniel Boone  had sat beside that fire. There Cornplanter, the Seneca chief, had  made his famous deal with Colonel Zane, trading the island in the  river opposite the settlement for a barrel of whiskey. Logan, the  Mingo chief and friend of the whites, had smoked many pipes of peace  there with Colonel Zane. At a later period, when King Louis  Phillippe, who had been exiled from France by Napoleon, had come to  America, during the course of his melancholy wanderings he had  stopped at Fort Henry a few days. His stay there was marked by a  fierce blizzard and the royal guest passed most of his time at  Colonel Zane's fireside. Musing by those roaring logs perhaps he saw  the radiant star of the Man of Destiny rise to its magnificent  zenith.    One cold, raw night in early spring the Colonel had just returned  from one of his hunting trips and the tramping of horses mingled  with the rough voices of the negro slaves sounded without. When  Colonel Zane entered the house he was greeted affectionately by his  wife and sister. The latter, at the death of her aunt in  Philadelphia, had come west to live with her brother, and had been  there since late in the preceding autumn. It was a welcome sight for  the eyes of a tired and weary hunter. The tender kiss of his comely  wife, the cries of the delighted children, and the crackling of the  fire warmed his heart and made him feel how good it was to be home  again after a three days' march in the woods. Placing his rifle in a  corner and throwing aside his wet hunting coat, he turned and stood  with his back to the bright blaze. Still young and vigorous, Colonel  Zane was a handsome man. Tall, though not heavy, his frame denoted  great strength and endurance. His face was smooth, his heavy  eyebrows met in a straight line; his eyes were dark and now beamed  with a kindly light; his jaw was square and massive; his mouth  resolute; in fact, his whole face was strikingly expressive of  courage and geniality. A great wolf dog had followed him in and,  tired from travel, had stretched himself out before the fireplace,  laying his noble head on the paws he had extended toward the warm  blaze.    \"Well! Well! I am nearly starved and mighty glad to get back,\" said  the Colonel, with a smile of satisfaction at the steaming dishes a  negro servant was bringing from the kitchen.    \"We are glad you have returned,\" answered his wife, whose glowing  face testified to the pleasure she felt. \"Supper is ready--Annie,  bring in some cream--yes, indeed, I am happy that you are home. I  never have a moment's peace when you are away, especially when you  are accompanied by Lewis Wetzel.\"    \"Our hunt was a failure,\" said the Colonel, after he had helped  himself to a plate full of roast wild turkey. \"The bears have just  come out of their winter's sleep and are unusually wary at this  time. We saw many signs of their work, tearing rotten logs to pieces  in search of grubs and bees' nests. Wetzel killed a deer and we  baited a likely place where we had discovered many bear tracks. We  stayed up all night in a drizzling rain, hoping to get a shot. I am  tired out. So is Tige. Wetzel did not mind the weather or the ill  luck, and when we ran across some Indian sign he went off on one of  his lonely tramps, leaving me to come home alone.\"    \"He is such a reckless man,\" remarked Mrs. Zane.    \"Wetzel is reckless, or rather, daring. His incomparable nerve  carries him safely through many dangers, where an ordinary man would  have no show whatever. Well, Betty, how are you?\"    \"Quite well,\" said the slender, dark-eyed girl who had just taken  the seat opposite the Colonel.    \"Bessie, has my sister indulged in any shocking escapade in my  absence? I think that last trick of hers, when she gave a bucket of  hard cider to that poor tame bear, should last her a spell.\"    \"No, for a wonder Elizabeth has been very good. However, I do not  attribute it to any unusual change of temperament; simply the cold,  wet weather. I anticipate a catastrophe very shortly if she is kept  indoors much longer.\"    \"I have not had much opportunity to be anything but well behaved. If  it rains a few days more I shall become desperate. I want to ride my  pony, roam the woods, paddle my canoe, and enjoy myself,\" said  Elizabeth.    \"Well! Well! Betts, I knew it would be dull here for you, but you  must not get discouraged. You know you got here late last fall, and  have not had any pleasant weather yet. It is perfectly delightful in  May and June. I can take you to fields of wild white honeysuckle and  May flowers and wild roses. I know you love the woods, so be patient  a little longer.\"    Elizabeth had been spoiled by her brothers--what girl would not have  been by five great big worshippers?--and any trivial thing gone  wrong with her was a serious matter to them. They were proud of her,  and of her beauty and accomplishments were never tired of talking.  She had the dark hair and eyes so characteristic of the Zanes; the  same oval face and fine features: and added to this was a certain  softness of contour and a sweetness of expression which made her  face bewitching. But, in spite of that demure and innocent face, she  possessed a decided will of her own, and one very apt to be  asserted; she was mischievous; inclined to coquettishness, and more  terrible than all she had a fiery temper which could be aroused with  the most surprising ease.    Colonel Zane was wont to say that his sister's accomplishments were  innumerable. After only a few months on the border she could prepare  the flax and weave a linsey dresscloth with admirable skill.  Sometimes to humor Betty the Colonel's wife would allow her to get  the dinner, and she would do it in a manner that pleased her  brothers, and called forth golden praises from the cook, old Sam's  wife who had been with the family twenty years. Betty sang in the  little church on Sundays; she organized and taught a Sunday school  class; she often beat Colonel Zane and Major McColloch at their  favorite game of checkers, which they had played together since they  were knee high; in fact, Betty did nearly everything well, from  baking pies to painting the birch bark walls of her room. But these  things were insignificant in Colonel Zane's eyes. If the Colonel  were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1262"],[0,"The Heritage of the Desert: A Novel (#2)"],[1,"eyed, gliding noiselessly like a shadow. \"Take his arm.\" Between them  they led Hare to a jumble of stones on the outer edge of the circle of  light.    \"It wouldn't do to hide,\" continued Naab, lowering his voice to a swift  whisper, \"that might be fatal. You're in sight from the camp-fire, but  indistinct. By-and-by the outlaws will get here, and if any of them  prowl around close, you and Mescal must pretend to be sweethearts.  Understand? They'll pass by Mormon love-making without a second look.  Now, lad, courage... Mescal, it may save his life.\"    Naab returned to the fire, his shadow looming in gigantic proportions on  the white canopy of a covered wagon. Fitful gusts of wind fretted the  blaze; it roared and crackled and sputtered, now illuminating the still  forms, then enveloping them in fantastic obscurity. Hare shivered,  perhaps from the cold air, perhaps from growing dread. Westward lay the  desert, an impenetrable black void; in front, the gloomy mountain wall  lifted jagged peaks close to the stars; to the right rose the ridge, the  rocks and stunted cedars of its summit standing in weird relief.  Suddenly Hare's fugitive glance descried a dark object; he watched  intently as it moved and rose from behind the summit of the ridge to  make a bold black figure silhouetted against the cold clearness of sky.  He saw it distinctly, realized it was close, and breathed hard as the  wind-swept mane and tail, the lean, wild shape and single plume resolved  themselves into the unmistakable outline of an Indian mustang and rider.    \"Look!\" he whispered to the girl. \"See, a mounted Indian, there on the  ridge--there, he's gone--no, I see him again. But that's another. Look!  there are more.\" He ceased in breathless suspense and stared fearfully  at a line of mounted Indians moving in single file over the ridge to  become lost to view in the intervening blackness. A faint rattling of  gravel and the peculiar crack of unshod hoof on stone gave reality to  that shadowy train.    \"Navajos,\" said Mescal.    \"Navajos!\" he echoed. \"I heard of them at Lund; 'desert hawks' the men  called them, worse than Piutes. Must we not alarm the men?--You--aren't  you afraid?    \"No.\"    \"But they are hostile.\"    \"Not to him.\" She pointed at the stalwart figure standing against the  firelight.    \"Ah! I remember. The man Cole spoke of friendly Navajos. They must be  close by. What does it mean?\"    \"I'm not sure. I think they are out there in the cedars, waiting.\"    \"Waiting! For what?\"    \"Perhaps for a signal.\"    \"Then they were expected?\"    \"I don't know; I only guess. We used to ride often to White Sage and  Lund; now we go seldom, and when we do there seem to be Navajos near the  camp at night, and riding the ridges by day. I believe Father Naab  knows.\"    \"Your father's risking much for me. He's good. I wish I could show my  gratitude.\"    \"I call him Father Naab, but he is not my father.\"    \"A niece or granddaughter, then?\"    \"I'm no relation. Father Naab raised me in his family. My mother was a  Navajo, my father a Spaniard.\"    \"Why!\" exclaimed Hare. \"When you came out of the wagon I took you for an  Indian girl. But the moment you spoke--you talk so well--no one would  dream--\"    \"Mormons are well educated and teach the children they raise,\" she said,  as he paused in embarrassment.    He wanted to ask if she were a Mormon by religion, but the question  seemed curious and unnecessary. His interest was aroused; he realized  suddenly that he had found pleasure in her low voice; it was new and  strange, unlike any woman's voice he had ever heard; and he regarded her  closely. He had only time for a glance at her straight, clean-cut  profile, when she turned startled eyes on him, eyes black as the night.  And they were eyes that looked through and beyond him. She held up a  hand, slowly bent toward the wind, and whispered:    \"Listen.\"    Hare heard nothing save the barking of coyotes and the breeze in the  sage. He saw, however, the men rise from round the camp-fire to face the  north, and the women climb into the wagon, and close the canvas flaps.  And he prepared himself, with what fortitude he could command for the  approach of the outlaws. He waited, straining to catch a sound. His  heart throbbed audibly, like a muffled drum, and for an endless moment  his ears seemed deadened to aught else. Then a stronger puff of wind  whipped in, banging the rhythmic beat of flying hoofs. Suspense ended.  Hare felt the easing of a weight upon him. Whatever was to be his fate,  it would be soon decided. The sound grew into a clattering roar. A black  mass hurled itself over the border of opaque circle, plunged into the  light, and halted.    August Naab deliberately threw a bundle of grease-wood upon the camp-  fire. A blaze leaped up, sending abroad a red flare. \"Who comes?\" he  called.    \"Friends, Mormons, friends,\" was the answer.    \"Get down--friends--and come to the fire.\"    Three horsemen advanced to the foreground; others, a troop of eight or  ten, remained in the shadow, a silent group.    Hare sank back against the stone. He knew the foremost of those horsemen  though he had never seen him.    \"Dene,\" whispered Mescal, and confirmed his instinctive fear.    Hare was nervously alive to the handsome presence of the outlaw.  Glimpses that he had caught of \"bad\" men returned vividly as he noted  the clean-shaven face, the youthful, supple body, the cool, careless  mien. Dene's eyes glittered as he pulled off his gauntlets and beat the  sand out of them; and but for that quick fierce glance his leisurely  friendly manner would have disarmed suspicion.    \"Are you the Mormon Naab?\" he queried.    \"August Naab, I am.\"    \"Dry camp, eh? Hosses tired, I reckon. Shore it's a sandy trail. Where's  the rest of you fellers?\"    \"Cole and his men were in a hurry to make White Sage to-night. They were  travelling light; I've heavy wagons.\"    \"Naab, I reckon you shore wouldn't tell a lie?\"    \"I have never lied.\"    \"Heerd of a young feller thet was in Lund--pale chap--lunger, we'd call  him back West?\"    \"I heard that he had been mistaken for a spy at Lund and had fled toward  Bane.\"    \"Hadn't seen nothin' of him this side of Lund?\"    \"No.\"    \"Seen any Navvies?\"    \"Yes.\"    The outlaw stared hard at him. Apparently he was about to speak of the  Navajos, for his quick uplift of head at Naab's blunt affirmative  suggested the impulse. But he checked himself and slowly drew on his  gloves.    \"Naab, I'm shore comin' to visit you some day. Never been over thet  range. Heerd you hed fine water, fine cattle. An' say, I seen thet  little Navajo girl you have, an' I wouldn't mind seein' her again.\"    August Naab kicked the fire into brighter blaze. \"Yes fine range,\" he  presently replied, his gaze fixed on Dene. \"Fine water, fine cattle,  fine browse. I've a fine graveyard, too; thirty graves, and not one a  woman's. Fine place for graves, the canyon country. You don't have to  dig. There's one grave the Indians never named; it's three thousand feet  deep.\"    \"Thet must be in hell,\" replied Dene, with a smile, ignoring the covert  meaning. He leisurely surveyed Naab's four sons, the wagons and horses,  till his eye fell upon Hare and Mescal. With that he swung in his saddle  as if to dismount.    \"I shore want a look around.\"    \"Get down, get down,\" returned the Mormon. The deep voice, unwelcoming,  vibrant with an odd ring, would have struck a less suspicious man than  Dene. The outlaw wrung his leg back over the pommel, sagged in the  saddle, and appeared to be pondering the question. Plainly he was  uncertain of his ground. But his indecision was brief.    \"Two-Spot, you look 'em over,\" he ordered.    The third horseman dismounted and went toward the wagons.    Hare, watching this scene, became conscious that his fear had  intensified with the recognition of Two-Spot as Chance, the outlaw whom  he would not soon forget. In his excitement he moved against Mescal and  felt her trembling violently.    \"Are you afraid?\" he whispered.    \"Yes, of Dene.\"    The outlaw rummaged in one of the wagons, pulled aside the canvas flaps  of the other, laughed harshly, and then with clinking spurs tramped  through the camp, kicking the beds, overturning a pile of saddles, and  making disorder generally, till he spied the couple sitting on the stone  in the shadow.    As the outlaw lurched that way, Hare, with a start of recollection, took  Mescal in his arms and leaned his head against hers. He felt one of her  hands lightly brush his shoulder and rest there, trembling.    Shuffling footsteps scraped the sand, sounded nearer and nearer, slowed  and paused.    \"Sparkin'! Dead to the world. Ham! Haw! Haw!\"    The coarse laugh gave place to moving footsteps. The rattling clink of  stirrup and spur mingled with the restless stamp of horse. Chance had  mounted. Dene's voice drawled out: \"Good-bye, Naab, I shore will see you  all some day.\" The heavy thuds of many hoofs evened into a roar that  diminished as it rushed away.    In unutterable relief Hare realized his deliverance. He tried to rise,  but power of movement had gone from him.    He was fainting, yet his sensations were singularly acute. Mescal's hand  dropped from his shoulder; her cheek, that had been cold against his,  grew hot; she quivered through all her slender length. Confusion claimed  his senses. Gratitude and hope flooded his soul. Something sweet and  beautiful, the touch of this desert girl, rioted in his blood; his heart  swelled in exquisite agony. Then he was whirling in darkness; and he  knew no more.              II. WHITE SAGE    THE night was as a blank to Hare; the morning like a drifting of hazy  clouds before his eyes. He felt himself moving; and when he awakened  clearly to consciousness he lay upon a couch on the vine-covered porch  of a cottage. He saw August Naab open a garden gate to admit Martin  Cole. They met as friends; no trace of scorn marred"]]]
