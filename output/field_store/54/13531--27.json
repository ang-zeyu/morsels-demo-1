In September,  1782, he escaped from Stuttgart with his loyal friend Streicher and  took his way northward toward the Palatinate. He had set his hopes on  finding employment in Mannheim.    [Illustration: SCHILLER'S FATHER AND MOTHER]    Before leaving his native Swabia he had virtually completed a second  play dealing with the conspiracy of Count Fiesco at Genoa in the year  1547. He had also won his spurs as a poet and a critic. His _Anthology  for 1782_ contains a large number of short poems, some of them  evincing a rare talent for dramatic story-telling, others  foreshadowing the imaginative sweep and the warmth of feeling which  characterize the best poetic work of the later Schiller. Such,  notably, are the poems to Laura, in which the lover's raptures are  linked with the law of gravitation and the preestablished harmony of  the world. He also contributed several papers to the Wuerttemberg  _Repertorium_, especially a review of _The Robbers_ in which,  dissecting his own child with remorseless impartiality, he anticipated  nearly everything that critics were destined to urge against the play  during the next hundred years. Having left his post of duty and  being a military officer, Schiller was technically a deserter and had  reason to fear pursuit and arrest. At Mannheim his affairs went badly.  The politic Dalberg was not eager to befriend a youth who had offended  the powerful Duke of Wuerttemberg; so _Fiesco_ was rejected and its  author came into dire straits. Toward the close of the year he found a  welcome refuge at Bauerbach, where a house was put at his disposal by  his friend Frau von Wolzogen. Here he remained several months,  occupied mainly with a new play which came to be known as _Cabal and  Love_. He also sketched a historical tragedy, _Don Carlos_, being led  to the subject by his reading of St. Real's historical novel _Don  Carlos_. During the first part of his stay at Bauerbach Schiller went  by the name of Dr. Ritter and wrote purposely misleading letters as to  his intended movements. By the summer of 1783, however, it had become  apparent that the Duke of Wuerttemberg was not going to make trouble.  Relieved of anxiety on this score, and not having had very good  success of late with his theatre, Dalberg reopened negotiations with  Schiller, who was easily persuaded to emerge from his hiding-place and  become theatre-poet at Mannheim under contract for one year.    During this year at Mannheim _Fiesco_ and _Cabal and Love_ were put on  the stage and published. The former is a quasi-historical tragedy of  intriguing ambition, ending--in the original version--with the death  of Fiesco at the hands of the fanatical republican Verrina. While  there is much to admire in its abounding vigor and its picturesque  details, _Fiesco_ lacks artistic finality and is the least interesting  of Schiller's early plays. Much more important is _Cabal and Love_, a  domestic tragedy that has held the stage to this day and is generally  regarded as the best of its kind in the eighteenth-century German  drama. Class conflict is the tragic element. A maid of low degree and  her high-minded, aristocratic lover are done to death by a miserable  court intrigue. Far more than in _The Robbers_ Schiller was here  writing with his eye on the facts. Much Wuerttemberg history is thinly  disguised in this drastic comment on the crimes, follies and  banalities of German court life under the Old Regime.    Notwithstanding his success as a playwright and his receipt of the  honorable title of Councilor from the Duke of Weimar, Schiller was  unhappy at Mannheim. Sickness, debt and loneliness oppressed him,  making creative work well-nigh impossible. In June, 1784, when the sky  was looking very black, he received a heartening letter from a quartet  of unknown admirers in Leipzig, one of whom was Gottfried Koerner.  Schiller was deeply touched. In his hunger for sympathy and friendship  he resolved to leave Mannheim and seek out these good people who had  shown such a kindly interest in him. Fortunately Koerner was a man of  some means and was able to help not only with words but with cash. So  it came about that in the spring of 1785 Schiller forsook Mannheim,  which had become as a prison to him, and went to Leipzig. Thence,  after a short sojourn, he followed Koerner to Dresden. The relation  between the two men developed into a warm and mutually inspiring  friendship. A feeling of jubilant happiness took possession of  Schiller and soon found expression in the _Song to Joy_, wherein a  kiss of love and sympathy is offered to all mankind.    [Illustration: 1. SCHILLER'S HOUSE IN WEIMAR]    [Illustration: 2. SCHILLER'S BIRTHPLACE IN MARBACH]    During his two years' sojourn in Dresden Schiller was mainly occupied  with the editing of a magazine, the _Thalia_, and with the completion  of _Don Carlos_, the first of his plays in blank verse. Hitherto he  had written with his eye on the stage, and in the savage spirit of the  Storm and Stress. Now, however, the higher ambition of the dramatic  poet began to assert itself. His views of life were changing, and his  nature craved a freer and nobler self-expression than was possible in  the \"three hours' traffic of the stage.\" He had begun _Don Carlos_ at  Bauerbach, intending to make it a love-tragedy in a royal household  and incidentally to scourge the Spanish inquisition. Little by little,  however, the centre of his interest shifted from the lovesick Carlos  to the quixotic dreamer Posa, and the result was that the love-tragedy  gradually grew into a tragedy of political idealism with Posa for its  hero. As finally completed in the summer of 1787, _Don Carlos_ had  twice the length of an ordinary stage-play and, withal, a certain lack  of artistic unity. But its sonorous verse, its fine phrasing of large  ideas, and its noble dignity of style settled forever the question of  Schiller's power as a dramatic poet. The third act especially is  instinct with the best idealism of the eighteenth century.    After _Don Carlos_ Schiller wrote no more plays for some nine years,  being occupied in the interval chiefly with history and philosophy.  His dramatic work had interested him more especially in the sixteenth  century. At Dresden he began to read history with great avidity and  found it very appetizing. What he most cared for, evidently, was not  the annals of warfare or the growth of institutions, but the  psychology of the great man. He was an ardent lover of freedom, both  political and intellectual, and took keen delight in tracing its  progress. On the other hand, play-writing had its disadvantages. Thus  far it had brought him more of notoriety than of solid fame, and his  income was so small that he was dependent on Koerner's generosity. To  escape from this irksome position he decided to try his fortune in  Thuringia. Going over to Weimar, in the summer of 1787, he was well  received by Herder and Wieland--Goethe was just then in Italy--and  presently he settled down to write a history of the Dutch Rebellion.  His plan looked forward to six volumes, but only one was ever written.  It was published in 1788 under the title of _The Defection of the  Netherlands_ and led to its author's appointment as unsalaried  professor of history at the University of Jena. He began to lecture in  the spring of 1789.    Meanwhile he had taken up the study of the Greek poets and found them  very edifying and sanative--just the influence that he needed to  clarify his judgment and correct his earlier vagaries of taste. He was  fascinated by the _Odyssey_ and in a mood of fleeting enthusiasm he  resolved to read nothing but the ancients for the next two years.  He translated the _Iphigenia in Aulis_ of Euripides and a part of _The  Phenician Women_. Out of this newborn ardor grew two important poems,  _The Gods of Greece_ and _The Artists_; the former an elegy on the  decay of Greek polytheism conceived as a loss of beauty to the world,  the latter a philosophic retrospect of human history wherein the  evolutionary function of art is glorified. At the same time he revived  the dormant _Thalia_ and used its columns for the continued  publication of _The Ghost-seer_, a pot-boiling novel which he had  begun at Dresden. It is Schiller's one serious attempt at prose  fiction. His initial purpose was to describe an elaborate and  fine-spun intrigue, devised by mysterious agents of the Church of  Rome, for the winning over of a Protestant German prince. The story  begins in a promising way, and the later portions contain fine  passages of narrative and character-drawing. But its author presently  began to feel that it was unworthy of him and left it unfinished.    [Illustration: MONUMENT TO SCHILLER (Berlin) _Sculptor, Reinhold  Begas_]    On the 22d of February, 1790, Schiller was married to Lotte von  Lengefeld, with whom he lived most happily the rest of his days. His  letters of this period tell of a quiet joy such as he had not known  before. And then, suddenly, his fair prospects were clouded by the  disastrous breakdown of his health. An attack of pneumonia in the  winter of 1790-1791 came near to a fatal ending, and hardly had he  recovered from that before he was prostrated by a second illness worse  than the first. He bade farewell to his friends, and the report went  abroad that he was dead. After a while he rallied, but never again to  be strong and well. From this time forth he must be thought of as a  semi-invalid, doomed to a very cautious mode of living and expectant  of an early death. It was to be a fourteen years' battle between a  heroic soul and an ailing body.    For a while, owing to the forced cessation of the literary work on  which his small income depended, he was in great distress for lack of  money. His wife, while of noble family, had brought nothing but  herself to the marriage partnership. And then, just as in the dark  days at Mannheim in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11716"],[0,"The Balkans: A History of Bulgaria—Serbia—Greece—Rumania—Turkey (#2)"],[1,"Slavonic while the coastal fringe is Greek, and of the approximately equal  numerical strength of all three nations, it is almost inevitable that the  ultimate solution of the problem and delimitation of political boundaries  will have to be effected by means of territorial compromise. It can only  be hoped that this ultimate compromise will be agreed upon by the three  countries concerned, and will be more equitable than that which was forced  on them by Rumania in 1913 and laid down in the Treaty of Bucarest of that  year.    If no arrangement on a principle of give and take is made between them,  the road to the East, which from the point of view of the Germanic powers  lies through Serbia, will sooner or later inevitably be forced open, and  the independence, first of Serbia, Montenegro, and Albania, and later of  Bulgaria and Greece, will disappear, _de facto_ if not in appearance, and  both materially and morally they will become the slaves of the central  empires. If the Balkan League could be reconstituted, Germany and Austria  would never reach Salonika or Constantinople.        2    _The Balkan Peninsula in Classical Times_    400 B.C. - A.D. 500.      In the earlier historical times the whole of the eastern part of the  Balkan peninsula between the Danube and the Aegean was known as Thracia,  while the western part (north of the forty-first degree of latitude) was  termed Illyricum; the lower basin of the river Vardar (the classical  Axius) was called Macedonia. A number of the tribal and personal names of  the early Illyrians and Thracians have been preserved. Philip of Macedonia  subdued Thrace in the fourth century B.C. and in 342 founded the city of  Philippopolis. Alexander's first campaign was devoted to securing control  of the peninsula, but during the Third century B.C. Thrace was invaded  from the north and laid waste by the Celts, who had already visited  Illyria. The Celts vanished by the end of that century, leaving a few  place-names to mark their passage. The city of Belgrade was known until  the seventh century A.D. by its Celtic name of Singidunum. Naissus, the  modern Nish, is also possibly of Celtic origin. It was towards 230 B.C.  that Rome came into contact with Illyricum, owing to the piratical  proclivities of its inhabitants, but for a long time it only controlled  the Dalmatian coast, so called after the Delmati or Dalmati, an Illyrian  tribe. The reason for this was the formidable character of the mountains  of Illyria, which run in several parallel and almost unbroken lines the  whole length of the shore of the Adriatic and have always formed an  effective barrier to invasion from the west. The interior was only very  gradually subdued by the Romans after Macedonia had been occupied by them  in 146 B.C. Throughout the first century B.C. conflicts raged with varying  fortune between the invaders and all the native races living between the  Adriatic and the Danube. They were attacked both from Aquileia in the  north and from Macedonia in the south, but it was not till the early years  of our era that the Danube became the frontier of the Roman Empire.    In the year A.D. 6 Moesia, which included a large part of the modern  kingdom of Serbia and the northern half of that of Bulgaria between the  Danube and the Balkan range (the classical Haemus), became an imperial  province, and twenty years later Thrace, the country between the Balkan  range and the Aegean, was incorporated in the empire, and was made a  province by the Emperor Claudius in A.D. 46. The province of Illyricum or  Dalmatia stretched between the Save and the Adriatic, and Pannonia lay  between the Danube and the Save. In 107 A.D. the Emperor Trajan conquered  the Dacians beyond the lower Danube, and organized a province of Dacia out  of territory roughly equivalent to the modern Wallachia and Transylvania,  This trans-Danubian territory did not remain attached to the empire for  more than a hundred and fifty years; but within the river line a vast belt  of country, stretching from the head of the Adriatic to the mouths of the  Danube on the Black Sea, was Romanized through and through. The Emperor  Trajan has been called the Charlemagne of the Balkan peninsula; all  remains are attributed to him (he was nicknamed the Wallflower by  Constantine the Great), and his reign marked the zenith of Roman power in  this part of the world. The Balkan peninsula enjoyed the benefits of Roman  civilization for three centuries, from the first to the fourth, but from  the second century onwards the attitude of the Romans was defensive rather  than offensive. The war against the Marcomanni under the Emperor Marcus  Aurelius, in the second half of this century, was the turning-point. Rome  was still victorious, but no territory was added to the empire. The third  century saw the southward movement of the Germanic peoples, who took the  place of the Celts. The Goths invaded the peninsula, and in 251 the  Emperor Decius was killed in battle against them near Odessus on the Black  Sea (the modern Varna). The Goths reached the outskirts of Thessalonica  (Salonika), but were defeated by the Emperor Claudius at Naissus (Nish) in  269; shortly afterwards, however, the Emperor Aurelian had definitively to  relinquish Dacia to them. The Emperor Diocletian, a native of Dalmatia,  who reigned from 284 to 305, carried out a redistribution of the imperial  provinces. Pannonia and western Illyria, or Dalmatia, were assigned to the  prefecture of Italy, Thrace to that of the Orient, while the whole centre  of the peninsula, from the Danube to the Peloponnese, constituted the  prefecture of Illyria, with Thessalonica as capital. The territory to the  north of the Danube having been lost, what is now western Bulgaria was  renamed Dacia, while Moesia, the modern kingdom of Serbia, was made very  much smaller. Praevalis, or the southern part of Dalmatia, approximately  the modern Montenegro and Albania, was detached from that province and  added to the prefecture of Illyria. In this way the boundary between the  province of Dalmatia and the Balkan peninsula proper ran from near the  lake of Scutari in the south to the river Drinus (the modern Drina), whose  course it followed till the Save was reached in the north.    An event of far-reaching importance in the following century was the  elevation by Constantine the Great of the Greek colony of Byzantium into  the imperial city of Constantinople in 325. This century also witnessed  the arrival of the Huns in Europe from Asia. They overwhelmed the  Ostrogoths, between the Dnieper and the Dniester, in 375, and the  Visigoths, settled in Transylvania and the modern Rumania, moved  southwards in sympathy with this event. The Emperor Valens lost his life  fighting against these Goths in 378 at the great battle of Adrianople (a  city established in Thrace by the Emperor Hadrian in the second century).  His successor, the Emperor Theodosius, placated them with gifts and made  them guardians of the northern frontier, but at his death, in 395, they  overran and devastated the entire peninsula, after which they proceeded to  Italy. After the death of the Emperor Theodosius the empire was divided,  never to be joined into one whole again. The dividing line followed that,  already mentioned, which separated the prefecture of Italy from those of  Illyria and the Orient, that is to say, it began in the south, on the  shore of the Adriatic near the Bocche di Cattaro, and went due north along  the valley of the Drina till the confluence of that river with the Save.  It will be seen that this division had consequences which have lasted to  the present day. Generally speaking, the Western Empire was Latin in  language and character, while the Eastern was Greek, though owing to the  importance of the Danubian provinces to Rome from the military point of  view, and the lively intercourse maintained between them, Latin influence  in them was for a long time stronger than Greek. Its extent is proved by  the fact that the people of modern Rumania are partly, and their language  very largely, defended from those of the legions and colonies of the  Emperor Trajan.    Latin influence, shipping, colonization, and art were always supreme on  the eastern shores of the Adriatic, just as were those of Greece on the  shores of the Black Sea. The Albanians even, descendants of the ancient  Illyrians, were affected by the supremacy of the Latin language, from  which no less than a quarter of their own meagre vocabulary is derived;  though driven southwards by the Romans and northwards by the Greeks, they  have remained in their mountain fastnesses to this day, impervious to any  of the civilizations to which they have been exposed.    Christianity spread to the shores of the peninsula very early; Macedonia  and Dalmatia were the parts where it was first established, and it took  some time to penetrate into the interior. During the reign of Diocletian  numerous martyrs suffered for the faith in the Danubian provinces, but  with the accession of Constantine the Great persecution came to an end. As  soon, however, as the Christians were left alone, they started persecuting  each other, and during the fourth century the Arian controversy re-echoed  throughout the peninsula.    In the fifth century the Huns moved from the shores of the Black Sea to  the plains of the Danube and the Theiss; they devastated the Balkan  peninsula, in spite of the tribute which they had levied on Constantinople  in return for their promise of peace. After the death of Attila, in 453,  they again retreated to Asia, and during the second half of the century  the Goths were once more supreme in the peninsula. Theodoric occupied  Singidunum (Belgrade) in 471 and, after plundering Macedonia and Greece,  settled in Novae (the modern Svishtov), on the lower Danube, in 483, where  he remained till he transferred the sphere of his activities to Italy ten"]]]
