Much, too, we forgave her because of her friendliness to the birds and  animals that haunted the shores. Cormorants lined the banks in lonely  places in rows like short black palings; grey crows crowded the  shingle-beds; storks stood fishing in the vistas of shallower water that  opened up between the islands, and hawks, swans, and marsh birds of all  sorts filled the air with glinting wings and singing, petulant cries. It  was impossible to feel annoyed with the river's vagaries after seeing a  deer leap with a splash into the water at sunrise and swim past the bows of  the canoe; and often we saw fawns peering at us from the underbrush, or  looked straight into the brown eyes of a stag as we charged full tilt round  a corner and entered another reach of the river. Foxes, too, everywhere  haunted the banks, tripping daintily among the driftwood and disappearing  so suddenly that it was impossible to see how they managed it.    But now, after leaving Pressburg, everything changed a little, and the  Danube became more serious. It ceased trifling. It was half-way to the  Black Sea, within seeming distance almost of other, stranger countries  where no tricks would be permitted or understood. It became suddenly  grown-up, and claimed our respect and even our awe. It broke out into three  arms, for one thing, that only met again a hundred kilometers farther down,  and for a canoe there were no indications which one was intended to be  followed.    \"If you take a side channel,\" said the Hungarian officer we met in the  Pressburg shop while buying provisions, \"you may find yourselves, when the  flood subsides, forty miles from anywhere, high and dry, and you may easily  starve. There are no people, no farms, no fishermen. I warn you not to  continue. The river, too, is still rising, and this wind will increase.\"    The rising river did not alarm us in the least, but the matter of being  left high and dry by a sudden subsidence of the waters might be serious,  and we had consequently laid in an extra stock of provisions. For the rest,  the officer's prophecy held true, and the wind, blowing down a perfectly  clear sky, increased steadily till it reached the dignity of a westerly  gale.    It was earlier than usual when we camped, for the sun was a good hour or  two from the horizon, and leaving my friend still asleep on the hot sand, I  wandered about in desultory examination of our hotel. The island, I found,  was less than an acre in extent, a mere sandy bank standing some two or  three feet above the level of the river. The far end, pointing into the  sunset, was covered with flying spray which the tremendous wind drove off  the crests of the broken waves. It was triangular in shape, with the apex  up stream.    I stood there for several minutes, watching the impetuous crimson flood  bearing down with a shouting roar, dashing in waves against the bank as  though to sweep it bodily away, and then swirling by in two foaming streams  on either side. The ground seemed to shake with the shock and rush, while  the furious movement of the willow bushes as the wind poured over them  increased the curious illusion that the island itself actually moved.  Above, for a mile or two, I could see the great river descending upon me;  it was like looking up the slope of a sliding hill, white with foam, and  leaping up everywhere to show itself to the sun.    The rest of the island was too thickly grown with willows to make walking  pleasant, but I made the tour, nevertheless. From the lower end the light,  of course, changed, and the river looked dark and angry. Only the backs of  the flying waves were visible, streaked with foam, and pushed forcibly by  the great puffs of wind that fell upon them from behind. For a short mile  it was visible, pouring in and out among the islands, and then disappearing  with a huge sweep into the willows, which closed about it like a herd of  monstrous antediluvian creatures crowding down to drink. They made me think  of gigantic sponge-like growths that sucked the river up into themselves.  They caused it to vanish from sight. They herded there together in such  overpowering numbers.    Altogether it was an impressive scene, with its utter loneliness, its  bizarre suggestion; and as I gazed, long and curiously, a singular emotion  began to stir somewhere in the depths of me. Midway in my delight of the  wild beauty, there crept, unbidden and unexplained, a curious feeling of  disquietude, almost of alarm.    A rising river, perhaps, always suggests something of the ominous; many of  the little islands I saw before me would probably have been swept away by  the morning; this resistless, thundering flood of water touched the sense  of awe. Yet I was aware that my uneasiness lay deeper far than the emotions  of awe and wonder. It was not that I felt. Nor had it directly to do with  the power of the driving wind--this shouting hurricane that might almost  carry up a few acres of willows into the air and scatter them like so much  chaff over the landscape. The wind was simply enjoying itself, for nothing  rose out of the flat landscape to stop it, and I was conscious of sharing  its great game with a kind of pleasurable excitement. Yet this novel  emotion had nothing to do with the wind. Indeed, so vague was the sense of  distress I experienced, that it was impossible to trace it to its source  and deal with it accordingly, though I was aware somehow that it had to do  with my realization of our utter insignificance before this unrestrained  power of the elements about me. The huge-grown river had something to do  with it too--a vague, unpleasant idea that we had somehow trifled with  these great elemental forces in whose power we lay helpless every hour of  the day and night. For here, indeed, they were gigantically at play  together, and the sight appealed to the imagination.    But my emotion, so far as I could understand it, seemed to attach itself  more particularly to the willow bushes, to these acres and acres of  willows, crowding, so thickly growing there, swarming everywhere the eye  could reach, pressing upon the river as though to suffocate it, standing in  dense array mile after mile beneath the sky, watching, waiting, listening.  And, apart quite from the elements, the willows connected themselves subtly  with my malaise, attacking the mind insidiously somehow by reason of their  vast numbers, and contriving in some way or other to represent to the  imagination a new and mighty power, a power, moreover, not altogether  friendly to us.    Great revelations of nature, of course, never fail to impress in one way or  another, and I was no stranger to moods of the kind. Mountains overawe and  oceans terrify, while the mystery of great forests exercises a spell  peculiarly its own. But all these, at one point or another, somewhere link  on intimately with human life and human experience. They stir  comprehensible, even if alarming, emotions. They tend on the whole to  exalt.    With this multitude of willows, however, it was something far different, I  felt. Some essence emanated from them that besieged the heart. A sense of  awe awakened, true, but of awe touched somewhere by a vague terror. Their  serried ranks, growing everywhere darker about me as the shadows deepened,  moving furiously yet softly in the wind, woke in me the curious and  unwelcome suggestion that we had trespassed here upon the borders of an  alien world, a world where we were intruders, a world where we were not  wanted or invited to remain--where we ran grave risks perhaps!    The feeling, however, though it refused to yield its meaning entirely to  analysis, did not at the time trouble me by passing into menace. Yet it  never left me quite, even during the very practical business of putting up  the tent in a hurricane of wind and building a fire for the stew-pot. It  remained, just enough to bother and perplex, and to rob a most delightful  camping-ground of a good portion of its charm. To my companion, however, I  said nothing, for he was a man I considered devoid of imagination. In the  first place, I could never have explained to him what I meant, and in the  second, he would have laughed stupidly at me if I had.    There was a slight depression in the center of the island, and here we  pitched the tent. The surrounding willows broke the wind a bit.    \"A poor camp,\" observed the imperturbable Swede when at last the tent stood  upright, \"no stones and precious little firewood. I'm for moving on early  tomorrow--eh? This sand won't hold anything.\"    But the experience of a collapsing tent at midnight had taught us many  devices, and we made the cozy gipsy house as safe as possible, and then set  about collecting a store of wood to last till bed-time. Willow bushes drop  no branches, and driftwood was our only source of supply. We hunted the  shores pretty thoroughly. Everywhere the banks were crumbling as the rising  flood tore at them and carried away great portions with a splash and a  gurgle.    \"The island's much smaller than when we landed,\" said the accurate Swede.  \"It won't last long at this rate. We'd better drag the canoe close to the  tent, and be ready to start at a moment's notice. I shall sleep in my  clothes.\"    He was a little distance off, climbing along the bank, and I heard his  rather jolly laugh as he spoke.    \"By Jove!\" I heard him call, a moment later, and turned to see what had  caused his exclamation. But for the moment he was hidden by the willows,  and I could not find him.    \"What in the world's this?\" I heard him cry again, and this time his voice  had become serious.    I ran up quickly and joined him on the bank. He was looking over the river,  pointing at something in the water.    \"Good heavens, it's a man's body!\" he cried excitedly. \"Look!\"    A black thing, turning over and over in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11440"],[0,"Tales of Three Hemispheres (#2)"],[1,"wold to end at the dreaded door  of the queer grey house called wold-hut.    When he came to the door of wold-hut he would give the postman's knock  as though he came on ordinary rounds to a house of every day, although  no path led up to it, although the skins of weasels hung thickly from  upper windows.    And scarcely had his postman's knock rung through the dark of the  house when the eldest of the three grim men would always run to the  door.  O, what a face had he.  There was more slyness in it than ever  his beard could hide.  He would put out a gristly hand; and into it  Amuel Sleggins would put the letter from China, and rejoice that his  duty was done, and would turn and stride away.  And the fields lit up  before him, but, ominous, eager and low murmuring arose in the  wold-hut.    For seven years this was so and no harm had come to Sleggins, seven  times he had gone to wold-hut and as often come safely away; and then  he needs must marry.  Perhaps because she was young, perhaps because  she was fair or because she had shapely ankles as she came one day  through the marshes among the milkmaid flowers shoeless in spring.  Less things than these have brought men to their ends and been the  nooses with which Fate snared them running.  With marriage curiosity  entered his house, and one day as they walked with evening through the  meadows, one summer evening, she asked him of wold-hut where he only  went, and what the folks were like that no one else had seen. All this  he told her; and then she asked him of the green letter from China,  that came with autumn, and what the letter contained.  He read to her  all the rules of the Inland Revenue, he told her he did not know, that  it was not right that he should know, he lectured her on the sin of  inquisitiveness, he quoted Parson, and in the end she said that she  must know.  They argued concerning this for many days, days of the  ending of summer, of shortening evenings, and as they argued autumn  grew nearer and nearer and the green letter from China.    And at last he promised that when the green letter came he would take  it as usual to the lonely house and then hide somewhere near and creep  to the window at nightfall and hear what the grim folk said; perhaps  they might read aloud the letter from China.  And before he had time  to repent of that promise a cold wind came one night and the woods  turned golden, the plover went in bands at evening over the marshes,  the year had turned, and there came the letter from China. Never  before had Amuel felt such misgivings as he went his postman's rounds,  never before had he so much feared the day that took him up to the  wold and the lonely house, while snug by the fire his wife looked  pleasurably forward to curiosity's gratification and hoped to have  news ere nightfall that all the gossips of the village would envy.  One consolation only had Amuel as he set out with a shiver, there was  a letter that day for the last house in the lane.  Long did he tarry  there to look at their cheery faces, to hear the sound of their  laughter--you did not hear laughter in wold-hut--and when the last  topic had been utterly talked out and no excuse for lingering remained  he heaved a heavy sigh and plodded grimly away and so came late to  wold-hut.    He gave his postman's knock on the shut oak door, heard it reverberate  through the silent house, saw the grim elder man and his gristly hand,  gave up the green letter from China, and strode away. There is a clump  of trees growing all alone in the wold, desolate, mournful, by day, by  night full of ill omen, far off from all other trees as wold-hut from  other houses.  Near it stands wold-hut.  Not today did Amuel stride  briskly on with all the new winds of autumn blowing cheerily past him  till he saw the village before him and broke into song; but as soon as  he was out of sight of the house he turned and stooping behind a fold  of the ground ran back to the desolate wood.  There he waited watching  the evil house, just too far to hear voices.  The sun was low already.  He chose the window at which he meant to eavesdrop, a little barred  one at the back, close to the ground.  And then the pigeons came in;  for a great distance there was no other wood, so numbers shelter  there, though the clump is small and of so evil a look (if they notice  that); the first one frightened Amuel, he felt that it might be a  spirit escaped from torture in some dim parlour of the house that he  watched, his nerves were strained and he feared foolish fears.  Then  he grew used to them and the sun set then and the aspect of everything  altered and he felt strange fears again.  Behind him was a hollow in  the wold, he watched it darkening; and before him he saw the house  through the trunks of the trees.  He waited for them to light their  lamps so that they could not see, when he would steal up softly and  crouch by the little back window.  But though every bird was home,  though the night grew chilly as tombs, though a star was out, still  there shone no yellow light from any window.  Amuel waited and  shuddered.  He did not dare to move till they lit their lamps, they  might be watching.  The damp and the cold so strangely affected him  that autumn evening and the remnants of sunset, the stars and the wold  and the whole vault of the sky seemed like a hall that they had  prepared for Fear.  He began to feel a dread of prodigious things, and  still no light shone in the evil house.  It grew so dark that he  decided to move and make his way to the window in spite of the  stillness and though the house was dark.  He rose and while standing  arrested by pains that cramped his limbs, he heard the door swing open  on the far side of the house.  He had just time to hide behind the  trunk of a pine when the three grim men approached him and the woman  hobbled behind.  Right to the ominous clump of trees they came as  though they loved their blackness, passed through within a yard or two  of the postman and squatted down on their haunches in a ring in the  hollow behind the trees.  They lit a fire in the hollow and laid a kid  on the fire and by the light of it Amuel saw brought forth from an  untanned pouch the letter that came from China. The elder opened it  with his gristly hand and intoning words that Amuel did not know, drew  out from it a green powder and sprinkled it on the fire.  At once a  flame arose and a wonderful savour, the flames rose higher and  flickered turning the trees all green; and Amuel saw the gods coming  to snuff the savour. While the three grim men prostrated themselves by  their fire, and the horrible woman that was the spouse of one, he saw  the gods coming gauntly over the wold, beheld the gods of Old England  hungrily snuffing the savour, Odin, Balder, and Thor, the gods of the  ancient people, beheld them eye to eye clear and close in the  twilight, and the office of postman fell vacant in  Otford-under-the-Wold.          THE PRAYER OF BOOB AHEERA    In the harbour, between the liner and the palms, as the huge ship's  passengers came up from dinner, at moonrise, each in his canoe, Ali  Kareeb Ahash and Boob Aheera passed within knife thrust.    So urgent was the purpose of Ali Kareeb Ahash that he did not lean  over as his enemy slid by, did not tarry then to settle that long  account; but that Boob Aheera made no attempt to reach him was a  source of wonder to Ali.  He pondered it till the liner's electric  lights shone far away behind him with one blaze and the canoe was near  to his destination, and pondered it in vain, for all that the eastern  subtlety of his mind was able to tell him clearly was that it was not  like Boob Aheera to pass him like that.    That Boob Aheera could have dared to lay such a cause as his before  the Diamond Idol Ali had not conceived, yet as he drew near to the  golden shrine in the palms, that none that come by the great ships  ever found, he began to see more clearly in his mind that this was  where Boob had gone on that hot night.  And when he beached his canoe  his fears departed, giving place to the resignation with which he  always viewed Destiny; for there on the white sea sand were the tracks  of another canoe, the edges all fresh and ragged.  Boob Aheera had  been before him.  Ali did not blame himself for being late, the thing  had been planned before the beginning of time, by gods that knew their  business; only his hate of Boob Aheera increased, his enemy against  whom he had come to pray.  And the more his hate increased the more  clearly he saw him, until nothing else could be seen by the eye of his  mind but the dark lean figure, the little lean legs, the grey beard  and neat loin-cloth of Boob Aheera, his enemy.    That the Diamond Idol should have granted the prayers of such a one he  did not as yet imagine, he hated him merely for his presumptuousness  in approaching the shrine at all, for approaching it before him whose  cause was righteous, for many an old past wrong, but most of all for  the expression of his face and the general look of the man as he has  swept by in his canoe with his double paddle going in the moonlight.    Ali pushed through the steaming vegetation.  The place smelt of  orchids.  There is no track to the shrine though many go.  If there  were a track the white man would one day find it, and parties would  row to see it whenever a liner came in; and photographs would appear  in weekly papers with accounts of it underneath by men who had never  left London, and all the mystery would be gone away and there would be  nothing novel in this story.    Ali had scarcely gone a hundred yards through cactus and creeper  underneath the palms when he came to the golden shrine that nothing  guards except the deeps of the forest, and found the Diamond Idol. The  Diamond Idol is five inches high and its base a good inch square, and  it has a greater lustre than those diamonds that Mr. Moses"]]]
