[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15323"],[0,"The Green Eyes of BÃ¢st (#2)"],[1,"the garage.\"    We walked along together to where, set back in a recess, I had often  observed the doors of a garage evidently added to the building by some  recent occupier. Dangling from a key placed in the lock was a ring to  which another key was attached!    \"Well, I'm blowed,\" said Bolton, \"this _is_ a funny go, this is.\"    He unlocked the door and swept the interior of the place with a ray of  light cast by his lantern. There were one or two petrol cans and some  odd lumber suggesting that the garage had been recently used, but no  car, and indeed nothing of sufficient value to have interested even  such a derelict as the man whom we had passed some ten minutes before.  That is if I except a large and stoutly-made packing-case which  rested only a foot or so from the entrance so as partly to block it,  and which from its appearance might possibly have contained spare  parts. I noticed, with vague curiosity, a device crudely representing  a seated cat which was painted in green upon the case.    \"If there ever was anything here,\" said Bolton, \"it's been pinched and  we're locking the stable door after the horse has gone. You'll bear me  out, sir, if there's any complaint?\"    \"Certainly,\" I replied. \"Technically I shall be trespassing if I come  in with you, so I shall say good night.\"    \"Good night, sir,\" cried the constable, and entering the empty garage,  he closed the door behind him.    I set off briskly alone towards the cottage which I had made my home.  I have since thought that the motives which had induced me to choose  this secluded residence were of a peculiarly selfish order. Whilst I  liked sometimes to be among my fellowmen and whilst I rarely missed an  important first night in London, my inherent weakness for obscure  studies and another motive to which I may refer later had caused me to  abandon my chambers in the Temple and to retire with my library to  this odd little backwater where my only link with Fleet Street, with  the land of theaters and clubs and noise and glitter, was the  telephone. I scarcely need add that I had sufficient private means to  enable me to indulge these whims, otherwise as a working journalist I  must have been content to remain nearer to the heart of things. As it  was I followed the careless existence of the independent free-lance,  and since my work was accounted above the average I was enabled to  pick and choose the subjects with which I should deal. Mine was not an  ambitious nature--or it may have been that stimulus was lacking--and  all I wrote I wrote for the mere joy of writing, whilst my studies, of  which I shall have occasion to speak presently, were not of a nature  calculated to swell my coffers in this commercial-minded age.    Little did I know how abruptly this chosen calm of my life was to be  broken nor how these same studies were to be turned in a new and  strange direction. But if on this night which was to witness the  overture of a horrible drama, I had not hitherto experienced any  premonition of the coming of those dark forces which were to change  the whole tenor of my existence, suddenly, now, in sight of the elm  tree which stood before my cottage the _shadow_ reached me.    Only thus can I describe a feeling otherwise unaccountable which  prompted me to check my steps and to listen. A gust of wind had just  died away, leaving the night silent save for the dripping of rain from  the leaves and the vague and remote roar of the town. Once, faintly, I  thought I detected the howling of a dog. I had heard nothing in the  nature of following footsteps, yet, turning swiftly, I did not doubt  that I should detect the presence of a follower of some kind. This  conviction seized me suddenly and, as I have said, unaccountably. Nor  was I wrong in my surmise.    Fifty yards behind me a vaguely defined figure showed for an instant  outlined against the light of a distant lamp--ere melting into the  dense shadow cast by a clump of trees near the roadside.    Standing quite still, I stared in the direction of the patch of shadow  for several moments. It may be said that there was nothing to occasion  alarm or even curiosity in the appearance of a stray pedestrian at  that hour; for it was little after midnight. Indeed thus I argued with  myself, whereby I admit that at sight of that figure I had experienced  a sensation which was compounded not only of alarm and curiosity but  also of some other emotion which even now I find it hard to define.  Instantly I knew that the lithe shape, glimpsed but instantaneously,  was that of no chance pedestrian--was indeed that of no ordinary  being. At the same moment I heard again, unmistakably, the howling of  a dog.    Having said so much, why should I not admit that, turning again very  quickly, I hurried on to the gate of my cottage and heaved a great  sigh of relief when I heard the reassuring bang of the door as I  closed it behind me? Coates, my batman, had turned in, having placed a  cold repast upon the table in the little dining-room; but although I  required nothing to eat I partook of a stiff whisky and soda, idly  glancing at two or three letters which lay upon the table.    They proved to contain nothing of very great importance, and having  smoked a final cigarette, I turned out the light in the dining-room  and walked into the bedroom--for the cottage was of bungalow  pattern--and, crossing the darkened room, stood looking out of the  window.    It commanded a view of a little kitchen-garden and beyond of a high  hedge, with glimpses of sentinel trees lining the main road. The wind  had dropped entirely, but clouds were racing across the sky at a  tremendous speed so that the nearly full moon alternately appeared and  disappeared, producing an ever-changing effect of light and shadow. At  one moment a moon-bathed prospect stretched before me as far as the  eye could reach, in the next I might have been looking into a cavern  as some angry cloud swept across the face of the moon to plunge the  scene into utter darkness.    And it was during such a dark spell and at the very moment that I  turned aside to light the lamp that I saw _the eyes_.    From a spot ten yards removed, low down under the hedges bordering the  garden, they looked up at me--those great, glittering cat's eyes, so  that I stifled an exclamation, drawing back instinctively from the  window. A tiger, I thought, or some kindred wild beast, must have  escaped from captivity. And so rapidly does the mind work at such  times that instinctively I had reviewed the several sporting pieces in  my possession and had selected a rifle which had proved serviceable in  India ere I had taken one step towards the door.    Before that step could be taken the light of the moon again flooded  the garden; and although there was no opening in the hedge by which  even a small animal could have retired, no living thing was in sight!  But, near and remote, dogs were howling mournfully.          CHAPTER II    THE SIGN OF THE CAT      When Coates brought in my tea, newspapers and letters in the morning,  I awakened with a start, and:    \"Has there been any rain during the night, Coates?\" I asked.    Coates, whose unruffled calm at all times provided an excellent  sedative, replied:    \"Not since a little before midnight, sir.\"    \"Ah!\" said I, \"and have you been in the garden this morning, Coates?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" he replied, \"for raspberries for breakfast, sir.\"    \"But not on this side of the cottage?\"    \"Not on this side.\"    \"Then will you step out, Coates, keeping carefully to the paths, and  proceed as far as the tool-shed? Particularly note if the beds have  been disturbed between the hedge and the path, but don't make any  marks yourself. You are looking for _spoor_, you understand?\"    \"Spoor? Very good, sir. Of big game?\"    \"Of big game, yes, Coates.\"    Unmoved by the strangeness of his instructions, Coates, an  object-lesson for those who decry the excellence of British Army  disciplinary methods, departed.    It was with not a little curiosity and interest that I awaited his  report. As I sat sipping my tea I could hear his regular tread as he  passed along the garden path outside the window. Then it ceased and  was followed by a vague muttering. He had found something. All traces  of the storm had disappeared and there was every indication of a  renewal of the heat-wave; but I knew that the wet soil would have  preserved a perfect impression of any imprint made upon it on the  previous night. Nevertheless, with the early morning sun streaming  into my window out of a sky as near to turquoise as I had ever seen it  in England, I found it impossible to recapture that uncanny thrill  which had come to me in the dark hours when out of the shadows under  the hedge the great cat's eyes had looked up at me.    And now, becoming more fully awake, I remembered something else which  hitherto I had not associated with the latter phenomenon. I remembered  that lithe and evasive pursuing shape which I had detected behind me  on the road. Even now, however, it was difficult to associate one with  the other; for whereas the dimly-seen figure had resembled that of a  man (or, more closely, that of a woman) the eyes had looked out upon  me from a point low down near the ground, like those of some crouching  feline.    Coates' footsteps sounded again upon the path and I heard him walking  round the cottage and through the kitchen. Finally he reentered the  bedroom and stood just within the doorway in that attitude of  attention which was part and parcel of the man. His appearance would  doubtless have violated the proprieties of the Albany, for in my rural  retreat he was called upon to perform other and more important  services than those of a valet. His neatly shaved chin, stolid red  countenance and perfectly brushed hair were unexceptionable of course,  but because his duties would presently take him into the garden he  wore, not the regulation "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15344"],[0,"Grace Harlowe's Sophomore Year at High School (#2)"],[1,"games that season, and the sophomores had made up their  minds to win all of them. What if the junior team were a famous one, and  had won victory after victory the year before over all other class teams?  The sophomores resolved to be famous, too.    In fact, all of Grace's hopes were centered on the coming season. Napoleon  himself could not have been more eager for victory.    \"We must just make up our minds to work, girls,\" she exhorted her friends.  \"I would rather beat those juniors than take a trip to Europe.\"    Nor was she alone in her desire. The other girls were just as eager to  overthrow the victorious juniors. It was evident, so strong was the  feeling in the class, that something more than a sense of sport had  stirred them to this degree of rivalry.    The former freshman class had many scores against the present juniors. As  sophomores, the winter before, they had never missed an opportunity to  annoy and irritate the freshmen in a hundred disagreeable ways. \"The  Black Monks of Asia\" still rankled in their memories. Moreover, was not  Julia Crosby, the junior captain? She was the same mischievous sophomore  who had created so much havoc at the Christmas ball. She was always  playing unkind practical jokes on other people. It is true, she was an  intimate and close friend of Miriam Nesbit, but they all were aware that  Miriam was a law unto herself, and none of them had ever attempted to  explain certain doings of hers in connection with Julia Crosby and her  friends during the freshman year.    Grace's mind was busy with these thoughts when the door of the gymnasium  opened noisily. There was a whoop followed by cries and calls and in  rushed the junior players, most of them dressed in gymnasium suits.    Julia Crosby, at their head, had come with so much force, that she now  slid halfway across the room, landing right in the midst of the  sophomores.    \"I beg your pardon,\" said Grace, who had been almost knocked down by the  encounter, \"I suppose you did not notice us. But you see, now, that we are  in the midst of practising. The gym. is ours for the afternoon.\"    Julia Crosby looked at her insolently and laughed.    How irritating that laugh had always been to the rival class of younger  girls. It had a dozen different shades of meaning in it--a nasty,  condescending contemptuous laugh, Grace thought, and such qualities had no  right to be put in a laugh at all, since laughing is meant to show  pleasure and nothing else. But Julia Crosby always laughed at the wrong  time; especially when there was nothing at which to laugh.    \"Who said the gym. was yours for the afternoon?\" she asked.    \"Miss Thompson said so,\" answered Grace. \"I asked her, this morning, and  she gave us permission, as she did to you last Monday, when the boys were  all out at the football grounds.\"    \"Have you a written permission?\" asked Julia Crosby, laughing again, so  disagreeably that hot-headed Nora was obliged to turn away to keep from  saying something unworthy of herself.    \"No,\" answered Grace, endeavoring to be calm under these trying  circumstances, but her voice trembling nevertheless with anger. \"No, I  have no written permission and you had none last Monday. You know as well  as I do that the boys principal is willing to lend us the gym. as often as  we like during football season, when it is not much in use; and that Miss  Thompson tries to divide the time as evenly as possible among the girls.\"    \"I don't know anything about that, Miss Harlowe,\" said Julia Crosby. \"But  I do know that you and your team will have to give up the gymnasium at  once, because our team is in a hurry to begin practising.\"    Then a great chattering arose. Every sophomore there except Miriam Nesbit  raised a protesting voice. Grace held up her hand for silence, then  summoning all her dignity she turned to Julia Crosby.    \"Miss Crosby,\" she said, \"you have evidently made a mistake. We have had  permission to use the gymnasium this afternoon, which I feel sure you have  not had. It was neither polite nor kind to break in upon us as you did,  and the least you can do is to go away quietly without interrupting us  further.\"    \"Really, Miss Harlowe,\" said Julia Crosby, and again her tantalizing laugh  rang out, \"you are entirely too hasty in your supposition. As it happens,  I have the best right in the world to bring my team to the gym. this  afternoon. So, little folks,\" looking from one sophomore to another in a  way that was fairly maddening, \"run away and play somewhere else.\"    \"Miss Crosby,\" cried Grace, now thoroughly angry, \"I insist on knowing  from whom you received permission. It was not granted by Miss Thompson.\"    \"Oh, I did not stop at Miss Thompson's. I went to a higher authority. Mr.  Cole, the boys' principal, gave me a written permission. Here it is. Do  you care to read it?\" and Julia thrust the offending paper before Grace's  eyes.    This was the last straw. Grace dashed the paper to the floor, and turned  with flashing eyes to her tormentor.    \"Miss Crosby,\" she said, \"if Professor Cole had known that Miss Thompson  had given me permission to use the gymnasium, he would never have given  you this paper. You obtained it by a trick, which is your usual method of  gaining your ends. But I want you to understand that the sophomore class  will not tamely submit to such impositions. We evened our score with you  as freshmen, and we shall do it again this year as sophomores.  Furthermore, we mean to win every basketball game of the series, for we  should consider being beaten by the juniors the deepest possible disgrace.  I regret that we have agreed to play against an unworthy foe.\"    With her head held high, Grace walked from the gymnasium, followed by the  other members of her team, who were too indignant to notice that Miriam  had remained behind.          CHAPTER II    THE WAY OF THE TRANSGRESSOR      Once outside the gymnasium, Grace's dignity forsook her, and she felt a  wild desire to kick and scream like a small child. The contemptible  conduct of the junior team filled her with just rage. With a great effort  at self-control she turned to the other girls, who were holding an  indignation meeting in the corridor.    \"Girls,\" she said, \"I know just how you feel about this, and if we had  been boys there would have been a hand-to-hand conflict in the gymnasium  to-day.\"    \"I wish we hadn't given in,\" said Nora, almost sobbing with anger.    \"There was really nothing else to do,\" said Anne. \"It is better to retire  with dignity than to indulge in a free-for-all fight.\"    \"Yes,\" responded Grace, \"it is. But when that insufferable Julia Crosby  poked Professor Cole's permit under my nose, I felt like taking her by the  shoulders and shaking her. What those juniors need is a good, sound  thrashing. That being utterly out of the question, the only thing to do is  to whitewash them at basketball.\"    \"Three cheers for the valiant sophomores!\" cried Nora, \"On to victory!  Down with juniors!\"    The cheers were given with a will, and by common consent the crowd of  girls moved on down the corridor that led to the locker room.    The sophomore locker room was the particular rendezvous of that class in  general. Here matters of state were discussed, class gossip retailed, and  class friendships cemented. It was in reality a sort of clubroom, and dear  to the heart of every girl in the class. To the girls in their present  state of mind it seemed the only place to go. They seated themselves on  the benches and Grace took the floor.    \"Attention, fellow citizens and basketball artists,\" she called. \"Do you  solemnly promise to exert yourselves to the utmost to repay the juniors  for this afternoon's work?\"    \"We do,\" was the answer.    \"And will you pledge your sacred honor to whip the juniors, no matter what  happens!\"    \"We will,\" responded the girls.    \"Anne!\" called Grace. \"You and Jessica are not players, but you can pledge  your loyalty to the team anyhow. I want you to be in this, too. Hold up  your right hands.\"    \"We will be loyal,\" said both girls, holding up their right hands,  laughing meanwhile at Grace's serious expression.    \"Now,\" said Grace, \"I feel better. As long as we can't get the actual  practice this afternoon let's lay out a course of action at any rate, and  arrange our secret signals.\"    \"Done,\" cried the girls, and soon they were deep in the mysteries of  secret plays and signs.    Grace explained the game to Anne, who did not incline towards athletics,  and had had little previous opportunity to enjoy them.    Anne, eager to learn for Grace's sake, became interested on her own  account, and soon mastered the main points of the game.    \"Here is a list of the secret signals, Anne,\" said Grace. \"Study it  carefully and learn it by heart, then you will understand every move our  team makes during the coming games. I expect you to become an enthusiastic  fan.\"    Anne thanked her, and put the paper in her purse, little dreaming how much  unhappiness that same paper was to cause her.    The business of the afternoon having been disposed of, the girls donned  street clothing and left the building, schoolgirl fashion, in groups of  twos and threes.    On the way out they encountered several of the victorious juniors, who  managed to make their presence felt.    \"Oh,\" said Nora O'Malley, \"those girls ought to be suppressed.\"    \"Never mind,\" put in Anne. \"You know 'the way of the transgressor is  hard.' Perhaps those juniors will get what they deserve yet.\"    \"Not much danger of it. They're too tricky,\" said Jessica contemptuously.    Anne's prophecy was to be fulfilled, however, in a most unexpected manner.    There had been one unnoticed spectator of the recent quarrel between the  two classes. This was the teacher of physical culture, Miss Kane, who had  returned to the gymnasium for a moment, arriving just in time to witness  the whole scene. She, too, had had trouble at"]]]
