No, indeed; not another minute that she could help! And he  would sleep there till all hours of the morning; he had done it before;  the longer the better, this time.    She had recoiled into the narrow hall, driven by an uncontrollable  revulsion; and there she stood, pale and quivering with a disgust that  only deepened as she looked her last upon the shaded face and the  inanimate frame in the chair. Rachel could not account for the intensity  of her feeling; it bordered upon nausea, and for a time prevented her  from retracing the single step which at length enabled her to shut both  doors as quietly as she had opened them, after switching off the light  from force of habit. There was another light still glowing in the hall,  and, again from habit, Rachel put it out also before setting foot upon  the stairs. A moment later she was standing terror-stricken in the dark.    It was no sound from the study, but the tiniest of metallic rattles from  the flap of the letter-box in the front door. The wind might have done  it, for the flap had lost its spring; and, though the noise was not  repeated, to the wind Rachel put it down, as she mounted the stairs at  last in a flutter that caused her both shame and apprehension. Her nerve  was going, and she needed it so! It should not go; it should not; and as  if to steady it, she opened the landing window, and spent some minutes  gazing out into the cool and starry night. Not that she could see very  far. The backs of houses hid half the stars in front and on either hand,  making, with the back of this house and its fellows, a kind of square  turned inside out. Miserable little gardens glimmered through an  irregular network of grimy walls, with here and there a fair tree in  autumnal tatters; but Rachel looked neither at these nor at the stars  that lit them dimly. In a single window of those right opposite a single  lamp had burnt all night. It was the only earthly light that Rachel  could see, the only one of earth or heaven upon which she looked; and  she discovered it with thanksgiving, and tore her eyes away from it with  a prayer.    In time the trunk was packed, and incontinently carried downstairs, by  an effort which left Rachel racked in every muscle and swaying giddily.  But she could not have made much noise, for still there was no sign from  the study. She scarcely paused to breathe. A latchkey closed the door  behind her very softly; she was in the crisp, clean air at last.    But it was no hour for finding cabs; it was the hour of the scavenger  and no other being; and Rachel walked into broad sunlight before she  spied a solitary hansom. It was then she did the strangest thing;  instead of driving straight back for her trunk, when near the house she  gave the cabman other directions, subsequently stopping him at one with  a card in the window.    A woman answered the bell with surprising celerity, and a face first  startled and then incensed at the sight of Mrs. Minchin.    \"So you never came!\" cried the woman, bitterly.    \"I was prevented,\" Rachel replied coldly. \"Well?\"    And the monosyllable was a whisper.    \"He is still alive,\" said the woman at the door.    \"Is that all?\" asked Rachel, a catch in her voice.    \"It is all I'll say till the doctor has been.\"    \"But he has got through the night,\" sighed Rachel, thankfully. \"I could  see the light in his room from hour to hour, even though I could not  come. Did you sit up with him all night long?\"    \"Every minute of the night,\" said the other, with undisguised severity  in her fixed red eyes. \"I never left him, and I never closed a lid.\"    \"I am so sorry!\" cried Rachel, too sorry even for renewed indignation at  the cause. \"But I couldn't help it,\" she continued, \"I really could not.  We--I am going abroad--very suddenly. Poor Mr. Severino! I do wish there  was anything I could do! But you must get a professional nurse. And when  he does recover--for something assures me that he will--you can tell  him--\"    Rachel hesitated, the red eyes reading hers.    \"Tell him I hope he will recover altogether,\" she said at length; \"mind,  altogether! I have gone away for good, tell Mr. Severino; but, as I  wasn't able to do so after all, I would rather you didn't mention that I  ever thought of nursing him, or that I called last thing to ask how he  was.\"    And that was her farewell message to the very young man with whom a  hole-and-corner scandal had coupled Rachel Minchin's name; it was to be  a final utterance in yet another respect, and one of no slight or  private significance, as the sequel will show. Within a minute or two of  its delivery, Rachel was on her own doorstep for the last time, deftly  and gently turning the latchkey, while the birds sang to frenzy in a  neighboring garden, and the early sun glanced fierily from the brass  knocker and letter-box. Another moment and the door had been flung wide  open by a police officer, who seemed to fill the narrow hall, with a  comrade behind him and both servants on the stairs. And with little  further warning Mrs. Minchin was shown her husband, seated much as she  had left him in the professor's chair, but with his feet raised stiffly  upon another, and the hand of death over every inch of him in the broad  north light that filled the room.    The young widow stood gazing upon her dead, and four pairs of eyes gazed  yet more closely at her. But there was little to gather from the  strained profile with the white cheek and the unyielding lips. Not a cry  had left them; she had but crossed the threshold, and stopped that  instant in the middle of the worn carpet, the sharpest of silhouettes  against a background of grim tomes. There was no swaying of the lissome  figure, no snatching for support, no question spoken or unspoken. In  moments of acute surprise the most surprising feature is often the way  in which we ourselves receive the shock; a sudden and complete  detachment, not the least common of immediate results, makes us  sometimes even conscious of our failure to feel as we would or should;  and it was so with Rachel Minchin in the first moments of her tragic  freedom. So God had sundered whom God had joined together! And this was  the man whom she had married for love; and she could look upon his clay  unmoved! Her mind leapt to a minor consideration, that still made her  shudder, as eight eyes noted from the door; he must have been dead when  she came down and found him seated in shadow; she had misjudged the  dead, if not the living. The pose of the head was unaltered, the chin  upon the chest, the mouth closed in death as naturally as in sleep. No  wonder his wife had been deceived. And yet there was something  unfamiliar, something negligent and noble, and all unlike the living  man; so that Rachel could already marvel that she had not at once  detected this dignity and this distinction, only too foreign to her  husband as she had learnt to know him best, but unattainable in the  noblest save by death. And her eyes had risen to the slice of sky in the  upper half of the window, and at last the tears were rising in her eyes,  when they filled instead with sudden horror and enlightenment.    There was a jagged hole in the pane above the hasp; an upset of ink on  the desk beneath the window; and the ink was drying with the dead man's  blood, in which she now perceived him to be soaked, while the newspaper  on the floor beside him was crisp as toast from that which it had hidden  when she saw him last.    \"Murdered!\" whispered Rachel, breaking her long silence with a gasp.  \"The work of thieves!\"    The policemen exchanged a rapid glance.    \"Looks like it,\" said the one who had opened the door, \"I admit.\"    There was a superfluous dryness in his tone; but Rachel no more noticed  this than the further craning of heads in the doorway.    \"But can you doubt it?\" she cried, pointing from the broken window to  the spilled ink. \"Did you think that he had shot himself?\"    And her horror heightened at a thought more terrible to her than all the  rest. But the constable shook his head.    \"We should have found the pistol--which we can't,\" said he. \"But shot he  is, and through the heart.\"    \"Then who could it be but thieves?\"    \"That's what we all want to know,\" said the officer; and still Rachel  had no time to think about his tone; for now she was bending over the  body, her white hands clenched, and agony enough in her white face.    \"Look! look!\" she cried, beckoning to them all. \"He was wearing his  watch last night; that I can swear; and it has gone!\"    \"You are sure he was wearing it?\" asked the same constable, approaching.    \"Absolutely certain.\"    \"Well, if that's so,\" said he, \"and it can't be found, it will be a  point in your favor.\"    Rachel sprang upright, her wet eyes wide with pure astonishment.    \"In my favor?\" she cried. \"Will you have the goodness to explain  yourself?\"    The constables were standing on either side of her now.    \"Well,\" replied the spokesman of the pair, \"I don't like the way that  window's broken, for one thing, and if you look at it you'll see what I  mean. The broken glass is all outside on the sill. But that's not all,  ma'am; and, as you have a cab, we might do worse than drive to the  station before more people are about.\"          CHAPTER II    THE CASE FOR THE CROWN      It was years since there had been a promise of such sensation at the Old  Bailey, and never, perhaps, was competition keener for the very few  seats available in that antique theatre of justice. Nor, indeed, could  the most enterprising of modern managers, with the star of all the  stages at his beck for the shortest of seasons, have done more to spread  the lady's fame, or to excite a passionate curiosity in the public mind,  than was done for Rachel Minchin by her official enemies of the  Metropolitan Police.

During the period of the great plague the office of _searcher_,  which is continued to the present day, was a very important one; and a  noted body-searcher, whose name was Snacks, finding his business  increase so fast that he could not compass it, offered to any person who  should join him in his hazardous practice, half the profits; thus those  who joined him were said to go with Snacks. Hence \"_going snacks_,\"  or dividing the spoil.[1]    ANTIPHONANT CHANTING.    St. Ambrose is considered as the first who introduced the antiphonant  method of chanting, or one side of the choir alternately responding to  the other; from whence that particular mode obtained the name of the  \"Ambrosian chant,\" while the plain song, introduced by St. Gregory,  still practised in the Romish service, is called the \"Gregorian,\" or  \"Romish chant.\" The works of St. Ambrose continue to be held in much  respect, particularly the hymn of _Te Deum_, which he is said to  have composed when he baptised St. Augustine, his celebrated convert.

COWPER.      \"I dearly love a sailor!\" exclaimed the beautiful and fascinating  Mrs. D----, as she stood in the balcony of her house, leaning upon the  arm of her affectionate and indulgent husband, and gazing at a poor  shattered tar who supplicated charity by a look that could hardly fail  of interesting the generous sympathies of the heart--\"I dearly love a  sailor; he is so truly the child of nature; and I never feel more  disposed to shed tears, than when I see the hardy veteran who has  sacrificed his youth, and even his limbs, in the service of his  country--      \"Cast abandoned on the world's wide stage,    And doomed in scanty poverty to roam.\"      Look at yon poor remnant of the tempest, probably reduced to the hard  necessity of becoming a wanderer, without a home to shelter him, or one  kind commiserating smile to shed a ray of sunshine on the dreary winter  of his life. I can remember, when a child, I had an uncle who loved me  very tenderly, and my attachment to him was almost that of a daughter;  indeed he was the pride and admiration of our village; for every one  esteemed him for his kind and cheerful disposition. But untoward events  cast a gloom upon his mind; he hastened away to sea, and we never saw  him more.\"    By this time the weather-beaten, care-worn seaman had advanced toward  the house, and cast a wistful glance aloft; it was full of honest pride  that disdained to beg, yet his appearance was so marked with every  emblem of poverty and hunger, that, as the conflicting feelings worked  within his breast, his countenance betrayed involuntarily the struggles  of his heart. There was a manly firmness in his deportment, that bespoke  no ordinary mind; and a placid serenity in his eye, that beamed with  benevolence, and seemed only to regret that he could no longer be a  friend to the poor and destitute, or share his hard-earned pittance with  a messmate in distress. A few scattered grey locks peeped from beneath  an old straw hat; and one sleeve of his jacket hung unoccupied by his  side--the arm was gone. \"I should like to know his history,\" said the  amiable lady; \"let us send for him in.\" To express a wish, and have it  gratified, were the same thing to Mrs. D----, and in a few minutes the  veteran tar stood before them. \"Would you wish to hear a tale of woe?\"  cried the old man, in answer to her request. \"Ah, no! why should your  tender heart be wounded by another's griefs? I have been buffeted by  the storms of affliction--I have struggled against the billows of  adversity--every wave of sorrow has rolled over me; but,\" added he,  while a glow of conscious integrity suffused his furrowed cheek, \"I have  always done my duty; and that conviction has buoyed me up when nearly  overwhelmed in the ocean of distress. Yet, lady, it was not always thus:  I have been happy--was esteemed, and, as I thought, beloved. I had a  friend, in whom I reposed the highest confidence, and my affections were  devoted to one;--but, she is gone--she is gone! and I--Yes! we shall  meet again:\"--here he paused, dashed a tear from his eye, and then  proceeded:--\"My friend was faithless; he robbed me of the dearest  treasure of my heart, and blasted every hope of future happiness.  I left my native land to serve my country; have fought her battles, and  bled in her defence. On the 29th of May, and glorious 1st of June, 1794,  I served on board the Queen Charlotte, under gallant Howe, and was  severely wounded in the breast--but I did my duty. On that memorable  occasion, a circumstance occured which added to my bitterness and  melancholy. The decks were cleared--the guns cast loose, and every man  stood in eager expectation at his quarters. It is an awful moment, lady,  and various conflicting emotions agitate the breast when, in the calm  stillness that reigns fore and aft, the mind looks back upon the past,  and contemplates the future. Home, wife, children, and every tender  remembrance rush upon the soul. It is different in the heat of action:  then every faculty is employed for conquest, that each man may have to  say, 'I have done my duty.' But when bearing down to engage, and silence  is so profound that every whisper may be heard, then their state of  mind--it cannot be described. Sailors know what it is, and conquering it  by cool determination and undaunted bravery, nobly do their duty. I was  stationed at the starboard side of the quarter deck, and looked around  me with feelings incident to human nature, yet wishing for and courting  death. The admiral, with calm composure, surrounded by his captains and  signal officers, stood upon the beak of the poop, while brave Bowen, the  master, occupied the ladder, and gave directions to the quarter-master  at the helm. They opened their fire, and the captains of the guns stood  ready with their matches in their hand, waiting for the word. The work  of destruction commenced, and many of our shipmates lay bleeding on the  deck, but not a shot had we returned.\" \"Stand by there, upon the main  deck,\" cried the first lieutenant. \"Steady, my men! Wait for command,  and don't throw your fire away!\" \"All ready, sir,\" was responded fore  and aft. At this moment a seaman advanced upon the quarter-deck, attended  by a young lad (one of the fore-top men) whose pale face and quivering  lip betrayed the tremulous agitation of fear. The lieutenant gazed at  him for a few seconds with marked contempt and indignation, but all  stood silent. The officer turned towards the admiral, and on again  looking round, perceived that the lad had fainted, and lay lifeless in  the seaman's arms, who gazed upon the bloodless countenance of his  charge with a look of anguish and despair. \"Carry him below,\" said the  lieutenant, \"and let him skulk from his duty; this day must be a day of  glory!\" The poor fellow seemed unconscious that he was spoken to, but  still continued to gaze upon the lad. The officer beckoned to a couple  of men, who immediately advanced, and were about to execute his orders,  when the seaman put them back with his hand, exclaiming, 'No! _she_  is mine, and we will live or die together!' Oh! lady, what a scene was  that! The frown quitted the lieutenant's brow, and a tear trembled in  his eye. The generous Howe and his brave companions gathered round, and  there was not a heart that did not feel what it was to be beloved. Yes!  mine alone was dreary, like the lightning-blasted wreck. We were rapidly  approaching the French admiral's ship, the Montague: the main decks  fired, and the lower deck followed the example. The noise brought her to  her recollection; she gazed wildly on all, and then clinging closer to  her lover, sought relief in tears. 'T----,' said his lordship, mildly,  'this must not be--Go, go, my lad; see her safe in the cockpit, and then  I know that you will do your duty.' A smile of animation lighted up his  agitated face. 'I will! I will!' cried he, God bless your lordship, I  will! for I have _always_ done my duty;'--and taking his trembling  burthen in his arms, supported her to a place of safety. In a few  minutes he was again at his gun, and assisted in pouring the first  raking broadside into our opponents stern. Since that time I have served  in most of the general actions; and knelt by the side of the hero  Nelson, when he resigned himself to the arms of death. But, whether  stationed upon deck amidst the blood and slaughter of battle--the  shrieks of the wounded, and groans of the dying--or clinging to the  shrouds during the tempestuous howling of the storm, while the wild  waves were beating over me--whether"]]]
