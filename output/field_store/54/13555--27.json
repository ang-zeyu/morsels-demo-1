All this shows a plain simple belief in the  persistence of the life of a man as distinguished from the body  --a belief widely prevalent among primitive people.  It contains  nothing unusual, and is probably perfectly explicable psychologically  by means of dreams.    There is little or no change in this underlying belief to be  observed in the burial customs of the Egyptians during the late  predynastic period.  Copper weapons and implements succeed stone  in the graves.  All those objects in whose manufacture the new  tools are used show changes of technique and form.  It is even  curious to note that some of the older stone and flint objects,  some of the older pots and pans, are still made as a matter of  tradition.  The importance of this is not to be overlooked.  For  centuries men had used flint knives and they had baked their  bread in flat mud saucers set in the ashes.  For the centuries  these flint knives and these cakes with their saucers had been  placed in the graves.  Gradually metal knives and better bread  pans displaced these more primitive objects in daily life; but  the older primitive objects were still placed in the graves as a  matter of tradition.    It must be remembered, of course, that these traditional objects  were also in use in ancient traditional ceremonies on earth.  The  sacrificial animals were still slaughtered with flint knives.  The  old-style cakes were still offered in the holy places.  In other  words, life on earth now consisted of ordinary material life and  a traditional life--a life that clung to the forms of a more  primitive civilization as somehow more effective with the divine  powers.  This view is closely reflected in the grave furniture;  here, too, were the practical objects and the traditional  ceremonial objects.  Life after death is still always the same as  life on earth--with the same physical needs, with the same need  of help from supernatural powers or against supernatural powers.  The spirit of the man needed the spirit of the copper axe to  swing in battle; but just as much he needed the spirit of the  flint knife to make the first cut across the throat of the spirit  bull of sacrifice.  Remember this--the other world, in which  lived the spirit of the dead, was filled with the spirits or  ghosts of all things and animals.  The other, the unseen, was a  duplicate of this world; all things which have shape were there  --even to the black fields and the broad river of Egypt.  This is  the foundation of the Egyptian conception of immortality.  Through  all the modifications and accretions of the following three  thousand years, this foundation idea is always clearly visible.  All the statues, the carved and painted tombs, all the curious  little model boats and workshops, all the painted mummies, all  the amulets, the scarabs, the little funerary statuettes,--all  this mummery which seems to be so characteristic and so  essential, is only the means to an end, and an ever changing  means to secure a successful comfortable existence of the spirit  in the life after death,--in the ghostly duplicate of life on  earth.          IV. THE EARLY DYNASTIC PERIOD      It is clear that the effort to attain an immortality which is  merely a ghostly continuation of life on earth must reflect the  general development of Egyptian culture,--especially the  advance in arts and crafts.  One of the most striking examples of  this fact is the introduction of metal working mentioned above  and the consequent placing of both flint and copper in the grave,  --the division of grave furniture into practical objects and  ceremonial objects, which is the foundation for the use of  symbolic objects in later times.    The advance in arts and crafts not only suggests new ideas of the  necessities of the spirit, but it provides the necessary  technical skill for the more effective satisfaction of all the  needs of the dead.  This takes, first of all, the form of  supplying a place for the burial, which furnishes greater  security to the body and a better communication between the  living and the dead.    From the First Dynasty, say from 3300 B.C. down, as soon as the  Egyptian had mastered the use of mud-brick and wood, we gain the  certainty of an idea which could only be guessed at in the  primitive period.  A place is provided above the grave at which  the living could meet the spirit of the dead with _periodical_  offerings of food and other necessities.  In the life after death,  spirit food and drink, once used, ceased to be, just as in life  on earth, and had to be renewed from day to day, lest the spirit  of the dead suffer from hunger and thirst.  One of the great  developments of the first six dynasties looked to the provision  of these daily necessities.    The invention of writing was immediately utilized.  About the  beginning of the First Dynasty writing was invented for  administrative and other practical purposes.  Gravestones, bearing  in relief the name of the dead, were set up in the offering  places of the kings and court people.  These were probably  reminders for use in some simple formula recited in presenting  the periodical offerings.  As the Egyptians became more familiar  with the use of writing, the offering formula was written out in  full, enlarged and modified.    Sculptures, both relief and statuary, in every stage of their  development, were used as magical accessories to the offering  rites.    So, also, the whole history of Egyptian architecture was  reflected in the tomb; for every advance brought about some  change in the form or structure.  In fact, the whole development  of the form of the Egyptian tomb depended on the development of  technical skill.  The same funerary functions are served  throughout.  As all the great artisans were at the command of the  king, all the great technical discoveries and inventions were  first made in his service.  But every permanent gain in knowledge  was a benefit to the race and utilized by the common people.  So,  for example, the skill acquired in stone-cutting, during the  construction of the great pyramids, was utilized a little later  in producing rock-cut tombs from one end of Egypt to the other.    The functions of the grave remained the same.  Yet with the  changes in form resulting from the growth of skill, modifications  in the funerary customs crept in.    The mud-brick tombs of the early part of the First Dynasty, like  the pre-dynastic graves, had only one chamber, limited in size by  the length of logs obtainable to form the roof.  The growing  desire for ostentation found a way to enlarge the tombs by  building them with a number of chambers.  The burial was placed in  the central chamber and the burial furniture in the additional  chambers.  In this way the separation of the furniture and the  actual burial was brought about.          V. THE OLD EMPIRE      Another change comes in the Fourth Dynasty, and is to be noted  first in the royal tombs, as is always the case.  The Egyptians  had now learned to cut stone and build with it.  The burial  chambers hollowed in the solid rock were necessarily smaller than  the old chambers dug in the gravel and no longer sufficient to  contain the great mass of furniture gathered by a king for his  grave.  On the other hand, the chapels with the increase in  architectural skill could be build of great size.  Corresponding  to these technical conditions we find a great increase in the  importance of the chapel.  It becomes a great temple, whose  magazines were filled with all those objects which had formerly  been placed in the burial chamber and were so necessary to the  life of the spirit.  The temples of the third pyramid, for  example, contained nearly two thousand stone vessels.  Great  estates were set aside by will, and the income appointed to the  support of certain persons who on their side were obliged to keep  up the temple, to make the offerings and to recite the magical  formulas which would provide the spirit with all its necessities.    Following closely the growth in importance of the royal chapels,  the private offering places assumed a greater importance.  The  custom of periodic offerings and the use of magical texts grew  until it reached its highest point in the Fifth Dynasty.  At this  time there is a burial chamber deep underground where the dead  was laid securely in ancient traditional attitude, with his  clothing and a few personal ornaments.  As a rule, it is only the  women, always conservative, that have anything more.  Above this  grave, there is a solid rectangular structure, with a chapel or  offering place on the side towards the valley.  The offering place  is always there, no matter how poor or small the tomb.  But to  understand just what the Egyptian thought, we must turn to the  better tombs.  The walls are of limestone carved with reliefs  representing the important processes of daily life,--sowing,  reaping, cattle-herding, hunting, pot-making, weaving,--all  those actions which furnish the daily supplies.  The dead man is  represented overseeing all this.  Finally, near the offering  niche, he is represented seated, usually with his wife at a table  bearing loaves of the traditional _ta_ bread.  Beside him are  represented heaps of provisions--meat, cakes, vegetables, wine  and beer.  A list of objects is never missing, marked with  numbers,--a thousand loaves of bread, a thousand head of  cattle, a thousand jars of wine, a thousand garments, and so on.  We know from latter inscriptions that these words, properly  recited, created for the spirit a store of spirit objects in  equal numbers.  Below the niche is an altar for receiving actual  offerings of food and drink.  It is clear that the living, coming  to this offering place with or without material offerings, could,  by proper recitation, secure to the spirit of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12259"],[0,"Memoirs of a Cavalier (#2)"],[1,"the _Memoirs_,  gives us less of this side of the history of the times than might have  been expected. The war actually began in August, 1642, and what  Defoe gives us is military history, correct in essentials and full  of detail, which is, however, far from accurate. For instance, in his  account of the battle of Marston Moor, he makes prince Rupert command  the left wing, whereas he really commanded the right wing, the left  being led by Lord Goring who, according to Defoe's account, commanded  the main battle. He conveys to us, however, the true spirit of the  war, emphasizing the ability and the mistakes on both sides, showing  how the king's miscalculations or Rupert's rashness deprived the  Royalist party of the advantages of the superior generalship and  fighting power which were theirs in the first part of the war and how  gradually the Roundheads got the better of the Cavaliers. The detailed  narrative comes to an end with the delivery of the King to the  Parliament by the Scots, to whom he had given himself up in his  extremity. A few lines tell of his trial and execution and the  _Memoirs_ end with some pages of \"remarks and observations\" on the  war and a list of coincidences which had been noted in its course.  The latter, savouring somewhat of superstition, appear natural in  what purports to be a seventeenth century text, but the summing up of  conclusions about the war is rather such as might be made by a more or  less impartial observer at a later date than by one who had taken an  active part in the struggle. In reading the _Memoirs_ this mixture of  what belongs to the seventeenth century with the reflections of Defoe,  in many ways a typical eighteenth century figure, must be borne in  mind. The inaccuracies are pointed out in the notes, but these need  not prevent us from entering with zest into the spirit of the story.    E. O'NEILL.    4 _March_ 1908.          CONTENTS      INTRODUCTION.    PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.    TEXT: Part I.          Part II.    NOTES.          PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.      As an evidence that 'tis very probable these Memorials were written  many years ago, the persons now concerned in the publication assure  the reader that they have had them in their possession finished, as  they now appear, above twenty years; that they were so long ago found  by great accident, among other valuable papers, in the closet of an  eminent public minister, of no less figure than one of King William's  secretaries of state.    As it is not proper to trace them any farther, so neither is there any  need to trace them at all, to give reputation to the story related,  seeing the actions here mentioned have a sufficient sanction from all  the histories of the times to which they relate, with this addition,  that the admirable manner of relating them and the wonderful variety  of incidents with which they are beautified in the course of a private  gentleman's story, add such delight in the reading, and give such a  lustre, as well to the accounts themselves as to the person who was  the actor, that no story, we believe, extant in the world ever came  abroad with such advantage.    It must naturally give some concern in the reading that the name of a  person of so much gallantry and honour, and so many ways valuable  to the world, should be lost to the readers. We assure them no small  labour has been thrown away upon the inquiry, and all we have been  able to arrive to of discovery in this affair is, that a memorandum  was found with this manuscript, in these words, but not signed by any  name, only the two letters of a name, which gives us no light into the  matter, which memoir was as follows:--    _Memorandum_.    \"I found this manuscript among my father's writings, and I understand  that he got them as plunder, at, or after, the fight at Worcester,  where he served as major of ----'s regiment of horse on the side of  the Parliament. I.K.\"    As this has been of no use but to terminate the inquiry after the  person, so, however, it seems most naturally to give an authority to  the original of the work, viz., that it was born of a soldier; and  indeed it is through every part related with so soldierly a style, and  in the very language of the field, that it seems impossible anything  but the very person who was present in every action here related,  could be the relater of them.    The accounts of battles, the sieges, and the several actions of which  this work is so full, are all recorded in the histories of those  times; such as the great battle of Leipsic, the sacking of Magdeburg,  the siege of Nuremburg, the passing the river Lech in Bavaria; such  also as the battle of Kineton, or Edgehill, the battles of Newbury,  Marston Moor, and Naseby, and the like: they are all, we say, recorded  in other histories, and written by those who lived in those times, and  perhaps had good authority for what they wrote. But do those relations  give any of the beautiful ideas of things formed in this account?  Have they one half of the circumstances and incidents of the actions  themselves that this man's eyes were witness to, and which his memory  has thus preserved? He that has read the best accounts of those  battles will be surprised to see the particulars of the story so  preserved, so nicely and so agreeably described, and will confess  what we allege, that the story is inimitably told; and even the great  actions of the glorious King GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS receive a lustre  from this man's relations which the world was never made sensible of  before, and which the present age has much wanted of late, in order to  give their affections a turn in favour of his late glorious successor.    In the story of our own country's unnatural wars, he carries on the  same spirit. How effectually does he record the virtues and glorious  actions of King Charles the First, at the same time that he frequently  enters upon the mistakes of his Majesty's conduct, and of his friends,  which gave his enemies all those fatal advantages against him, which  ended in the overthrow of his armies, the loss of his crown and life,  and the ruin of the constitution!    In all his accounts he does justice to his enemies, and honours  the merit of those whose cause he fought against; and many accounts  recorded in his story, are not to be found even in the best histories  of those times.    What applause does he give to gallantry of Sir Thomas Fairfax, to his  modesty, to his conduct, under which he himself was subdued, and to  the justice he did the king's troops when they laid down their arms!    His description of the Scots troops in the beginning of the war, and  the behaviour of the party under the Earl of Holland, who went over  against them, are admirable; and his censure of their conduct, who  pushed the king upon the quarrel, and then would not let him fight, is  no more than what many of the king's friends (though less knowing as  soldiers) have often complained of.    In a word, this work is a confutation of many errors in all the  writers upon the subject of our wars in England, and even in that  extraordinary history written by the Earl of Clarendon; but the  editors were so just that when, near twenty years ago, a person  who had written a whole volume in folio, by way of answer to and  confutation of Clarendon's \"History of the Rebellion,\" would have  borrowed the clauses in this account, which clash with that history,  and confront it,--we say the editors were so just as to refuse them.    There can be nothing objected against the general credit of this work,  seeing its truth is established upon universal history; and almost all  the facts, especially those of moment, are confirmed for their general  part by all the writers of those times. If they are here embellished  with particulars, which are nowhere else to be found, that is the  beauty we boast of; and that it is that much recommend this work to  all the men of sense and judgment that read it.    The only objection we find possible to make against this work is, that  it is not carried on farther, or, as we may say finished, with the  finishing the war of the time; and this we complain of also. But then  we complain of it as a misfortune to the world, not as a fault in the  author; for how do we know but that this author might carry it on, and  have another part finished which might not fall into the same hands,  or may still remain with some of his family, and which they cannot  indeed publish, to make it seem anything perfect, for want of the  other parts which we have, and which we have now made public? Nor is  it very improbable but that if any such farther part is in being, the  publishing these two parts may occasion the proprietors of the third  to let the world see it, and that by such a discovery the name of the  person may also come to be known, which would, no doubt, be a great  satisfaction to the reader as well as us.    This, however, must be said, that if the same author should have  written another part of this work, and carried it on to the end of  those times, yet as the residue of those melancholy days, to the  Restoration, were filled with the intrigues of government, the  political management of illegal power, and the dissensions and  factions of a people who were then even in themselves but a faction,  and that there was very little action in the field, it is more than  probable that our author, who was a man of arms, had little share in  those things, and might not care to trouble himself with looking at  them.    But besides all this, it might happen that he might go abroad again  at that time, as most of the gentlemen of quality, and who had an  abhorrence for the power that then governed here, did. Nor are we  certain that he might live to the end of that time, so we can give  no account whether he had any share in the subsequent actions of that  time.    'Tis enough that we have the authorities above to recommend"]]]
