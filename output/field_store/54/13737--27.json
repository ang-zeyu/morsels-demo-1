When  you say the Shema twice a day, as every good Jew is expected to do, you  read in it that God commanded us, through Moses, to wear a fringe on our  garment--the tsitsith, a visible sign to remind us of His Commandments,  just in the same way as a table, spread ready for a meal, reminds us of  our meals. Our religion is not a thing to be kept only for the Sabbath  and the Holy Days, and left out of our minds on all other days. Our  religion must be a living influence, always with us, so the tsitsith is  a very simple kind of symbol to be ever worn to remind a Jew of his God,  his duty to Him and to his neighbour. It is not only we Jews who have  religious symbols; every other religion has them. Now imagine if you  were to go up to a Christian boy and mock him and say nasty words to  him for wearing a cross, or crucifix, he would turn round and fight you,  and he would be right in doing so, for no one has a right to insult  another for wearing or doing what he believes to be holy. Instead of  being ashamed when you were mocked and laughed at by Christian boys for  wearing your tsitsith, you should have asked them to hear you explain  the reason for wearing it. I am sure they would not have laughed at you  any more. They would respect you for trying to be true and to live up to  your convictions.    \"We Jews have, in the past, made a great mistake in not letting the  outside world know more of the deeper spiritual meaning of each of our  symbols. Had we not done this, we should have been better understood by  non-Jews, and our children would not have suffered as you and many  others also have done, through the ignorant mocking of your Christian  schoolmates.    \"I know that in Palestine the Jews, whether old or young, greatly love  to wear their tsitsith, and take a pride in letting them be seen, so  that the Arabs and the Turks look upon the tsitsith as a sacred  garment.\"    [Illustration: THE FATHER TEACHING THE CHILD THE MEANING OF THE TSITSITH  (SACRED GARMENT)]      UNCLE'S LETTER    \"How do you know this, Father?\" said Benjamin.    By this time all in the room had dropped their papers and books, and  were listening to their father.    \"Well, this is how I know: nearly thirty years ago my uncle and his  family went to live in Jerusalem, and for many years one of my cousins  used to write to me about once a month. His letters were most  interesting. When his letters came I could almost imagine, when reading  them, that I was living in Bible times.    \"Have you any of his letters still, Father?\" they all exclaimed.    \"Yes,\" said the father, \"I have many of them.\"    \"Oh, do read some of them to us!\" they pleaded. \"All right, I will; and  I will first try to find the one about the tsitsith.\"    The father went up to his bedroom, and soon came down with a bundle of  letters wrapped in a newspaper. He started looking through them while  all the family stood around him, watching as eagerly as if he were  searching for an heirloom.    \"I will choose a very short one,\" said the father, \"for it is on the  subject I have spoken to Benjamin about; but if you like I will make it  a rule every Friday evening, after our Sabbath meal, to read some of the  letters to you.\"      THE HOLY CITY    When all were quietly and comfortably seated, their father started  reading:    \"My dear Cousin,--After a great many adventures and suffering (which I  will write to you about another time) we arrived safely in Jerusalem. To  me, it seemed rather dull after London, but both father and mother shed  tears of joy when they at last arrived in the Holy City. Some people met  us a little way out, for father had written telling them we were coming.  We were almost royally received and heartily welcomed, for very few Jews  come here with their young families.    \"We must have looked a sight--you in London could not imagine anything  like our cavalcade! First went Father riding on a mule, with Mother  following on another mule. Mother's saddle was made with pillows, for it  is impossible for a woman to ride for sixteen or eighteen hours without  a soft, comfortable seat.    \"You go up high hills, and then down again, imagining every time you go  down that you will topple over and fall over the precipice and be  killed. In fact, your heart is in your mouth every five minutes, so that  by the time you arrive in Jerusalem (which is surrounded by hills) you  are almost too weak to rejoice at the beauty that greets your sight, for  nowhere in the world can, I think, anything be seen more beautiful than  a sunrise over the mountains around Jerusalem.    \"Oh, I forgot to tell you that we youngsters were put into baskets on a  camel's back, and how we were shaken! I felt as if I were praying and  shaking all the time, for it seemed as if we could never get to  Jerusalem alive in this way.\"      THE PROUD BOYS OF JERUSALEM    \"At last we entered the Holy City, and arrived at Father's friend's  house, where we were made very welcome and treated most kindly. I soon  made friends with the boys, for, you know, I can speak yiddish quite  well.    \"They are funny little chaps. They look like old men, with long kaftans  (coats) and side ear-locks of hair, carrying their prayer book or Bible  to Shule. The first thing I noticed was the tsitsith. They wear really  long ones, with long fringes hanging down about a quarter of a yard or  more. They wear them as we do a waistcoat, so that they can be seen by  everyone, not as we wear them in England, tucked away out of sight. Here  young and old, even little boys who can only just walk and lisp their  prayers, wear them, and, what is more, take a real pleasure in wearing  them. I asked some of them why they wore them so openly, and they  answered: 'Because when we look at them we always remember that our  chief duty in life is to try to obey God's commands, and if we had them  tucked away out of sight we should forget to be obedient.' 'Besides,'  they said, 'we are commanded in the Torah to do so openly.' Then I told  them if we wore them so openly in Europe we should perhaps be laughed at  by some people and made fun of. They said: 'Why should doing so make us  be laughed at by other nations? Do we laugh at the symbols and charms  that many of them wear? Every nation,' they said, 'has its tokens and  symbols, and we Jews have ours, and we should rejoice in wearing ours  when they are to help us to feel that God is near us when we think and  act rightly.' All this made me think very seriously, and in a way I had  never thought before. I began to realize that they were more in the  right than we Jews are in England.    \"So now I have decided to wear my tsitsith, too, on the outside, as the  Jerusalem boys do. The boys never play except on the quiet, just now and  then, for their parents think that their only duty in life is to study  and do as many Mitzvoth as they can. Really, the boys are as full of fun  and pranks as we English boys, and they just love a bit of play and  larking when they can get it.    \"I must now end this letter, but I have a lot more to tell you, and I  will keep my promise and write you by degrees of all I see. Meanwhile,  I send you the greeting of Zion and Sabbath. Rachael wanted to put a  letter into my envelope to your sister, but she says she has not  finished it yet, although she has already written ten pages. So I will  wait no longer, in case I miss the post, as it goes only once a week  from here, and sometimes only once a month.\"    Thus ended the first letter, and Benjamin's brothers and sisters were so  pleased with it that they were delighted that one of the bundle of  letters should be read aloud after the Sabbath meal on every Friday  evening.    Benjamin was quite happy now, for, although he had done a thing which  was not right, now that he had repented good would come out of it, for  there was a chance of their now having pleasanter and more instructive  Sabbath evenings than they had ever had before. Besides, he now made up  his mind always to wear his tsitsith.          THE WELCOME        On the following Friday, after the Sabbath evening meal, the boys asked  their father to read them another letter from his cousin in Jerusalem.  He was pleased at their eagerness, and, while Upstairs getting the  letter, some of the boys' friends came in and settled comfortably down,  for all were eager to hear the letter read.    Mr Jacob said: \"This time I will read a letter from your Cousin Dora to  my sister which will certainly interest you, my dear,\" turning to his  daughter, \"but at the same time, I think it will interest you all.\"    \"My dear Milly,--Isaac must have written to Jacob all about our arrival,  so I will begin by giving you some idea of our life here and my  impressions. The people, who so kindly asked us to stay with them till  Father finds a dwelling, have a few rooms in a house, which has a marble  paved courtyard. Six other families also have two or three rooms each.  All the work is done in the courtyard, even the cooking; for each family  uses tiny stoves, made of mud, into which they put a little lighted  charcoal and cook just outside or near their own doors; for there are no  kitchens or fireplaces in any of the rooms, and thus we see what each  family cooks. The Sephardim (Jews who have lived here for years) eat  their meals in the courtyard. They lay a mat on the marble tiles, on  which they place a small low table, and they sit on the mat and eat. Two  Sephardim families have rooms in the house and they speak Arabic and  Spanish, and their ways of living are more like those of the Turks, just  as the Jews in England live more like the English.    \"Everyone seems "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15193"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 841, February 13, 1892 (#2)"],[1,"peculiarities in the construction of  the limbs and skulls of the Dipodidea with their bird-like movements  and bird-like sharp-sightedness, that are usually found only among  birds. The consistency between the construction of their bodies and  their mode of life is a beautiful example of fitness; only by  extraordinary quickness of movement and sagacity could the little  defenseless plant-eaters maintain the struggle for existence in the  barren steppes and deserts. The formation of the bodies of the  different members of the family varies according to their needs. The  jerboa is the largest member of the family. Very little is known of  his life when free; it being known only that the jerboas are widely  spread over the whole of southern Africa, and are nocturnal burrowers  of the steppes.

I had occasion in a note published several years ago in the _Revue  Scientifique_ to mention a parroquet which I have since continued to  observe, the manifestations of whose intelligence are both interesting  and instructive. Many acts of birds are difficult of interpretation.  To speak only of their songs, the meanings of most of the innumerable  varieties of sounds which they produce, and of their diverse  warblings, escape us completely. It is not possible to find the  meaning of these things except by forming suppositions and hypotheses,  or by catching the connections between cries and acts. But instances  of the latter kind are extremely rare in comparison with the great  majority of the manifestations made by animals.    Thus, to select examples which every one can observe, when a canary  bird is warbling in its cage and becomes deafening, or when a lark  rises straight up in the air and _incantat suum tirile tirile_--sings  its _tirile tirile_--as Linnaeus picturesquely expresses it; when a  tomtit, leaping from branch to branch of a willow or among the reeds,  repeats its florid warblings; when a raven croaks; when a blackbird  whistles--what significance can we attach to their songs and their  cries? Certainty is impossible, and we can only form more or less  plausible hypotheses concerning the interpretation of them.    The parrot furnishes us one more aid in this matter than other birds,  and this helps us, to a certain extent, in overcoming the difficulty  of interpretation. It has an articulate voice, and when we have taught  it a few words, the meaning which it gives them may be better divined  by us according to the tone and the rapidity or slowness of its  utterance. This permits us to discover the feelings that move it, for  we can better judge from an articulate sound than from one that is  merely musical.    Much has been written on the language of animals. It is neither my  desire nor my intention to repeat here all that may have been said on  this subject. It would take too long and would be of no use. I have  often witnessed facts that may be of interest to those who are  occupied with the mental manifestations of animals. I will simply  relate them; and of such as are already known, I will merely mention  them anew, admitting in advance a priority for others which I do not  demand for myself.    There can be no doubt that animals communicate their impressions by an  inarticulate voice. Common sense and the most superficial observations  are opposed to the negative of this proposition. But when a canary  bird warbles till it stuns us, or a nightingale sings in the shadows  on the fine nights of June, can we follow and discover the  significance of those modulations--now sharply cadenced, now slowly  drawn out, and ending with a trill long and accurate enough to  challenge the most skillful musician?    All the poets of every country have constantly sung of the songs of  Philomela. But their fervent and enthusiastic verses cast little light  on the value of the nightingale's song. It is said that the male sings  for the entertainment of the sitting female, but there is no proof of  the assertion. The note warning of the approach of danger is easier to  recognize. The bird utters a short, hoarse cry, and repeats it with a  succession of _trrre, trrre_, which is impossible to mistake. When we  hear this cry we may be sure that an enemy is near. Music gives way to  a cry of distress and warning, and the female leaves her nest if the  sounds become piercing. What do we know of the gobbling of the turkey,  which the whistling and the cries of children excite? They are  doubtless responses to those challenges; but what do they mean?    The crowing of the cock, recurring regularly at fixed hours, has some  signification, but we cannot comprehend it. If on a fine afternoon in  autumn the cock crows, and repeats his strain between two and four  o'clock, the countrymen in some places will say there will be a fog on  the morrow, and they are generally not mistaken. Hens do not mistake  his notes either; when a leader of the troop, coming upon a spot rich  in food, utters his peculiar chuckle, they run from all around to  share the find with him. It is evident that the cock has called them  and they have understood him. These facts indicate that there is some  definite sense in this inarticulate language; and examples of it,  taken from other groups, might be multiplied.    The dog, intelligent animal as he is, manifests his affection on  meeting his master, with peculiar cries which vary with the intensity  of his joy. No one could confound these notes of pleasure with those  which he utters when he is angrily driving away a beggar, or when he  meets another dog of unpleasant appearance and puts himself in the  position of attack.    An interesting study of the voice of the dog on guard may be made in  the country at night. If another dog barks in the distance, the house  dog answers in a peculiar manner. He gives a few growls, stops, seems  to listen, begins again, very often getting answers; and, after two or  three interruptions, he terminates his barking with abrupt yelps, loud  at the beginning and long drawn out, and gradually dying away. This  ending of his cries is habitually accompanied by his raising his head  and throwing it back. I have often, when within the house, on hearing  the watch dog bark in this way, opened the window to assure myself on  the subject, and distinguished, as I could not do with the windows  closed, the voice of another watch dog barking in the same way in the  distance--the barkings of the two dogs alternating, one answering the  other. There is in such cases an evident communication of impressions.  One of the dogs, having had his attention aroused by some unusual  noise, has transmitted his impression to the other, as sentinels  posted at intervals call out theft warnings one to another. I have  often repeated this observation during the long evenings of winter.    Another example, little known in thickly populated countries, is drawn  from a curious scene which I witnessed during a winter passed in  Perigord Noir. We had remarked that for several nights the three watch  dogs, a young and an old male and a bitch, howled often toward  midnight, but in a peculiar way. One night in particular, during their  tedious concert, just as we had got to sleep, they mingled with their  cries howlings like those they would have uttered if they had been  beaten, with a shading hard to define, but which we perceived plainly;  and we remarked that, leaving their kennel in the avenue that led up  to the lodge, they had come to close quarters with one another at the  gate, with alternating howlings and plaintive cries. Inquiring in the  morning for the cause of these singular cries, the peasants told me  that a wolf had passed, and predicted that it would return. They said,  too, that a neighbor's hunting bitch had disappeared, and its bones  had been found in the fields near a wood. We were awakened again about  midnight by the cries of the dogs, and the scene was renewed. Informed  as we now were of the nature of what was going on, we ran to one of  the windows, whence we could see, in the clear light of the moon, all  that passed. The three dogs were cowering against the gate, the oldest  one howling by the side of the others, while the younger one and the  bitch were exposed at intervals to the attacks of another animal,  browner than they, and of about their size, without defending  themselves, but moaning as if they were undergoing a vigorous  correction.    Frightened, doubtless, by the opening of the blinds of the first story  above him, the strange animal had gone away and was sitting in the  middle of the road. We could only see that he had straight ears. While  we were going down to get a gun the visitor came back to his charge on  the dogs, which had begun howling after he left them, and resumed the  cries significant of chastisement when they were attacked again. For  some reason, perhaps because he heard the click of the gun, the foe  drew back and sat down in a garden walk, concealed by a bunch of  shrubbery. The three dogs, notwithstanding our reiterated urging, were  no more disposed to pursue him than before. If the assailant had been  a dog they would have rushed upon him, but they stayed cowering at the  gate and howled distressfully. The bitch was most affected, and they  all seemed paralyzed by fear. It is said in the country that bitches  are especially liable to be attacked by wolves. It was so here. The  most certain feature in the matter was the terror of the animals. They  were capable of resisting the attack three times over. The young dog  was a savage one, and passers-by were afraid of the bitch; but that  night they were terrorized, and all incapable of defending themselves.  Their cries were"]]]
