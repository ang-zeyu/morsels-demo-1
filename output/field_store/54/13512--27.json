Burney and Crotch were remarkable  instances of precocious musical skill; and in the present day, children  from eight to twelve sing the most popular Italian airs on the English  stage, with remarkable accuracy.    Apropos, we hear of constitutions being set to music, for says the  _Foreign Review_, \"during the short revolution at Naples, in 1820, a  Neapolitan was heard to swear that if the government intended that the  new constitution should be understood or accepted by the people, they  must first have it set to music by Rossini.\"           *       *       *       *       *        GARDENS OF THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY, REGENT'S PARK.      [Illustration: GARDENS OF THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY, REGENT'S PARK.]    We are again in the _Regents Park_; but we must leave its architectural  splendour for the present, and request our readers to accompany us  towards the eastern verge of the Park, to the Gardens of the Zoological  Society, established in 1826, and whose members now amount to _eleven  hundred_! The grounds are daily filled with fashionable company,  notwithstanding the great migrations which usually take place at this  season of the year, and almost depopulate the western hemisphere of  fashion. The gardens, independent of their zoological attractions, are a  delightful promenade, being laid out with great taste, and the parterres  boasting a beautiful display of flowers. The animals, too, are seen to  much greater advantage than when shut up in a menagerie, and have the  luxury of fresh air, instead of unwholesome respiration in a room or  caravan.[2]        [2] It should, however, be noticed, that the object of the      _Zoological Society_ is not the mere exhibition of animals. In      the original prospectus it is observed, that \"Animals brought      from every part of the globe to be applied to some _useful_      purpose as objects of scientific research, not of vulgar      admiration; and upon such an institution, a philosophy of      zoology founded, pointing out the comparative anatomy, the      habits of life, the improvement and the methods of multiplying      those races of animals which are most useful to man, and thus      fixing a most beautiful and important branch of knowledge on the      permanent basis of direct utility.\" The Secretary of the Society      is N.A. Vigors, Esq., M.A., F.R.S., &c. who, from his extensive      attainments in the science of zoology, fills the office with      honor to himself, and peculiar advantage to the public.    At page 413 of our last volume, the reader will find an abstract of the  second anniversary of the Society, since which the Gardens in the  Regent's Park have been opened for public inspection. We have  accordingly availed ourselves of this privilege, and our draughtsman has  been at some pains in the annexed sketch, together with the vignette  _portraits_ accompanying it. The \"_Bird's-Eye View_\" will be better  explained by reference to the figures; thus,      1. Entrance Gate and Pay Hut.    2. Ditto Check Hut.    3. House and Ground for _Emus_:    Two awkward land birds, resembling ostriches. Their incapability of  flying is compensated by the exceeding speed with which they run. They  are natives of New Holland.      4. Central Walk.    5. Sloping Shrubbery of Defence.    6. Fields for Horses and Cattle.    7. Building for _Bears,_,    [Illustration]    communicating with their pit, in the centre of which is a pole with  steps for the animals to ascend and descend. At the extremity of the  upper walk, the pit is surrounded with a dwarf wall and coping, to which  (since our sketch was taken) have been added iron rails. There are here  two Arctic bears, and a small black bear, the latter brought from  Russia,[3] and presented to the Society, by the Marquess of Hertford.  There is usually a crowd of visiters about this spot, and the sagacity  and antics of our four-footed friends ensure them liberal supplies of  cakes and fruit, handed to them on a pole. We were much interested with  their tricks, especially with the vexation betrayed by one of them, at  the top of the pole, when he saw his companion below seize a cake which  the former had previously eyed with great _gout_. His wringing and  biting his paws reminded us of many scenes out of a bear-pit. Then the  snorting and snarling of the old bear below, when the young one  attempted to obtain a cake thrown to him; and above all, the small share  which our black friend _Toby_ enjoyed, probably from his docility  over-much,--like good-natured men who are mastered by those of rough  natures. We could have staid here a whole hour, watching their antics,  and likening them to the little trickery of human nature.        [3] He was previously at Sudborne, the seat of the Marquess of      Hertford, where Toby, as our Russian friend was christened,      became equally sagacious with bipeds, in distinguishing strong      ale from small beer. To the former beverage, Toby became freely      attached; but when we saw him at the Gardens in the Regent's      Park, he appeared too docile for his companions.      8 and 9. Ground enclosed for _Kangaroos_,    of which there is a little herd, large and small. They are natives of  New Holland. The fore legs are seldom more than twenty inches in length,  whilst the hinder ones are sometimes three feet and a half long. They  rest on the whole length of the hind feet, supporting themselves by the  base of the tail, which, in truth, acts as a fifth leg, and is sometimes  used as a weapon, being of such strength as to break a man's leg at a  single blow. They move by leaps, which have been known to exceed twenty  feet. Several kangaroos have been kept in the park at Richmond, and  where they have produced young ones.      10. _Dens_    containing two fine _leopards, a porcupine_, and _racoons_. In an  adjoining den are three _wolves._      11. Gothic House for _Lamas_.    [Illustration]    This is one of the most picturesque objects in the grounds. It contains  two lamas. These animals are common in South America, particularly in  the mountainous parts of Peru, where they are employed as beasts of  burthen. One of the lamas was presented to the Society by the Duke of  Bedford.      12. Circular Aviary for _Birds of Prey_    containing a _fine griffon vulture_, a white-headed _North American  eagle, hawks, falcons_, and _owls_; among the latter is the _great  horned owl_. This is supposed by Linnaeus, and many antiquaries, to have  been the bird of Minerva. The collection is remarkably splendid.      13. Hut for _Beavers_.    14. Hut for _Foreign Goats._    15. Enclosed Area and Fountain for _Aquatic Birds_, as pelicans,    Solan geese, China geese, black swans, &c.    16. Aviary.    Here are three handsome crested cranes, four Indian spoonbills, together  with three storks, three or four cockatoos, whose brilliant plumage  outvies the gayest robe of art, and three curassos.      17. Grove and Huts for _Esquimaux Dogs_    of which there are three fine specimens.      18. Fountain, &c. for _Water Fowl_.    19. Enclosure for _Zebras, Indian Cows, &c_.    20. Houses on poles for _Monkeys_.    [Illustration]    These are distributed beside the walks. The monkey is attached by a  chain to a ring loosely round the pole, by which means he ascends and  descends at pleasure.      21. Intended Aviary, (supposed for _Eagles, Vultures_, &c.).    22. Twenty acres about to be added.    23. House for _Monkeys, &c_.    Here are double rows of cages, containing a fine South American ocelot,  a lynx, a puma, coatamondis, an ichneumon, and several monkeys; the last  affording an excellent opportunity of appreciating the fidelity of Mr.  Landseer's _Monkeyana,_ and illustrating the vraisemblance of men and  monkeys.      24. Intended Aviary.    25. Mexican _Hogs,_ &c.    26. Huts for _Jackalls,_ &c.    27. Unfinished Houses.    The carriage-road is formed of the outer side of the Park.    There is likewise an enclosure for _Tortoises_, of which there are three  large and several small ones. We saw one of them devouring pumpkin as a  gourmand would turtle, and this voracity is by weather-wise people  considered as a sure indication of rain. This turtle is believed to be  very old; he is of stupendous size, but buried as he was (except his  neck) with shell, he soon became aware of the approach of his companion,  nearly as large, and accordingly ate with increased greediness. Among  the birds, too, should be mentioned several beautiful varieties of  pheasants, partridges, &c. which are well worth the attention of the  visiter.    We have probably passed over many animals, our object being merely to  mention a few of the most interesting for their habits and  peculiarities. Of course the collection is as yet incomplete, there  being neither lion, tiger, hyaena, elephant, nor rhinoceros; but when it  is considered that the Society has been established little more than two  years, in which time a Museum has been formed, and 1,100 subscribers  obtained, besides the arrangement of the Gardens--it will be  acknowledged that much has been done in a short time, and judging from  the excellent organization of the Society and their past success, we  anticipate the utmost realization of their plan.    Our readers need not be told that the Zoological Society is partly on  the plan of the Museum of Natural History at Paris, except that the  latter is supported by the Government, the Gardens are indiscriminately  opened to the public, free of cost, and the Museum on stated days; and  when we add that the names of Fagon, Duverney, Tournefort, Vaillant, De  Jussieu, Buffon, Daubenton, Fourcroy, Desfontaines, De Lamarck, and  Cuvier, occur in its list of professors, they will not be surprised at  the Musee d'Histoire Naturelle being the richest of its kind in the  world.           *       *       *       *       *    As acceptable information, we subjoin the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11401"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 10, No. 271, (#2)"],[1,"bed, being pretty much confined to useful, indeed necessary,  branches of knowledge. But his father had been a man of greater natural  and more cultivated intellect than many; he had read much, and on the  abolition of slavery, in which he was one of Clarkson's earliest  associates, he had, on several occasions, proved that he could write  well, though, we believe, he was never avowedly an author. He had left  no despicable collection of books, so that in his school vacations ample  means were afforded to his son of indulging his taste for reading. A  pleasing tribute to the memory of Mr. Barton's father will be found in  his _Napoleon and other Poems_.    In the year 1806, Mr. Barton took up his residence in the pleasant town  of Woodbridge, in Suffolk, and commenced business as a merchant; but  an unlooked-for domestic affliction of the severest kind was about to  visit him, and his wordly prospects were to receive an irrecoverable  shock,--the loss of his amiable wife, before they had been married  a twelvemonth, and soon after the birth of her child! This excellent  woman, to whom our poet was, for so short a time, united, gave rise to  some of his best pieces, particularly to the poem beginning, _The heaven  was cloudless_,[3] and that entitled _A Portrait, _in _Napoleon and  other Poems_. In this last piece the poet no less beautifully than truly  observes,--        To sympathies, which soothe and bless      Our life from day to day,    Which throw, with silent tenderness,      Fresh flowers across our way,    The heart must ever fondly cling:    But can the poet's sweetest string      Their loveliness display?    No--nor could Titian's self supply    Their living presence, once gone by.      The air, in which we breathe and live,      Eludes our touch and sight;    The fairest flowers their fragrance give      To stillness, and to night;    The softest sounds that music flings,    In passing, from her heaven-plumed wings,      Are trackless in their flight!    And thus life's sweetest bliss is known    To silent, grateful thought alone.      This mournful event, combined with discouraging prospects of a  mercantile nature, induced our author to retire from commercial pursuits  on his own behalf; and in 1810 he obtained a situation as a clerk in the  Woodbridge bank, which he still holds.    Soon after Mr. Barton had entered upon his present situation, he  began \"to commit the sin of rhyme,\" and a new provincial paper being  established about this time, it became the vehicle of his effusions: by  degrees our young poet became bold enough to send a short piece now and  then to a London paper, and at last, in 1812, ventured on an anonymous  volume, entitled _Metrical Effusions_, 250 copies of which were printed  by a bookseller of Woodbridge, and sold within the immediate circle of  our author's acquaintance. In 1818, Mr. Barton printed, by subscription,  an elegant volume, in elephant octavo, of _Poems by an Amateur_,  of which 150 only were struck off, and none ever sold at the shops.  Encouraged by the very flattering manner in which these impressions of  his poems were received by his friends, our author at last ventured to  publish, in a small volume, _Poems, by Bernard Barton_, which was very  favourably noticed by the literary journals, and, being afterwards made  still more known by an article in the _Edinburgh Review_, has now  reached a _third_ edition. He afterwards published, in a handsome octavo  volume, his _Napoleon and other Poems_; and subsequently a volume of  poems, entitled _A Widow's Tale_, which appeared in an early month of  the present year.    Such has been the literary career of Bernard Barton. If it have not left  behind it the brilliant track of other poetical comets, it has been less  erratic in its course; and if it have not been irradiated by the full  blaze of a noonday sun, it has nevertheless been illumined by the silver  lustre of the queen of night; and his Parnassian vespers may be said to  possess all the mild and soothing beauties of the evening star. If his  muse have not always reached the sunward path of the soaring eagle,  it is no extravagant praise to say, that she has often emulated the  sublimity of his aerial flight. But the great charm thrown around the  effusions of the Suffolk bard is that \"lucid veil\" of morality and  religion which \"covers but not conceals\"--that \"silver net-work,\"  through which his poetic \"apples of gold\" shine with an adventitious  beauty, which even the gorgeous ornaments so profusely lavished by  a Byron or a Moore would fail to invest them.        There is a fame which owes its spell      To popular applause alone;    Which seems on lip and tongue to dwell,      And finds--in others' breath--its own;    For such the eager worldling sighs,    And this the fickle world supplies.      There is a nobler fame--which draws      Its purer essence from the heart;    Which only seeks that calm applause      The virtuous and the wise impart:    Such fame beyond the grave shall live:    But this the world can never give.      --B. BARTON.    We have alluded to the amiable character of our poet; that his modesty  is equal to his merit, the following extract, from a letter to a friend,  will afford a pleasing evidence. Speaking of his literary career, he  says, \"it has been marked by an indulgence on the part of the public,  and the dispensers of literary fame, which I never anticipated. When I  consider that only about three years have elapsed since I avowed myself  an author, I am really surprised at the notice my trivial productions  have received, and the numerous acquaintance to which they have, by  correspondence, introduced me. Much of this, I dare say, is owing to  my quakerism; and to that, unquestionably, I was indebted for the  article in the _Edinburgh Review_, and the more recent passing notice  in the _Quarterly_. Still, as I do not believe that any _outre_ or  _adventitious_ source of attraction would have alone procured me the  attention I have found, I would hope it may partly have arisen from  their simple, unaffected appeal to those quiet, domestic, secluded  feelings, which endear the still undercurrent of existence--in short,  to my being content to make the best I could of the homely and confined  materials to which my situation has given me access, without affecting  scholarship, or aiming at romantic embellishment. There is nothing like  simple truth and nature, after all; and he who is satisfied with simply  and faithfully describing what he actually sees, feels, and, thinks, may  always hope to appeal successfully to the unsophisticated heart.\"[4]    We here conclude our notice of the bard of Woodbridge; and should  this brief account excite the interest of our readers to become better  acquainted with this \"living author,\" we refer them to the whole-length  portrait painted by himself, and held up to view in every page of his  poems.        [1] _Poems_, by B. Barton, p.190, 3rd edit.        [2] One of these sisters is the present _Mrs. Hack_, favourably          known as the authoress of several useful and highly interesting          works for children. See some introductory verses to her, prefixed          to the third edition of Mr. Barton's \"Poems.\" His brother John          has also distinguished himself by one or two judicious pamphlets          on the situation and circumstances of the poor.

The fire of London broke out on Sunday morning, September 2, 1666,  O.S.,  and being impelled by strong winds, raged with irresistible fury  nearly four days and nights; nor was it entirely mastered till the fifth  morning after it began. The conflagration commenced at the house of one  Farryner, a baker, in Pudding-lane, near [New] Fish-street-hill, and  within ten houses of Thames-street, into which it spread within a few  hours; nearly the whole of the contiguous buildings being of timber,  lath, and plaster, and the whole neighbourhood presenting little else  than closely confined passages and narrow alleys. The fire quickly  spread, and was not to be conquered by any human means, \"Then, (says  a contemporary writer,) then the city did shake indeed, and the  inhabitants did tremble, and flew away in great amazement from their  houses, lest the flames should devour them: _rattle, rattle, rattle_,  was the noise which the fire struck upon the ear round about, as if  there had been a thousand iron chariots beating upon the stones. You  might see the houses _tumble, tumble, tumble_, from one end of the  street to the other, with a great crash, leaving the foundations open  to the view of the heavens.\"[5]    The destructive fury of this conflagration was never, perhaps, exceeded  in any part of the world, by any fire originating in accident. _Within  the walls_, it consumed almost five-sixths of the whole city; and  _without_ the walls it cleared a space nearly as extensive as the  one-sixth part left unburnt within. Scarcely a single building that came  within the range of the flames was left standing. Public buildings,  churches, and dwelling-houses, were alike involved in one common fate.    In the summary account of this vast devastation, given in one of the  inscriptions on the Monument, and which was drawn up from the reports of  the surveyors appointed after the fire, it is stated, that \"The ruins of  the city were 436 acres, [viz. 333 acres within the walls, and 63 in the  liberties of the city;] that, of the six-and-twenty wards, it utterly  destroyed fifteen, and left eight others shattered and half burnt;  and that it consumed 400 streets, 13,200 dwelling-houses, 89 churches  [besides chapels; 4 of] the city gates, Guildhall, many public  structures, hospitals,"]]]
