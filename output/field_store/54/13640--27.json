The review did her infinite  credit; it was frank, candid, independent--in even ludicrous contrast  to the usual mere glorifications of the day, giving honor _only_ where  honor was due, yet evincing the most thorough capacity to appreciate  and the most sincere intention to place in the fairest light the real  and idiosyncratic merits of the poet. In my opinion it is one of the  very few reviews of Longfellow's poems, ever published in America,  of which the critics have not had abundant reason to be ashamed. Mr.  Longfellow is entitled to a certain and very distinguished rank among  the poets of his country, but that country is disgraced by the evident  toadyism which would award to his social position and influence, to  his fine paper and large type, to his morocco binding and gilt edges,  to his flattering portrait of himself, and to the illustrations of his  poems by Huntingdon, that amount of indiscriminate approbation which  neither could nor would have been given to the poems themselves. The  defense of Harro Harring, or rather the philippic against those who  were doing him wrong, was one of the most eloquent and well-_put_  articles I have ever yet seen in a newspaper.    \"'Woman in the Nineteenth Century' is a book which few women in the  country could have written, and no woman in the country would  have published, with the exception of Miss Fuller. In the way of  independence, of unmitigated radicalism, it is one of the 'Curiosities  of American Literature,' and Doctor Griswold should include it in  his book. I need scarcely say that the essay is nervous, forcible,  suggestive, brilliant, and to a certain extent scholar-like--for  all that Miss Fuller produces is entitled to these epithets--but I  must say that the conclusions reached are only in part my own. Not  that they are bold, by any means--too novel, too startling or too  dangerous in their consequences, but that in their attainment too many  premises have been distorted, and too many analogical inferences left  altogether out of sight. I mean to say that the intention of the Deity  as regards sexual differences--an intention which can be distinctly  comprehended only by throwing the exterior (more sensitive) portions  of the mental retina _casually_ over the wide field of universal  _analogy_--I mean to say that this _intention_ has not been  sufficiently considered. Miss Fuller has erred, too, through her own  excessive objectiveness. She judges _woman_ by the heart and intellect  of Miss Fuller, but there are not more than one or two dozen Miss  Fullers on the whole face of the earth. Holding these opinions in  regard to 'Woman in the Nineteenth Century,' I still feel myself  called upon to disavow the silly, condemnatory criticism of the  work which appeared in one of the earlier numbers of \"_The Broadway  Journal_.\" That article was _not_ written by myself, and _was_ written  by my associate, Mr. Briggs.    \"The most favorable estimate of Miss Fuller's genius (for high genius  she unquestionably possesses) is to be obtained, perhaps, from her  contributions to 'The Dial,' and from her 'Summer on the Lakes.' Many  of the _descriptions_ in this volume are unrivaled for _graphicality_,  (why is there not such a word?) for the force with which they convey  the true by the novel or unexpected, by the introduction of touches  which other artists would be sure to omit as irrelevant to the  subject. This faculty, too, springs from her subjectiveness, which  leads her to paint a scene less by its features than by its effects.    \"Here, for example, is a portion of her account of Niagara:--        \"'Daily these proportions widened and towered more and more      upon my sight, and I got at last a proper foreground for these      sublime distances. Before coming away, I think I really saw      the full wonder of the scene. After a while it _so drew me      into itself as to inspire an undefined dread, such as I never      knew before, such as may be felt when death is about to usher      us into a new existence_. The perpetual trampling of the      waters seized my senses. _I felt that no other sound, however      near, could be heard, and would start and look behind me for a      foe_. I realised the identity of that mood of nature in which      these waters were poured down with such absorbing force, with      that in which the Indian was shaped on the same soil. For      continually upon my mind came, unsought and unwelcome, _images      such as had never haunted it before, of naked savages stealing      behind me with uplifted tomahawks_. Again and again this      illusion recurred, and even _after I had thought it over, and      tried to shake it off, I could not help starting and looking      behind me_. What I liked best was to sit on Table Rock close      to the great fall; _there all power of observing details, all      separate consciousness was quite lost_.'    \"The truthfulness of the passages italicized will be felt by all; the  feelings described are, perhaps, experienced by every (imaginative)  person who visits the fall; but most persons, through predominant  subjectiveness, would scarcely be conscious of the feelings, or, at  best, would never think of employing them in an attempt to convey to  others an impression of the scene. Hence so many desperate failures to  convey it on the part of ordinary tourists. Mr. William W. Lord, to be  sure, in his poem 'Niagara,' is sufficiently objective; he describes  not the fall, but very properly, the effect of the fall upon _him_.  He says that it made him think of his _own_ greatness, of his _own_  superiority, and so forth, and so forth; and it is only when we  come to think that the thought of Mr. Lord's greatness is quite  idiosyncratic confined exclusively to Mr. Lord, that we are in  condition to understand how, in spite of his objectiveness he has  failed to convey an idea of anything beyond one Mr. William W. Lord.    \"From the essay entitled 'Philip Van Artevelde, I copy a paragraph  which will serve at once to exemplify Miss Fuller's more earnest  (declamatory) style, and to show the tenor of her prospective  speculations:--        \"'At Chicago I read again 'Philip Van Artevelde,' and certain      passages in it will always be in my mind associated with the      deep sound of the lake, as heard in the night. I used to read      a short time at night, and then open the blind to look out.      The moon would be full upon the lake, and the calm breath,      pure light, and the deep voice, harmonized well with the      thought of the Flemish hero. When will this country have      such a man? It is what she needs--no thin Idealist, no coarse      Realist, but a man whose eye reads the heavens while his      feet step firmly on the ground, and his hands are strong and      dexterous in the use of human instruments. A man, religious,      virtuous, and--sagacious; a man of universal sympathies, but      self-possessed; a man who knows the region of emotion, though      he is not its slave; a man to whom this world is no mere      spectacle or fleeting shadow, but a great, solemn game, to be      played with good heed, for its stakes are of eternal value,      yet who, if his own play be true, heeds not what he loses by      the falsehood of others. A man who lives from the past, yet      knows that its honey can but moderately avail him; whose      comprehensive eye scans the present, neither infatuated by its      golden lures nor chilled by its many ventures; who possesses      prescience, as the wise man must, but not so far as to be      driven mad to-day by the gift which discerns to-morrow. When      there is such a man for America, the thought which urges her      on will be expressed.\"    \"From what I have quoted, a _general_ conception of the prose style  of the authoress may be gathered. Her manner, however, is infinitely  varied. It is always forcible--but I am not sure that it is always  anything else, unless I say picturesque. It rather indicates than  evinces scholarship. Perhaps only the scholastic, or, more properly,  those accustomed to look narrowly at the structure of phrases, would  be willing to acquit her of ignorance of grammar--would be willing  to attribute her slovenliness to disregard of the shell in anxiety  for the kernel; or to waywardness, or to affectation, or to blind  reverence to Carlyle--would be able to detect, in her strange and  continual inaccuracies, a capacity for the accurate.        \"'I cannot sympathize with such an apprehension; the spectacle      is _capable to_ swallow _up_ all such objects.\"        \"It is fearful, too, to know, as you look, that whatever has      been swallowed by the cataract, is _like_ to rise suddenly to      light.\"        \"I took our _mutual_ friends to see her.\"        \"It was always obvious that they had nothing in common      _between them_.\"        \"The Indian cannot be looked at truly _except_ by a poetic      eye.\"        \"McKenny's Tour to the Lakes gives some facts not to be met      _with_ elsewhere.\"        \"There is that mixture of culture and rudeness in the aspect      of things _as_ gives a feeling of freedom,\" etc., etc.    \"These are merely a few, a very few instances, taken at random from  among a multitude of _willful_ murders committed by Miss Fuller on  the American of President Polk. She uses, too, the word 'ignore,' a  vulgarity adopted only of late days (and to no good purpose, since  there is no necessity for it) from the barbarisms of the law, and  makes no scruple of giving the Yankee interpretation to the verbs  'witness' and 'realize,' to say nothing of 'use,' as in the sentence,  'I used to read a short time at night.' It will not do to say in  defense of such words, that in such senses they may be found in  certain dictionaries--in that of Bolles', for instance;--_some_ kind  of 'authority' may be found for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13646"],[0,"A Book of Nonsense (#2)"],[1," Old Man of th' Abruzzi.
