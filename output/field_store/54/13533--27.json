The tower,  which is surmounted by four pinnacles, was repaired in 1818 and 1819; and  the choir has been recently restored in conformity with the original  design, under the superintendence of that indefatigable architect, Mr.  George Gwilt.[2] The dramatists, Fletcher and Massinger were buried in  this church in one grave; and from the tower, Hollar drew his Views of  London, both before and after the fire.        [2] Only the tower and the choir have yet been restored; but the      fidelity with which these portions have been executed, heightens      our anxiety for the renovation of the whole structure. The repairs      of the south transept will, we believe, be shortly commenced, but      the fate of the nave and aisles is not yet decided. These are in a      dilapidated condition.        Mr. Gwilt has already expended much time and research into the      history of this very interesting structure. On our last week-day      visit to the church, we saw the fine arch of a Saxon door just      uncovered after a concealment of many ages, in one of the surveys      of this erudite artist, who is sedulously attached to the study of      antiquities, and is an honour to his profession. We ought not to      forget the altar-screen which has lately been restored under Mr.      Gwilt's superintendence. Indeed, the inspection of this venerable      fabric will repay a walk from the most remote corner of the      metropolis.    Besides the tomb of Gower, there are monuments to Launcelot Andrews,  Bishop of Winchester; Richard Humble, Alderman of London, erected in  1616; and several others. Gower's monument was once very splendid, but  its present state is not very indicative of the gratitude of the parish  in which he perpetuated his munificence by erecting one of the finest  churches in the metropolis.           *       *       *       *       *    In 1737, so slight and infrequent was the intercourse betwixt London and  Edinburgh, that men still alive (1818) remember that upon one occasion  the mail from the former city arrived at the General Post-Office in  Scotland, with only one letter in it--_Scott's Novels_.           *       *       *       *       *      A SECOND CHAPTER ON KISSING.    BY A NOVICE IN THE ART.    (_For the Mirror_.)          --------------Our first father      Smiled with superior love, as Jupiter      On Juno smiles, when he impregns the clouds,      That shed May flowers, and pressed her matron lip      With _kisses_ pure.                   _Par. Lost_, b. 4, 1. 499--502.            --------Kissing the world begun,          And I hope it will never be done      _Old Song_.    Kissing has been practised in various modes, and for various purposes,  from a period of very remote antiquity. Among the ancient oriental  nations, presents from a superior were saluted by kissing, to express  gratitude and submission to the person conferring the favour. Reference  is made to this custom, Genesis, ch. xl. v. 41, \"According to thy words  shall my people be ruled;\" or, as the margin, supported by most eminent  critics, renders it, \"At thy mouth shall my people _kiss_.\" The  consecration of the Jewish kings to the regal authority was sealed by a  kiss from the officiator in the ceremony: 1 Sam. ch. x. v. 1. Kissing was  also employed in the heathen worship as a religious rite. Cicero mentions  a statue of Hercules, the chin and lips of which were considerably worn  by the repeated kissing of the worshippers. When too far removed to be  approached in this manner, it was usual to place the right hand upon the  statue, and return it to the lips. That traces of these customs remain to  the present day, kissing the Testament on oath in our courts of  judicature, and kissing the hand as a respectful salute, afford  sufficient evidence. But it is with kissing as a mode of expressing  affection or endearment that we are principally concerned, and its use,  as such, is of equal (perhaps greater) antiquity with any of the  preceding usages. To the passage cited, MIRROR, No. 357, by _Professor  Childe Wilful_, on this subject, may be added the meeting of Telemachus  and Ulysses on the return of the latter from Troy, as described, Odyssey,  lib. 16, v. 186--218; and the history of the courtship of the patriarch  Jacob and the \"fair damsel\" Rachel, Genesis, ch. xxix. v. 11. This last  authority, though it must be acknowledged not so classical as the  foregoing, is nevertheless much more piquant, being perhaps the oldest  record of amorous kissing extant. Thou seest, therefore, courteous  reader, that this \"divine custom,\" in addition to the claims upon thee  which it intrinsically possesseth, and which are neither few nor small,  hath moreover the universal suffrage of the highest antiquity; thou  seest that its date, so far from being confined to the Trojan or Saxon  age, can with certainty be traced to patriarchal times; yea, verily, and  I cannot find it in me to rest here, without conducting thee to an era  even more remote. Revert thine eye to the motto at the head of this  chapter. Doth it not carry thee back in spirit to the very baby hours of  creation, the \"good old days of Adam and Eve?\" and doth it not represent  unto thee this delightful art as known and practised in full perfection,  \"when young time told his first birth-days by the sun?\" I grant thee that  such an authority is not sufficiently critical to fix with precision the  \"_ab initio_\" of the custom; yet doth it not possess infinite claim upon  thy credence? and more especially when thou considerest that, our  respectable progenitors, the antediluvians, were visited with the deluge  of waters for little else than their license. Vide chap. vi. of the first  book of Moses called Genesis, _passim_. In a world, of which almost all  we know with certainty is its uncertainty, and that \"the fashion thereof  passeth away,\" it is only a natural inquiry whether the custom of kissing  hath, like most others, undergone any material alteration. Perhaps from  its nature, it is as little subjected to versatility from the lapse of  ages as any; yet still, to say that it has experienced some change, would  not be hazarding a very improbable opinion. Who knows but the \"clamorous  smack\" wherewith the Jehu of an eight-horse wagon salutes the lips of his  rosy inamorata, (scarcely less audible than the crack of his heavy thong  on Smiler's dull sides,) may have been perfectly consistent with the acme  of politesse some centuries bygone. We speak here somewhat confidently.  Hear what an amorous votary of the Muses in the olden time, Robert  Herrick, saith with respect to kissing:--.        \"Pout your joined lips--then _speak_ your kiss.\"    If this were the present orthodox creed of kissing, it would most  woefully spoil the sport of many a gallant youth, who, with the most  polite officiousness, extinguishes (by pure accident of course) while  professing to snuff, the candles, only that he may snatch a hasty,  unobserved kiss of the smiling maiden, whose proximity hath so  irresistibly tempted him. I wish the professor who hath already obliged  us with a chapter on kissing, would lay us under greater and more  manifold obligations, by a course of lectures on the same subject; and if  I laid wagers, I would wager my judgment to a cockle-shell, that  Socrates' discourse on marriage did not produce a more beneficial effect  than would his lecture; and that few untasted lips would be found,  either among his auditors, or those whose fortune it should be to fall in  the way of those auditors; but as it is at present, (for, alas! these are  not the days of Polydore Virgil or Erasmus,) we are compelled, albeit  somewhat grumblingly, to be content with but a very limited share of such  blisses. Not that I doubt (heaven forbid that I should) the real  inclination or the ability of at least the juvenile part of my fair  countrywomen to be much more liberal than they generally are in this way;  but, \"dear, confounded creatures,\" as Will Honeycomb says, what with the  trammels of education and domestic restraint, they are prevented from  appearing, as they \"really are, the best good-natured things alive.\" So  much innocent hypocrisy, so much _mauvaise honte_, so many of \"the  whispered _no_, so little meant,\" that they are practical antitheses to  themselves. \"Can danger lurk within a kiss.\" But all fathers are not  Coleridges, nor are all mothers Woolstonecrafts.    I plead not for libertinism, though only in so simple and innocent a form  as kissing. I do not long for the repetition (or more properly  commencement) of Polydore Virgil's days of \"promiscuous\" kisses. Let  these remain, as heretofore, in fiction, and in fiction alone. \"A glutted  market makes provisions cheap,\" saith Pope. True, saith experience.        \"------The lip that all may press,      Shall never more be pressed by mine,\"    saith Moore. _Sic ego_. But there is a medium to be observed between  gluttony and absolute starvation, and \"_medio tutis-simus ibis_,\" saith  the proverb; and I do beg to tell those over cautious ladies and  gentlemen, who seem to know no medium between the cloistered nun and the  abandoned profligate, that Nature will prevail in their spite, or, as  Obadiah wisely and truly said, \"When lambs meet they will play.\" And now,  reader, kind, courteous, gentle, or whatever thou art, I bid thee adieu,  with the hope, that if we agree at this, we may meet again on some future  occasion.

Volume 19, No. 539, March (#2)"],[1," of his _Rein-deer_,  believing these animals understand and will obey his oral directions. The  _Elk_ is accounted by the Indians an animal of good omen, and often to  dream of him indicates a long life. They imagine also the existence of a  gigantic elk, which walks without difficulty in eight feet of snow, has an  arm growing from its shoulder which it uses as we do, is invulnerable to  all weapons, is king of the elks and attended by a numerous herd of  courtiers. The fur of the _Glutton_ is so valued by the Kamschatdales that  they say celestial beings are clad in no other.    It was long a popular error that the _Porcupine_, when irritated,  discharged its quills at its adversary; that these quills were poisonous,  and rendered wounds inflicted by them difficult to cure: a better  acquaintance with the natural history of this harmless animal has now  exploded these fables. Our British porcupine, the innocuous _Hedgehog_,  has long been the object of unceasing persecution, from the popular belief  that it bites and sucks the udders of cows, an absurdity sufficiently  contradicted by the smallness of its mouth. In like manner, the  _Goat-sucker_ is a persecuted bird, since, as its name implies, it has been  thought to suck the teats of goats and other animals; whereas the form of  its bill entirely precludes such an act, and it is an inoffensive bird,  living upon insects. The superstition has probably originated from its  being often found in warm climates under cattle, capturing the insects  that torment them. It is supposed, in some places, that the _Shrew-mouse_  is of so baneful and deleterious a nature that whenever it creeps over a  beast, cow, sheep, or horse (in particular), the animal is afflicted with  cruel anguish, and threatened with a loss of the use of its limb.  A shrew-ash was the remedy for this misfortune, viz. an ash whose twigs or  branches gently applied to the affected members relieved the pain: our  provident forefathers, anticipating such an accident to their cattle,  always kept a shrew-ash at hand, which, once medicated, retained its  virtue for ever: it was thus prepared: into the body of an ash a deep hole  was bored with an auger, and a poor devoted shrew-mouse being thrust into  it, the orifice was plugged up, probably with quaint incantations now  forgotten.    The _Toad_, owing to its hideous, disgusting appearance, has been the  subject of many superstitions: it is commonly thought to spit venom,  whilst, as yet, the question is unsettled, whether or not it be poisonous  in any respect; some affirm that a viscous humour of poisonous quality  exudes from the skin, like perspiration; whilst others pretend that  cancers may be cured by the application of living toads to them; and a man  has been known to swallow one of these abominations for a wager, taking  care, however, to follow this horrid meal by an immediate and copious  draught of oil. But the very glance of the toad has been supposed fatal;  of its entrails fancied poisonous potions have been concocted; and for  magical purposes it was believed extremely efficacious; a precious stone  was asserted to be found in its head, invaluable in medicine and magic. In  Carthagena and Portobello (America) these creatures swarm to such a degree  in wet weather that many of the inhabitants believe every drop of rain to  be converted into a toad. It is said of the Pipa, or Surinam toad, a  hideous, but probably harmless, animal, that very malignant effects are  experienced from it when calcined.    The _Crocodile_ is feigned to weep and groan like a human being in pain  and distress, in order to excite the sympathy of man, and thus allure him  into his tremendous jaws.    The _Lizard_, though now declared by naturalists to be perfectly harmless,  was long considered poisonous by the ignorant; and in Sweden and  Kamschatka, the green lizard is the subject of strange superstitions, and  regarded with horror. Newts, efts, swifts, snakes, and blind-worms are,  in popular credence, all venomous; and that the _Ear-wig_ most justly  derives its name from entering people's ears, and either causing deafness,  or, by penetrating to the brain, death itself, is with many considered an  indisputable fact. The Irish have a large beetle of which strange tales  are believed; they term it the _Coffin-cutter_, and it has some connexion  with the grave and purgatory, not now, unfortunately, to be recalled to  our memory.    It is, in Germany, a popular belief, that the _Stag-beetle_ (perhaps the  same insect) carries burning coals into houses by means of its jaws, and  that it has thus occasioned many dreadful fires. (How convenient would  _Swing_ find such a superstition in England!) The _Death-watch_  superstition is too well known to need particular notice in this paper. It  is singular that the _House-cricket_ should by some persons be considered  an unlucky, by others a lucky, inmate of the mansion: those who hold the  latter opinion consider its destruction the means of bringing misfortune  on their habitations. \"In Dumfries-shire,\" says Sir William Jardine, \"it  is a common superstition that if crickets forsake a house which they have  long inhabited, some evil will befal the family; generally the death of  some member is portended. In like manner the presence or return of this  cheerful little insect is lucky, and portends some good to the family.\"    (_To be continued_.)           *       *       *       *       *        NOTES OF A READER.      DOMESTIC LIFE IN AMERICA.    _Servants_.    The following sketch of what the Americans feel on this point, from Mrs.  Trollope's _Domestic Manners of the Americans_, is clever and amusing:--    \"The greatest difficulty in organizing a family establishment in Ohio is  getting servants, or, as it is there called, 'getting help,' for it is  more than petty treason to the republic to call a free citizen a _servant_.  The whole class of young women, whose bread depends upon their labour, are  taught to believe that the most abject poverty is preferable to domestic  service. Hundreds of half-naked girls work in the paper-mills, or in any  other manufactory, for less than half the wages they would receive in  service: but they think their equality is compromised by the latter, and  nothing but the wish to obtain some particular article of finery will ever  induce them to submit to it. A kind friend, however, exerted herself so  effectually for me, that a tall stately lass soon presented herself,  saying, 'I be come to help you.' The intelligence was very agreeable, and  I welcomed her in the most gracious manner possible, and asked what I  should give her by the year. 'Oh Gimini!' exclaimed the damsel, with a  loud laugh, 'you be a downright Englisher, sure enough. I should like to  see a young lady engage by the year in America! I hope I shall get a  husband before many months, or I expect I shall be an outright old maid,  for I be most seventeen already; besides, mayhap I may want to go to  school. You must just give me a dollar and a half a week; and mother's  slave, Phillis, must come over once a week, I expect, from t'other side  the water, to help me clean.' I agreed to the bargain, of course, with all  dutiful submission; and seeing she was preparing to set to work in a  yellow dress parseme with red roses, I gently hinted, that I thought it  was a pity to spoil so fine a gown, and that she had better change it.  ''Tis just my best and worst,' she answered, 'for I've got no other.' And  in truth I found that this young lady had left the paternal mansion with  no more clothes of any kind than what she had on. I immediately gave her  money to purchase what was necessary for cleanliness and decency, and set  to work with my daughters to make her a gown. She grinned applause when  our labour was completed, but never uttered the slightest expression of  gratitude for that or for anything else we could do for her. She was  constantly asking us to lend her different articles of dress, and when we  declined it, she said, 'Well, I never seed such grumpy folks as you be;  there is several young ladies of my acquaintance what goes to live out now  and then with the old women about the town, and they and their gurls  always lends them what they asks for; I guess, you Inglish thinks we  should poison your things, just as bad as if we was negurs.' And here I  beg to assure the reader, that whenever I give conversations, they were  not made _a loisir_, but were written down immediately after they occurred,  with all the verbal fidelity my memory permitted.\"    \"This young lady left me at the end of two months, because I refused to  lend her money enough to buy a silk dress to go to a ball, saying, 'Then  it is not worth my while to stay any longer.' I cannot imagine it possible  that such a state of things can be desirable or beneficial to any of the  parties concerned. I might occupy a hundred pages on the subject, and yet  fail to give an adequate idea of the sore, angry, ever-wakeful pride that  seemed to torment these poor wretches. In many of them it was so excessive,  that all feeling of displeasure, or even of ridicule, was lost in pity.  One of these was a pretty girl, whose natural disposition must have been  gentle and kind; but her good feelings were soured, and her gentleness  turned into morbid sensitiveness, by having heard a thousand and a  thousand times that she was as good as any other lady, that all men were  equal, and women too, and that it was a sin and a shame for a free-born  American to be treated like a servant. When she found she was to dine in  the kitchen, she turned up her pretty lip, and said, 'I guess that's  'cause you don't think I'm good enough to eat with you. You'll find that  won't do here.' I found afterwards that she rarely ate any dinner at all,  and generally passed the time in tears. I did everything in my power to  conciliate and make her happy, but I am sure she hated "]]]
