The writer has no apology to offer for this cheap little book of  economical hints, except her deep conviction that such a book is  needed. In this case, renown is out of the question, and ridicule is a  matter of indifference.    The information conveyed is of a common kind; but it is such as the  majority of young housekeepers do not possess, and such as they  cannot obtain from cookery books. Books of this kind have usually  been written for the wealthy: I have written for the poor. I have said  nothing about _rich_ cooking; those who can afford to be epicures  will find the best of information in the 'Seventy-five Receipts.'  I have attempted to teach how money can be _saved_, not how it can  be _enjoyed_. If any persons think some of the maxims too rigidly  economical, let them inquire how the largest fortunes among us have  been made. They will find thousands and millions have been accumulated  by a scrupulous attention to sums 'infinitely more minute than sixty  cents.'    In early childhood, you lay the foundation of poverty or riches, in  the habits you give your children. Teach them to save everything,--not  for their _own_ use, for that would make them selfish--but for _some_  use. Teach them to _share_ everything with their playmates; but never  allow them to _destroy_ anything.    I once visited a family where the most exact economy was observed; yet  nothing was mean or uncomfortable. It is the character of true economy  to be as comfortable and genteel with a little, as others can be with  much. In this family, when the father brought home a package, the  older children would, of their own accord, put away the paper and  twine neatly, instead of throwing them in the fire, or tearing  them to pieces. If the little ones wanted a piece of twine to play  scratch-cradle, or spin a top, there it was, in readiness; and when  they threw it upon the floor, the older children had no need to be  told to put it again in its place.    The other day, I heard a mechanic say, 'I have a wife and two little  children; we live in a very small house; but, to save my life, I  cannot spend less than twelve hundred a year.' Another replied,  'You are not economical; I spend but eight hundred.' I thought to  myself,--'Neither of you pick up your twine and paper.' A third one,  who was present, was silent; but after they were gone, he said, 'I  keep house, and comfortably too, with a wife and children, for six  hundred a year; but I suppose they would have thought me mean, if I  had told them so.' I did not think him mean; it merely occurred to me  that his wife and children were in the habit of picking up paper and  twine.    Economy is generally despised as a low virtue, tending to make people  ungenerous and selfish. This is true of avarice; but it is not so  of economy. The man who is economical, is laying up for himself the  permanent power of being useful and generous. He who thoughtlessly  gives away ten dollars, when he owes a hundred more than he can pay,  deserves no praise,--he obeys a sudden impulse, more like instinct  than reason: it would be real charity to check this feeling; because  the good he does maybe doubtful, while the injury he does his family  and creditors is certain. True economy is a careful treasurer in the  service of benevolence; and where they are united respectability,  prosperity and peace will follow.           *       *       *       *       *          ODD SCRAPS FOR THE ECONOMICAL.      If you would avoid waste in your family, attend to the following  rules, and do not despise them because they appear so unimportant:  'many a little makes a mickle.'    Look frequently to the pails, to see that nothing is thrown to the  pigs which should have been in the grease-pot.    Look to the grease-pot, and see that nothing is there which might have  served to nourish your own family, or a poorer one.    See that the beef and pork are always _under_ brine; and that the  brine is sweet and clean.    Count towels, sheets, spoons, &c. occasionally; that those who use  them may not become careless.    See that the vegetables are neither sprouting nor decaying: if they  are so, remove them to a drier place, and spread them.    Examine preserves, to see that they are not contracting mould; and  your pickles, to see that they are not growing soft and tasteless.    As far as it is possible, have bits of bread eaten up before they  become hard. Spread those that are not eaten, and let them dry, to be  pounded for puddings, or soaked for brewis. Brewis is made of crusts  and dry pieces of bread, soaked a good while in hot milk, mashed up,  and salted, and buttered like toast. Above all, do not let crusts  accumulate in such quantities that they cannot be used. With proper  care, there is no need of losing a particle of bread, even in the  hottest weather.    Attend to all the mending in the house, once a week, if possible.  Never put out sewing. If it be impossible to do it in your own family,  hire some one into the house, and work with them.    Make your own bread and cake. Some people think it is just as cheap  to buy of the baker and confectioner; but it is not half as cheap.  True, it is more convenient; and therefore the rich are justifiable  in employing them; but those who are under the necessity of being  economical, should make convenience a secondary object. In the first  place, confectioners make their cake richer than people of moderate  income can afford to make it; in the next place, your domestic, or  yourself, may just as well employ your own time, as to pay them for  theirs.    When ivory-handled knives turn yellow, rub them with nice sand paper,  or emery; it will take off the spots, and restore their whiteness.    When a carpet is faded, I have been told that it may be restored, in  a great measure, (provided there be no grease in it,) by being dipped  into strong salt and water. I never tried this; but I know that silk  pocket handkerchiefs, and deep blue factory cotton will not fade, if  dipped in salt and water while new.    An ox's gall will set any color,--silk, cotton, or woollen. I have  seen the colors of calico, which faded at one washing, fixed by it.  Where one lives near a slaughterhouse, it is worth while to buy cheap,  fading goods, and set them in this way. The gall can be bought for a  few cents. Get out all the liquid, and cork it up in a large phial.  One large spoonful of this in a gallon of warm water is sufficient.  This is likewise excellent for taking out spots from bombazine,  bombazet, &c. After being washed in this, they look about as well as  when new. It must be thoroughly stirred into the water, and not put  upon the cloth. It is used without soap. After being washed in this,  cloth which you want to _clean_ should be washed in warm suds, without  using soap.    Tortoise shell and horn combs last much longer for having oil rubbed  into them once in a while.    Indian meal and rye meal are in danger of fermenting in summer;  particularly Indian. They should be kept in a cool place, and stirred  open to the air, once in a while. A large stone, put in the middle of  a barrel of meal, is a good thing to keep it cool.    The covering of oil-flasks, sewed together with strong thread, and  lined and bound neatly, makes useful tablemats.    A warming-pan full of coals, or a shovel of coals, held over varnished  furniture, will take out white spots. Care should be taken not to hold  the coals near enough to scorch; and the place should be rubbed with  flannel while warm.    Spots in furniture may usually be cleansed by rubbing them quick and  hard, with a flannel wet with the same thing which took out the color;  if rum, wet the cloth with rum, &c. The very best restorative for  defaced varnished furniture, is rotten-stone pulverized, and rubbed on  with linseed oil.    Sal-volatile, or hartshorn, will restore colors taken out by acid. It  may be dropped upon any garment without doing harm.    Spirits of turpentine is good to take grease-spots out of woollen  clothes; to take spots of paint, &c., from mahogany furniture; and  to cleanse white kid gloves. Cockroaches, and all vermin, have an  aversion to spirits of turpentine.    An ounce of quicksilver, beat up with the white of two eggs, and put  on with a feather, is the cleanest and surest bed-bug poison. What  is left should be thrown away: it is dangerous to have it about  the house. If the vermin are in your walls, fill up the cracks with  _verdigris_-green paint.[1]    [Footnote 1: There are two kinds of green paint; one is of no use in  destroying insects.]    Lamps will have a less disagreeable smell if you dip your wick-yarn in  strong hot vinegar, and dry it.    Those who make candles will find it a great improvement to steep the  wicks in lime-water and saltpetre, and dry them. The flame is clearer,  and the tallow will not '_run_.'    Britannia Ware should be first rubbed gently with a woollen cloth and  sweet oil; then washed in warm suds, and rubbed with soft leather and  whiting. Thus treated, it will retain its beauty to the last.    Eggs will keep almost any length of time in lime-water properly  prepared. One pint of coarse salt, and one pint of unslacked lime, to  a pailful of water. If there be too much lime, it will eat the shells  from the eggs; and if there be a single egg cracked, it will spoil  the whole. They should be covered with lime-water, and kept in a cold  place.

But it fairly  boiled in his blood when the Wild Geese, in long, double, arrow-headed  procession, went clanging northward. He longed to go with them.  Whenever a new bird or beast appeared, he had a singular prickling  feeling up his spine and his back as though he had a mane that was  standing up. This feeling strengthened with his strength.    All of his schoolmates used to say that they \"liked\" the spring, some  of the girls would even say that they \"dearly loved\" the spring, but  they could not understand the madness that blazed in Yan's eyes when  springtime really came--the flush of cheek--the shortening breath--the  restless craving for action--the chafing with flashes of rebellion at  school restraints--the overflow of nervous energy--the bloodthirst  in his blood--the hankering to run--to run to the north, when the  springtime tokens bugled to his every sense.    Then the wind and sky and ground were full of thrill. There was  clamour everywhere, but never a word. There was stirring within and  without. There was incentive in the yelping of the Wild Geese; but it  was only tumult, for he could not understand why he was so stirred.  There were voices that he could not hear--messages that he could not  read; all was confusion of tongues. He longed only to get away.    \"If only I could get away. If--if--Oh, God!\" he stammered in torment  of inexpression, and then would gasp and fling himself down on some  bank, and bite the twigs that chanced within reach and tremble and  wonder at himself.    Only one thing kept him from some mad and suicidal move--from joining  some roving Indian band up north, or gypsies nearer--and that was the  strong hand at home.          III    His Adjoining Brothers      Yan had many brothers, but only those next him in age were important  in his life. Rad was two years older--a strong boy, who prided himself  on his \"common sense.\" Though so much older, he was Yan's inferior  at school. He resented this, and delighted in showing his muscular  superiority at all opportunities. He was inclined to be religious,  and was strictly proper in his life and speech. He never was known to  smoke a cigarette, tell a lie, or say \"gosh\" or \"darn.\" He was plucky  and persevering, but he was cold and hard, without a human fiber or a  drop of red blood in his make-up. Even as a boy he bragged that he had  no enthusiasms, that he believed in common sense, that he called a  spade a spade, and would not use two words where one would do. His  intelligence was above the average, but he was so anxious to be  thought a person of rare sagacity and smartness, unswayed by emotion,  that nothing was too heartless for him to do if it seemed in line  with his assumed character. He was not especially selfish, and yet he  pretended to be so, simply that people should say of him significantly  and admiringly: \"Isn't he keen? Doesn't he know how to take care of  himself?\" What little human warmth there was in him died early, and he  succeeded only in making himself increasingly detested as he grew up.    His relations to Yan may be seen in one incident.    Yan had been crawling about under the house in the low wide cobwebby  space between the floor beams and the ground. The delightful sensation  of being on an exploring expedition led him farther (and ultimately to  a paternal thrashing for soiling his clothes), till he discovered a  hollow place near one side, where he could nearly stand upright. He  at once formed one of his schemes--to make a secret, or at least a  private, workroom here. He knew that if he were to ask permission  he would be refused, but if he and Rad together were to go it might  receive favourable consideration on account of Rad's self-asserted  reputation for common sense. For a wonder, Rad was impressed with the  scheme, but was quite sure that they had \"better not go together to  ask Father.\" He \"could manage that part better alone,\" and he did.    Then they set to work. The first thing was to deepen the hole from  three feet to six feet everywhere, and get rid of the earth by working  it back under the floor of the house. There were many days of labour  in this, and Yan stuck to it each day after returning from school.  There were always numerous reasons why Rad could not share in the  labour. When the ten by fourteen-foot hole was made, boards to line  and floor it were needed. Lumber was very cheap--inferior, second-hand  stuff was to be had for the asking--and Yan found and carried boards  enough to make the workroom. Rad was an able carpenter and now took  charge of the construction. They worked together evening after  evening, Yan discussing all manner of plans with warmth and  enthusiasm--what they would do in their workshop when finished--how  they might get a jig-saw in time and saw picture frames, so as to  make some money. Rad assented with grunts or an occasional Scripture  text--that was his way. Each day he told Yan what to go on with while  he was absent.    The walls were finished at length; a window placed in one side; a door  made and fitted with lock and key. What joy! Yan glowed with pleasure  and pride at the triumphant completion of his scheme. He swept up the  floor for the finishing ceremony and sat down on the bench for a grand  gloat, when Rad said abruptly:    \"Going to lock up now.\" That sounded gratifyingly important. Yan  stepped outside. Rad locked the door, put the key in his pocket, then  turning, he said with cold, brutal emphasis:    \"Now you keep out of my workshop from this on. _You_ have nothing  to do with it. It's mine. I got the permission to make it.\" All of  which he could prove, and did.           *       *       *       *       *    Alner, the youngest, was eighteen months younger than Yan, and about  the same size, but the resemblance stopped there. His chief aim in  life was to be stylish. He once startled his mother by inserting into  his childish prayers the perfectly sincere request: \"Please, God,  make me an awful swell, for Jesus sake.\" Vanity was his foible, and  laziness his sin.    He could be flattered into anything that did not involve effort. He  fairly ached to be famous. He was consuming with desire to be pointed  out for admiration as the great this, that or the other thing--it did  not matter to him what, as long as he could be pointed out. But he  never had the least idea of working for it. At school he was a sad  dunce. He was three grades below Yan and at the bottom of his grade.  They set out for school each day together, because that was a paternal  ruling; but they rarely reached there together. They had nothing in  common. Yan was full of warmth, enthusiasm, earnestness and energy,  but had a most passionate and ungovernable temper. Little put him in a  rage, but it was soon over, and then an equally violent reaction set  in, and he was always anxious to beg forgiveness and make friends  again. Alner was of lazy good temper and had a large sense of humour.  His interests were wholly in the playground. He had no sympathy with  Yan's Indian tastes--\"Indians in nasty, shabby clothes. Bah! Horrid!\"  he would scornfully say.    These, then, were his adjoining brothers.    What wonder that Yan was daily further from them.          IV    The Book      But the greatest event of Yan's then early life now took place. His  school readers told him about Wilson and Audubon, the first and last  American naturalists. Yan wondered why no other great prophet had  arisen. But one day the papers announced that at length he had  appeared. A work on the Birds of Canada, by ..., had come at last,  price one dollar.    Money never before seemed so precious, necessary and noble a thing.  \"Oh! if I only had a dollar.\" He set to work to save and scrape. He  won marbles in game, swopped marbles for tops, tops for jack-knives as  the various games came around with strange and rigid periodicity. The  jack-knives in turn were converted into rabbits, the rabbits into cash  of small denominations. He carried wood for strange householders;  he scraped and scraped and saved the scrapings; and got, after some  months, as high as ninety cents. But there was a dread fatality  about that last dime. No one seemed to have any more odd jobs; his  commercial luck deserted him. He was burnt up with craving for that  book. None of his people took interest enough in him to advance the  cash even at the ruinous interest (two or three times cent per cent)  that he was willing to bind himself for. Six weeks passed before he  achieved that last dime, and he never felt conscience-clear about it  afterward.    He and Alner had to cut the kitchen wood. Each had his daily  allotment, as well as other chores. Yan's was always done faithfully,  but the other evaded his work in every way. He was a notorious little  fop. The paternal poverty did not permit his toilet extravagance to  soar above one paper collar per week, but in his pocket he carried a  piece of ink eraser with which he was careful to keep the paper collar  up to standard. Yan cared nothing about dress--indeed, was inclined to  be slovenly. So the eldest brother, meaning to turn Alner's weakness  to account, offered a prize of a twenty-five-cent necktie of the  winner's own choice to the one who did his chores best for a month.  For the first week Alner and Yan kept even, then Alner wearied, in  spite of the dazzling prize. The pace was too hot. Yan kept on his  usual way and was duly awarded the twenty-five cents to be spent on a  necktie. But in the store a bright thought came tempting him. Fifteen  cents was as much as any one should spend on a necktie--that's sure;  the other ten would get the book. And thus the last dime was added to  the pile. Then, bursting with joy and with the pride of a capitalist,  he went to the book-shop and asked for the coveted volume.    He was tense with long-pent feeling. He expected to have the  bookseller say that the price"]]]
