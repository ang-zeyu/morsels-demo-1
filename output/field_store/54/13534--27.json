Pittsburgh, on the contrary, is dirty and confined, abounding in iron  works burning coal, which gives forth a denser smoke than English  coal. The houses in this place, when we visited it in 1818, were  mostly of wood; these have been in general removed on wheels drawn  by oxen and horses, and placed in the suburbs, whence they are now  removing once more. Here are four markets well supplied with the  necessaries, and even the luxuries, of life, including almost  everything you can think of, and many things which you have never  thought of. Apple butter, for instance, is one of the latter, and is  made by stewing apples in new cider, after it has been boiled down to  one-third of its bulk. It is sold at 6-1/4 cts. per quart, and is  very delicious. The fruits of this country are abundant: apples are  excellent, and in profusion; peaches are plentiful in most seasons,  but sometimes totally fail; grapes grow wild and _tame_, i.e.  cultivated or imported; cherries are not very good, and dearer than at  Pittsburgh; pears, strawberries, and raspberries are not so choice as  with you; quinces are plentiful and fine; wild plums perfume the whole  house, like jessamine or mignionette, and are excellent for pies and  tarts. The persimon is a fruit to which you are a stranger; it may be  ranked with the plums, but has four stones, and is not fit to eat till  bitten by the frost, when its austere and astringent taste disappears,  and it becomes nearly transparent, and as rich and sweet as Guava  jelly. The May-apple, or Mandrake, a wild fruit, is a favourite with  our young folks; it grows on a single-steemed plant, usually one foot  high, and is about the size of a plum, but with seeds, and in taste  resembling a highly flavoured pear. The custard-apple, or paw-paw, is  my favourite, and my boys go with me into the woods to gather them  when ripe. In the summer, water melons, musk melons, nutmeg melons,  and Cantaloupes may be seen in large heaps in the market, or in carts  or wagons, at 6-1/4 to 25 and 50 cts. each, some weighing 40 lbs.    Egg-plants, which you have seen as curiosities, are here brought to  market; some of them of purple colour, are as large as a child's  carpet-ball: they are sliced and fried in butter, and I am told  have the flavour of fried oysters. Cucumbers are unfortunately  superabundant, and the free use of them induces a variety of diseases  which are attributed to the climate. Squashes, cimolins, and cushas,  are gourds which are mashed up with butter like turnips; pumpkins  of this country are very sweet, and make delicious pies, or rather  cheesecakes; cranberries are brought from a distance, and pine-apples  are not very expensive, being brought up the river from Bermuda.    Among the natural curiosities of the country, are the Stone Mountain  in Carolina, which may rank in antiquity with Stonehenge. It is  remarkable for a circular wall of stone of great thickness, probably  built by a people distinct from the present race of Indians, who are  quite incapable of erecting any building except a wigwam, or a pile of  loose stones over a grave. Next is the Kentucky Cavern, or as it is  called, on account of its magnitude, the Mammoth Cave. I have an  account before me of its being explored by a party in 1826, who  penetrated into this gloomy, though spacious, hollow for _fifteen  miles_, and were prevented from proceeding from extreme fatigue; they  found the names of persons written at the farthest part. There are  numbers of rooms as they are called, which are yet unexplored. In one  of these, a few miles from the entrance, there was discovered many  years since, a female figure sitting with a mat wrapped round her  shoulders; she was quite dried to a mummy, and has for many years been  exhibited in a caravan, through the United States.    The river Ohio is here a quarter of a mile wide, and, as there is no  bridge, the traffic into Kentucky is accommodated with steam ferry  boats. Newport and Covington opposite, are pretty objects to look  at from this side, but will not bear a nearer inspection. _Big Bone  Lick_, where abundance of Mammoth bones have been discovered, is not  far hence. Mr. Bullock of the London Museum is here, and has at the  Lick discovered many rare specimens of bones, amongst which is a  mammoth's head, with evidence of its having been furnished with a  trunk, and of course having been an elephant of immense size. He has  also found hoofs of horses with their bones in a fossil state, proving  that the horse has been indigenous. The horses in this town being  a mixture from those of South America, where they are wild--are of  various colours. Some are brown and white, like pointer dogs, others  are spotted like Danish dogs, and some with curled hair. I saw one  which was white as far us the fore-quarter, and the rest sorel.    An eye-witness has just related to me the following, which lately  occured in New Harmony:        A snake about two feet long, was seen to enter the hole      inhabited by a crawfish,[2] from which he soon retreated,      followed by the rightful tenant, who stopped in defensive      attitude at the mouth of his habitation, raising his claws in      defiance. The snake turned quickly round, and seized the head of      the crawfish, as if to swallow him; but the crawfish soon put an      end to the conflict by clasping the snake's neck with his claws,      and severing the head completely from his body. This may appear      marvellous; but Audubon tells a story of a rattle-snake chasing      and over-taking a squirrel, which folks in America doubt.        [2] Is not this a species of land-crab?--ED.

The term porcelain, which is applied to it on the continent of  Europe, is Italian; _porcellana_ being in that language the name of  those univalve shells forming the genus _cypraea_ of the conchologist,  which have a high arched back like that of the hog (_porco_, Ital.),  and are remarkable for the white, smooth, vitreous glossiness of the  surface about the mouth of the shell, and sometimes, as in the common  cowry (_Cypraea moneta_), over the whole surface.        [3] By Mr. A. Aikin, in Trans. Soc. Arts.    The introduction of the Chinese porcelain soon excited a strong  desire in the various countries of Europe to imitate it; but as the  establishment of experimental manufactories for this purpose required  the expenditure of considerable sums, and at a risk beyond the means  of private persons, it is chiefly to the munificence of the sovereigns  of Europe that the public are indebted for the first steps made in  this interesting art. In Germany, chemists and mineralogists were set  to work; the latter to seek for the most appropriate raw materials,  and the former to purify and to combine them in the most advantageous  proportions. The French government adopted the very sensible plan of  instructing some of the Jesuit missionaries, who at that time had  penetrated to the court of China, and into most of the provinces  of that empire, to collect on the spot specimens of the materials  employed by the Chinese themselves, together with the particulars of  the process. The precise result thus obtained is not known; for as a  considerable rivalry existed between the different royal manufactories  of this ware, the most valuable information would of course be kept as  secret as possible.    Of the European manufactories of porcelain, that established at  Miessen, near Dresden, by Augustus Elector of Saxony and King of  Poland, in the early part of the 17th century, was the first that  aspired to a competition with the Chinese. In compactness of texture  and infusibility it was reckoned perfect a hundred years ago. It is  not quite so white as some of the French and English porcelains, but  is inferior to none in its painting, gilding, and other decorations.    The French royal manufactory at Sevres, near Paris, has been for  several years in a gradually advancing state, with regard to the  whiteness, compactness, and infusibility of the body, the elegance of  the forms, the brilliancy of the colours, the elaborateness of the  drawing, and the superb enrichments of the gilding. The private  manufactories of porcelain in France imitate and approach more or less  near to the royal establishment.    At Berlin and at Vienna are royal porcelain manufactories in high  esteem, as well as in some of the smaller states of Germany.    _BRITISH PORCELAIN._    The first manufactories of porcelain in England were those at Bow, and  at Chelsea, near London. In these, however, nothing but soft porcelain  was made.

PITIE TOUCHANTE    C'etait pendant la guerre de Crimee. Un soir de combat, deux  blesses gisaient cote a cote sur le champ de bataille. La nuit  tomba, et le froid terrible qui sevissait augmenta encore leurs  souffrances. Ils essayerent d'echanger quelques paroles, mais  ils ne se comprirent pas, car l'un etait un Francais et l'autre  etait un Russe. Le sommeil vint enfin clore leurs yeux. Helas!  ceux du Francais ne devaient plus voir le jour.    Le matin, en s'eveillant, le Russe vit sur lui un manteau qui  ne lui appartenait pas. Son voisin ne bougeait plus. Ce genereux  adversaire, sentant approcher la mort, avait jete sur son compagnon  d'infortune un vetement qui desormais lui etait inutile. Il avait  ainsi mis en pratique cette maxime: Soyons bons, meme envers  nos ennemis.--(D'apres BERSOT.)

Le grand homme se rend avec joie a cette demande, et remercie  l'auteur de la lettre de la bonne opinion qu'il a de lui; puis,  saisi tout a coup de mefiance, il ajoute: j'espere cependant  que votre demande n'est pas une ruse pour vous procurer mon  autographe.

AUGUSTE ET LE VETERAN    Le succes de nos affaires depend souvent de notre presence d'esprit.    Un vieux soldat d'Auguste, qui s'etait distingue par sa bravoure  et ses actions d'eclat, fut cite en justice sur une fausse  accusation. Il craignait d'etre condamne, car son adversaire etait  un grand officier de la cour. En cette conjoncture difficile, il  pria l'empereur lui-meme de prendre en main sa defense. Auguste  appela un de ses courtisans et lui dit: \"Je te recommande de  faire ton possible pour faire acquitter ce brave homme. Et toi,  continua-t-il en s'adressant au veteran, va en paix: tes affaires  sont en bonnes mains, ta cause triomphera.--Mon puissant empereur,  repliqua le soldat, quand votre pouvoir fut menace a la bataille  d'Actium, je n'ai point charge un autre du soin de votre defense.  J'ai combattu moi-meme, exposant ma vie pour sauver vos jours.  Voyez ces cicatrices! Ces traces ineffacables prouvent avec quel  devouement je vous ai servi!\" En meme temps il decouvrit sa poitrine  pour montrer les blessures qu'il avait recues. Cet appel hardi  a de vieux souvenirs valut au veteran la protection efficace  de l'empereur qui lui fit gagner sa cause.      De quoi depend quelquefois le succes de nos affaires?--Comment  le vieux soldat s'etait-il distingue?--Qu'est-ce qui lui est  arrive un jour?--Quel etait son adversaire?--Quelle priere a-t-il  adressee a l'empereur?--Entre les mains de qui l'empereur voulait-il  laisser l'affaire?--Comment a-t-il voulu rassurer le soldat?--Mais  qu'est-ce que celui-ci a trouve a redire a cela?--Quelles preuves  a-t-il montrees de son devouement?--Qu'est-ce que son appel lui  a valu?

LE MEDECIN ET SA MULE    Un Esculape, monte sur sa mule, allait voir un malade qui avait un  aposteme dans le larynx. Notre docteur rencontre une connaissance  a la porte meme de son client. Il quitte les etriers pour causer  plus a son aise, et laisse sa monture qui, trouvant la porte  ouverte, penetre toute seule dans la maison. La chambre du malade  etait au niveau du sol. La mule, d'un pas delibere, et toute  enharnachee, penetre dans l'appartement ou le pauvre diable etait  couche. Celui-ci, qui entend du bruit, s'imagine que c'est le  docteur, et avance son pouls sans se retourner. La mule, qui  voit un bras tendu devant elle sans savoir pourquoi, saisit le  poignet avec les dents. Le malade, epouvante, tourne la tete  et saute au bas du lit pour chasser l'animal; puis il est pris  d'un tel acces de rire, que l'aposteme en creve.    Le docteur, qui survient, veut flapper la mule a coups de cravache.  Mais le malade s'ecrie: \"Arretez, monsieur le docteur! il y a de  quoi etre emerveille de l'aventure: votre mule a gueri le mal  dont toute votre science ne pouvait venir a bout. Desormais,  s'il m'arrivait de retomber dans ce piteux etat, envoyez-moi  votre mule, et restez en paix chez vous.\"      Le medecin ou allait-il?--Allait-il a pied?--De quoi souffrait  son client?--Ou le medecin s'est-il arrete en route?--Est-il  descendu de sa mule?--Qu'a fait la bete ensuite?--L'entree de  la maison etait-elle facile?--Le malade a-t-il entendu entrer  quelqu'un?--Qu'a-t-il pense?--En quelle posture le malade se  trouvait-il?--La mule a-t-elle voulu jouer le role de  medecin?--A-t-elle tate le pouls du client?--Celui-ci a-t-il  ete surpris de trouver la mule dans sa chambre?--Quel heureux  effet la peur du malade a-t-elle eu?--Quel conseil cet homme  a-t-il donne au medecin?
