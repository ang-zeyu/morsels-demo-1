Coal has been found there, and some veins of copper; and however  inconsiderable the quantity of these articles that has been hitherto  found, yet the proof of their existence will naturally lead to farther  research, and most probably terminate in complete success.    The flax plant grows spontaneously, and may, with the assistance of  proper implements and other necessaries, be turned to very profitable  account.    The climate is for the most part temperate and healthy; cattle are  prolific; and fruits and culinary vegetables thrive with almost a  tropical luxuriance.    To be brief: Such is the English Colony in New South Wales, for which the  author is anxiously solicitous to obtain the candid consideration of his  countrymen; among whom it has been painful to him to remark a disposition  too prevalent for regarding it with odium and disgust.

His first work, _Bauernspiegel_ (\"The  Peasants' Mirror\"), was published in 1836, when he was thirty-nine years  old. From that time on until his death in 1854, his productivity was  most marvelous. _The Peasants' Mirror_ is the first village story that  deserves the name; here, for the first time, the world of the peasant  was presented as a distinct world by itself.[1] It is at the same time  one of the earliest, as well as the most splendid, products of realistic  art; and, considered in connection with his later writings, must be  regarded as his creed and program. For the motives of the several  chapters reappear later, worked out into complete books, and thus both  _Uli der Knecht_ (\"Uli, the Farmhand,\" 1841) and _Uli der Paechter_  (\"Uli, the Tenant,\" 1849) are foreshadowed here.    As a literary artist Gotthelf shows barely any progress in his whole  career, and intentionally so. Few writers of note have been so perfectly  indifferent to matters of form. The same Gottfried Keller who calls  Gotthelf \"without exception the greatest epic genius that has lived in a  long time, or perhaps will live for a long time to come,\" characterizes  him thus as to his style: \"With his strong, sharp spade he will dig out  a large piece of soil, load it on his literary wheelbarrow, and to the  accompaniment of strong language upset it before our feet; good garden  soil, grass, flowers and weeds, manure and stones, precious gold coins  and old shoes, fragments of crockery and bones--they all come to light  and mingle their sweet and foul smells in peaceful harmony.\" His  adherence to the principle _Naturalia non sunt turpia_ is indeed so  strict that at times a sensitive reader is tempted to hold his nose. It  is to be regretted that so great a genius in his outspoken preference  for all that is characteristic should have been so partial to the rude,  the crude, and the brutal. For Gotthelf's literary influence--which, to  be sure, did not make itself felt at once--has misled many less original  writers to consider these qualities as essential to naturalistic style.    Very largely in consequence of his indifference to form and the  naturalistic tendencies mentioned--for to all intents and purposes  Gotthelf must be regarded as the precursor of naturalism--the Swiss  writer did not gain immediate recognition in the world of letters, and  the credit rightfully belonging to him fell, as already mentioned, to  Berthold Auerbach (1812-1882), a native of the village of Nordstetten in  the Wuerttemberg portion of the Black Forest. From 1843-1853 Auerbach  published his _Black Forest Village Stories_, which at once became the  delight of the reading public. Auerbach himself claimed the distinction  of being the originator of this new species of narrative--an honor  which was also claimed by Alexander Weill, because of his _Sittengemaelde  aus dem Elsass_ (\"Genre Paintings from Alsace,\" 1843). While Gotthelf  had written only for his peasants, without any regard for others,  Auerbach wrote for the same general readers of fiction as the then  fashionable writers did. So far as his popularity among the readers of  the times and his influence on other authors are concerned, Auerbach has  a certain right to the coveted title, for a whole school of village  novelists followed at his heels; and his name must remain inseparably  connected with the history of the novel of provincial life. The  impression his stories made everywhere was so strong as to beggar  description. They afforded the genuine delight that we get from  murmuring brooks and flowering meadows--although the racy smell of the  soil that is wafted toward us from the pages of Gotthelf's writings is  no doubt more wholesome for a greater length of time. Auerbach has often  been charged with idealizing his peasants too much. It must be admitted  that his method and style are idealistic, but, at least in his best  works, no more so than is compatible with the demands of artistic  presentation. He does not, like Gotthelf, delight in painting a face  with all its wrinkles, warts, and freckles, but works more like the  portrait painter who will remove unsightly blemishes by retouching the  picture without in any way sacrificing its lifelike character. When  occasion demands he also shows himself capable of handling thoroughly  tragic themes with pronounced success. In his later years, it is true,  he fell into mannerism, overemphasized his inclination toward  didacticism and sententiousness, and allowed the philosopher to run away  with the poet by making his peasant folk think and speak as though they  were adepts in the system of Spinoza, with which Auerbach himself,  being of Jewish birth and having been educated to be a rabbi, was  intimately familiar. On the whole, however, the lasting impression we  obtain from Auerbach's literary work remains a very pleasant one--that  of a rich and characteristic life, sound to the core, vigorous and  buoyant.    Not as a writer of village stories--for in the portrayal of the rustic  population, as such, he was not concerned--but in his basic purpose of  holding up nature, pure and holy, as an ideal, Adalbert Stifter  (1805-1868), an Austrian, must be assigned a place of honor in this  group. A more incisive contrast to the general turbulence of the forties  could hardly be imagined than is found in the nature descriptions and  idyls of this quietist, who \"from the madding crowd's ignoble strife\"  sought refuge in the stillness of the country and among people to whom  such outward peace is a physical necessity. His feeling for nature,  especially for her minutest and seemingly most insignificant phenomena,  is closely akin to religion; there is an infinite charm in his  description of the mysterious life of apparently lifeless objects; he  renders all the sensuous impressions so masterfully that the reader  often has the feeling of a physical experience; and it is but natural  that up to his thirty-fifth year, before he discovered his literary  talent, he had dreamed of being a landscape painter. Hebbel's epigram,  \"Know ye why ye are such past masters in painting beetles and  buttercups? 'Tis because ye know not man; 'tis because ye see not the  stars,\" utterly fails to do justice to Stifter's poetic individuality.  But in avoiding the great tempests and serious conflicts of the human  heart he obeyed a healthy instinct of his artistic genius, choosing to  retain undisputed mastery in his own field.    It is, of course, an impossibility to treat adequately, in the remainder  of the space at our disposal, the poetic and general literary merit of  Fritz Reuter (1810-1874), the great regenerator and rejuvenator of Low  German as a literary language. His lasting merit in the field of the  village story is that by his exclusive use of dialect he threw an  effective safeguard around the naturalness of the emotional life of his  characters, and through this ingenious device will for all time to come  serve as a model to writers in this particular domain. For dialectic  utterance does not admit of any super-exaltation of sentiment; at any  rate, it helps to detect such at first glance. But there are other  features no less meritorious in his stories of rural life, chief of  which is that unique blending of seriousness and humor that makes us  laugh and cry at the same time. With his wise and kind heart, with his  deep sympathy for all human suffering, with the smile of understanding  for everything truly human, also for all the limitations and follies of  human nature, Reuter has worthily taken his place by the side of his  model, Charles Dickens. It is questionable whether even Dickens ever  created a character equal to the fine and excellent Uncle Braesig, who,  in the opinion of competent critics, is the most successful humorous  figure in all German literature. Braesig is certainly a masterpiece of  psychology; as remote from any mere comic effect, despite his  idiosyncrasies, as from maudlin sentimentality; an impersonation of  sturdy manhood and a victor in life's battles, no less than his creator,  who, although he had lost seven of the most precious years of his life  in unjust imprisonment and even had been under sentence of death for a  crime of which he knew himself to be absolutely innocent, had not  allowed his fate to make him a pessimist. Nor does the central theme and  idea of his masterpiece _Ut mine Stromtid_ (\"From my Roaming Days,\"  1862), in its strength and beauty, deserve less praise than the  character delineation. Four years previous, in _Kein Huesung_ (\"Homeless  \") the author had raised a bitter cry of distress over the social  injustice and the deceit and arrogance of the ruling classes. In spite  of a ray of sunshine at the end, the treatment was essentially tragic.  Now he has found a harmonious solution of the problem; the true  nobility of human nature triumphs over all social distinctions;  aristocracy of birth and yeomanry are forever united. Thus the marriage  of Louise Havermann with Franz von Rambow both symbolizes the fusion of  opposing social forces and exemplifies the lofty teaching of  Gotthelf--\"The light that is to illumine our fatherland must have its  birth at a fireside.\" With his gospel of true humanity the North German  poet supplements and brings to its full fruition the religious austerity  of the doctrines and precepts of Jeremias Gotthelf, the preacher on the  Alpine heights of Switzerland.           *       *       *       *          BERTHOLD AUERBACH        LITTLE BAREFOOT[2] (1856)      A TALE OF VILLAGE LIFE    TRANSLATED BY H.W.
