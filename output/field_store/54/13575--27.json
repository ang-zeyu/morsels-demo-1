The  following morning the _tailleur_ called while Colton was still in bed, for  the cash; he was shown into the bedroom by the miserable little urchin who  attended daily to light the fire, &c., and demanded in payment twenty  _sous_; this was resisted on the part of Colton as exorbitant, and the  _tailleur_, vexed at having parted with his work before payment, seized a  pair that were at the bedside, (imagining them the same that he had  stitched,) and was about to quit the room with them as security, when the  reverend gentleman, drawing a pistol from under his pillow, and presenting  it at the terrified mender of garments, swore he would favour him with the  contents unless the pantaloons were replaced: this was of course complied  with, and our indignant _tailleur_ immediately proceeded to _Monsieur le  Commissaire_, who dispatched messengers to require the attendance of the  party who had thus threatened the life of a Citizen of Paris. Colton then  explained that the pantaloons of which the plaintiff had taken possession,  were those he had worn on the preceding day, and contained cash that he  had brought from the gaming-house to the amount of nearly L2,000. He was  of course discharged on payment of the twenty _sous_ to the tailor.    Although generally considered mean, I have much pleasure in stating that I  have known him perform many acts of charity, frequently giving a dinner to  some one of his reduced countrymen, (of whom there are too many in Paris,)  and occasionally assisting them with small sums of money. It has been  stated that the dread of an operation which became necessary for a  complaint under which he laboured, was the cause of his suicide; this I  much doubt, since I have never met with a man of greater fortitude and  stronger nerve. I am rather disposed to think that the depressed state of  his finances, severing the only hold he had on his dissolute associates,  and the attention paid too often to wealth, though accompanied by vice,  having disappeared, he found himself pennyless and despised; he was  without religious consolation; his health declined, his spirits were  broken; he was, and felt himself, alone in the world, without friends and  without commiseration, and in a moment of desperation he put a period to  his reckless existence.    Your correspondent, _Enort_, has certainly viewed the sunny side of his  character; and that too I am disposed to think, with a burning glass. I  have passed many hours in his society, pleased with his wit and  epigrammatic sallies, but strive in vain to call to my recollection \"the  spontaneous flow of his Latin, his quotations from the ancient and modern  poets, and his masterly and eloquent developement of every subject that  his acute intellect chose to dilate upon.\" His conversation was ever  _egotistical_ in the extreme: the bold assertion that his _Lacon_ was the  most clever work in the English language, was ever on his lips, and I  regret to add, obscenity and irreligion too often supplied the place of  wit or rational converse.    _Palace Row, New Road_.    W.W.           *       *       *       *       *      KING KENULPH'S DAUGHTER.    This is little better than a versified _fact_. The outline may be found in  Sir Robert Atkyns' _History of Gloucestershire_, p. 435.        King Kenulph he died, as kings have died,      The will of the Lord be done;    And he left to the care of his daughter fair,      Queen Quendred, an infant son.    The daughter gazed at her brother king,      Her eye had an evil mote;    And then she played with his yellow hair,      And patted his infant throat;    And then she muster'd a bloody mind,      And whisper'd a favour'd slut,    While patting the infant monarch's throat,      It would not be much to cut.    The favour'd gipsey noted the hint,      And she thought it not amiss,    She hied to the infant's governor,      And gave him a loving kiss.    The kiss of woman's a wond'rous juice,      That poisoneth pious minds,    It worketh more than the wrath of hell,      And the eye of justice blinds.    So they cut the infant monarch's throat,      They buried him in the wood,    The Mistress Quendred liv'd as a queen,      And they thought the deed was good.    Now mark, how ill is a crime conceal'd,      Bad deeds will never accord,    The murder never beheld at home,      Was to light elsewhere restor'd,    They wash'd their hands in the monarch's blood,      And the world roll'd on the same,    Till swift to the holy shrine at Rome,      A fluttering dove there came.    A dove, a peaceful, timorous bird,      That carried a parchment scroll,    And in letters of gold, the crime it told,      That blasted a sister's soul.    That fluttering dove flew round the shrine,      Where the Pope by chance was led,    And he let the scribbled parchment fall      On his holiness' bald head.    Now the Pope was very sore perplex'd,      At the words the dove had scrawl'd,    For he could not read the pig-squeak tongue,      Which is now old English call'd.    He questioned the French ambassador,      The news of that scroll to speak.    Who bowing observed, \"it was not _French_,      He never had learn'd the _Greek_.\"    He ask'd a monk from _Byzantium_,      A monk as fat as a tench,    He merely remark'd \"it was not _Greek_,      He never had learn'd the _French_.\"    He question'd the grave Lord Cardinal,      He ordered the monks to pray'rs,    The monks ne'er knew what language it was,      When they saw it was not theirs.    But there chanced to be an Englishman,      At Rome, on a trading hope,    The tale of blood and the letters gold,      He read to the holy Pope.    'Twas how King Kenulph an infant son,      Bequeath'd to his daughter's care,    And how the daughter slaughtered the son,      It clearly mention'd where.    Then the Pope cried, \"Heaven's will be done,\"      And a loud Hosanna sung,    The incense fumed to the lofty dome.      Like ray-beam drapery hung.    And they canoniz'd the holy dove,      Like the soul of a martyr dead,    The deed is still in the calendar,      In capital letters red.    Now when to Britain the tidings came      Of her island's perish'd hope,    The monks took hatchets to _Winchcomb Wood_,      And they glorified the Pope.    And after many a night of toil,      They struck at the infant's bone,    Beneath a tree, where an awful owl      Was screeching a midnight groan.    They bore the bones by the moonlight ray,      To the convent's holy shrine,    And from the psaltry sang a psalm,      The psalm one hundred and nine.    The queen, she hearken'd the pious tones,      As they pass'd the palace by,    It seem'd the saints and the morning stars      Were chorussing in the sky.    But when she hearken'd the deed was known,      And her coming hour of strife,    And how they had found the royal bones      From which she had taken the life,    She got King David's psalter book,      And turn'd to the psalm they sung,    And began to read it contrariwise,      Though it blister'd on her tongue.    And she mock'd the monkish melody,      With a heart like boiling pitch,    And the clouds went shudd'ring as they heard      Like a broom beneath a witch.    When she had gotten to verse the twelfth,      'Twas the twelfth verse from the end,    Her breast upheav'd a horrible groan,      And she gave the psalm a rend.    The lofty turret quiver'd with fear,      The floor of the chapel shook,    Her eyeballs fell from her burning brow,      And blooded the psalter book.    And thrice she groan'd and thrice she sigh'd,      And thrice she bowed her head.    And a heavy fall and a light'ning flash      Was the knell of a sinner dead.    And forth from her eyeless sockets flew      A furious flame around,    And blood stream'd out of her spirting mouth,      Like water upon the ground.    The magpie chatter'd above the corpse,      The owl sang funeral lay,    The twisting worm pass'd over her face,      And it writhed and turn'd away.    The jackdaws caw'd at the body dead,      Expos'd on the churchyard stones,    They wagg'd their tails in scorn of her flesh,      And turn'd up their bills at her bones.    The convent mastiff trotting along,      Sniff'd hard at the mortal leaven,    Then bristled his hair at her brimstone smell,      And howl'd out his fears to heaven.    Then the jackdaw screech'd his joy,      That he spurn'd the royal feast,    And keen'd all night to the grievous owl,      And the howling mastiff beast.    Loud on that night was the thunder crash,      Sad was the voice of the wind,    Swift was the glare of the lightning flash,      And the whizz it left behind.    At morn when the pious brothers came      To give the body to ground,    The skull, the feet, and palms of her hands      Were all that they ever found.    Then the holy monks with ominous shake      Of the head, looked wond'rous sly,    While the breeze that waved their whiten'd locks,      Bore a pray'r for her soul on high.    P.S.           *       *       *       *       *          SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY.      VAN DIEMEN'S LAND.      [There is a touching interest in the following narrative of the surrender  of certain tribes of the aborigines of Van Diemen's Land to the British  authorities. Some time since a war of extermination was commenced against  them by the colonists; but, happily for humanity, this atrocious attack,  which future historians may varnish over with \"civilization,\" was a signal  failure; and the poor, simple creatures were still left to enjoy the woods  and caves and painted skins of savage life; not, however, without having  fiercely retaliated upon the colonists for the cruel treatment which they  experienced.]    The Oyster Bay and Big River tribes, the most sanguinary in the island,  have surrendered themselves to Mr. Robinson, by whose conciliatory  intervention the desirable event has been mainly brought about. On the 7th  of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1259"],[0,"Twenty Years After (#2)"],[1,"between seven and eight hundred tradesmen had  assembled in Paris to discuss a new tax which was to be levied on house  property. They deputed ten of their number to wait upon the Duke of  Orleans, who, according to his custom, affected popularity. The duke  received them and they informed him that they were resolved not to pay  this tax, even if they were obliged to defend themselves against its  collectors by force of arms. They were listened to with great politeness  by the duke, who held out hopes of easier measures, promised to speak in  their behalf to the queen, and dismissed them with the ordinary  expression of royalty, \"We will see what we can do.\"    Two days afterward these same magistrates appeared before the cardinal  and their spokesman addressed Mazarin with so much fearlessness and  determination that the minister was astounded and sent the deputation  away with the same answer as it had received from the Duke of  Orleans--that he would see what could be done; and in accordance with  that intention a council of state was assembled and the superintendent  of finance was summoned.    This man, named Emery, was the object of popular detestation, in the  first place because he was superintendent of finance, and every  superintendent of finance deserved to be hated; in the second place,  because he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred.    He was the son of a banker at Lyons named Particelli, who, after  becoming a bankrupt, chose to change his name to Emery; and Cardinal  Richelieu having discovered in him great financial aptitude, had  introduced him with a strong recommendation to Louis XIII. under his  assumed name, in order that he might be appointed to the post he  subsequently held.    \"You surprise me!\" exclaimed the monarch. \"I am rejoiced to hear you  speak of Monsieur d'Emery as calculated for a post which requires a man  of probity. I was really afraid that you were going to force that  villain Particelli upon me.\"    \"Sire,\" replied Richelieu, \"rest assured that Particelli, the man to  whom your majesty refers, has been hanged.\"    \"Ah; so much the better!\" exclaimed the king. \"It is not for nothing  that I am styled Louis the Just,\" and he signed Emery's appointment.    This was the same Emery who became eventually superintendent of finance.    He was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale and  trembling, declaring that his son had very nearly been assassinated the  day before, near the palace. The mob had insulted him on account of the  ostentatious luxury of his wife, whose house was hung with red velvet  edged with gold fringe. This lady was the daughter of Nicholas de Camus,  who arrived in Paris with twenty francs in his pocket, became secretary  of state, and accumulated wealth enough to divide nine millions of  francs among his children and to keep an income of forty thousand for  himself.    The fact was that Emery's son had run a great chance of being  suffocated, one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him until he  gave up all the gold he had swallowed. Nothing, therefore, was settled  that day, as Emery's head was not steady enough for business after such  an occurrence.    On the next day Mathieu Mole, the chief president, whose courage at this  crisis, says the Cardinal de Retz, was equal to that of the Duc de  Beaufort and the Prince de Conde--in other words, of the two men who  were considered the bravest in France--had been attacked in his turn.  The people threatened to hold him responsible for the evils that hung  over them. But the chief president had replied with his habitual  coolness, without betraying either disturbance or surprise, that should  the agitators refuse obedience to the king's wishes he would have  gallows erected in the public squares and proceed at once to hang the  most active among them. To which the others had responded that they  would be glad to see the gallows erected; they would serve for the  hanging of those detestable judges who purchased favor at court at the  price of the people's misery.    Nor was this all. On the eleventh the queen in going to mass at Notre  Dame, as she always did on Saturdays, was followed by more than two  hundred women demanding justice. These poor creatures had no bad  intentions. They wished only to be allowed to fall on their knees before  their sovereign, and that they might move her to compassion; but they  were prevented by the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way,  haughtily disdainful of their entreaties.    At length parliament was convoked; the authority of the king was to be  maintained.    One day--it was the morning of the day my story begins--the king, Louis  XIV., then ten years of age, went in state, under pretext of returning  thanks for his recovery from the small-pox, to Notre Dame. He took the  opportunity of calling out his guard, the Swiss troops and the  musketeers, and he had planted them round the Palais Royal, on the  quays, and on the Pont Neuf. After mass the young monarch drove to the  Parliament House, where, upon the throne, he hastily confirmed not only  such edicts as he had already passed, but issued new ones, each one,  according to Cardinal de Retz, more ruinous than the others--a  proceeding which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the chief  president, Mole--whilst President Blancmesnil and Councillor Broussel  raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes.    The king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude to the Palais  Royal. All minds were uneasy, most were foreboding, many of the people  used threatening language.    At first, indeed, they were doubtful whether the king's visit to the  parliament had been in order to lighten or increase their burdens; but  scarcely was it known that the taxes were to be still further increased,  when cries of \"Down with Mazarin!\" \"Long live Broussel!\" \"Long live  Blancmesnil!\" resounded through the city. For the people had learned  that Broussel and Blancmesnil had made speeches in their behalf, and,  although the eloquence of these deputies had been without avail, it had  none the less won for them the people's good-will. All attempts to  disperse the groups collected in the streets, or silence their  exclamations, were in vain. Orders had just been given to the royal  guards and the Swiss guards, not only to stand firm, but to send out  patrols to the streets of Saint Denis and Saint Martin, where the people  thronged and where they were the most vociferous, when the mayor of  Paris was announced at the Palais Royal.    He was shown in directly; he came to say that if these offensive  precautions were not discontinued, in two hours Paris would be under  arms.    Deliberations were being held when a lieutenant in the guards, named  Comminges, made his appearance, with his clothes all torn, his face  streaming with blood. The queen on seeing him uttered a cry of surprise  and asked him what was going on.    As the mayor had foreseen, the sight of the guards had exasperated the  mob. The tocsin was sounded. Comminges had arrested one of the  ringleaders and had ordered him to be hanged near the cross of Du  Trahoir; but in attempting to execute this command the soldiery were  attacked in the market-place with stones and halberds; the delinquent  had escaped to the Rue des Lombards and rushed into a house. They broke  open the doors and searched the dwelling, but in vain. Comminges,  wounded by a stone which had struck him on the forehead, had left a  picket in the street and returned to the Palais Royal, followed by a  menacing crowd, to tell his story.    This account confirmed that of the mayor. The authorities were not in a  condition to cope with serious revolt. Mazarin endeavored to circulate  among the people a report that troops had only been stationed on the  quays and on the Pont Neuf, on account of the ceremonial of the day, and  that they would soon withdraw. In fact, about four o'clock they were all  concentrated about the Palais Royal, the courts and ground floors of  which were filled with musketeers and Swiss guards, and there awaited  the outcome of all this disturbance.    Such was the state of affairs at the very moment we introduced our  readers to the study of Cardinal Mazarin--once that of Cardinal  Richelieu. We have seen in what state of mind he listened to the murmurs  from below, which even reached him in his seclusion, and to the guns,  the firing of which resounded through that room. All at once he raised  his head; his brow slightly contracted like that of a man who has formed  a resolution; he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that was about to  strike ten, and taking up a whistle of silver gilt that stood upon the  table near him, he shrilled it twice.    A door hidden in the tapestry opened noiselessly and a man in black  silently advanced and stood behind the chair on which Mazarin sat.    \"Bernouin,\" said the cardinal, not turning round, for having whistled,  he knew that it was his valet-de-chambre who was behind him; \"what  musketeers are now within the palace?\"    \"The Black Musketeers, my lord.\"    \"What company?\"    \"Treville's company.\"    \"Is there any officer belonging to this company in the ante-chamber?\"    \"Lieutenant d'Artagnan.\"    \"A man on whom we can depend, I hope.\"    \"Yes, my lord.\"    \"Give me a uniform of one of these musketeers and help me to put it on.\"    The valet went out as silently as he had entered and appeared in a few  minutes bringing the dress demanded.    The cardinal, in deep thought and in silence, began to take off the  robes of state he had assumed in order to be present at the sitting of  parliament, and to attire himself in the military coat, which he wore  with a certain degree of easy grace, owing to his former campaigns in  Italy. When he was completely dressed he said:    \"Send hither Monsieur d'Artagnan.\"    The valet went out of the room, this time by the centre door, but still  as"]]]
