All  that was not required for the business and the necessaries of life went  into the little coffer with steel bands and florid key. They denied  themselves in turn the humblest luxuries, and then, catching one  another's looks, smiled; perhaps with a greater joy than self-indulgence  has to bestow. And so in three years more they had gleaned enough to set  up their fourth son as a master-tailor, and their eldest daughter as a  robemaker, in Tergou. Here were two more provided for: their own trade  would enable them to throw work into the hands of this pair. But the  coffer was drained to the dregs, and this time the shop too bled a  little in goods if not in coin.    Alas! there remained on hand two that were unable to get their bread,  and two that were unwilling. The unable ones were, 1, Giles, a dwarf,  of the wrong sort, half stupidity, half malice, all head and claws and  voice, run from by dogs and unprejudiced females, and sided with through  thick and thin by his mother; 2, Little Catherine, a poor little girl  that could only move on crutches. She lived in pain, but smiled through  it, with her marble face and violet eyes and long silky lashes; and  fretful or repining word never came from her lips. The unwilling ones  were Sybrandt, the youngest, a ne'er-do-weel, too much in love with play  to work; and Cornelis, the eldest, who had made calculations, and stuck  to the hearth, waiting for dead men's shoes. Almost worn out by their  repeated efforts, and above all dispirited by the moral and physical  infirmities of those that now remained on hand, the anxious couple would  often say, \"What will become of all these when we shall be no longer  here to take care of them?\" But when they had said this a good many  times, suddenly the domestic horizon cleared, and then they used  still to say it, because a habit is a habit, but they uttered it half  mechanically now, and added brightly and cheerfully, \"But thanks to St.  Bavon and all the saints, there's Gerard.\"    Young Gerard was for many years of his life a son apart and he was going  into the Church, and the Church could always maintain her children by  hook or by crook in those days: no great hopes, because his family had  no interest with the great to get him a benefice, and the young man's  own habits were frivolous, and, indeed, such as our cloth merchant  would not have put up with in any one but a clerk that was to be. His  trivialities were reading and penmanship, and he was so wrapped up in  them that often he could hardly be got away to his meals. The day  was never long enough for him; and he carried ever a tinder-box and  brimstone matches, and begged ends of candles of the neighbours, which  he lighted at unreasonable hours--ay, even at eight of the clock at  night in winter, when the very burgomaster was abed. Endured at home,  his practices were encouraged by the monks of a neighbouring convent.  They had taught him penmanship, and continued to teach him until one day  they discovered, in the middle of a lesson, that he was teaching them.  They pointed this out to him in a merry way: he hung his head and  blushed: he had suspected as much himself, but mistrusted his judgment  in so delicate a matter. \"But, my son,\" said an elderly monk, \"how is  it that you, to whom God has given an eye so true, a hand so subtle yet  firm, and a heart to love these beautiful crafts, how is it you do not  colour as well as write? A scroll looks but barren unless a border of  fruit, and leaves, and rich arabesques surround the good words, and  charm the sense as those do the soul and understanding; to say nothing  of the pictures of holy men and women departed, with which the several  chapters should be adorned, and not alone the eye soothed with the brave  and sweetly blended colours, but the heart lifted by effigies of the  saints in glory. Answer me, my son.\"    At this Gerard was confused, and muttered that he had made several  trials at illuminating, but had not succeeded well; and thus the matter  rested.    Soon after this a fellow-enthusiast came on the scene in the unwonted  form of an old lady. Margaret, sister and survivor of the brothers Van  Eyck, left Flanders, and came to end her days in her native country. She  bought a small house near Tergou. In course of time she heard of Gerard,  and saw some of his handiwork: it pleased her so well that she sent her  female servant, Reicht Heynes, to ask him to come to her. This led to an  acquaintance: it could hardly be otherwise, for little Tergou had never  held so many as two zealots of this sort before. At first the old lady  damped Gerard's courage terribly. At each visit she fished out of holes  and corners drawings and paintings, some of them by her own hand, that  seemed to him unapproachable; but if the artist overpowered him, the  woman kept his heart up. She and Reicht soon turned him inside out like  a glove: among other things, they drew from him what the good monks had  failed to hit upon, the reason why he did not illuminate, viz., that  he could not afford the gold, the blue, and the red, but only the cheap  earths; and that he was afraid to ask his mother to buy the choice  colours, and was sure he should ask her in vain. Then Margaret Van Eyck  gave him a little brush--gold, and some vermilion and ultramarine, and  a piece of good vellum to lay them on. He almost adored her. As he left  the house Reicht ran after him with a candle and two quarters: he  quite kissed her. But better even than the gold and lapis-lazuli to the  illuminator was the sympathy to the isolated enthusiast. That sympathy  was always ready, and, as he returned it, an affection sprung up between  the old painter and the young caligrapher that was doubly characteristic  of the time. For this was a century in which the fine arts and the  higher mechanical arts were not separated by any distinct boundary, nor  were those who practised them; and it was an age in which artists sought  out and loved one another. Should this last statement stagger a painter  or writer of our day, let me remind him that even Christians loved one  another at first starting.    Backed by an acquaintance so venerable, and strengthened by female  sympathy, Gerard advanced in learning and skill. His spirits, too, rose  visibly: he still looked behind him when dragged to dinner in the  middle of an initial G; but once seated, showed great social qualities;  likewise a gay humour, that had hitherto but peeped in him, shone out,  and often he set the table in a roar, and kept it there, sometimes with  his own wit, sometimes with jests which were glossy new to his family,  being drawn from antiquity.    As a return for all he owed his friends the monks, he made them  exquisite copies from two of their choicest MSS., viz., the life of  their founder, and their Comedies of Terence, the monastery finding the  vellum.    The high and puissant Prince, Philip \"the Good,\" Duke of Burgundy,  Luxemburg, and Brabant, Earl of Holland and Zealand, Lord of Friesland,  Count of Flanders, Artois, and Hainault, Lord of Salins and Macklyn--was  versatile.    He could fight as well as any king going; and lie could lie as well as  any, except the King of France. He was a mighty hunter, and could read  and write. His tastes were wide and ardent. He loved jewels like a  woman, and gorgeous apparel. He dearly loved maids of honour, and indeed  paintings generally; in proof of which he ennobled Jan Van Eyck. He had  also a rage for giants, dwarfs, and Turks. These last stood ever planted  about him, turbaned and blazing with jewels. His agents inveigled them  from Istamboul with fair promises; but the moment he had got them, he  baptized them by brute force in a large tub; and this done, let them  squat with their faces towards Mecca, and invoke Mahound as much as they  pleased, laughing in his sleeve at their simplicity in fancying they  were still infidels. He had lions in cages, and fleet leopards trained  by Orientals to run down hares and deer. In short, he relished all  rarities, except the humdrum virtues. For anything singularly pretty or  diabolically ugly, this was your customer. The best of him was, he was  openhanded to the poor; and the next best was, he fostered the arts in  earnest: whereof he now gave a signal proof. He offered prizes for the  best specimens of orfevrerie in two kinds, religious and secular: item,  for the best paintings in white of egg, oils, and tempera; these to  be on panel, silk, or metal, as the artists chose: item, for the best  transparent painting on glass: item, for the best illuminating and  border-painting on vellum: item, for the fairest writing on vellum. The  burgomasters of the several towns were commanded to aid all the poorer  competitors by receiving their specimens and sending them with due care  to Rotterdam at the expense of their several burghs. When this was cried  by the bellman through the streets of Tergou, a thousand mouths opened,  and one heart beat--Gerard's. He told his family timidly he should try  for two of those prizes. They stared in silence, for their breath was  gone at his audacity; but one horrid laugh exploded on the floor like  a petard. Gerard looked down, and there was the dwarf, slit and fanged  from ear to ear at his expense, and laughing like a lion. Nature,  relenting at having made Giles so small, had given him as a set-off the  biggest voice on record. His very whisper was a bassoon. He was like  those stunted wide-mouthed pieces of ordnance we see on fortifications;  more like a flower-pot than a cannon; but ods tympana how they bellow!    Gerard turned red with anger, the more so as the others began to titter.  White Catherine saw, and a pink tinge came on her cheek. She said  softly, \"Why do you laugh? Is it because he is our brother you think  he cannot be capable? Yes, Gerard, try with the rest.

As we passed through the Strait of Ormuz memories of the early days of  European supremacy in the East crowded back, for I had read many a  vellum-covered volume in Portuguese about the early struggles for  supremacy in the gulf. One in particular interested me. The Portuguese  were hemmed in at Ormuz by a greatly superior English force. The expected  reinforcements never arrived, and at length their resources sank so low,  and they suffered in addition, or in consequence, so greatly from disease  that they decided to sail forth and give battle. This they did, but before  they joined in fight the ships of the two admirals sailed up near each  other--the Portuguese commander sent the British a gorgeous scarlet  ceremonial cloak, the British responded by sending him a handsomely  embossed sword. The British admiral donned the cloak, the Portuguese  grasped the sword; a page brought each a cup of wine; they pledged each  other, threw the goblets into the sea, and fell to. The British were  victorious. Times indeed have sadly changed in the last three hundred  years!    I was much struck with the accuracy of the geographical descriptions in  Camoens' letters and odes. He is the greatest of the Portuguese poets and  wrote the larger part of his master-epic, \"The Lusiad,\" while exiled in  India. For seventeen years he led an adventurous life in the East; and it  is easy to recognize many harbors and stretches of coast line from his  inimitable portrayal.    Busra, our destination, lies about sixty miles from the mouth of the Shatt  el Arab, which is the name given to the combined Tigris and Euphrates  after their junction at Kurna, another fifty or sixty miles above. At the  entrance to the river lies a sand-bar, effectively blocking access to  boats of as great draft as the _Saxon_. We therefore transshipped to some  British India vessels, and exceedingly comfortable we found them, designed  as they were for tropic runs. We steamed up past the Island of Abadan,  where stand the refineries of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. It is hard to  overestimate the important part that company has played in the conduct of  the Mesopotamian campaign. Motor transport was nowhere else a greater  necessity. There was no possibility of living on the country; at first,  at all events. General Dickson, the director of local resources, later set  in to so build up and encourage agriculture that the army should  eventually be supported, in the staples of life, by local produce.  Transportation was ever a hard nut to crack. Railroads were built, but  though the nature of the country called for little grading, obtaining  rails, except in small quantities, was impossible. The ones brought were  chiefly secured by taking up the double track of Indian railways. This  process naturally had a limit, and only lines of prime importance could be  laid down. Thus you could go by rail from Busra to Amara, and from Kut to  Baghdad, but the stretch between Amara and Kut had never been built, up to  the time I left the country. General Maude once told me that pressure was  being continually brought by the high command in England or India to have  that connecting-link built, but that he was convinced that the rails would  be far more essential elsewhere, and had no intention of yielding.    I don't know the total number of motor vehicles, but there were more than  five thousand Fords alone. On several occasions small columns of infantry  were transported in Fords, five men and the driver to a car. Indians of  every caste and religion were turned into drivers, and although it seemed  sufficiently out of place to come across wizened, khaki-clad Indo-Chinese  driving lorries in France, the incongruity was even more marked when one  beheld a great bearded Sikh with his turbaned head bent over the  steering-wheel of a Ford.    Modern Busra stands on the banks of Ashar Creek. The ancient city whence  Sinbad the sailor set forth is now seven or eight miles inland, buried  under the shifting sands of the desert. Busra was a seaport not so many  hundreds of years ago. Before that again, Kurna was a seaport, and the two  rivers probably only joined in the ocean, but they have gradually enlarged  the continent and forced back the sea. The present rate of encroachment  amounts, I was told, to nearly twelve feet a year.    The modern town has increased many fold with the advent of the  Expeditionary Force, and much of the improvement is of a necessarily  permanent nature; in particular the wharfs and roads. Indeed, one of the  most striking features of the Mesopotamian campaign is the permanency of  the improvements made by the British. In order to conquer the country it  was necessary to develop it,--build railways and bridges and roads and  telegraph systems,--and it has all been done in a substantial manner. It  is impossible to contemplate with equanimity the possibility of the  country reverting to a rule where all this progress would soon disappear  and the former stagnancy and injustice again hold sway.    [Illustration: Ashar Creek at Busra]    As soon as we landed I wandered off to the bazaar--\"suq\" is what the Arab  calls it. In Busra there are a number of excellent ones. By that I don't  mean that there are art treasures of the East to be found in them, for  almost everything could be duplicated at a better price in New York. It is  the grouping of wares, the mode of sale, and, above all, the salesmen and  buyers that make a bazaar--the old bearded Persian sitting cross-legged in  his booth, the motley crowd jostling through the narrow, vaulted  passageway, the veiled women, the hawk-featured, turbaned men, the Jews,  the Chaldeans, the Arabs, the Armenians, the stalwart Kurds, and through  it all a leaven of khaki-clad Indians, purchasing for the regimental mess.  All these and an ever-present exotic, intangible something are what the  bazaar means. Close by the entrance stood a booth festooned with lamps and  lanterns of every sort, with above it scrawled \"Aladdin-Ibn-Said.\" My  Arabic was not at that time sufficient to enable me to discover from the  owner whether he claimed illustrious ancestry or had merely been named  after a patron saint.    A few days after landing at Busra we embarked on a paddle-wheel boat to  pursue our way up-stream the five hundred intervening miles to Baghdad.  Along the banks of the river stretched endless miles of date-palms. We  watched the Arabs at their work of fertilizing them, for in this country  these palms have to depend on human agency to transfer the pollen. At  Kurna we entered the Garden of Eden, and one could quite appreciate the  feelings of the disgusted Tommy who exclaimed: \"If this is the Garden, it  wouldn't take no bloody angel with a flaming sword to turn me back.\" The  direct descendant of the Tree is pointed out; whether its properties are  inherited I never heard, but certainly the native would have little to  learn by eating the fruit.    Above Kurna the river is no longer lined with continuous palm-groves;  desert and swamps take their place--the abode of the amphibious, nomadic,  marsh Arab. An unruly customer he is apt to prove himself, and when he is  \"wanted\" by the officials, he retires to his watery fastnesses, where he  can remain in complete safety unless betrayed by his comrades. On the  banks of the Tigris stands Ezra's tomb. It is kept in good repair through  every vicissitude of rule, for it is a holy place to Moslem and Jew and  Christian alike.    The third night brought us to Amara. The evening was cool and pleasant  after the scorching heat of the day, and Finch Hatton and I thought that  we would go ashore for a stroll through the town. As we proceeded down the  bank toward the bridge, I caught sight of a sentry walking his post. His  appearance was so very important and efficient that I slipped behind my  companion to give him a chance to explain us. \"Halt! Who goes there?\"  \"Friend,\" replied Finch Hatton. \"Advance, friend, and give the  countersign.\" F.H. started to advance, followed by a still suspicious me,  and rightly so, for the Tommy, evidently member of a recent draft, came  forward to meet us with lowered bayonet, remarking in a businesslike  manner: \"There isn't any countersign.\"    Except for the gunboats and monitors, all river traffic is controlled by  the Inland Water Transport Service. The officers are recruited from all  the world over. I firmly believe that no river of any importance could be  mentioned but what an officer of the I.W.T. could be found who had  navigated it. The great requisite for transports on the Tigris was a very  light draft, and to fill the requirements boats were requisitioned ranging  from penny steamers of the Thames to river-craft of the Irrawaddy. Now in  bringing a penny steamer from London to Busra the submarine is one of the  lesser perils, and in supplying the wants of the Expeditionary Force more  than eighty vessels were lost at sea, frequently with all aboard.    As was the custom, we had a barge lashed to either side. These barges are  laden with troops, or horses, or supplies. In our case we had the first  Bengal regiment--a new experiment, undertaken for political reasons. The  Bengali is the Indian who most readily takes to European learning.  Rabindranath Tagore is probably the most widely known member of the race.  They go to Calcutta University and learn a smattering of English and  absorb a certain amount of undigested general knowledge and theory. These  partially educated Bengalis form the Babu class, and many are employed in  the railways. They delight in complicated phraseology, and this coupled  with their accent and seesaw manner of speaking supply the English a  constant source of caricature. As a race they are inclined to be vain and  boastful, and are ever ready to nurse a grievance against the British  Government, feeling that they have been provided"]]]
