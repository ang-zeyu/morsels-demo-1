To have done so wouldn't have altered matters, and it might  have depressed Oleron. He had chosen his path, and was committed to it  beyond possibility of withdrawal. Perhaps he had chosen it in the days  when he had been easily swayed by something a little disinterested, a  little generous, a little noble; and had he ever thought of questioning  himself he would still have held to it that a life without nobility and  generosity and disinterestedness was no life for him. Only quite  recently, and rarely, had he even vaguely suspected that there was more  in it than this; but it was no good anticipating the day when, he  supposed, he would reach that maximum point of his powers beyond which he  must inevitably decline, and be left face to face with the question  whether it would not have profited him better to have ruled his life  by less exigent ideals.    In the meantime, his removal into the old house with the insurance marks  built into its brick merely interrupted _Romilly Bishop_ at the fifteenth  chapter.    As this tall man with the lean, ascetic face moved about his new abode,  arranging, changing, altering, hardly yet into his working-stride again,  he gave the impression of almost spinster-like precision and nicety. For  twenty years past, in a score of lodgings, garrets, flats, and rooms  furnished and unfurnished, he had been accustomed to do many things for  himself, and he had discovered that it saves time and temper to be  methodical. He had arranged with the wife of the long-nosed Barrett, a  stout Welsh woman with a falsetto voice, the Merionethshire accent of  which long residence in London had not perceptibly modified, to come  across the square each morning to prepare his breakfast, and also to  \"turn the place out\" on Saturday mornings; and for the rest, he even  welcomed a little housework as a relaxation from the strain of writing.    His kitchen, together with the adjoining strip of an apartment into  which a modern bath had been fitted, overlooked the alley at the side of  the house; and at one end of it was a large closet with a door, and a  square sliding hatch in the upper part of the door. This had been a  powder-closet, and through the hatch the elaborately dressed head had  been thrust to receive the click and puff of the powder-pistol. Oleron  puzzled a little over this closet; then, as its use occurred to him, he  smiled faintly, a little moved, he knew not by what.... He would have to  put it to a very different purpose from its original one; it would  probably have to serve as his larder.... It was in this closet that  he made a discovery. The back of it was shelved, and, rummaging on an  upper shelf that ran deeply into the wall, Oleron found a couple of  mushroom-shaped old wooden wig-stands. He did not know how they had come  to be there. Doubtless the painters had turned them up somewhere or  other, and had put them there. But his five rooms, as a whole, were  short of cupboard and closet-room; and it was only by the exercise of  some ingenuity that he was able to find places for the bestowal of his  household linen, his boxes, and his seldom-used but not-to-be-destroyed  accumulations of papers.    It was in early spring that Oleron entered on his tenancy, and he was  anxious to have _Romilly_ ready for publication in the coming autumn.  Nevertheless, he did not intend to force its production. Should it demand  longer in the doing, so much the worse; he realised its importance, its  crucial importance, in his artistic development, and it must have its own  length and time. In the workroom he had recently left he had been making  excellent progress; _Romilly_ had begun, as the saying is, to speak and  act of herself; and he did not doubt she would continue to do so the  moment the distraction of his removal was over. This distraction was  almost over; he told himself it was time he pulled himself together  again; and on a March morning he went out, returned again with two great  bunches of yellow daffodils, placed one bunch on his mantelpiece between  the Sheffield sticks and the other on the table before him, and took out  the half-completed manuscript of _Romilly Bishop_.    But before beginning work he went to a small rosewood cabinet and took  from a drawer his cheque-book and pass-book. He totted them up, and his  monk-like face grew thoughtful. His installation had cost him more than  he had intended it should, and his balance was rather less than fifty  pounds, with no immediate prospect of more.    \"Hm! I'd forgotten rugs and chintz curtains and so forth mounted up so,\"  said Oleron. \"But it would have been a pity to spoil the place for the  want of ten pounds or so.... Well, _Romilly_ simply _must_ be out for the  autumn, that's all. So here goes--\"    He drew his papers towards him.    But he worked badly; or, rather, he did not work at all. The square  outside had its own noises, frequent and new, and Oleron could only hope  that he would speedily become accustomed to these. First came hawkers,  with their carts and cries; at midday the children, returning from  school, trooped into the square and swung on Oleron's gate; and when the  children had departed again for afternoon school, an itinerant musician  with a mandolin posted himself beneath Oleron's window and began to  strum. This was a not unpleasant distraction, and Oleron, pushing up his  window, threw the man a penny. Then he returned to his table again....    But it was no good. He came to himself, at long intervals, to find that  he had been looking about his room and wondering how it had formerly  been furnished--whether a settee in buttercup or petunia satin had stood  under the farther window, whether from the centre moulding of the light  lofty ceiling had depended a glimmering crystal chandelier, or where the  tambour-frame or the picquet-table had stood.... No, it was no good; he  had far better be frankly doing nothing than getting fruitlessly tired;  and he decided that he would take a walk, but, chancing to sit down for a  moment, dozed in his chair instead.    \"This won't do,\" he yawned when he awoke at half-past four in the  afternoon; \"I must do better than this to-morrow--\"    And he felt so deliciously lazy that for some minutes he even  contemplated the breach of an appointment he had for the evening.    The next morning he sat down to work without even permitting himself to  answer one of his three letters--two of them tradesmen's accounts, the  third a note from Miss Bengough, forwarded from his old address. It was a  jolly day of white and blue, with a gay noisy wind and a subtle turn in  the colour of growing things; and over and over again, once or twice a  minute, his room became suddenly light and then subdued again, as the  shining white clouds rolled north-eastwards over the square. The soft  fitful illumination was reflected in the polished surface of the table  and even in the footworn old floor; and the morning noises had begun  again.    Oleron made a pattern of dots on the paper before him, and then broke off  to move the jar of daffodils exactly opposite the centre of a creamy  panel. Then he wrote a sentence that ran continuously for a couple of  lines, after which it broke on into notes and jottings. For a time he  succeeded in persuading himself that in making these memoranda he was  really working; then he rose and began to pace his room. As he did so, he  was struck by an idea. It was that the place might possibly be a little  better for more positive colour. It was, perhaps, a thought _too_  pale--mild and sweet as a kind old face, but a little devitalised, even  wan.... Yes, decidedly it would bear a robuster note--more and richer  flowers, and possibly some warm and gay stuff for cushions for the  window-seats....    \"Of course, I really can't afford it,\" he muttered, as he went for a  two-foot and began to measure the width of the window recesses....    In stooping to measure a recess, his attitude suddenly changed to one of  interest and attention. Presently he rose again, rubbing his hands with  gentle glee.    \"Oho, oho!\" he said. \"These look to me very much like window-boxes,  nailed up. We must look into this! Yes, those are boxes, or  I'm ... oho, this is an adventure!\"    On that wall of his sitting-room there were two windows (the third was in  another corner), and, beyond the open bedroom door, on the same wall, was  another. The seats of all had been painted, repainted, and painted again;  and Oleron's investigating finger had barely detected the old nailheads  beneath the paint. Under the ledge over which he stooped an old keyhole  also had been puttied up. Oleron took out his penknife.    He worked carefully for five minutes, and then went into the kitchen for  a hammer and chisel. Driving the chisel cautiously under the seat, he  started the whole lid slightly. Again using the penknife, he cut along  the hinged edge and outward along the ends; and then he fetched a  wedge and a wooden mallet.    \"Now for our little mystery--\" he said.    The sound of the mallet on the wedge seemed, in that sweet and pale  apartment, somehow a little brutal--nay, even shocking. The panelling  rang and rattled and vibrated to the blows like a sounding-board. The  whole house seemed to echo; from the roomy cellarage to the garrets  above a flock of echoes seemed to awake; and the sound got a little on  Oleron's nerves. All at once he paused, fetched a duster, and muffled the  mallet.... When the edge was sufficiently raised he put his fingers under  it and lifted. The paint flaked and starred a little; the rusty old  nails squeaked and grunted; and the lid came up, laying open the box  beneath. Oleron looked into it. Save for a couple of inches of scurf and  mould and old cobwebs it was empty.    \"No treasure there,\" said Oleron, a little amused that he should have  fancied there"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14209"],[0,"The Kybalion (#2)"],[1,"Masters of that ancient land.    But among these great Masters of Ancient Egypt there once dwelt one of  whom Masters hailed as \"The Master of Masters.\" This man, if \"man\"  indeed he was, dwelt in Egypt in the earliest days. He was known as  Hermes Trismegistus. He was the father of the Occult Wisdom; the founder  of Astrology; the discoverer of Alchemy. The details of his life story  are lost to history, owing to the lapse of the years, though several of  the ancient countries disputed with each other in their claims to the  honor of having furnished his birthplace--and this thousands of years  ago. The date of his sojourn in Egypt, in that his last incarnation on  this planet, is not now known, but it has been fixed at the early days  of the oldest dynasties of Egypt--long before the days of Moses. The  best authorities regard him as a contemporary of Abraham, and some of  the Jewish traditions go so far as to claim that Abraham acquired a  portion of his mystic knowledge from Hermes himself.    As the years rolled by after his passing from this plane of life  (tradition recording that he lived three hundred years in the flesh),  the Egyptians deified Hermes, and made him one of their gods, under the  name of Thoth. Years after, the people of Ancient Greece also made him  one of their many gods--calling him \"Hermes, the god of Wisdom.\" The  Egyptians revered his memory for many centuries-yes, tens of centuries--  calling him \"the Scribe of the Gods,\" and bestowing upon him,  distinctively, his ancient title, \"Trismegistus,\" which means \"the  thrice-great\"; \"the great-great\"; \"the greatest-great\"; etc. In all the  ancient lands, the name of Hermes Trismegistus was revered, the name  being synonymous with the \"Fount of Wisdom.\"    Even to this day, we use the term \"hermetic\" in the sense of \"secret\";  \"sealed so that nothing can escape\"; etc., and this by reason of the  fact that the followers of Hermes always observed the principle of  secrecy in their teachings. They did not believe in \"casting pearls  before swine,\" but rather held to the teaching \"milk for babes\"; \"meat  for strong men,\" both of which maxims are familiar to readers of the  Christian scriptures, but both of which had been used by the Egyptians  for centuries before the Christian era.    And this policy of careful dissemination of the truth has always  characterized the Hermetics, even unto the present day. The Hermetic  Teachings are to be found in all lands, among all religions, but never  identified with any particular country, nor with any particular  religious sect. This because of the warning of the ancient teachers  against allowing the Secret Doctrine to become crystallized into a  creed. The wisdom of this caution is apparent to all students of  history. The ancient occultism of India and Persia degenerated, and was  largely lost, owing to the fact that the teachers became priests, and so  mixed theology with the philosophy, the result being that the occultism  of India and Persia has been gradually lost amidst the mass of religious  superstition, cults, creeds and \"gods.\" So it was with Ancient Greece  and Rome. So it was with the Hermetic Teachings of the Gnostics and  Early Christians, which were lost at the time of Constantine, whose iron  hand smothered philosophy with the blanket of theology, losing to the  Christian Church that which was its very essence and spirit, and causing  it to grope throughout several centuries before it found the way back to  its ancient faith, the indications apparent to all careful observers in  this Twentieth Century being that the Church is now struggling to get  back to its ancient mystic teachings.    But there were always a few faithful souls who kept alive the Flame,  tending it carefully, and not allowing its light to become extinguished.  And thanks to these staunch hearts, and fearless minds, we have the  truth still with us.  But it is not found in books, to any great extent.  It has been passed along from Master to Student; from Initiate to  Hierophant; from lip to ear. When it was written down at all, its  meaning was veiled in terms of alchemy and astrology so that only those  possessing the key could read it aright. This was made necessary in  order to avoid the persecutions of the theologians of the Middle Ages,  who fought the Secret Doctrine with fire and sword; stake, gibbet and  cross. Even to this day there will be found but few reliable books on  the Hermetic Philosophy, although there are countless references to it  in many books written on various phases of Occultism. And yet, the  Hermetic Philosophy is the only Master Key which will open all the doors  of the Occult Teachings!    In the early days, there was a compilation of certain Basic Hermetic  Doctrines, passed on from teacher to student, which was known as \"THE  KYBALION,\" the exact significance and meaning of the term having been  lost for several centuries. This teaching, however, is known to many to  whom it has descended, from mouth to ear, on and on throughout the  centuries. Its precepts have never been written down, or printed, so far  as we know. It was merely a collection of maxims, axioms, and precepts,  which were non-understandable to outsiders, but which were readily  understood by students, after the axioms, maxims, and precepts had been  explained and exemplified by the Hermetic Initiates to their Neophytes.  These teachings really constituted the basic principles of \"The Art of  Hermetic Alchemy,\" which, contrary to the general belief, dealt in the  mastery of Mental Forces, rather than Material Elements-the  Transmutation of one kind of Mental Vibrations into others, instead of  the changing of one kind of metal into another. The legends of the  \"Philosopher's Stone\" which would turn base metal into Gold, was an  allegory relating to Hermetic Philosophy, readily understood by all  students of true Hermeticism.    In this little book, of which this is the First Lesson, we invite our  students to examine into the Hermetic Teachings, as set forth in THE  KYBALION, and as explained by ourselves, humble students of the  Teachings, who, while bearing the title of Initiates, are still students  at the feet of HERMES, the Master. We herein give you many of the  maxims, axioms and precepts of THE KYBALION, accompanied by explanations  and illustrations which we deem likely to render the teachings more  easily comprehended by the modern student, particularly as the original  text is purposely veiled in obscure terms.    The original maxims, axioms, and precepts of THE KYBALION are printed  herein, in italics, the proper credit being given. Our own work is  printed in the regular way, in the body of the work. We trust that the  many students to whom we now offer this little work will derive as much  benefit from the study of its pages as have the many who have gone on  before, treading the same Path to Mastery throughout the centuries that  have passed since the times of HERMES TRISMEGISTUS--the Master of  Masters--the Great-Great. In the words of \"THE KYBALION\":        \"Where fall the footsteps of the Master, the ears of those      ready for his Teaching open wide.\"--The Kybalion.        \"When the ears of the student are ready to hear, then cometh      the lips to fill them with Wisdom.\"--The Kybalion.    So that according to the Teachings, the passage of this book to those  ready for the instruction will attract the attention of such as are  prepared to receive the Teaching. And, likewise, when the pupil is ready  to receive the truth, then will this little book come to him, or her.  Such is The Law. The Hermetic Principle of Cause and Effect, in its  aspect of The Law of Attraction, will bring lips and ear together--pupil  and book in company. So mote it be!        CHAPTER II    THE SEVEN HERMETIC PRINCIPLES        \"The Principles of Truth are Seven; he who knows these,      understandingly, possesses the Magic Key before whose      touch all the Doors of the Temple fly open.\"--The Kybalion.    The Seven Hermetic Principles, upon which the entire Hermetic Philosophy  is based, are as follows:        1. The Principle of Mentalism.      2. The Principle of Correspondence.      3. The Principle of Vibration.      4. The Principle of Polarity.      5. The Principle of Rhythm.      6. The Principle of Cause and Effect.      7. The Principle of Gender.    These Seven Principles will be discussed and explained as we proceed  with these lessons. A short explanation of each, however, may as well be  given at this point.    1.  The Principle of Mentalism        \"THE ALL IS MIND; The Universe is Mental.\"--The Kybalion.    This Principle embodies the truth that \"All is Mind.\" It explains that  THE ALL (which is the Substantial Reality underlying all the outward  manifestations and appearances which we know under the terms of \"The  Material Universe\"; the \"Phenomena of Life\"; \"Matter\"; \"Energy\"; and, in  short, all that is apparent to our material senses) is SPIRIT which in  itself is UNKNOWABLE and UNDEFINABLE, but which may be considered and  thought of as AN UNIVERSAL, INFINITE, LIVING MIND. It also explains that  all the phenomenal world or universe is simply a Mental Creation of THE  ALL, subject to the Laws of Created Things, and that the universe, as a  whole, and in its parts or units, has its existence in the Mind of THE  ALL, in which Mind we \"live and move and have our being.\" This  Principle, by establishing the Mental Nature of the Universe, easily  explains all of the varied mental and psychic phenomena that occupy such  a large portion of the public attention, and which, without such  explanation, are non-understandable and defy scientific treatment. An  understanding of this great Hermetic Principle of Mentalism enables the  individual to readily grasp the laws of the Mental Universe, and to  apply the same to his well-being and advancement. The Hermetic Student  is enabled to apply intelligently "]]]
