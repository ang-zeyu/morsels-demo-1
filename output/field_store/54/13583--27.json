[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1268"],[0,"The Mysterious Island (#2)"],[1,"the balloon was only 500 feet above the surface of the  water.    A loud barking was heard. A dog accompanied the voyagers, and was held  pressed close to his master in the meshes of the net.    \"Top has seen something,\" cried one of the men. Then immediately a loud  voice shouted,--    \"Land! land!\" The balloon, which the wind still drove towards the  southwest, had since daybreak gone a considerable distance, which might  be reckoned by hundreds of miles, and a tolerably high land had, in  fact, appeared in that direction. But this land was still thirty miles  off. It would not take less than an hour to get to it, and then there  was the chance of falling to leeward.    An hour! Might not the balloon before that be emptied of all the fluid  it yet retained?    Such was the terrible question! The voyagers could distinctly see that  solid spot which they must reach at any cost. They were ignorant of what  it was, whether an island or a continent, for they did not know to what  part of the world the hurricane had driven them. But they must reach  this land, whether inhabited or desolate, whether hospitable or not.    It was evident that the balloon could no longer support itself! Several  times already had the crests of the enormous billows licked the bottom  of the net, making it still heavier, and the balloon only half rose,  like a bird with a wounded wing. Half an hour later the land was not  more than a mile off, but the balloon, exhausted, flabby, hanging in  great folds, had gas in its upper part alone. The voyagers, clinging to  the net, were still too heavy for it, and soon, half plunged into the  sea, they were beaten by the furious waves. The balloon-case bulged out  again, and the wind, taking it, drove it along like a vessel. Might it  not possibly thus reach the land?    But, when only two fathoms off, terrible cries resounded from four pairs  of lungs at once. The balloon, which had appeared as if it would never  again rise, suddenly made an unexpected bound, after having been struck  by a tremendous sea. As if it had been at that instant relieved of a new  part of its weight, it mounted to a height of 1,500 feet, and here it  met a current of wind, which instead of taking it directly to the coast,  carried it in a nearly parallel direction.    At last, two minutes later, it reproached obliquely, and finally fell on  a sandy beach, out of the reach of the waves.    The voyagers, aiding each other, managed to disengage themselves from  the meshes of the net. The balloon, relieved of their weight, was taken  by the wind, and like a wounded bird which revives for an instant,  disappeared into space.    But the car had contained five passengers, with a dog, and the balloon  only left four on the shore.    The missing person had evidently been swept off by the sea, which had  just struck the net, and it was owing to this circumstance that the  lightened balloon rose the last time, and then soon after reached the  land. Scarcely had the four castaways set foot on firm ground, than they  all, thinking of the absent one, simultaneously exclaimed, \"Perhaps he  will try to swim to land! Let us save him! let us save him!\"        Chapter 2    Those whom the hurricane had just thrown on this coast were neither  aeronauts by profession nor amateurs. They were prisoners of war whose  boldness had induced them to escape in this extraordinary manner.    A hundred times they had almost perished! A hundred times had they  almost fallen from their torn balloon into the depths of the ocean. But  Heaven had reserved them for a strange destiny, and after having, on the  20th of March, escaped from Richmond, besieged by the troops of General  Ulysses Grant, they found themselves seven thousand miles from the  capital of Virginia, which was the principal stronghold of the South,  during the terrible War of Secession. Their aerial voyage had lasted  five days.    The curious circumstances which led to the escape of the prisoners were  as follows:    That same year, in the month of February, 1865, in one of the coups  de main by which General Grant attempted, though in vain, to possess  himself of Richmond, several of his officers fell into the power of the  enemy and were detained in the town. One of the most distinguished was  Captain Cyrus Harding. He was a native of Massachusetts, a first-class  engineer, to whom the government had confided, during the war, the  direction of the railways, which were so important at that time. A  true Northerner, thin, bony, lean, about forty-five years of age; his  close-cut hair and his beard, of which he only kept a thick mustache,  were already getting gray. He had one-of those finely-developed heads  which appear made to be struck on a medal, piercing eyes, a serious  mouth, the physiognomy of a clever man of the military school. He was  one of those engineers who began by handling the hammer and pickaxe,  like generals who first act as common soldiers. Besides mental power, he  also possessed great manual dexterity. His muscles exhibited remarkable  proofs of tenacity. A man of action as well as a man of thought, all he  did was without effort to one of his vigorous and sanguine temperament.  Learned, clear-headed, and practical, he fulfilled in all  emergencies those three conditions which united ought to insure human  success--activity of mind and body, impetuous wishes, and powerful will.  He might have taken for his motto that of William of Orange in the 17th  century: \"I can undertake and persevere even without hope of success.\"  Cyrus Harding was courage personified. He had been in all the battles of  that war. After having begun as a volunteer at Illinois, under Ulysses  Grant, he fought at Paducah, Belmont, Pittsburg Landing, at the siege of  Corinth, Port Gibson, Black River, Chattanooga, the Wilderness, on the  Potomac, everywhere and valiantly, a soldier worthy of the general who  said, \"I never count my dead!\" And hundreds of times Captain Harding had  almost been among those who were not counted by the terrible Grant; but  in these combats where he never spared himself, fortune favored him till  the moment when he was wounded and taken prisoner on the field of battle  near Richmond. At the same time and on the same day another important  personage fell into the hands of the Southerners. This was no other than  Gideon Spilett, a reporter for the New York Herald, who had been ordered  to follow the changes of the war in the midst of the Northern armies.    Gideon Spilett was one of that race of indomitable English or American  chroniclers, like Stanley and others, who stop at nothing to obtain  exact information, and transmit it to their journal in the shortest  possible time. The newspapers of the Union, such as the New York Herald,  are genuine powers, and their reporters are men to be reckoned with.  Gideon Spilett ranked among the first of those reporters: a man of great  merit, energetic, prompt and ready for anything, full of ideas, having  traveled over the whole world, soldier and artist, enthusiastic in  council, resolute in action, caring neither for trouble, fatigue, nor  danger, when in pursuit of information, for himself first, and then for  his journal, a perfect treasury of knowledge on all sorts of curious  subjects, of the unpublished, of the unknown, and of the impossible. He  was one of those intrepid observers who write under fire, \"reporting\"  among bullets, and to whom every danger is welcome.    He also had been in all the battles, in the first rank, revolver in one  hand, note-book in the other; grape-shot never made his pencil tremble.  He did not fatigue the wires with incessant telegrams, like those who  speak when they have nothing to say, but each of his notes, short,  decisive, and clear, threw light on some important point. Besides, he  was not wanting in humor. It was he who, after the affair of the Black  River, determined at any cost to keep his place at the wicket of the  telegraph office, and after having announced to his journal the result  of the battle, telegraphed for two hours the first chapters of the  Bible. It cost the New York Herald two thousand dollars, but the New  York Herald published the first intelligence.    Gideon Spilett was tall. He was rather more than forty years of age.  Light whiskers bordering on red surrounded his face. His eye was steady,  lively, rapid in its changes. It was the eye of a man accustomed to take  in at a glance all the details of a scene. Well built, he was inured to  all climates, like a bar of steel hardened in cold water.    For ten years Gideon Spilett had been the reporter of the New York  Herald, which he enriched by his letters and drawings, for he was as  skilful in the use of the pencil as of the pen. When he was captured,  he was in the act of making a description and sketch of the battle. The  last words in his note-book were these: \"A Southern rifleman has just  taken aim at me, but--\" The Southerner notwithstanding missed Gideon  Spilett, who, with his usual fortune, came out of this affair without a  scratch.    Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett, who did not know each other except  by reputation, had both been carried to Richmond. The engineer's  wounds rapidly healed, and it was during his convalescence that he made  acquaintance with the reporter. The two men then learned to appreciate  each other. Soon their common aim had but one object, that of escaping,  rejoining Grant's army, and fighting together in the ranks of the  Federals.    The two Americans had from the first determined to seize every chance;  but although they were allowed to wander at liberty in the town,  Richmond was so strictly guarded, that escape appeared impossible. In  the meanwhile Captain Harding was rejoined by a servant who was devoted  to him in life and in death. This intrepid fellow was a Negro born on  the engineer's estate, of a slave father and mother, but to whom Cyrus,  who was an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12680"],[0,"Children of the Ghetto: A Study of a Peculiar People (#2)"],[1,"in the book and volume of their brain  would have been to charge their memories with an illegitimate if not an  impossible burden. Parchment books on a peculiar system with holes in  the pages and laces to go through the holes solved the problem of  bookkeeping without pen and ink. It is possible that many of the  worshippers were tempted to give beyond their means for fear of losing  the esteem of the _Shammos_ or Beadle, a potent personage only next in  influence to the President whose overcoat he obsequiously removed on the  greater man's annual visit to the synagogue. The Beadle's eye was all  over the _Shool_ at once, and he could settle an altercation about seats  without missing a single response. His automatic amens resounded  magnificently through the synagogue, at once a stimulus and a rebuke. It  was probably as a concession to him that poor men, who were neither  seat-holders nor wearers of chimney-pot hats, were penned within an iron  enclosure near the door of the building and ranged on backless benches,  and it says much for the authority of the _Shammos_ that not even the  _Schnorrer_ contested it. Prayers were shouted rapidly by the  congregation, and elaborately sung by the _Chazan_. The minister was  _Vox et praeterea nihil_. He was the only musical instrument permitted,  and on him devolved the whole onus of making the service attractive. He  succeeded. He was helped by the sociability of the gathering--for the  Synagogue was virtually a Jewish Club, the focus of the sectarian life.    Hard times and bitter had some of the fathers of the Ghetto, but they  ate their dry bread with the salt of humor, loved their wives, and  praised God for His mercies. Unwitting of the genealogies that would be  found for them by their prosperous grandchildren, old clo' men plied  their trade in ambitious content. They were meek and timorous outside  the Ghetto, walking warily for fear of the Christian. Sufferance was  still the badge of all their tribe. Yet that there were Jews who held  their heads high, let the following legend tell: Few men could shuffle  along more inoffensively or cry \"Old Clo'\" with a meeker twitter than  Sleepy Sol. The old man crawled one day, bowed with humility and  clo'-bag, into a military mews and uttered his tremulous chirp. To him  came one of the hostlers with insolent beetling brow.    \"Any gold lace?\" faltered Sleepy Sol.    \"Get out!\" roared the hostler.    \"I'll give you de best prices,\" pleaded Sleepy Sol.    \"Get out!\" repeated the hostler and hustled the old man into the street.  \"If I catch you 'ere again, I'll break your neck.\" Sleepy Sol loved his  neck, but the profit on gold lace torn from old uniforms was high. Next  week he crept into the mews again, trusting to meet another hostler.    \"Clo'! Clo'!\" he chirped faintly.    Alas! the brawny bully was to the fore again and recognized him.    \"You dirty old Jew,\" he cried. \"Take that, and that! The next time I  sees you, you'll go 'ome on a shutter.\"    The old man took that, and that, and went on his way. The next day he  came again.    \"Clo'! Clo'!\" he whimpered.    \"What!\" said the ruffian, his coarse cheeks flooded with angry blood.  \"Ev yer forgotten what I promised yer?\" He seized Sleepy Sol by the  scruff of the neck.    \"I say, why can't you leave the old man alone?\"    The hostler stared at the protester, whose presence he had not noticed  in the pleasurable excitement of the moment. It was a Jewish young man,  indifferently attired in a pepper-and-salt suit. The muscular hostler  measured him scornfully with his eye.    \"What's to do with you?\" he said, with studied contempt.    \"Nothing,\" admitted the intruder. \"And what harm is he doing you?\"    \"That's my bizness,\" answered the hostler, and tightened his clutch of  Sleepy Sol's nape.    \"Well, you'd better not mind it,\" answered the young man calmly. \"Let  go.\"'    The hostler's thick lips emitted a disdainful laugh.    \"Let go, d'you hear?\" repeated the young man.    \"I'll let go at your nose,\" said the hostler, clenching his knobby fist.    \"Very well,\" said the young man. \"Then I'll pull yours.\"    \"Oho!\" said the hostler, his scowl growing fiercer. \"Yer means bizness,  does yer?\" With that he sent Sleepy Sol staggering along the road and  rolled up his shirt-sleeves. His coat was already off.    The young man did not remove his; he quietly assumed the defensive. The  hostler sparred up to him with grim earnestness, and launched a terrible  blow at his most characteristic feature. The young man blandly put it on  one side, and planted a return blow on the hostler's ear. Enraged, his  opponent sprang upon him. The young Jew paralyzed him by putting his  left hand negligently into his pocket. With his remaining hand he closed  the hostler's right eye, and sent the flesh about it into mourning. Then  he carelessly tapped a little blood from the hostler's nose, gave him a  few thumps on the chest as if to test the strength of his lungs, and  laid him sprawling in the courtyard. A brother hostler ran out from the  stables and gave a cry of astonishment.    \"You'd better wipe his face,\" said the young man curtly.    The newcomer hurried back towards the stables.    \"Vait a moment,\" said Sleepy Sol \"I can sell you a sponge sheap; I've  got a beauty in my bag.\"    There were plenty of sponges about, but the newcomer bought the  second-hand sponge.    \"Do you want any more?\" the young man affably inquired of his prostrate  adversary.    The hostler gave a groan. He was shamed before a friend whom he had  early convinced of his fistic superiority.    \"No, I reckon he don't,\" said his friend, with a knowing grin at the  conqueror.    \"Then I will wish you a good day,\" said the young man. \"Come along,  father.\"    \"Yes, ma son-in-law,\" said Sleepy Sol.    \"Do you know who that was, Joe?\" said his friend, as he sponged away the  blood.    Joe shook his head.    \"That was Dutch Sam,\" said his friend in an awe-struck whisper.    All Joe's body vibrated with surprise and respect. Dutch Sam was the  champion bruiser of his time; in private life an eminent dandy and a  prime favorite of His Majesty George IV., and Sleepy Sol had a beautiful  daughter and was perhaps prepossessing himself when washed for the  Sabbath.    \"Dutch Sam!\" Joe repeated.    \"Dutch Sam! Why, we've got his picter hanging up inside, only he's naked  to the waist.\"    \"Well, strike me lucky! What a fool I was not to rekkernize 'im!\" His  battered face brightened up. \"No wonder he licked me!\"    Except for the comparative infrequency of the more bestial types of men  and women, Judaea has always been a cosmos in little, and its  prize-fighters and scientists, its philosophers and \"fences,\" its  gymnasts and money-lenders, its scholars and stockbrokers, its  musicians, chess-players, poets, comic singers, lunatics, saints,  publicans, politicians, warriors, poltroons, mathematicians, actors,  foreign correspondents, have always been in the first rank. _Nihil  alienum a se Judaeus putat_.    Joe and his friend fell to recalling Dutch Sam's great feats. Each  out-vied the other in admiration for the supreme pugilist.    Next day Sleepy Sol came rampaging down the courtyard. He walked at the  rate of five miles to the hour, and despite the weight of his bag his  head pointed to the zenith.    \"Clo'!\" he shrieked. \"Clo'!\"    Joe the hostler came out. His head was bandaged, and in his hand was  gold lace. It was something even to do business with a hero's  father-in-law.    But it is given to few men to marry their daughters to champion boxers:  and as Dutch Sam was not a Don Quixote, the average peddler or huckster  never enjoyed the luxury of prancing gait and cock-a-hoop business cry.  The primitive fathers of the Ghetto might have borne themselves more  jauntily had they foreseen that they were to be the ancestors of mayors  and aldermen descended from Castilian hidalgos and Polish kings, and  that an unborn historian would conclude that the Ghetto of their day was  peopled by princes in disguise. They would have been as surprised to  learn who they were as to be informed that they were orthodox. The great  Reform split did not occur till well on towards the middle of the  century, and the Jews of those days were unable to conceive that a man  could be a Jew without eating _kosher_ meat, and they would have looked  upon the modern distinctions between racial and religious Jews as the  sophistries of the convert or the missionary. If their religious life  converged to the Great _Shool_, their social life focussed on Petticoat  Lane, a long, narrow thoroughfare which, as late as Strype's day, was  lined with beautiful trees: vastly more pleasant they must have been  than the faded barrows and beggars of after days. The Lane--such was its  affectionate sobriquet--was the stronghold of hard-shell Judaism, the  Alsatia of \"infidelity\" into which no missionary dared set foot,  especially no apostate-apostle. Even in modern days the new-fangled  Jewish minister of the fashionable suburb, rigged out, like the  Christian clergyman, has been mistaken for such a _Meshumad_, and pelted  with gratuitous vegetables and eleemosynary eggs. The Lane was always  the great market-place, and every insalubrious street and alley abutting  on it was covered with the overflowings of its commerce and its mud.  Wentworth Street and Goulston Street were the chief branches, and in  festival times the latter was a pandemonium of caged poultry, clucking  and quacking and cackling and screaming. Fowls and geese and ducks were  bought alive, and taken to have their throats cut for a fee by the  official slaughterer. At Purim a gaiety, as of the Roman carnival,  enlivened the swampy Wentworth Street, and brought a smile into the  unwashed face of the pavement. The confectioners' shops, crammed with  \"stuffed monkeys\" and \"bolas,\" were besieged by hilarious crowds of  handsome girls and their young men, fat women and their"]]]
