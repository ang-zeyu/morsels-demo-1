I hope soon to hear how you get on at St. Polten [where her husband's  regiment was at that time quartered], and whether you still think of your  admirer and friend,    L. VAN BEETHOVEN.    My kindest regards to your excellent husband.    [Footnote 1: It was admitted that she played Beethoven's compositions with  the most admirable taste and feeling. Mendelssohn thought so in 1830 at  Milan, and mentions it in his _Letters from Italy and Switzerland_.]    [Footnote 2: Undoubtedly the Sonata dedicated to her, Op. 101.]      221.    TO ZMESKALL.    DEAR Z.,--    I introduce to your notice the bearer of this, young Bocklet, who is a very  clever violin-player. If you can be of any service to him through your  acquaintances, do your best for him, especially as he is warmly recommended  to me from Prague.[1]    As ever, your true friend,    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Carl Maria Bocklet, a well-known and distinguished pianist in  Vienna. He told me himself that he came for the first time to Vienna in  1817, where he stayed six weeks. On April 8th he gave a violin concert in  the _Kleine Redoutensaale_. He brought a letter of introduction to  Beethoven, from his friend Dr. Berger in Prague.]      222.    TO STEINER & CO.    The Lieutenant-General is desired to afford all aid and help to the young  artist Bocklet from Prague. He is the bearer of this note, and a virtuoso  on the violin. We hope that our command will be obeyed, especially as we  subscribe ourselves, with the most vehement regard, your    GENERALISSIMUS.      223.    TO G. DEL RIO.    I only yesterday read your letter attentively at home. I am prepared to  give up Carl to you at any moment, although I think it best not to do so  till after the examination on Monday; but I will send him sooner if you  wish it. At all events it would be advisable afterwards to remove him from  here, and to send him to Moelk, or some place where he will neither see nor  hear anything more of his abominable mother. When he is in the midst of  strangers, he will meet with less support, and find that he can only gain  the love and esteem of others by his own merits.    In haste, your    BEETHOVEN.      224.    TO G. DEL RIO.    I request you, my dear friend, to inquire whether in any of the houses in  your vicinity there are lodgings to be had at Michaelmas, consisting of a  few rooms. You must not fail to do this for me to-day or to-morrow.    Your friend,    L. VAN BEETHOVEN.    P.S.--N.B. Though I would gladly profit by your kind offer of living in  your garden-house, various circumstances render this impossible. My kind  regards to all your family.      225.    TO G. DEL RIO.    HOUSE OF GIANNATASIO!--    The treatise on the piano is a general one,--that is, it is a kind of  compendium. Besides, I am pleased with the Swiss [probably Weber, a young  musician who had been recommended to him], but the \"Guaden\" is no longer  the fashion.    In haste, the devoted servant and friend of the Giannatasio family,    BEETHOVEN.      226.    TO G. DEL RIO.    You herewith receive through Carl, my dear friend, the ensuing quarter due  to you. I beg you will attend more to the cultivation of his feelings and  kindness of heart, as the latter in particular is the lever of all that is  good; and no matter how a man's kindly feeling may be ridiculed or  depreciated, still our greatest authors, such as Goethe and others,  consider it an admirable quality; indeed, many maintain that without it no  man can ever be very distinguished, nor can any depth of character exist.    My time is too limited to say more, but we can discuss verbally how in my  opinion Carl ought to be treated on this point.    Your friend and servant,    L. VAN BEETHOVEN.    Alser Vorstadt--Beim Apfel, 2ter Etage,  No. 12, Leiberz, Dressmaker.      227.    TO G. DEL RIO.    This is at any rate the first time that it has been necessary to remind me  of an agreeable duty; very pressing business connected with my art, as well  as other causes, made me totally forget the account, but this shall not  occur again. As for my servant bringing home Carl in the evening, the  arrangement is already made. In the mean time I thank you for having been  so obliging as to send your servant for him yesterday, as I knew nothing  about it, so that Carl probably must otherwise have remained at Czerny's.  Carl's boots are too small, and he has repeatedly complained of this;  indeed, they are so bad that he can scarcely walk, and it will take some  time before they can be altered to fit him. This kind of thing ruins the  feet, so I beg you will not allow him to wear them again till they are made  larger.    With regard to his pianoforte studies, I beg you will keep him strictly to  them; otherwise his music-master would be of no use. Yesterday Carl could  not play the whole day, I have repeatedly wished to hear him play over his  lessons, but have been obliged to come away without doing so.      \"_La musica merita d'esser studiata._\"    Besides, the couple of hours now appointed for his music lessons are quite  insufficient. I must therefore the more earnestly urge on you their being  strictly adhered to. It is by no means unusual that this point should be  attended to in an institute; an intimate friend of mine has also a boy at  school, who is to become a professor of music, where every facility for  study is afforded him; indeed, I was rather struck by finding the boy quite  alone in a distant room practising, neither disturbing others, nor being  himself disturbed.    I beg you will allow me to send for Carl to-morrow about half-past ten  o'clock, as I wish to see what progress he has made, and to take him with  me to some musicians.    I am, with all possible esteem, your friend,    L. VAN BEETHOVEN.      228.    TO CZERNY.    DEAR CZERNY,--    I beg you will treat Carl with as much patience as possible; for though he  does not as yet get on quite as you and I could wish, still I fear he will  soon do even less, because (though I do not want him to know it) he is  over-fatigued by the injudicious distribution of his lesson hours.  Unluckily it is not easy to alter this; so pray, however strict you may be,  show him every indulgence, which will, I am sure, have also a better effect  on Carl under such unfavorable circumstances.    With respect to his playing with you, when he has finally acquired the  proper mode of fingering, and plays in right time, and gives the notes with  tolerable correctness, you must only then first direct his attention to the  mode of execution; and when he is sufficiently advanced, do not stop his  playing on account of little mistakes, but only point them out at the end  of the piece. Although I have myself given very little instruction, I have  always followed this system, which quickly forms a _musician_; and this is,  after all, one of the first objects of art, and less fatiguing both to  master and scholar. In certain passages, like the following,--    [Music: Treble clef, sixteenth notes.]    I wish all the fingers to be used; and also in similar ones, such as  these,--    [Music: Treble clef, sixteenth notes.] &c.  [Music: Treble clef, sixteenth notes.] &c.    so that they may go very smoothly; such passages can indeed be made to  sound very _perles_, or like a pearl, played by fewer fingers, but  sometimes we wish for a different kind of jewel.[1] More as to this some  other time. I hope that you will receive these suggestions in the same  kindly spirit in which they are offered and intended. In any event I am,  and ever must remain, your debtor. May my candor serve as a pledge of my  wish to discharge this debt at some future day!    Your true friend,    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: Carl Czerny relates in the Vienna _A.M. Zeitung_ of 1845, No.  113, as follows:--\"Beethoven came to me usually every day himself with the  boy, and used to say to me, 'You must not think that you please me by  making Carl play my works; I am not so childish as to wish anything of the  kind. Give him whatever you think best.' I named Clementi. 'Yes, yes,' said  he, 'Clementi is very good indeed;' and, added he, laughing, 'Give Carl  occasionally what is _according to rule_, that he may hereafter come to  what is _contrary to rule_.' After a hit of this sort, which he introduced  into almost every speech, he used to burst into a loud peal of laughter.  Having in the earlier part of his career been often reproached by the  critics with his _irregularities_, he was in the habit of alluding to this  with gay humor.\"]      229.    TO CZERNY.    DEAR CZERNY,--    I beg you will say nothing _on that particular subject_ at Giannatasio's,  who dined with us on the day you were so good as to call on me; he  requested this himself. I _will tell you the reason_ when we meet. I hope  to be able to prove my gratitude for your patience with my nephew, that I  may not always remain your debtor. In haste,    Your friend,    BEETHOVEN.      230.    TO CZERNY.    DEAR CZERNY,--    Can you in any way assist the man I now send to you (a pianoforte maker and  tuner from Baden) in selling his instruments? Though small in size, their  manufacture is solid. In haste,    Your friend,    BEETHOVEN.      231.    TO ZMESKALL.    Wednesday, July 3, 1817.    DEAR ZMESKALL,--    I have changed my mind. It might hurt the feelings of Carl's mother to see  her child in the house of a stranger, which would be more harsh than I  like; so I shall allow her to come to my house to-morrow; a certain tutor  at Puthon, of the name of Bihler, will also be present. I should be  _extremely_ glad if you could be with me about six o'clock, but not later.  Indeed, I earnestly beg you to come, as I am desirous to show the Court  that you are present, for there is no doubt that a _Court Secretary_ will  be held in higher estimation by them than a man _without an official  character, whatever his moral character may be!_    Now, jesting apart,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13274"],[0,"A Little Catechism; With Little Verses and Little Sayings for Little Children (#2)"],[1,"   Remember thy Creator in the dayes of thy Youth; and thy Creator will  remember thee in the dayes of thy Old Age.                  Praying      Is better than Playing.      Grace is better than Gold.      Singing of Psalms      Is better than Ringing of Bells.      Mothers love young Children,      And Christ loves young Saints.      It is better not to live in the World,      Than to live without God in the World.      One day in God's Courts,      Is better than a thousand elsewhere.      God's Presence makes Heaven, and      God's Absence makes Hell.      If I draw nigh to God,      God will draw nigh to me.      In God's Favour is Life, and      In God's displeasure is Death.      If I put off my Repentance to another day,      I have a day more to Repent of,      And a day, less to Repent in.      Christ is a poor Sinners Hope.      Christ's Blood is a Souls Ransom.      To have a Portion in the World is a Mercy,      But to have the World for a Portion is Misery.      An Interest in Christ is the greatest Interest.      The Love of God is sweeter than Wine,      And better than Life.      God's Ways are the best Ways,      God's Peace is the best Peace, and      God's People are the best People.      The worst of the ways of GOD, are better than the                                     best of the ways of Sin.      'Tis better to suffer the greatest Suffering in the World,      Than to sin the least Sin in the World.      A poor Man is better than a Liar.      Without Holiness no Man shall see the Lord.            IF I BE NOT Holy,      Heaven cannot make me Happy.      I must do the Lords-Work      On the Lords-Day.      If I want a Dram of Grace to Tame my Tongue,      The time will come when I shall want a            drop of Water to Cool my                  TONGUE.        _FINIS._"]]]
