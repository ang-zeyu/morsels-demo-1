It may readily be conceived,  then, that such a state of things soon led to violent scenes and bitter  grief. Josephine was too beautiful and amiable not to attract attention  and admiration wherever she went, and she was not yet _blasee_ and  hackneyed enough to take no pleasure in the court thus paid to her, and  the admiration so universally shown her, nor even to omit doing her part  to win them. But, while she was naive and innocent at heart, she  required of her husband that these trifling outside coquetries should  not disquiet him nor render him distrustful, and that he should repose  the most unshaken confidence in her. Her pride revolted against his  suspicions, as did his jealousy against her seeming frivolity; and both  became quite willing, at last, to separate, notwithstanding the love  they really bore each other at the bottom of their hearts, had not their  children rendered such a separation impossible. These children were a  son, Eugene, and a daughter, Hortense, four years younger than the boy.  Both parents loved these children with passionate tenderness; and often  when one of the stormy scenes at which we have hinted took place in the  presence of the young people, an imploring word from Eugene or a caress  from little Hortense would suffice to reconcile their father and  mother, whose anger, after all, was but the result of excessive  attachment.    But these domestic broils became more violent with time, and the moment  arrived when Eugene was no longer there to stand by his little sister in  her efforts to soothe the irritation of her parents. The viscount had  sent Eugene, who was now seven years of age, to a boarding-school; and  little Hortense, quite disheartened by the absence of her brother, had  no longer the means or the courage to allay the quarrels that raged  between her parents, but would escape in terror and dismay, when they  broke out, to some lonely corner, and there weep bitterly over a  misfortune, the extent of which her poor little childish heart could not  yet estimate.    In the midst of this gloomy and stormy period, the young viscountess  received a letter from Martinique. It was from her mother, Madame  Tascher de la Pagerie, who vividly depicted to her daughter the terrors  of her lonely situation in her huge, silent residence, where there was  no one around her but servants and slaves, whose singularly altered and  insubordinate manner had, of late, alarmed the old lady, and filled her  with secret apprehensions for the future. She, therefore, besought her  daughter to come to her, and live with her, so that she might cheer the  last few years of her mother's existence with the bright presence of her  dazzling youth.    Josephine accepted this appealing letter from her mother as a hint from  destiny; and, weary of her domestic wrangles, and resolved to end them  forever, she took her little daughter, Hortense, then scarcely four  years old, and with her sailed away from France, to seek beyond the  ocean and in her mother's arms the new happiness of undisturbed  tranquillity.    But, at that juncture, tranquillity had fled the world. The mutterings  and moanings of the impending tempest could be heard on all sides. A  subterranean rumbling was audible throughout all lands; a dull  thundering and outcry, as though the solid earth were about to change  into one vast volcano--one measureless crater--that would dash to atoms,  and entomb, with its blazing lava-streams and fiery cinder-showers, the  happiness and peace of all humanity. And, finally, this terrific crater  did, indeed, open and hurl destruction and death on all sides, over the  whole world, uprooting, with demoniac fury, entire races and nations,  and silencing the merry laugh and harmless jest with the overpowering  echoes of its awful voice!    This volcano was the revolution. In France, the first and most fearful  explosion of this terrific crater occurred, but the whole world shook  and heaved with it, and, on all sides, the furious masses from beneath  overflowed on the surface, seeking to reverse the order of things and  place the lowest where the highest had been. Even away in Martinique  this social earthquake was felt, which had already, in France, flung out  the bloody guillotine from its relentless crater. This guillotine had  become the altar of the so-called enfranchisement of nations, and upon  this altar the intoxicated, unthinking masses offered up to their new  idol those who, until then, had been their lords and masters, and by  whose death they now believed that they could purchase freedom  for evermore.    \"_Egalite! fraternite! liberte!_\" Such was the battle-cry of this  howling, murdering populace. Such were the three words which burned in  blood-red letters of fire above the guillotine, and their mocking emblem  was the glittering axe, that flashed down, to sever from their bodies  the heads of the aristocrats whom, in spite of the new religion  represented in those three words, they would not recognize as brethren  and equals, or admit to the freedom of life and of opinion. And this  battle-cry of the murderous French populace had penetrated as far as  Martinique, where it had aroused the slaves from their sullen obedience  to the point of demanding by force that participation in freedom,  equality, and brotherhood, that had so long been denied them. They, at  last, rose everywhere in open insurrection against their masters, and  the firebrands which they hurled into the dwellings of the whites served  as the bridal torches to their espousal of liberty.    The house of Madame Tascher de la Pagerie was one of the abodes in which  these firebrands fell.    One night Josephine was awakened by the blinding light of the flames,  which had already penetrated to her chamber. With a shriek of terror,  she sprang from her bed, caught up little Hortense in her arms from the  couch where the child lay quietly slumbering, wrapped her in the  bedclothes, and rushed, in her night-attire, from the house. She burst,  with the lion-like courage of a mother, through the shouting, fighting  crowds of soldiers and blacks outside, and fled, with all the speed of  mortal terror, toward the harbor. There lay a French vessel, just ready  to weigh anchor. An officer, who at that moment was stepping into the  small boat that was to convey him to the departing ship, saw this young  woman, as, holding her child tightly to her bosom, she sank down, with  one last despairing cry, half inanimate, upon the beach. Filled with the  deepest compassion, he hastened to her, and, raising both mother and  child in his arms, he bore them to his boat, which then instantly put  out from land, and bounded away over the billows with its lovely burden.    The ship was soon reached, and Josephine, still tightly clasping her  child to her breast, and happy in having saved this only jewel, climbed  up the unsteady ladder to the ship's decks. Until this moment all her  thoughts remained concentrated upon her child, and it was only when she  had seen her little Hortense safely put to bed in the cabin and free  from all danger--only after she had fulfilled all the duties of a  mother, that the woman revived in her breast, and she cast shamed and  frightened glances around her. Only half-clad, in light, fluttering  night-clothes, without any other covering to her beautiful neck and  bosom than her superb, luxuriant hair, which fell around her and partly  hid them, like a thick black veil, stood the young Viscountess  Josephine de Beauharnais, in the midst of a group of gazing men!    However, some of the ladies on the ship came to her aid, and, so soon as  her toilet had been sufficiently improved, Josephine eagerly requested  to be taken back to land, in order that she might fly to her mother's  assistance.    But the captain opposed this request, as he was unwilling to give the  young fugitive over to the tender mercies of the assassins who were  burning and massacring ashore, and whose murderous yells could be  distinctly heard on board of the vessel. The entire coast, so far as the  eye could reach, looked like another sea--a sea, though, of flame and  smoke, which shot up its leaping billows in long tongues of fire far  against the sky. It was a terrible, an appalling spectacle; and  Josephine fled from it to the bedside of her little sleeping daughter.  Then, kneeling there by the couch of her child, she uplifted to heaven  her face, down which the tears were streaming, and implored God to spare  her mother.    But, meanwhile, the ship weighed anchor, and sped farther and farther  away from this blazing coast.    Josephine stood on the deck and gazed back at her mother's burning home,  which gradually grew less to her sight, then glimmered only like a tiny  star on the distant horizon, and finally vanished altogether. With that  last ray her childhood and past life had sunk forever in the sea, and a  new world and a new life opened for both mother and child. The past was,  like the ships of Cortez, burned behind her; yet it threw a magic light  far away over into her future, and as Josephine stood there with her  little Hortense in her arms, and sent her last farewell to the island  where her early days had been spent, she bethought her of the old  mulatto-woman who had whispered in her ear one day:    \"You will go back to France, and, ere long after that, all France will  be at your feet. You will be greater there than a queen.\"        CHAPTER II.    THE PROPHECY.    It was toward the close of the year 1790 that Josephine, with her little  daughter, Hortense, arrived in Paris and took up her residence in a  small dwelling. There she soon received the intelligence of the rescue  of her mother, and of the re-establishment of peace in Martinique. In  France, however, the revolution and the guillotine still raged, and the  banner of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12027"],[0,"Crime: Its Cause and Treatment (#2)"],[1,"mind, and if it were, would  it be more reliable than the other faculties? It has been often said  that some divine power implanted conscience in every human being. Apart  from the question of whether human beings are different in kind from  other organisms, which will be discussed later, if conscience has been  placed in man by a divine power, why have not all peoples been furnished  with the same guide? There is no doubt that all men of any mentality  have what is called a conscience; that is, a feeling that certain things  are right, and certain other things are wrong. This conscience does not  affect all the actions of life, but probably the ones which to them are  the most important. It varies, however, with the individual. What reason  has the world to believe that conscience is a correct guide to right  and wrong?    The origin of conscience is easily understood. One's conscience is  formed as his habits are formed--by the time and place in which he  lives; it grows with his teachings, his habits and beliefs. With most  people it takes on the color of the community where they live. With some  people the eating of pork would hurt their conscience; with others the  eating of any meat; with some the eating of meat on Friday, and with  others the playing of any game of chance for money, or the playing of  any game on Sunday, or the drinking of intoxicating liquors. Conscience  is purely a matter of environment, education and temperament, and is no  more infallible than any habit or belief. Whether one should always  follow his own conscience is another question, and cannot be confounded  with the question as to whether conscience is an infallible guide to  conduct.    Some seek to avoid the manifold difficulties of the problem by saying  that a \"criminal\" is one who is \"anti-social.\" But does this bring us  nearer to the light? An anti-social person is one whose life is hostile  to the organization or the society in which he lives; one who injures  the peace, contentment, prosperity or well-being of his neighbors, or  the political or social organization in which his life is cast.    In this sense many of the most venerated men of history have been  criminals; their lives and teachings have been in greater or lesser  conflict with the doctrines, habits and beliefs of the communities where  they lived. From the nature of things the wise man and the idealist can  never be contented with existing things, and their lives are a constant  battle for change. If the anti-social individual should be punished,  what of many of the profiteers and captains of industry who manipulate  business and property for purely selfish ends? What of many of our great  financiers who use every possible reform and conventional catch word as  a means of affecting public opinion, so that they may control the  resources of the earth and exploit their fellows for their own gain?    No two men have the same power of adaptation to the group, and it is  quite plain that the ones who are the most servile and obedient to the  opinions and life of the crowd are the greatest enemies to change and  individuality. The fact is, none of the generally accepted theories of  the basis of right and wrong has ever been the foundation of law or  morals. The basis that the world has always followed, and perhaps always  will accept, is not hard to find.    The criminal is the one who violates habits and customs of life, the  \"folk-ways\" of the community where he lives. These customs and folk-ways  must be so important in the opinion of the community as to make their  violation a serious affair. Such violation is considered evil regardless  of whether the motives are selfish or unselfish, good or bad. The  folk-ways have a certain validity and a certain right to respect, but no  one who believes in change can deny that they are a hindrance as well as  a good. Men did not arrive at moral ideas by a scientific or a religious  investigation of good and bad, of right and wrong, of social or  anti-social life.    Man lived before he wrote laws, and before he philosophized. He began  living simply and automatically; he adopted various \"taboos\" which to  him were omens of bad luck, and certain charms, incantations and the  like, which made him immune from ill-fortune.    All sorts of objects, acts and phenomena have been the subjects of  taboo, and just as numerous and weird have been the charms and amulets  and ceremonies that saved him from the dangers that everywhere beset his  way. The life of the primitive human being was a journey down a narrow  path; outside were infinite dangers from which magic alone could make  him safe.    All animal life automatically groups itself more or less closely into  herds. Buffaloes, horses and wolves run in packs. Some of these groups  are knit closely together like ants and bees, while the units of others  move much more widely apart. But whatever the group may be, its units  must conform. If the wolf gets too far from the pack it suffers or dies;  it matters not whether it be to the right or the left, behind or ahead,  it must stay with the pack or be lost.    Men from the earliest time arranged themselves into groups; they  traveled in a certain way; they established habits and customs and ways  of life. These \"folk-ways\" were born long before human laws and were  enforced more rigidly than the statutes of a later age. Slowly men  embodied their \"taboos,\" their incantations, their habits and customs  into religions and statutes. A law was only a codification of a habit or  custom that long ago was a part of the life of a people. The legislator  never really makes the law; he simply writes in the books what has  already become the rule of action by force of custom or opinion, or at  least what he thinks has become a law.    One class of men has always been anxious to keep step with the crowd.  The way is easier and the rewards more certain. Another class has been  skeptical and resentful of the crowd. These men have refused to follow  down the beaten path; they strayed into the wilderness seeking new and  better ways. Sometimes others have followed and a shorter path was made.  Often they have perished because they left the herd. In the sight of the  organized unit and the society of the time and place, the man who kept  the path did right. The man who tried to make a new path and left the  herd did wrong. In its last analysis, the criminal is the one who leaves  the pack. He may lag behind or go in front, he may travel to the right  or to the left, he may be better or worse, but his fate is the same.    The beaten path, however formed or however unscientific, has some right  to exist. On the whole it has tended to preserve life, and it is the way  of least resistance for the human race. On the other hand it is not the  best, and the way has ever been made easier by those who have violated  precepts and defied some of the concepts of the time. Both ways are  right and both ways are wrong. The conflict between the two ways is as  old as the human race.    Paths and customs and institutions are forever changing. So are ideas of  right and wrong, and so, too, are statutes. The law, no doubt, makes it  harder for customs and habits to be changed, for it adds to the inertia  of the existing thing.    Is there, then, nothing in the basis of right and wrong that answers to  the common conception of these words? There are some customs that have  been forbidden longer and which, it seems, must necessarily be longer  prohibited; but the origin of all is the same. A changing world has  shown how the most shocking crimes punished by the severest penalties  have been taken from the calendar and no longer even bear the suspicion  of wrong. Religious differences, witchcraft and sorcery have probably  brought more severe punishments than any other acts; yet a change of  habit and custom and belief has long since abolished all such crimes.  So, too, crimes come and go with new ideals, new movements and  conditions. The largest portion of our criminal code deals with the  rights of property; yet nearly all of this is of comparatively modern  growth. A new emotion may take possession of man which will result in  the repeal of many if not all of these statutes, and place some other  consideration above property, which seems to be the controlling emotion  of today.    Crime, strictly speaking, is only such conduct or acts as are forbidden  by the law and for which penalties are prescribed. The classification of  the act does not necessarily have relation to moral conduct. This cannot  be fixed by any exact standard. There is no straight clear line between  the good and bad, the right and wrong. The general ways of determining  good and bad conduct are of little value. The line between the two is  always uncertain and shifting. And, in the last analysis, good or bad  conduct rests upon the \"folk-ways,\" the habits, beliefs and customs of a  community. While this is the real basis of judging conduct, it is  always changing, and from the nature of things, if it could be made  stable, it would mean that society was stratified and all hope of  improvement dead.          II    PURPOSE OF PUNISHMENT      Neither the purpose nor the effect of punishment has ever been  definitely agreed upon, even by its most strenuous advocates. So long as  punishment persists it will be a subject of discussion and dispute. No  doubt the idea of punishment originated in the feeling of resentment and  hatred and vengeance that, to some extent at least, is incident to life.  The dog is hit with a stick and turns and bites the stick. Animals repel  attack and fight their enemies to death. The primitive man vented his  hatred and vengeance on things animate and inanimate. In the tribes no  injury was satisfied until some member of the offending tribe was  killed. In more recent times family feuds have followed down the  generations and were not forgotten until the last "]]]
