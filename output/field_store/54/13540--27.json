From the remotest ages of antiquity most nations have practised  fasting to keep the wrath of God from falling upon them for their  sins. Some celebrated authors even affirm that fasting was originated  by Adam after he had eaten of the forbidden fruit; but this obviously  is carrying their arguments, in favour of fasting, too far, though it  is as certain that the Jewish churches practised it from their first  formation. The Egyptians, Phoenicians, and the Assyrians held the  \"solemn fast\" in high favour. The Egyptians, according to Herodotus,  before they offered in sacrifice the cow to Isis, to purify themselves  from impurities, fasted and prayed. This custom he also ascribes to  the Cyrenian women. Porphyry relates that the fasts of the Egyptians  were sometimes continued for six weeks, and that the shortest ordained  by their priests was seven days, during which they abstained from  nearly all kinds of food. These rites they communicated to the Greeks,  who observed these fasts more strictly, and with more outward show and  solemnity. The Athenians likewise observed stated fasts, two of which  were named \"the Elusinian and Thesmoporian fasts;\" the observation  of these fasts was extremely rigid, especially amongst women, who,  in mournful dresses, spent one whole day sitting on the ground (their  sign of grief,) without taking the least food. The islanders of Crete,  before sacrificing to Jupiter, had to abstain from food. A celebrated  ancient author informs us, that those who wished to be initiated into  the secrets of Cybele, fasted ten days before their initiation; and  that, in short, the priests who gave the oracles, and those who came  to consult them, had to perform this duty.    Amongst other Heathen nations, before they prepared for any important  enterprise, the whole expedition fasted. The Lacedemonians having  agreed to aid an ally, ordained a fast throughout their nation, and  without _even_ excepting their _domestic animals_. The Romans having  besieged the city of Tarentum, and the city being hard pressed,  the citizens demanded succour of their friends, the inhabitants of  Rhegium; who, preparatory to granting assistance to the besieged,  commanded that a fast should be held throughout their territories.  Their aid having proved successful, the government of Tarentum to  commemorate this important event, ordained a perpetual fast on the day  of their deliverance.    Philosophers and certain religious people have for ages reckoned  fasting as a service which led to important results, and a duty which  could not be dispensed with without causing the wrath of God to fall  upon the heads of the nation. At Rome it was practised even by the  emperors. Amongst the most remarkable for keeping this institution  were Numa Pompilius, Julius Caesar, Vespasian, &c. Julian, the  apostate, was so exact in the performance of this ordinance, that  the fasting of the philosophers and of the priests themselves, was as  nothing compared with his abstinence. Pythagoras fasted sometimes  as long as forty days; his disciples followed the example of their  master; and after his death they kept a continual fast, in which they  denounced the inhabitants of the deep as well as the creatures of the  meadow. The eastern Brahmins are remarkable for their fasting; but as  the people believe they regale themselves with the good things of this  life, in secret, their example gains not many followers. That nation  which reckons itself infinitely superior to _us_ \"poor barbarians,\"  the Chinese, also observe stated seasons of fasting and prayer. The  Mahomedans likewise strictly observe fasting and prayer, and the  exactness with which the dervishes perform them, and the lengths of  time of their fasts are very remarkable.    The Israelites were commanded by Jehovah himself to fast on the  appearance of any plague, famine, war, &c.; and though they sadly  neglected the commands of God in other particulars, yet they obeyed  this command with great devotedness. The abstinence of the ancient  Jews generally lasted from twenty-six to twenty-seven hours. On these  days they wore sackcloth, laid themselves in ashes, and sprinkled  them on their heads, in token of their great grief and penitence. Some  spent the whole night in the synagogue; occasionally using with great  effect a scourge as a penance for their sins, or as a stimulant to  devout behaviour. We think it is not improbable that it is from the  Jews that the Roman Catholics derived their scourging penance system.    In \"happy smiling England,\" fasting was, and is, practised by the  Catholics every Friday; it was also practised by the fathers of the  church, and the primitive Protestants, at stated seasons. The custom  is still observed amongst the methodists, who follow the example of  their great leader, Wesley. The rust of time has, however, worn away  the veneration for this \"good _old_ system,\" and it is totally  disused by the general body of Protestants, except on great national  occasions.

[The subsequent paper extracted from Mr. Brayley's      laboriously-compiled _Londiniana_ possesses more than a      passing interest. Its neatness and perspicuity as a Journal      will doubtless be appreciated by the reader.]    The following particulars relating to the office of Sheriff, are  derived from a manuscript copy of the _Journal_ of Richard Hoare,  Esq. during the year of his Shrievalty, in 1740-41, in his own  hand-writing, which is now in the possession of his grandson, Sir  Richard Colt Hoare, Bart., of Stourhead, in Wiltshire. The above year  became memorable in the city annals, from their having been _three_  Lord Mayors during its progress, viz. Sir John Salter, knight; Humphry  Parsons, Esq., and Daniel Lambert, Esq.    Mr. Hoare, who was a banker, in Fleet Street, and principal of the  respectable house which, instituted by one of his predecessors, still  bears the family name, was elected alderman of the Ward of Farringdon  Without, on St. George's day, 1740, in the place of Sir Francis Child,  who died on the preceding Sunday, April the 20th. This honour was  conferred upon him, whilst he was at Bath, and quite unexpectedly; and  equally so, was his election to the Sheriffdom, conjointly with Mr.  Alderman Marshall, on the midsummer-day following. Shortly afterwards  they gave bonds under the penalty of 1,000_l_. to undertake and enter  upon the office on the ensuing Michaelmas eve; and \"thereupon, became  each entitled to 100_l_. out of the forfeitures of those, who had this  year been nominated to be sheriff's by my Lord Mayor, but had paid  their fines to be excused.\"    In the intermediate time they prepared for the due execution of their  duties, chose their under-sheriff's, &c.; and, \"as it is customary for  each sheriff to preside over the two Counters separately, my brother  Marshall chose that in the Poultry, and the care of Wood-street  Counter was under my direction, and we agreed, at our joint expense,  to give the usual livery gowns to the officers of both, although they  are greater in number at the Poultry than in mine; in recompense for  which, it was settled that we should equally share in the sale of the  places upon any vacancy.\"    On Sunday, the 28th of September, the sheriffs elect met at ten  o'clock in the morning, at Drapers' Hall, \"and there entertained  several of the Court of Aldermen, and sixteen of the Court of  Assistance of each of the Companies, viz: the Goldsmiths and the  Drapers, with the usual breakfast of roast beef, burnt wine,\" &c. He  continues,--    \"Upon notice sent to us, that the Lord Mayor, with George Heathcote,  and Sir John Lequesne, aldermen and sheriffs for the last year were  attending at the council chamber, Guildhall, we all repaired thither;  the gentlemen of the Court of Assistance walking two by two, the  senior sheriff's company on the right hand, the aldermen following in  their coaches; in which, we, though sheriffs-elect, took our rank as  aldermen. Upon coming up to the area of Guildhall, the two companies  made a lane for the aldermen to pass through, and after having waited  on my Lord Mayor to Guildhall Chapel, to hear divine service, we  returned back to the court of the hustings, which being opened by  the common cryer, we were summoned to come forth and take the oath  of office; which we accordingly did, together with the oaths of  allegiance and abjuration; and the same was also administered to Mr.  Tims, (clerk to St. Bartholomews,) as under-sheriff, he kneeling all  the while.    \"When this was over, the gold chains were taken off from the former  sheriffs, and put on us; and then the court being dissolved, the Lord  Mayor went home, attended by the former sheriffs, and we returned back  to Drapers' Hall to our dinner, provided for the Court of Aldermen and  Courts of Assistance, at which the senior alderman took the chair as  president, and the rest of the aldermen and gentlemen of Guildhall  took their places at the upper table, whilst we, the sheriffs, sat  at the head of the second table, with the gentlemen of the Courts of  Assistance of our two companies.

Oh, fie upon the wicked  sons of Dhritarashtra!'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"Saying this, the weeping king sat himself down  upon the ground. Then a learned Brahmana, Saunaka by name versed in  self-knowledge and skilled in the _Sankhya_ system of yoga, addressed  the king, saying, 'Causes of grief by thousands, and causes of fear by  hundreds, day after day, overwhelm the ignorant but not the wise.  Surely, sensible men like thee never suffer themselves to be deluded by  acts that are opposed to true knowledge, fraught with every kind of  evil, and destructive of salvation. O king, in thee dwelleth that  understanding furnished with the eight attributes which is said to be  capable of providing against all evils and which resulteth from a study  of the _Sruti (Vedas)_ and scriptures! And men like unto thee are never  stupefied, on the accession of poverty or an affliction overtaking their  friends, through bodily or mental uneasiness! Listen, I shall tell the  _slokas_ which were chanted of old by the illustrious Janaka touching  the subject of controlling the self! This world is afflicted with both  bodily and mental suffering. Listen now to the means of allaying it as I  indicate them both briefly and in detail. Disease, contact with painful  things, toil and want of objects desired.--these are the four causes  that induce bodily suffering. And as regards disease, it may be allayed  by the application of medicine, while mental ailments are cured by  seeking to forget them by _yoga_-meditation. For this reason, sensible  physicians first seek to allay the mental sufferings of their patients  by agreeable converse and the offer of desirable objects. And as a hot  iron bar thrust into a jar maketh the water therein hot, even so doth  mental grief bring on bodily agony. And as water quencheth fire, so doth  true knowledge allay mental disquietude. And the mind attaining ease,  the body findeth ease also. It seemeth that affection is the root of all  mental sorrow. It is affection that maketh every creature miserable and  bringeth on every kind of woe. Verily affection is the root of all  misery and of all fear, of joy and grief of every kind of pain. From  affection spring all purposes, and it is from affection that spring the  love of worldly goods! Both of these (latter) are sources of evil,  though the first (our purposes) is worse than the second. And as (a  small portion of) fire thrust into the hollow of a tree consumeth the  tree itself to its roots, even so affection, ever so little, destroyeth  both virtue and profit. He cannot be regarded to have renounced the  world who hath merely withdrawn from worldly possessions. He, however,  who though in actual contact with the world regardeth its faults, may be  said to have truly renounced the world. Freed from every evil passion,  soul dependent on nothing with such a one hath truly renounced the  world. Therefore, should no one seek to place his affections on either  friends or the wealth he hath earned. And so should affection for one's  own person be extinguished by knowledge. Like the lotus-leaf that is  never drenched by water, the souls of men capable of distinguishing  between the ephemeral and the everlasting, of men devoted to the pursuit  of the eternal, conversant with the scriptures and purified by  knowledge, can never be moved by affection. The man that is influenced  by affection is tortured by desire; and from the desire that springeth  up in his heart his thirst for worldly possessions increaseth. Verily,  this thirst is sinful and is regarded as the source of all anxieties. It  is this terrible thirst, fraught with sin that leaneth unto unrighteous  acts. Those find happiness that can renounce this thirst, which can  never be renounced by the wicked, which decayeth not with the decay of  the body, and which is truly a fatal disease! It hath neither beginning  nor end. Dwelling within the heart, it destroyeth creatures, like a fire  of incorporeal origin. And as a faggot of wood is consumed by the fire  that is fed by itself, even so doth a person of impure soul find  destruction from the covetousness born of his heart. And as creatures  endued with life have ever a dread of death, so men of wealth are in  constant apprehension of the king and the thief, of water and fire and  even of their relatives. And as a morsel of meat, if in air, may be  devoured by birds; if on ground by beasts of prey; and if in water by  the fishes; even so is the man of wealth exposed to dangers wherever he  may be. To many the wealth they own is their bane, and he that beholding  happiness in wealth becometh wedded to it, and knoweth not true  happiness. And hence accession of wealth is viewed as that which  increaseth covetousness and folly. Wealth alone is the root of  niggardliness and boastfulness, pride and fear and anxiety! These are  the miseries of men that the wise see in riches! Men undergo infinite  miseries in the acquisition and retention of wealth. Its expenditure  also is fraught with grief. Nay, sometimes, life itself is lost for the  sake of wealth! The abandonment of wealth produces misery, and even they  that are cherished by one's wealth become enemies for the sake of that  wealth! When, therefore, the possession of wealth is fraught with such  misery, one should not mind its loss. It is the ignorant alone who are  discontented. The wise, however, are always content. The thirst of  wealth can never be assuaged. Contentment is the highest happiness;  therefore, it is, that the wise regard contentment as the highest object  of pursuit. The wise knowing the instability of youth and beauty, of  life and treasure-hoards, of prosperity and the company of the loved  ones, never covet them. Therefore, one should refrain from the  acquisition of wealth, bearing the pain incident to it. None that is  rich is free from trouble, and it is for this that the virtuous applaud  them that are free from the desire of wealth. And as regards those that  pursue wealth for purposes of virtue, it is better for them to refrain  altogether from such pursuit, for, surely, it is better not to touch  mire at all than to wash it off after having been besmeared with it.  And, O Yudhishthira, it behoveth thee not to covet anything! And if thou  wouldst have virtue, emancipate thyself from desire of worldly  possessions!'    \"Yudhishthira said, 'O Brahmana, this my desire of wealth is not for  enjoying it when obtained. It is only for the support of the Brahmanas  that I desire it and not because I am actuated by avarice! For what  purpose, O Brahmana, doth one like us lead a domestic life, if he cannot  cherish and support those that follow him? All creatures are seen to  divide the food (they procure) amongst those that depend on them.[1] So  should a person leading a domestic life give a share of his food to  _Yatis_ and _Brahmacharins_ that have renounced cooking for themselves.  The houses of the good men can never be in want of grass (for seat),  space (for rest), water (to wash and assuage thirst), and fourthly,  sweet words. To the weary a bed,--to one fatigued with standing, a  seat,--to the thirsty, water,--and to the hungry, food should ever be  given. To a guest are due pleasant looks and a cheerful heart and sweet  words. The host, rising up, should advance towards the guest, offer him  a seat, and duly worship him. Even this is eternal morality. They that  perform not the _Agnihotra_,[2] do not wait upon bulls, nor cherish  their kinsmen and guests and friends and sons and wives and servants,  are consumed with sin for such neglect. None should cook his food for  himself alone and none should slay an animal without dedicating it to  the gods, the _pitris_, and guests. Nor should one eat of that food  which hath not been duly dedicated to the gods and _pitris_. By  scattering food on the earth, morning and evening, for (the behoof of)  dogs and _Chandalas_ and birds, should a person perform the _Viswedeva_  sacrifice.[3] He that eateth the _Vighasa_, is regarded as eating  ambrosia. What remaineth in a sacrifice after dedication to the gods and  the _pitris_ is regarded as ambrosia; and what remaineth after feeding  the guest is called _Vighasa_ and is equivalent to ambrosia itself.  Feeding a guest is equivalent to a sacrifice, and the pleasant looks the  host casteth upon the guest, the attention he devoteth to him, the sweet  words in which he addresseth him, the respect he payeth by following  him, and the food and drink with which he treateth him, are the five  _Dakshinas_[4] in that sacrifice. He who giveth without stint food to a  fatigued wayfarer never seen before, obtaineth merit that is great, and  he who leading a domestic life, followeth such practices, acquireth  religious merit that is said to be very great. O Brahmana, what is thy  opinion on this?'        [1] This seems to be the obvious. There is a different reading      however. For _Drie-cyate_--seen, some texts have      _Sasyate_--applauded. Nilakantha imagines that the meaning is      \"As distribution (of food) amongst the various classes of beings      like the gods, the _Pitris_, &c., is applauded &c., &c.\"        [2] A form of sacrifice which consists in pouring oblations of      clarified butter with prayers into a blazing fire. It is      obligatory on Brahmanas and Kshatriyas, except those that accept      certain vows of great austerity.        [3] The Viswedeva sacrifice is the offer of food to all      creatures of the earth (by scattering a portion).        [4] A gift. It may be of various kinds. The fees paid to      Brahmanas assisting at sacrifices and religious rites, such as      offering oblations to the dead, are _Dakshinas_, as also gifts      to Brahmanas on other occasions particularly when they are fed,      it being to this day the custom never to feed a Brahmana without      paying him a pecuniary fee. There can be no sacrifice, no      religious rite, "]]]
