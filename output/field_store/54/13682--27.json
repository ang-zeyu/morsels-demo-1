[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14375"],[0,"The Adventures of Grandfather Frog (#2)"],[1,"     III    LONGLEGS VISITS THE SMILING POOL      Longlegs the Blue Heron watched Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter  disappear down the Laughing Brook. As long as they were in sight, he sat  without moving, his head drawn down between his shoulders just as if he  had nothing more important to think about than a morning nap. But if you  had been near enough to have seen his keen eyes, you would never have  suspected him of even thinking of a nap. Just as soon as he felt sure  that the two little brown-coated scamps were out of sight, he stretched  his long neck up until he was almost twice as tall as he had been a  minute before. He looked this way and that way to make sure that no  danger was near, spread his great wings, flapped heavily up into the  air, and then, with his head once more tucked back between his shoulders  and his long legs straight out behind him, he flew out over the Green  Meadows, and making a big circle, headed straight for the Smiling Pool.    All this time Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter had not been so far away  as Longlegs supposed. They had been hiding where they could watch him,  and the instant he spread his wings, they started back up the Laughing  Brook towards the Smiling Pool to see what would happen there. You see  they knew perfectly well that Longlegs was flying up to the Smiling Pool  in the hope that he could catch Grandfather Frog for his breakfast. They  didn't really mean that any harm should come to Grandfather Frog, but  they meant that he should have a great fright. You see, they were like a  great many other people, so heedless and thoughtless that they thought  it fun to frighten others.    \"Of course we'll waken Grandfather Frog in time for him to get away with  nothing more than a great scare,\" said Little Joe Otter, as they hurried  along. \"It will be such fun to see his big goggly eyes pop out when he  opens them and sees Longlegs just ready to gobble him up! And won't  Longlegs be hopping mad when we cheat him out of the breakfast he is so  sure he is going to have!\"    They reached the Smiling Pool before Longlegs, who had taken a  roundabout way, and they hid among the bulrushes where they could see  and not be seen.    \"There's the old fellow just as I left him, fast asleep,\" whispered  Billy Mink.    Sure enough, there on his big green lily-pad sat Grandfather Frog with  his eyes shut. At least, they seemed to be shut. And over on top of his  big house sat Jerry Muskrat. Jerry seemed to be too busy opening a  fresh-water clam to notice anything else; but the truth is he was  watching all that was going on. You see, he had suspected that Billy  Mink was going to play some trick on Grandfather Frog, so he had warned  him. When he had seen Longlegs coming towards the Smiling Pool, he had  given Grandfather Frog another warning, and he knew that now he was only  pretending to be asleep.    Straight up to the Smiling Pool came Longlegs the Blue Heron, and on the  very edge of it, among the bulrushes, he dropped his long legs and stood  with his toes in the water, his long neck stretched up so that he could  look all over the Smiling Pool. There, just as Little Joe Otter had  said, sat Grandfather Frog on his big green lily-pad, fast asleep. At  least, he seemed to be fast asleep. The eyes of Longlegs sparkled with  hunger and the thought of what a splendid breakfast Grandfather Frog  would make. Very slowly, putting each foot down as carefully as he knew  how, Longlegs began to walk along the shore so as to get opposite the  big green lily-pad where Grandfather Frog was sitting. And over in the  bulrushes on the other side, Little Joe Otter and Billy Mink nudged each  other and clapped their hands over their mouths to keep from laughing  aloud.          IV    THE PATIENCE OF LONGLEGS THE BLUE HERON      Patience often wins the day    When over-haste has lost the way.      If there is one virtue which Longlegs the Heron possesses above another  it is patience. Yes, Sir, Longlegs certainly has got patience. He  believes that if a thing is worth having, it is worth waiting for, and  that if he waits long enough, he is sure to get it. Perhaps that is  because he has been a fisherman all his life, and his father and his  grandfather were fishermen. You know a fisherman without patience rarely  catches anything. Of course Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter laugh at  this and say that it isn't so, but the truth is they sometimes go  hungry when they wouldn't if they had a little of the patience of  Longlegs.    Now Grandfather Frog is another who is very, very patient. He can sit  still the longest time waiting for something to come to him. Indeed, he  can sit perfectly still so long, and Longlegs can stand perfectly still  so long, that Jerry Muskrat and Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter have had  many long disputes as to which of the two can keep still the longest.    \"He will make a splendid breakfast,\" thought Longlegs, as very, very  carefully he walked along the edge of the Smiling Pool so as to get  right opposite Grandfather Frog. There he stopped and looked very hard  at Grandfather Frog. Yes, he certainly must be asleep, for his eyes were  closed. Longlegs chuckled to himself right down inside without making a  sound, and got ready to wade out so as to get within reach.    Now all the time Grandfather Frog was doing some quiet chuckling  himself. You see, he wasn't asleep at all. He was just pretending to be  asleep, and all the time he was watching Longlegs out of a corner of one  of his big goggly eyes. Very, very slowly and carefully, so as not to  make the teeniest, weeniest sound, Longlegs lifted one foot to wade out  into the Smiling Pool. Grandfather Frog pretended to yawn and opened his  big goggly eyes. Longlegs stood on one foot without moving so much as a  feather. Grandfather Frog yawned again, nodded as if he were too sleepy  to keep awake, and half closed his eyes. Longlegs waited and waited.  Then, little by little, so slowly that if you had been there you would  hardly have seen him move, he drew his long neck down until his head  rested on his shoulders.    \"I guess I must wait until he falls sound asleep again,\" said Longlegs  to himself.    But Grandfather Frog didn't go to sleep. He would nod and nod and then,  just when Longlegs would make up his mind that this time he really was  asleep, open would pop Grandfather Frog's eyes. So all the long morning  Longlegs stood on one foot without moving, watching and waiting and  growing hungrier and hungrier, and all the long morning Grandfather Frog  sat on his big green lily-pad, pretending that he was oh, so sleepy, and  all the time having such a comfortable sun-bath and rest, for very early  he had had a good breakfast of foolish green flies.    Over in the bulrushes on the other side of the Smiling Pool two little  scamps in brown bathing suits waited and watched for the great fright  they had planned for Grandfather Frog, when they had sent Longlegs to  try to catch him. They were Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter. At first  they laughed to themselves and nudged each other at the thought of the  trick they had played. Then, as nothing happened, they began to grow  tired and uneasy. You see they do not possess patience. Finally they  gave up in disgust and stole away to find some more exciting sport.  Grandfather Frog saw them go and chuckled harder than ever to himself.          V    GRANDFATHER FROG JUMPS JUST IN TIME      Back and forth over the Green Meadows sailed Whitetail the Marsh Hawk.  Like Longlegs the Blue Heron, he was hungry. His sharp eyes peered down  among the grasses, looking for something to eat, but some good fairy  seemed to have warned the very little people who live there that  Whitetail was out hunting. Perhaps it was one of Old Mother West Wind's  children, the Merry Little Breezes. You know they are always flitting  about trying to do some one a good turn.      They love to dance and romp and play    From dawn to dusk the livelong day,    But more than this they love to find      A chance to do some favor kind.    Anyway, little Mr. Green Snake seemed to know that Whitetail was out  hunting and managed to keep out of sight. Danny Meadow Mouse wasn't to  be found. Only a few foolish grasshoppers rewarded his patient search,  and these only served to make him feel hungrier than ever. But old  Whitetail has a great deal of persistence, and in spite of his bad luck,  he kept at his hunting, back and forth, back and forth, until he had  been all over the Green Meadows. At last he made up his mind that he was  wasting time there.    \"I'll just have a look over at the Smiling Pool, and if there is nothing  there, I'll take a turn or two along the Big River,\" thought he and  straightway started for the Smiling Pool. Long before he reached it, his  keen eyes saw Longlegs the Blue Heron standing motionless on the edge of  it, and he knew by the looks of Longlegs that he was watching something  which he hoped to catch.    \"If it's a fish,\" thought Whitetail, \"it will do me no good, for I am no  fisherman. But if it's a Frog--well, Frogs are not as good eating as fat  Meadow Mice, but they are very filling.\"    With that he hurried a little faster, and then he saw what Longlegs was  watching so intently. It was, as you know, Grandfather Frog sitting on  his big green lily-pad. Old Whitetail gave a great sigh of satisfaction.  Grandfather Frog certainly would be very filling, very filling, indeed.    Now Longlegs the Blue Heron was so intently watching Grandfather Frog  that he saw nothing else, and Grandfather Frog was so busy watching  Longlegs that he quite forgot that there might be other dangers.  Besides, his back was toward old Whitetail. Of course Whitetail saw  this, and it made him almost chuckle aloud. Ever so many times he had  tried to catch Grandfather Frog, but always Grandfather Frog had seen  him long before he could get near him.    Now, with all his keen sight, old"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14378"],[0,"Five Years of Theosophy (#2)"],[1,"to make their senses perceive it.  We  will simply reply--\"get better instruments and keener senses, and  eventually you will.\"    All we have to say is that if you are anxious to drink of the \"Elixir of  Life,\" and live a thousand years or so, you must take our word for the  matter at present, and proceed on the assumption.  For esoteric science  does not give the faintest possible hope that the desired end will ever  be attained by any other way;  while modern, or so-called exact  science--laughs at it.    So, then, we have arrived at the point where we have determined--  literally, not metaphorically--to crack the outer shell known as the  mortal coil or body, and hatch out of it, clothed in our next.  This  \"next\" is not spiritual, but only a more ethereal form.  Having by a  long training and preparation adapted it for a life in this atmosphere,  during which time we have gradually made the outward shell to die off  through a certain process (hints of which will be found further on) we  have to prepare for this physiological transformation.    How are we to do it?  In the first place we have the actual, visible,  material body--Man, so called;  though, in fact, but his outer shell--to  deal with. Let us bear in mind that science teaches us that in about  every seven years we change skin as effectually as any serpent;  and  this so gradually and imperceptibly that, had not science after years of  unremitting study and observation assured us of it, no one would have  had the slightest suspicion of the fact.    We see, moreover, that in process of time any cut or lesion upon the  body, however deep, has a tendency to repair the loss and reunite;  a  piece of lost skin is very soon replaced by another. Hence, if a man,  partially flayed alive, may sometimes survive and be covered with a new  skin, so our astral, vital body--the fourth of the seven (having  attracted and assimilated to itself the second) and which is so much  more ethereal than the physical one--may be made to harden its particles  to the atmospheric changes.  The whole secret is to succeed in evolving  it out, and separating it from the visible;  and while its generally  invisible atoms proceed to concrete themselves into a compact mass, to  gradually get rid of the old particles of our visible frame so as to  make them die and disappear before the new set has had time to evolve  and replace them.  We can say no more.  The Magdalene is not the only  one who could be accused of having \"seven spirits\" in her, though men  who have a lesser number of spirits (what a misnomer that word!) in  them, are not few or exceptional;  they are the frequent failures of  nature--the incomplete men and women.*    -----------  * This is not to be taken as meaning that such persons are thoroughly  destitute of some one or several of the seven principles--a man born  without an arm has still its ethereal counterpart;  but that they are so  latent that they cannot be developed, and consequently are to be  considered as non-existing.--Ed. Theos.  ----------    Each of these has in turn to survive the preceding and more dense one,  and then die.  The exception is the sixth when absorbed into and blended  with the seventh.  The \"Phatu\" * of the old Hindu physiologist had a  dual meaning, the esoteric side of which corresponds with the Tibetan  \"Zung\" (seven principles of the body).    We Asiatics, have a proverb, probably handed down to us, and by the  Hindus repeated ignorantly as to its esoteric meaning.  It has been  known ever since the old Rishis mingled familiarly with the simple and  noble people they taught and led on.  The Devas had whispered into every  man's ear--Thou only--if thou wilt--art \"immortal.\"  Combine with this  the saying of a Western author that if any man could just realize for an  instant, that he had to die some day, he would die that instant.  The  Illuminated will perceive that between these two sayings, rightly  understood, stands revealed the whole secret of Longevity.  We only die  when our will ceases to be strong enough to make us live.  In the  majority of cases, death comes when the torture and vital exhaustion  accompanying a rapid change in our physical conditions becomes so  intense as to weaken, for one single instant, our \"clutch on life,\" or  the tenacity of the will to exist.  Till then, however severe may be the  disease, however sharp the pang, we are only sick or wounded, as the  case may be.    -----------  * Dhatu--the seven principal substances of the human body--chyle, flesh,  blood, fat, bones, marrow, semen.  -----------    This explains the cases of sudden deaths from joy, fright, pain, grief  or such other causes.  The sense of a life-task consummated, of the  worthlessness of one's existence, if strongly realized, produced death  as surely as poison or a rifle-bullet. On the other hand, a stern  determination to continue to live, has, in fact, carried many through  the crises of the most severe diseases, in perfect safety.    First, then, must be the determination--the Will--the conviction of  certainty, to survive and continue.*  Without that, all else is useless.  And to be efficient for the purpose, it must be, not only a passing  resolution of the moment, a single fierce desire of short duration, but  a settled and continued strain, as nearly as can be continued and  concentrated without one single moment's relaxation.  In a word, the  would-be \"Immortal\" must be on his watch night and day, guarding self  against-himself.  To live--to live--to live--must be his unswerving  resolve.  He must as little as possible allow himself to be turned aside  from it.  It may be said that this is the most concentrated form of  selfishness,--that it is utterly opposed to our Theosophic professions  of benevolence, and disinterestedness, and regard for the good of  humanity.  Well, viewed in a short-sighted way, it is so.  But to do  good, as in everything else, a man must have time and materials to work  with, and this is a necessary means to the acquirement of powers by  which infinitely more good can be done than without them.    ----------  * Col. Olcott has epigrammatically explained the creative or rather the  re-creative power of the Will, in his \"Buddhist Catechism.\"  He there  shows--of course, speaking on behalf of the Southern Buddhists--that  this Will to live, if not extinguished in the present life, leaps over  the chasm of bodily death, and recombines the Skandhas, or groups of  qualities that made up the individual into a new personality.  Man is,  therefore, reborn as the result of his own unsatisfied yearning for  objective existence.  Col. Olcott puts it in this way:    Q.  123.  What is that, in man, which gives him the impression of  having a permanent individuality?    A.  Tanha, or the unsatisfied desire for existence.  The being having  done that for which he must be rewarded or punished in future, and  having Tanha, will have a rebirth through the influence of Karma.    Q.  124.  ....What is it that is reborn?    A.  A new aggregation of Skandhas, or individuality, caused by the last  yearning of the dying person.    Q.  128. To what cause must we attribute the differences in the  combination of the Five Skandhas has which makes every individual  different from every other individual?    A.  To the Karma of the individual in the next preceding birth.    Q.  129.  What is the force or energy that is at work, under the  guidance of Karma, to produce the new being?    A.  Tanha--the \"Will to Live.\"  ----------    When these are once mastered, the opportunities to use them will arrive,  for there comes a moment when further watch and exertion are no longer  needed:--the moment when the turning-point is safely passed.  For the  present as we deal with aspirants and not with advanced chelas, in the  first stage a determined, dogged resolution, and an enlightened  concentration of self on self, are all that is absolutely necessary.  It  must not, however, be considered that the candidate is required to be  unhuman or brutal in his negligence of others.  Such a recklessly  selfish course would be as injurious to him as the contrary one of  expending his vital energy on the gratification of his physical desires.  All that is required from him is a purely negative attitude.  Until the  turning-point is reached, he must not \"lay out\" his energy in lavish or  fiery devotion to any cause, however noble, however \"good,\" however  elevated.*  Such, we can solemnly assure the reader, would bring its  reward in many ways--perhaps in another life, perhaps in this world, but  it would tend to shorten the existence it is desired to preserve, as  surely as self-indulgence and profligacy.  That is why very few of the  truly great men of the world (of course, the unprincipled adventurers  who have applied great powers to bad uses are out of the question)--the  martyrs, the heroes, the founders of religions, the liberators of  nations, the leaders of reforms--ever became members of the long-lived  \"Brotherhood of Adepts\" who were by some and for long years accused of  selfishness.  (And that is also why the Yogis, and the Fakirs of modern  India--most of whom are acting now but on the dead-letter tradition, are  required if they would be considered living up to the principles of  their profession--to appear entirely dead to every inward feeling or  emotion.) Notwithstanding the purity of their hearts, the greatness of  their aspirations, the disinterestedness of their self-sacrifice, they  could not live for they had missed the hour.    --------  * On page 151 of Mr. Sinnett's \"Occult World,\" the author's much abused,  and still more doubted correspondent assures him that none yet of his  \"degree are like the stern hero of Bulwer's\" Zanoni.... \"the heartless  morally dried up mummies some would fancy us to be\" and adds that few of  them \"would care to play the part in life of a desiccated pansy between  the leaves"]]]
