The whole task of the four famous swordsmen of Dumas is to  get the Queen's token that is in the hands of Buckingham in England, and  return with it to Paris in time for the great ball. It is one long race  with the Cardinal's guards who are at last left behind. It is the same  plot as Reynard the Fox, John Masefield's poem--Reynard successfully  eluding the huntsmen and the dogs. If that poem is ever put on in an Art  Museum film, it will have to be staged like one of AEsop's Fables, with a  _man_ acting the Fox, for the children's delight. And I earnestly urge  all who would understand the deeper significance of the \"chase-picture\"  or the \"Action Picture\" to give more thought to Masefield's poem than to  Fairbanks' marvellous acting in the school of the younger Salvini. The  Mood of the _intimate photoplay_, chapter three, still remains indicated  in the current films by the acting of Lillian Gish and Mary Pickford,  when they are not roused up by their directors to turn handsprings to  keep the people staring. Mary Pickford in particular has been stimulated  to be over-athletic, and in all her career she has been given just one  chance to be her more delicate self, and that was in the almost forgotten  film:--A Romance of the Redwoods. This is one of the serious commercial  attempts that should be revived and studied, in spite of its crudities of  plot, by our Art Museums. There is something of the grandeur of the  redwoods in it, in contrast to the sustained Botticelli grace of \"Our  Mary.\"    I am the one poet who has a right to claim for his muses Blanche Sweet,  Mary Pickford, and Mae Marsh. I am the one poet who wrote them songs when  they were Biograph heroines, before their names were put on the screen,  or the name of their director. Woman's clubs are always asking me for  bits of delicious gossip about myself to fill up literary essays. Now  there's a bit. There are two things to be said for those poems. First,  they were heartfelt. Second, any one could improve on them.    In the fourth chapter of book two I discourse elaborately and formally on  The Motion Picture of Fairy Splendor. And to this carefully balanced  technical discourse I would add the informal word, this New Year's Day,  that this type is best illustrated by such fairy-tales as have been most  ingratiatingly retold in the books of Padraic Colum, and dazzlingly  illustrated by Willy Pogany. The Colum-Pogany School of Thought is one  which the commercial producers have not yet condescended to illustrate in  celluloid, and it remains a special province for the Art Museum Film.  Fairy-tales need not be more than one-tenth of a reel long. Some of the  best fairy-tales in the whole history of man can be told in a breath.  And the best motion picture story for fifty years may turn out to be a  reel ten minutes long. Do not let the length of the commercial film  tyrannize over your mind, O young art museum photoplay director. Remember  the brevity of Lincoln's Gettysburg address....    And so my commentary, New Year's Day, 1922, proceeds, using for points of  more and more extensive departure the refrains and old catch-phrases of  books two and three.    Chapter V--The Picture of Crowd Splendor, being the type illustrated by  Griffith's Intolerance.    Chapter VI--The Picture of Patriotic Splendor, which was illustrated by  all the War Films, the one most recently approved and accepted by the  public being The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.    Chapter VII--The Picture of Religious Splendor, which has no examples,  that remain in the memory with any sharpness in 1922, except The Faith  Healer, founded on the play by William Vaughn Moody, the poet, with much  of the directing and scenario by Mrs. William Vaughn Moody, and a more  talked-of commercial film, The Miracle Man. But not until the religious  film is taken out of the commercial field, and allowed to develop  unhampered under the Church and the Art Museum, will the splendid  religious and ritualistic opportunity be realized.    Chapter VIII--Sculpture-in-Motion, being a continuation of the argument  of chapter two. The Photoplay of Action. Like the Action Film, this  aspect of composition is much better understood by the commercial people  than some other sides of the art. Some of the best of the William S. Hart  productions show appreciation of this quality by the director, the  photographer, and the public. Not only is the man but the horse allowed  to be moving bronze, and not mere cowboy pasteboard. Many of the pictures  of Charles Ray make the hero quite a bronze-looking sculpturesque person,  despite his yokel raiment.    Chapter IX--Painting-in-Motion, being a continuation on a higher terrace  of chapter three, The Intimate Photoplay. Charlie Chaplin has intimate  and painter's qualities in his acting, and he makes himself into a  painting or an etching in the midst of furious slapstick. But he has been  in no films that were themselves paintings. The argument of this chapter  has been carried much further in Freeburg's book, The Art of Photoplay  Making.    Chapter X--Furniture, Trappings, and Inventions in Motion, being a  continuation of the chapter on Fairy Splendor. In this field we find one  of the worst failures of the commercial films, and their utterly  unimaginative corporation promoters. Again I must refer them to such  fairy books as those of Padraic Colum, where neither sword nor wing nor  boat is found to move, except for a fairy reason.    I have just returned this very afternoon from a special showing of the  famous imported film, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Some of the earnest  spirits of the Denver Art Association, finding it was in storage in the  town, had it privately brought forth to study it with reference to its  bearing on their new policies. What influence it will have in that most  vital group, time will show.    Meanwhile it is a marvellous illustration of the meaning of this chapter  and the chapter on Fairy Splendor, though it is a diabolical not a  beneficent vitality that is given to inanimate things. The furniture,  trappings, and inventions are in motion to express the haunted mind, as  in Griffith's Avenging Conscience, described pages 121 through 132. The  two should be shown together in the same afternoon, in the Art Museum  study rooms. Caligari is undoubtedly the most important imported film  since that work of D'Annunzio, Cabiria, described pages 55 through 57.  But it is the opposite type of film. Cabiria is all out-doors and  splendor on the Mediterranean scale. In general, imported films do not  concern Americans, for we have now a vast range of technique. All we lack  is the sense to use it.    The cabinet of Caligari is indeed a cabinet, and the feeling of being in  a cell, and smothered by all the oppressions of a weary mind, does not  desert the spectator for a minute.    The play is more important, technically, than in its subject-matter and  mood. It proves in a hundred new ways the resources of the film in making  all the inanimate things which, on the spoken stage, cannot act at all,  the leading actors in the films. But they need not necessarily act to a  diabolical end. An angel could have as well been brought from the cabinet  as a murderous somnambulist, and every act of his could have been a work  of beneficence and health and healing. I could not help but think that  the ancient miracle play of the resurrection of Osiris could have been  acted out with similar simple means, with a mummy case and great  sarcophagus. The wings of Isis and Nephthys could have been spread over  the sky instead of the oppressive walls of the crooked city. Lights  instead of shadows could have been made actors and real hieroglyphic  inscriptions instead of scrawls.    As it was, the alleged insane man was more sensible than most motion  picture directors, for his scenery acted with him, and not according to  accident or silly formula. I make these points as an antidote to the  general description of this production by those who praise it.    They speak of the scenery as grotesque, strained, and experimental, and  the plot as sinister. But this does not get to the root of the matter.  There is rather the implication in most of the criticisms and praises  that the scenery is abstract. Quite the contrary is the case. Indoors  looks like indoors. Streets are always streets, roofs are always roofs.  The actors do not move about in a kind of crazy geometry as I was led to  believe. The scenery is oppressive, but sane, and the obsession is for  the most part expressed in the acting and plot. The fair looks like a  fair and the library looks like a library. There is nothing experimental  about any of the setting, nothing unconsidered or strained or  over-considered. It seems experimental because it is thrown into contrast  with extreme commercial formulas in the regular line of the \"movie  trade.\" But compare The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari with a book of Rackham or  Du Lac or Duerer, or Rembrandt's etchings, and Dr. Caligari is more  realistic. And Eggers insists the whole film is replete with suggestions  of the work of Pieter Breughel, the painter. Hundreds of indoor stories  will be along such lines, once the merely commercial motive is  eliminated, and the artist is set free. This film is an extraordinary  variation of the intimate, as expounded in chapter three. It is  drawing-in-motion, instead of painting-in-motion. Because it was drawing  instead of painting, literary-minded people stepped to the hasty  conclusion it was experimental. Half-tone effects are, for the most part,  eliminated. Line is dominant everywhere. It is the opposite of vast  conceptions like Theodora--which are architecture-in-motion. All the  architecture of the Caligari film seems pasteboard. The whole thing  happens in a cabinet.    It is the most overwhelming contrast to Griffith's Intolerance that could  be in any way imagined.

Somewhat more than eight years his senior, in respect to  experience of the world and training in the finer graces of life his  superior, she aided, encouraged, and loved him, well aware that his  feeling for her was, at the most, admiration and gratitude, and that the  intimate union and companionship which soon became for him an  indispensable solace could never lead to marriage.    In Hamburg Hebbel began the diary which, continued throughout his life,  is the most valuable source of information about him that we have, and  which, being the repository of his meditations as well as the record of  his experiences, is one of the most remarkable documents of the kind  ever composed. He wrote and published a number of poems, and began  several short stories. More significant, however, was the development  of his critical faculty, which found in the Scientific Society a free  field for exercise. Here, on the twenty-eighth of July, 1835, Hebbel  read a paper on Theodor Koerner and Heinrich von Kleist which, in spite  of a rather juvenile tone, shows a maturity of insight quite  unparalleled in the critical literature of that day. It is greatly to  Hebbel's credit, and was to his profit, as the sequel showed, that  against the opinion of his generation he could demonstrate the poetic  excellence of Kleist and could distinguish in Koerner between the heroic  patriot and the mediocre poet; for it was a dramatic masterpiece that  Hebbel analyzed in Kleist's _Prince of Hamburg_, and in this analysis he  formulated views that remained the canons of all his subsequent activity  as a playwright. The study of Kleist gave him for the drama the same  sort of illumination that Uhland had given him for lyric poetry.    Though Hebbel was unable to acquire in Hamburg a certificate of  preparedness for the university, he soon felt ready for university  studies, and after some difficulty persuaded his benefactors to give him  the balance of the fund that they had collected, and consent to his  going to Heidelberg. In March, 1836, he departed thither, with less than  eighty thalers in his pocket. He could be admitted only as a special  student; nevertheless, he was hospitably received by members of the  faculty of law, and attended their lectures. But the romantic scenery of  Heidelberg, and, the reading of Goethe and Shakespeare, whom he now for  the first time studied thoroughly, were more fruitful and suggestive to  him than jurisprudence, however much he was interested in \"cases\" as  examples of human experience. Such a \"case\" he treated in _Anna_, the  first short story with which he was satisfied, and which indeed is  worthy of his model in this _genre_, Kleist. Other narratives, and a few  poems, testify to a closer approach to nature and a less morbid attitude  toward life than had appeared in the earlier works. Hebbel was now  finishing his apprenticeship, wisely restraining the impulse to  dramatize until in the less exacting forms he had mastered the means of  expression. But everything pointed toward literature as a calling, and  before the year was out Hebbel resolved to migrate to Munich, still, to  be sure, a student, but from the moment of his arrival living there  under the name and title of _Literat_.    The journey to Munich Hebbel made afoot, leaving Heidelberg on September  12, 1836. He passed through Strassburg, and thought of Goethe as he  climbed the tower of the cathedral; he visited the Suabian poets at  Stuttgart and Tuebingen, and was deeply disappointed with the kindly but  undemonstrative Uhland; and he reached Munich on September the  twenty-ninth. Here he remained until March, 1839.    Hebbel's two and a half years in Munich, years of solitude, unheard-of  privation, illness, and battling against despair, came near to wearing  out the physical man, and were, through long-continued insufficient  nourishment, the cause of the disease to which he finally succumbed; but  they were also the finishing school of the personality that henceforth  unflinchingly faced the world and demanded to be heard. Hebbel provided  for his material needs partly by journalistic work, to which he was  ill-adapted, but chiefly through the limitless bounty of Elise  Lensing--for months at a time the only being with whom, and only by  correspondence, he had human intercourse. He heard the lectures of  Schelling and Goerres at the university; but, as at Heidelberg, he,  gained most by prodigious reading in literature, history; and  philosophy. His savage melancholy found relief in grimly humorous  narratives and gloomy poems. At the time of his greatest wretchedness he  conceived the plots of comedies, \"ridiculing something by the  representation of nothing.\" But we note that his reading now begins to  suggest to him innumerable subjects for tragedies, such as Napoleon,  Alexander the Great, Julian the Apostate, the Maid of Orleans, Judith  and Holofernes, Golo and Genoveva,--all of them characters the key to  whose destiny lay in their personalities, and in whom Hebbel saw the  destiny of mankind typified. Still more directly, however, the tragedy  of human life was brought home to him--not merely through his personal  struggle for existence, but through the death of Emil Rousseau, a dear  friend who had followed him from Heidelberg to Munich, the death of his  mother, for whose necessities he had of late been able to do but little,  and misfortune in the family of Anton Schwarz, a cabinet maker, with  whose daughter, Beppy, Hebbel had been on too intimate terms. Hebbel's  dramas _Judith_, _Genoveva_, and _Maria Magdalena_ all germinated during  these terrible years of the sojourn in Munich.    But the actual output of these years was not large. Attempts to publish  a volume of poems and a volume of short stories had failed.  Nevertheless, Hebbel was no longer an unknown quantity in the world of  letters when, in the early spring of 1839, he decided to return to  Hamburg. Hope of aid from Campe, Heine's publisher, and from Gutzkow,  the editor of a paper published by Campe, encouraged this decision. But  Hebbel was really going home, going back to Elise, after having  accomplished the purpose of his pilgrimage, even though for lack of  money he could not take with him a doctor's degree. He came as a man who  could do things for which the world gives a man a living. The return  journey, lasting from the eleventh to the thirty-first of March, 1839,  amid alternate freezing and thawing, was a tramp, than which only the  retreat from Moscow could have been more frightful; but Hebbel  accomplished it, more concerned for the little dog that accompanied him  than for his own sufferings. And it appeared that he had wisely chosen  to return; for he found opportunity for critical work in Gutzkow's  _Telegraph_, and Campe published the works which in rapid succession he  now completed: _Judith_ (1840), _Genoveva_ (1841), _The Diamond_ (1841;  printed in 1847), and _Poems_ (1842).    These publications won fame for Hebbel and yielded some immediate  pecuniary gain. But although he had reached the goal of his ambition in  having become a poet, and a dramatist whose first play had appeared on  the stage, he still lacked a settled occupation and a sure income.  Having been born a Danish subject, he conceived the idea of a direct  appeal to Christian VIII. of Denmark for such an appointment as the king  might be persuaded to give him. In spite of the unacademic course of his  studies and his lack of strictly professional training, he thought of a  professorship of esthetics at Kiel. Even in those days, when  professorships could be had on easier terms than now, this was a wild  dream. But Hebbel did not appeal to his sovereign in vain. He spent the  winter of 1842-43 in Copenhagen, where the Danish-German dramatist  Oehlenschlaeger smoothed his path to royal favor; and after two audiences  with Christian VIII. he was granted a pension of six hundred thalers a  year for two years, in order that by traveling he might learn more of  the world and cultivate his poetic talents. His first expression of  gratitude for this privilege was the tragedy _Maria Magdalena_, begun at  Hamburg in May, finished at Paris in December, 1843, and dedicated to  the king.    Hebbel's departure for Paris, in September, 1843, did not mean for him  what Heine's settlement there twelve years before had meant for  Heine--the beginning of a new life. Hebbel's knowledge of French was  very imperfect, and he was as much isolated in Paris as he had been in  Munich; he did not seek stimulus from without so much as freedom to  develop the ideas that were teeming in his mind. When he left Hamburg,  however, he was destined never to return thither except as a visitor,  and started on the long, roundabout way to an unforeseen new home in  Vienna. He had been but little over a month in Paris when he learned of  the death of the little son that Elise had borne him three years before.  He was deeply grieved both for himself and for the despairing mother, to  whom he offered all the comfort he could give, not excepting marriage,  as soon as he should ever be able to provide for her. In May, 1844,  Elise bore him another son who, dying in 1847, was never seen by his  father. Hebbel did not forget what he owed to the mother of his  children, but he felt the debt more and more as an obligation, in the  fulfilment of which there was no prospect of satisfaction to either.  Despite the fact that she had a hundred times declared to him that he  was free, all her dreaming and planning tended solely to keep him bound.  He, who had been her pupil, had now far outgrown her capacity to  understand his endeavors and achievements; and he felt that he could  sacrifice much for her, but not himself, his personality, and his  mission.
