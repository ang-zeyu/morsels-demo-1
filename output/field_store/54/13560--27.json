By external force is meant  any force outside of a given piece of material which tends to  deform it in any manner. It is largely such properties that  determine the use of wood for structural and building purposes  and innumerable other uses of which furniture, vehicles,  implements, and tool handles are a few common examples.    Knowledge of these properties is obtained through  experimentation either in the employment of the wood in practice  or by means of special testing apparatus in the laboratory.  Owing to the wide range of variation in wood it is necessary  that a great number of tests be made and that so far as possible  all disturbing factors be eliminated. For comparison of  different kinds or sizes a standard method of testing is  necessary and the values must be expressed in some defined  units. For these reasons laboratory experiments if properly  conducted have many advantages over any other method.    One object of such investigation is to find unit values for  strength and stiffness, etc. These, because of the complex  structure of wood, cannot have a constant value which will be  exactly repeated in each test, even though no error be made. The  most that can be accomplished is to find average values, the  amount of variation above and below, and the laws which govern  the variation. On account of the great variability in strength  of different specimens of wood even from the same stick and  appearing to be alike, it is important to eliminate as far as  possible all extraneous factors liable to influence the results  of the tests.    The mechanical properties of wood considered in this book are:  (1) stiffness and elasticity, (2) tensile strength, (3)  compressive or crushing strength, (4) shearing strength, (5)  transverse or bending strength, (6) toughness, (7) hardness, (8)  cleavability, (9) resilience. In connection with these,  associated properties of importance are briefly treated.    In making use of figures indicating the strength or other  mechanical properties of wood for the purpose of comparing the  relative merits of different species, the fact should be borne  in mind that there is a considerable range in variability of  each individual material and that small differences, such as a  few hundred pounds in values of 10,000 pounds, cannot be  considered as a criterion of the quality of the timber. In  testing material of the same kind and grade, differences of 25  per cent between individual specimens may be expected in  conifers and 50 per cent or even more in hardwoods. The figures  given in the tables should be taken as indications rather than  fixed values, and as applicable to a large number collectively  and not to individual pieces.        FUNDAMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS AND DEFINITIONS      Study of the mechanical properties of a material is concerned  mostly with its behavior in relation to stresses and strains,  and the factors affecting this behavior. A ~stress~ is a  distributed force and may be defined as the mutual action (1) of  one body upon another, or (2) of one part of a body upon another  part. In the first case the stress is _external_; in the other  _internal_. The same stress may be internal from one point of  view and external from another. An external force is always  balanced by the internal stresses when the body is in  equilibrium.    If no external forces act upon a body its particles assume  certain relative positions, and it has what is called its  _natural shape and size_. If sufficient external force is  applied the natural shape and size will be changed. This  distortion or deformation of the material is known as the  ~strain~. Every stress produces a corresponding strain, and  within a certain limit (see _elastic limit_, in FUNDAMENTAL  CONSIDERATIONS AND DEFINITIONS, above) the strain is directly  proportional to the stress producing it.[1] The same intensity  of stress, however, does not produce the same strain in  different materials or in different qualities of the same  material. No strain would be produced in a perfectly rigid body,  but such is not known to exist.    [Footnote 1: This is in accordance with the discovery made in  1678 by Robert Hooke, and is known as _Hooke's law_.]    Stress is measured in pounds (or other unit of weight or force).  A ~unit stress~ is the stress on a unit of the sectional        {                P  }  area. { Unit stress = --- } For instance, if a load (P) of one        {                A  }  hundred pounds is uniformly supported by a vertical post with a  cross-sectional area (A) of ten square inches, the unit  compressive stress is ten pounds per square inch.    Strain is measured in inches (or other linear unit). A ~unit  strain~ is the strain per unit of length. Thus if a post 10  inches long before compression is 9.9 inches long under the  compressive stress, the total strain is 0.1 inch, and the unit             l     0.1  strain is --- = ----- = 0.01 inch per inch of length.             L     10    As the stress increases there is a corresponding increase in the  strain. This ratio may be graphically shown by means of a  diagram or curve plotted with the increments of load or stress  as ordinates and the increments of strain as abscissae. This is  known as the ~stress-strain diagram~. Within the limit mentioned  above the diagram is a straight line. (See Fig. 1.) If the  results of similar experiments on different specimens are  plotted to the same scales, the diagrams furnish a ready means  for comparison. The greater the resistance a material offers to  deformation the steeper or nearer the vertical axis will be the  line.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Stress-strain diagrams of two longleaf  pine beams. E.L. = elastic limit. The areas of the triangles  0(EL)A and 0(EL)B represent the elastic resilience of the dry  and green beams, respectively.]    There are three kinds of internal stresses, namely, (1)  ~tensile~, (2) ~compressive~, and (3) ~shearing~. When external  forces act upon a bar in a direction away from its ends or a  direct pull, the stress is a tensile stress; when toward the  ends or a direct push, compressive stress. In the first instance  the strain is an _elongation_; in the second a _shortening_.  Whenever the forces tend to cause one portion of the material to  slide upon another adjacent to it the action is called a  _shear_. The action is that of an ordinary pair of shears. When  riveted plates slide on each other the rivets are sheared off.

OBSERVATIONS FOR THE USE OF THE COOK.      The receipts we have given are capable of being varied and modified by  an intelligent pains-taking cook, to suit the tastes of her employers.    Where _one_ receipt has been thought sufficient to convey the  necessary instruction for several dishes, &c., &c., it has not been  repeated for each respectively, which plan will tend to facilitate her  task.    We might, had we been inclined, have increased our collection  considerably by so doing, but have decided, from our own experience,  that it is preferable to give a limited number clearly and fully  explained, as these will always serve as guides and models for others  of the same kind.    The cook must remember it is not enough to have ascertained the  ingredients and quantities requisite, but great care and attention  must be paid to the manner of mixing them, and in watching their  progress when mixed and submitted to the fire.    The management of the oven and the fire deserve attention, and cannot  be regulated properly without practice and observation.    The art of seasoning is difficult and important.    Great judgment is required in blending the different spices or other  condiments, so that a fine flavour is produced without the undue  preponderance of either.    It is only in coarse cooking that the flavour of onions, pepper,  garlic, nutmeg, and eschalot is permitted to prevail. As a general  rule, salt should be used in moderation.    Sugar is an improvement in nearly all soups, sauces, and gravies; also  with stewed vegetables, but of course must be used with discretion.    Ketchups, Soy, Harvey's sauce, &c., are used too indiscrimately by  inferior cooks; it is better to leave them to be added at table by  those who approve of their flavour.    Any thing that is required to be warmed up a second time, should be  set in a basin placed in a _bain-marie_, or saucepan, filled with  boiling water, but which must not be allowed to boil; or the article  will become hardened and the sauce dried up.    To remove every particle of fat from the gravies of stews, &c., a  piece of white blotting-paper should be laid on the surface, and the  fat will adhere to it; this should be repeated two or three times.    It is important to keep saucepans well skimmed; the best prepared dish  will be spoiled by neglect on this point.    The difference between good and bad cookery is particularly  discernible in the preparation of forcemeats. A common cook is  satistified if she chops or minces the ingredients and moistens them  with an egg scarcely beaten, but this is a very crude and imperfect  method; they should be pounded together in a mortar until not a lump  or fibre is perceptible. Further directions will be given in the  proper place, but this is a rule which must be strictly attended to by  those who wish to attain any excellence in this branch of their art.    Eggs for forcemeats, and for every description of sweet dishes, should  be thoroughly beaten, and for the finer kinds should be passed through  a sieve.    A trustworthy zealous servant must keep in mind, that waste and  extravagance are no proofs of skill. On the contrary, GOOD COOKERY  is by no means expensive, as it makes the most of every thing, and  furnishes out of simple and economical materials, dishes which are at  once palatable and elegant.          CHAPTER I.      Soups.    STOCK OR CONSOMME.    This is the basis of all kinds of soup and sauces. Shin of beef or  ox-cheek make excellent stock, although good gravy-beef is sometimes  preferred; the bones should always be broken, and the meat cut up, as  the juices are better extracted; it is advisable to put on, at first,  but very little water, and to add more when the first quantity is  nearly dried up. The time required for boiling depends upon the  quantity of meat; six pounds of meat will take about five hours; if  bones, the same quantity will require double the time.    Gravy beef with a knuckle of veal makes a fine and nutritious stock;  the stock for white soups should be prepared with veal or white  poultry. Very tolerable stock can be procured without purchasing meat  expressly for the purpose, by boiling down bones and the trimmings of  meat or poultry.    The liquor in which beef or mutton intended for the table has been  boiled, will also, with small additions and skilful flavoring, make an  excellent soup at a trifling expense.    To thicken soups, mix a little potatoe-flour, ground rice, or pounded  vermicelli, in a little water, till perfectly smooth; add a little of  the soup to it in a cup, until sufficiently thin, then pour it into  the rest and boil it up, to prevent the raw taste it would otherwise  have; the presence of the above ingredients should not be discovered,  and judgment and care are therefore requisite.    If colouring is necessary, a crust of bread stewed in the stock will  give a fine brown, or the common browning may be used; it is made in  the following manner:    Put one pound of coarse brown sugar in a stew-pan with a lump of  clarified suet; when it begins to froth, pour in a wine-glass of port  wine, half an ounce of black pepper, a little mace, four spoonsful  of ketchup or Harvey's sauce, a little salt, and the peel of a lemon  grated; boil all together, let it grow cold, when it must be skimmed  and bottled for use.    It may also be prepared as required, by putting a small piece of  clarified fat with one ounce of coarse sugar, in an iron spoon,  melting them together, and stirring in a little ketchup and pepper.    When good stock or consomme is prepared, it is very easy to form it  into any kind of soup or sauce that may be required.           *       *       *       *       *    GRAVY SOUP.    Take about three quarts of any strong stock, seasoned with a bunch of  sweet herbs, a carrot, turnip, and a head of celery, which must not  be served in the soup. Vermicelli, maccaroni, or thin slices of carrot  and small sippets of fried bread cut in fancy shapes, are usually  served in this soup.           *       *       *       *       *    MOCK TURTLE.    Half boil a well-cleaned calf's head, then cut off all the meat in  small square pieces, and break the bones; return it to the stew-pan,  with some good stock made of beef and veal; dredge in flour, add fried  shalot, pepper, parsley, tarragon, a little mushroom ketchup, and a  pint of white wine; simmer gently until the meat is perfectly soft and  tender. Balls of force-meat, and egg-balls, should be put in a  short time before serving; the juice of a lemon is considered an  improvement.           *       *       *       *       *    MULIGATAWNY SOUP.    Take two chickens, cut them up small, as if for fricassee, flour  them well, put them in a saucepan with four onions shred, a piece of  clarified fat, pepper, salt, and two table spoonsful of curry powder;  let it simmer for an hour, then add three quarts of strong beef gravy,  and let it continue simmering for another hour; before sent to table  the juice of a lemon should be stirred in it; some persons approve of  a little rice being boiled with the stock, and a pinch of saffron is  also sometimes added.           *       *       *       *       *    ENGLISH MULIGATAWNY.    Take a knuckle of veal, stew it till half done, then cut off the  greatest part of the meat, and continue to stew down the bone in  the stock, the meat must be cut into small pieces and fried with six  onions thinly sliced, and a table spoonful of curry powder, a desert  spoonful of cayenne pepper and salt, add the stock and let the whole  gently simmer for nearly an hour, flavouring it with a little Harvey's  sauce and lemon pickle.           *       *       *       *       *    SOUP A LA JULIENNE.    Take a variety of vegetables: such as celery, carrots, turnips, leeks,  cauliflower, lettuce, and onions, cut them in shreds of small size,  place them in a stew-pan with a little fine salad oil, stew them  gently over the fire, adding weak broth from time to time; toast a  few slices of bread and cut them into pieces the size and shape of  shillings and crowns, soak them in the remainder of the broth, and  when the vegetables are well done add all together and let it simmer  for a few minutes; a lump of white sugar, with pepper and salt are  sufficient seasoning.           *       *       *       *       *    SOUPE A LA TURQUE.    Make a good gravy from shin of beef, and cut up very small various  sorts of vegetables of whatever may be in season, add spices, pepper,  and salt; when it is all stewed well down together, set it to cool and  take off the fat, then place it again on the fire to boil, and add to  two quarts of soup, one quarter of a pound of rice, beat two yolks of  eggs with a little of the stock, and when the rice is quite tender,  stir them into the soup, taking the precaution not to let the soup  boil, and to stir always the same way.           *       *       *       *       *    PEPPER POT.    Cut small pieces of any vegetables, and add pieces of smoked or salt  beef, and also of any cold poultry, roast beef or mutton, stew all  these together in two or three quarts of water, according to the  quantity of meat, &c. It must be seasoned highly with whole peppers,  allspice, mace, Jamaica pickles, and salt; it must be thoroughly  stewed, and served, without straining, in a tureen.           *   "]]]
