His remaining important  work is _Tiberius_ (1894), a striking drama in which a new view of the  character of the Emperor is presented. He _d._ by his own hand at  Alexandria in a fit of depression caused by hopeless illness.      ADDISON, JOSEPH (1672-1719).--Poet, essayist and statesman, was the _s._  of Lancelot Addison, Dean of Lichfield. _B._ near Amesbury, Wilts., A.  went to the Charterhouse where he made the acquaintance of Steele  (_q.v._), and then at the age of fifteen to Oxford where he had a  distinguished career, being specially noted for his Latin verse. Intended  at first for the Church, various circumstances combined to lead him  towards literature and politics. His first attempts in English verse took  the form of complimentary addresses, and were so successful as to obtain  for him the friendship and interest of Dryden, and of Lord Somers, by  whose means he received, in 1699, a pension of L300 to enable him to  travel on the continent with a view to diplomatic employment. He visited  Italy, whence he addressed his _Epistle_ to his friend Halifax. Hearing  of the death of William III., an event which lost him his pension, he  returned to England in the end of 1703. For a short time his  circumstances were somewhat straitened, but the battle of Blenheim in  1704 gave him a fresh opportunity of distinguishing himself. The  government wished the event commemorated by a poem; A. was commissioned  to write this, and produced _The Campaign_, which gave such satisfaction  that he was forthwith appointed a Commissioner of Appeals. His next  literary venture was an account of his travels in Italy, which was  followed by the opera of _Rosamund_. In 1705, the Whigs having obtained  the ascendency, A. was made Under-Secretary of State and accompanied  Halifax on a mission to Hanover, and in 1708 was appointed Chief  Secretary for Ireland and Keeper of the Records of that country. It was  at this period that A. found his true vocation and laid the foundations  of his real fame. In 1709 Steele began to bring out the _Tatler_, to  which A. became almost immediately a contributor: thereafter he (with  Steele) started the _Spectator_, the first number of which appeared on  March 1, 1711. This paper, which at first appeared daily, was kept up  (with a break of about a year and a half when the _Guardian_ took its  place) until Dec. 20, 1714. In 1713 the drama of _Cato_ appeared, and was  received with acclamation by both Whigs and Tories, and was followed by  the comedy of the _Drummer_. His last undertaking was _The Freeholder_, a  party paper (1715-16). The later events in the life of A., viz., his  marriage in 1716 to the Dowager Countess of Warwick, to whose son he had  been tutor and his promotion to be Secretary of State did not contribute  to his happiness. His wife appears to have been arrogant and imperious;  his step-son the Earl was a rake and unfriendly to him; while in his  public capacity his invincible shyness made him of little use in  Parliament. He resigned his office in 1718, and, after a period of  ill-health, _d._ at Holland House, June 17, 1719, in his 48th year.  Besides the works above mentioned, he wrote a _Dialogue on Medals_, and  left unfinished a work on the Evidences of Christianity. The character of  A., if somewhat cool and unimpassioned, was pure, magnanimous, and kind.  The charm of his manners and conversation made him one of the most  popular and admired men of his day; and while he laid his friends under  obligations for substantial favours, he showed the greatest forbearance  towards his few enemies. His style in his essays is remarkable for its  ease, clearness, and grace, and for an inimitable and sunny humour which  never soils and never hurts. The motive power of these writings has been  called \"an enthusiasm for conduct.\" Their effect was to raise the whole  standard of manners and expression both in life and in literature. The  only flaw in his character was a tendency to convivial excess, which must  be judged in view of the laxer manners of his time. When allowance has  been made for this, he remains one of the most admirable characters and  writers in English literature.    SUMMARY.--_B._ Amesbury, _ed._ Charterhouse and Oxford; received  travelling pension, 1699; _Campaign_ (1704) leads to political office;  goes to Ireland, 1708; assists Steele in _Tatler_, 1709; _Spectator_  started, 1711; marries Lady Warwick, 1716; Secretary of State, 1716-18;  _d._ 1719.    Lives in _Biographica Britannica_, _Dict. of Nat. Biog._, _Johnson's  Lives of Poets_, and by Lucy Aikin, Macaulay's _Essay_, Drake's _Essays  Illustrative of Tatler, Guardian, and Spectator_; Pope's and Swift's  Correspondence, etc.    The best edition of the books is that in _Bohn's British Classics_ (6  vols., 1856); others are Tickell's (4 vols., 1721); _Baskerville_ edit.  (4 vols., 1761); Hurd's (6 vols., 1811); Greene's (1856); Dent's  _Spectator_ (1907).      ADOLPHUS, JOHN (1768-1845).--Historian, studied law and was called to the  Bar in 1807. He wrote _Biographical Memoirs of the French Revolution_  (1799) and _History of England from_ 1760-1783 (1802), and other  historical and biographical works.      AELFRED (849-901).--King of the West Saxons, and writer and translator,  _s._ of Ethelwulf, _b._ at Wantage. Besides being the deliverer of his  country from the ravages of the Danes, and the restorer of order and  civil government, _AE._ has earned the title of the father of English  prose writing. The earlier part of his life was filled with war and  action, most of the details regarding which are more or less legendary.  But no sooner had he become King of Wessex, in 871, than he began to  prepare for the work of re-introducing learning into his country.  Gathering round him the few scholars whom the Danes had left, and sending  for others from abroad, he endeavoured to form a literary class. His  chief helper in his great enterprise was Asser of St. David's, who taught  him Latin, and became his biographer in a \"life\" which remains the best  original authority for the period. Though not a literary artist, AE. had  the best qualities of the scholar, including an insatiable love alike for  the acquisition and the communication of knowledge. He translated several  of the best books then existing, not, however, in a slavish fashion, but  editing and adding from his own stores. In all his work his main desire  was the good of his people. Among the books he translated or edited were  (1) _The Handbook_, a collection of extracts on religious subjects; (2)  _The Cura Pastoralis_, or Herdsman's book of Gregory the Great, with a  preface by himself which is the first English prose; (3) _Bede's  Ecclesiastical History of the English_; (4) _The English Chronicle_,  which, already brought up to 855, he continued up to the date of writing;  it is probably by his own hand; (5) Orosius's _History of the World_,  which he adapted for English readers with many historical and  geographical additions; (6) the _De Consolatione Philosophiae_ of  Boethius; and (7) a translation of some of the Psalms. He also made a  collection of the best laws of his predecessors, Ethelbert, Ine, and  Offa. It has been said \"although King Alfred lived a thousand years ago,  a thousand years hence, if there be England then, his memory will yet be  precious to his country.\"      AELFRIC (955-_c._ 1022).--Called Grammaticus (10th century), sometimes  confounded with two other persons of the same name, AE. of Canterbury and  AE. of York, was a monk at Winchester, and afterwards Abbot of Cerne and  Eynsham successively. He has left works which shed an important light on  the doctrine and practice of the early Church in England, including two  books of homilies (990-94), a _Grammar_, _Glossary_, _Passiones Sanctorum_  (Sufferings of the Saints), translations of parts of the Bible with  omissions and interpolations, _Canones AElfrici_, and other theological  treatises. His writings had an influence on the formation of English  prose. He filled in his age somewhat the same position that Bede did in  his, that of a compiler and populariser of existing knowledge.      AGUILAR, GRACE (1816-1847).--Novelist and writer on Jewish history and  religion, was _b._ at Hackney of Jewish parents of Spanish descent. She  was delicate from childhood, and early showed great interest in history,  especially Jewish. The death of her _f._ threw her on her own resources.  After a few dramas and poems she _pub._ in America in 1842 _Spirit of  Judaism_, and in 1845 _The Jewish Faith_ and _The Women of Israel_. She  is, however, best known by her novels, of which the chief are _Home  Influence_ (1847) and _A Mother's Recompense_ (1850). Her health gave way  in 1847, and she _d._ in that year at Frankfort.      AIKIN, JOHN (1747-1822).--Miscellaneous writer, _s._ of Dr. John A.,  Unitarian divine, _b._ at Kibworth, studied medicine at Edinburgh and  London, and received degree of M.D. at Leyden. He began practice at  Yarmouth but, one of his pamphlets having given offence, he removed to  London, where he obtained some success in his profession, devoting all  his leisure to literature, to which his contributions were incessant.  These consisted of pamphlets, translations, and miscellaneous works, some  in conjunction with his sister, Mrs. Barbauld. Among his chief works are  _England Delineated_, _General Biography_ in 10 vols., and lives of Selden  and Ussher.      AIKIN, LUCY (1781-1864).--Historical and miscellaneous writer, _dau._ of  above and niece of Mrs. Barbauld (_q.v._). After _pub._ a poem,  _Epistles on Women_, and a novel, _Lorimer_, she began the historical  works on which her reputation chiefly rests, viz., _Memoirs of the Courts  of Elizabeth, James I., and Charles I._ (1818-33) and a _Life of  Addison_. She also wrote lives of her father and of Mrs. Barbauld. She  was remarkable for her conversational powers, and was also an "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13241"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#2)"],[1,"ets, which  disappeared like buttered crumpets; for I could resist neither giving  them away nor possessing them. When the master tormented me, when  I used to hate and loathe the sight of Homer, and Demosthenes, and  Cicero, I would comfort myself with thinking of the sixpence in my  pocket, with which I should go out to Paternoster Row, when school  was over, and buy another number of an English poet.           *       *       *       *       *    CHILDREN'S BOOKS: \"SANDFORD AND MERTON.\"--The children's books  in those days were Hogarth's pictures taken in their most literal  acceptation. Every good boy was to ride in his coach, and be a lord  mayor; and every bad boy was to be hung, or eaten by lions. The  gingerbread was gilt, and the books were gilt like the gingerbread:  a \"take in\" the more gross, inasmuch as nothing could be plainer  or less dazzling than the books of the same boys when they grew a  little older. There was a lingering old ballad or so in favor of the  gallanter apprentices who tore out lions' hearts and astonished gazing  sultans; and in antiquarian corners, Percy's \"Reliques\" were preparing  a nobler age, both in poetry and prose. But the first counteraction  came, as it ought, in the shape of a new book for children. The pool  of mercenary and time-serving ethics was first blown over by the fresh  country breeze of Mr. Day's \"Sandford and Merton,\" a production that  I well remember, and shall ever be grateful for. It came in aid of my  mother's perplexities, between delicacy and hardihood, between courage  and conscientiousness. It assisted the cheerfulness I inherited from  my father; showed me that circumstances were not to check a healthy  gaiety, or the most masculine self-respect; and helped to supply me  with the resolution of standing by a principle, not merely as a point  of lowly or lofty sacrifice, but as a matter of common sense and duty,  and a simple cooeperation with the elements natural warfare.           *       *       *       *       *    CHRIST'S HOSPITAL.--Perhaps there is not foundation in the country  so truly English, taking that word to mean what Englishmen wish it to  mean:--something solid, unpretending, of good character, and free to  all. More boys are to be found in it, who issue from a greater variety  of ranks, than in any other school in the kingdom and as it is the  most various, so it is the largest, of all the free schools. Nobility  do not go there except as boarders. Now and then a boy of a noble  family may be met with, and he is reckoned an interloper, and against  the charter; but the sons of poor gentry and London citizens abound;  and with them, an equal share is given to the sons of tradesmen of the  very humblest description, not omitting servants. I would not take  my oath, but I have a strong recollection that in my time there were  two boys, one of whom went up into the drawing-room to his father,  the master of the house; and the other, down into the kitchen to his  father, the coachman. One thing, however, I know to be certain, and it  is the noblest of all; namely, that the boys themselves (at least it  was so in my time) had no sort of feeling of the difference of one  another's ranks out of doors. The cleverest boy was the noblest, let  his father be who he might.           *       *       *       *       *    AN INTENSE YOUTHFUL FRIENDSHIP.--If I had reaped no other benefit  from Christ Hospital, the school would be ever dear to me from the  recollection of the friendships I formed in it, and of the first  heavenly taste it gave me of that most spiritual of the affections.  I use the word \"heavenly\" advisedly; and I call friendship the most  spiritual of the affections, because even one's kindred, in partaking  of our flesh and blood, become, in a manner, mixed up with our  entire being. Not that I would disparage any other form of affection,  worshiping, as I do, all forms of it, love in particular, which, in  its highest state, is friendship and something more. But if ever I  tasted a disembodied transport on earth, it was in those friendships  which I entertained at school, before I dreamt of any maturer feeling.  I shall never forget the impression it first made on me. I loved my  friend for his gentleness, his candor, his truth, his good repute,  his freedom even from my own livelier manner, his calm and reasonable  kindness. It was not any particular talent that attracted me to him  or anything striking whatsoever. I should say in one word, it was  his goodness. I doubt whether he ever had a conception of a tithe of  the regard and respect I entertained for him; and I smile to think  of the perplexity (though he never showed it) which he probably felt  sometimes at my enthusiastic expressions; for I thought him a kind of  angel. It is no exaggeration to say, that, take away the unspiritual  part of it--the genius and the knowledge--and there is no height of  conceit indulged in by the most romantic character in Shakspeare,  which surpassed what I felt toward the merits I ascribed to him, and  the delight which I took in his society. With the other boys I played  antics, and rioted in fantastic jests; but in his society, or whenever  I thought of him, I fell into a kind of Sabbath state of bliss; and I  am sure I could have died for him.           *       *       *       *       *    ANECDOTE OF MATHEWS.--One morning, after stopping all night at this  pleasant house, I was getting up to breakfast, when I heard the noise  of a little boy having his face washed. Our host was a merry bachelor,  and to the rosiness of a priest might, for aught I knew, have added  the paternity; but I had never heard of it, and still less expected  to find a child in his house. More obvious and obstreperous proofs,  however, of the existence of a boy with a dirty face, could not have  been met with. You heard the child crying and objecting; then the  woman remonstrating; then the cries of the child snubbed and swallowed  up in the hard towel; and at intervals out came his voice bubbling  and deploring, and was again swallowed up. At breakfast, the child  being pitied, I ventured to speak about it, and was laughing and  sympathizing in perfect good faith, when Mathews came in, and I found  that the little urchin was he.           *       *       *       *       *    SHELLEY'S GENEROSITY.--As an instance of Shelley's extraordinary  generosity, a friend of his, a man of letters, enjoyed from him  at that period a pension of a hundred a year, though he had but  a thousand of his own; and he continued to enjoy it till fortune  rendered it superfluous. But the princeliness of his disposition  was seen most in his behavior to another friend, the writer of this  memoir, who is proud to relate that, with money raised with an  effort, Shelley once made him a present of fourteen hundred pounds,  to extricate him from debt. I was not extricated, for I had not yet  learned to be careful; but the shame of not being so, after such  generosity, and the pain which my friend afterward underwent when  I was in trouble and he was helpless, were the first causes of my  thinking of money matters to any purpose. His last sixpence was ever  at my service, had I chosen to share it. In a poetical epistle  written some years after, and published in the volume of \"Posthumous  Poems,\" Shelley, in alluding to his friend's circumstances, which  for the second time were then straitened, only made an affectionate  lamentation that he himself was poor; never once hinting that he had  himself drained his purse for his friend.           *       *       *       *       *    MRS. JORDAN.--Mrs. Jordan was inimitable in exemplifying the  consequences of too much restraint in ill-educated country girls, in  romps, in hoydens, and in wards on whom the mercenary have designs.  She wore a bib and tucker, and pinafore, with a bouncing propriety,  fit to make the boldest spectator alarmed at the idea of bringing  such a household responsibility on his shoulders. To see her when  thus attired, shed blubbering tears for some disappointment, and eat  all the while a great thick slice of bread and butter, weeping, and  moaning, and munching, and eyeing at very bite the part she meant  to bite next, was a lesson against will and appetite worth a hundred  sermons, and no one could produce such an impression in favor of  amiableness as she did, when she acted in gentle, generous, and  confiding character. The way in which she would take a friend by  the cheek and kiss her, or make up a quarrel with a lover, or coax a  guardian into good humor, or sing (without accompaniment) the song  of, \"Since then I'm doom'd,\" or \"In the dead of the night,\" trusting,  as she had a right to do, and as the house wished her to do, to the  sole effect of her sweet, mellow, and loving voice--the reader will  pardon me, but tears of pleasure and regret come into my eyes at  the recollection, as if she personified whatsoever was happy at that  period of life, and which has gone like herself. The very sound of the  familiar word 'bud' from her lips (the abbreviation of husband,) as  she packed it closer, as it were, in the utterance, and pouted it up  with fondness in the man's face, taking him at the same time by the  chin, was a whole concentrated world of the power of loving.           *       *       *       *       *    RESIDENCE AT CHELSEA.--REMOTENESS IN NEARNESS.--From the noise and  dust of the New Road, my family removed to a corner in Chelsea where  the air of the neighboring river was so refreshing, and the quiet of  the \"no-thoroughfare\" so full of repose, that, although our fortunes  were at their worst, and my health almost of a piece with them, I  felt for some weeks as if I could sit still for ever, embalmed in  the silence. I got to like the very cries in the street for making  me the more aware of it for the contrast. I fancied they were unlike  the cries in other quarters of the suburbs, and that"]]]
