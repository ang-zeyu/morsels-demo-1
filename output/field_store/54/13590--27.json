However,  Jackson did, and stopped whirling the blades, turning about to see what  was wanted.    \"Why, it's Mr. Damon!\" exclaimed Tom, as he caught sight of the excited  man. \"Hello, what's the matter?\" the youth asked, pulling aside one  flap of his head-covering so he might hear the answer.    \"Tom! Wait a minute! Bless my mouse trap!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon, \"I want  to speak to you!\" He was panting from his run across the field. \"I just  got to your house--saw your father--he said you were going up with Miss  Nestor, but--bless my dog biscuit--\"    \"Can't stop now, Mr. Damon!\" answered Tom, with a laugh. \"I have only  just succeeded, by hard work, in getting Mary to a point where she has  consented to take a sky ride. If I stop now she'll back out and I'll  never get her in again. See you when I come back,\" and Tom pulled the  covering over his ear once more.    \"But, Tom, bless my shoe laces! This is important!\"    \"So's this!\" answered Tom, with a grin. He saw, by the motion of Mr.  Damon's lips, what the latter had said.    Around swung the propeller blades. The gasoline vapor in the cylinders  was being compressed.    \"Contact!\" called Tom sharply, as he pressed the switch to give the  igniting spark at the proper moment. The mechanic had stepped back out  of the way, in case there should be a premature starting of the  powerful engine, in which event the blades would have cut him to pieces.    \"Wait, Tom! Wait! This is very important! Bless my collar button, Tom  Swift, but this is--\"    Bang! Bang! Bang!    With a series of explosions, like those of a machine gun, the motor  started, and further talk was out of the question. Tom turned on more  gas. The propellers became almost invisible blades of light and shadow,  and the aeroplane began moving over the grassy field. The mechanic had  sprung out of the way, pulling Mr. Damon with him.    \"Come back! Come back! Wait a minute, Tom Swift! Bless my pansy  blossoms, I want to tell you something!\" cried the little man.    But Tom Swift was away and out of hearing. He had started on his sky  ride with Mary Nestor.          CHAPTER II    A NEW IDEA      Any one who has taken a flight in an aeroplane or gone up in a balloon,  will know exactly how Mary Nestor felt on this, her first sky ride of  any distance. For a moment, as she looked over the side of the machine,  she had a distinct impression, not that she was going up, but that some  one had pulled the earth down from beneath her and, at the same time,  given her a shove off into space. Such is the first sensation of going  aloft. Then the rush of air all about her, the slightly swaying motion  of the craft, and the vibration caused by the motor took her attention.  But the sensation of the earth dropping away from beneath her remained  with Mary for some time.    This sensation is much greater in a balloon than in an aeroplane, for a  balloon, unless there is a strong wind blowing, goes straight up, while  an aeroplane ascends on a long slant, and always into the teeth of the  wind, to take advantage of its lifting power on the underside of the  planes. The reason for this sensation--that of the earth's dropping  down, instead of one's feeling, what really happens, that one is  ascending--is because there are no objects by which comparison can be  made. If one starts off on the earth's surface at slow, or at great  speed, one passes stationary objects--houses, posts, trees, and the  like--and judges the speed by the rapidity with which these are left  behind.    Going up is unlike this. There is nothing to pass. One simply cleaves  the air, and only as it rushes past can one be sure of movement. And as  the air is void of color and form, there is no sensation of passing  anything.    So Mary Nestor, as she shot into the air with Tom Swift, had a  sensation as though the earth were dropping from beneath her. For a  moment she felt as though she were in some vast void--floating in  space--and she had a great fear. Then she calmed herself. She looked at  Tom sitting in front of her. Of course, all she could see was his back,  but it looked to be a very sturdy back, indeed, and he sat there in the  aircraft as calmly as though in a chair on the ground. Then Mary took  courage, and ceased to grasp the sides of the cockpit with a grip that  stiffened all her muscles.  She was beginning to \"find herself.\"    On and on, and up and up, went Mary and Tom, in this the girl's first  big sky ride. The earth below seemed farther and farther away. The  wide, green fields became little emerald squares, and the houses like  those in a toy Noah's ark.    Down below, Mr. Wakefield Damon, who had hurried over from his home in  Waterfield to see Tom Swift, gazed aloft at the fast disappearing  aeroplane and its passengers.    \"Bless my coal bin!\" cried the eccentric man, \"but Tom is in a hurry  this morning. Too bad he couldn't have stopped and spoken to me. It  might have been greatly to his advantage. But I suppose I shall have to  wait.\"    \"You want to see Master?\" asked a voice behind Mr. Damon, and, turning,  he beheld a veritable giant.    \"Yes, Koku, I did,\" Mr. Damon answered, and he did not appear at all  surprised at the sight of the towering form beside him. \"I wanted to  see Tom most particularly. But I shall have to wait.  I'll go in and  talk to Mr. Swift.\"    \"Yaas, an' I go talk to Radicate,\" said the giant. \"Him diggin' up  ground where Master told me to make garden. Radicate not strong enough  for dat!\"    \"Huh! there's trouble as soon as those two get to disputing,\" mused Mr.  Damon, as he went toward the house.    Meanwhile, Mary was beginning to enjoy herself. The sensation of moving  rapidly through the air in a machine as skillfully guided as was the  one piloted by Tom Swift was delightful. Up and up they went, and then  suddenly Mary felt a lurch, and the plane, which was now about a  thousand feet high, seemed to slip to one side.    Mary screamed, and began reaching for the buckle of the safety belt  that fastened her to her seat. She saw that something unusual had  occurred, for Tom was working frantically at the mechanism in front of  him.    But, in spite of this, he seemed aware that Mary was in danger, not so  much, perhaps, from what might happen to the machine, as what she might  do in her terror.    \"Oh! Oh!\" cried the girl, and Tom heard her above the terrific noise of  the motor, for she was speaking with her lips close to the tube that  served as a sort of inter-communicating telephone for the craft. \"Oh,  we are falling! I'm going to jump!\"    \"Sit still! Sit still for your life!\" cried Tom Swift. \"I'll save you  all right! Only sit still! Don't jump!\"    Mary, her red cheeks white, sank back, and the young inventor redoubled  his efforts at the controls and other mechanisms.    And that Tom was perfectly qualified to make a safe landing, even with  engine trouble, Mary Nestor well knew. Those of you who have read the  previous books of this series know it also, but, for the benefit of my  new readers, I shall state that this was by no means Tom's first ride  in an aeroplane.    He had operated and built gasoline engines ever since he was about  sixteen years old. As related in the initial volume of this series,  entitled, \"Tom Swift and His Motorcycle,\" he became possessed of this  machine after it had started to climb a tree with Mr. Damon on board.  After that experience the eccentric man--blessing everything he could  think of--had no liking for the speedy motorcycle and sold it to Tom at  a low price.    That was the beginning of a friendship between the two, and also  started Tom on his career as an inventor and a possessor of many  gasoline craft. For he was not content with merely riding the repaired  motorcycle. He made improvements on it.    Tom lived with his father in the town of Shopton, their home being  looked after, since the death of Mrs. Swift, by Mrs. Baggert. Mr.  Wakefield Damon lived in the neighboring town of Waterfield, and spent  much time at Tom's home, often going on trips with him in various  vehicles of the land, sea or air.    As related in the various volumes of this series, Tom was not content  to remain on earth. He built a speedy motor boat, and then secured an  airship, following that with a submarine. He also made an electric  runabout that was the speediest car on the road.  Sending wireless  messages, having thrilling experiences among the diamond makers,  journeying to the caves of ice, and making perilous trips in his sky  racer took up part of the young inventor's time.    With his electric rifle he did some wonderful shooting, and in the  \"City of Gold\" made some strange discoveries, part of the fortune he  secured enabling him to build his sky racer. It was in a land of giants  that Tom was made captive, but he succeeded in escaping, and brought  two giants, of whom Koku was one, away with him.    Following this achievement Tom invented a wizard camera and a great  searchlight, which, with his giant cannon, was purchased by the United  States Government. Work on his photo-telephone and his aerial warship,  the problem of digging a big tunnel, and then traveling to the land of  wonders, kept Tom Swift very busy, and he had just completed a  wonderful piece of work when the present story opens.    This last achievement was the perfecting of a machine to aid in the  great World War and you will find the details set down in the volume  which immediately precedes this. \"Tom Swift and His War Tank,\" it is  called, and in that is related how he not only invented a marvelous  machine, but succeeded in keeping its secret from the plotters who  tried to take it from him. In this Tom was helped by the inspiration of  Mary Nestor, whom he hoped some day to marry, and by Ned Newton, a  chum, who, though no inventor himself, could admire one.    Ned and Tom had been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12855"],[0,"Elizabethan Sea-Dogs: A Chronicle of Drake and His Companions (#2)"],[1,"after him like  mad.' The Spanish ambassador was full of suspicion, in spite of the fact  that Cabot had not gone south. Had not His Holiness divided all  Heathendom between the crowns of Spain and Portugal, to Spain the West  and to Portugal the East; and was not this landfall within what the  modern world would call the Spanish sphere of influence? The ambassador  protested to Henry VII and reported home to Ferdinand and Isabella.    Henry VII meanwhile sent a little present 'To Hym that founde the new  Isle--L10.' It was not very much. But it was about as much as nearly a  thousand dollars now; and it meant full recognition and approval. This  was a good start for a man who couldn't pay the King any royalty of  twenty per cent. because he hadn't made a penny on the way. Besides, it  was followed up by a royal annuity of twice the amount and by renewed  letters-patent for further voyages and discoveries in the west. So Cabot  took good fortune at the flood and went again.    This time there was the full authorized flotilla of five sail, of which  one turned back and four sailed on. Somewhere on the way John Cabot  disappeared from history and his second son, Sebastian, reigned in his  stead. Sebastian, like John, apparently wrote nothing whatever. But he  talked a great deal; and in after years he seems to have remembered a  good many things that never happened at all. Nevertheless he was a very  able man in several capacities and could teach a courtier or a  demagogue, as well as a geographer or exploiter of new claims, the art  of climbing over other people's backs, his father's and his brothers'  backs included. He had his troubles; for King Henry had pressed upon him  recruits from the gaols, which just then were full of rebels. But he had  enough seamen to manage the ships and plenty of cargo for trade with the  undiscovered natives.    Sebastian perhaps left some of his three hundred men to explore  Newfoundland. He knew they couldn't starve because, as he often used to  tell his gaping listeners, the waters thereabouts were so thick with  codfish that he had hard work to force his vessels through. This first  of American fish stories, wildly improbable as it may seem, may yet have  been founded on fact. When acres upon acres of the countless little  capelin swim inshore to feed, and they themselves are preyed on by  leaping acres of voracious cod, whose own rear ranks are being preyed on  by hungry seals, sharks, herring-hogs, or dogfish, then indeed the  troubled surface of a narrowing bay is literally thick with the silvery  flash of capelin, the dark tumultuous backs of cod, and the swirling  rushes of the greater beasts of prey behind. Nor were certain other fish  stories, told by Sebastian and his successors about the land of cod,  without some strange truths to build on. Cod have been caught as long as  a man and weighing over a hundred pounds. A whole hare, a big guillemot  with his beak and claws, a brace of duck so fresh that they must have  been swallowed alive, a rubber wading boot, and a very learned treatise  complete in three volumes--these are a few of the curiosities actually  found in sundry stomachs of the all-devouring cod.    The new-found cod banks were a mine of wealth for western Europe at a  time when everyone ate fish on fast days. They have remained so ever  since because the enormous increase of population has kept up a  constantly increasing demand for natural supplies of food. Basques and  English, Spaniards, French, and Portuguese, were presently fishing for  cod all round the waters of northeastern North America and were even  then beginning to raise questions of national rights that have only been  settled in this twentieth century after four hundred years.    Following the coast of Greenland past Cape Farewell, Sebastian Cabot  turned north to look for the nearest course to India and Cathay, the  lands of silks and spices, diamonds, rubies, pearls, and gold. John  Cabot had once been as far as Mecca or its neighborhood, where he had  seen the caravans that came across the Desert of Arabia from the fabled  East. Believing the proof that the world was round, he, like Columbus  and so many more, thought America was either the eastern limits of the  Old World or an archipelago between the extremest east and west already  known. Thus, in the early days before it was valued for itself, America  was commonly regarded as a mere obstruction to navigation--the more  solid the more exasperating. Now, in 1498, on his second voyage to  America, John Cabot must have been particularly anxious to get through  and show the King some better return for his money. But he simply  disappears; and all we know is what various writers gleaned from his son  Sebastian later on.    Sebastian said he coasted Greenland, through vast quantities of  midsummer ice, until he reached 67 deg. 30' north, where there was hardly  any night. Then he turned back and probably steered a southerly course  for Newfoundland, as he appears to have completely missed what would  have seemed to him the tempting way to Asia offered by Hudson Strait and  Bay. Passing Newfoundland, he stood on south as far as the Virginia  capes, perhaps down as far as Florida. A few natives were caught. But no  real trade was done. And when the explorers had reported progress to the  King the general opinion was that North America was nothing to boast of,  after all.    A generation later the French sent out several expeditions to sail  through North America and make discoveries by the way. Jacques Cartier's  second, made in 1535, was the greatest and most successful. He went up  the St. Lawrence as high as the site of Montreal, the head of ocean  navigation, where, a hundred and forty years later, the local wits  called La Salle's seigneury 'La Chine' in derision of his unquenchable  belief in a transcontinental connection with Cathay.    But that was under the wholly new conditions of the seventeenth century,  when both French and English expected to make something out of what are  now the United States and Canada. The point of the witling joke against  La Salle was a new version of the old adage: Go farther and fare worse.  The point of European opinion about America throughout the wonderful  sixteenth century was that those who did go farther north than Mexico  were certain to fare worse. And--whatever the cause--they generally did.  So there was yet a third reason why the fame of Columbus eclipsed the  fame of the Cabots even among those English-speaking peoples whose  New-World home the Cabots were the first to find. To begin with,  Columbus was the first of moderns to discover any spot in all America.  Secondly, while the Cabots gave no writings to the world, Columbus did.  He wrote for a mighty monarch and his fame was spread abroad by what we  should now call a monster publicity campaign. Thirdly, our present  point: the southern lands associated with Columbus and with Spain  yielded immense and most romantic profits during the most romantic  period of the sixteenth century. The northern lands connected with the  Cabots did nothing of the kind.    Priority, publicity, and romantic wealth all favored Columbus and the  south then as the memory of them does to-day. The four hundredth  anniversary of his discovery of an island in the Bahamas excited the  interest of the whole world and was celebrated with great enthusiasm in  the United States. The four hundredth anniversary of the Cabots'  discovery of North America excited no interest at all outside of Bristol  and Cape Breton and a few learned societies. Even contemporary Spain did  more for the Cabots than that. The Spanish ambassador in London  carefully collected every scrap of information and sent it home to his  king, who turned it over as material for Juan de la Cosa's famous map,  the first dated map of America known. This map, made in 1500 on a  bullock's hide, still occupies a place of honor in the Naval Museum at  Madrid; and there it stands as a contemporary geographic record to show  that St. George's Cross was the first flag ever raised over eastern  North America, at all events north of Cape Hatteras.    The Cabots did great things though they were not great men. John, as we  have seen already, sailed out of the ken of man in 1498 during his  second voyage. Sly Sebastian lived on and almost saw Elizabeth ascend  the throne in 1558. He had made many voyages and served many masters in  the meantime. In 1512 he entered the service of King Ferdinand of Spain  as a 'Captain of the Sea' with a handsome salary attached. Six years  later the Emperor Charles V made him 'Chief Pilot and Examiner of  Pilots.' Another six years and he is sitting as a nautical assessor to  find out the longitude of the Moluccas in order that the Pope may know  whether they fall within the Portuguese or Spanish hemisphere of  exploitation. Presently he goes on a four years' journey to South  America, is hindered by a mutiny, explores the River Plate (La Plata),  and returns in 1530, about the time of the voyage to Brazil of 'Master  William Haukins,' of which we shall hear later on.    In 1544 Sebastian made an excellent and celebrated map of the world  which gives a wonderfully good idea of the coasts of North America from  Labrador to Florida. This map, long given up for lost, and only  discovered three centuries after it had been finished, is now in the  National Library in Paris.[1]    [1: An excellent facsimile reproduction of it, together with a copy of  the marginal text, is in the collections of the American Geographical  Society of New York.]    Sebastian had passed his threescore years and ten before this famous  map appeared. But he was as active as ever twelve years later again. He  had left Spain for England in 1548, to the rage of Charles V, who  claimed him as a deserter, which he probably was. But the English  boy-king, Edward VI, gave him a pension, which was renewed by"]]]
