He paid his own way by publishing and selling  18,000 copies of a booklet titled \"The Mote and the Beam:  an Epic  on Sex-Relationship 'twixt Black and White in British South Africa\"  at 25 cents each.  In the following year, after Plaatje had left,  this new edition of \"Native Life in South Africa\" was published,  by the NAACP newspaper \"The Crisis\" edited by Du Bois.    Plaatje returned home to Kimberley to find the SANNC a spent force,  despite its name change to ANC, overtaken by more radical forces.  At a time when white power was pushing ahead with an ever more intense  segregationist programme, based on anti-black legislation,  Plaatje became a lone voice for old black liberalism.  He turned from politics  and devoted the rest of his life to literature.  His passion for Shakespeare  resulted in mellifluous Tswana translations of five plays  from \"Comedy of Errors\" to \"Merchant of Venice\" and \"Julius Caesar\".  His passion for the history of his people, and of his family in particular,  resulted in a historical novel, \"Mhudi (An Epic of South African Native Life  a Hundred Years Ago)\", dedicated to his daughter Olive who had died  in the influenza epidemic while Plaatje was overseas --  described in the dedication as \"one of the many victims of a settled system\".    \"Mhudi\" was published by the missionary press at Lovedale in 1930,  in a somewhat bowdlerized version.  It has since been republished  in more pristine form and is today considered not just the first  but one of the very best novels published by a black South African writer  in English.    Plaatje lived an extraordinary life but died a largely disappointed man.  His feats of political journalism had been largely forgotten  and his creative talents had hardly yet been recognised  -- except in the confined world of Tswana language readership.  But today Plaatje is regarded as a South African literary pioneer,  as a not insignificant political actor in his time,  and as a cogent commentator on his times.  He was an explorer  in a fascinating world of cultural and linguistic interaction,  who was in retrospect truly a \"renaissance man\".      Related Reading:    Sol T. Plaatje (ed.

After wondering for some time how best to answer this question,  we decided to reply to it by using one of several personal references  in our possession.  The next puzzle was:  \"Which one?\"  We carefully examined each, but could not strike a happy decision  until some one who entered the room happened to make use  of the familiar phrase:  \"The long and the short of it\".  That phrase solved the difficulty for us, and we at once made up our mind  to use two of these references, namely, the shortest and the longest.  The first one is from His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught,  and the second takes the form of a leading article in the `Pretoria News'.    ==                           Central South African Railways,                                     High Commissioner's Train.    On February 1, 1906, Mr. Sol Plaatje acted as Interpreter  when I visited the Barolong Native Stadt at Mafeking, and performed his duty  to my entire satisfaction.                             (Signed)  Arthur.  Mafeking,    February 1, 1906.  ==    ==  We commence to-day an experiment which will prove a success  if only we can persuade the more rabid negrophobes to adopt  a moderate and sensible attitude.  We publish the first of a series of letters  from a native correspondent of considerable education and ability,  his name is Solomon Tshekisho Plaatje.  Mr. Plaatje was born  in the district of Boshof, his parents being Barolongs,  coming originally from Thaba Ncho, and trekking eventually to Mafeking.  He attended the Lutheran Mission School at the Pniel Mission Station,  near Barkly West, as a boy, under the Rev. G. E. Westphal;  and at thirteen years he passed the fourth standard, which was as far  as the school could take him.  For the next three years he acted  as pupil-teacher, receiving private lessons from the Rev. and Mrs. Westphal.  At the age of sixteen he joined the Cape Government service as letter-carrier  in the Kimberley Post Office.  There he studied languages in his spare time,  and passed the Cape Civil Service examination in typewriting,  Dutch and native languages, heading the list of successful candidates  in each subject.  Shortly before the war he was transferred to Mafeking  as interpreter, and during the siege was appointed Dutch interpreter  to the Court of Summary Jurisdiction, presided over by Lord Edward Cecil.  The Magistrate's clerks having taken up arms, Mr. Plaatje became  confidential clerk to Mr. C. G. H. Bell, who administered Native affairs  during the siege.  Mr. Plaatje drew up weekly reports on the Native situation,  which were greatly valued by the military authorities,  and in a letter written to a friend asserted with some sense of humour  that \"this arrangement was so satisfactory that Mr. Bell was created a C.M.G.  at the end of the siege.\"    Had it not been for the colour bar, Mr. Plaatje, in all probability,  would have been holding an important position in the Department  of Native Affairs; as it was, he entered the ranks of journalism  as Editor, in the first place, of `Koranta ea Becoana', a weekly paper  in English and Sechuana, which was financed by the Chief Silas Molema  and existed for seven years very successfully.  At the present moment  Mr. Plaatje is Editor of the `Tsala ea Batho' (The People's Friend)  at Kimberley, which is owned by a native syndicate, having its headquarters  in the Free State.  Mr. Plaatje has acted as interpreter  for many distinguished visitors to South Africa, and holds autograph letters  from the Duke of Connaught, Mr. Chamberlain, and other notabilities.  He visited Mr. Abraham Fischer quite lately and obtained from him  a promise to introduce a Bill into Parliament ameliorating the position  of the Natives of the Orange River Colony, who are debarred by law  from receiving titles to landed property.  Mr. Plaatje's articles  on native affairs have been marked by the robust common sense and moderation  so characteristic of Mr. Booker Washington.  He realizes  the great debt which the Natives owe to the men who brought  civilization to South Africa.  He is no agitator or firebrand,  no stirrer-up of bad feeling between black and white.  He accepts  the position which the Natives occupy to-day in the body politic  as the natural result of their lack of education and civilization.  He is devoted to his own people, and notes with ever-increasing regret  the lack of understanding and knowledge of those people,  which is so palpable in the vast majority of the letters and leading articles  written on the native question."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14521"],[0,"Memories: A Story of German Love (#2)"],[1,"that one could have looked within,  and as I closed my eyes the light entered my soul and therein  everything seemed to shed brilliancy and perfume, to sing and to ring.  It seemed to me a new life had commenced in myself and that I was  another being, and when I asked my mother what it meant, she replied it  was an Easter song they were singing in the church.  What bright, holy  song it was, which at that time surged through my soul, I have never  been able to discover.  It must have been an old church hymn, like  those which many a time stirred the rugged soul of our Luther.  I never  heard it again, but many a time even now when I hear an adagio of  Beethoven's, or a psalm of Marcellus, or a chorus of Handel's, or a  simple song in the Scotch Highlands or the Tyrol, it seems to me as if  the lofty church windows again glistened and the organ-tones once more  surged through my soul, and a new world revealed itself--more beautiful  than the starry heavens and the violet perfume.    These things I remember in my earliest childhood, and intermingled with  them are my dear mother's looks, the calm, earnest gaze of my father,  gardens and vine leaves, and soft green turf, and a very old and quaint  picture-book--and this is all I can recall of the first scattered  leaves of my childhood.    Afterwards it grows brighter and clearer.  Names and faces appear--not  only father and mother, but brothers and sisters, friends and teachers,  and a multitude of _strange people_.  Ah! yes, of these _strange  people_ there is so much recorded in memory.          SECOND MEMORY.    Not far from our house, and opposite the old church with the golden  cross, stood a large building, even larger than the church, and having  many towers.  They looked exceedingly gray and old and had no golden  cross, but stone eagles tipped the summits and a great white and blue  banner fluttered from the highest tower, directly over the lofty  doorway at the top of the steps, where, on either side, two mounted  soldiers stood sentinels.  The building had many windows, and behind  the windows you could distinguish red-silk curtains with golden  tassels.  Old lindens encircled the grounds, which, in summer,  overshadowed the gray masonry with their green leaves and bestrewed the  turf with their fragrant white blossoms.  I had often looked in there,  and at evening when the lindens exhaled their perfumes and the windows  were illuminated, I saw many figures pass and repass like shadows.  Music swept down from on high, and carriages drove up, from which  ladies and gentlemen alighted and ascended the stairs.  They all looked  so beautiful and good!  The gentlemen had stars upon their breasts, and  the ladies wore fresh flowers in their hair; and I often thought,--Why  do I not go there too?    One day my father took me by the hand and said: \"We are going to the  castle; but you must be very polite if the Princess speaks to you, and  kiss her hand.\"    I was about six years of age and as delighted as only one can be at six  years of age.  I had already indulged in many quiet fancies about the  shadows which I had seen evenings through the lighted windows, and had  heard many good things at home of the beneficence of the Prince and  Princess; how gracious they were; how much help and consolation they  brought to the poor and sick; and that they had been chosen by the  grace of God to protect the good and punish the bad.  I had long  pictured to myself what transpired in the castle, so that the Prince  and Princess were already old acquaintances whom I knew as well as my  nut-crackers and leaden soldiers.    My heart beat quickly as I ascended the high stairs with my father, and  just as he was telling me I must call the Princess \"Highness,\" and the  Prince \"Serene Highness,\" the folding-door opened and I saw before me a  tall figure with brilliantly piercing eyes.  She seemed to advance and  stretch out her hand to me.  There was an expression on her countenance  which I had long known, and a heavenly smile played about her cheeks.  I could restrain myself no longer, and while my father stood at the  door bowing very low--I knew not why--my heart sprang into my throat.  I ran to the beautiful lady, threw my arms round her neck and kissed  her as I would my mother.  The beautiful, majestic lady willingly  submitted, stroked my hair and smiled; but my father took my hand, led  me away, and said I was very rude, and that he should never take me  there again.  I grew utterly bewildered.  The blood mounted to my  cheeks, for I felt that my father had been unjust to me.  I looked at  the Princess as if she ought to shield me, but upon her face was only  an expression of mild earnestness.  Then I looked round upon the ladies  and gentlemen assembled in the room, believing that they would come to  my defense.  But as I looked, I saw that they were laughing.  Then the  tears sprang into my eyes, and out of the door, down the stairs, and  past the lindens in the castle yard, I rushed home, where I threw  myself into my mother's arms and sobbed and wept.    \"What has happened to you?\" said she.    \"Oh! mother!\" I cried; \"I was at the Princess', and she was such a good  and beautiful woman, just like you, dear mother, that I had to throw my  arms round her neck and kiss her.\"    \"Ah!\" said my mother; \"you should not have done that, for they are  strangers and high dignitaries.\"    \"And what then are strangers?\" said I.    \"May I not love all people who look upon me with affectionate and  friendly eyes?\"    \"You can love them, my son,\" replied my mother, \"but you should not  show it.\"    \"Is it then something wrong for me to love people?\" said I.  \"Why  cannot I show it?\"    \"Well, perhaps you are right,\" said she, \"but you must do as your  father says, and when you are older you will understand why you cannot  embrace every woman who regards you with affectionate and friendly  eyes.\"    That was a sad day.  Father came home, agreed I had been very uncivil.  At night my mother put me to bed, and I prayed, but I could not sleep,  and kept wondering what these strange people were, whom one must not  love.          *      *      *      *      *    Thou poor human heart!  So soon in the spring are thy leaves broken and  the feathers torn from the wings!  When the spring-red of life opens  the hidden calyx of the soul, it perfumes our whole being with love.  We learn to stand and to walk, to speak and to read, but no one teaches  us love.  It is inherent in us like life, they say, and is the very  deepest foundation of our existence.  As the heavenly bodies incline to  and attract each other, and will always cling together by the  everlasting law of gravitation, so heavenly souls incline to and  attract each other, and will always cling together by the everlasting  law of love.  A flower cannot blossom without sunshine, and man cannot  live without love.  Would not the child's heart break in despair when  the first cold storm of the world sweeps over it, if the warm sunlight  of love from the eyes of mother and father did not shine upon him like  the soft reflection of divine light and love?  The ardent yearning,  which then awakes in the child, is the purest and deepest love.  It is  the love which embraces the whole world; which shines resplendent  wherever the eyes of men beam upon it, which exults wherever it hears  the human voice.  It is the old, immeasurable love, a deep well which  no plummet has ever sounded; a fountain of perennial richness.  Whoever  knows it also knows that in love there is no More and no Less; but that  he who loves can only love with the whole heart, and with the whole  soul; with all his strength and with all his will.    But, alas, how little remains of this love by the time we have finished  one-half of our life-journey!  Soon the child learns that there are  strangers, and ceases to be a child.  The spring of love becomes hidden  and soon filled up.  Our eyes gleam no more, and heavy-hearted we pass  one another in the bustling streets.  We scarcely greet each other, for  we know how sharply it cuts the soul when a greeting remains  unanswered, and how sad it is to be sundered from those whom we have  once greeted, and whose hands we have clasped.  The wings of the soul  lose their plumes; the leaves of the flower fast fall off and wither;  and of this fountain of love there remain but a few drops.  We still  call these few drops love, but it is no longer the clear, fresh,  all-abounding child-love.  It is love with anxiety and trouble, a  consuming flame, a burning passion; love which wastes itself like  rain-drops upon the hot sand; love which is a longing, not a sacrifice;  love which says \"Wilt thou be mine,\" not love which says, \"I must be  thine.\"  It is a most selfish, vacillating love.  And this is the love  which poets sing and in which young men and maidens believe; a fire  which burns up and down, yet does not warm, and leaves nothing behind  but smoke and ashes.  All of us at some period of life have believed  that these rockets of sunbeams were everlasting love, but the brighter  the glitter, the darker the night which follows.    And then when all around grows dark, when we feel utterly alone, when  all men right and left pass us by and know us not, a forgotten feeling  rises in the breast.  We know not what it is, for it is neither love  nor friendship.  You feel like crying to him who passes you so cold and  strange: \"Dost thou not know me?\"  Then one realizes that man is nearer  to man than brother to brother, father to son, or friend to friend.  How an old, holy saying rings through our souls, that strangers are  nearest to us.  Why must we pass them in silence?  We know not, but  must resign ourselves to it.  When two trains are rushing by upon the  iron rails and thou seest a well-known eye that would recognize thee,  stretch out thy hand and try to grasp the hand of a friend, and perhaps  thou wilt understand"]]]
