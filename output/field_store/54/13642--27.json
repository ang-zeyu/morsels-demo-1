And he had his reward.  It is not any ordinary journalist and sketcher who could have compelled  from Tennyson such a tribute as lines \"To E.L. on his Travels in Greece\":--        \"Illyrian woodlands, echoing falls        Of water, sheets of summer glass,        The long divine Peneian pass,      The vast Akrokeraunian walls,        \"Tomohrit, Athos, all things fair,        With such a pencil, such a pen,        You shadow forth to distant men,      I read and felt that I was there.\"    Lear was a man to whom, as to Tennyson's Ulysses,        \"All experience is an arch wherethrough      Gleams that untravelled world.\"    After settling at San Remo, and when he was nearly sixty years old, he  determined to visit India and Ceylon. He started once and failed, being  taken so ill at Suez that he was obliged to return. The next year he  succeeded, and brought away some thousands of drawings of the most striking  views from all three Presidencies and from the tropical island. His  appetite for travel continued to grow with what it fed upon; and although  he hated a long sea-voyage, he used seriously to contemplate as possible a  visit to relations in New Zealand. It may safely, however, be averred that  no considerations would have tempted him to visit the Arctic regions.        A hard-working life, checkered by the odd adventures which happen      to the odd and the adventurous and pass over the commonplace; a      career brightened by the high appreciation of unimpeachable      critics; lightened, till of late, by the pleasant society and good      wishes of innumerable friends; saddened by the growing pressure of      ill health and solitude; cheered by his constant trust in the love      and sympathy of those who knew him best, however far away,--such      was the life of Edward Lear.          --_The London Saturday Review,_ Feb. 4, 1888.    Among the writers who have striven with varying success during the last  thirty or forty years to awaken the merriment of the \"rising generation\" of  the time being, Mr. Edward Lear occupies the first place in seniority, if  not in merit. The parent of modern nonsense-writers, he is distinguished  from all his followers and imitators by the superior consistency with which  he has adhered to his aim,--that of amusing his readers by fantastic  absurdities, as void of vulgarity or cynicism as they are incapable of  being made to harbor any symbolical meaning. He \"never deviates into  sense;\" but those who appreciate him never feel the need of such deviation.  He has a genius for coining absurd names and words, which, even when they  are suggested by the exigencies of his metre, have a ludicrous  appropriateness to the matter in hand. His verse is, with the exception of  a certain number of cockney rhymes, wonderfully flowing and even  melodious--or, as he would say, _meloobious_--while to all these  qualifications for his task must finally be added the happy gift of  pictorial expression, enabling him to double, nay, often to quadruple, the  laughable effect of his text by an inexhaustible profusion of the quaintest  designs. Generally speaking, these designs are, as it were, an idealization  of the efforts of a clever child; but now and then--as in the case of the  nonsense-botany--Mr. Lear reminds us what a genuine and graceful artist he  really is. The advantage to a humorist of being able to illustrate his own  text has been shown in the case of Thackeray and Mr. W.S. Gilbert, to  mention two familiar examples; but in no other instance of such a  combination have we discovered such geniality as is to be found in the  nonsense-pictures of Mr. Lear. We have spoken above of the melodiousness of  Mr. Lear's verses, a quality which renders them excellently suitable for  musical setting, and which has not escaped the notice of the author  himself. We have also heard effective arrangements, presumably by other  composers, of the adventures of the Table and the Chair, and of the cruise  of the Owl and the Pussy-cat,--the latter introduced into the \"drawing-room  entertainment\" of one of the followers of John Parry. Indeed, in these days  of adaptations, it is to be wondered at that no enterprising librettist has  attempted to build a children's comic opera out of the materials supplied  in the four books with which we are now concerned. The first of these,  originally published in 1846, and brought out in an enlarged form in 1863,  is exclusively devoted to nonsense-verses of one type. Mr. Lear is careful  to disclaim the credit of having created this type, for he tells us in the  preface to his third book that \"the lines beginning, 'There was an old man  of Tobago,' were suggested to me by a valued friend, as a form of verse  leading itself to limitless variety for Rhymes and Pictures.\" Dismissing  the further question of the authorship of \"There was an old man of Tobago,\"  we propose to give a few specimens of Mr. Lear's Protean powers as  exhibited in the variation of this simple type. Here, to begin with, is a  favorite verse, which we are very glad to have an opportunity of giving, as  it is often incorrectly quoted, \"cocks\" being substituted for \"owls\" in the  third line:        \"There was an Old Man with a beard,      Who said, 'It is just as I feared!      Two Owls and a Hen, four Larks and a Wren,      Have all built their nests in my beard!'\"    With the kindly fatalism which is the distinctive note of the foregoing  stanza, the sentiment of our next extract is in vivid contrast:--          \"There was an Old Man in a tree,      Who was terribly bored by a bee;      When they said, 'Does it buzz?' he replied, 'Yes, it does!      It's a regular brute of a Bee.'\"    To the foregoing verse an historic interest attaches, if, that is, we are  right in supposing it to have inspired Mr. Gilbert with his famous  \"Nonsense-Rhyme in Blank Verse.\" We quote from memory:--        \"There was an Old Man of St. Bees,      Who was stung in the arm by a wasp.      When they asked, 'Does it hurt?' he replied, 'No, it doesn't,      But I thought all the while 'twas a Hornet!'\"    Passing over the lines referring to the \"Young Person\" of Crete to whom the  epithet \"ombliferous\" is applied, we may be pardoned--on the ground of the  geographical proximity of the two countries named--for quoting together two  stanzas which in reality are separated by a good many pages:--        \"There was a Young Lady of Norway,      Who casually sat in a doorway;      When the doors queezed her flat, she exclaimed, 'What of that?'      This courageous young person of Norway.\"        \"There was a Young Lady of Sweden,      Who went by the slow train to Weedon;      When they cried, 'Weedon Station!' she made no observation,      But thought she should go back to Sweden.\"    A noticeable feature about this first book, and one which we think is  peculiar to it, is the harsh treatment which the eccentricities of the  inhabitants of certain towns appear to have met with at the hands of their  fellow-residents. No less than three people are \"smashed,\"--the Old Man of  Whitehaven \"who danced a quadrille with a Raven;\" the Old Person of Buda;  and the Old Man with a gong \"who bumped at it all the day long,\" though in  the last-named case we admit that there was considerable provocation.  Before quitting the first \"Nonsense-Book,\" we would point out that it  contains one or two forms that are interesting; for instance, \"scroobious,\"  which we take to be a Portmanteau word, and \"spickle-speckled,\" a favorite  form of reduplication with Mr. Lear, and of which the best specimen occurs  in his last book, \"He tinkledy-binkledy-winkled the bell.\" The second book,  published in 1871, shows Mr. Lear in the maturity of sweet desipience, and  will perhaps remain the favorite volume of the four to grown-up readers.  The nonsense-songs are all good, and \"The Story of the Four little Children  who went Round the World\" is the most exquisite piece of imaginative  absurdity that the present writer is acquainted with. But before coming to  that, let us quote a few lines from \"The Jumblies,\" who, as all the world  knows, went to sea in a sieve:--          \"They sailed to the Western Sea, they did,        To a land all covered with trees.      And they bought an Owl, and a useful Cart,      And a pound of Rice, and a Cranberry Tart,        And a hive of silvery Bees.      And they bought a Pig, and some green Jack-Daws,      And a lovely Monkey with lollipop paws,      And forty bottles of Ring-Bo-Ree,        And no end of Stilton Cheese.          _Far and few, far and few,            Are the lands where the Jumblies live.          Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,            And they went to sea in a sieve._      And in twenty years they all came back,        In twenty years or more,      And every one said, 'How tall they've grown!      For they've been to the Lakes, and the Torrible Zone,        And the hills of the Chankly Bore.'\"    From the pedestrian excursion of the Table and the Chair, we cannot resist  making a brief quotation, though in this, as in every case, the inability  to quote the drawings also is a sad drawback:--        \"So they both went slowly down,      And walked about the town,      With a cheerful bumpy sound,      As they toddled round and round.      And everybody cried,      As they hastened to their side,      'See, the Table and the Chair      Have come out to take the air!'        \"But in going down an alley      To a castle in a valley,      They completely lost their way,      And wandered all the day,      Till, to see them safely back,      They paid a Ducky-Quack,      And a Beetle and a Mouse,      Who took them to their house.        \"Then they whispered to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13656"],[0,"A Series of Lessons in Raja Yoga (#2)"],[1,"throw out its light. In you, the Candidate, it is fighting hard to  have its beams pierce through the material coverings When the Real Self  begins to arouse itself from its sleep, its dreams vanish from it, and it  begins to see the world as it is, and to recognize itself in Reality and  not as the distorted thing of its dreams.    The savage and barbarian are scarcely conscious of the \"I.\" They are but  a little above the animal in point of consciousness, and their \"I\" is  almost entirely a matter of the consciousness of the wants of the body;  the satisfaction of the appetites; the gratification of the passions; the  securing of personal comfort; the expression of lust, savage power, etc.  In the savage the lower part of the Instinctive Mind is the seat of the  \"I.\" (See \"Fourteen Lessons\" for explanation of the several mental planes  of man.) If the savage could analyze his thoughts he would say that the  \"I\" was the physical body, the said body having certain \"feelings,\"  \"wants\" and \"desires.\" The \"I\" of such a man is a physical \"I,\" the body  representing its form and substance. Not only is this true of the savage,  but even among so-called \"civilized\" men of to-day we find many in this  stage. They have developed powers of thinking and reasoning, but they do  not \"live in their minds\" as do some of their brothers. They use their  thinking powers for the gratification of their bodily desires and  cravings, and really live on the plane of the Instinctive Mind. Such a  person may speak of \"my mind,\" or \"my soul,\" not from a high position  where he looks upon these things from the standpoint of a Master who  realizes his Real Self, but from below, from the point-of-view of the man  who lives on the plane of the Instinctive Mind and who sees above  _himself_ the higher attributes. To such people the body is the \"I.\"  Their \"I\" is bound up with the senses, and that which comes to them  through the senses. Of course, as Man advances in \"culture\" and  \"civilization,\" his senses become educated, and are satisfied only with  more refined things, while the less cultivated man is perfectly satisfied  with the more material and gross sense gratifications. Much that we call  \"cultivation\" and \"culture\" is naught but a cultivation of a more refined  form of sense gratification, instead of a real advance in consciousness  and unfoldment. It is true that the advanced student and Master is  possessed of highly developed senses, often far surpassing those of the  ordinary man, but in such cases the senses have been cultivated under the  mastery of the Will, and are made servants of the Ego instead of things  hindering the progress of the soul--they are made servants instead of  masters.    As Man advances in the scale, he begins to have a somewhat higher  conception of the \"I.\" He begins to use his mind and reason, and he  passes on to the Mental Plane--his mind begins to manifest upon the plane  of Intellect. He finds that there is something within him that is higher  than the body. He finds that his mind seems more _real_ to him than does  the physical part of him, and in times of deep thought and study he is  able almost to forget the existence of the body.    In this second stage, Man soon becomes perplexed. He finds problems that  demand an answer, but as soon as he thinks he has answered them the  problems present themselves in a new phase, and he is called upon to  \"explain his explanation.\" The mind, even although not controlled and  directed by the Will, has a wonderful range, but, nevertheless, Man finds  himself traveling around and around in a circle, and realizes that he is  confronted continually by the Unknown. This disturbs him, and the higher  the stage of \"book learning\" he attains, the more disturbed does he  become. The man of but little knowledge does not see the existence of  many problems that force themselves before the attention of the man of  more knowledge, and demand an explanation from him. The tortures of the  man who has attained the mental growth that enables him to see the new  problems and the impossibility of their answer, cannot be imagined by one  who has not advanced to that stage.    The man in this stage of consciousness thinks of his \"I\" as a mental  thing, having a lower companion, the body. He feels that he has advanced,  but yet his \"I\" does not give him the answer to the riddles and questions  that perplex him. And he becomes most unhappy. Such men often develop  into Pessimists, and consider the whole of life as utterly evil and  disappointing--a curse rather than a blessing. Pessimism belongs to this  plane, for neither the Physical Plane man or the Spiritual Plane man have  this curse of Pessimism. The former man has no such disquieting thoughts,  for he is almost entirely absorbed in gratifying his animal nature, while  the latter man recognizes his mind as an instrument of himself, rather  than as _himself_, and knows it to be imperfect in its present stage of  growth. He knows that he has in himself the key to all knowledge--locked  up in the Ego--and which the trained mind, cultivated, developed and  guided by the awakened Will, may grasp as it unfolds. Knowing this the  advanced man no longer despairs, and, recognizing his real nature, and  his possibilities, as he awakens into a consciousness of his powers and  capabilities, he laughs at the old despondent, pessimistic ideas, and  discards them like a worn-out garment. Man on the Mental Plane of  consciousness is like a huge elephant who knows not his own strength. He  could break down barriers and assert himself over nearly any condition or  environment, but in his ignorance of his real condition and power he may  be mastered by a puny driver, or frightened by the rustling of a piece of  paper.    When the Candidate becomes an Initiate--when he passes from the purely  Mental Plane on to the Spiritual Plane--he realizes that the \"I,\" the  Real Self--is something higher than either body or mind, and that both of  the latter may be used as tools and instruments by the Ego or \"I.\" This  knowledge is not reached by purely intellectual reasoning, although such  efforts of the mind are often necessary to help in the unfoldment, and  the Masters so use it. The real knowledge, however, comes as a special  form of consciousness. The Candidate becomes \"aware\" of the real \"I,\" and  this consciousness being attained, he passes to the rank of the  Initiates. When the Initiate passes the second degree of consciousness,  and begins to grow into a realization of his relationship to the  Whole--when he begins to manifest the Expansion of Self--then is he on  the road to Mastership.    In the present lesson we shall endeavor to point out to the Candidate the  methods of developing or increasing the realization of this \"I\"  consciousness--this first degree work. We give the following exercises or  development drills for the Candidate to practice. He will find that a  careful and conscientious following of these directions will tend to  unfold in him a sufficient degree of the \"I\" consciousness, to enable him  to enter into higher stages of development and power. All that is  necessary is for the Candidate to feel within himself the dawn of the  awakening consciousness, or awareness of the Real Self. The higher stages  of the \"I\" consciousness come gradually, for once on the Path there is no  retrogression or going backward. There may be pauses on the journey, but  there is no such thing as actually losing that which is once gained on  The Path.    This \"I\" consciousness, even in its highest stages, is but a preliminary  step toward what is called \"Illumination,\" and which signifies the  awakening of the Initiate to a realization of his actual connection with  and relation to the Whole. The full sight of the glory of the \"I,\" is but  a faint reflected glow of \"Illumination.\" The Candidate, once that he  enters fully into the \"I\" consciousness, becomes an \"Initiate.\" And the  Initiate who enters into the dawn of Illumination takes his first step  upon the road to Mastery. The Initiation is the awakening of the soul to  a knowledge of its real existence--the Illumination is the revelation of  the real nature of the soul, and of its relationship with the Whole.  After the first dawn of the \"I\" consciousness has been attained, the  Candidate is more able to grasp the means of developing the consciousness  to a still higher degree--is more able to use the powers latent within  him; to control his own mental states; to manifest a Centre of  Consciousness and Influence that will radiate into the outer world which  is always striving and hunting for such centres around which it may  revolve.    Man must master himself before he can hope to exert an influence beyond  himself. There is no royal road to unfoldment and power--each step must  be taken in turn, and each Candidate must take the step himself, and by  his own effort. But he may, and will, be aided by the helping hand of the  teachers who have traveled The Path before him, and who know just when  that helping hand is needed to lift the Candidate over the rough places.    We bid the Candidate to pay strict attention to the following  instruction, as it is all important. Do not slight any part of it, for we  are giving you only what is necessary, and are stating it as briefly as  possible. Pay attention, and follow the instruction closely. This lesson  must be mastered before you progress. And it must be practiced not only  now, but at many stages of the journey, until full Initiation and  Illumination is yours.      RULES AND EXERCISES DESIGNED TO AID THE CANDIDATE IN HIS INITIATION.    The first instruction along the line of Initiation is designed to awaken  the mind to a full realization and consciousness of the individuality of  the \"I.\" The Candidate is taught to relax his body, and to calm his mind  and to meditate upon the \"I\" until it is presented clearly and sharply  before the "]]]
