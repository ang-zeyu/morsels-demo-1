They  must have been very well made, for their seams didn't show at all, and  they changed shape in a queer way when they moved; one minute they  were long and thin and the next minute fat and bunchy, instead of  always staying the same like he did. Their feet padded softly on the  ground, and they crept quite close to him, twitching their noses,  while the Rabbit stared hard to see which side the clockwork stuck  out, for he knew that people who jump generally have something to wind  them up. But he couldn't see it. They were evidently a new kind of  rabbit altogether.                                 Summer Days    They stared at him, and the little Rabbit stared back. And all the  time their noses twitched.    \"Why don't you get up and play with us?\" one of them asked.    \"I don't feel like it,\" said the Rabbit, for he didn't want to explain  that he had no clockwork.    \"Ho!\" said the furry rabbit. \"It's as easy as anything,\" And he gave a  big hop sideways and stood on his hind legs.    \"I don't believe you can!\" he said.    \"I can!\" said the little Rabbit. \"I can jump higher than anything!\" He  meant when the Boy threw him, but of course he didn't want to say so.    \"Can you hop on your hind legs?\" asked the furry rabbit.    That was a dreadful question, for the Velveteen Rabbit had no hind  legs at all! The back of him was made all in one piece, like a  pincushion. He sat still in the bracken, and hoped that the other  rabbits wouldn't notice.    \"I don't want to!\" he said again.    But the wild rabbits have very sharp eyes. And this one stretched out  his neck and looked.    \"He hasn't got any hind legs!\" he called out. \"Fancy a rabbit without  any hind legs!\" And he began to laugh.    \"I have!\" cried the little Rabbit. \"I have got hind legs! I am sitting  on them!\"    \"Then stretch them out and show me, like this!\" said the wild rabbit.  And he began to whirl round and dance, till the little Rabbit got  quite dizzy.    \"I don't like dancing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit still!\"    But all the while he was longing to dance, for a funny new tickly  feeling ran through him, and he felt he would give anything in the  world to be able to jump about like these rabbits did.    The strange rabbit stopped dancing, and came quite close. He came so  close this time that his long whiskers brushed the Velveteen Rabbit's  ear, and then he wrinkled his nose suddenly and flattened his ears and  jumped backwards.    \"He doesn't smell right!\" he exclaimed. \"He isn't a rabbit at all! He  isn't real!\"    \"I am Real!\" said the little Rabbit. \"I am Real! The Boy said so!\" And  he nearly began to cry.    Just then there was a sound of footsteps, and the Boy ran past near  them, and with a stamp of feet and a flash of white tails the two  strange rabbits disappeared.    \"Come back and play with me!\" called the little Rabbit. \"Oh, do come  back! I know I am Real!\"    But there was no answer, only the little ants ran to and fro, and the  bracken swayed gently where the two strangers had passed. The  Velveteen Rabbit was all alone.    \"Oh, dear!\" he thought. \"Why did they run away like that? Why couldn't  they stop and talk to me?\"    For a long time he lay very still, watching the bracken, and hoping  that they would come back. But they never returned, and presently the  sun sank lower and the little white moths fluttered out, and the Boy  came and carried him home.      Weeks passed, and the little Rabbit grew very old and shabby, but the  Boy loved him just as much. He loved him so hard that he loved all his  whiskers off, and the pink lining to his ears turned grey, and his  brown spots faded. He even began to lose his shape, and he scarcely  looked like a rabbit any more, except to the Boy. To him he was always  beautiful, and that was all that the little Rabbit cared about. He  didn't mind how he looked to other people, because the nursery magic  had made him Real, and when you are Real shabbiness doesn't matter.    And then, one day, the Boy was ill.    His face grew very flushed, and he talked in his sleep, and his little  body was so hot that it burned the Rabbit when he held him close.  Strange people came and went in the nursery, and a light burned all  night and through it all the little Velveteen Rabbit lay there, hidden  from sight under the bedclothes, and he never stirred, for he was  afraid that if they found him some one might take him away, and he  knew that the Boy needed him.    It was a long weary time, for the Boy was too ill to play, and the  little Rabbit found it rather dull with nothing to do all day long.  But he snuggled down patiently, and looked forward to the time when  the Boy should be well again, and they would go out in the garden  amongst the flowers and the butterflies and play splendid games in the  raspberry thicket like they used to. All sorts of delightful things he  planned, and while the Boy lay half asleep he crept up close to the  pillow and whispered them in his ear. And presently the fever turned,  and the Boy got better. He was able to sit up in bed and look at  picture-books, while the little Rabbit cuddled close at his side. And  one day, they let him get up and dress.    It was a bright, sunny morning, and the windows stood wide open. They  had carried the Boy out on to the balcony, wrapped in a shawl, and the  little Rabbit lay tangled up among the bedclothes, thinking.    The Boy was going to the seaside to-morrow. Everything was arranged,  and now it only remained to carry out the doctor's orders. They talked  about it all, while the little Rabbit lay under the bedclothes, with  just his head peeping out, and listened. The room was to be  disinfected, and all the books and toys that the Boy had played with  in bed must be burnt.    \"Hurrah!\" thought the little Rabbit. \"To-morrow we shall go to the  seaside!\" For the boy had often talked of the seaside, and he wanted  very much to see the big waves coming in, and the tiny crabs, and the  sand castles.    Just then Nana caught sight of him.    \"How about his old Bunny?\" she asked.    \"That?\" said the doctor. \"Why, it's a mass of scarlet fever  germs!-Burn it at once. What? Nonsense! Get him a new one. He mustn't  have that any more!\"                                Anxious Times    And so the little Rabbit was put into a sack with the old  picture-books and a lot of rubbish, and carried out to the end of the  garden behind the fowl-house. That was a fine place to make a bonfire,  only the gardener was too busy just then to attend to it. He had the  potatoes to dig and the green peas to gather, but next morning he  promised to come quite early and burn the whole lot.    That night the Boy slept in a different bedroom, and he had a new  bunny to sleep with him. It was a splendid bunny, all white plush with  real glass eyes, but the Boy was too excited to care very much about  it. For to-morrow he was going to the seaside, and that in itself was  such a wonderful thing that he could think of nothing else.    And while the Boy was asleep, dreaming of the seaside, the little  Rabbit lay among the old picture-books in the corner behind the  fowl-house, and he felt very lonely. The sack had been left untied,  and so by wriggling a bit he was able to get his head through the  opening and look out. He was shivering a little, for he had always  been used to sleeping in a proper bed, and by this time his coat had  worn so thin and threadbare from hugging that it was no longer any  protection to him. Near by he could see the thicket of raspberry  canes, growing tall and close like a tropical jungle, in whose shadow  he had played with the Boy on bygone mornings. He thought of those  long sunlit hours in the garden-how happy they were-and a great  sadness came over him. He seemed to see them all pass before him, each  more beautiful than the other, the fairy huts in the flower-bed, the  quiet evenings in the wood when he lay in the bracken and the little  ants ran over his paws; the wonderful day when he first knew that he  was Real. He thought of the Skin Horse, so wise and gentle, and all  that he had told him. Of what use was it to be loved and lose one's  beauty and become Real if it all ended like this? And a tear, a real  tear, trickled down his little shabby velvet nose and fell to the  ground.    And then a strange thing happened. For where the tear had fallen a  flower grew out of the ground, a mysterious flower, not at all like  any that grew in the garden. It had slender green leaves the colour of  emeralds, and in the centre of the leaves a blossom like a golden cup.  It was so beautiful that the little Rabbit forgot to cry, and just lay  there watching it. And presently the blossom opened, and out of it  there stepped a fairy.    She was quite the loveliest fairy in the whole world. Her dress was of  pearl and dew-drops, and there were flowers round her neck and in her  hair, and her face was like the most perfect flower of all. And she  came close to the little Rabbit and gathered him up in her arms and  kissed him on his velveteen nose that was all damp from crying.    \"Little Rabbit,\" she said, \"don't you know who I am?\"    The Rabbit looked up at her, and it seemed to him that he had seen her  face before, but he couldn't think where.    \"I am the nursery magic Fairy,\" she said. \"I take care of all the  playthings that the children have loved. When they are old and worn  out and the children don't need them any more, then I come and take  them away with me and turn them into Real.\"    \"Wasn't I Real before?\" asked the little Rabbit.    \"You were Real to the Boy,\" the Fairy said, \"because he loved you. Now  you shall be Real to every one.\"                               The Fairy Flower    And she held the little Rabbit close in her arms and flew with him  into the wood.    It was light now, for the moon had risen. All the forest was  beautiful, and the fronds of the bracken shone like frosted silver.

But  who is Black Mart?\"    \"Oh, he's a miner that's workin' the claim next ter Golconda. He's a  friend o' the cook there, an' comes over ter eat pretty often. Him and  Moose had some trouble once over some minin' ground, an' Mart kinda  takes it out on all Moose's friends, even if they's only boys an' dogs,  don't he, Baldy?\" And Baldy wagged that he certainly did. \"Now the cook  says they've got work dogs enough belongin' ter the claim ter feed,  without supportin' my mangy cur in idleness. Mr. Allan,\" earnestly, \"he  ain't mangy, an' he's the most willin' dog I ever seen fer any one that  loves him. But he ain't sociable with every one, an' he don't like bein'  handled rough.\"    \"Scotty\" looked at Baldy with a practiced and critical eye. \"Those are  all points in his favor,\" he remarked. \"You can't do much with a dog  that gives his affection and obedience indiscriminately.\"    \"Besides, he ain't no cur--he's one o' them Bowen-Dalzene pups, an' you  know there ain't a poor dog in the lot. They give him to me 'cause he  wasn't like any o' the others in the litter, an' would 'a' spoiled the  looks o' the team when they was old enough ter be hitched up,\" continued  Ben breathlessly. \"He was sort o' wild, too, an' he wouldn't pay  attention t' any of 'em when I was round, an' they said I might as well  take him fer keeps as t' have him runnin' away t' git t' me all the  time.\"    \"And your mother does not like him, and thinks it would be best not to  keep him now?\"    \"She really does like him; but she does the washin' fer the Camp, an'  helps with the dishes, an' sews when she kin git a job at it. But there  ain't none of 'em reg'lar, an' sometimes there ain't more'n enough fer  us two t' live on. Then she gits pretty tired an' discouraged like, an'  says Baldy's a useless expense, an' keeps me from doin' my chores,  'cause I like t' play with him, an'--\"    \"Yes, yes, I see,\" broke in the Woman hastily, anxious to spare him any  further revelations of a painful nature. \"I know exactly how it is; but  maybe we could make some arrangement with your mother about the dog. We  will take a sort of an option on him; you can keep him with you, and we  will pay a certain sum for the privilege of being permitted to buy him  outright before the stampede actually begins.\"    The boy looked at her suspiciously, but there was no smile on her lips,  and she rose a notch in his estimation. She evidently did realize, in a  slight degree, what an unusual bargain was being offered in his  heart-breaking sacrifice.    \"An' it ain't 'cause his appetite's gone that makes him thin. I wasn't  tellin' the truth about that,\" he stammered desperately; \"he's jest  _hungry_.\" The child's mouth quivered and he hesitated, yet he was  determined to tell the whole of the sordid little tragedy now that he  had begun. \"But spendin' too much time with him when I should be workin'  ain't the worst. To-day I done somethin' that mebbe she'll think ain't  exac'ly square; an' my mother believes if you ain't square in this world  you ain't much worth while.\"    \"You're not, son,\" agreed \"Scotty\" heartily. \"Your mother's right.\"    \"My father was allers called Honest Ben Edwards out here on the Third  Beach Line, an' Mother says she'd ruther have that mem'ry o' him than  all the fortunes that's been made in Alaska by lyin' an' steal-in' an'  jumpin' other people's claims.\"    \"Right again, Ben. Nothing can take that from her, and a name like that  is the best thing a man can leave his son.\"    \"This mornin' she gave me some money fer a new pair o' mittens fer her,  an' shoes fer me; an' the cook asked me t' buy a kitchen knife an' a few  pans fer him. I walked inter town t' git 'em, an' Baldy come with me,  though she said I was foolish t' be bothered with him. But I told her it  was awful lonesome on the trail, an' she said I could take him this  time.\" He paused for breath, visibly embarrassed.    \"And you forgot all about your errands,\" hazarded the Woman.    \"No, ma'am, I didn't exac'ly forgit, but when I was passin' the Court  House an' I seen a big crowd inside, I went in, too, ter listen a  minute.    \"That lawyer Fink, that got up the Kennel Club, an' has the bully dog  team, an' Daly, the feller with the smile that makes you feel like  there's sunshine in the room, was a-talkin' agin each other; an' their  fightin' was so excitin' an' so smooth an' perlite too, that everybody  was a-settin' on the edges o' their chairs a-waitin' fer what was  a-comin' next.\"    \"So you were interested in what the lawyers had to say?\"    \"Yes, sir. Ever since my mother told me the story about President  Lincoln a while ago, I been wantin' t' be a lawyer when I grow up. He  didn't have no more book-learnin' than me at first, but he wouldn't let  nothin' stop him, an' jest see what he done.\"    \"Lincoln is to be your model, then? Well, you're right to aim high, Ben.  You can practice his simple virtues of being honest and kind and  industrious every day, and anywhere. And the education must be managed  someway,\" added the Woman thoughtfully.    \"After Mother read me that speech o' Mr. Lincoln's at Gettysburg, when  all the people was jest dumb from their feelin's bein' so solemn an'  deep; an' some o' his other speeches that was fine, I begun t' go t'  town whenever there was t' be any good speakin', even when I had t' walk  both ways.\"    \"Shows your determination, as a starter,\" replied \"Scotty\"  encouragingly. \"And were you always repaid for your tramp?\"    \"Most allers, Mr. Allan. Last Fourth o' July I heerd Judge Tucker tell  in his pleasant voice 'at sounds like he likes talkin' t' you all that  Virginia's done fer our country, an' I wished I was from Virginia too.  But mebbe some day I'll make some boy wish he was from Alaska by bein'  fine an' smart an' gentle like Judge Tucker.\"    \"Virginia or Alaska, Ben--it's all the same, so long as you're proud of  your state, and give your state a chance to be proud of you.\"    \"Yes, ma'am; that's what Mother says. Then I heerd Tom Gaffney recitin'  Robert Emmett's last speech, on St. Patrick's day, at Eagle Hall, an' I  near cried at the end; an' I don't cry easy. It takes somethin' pretty  bad t' make me cry,\" and he looked furtively toward Baldy.    \"I'm sure it does, sonny; any one can see that you're game, all right;  but that speech always makes me cry too.\"    The boy regarded \"Scotty\" appreciatively. Here was a typical Alaskan, a  sturdy trailsman, touched by the tender, pitiful things of life, just  like a little boy that hasn't had time to become hardened. Ben felt that  they would be friends.    [Illustration: SCOTTY AND BALDY]    \"I like all kinds o' speakin', too; not jest the fiery sort that makes  you want t' fight fer your country, an' mebbe die fer it like Robert  Emmett; but the kind that jest makes you want t' be good ter folks an'  dogs, an' do the best you kin when things is agin you, an' you don't  see much ahead--\"    The Woman nodded gravely. \"Yes, I know. It's the most difficult sort of  bravery--the sort without flags, and music, and cheers to keep you up to  the firing line.\"    \"That's the kind, ma'am. Mebbe you know Bishop Rowe. That's what he  preaches--jest doin' your best all the time, like you was in some big  race. When he's in Nome I allers go t' St. Mary's. He talks plain an'  simple, an' cheers you up--I guess kinda the way Lincoln talked--jest  like he knew all about people's troubles an' didn't blame 'em fer  mistakes, but wanted t' help 'em t' do better. Sometimes his talks don't  sound smooth, an' made up beforehand, but you never forgit 'em.\"    \"Eloquence of the heart instead of the tongue,\" murmured the Woman.    \"An' last August I went every night fer near a week, when Mr. Wickersham  was talkin' men inter sendin' him t' Washington, no matter what they  felt an' said agin his goin' when he wasn't before 'em.\"    \"You have certainly had a variety of orators, and a wide range of  subjects.\"    \"You kin see I ain't missed a single chanct t' hear any of 'em since I  made up my mind t' be a great man\"--and then appalled by his lengthy  burst of eloquence the child colored violently and concluded in  confusion--\"an' this mornin' I got so interested in them speeches o'  Daly's an' Fink's, I must 'a' lost all track o' time, fer when I come  out it was noon, an' Baldy was gone.\"    \"You must indeed have been absorbed to forget Baldy. Where did you find  him?\"    \"One o' the school kids told me the pound-man had got him, so I went  over t' the pound on the Sand Spit as fast as I could run. I explained  t' the man that Baldy wasn't a Nome dog; that we live five miles out at  Golconda--but he said he was gittin' pretty sick o' that excuse. That no  boy's dog ever really lived in Nome, so fur's he could find out; that  all of 'em was residin' in the suburbs, an' only come in t' spend a day  now an' then.\"    \"It's a strange thing,\" mused the Woman, \"that all pound-men are  sarcastic and sceptical. It seems an inevitable part of their  occupation. They never believed me when I was a little girl, either.  Then what?\"    \"He said the only thing that concerned him was that Baldy was in town  when he found him, and hadn't no license. Besides, he thought the dog  was vicious 'cause he growled when the wire was around his neck. Pretty  near any dog 'ud do that ef he had any spirit in him; an' Baldy's jest  full o' spirit.\"    Both the Woman and \"Scotty\" looked involuntarily at Baldy who stood,  dejected and uneasy; and then exchanged a glance in which amusement and  pity struggled for expression.    \"The pound-man said ef I didn't pay the $2.50 t' git him out, an'  another $2.50 t' git him a license, he'd sell the dog along with a lot"]]]
