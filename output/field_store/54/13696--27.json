He will set  himself no unassigned tasks in memory work. It is the first business of  the good instructor to teach the student _how_ to study. The first step  in this process is to impress on the student's mind that systematic  preparation in the history class is as necessary as in Latin, physics,  or geometry. Then let the following or similar instructions be given  him:--         1. Provide yourself with an envelope of small cards or pieces of          note paper. Label each with the subject of the lesson and the          date of its preparation. These envelopes should be always at          hand during your study and preparation. They should be preserved          and filed from day to day.         2. Read the lesson assigned for the day in the textbook, including          all notes and fine print.         3. Write on a sheet of note paper all the unfamiliar words,          allusions, or expressions. Later, look these up in the          dictionary or other reference.         4. Record the dates which you think worthy to be remembered.         5. Discover and make a note of all the apparent contradictions,          inconsistencies, or inaccuracies in the author's statements.         6. Use the map for all the places mentioned in the lesson. Be able          to locate them when you come to class.         7. In nearly every text there is a list of books for library use,          given at the beginning or end of each chapter. Make yourself          familiar with this bibliography.         8. Read the special questions assigned for the day by the teacher.         9. Go to the library. If the book for which you are in search is          not to be found, try another.        10. Learn to use an index. If the topic for which you are looking          does not appear in the index, try looking for the same thing          under another name; or under some related topic.        11. Having found the material in one book, use more than one if          your time permits. When you feel that you have secured the          material which will make a complete answer to the question,          _write the answer on one of your cards for keeping notes._        12. Remember that the teacher will ask constantly _what_ was done,          _when_ was it done, and, most important of all, _why_ it was          done. Make a list of the questions which you think most likely          to be asked on the lesson and ascertain whether you can answer          them without the use of your notes or text.        13. If possible practice your answers aloud. It will make you the          more ready when called on in class.        14. Keep a list of things which are not clear to you and about          which you wish to ask questions.        15. Before completing your preparation, read over these instructions          and be sure that you have complied with them.      It may be claimed that no high school student can be expected to follow  such instructions and that to secure such a daily preparation is  impossible; in answer to which it must be admitted that merely a  perfunctory talk on methods of preparation will accomplish little. If  the instruction just suggested is to bear fruit, the teacher must take  pains to see that it is followed. Carefully to prepare his lesson  according to a definite plan must become a _habit_ with the student.  Facility, accuracy, and thoroughness are impossible otherwise. Haphazard  methods are wasteful of time and unproductive of results. The teacher  can afford to emphasize method during the first few weeks of the course.  The time thus spent in assisting the pupil to develop definite habits of  study will pay rich dividends for the remainder of the student's life.  Daily inquiry as to the method of study pursued, frequent examination of  the student's notes, questions on the important dates selected, the  books used for preparation, new words discovered, and so on, will keep  the importance of the plan before the class and do much to foster the  habit of systematic preparation.      _The question of note-taking_    On the question of notebook work, there will always be a considerable  difference of opinion. It is much easier to state what notebook work  should not be than to outline precisely how it should be conducted.  Certainly it should not be overdone. It should not be an exercise  usurping time disproportionate to its value. It should not be required  primarily for exhibition purposes, although such notes as are kept  should be kept neatly and spelled correctly.    Students should be encouraged to keep their envelope of note paper  always at hand during recitation and while reading. The habit of jotting  down facts, opinions, statistics, comparisons, and contradictions _while  they are being read_ is most desirable and worthy of cultivation. The  student should be taught the wisdom of keeping his notes in a neat,  legible, and easily available form. Shorthand methods should be  discouraged. With a little tactful direction early in the year, the  student may be led to form a most useful habit. The greater the  proportion of intelligent note-taking that is done without compulsion,  the better. No more notes should be _required_ than the teacher can  honestly look over, correct, and grade. It is better to require no notes  at all than to accept careless, superficial inaccuracies as honest work.  One curse of high school history teaching is the tendency of young  teachers trained in college history classes to assign more work than the  student can honestly do or the teacher properly correct.    As has already been intimated, history notes should not be kept in a  book. The required notes should be kept on separate sheets of paper. The  topics should be clearly indicated at the top of each sheet. The  authorities used in arriving at the answer should always be given, with  the volume, chapter, and page. The notes on related topics should be put  into an envelope and properly labeled. After the recitation the student  can make any necessary corrections in his notes without spoiling their  appearance. He will simply substitute a new sheet for the old. If the  teacher discovers in his periodic examination of the notes that some of  the matter asked for has not been properly covered or that errors have  not been corrected, the notes needing revision can be detained for use  in a conference with the student, while the others are returned. If at  any time after completing his high school work the student desires to  use the data contained in his notes or to add to them matter which he  may later read, they are in available form. For convenience and  neatness, for present use, and future reference this device is far  superior to the formal notebook. It has the further advantage of  accustoming the student to the method of note-taking which will be  required of those who go to college.    It would save much valuable time, at present frequently wasted in  writing useless notes, if the teacher constantly squared his notebook  requirements with questions such as these:--         1. Is the notebook work as I am conducting it calculated to develop          the habit of critical reading?         2. Does the time spent in writing up notes justify itself by fixing          in the child's mind new and really relevant information not          given in the text?         3. Is it teaching students to combine facts, opinions, and          statistics, to form conclusions really their own?         4. Is the amount of work required reasonable when it is remembered          that the child has three other subjects to prepare, that he is          from thirteen to eighteen years of age, and more or less          unfamiliar with a library?         5. Am I able carefully and punctually to correct all the notes          required?    Whatever the method the teacher thinks best to be used should be  explained early in the course and thereafter the student should be held  scrupulously responsible for such requirements as are made.      _Instruction in the use of the library and indexes_    Having discussed with the class the questions assigned on the day of  enrollment and explained the method of study recommended for their use,  it will be well for the teacher to devote some time to instruction in  the use of the library. It is possible that the older classes will  require very little of this, but there are few classes where an hour, at  least, cannot well be spent in a discussion of indexes, titles, and  relative value of the works on various subjects. This hour need not be  the regular recitation period. A session before or after school could be  devoted to the purpose. The teacher's instruction, however, will be  greatly assisted if the students are asked to prepare answers before  coming to class to such questions as the following:--         1. How much previous work have you done in the library?         2. Of what use do you think the library should be to you in the          course you are just entering?         3. What is a source book? Of what use are source books?         4. What source books on this period of history are in the library?         5. What do you think will be the best references for questions on          the artistic, industrial, political, social, economic, and          military phases of the history you are about to study?         6. What encyclopedias and works of general reference are in your          library?    The preparation of answers to such questions as these will present to  the student some of the difficulties inevitable to his future library  work and will send him to class prepared to ask intelligent questions.  It will enable the teacher accurately to gauge how much his students  already know about a library and its uses.

When she had finished she dug out another piece, and went to look for  a pantry to put it in. At the top of a heap of rocks up which she  clambered she found that some large stones stood apart but met at the  top, making a room.    \"Oh, this is my little home!\" she said.    At the top and all round it was closed, only in the front it was open.  There was a beautiful shelf in the wall for the kippersol, and she  scrambled down again. She brought a great bunch of prickly pear, and  stuck it in a crevice before the door, and hung wild asparagus over it,  till it looked as though it grew there. No one could see that there was  a room there, for she left only a tiny opening, and hung a branch of  feathery asparagus over it. Then she crept in to see how it looked.  There was a glorious soft green light. Then she went out and picked some  of those purple little ground flowers--you know them--those that keep  their faces close to the ground, but when you turn them up and look at  them they are deep blue eyes looking into yours! She took them with a  little earth, and put them in the crevices between the rocks; and so  the room was quite furnished. Afterwards she went down to the river and  brought her arms full of willow, and made a lovely bed; and, because the  weather was very hot, she lay down to rest upon it.    She went to sleep soon, and slept long, for she was very weak. Late in  the afternoon she was awakened by a few cold drops falling on her face.  She sat up. A great and fierce thunderstorm had been raging, and a  few of the cool drops had fallen through the crevice in the rocks. She  pushed the asparagus branch aside, and looked out, with her little hands  folded about her knees. She heard the thunder rolling, and saw the red  torrents rush among the stones on their way to the river. She heard the  roar of the river as it now rolled, angry and red, bearing away stumps  and trees on its muddy water. She listened and smiled, and pressed  closer to the rock that took care of her. She pressed the palm of her  hand against it. When you have no one to love you, you love the dumb  things very much. When the sun set, it cleared up. Then the little girl  ate some kippersol, and lay down again to sleep. She thought there was  nothing so nice as to sleep. When one has had no food but kippersol  juice for two days, one doesn't feel strong.    \"It is so nice here,\" she thought as she went to sleep, \"I will stay  here always.\"    Afterwards the moon rose. The sky was very clear now, there was not a  cloud anywhere; and the moon shone in through the bushes in the door,  and made a lattice-work of light on her face. She was dreaming a  beautiful dream. The loveliest dreams of all are dreamed when you are  hungry. She thought she was walking in a beautiful place, holding her  father's hand, and they both had crowns on their heads, crowns of wild  asparagus. The people whom they passed smiled and kissed her; some gave  her flowers, and some gave her food, and the sunlight was everywhere.  She dreamed the same dream over and over, and it grew more and more  beautiful; till, suddenly, it seemed as though she were standing quite  alone. She looked up: on one side of her was the high precipice, on the  other was the river, with the willow trees, drooping their branches into  the water; and the moonlight was over all. Up, against the night sky the  pointed leaves of the kippersol trees were clearly marked, and the rocks  and the willow trees cast dark shadows.    In her sleep she shivered, and half awoke.    \"Ah, I am not there, I am here,\" she said; and she crept closer to the  rock, and kissed it, and went to sleep again.    It must have been about three o'clock, for the moon had begun to sink  towards the western sky, when she woke, with a violent start. She sat  up, and pressed her hand against her heart.    \"What can it be? A cony must surely have run across my feet and  frightened me!\" she said, and she turned to lie down again; but soon she  sat up. Outside, there was the distinct sound of thorns crackling in a  fire.    She crept to the door and made an opening in the branches with her  fingers.    A large fire was blazing in the shadow, at the foot of the rocks. A  little Bushman sat over some burning coals that had been raked from it,  cooking meat. Stretched on the ground was an Englishman, dressed in a  blouse, and with a heavy, sullen face. On the stone beside him was Dirk,  the Hottentot, sharpening a bowie knife.    She held her breath. Not a cony in all the rocks was so still.    \"They can never find me here,\" she said; and she knelt, and listened to  every word they said. She could hear it all.    \"You may have all the money,\" said the Bushman; \"but I want the cask of  brandy. I will set the roof alight in six places, for a Dutchman burnt  my mother once alive in a hut, with three children.\"    \"You are sure there is no one else on the farm?\" said the navvy.    \"No, I have told you till I am tired,\" said Dirk; \"The two Kaffirs have  gone with the son to town; and the maids have gone to a dance; there is  only the old man and the two women left.\"    \"But suppose,\" said the navvy, \"he should have the gun at his bedside,  and loaded!\"    \"He never has,\" said Dirk; \"it hangs in the passage, and the cartridges  too. He never thought when he bought it what work it was for! I only  wish the little white girl was there still,\" said Dirk; \"but she is  drowned. We traced her footmarks to the great pool that has no bottom.\"    She listened to every word, and they talked on.    Afterwards, the little Bushman, who crouched over the fire, sat up  suddenly, listening.    \"Ha! what is that?\" he said.    A Bushman is like a dog: his ear is so fine he knows a jackal's tread  from a wild dog's.    \"I heard nothing,\" said the navvy.    \"I heard,\" said the Hottentot; \"but it was only a cony on the rocks.\"    \"No cony, no cony,\" said the Bushman; \"see, what is that there moving in  the shade round the point?\"    \"Nothing, you idiot!\" said the navvy. \"Finish your meat; we must start  now.\"    There were two roads to the homestead. One went along the open plain,  and was by far the shortest; but you might be seen half a mile off. The  other ran along the river bank, where there were rocks, and holes, and  willow trees to hide among. And all down the river bank ran a little  figure.    The river was swollen by the storm full to its banks, and the willow  trees dipped their half-drowned branches into its water. Wherever there  was a gap between them, you could see it flow, red and muddy, with the  stumps upon it. But the little figure ran on and on; never looking,  never thinking; panting, panting! There, where the rocks were the  thickest; there, where on the open space the moonlight shone; there,  where the prickly pears were tangled, and the rocks cast shadows, on it  ran; the little hands clinched, the little heart beating, the eyes fixed  always ahead.    It was not far to run now. Only the narrow path between the high rocks  and the river.    At last she came to the end of it, and stood for an instant. Before her  lay the plain, and the red farmhouse, so near, that if persons had been  walking there you might have seen them in the moonlight. She clasped her  hands. \"Yes, I will tell them, I will tell them!\" she said; \"I am almost  there!\" She ran forward again, then hesitated. She shaded her eyes from  the moonlight, and looked. Between her and the farmhouse there were  three figures moving over the low bushes.    In the sheeny moonlight you could see how they moved on, slowly and  furtively; the short one, and the one in light clothes, and the one in  dark.    \"I cannot help them now!\" she cried, and sank down on the ground, with  her little hands clasped before her.    *****    \"Awake, awake!\" said the farmer's wife; \"I hear a strange noise;  something calling, calling, calling!\"    The man rose, and went to the window.    \"I hear it also,\" he said; \"surely some jackal's at the sheep. I will  load my gun and go and see.\"    \"It sounds to me like the cry of no jackal,\" said the woman; and when he  was gone she woke her daughter.    \"Come, let us go and make a fire, I can sleep no more,\" she said; \"I  have heard a strange thing tonight. Your father said it was a jackal's  cry, but no jackal cries so. It was a child's voice, and it cried,  'Master, master, wake!'\"    The women looked at each other; then they went to the kitchen, and made  a great fire; and they sang psalms all the while.    At last the man came back; and they asked him, \"What have you seen?\"  \"Nothing,\" he said, \"but the sheep asleep in their kraals, and the  moonlight on the walls. And yet, it did seem to me,\" he added, \"that  far away near the krantz by the river, I saw three figures moving. And  afterwards--it might have been fancy--I thought I heard the cry again;  but since that, all has been still there.\"    *****    Next day a navvy had returned to the railway works.    \"Where have you been so long?\" his comrades asked.    \"He keeps looking over his shoulder,\" said one, \"as though he thought he  should see something there.\"    \"When he drank his grog today,\" said another, \"he let it fall, and  looked round.\"    Next day, a small old Bushman, and a Hottentot, in ragged yellow  trousers, were at a wayside canteen. When the Bushman had had brandy, he  began to tell how something (he did not say whether it was man, woman,  or child) had lifted up its hands and cried for mercy; had kissed a  white man's hands, and cried to him to help it. Then the Hottentot took  the Bushman by the throat, and dragged him out.    Next night, the moon rose up, and mounted the quiet sky. She was full  now, and looked in at the little home; at the purple flowers stuck about  the room, and the kippersol on the shelf. Her light fell on the willow  trees, and on the high rocks, and on a little new-made heap of earth  and round stones. Three men knew what was under it;"]]]
