But in Eastern Asia the influence of India has been notable in extent,  strength and duration. Scant justice is done to her position in the  world by those histories which recount the exploits of her invaders and  leave the impression that her own people were a feeble, dreamy folk,  sundered from the rest of mankind by their sea and mountain frontiers.  Such a picture takes no account of the intellectual conquests of the  Hindus. Even their political conquests were not contemptible and were  remarkable for the distance if not for the extent of the territory  occupied. For there were Hindu kingdoms in Java and Camboja and  settlements in Sumatra[2] and even in Borneo, an island about as far  from India as is Persia from Rome. But such military or commercial  invasions are insignificant compared with the spread of Indian thought.  The south-eastern region of Asia--both mainland and archipelago--owed its  civilization almost entirely to India. In Ceylon, Burma, Siam, Camboja,  Champa and Java, religion, art, the alphabet, literature, as well as  whatever science and political organization existed, were the direct  gift of Hindus, whether Brahmans or Buddhists, and much the same may be  said of Tibet, whence the wilder Mongols took as much Indian  civilization as they could stomach. In Java and other Malay countries  this Indian culture has been superseded by Islam, yet even in Java the  alphabet and to a large extent the customs of the people are still  Indian.    In the countries mentioned Indian influence has been dominant until the  present day, or at least until the advent of Islam. In another large  area comprising China, Japan, Korea, and Annam it appears as a layer  superimposed on Chinese culture, yet not a mere veneer. In these regions  Chinese ethics, literature and art form the major part of intellectual  life and have an outward and visible sign in the Chinese written  characters which have not been ousted by an Indian alphabet[3]. But in  all, especially in Japan, the influence of Buddhism has been profound  and penetrating. None of these lands can be justly described as Buddhist  in the same sense as Burma or Siam but Buddhism gave them a creed  acceptable in different forms to superstitious, emotional and  metaphysical minds: it provided subjects and models for art, especially  for painting, and entered into popular life, thought and language.    But what are Hinduism and Buddhism? What do they teach about gods and  men and the destinies of the soul? What ideals do they hold up and is  their teaching of value or at least of interest for Europe? I will not  at once answer these questions by general statements, because such names  as Hinduism and Buddhism have different meanings in different countries  and ages, but will rather begin by briefly reviewing the development of  the two religions. I hope that the reader will forgive me if in doing so  I repeat much that is to be found in the body of this work.    One general observation about India may be made at the outset. Here more  than in any other country the national mind finds its favourite  occupation and full expression in religion. This quality is geographical  rather than racial, for it is possessed by Dravidians as much as by  Aryans. From the Raja to the peasant most Hindus have an interest in  theology and often a passion for it. Few works of art or literature are  purely secular: the intellectual and aesthetic efforts of India, long,  continuous and distinguished as they are, are monotonous inasmuch as  they are almost all the expression of some religious phase. But the  religion itself is extraordinarily full and varied. The love of  discussion and speculation creates considerable variety in practice and  almost unlimited variety in creed and theory. There are few dogmas known  to the theologies of the world which are not held by some of India's  multitudinous sects[4] and it is perhaps impossible to make a single  general statement about Hinduism, to which some sects would not prove an  exception. Any such statements in this book must be understood as  referring merely to the great majority of Hindus.    As a form of life and thought Hinduism is definite and unmistakeable. In  whatever shape it presents itself it can be recognized at once. But it  is so vast and multitudinous that only an encyclopedia could describe it  and no formula can summarize it. Essayists flounder among conflicting  propositions such as that sectarianism is the essence of Hinduism or  that no educated Hindu belongs to a sect. Either can easily be proved,  for it may be said of Hinduism, as it has been said of zoology, that you  can prove anything if you merely collect facts which support your theory  and not those which conflict with it. Hence many distinguished writers  err by overestimating the phase which specially interests them. For one  the religious life of India is fundamentally monotheistic and Vishnuite:  for another philosophic Sivaism is its crown and quintessence: a third  maintains with equal truth that all forms of Hinduism are tantric. All  these views are tenable because though Hindu life may be cut up into  castes and sects, Hindu creeds are not mutually exclusive and repellent.  They attract and colour one another.      2. _Origin and Growth of Hinduism_    The earliest product of Indian literature, the Rig Veda, contains the  songs of the Aryan invaders who were beginning to make a home in India.  Though no longer nomads, they had little local sentiment. No cities had  arisen comparable with Babylon or Thebes and we hear little of ancient  kingdoms or dynasties. Many of the gods who occupied so much of their  thoughts were personifications of natural forces such as the sun, wind  and fire, worshipped without temples or images and hence more indefinite  in form, habitation and attributes than the deities of Assyria or Egypt.  The idea of a struggle between good and evil was not prominent. In  Persia, where the original pantheon was almost the same as that of the  Veda, this idea produced monotheism: the minor deities became angels and  the chief deity a Lord of hosts who wages a successful struggle against  an independent but still inferior spirit of evil. But in India the  Spirits of Good and Evil are not thus personified. The world is regarded  less as a battlefield of principles than as a theatre for the display of  natural forces. No one god assumes lordship over the others but all are  seen to be interchangeable--mere names and aspects of something which is  greater than any god.    Indian religion is commonly regarded as the offspring of an Aryan  religion, brought into India by invaders from the north and modified by  contact with Dravidian civilization. The materials at our disposal  hardly permit us to take any other point of view, for the literature of  the Vedic Aryans is relatively ancient and full and we have no  information about the old Dravidians comparable with it. But were our  knowledge less one-sided, we might see that it would be more correct to  describe Indian religion as Dravidian religion stimulated and modified  by the ideas of Aryan invaders. For the greatest deities of Hinduism,  Siva, Krishna, Rama, Durga and some of its most essential doctrines such  as metempsychosis and divine incarnations, are either totally unknown to  the Veda or obscurely adumbrated in it. The chief characteristics of  mature Indian religion are characteristics of an area, not of a race,  and they are not the characteristics of religion in Persia, Greece or  other Aryan lands[5].    Some writers explain Indian religion as the worship of nature spirits,  others as the veneration of the dead. But it is a mistake to see in the  religion of any large area only one origin or impulse. The principles  which in a learned form are championed to-day by various professors  represent thoughts which were creative in early times. In ancient India  there were some whose minds turned to their ancestors and dead friends  while others saw divinity in the wonders of storm, spring and harvest.  Krishna is in the main a product of hero worship, but Siva has no such  historical basis. He personifies the powers of birth and death, of  change, decay and rebirth--in fact all that we include in the prosaic  word nature. Assuredly both these lines of thought--the worship of nature  and of the dead--and perhaps many others existed in ancient India.    By the time of the Upanishads, that is about 600 B.C., we trace three  clear currents in Indian religion which have persisted until the present  day. The first is ritual. This became extraordinarily complicated but  retained its primitive and magical character. The object of an ancient  Indian sacrifice was partly to please the gods but still more to coerce  them by certain acts and formulae[6]. Secondly all Hindus lay stress on  asceticism and self-mortification, as a means of purifying the soul and  obtaining supernatural powers. They have a conviction that every man who  is in earnest about religion and even every student of philosophy must  follow a discipline at least to the extent of observing chastity and  eating only to support life. Severer austerities give clearer insight  into divine mysteries and control over the forces of nature. Europeans  are apt to condemn eastern asceticism as a waste of life but it has had  an important moral effect. The weakness of Hinduism, though not of  Buddhism, is that ethics have so small a place in its fundamental  conceptions. Its deities are not identified with the moral law and the  saint is above that law. But this dangerous doctrine is corrected by the  dogma, which is also a popular conviction, that a saint must be a  passionless ascetic.

THE GOTHS IN SPAIN.      Just about the time when the Romans withdrew from Britain, leaving so  many of their possessions behind them, the Suevi, Alani, and Vandals, at  the invitation of Gerontius, the Roman governor of Spain, burst into  that province over the unguarded passes of the Pyrenees.[1] Close on  their steps followed the Visigoths; whose king, taking in marriage  Placidia, the sister of Honorius, was acknowledged by the helpless  emperor independent ruler of such parts of Southern Gaul and Spain as he  could conquer and keep for himself. The effeminate and luxurious  provincials offered practically no resistance to the fierce Teutons. No  Arthur arose among them, as among the warlike Britons of our own island;  no Viriathus even, as in the struggle for independence against the Roman  Commonwealth. Mariana, the Spanish historian, asserts that they  preferred the rule of the barbarians. However this may be, the various  tribes that invaded the country found no serious opposition among the  Spaniards: the only fighting was between themselves--for the spoil. Many  years of warfare were necessary to decide this important question of  supremacy. Fortunately for Spain, the Vandals, who seem to have been the  fiercest horde and under the ablest leader, rapidly forced their way  southward, and, passing on to fresh conquests, crossed the Straits of  Gibraltar in 429: not, however, before they had utterly overthrown their  rivals, the Suevi, on the river Baetis, and had left an abiding record  of their brief stay in the name Andalusia.        [1] \"Inter barbaros pauperem libertatem quam inter Romanos tributariam      sollicitudinem sustinere.\"--Mariana, apud Dunham, vol i.    For a time it seemed likely that the Suevi, in spite of their late  crushing defeat, would subject to themselves the whole of Spain, but  under Theodoric II. and Euric, the Visigoths definitely asserted their  superiority. Under the latter king the Gothic domination in Spain may be  said to have begun about ten years before the fall of the Western  Empire. But the Goths were as yet by no means in possession of the whole  of Spain. A large part of the south was held by imperialist troops; for,  though the Western Empire had been extinguished in 476, the Eastern  emperor had succeeded by inheritance to all the outlying provinces,  which had even nominally belonged to his rival in the West. Among these  was some portion of Spain.    It was not till 570, the year in which Mohammed was born, that a king  came to the Gothic throne strong enough to crush the Suevi and to reduce  the imperialist garrisons in the South; and it was not till 622, the  very year of the Flight from Mecca, that a Gothic king, Swintila,  finally drove out all the Emperor's troops, and became king in reality  of all Spain.    Scarcely had this been well done, when we perceive the first indications  of the advent of a far more terrible foe, the rumours of whose  irresistible prowess had marched before them. The dread, which the Arabs  aroused even in distant Spain as early as a century after the birth of  Mohammed, may be appreciated from the despairing lines of Julian,[1]  bishop of Toledo:--          \"Hei mihi! quam timeo, ne nos malus implicet error,            Demur et infandis gentibus opprobrio!        Africa plena viris bellacibus arma minatur,            Inque dies victrix gens Agarena furit.\"    Before giving an account of the Saracen invasion and its results, it  will be well to take a brief retrospect of the condition of Christianity  in Spain under the Gothic domination, and previous to the advent of the  Moslems.        [1] Migne's \"Patrologie,\" vol. xcvi. p. 814.    There can be no doubt that Christianity was brought very early into  Spain by the preaching, as is supposed, of St Paul himself, who is said  to have made a missionary journey through Andalusia, Valencia, and  Aragon. On the other hand, there are no grounds whatever for supposing  that James, the brother of John, ever set foot in Spain. The \"invention\"  of his remains at Ira Flavia in the 9th century, together with the story  framed to account for their presence in a remote corner of Spain so far  from the scene of the Apostle's martyrdom, is a fable too childish to  need refutation.    The honour of first hearing the Gospel message has been claimed (but, it  seems, against probability) for Illiberis.[1] However that may be, the  early establishment of Christianity in Spain is attested by Irenaeus, who  appeals to the Spanish Church as retaining the primitive doctrine.[2]  The long roll of Spanish martyrs begins in the persecution of Domitian  (95 A.D.) with the name of Eugenius, bishop of Toledo. In most of the  succeeding persecutions Spain furnished her full quota of martyrs, but  she suffered most under Diocletian (303). It was in this emperor's reign  that nearly all the inhabitants of Caesar Augusta were treacherously  slaughtered on the sole ground of their being Christians; thus earning  for their native city from the Christian poet Prudentius,[3] the proud  title of \"patria sanctorum martyrum.\"        [1] Florez, \"Espana Sagrada,\" vol. iii. pp. 361 ff.        [2] Bk. I. ch. x. 2 (A.D. 186).        [3] 348-402 A.D.    The persecution of Diocletian, though the fiercest, was at the same time  the last, which afflicted the Church under the Roman Empire. Diocletian  indeed proclaimed that he had blotted out the very name of Christian and  abolished their hateful superstition. This even to the Romans must have  seemed an empty boast, and the result of Diocletian's efforts only  proved the truth of the old maxim--\"the blood of martyrs is the seed of  the Church.\"    The Spanish Christians about this time[1] held the first ecclesiastical  council whose acts have come down to us. This Council of Illiberis, or  Elvira, was composed of nineteen bishops and thirty-six presbyters, who  passed eighty canons.        [1] The date is doubtful. Blunt, \"Early Christianity,\" p. 209,      places it between 314 and 325, though in a hesitating manner.      Other dates given are 300 and 305.    The imperial edict of toleration was issued in 313, and in 325 was held  the first General Council of the Church under the presidency of the  emperor, Constantine, himself an avowed Christian. Within a quarter of a  century of the time when Diocletian had boasted that he had extirpated  the Christian name, it has been computed that nearly one half of the  inhabitants of his empire were Christians.    The toleration, so long clamoured for, so lately conceded, was in 341  put an end to by the Christians themselves, and Pagan sacrifices were  prohibited. So inconsistent is the conduct of a church militant and a  church triumphant! In 388, after a brief eclipse under Julian,  Christianity was formally declared by the Senate to be the established  religion of the Roman Empire.    But the security, or rather predominance, thus suddenly acquired by the  church, resting as it did in part upon royal favour and court intrigue,  did not tend to the spiritual advancement of Christianity. Almost  coincident with the Edict of Milan was the appearance of Arianism,  which, after dividing the Church against itself for upwards of  half-a-century, and almost succeeding at one time in imposing itself on  the whole Church,[1] finally under the missionary zeal of Ulphilas found  a new life among the barbarian nations that were pressing in upon all  the northern boundaries of the Empire, ready, like eagles, to swoop down  and feast upon her mighty carcase.        [1] At the Council of Rimini in 360. \"Ingemuit totus orbis,\"      says Jerome, \"et Arianum se esse miratus est.\"    Most of these barbaric hordes, like the Goths and the Vandals, adopted  the semi-Arian Christianity first preached to them by Ulphilas towards  the close of the fourth century. Consequently the nations that forced  their way into Southern Gaul, and over the Pyrenees into Spain, were,  nominally at "]]]
