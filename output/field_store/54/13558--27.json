To win such followers he can appear to men in any form he  pleases, can deceive them, enter into compact with them, initiate them  into his worship, make them his allies for the ruin of their fellows.  Now it is these human allies and servants of Satan, thus postulated into  existence by the brain of a monkish logician, whom history knows as  witches.\" _The Literature of Witchcraft_, BURR.      Witchcraft in its generic sense is as old as human history. It has  written its name in the oldest of human records. In all ages and among  all peoples it has taken firm hold on the fears, convictions and  consciences of men. Anchored in credulity and superstition, in the dread  and love of mystery, in the hard and fast theologic doctrines and  teachings of diabolism, and under the ban of the law from its beginning,  it has borne a baleful fruitage in the lives of the learned and the  unlearned, the wise and the simple.    King and prophet, prelate and priest, jurist and lawmaker, prince and  peasant, scholars and men of affairs have felt and dreaded its subtle  power, and sought relief in code and commandment, bull and anathema,  decree and statute--entailing even the penalty of death--and all in vain  until in the march of the races to a higher civilization, the centuries  enthroned faith in the place of fear, wisdom in the place of ignorance,  and sanity in the seat of delusion.    In its earlier historic conception witchcraft and its demonstrations  centered in the claim of power to produce certain effects, \"things  beyond the course of nature,\" from supernatural causes, and under this  general term all its occult manifestations were classified with magic  and sorcery, until the time came when the Devil was identified and  acknowledged both in church and state as the originator and sponsor of  the mystery, sin and crime--the sole father of the Satanic compacts with  men and women, and the law both canonical and civil took cognizance of  his malevolent activities.    In the Acropolis mound at Susa in ancient Elam, in the winter of 1901-2,  there was brought to light by the French expedition in charge of the  eminent savant, M. de Morgan, one of the most remarkable memorials of  early civilization ever recovered from the buried cities of the Orient.    It is a monolith--a stele of black diorite--bearing in bas-relief a  likeness of Hammurabi (the Amrephel of the Old Testament; Genesis xiv, 1),  and the sixth king of the first Babylonian dynasty, who reigned  about 2250 B.C.; and there is also carved upon it, in archaic script in  black letter cuneiform--used long after the cursive writing was  invented--the longest Babylonian record discovered to this day,--the  oldest body of laws in existence and the basis of historical  jurisprudence.    It is a remarkable code, quickly made available through translation and  transliteration by the Assyrian scholars, and justly named, from its  royal compiler, Hammurabi's code. He was an imperialist in purpose and  action, and in the last of his reign of fifty-five years he annexed or  assimilated the suzerainty of Elam, or Southern Persia, with Assyria to  the north, and also Syria and Palestine, to the Mediterranean Sea.    This record in stone originally contained nineteen columns of  inscriptions of four thousand three hundred and fourteen lines, arranged  in two hundred and eighty sections, covering about two hundred separate  decisions or edicts. There is substantial evidence that many of the laws  were of greater antiquity than the code itself, which is a thousand  years older than the Mosaic code, and there are many striking  resemblances and parallels between its provisions, and the law of the  covenant, and the deuteronomy laws of the Hebrews.    The code was based on personal responsibility. It protects the sanctity  of an oath before God, provides among many other things for written  evidence in legal matters, and is wonderfully comprehensive and rich in  rules for the conduct of commercial, civic, financial, social, economic,  and domestic affairs.    These sections are notably illustrative:    \"If a man, in a case (pending judgment), utters threats against the  witnesses (or), does not establish the testimony that he has given, if  that case be a case involving life, that man shall be put to death.    \"If a judge pronounces a judgment, renders a decision, delivers a  verdict duly signed and sealed and afterwards alters his judgment, they  shall call that judge to account for the alteration of the judgment  which he had pronounced, and he shall pay twelvefold the penalty which  was in the said judgment, and, in the assembly, they shall expel him  from his seat of judgment, and he shall not return, and with the judges  in a case he shall not take his seat.    \"If a man practices brigandage and is captured, that man shall be put to  death.    \"If a woman hates her husband, and says: 'thou shalt not have me,' they  shall inquire into her antecedents for her defects; and if she has been  a careful mistress and is without reproach and her husband has been  going about and greatly belittling her, that woman has no blame. She  shall receive her presents and shall go to her father's house.    \"If she has not been a careful mistress, has gadded about, has neglected  her house and has belittled her husband, they shall throw that woman  into the water.    \"If a physician operates on a man for a severe wound with a bronze  lancet and causes the man's death, or opens an abscess (in the eye) of a  man with a bronze lancet and destroys the man's eye, they shall cut off  his fingers.    \"If a builder builds a house for a man and does not make its  construction firm and the house, which he has built, collapses and  causes the death of the owner of the house, that builder shall be put to  death.\"    It is, however, with only one of King Hammurabi's wise laws that this  inquiry has to do, and it is this:    \"If a man has placed an enchantment upon a man, and has not justified  himself, he upon whom the enchantment is placed to the Holy River  (Euphrates) shall go; into the Holy River he shall plunge. If the Holy  River holds (drowns) him he who enchanted him shall take his house. If  on the contrary, the man is safe and thus is innocent, the wizard loses  his life, and his house.\"    Or, as another translation has it:    \"If a man ban a man and cast a spell on him--if he cannot justify it he  who has banned shall be killed.\"    \"If a man has cast a spell on a man and has not justified it, he on whom  the spell has been thrown shall go to the River God, and plunge into the  river. If the River God takes him he who has banned him shall be saved.  If the River God show him to be innocent, and he be saved, he who banned  him shall be killed, and he who plunged into the river shall take the  house of him who banned him.\"    There can be no more convincing evidence of the presence and power of  the great witchcraft superstition among the primitive races than this  earliest law; and it is to be especially noted that it prescribes one of  the very tests of guilt--the proof by water--which was used in another  form centuries later, on the continent, in England and New England, at  Wurzburg and Bonn, at Rouen, in Suffolk, Essex and Devon, and at Salem  and Hartford and Fairfield, when \"the Devil starteth himself up in the  pulpit, like a meikle black man, and calling the row (roll) everyone  answered, Here!\"          CHAPTER II    \"To deny the possibility, nay actual evidence of witchcraft and sorcery,  is at once to flatly contradict the revealed word of God in various  passages both of the Old and New Testaments.\" _Blackstone's  Commentaries_ (Vol. 4, ch. 4, p. 60).    \"It was simply the natural result of Puritanical teaching acting on the  mind, predisposing men to see Satanic influence in life, and  consequently eliciting the phenomena of witchcraft.\" LECKY's  _Rationalism in Europe_ (Vol. I, p. 123).      Witchcraft's reign in many lands and among many peoples is also attested  in its remarkable nomenclature. Consider its range in ancient, medieval  and modern thought as shown in some of its definitions: Magic, sorcery,  soothsaying, necromancy, astrology, wizardry, mysticism, occultism, and  conjuring, of the early and middle ages; compacts with Satan, consorting  with evil spirits, and familiarity with the Devil, of later times; all  at last ripening into an epidemic"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12293"],[0,"Old Cookery Books and Ancient Cuisine (#2)"],[1,"bstances, green stuff and milk, as well as a gradual  dissipation of the prejudice against the hare, the goose, and the  hen as articles of food, which the \"Commentaries\" record. It is  characteristic of the nature of our nationality, however, that while  the Anglo-Saxons and their successors refused to confine themselves  to the fare which was more or less adequate to the purposes of  archaic pastoral life in this island, they by no means renounced their  partiality for farm and garden produce, but by a fusion of culinary  tastes and experiences akin to fusion of race and blood, laid the  basis of the splendid _cuisine_ of the Plantagenet and Tudor periods.  Our cookery is, like our tongue, an amalgam.    But the Roman historian saw little or nothing of our country except  those portions which lay along or near the southern coast; the rest of  his narrative was founded on hearsay; and he admits that the people in  the interior--those beyond the range of his personal knowledge, more  particularly the northern tribes and the Scots--were flesh-eaters,  by which he probably intends, not consumers of cattle, but of the  venison, game, and fish which abounded in their forests and rivers.  The various parts of this country were in Caesar's day, and very long  after, more distinct from each other for all purposes of communication  and intercourse than we are now from Spain or from Switzerland; and  the foreign influences which affected the South Britons made no mark  on those petty states which lay at a distance, and whose diet was  governed by purely local conditions. The dwellers northward were by  nature hunters and fishermen, and became only by Act of Parliament  poachers, smugglers, and illicit distillers; the province of the male  portion of the family was to find food for the rest; and a pair of  spurs laid on an empty trencher was well understood by the goodman as  a token that the larder was empty and replenishable.    There are new books on all subjects, of which it is comparatively easy  within a moderate compass to afford an intelligible, perhaps even  a sufficient, account. But there are others which I, for my part,  hesitate to touch, and which do not seem to be amenable to the law  of selection. \"Studies in Nidderland,\" by Mr. Joseph Lucas, is one of  these. It was a labour of love, and it is full of records of singular  survivals to our time of archaisms of all descriptions, culinary and  gardening utensils not forgotten. There is one point, which I may  perhaps advert to, and it is the square of wood with a handle, which  the folk in that part of Yorkshire employed, in lieu of the ladle, for  stirring, and the stone ovens for baking, which, the author tells us,  occur also in a part of Surrey. But the volume should be read as a  whole. We have of such too few.    Under the name of a Roman epicure, Coelius Apicius, has come down  to us what may be accepted as the most ancient European \"Book of  Cookery.\" I think that the idea widely entertained as to this work  having proceeded from the pen of a man, after whom it was christened,  has no more substantial basis than a theory would have that the  \"Arabian Nights\" were composed by Haroun al Raschid. Warner, in the  introduction to his \"Antiquitates Culinariae,\" 1791, adduces as a  specimen of the rest two receipts from this collection, shewing how  the Roman cook of the Apician epoch was wont to dress a hog's paunch,  and to manufacture sauce for a boiled chicken. Of the three persons  who bore the name, it seems to be thought most likely that the one who  lived under Trajan was the true godfather of the Culinary Manual.    One of Massinger's characters (Holdfast) in the \"City Madam,\" 1658,  is made to charge the gourmets of his time with all the sins of  extravagance perpetrated in their most luxurious and fantastic  epoch. The object was to amuse the audience; but in England no \"court  gluttony,\" much less country Christmas, ever saw buttered eggs which  had cost L30, or pies of carps' tongues, or pheasants drenched with  ambergris, or sauce for a peacock made of the gravy of three fat  wethers, or sucking pigs at twenty marks each.    Both Apicius and our Joe Miller died within L80,000 of being  beggars--Miller something the nigher to that goal; and there was this  community of insincerity also, that neither really wrote the books  which carry their names. Miller could not make a joke or understand  one when anybody else made it. His Roman foregoer, who would certainly  never have gone for his dinner to Clare Market, relished good dishes,  even if he could not cook them.    It appears not unlikely that the Romish clergy, whose monastic  vows committed them to a secluded life, were thus led to seek some  compensation for the loss of other worldly pleasures in those of the  table; and that, when one considers the luxury of the old abbeys, one  ought to recollect at the same time, that it was perhaps in this case  as it was in regard to letters and the arts, and that we are under a  certain amount of obligation to the monks for modifying the barbarism  of the table, and encouraging a study of gastronomy.    There are more ways to fame than even Horace suspected. The road to  immortality is not one but manifold. A man can but do what he can. As  the poet writes and the painter fills with his inspiration the  mute and void canvas, so doth the Cook his part. There was formerly  apopular work in France entitled \"Le Cuisinier Royal,\" by MM. Viard  and Fouret, who describe themselves as \"Hommes de Bouche.\" The  twelfth edition lies before me, a thick octavo volume, dated 1805. The  title-page is succeeded by an anonymous address to the reader, at the  foot of which occurs a peremptory warning to pilferers of dishes or  parts thereof; in other words, to piratical invaders of the copyright  of Monsieur Barba. There is a preface equally unclaimed by signatures  or initials, but as it is in the singular number the two _hommes  de bouche_ can scarcely have written it; perchance it was M. Barba  aforesaid, lord-proprietor of these not-to-be-touched treasures; but  anyhow the writer had a very solemn feeling of the debt which he had  conferred on society by making the contents public for the twelfth  time, and he concludes with a mixture of sentiments, which it is very  difficult to define: \"Dans la paix de ma conscience, non moins que  dans l'orgueil d'avoir si honorablement rempli cette importante  mission, je m'ecrierai avec le poete des gourmands et des amoureux:      \"Exegi monumentum aere perennius    Non omnis moriar.\"            THE EARLY ENGLISHMAN AND HIS FOOD.      William of Malmesbury particularly dwells on the broad line of  distinction still existing between the southern English and the folk  of the more northerly districts in his day, twelve hundred years after  the visit of Caesar. He says that they were then (about A.D. 1150)  as different as if they had been different races; and so in fact they  were--different in their origin, in their language, and their diet.    In his \"Folk-lore Relics of Early Village Life,\" 1883, Mr. Gomme  devotes a chapter to \"Early Domestic Customs,\" and quotes Henry's  \"History of Great Britain\" for a highly curious clue to the primitive  mode of dressing food, and partaking of it, among the Britons. Among  the Anglo-Saxons the choice of poultry and game was fairly wide.  Alexander Neckani, in his \"Treatise on Utensils (twelfth century)\"  gives fowls, cocks, peacocks, the cock of the wood (the woodcock, not  the capercailzie), thrushes, pheasants, and several more; and pigeons  were only too plentiful. The hare and the rabbit were well enough  known, and with the leveret form part of an enumeration of wild  animals (_animalium ferarum_) in a pictorial vocabulary of the  fifteenth century. But in the very early accounts or lists, although  they must have soon been brought into requisition, they are not  specifically cited as current dishes. How far this is attributable to  the alleged repugnance of the Britons to use the hare for the table,  as Caesar apprises us that they kept it only _voluptatis causa_, it  is hard to say; but the way in which the author of the \"Commentaries\"  puts it induces the persuasion that by _lepus_ he means not the hare,  but the rabbit, as the former would scarcely be domesticated.    Neckam gives very minute directions for the preparation of pork for  the table. He appears to have considered that broiling on the grill  was the best way; the gridiron had supplanted the hot stones or  bricks in more fashionable households, and he recommends a brisk fire,  perhaps with an eye to the skilful development of the crackling. He  died without the happiness of bringing his archi-episcopal nostrils in  contact with the sage and onions of wiser generations, and thinks  that a little salt is enough. But, as we have before explained, Neckam  prescribed for great folks. These refinements were unknown beyond the  precincts of the palace and the castle.    In the ancient cookery-book, the \"Menagier de Paris,\" 1393, which  offers numerous points of similarity to our native culinary lore, the  resources of the cuisine are represented as amplified by receipts  for dressing hedgehogs, squirrels, magpies, and jackdaws--small deer,  which the English experts did not affect, although I believe that the  hedgehog is frequently used to this day by country folk, both here and  abroad, and in India. It has white, rabbit-like flesh.    In an eleventh century vocabulary we meet with a tolerably rich  variety of fish, of which the consumption was relatively larger in  former times. The Saxons fished both with the basket and the net.  Among the fish here enumerated are the whale (which was largely used  for food), the dolphin, porpoise, crab, oyster, herring, cockle,  smelt, and eel. But in the supplement to Alfric's vocabulary, and in  another belonging to the same epoch, there are important additions  to this list: the"]]]
