She said, there was no  power but the sun, moon and stars; that they made all our country.--I  then enquired how all our people came? She answered me, from one  another; and so carried me to many generations back.--Then says I, who  made the _First Man_? and who made the first Cow, and the first Lyon,  and where does the fly come from, as no one can make him? My mother  seemed in great trouble; she was apprehensive that my senses were  impaired, or that I was foolish. My father came in, and seeing her in  grief asked the cause, but when she related our conversation to him, he  was exceedingly angry with me, and told me he would punish me severely  if ever I was so troublesome again; so that I resolved never to say any  thing more to him. But I grew very unhappy in myself; my relations and  acquaintance endeavoured by all the means they could think on, to divert  me, by taking me to ride upon goats, (which is much the custom of our  country) and to shoot with a bow and arrow; but I experienced no  satisfaction at all in any of these things; nor could I be easy by any  means whatever: my parents were very unhappy to see me so dejected and  melancholy.    About this time there came a merchant from the _Gold Coast_ (the third  city in Guinea) he traded with the inhabitants of our country in ivory  &c. he took great notice of my unhappy situation, and enquired into the  cause; he expressed vast concern for me, and said, if my parents would  part with me for a little while, and let him take me home with him, it  would be of more service to me than any thing they could do for me.--He  told me that if I would go with him I should see houses with wings to  them walk upon the water, and should also see the white folks; and that  he had many sons of my age, which should be my companions; and he added  to all this that he would bring me safe back again soon.--I was highly  pleased with the account of this strange place, and was very desirous of  going.--I seemed sensible of a secret impulse upon my mind which I could  not resist that seemed to tell me I must go. When my dear mother saw  that I was willing to leave them, she spoke to my father and grandfather  and the rest of my relations, who all agreed that I should accompany the  merchant to the Gold Coast. I was the more willing as my brothers and  sisters despised me, and looked on me with contempt on the account of my  unhappy disposition; and even my servants slighted me, and disregarded  all I said to them. I had one sister who was always exceeding fond of  me, and I loved her entirely; her name was Logwy, she was quite white,  and fair, with fine light hair though my father and mother were  black.--I was truly concerned to leave my beloved sister, and she cry'd  most sadly to part with me, wringing her hands, and discovered every  sign of grief that can be imagined. Indeed if I could have known when I  left my friends and country that I should never return to them again my  misery on that occasion would have been inexpressible. All my relations  were sorry to part with me; my dear mother came with me upon a camel  more than three hundred miles, the first of our journey lay chiefly  through woods: at night we secured ourselves from the wild beasts by  making fires all around us; we and our camels kept within the circle, or  we must have been torn to pieces by the Lyons, and other wild creatures,  that roared terribly as soon as night came on, and continued to do so  'till morning.--There can be little said in favour of the country  through which we passed; only a valley of marble that we came through  which is unspeakably beautiful.--On each side of this valley are  exceedingly high and almost inaccessible mountains--Some of these pieces  of marble are of prodigious length and breadth but of different sizes  and colour, and shaped in a variety of forms, in a wonderful manner.--It  is most of it veined with gold mixed with striking and beautiful  colours; so that when the sun darts upon it, it is as pleasing a sight  as can be imagined.--The merchant that brought me from Bournou, was in  partnership with another gentleman who accompanied us; he was very  unwilling that he should take me from home, as, he said, he foresaw many  difficulties that would attend my going with them.--He endeavoured to  prevail on the merchant to throw me into a very deep pit that was in the  valley, but he refused to listen to him, and said, he was resolved to  take care of me: but the other was greatly dissatisfied; and when we  came to a river, which we were obliged to pass through, he purpos'd  throwing me in and drowning me; but the Merchant would not consent to  it, so that I was preserv'd.    We travel'd 'till about four o'clock every day, and then began to make  preparations for night, by cutting down large quantities of wood, to  make fires to preserve us from the wild beasts.--I had a very unhappy  and discontented journey, being in continual fear that the people I was  with would murder me. I often reflected with extreme regret on the kind  friends I had left, and the idea of my dear mother frequently drew tears  from my eyes.--I cannot recollect how long we were in going from Bournou  to the Gold Coast; but as there is no shipping nearer to Bournou than  that City, it was tedious in travelling so far by land, being upwards of  a thousand miles.--I was heartily rejoic'd when we arriv'd at the end of  our journey: I now vainly imagin'd that all my troubles and inquietudes  would terminate here; but could I have looked into futurity, I should  have perceiv'd that I had much more to suffer than I had before  experienc'd, and that they had as yet but barely commenc'd.    I was now more than a thousand miles from home, without a friend or any  means to procure one. Soon after I came to the merchant's house I heard  the drums beat remarkably loud, and the trumpets blow--the persons  accustom'd to this employ, are oblig'd to go upon a very high structure  appointed for that purpose, that the sound might be heard at a great  distance: They are higher than the steeples are in England. I was  mightily pleas'd with sounds so entirely new to me, and was very  inquisitive to know the cause of this rejoicing, and ask'd many  questions concerning it: I was answer'd that it was meant as a  compliment to me, because I was Grandson to the King of Bournou.    This account gave me a secret pleasure; but I was not suffer'd long to  enjoy this satisfaction, for in the evening of the same day, two of the  merchant's sons (boys about my own age) came running to me, and told me,  that the next day I was to die, for the King intended to behead me.--I  reply'd that I was sure it could not be true, for that I came there to  play with them, and to see houses walk upon the water with wings to  them, and the white folks; but I was soon inform'd that their King  imagined that I was sent by my father as a spy, and would make such  discoveries at my return home that would enable them to make war with  the greater advantage to ourselves; and for these reasons he had  resolved I should never return to my native country.--When I heard this  I suffered misery that cannot be described.--I wished a thousand times  that I had never left my friends and country.--But still the Almighty  was pleased to work miracles for me.    The morning I was to die, I was washed and all my gold ornaments made  bright and shining, and then carried to the palace, where the King was  to behead me himself (as is the custom of the place).--He was seated  upon a throne at the top of an exceeding large yard, or court, which you  must go through to enter the palace, it is as wide and spacious as a  large field in England.--I had a lane of lifeguards to go through.--I  guessed it to be about three hundred paces.    I was conducted by my friend, the merchant, about half way up; then he  durst proceed no further: I went up to the King alone--I went with an  undaunted courage, and it pleased God to melt the heart of the King, who  sat with his scymitar in his hand ready to behead me; yet, being himself  so affected, he dropped it out of his hand, and took me upon his knee  and wept over me. I put my right hand round his neck, and prest him to  my heart.--He sat me down and blest me; and added that he would not kill  me, and that I should not go home, but be sold, for a slave, so then I  was conducted back again to the merchant's house.    The next day he took me on board a French brig; but the Captain did not  chuse to buy me: he said I was too small; so the merchant took me home  with him again.    The partner, whom I have spoken of as my enemy, was very angry to see me  return, and again purposed putting an end to my life; for he represented  to the other, that I should bring them into troubles and difficulties,  and that I was so little that no person would buy me.    The merchant's resolution began to waver, and I was indeed afraid that I  should be put to death: but however he said he would try me once more.    A few days after a Dutch ship came into the harbour, and they carried me  on board, in hopes that the Captain would purchase me.--As they went, I  heard them agree, that, if they could not sell me _then_, they would  throw me overboard.--I was in extreme agonies when I heard this; and as  soon as ever I saw the Dutch Captain, I ran to him, and put my arms  round him, and said, \"father, save me.\" (for I knew that if he did not  buy me, I should be treated very ill, or, possibly, murdered) And though  he did not understand my language, yet it pleased the Almighty to  influence him in my behalf, and he bought me _for two yards of check_,  which is of more value _there_, than in England.    When I left my dear mother I had a large quantity of gold about me, as  is the custom of our country, it was made into rings, and they were  linked into one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15043"],[0,"The Works of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke, Vol. 01 (of 12) (#2)"],[1," parcel some latitude of discretion in subordinate points was  necessarily used.    There is, however, a considerable member for the greater part of which  Mr. Burke's reputation is not responsible: this is the inquiry into the  condition of the higher classes, which commences in the two hundred and  ninety-fifth page.[4] The summary of the whole topic, indeed, nearly as  it stands in the three hundred and seventy-third and fourth pages,[5]  was found, together with a marginal reference to the Bankrupt List, in  his own handwriting; and the actual conclusion of the Letter was  dictated by him, but never received his subsequent correction. He had  also preserved, as materials for this branch of his subject, some  scattered hints, documents, and parts of a correspondence on the state  of the country. He was, however, prevented from working on them by the  want of some authentic and official information, for which he had been  long anxiously waiting, in order to ascertain, to the satisfaction of  the public, what, with his usual sagacity, he had fully anticipated from  his own personal observation, to his own private conviction. At length  the reports of the different committees which had been appointed by the  two Houses of Parliament amply furnished him with evidence for this  purpose. Accordingly he read and considered them with attention: but for  anything beyond this the season was now past. The Supreme Disposer of  All, against whose inscrutable counsels it is vain as well as impious to  murmur, did not permit him to enter on the execution of the task which  he meditated. It was resolved, therefore, by one of his friends, after  much hesitation, and under a very painful responsibility, to make such  an attempt as he could at supplying the void; especially because the  insufficiency of our resources for the continuance of the war was  understood to have been the principal objection urged against the two  former Letters on the Proposals for Peace. In performing with  reverential diffidence this duty of friendship, care has been taken not  to attribute to Mr. Burke any sentiment which is not most explicitly  known, from repeated conversations, and from much correspondence, to  have been decidedly entertained by that illustrious man. One passage of  nearly three pages, containing a censure of our defensive system, is  borrowed from a private letter, which he began to dictate with an  intention of comprising in it the short result of his opinions, but  which he afterwards abandoned, when, a little time before his death, his  health appeared in some degree to amend, and he hoped that Providence  might have spared him at least to complete the larger public letter,  which he then proposed to resume.    In the preface to the former edition of this Letter a fourth was  mentioned as being in possession of Mr. Burke's friends. It was in fact  announced by the author himself, in the conclusion of the second, which  it was then designed to follow. He intended, he said, to proceed next on  the question of the facilities possessed by the French Republic, _from  the internal state of other nations, and particularly of this_, for  obtaining her ends,--and as his notions were controverted, to take  notice of what, in that way, had been recommended to him. The vehicle  which he had chosen for this part of his plan was an answer to a  pamphlet which was supposed to come from high authority, and was  circulated by ministers with great industry, at the time of its  appearance, in October, 1795, immediately previous to that session of  Parliament when his Majesty for the first time declared that the  appearance of any disposition in the enemy to negotiate for general  peace should not fail to be met with an earnest desire to give it the  fullest and speediest effect. In truth, the answer, which is full of  spirit and vivacity, was written the latter end of the same year, but  was laid aside when the question assumed a more serious aspect, from the  commencement of an actual negotiation, which gave rise to the series of  printed letters. Afterwards, he began to rewrite it, with a view of  accommodating it to his new purpose. The greater part, however, still  remained in its original state; and several heroes of the Revolution,  who are there celebrated, having in the interval passed off the public  stage, a greater liberty of insertion and alteration than his friends on  consideration have thought allowable would be necessary to adapt it to  that place in the series for which it was ultimately designed by the  author. This piece, therefore, addressed, as the title originally stood,  to his noble friend, Earl Fitzwilliam, will be given the first in the  supplemental volumes which will be hereafter added to complete this  edition of the author's works.    The tracts, most of them in manuscript, which have been already selected  as fit for this purpose, will probably furnish four or five volumes  more, to be printed uniformly with this edition. The principal piece is  an Essay on the History of England, from the earliest period to the  conclusion of the reign of King John. It is written with much depth of  antiquarian research, directed by the mind of an intelligent statesman.  This alone, as far as can be conjectured, will form more than one  volume. Another entire volume also, at least, will be filled with his  letters to public men on public affairs, especially those of France.  This supplement will be sent to the press without delay.    Mr. Burke's more familiar correspondence will be reserved as authorities  to accompany a narrative of his life, which will conclude the whole. The  period during which he flourished was one of the most memorable of our  annals. It comprehended the acquisition of one empire in the East, the  loss of another in the West, and the total subversion of the ancient  system of Europe by the French Revolution, with all which events the  history of his life is necessarily and intimately connected,--as indeed  it also is, much more than is generally known, with the state of  literature and the elegant arts. Such a subject of biography cannot be  dismissed with a slight and rapid touch; nor can it be treated in a  manner worthy of it, from the information, however authentic and  extensive, which the industry of any one man may have accumulated. Many  important communications have been received; but some materials, which  relate to the pursuits of his early years, and which are known to be in  existence, have been hitherto kept back, notwithstanding repeated  inquiries and applications. It is, therefore, once more earnestly  requested, that all persons who call themselves the friends or admirers  of the late Edmund Burke will have the goodness to transmit, without  delay, any notices of that or of any other kind which may happen to be  in their possession or within their reach, to Messrs. Rivingtons,--a  respect and kindness to his memory which will be thankfully acknowledged  by those friends to whom, in dying, he committed the sacred trust of his  reputation.    FOOTNOTES:    [1] Prefixed to the first octavo edition: London, F. and C. Rivington,  1801: comprising Vols. I.-VIII. of the edition in sixteen volumes issued  by these publishers at intervals between the years 1801 and 1827.    [2] Comprising the last four papers of the fourth volume, and the whole  of the fifth volume, of the present edition.    [3] The former comprising the matter included between the paragraph  commencing, \"I hear it has been said,\" &c., and that ending with the  words, \"there were little or no materials\"; and the latter extending  through the paragraph concluding with the words, \"disgraced and plagued  mankind.\"    [4] At the paragraph commencing with the words, \"In turning our view  from the lower to the higher classes,\" &c.    [5] In the first half of the paragraph commencing, \"If, then, the real  state of this nation,\" &c.          ADVERTISEMENT    TO THE SECOND OCTAVO EDITION.[6]      A new edition of the works of Mr. Burke having been called for by the  public, the opportunity has been taken to make some slight changes, it  is hoped for the better.    A different distribution of the contents, while it has made the volumes,  with the exception of the first and sixth, more nearly equal in their  respective bulk, has, at the same time, been fortunately found to  produce a more methodical arrangement of the whole. The first and second  volumes, as before, severally contain those literary and philosophical  works by which Mr. Burke was known previous to the commencement of his  public life as a statesman, and the political pieces which were written  by him between the time of his first becoming connected with the Marquis  of Rockingham and his being chosen member for Bristol. In the third are  comprehended all his speeches and pamphlets from his first arrival at  Bristol, as a candidate, in the year 1774, to his farewell address from  the hustings of that city, in the year 1780. What he himself published  relative to the affairs of India occupies the fourth volume. The  remaining four comprise his works since the French Revolution, with the  exception of the Letter to Lord Kenmare on the Penal Laws against Irish  Catholics, which was probably inserted where it stands from its relation  to the subject of the Letter addressed by him, at a later period, to Sir  Hercules Langrishe. With the same exception, too, strict regard has been  paid to chronological order, which, in the last edition, was in some  instances broken, to insert pieces that wore not discovered till it was  too late to introduce them in their proper places.    In the Appendix to the Speech on the Nabob of Arcot's Debts the  references were found to be confused, and, in many places, erroneous.  This probably had arisen from the circumstance that a larger and  differently constructed appendix seems to have been originally designed  by Mr. Burke, which, however, he"]]]
