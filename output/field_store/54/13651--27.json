The Imperial will met with hindrance, and he  contented himself with taking children of the German race from his own  dominions. The pride of the Russians did not suffer in consequence.    While poetry naturally precedes dramatic art, the drama, on the other  hand, cannot attain any degree of excellence where the theater is in  such a miserable state. It is now scarcely half a century since the  effort was begun to remove the total want of scientific culture in  the Russian nation, but what are fifty years for such a purpose, in  so enormous a country? The number of those who have received the  scientific stimulus and been carried to a degree of intellectual  refinement is very small, and the happy accident by which a man of  genius appears among the small number must be very rare. And in this  connection it is noteworthy, that the Russian who feels himself  called to artistic production almost always shows a tendency to epic  composition.    The difficulties of form appear terrible to the Russian. In  romance-writing the form embarrasses him less, and accordingly they  almost all throw themselves into the making of novels.    As is generally the case in the beginning of every nation's  literature, any writer in Russia is taken for a miracle, and regarded  with stupor. The dramatist Kukolnik is an example of this. He has  written a great deal for the theater, but nothing in him is to be  praised so much as his zeal in imitation. It must be admitted that in  this he possesses a remarkable degree of dexterity. He soon turned to  the favorite sphere of romance writing, but in this also he manifests  the national weakness. In every one of his countless works the most  striking feature is the lack of organization. They were begun and  completed without their author's ever thinking out a plot, or its mode  of treatment.    Kukolnik's \"Alf and Adona,\" in which at least one hundred and fifty  characters are brought upon the stage, has not one whose appearance is  designed to concentrate the interest of the audience. Each comes in to  show himself, and goes out not to be in the way any longer. Everything  is described and explained with equal minuteness, from the pile of  cabbages by the wayside, to the murder of a prince; and instead of a  historical action there is nothing but unconnected details. The same  is the case with his \"Eveline and Baillerole,\" in which Cardinal  Richelieu is represented as a destroyer of the aristocracy, and which  also is made up of countless unconnected scenes, that in part are  certainly done with some neatness. These remarks apply to the works  of Iwan Wanenko and I. Boriczewski, to I. Zchewen's \"Sunshine\", five  volumes strong; to the compositions of Wolkow, Czerujawski, Ulitinins,  Th. Van Dim, (a pseudonym,) in fact to everything that has yet  appeared.    On the part of the Imperial family, as we have already said,  everything has been done for the Russian stage that could possibly be  done, and is done no where else. The extremest liberality favors the  artists, schools are provided in order to raise them from the domain  of gross buffoonery to that of true art, the most magnificent premiums  are given to the best, actors are made equal in rank to officers of  state, they are held only to twenty-five years' service, reckoning  from their debut,--and finally, they receive for the rest of their  lives a pension equal to their full salaries. High rewards are given  to Russian star-actors, in order if possible to draw talent of every  sort forth from the dry steppes of native art. The Russian actors are  compelled on pain of punishment to go regularly to the German theater,  with a view to their improvement, and in order to make this as  effective as may be, enormous compensations attract the best German  stars to St. Petersburg. And yet all this is useless, and the Russian  theater is not raised above the dignity of a workshop. Only the comic  side of the national character, a burlesque and droll simplicity, is  admirably represented by actors whose skill and the scope of whose  talents may he reckoned equal to the Germans in the same line. But  in the higher walks of the drama they are worthless. The people have  neither cultivation nor sentiment for serious works, while the poets  to produce them, and the actors to represent them, are alike wanting.    Immediately after the submission of Poland in 1831, the theaters,  permanent and itinerant, were closed. The plan was conceived of not  allowing them to be reoepened until they could be occupied by Russian  performers. But as the Government recovered from its first rage,  this was found to be impracticable. The officers of the garrisons in  Poland, however numerous, could never support Russian theaters, and  besides, where were the performers to come from? In Warsaw, however,  it was determined to force a theater into existence, and a Russian  newspaper was already established there. The power of the Muscovites  has done great things, built vast fortresses and destroyed vaster, but  it could not accomplish a Russian theater at Warsaw. Even the paper  died before it had attained a regular life, although it cost a great  deal of money.    Finally came the permission to reoepen the Polish theater, and indeed  the caprice which was before violent against it, was now exceedingly  favorable, but of course not without collateral purposes. The scanty  theater on the Krasinski place, which was alone in Warsaw, except the  remote circus and the little theater of King Stanislaus Augustus,  was given up, and the sum of four millions of florins ($1,600,000)  devoted to the erection of two large and magnificent theaters. The  superintendence of the work of building and the management of the  performances was, according to the Russian system, intrusted to one  General Rautenstrauch, a man seventy years old, and worn out both  in mind and body. The two theaters were erected under one roof, and  arranged on the grandest and most splendid scale. The edifice is  opposite the City Hall, occupies a whole side of the main public  place, and is above 750 feet in length. The pit in each is supported  by a series of immense, stupid, square pilasters, such as architecture  has seldom witnessed out of Russia. Over these pilasters stands  the first row of boxes supported by beautifully wrought Corinthian  columns, and above these rise three additional rows. The edifice is  about 160 feet high and is the most colossal building in Warsaw. As it  was designed to treat the actors in military fashion and according to  Russian style, the building was laid out like barracks and about seven  hundred persons live in it, most of them employed about the theater.  The two stages were built by a German architect under the inspection  of the General whose peremptory suggestions were frequent and  injurious. Both the great theater as it is called, which has four  rows of boxes, and can contain six thousand auditors, and the Variete  theater which is very much smaller, are fitted out with all sorts of  apparatus that ever belonged to a stage. In fact, new machinery has  in many cases been invented for them and proved totally useless. The  Russian often hits upon queer notions when he tries to show his gifts.    On one side a very large and strong bridge has been erected leading  from the street to the stage, to be used whenever the piece requires  large bodies of cavalry to make their appearance, and there are  machines that can convey persons with the swiftness of lightning down  from the sky above the stage, a distance of 56 feet. A machine for  which a ballet has been composed surpasses everything I ever saw in  its size; it serves to transport eighty persons together on a seeming  cloud from the roof to the foot-lights. I was astonished by it when I  first beheld it although I had seen the machines of the grand opera at  Paris: the second time I reflected that it alone cost 40,000 florins  [$16,000].    Under the management of two Russian Generals, who have hitherto been  at the head of the establishment, a vast deal has in this way been  accomplished for mere external show.    The great Russian theatre of St. Petersburg has served for a model,  and accordingly nothing has really been improved except that part of  the performance which is farthest removed from genuine art, namely  the ballet. That fact is that out of Paris the ballet is nowhere  so splendid as in the great theater at Warsaw, not even at St.  Petersburg, for the reason that the Russian is inferior to the Pole in  physical beauty and grace. Heretofore the corps of the St. Petersburg  ballet has twice been composed of Poles, but this arrangement has been  abandoned as derogatory to the national honor. The sensual attractions  of the ballet render it the most important thing in the theater. A  great school for dancers has been established, where pupils may be  found from three to eighteen years old. It is painful to see the  little creatures, hardly weaned from their mothers' breasts--twisted  and tortured for the purposes of so doubtful an occupation as dancing.  The school contains about two hundred pupils, all of whom occasionally  appear together on the boards, in the ballet of Charis and Flora, for  instance, when they receive a trifling compensation. For the rest the  whole ballet corps are bound to daily practice.    The taste of the Russians has made prominent in the ballet exactly  those peculiarities which are least to its credit. It must be  pronounced exaggerated and lascivious. Aside from these faults, which  may be overlooked as the custom of the country, we must admit that the  dancing is uncommonly good.    The greater the care of the management for the ballet, the more  injurious is its treatment of the drama.

A large leaden button is  fastened to the end of the cord, and similar smaller buttons are  distributed along it at distances, according to certain rules  derived from experience, of which we are ignorant. Armed with this  weapon, which the Csikos carries in his belt, together with a short  grappling-iron or hook, he sets out on his horse-chase. Thus mounted  and equipped without saddle or stirrup, he flies like the storm-wind  over the heath, with such velocity that the grass scarcely bends  under the horse's hoof; the step of his horse is not heard, and the  whirling cloud of dust above his head alone marks his approach and  disappearance. Although familiar with the use of a bridle, he despises  such a troublesome article of luxury, and guides his horse with his  voice, hands, and feet--nay, it almost seems as if he directed it by  the mere exercise of the will, as we move our feet to the right or  left, backward or forward, without its ever coming into our head to  regulate our movements by a leather strap.    \"In this manner for hours he chases the flying herd, until at length  he succeeds in approaching the animal which he is bent on catching.  He then swings his whip round in immense circles, and throws the cord  with such dexterity and precision that it twines around the neck of  his victim. The leaden button at the end, and the knots along the  cord, form a noose, which draws closer and tighter the faster the  horse hastens on.    \"See how he flies along with outstretched legs, his mane whistling  in the wind, his eye darting fire, his mouth covered with foam, and  the dust whirling aloft on all sides! But the noble animal breathes  shorter, his eye grows wild and staring, his nostrils are reddened  with blood, the veins of his neck are distended like cords, his legs  refuse longer service--he sinks exhausted and powerless, a picture  of death. But at the same instant the pursuing steed likewise stands  still and fixed as if turned to stone. An instant, and the Csikos has  flung himself off his horse upon the ground, and inclining his body  backward, to keep the noose tight, he seizes the cord alternately with  the right and left hand, shorter and shorter, drawing himself by it  nearer and nearer to the panting and prostrate animal, till at last  coming up to it he flings his legs across its back. He now begins to  slacken the noose gently, allowing the creature to recover breath: but  hardly does the horse feel this relief, before he leaps up, and darts  off again in a wild course, as if still able to escape from his enemy.  But the man is already bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh; he  sits fixed upon his neck as if grown to it, and makes the horse feel  his power at will, by tightening or slackening the cord. A second time  the hunted animal sinks upon the ground; again he rises, and again  breaks down, until at length, overpowered with exhaustion, he can no  longer stir a limb....    \"The foot-soldier who has discharged his musket is lost when opposed  to the Csikos. His bayonet, with which he can defend himself against  the Uhlans and Hussars, is here of no use to him; all his practiced  maneuvers and skill are unavailing against the long whip of his enemy,  which drags him to the ground, or beats him to death with his leaden  buttons; nay, even if he had still a charge in his musket, he could  sooner hit a bird on the wing than the Csikos, who, riding round and  round him in wild bounds, dashes with his steed first to one side then  to another, with the speed of lightning, so as to frustrate any aim.  The horse-soldier, armed in the usual manner, fares not much better;  and wo to him if he meets a Csikos singly! better to fall in with a  pack of ravenous wolves.\"           *       *       *       *       *      THE PRESENT RELIGION OF PERSIA.    An account of the Expedition for the survey of the rivers Euphrates  and Tigris, carried on by order of the British Government, in the  years 1835, 1836, and 1837; preceded by geographical and historical  notices of the regions situated between the Nile and the Indus, with  fourteen maps and charts, and ninety-seven plates, besides numerous  woodcuts, has just appeared in London, in four large volumes, from the  pen of Lieutenant-Colonel Chesney, R.A., F.R.S., &c., commander of  the Expedition. It is too comprehensive a work ever to be reprinted  here, or to be much read, even in England, but it is undoubtedly very  valuable as an authority. The following paragraphs from it describe  the present state of religion in Persia:    \"The title of Mulla is conferred on a candidate by some member of the  order, after the requisite examination in theology and law; and the  person is then intrusted with the education of youth, as well as  the administration of justice, and the practice of law. The Mullas  sometimes possess sufficient power not only to influence the people at  large, but even the King himself.    \"Of this class of priests, those who have been successful in life are  either placed in mosques or private families, waiting for advancement;  but a greater number are nominally attached to colleges, and live  by the practice of astrology, fortune-telling, the sale of charms,  talismans, &c. They who are not possessed of the requisite ingenuity  to subsist by the credulity of others, take charge of an inferior  school, or write letters, and draw up marriage and other engagements,  for those who are unequal to the task. They mix at the same time  largely in the domestic concerns of families. But in addition to  these and other vocations, a considerable number of the lowest priests  derive a scanty support from that charity which no one denies to  the true believer. These men wander as fakirs from place to place,  carrying news, and repeating poems, tales, &c., mixed with verses from  the Koran. The heterodox religions are very numerous; nor is Irian  without her free-thinkers, as the Kamurs and Mu'tazelis, (Mitaulis,)  who deny everything which they cannot prove by natural reason. A third  sect, the Mahadelis, or Molochadis, still maintain the Magian belief  that the stars and the planets govern all things. Another, the Ehl  el Tabkwid, (men of truth,) hold that there is no God except the four  elements, and no rational soul or life after this one. They maintain  also, that all living bodies, being mixtures of the elements, will  after death return to their first principles. They also affirm that  paradise and hell belong to this world, into which every man returns  in the form of a beast, a plant, or again as a man; and that in this  second state, he is great, powerful, and happy, or poor, despicable,  and unhappy, according to his former merits or demerits. In practice  they inculcate kindness to and respect for each other, with implicit  obedience to their chiefs, who are called Pir, (old men,) and are  furnished with all kinds of provisions for their subsistence. This  sect is found in the provinces of Irak and Fars.    \"The Tarikh Zenadikah (way of the covetous) are directly opposed to  the last on the subject of transmigration; and they believe that God  is in all places, and performs all things. They likewise maintain  that the whole visible universe is only a manifestation of the  Supreme Being; the soul itself being a portion of the Divine essence.  Therefore, they consider, that whatever appears to the eye is God, and  that all religious rites should be comprised in the contemplation of  God's goodness and greatness.    \"On these various creeds the different branches of Suffeeism seem to  have been founded. One of the most extraordinary of these sects is the  Rashaniyah; the followers of which believe in the transmigration of  souls, and the manifestation of the Divinity in the persons of holy  men. They maintain likewise, that all men who do not join their  sect are to be considered as dead, and that their goods belong, in  consequence, to the true believers, as the only survivors.\"           *       *       *       *       *      THE \"OLD DUKE OF QUEENSBURY.\"    Mr. Burke gives in his gossiping book about the English aristocracy,  the following anecdotes of this once famous person:    \"Few men occupied a more conspicuous place about the court and town  for nearly seventy years, during the reigns of the Second and Third  Georges. Like Wilmot Earl of Rochester, he pursued pleasure under  every shape, and with as much ardor at fourscore as he had done at  twenty. At the decease of his father, in 1731, he became Earl of  March; and he subsequently, in 1748, inherited his mother's earldom  of Ruglen, together with the family's estates in the counties of  Edinburgh and Linlithgow. These rich endowments of fortune, and a  handsome person, of which he was especially careful, combined to  invest the youthful Earl with no ordinary attractions, and the  ascendency they acquired he retained for a longer period than any one  of his contemporaries; from his first appearance in the fashionable  world in the year 1746, to the year he left it forever, in 1810,  at the age of eighty-five, he was always an object of comparative  notoriety. There was no interregnum in the public course of his  existence. His first distinction he achieved on the turf; his  knowledge of which, both in theory and practice, equaled that of the  most accomplished adepts of Newmarket. In all his principal matches  he rode himself, and in that branch of equitation rivaled the most  professional jockeys. Properly accoutered in his velvet cap, red  silken jacket, buckskin breeches, and long spurs, his Lordship bore  away the prize on many a well-contested field. His famous match with  the Duke of Hamilton was long remembered in sporting annals. Both  noblemen rode their own horses, and each was supported by numerous  partisans. The contest took place on the race-ground at Newmarket, and  attracted all the fashionables of "]]]
