This wall between the garden and the foldyard is very old and rough--not  like the smooth brick walls you see in towns. The stones are of  different shapes and sizes, the mortar has fallen out of it in many  places, and here and there are holes and crevices. Yet it is a very  beautiful old wall, for many things grow on it; mosses and grasses, and  other flowers too, are there.    On this May morning we not only see, but also smell, one of the flowers  which grow upon the wall--it is the beautiful sweet-scented Wallflower.  It grows here and there along the top of the wall, and a few plants of  it are even springing from the sides. Some of the plants are quite large  and their stems are tough. These have grown here for a long time. The  Wallflower is a perennial plant; unless it is killed or torn up by the  roots it will live and grow for many years. Others are quite young and  only a few inches high. These have grown from seeds dropped last autumn  by the older plants.    You very likely wonder how the Wallflower or any other plant can grow  upon the wall, for there is no earth to be seen--nothing but stones and  crumbling mortar. But if we pull up one of the smaller plants we shall  find earth clinging to its roots. Dry dusty earth has been blown upon  the wall by wind, and has lodged in chinks and holes. Dust and soil,  too, were mixed with the mortar when the wall was built; and dead leaves  falling on it and decaying have produced a little more--for decayed  leaves make earth or \"soil.\" Wallflowers and other plants which grow on  walls and rocks find very little soil sufficient for their needs.    Most of the blossoms of the wallflowers upon this wall are of a golden  yellow colour and are very sweet. Some of the blossoms are, however, a  darker yellow than others, and here and there are petals which are quite  brown.    If we look at the garden behind us we shall see that Mrs. Hammond has  several beds of Wallflower this year; it is a flower of which she is  very fond. There are wallflowers of two different colours in her beds.  One kind has bright golden blossoms, rather deeper in colour than any of  those upon the wall; the other has flowers that are a rich dark brown.    [Illustration: WALLFLOWER.]    These plants are sturdier and more bushy than those upon the wall, and  there are more flowers on each plant. The flowers are finer, too, and  have a stronger scent. If Mrs. Hammond had wished she could have sown  seed to produce many different shades of brown and yellow Wallflowers.  She might also have had a purple Wallflower, and even a Wallflower of so  pale a yellow as to be almost white.    If you and I were clever gardeners and had plenty of time and patience,  we could get purple or nearly white wallflowers from these  yellow-flowered plants upon the wall. It would perhaps take us many  years, but we should succeed at last. This is how we should set about  it.    Suppose that we wished to have a Wallflower nearly white. We should look  carefully along the wall in spring, when the blossoms are out, until we  found the very palest yellow blossom we could see. We should mark that  plant, and when the flower was over and the seed was ripe, we should  collect the seed. Among the plants grown from this seed we should choose  again the plant that had the palest flowers, and should save the seed  from _that_. We might have to go on doing this for twenty years or more,  but in time we should have a Wallflower so pale as to be almost white.    _Quite_ white we should never get our Wallflower, for no _pure_ white  flower can be obtained from a yellow one. However pale our Wallflower  might be there would still always be just a tinge of yellow or cream  colour in it.    If, on the other hand, we wanted a purple or a very dark brown  Wallflower, we should save seed from those blossoms which were nearest  to the colour we wanted--dark brown or with a tinge of purple in them.  We should sow seed from the darkest blossoms again and again, and at  last we should get what we wished to have.    [Illustration: RED VALERIAN.]    [Illustration: STINGING NETTLE.]    [Illustration: WHITE DEAD NETTLE.]    Besides choosing seed from the lightest or darkest blossoms, we should  tend our plants very carefully and well, giving them plenty of good rich  soil. This would make them grow bushy and with many flowers, as we see  them in Mrs. Hammond's garden beds.    Many of our garden flowers have been produced in this way, by selecting  and improving wild flowers. Of course all flowers grow wild _somewhere_;  some in England, but many more in foreign countries, where the air is  warmer and the soil richer and better. The Pansy is a little English  wild flower with yellow, blue, and red petals. From this little flower  gardeners have produced large and beautiful pansies of many different  colours and shades of colours--white, yellow, blue, and brown. This has  been done by careful selection, just as we spoke of doing with the  wallflowers.    But if the large single-coloured pansies of which I have told you, or  Mrs. Hammond's dark brown wallflowers, were allowed to seed  themselves--that is, were allowed to drop and sow their own seed year  after year--do you know what would happen? They would gradually revert  or turn back to their original form and colour. The flowers would become  mixed in colour and less fine in size; at last they would be simple wild  flowers again.    [Illustration: PANSY.]    Now it is June, and the blossoms of the Wallflower have faded and  fallen. The old wall is, however, growing gay with another plant--the  Red Valerian. We must be careful to remember that it is the Red  Valerian, for there are other valerians. There is the Great Valerian  which does not grow on walls or rocks, but in damp and shady places; its  flowers are pale pink.    The blossoms of the Red Valerian on the wall are bright crimson, and  they grow in rows on small stems which spring from a stout stalk a foot  or two in height. Each blossom of five petals forms a little tube or  corolla. The base or foot of each little tube appears as a point on the  under side of the flower stem; the Red Valerian, like the Violet, is a  spurred flower.    The leaves are long and pointed, and they grow in pairs, on opposite  sides of the stalk. Sometimes the edges of the leaves are quite smooth;  sometimes they are serrated, or toothed, like the edge of a saw. If we  pulled a plant of Red Valerian from the wall we should find the roots  very long and branching; they need to be so, for the plant often grows  on rocks and other places where it is exposed to wind. If the roots had  not a firm hold the tall stems laden with blossoms might be blown down.    The Red Valerian flowers all through the summer. Its clusters of crimson  flowers are as great an ornament to the old wall as were the wallflowers  in May.    Now let us go down the steps into the foldyard; there is a wall on  either side of us as we descend. The wall which faces the north is  nearly always in shadow, and there are ferns growing but of it between  the stones. One of these is a beautiful Hartstongue fern, with large and  shining leaves. We said just now, however, that ferns have no flowers,  so we will turn to something that grows on the wall opposite.    This is the ivy-leaved Toadflax. It grows on walls and rocks, as the Red  Valerian does, but it is a very different plant in appearance. The stems  of the Red Valerian are tall and upright; those of the Toadflax are  slender and drooping. There is a large mass of it on the side of the  wall, and we find that the root is at the highest point of the whole  mass. The stems with the flowers and leaves hang down below the root; it  is a trailing plant.    There are, however, other roots clinging to the wall here and there  below the main root. The plant, like several others, is able to throw  out fresh roots from the joints of its stems, and these give it a firmer  hold.    The flowers are small, and their colour is a pale lilac-blue with a  bright yellow spot in the centre. These flowers too are spurred. The  leaves are smooth and thick--what is called fleshy. They are divided  into five lobes or divisions, and are not unlike an ivy-leaf in shape.  When we turn a leaf or two over we see that the under side of some is  dark purple.    [Illustration: IVY-LEAVED TOADFLAX.]    This little plant is usually said to prefer a damp situation, and to  blossom from May till October. This wall beside the steps is certainly  rather damp, for the moisture from the garden above soaks down to it. In  my own garden, however, the ivy-leaved Toadflax grows on some very dry  old walls, and I have found it in flower in the middle of December.    Neither the Toadflax nor the Red Valerian are really natives of England.  They were brought to our country many hundreds of years ago. They have  spread so much that they have now become wildflowers. In the same way  many others of our wild flowers were once unknown in England.    Now that we have come down the steps into the foldyard we see that it  lies a good deal below the house and garden. Built round the foldyard  are the stables for the cart-horses, the cowhouses, and the great barn.  Behind the stables is the rickyard. That, like the garden, is above the  foldyard; from it there are only two or three steps to the door of the  loft or \"tallet\" above the stables. It is there that we will go now.    The wall of the tallet is of stone and is very old; the roof is tiled.  There is a little hole cut in the bottom of the door, and you will see  one like it in the door of the granary. It is made so that old Tib and  the other cats can go in and catch mice. Growing between the stones of  the wall just by the tallet door is the plant I want to show you now.    It is the Stonecrop. Some of the stems grow upright, while others are  trailing. At the top of each upright stem is a cluster of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13376"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage, King AEthelbert, 596 to King George III, 1775 (#2)"],[1,"of stone like Stonehenge  were built with alignments to paths of the moon.    If hunting groups from two clans tried to follow the same deer,  there might be a fight between the clans or a blood feud. After  the battle, the clan would bring back its dead and wounded. A  priest officiated over a funeral for a dead man. His wife would  often also go on the funeral pyre with him.    The priest also officiated over sacrifices of humans, who were  usually offenders found guilty of transgressions. Sacrifices were  usually made in time of war or pestilence, and usually before the  winter made food scarce.    The clan ate deer that had been cooked on a spit over a fire, and  fruits and vegetables which had been gathered by the women. They  drank water from springs. In the spring, food was plentiful. There  were eggs of different colors in nests and many hare to eat. The  goddess Easter was celebrated at this time.    After this hunting and gathering era, there was farming and  domestication of animals such as horses, pigs, sheep, goats,  chicken, and cattle. Of these, the pig was the most important meat  supply, being killed and salted for winter use. Next in importance  were the cattle. Sheep were kept primarily for their wool. Flocks  and herds were taken to pastures. The male cattle, with wood  yokes, pulled ploughs in the fields of barley and wheat. The  female goat and cow provided milk, butter, and cheese. The  chickens provided eggs. The hoe, spade, and grinding stone were  used. Thread was spun with a hand-held spindle which one hand held  while the other hand alternately formed the thread from a mass and  then wound it around the spindle. A coarse cloth was woven and  worn as a tunic which had been cut from the cloth. Kings wore  tunics decorated with sheet gold. Decorated pottery was made from  clay and used to hold liquids and for food preparation and  consumption. During the period of \"lent\" [from the word \"lencten\",  which means spring], it was forbidden to eat any meat or fish.  This was the season in which many animals were born and grew to  maturity. Wood carts with four wheels were used to transport  produce and manure. Horses were used for transportation of people  or goods. Wood dug-out boats and paddles were used to fish on  rivers or on the seacoast.    Clans had settlements near rivers. Each settlement had a meadow,  for the mowing of hay, and a simple mill, with round timber huts,  covered with branches or thatch or turf supported by a ring of  posts. Inside was a hearth with smoke going up through a hole in  the roof, and a cauldron for cooking food. There was an upright  loom in the darkness. The floor was swept clean. At the door were  spears or bags of slingstones ready for immediate use. The King  lived in the largest hut. Gullies outside carried off excess  water. Each hut had a garden for fruit and vegetables. A goat or  cow might be tied out of reach of the garden. There was a fence or  hedge surrounding and protecting the garden area and dwelling.  Buckets and cauldrons which had originated from the Mediterranean  were used. Querns with the top circular stone turned by hand over  the bottom stone were used for grinding grain. There were ovens to  dry and roast grain. Grain was first eaten as a porridge or  cereal. There were square wood granaries on stilts and wood racks  on which to dry hay. Grain was stored in concealed pits in the  earth which were lined with drystone or basket work or clay and  made airtight by sealing with clay or dung. Old pits were  converted into waste dumps, burials, or latrines. Outside the  fence were an acre or two of fields of wheat and barley, and  sometimes oats and rye. Wheat and rye were sown in the fall, and  oats and barley in the spring. Sowing was by men or two oxen  drawing a simple scratch plough. The crops were all harvested in the  summer. In this two-field system, land was held by peasants in  units designed to support a single extended family. These fields  were usually enclosed with a hedge to keep animals from eating the  crop and to define the territory of the settlement from that of  its neighbors. Flax was grown and made into linen cloth. Beyond  the fields were pastures for cattle and sheep grazing. There was  often an area for beehives. This was subsistence level farming.    Pottery was given symmetry when formed with use of a wheel and  heated in increasingly hot kilns. From kilns used for pottery, it  was noticed that lumps of gold or copper ore within would melt and  assume the shape of what they had been resting on. These were the  first metals, and could be beaten into various shapes, such as  ornaments. Then the liquid ore was poured into moulds carved out  of stones to make axes and daggers, which were reheated and  hammered to become strong. Copper-tipped drills, chisels, punches  and awls were also made.    The bodies of deceased were buried far away from any village in  wood coffins, except for kings, who were placed in large stone  coffins after being wrapped in linen. Buried with them were a few  personal items, such as copper daggers, flat copper axes, and awls  [small pointed tool for piercing holes in leather, wood, or other  soft materials.]. The deceased was buried in a coffin with a stone  on top deep in the earth to keep the spirit of the dead from  coming out to haunt the living.    It was learned that tin added to the copper made a stronger metal:  bronze. Stone hammers, and bronze and iron tools, were used to  make cooking pots, weapons, breast plates, and horse bits, which  were formed from moulds and/or forged by bronze smiths and  blacksmiths from iron extracted from iron ore heated in bowl-  shaped hearths. Typically one man operated the bellows to keep the  fire hot while another did the hammering. Bronze was made into  sickles for harvesting, razors for shaving, tweezers, straight  hair pins, safety pins for clothes, armlets, neck-rings, and  mirrors. Weapons included bows and arrows, flint and copper  daggers, bronze swords and spears, stone axes, and shields of wood  with bronze mountings. The bows and arrows probably evolved from  spear throwing rods. Kings in body armor fought with chariots  drawn by two horses. The horse harnesses had bronze fittings. The  chariots had wood wheels, later with iron rims. When bronze came  into use, there was a demand for its constituent parts: copper and  tin, which were traded by rafts on waterways and the sea. When  iron came into use, there were wrought iron axes, saws, adzes [ax  with curved blade used to dress wood], files, ploughshares,  harrows [set of spikes to break clods of earth on ploughed land and  also to cover seed when sewn], scythes, billhooks [thick knife  with hooked point used to prune shrubs], and spits for hearths.  Lead was mined. There was some glassmaking of beads. Wrought iron  bars were used as currency.    Hillforts now had wooden palisades on top of their banks to  protect the enclosed farmsteads and villages from stock wandering  off or being taken by rustlers, and from attacks by wild animals  or other people. Later a rampart was added from which sentries  could patrol. These were supported by timber and/or stone  structures. Timbers were probably transported by carts or dragged  by oxen. At the entrances were several openings only one of which  really allowed entry. The others went between banks into dead ends  and served as traps in which to kill the enemy from above. Gates  were of wood, some hung from hinges on posts which could be  locked. Later guard chambers were added, some with space for  hearths and beds. Sometimes further concentric circles of banks  and ditches, and perhaps a second rampart, were added around these  forts. They could reach to 14 acres. The ramparts are sufficiently  widely spaced to make sling-shotting out from them highly  effective, but to minimize the dangers from sling-shotting from  without. The additional banks and ditches could be used to create  cattle corridors or to protect against spear-thrown firebrands.  However, few forts had springs of water within them, indicating  that attacks on them were probably expected to be short. Attacks  usually began with warriors bristling with weapons and blowing war  trumpets shouting insults to the foe, while their kings dashed  about in chariots. Sometimes champions from each side fought in  single combat. They took the heads of those they killed to  hang from their belts or place on wood spikes at the gates.  Prisoners, including women and children, might become slaves.  Kings sometimes lived in separate palisades where they kept their  horses and chariots.    Circles of big stones like Stonehenge were rebuilt so that the  sun's position with respect to the stones would indicate the day  of longest sunlight and the day of shortest sunlight. Between  these days there was an optimum time to harvest the crops before  fall, when plants dried up and leaves fell from the trees. The  winter solstice, when the days began to get longer was cause for  celebration. In the next season, there was an optimum time to  plant seeds so they could spring up from the ground as new growth.  So farming gave rise to the concept of a year. Certain changes of  the year were celebrated, such as Easter, named for the Goddess of  the Dawn, which occurred in the east (after lent); May Day  celebrating the revival of life; Lammas around July, when the  wheat crop was ready for harvesting; and on October 31 the Celtic  eve of Samhain, when the spirits of the dead came back to visit  homes and demand food or else cast an evil spell on the refusing  homes; and at which masked and costumed inhabitants representing  the souls of the dead paraded to the outskirts of the settlements  to lead the ghosts away from their homes; and at which animals and  humans, who might be deemed to be possessed by spirits, were  sacrificed or killed perhaps as examples, in huge bonfires  [bonefires] as those"]]]
