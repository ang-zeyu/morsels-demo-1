Philosophy tests Boethius' mental       state by certain questions, and discovers three chief causes of his       soul's sickness: (1) He has forgotten his own true nature; (2) he       knows not the end towards which the whole universe tends; (3) he       knows not the means by which the world is governed.          BOOK I.        SONG I.    BOETHIUS' COMPLAINT.          Who wrought my studious numbers        Smoothly once in happier days,      Now perforce in tears and sadness        Learn a mournful strain to raise.      Lo, the Muses, grief-dishevelled,        Guide my pen and voice my woe;      Down their cheeks unfeigned the tear drops        To my sad complainings flow!      These alone in danger's hour        Faithful found, have dared attend      On the footsteps of the exile        To his lonely journey's end.      These that were the pride and pleasure        Of my youth and high estate      Still remain the only solace        Of the old man's mournful fate.      Old? Ah yes; swift, ere I knew it,        By these sorrows on me pressed      Age hath come; lo, Grief hath bid me        Wear the garb that fits her best.      O'er my head untimely sprinkled        These white hairs my woes proclaim,      And the skin hangs loose and shrivelled        On this sorrow-shrunken frame.      Blest is death that intervenes not        In the sweet, sweet years of peace,      But unto the broken-hearted,        When they call him, brings release!      Yet Death passes by the wretched,        Shuts his ear and slumbers deep;      Will not heed the cry of anguish,        Will not close the eyes that weep.      For, while yet inconstant Fortune        Poured her gifts and all was bright,      Death's dark hour had all but whelmed me        In the gloom of endless night.      Now, because misfortune's shadow        Hath o'erclouded that false face,      Cruel Life still halts and lingers,        Though I loathe his weary race.      Friends, why did ye once so lightly        Vaunt me happy among men?      Surely he who so hath fallen        Was not firmly founded then.        I.      While I was thus mutely pondering within myself, and recording my  sorrowful complainings with my pen, it seemed to me that there appeared  above my head a woman of a countenance exceeding venerable. Her eyes  were bright as fire, and of a more than human keenness; her complexion  was lively, her vigour showed no trace of enfeeblement; and yet her  years were right full, and she plainly seemed not of our age and time.  Her stature was difficult to judge. At one moment it exceeded not the  common height, at another her forehead seemed to strike the sky; and  whenever she raised her head higher, she began to pierce within the very  heavens, and to baffle the eyes of them that looked upon her. Her  garments were of an imperishable fabric, wrought with the finest threads  and of the most delicate workmanship; and these, as her own lips  afterwards assured me, she had herself woven with her own hands. The  beauty of this vesture had been somewhat tarnished by age and neglect,  and wore that dingy look which marble contracts from exposure. On the  lower-most edge was inwoven the Greek letter [Greek: P], on the topmost  the letter [Greek: Th],[A] and between the two were to be seen steps,  like a staircase, from the lower to the upper letter. This robe,  moreover, had been torn by the hands of violent persons, who had each  snatched away what he could clutch.[B] Her right hand held a note-book;  in her left she bore a staff. And when she saw the Muses of Poesie  standing by my bedside, dictating the words of my lamentations, she was  moved awhile to wrath, and her eyes flashed sternly. 'Who,' said she,  'has allowed yon play-acting wantons to approach this sick man--these  who, so far from giving medicine to heal his malady, even feed it with  sweet poison? These it is who kill the rich crop of reason with the  barren thorns of passion, who accustom men's minds to disease, instead  of setting them free. Now, were it some common man whom your allurements  were seducing, as is usually your way, I should be less indignant. On  such a one I should not have spent my pains for naught. But this is one  nurtured in the Eleatic and Academic philosophies. Nay, get ye gone, ye  sirens, whose sweetness lasteth not; leave him for my muses to tend and  heal!' At these words of upbraiding, the whole band, in deepened  sadness, with downcast eyes, and blushes that confessed their shame,  dolefully left the chamber.    But I, because my sight was dimmed with much weeping, and I could not  tell who was this woman of authority so commanding--I was dumfoundered,  and, with my gaze fastened on the earth, continued silently to await  what she might do next. Then she drew near me and sat on the edge of my  couch, and, looking into my face all heavy with grief and fixed in  sadness on the ground, she bewailed in these words the disorder of my  mind:    FOOTNOTES:    [A] [Greek: P] (P) stands for the Political life, the life of action;  [Greek: Th] (Th) for the Theoretical life, the life of thought.    [B] The Stoic, Epicurean, and other philosophical sects, which Boethius  regards as heterodox. See also below, ch. iii., p. 14.        SONG II.    HIS DESPONDENCY.          Alas! in what abyss his mind        Is plunged, how wildly tossed!      Still, still towards the outer night        She sinks, her true light lost,      As oft as, lashed tumultuously      By earth-born blasts, care's waves rise high.        Yet once he ranged the open heavens,        The sun's bright pathway tracked;      Watched how the cold moon waxed and waned;        Nor rested, till there lacked      To his wide ken no star that steers      Amid the maze of circling spheres.        The causes why the blusterous winds        Vex ocean's tranquil face,      Whose hand doth turn the stable globe,        Or why his even race      From out the ruddy east the sun      Unto the western waves doth run:        What is it tempers cunningly        The placid hours of spring,      So that it blossoms with the rose        For earth's engarlanding:      Who loads the year's maturer prime      With clustered grapes in autumn time:        All this he knew--thus ever strove        Deep Nature's lore to guess.      Now, reft of reason's light, he lies,        And bonds his neck oppress;      While by the heavy load constrained,      His eyes to this dull earth are chained.        II.      'But the time,' said she, 'calls rather for healing than for  lamentation.' Then, with her eyes bent full upon me, 'Art thou that  man,' she cries, 'who, erstwhile fed with the milk and reared upon the  nourishment which is mine to give, had grown up to the full vigour of a  manly spirit? And yet I had bestowed such armour on thee as would have  proved an invincible defence, hadst thou not first cast it away. Dost  thou know me? Why art thou silent? Is it shame or amazement that hath  struck thee dumb? Would it were shame; but, as I see, a stupor hath  seized upon thee.' Then, when she saw me not only answering nothing, but  mute and utterly incapable of speech, she gently touched my breast with  her hand, and said: 'There is no danger; these are the symptoms of  lethargy, the usual sickness of deluded minds. For awhile he has  forgotten himself; he will easily recover his memory, if only he first  recognises me. And that he may do so, let me now wipe his eyes that are  clouded with a mist of mortal things.' Thereat, with a fold of her robe,  she dried my eyes all swimming with tears.        SONG III.    THE MISTS DISPELLED.          Then the gloom of night was scattered,        Sight returned unto mine eyes.      So, when haply rainy Caurus        Rolls the storm-clouds through the skies,      Hidden is the sun; all heaven        Is obscured in starless night.      But if, in wild onset sweeping,        Boreas frees day's prisoned light,      All suddenly the radiant god outstreams,      And strikes our dazzled eyesight with his beams.        III.      Even so the clouds of my melancholy were broken up. I saw the clear sky,  and regained the power to recognise the face of my physician.  Accordingly, when I had lifted my eyes and fixed my gaze upon her, I  beheld my nurse, Philosophy, whose halls I had frequented from my youth  up.    'Ah! why,' I cried, 'mistress of all excellence, hast thou come down  from on high, and entered the solitude of this my exile? Is it that  thou, too, even as I, mayst be persecuted with false accusations?'    'Could I desert thee, child,' said she, 'and not lighten the burden  which thou hast taken upon thee through the hatred of my name, by  sharing this trouble? Even forgetting that it were not lawful for  Philosophy to leave companionless the way of the innocent, should I,  thinkest thou, fear to incur reproach, or shrink from it, as though  some strange new thing had befallen? Thinkest thou that now, for the  first time in an evil age, Wisdom hath been assailed by peril? Did I not  often in days of old, before my servant Plato lived, wage stern warfare  with the rashness of folly? In his lifetime, too, Socrates, his master,  won with my aid the victory of an unjust death. And when, one after the  other, the Epicurean herd, the Stoic, and the rest, each of them as far  as in them lay, went about to seize the heritage he left, and were  dragging me off protesting and resisting, as their booty, they tore in  pieces the garment which I had woven with my own hands, and, clutching  the torn pieces, went off, believing that the whole of me had passed  into their possession. And some of them, because some traces of my  vesture were seen upon them, were destroyed through the mistake of the  lewd multitude, who falsely deemed them to be my disciples. It may be  thou knowest not of the banishment of Anaxagoras, of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14339"],[0,"Music Talks with Children (#2)"],[1,"happiness, and what makes happiness is good for us, because happiness  not only lightens the heart, but it is one of the best ways to make  the light come to the face. The moment we study music we learn a  severe lesson, and that is this: There can be no use in our trying to  be musicians unless we are willing to learn perfect order in all the  music-tasks we do.    In this, music is a particularly severe mistress. Nothing slovenly,  untidy, or out of order will do. The count must be absolutely right,  not fast nor slow as our fancy dictates, but even and regular. The  hands must do their task together in a friendly manner; the one never  crowding nor hurrying the other, each willing to yield to the other  when the right moment comes.[3] The feet must never use the pedals so  as to make the harmonies mingle wrongly, but at just the right moment  must make the strings sing together as the composer desires. The  thoughts can never for a single moment wander from the playing; they  must remain faithful, preparing what is to come and commanding the  hands to do exactly the right task in the right way. That shows us,  you see, the second quality and a strict one of music. It will not  allow us to be disorderly, and more than this, it teaches us a habit  for order that will be a gain to us in every other task. Now let us  see:    First, we should study music for the happiness it will give us.    Second, we should study music for the order it teaches us.    There is a third reason. If music gives us happiness, do we not in  learning it gain a power to contribute happiness to others? That is  one of the greatest pleasures in learning. Not only does the knowledge  prove of use and joy to us, but we can constantly make it useful and  joy-giving to others. Does this not teach us how thankful we should be  to all those who live usefully? And think of all the men who have  passed their lives writing beautiful thoughts, singing out of their  very hearts, day after day, all their life long, for the joy of others  forever after.    In our next Talk we shall learn that pure thought, written out of the  heart, is forever a good in the world. From this we shall learn that  to study music rightly is to cultivate in our own hearts the same good  thought which the composer had. Hence the third reason we can find for  studying music is that it makes us able to help and to cheer others,  to help them by willingly imparting the little knowledge we have, and  to cheer them by playing the beautiful thoughts in tone which we have  learned.    These are three great reasons, truly, but there are many others. Let  us speak about one of them. In some of the Talks we are to have we  shall learn that true music comes from a true heart; and that great  music--that is the classics--is the thought of men who are pure and  noble, learned in the way to write, and anxious never to write  anything but the best. There is plainly a great deal of good to us if  we study daily the music of men such as these. In this way we are  brought in touch with the greatest thought. This constant presence and  influence will mold our thoughts to greater strength and greater  beauty. When we read the history of music, we shall see that the  greatest composers have always been willing to study in their first  days the master works of their time. They have strengthened their  thoughts by contact with thoughts stronger than their own, and we may  gain in just the same way if we will. We know now that there are many  reasons why it is good for us to study music. We have spoken  particularly of four of these. They are:    First, for the happiness it will give us.    Second, for the order it demands of us.    Third, for the power it gives us to help and cheer others.    Fourth, for the great and pure thought it brings before us and raises  in us.    All these things, are they true, you ask? If the little child had  asked that of the master he would have said:    \"These things shalt thou find real because they make thee brave. And  the pain and the drudgery and the hot tears shall be the easier to  bear for this knowledge, which should be strong within thee as a pure  faith.\"          CHAPTER III.    MUSIC IN THE HEART.        \"Raffaello's genius goes directly to the heart.\"--_Autobiography of    Benvenuto Cellini._[4]    The only true way to learn is by doing. The skill of the hand and the  skill of the thought can be brought out only by use. We shall not  become very skilful, nor very learned, nor very good unless we daily  devote ourselves to tasks--often difficult and unpleasant--which shall  bring to us wisdom, or success, or goodness. None of these things, nor  any other like them, come merely by talking about them. That is the  worst way of all--merely to talk and not to act. But if we talk  truthfully and act with care, we shall gain a great deal. Pleasant  companionship often brings forth thoughts which if we follow them  industriously, lead a long way in a good direction.    I do not know that any one has likened music to a country. But we can  make the comparison, and then it becomes plain that we may either  wander through it, seeing the beautiful things, wondering about them,  and talking over our admiration and our wonder; or we may join to this  a true and an earnest inquiry, which shall give us, as a reward, the  clear understanding of some things which we see. Let us travel in this  way; first, because we shall gain true knowledge by it, but better  still, because we shall thereby learn _in the first days_ that the  truest pleasures and the dearest happinesses are those for which we  have done something; those for which we have given both of labor and  of pains.    One of the wisest little philosophers in the world was Polissena,[5]  and I think she became wise just because she labored. As we become  more and more acquainted with true music we shall learn this: True  music is that which is born in some one's heart. \"All immortal writers  speak out of the heart.\"[6] Nothing could be truer; and as they speak  _out_ of their hearts you may be sure they intend to speak _into_  ours. Nowhere else. As true music is made in some one's heart, we must  feel it in our own hearts as we play it or it will mean nothing. The  heart must make it warm, then the beauties of the music will come out.  It is strange how our moods tell themselves. All we do with our eyes  and with our ears, with the tongue and with the hands, what we do with  our thoughts even, is sure to say of itself whether we are doing with  a willing heart or not. It is curious that the truth will come out of  whatever seems to be a secret, but curious as it may be, it does come  out. We must think of that.    Every one of us knows the difference between doing willingly and  unwillingly. We know that things done with joy and with eagerness are  well done and seem to spring directly from the heart. Not only that,  but they really inspire joy and eagerness in those who are about us.  _Inspire_ is just the word. Look it up in your dictionary and see that  it means exactly what happens--_to breathe into_--they breathe joy and  happiness _into_ all things else, and it comes out of our hearts.    Now happiness can be told in many ways: in laughter, in the eyes, in a  game, in a life like that of Polissena's, in anything, but in nothing  that does not win the heart. As happiness can be shown in anything, it  can be shown in music. We can put happiness into play, likewise we can  put happiness into music. And as much of it as we put into anything  will come out. Besides, we might just as well learn now as at another  time, this: Whatever we put into what we do will come out. It may be  happiness or idleness or hatred or courage; whatever goes into what we  do comes out very plainly. Everything, remember. That means much. If  you should practise for an hour, wishing all the time to be doing  something else, you may be sure that your wish is coming out of your  playing so plainly that every one knows it. Do you think that is  strange? Well, it may be, but it is strictly true.    No one may be able to explain why and how, but certainly it is true  that as we play our music all that goes on in the heart finds its way  into the head, and the arms, and the hands, into the music, off  through the air, and into the hearts of every one who is listening. So  it is a valuable truth for us to remember, that whatever we put into  our music will come out and we cannot stop it; and other people will  get it, and know what we are by it.    Once we fully understand how music will show forth our inmost feelings  we shall begin to understand its truthfulness and its power, as well  as its beauty. We shall see from our first days that music will tell  the truth. That will help us to understand a little the true mission  of art, \"either to state a true thing, or adorn a serviceable one.\"[7]  The moment we understand this _a very little_ we shall begin to love  art. We shall be glad and willing for music to reveal us, to show the  spirit within us, because little by little with the understanding will  come love and reverence for the beautiful thoughts that are locked up  in tones.    Men who want to tell something to very many people, many of whom they  do not know and to whom they cannot go, write down all they have to  say and make a book of it. There are some men, however, who have many  beautiful thoughts which they wish to tell to those who can  understand; these may dwell in their own land or in other lands; in  their own time or in future time. But the message of these men is so  beautiful and so delicate that it cannot be told in words, so they  tell it in music. Then, in their own land and in other lands, in their  own day and forever after, people can find out the delicate thoughts  by studying the pages of the music, seeking _with their hearts_ the  thought that came out of the master's heart.    Do you wonder that"]]]
