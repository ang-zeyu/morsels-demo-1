These, as they were peculiar acts  of continence, so were they as absolutely checks of curiosity, which  never sleeps in youthful breasts when beauty elicits admiration.    Cicero, treating of the many degrees of human commerce and society,  places matrimony in the first rank. In fact, marriage is not only a  state capable of the highest human felicity, but it is an institution  well calculated to destroy those rank and noxious weeds of the  passions which, by their pestiferous influence, spread misery and  death around the social hemisphere. Marriage is the basis of  community, and the cement of society;--it is, or ought to be, that  state of perfect friendship in which there are, according to  Pythagoras, \"two bodies with but one soul.\" It is in the genial  atmosphere of this noble communion of sentiment and affection that the  virtue of continence comes forth in all its dazzling splendour. Milton  has touched this subject with so chaste and elegant a pen, that the  description, one would think, must confirm the husband in his  happiness, and reclaim the man of profligate and licentious  principles:--      \"Hail, wedded love! mysterious law! true source    Of human offspring, sole propriety    In Paradise, of all things common else.    By thee adultrous lust was driven from men,    Among the beastial herds to range; by thee,    Founded in reason, loyal, just, and pure,    Relations dear, and all the charities    Of father, son, and brother, first were known.    Perpetual fountain of domestic sweets,    Whose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounc'd,    Present or past, as saints or patriarchs us'd.    Here Love his golden shafts employs; here lights    His constant lamp, and waves his purple wings:    Reigns here, and revels not in the bought smile    Of harlots, loveless, joyless, unendear'd,    Casual fruition; nor in court amours,    Mix'd dance, or wanton mask, or midnight ball;    Or serenade, which the starv'd lover sings    To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain.\"    J.P.           *       *       *       *       *      THE GREAT LORD THURLOW.      Of the eloquence of Lord Thurlow, and of his manner in debate, Mr.  Butler has given a striking account:--\"At times Lord Thurlow was  superlatively great. It was the good fortune of the Reminiscent to  hear his celebrated reply to the Duke of Grafton, during the inquiry  into Lord Sandwich's administration of Greenwich Hospital. His Grace's  action and delivery, when he addressed the house, were singularly  dignified and graceful; but his matter was not equal to his manner. He  reproached Lord Thurlow with his plebeian extraction, and his recent  admission into the peerage: particular circumstances caused Lord  Thurlow's reply to make a deep impression on the Reminiscent. His  lordship had spoken too often, and began to be heard with a civil but  visible impatience. Under these circumstances he was attacked in the  manner we have mentioned. He rose from the woolsack, and advanced  slowly to the place from which the chancellor generally addresses the  house; then fixing on the duke the look of Jove when he grasps the  thunder, 'I am amazed,' he said, in a level tone of voice, 'at the  attack the noble duke has made on me. Yes, my lords,' considerably  raising his voice, 'I am amazed at his grace's speech. The noble duke  cannot look before him, behind him, or on either side of him, without  seeing some noble peer who owes his seat in this house to his  successful exertions in the profession to which I belong. Does he not  feel that it is as honourable to owe it to these, as to being the  accident of an accident? To all these noble lords the language of the  noble duke is applicable and as insulting as it is to myself. But I  don't fear to meet it single and alone. No one venerates the peerage  more than I do;--but, my lords, I must say that the peerage solicited  me, not I the peerage;--nay, more, I can say, and will say, that as a  peer of parliament, as speaker of this right honourable house, as  keeper of the great seal, as guardian of his majesty's conscience, as  lord high chancellor of England, nay, even in that character alone in  which the noble duke would think it an affront to be considered--as a  _Man_, I am at this moment as respectable--I beg leave to add, I am at  this time as much respected, as the proudest peer I now look down  upon.' The effect of this speech, both within the walls of parliament  and out of them, was prodigious. It gave Lord Thurlow an ascendancy in  the house which no chancellor had ever possessed: it invested him, in  public opinion, with a character of independence and honour; and this,  though he was ever on the unpopular side in politics, made him always  popular with the people.\"    The legal talents and acquirements of Lord Thurlow have been the  subject of frequent panegyric; but it may, perhaps, be questioned,  whether in all cases those eulogiums were just. It has been said--but  with what truth it is difficult to form an opinion--that his lordship  was much indebted to Mr. Hargrave, for the learning by which his  judgments were sometimes distinguished, and that Mr. Hargrave received  a handsome remuneration for these services. \"As lord chancellor,\" says  a writer who was personally acquainted with his lordship, \"from a  well-placed confidence in Mr. Hargrave, who was indefatigable in his  service, he had occasion to give himself less trouble than any other  man in that high station. An old free-speaking companion of his, well  known at Lincoln's Inn, would sometimes say to me, 'I met the great  law lion this morning going to Westminster; but he was so busily  reading in the coach what his provider had supplied him with, that he  took no notice of me.'\"    The ardent zeal with which Lord Thurlow contested the great question  of the regency, led him, if we may credit the narrative of one who was  a party to the debate, to be guilty of an act of great disingenuousness.  Dr. Watson, the Bishop of Llandaff, in the course of a speech, in  which he supported the claims of the Prince of Wales, incidentally  cited a passage from Grotius, with regard to the definition of the  word _right_. \"The chancellor, in his reply,\" says the bishop in his  memoirs, \"boldly asserted that he perfectly well remembered the  passage I had quoted from Grotius, and that it solely respected  natural, but was inapplicable to civil, rights. Lord Loughborough, the  first time I saw him after the debate, assured me that before he went  to sleep that night he had looked into Grotius, and was astonished to  find that the chancellor, in contradicting me, had presumed on the  ignorance of the house, and that my quotation was perfectly correct.  What miserable shifts do great men submit to, in supporting their  parties! The Chancellor Thurlow,\" continues the bishop, \"was an able  and upright judge, but as the speaker of the house of lords, he was  domineering and insincere. It was said of him, that in the cabinet he  opposed everything, proposed nothing, and was ready to support  anything. I remember Lord Camden's saying to me one night, when the  chancellor was speaking contrary, as he thought, to his own  conviction, 'There now! I could not do that: he is supporting what he  does not believe a word of.'\"    _Roscoe's Lives of Eminent Lawyers--Cabinet Cyclopaedia_.           *       *       *       *       *        MANNERS AND CUSTOMS.           *       *       *       *       *      TORCHLIGHT.      It is an interesting circumstance in the habits of the ancient Romans,  that their journeys were pursued very much in the night-time, and by  torchlight. Cicero, in one of his letters, speaks of passing through  the towns of Italy by night, as a serviceable scheme for some  political purpose, either of avoiding too much to publish his motions,  or of evading the necessity (else perhaps not avoidable) of drawing  out the party sentiments of the magistrates in the circumstances of  honour or neglect with which they might choose to receive him. His  words, however, imply that the practice was by no means an uncommon  one. And, indeed, from some passages in writers of the Augustan era,  it would seem that this custom was not confined to people of  distinction, but was familiar to a class of travellers so low in rank  as to be capable of abusing their opportunities of concealment for the  infliction of wanton injury upon the woods and fences which bounded  the margin of the high-road. Under the cloud of night and solitude,  the mischief-loving traveller was often in the habit of applying his  torch to the withered boughs of wood, or to artificial hedges: and  extensive ravages by fire, such as now happen not unfrequently in the  American woods (but generally from carelessness in scattering the  glowing embers of a fire, or even the ashes of a pipe), were then  occasionally the result of mere wantonness of mischief. Ovid  accordingly notices, as one amongst the familiar images of daybreak,  the half-burnt torch of the traveller; and, apparently, from the  position which it holds in his description, where it is ranked with  the most familiar of all circumstances in all countries--that of the  rural labourer going out to his morning tasks it must have been common  indeed:      \"Semiustamque facem vigilata nocte viator    Ponet; et ad solitum rusticus ibit opus.\"    This occurs in the _Fasti_: elsewhere he notices it for its danger.      \"Ut facibus sepes ardent, cum forte viator    Vel nimis admovit, vel jam sub luce reliquit.\"    He, however, we see, good-naturedly ascribes the danger to mere  carelessness, in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11870"],[0,"The Country of the Blind, and Other Stories (#2)"],[1,"-a vision of buttered slides on a  busy day or of unprecedented worlds. In that spirit of miscellaneous  expectation these stories should be received. Each is intended to be a  thing by itself; and if it is not too ungrateful to kindly and  enterprising publishers, I would confess I would much prefer to see each  printed expensively alone, and left in a little brown-paper cover to lie  about a room against the needs of a quite casual curiosity. And I would  rather this volume were found in the bedrooms of convalescents and in  dentists' parlours and railway trains than in gentlemen's studies. I would  rather have it dipped in and dipped in again than read severely through.  Essentially it is a miscellany of inventions, many of which were very  pleasant to write; and its end is more than attained if some of them are  refreshing and agreeable to read. I have now re-read them all, and I am  glad to think I wrote them. I like them, but I cannot tell how much the  associations of old happinesses gives them a flavour for me. I make no  claims for them and no apology; they will be read as long as people read  them. Things written either live or die; unless it be for a place of  judgment upon Academic impostors, there is no apologetic intermediate  state.    I may add that I have tried to set a date to most of these stories, but  that they are not arranged in strictly chronological order.    H. G. WELLS.        CONTENTS.         I.

As I sit writing in my study, I can hear our Jane bumping her way  downstairs with a brush and dust-pan. She used in the old days to sing  hymn tunes, or the British national song for the time being, to these  instruments, but latterly she has been silent and even careful over her  work. Time was when I prayed with fervour for such silence, and my wife  with sighs for such care, but now they have come we are not so glad as we  might have anticipated we should be. Indeed, I would rejoice secretly,  though it may be unmanly weakness to admit it, even to hear Jane sing  \"Daisy,\" or, by the fracture of any plate but one of Euphemia's best green  ones, to learn that the period of brooding has come to an end.    Yet how we longed to hear the last of Jane's young man before we heard the  last of him! Jane was always very free with her conversation to my wife,  and discoursed admirably in the kitchen on a variety of topics--so well,  indeed, that I sometimes left my study door open--our house is a small  one--to partake of it. But after William came, it was always William,  nothing but William; William this and William that; and when we thought  William was worked out and exhausted altogether, then William all over  again. The engagement lasted altogether three years; yet how she got  introduced to William, and so became thus saturated with him, was always a  secret. For my part, I believe it was at the street corner where the Rev.  Barnabas Baux used to hold an open-air service after evensong on Sundays.  Young Cupids were wont to flit like moths round the paraffin flare of that  centre of High Church hymn-singing. I fancy she stood singing hymns there,  out of memory and her imagination, instead of coming home to get supper,  and William came up beside her and said, \"Hello!\" \"Hello yourself!\" she  said; and etiquette being satisfied, they proceeded to talk together.    As Euphemia has a reprehensible way of letting her servants talk to her,  she soon heard of him. \"He is _such_ a respectable young man, ma'am,\"  said Jane, \"you don't know.\" Ignoring the slur cast on her acquaintance,  my wife inquired further about this William.    \"He is second porter at Maynard's, the draper's,\" said Jane, \"and gets  eighteen shillings--nearly a pound--a week, m'm; and when the head porter  leaves he will be head porter. His relatives are quite superior people,  m'm. Not labouring people at all. His father was a greengrosher, m'm, and  had a churnor, and he was bankrup' twice. And one of his sisters is in a  Home for the Dying. It will be a very good match for me, m'm,\" said Jane,  \"me being an orphan girl.\"    \"Then you are engaged to him?\" asked my wife.    \"Not engaged, ma'am; but he is saving money to buy a ring--hammyfist.\"    \"Well, Jane, when you are properly engaged to him you may ask him round  here on Sunday afternoons, and have tea with him in the kitchen;\" for my  Euphemia has a motherly conception of her duty towards her maid-servants.  And presently the amethystine ring was being worn about the house, even  with ostentation, and Jane developed a new way of bringing in the joint so  that this gage was evident. The elder Miss Maitland was aggrieved by it,  and told my wife that servants ought not to wear rings. But my wife looked  it up in _Enquire Within_ and _Mrs. Motherly's Book of Household  Management_, and found no prohibition. So Jane remained with this  happiness added to her love.    The treasure of Jane's heart appeared to me to be what respectable people  call a very deserving young man. \"William, ma'am,\" said Jane one day  suddenly, with ill-concealed complacency, as she counted out the beer  bottles, \"William, ma'am, is a teetotaller. Yes, m'm; and he don't smoke.  Smoking, ma'am,\" said Jane, as one who reads the heart, \"_do_ make  such a dust about. Beside the waste of money. _And_ the smell.  However, I suppose they got to do it--some of them...\"    William was at first a rather shabby young man of the ready-made black  coat school of costume. He had watery gray eyes, and a complexion  appropriate to the brother of one in a Home for the Dying. Euphemia did  not fancy him very much, even at the beginning. His eminent respectability  was vouched for by an alpaca umbrella, from which he never allowed himself  to be parted.    \"He goes to chapel,\" said Jane. \"His papa, ma'am----\"    \"His _what_, Jane?\"    \"His papa, ma'am, was Church: but Mr. Maynard is a Plymouth Brother, and  William thinks it Policy, ma'am, to go there too. Mr. Maynard comes and  talks to him quite friendly when they ain't busy, about using up all the  ends of string, and about his soul. He takes a lot of notice, do Mr.  Maynard, of William, and the way he saves his soul, ma'am.\"    Presently we heard that the head porter at Maynard's had left, and that  William was head porter at twenty-three shillings a week. \"He is really  kind of over the man who drives the van,\" said Jane, \"and him married,  with three children.\" And she promised in the pride of her heart to make  interest for us with William to favour us so that we might get our parcels  of drapery from Maynard's with exceptional promptitude.    After this promotion a rapidly-increasing prosperity came upon Jane's  young man. One day we learned that Mr. Maynard had given William a book.  \"'Smiles' 'Elp Yourself,' it's called,\" said Jane; \"but it ain't comic. It  tells you how to get on in the world, and some what William read to me was  _lovely_, ma'am.\"    Euphemia told me of this, laughing, and then she became suddenly grave.  \"Do you know, dear,\" she said, \"Jane said one thing I did not like. She  had been quiet for a minute, and then she suddenly remarked, 'William is a  lot above me, ma'am, ain't he?'\"    \"I don't see anything in that,\" I said, though later my eyes were to be  opened.    One Sunday afternoon about that time I was sitting at my writing-desk--  possibly I was reading a good book--when a something went by the window. I  heard a startled exclamation behind me, and saw Euphemia with her hands  clasped together and her eyes dilated. \"George,\" she said in an  awe-stricken whisper, \"did you see?\"    Then we both spoke to one another at the same moment, slowly and solemnly:  \"_A silk hat! Yellow gloves! A new umbrella!_\"    \"It may be my fancy, dear,\" said Euphemia; \"but his tie was very like  yours. I believe Jane keeps him in ties. She told me a little while ago,  in a way that implied volumes about the rest of your costume, 'The master  _do_ wear pretty ties, ma'am.' And he echoes all your novelties.\"    The young couple passed our window again on their way to their customary  walk. They were arm in arm. Jane looked exquisitely proud, happy, and  uncomfortable, with new white cotton gloves, and William, in the silk hat,  singularly genteel!    That was the culmination of Jane's happiness. When she returned, \"Mr.  Maynard has been talking to William, ma'am,\" she said, \"and he is to serve  customers, just like the young shop gentlemen, during the next sale. And  if he gets on, he is to be made an assistant, ma'am, at the first  opportunity. He has got to be as gentlemanly as he can, ma'am; and if he  ain't, ma'am, he says it won't be for want of trying. Mr. Maynard has took  a great fancy to him.\"    \"He _is_ getting on, Jane,\" said my wife.    \"Yes, ma'am,\" said Jane thoughtfully; \"he _is_ getting on.\"    And she sighed.
