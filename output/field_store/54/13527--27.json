I knew everyone's business, and was ever in danger of publishing it at  an inopportune moment.    In flowery language, selected from slang used by the station hands, and  long words picked up from our visitors, I propounded unanswerable  questions which brought blushes to the cheeks of even tough old  wine-bibbers.    Nothing would induce me to show more respect to an appraiser of the runs  than to a boundary-rider, or to a clergyman than a drover. I am the same  to this day. My organ of veneration must be flatter than a pancake,  because to venerate a person simply for his position I never did or  will. To me the Prince of Wales will be no more than a shearer, unless  when I meet him he displays some personality apart from his  princeship--otherwise he can go hang.    Authentic record of the date when first I had a horse to myself has not  been kept, but it must have been early, as at eight I was fit to ride  anything on the place. Side-saddle, man-saddle, no-saddle, or astride  were all the same to me. I rode among the musterers as gamely as any of  the big sunburnt bushmen.    My mother remonstrated, opined I would be a great unwomanly tomboy. My  father poohed the idea.    \"Let her alone, Lucy,\" he said, \"let her alone. The rubbishing  conventionalities which are the curse of her sex will bother her soon  enough. Let her alone!\"    So, smiling and saying, \"She should have been a boy,\" my mother let me  alone, and I rode, and in comparison to my size made as much noise with  my stock-whip as any one. Accidents had no power over me, I came  unscathed out of droves of them.    Fear I knew not. Did a drunken tramp happen to kick up a row, I was  always the first to confront him, and, from my majestic and roly-poly  height of two feet six inches, demand what he wanted.    A digging started near us and was worked by a score of two dark-browed  sons of Italy. They made mother nervous, and she averred they were not  to be trusted, but I liked and trusted them. They carried me on their  broad shoulders, stuffed me with lollies and made a general pet of me.  Without the quiver of a nerve I swung down their deepest shafts in the  big bucket on the end of a rope attached to a rough windlass, which  brought up the miners and the mullock.    My brothers and sisters contracted mumps, measles, scarlatina, and  whooping-cough. I rolled in the bed with them yet came off scot-free. I  romped with dogs, climbed trees after birds' nests, drove the bullocks  in the dray, under the instructions of Ben, our bullocky, and always  accompanied my father when he went swimming in the clear, mountain,  shrub-lined stream which ran deep and lone among the weird gullies,  thickly carpeted with maidenhair and numberless other species of ferns.    My mother shook her head over me and trembled for my future, but father  seemed to consider me nothing unusual. He was my hero, confidant,  encyclopedia, mate, and even my religion till I was ten. Since then I  have been religionless.    Richard Melvyn, you were a fine fellow in those days! A kind and  indulgent parent, a chivalrous husband, a capital host, a man full of  ambition and gentlemanliness.        Amid these scenes, and the refinements and pleasures of Caddagat, which  lies a hundred miles or so farther Riverinawards, I spent the first  years of my childhood.          CHAPTER TWO    An Introduction to Possum Gully      I was nearly nine summers old when my father conceived the idea that he  was wasting his talents by keeping them rolled up in the small napkin of  an out-of-the-way place like Bruggabrong and the Bin Bin stations.  Therefore he determined to take up his residence in a locality where he  would have more scope for his ability.    When giving his reason for moving to my mother, he put the matter before  her thus: The price of cattle and horses had fallen so of late years  that it was impossible to make much of a living by breeding them. Sheep  were the only profitable article to have nowadays, and it would be  impossible to run them on Bruggabrong or either of the Bin Bins. The  dingoes would work havoc among them in no time, and what they left the  duffers would soon dispose of. As for bringing police into the matter,  it would be worse than useless. They could not run the offenders to  earth, and their efforts to do so would bring down upon their employer  the wrath of the duffers. Result, all the fences on the station would be  fired for a dead certainty, and the destruction of more than a hundred  miles of heavy log fencing on rough country like Bruggabrong was no  picnic to contemplate.    This was the feasible light in which father shaded his desire to leave.  The fact of the matter was that the heartless harridan, discontent, had  laid her claw-like hand upon him. His guests were ever assuring him he  was buried and wasted in Timlinbilly's gullies. A man of his  intelligence, coupled with his wonderful experience among stock, would,  they averred, make a name and fortune for himself dealing or  auctioneering if he only liked to try. Richard Melvyn began to think so  too, and desired to try. He did try.    He gave up Bruggabrong, Bin Bin East and Bin Bin West, bought Possum  Gully, a small farm of one thousand acres, and brought us all to live  near Goulburn. Here we arrived one autumn afternoon. Father, mother, and  children packed in the buggy, myself, and the one servant-girl, who had  accompanied us, on horseback. The one man father had retained in his  service was awaiting our arrival. He had preceded us with a  bullock-drayload of furniture and belongings, which was all father had  retained of his household property. Just sufficient for us to get along  with, until he had time to settle and purchase more, he said. That was  ten years ago, and that is the only furniture we possess yet--just  enough to get along with.    My first impression of Possum Gully was bitter disappointment--an  impression which time has failed to soften or wipe away.    How flat, common, and monotonous the scenery appeared after the rugged  peaks of the Timlinbilly Range!    Our new house was a ten-roomed wooden structure, built on a barren  hillside. Crooked stunted gums and stringybarks, with a thick underscrub  of wild cherry, hop, and hybrid wattle, clothed the spurs which ran up  from the back of the detached kitchen. Away from the front of the house  were flats, bearing evidence of cultivation, but a drop of water was  nowhere to be seen. Later, we discovered a few round, deep, weedy  waterholes down on the flat, which in rainy weather swelled to a stream  which swept all before it. Possum Gully is one of the best watered spots  in the district, and in that respect has stood to its guns in the  bitterest drought. Use and knowledge have taught us the full value of  its fairly clear and beautifully soft water. Just then, however, coming  from the mountains where every gully had its limpid creek, we turned in  disgust from the idea of having to drink this water.    I felt cramped on our new run. It was only three miles wide at its  broadest point. Was I always, always, always to live here, and never,  never, never to go back to Bruggabrong? That was the burden of the grief  with which I sobbed myself to sleep on the first night after our  arrival.    Mother felt dubious of her husband's ability to make a living off a  thousand acres, half of which were fit to run nothing but wallabies, but  father was full of plans, and very sanguine concerning his future. He  was not going to squat henlike on his place as the cockies around him  did. He meant to deal in stock making of Possum Gully merely a depot on  which to run some of his bargains until reselling.    Dear, oh dear! It was terrible to think he had wasted the greater part  of his life among the hills where the mail came but once a week, and  where the nearest town, of 650 inhabitants, was forty-six miles distant.  And the road had been impassable for vehicles. Here, only seventeen  miles from a city like Goulburn, with splendid roads, mail thrice  weekly, and a railway platform only eight miles away, why, man, my  fortune is made! Such were the sentiments to which he gave birth out of  the fullness of his hopeful heart.    Ere the diggings had broken out on Bruggabrong, our nearest neighbour,  excepting, of course, boundary-riders, was seventeen miles distant.  Possum Gully was a thickly populated district, and here we were  surrounded by homes ranging from half a mile to two and three miles  away. This was a new experience for us, and it took us some time to  become accustomed to the advantage and disadvantage of the situation.  Did we require an article, we found it handy, but decidedly the reverse  when our neighbours borrowed from us, and, in the greater percentage of  cases, failed to return the loan.          CHAPTER THREE    A Lifeless Life      Possum Gully was stagnant--stagnant with the narrow stagnation prevalent  in all old country places.    Its residents were principally married folk and children under sixteen.  The boys, as they attained manhood, drifted outback to shear, drove, or  to take up land. They found it too slow at home, and besides there was  not room enough for them there when they passed childhood.    Nothing ever happened there. Time was no object, and the days slid  quietly into the river of years, distinguished one from another by name  alone. An occasional birth or death was a big event, and the biggest  event of all was the advent of a new resident.    When such a thing occurred it was customary for all the male heads of  families to pay a visit of inspection, to judge if the new-comers were  worthy of admittance into the bosom of the society of the neighbourhood.  Should their report prove favourable, then their wives finished the  ceremony of inauguration by paying a friendly visit.    After his arrival at Possum Gully father was much away on business, and  so on my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11637"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 20, No. 558, July (#2)"],[1," of the world, and during the shepherd state of  society, men lived upon berries, and such fruits as the earth  spontaneously produced; we have mentioned generally how the philosophers  of Greece and Rome preferred to live, and there are not wanting  instances of men bred up in the sensuality of modern times who have  followed their example. The philosopher, Franklin, who reached a great  age, for a considerable portion of his life kept entirely to a vegetable  diet; and Abernethy, a name yet more familiar in our ears, has left us  this maxim, that \"a vegetable diet and abstinence from fermented liquors  tends more than anything else to tranquillize the system.\"--(vide the  _Abernethian Code_.) Another popular and scientific writer of the  present day makes a similar confession, which coming from such an  unexpected quarter carries weight: \"Although professedly friends to  gastronomy, moderated by a decided aversion to anything like sensuality,  we are of opinion that man is less fit to feed upon carnal than  vegetable substance.\" (Accum's _Culinary Chemistry_.)    The author of _The Art of Improving Health_, has also a passage in  point: \"An animal diet, especially in temperate climates, is more  wasting than a vegetable; because it excites by its stimulating  qualities a fever after every meal, by which the springs of life are  urged into constant and weakening exertions: on the contrary, a  vegetable diet tends to preserve a delicacy of feeling, a liveliness of  imagination, and an acuteness of judgment, seldom enjoyed by those who  live principally on meat.\" Thus we might go on multiplying authorities  on this subject, but we shall content ourselves with referring briefly  to one or two authors of a more literary stamp, and have done with  quotation. The eloquent Shelley, in his notes to _Queen Mab_, pretty  roundly assures us, that \"according to comparative anatomy, man  resembles frugivorous animals in everything, carnivorous in nothing;\"  and the famous author of the _Anatomy of Melancholy_, has quaintly but  nervously observed, \"As a lamp is choked with over much oil, or a fire  with too much wood, so is the natural heat strangled in the body by the  superfluous use of flesh; thus men wilfully pervert the good temperature  of their bodies, stifle their wits, strangle nature, and degenerate into  beasts.\" The somewhat visionary but fascinating Rousseau, has also in  his _Treatise of Education_, to which we refer our readers, most  powerfully condemned the use of flesh, and he humorously attributes the  proverbial boorishness of Englishmen to their fondness for roast beef!    And now let us look a little to facts: in all ages of the world those  have ever been the most savage nations which observed an animal diet.  Thus the Tartars, the Ethiopians, the Scythians, and the Arabians, who  live wholly on animal food, possess that ferocity of mind and fierceness  of character, common to carnivorous animals, while the vegetable diet of  the Brahmins and Hindoos gives to their character a gentleness and  mildness directly the reverse; potatoes, chestnuts, &c. satisfy the  wants of the Alpine peasant, and there are numerous, harmless tribes,  who feed solely on vegetables and water. Even Homer in his time has made  the Cyclops, who were flesh eaters, horrid monsters of men, and the  Lotophagi, he has described as a people so amiable, that when strangers  had once become acquainted with them, and tasted the fruits on which  they lived, they even forgot their native country to take up their abode  with their hosts. But in those civilized countries where animal food is  commonly eaten, it must follow that the lower orders, who compose the  great majority of the population, cannot partake of it in any great  quantities; now it does not appear that the rich enjoy better health  from this luxurious mode of living, or that the poor are less healthy  from the want of it; on the contrary, the wealthier classes are subject  to many chronic and other disorders arising from their aliment, and they  have a very large body of physicians, who subsist by a constant  attendance on them, while on the other hand, those in the lower walks of  life are seldom out of health, owing to their more simple and less  injurious mode of living; they suffer only from accident and natural  disease, and, generally speaking, when they are attacked, it proves  their first and last illness. Moreover, as the poor are more at ease  while they live, so too experience shows that they live longer; cases of  longevity are very rare with those in affluent circumstances, while most  of the famous instances on record of persons arriving at extraordinary  old age, have been peasants, fishermen, &c.    An hospital was established some short time since in the neighbourhood  of London for the purpose of experiment, and it was ascertained by  actual computation, and by comparison with the bills of mortality, that  an average number of persons will reach a greater age by observing  strictly a vegetable diet.    Compared with the English, the French have a greater proportion of  arable land than pasture, and consequently they rear fewer cattle, yet  they have a thriving population, and that would hardly be if they were  stinted in quality or quantity of food. The Irish peasantry live  principally on potatoes, yet they have seldom been found fault with as  labourers, and seem to be a well-built and able-bodied race of men. But  we have not only sufficient proof of the beneficial effect of vegetable  aliment--there are many instances on record, if we had time or space for  them--to show how detrimental the contrary regimen has sometimes been.  One example is worth mentioning: a man was prevailed on by a reward to  live upon partridges without any vegetables, but he was obliged to  desist at the end of eight days, from the appearance of strong symptoms  of putrefaction.    That we live upon meat, and yet increase in growth and strength is  little to the point, but whether we might not be still better without  it; dogs thrive upon flesh, but biscuits are better for them: that we  are fond of it is still less pertinent, for who does not know that  custom alters nature itself, that it becomes, in fact, a second nature,  and that such things as we are accustomed to, though actually evil in  their own nature, yet become gradually less offensive, and at last  pleasant. We have very remarkable proofs of this in all parts of the  world. In China they eat cats and dogs, while the poorer classes think  rats, mice, and other vermin, no bad food. The Romans thought peacocks a  dainty, which we quite nauseate. The Greenlander and the Esquimaux  relish train-oil, whilst these and all savages, on first tasting our  wines are disgusted and spit them out. Horse-flesh is commonly sold in  the markets of the north. Then again, there are some wandering Moors,  who subsist entirely on gum senegal, and there have been many cases of  shipwreck where the mariners have even subsisted for weeks on old shoes,  tobacco, or whatever they could get; in short, what cannot custom  effect? The Turk, by constant habit, is enabled to take opium in  quantities that would soon destroy us; and every one must have known  private cases where individuals in this country could take laudanum in  surprising doses; we have all more or less experienced the power of  habit in our acquired tastes, and whether we derive pleasure from the  fumes of tobacco, or approve the flavour of olives, we may remember that  at first we disliked, or were indifferent about either. History itself  informs us, that Mithridates was able to drink poison; and there was a  female slave, sent to Alexander by King Porus, who was even brought up  with it from her infancy. But to bring this influence of custom upon the  taste, still more in point, we find recorded in a work upon zoology, the  following remarkable case:--The provender for a lamb, which a ship's  company had on board, was all consumed; in the absence of other food  they offered it flesh, which it was at last compelled to devour, and  gradually acquired such a relish for this new aliment, that it could  never after be prevailed on to eat any thing else.    It is very certain that the most natural tastes are the most simple: our  first aliment is milk, and it is only by degrees we bring ourselves to  relish strong food; one speaking proof that such stimulating diet is not  natural to the human palate, is the indifference children have for such  food, and they evidently prefer pastry, fruit, &c., until the digestive  organs become more depraved. Neither has man the peculiarities of a  carnivorous animal; he has no hawk-bill, no sharp talons to tear his  prey, and he wants that strength of stomach and power of digestion which  is requisite to assimilate such heavy fare; his tongue is not rough,  but, as compared with that of ravenous animals, of a very smooth  texture; neither are his teeth pointed and rough like a saw, which above  all is a distinguishing mark. It is well known that in our West Indian  colonies, all the negroes still surviving, who were originally brought  over from Africa, have their teeth filed down to this day, which was at  first expressly done for the purpose of tearing and eating human flesh.  It is probable that the first man who adopted this most horrible custom,  was driven to it by necessity and the want or scarcity of other food,  and we know certainly that cannibals are as much excited by the spirit  of revenge as by an appetite for flesh, in devouring their captured  enemies; we, however, have not even this poor plea; we are even  ungrateful in attending to the satisfaction of our desires, for we kill  without remorse, as well the ox that labours for us, as the sheep that  clothes us, and disregarding all the natural wealth of the fields, and  the delicacies of the garden, we capriciously destroy creatures who are  no doubt sent into the world"]]]
