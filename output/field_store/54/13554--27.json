Facts, centuries before,    He traverses familiar,  As one should come to town  And tell you all your dreams were true;  He lived where dreams were sown.    His presence is enchantment,  You beg him not to go;  Old volumes shake their vellum heads  And tantalize, just so.            XI.    Much madness is divinest sense  To a discerning eye;  Much sense the starkest madness.  'T is the majority  In this, as all, prevails.  Assent, and you are sane;  Demur, -- you're straightway dangerous,  And handled with a chain.  XII.    I asked no other thing,  No other was denied.  I offered Being for it;  The mighty merchant smiled.    Brazil? He twirled a button,  Without a glance my way:  \"But, madam, is there nothing else  That we can show to-day?\"            XIII.    EXCLUSION.    The soul selects her own society,  Then shuts the door;  On her divine majority  Obtrude no more.    Unmoved, she notes the chariot's pausing  At her low gate;  Unmoved, an emperor is kneeling  Upon her mat.    I've known her from an ample nation  Choose one;  Then close the valves of her attention  Like stone.            XIV.    THE SECRET.    Some things that fly there be, --  Birds, hours, the bumble-bee:  Of these no elegy.    Some things that stay there be, --  Grief, hills, eternity:  Nor this behooveth me.    There are, that resting, rise.  Can I expound the skies?  How still the riddle lies!            XV.    THE LONELY HOUSE.    I know some lonely houses off the road  A robber 'd like the look of, --  Wooden barred,  And windows hanging low,  Inviting to  A portico,  Where two could creep:  One hand the tools,  The other peep  To make sure all's asleep.  Old-fashioned eyes,  Not easy to surprise!    How orderly the kitchen 'd look by night,  With just a clock, --  But they could gag the tick,  And mice won't bark;  And so the walls don't tell,  None will.    A pair of spectacles ajar just stir --  An almanac's aware.  Was it the mat winked,  Or a nervous star?  The moon slides down the stair  To see who's there.    There's plunder, -- where?  Tankard, or spoon,  Earring, or stone,  A watch, some ancient brooch  To match the grandmamma,  Staid sleeping there.    Day rattles, too,  Stealth's slow;  The sun has got as far  As the third sycamore.  Screams chanticleer,  \"Who's there?\"  And echoes, trains away,  Sneer -- \"Where?\"  While the old couple, just astir,  Fancy the sunrise left the door ajar!            XVI.    To fight aloud is very brave,  But gallanter, I know,  Who charge within the bosom,  The cavalry of woe.    Who win, and nations do not see,  Who fall, and none observe,  Whose dying eyes no country  Regards with patriot love.    We trust, in plumed procession,  For such the angels go,  Rank after rank, with even feet  And uniforms of snow.            XVII.    DAWN.    When night is almost done,  And sunrise grows so near  That we can touch the spaces,  It 's time to smooth the hair    And get the dimples ready,  And wonder we could care  For that old faded midnight  That frightened but an hour.            XVIII.    THE BOOK OF MARTYRS.    Read, sweet, how others strove,  Till we are stouter;  What they renounced,  Till we are less afraid;  How many times they bore  The faithful witness,  Till we are helped,  As if a kingdom cared!    Read then of faith  That shone above the fagot;  Clear strains of hymn  The river could not drown;  Brave names of men  And celestial women,  Passed out of record  Into renown!            XIX.    THE MYSTERY OF PAIN.    Pain has an element of blank;  It cannot recollect  When it began, or if there were  A day when it was not.    It has no future but itself,  Its infinite realms contain  Its past, enlightened to perceive  New periods of pain.            XX.    I taste a liquor never brewed,  From tankards scooped in pearl;  Not all the vats upon the Rhine  Yield such an alcohol!    Inebriate of air am I,  And debauchee of dew,  Reeling, through endless summer days,  From inns of molten blue.    When landlords turn the drunken bee  Out of the foxglove's door,  When butterflies renounce their drams,  I shall but drink the more!    Till seraphs swing their snowy hats,  And saints to windows run,  To see the little tippler  Leaning against the sun!            XXI.    A BOOK.    He ate and drank the precious words,  His spirit grew robust;  He knew no more that he was poor,  Nor that his frame was dust.  He danced along the dingy days,  And this bequest of wings  Was but a book. What liberty  A loosened spirit brings!            XXII.    I had no time to hate, because  The grave would hinder me,  And life was not so ample I  Could finish enmity.    Nor had I time to love; but since  Some industry must be,  The little toil of love, I thought,  Was large enough for me.            XXIII.    UNRETURNING.    'T was such a little, little boat  That toddled down the bay!  'T was such a gallant, gallant sea  That beckoned it away!    'T was such a greedy, greedy wave  That licked it from the coast;  Nor ever guessed the stately sails  My little craft was lost!            XXIV.    Whether my bark went down at sea,  Whether she met with gales,  Whether to isles enchanted  She bent her docile sails;    By what mystic mooring  She is held to-day, --  This is the errand of the eye  Out upon the bay.            XXV.    Belshazzar had a letter, --  He never had but one;  Belshazzar's correspondent  Concluded and begun  In that immortal copy  The conscience of us all  Can read without its glasses  On revelation's wall.            XXVI.    The brain within its groove  Runs evenly and true;  But let a splinter swerve,  'T were easier for you  To put the water back  When floods have slit the hills,  And scooped a turnpike for themselves,  And blotted out the mills!              II. LOVE.      I.    MINE.    Mine by the right of the white election!  Mine by the royal seal!  Mine by the sign in the scarlet prison  Bars cannot conceal!    Mine, here in vision and in veto!  Mine, by the grave's repeal  Titled, confirmed, -- delirious charter!  Mine, while the ages steal!            II.    BEQUEST.    You left me, sweet, two legacies, --  A legacy of love  A Heavenly Father would content,  Had He the offer of;    You left me boundaries of pain  Capacious as the sea,  Between eternity and time,  Your consciousness and me.            III.    Alter? When the hills do.  Falter? When the sun  Question if his glory  Be the perfect one.    Surfeit? When the daffodil  Doth of the dew:  Even as herself, O friend!  I will of you!            IV.    SUSPENSE.    Elysium is as far as to  The very nearest room,  If in that room a friend await  Felicity or doom.    What fortitude the soul contains,  That it can so endure  The accent of a coming foot,  The opening of a door!            V.    SURRENDER.    Doubt me, my dim companion!  Why, God would be content  With but a fraction of the love  Poured thee without a stint.  The whole of me, forever,  What more the woman can, --  Say quick, that I may dower thee  With last delight I own!    It cannot be my spirit,  For that was thine before;  I ceded all of dust I knew, --  What opulence the more  Had I, a humble maiden,  Whose farthest of degree  Was that she might,  Some distant heaven,  Dwell timidly with thee!            VI.    If you were coming in the fall,  I'd brush the summer by  With half a smile and half a spurn,  As housewives do a fly.    If I could see you in a year,  I'd wind the months in balls,  And put them each in separate drawers,  Until their time befalls.    If only centuries delayed,  I'd count them on my hand,  Subtracting till my fingers dropped  Into Van Diemen's land.    If certain, when this life was out,  That yours and mine should be,  I'd toss it yonder like a rind,  And taste eternity.    But now, all ignorant of the length  Of time's uncertain wing,  It goads me, like the goblin bee,  That will not state its sting.            VII.    WITH A FLOWER.    I hide myself within my flower,  That wearing on your breast,  You, unsuspecting, wear me too --  And angels know the rest.    I hide myself within my flower,  That, fading from your vase,  You, unsuspecting, feel for me  Almost a loneliness.            VIII.    PROOF.    That I did always love,  I bring thee proof:  That till I loved  I did not love enough.    That I shall love alway,  I offer thee  That love is life,  And life hath immortality.    This, dost thou doubt, sweet?  Then have I  Nothing to show  But Calvary.            IX.    Have you got a brook in your little heart,  Where bashful flowers blow,  And blushing birds go down to drink,  And shadows tremble so?    And nobody knows, so still it flows,  That any brook is there;  And yet your little draught of life  Is daily drunken there.    Then look out for the little brook in March,  When the rivers overflow,  And the snows come hurrying from the hills,  And the bridges often go.    And later, in August it may be,  When the meadows parching lie,  Beware, lest this little brook of life  Some burning noon go dry!            X.    TRANSPLANTED.    As if some little Arctic flower,  Upon the polar hem,  Went wandering down the latitudes,  Until it puzzled came  To continents of summer,  To firmaments of sun,  To strange, bright crowds of flowers,  And birds of foreign tongue!  I say, as if this little flower  To Eden wandered in --  What then? Why, nothing, only,  Your inference therefrom!            XI.    THE OUTLET.    My river runs to thee:  Blue sea, wilt welcome me?    My river waits reply.  Oh sea, look graciously!    I'll fetch thee brooks  From spotted nooks, --    Say, sea,  Take me!            XII.    IN VAIN.    I cannot live with you,  It would be life,  And life is over there  Behind the shelf    The sexton keeps the key to,  Putting up  Our life, his porcelain,  Like a cup    Discarded of the housewife,  Quaint or broken;  A newer"]]]
