I had with me a chair I had just purchased and told Mr.  Muller of the place near by, where I had obtained it, and suggested that  as but a few moments remained he had better buy one at once. His reply  was, \"No, my brother, Our Heavenly Father will send the chair from New  York. It is one used by Mrs. Muller, as we came over, and left in New  York when we landed. I wrote ten days ago to a brother who promised to  see it forwarded here last week. He has not been prompt as I would have  desired, but I am sure Our Heavenly Father will send the chair. Mrs.  Muller is very sick upon the sea, and has particularly desired to have  this same chair, and not finding it here yesterday when we arrived, as  we expected, we have made special prayer that Our Heavenly Father would  be pleased to provide it for us, and we will trust Him to do so.\" As  this dear man of God went peacefully on board the tender, running the  risk of Mrs. Muller making the voyage without a chair, when for a couple  of dollars she could have been provided for, I confess I feared Mr.  Muller was carrying his faith principles too far and not acting wisely.    I was kept at the express office ten minutes after Mr. Muller left. Just  as I started to hurry to the wharf a team drove up the street, and on  top of a load just arrived from New York, _was Mr. Muller's chair_! It  was sent at once to the tender and placed in _my hands_ to take to Mr.  Muller (the Lord having a lesson for me) just as the boat was leaving  the dock. I found Mr. and Mrs. Muller in a retired spot on one side of  the tender and handed him the chair. He took it with the happy, pleased  expression of a child who has just received a kindness deeply  appreciated, and reverently removing his hat and folding his hands over  it, he thanked his Heavenly Father for sending the chair. \"In  _everything_ by prayer and supplication let your requests be made known  unto God.\" \"Casting _all_ your care upon Him, for He careth for you.\"    So the word of God teaches us as His children (_inviting_ us to pray,  _commanding_ us to pray, and _teaching us_ how to pray), that there is a  divine reality in prayer. Experience abundantly corroborates the  teaching.    Every truly converted man knows from this experience that God answers  prayer. He has verified the promise. \"Call unto me, and I will answer  thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.\"  (Jer. xxxiii., 8.) His life is a life of prayer, and grows more and more  to be a life of almost unconscious dependence upon God, as he becomes  fixed in the habit of prayer. This, and it is the purpose of God, is the  result secured by prayer. With this in view, it will not be so much what  we expect to get by praying, as a consciousness of coming into closer  relations to God, the giver of all, in our prayers, that will give us  true joy.    Often God's children are driven to the throne of grace by some desperate  need of help and definite supply of an absolute want, and, as they cry  to God and plead their case with tears before him, he so manifests his  presence to them and so fills them with a consciousness of his love and  power, that the burden is gone and _without the want being supplied_  that drove them to God, they rejoice in _God himself_ and care not for  the deprivation. This was Paul's experience when he went thus to God  about the thorn, and came away without the specific relief he had prayed  for, but with such a blessing as a result of his drawing near to God,  that he little cared whether the thorn remained or not--or, rather,  rejoiced that it was not removed; that it might be used to keep him near  to God, whose love so filled his soul.    A widow once told the writer of the turning point in her Christian life,  when God's love was so shed abroad in her heart that she had been  enabled to go on through all her trials rejoicingly conscious of God's  presence, and casting all her burdens upon Him. She was driven to seek  God by great need. Her husband's death left her destitute, with little  children to provide for, and few friends from whom to look for  continuous aid. Winter drew on, and, one day, her little boy came in  shivering with cold and asked if he could not have a fur cap, as his  straw hat was very cold and none of the boys at school wore straw hats.  She was without a cent in the world. She gave a hopeful answer to the  boy and sent him out to play, and then went to her bedroom and knelt and  wept in utter desolation of heart before God, praying most earnestly  that God would give her a token that He _was_ her God and was caring for  her by sending her a cap for her boy. While she prayed the peace of God  filled her soul. She was made to feel the presence of her Saviour in  such a way that all doubts as to his love for her and his fulfillment of  all his promises to care for her vanished away, and she went out of her  room, rejoicing in the Lord and singing his praise. She had no burden  about the cap, and was quite content for God to send it or not as it  pleased Him; and, in the afternoon, when a neighbor called, occupied  with the Lord and his wonderful love, the thought of the cap had gone  from her mind. When the neighbor rose to depart, she said, \"You know my  little boy died last fall. Just before he died I bought him a fur cap:  he only wore it two or three times. After his death I put away all his  things and thought I could never part with any of them. But, this  morning, as I went to the drawer to look them over, I felt that I should  give you this cap for your little boy. Will you take it of me?\" As she  took the cap and told her neighbor of the morning trial, prayer and  blessing, two souls were filled with the sense of the reality of prayer  and the love of God for his children. \"My little boy,\" said the widow,  \"wore that cap for three winters. And often, when sorely tried by my  circumstances, has God lifted the burden from my heart, by my just  looking at it, and remembering the blessing that came with it.\"    Experiences like this God gives to all his children, not for the purpose  of leading them to look to Him for supplying their physical necessities,  as an end, but to make Himself known to them, and to secure their  confidence and love, for \"this is life eternal, that they might know  Thee, the only true God and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.\" (Jno.  xvii, 8.)    The use of prayer is to bring us into communion with God, for the growth  of the spiritual life, that is ours by faith in Christ Jesus. To leave  it upon any lower plane than this, is to rob it of its highest functions  and to paralyze it of lasting power for good in any direction. The  promises of God are conditioned upon our being in this state of heart  toward God. \"If ye abide in me and my words abide in you, ye shall ask  what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.\" (Jno. xv., 7.) Abiding in  Christ, our will will be His will, as to desiring that which will most  advance the divine life and promote confidence in God, and all our  desires for material blessings will be subordinated to this motive.  Right here must come in a line of truth that will lead us from the  spirit of dictation in our prayers to God in all matters pertaining to  our worldly concerns. We cannot tell what is for our highest spiritual  good. The saving of our property or the taking it away. The recovery  from sickness or the continuance of it; the restoration of the health of  our loved one, or his departing to be with Christ; the removing the  thorn or the permitting it to remain. \"_In everything_\" it is indeed our  blessed privilege to let _our requests_ be make known unto God, but,  praise his name, he has not passed over to us the awful responsibility  of the assurance that _in everything_ the requests we make known will be  granted. He has reserved the decision, where we should rejoice to leave  it, to his infinite wisdom and his infinite love.    There is a danger to be carefully guarded against in the reading of this  book and in the consideration of the precious truth. The incidents it  relates bring before the mind, of the unlimited resources and the  unquenchable love of God, that are made available to believing prayer.  That danger has been suggested by what has been said, that the highest  use of prayer is to bring the soul nearer to God, and _not the making of  it a mere matter of convenience to escape physical ills or supply  physical necessities_.    \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh\" and continues flesh until the  end. \"Have no confidence in the flesh\" is always a much needed  exhortation. Now, unquestionably, the desires of the natural heart may  and do deceive us, and often lead as to believe that our fervent earnest  prayer for temporal blessing is led of the Spirit, when the mind of the  Spirit is, that we will be made more humble, more Christ-like and more  useful by being denied than by being granted. Again, we are in danger of  disobeying the plain commands of _God's word_ in allowing prayer ever to  take the place of anything _in our power_ to do, and _that we are  commanded to do as a means to secure needed good_. He who has said \"pray  always,\" has also said, \"Be ambitious to be quiet and to do your own  business, and to work with your hands, even as we charged you; that ye  may walk honestly toward them that are without, and may have need of  nothing.\" (1 Thess., iv., 11, 12; R.V.)    How often the _flesh_ has led men to read (Phil, iv., 19): \"My God shall  supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus,\"  in a spirit entirely opposed to this exhortation. They have ceased to  labor with their hands, and, without warrant in the providences of God  and the judgment of brethren, have turned from doing their own business,  expecting the Lord to pay their debts and provide for their necessities.  The quotations of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11560"],[0,"The Barbarism of Berlin (#2)"],[1,"ay, \"We are all responsible for  this; but let us hope it will not spread. Let us hope for the happy day  when we shall leave off chopping at the man's head; and when nobody shall  ever chop anything for ever and ever.\" Do we say, \"Let bygones be bygones;  why go back to all the dull details with which the business began; who can  tell with what sinister motives the man was standing there, within reach of  the hatchet?\" We do not. We keep the peace in private life by asking for  the facts of provocation, and the proper object of punishment. We do go  into the dull details; we do enquire into the origins; we do emphatically  enquire who it was that hit first. In short, we do what I have done very  briefly in this place.    Given this, it is indeed true that behind these facts there are truths;  truths of a terrible, of a spiritual sort. In mere fact, the Germanic  power has been wrong about Servia, wrong about Russia, wrong about Belgium,  wrong about England, wrong about Italy. But there was a reason for its  being wrong everywhere; and of that root reason, which has moved half the  world against it, I shall speak later in this series. For that is something  too omnipresent to be proved, too indisputable to be helped by detail. It  is nothing less than the locating, after more than a hundred years of  recriminations and wrong explanations, of the modern European evil; the  finding of the fountain from which poison has flowed upon all the nations  of the earth.          I    THE WAR ON THE WORD      It will hardly be denied that there is one lingering doubt in many, who  recognise unavoidable self-defence in the instant parry of the English  sword, and who have no great love for the sweeping sabre of Sadowa and  Sedan. That doubt is the doubt whether Russia, as compared with Prussia,  is sufficiently decent and democratic to be the ally of liberal and  civilised powers. I take first, therefore, this matter of civilisation.    It is vital in a discussion like this that we should make sure we are  going by meanings and not by mere words. It is not necessary in any  argument to settle what a word means or ought to mean. But it is necessary  in every argument to settle what we propose to mean by the word. So long  as our opponent understands what is the _thing_ of which we are talking,  it does not matter to the argument whether the word is or is not the one  he would have chosen. A soldier does not say \"We were ordered to go to  Mechlin; but I would rather go to Malines.\" He may discuss the etymology  and archaeology of the difference on the march: but the point is that he  knows where to go. So long as we know what a given word is to mean in  a given discussion, it does not even matter if it means something else  in some other and quite distinct discussion. We have a perfect right to  say that the width of a window comes to four feet; even if we instantly  and cheerfully change the subject to the larger mammals, and say that an  elephant has four feet. The identity of the words does not matter, because  there is no doubt at all about the meanings; because nobody is likely to  think of an elephant as four feet long, or of a window as having tusks and  a curly trunk.    It is essential to emphasise this consciousness of the _thing_ under  discussion in connection with two or three words that are, as it were, the  key-words of this war. One of them is the word \"barbarian.\" The Prussians  apply it to the Russians: the Russians apply it to the Prussians. Both,  I think, really mean something that really exists, name or no name. Both  mean different things. And if we ask what these different things are, we  shall understand why England and France prefer Russia; and consider Prussia  the really dangerous barbarian of the two. To begin with, it goes so much  deeper even than atrocities; of which, in the past at least, all the three  Empires of Central Europe have partaken pretty equally, as they partook of  Poland. An English writer, seeking to avert the war by warnings against  Russian influence, said that the flogged backs of Polish women stood  between us and the Alliance. But not long before, the flogging of women by  an Austrian general led to that officer being thrashed in the streets of  London by Barclay and Perkins' draymen. And as for the third power, the  Prussians, it seems clear that they have treated Belgian women in a style  compared with which flogging might be called an official formality. But, as  I say, something much deeper than any such recrimination lies behind the  use of the word on either side. When the German Emperor complains of our  allying ourselves with a barbaric and half-oriental power, he is not (I  assure you) shedding tears over the grave of Kosciusko. And when I say (as  I do most heartily) that the German Emperor is a barbarian, I am not merely  expressing any prejudices I may have against the profanation of churches  or of children. My countrymen and I mean a certain and intelligible thing  when we call the Prussians barbarians. It is quite different from the  thing attributed to Russians; and it could not possibly be attributed to  Russians. It is very important that the neutral world should understand  what this thing is.    If the German calls the Russian barbarous, he presumably means imperfectly  civilised. There is a certain path along which Western nations have  proceeded in recent times, and it is tenable that Russia has not proceeded  so far as the others: that she has less of the special modern system in  science, commerce, machinery, travel, or political constitution. The  Russ ploughs with an old plough; he wears a wild beard; he adores  relics; his life is as rude and hard as that of a subject of Alfred the  Great. Therefore he is, in the German sense, a barbarian. Poor fellows like  Gorky and Dostoieffsky have to form their own reflections on the scenery  without the assistance of large quotations from Schiller on garden seats,  or inscriptions directing them to pause and thank the All-Father for  the finest view in Hesse-Pumpernickel. The Russians, having nothing but  their faith, their fields, their great courage, and their self-governing  communes, are quite cut off from what is called (in the fashionable street  in Frankfort) The True, The Beautiful and The Good. There is a real sense  in which one can call such backwardness barbaric, by comparison with the  Kaiserstrasse; and in that sense it is true of Russia.    Now we, the French and English, do not mean this when we call the Prussians  barbarians. If their cities soared higher than their flying ships, if  their trains travelled faster than their bullets, we should still call  them barbarians. We should know exactly what we meant by it; and we  should know that it is true. For we do not mean anything that is an  imperfect civilisation by accident. We mean something that is the enemy  of civilisation by design. We mean something that is wilfully at war with  the principles by which human society has been made possible hitherto. Of  course it must be partly civilised even to destroy civilisation. Such  ruin could not be wrought by the savages that are merely undeveloped or  inert. You could not have even Huns without horses; or horses without  horsemanship. You could not have even Danish pirates without ships,  or ships without seamanship. This person, whom I may call the Positive  Barbarian, must be rather more superficially up-to-date than what I may  call the Negative Barbarian. Alaric was an officer in the Roman legions:  but for all that he destroyed Rome. Nobody supposes that Eskimos could  have done it at all neatly. But (in our meaning) barbarism is not a matter  of methods, but of aims. We say that these veneered vandals have the  perfectly serious aim of destroying certain ideas, which, as they think,  the world has outgrown; without which, as we think, the world will die.    It is essential that this perilous peculiarity in the Pruss, or Positive  Barbarian, should be seized. He has what he fancies is a new idea; and  he is going to apply it to everybody. As a fact it is simply a false  generalisation; but he is really trying to make it general. This does  not apply to the Negative Barbarian: it does not apply to the Russian  or the Servian, even if they are barbarians. If a Russian peasant does  beat his wife, he does it because his fathers did it before him: he is  likely to beat less rather than more, as the past fades away. He does  not think, as the Prussian would, that he has made a new discovery in  physiology in finding that a woman is weaker than a man. If a Servian  does knife his rival without a word, he does it because other Servians  have done it. He may regard it even as piety, but certainly not as  progress. He does not think, as the Prussian does, that he founds a new  school of horology by starting before the word \"Go.\" He does not think  he is in advance of the world in militarism merely because he is behind  it in morals. No; the danger of the Pruss is that he is prepared to  fight for old errors as if they were new truths. He has somehow heard  of certain shallow simplifications, and imagines that we have never  heard of them. And, as I have said, his limited, but very sincere lunacy  concentrates chiefly in a desire to destroy two ideas, the twin root ideas  of rational society. The first is the idea of record and promise: the  second is the idea of reciprocity.    It is plain that the promise, or extension of responsibility through time,  is what chiefly distinguishes us, I will not say from savages, but from  brutes and reptiles. This was noted by the shrewdness of the Old Testament,  when it summed up the dark irresponsible enormity of Leviathan in the  words, \"Will he make a pact with thee?\" The promise, like the wheel, is  unknown in Nature: and is the first mark of man. Referring only to human  civilisation, it may be said with seriousness that in the beginning was  the Word."]]]
