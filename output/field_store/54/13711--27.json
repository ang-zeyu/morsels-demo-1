A belief in the existence of Vampyres first took its rise in Norway and  Sweden, from whence it rapidly spread to more southern regions, taking a  firm hold of the imaginations of the more credulous portion of mankind.    The following romance is collected from seemingly the most authentic  sources, and the Author must leave the question of credibility entirely  to his readers, not even thinking that he is peculiarly called upon to  express his own opinion upon the subject.    Nothing has been omitted in the life of the unhappy Varney, which could  tend to throw a light upon his most extraordinary career, and the fact  of his death just as it is here related, made a great noise at the time  through Europe and is to be found in the public prints for the year  1713.    With these few observations, the Author and Publisher, are well content  to leave the work in the hands of a public, which has stamped it with an  approbation far exceeding their most sanguine expectations, and which is  calculated to act as the strongest possible incentive to the production  of other works, which in a like, or perchance a still further degree may  be deserving of public patronage and support.    To the whole of the Metropolitan Press for their laudatory notices, the  Author is peculiarly obliged.    _London Sep. 1847_          VARNEY, THE VAMPYRE;    OR    THE FEAST OF BLOOD    A Romance          CHAPTER I.        ----\"How graves give up their dead.

[Illustration]    The solemn tones of an old cathedral clock have announced midnight--the  air is thick and heavy--a strange, death like stillness pervades all  nature. Like the ominous calm which precedes some more than usually  terrific outbreak of the elements, they seem to have paused even in  their ordinary fluctuations, to gather a terrific strength for the great  effort. A faint peal of thunder now comes from far off. Like a signal  gun for the battle of the winds to begin, it appeared to awaken them  from their lethargy, and one awful, warring hurricane swept over a whole  city, producing more devastation in the four or five minutes it lasted,  than would a half century of ordinary phenomena.    It was as if some giant had blown upon some toy town, and scattered many  of the buildings before the hot blast of his terrific breath; for as  suddenly as that blast of wind had come did it cease, and all was as  still and calm as before.    Sleepers awakened, and thought that what they had heard must be the  confused chimera of a dream. They trembled and turned to sleep again.    All is still--still as the very grave. Not a sound breaks the magic of  repose. What is that--a strange, pattering noise, as of a million of  fairy feet? It is hail--yes, a hail-storm has burst over the city.  Leaves are dashed from the trees, mingled with small boughs; windows  that lie most opposed to the direct fury of the pelting particles of ice  are broken, and the rapt repose that before was so remarkable in its  intensity, is exchanged for a noise which, in its accumulation, drowns  every cry of surprise or consternation which here and there arose from  persons who found their houses invaded by the storm.    Now and then, too, there would come a sudden gust of wind that in its  strength, as it blew laterally, would, for a moment, hold millions of  the hailstones suspended in mid air, but it was only to dash them with  redoubled force in some new direction, where more mischief was to be  done.    Oh, how the storm raged! Hail--rain--wind. It was, in very truth, an  awful night.           *       *       *       *       *    There is an antique chamber in an ancient house. Curious and quaint  carvings adorn the walls, and the large chimney-piece is a curiosity of  itself. The ceiling is low, and a large bay window, from roof to floor,  looks to the west. The window is latticed, and filled with curiously  painted glass and rich stained pieces, which send in a strange, yet  beautiful light, when sun or moon shines into the apartment. There is  but one portrait in that room, although the walls seem panelled for the  express purpose of containing a series of pictures. That portrait is of  a young man, with a pale face, a stately brow, and a strange expression  about the eyes, which no one cared to look on twice.    There is a stately bed in that chamber, of carved walnut-wood is it  made, rich in design and elaborate in execution; one of those works of  art which owe their existence to the Elizabethan era. It is hung with  heavy silken and damask furnishing; nodding feathers are at its  corners--covered with dust are they, and they lend a funereal aspect to  the room. The floor is of polished oak.    God! how the hail dashes on the old bay window! Like an occasional  discharge of mimic musketry, it comes clashing, beating, and cracking  upon the small panes; but they resist it--their small size saves them;  the wind, the hail, the rain, expend their fury in vain.    The bed in that old chamber is occupied. A creature formed in all  fashions of loveliness lies in a half sleep upon that ancient couch--a  girl young and beautiful as a spring morning. Her long hair has escaped  from its confinement and streams over the blackened coverings of the  bedstead; she has been restless in her sleep, for the clothing of the  bed is in much confusion. One arm is over her head, the other hangs  nearly off the side of the bed near to which she lies. A neck and bosom  that would have formed a study for the rarest sculptor that ever  Providence gave genius to, were half disclosed. She moaned slightly in  her sleep, and once or twice the lips moved as if in prayer--at least  one might judge so, for the name of Him who suffered for all came once  faintly from them.    She has endured much fatigue, and the storm does not awaken her; but it  can disturb the slumbers it does not possess the power to destroy  entirely. The turmoil of the elements wakes the senses, although it  cannot entirely break the repose they have lapsed into.    Oh, what a world of witchery was in that mouth, slightly parted, and  exhibiting within the pearly teeth that glistened even in the faint  light that came from that bay window. How sweetly the long silken  eyelashes lay upon the cheek. Now she moves, and one shoulder is  entirely visible--whiter, fairer than the spotless clothing of the bed  on which she lies, is the smooth skin of that fair creature, just  budding into womanhood, and in that transition state which presents to  us all the charms of the girl--almost of the child, with the more  matured beauty and gentleness of advancing years.    Was that lightning? Yes--an awful, vivid, terrifying flash--then a  roaring peal of thunder, as if a thousand mountains were rolling one  over the other in the blue vault of Heaven! Who sleeps now in that  ancient city? Not one living soul. The dread trumpet of eternity could  not more effectually have awakened any one.    The hail continues. The wind continues. The uproar of the elements seems  at its height. Now she awakens--that beautiful girl on the antique bed;  she opens those eyes of celestial blue, and a faint cry of alarm bursts  from her lips. At least it is a cry which, amid the noise and turmoil  without, sounds but faint and weak. She sits upon the bed and presses  her hands upon her eyes. Heavens! what a wild torrent of wind, and rain,  and hail! The thunder likewise seems intent upon awakening sufficient  echoes to last until the next flash of forked lightning should again  produce the wild concussion of the air. She murmurs a prayer--a prayer  for those she loves best; the names of those dear to her gentle heart  come from her lips; she weeps and prays; she thinks then of what  devastation the storm must surely produce, and to the great God of  Heaven she prays for all living things. Another flash--a wild, blue,  bewildering flash of lightning streams across that bay window, for an  instant bringing out every colour in it with terrible distinctness. A  shriek bursts from the lips of the young girl, and then, with eyes fixed  upon that window, which, in another moment, is all darkness, and with  such an expression of terror upon her face as it had never before known,  she trembled, and the perspiration of intense fear stood upon her brow.    \"What--what was it?\" she gasped; \"real, or a delusion? Oh, God, what was  it? A figure tall and gaunt, endeavouring from the outside to unclasp  the window. I saw it. That flash of lightning revealed it to me. It  stood the whole length of the window.\"    There was a lull of the wind. The hail was not falling so  thickly--moreover, it now fell, what there was of it, straight, and yet  a strange clattering sound came upon the glass of that long window. It  could not be a delusion--she is awake, and she hears it. What can  produce it? Another flash of lightning--another shriek--there could be  now no delusion.    A tall figure is standing on the ledge immediately outside the long  window. It is its finger-nails upon the glass that produces the sound so  like the hail, now that the hail has ceased. Intense fear paralysed the  limbs of that beautiful girl. That one shriek is all she can utter--with  hands clasped, a face of marble, a heart beating so wildly in her bosom,  that each moment it seems as if it would break its confines, eyes  distended and fixed upon the window, she waits, froze with horror. The  pattering and clattering of the nails continue. No word is spoken, and  now she fancies she can trace the darker form of that figure against the  window, and she can see the long arms moving to and fro, feeling for  some mode of entrance.

There was a  book about something like that once. He is just waiting to make one more  grand coup, rob the bank or something and then the world will be  startled by the news of their elopement. They will go and live somewhere  luxuriously in the south Pacific, and travellers will bring home strange  stories of their happiness and charm. Perhaps, though, he would turn  pirate. That would suit his style.\"    \"I hope,\" said Holland, \"that he won't take a fancy to rob the  Hillsborough Bank, for I consider it public spirited to keep quite a  little money there. You begin to make me nervous.\"    \"No bank robbery would make _me_ nervous,\" replied his sister, \"that is  the comfort of being insignificant. I have not enough money in any bank  to know the difference, and as for my humble dwelling in Hillsborough,  who would take the trouble to rifle it when Geoffrey's palace is within  an easy walk. Besides, I haven't anything worth the attention of a  respectable burglar like this one.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Geoffrey, \"I'm sorry I spent so much time choosing  your Christmas present a year ago.\"    \"Oh, of course, Geof dear, that wonderful old silver is valuable, but it  is put away where I defy any burglar to find it. There is only my sable  coat, and I am going to send for that as soon as I have time to have it  cut over.\"    \"In my opinion,\" said Mr. Vaughan, \"the man is no longer in the  neighbourhood. He would scarcely dare try a fifth attempt while the  whole country was so aroused. You see Hillsborough has always been an  attractive place to thieves. It is such an easy place to get away  from,--three railroads within reach. A man would be pretty sure to be  able to catch a passing freight train on one of them at almost any time,  to say nothing of the increased difficulty of tracing him.\"    \"I don't suppose he will ever be caught,\" said Florence. \"When he has  got all he wants he will simply melt away and be forgotten. If he were  caught--\"    Here she was interrupted by the waiter who laid a telegram at her plate.  It had come to her brother's apartment, and been sent down.    \"Who is telegraphing me,\" she said, as she tore it open. \"I hope Jack  has not been breaking himself.\"    Opening it, she read:    \"Your house was entered about five o'clock this afternoon. Tea-set and  sable coat missing.\"          II      The next evening at seven o'clock, Holland stepped out of the train on  the Hillsborough station. He wore a long fur-coat, for the morning had  been bitterly cold in New York, and though the snow was now falling in  small close flakes, the temperature had not risen appreciably, and a  wild wind was blowing.    He looked about for the figure of McFarlane, for he had telegraphed the  old man to meet him at the train with a trap, but there was no one to be  seen. The station, which in summer on the arrival of the express was a  busy scene with well dressed women and well-kept horses, was now utterly  deserted except for one native who had charge of the mails.    \"Hullo, Harris,\" Geoffrey sung out. \"Is McFarlane here for me?\"    \"Ain't seen him. Guess it's too stormy for the old man,\" Harris replied  dropping the mail bag into his wagon.    \"Then you've got to drive me out.\"    \"What, all the way to your place? No, sir, I guess it is too stormy for  me, too.\"    But Geoffrey at last, by the promise of three times what the trip was  worth, induced Harris to change his mind. He stepped into the mail cart,  and having stopped at the post-office to leave the bag, and at the  stable to change the cart for a sleigh, they finally set out on their  five-mile drive.    \"Guess you come up to see about Mr. May's house being robbed?\" Harris  hazarded before they had gone far.    \"You're a nice lot, aren't you?\" returned Geoffrey. \"Five robberies and  not a motion to catch the thief!\"    \"Oh, I dunno, I dunno, there is a big reward out to-day,\" said Harris,  divided between pride in the notoriety and shame at the lawlessness of  his native town.    \"Yes, but not by any of you.\"    \"Well, the boys did talk some of a vigilance committee, if any more  houses was robbed.\"    \"They are going to wait for him to make up his half dozen.\"    \"Well, to tell the truth,\" said Harris, \"it seems like he only went for  you city folks, and I guess the boys thought you could better afford to  lose a few things than they could to lose their sleep. That's about the  size of it.\"    Geoffrey could not but laugh. \"That's a fine spirited way to look at it,  I must say.\"    \"Well,\" returned Harris, who appeared to have need of the monosyllable  in order to collect and arrange his ideas. \"'Tain't lack of sand  exactly, either, for most of the fellows about here thinks it is a  woman.\"    \"A woman?\" cried Geoffrey, remembering the lady in Boston.    \"Yes, _sir_,\" said Harris, \"a young woman. Look at the things took. What  burglar would want sheets and a lady's coat? Besides just before the  first one happened, Will Brown, he was driving along up your way and a  young woman, pretty as a picter, Will said, slips out of the wood and  asks for a lift. Well, Will takes her some two miles, and when they got  to that piece of woods at the back of your place she says of a sudden  that she guesses she wants exercise, and will walk the rest of the way,  and out she gets, and no one has seen her since. Seems kinder strange,  no house but yours within six miles, and you away.\"    \"It would have seemed quite as strange if I had been at home,\" returned  Geoffrey, amused at his imputation.    \"Well,\" Harris went on imperturbably, \"you can't tell the rights of them  stories. Will Brown, he's a liar, just like all the Browns; still this  time he seemed to think he was telling the truth. Looks like we were  going to have a blizzard, don't it?\"    When they reached the McFarlane cottage, Mrs. McFarlane appeared bobbing  on the threshold. She was an old Scotch woman and covered all occasions  with courtesy. It appeared that Holland's telegram had been duly  telephoned from the office, but that her husband was down with  rheumatism, the second gardener dismissed, and the \"boy\" allowed to go  home to spend Christmas, so that there had been no one to send. Geoffrey  suggested that she might have telephoned to the local livery-stable, and  she was at once so overcome at her own stupidity that she could do  nothing but bob and murmur, until Geoffrey sent her away to get him  something to eat.    It was about ten o'clock, when he determined to take a turn about his  house. The next day he intended removing all valuables to the vaults of  the Hillsborough bank.    It was a long walk from the cottage, and Geoffrey, as he trudged up hill  against the wind, was surprised to find how much snow had already  fallen. He had expected to return to New York the next day, but now a  fair prospect of being stalled on the way presented itself. It took him  so much longer to reach the house than he had supposed, that he  abandoned all idea of entering it. It stood before him grimly like a  mountain of grey stone, its face plastered with snow. He walked round  it, feeling each door and window to be sure of the fastenings. Once past  the corner, the house sheltered him from the wind. He was conscious of  that exhilaration snow storms so often bring, while at the same time the  atmosphere of desolation that surrounds all shut up houses, even one's  own, took hold of him. Unconsciously he stopped and felt in his pocket  for his revolver, and at the same moment, faintly, in the interior of  the house, he heard a clock strike.    The sound was not perhaps alarming in itself, yet it sounded ominously  in Geoffrey's ears. He recognised, or thought he recognised, the bell.  It was that of an old French clock he had bought, and had never had put  in order. He had never been able to make it go, but once touching it  inadvertently he had aroused in it a breath of life so that it had  struck one,--this same sweet piercing note. Who, he wondered, was  touching it now?    Geoffrey was one of those who act best and naturally without delay. Now  he hesitated not at all. He had the keys of the house in his pocket, and  he moved quickly toward a side door which he remembered swung silently  on its hinges. It was not so much that he believed that there was any  one in the house--perhaps to the most apprehensive a burglar comes as a  surprise--but he felt he had too good grounds for suspicion to fail to  investigate.    He unlocked the door without a sound. As he stepped within, doubt was  put an end to by the patch of white light that, streaming out of the  library door, fell across the passageway before him. He stooped down and  took off his boots, and then cautiously approached the open door and  looked in, knowing that darkness and preparation were in his favour.    His caution was unnecessary, for his entrance had not been heard. The  Hillsborough theory of the femininity of the burglar instantly fell to  the ground. A man of medium size was standing before one of the  bookcases with his elbow resting near the clock; he was holding a volume  in his hands with the careful ease of a book fancier. The man's back was  turned so that a sandy head and a strongly built figure were all  Geoffrey could make out. Had it not been for a glimpse of a mask on his  face, he might have been a student at work.    So intent did he appear that Geoffrey could not resist the temptation to  make his entrance dramatic. Creeping almost to the other's elbow,  revolver in hand, he said gently:    \"Fond of reading?\"    The man, naturally startled, made a surprisingly quick movement toward  his own revolver, and had it knocked out of his hand with a benumbing  blow. Geoffrey secured the weapon, and seeing the man's retreat, may be  excused for supposing "]]]
