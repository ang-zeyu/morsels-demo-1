White men lynch the offending Afro-American, not because he is a  despoiler of virtue, but because he succumbs to the smiles of white women.          2    _The_ BLACK _and_ WHITE _of_ IT      The _Cleveland Gazette_ of January 16, 1892, publishes a case in point.  Mrs. J.S. Underwood, the wife of a minister of Elyria, Ohio, accused an  Afro-American of rape. She told her husband that during his absence in  1888, stumping the State for the Prohibition Party, the man came to the  kitchen door, forced his way in the house and insulted her. She tried to  drive him out with a heavy poker, but he overpowered and chloroformed her,  and when she revived her clothing was torn and she was in a horrible  condition. She did not know the man but could identify him. She pointed  out William Offett, a married man, who was arrested and, being in Ohio,  was granted a trial.    The prisoner vehemently denied the charge of rape, but confessed he went  to Mrs. Underwood's residence at her invitation and was criminally  intimate with her at her request. This availed him nothing against the  sworn testimony of a ministers wife, a lady of the highest respectability.  He was found guilty, and entered the penitentiary, December 14, 1888, for  fifteen years. Some time afterwards the woman's remorse led her to confess  to her husband that the man was innocent.    These are her words:      I met Offett at the Post Office. It was raining. He was polite to me,    and as I had several bundles in my arms he offered to carry them home    for me, which he did. He had a strange fascination for me, and I invited    him to call on me. He called, bringing chestnuts and candy for the    children. By this means we got them to leave us alone in the room. Then    I sat on his lap. He made a proposal to me and I readily consented. Why    I did so, I do not know, but that I did is true. He visited me several    times after that and each time I was indiscreet. I did not care after    the first time. In fact I could not have resisted, and had no desire to    resist.    When asked by her husband why she told him she had been outraged, she  said: \"I had several reasons for telling you. One was the neighbors saw  the fellows here, another was, I was afraid I had contracted a loathsome  disease, and still another was that I feared I might give birth to a Negro  baby. I hoped to save my reputation by telling you a deliberate lie.\" Her  husband horrified by the confession had Offett, who had already served  four years, released and secured a divorce.    There are thousands of such cases throughout the South, with the  difference that the Southern white men in insatiate fury wreak their  vengeance without intervention of law upon the Afro-Americans who consort  with their women. A few instances to substantiate the assertion that some  white women love the company of the Afro-American will not be out of  place. Most of these cases were reported by the daily papers of the South.    In the winter of 1885-86 the wife of a practicing physician in Memphis, in  good social standing whose name has escaped me, left home, husband and  children, and ran away with her black coachman. She was with him a month  before her husband found and brought her home. The coachman could not be  found. The doctor moved his family away from Memphis, and is living in  another city under an assumed name.    In the same city last year a white girl in the dusk of evening screamed at  the approach of some parties that a Negro had assaulted her on the street.  He was captured, tried by a white judge and jury, that acquitted him of  the charge. It is needless to add if there had been a scrap of evidence on  which to convict him of so grave a charge he would have been convicted.    Sarah Clark of Memphis loved a black man and lived openly with him. When  she was indicted last spring for miscegenation, she swore in court that  she was _not_ a white woman. This she did to escape the penitentiary and  continued her illicit relation undisturbed. That she is of the lower class  of whites, does not disturb the fact that she is a white woman. \"The  leading citizens\" of Memphis are defending the \"honor\" of _all_ white  women, _demi-monde_ included.    Since the manager of the _Free Speech_ has been run away from Memphis by  the guardians of the honor of Southern white women, a young girl living on  Poplar St., who was discovered in intimate relations with a handsome  mulatto young colored man, Will Morgan by name, stole her father's money  to send the young fellow away from that father's wrath. She has since  joined him in Chicago.    The _Memphis Ledger_ for June 8 has the following:      If Lillie Bailey, a rather pretty white girl seventeen years of age, who    is now at the City Hospital, would be somewhat less reserved about her    disgrace there would be some very nauseating details in the story of her    life. She is the mother of a little coon. The truth might reveal fearful    depravity or it might reveal the evidence of a rank outrage. She will    not divulge the name of the man who has left such black evidence of her    disgrace, and, in fact, says it is a matter in which there can be no    interest to the outside world. She came to Memphis nearly three months    ago and was taken in at the Woman's Refuge in the southern part of the    city. She remained there until a few weeks ago, when the child was born.    The ladies in charge of the Refuge were horified. The girl was at once    sent to the City Hospital, where she has been since May 30. She is a    country girl. She came to Memphis from her fathers farm, a short    distance from Hernando, Miss. Just when she left there she would not    say. In fact she says she came to Memphis from Arkansas, and says her    home is in that State. She is rather good looking, has blue eyes, a low    forehead and dark red hair. The ladies at the Woman's Refuge do not know    anything about the girl further than what they learned when she was an    inmate of the institution; and she would not tell much. When the child    was born an attempt was made to get the girl to reveal the name of the    Negro who had disgraced her, she obstinately refused and it was    impossible to elicit any information from her on the subject.    Note the wording. \"The truth might reveal fearful depravity or rank  outrage.\" If it had been a white child or Lillie Bailey had told a pitiful  story of Negro outrage, it would have been a case of woman's weakness or  assault and she could have remained at the Woman's Refuge. But a Negro  child and to withhold its father's name and thus prevent the killing of  another Negro \"rapist.\" A case of \"fearful depravity.\"    The very week the \"leading citizens\" of Memphis were making a spectacle of  themselves in defense of all white women of every kind, an Afro-American,  M. Stricklin, was found in a white woman's room in that city. Although  she made no outcry of rape, he was jailed and would have been lynched, but  the woman stated she bought curtains of him (he was a furniture dealer)  and his business in her room that night was to put them up. A white  woman's word was taken as absolutely in this case as when the cry of rape  is made, and he was freed.    What is true of Memphis is true of the entire South. The daily papers last  year reported a farmer's wife in Alabama had given birth to a Negro child.  When the Negro farm hand who was plowing in the field heard it he took the  mule from the plow and fled. The dispatches also told of a woman in South  Carolina who gave birth to a Negro child and charged three men with being  its father, _every one of whom has since disappeared_. In Tuscumbia, Ala.,  the colored boy who was lynched there last year for assaulting a white  girl told her before his accusers that he had met her there in the woods  often before.    Frank Weems of Chattanooga who was not lynched in May only because the  prominent citizens became his body guard until the doors of the  penitentiary closed on him, had letters in his pocket from the white woman  in the case, making the appointment with him. Edward Coy who was burned  alive in Texarkana, January 1, 1892, died protesting his innocence.  Investigation since as given by the Bystander in the _Chicago Inter  Ocean_, October 1, proves:      1. The woman who was paraded as a victim of violence was of bad    character; her husband was a drunkard and a gambler.      2. She was publicly reported and generally known to have been criminally    intimate with Coy for more than a year previous.      3. She was compelled by threats, if not by violence, to make the charge    against the victim.      4. When she came to apply the match Coy asked her if she would burn him    after they had \"been sweethearting\" so long.      5. A large majority of the \"superior\" white men prominent in the affair    are the reputed fathers of mulatto children.      These are not pleasant facts, but they are illustrative of the vital    phase of the so-called race question, which should properly be    designated an earnest inquiry as to the best methods by which religion,    science, law and political power may be employed to excuse injustice,    barbarity and crime done to a people because of race and color. There    can be no possible belief that these people were inspired by any    consuming zeal to vindicate God's law against miscegnationists of the    most practical sort. The woman was a willing partner in the victim's    guilt, and being of the \"superior\" race must naturally have been more    guilty.    In Natchez, Miss., Mrs. Marshall, one of the _creme de la creme_ of the  city, created a tremendous sensation several years ago. She has a black  coachman who was married, and had been in her employ several years.

The sergeant    sent for an ambulance, and Mora was taken to the hospital, the wound in    the hip being serious.      A search was made for Robinson, but he could not be found, and even at 2    o'clock this morning Captain Day, with Sergeant Aucoin and Corporals    Perrier and Trenchard, with a good squad of men, were beating the weeds    for the black.    The _New Orleans Picayune_ of the same date described the occurrence, and  from its account one would think it was an entirely different affair. Both  of the two accounts cannot be true, and the unquestioned fact is that  neither of them sets out the facts as they occurred. Both accounts attempt  to fix the beginning of hostilities upon the colored men, but both were  compelled to admit that the colored men were sitting on the doorsteps  quietly conversing with one another when the three policemen went up and  accosted them. The _Times-Democrat_ unguardedly states that one of the two  colored men tried to run away; that Mora seized him and then drew his  billy and struck him on the head; that Charles broke away from him and  started to run, after which the shooting began. The _Picayune_, however,  declares that Pierce began the firing and that his two shots point blank  at Aucoin were the first shots of the fight. As a matter of fact, Pierce  never fired a single shot before he was covered by Aucoin's revolver.  Charles and the officers did all the shooting. The _Picayune_'s account is  as follows:      Patrolman Mora was shot in the right hip and dangerously wounded last    night at 11:30 o'clock in Dryades Street, between Washington and Sixth,    by two Negroes, who were sitting on a door step in the neighborhood.      The shooting of Patrolman Mora brings to memory the fact that he was one    of the partners of Patrolman Trimp, who was shot by a Negro soldier of    the United States government during the progress of the Spanish-American    war. The shooting of Mora by the Negro last night is a very simple    story. At the hour mentioned, three Negro women noticed two suspicious    men sitting on a door step in the above locality. The women saw the two    men making an apparent inspection of the building. As they told the    story, they saw the men look over the fence and examine the window    blinds, and they paid particular attention to the make-up of the    building, which was a two-story affair. About that time Sergeant J.C.    Aucoin and Officers Mora and J.D. Cantrell hove in sight. The women    hailed them and described to them the suspicious actions of the two    Negroes, who were still sitting on the step. The trio of bluecoats, on    hearing the facts, at once crossed the street and accosted the men. The    latter answered that they were waiting for a friend whom they were    expecting. Not satisfied with this answer, the sergeant asked them where    they lived, and they replied \"down town,\" but could not designate the    locality. To other questions put by the officers the larger of the two    Negroes replied that they had been in town just three days.      As this reply was made, the larger man sprang to his feet, and Patrolman    Mora, seeing that he was about to run away, seized him. The Negro took a    firm hold on the officer, and a scuffle ensued. Mora, noting that he was    not being assisted by his brother officers, drew his billy and struck    the Negro on the head. The blow had but little effect upon the man, for    he broke away and started down the street. When about ten feet away, the    Negro drew his revolver and opened fire on the officer, firing three or    four shots. The third shot struck Mora in the right hip, and was    subsequently found to have taken an upward course. Although badly    wounded, Mora drew his pistol and returned the fire. At his third shot    the Negro was noticed to stagger, but he did not fall. He continued his    flight. At this moment Sergeant Aucoin seized the other Negro, who    proved to be a youth, Leon Pierce. As soon as Officer Mora was shot he    sank to the sidewalk, and the other officer ran to the nearest    telephone, and sent in a call for the ambulance. Upon its arrival the    wounded officer was placed in it and conveyed to the hospital. An    examination by the house surgeon revealed the fact that the bullet had    taken an upward course. In the opinion of the surgeon the wound was a    dangerous one.    But the best proof of the fact that the officers accosted the two colored  men and without any warrant or other justification attempted to arrest  them, and did actually seize and begin to club one of them, is shown by  Officer Mora's own statement. The officer was wounded and had every reason  in the world to make his side of the story as good as possible. His  statement was made to a _Picayune_ reporter and the same was published on  the twenty-fifth inst., and is as follows:      I was in the neighborhood of Dryades and Washington Streets, with    Sergeant Aucoin and Officer Cantrell, when three Negro women came up and    told us that there were two suspicious-looking Negroes sitting on a step    on Dryades Street, between Washington and Sixth. We went to the place    indicated and found two Negroes. We interrogated them as to who they    were, what they were doing and how long they had been here. They replied    that they were working for some one and had been in town three days. At    about this stage the larger of the two Negroes got up and I grabbed him.    The Negro pulled, but I held fast, and he finally pulled me into the    street. Here I began using my billet, and the Negro jerked from my grasp    and ran. He then pulled a gun and fired. I pulled my gun and returned    the fire, each of us firing about three shots. I saw the Negro stumble    several times, and I thought I had shot him, but he ran away and I don't    know whether any of my shots took effect. Sergeant Aucoin in the    meantime held the other man fast. The man was about ten feet from me    when he fired, and the three Negresses who told us about the men stood    away about twenty-five feet from the shooting.    Thus far in the proceeding the Monday night episode results in Officer  Mora lying in the station wounded in the hip; Leonard Pierce, one of the  colored men, locked up in the station, and Robert Charles, the other  colored man, a fugitive, wounded in the leg and sought for by the entire  police force of New Orleans. Not sought for, however, to be placed under  arrest and given a fair trial and punished if found guilty according to  the law of the land, but sought for by a host of enraged, vindictive and  fearless officers, who were coolly ordered to kill him on sight. This  order is shown by the _Picayune_ of the twenty-sixth inst., in which the  following statement appears:      In talking to the sergeant about the case, the captain asked about the    Negro's fighting ability, and the sergeant answered that Charles, though    he called him Robinson then, was a desperate man, and it would be best    to shoot him before he was given a chance to draw his pistol upon any of    the officers.    This instruction was given before anybody had been killed, and the only  evidence that Charles was a desperate man lay in the fact that he had  refused to be beaten over the head by Officer Mora for sitting on a step  quietly conversing with a friend. Charles resisted an absolutely unlawful  attack, and a gun fight followed. Both Mora and Charles were shot, but  because Mora was white and Charles was black, Charles was at once declared  to be a desperado, made an outlaw, and subsequently a price put upon his  head and the mob authorized to shoot him like a dog, on sight.    The New Orleans _Picayune_ of Wednesday morning said:      But he has gone, perhaps to the swamps, and the disappointment of the    bluecoats in not getting the murderer is expressed in their curses, each    man swearing that the signal to halt that will be offered Charles will    be a shot.    In that same column of the _Picayune_ it was said:      Hundreds of policemen were about; each corner was guarded by a squad,    commanded either by a sergeant or a corporal, and every man had the word    to shoot the Negro as soon as he was sighted. He was a desperate black    and would be given no chance to take more life.    Legal sanction was given to the mob or any man of the mob to kill Charles  at sight by the Mayor of New Orleans, who publicly proclaimed a reward of  two hundred and fifty dollars, not for the arrest of Charles, not at all,  but the reward was offered for Charles's body, \"dead or alive.\" The  advertisement was as follows:      +$250 REWARD+      Under the authority vested in me by law, I hereby offer, in the name of    the city of New Orleans, $250 reward for the capture and delivery, dead    or alive, to the authorities of the city, the body of the Negro    murderer,      +ROBERT CHARLES+,      who, on Tuesday morning, July 24, shot and killed      Police Captain John T. Day and Patrolman Peter J. Lamb, and wounded      Patrolman August T. Mora.      PAUL CAPDEVIELLE, Mayor    This authority, given by the sergeant to kill Charles on sight, would have  been no news to Charles, nor to any colored man in New Orleans, who, for  any purpose whatever, even to save his life, raised his hand against a  white man. It is now, even as it was in the days of slavery, an  unpardonable sin for a Negro to resist a white man, no matter how unjust  or unprovoked the white man's attack may be. Charles knew this, and  knowing to be captured meant to be killed, he resolved to sell his life as  dearly as possible.    The next step in the terrible tragedy occurred between 2:30 and 5 o'clock  Tuesday morning, about four hours after the affair on Dryades Street. The  man hunt, which had been inaugurated soon after Officer Mora had been  carried to the station, succeeded in running down Robert Charles, the  wounded fugitive, and located him at 2023"]]]
