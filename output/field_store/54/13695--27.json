He turned to an  angel near him.    \"Who was it,\" said he, \"to whom you were sent with counsel long ago?  Was it not Balaam the son of Beor, as he was riding to meet the  King of Moab? And did not even the dumb beast profit more by your  instruction than the man who rode him? And who was it,\" he continued,  turning to Uriel, \"that was called the wisest of all men, having  searched out and understood the many inventions that are found under  the sun? Was not Solomon, prince of fools and philosophers, unable  by much learning to escape weariness of the flesh and despair of  the spirit? Knowledge also is vanity and vexation. This I know well,  because I have dwelt among men and held converse with them since the  day when I was sent to instruct the first man in Eden.\"    Then I looked more closely at him who was speaking and recognised  the beauty of the archangel Raphael, as it was pictured long ago:      \"A seraph winged; six wings he wore to shade    His lineaments divine; the pair that clad    Each shoulder broad came mantling o'er his breast,    With regal ornament; the middle pair    Girt like a starry zone his waist, and round    Skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold    And colours dipped in Heav'n; the third his feet    Shadowed from either heel with feathered mail,    Sky-tinctured grain. Like Maia's son he stood    And shook his plumes, that Heavenly fragrance filled    The circuit wide.\"    \"Too well I know,\" he spoke on, while the smile on his face deepened  into a look of pity and tenderness and desire, \"too well I know that  power corrupts itself and that knowledge cannot save. There is no cure  for the evil that is in the world but by the giving of more love to  men. The laws that are ordained for earth are strange and unequal,  and the ways where men must walk are full of pitfalls and dangers.  Pestilence creeps along the ground and flows in the rivers; whirlwind  and tempest shake the habitations of men and drive their ships to  destruction; fire breaks forth from the mountains and the foundations  of the world tremble. Frail is the flesh of man, and many are his  pains and troubles. His children can never find peace until they learn  to love one another and to help one another.    \"Wickedness is begotten by disease and misery. Violence comes from  poverty and hunger. The cruelty of oppression is when the strong tread  the weak under their feet; the bitterness of pride is when the wise  and learned despise the simple; the crown of folly is when the rich  think they are gods, and the poor think that God is not.    \"Hatred and envy and contempt are the curse of life. And for these  there is no remedy save love--the will to give and to bless--the will  of the King himself, who gives to all and is loving unto every man.  But how shall the hearts of men be won to this will? How shall it  enter into them and possess them? Even the gods that men fashion for  themselves are cruel and proud and false and unjust. How shall the  miracle be wrought in human nature to reveal the meaning of humanity?  How shall men be made like God?\"    At this question a deep hush fell around the circle, and every  listener was still, even as the rustling leaves hang motionless when  the light breeze falls away in the hour of sunset. Then through the  silence, like the song of a far-away thrush from its hermitage in the  forest, a voice came ringing: \"I know it, I know it, I know it.\"    Clear and sweet--clear as a ray of light, sweeter than the smallest  silver bell that rang the hour of rest--was that slender voice  floating on the odorous and translucent air. Nearer and nearer it  came, echoing down the valley, \"I know it, I know it, I know it!\"    Then from between the rounded hills, among which the brook of  Brighthopes is born, appeared a young angel, a little child, with  flying hair of gold, and green wreaths twined about his shoulders, and  fluttering hands that played upon the air and seemed to lift him so  lightly that he had no need of wings. As thistle-down, blown by the  wind, dances across the water, so he came along the little stream,  singing clear above the murmur of the brook.    All the angels rose and turned to look at him with wondering eyes.  Multitudes of others came flying swiftly to the place from which the  strange, new song was sounding. Rank within rank, like a garden of  living flowers, they stood along the sloping banks of the brook while  the child-angel floated into the midst of them, singing:    \"I know it, I know it, I know it! Man shall be made like God because  the Son of God shall become a man.\"    At this all the angels looked at one another with amazement, and  gathered more closely about the child-angel, as those who hear  wonderful news.    \"How can this be?\" they asked. \"How is it possible that the Son of God  should be a man?\"    \"I do not know,\" said the young angel. \"I only know that it is to be.\"    \"But if he becomes a man,\" said Raphael, \"he will be at the mercy  of men; the cruel and the wicked will have power upon him; he will  suffer.\"    \"I know it,\" answered the young angel, \"and by suffering he will  understand the meaning of all sorrow and pain; and he will be able to  comfort every one who cries; and his own tears will be for the healing  of sad hearts; and those who are healed by him will learn for his sake  to be kind to each other.\"    \"But if the Son of God is a true man,\" said Uriel, \"he must first be  a child, simple, and lowly, and helpless. It may be that he will never  gain the learning of the schools. The masters of earthly wisdom will  despise him and speak scorn of him.\"    \"I know it,\" said the young angel, \"but in meekness will he answer  them; and to those who become as little children he will give the  heavenly wisdom that comes, without seeking, to the pure and gentle  of heart.\"    \"But if he becomes a man,\" said Michael, \"evil men will hate and  persecute him: they may even take his life, if they are stronger than  he.\"    \"I know it,\" answered the young angel, \"they will nail him to a cross.  But when he is lifted up, he will draw all men unto him, for he will  still be the Son of God, and no heart that is open to love can help  loving him, since his love for men is so great that he is willing to  die for them.\"    \"But how do you know these things?\" cried the other angels. \"Who are  you?\"    \"I am the Christmas angel,\" he said. \"At first I was sent as the dream  of a little child, a holy child, blessed and wonderful, to dwell in  the heart of a pure virgin, Mary of Nazareth. There I was hidden till  the word came to call me back to the throne of the King, and tell  me my name, and give me my new message. For this is Christmas day on  Earth, and to-day the Son of God is born of a woman. So I must fly  quickly, before the sun rises, to bring the good news to those happy  men who have been chosen to receive them.\"    As he said this, the young angel rose, with arms outspread, from the  green meadow of Peacefield and, passing over the bounds of Heaven,  dropped swiftly as a shooting-star toward the night shadow of the  Earth. The other angels followed him--a throng of dazzling forms,  beautiful as a rain of jewels falling from the dark-blue sky. But  the child-angel went more swiftly than the others, because of the  certainty of gladness in his heart.    And as the others followed him they wondered who had been favoured  and chosen to receive the glad tidings.    \"It must be the Emperor of the World and his counsellors,\" they  thought. But the flight passed over Rome.    \"It may be the philosophers and the masters of learning,\" they  thought. But the flight passed over Athens.    \"Can it be the High Priest of the Jews, and the elders and the  scribes?\" they thought. But the flight passed over Jerusalem.    It floated out over the hill country of Bethlehem; the throng of  silent angels holding close together, as if perplexed and doubtful;  the child-angel darting on far in advance, as one who knew the way  through the darkness.    The villages were all still: the very houses seemed asleep; but in one  place there was a low sound of talking in a stable, near to an inn--a  sound as of a mother soothing her baby to rest.    All over the pastures on the hillsides a light film of snow had  fallen, delicate as the veil of a bride adorned for the marriage; and  as the child-angel passed over them, alone in the swiftness of his  flight, the pure fields sparkled round him, giving back his radiance.    And there were in that country shepherds abiding in the fields,  keeping watch over their flocks by night. And lo! the angel of the  Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them,  and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them: \"Fear not;  for behold I bring you glad tidings of great joy which shall be to  all nations. For unto you is born this day, in the city of David,  a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto  you; ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in  a manger.\"    And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly  host, praising God and saying: \"Glory to God in the highest, and on  earth peace, good-will toward men.\" And the shepherds said one to  another: \"Let us now go, even to Bethlehem, and see this thing which  is come to pass.\"    So I said within myself that I also would go with the shepherds, even  to Bethlehem. And I heard a great and sweet voice, as of a bell, which  said, \"Come!\" And when the bell had sounded twelve times, I awoke; and  it was Christmas morn; and I knew that I had been in a dream.    Yet it seemed to me that the things which I had heard were true.           *       *       *       *       *          A LITTLE ESSAY          CHRISTMAS-GIVING AND CHRISTMAS-LIVING    I      The custom of exchanging presents on a certain day in the year is very  much older than"]]]
