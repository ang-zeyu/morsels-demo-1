So it was with Old Mr.  Toad. He kept right on, hop, hop, hipperty-hop, while the others were  playing, and so it happened that when at last Peter and Jimmy and Unc'  Billy reached the Smiling Pool, they hadn't caught another glimpse of Old  Mr. Toad.    \"Do you suppose he hid somewhere, and we passed him?\" asked Peter.    Unc' Billy shook his head. \"Ah don' reckon so,\" said he. \"We-uns done been  foolin' away our time, an' Brer Toad done stole a march on us. Ah reckons  we-uns will find him sittin' on the bank here somewhere.\"    So right away the three separated to look for Old Mr. Toad. All along the  bank of the Smiling Pool they looked. They peeped under old leaves and  sticks. They looked in every place where Old Mr. Toad might have hidden,  but not a trace of him did they find.      \"Tra-la-la-lee! Oka-chee! Oka-chee!    Happy am I as I can be!\"    sang Mr. Redwing, as he swayed to and fro among the bulrushes.    \"Say, Mr. Redwing, have you seen Old Mr. Toad?\" called Peter Rabbit.    \"No,\" replied Mr. Redwing. \"Is that whom you fellows are looking for? I  wondered if you had lost something. What do you want with Old Mr. Toad?\"    Peter explained how they had followed Old Mr. Toad just to see what he  really was up to. \"Of course we know that he hasn't any more voice than I  have,\" declared Peter, \"but we are curious to know if he really thinks he  has, and why he should be in such a hurry to reach the Smiling Pool. It  looks to us as if the spring has made Old Mr. Toad crazy.\"    \"Oh, that's it, is it?\" replied Mr. Redwing, his bright eyes twinkling.  \"Some people don't know as much as they might. I've been wondering where  Old Mr. Toad was, and I'm ever so glad to learn that he hasn't forgotten  that he has a very important part in our beautiful spring chorus.\" Then  once more Mr. Redwing began to sing.          IV      PETER RABBIT FINDS OLD MR. TOAD    It isn't often that Peter Rabbit is truly envious, but sometimes in the  joyousness of spring he is. He envies the birds because they can pour out  in beautiful song the joy that is in them. The only way he can express his  feelings is by kicking his long heels, jumping about, and such foolish  things. While that gives Peter a great deal of satisfaction, it doesn't add  to the joy of other people as do the songs of the birds, and you know to  give joy to others is to add to your own joy. So there are times when Peter  wishes he could sing.    He was wishing this very thing now, as he sat on the bank of the Smiling  Pool, listening to the great spring chorus.      \"Tra-la-la-lee! Oka-chee! Oka-chee!    There's joy in the spring for you and for me.\"    sang Redwing the Blackbird from the bulrushes.    From over in the Green Meadows rose the clear lilt of Carol the Meadow  Lark, and among the alders just where the Laughing Brook ran into the  Smiling Pool a flood of happiness was pouring from the throat of Little  Friend the Song Sparrow. Winsome Bluebird's sweet, almost plaintive,  whistle seemed to fairly float in the air, so that it was hard to say just  where it did come from, and in the top of the Big Hickory-tree, Welcome  Robin was singing as if his heart were bursting with joy. Even Sammy Jay  was adding a beautiful, bell-like note instead of his usual harsh scream.  As for the Smiling Pool, it seemed as if the very water itself sang, for a  mighty chorus of clear piping voices from unseen singers rose from all  around its banks. Peter knew who those singers were, although look as he  would he could see none of them. They were hylas, the tiny cousins of  Stickytoes the Tree Toad.    Listening to all these joyous voices, Peter forgot for a time what had  brought him to the Smiling Pool. But Jimmy Skunk and Unc' Billy Possum  didn't forget. They were still hunting for Old Mr. Toad.    \"Well, old Mr. Dreamer, have you found him yet?\" asked Jimmy Skunk,  stealing up behind Peter and poking him in the back.    Peter came to himself with a start. \"No,\" said he. \"I was just listening  and wishing that I could sing, too. Don't you ever wish you could sing,  Jimmy?\"    \"No,\" replied Jimmy. \"I never waste time wishing I could do things it was  never meant I should do. It's funny where Old Mr. Toad is. He said that he  was coming down here to sing, and Redwing the Blackbird seemed to be  expecting him. I've looked everywhere I can think of without finding him,  but I don't believe in giving up without another try. Stop your dreaming  and come help us hunt.\"    So Peter stopped his dreaming and joined in the search. Now there was one  place where neither Peter nor Jimmy nor Unc' Billy had thought of looking.  That was in the Smiling Pool itself. They just took it for granted that Old  Mr. Toad was somewhere on the bank. Presently Peter came to a place where  the bank was very low and the water was shallow for quite a little distance  out in the Smiling Pool. From out of that shallow water came the piping  voice of a hyla, and Peter stopped to stare, trying to see the tiny singer.    Suddenly he jumped right up in the air with surprise. There was a  familiar-looking head sticking out of the water. Peter had found Old Mr.  Toad!          V      OLD MR. TOAD'S MUSIC BAG      Never think that you have learned      All there is to know.    That's the surest way of all      Ignorance to show.    \"I've found Old Mr. Toad!\" cried Peter Rabbit, hurrying after Jimmy Skunk.    \"Where?\" demanded Jimmy.    \"In the water,\" declared Peter. \"He's sitting right over there where the  water is shallow, and he didn't notice me at all. Let's get Unc' Billy, and  then creep over to the edge of the Smiling Pool and watch to see if Old Mr.  Toad really does try to sing.\"    So they hunted up Unc' Billy Possum, and the three stole very softly over  to the edge of the Smiling Pool, where the bank was low and the water  shallow. Sure enough, there sat Old Mr. Toad with just his head out of  water. And while they were watching him, something very strange happened.    \"What--what's the matter with him?\" whispered Peter, his big eyes looking  as if they might pop out of his head.    \"If he don't watch out, he'll blow up and bust!\" exclaimed Jimmy.    [Illustration: \"If he don't watch out, he'll blow up and bust!\" exclaimed  Jimmy.]    \"Listen!\" whispered Unc' Billy Possum. \"Do mah ol' ears hear right? 'Pears  to me that that song is coming right from where Brer Toad is sitting.\"    It certainly did appear so, and of all the songs that glad spring day there  was none sweeter. Indeed there were few as sweet. The only trouble was the  song was so very short. It lasted only for two or three seconds. And when  it ended, Old Mr. Toad looked quite his natural self again; just as  commonplace, almost ugly, as ever. Peter looked at Jimmy Skunk, Jimmy  looked at Unc' Billy Possum, and Unc' Billy looked at Peter. And no one had  a word to say. Then all three looked back at Old Mr. Toad.    And even as they looked, his throat began to swell and swell and swell,  until it was no wonder that Jimmy Skunk had thought that he was in danger  of blowing up. And then, when it stopped swelling, there came again those  beautiful little notes, so sweet and tremulous that Peter actually held his  breath to listen. There was no doubt that Old Mr. Toad was singing just as  he had said he was going to, and it was just as true that his song was one  of the sweetest if not _the_ sweetest of all the chorus from and around the  Smiling Pool. It was very hard to believe, but Peter and Jimmy and Unc'  Billy both saw and heard, and that was enough. Their respect for Old Mr.  Toad grew tremendously as they listened.    \"How does he do it?\" whispered Peter.    \"With that bag under his chin, of course,\" replied Jimmy Skunk. \"Don't you  see it's only when that is swelled out that he sings? It's a regular music  bag. And I didn't know he had any such bag there at all.\"    \"I wish,\" said Peter Rabbit, feeling of his throat, \"that I had a music bag  like that in my throat.\"    And then he joined in the laugh of Jimmy and Unc' Billy, but still with  something of a look of wistfulness in his eyes.          VI      PETER DISCOVERS SOMETHING MORE      There are stranger things in the world to-day      Than ever you dreamed could be.    There's beauty in some of the commonest things      If only you've eyes to see.    Ever since Peter Rabbit was a little chap and had first ran away from home,  he had known Old Mr. Toad, and never once had Peter suspected that he could  sing. Also he had thought Old Mr. Toad almost ugly-looking, and he knew  that most of his neighbors thought the same way. They were fond of Old Mr.  Toad, for he was always good-natured and attended strictly to his own  affairs; but they liked to poke fun at him, and as for there being anything  beautiful about him, such a thing never entered their heads.    Now that they had discovered that he really has a very beautiful voice,  they began to look on him with a great deal more respect. This was  especially so with Peter. He got in the habit of going over to the Smiling  Pool every day, when the way was clear, just to sit on the bank and listen  to Old Mr. Toad.    \"Why didn't you ever tell us before that you could sing?\" he asked one day,  as Old Mr. Toad looked up at him from the Smiling Pool.    \"What was the use of wasting my breath?\" demanded Old Mr. Toad. \"You  wouldn't have believed me if I had. You didn't believe me when I did tell  you.\"    Peter knew that this was true, and he couldn't find any answer ready. At  last he ventured another question. \"Why haven't I ever heard you sing  before?\"    \"You have,\" replied Old Mr. Toad tartly. \"I sang right in this very place  last spring, and the spring before, and the spring before that. You've sat  on that very bank lots of times while I was singing. The trouble with you,  Peter, is that you don't"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12648"],[0,"The Beautiful Necessity (#2)"],[1,"and width.    In another sense music and architecture are allied. They alone of  all the arts are purely creative, since in them is presented, not  a likeness of some known idea, but _a thing-in-itself_ brought to  a distinct and complete expression of its nature. Neither a musical  composition nor a work of architecture depends for its effectiveness  upon resemblances to natural sounds in the one case, or to natural  forms in the other. Of none of the other arts is this to such a degree  true: they are not so much creative as re-creative, for in them all  the artist takes his subject ready made from nature and presents it  anew according to the dictates of his genius.    The characteristic differences between music and architecture are the  same as those which subsist between time and space. Now time and space  are such abstract ideas that they can be dealt with best through  their corresponding correlatives in the natural world, for it is a  fundamental theosophic tenet that nature everywhere abounds in such  correspondences; that nature, in its myriad forms, is indeed the  concrete presentment of abstract unities. The energy which everywhere  animates form is a type of time within space; the mind working in  and through the body is another expression of the same thing.  Correspondingly, music is dynamic, subjective, mental, of one  dimension; while architecture is static, objective, physical, of three  dimensions; sustaining the same relation to music and the other  arts as does the human body to the various organs which compose, and  consciousnesses which animate it (it being the reservatory of these  organs and the vehicle of these consciousnesses); and a work of  architecture in like manner may and sometimes does include all of the  other arts within itself. Sculpture accentuates and enriches, painting  adorns, works of literature are stored within it, poetry and the drama  awake its echoes, while music thrills to its uttermost recesses, like  the very spirit of life tingling through the body's fibres.    Such being the relation between them, the difference in the nature of  the ideas bodied forth in music and in architecture becomes apparent.  Music is interior, abstract, subjective, speaking directly to the soul  in a simple and universal language whose meaning is made personal and  particular in the breast of each listener: \"Music alone of all the  arts,\" says Balzac, \"has power to make us live within ourselves.\"  A work of architecture is the exact opposite of this: existing  principally and primarily for the uses of the body, it is like the  body a concrete organism, attaining to esthetic expression only in  the reconciliation and fulfilment of many conflicting practical  requirements. Music is pure beauty, the voice of the unfettered  and perpetually vanishing soul of things; architecture is that soul  imprisoned in a form, become subject to the law of causality, beaten  upon by the elements, at war with gravity, the slave of man. One is  the Ariel of the arts; the other, Caliban.    Coming now to the consideration of architecture in its historical  rather than its philosophical aspect, it will be shown how certain  theosophical concepts are applicable here. Of these none is more  familiar and none more fundamental than the idea of reincarnation. By  reincarnation more than mere physical re-birth is meant, for physical  re-birth is but a single manifestation of that universal law of  alternation of state, of animation of vehicles, and progression  through related planes, in accordance with which all things move,  and as it were make music--each cycle complete, yet part of a larger  cycle, the incarnate monad passing through correlated changes,  carrying along and bringing into manifestation in each successive arc  of the spiral the experience accumulated in all preceding states,  and at the same time unfolding that power of the Self peculiar to the  plane in which it is momentarily manifesting.    This law finds exemplification in the history of architecture in the  orderly flow of the building impulse from one nation and one country  to a different nation and a different country: its new vehicle of  manifestation; also in the continuity and increasing complexity of  the development of that impulse in manifestation; each \"incarnation\"  summarizing all those which have gone before, and adding some new  factor peculiar to itself alone; each being a growth, a life, with  periods corresponding to childhood, youth, maturity and decadence;  each also typifying in its entirety some single one of these  life-periods, and revealing some special aspect or power of the Self.    For the sake of clearness and brevity the consideration of only one  of several architectural evolutions will be attempted: that which,  arising in the north of Africa, spread to southern Europe, thence to  the northwest of Europe and to England--the architecture, in short, of  the so-called civilized world.    This architecture, anterior to the Christian era, may be broadly  divided into three great periods, during which it was successively  practiced by three peoples: the Egyptians, the Greeks and the Romans.  Then intervened the Dark Ages, and a new art arose, the Gothic, which  was a flowering out in stone of the spirit of Christianity. This was  in turn succeeded by the Renaissance, the impulse of which remains  to-day unexhausted. In each of these architectures the peculiar genius  of a people and of a period attained to a beautiful, complete and  coherent utterance, and notwithstanding the considerable intervals  of time which sometimes separated them they succeeded one another  logically and inevitably, and each was related to the one which  preceded and which followed it in a particular and intimate manner.    The power and wisdom of ancient Egypt was vested in its priesthood,  which was composed of individuals exceptionally qualified by birth  and training for their high office, tried by the severest ordeals  and bound by the most solemn oaths. The priests were honored and  privileged above all other men, and spent their lives dwelling  apart from the multitude in vast and magnificent temples, dedicating  themselves to the study and practice of religion, philosophy, science  and art--subjects then intimately related, not widely separated as  they are now. These men were the architects of ancient Egypt: theirs  the minds which directed the hands that built those time-defying  monuments.    The rites that the priests practiced centered about what are known  as the Lesser and the Greater Mysteries. These consisted of  representations by means of symbol and allegory, under conditions  and amid surroundings the most awe-inspiring, of those great truths  concerning man's nature, origin and destiny of which the priests--in  reality a brotherhood of initiates and their pupils--were the  custodians. These ceremonies were made the occasion for the initiation  of neophytes into the order, and the advancement of the already  initiated into its successive degrees. For the practice of such rites,  and others designed to impress not the elect but the multitude, the  great temples of Egypt were constructed. Everything about them was  calculated to induce a deep seriousness of mind, and to inspire  feelings of awe, dread and even terror, so as to test the candidate's  fortitude of soul to the utmost.    The avenue of approach to an Egyptian temple was flanked on both  sides, sometimes for a mile or more, with great stone sphinxes--that  emblem of man's dual nature, the god emerging from the beast. The  entrance was through a single high doorway between two towering  pylons, presenting a vast surface sculptured and painted over with  many strange and enigmatic figures, and flanked by aspiring obelisks  and seated colossi with faces austere and calm. The large court thus  entered was surrounded by high walls and colonnades, but was open  to the sky. Opposite the first doorway was another, admitting to a  somewhat smaller enclosure, a forest of enormous carved and painted  columns supporting a roof through the apertures of which sunshine  gleamed or dim light filtered down. Beyond this in turn were other  courts and apartments culminating in some inmost sacred sanctuary.    Not alone in their temples, but in their tombs and pyramids and  all the sculptured monuments of the Egyptians, there is the same  insistence upon the sublimity, mystery and awefulness of life,  which they seem to have felt so profoundly. But more than this, the  conscious thought of the masters who conceived them, the buildings of  Egypt give utterance also to the toil and suffering of the thousands  of slaves and captives which hewed the stones out of the heart of the  rock, dragged them long distances and placed them one upon another, so  that these buildings oppress while they inspire, for there is in them  no freedom, no spontaneity, no individuality, but everywhere the felt  presence of an iron conventionality, of a stern immutable law.    In Egyptian architecture is symbolized the condition of the human soul  awakened from its long sleep in nature, and become conscious at once  of its divine source and of the leaden burden of its fleshy envelope.  Egypt is humanity new-born, bound still with an umbilical cord to  nature, and strong not so much with its own strength as with the  strength of its mother. This idea is aptly symbolized in those  gigantic colossi flanking the entrance to some rock-cut temple, which  though entire are yet part of the living cliff out of which they were  fashioned.    In the architecture of Greece the note of dread and mystery yields to  one of pure joyousness and freedom. The terrors of childhood have been  outgrown, and man revels in the indulgence of his unjaded appetites  and in the exercise of his awakened reasoning faculties. In Greek art  is preserved that evanescent beauty of youth which, coming but once  and continuing but"]]]
