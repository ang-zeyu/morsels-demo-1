Do not take out the pin before all the purl and all the  stitches are completed and joined together.      _Joining the Work._    Place the tatting-pin in the loop that is to be joined, and with the  hook draw the thread of the loop--that is, round the hand through  it--pass the shuttle through this loop, and draw it up tightly close to  the stitches.    A \"straight\" or double thread is used to join various parts of the work,  and forms very beautiful patterns. Without the straight thread we  should be unable to imitate point lace patterns, or, indeed, to execute  any designs but those composed of circles, ovals, &c. To use this  straight thread 2 shuttles are required; they should be of different  colours. Sometimes one end of thread is left attached to the reel  instead of using the second shuttle. In commencing a loop the straight  thread is held between the second and third fingers of the left hand,  about 2 or 3 inches from the work; the other shuttle is held as usual in  the right hand, and the stitches and purls worked with it upon the  foundation of the straight thread of the second shuttle.           *       *       *       *       *      TATTING.      1.--_Pine Pattern Collar in Tatting._    [Illustration: I.--Pine Pattern Collar in Tatting.]    Materials: Messrs.

Yet it slowly became evident that such one-sidedness,  however necessary it may have been at the beginning, would make any  practical application impossible. In practical life we never have to  do with what is common to all human beings, even when we are to  influence large masses; we have to deal with personalities whose  mental life is characterized by particular traits of nationality, or  race, or vocation, or sex, or age, or special interests, or other  features by which they differ from the average mind which the  theoretical psychologist may construct as a type. Still more  frequently we have to act with reference to smaller groups or to  single individuals whose mental physiognomy demands careful  consideration. As long as experimental psychology remained essentially  a science of the mental laws, common to all human beings, an  adjustment to the practical demands of daily life could hardly come in  question. With such general laws we could never have mastered the  concrete situations of society, because we should have had to leave  out of view the fact that there are gifted and ungifted, intelligent  and stupid, sensitive and obtuse, quick and slow, energetic and weak  individuals.    But in recent years a complete change can be traced in our science.  Experiments which refer to these individual differences themselves  have been carried on by means of the psychological laboratory, at  first reluctantly and in tentative forms, but within the last ten  years the movement has made rapid progress. To-day we have a  psychology of individual variations from the point of view of the  psychological laboratory.[1] This development of schemes to compare  the differences between the individuals by the methods of experimental  science was after all the most important advance toward the practical  application of psychology. The study of the individual differences  itself is not applied psychology, but it is the presupposition without  which applied psychology would have remained a phantom.          II    THE DEMANDS OF PRACTICAL LIFE      While in this way the progress of psychology itself and the  development of the psychology of individual differences favored the  growth of applied psychology, there arose at the same time an  increasing demand in the midst of practical life. Especially the  teachers and the physicians, later the lawyers as well, looked for  help from exact psychology. The science of education and instruction  had always had some contact with the science of the mind, as the  pedagogues could never forget that the mental development of the child  has to stand in the centre of educational thought. For a long while  pedagogy was still leaning on a philosophical psychology, after that  old-fashioned study of the soul had been given up in psychological  quarters. At last, in the days of progressive experimental psychology,  the time came when the teachers under the pressure of their new needs  began to inquire how far the modern laboratory could aid them in the  classroom. The pedagogical psychology of memory, of attention, of  will, and of intellect was systematically worked up by men with  practical school interests. We may notice in the movement a slow but  most important shifting. At first the results of theoretical  psychology were simply transplanted into the pedagogical field.  Experiments which were carried on in the interest of pure theoretical  science were made practical use of, but their application remained a  mere chance by-product. Only slowly did the pedagogical problems  themselves begin to determine the experimental investigation. The  methods of laboratory psychology were applied for the solving of those  problems which originated in the school experience, and only when this  point was reached could a truly experimental pedagogy be built on a  psychological foundation. We stand in the midst of this vigorous and  healthy movement, which has had a stimulating effect on theoretical  psychology itself.    We find a similar situation in the sphere of the physician. He could  not pass by the new science of the mind without instinctively feeling  that his medical diagnosis and therapy could be furthered in many  directions by the experimental method. Not only the psychiatrist and  nerve specialist, but in a certain sense every physician had made use  of a certain amount of psychology in his professional work. He had  always had to make clear to himself the mental experiences of the  patient, to study his pain sensations and his feelings of comfort,  his fears and his hopes, his perceptions and his volitions, and to a  certain degree he had always tried to influence the mental life of the  patient, to work on him by suggestion and to help him by stimulating  his mind. But as far as a real description and explanation of such  mental experiences came in question, all remained a dilettantic  semi-psychology which worked with the most trivial conceptions of  popular thinking. The medical men recognized the disproportion between  the exactitude of their anatomical, physiological, and pathological  observation and the superficiality of their self-made psychology. Thus  the desire arose in their own medical circle to harmonize their  psychological means of diagnosis and therapy with the schemes of  modern scientific psychology. The physician who examines the  sensations in a nervous disease, or the intelligence in a mental  disease, or heals by suggestion or hypnotism, tries to apply the  latest discoveries of the psychological laboratory. But here, too, the  same development as in pedagogy can be traced. The physicians at first  made use only of results which had been secured under entirely  different points of view, but later the experiments were subordinated  to the special medical problems. Then the physician was no longer  obliged simply to use what he happened to find among the results of  the theoretical psychologist, but carried on the experiments in the  service of medical problems. The independent status of experimental  medical psychology could be secured only by this development.    In somewhat narrower limits the same may be said as to the problems of  law. A kind of popular psychology was naturally involved whenever  judges or lawyers analyzed the experience on the witness stand or  discussed the motives of crime or the confessions of the criminal or  the social conditions of criminality. But when every day brought new  discoveries in the psychological laboratory, it seemed natural to make  use of the new methods and of the new results in the interest of the  courtroom. The power of observation in the witness, the exactitude of  his memory, the character of his illusions and imagination, his  suggestibility and his feeling, appeared in a new light in view of the  experimental investigations, and the emotions and volitions of the  criminal were understood with a new insight. Here, too, the last step  was taken. Instead of being satisfied with experiments which the  psychologist had made for his own purposes, the students of legal  psychology adjusted experiments to the particular needs of the  courtroom. Investigations were carried on to determine, the fidelity  of testimony or to find methods for the detection of hidden thoughts  and so on. Efforts toward the application of psychology have  accordingly grown up in the fields of pedagogy, medicine, and  jurisprudence, but as these studies naturally do not remain  independent of one another, they all together form the one unified  science of applied psychology.[2]    As soon as the independence of this new science was felt, it was  natural that new demands and new problems should continue to originate  within its own limits. There must be applied psychology wherever the  investigation of mental life can be made serviceable to the tasks of  civilization. Criminal law, education, medicine, certainly do not  constitute the totality of civilized life. It is therefore the duty of  the practical psychologist systematically to examine how far other  purposes of modern society can be advanced by the new methods of  experimental psychology. There is, for instance, already, far-reaching  agreement that the problems of artistic creation, of scientific  observation, of social reform, and many similar endeavors must be  acknowledged as organic parts of applied psychology. Only one group of  purposes is so far surprisingly neglected in the realm of the  psychological laboratory: the purposes of the economic life, the  purposes of commerce and industry, of business and the market in the  widest sense of the word. The question how far applied psychology can  be extended in this direction is the topic of the following  discussions.          III    MEANS AND ENDS      Applied psychology is evidently to be classed with the technical  sciences. It may be considered as psychotechnics, since we must  recognize any science as technical if it teaches us to apply  theoretical knowledge for the furtherance of human purposes. Like all  technical sciences, applied psychology tells us what we ought to do if  we want to reach certain ends; but we ought to realize at the  threshold where the limits of such a technical science lie, as they  are easily overlooked, with resulting confusion. We must understand  that every technical science says only: you must make use of this  means, if you wish to reach this or that particular end. But no  technical science can decide within its limits whether the end itself  is really a desirable one. The technical specialist knows how he ought  to build a bridge or how he ought to pierce a tunnel, presupposing  that the bridge or the tunnel is desired. But whether they are  desirable or not is a question which does not concern the technical  scientist, but which must be considered from economic or political or  other points, of view. Everywhere the engineer must know how to reach  an end, and must leave it to others "]]]
