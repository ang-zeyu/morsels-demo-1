(_Continued from page 338_.)      91. _Portrait of the late Earl of Kellie, Lord Lieutenant of the County of  Fife._--D. Wilkie.--A noble portrait, painted for the County Hall, Cupar.    92. _Night_.--H. Howard--An exquisite scene from Milton:--      \"------------now glowed the firmament    With living sapphires: Hesperus that led    The starry host, rode brightest, till the moon,    Rising in clouded majesty, at length    Apparent queen unveiled her peerless light,    And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw.\"    102. _Portrait of the Duchess of Richmond_.--Sir T. Lawrence.    110. _Cardinals, Priests, and Roman Citizens washing the Pilgrims'  Feet_.--D. Wilkie.--This ceremony takes place during the holy week, in  the Convent of Santa Trinita dei Pelligrini; and Mr. Wilkie has infused a  devotional character into this picture which is highly characteristic of  Catholic solemnity.    127. _Portrait of Jeremy Bentham_--H.W. Pickersgill.--An admirable  likeness of the veteran-patriot and political economist.    128. _The Defence of Saragossa_.--D. Wilkie.--The subject is so well  explained in the Catalogue, that we quote it:--    \"The heroine Augustina is here represented on the battery, in front of the  convent of Santa Engratia, where her husband being slain, she found her  way to the station he had occupied, stept over his body, took his place  at the gun, and declared she would herself avenge his death.    \"The principal person engaged in placing the gun is Don Joseph Palafox,  who commanded the garrison during the memorable siege, but who is here  represented in the habit of a volunteer. In front of him is the Reverend  Father Consolacion, an Augustin Friar, who served with great ability as  an engineer, and who, with the crucifix in his hand, is directing at what  object the cannon is to be pointed. On the left side of the picture is  seen Basilico Boggiero, a priest, who was tutor to Palafox, celebrated for  his share in the defence, and for his cruel fate when he fell into the  hands of the enemy. He is writing a despatch to be sent by a carrier  pigeon, to inform their distant friends of the unsubdued energies of the  place.\"    In this part of the room are half a dozen excellent portraits, all by  different artists.    149. _The Soldier's Wife_--W.F. Witherington.--This picture is from an  anecdote of the late Duke of York. His Royal Highness, as he returned one  day from a walk, observed a poor woman in tears, sent away from his house.  On asking the servant who she was, he answered, \"A beggar, some soldier's  wife.\" \"A soldier's wife!\" returned his Royal Highness; \"give her  immediate relief: what is your mistress but a soldier's wife?\"--An  interesting picture, although we do not think the likeness of the  benevolent Duke is very striking. However, the incident must have occurred  a few years previous to his decease.    157. _Lord Byron's Dream_.--C.L. Eastlake.--A rich oriental landscape,  and a most delightful scene of desert stillness.    172. _Portrait of Robert Southey, Esq._--Sir T. Lawrence--We hope the  president's portrait will please the laureate, for he has been rather  tenacious about his \"likenesses\" which have been engraved. The present is,  perhaps, one of the most intellectual portraits in the room, but is too  energetic even for the impassioned poet.    181. _Queen Margaret of Anjou_, being defeated at the battle of Hexham,  flies with the young prince into a forest, where she meets with robbers,  to whose protection she confides her son.--H. P. Briggs.--This subject is  by no means new in art, but is here cleverly treated, and the whole is  very effective.    214. _Othello and Desdemona_.--R. Evans.--Why is Othello in armour? Let  Mr. Planche, in his _Costumes_, look to this.    216. _Portrait of Miss Phillips, of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, as  Juliet_.--H. E. Dawe.--This picture is entirely devoid of flattery; and  is by no means a good likeness of the interesting original.    224. _Roman Princess, with her Attendant, washing the female pilgrim's  feet_.--D. Wilkie--An affecting picture of a truly devotional incident.    246. _Camilla introduced to Gil Blas at the Inn_.--G. S. Newton.--This  picture is considered to be Mr. Newton's _chef d'oeuvre_. The landlord is  entering the chamber with a flambeau in his hand lighting in a lady, more  beautiful than young, and very richly dressed; she is supported by an old  squire, and a little Moorish page carries her train. The lankiness of  Camilla is somewhat objectionable, but the head is exquisitely animated.  The sentimentality of Gil Blas too, is excellent.    293. _The Confessional--Pilgrims confessing in the Basilica of  St. Peter's_.--D. Wilkie.--An interesting picture, though not equal to  others by the same artist, in the present exhibition.    322. _Hadleigh Castle. The mouth of the Thames--morning after a stormy  night_--J. Constable--The picturesque beauty of this scene is spoiled by  the spotty \"manner of the artist.\"    352. _Coronation of the Remains of Ines de Castro_.--G. St. Evie.--An  attractive picture of one of the most extraordinary scenes in history.  The remains of Dona Ines de Castro taken out of her tomb six years after  the interment, when she was proclaimed queen of Portugal. This is an  illustration of Mrs. Hemans's beautiful lines which we quoted in a recent  number of the MIRROR.    455. _Portrait of Mrs. Locke, sen_.--Sir T. Lawrence.--A Reubens-like  portrait of a benevolent lady, and which we take to be an excellent  likeness.    592. _Portrait of John Parker, Esq. on his favourite horse Coroner, with  the Worcestershire fox hounds_.--T. Woodward.--We can relate a curious  circumstance connected with this picture. While in the room, a country  gentleman and his lady inquired of us the subject--we turned to the number  in the Catalogue, and gave him the desired information. \"Ah,\" said he,  \"I was sure it was _Parker_, and told my wife the same, although I was not  previously aware of his portrait being in the Exhibition.\" We should think  the resemblance must be very striking.    The _Antique Academy_ is almost covered with portraits, and the miniatures  hang in cluster-like abundance--so that what with bright eyes and  luxuriant tresses, this is not the least attractive of the rooms.    In the _Library_ are several fine architectural drawings; among which is  a view of Chatsworth, by Sir J. Wyatville, including, as we suppose, all  the magnificent additions and improvements, now in progress there. Mr.  Soane's Designs for entrances to the Parks and the western part of  London, (which we alluded to in our No. 360,) are likewise here.    In the _Model Academy_, Messrs. Chantrey and Westmacott have some fine  groups, and Behnes three fine busts--the Duke of Cumberland, Princess  Victoria, and Lady Eliz. Gower.    It would be easy to extend this notice through the present and next  number, but as other matters press, and as all the town go to Somerset  House, we hope this notice will be sufficient; for it is not in our  power to enumerate half the fine pictures in the Exhibition, much as we  rejoice at this flourishing prospect of British art.           *       *       *       *       *      MULREADY'S \"WOLF AND LAMB.\"      In a preceding number we stated that the copyright of this picture had  been purchased for 1,000 guineas, and appropriated to the Artists' Fund,  which a correspondent, and \"a member of the Fund,\" informs us is not the  fact. He assures us that the original picture was purchased some years  since by his Majesty, who granted the loan of it to the society, at whose  expense it was engraved; the sale of the prints producing 1,000_l_. to the  Fund. Mr. Mulready has the merit of painting the picture and procuring the  loan of it; but our version of the affair would make it appear otherwise.  We copied our notice from the newspapers, where it was stated, as from the  Lord Chancellor, at the Fund Dinner, that Mr. Mulready had relinquished  his copyright to the picture for the benefit of the Fund, which had thus  produced 1,000_l_.; but we thank our correspondent for his correction.           *       *       *       *       *          THE SELECTOR AND LITERARY NOTICES OF _NEW WORKS_.           *       *       *        *       *    FIVE NIGHTS OF ST. ALBAN'S.      This is a work of pure fiction, and is one of the most splendidly  imaginative books we have met with for a long time. It is attributed to  the author of the \"First and Last\" sketches in _Blackwood's Magazine_,  some of which have already been transferred to our pages. No further  recommendation can be requisite; but to give the reader some idea of the  vivid style in which the work is written, we detach two episodal extracts.      THE IDIOT GIRL.      When Peverell reached his own house, his man Francis met him with a  strangely mysterious look and manner.    \"Here is one within,\" said he, \"that will not, by any dint of persuasion,  go; though I have been two good hours trying my skill to that end.\"    \"Who is it?\" inquired Peverell.    \"That, neither, can I discover,\" quoth Francis. \"She knocked at the  door--it might be something after eleven, perhaps near upon twelve--and  when I opened it, she whips into the hall without saying a word, walks  into every room in the house--I following her, as a beadle follows a rogue,  till he sees him beyond the parish bounds--and at last takes possession of  your low chair, and, without so much as 'by your leave,' begins to wring  her hands, and cry 'Lord! Lord!'--What do you want, good woman?\" said I.  But I might as well have addressed myself to the walls, for 'Lord! Lord!'  was all her moan.\"    Peverell hastened into the room, and there he saw poor Madge--her face  buried in her hands, rocking to and fro, weeping most piteously, and as  Francis had described, ever and anon calling upon the Lord, but in a tone  of such utter wretchedness, that it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11352"],[0,"Germany and the Next War (#2)"],[1," fleet; its strength   --Importance of coast defences--Necessity of accelerating our    naval armaments--The building of the fleet--The institution of    the air-fleet--Preliminary measures for a war on commerce--    Mobilization--General points of view with regard to preparations    for the naval war--Lost opportunities in the past      CHAPTER XIII  THE ARMY AND POPULAR EDUCATION    The universal importance of national education--Its value for the    army--Hurtful influences at work on it--Duties of the State with    regard to national health--Work and sport--The importance of    the school--The inadequacy of our national schools--Military    education and education in the national schools--Methods of    instruction in the latter--Necessity for their reform--Continuation    schools--Influence of national education on the Russo-Japanese    War--Other means of national education--The propaganda of    action      CHAPTER XIV  FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL PREPARATION FOR WAR    Duties of the State in regard to war preparations--The State and    national credit--The financial capacity of Germany--Necessity of    new sources of revenue--The imperial right of inheritance--Policy    of interests and alliances--Moulding and exploitation of the    political situation--The laws of political conduct--Interaction of    military and political war preparations--Political preparations    for our next war--Governing factors in the conduct of German policy      EPILOGUE    The latest political events--Conduct of the German Imperial Government   --The arrangement with France--Anglo-French relations and    the attitude of England--The requirements of the situation          GERMANY AND THE NEXT WAR        INTRODUCTION    The value of war for the political and moral development of mankind has  been criticized by large sections of the modern civilized world in a way  which threatens to weaken the defensive powers of States by undermining  the warlike spirit of the people. Such ideas are widely disseminated in  Germany, and whole strata of our nation seem to have lost that ideal  enthusiasm which constituted the greatness of its history. With the  increase of wealth they live for the moment, they are incapable of  sacrificing the enjoyment of the hour to the service of great  conceptions, and close their eyes complacently to the duties of our  future and to the pressing problems of international life which await a  solution at the present time.    We have been capable of soaring upwards. Mighty deeds raised Germany  from political disruption and feebleness to the forefront of European  nations. But we do not seem willing to take up this inheritance, and to  advance along the path of development in politics and culture. We  tremble at our own greatness, and shirk the sacrifices it demands from  us. Yet we do not wish to renounce the claim which we derive from our  glorious past. How rightly Fichte once judged his countrymen when he  said the German can never wish for a thing by itself; he must always  wish for its contrary also.    The Germans were formerly the best fighting men and the most warlike  nation of Europe. For a long time they have proved themselves to be the  ruling people of the Continent by the power of their arms and the  loftiness of their ideas. Germans have bled and conquered on countless  battlefields in every part of the world, and in late years have shown  that the heroism of their ancestors still lives in the descendants. In  striking contrast to this military aptitude they have to-day become a  peace-loving--an almost \"too\" peace-loving--nation. A rude shock is  needed to awaken their warlike instincts, and compel them to show their  military strength.    This strongly-marked love of peace is due to various causes.    It springs first from the good-natured character of the German people,  which finds intense satisfaction in doctrinaire disputations and  partisanship, but dislikes pushing things to an extreme. It is connected  with another characteristic of the German nature. Our aim is to be just,  and we strangely imagine that all other nations with whom we exchange  relations share this aim. We are always ready to consider the peaceful  assurances of foreign diplomacy and of the foreign Press to be no less  genuine and true than our own ideas of peace, and we obstinately resist  the view that the political world is only ruled by interests and never  from ideal aims of philanthropy. \"Justice,\" Goethe says aptly, \"is a  quality and a phantom of the Germans.\" We are always inclined to assume  that disputes between States can find a peaceful solution on the basis  of justice without clearly realizing what _international_ justice is.    An additional cause of the love of peace, besides those which are rooted  in the very soul of the German people, is the wish not to be disturbed  in commercial life.    The Germans are born business men, more than any others in the world.  Even before the beginning of the Thirty Years' War, Germany was perhaps  the greatest trading Power in the world, and in the last forty years  Germany's trade has made marvellous progress under the renewed expansion  of her political power. Notwithstanding our small stretch of coast-line,  we have created in a few years the second largest merchant fleet in the  world, and our young industries challenge competition with all the great  industrial States of the earth. German trading-houses are established  all over the world; German merchants traverse every quarter of the  globe; a part, indeed, of English wholesale trade is in the hands of  Germans, who are, of course, mostly lost to their own country. Under  these conditions our national wealth has increased with rapid strides.    Our trade and our industries--owners no less than employes--do not want  this development to be interrupted. They believe that peace is the  essential condition of commerce. They assume that free competition will  be conceded to us, and do not reflect that our victorious wars have  never disturbed our business life, and that the political power regained  by war rendered possible the vast progress of our trade and commerce.    Universal military service, too, contributes to the love of peace, for  war in these days does not merely affect, as formerly, definite limited  circles, but the whole nation suffers alike. All families and all  classes have to pay the same toll of human lives. Finally comes the  effect of that universal conception of peace so characteristic of the  times--the idea that war in itself is a sign of barbarism unworthy of an  aspiring people, and that the finest blossoms of culture can only unfold  in peace.    Under the many-sided influence of such views and aspirations, we seem  entirely to have forgotten the teaching which once the old German Empire  received with \"astonishment and indignation\" from Frederick the Great,  that \"the rights of States can only be asserted by the living power\";  that what was won in war can only be kept by war; and that we Germans,  cramped as we are by political and geographical conditions, require the  greatest efforts to hold and to increase what we have won. We regard our  warlike preparations as an almost insupportable burden, which it is the  special duty of the German Reichstag to lighten so far as possible. We  seem to have forgotten that the conscious increase of our armament is  not an inevitable evil, but the most necessary precondition of our  national health, and the only guarantee of our international prestige.  We are accustomed to regard war as a curse, and refuse to recognize it  as the greatest factor in the furtherance of culture and power.    Besides this clamorous need of peace, and in spite of its continued  justification, other movements, wishes, and efforts, inarticulate and  often unconscious, live in the depths of the soul of the German people.  The agelong dream of the German nation was realized in the political  union of the greater part of the German races and in the founding of the  German Empire. Since then there lives in the hearts of all (I would not  exclude even the supporters of the anti-national party) a proud  consciousness of strength, of regained national unity, and of increased  political power. This consciousness is supported by the fixed  determination never to abandon these acquisitions. The conviction is  universal that every attack upon these conquests will rouse the whole  nation with enthusiastic unanimity to arms. We all wish, indeed, to be  able to maintain our present position in the world without a conflict,  and we live in the belief that the power of our State will steadily  increase without our needing to fight for it. We do not at the bottom of  our hearts shrink from such a conflict, but we look towards it with a  certain calm confidence, and are inwardly resolved never to let  ourselves be degraded to an inferior position without striking a blow.  Every appeal to force finds a loud response in the hearts of all. Not  merely in the North, where a proud, efficient, hard-working race with  glorious traditions has grown up under the laurel-crowned banner of  Prussia, does this feeling thrive as an unconscious basis of all  thought, sentiment, and volition, in the depth of the soul; but in the  South also, which has suffered for centuries under the curse of petty  nationalities, the haughty pride and ambition of the German stock live  in the heart of the people. Here and there, maybe, such emotions slumber  in the shade of a jealous particularism, overgrown by the richer and  more luxuriant forms of social intercourse; but still they are animated  by latent energy; here, too, the germs of mighty national consciousness  await their awakening.    Thus the political power of our nation, while fully alive below the  surface, is fettered externally by this love of peace. It fritters  itself away in fruitless bickerings and doctrinaire disputes. We no  longer have a clearly"]]]
