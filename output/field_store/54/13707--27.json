How it exactly happened  I cannot say, but as Aspinall was steadying himself, when at top speed,  for an almost point-blank delivery, I saw Acton break his own stride,  shoot out his leg, and the next moment the International was stumbling  forward, whilst the ball rolled harmlessly onward into our goal-keeper's  hands. I could hardly believe my own eyes, but it was a deliberate trip,  if ever there was one! Aspinall tried to recover himself, failed, and came  with a sickening crash against the goal-post. I blew the whistle and  rushed to Aspinall; his cheek was bleeding villainously and he was deadly  pale. I helped him up, and he said with his usual smile--who could mistake  it for a sneer?--\"Thanks, old man. Yes, I do feel a bit seedy. That back  of yours is an animal, though.\" He tried hard to keep his senses; I saw  him battling against his faintness, but the pain and shock were too much  for him; he fell down again in a dead faint.    We improvised a hurdle and carried him up to the school. Acton, pale to  the lips, prepared to bear a hand, but Bourne unceremoniously took him by  the arm and said with concentration, \"No thanks, Acton. We'll excuse  you--you beastly cad!\" I heard Bourne's remark, though no one else saw or  heard. Acton's hand closed involuntarily, and he gave Bourne a vitriolic  look, but did nothing nor said anything. We took Aspinall up to  Merishall's--his old house--where he was staying, and left him there still  unconscious.    What astonished me was that no one save Bourne had noticed the trip, but  when I came to think it over the explanation was easy. Acton had, whether  from accident or of purpose, \"covered\" his man and blocked the view from  behind. I myself had not really _seen_ the trip, but it would have  been plainly visible for any one opposite on the touch-line, and luckily  there was no one opposite. The goal-keeper might have seen it, but Roberts  never attends to anything but the ball--the reason he's the fine keeper  that he is. Bourne had actually seen it, being practically with Acton, and  I knew by his pale face and scornful eyes that he would dearly have liked  to kick Acton on the spot.    I was, as you may guess, intensely pleased that no one had an idea of the  foul except Bourne and myself, for I could imagine vividly where the  rumour of this sort of \"form\" would spread to. We'd hear of it for years  after.    I mentally promised that Acton should have a little of my opinion on the  matter on the first opportunity.          CHAPTER II    THE PENALTY      I arranged to see Bourne that evening, when we should have heard the  doctor's report on Aspinall. In the evening Bourne strolled into my room,  looking a little less gloomy than I expected. \"Briggs says that there is  nothing broken, and that as soon as Aspinall gets over the shock he will  be all right. The cut may leave a scar, but that will be about all. All  the same, Carr, I think that's too heavy a price to pay for the bad temper  of one of our fellows who can't stand a tumble into the mud at 'footer.'  You saw the villainy, didn't you?\"    \"I can't say I actually saw him trip, but there's no doubt whatever that  it was an abominable foul.\"    \"None at all. I saw him, worse luck, tolerably plainly.\"    \"Do you know anything about him?\"    \"Practically nothing.\"    \"I think Biffen's rather fancy he's going to lift them out of the mire.\"    \"Can't say I envy them their champion.\"    \"What strikes me as odd is that such a magnificent player should do such a  vile trick.\"    \"Rum, certainly. The affair will give quite a professional touch to our  'Socker' fixtures, and the Carthusians will ask us to bar our bullies when  they come down again. Oh, this _is_ sweet!\"    \"I say, Bourne, this business must not move one inch further. You've  spoken to no one?\"    \"Is it likely?\"    \"We'll not have any of our dirty linen washed _coram populo_, old  chap. Frightful bad form. No one knows but you, Aspinall, and self.\"    \"Surely Aspinall will----\"    \"You don't know Aspinall, old man. He'd shrivel up sooner than say a word  more. Bet you he'll speak of it as an accident. Remember, he was captain  of the school here once.\"    \"Which makes it a blacker shame than ever,\" said Bourne, wrathfully.    \"I've inquired casually of the Fifth, and it seems our friend once  distinguished himself in the gym. Lost his temper--as _per  recipe_--and Hodgson had to knock him down before he could see that  we put on the gloves here for a little healthy exercise, and the pleasure  of lifting some of the public schools championships. He, however,  apologized to Hodgson, but I don't think he'll do the honourable here.\"    \"Then, the chief attraction of the beauty is its temper?\"    \"Or want of it.\"    \"Who is he, anyhow?\"    \"Yorkshire people, I believe. Own half a town and no end of coin. Been to  school in France and Germany, and consequently came here rather late. I  know his head-piece Is all right, and I imagine his amiability is only a  little foreign blood working its way out. He will be with us in the Sixth  at Christmas.\"    \"Delightful prospect. What I want to know is--how are we to settle this  business as far as he is concerned? Ought Moore to know?\"    \"I don't think so. Never trouble Corker more than you can help, old man.  That's a tip for you when I'm gone. Besides, masters generally mishandle  affairs of this sort. I rather fancy I'll put it to Aspinall when he pulls  through.\"    \"Do. One thing, though, is pretty certain. He'll never get his cap as long  as I'm captain of the footer eleven. I'd rather come out of it myself.\"    \"Of course. I see there's no help for that, but, all the same, it will  make complications. What a pity he _can_ play!\"    \"It is, for he is a back out of a thousand.\"    Bourne's voice had in it a ring of genuine regret, and whilst I could  almost have smiled at his unaffectedly tragic tone, I could see the vista  which his resolution opened up. I heard the school shouting at Bourne to  let the finest player out of the eleven in, and all the shouting would be  across \"seas of misunderstanding.\" I know Bourne saw the difficulties  himself, and he left my study soon after with a rather anxious look on his  face. Personally I determined not to think about the matter until I had  seen Aspinall. From the very first I had never expected any help from  Acton. There was something about the whole of his bearing in the caddish  business that told me plainly that we would have to treat him, not as a  fellow who had been betrayed to a vile action by a beastly temper and was  bitterly sorry for it, but as a fellow who hated us for finding it out.    I saw Aspinall two days later, and as we walked towards the station I  broached the matter.    \"Certainly; I thought he tripped me, but he has written me and said how  sorry he was for my accident, so, of course, it rests there.\"    \"Candidly, Aspinall, have you any doubt yourself?\"    \"No, old fellow. I'm sorry, but I really think he tripped me. He was riled  at a little hustling from Shannon's lot, and I may have upset him myself  occasionally. But it is a small matter.\"    I looked at the bandages across his cheek, and I didn't think it small.    \"But, Aspinall, even if we leave you out of the business, it isn't a small  matter for us, especially for Bourne.\"    \"Well, no; hardly for you,\" he admitted. \"'Twas a piece of sheer bad form.  It shouldn't be done at our place at all.\"    \"If you were in Bourne's place would you bar him his place in the eleven?\"    Aspinall considered a full minute.    \"On the whole, I think I should--at least, for one term; but I'd most  certainly let him know why he was not to have his cap--privately, of  course. I should not like it to get about, and I do not fancy Acton will  say much about it.\"    That night Bourne and I crossed over to Biffen's, and waylaid Acton in his  den. I'm pretty sure there wasn't another room like his in the whole  school. No end of swell pictures--foreign mostly; lovely little books,  which, I believe, were foreign also; an etching of his own place up in  Yorkshire; carpets, and rugs, and little statuettes--swagger through and  through; a little too much so, I believe, for the rules, but Biffen  evidently had not put his foot down. Acton was standing on the hearthrug  with his back to the fire, and on seeing us he politely offered us chairs  with the air of a gentleman and a something of grace, which was a trifle  foreign.    I saw that Acton's polite cordiality nettled Bourne more than a little,  but he solemnly took a chair, and in his blunt, downright fashion, plunged  headlong into the business.    \"Only came to say a word or two, Acton, about Thursday's match.\"    \"A very good one,\" he remarked, with what Corker calls \"detached  interest.\" \"Aspinall's accident was more than unfortunate.\"    \"The fact is,\" said Bourne, bluntly, \"neither Carr nor I believe it was an  accident.\"    \"No? What was it, then? Every one else thought it was, though.\"    \"We know better. We know that you deliberately fouled him, and----\"    Acton paled, and his eyes glittered viciously, though he said calmly,  \"That is a lie.\"    \"And,\" continued Bourne, \"though there is not a fellow even a respectable  second to you at 'footer,' I shall not give you your cap as long as I am  captain of the eleven. That is all I came to say.\"    Acton said quite calmly (why was he so uncommonly cool, I asked  myself?)--though his face was red and white alternately: \"Then listen  carefully to what I say. I particularly wanted to have my footer cap--why,  does not concern any one but myself--and I don't fancy losing it because a  couple of fellows see something that a hundred others couldn't see, for the  sufficient reason that there wasn't anything to see. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14776"],[0,"The Arabian Art of Taming and Training Wild & Vicious Horses (#2)"],[1," a matter  of course, on a very simple scale. The first foot defense, it is said,  which was given to the horse, was on the same principle as that worn by  man, which was a sort of sandal, made of leather and tied to the horse's  foot, by means of straps or strings. And finally plates of metal were  fastened to the horse's feet by the same simple means.    Here again, as in the case of the sturrupless saddle, when we reflect that  men should, for nearly a thousand years, have gone on fastening plates of  metal under horses' hoofs by the clumsy means of straps and strings,  without its ever occurring to them to try so simple an improvement as  nails, we have another remarkable demonstration of the slow steps by which  horsemanship has reached its present state.    In the forgoing remarks I have taken the liberty of extracting several  facts from a valuable little work by Rolla Springfield. With this short  comment on the rise and progress of horsemanship, from its commencement up  to the present time, I will proceed to give you the principles of a new  theory of taming wild horses, which is the result of many experiments and  a thorough investigation and trial of the different methods of  horsemanship now in use.          THE THREE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES  OF MY THEORY      Founded on the Leading Characteristics of the Horse.    FIRST.--That he is so constituted by nature that he will not offer  resistance to any demand made of him which he fully comprehends, if made  in a way consistent with the laws of his nature.    SECOND.--That he has no consciousness of his strength beyond his  experience, and can be handled according to our will, without force.    THIRD.--That we can, in compliance with the laws of his nature by which he  examines all things new to him, take any object, however frightful,  around, over or on him, that does not inflict pain, without causing him to  fear.    To take these assertions in order, I will first give you some of the  reasons why I think he is naturally obedient, and will not offer  resistance to anything fully comprehended. The horse, though possessed of  some faculties superior to man's being deficient in reasoning powers, has  no knowledge of right or wrong, of free will and independent government,  and knows not of any imposition practiced upon him, however unreasonable  these impositions may be. Consequently, he cannot come to any decision  what he should or should not do, because he has not the reasoning  faculties of man to argue the justice of the thing demanded of him. If he  had, taking into consideration his superior strength, he would be useless  to man as a servant. Give him _mind_ in proportion to his strength, and he  will demand of us the green fields for an inheritance, where he will roam  at leisure, denying the right of servitude at all. God has wisely formed  his nature so that it can be operated upon by the knowledge of man  according to the dictates of his will, and he might well be termed an  unconscious, submissive servant. This truth we can see verified in every  day's experience by the abuses practiced upon him. Any one who chooses to  be so cruel, can mount the noble steed and run him 'till he drops with  fatigue, or, as is often the case with more spirited, fall dead with the  rider. If he had the power to reason, would he not vault and pitch his  rider, rather than suffer him to run him to death? Or would he condescend  to carry at all the vain imposter, who, with but equal intellect, was  trying to impose on his equal rights and equally independent spirit? But  happily for us, he has no consciousness of imposition, no thought of  disobedience except by impulse caused by the violation of the law of  nature. Consequently when disobedient it is the fault of man.    Then, we can but come to the conclusion, that if a horse is not taken in a  way at variance with the law of his nature, he will do anything that he  fully comprehends without making any offer of resistance.    _Second._ The fact of the horse being unconscious of the amount of his  strength, can be proven to the satisfaction of any one. For instance, such  remarks as these are common, and perhaps familiar to your recollection.  One person says to another, \"If that wild horse there was conscious of the  amount of his strength, his owner could have no business with him in that  vehicle; such light reins and harness, too; if he knew he could snap them  asunder in a minute and be as free as the air we breathe;\" and, \"that  horse yonder that is pawing and fretting to follow the company that is  fast leaving him, if he knew his strength he would not remain long  fastened to that hitching post so much against his will, by a strap that  would no more resist his powerful weight and strength, than a cotton  thread would bind a strong man.\" Yet these facts made common by every day  occurrence, are not thought of as anything wonderful. Like the ignorant  man who looks at the different phases of the moon, you look at these  things as he looks at her different changes, without troubling your mind  with the question, \"Why are these things so?\" What would be the condition  of the world if all our minds lay dormant? If men did not think, reason  and act, our undisturbed, slumbering intellects would not excel the  imbecility of the brute; we would live in chaos, hardly aware of our  existence. And yet with all our activity of mind, we daily pass by  unobserved that which would be wonderful if philosophised and reasoned  upon, and with the same inconsistency wonder at that which a little  consideration, reason and philosophy would be but a simple affair.    _Thirdly._ He will allow any object, however frightful in appearance, to  come around, over or on him, that does not inflict pain.    We know from a natural course of reasoning, that there has never been an  effected without a cause, and we infer from this, that there can be no  action, either in animate or inanimate matter, without there first being  some cause to produce it. And from this self-evident fact we know that  there is some cause for every impulse or movement of either mind or  matter, and that this law governs every action or movement of the animal  kingdom. Then, according to this theory, there must be some cause before  fear can exist; and, if fear exists from the effect of imagination, and  not from the infliction of real pain, it can be removed by complying with  those laws of nature by which the horse examines an object, and determines  upon its innocence or harm.    A log or stump by the road-side may be, in the imagination of the horse,  some great beast about to pounce upon him; but after you take him up to it  and let him stand by it a little while, and touch it with his nose, and go  through his process of examination, he will not care any thing more about  it. And the same principle and process will have the same effect with any  other object, however frightful in appearance, in which there is no harm.  Take a boy that has been frightened by a false-face or any other object  that he could not comprehend at once; but let him take that face or object  in his hands and examine it, and he will not care anything more about it.  This is a demonstration of the same principle.    With this introduction to the principles of my theory, I shall next  attempt to teach you how to put it into practice, and whatever  instructions may follow, you can rely on as having been proven practical  by my own experiments. And knowing from experience just what obstacles I  have met with in handling bad horses, I shall try to anticipate them for  you, and assist you in surmounting them, by commencing with the first  steps taken with the colt, and accompanying you through the whole task of  breaking.      HOW TO SUCCEED IN GETTING THE COLT FROM PASTURE.    Go to the pasture and walk around the whole herd quietly, and at such a  distance as not to cause them to scare and run. Then approach them very  slowly, and if they stick up their heads and seem to be frightened, hold  on until they become quiet, so as not to make them run before you are  close enough to drive them in the direction you want to go. And when you  begin to drive, do not flourish your arms or hollow, but gently follow  them off leaving the direction free for them that you wish them to take.  Thus taking advantage of their ignorance, you will be able to get them in  the pound as easily as the hunter drives the quails into his net. For, if  they have always run into the pasture uncared for, (as many horses do in  prairie countries and on large plantations,) there is no reason why they  should not be as wild as the sportsman's birds and require the same gentle  treatment, if you want to get them without trouble; for the horse in his  natural state is as wild as any of the undomesticated animals, though more  easily tamed than most of them.      HOW TO STABLE A COLT WITHOUT TROUBLE.    The next step will be, to get the horse into a stable or shed. This should  be done as quietly as possible, so as not to excite any suspicion in the  horse of any danger befalling him. The best way to do this, is to lead a  gentle horse into the stable first and hitch him, then quietly walk around  the colt and let him go in of his own accord. It is almost impossible to  get men, who have never practiced on this principle, to go slow and  considerate enough about it. They do not know that in handling a wild  horse, above all other things, is that good old adage true, that \"haste  makes waste;\" that is, waste of time, for the gain of trouble and  perplexity.    One wrong move may frighten your horse, and make him think it is necessary  to escape at all hazards for the safety of his life, and thus make two  hours work of a ten minutes job; and this would be all your own fault, and  entirely unnecessary; for he will not run unless you run after him, and  that would not be good policy, unless you knew that you could outrun"]]]
