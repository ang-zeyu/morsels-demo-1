It takes the fresh-faced young  men down past the inner harbour to where lie the tall ships waiting.  They and their cargo of exuberance, of hope, of energy, of thirst for  the bubble adventure, the rainbow romance, sail away to where these  wares have a market. And the quiet men glide away to the North. Their  wares have been marketed. The sleepy, fierce, passionate, sunny lands  have taken all they had to bring. And have given in exchange?  Indifference, ill-health, a profound realization that the length of days  are as nothing at all; a supreme agnosticism as to the ultimate value of  anything that a single man can do, a sublime faith that it must be done,  the power to concentrate, patience illimitable; contempt for danger,  disregard of death, the intention to live; a final, weary estimate of  the fact that mere things are as unimportant here as there, no matter  how quaintly or fantastically they are dressed or named, and a  corresponding emptiness of anticipation for the future--these items are  only a random few of the price given by the ancient lands for that which  the northern races bring to them. What other alchemical changes have  been wrought only these lean and weary men could know--if they dared  look so far within themselves. And even if they dared, they would not  tell.    FOOTNOTES:    [1] In old days before the \"improvements.\"          II.    THE FAREWELL.      We boarded ship, filled with a great, and what seemed to us, an  unappeasable curiosity as to what we were going to see. It was not a  very big ship, in spite of the grandiloquent descriptions in the  advertisements, or the lithograph wherein she cut grandly and evenly  through huge waves to the manifest discomfiture of infinitesimal sailing  craft bobbing alongside. She was manned entirely by Germans. The room  stewards waited at table, cleaned the public saloons, kept the library,  rustled the baggage, and played in the band. That is why we took our  music between meals. Our staterooms were very tiny indeed. Each was  provided with an electric fan; a totally inadequate and rather  aggravating electric fan once we had entered the Red Sea. Just at this  moment we paid it little attention, for we were still in full enjoyment  of sunny France, where, in our own experience, it had rained two months  steadily. Indeed, at this moment it was raining, raining a steady, cold,  sodden drizzle that had not even the grace to pick out the surface of  the harbour in the jolly dancing staccato that goes far to lend  attraction to a genuinely earnest rainstorm.    Down the long quay splashed cabs and omnibuses, their drivers glistening  in wet capes, to discharge under the open shed at the end various hasty  individuals who marshalled long lines of porters with astonishing  impedimenta and drove them up the gang-plank. A half-dozen roughs  lounged aimlessly. A little bent old woman with a shawl over her head  searched here and there. Occasionally she would find a twisted splinter  of wood torn from the piles by a hawser or gouged from the planking by  heavy freight, or kicked from the floor by the hoofs of horses. This she  deposited carefully in a small covered market basket. She was entirely  intent on this minute and rather pathetic task, quite unattending the  greatness of the ship, or the many people the great hulk swallowed or  spat forth.    Near us against the rail leaned a dark-haired young Englishman whom  later every man on that many-nationed ship came to recognize and to  avoid as an insufferable bore. Now, however, the angel of good  inspiration stooped to him. He tossed a copper two-sou piece down to the  bent old woman. She heard the clink of the fall, and looked up  bewildered. One of the waterside roughs slouched forward. The Englishman  shouted a warning and a threat, indicating in pantomime for whom the  coin was intended. To our surprise that evil-looking wharf rat smiled  and waved his hand reassuringly, then took the old woman by the arm to  show her where the coin had fallen. She hobbled to it with a haste  eloquent of the horrible Marseillaise poverty-stricken alleys, picked it  up joyously, turned--and with a delightful grace kissed her finger-tips  towards the ship.    Apparently we all of us had a few remaining French coins; and certainly  we were all grateful to the young Englishman for his happy thought. The  sous descended as fast as the woman could get to where they fell. So  numerous were they that she had no time to express her gratitude except  in broken snatches or gesture, in interrupted attitudes of the most  complete thanksgiving. The day of miracles for her had come; and from  the humble poverty that valued tiny and infrequent splinters of wood she  had suddenly come into great wealth. Everybody was laughing, but in a  very kindly sort of way it seemed to me; and the very wharf rats and  gamins, wolfish and fierce in their everyday life of the water-front,  seemed to take a genuine pleasure in pointing out to her the  resting-place of those her dim old eyes had not seen. Silver pieces  followed. These were too wonderful. She grew more and more excited,  until several of the passengers leaning over the rail began to murmur  warningly, fearing harm. After picking up each of these silver pieces,  she bowed and gestured very gracefully, waving both hands outward,  lifting eyes and hands to heaven, kissing her fingers, trying by every  means in her power to express the dazzling wonder and joy that this  unexpected marvel was bringing her. When she had done all these things  many times, she hugged herself ecstatically. A very well-dressed and  prosperous-looking Frenchman standing near seemed to be a little afraid  she might hug him. His fear had, perhaps, some grounds, for she shook  hands with everybody all around, and showed them her wealth in her  kerchief, explaining eagerly, the tears running down her face.    Now the gang-plank was drawn aboard, and the band struck up the usual  lively air. At the first notes the old woman executed a few feeble  little jig steps in sheer exuberance. Then the solemnity of the  situation sobered her. Her great, wealthy, powerful, kind friends were  departing on their long voyage over mysterious seas. Again and again,  very earnestly, she repeated the graceful, slow pantomime--the wave of  the arms outward, the eyes raised to heaven, the hands clasped finally  over her head. As the brown strip of water silently widened between us  it was strangely like a stage scene--the roofed sheds of the quay, the  motionless groups, the central figure of the old woman depicting  emotion.    Suddenly she dropped her hands and hobbled away at a great rate,  disappearing finally into the maze of the street beyond. Concluding that  she had decided to get quickly home with her great treasure, we  commended her discretion and gave our attention to other things.    The drizzle fell uninterruptedly. We had edged sidewise the requisite  distance, and were now gathering headway in our long voyage. The quail  was beginning to recede and to diminish. Back from the street hastened  the figure of the little old woman. She carried a large white cloth, of  which she had evidently been in quest. This she unfolded and waved  vigorously with both hands. Until we had passed quite from sight she  stood there signalling her farewell. Long after we were beyond  distinguishing her figure we could catch the flutter of white. Thus that  ship's company, embarking each on his Great Adventure, far from home and  friends, received their farewell, a very genuine farewell, from one poor  old woman. B. ventured the opinion that it was the best thing we had  bought with our French money.          III.    PORT SAID.      The time of times to approach Port Said is just at the fall of dusk.  Then the sea lies in opalescent patches, and the low shores fade away  into the gathering night. The slanting masts and yards of the dhows  silhouette against a sky of the deepest translucent green; and the  heroic statue of De Lesseps, standing for ever at the Gateway he opened,  points always to the mysterious East.    The rhythmical, accustomed chug of the engines had fallen to quarter  speed, leaving an uncanny stillness throughout the ship. Silently we  slipped between the long piers, drew up on the waterside town, seized  the buoy, and came to rest. All around us lay other ships of all sizes,  motionless on the inky water. The reflections from their lights seemed  to be thrust into the depths, like stilts; and the few lights from the  town reflected shiveringly across. Along the water-front all was dark  and silent. We caught the loom of buildings; and behind them a dull glow  as from a fire, and guessed tall minarets, and heard the rising and  falling of chanting. Numerous small boats hovered near, floating in and  out of the patches of light we ourselves cast, waiting for permission to  swarm at the gang-plank for our patronage.    We went ashore, passed through a wicket gate, and across the dark  buildings to the heart of the town, whence came the dull glow and the  sounds of people.    Here were two streets running across one another, both brilliantly  lighted, both thronged, both lined with little shops. In the latter one  could buy anything, in any language, with any money. In them we saw  cheap straw hats made in Germany hung side by side with gorgeous and  beautiful stuffs from the Orient; shoddy European garments and Eastern  jewels; cheap celluloid combs and curious embroideries. The crowd of  passers-by in the streets were compounded in the same curiously mixed  fashion; a few Europeans, generally in white, and then a variety of  Arabs, Egyptians, Somalis, Berbers, East Indians and the like, each in  his own gaudy or graceful costume. It speaks well for the accuracy of  feeling, anyway, of our various \"Midways,\" \"Pikes,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14460"],[0,"Faust: a Tragedy [part 1], Translated from the German of Goethe (#2)"],[1,"t, from feeling's deepest fountain springing,  Scarce from the stammering lips had faintly passed,  Now, hopeful, venturing forth, now shyly clinging,  To the wild moment's cry a prey is cast.  Oft when for years the brain had heard it ringing  It comes in full and rounded shape at last.  What shines, is born but for the moment's pleasure;  The genuine leaves posterity a treasure.    _Merry Person_. Posterity! I'm sick of hearing of it;  Supposing I the future age would profit,  Who then would furnish ours with fun?  For it must have it, ripe and mellow;  The presence of a fine young fellow,  Is cheering, too, methinks, to any one.  Whoso can pleasantly communicate,  Will not make war with popular caprices,  For, as the circle waxes great,  The power his word shall wield increases.  Come, then, and let us now a model see,  Let Phantasy with all her various choir,  Sense, reason, passion, sensibility,  But, mark me, folly too! the scene inspire.    _Manager_. But the great point is action! Every one  Comes as spectator, and the show's the fun.  Let but the plot be spun off fast and thickly,  So that the crowd shall gape in broad surprise,  Then have you made a wide impression quickly,  You are the man they'll idolize.  The mass can only be impressed by masses;  Then each at last picks out his proper part.  Give much, and then to each one something passes,  And each one leaves the house with happy heart.  Have you a piece, give it at once in pieces!  Such a ragout your fame increases;  It costs as little pains to play as to invent.  But what is gained, if you a whole present?  Your public picks it presently to pieces.    _Poet_. You do not feel how mean a trade like that must be!  In the true Artist's eyes how false and hollow!  Our genteel botchers, well I see,  Have given the maxims that you follow.    _Manager_. Such charges pass me like the idle wind;  A man who has right work in mind  Must choose the instruments most fitting.  Consider what soft wood you have for splitting,  And keep in view for whom you write!  If this one from _ennui_ seeks flight,  That other comes full from the groaning table,  Or, the worst case of all to cite,  From reading journals is for thought unable.  Vacant and giddy, all agog for wonder,  As to a masquerade they wing their way;  The ladies give themselves and all their precious plunder  And without wages help us play.  On your poetic heights what dream comes o'er you?  What glads a crowded house? Behold  Your patrons in array before you!  One half are raw, the other cold.  One, after this play, hopes to play at cards,  One a wild night to spend beside his doxy chooses,  Poor fools, why court ye the regards,  For such a set, of the chaste muses?  I tell you, give them more and ever more and more,  And then your mark you'll hardly stray from ever;  To mystify be your endeavor,  To satisfy is labor sore....  What ails you? Are you pleased or pained? What notion----    _Poet_. Go to, and find thyself another slave!  What! and the lofty birthright Nature gave,  The noblest talent Heaven to man has lent,  Thou bid'st the Poet fling to folly's ocean!  How does he stir each deep emotion?  How does he conquer every element?  But by the tide of song that from his bosom springs,  And draws into his heart all living things?  When Nature's hand, in endless iteration,  The thread across the whizzing spindle flings,  When the complex, monotonous creation  Jangles with all its million strings:  Who, then, the long, dull series animating,  Breaks into rhythmic march the soulless round?  And, to the law of All each member consecrating,  Bids one majestic harmony resound?  Who bids the tempest rage with passion's power?  The earnest soul with evening-redness glow?  Who scatters vernal bud and summer flower  Along the path where loved ones go?  Who weaves each green leaf in the wind that trembles  To form the wreath that merit's brow shall crown?  Who makes Olympus fast? the gods assembles?  The power of manhood in the Poet shown.    _Merry Person_. Come, then, put forth these noble powers,  And, Poet, let thy path of flowers  Follow a love-adventure's winding ways.  One comes and sees by chance, one burns, one stays,  And feels the gradual, sweet entangling!  The pleasure grows, then comes a sudden jangling,  Then rapture, then distress an arrow plants,  And ere one dreams of it, lo! _there_ is a romance.  Give us a drama in this fashion!  Plunge into human life's full sea of passion!  Each lives it, few its meaning ever guessed,  Touch where you will, 'tis full of interest.  Bright shadows fleeting o'er a mirror,  A spark of truth and clouds of error,  By means like these a drink is brewed  To cheer and edify the multitude.  The fairest flower of the youth sit listening  Before your play, and wait the revelation;  Each melancholy heart, with soft eyes glistening,  Draws sad, sweet nourishment from your creation;  This passion now, now that is stirred, by turns,  And each one sees what in his bosom burns.  Open alike, as yet, to weeping and to laughter,  They still admire the flights, they still enjoy the show;  Him who is formed, can nothing suit thereafter;  The yet unformed with thanks will ever glow.    _Poet_. Ay, give me back the joyous hours,  When I myself was ripening, too,  When song, the fount, flung up its showers  Of beauty ever fresh and new.  When a soft haze the world was veiling,  Each bud a miracle bespoke,  And from their stems a thousand flowers I broke,  Their fragrance through the vales exhaling.  I nothing and yet all possessed,  Yearning for truth and in illusion blest.  Give me the freedom of that hour,  The tear of joy, the pleasing pain,  Of hate and love the thrilling power,  Oh, give me back my youth again!    _Merry Person_. Youth, my good friend, thou needest certainly  When ambushed foes are on thee springing,  When loveliest maidens witchingly  Their white arms round thy neck are flinging,  When the far garland meets thy glance,  High on the race-ground's goal suspended,  When after many a mazy dance  In drink and song the night is ended.  But with a free and graceful soul  To strike the old familiar lyre,  And to a self-appointed goal  Sweep lightly o'er the trembling wire,  There lies, old gentlemen, to-day  Your task; fear not, no vulgar error blinds us.  Age does not make us childish, as they say,  But we are still true children when it finds us.    _Manager_. Come, words enough you two have bandied,  Now let us see some deeds at last;  While you toss compliments full-handed,  The time for useful work flies fast.  Why talk of being in the humor?  Who hesitates will never be.  If you are poets (so says rumor)  Now then command your poetry.  You know full well our need and pleasure,  We want strong drink in brimming measure;  Brew at it now without delay!  To-morrow will not do what is not done to-day.  Let not a day be lost in dallying,  But seize the possibility  Right by the forelock, courage rallying,  And forth with fearless spirit sallying,--  Once in the yoke and you are free.    Upon our German boards, you know it,  What any one would try, he may;  Then stint me not, I beg, to-day,  In scenery or machinery, Poet.  With great and lesser heavenly lights make free,  Spend starlight just as you desire;  No want of water, rocks or fire  Or birds or beasts to you shall be.  So, in this narrow wooden house's bound,  Stride through the whole creation's round,  And with considerate swiftness wander  From heaven, through this world, to the world down yonder.              PROLOGUE          IN HEAVEN.      [THE LORD. THE HEAVENLY HOSTS _afterward_ MEPHISTOPHELES.  _The three archangels_, RAPHAEL, GABRIEL, _and_ MICHAEL, _come forward_.]    _Raphael_. The sun, in ancient wise, is sounding,    With brother-spheres, in rival song;  And, his appointed journey rounding,    With thunderous movement rolls along.  His look, new strength to angels lending,    No creature fathom can for aye;  The lofty works, past comprehending,    Stand lordly, as on time's first day.    _Gabriel_. And swift, with wondrous swiftness fleeting,    The pomp of earth turns round and round,  The glow of Eden alternating    With shuddering midnight's gloom profound;  Up o'er the rocks the foaming ocean    Heaves from its old, primeval bed,  And rocks and seas, with endless motion,    On in the spheral sweep are sped.    _Michael_. And tempests roar, glad warfare waging,    From sea to land, from land to sea,  And bind round all, amidst their raging,    A chain of giant energy.  There, lurid desolation, blazing,    Foreruns the volleyed thunder's way:  Yet, Lord, thy messengers[2] are praising    The mild procession of thy day.    _All Three_. The sight new strength to angels lendeth,    For none thy being fathom may,  The works, no angel comprehendeth,    Stand lordly as on time's first day.    _Mephistopheles_. Since, Lord, thou drawest near us once again,  And how we do, dost graciously inquire,  And to be pleased to see me once didst deign,  I too among thy household venture nigher.  Pardon, high words I cannot labor after,  Though the whole court should look on me with scorn;  My pathos certainly would stir thy laughter,  Hadst thou not laughter long since quite forsworn.  Of sun and worlds I've nought to tell worth mention,  How men torment themselves takes my attention.  The little God o' the world jogs on the same old way  And is as singular as on the world's first day.  A pity 'tis thou shouldst have given  The fool, to make him worse, a gleam of light from heaven;  He calls it reason, using it  To be more beast than ever beast was yet.  He seems to me, (your grace the word will pardon,)  Like a long-legg'd grasshopper in the garden,  Forever on the wing, and hops and sings  The same old song, as in the grass he springs;  Would he but stay there! no; he needs must muddle  His prying nose in every puddle.    _The Lord_. Hast nothing for our edification?  Still thy old work of accusation?  "]]]
