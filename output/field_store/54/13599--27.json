Odin  therefore meets with a harsh reception, and is bound between two fires  in the hall. Geirroed's young son, Agnar, protests against this rude  treatment, and gives wine to the guest, who then begins to instruct  him in matters concerning the Gods. He names the halls of the Aesir,  describes Valhalla and the ash Yggdrasil, the Valkyries, the creation  of the world (two stanzas in common with _Vafthrudnismal_), and  enumerates his own names. The poem ends with impressive abruptness  by his turning to Geirroed:    \"Thou art drunk, Geirroed, thou hast drunk too deep; thou art bereft  of much since thou hast lost my favour, the favour of Odin and all  the Einherjar. I have told thee much, but thou hast minded little. Thy  friends betray thee: I see my friend's sword lie drenched in blood. Now  shall Odin have the sword-weary slain; I know thy life is ended,  the Fates are ungracious. Now thou canst see Odin: come near me,  if thou canst.\"    [Prose.] \"King Geirroed sat with his sword on his knee, half drawn. When  he heard that Odin was there, he stood up and would have led Odin  from the fires. The sword slipt from his hand; the hilt turned  downwards. The king caught his foot and fell forwards, the sword  standing towards him, and so he met his death. Then Odin went away,  and Agnar was king there long afterwards.\"    _Harbardsljod_ is a dialogue, and humorous. Thor on his return from  the east comes to a channel, at the farther side of which stands Odin,  disguised as a ferryman, Greybeard. He refuses to ferry Thor across,  and they question each other as to their past feats, with occasional  threats from Thor and taunts from Odin, until the former goes off  vowing vengeance on the ferryman:    _Thor_. \"Thy skill in words would serve thee ill if I waded across  the water; I think thou wouldst cry louder than the wolf, if thou  shouldst get a blow from the hammer.\"    _Odin_. \"Sif has a lover at home, thou shouldst seek him. That is a  task for thee to try, it is more proper for thee.\"    _Thor_. \"Thou speakest what thou knowest most displeasing to me;  thou cowardly fellow, I think that thou liest.\"    _Odin_. \"I think I speak true; thou art slow on the road. Thou wouldst  have got far, if thou hadst started at dawn.\"    _Thor_. \"Harbard, scoundrel, it is rather thou who hast delayed me.\"    _Odin_. \"I never thought a shepherd could so delay Asa-Thor's journey.\"    _Thor_. \"I will counsel thee: row thy boat hither. Let us cease  quarrelling; come and meet Magni's father.\"    _Odin_. \"Leave thou the river; crossing shall be refused thee.\"    _Thor_. \"Show me the way, since thou wilt not ferry me.\"    _Odin_. \"That is a small thing to refuse. It is a long way to go: a  while to the stock, and another to the stone, then keep to the left  hand till thou reach Verland. There will Fjoergyn meet her son Thor,  and she will tell him the highway to Odin's land.\"    _Thor_. \"Shall I get there to-day?\"    _Odin_. \"With toil and trouble thou wilt get there about sunrise,  as I think.\"    _Thor_. \"Our talk shall be short, since thou answerest with mockery. I  will reward thee for refusing passage, if we two meet again.\"    _Odin_. \"Go thy way, where all the fiends may take thee.\"    _Lokasenna_ also is in dialogue form. A prose introduction tells  how the giant Oegi, or Gymi, gave a feast to the Aesir. Loki was  turned out for killing a servant, but presently returned and began to  revile the Gods and Goddesses, each one in turn trying to interfere,  only to provoke a taunt from Loki. At last Thor, who had been absent  on a journey, came in and threatened the slanderer with his hammer,  whereupon Loki said, \"I spoke to the Aesir and the sons of the Aesir  what my mind told me; but for thee alone I will go away, for I know  thou wilt strike.\" Some of the poem is rather pointless abuse, but  much touches points already suggested in the other poems.    _Hyndluljod_ is much later than the others, probably  not before  1200. The style is late, and the form imitated from _Voeluspa_. It  describes a visit paid by Freyja to the Sibyl to learn the genealogy of  her favourite Ottar. The larger part deals with heroic genealogies, but  there are scanty allusions to Baldr, Frey, Heimdal, Loki's children,  and Thor, and a Christian reference to a God who shall come after  Ragnaroek \"when Odin shall meet the wolf.\" It tells nothing new.    We have here then, omitting _Hyndluljod_, five poems (four of them  belonging to the first half of the tenth century) which suggest a  general outline of Norse mythology: there is a hierarchy of Gods, the  Aesir, who live together in a citadel, Odin being the chief. Among  them are several who are not Aesir by origin: Njoerd and his son and  daughter, Frey and Freyja, are Vanir; Loki is really an enemy and  an agent in their fall; and there are one or two Goddesses of giant  race. The giants are rivals and enemies to the Gods; the dwarfs are  also antagonistic, but in bondage. The meeting-place of the Gods is  by the World-Ash, Yggdrasil, on whose well-being the fate of Gods  and men depends; at its root lies the World-Snake. The Gods have  foreknowledge of their own doom, Ragnaroek, the great fight when they  shall meet Loki's children, the Wolf and the Snake; both sides will  fall and the world be destroyed. An episode in the story is the death  of Baldr. This we may assume to be the religion of the Viking age  (800-1000 A.D.), a compound of the beliefs of various ages and tribes.    _The Aesir._--The number of the Aesir is not fixed. _Hyndluljod_  says there were twelve (\"there were eleven Aesir when Baldr went  down into the howe\"). Snorri gives a list of fourteen Aesir or Gods  (Odin, Thor, Baldr, Njoerd, Frey, Tyr, Bragi, Heimdal, Hoed, Vidar, Vali,  Ullr, Forseti, Loki), and adds Hoeni in another list, all the fifteen  occurring in the poems; and sixteen Goddesses (Asynjor), the majority  of whom are merely personified epithets, occurring nowhere else. Of  the sixteen, Frigg, Gefion, Freyja and Saga (really an epithet only)  are Goddesses in the poems, and Fulla is Frigg's handmaid. In another  chapter, Snorri adds Idunn, Gerd, Sigyn and Nanna, of whom the latter  does not appear in the Elder Edda, where Idunn, Gerd (a giantess)  and Sigyn are the wives of Bragi, Frey and Loki; and two others,  the giantess Skadi and Sif, are the wives of Njoerd and Thor.    A striking difference from classical mythology is that neither Tyr  (who should etymologically be the Sky-god), nor Thor (the Thunder-god),  takes the highest place. Tyr is the hero of one important episode,  the chaining of the Wolf, through which he loses his right hand. This  is told in full by Snorri and alluded to in _Lokasenna_, both in the  prose preface (\"Tyr also was there, with only one hand; the Fenris-wolf  had bitten off the other, when he was bound\") and in the poem itself:    _Loki_. \"I must remember that right hand which Fenri bit off thee.\"    _Tyr_. \"I am short of a hand, but thou of the famous wolf; to each  the loss is ill-luck. Nor is the wolf in better plight, for he must  wait in bonds till Ragnaroek.\"    Otherwise, he only appears in connexion with two more popular Gods:  he speaks in Frey's defence in _Lokasenna_, and in _Hymiskvida_ he  is Thor's companion in the search for a cauldron; the latter poem  represents him as a giant's son.    Thor, on the other hand, is second only to his father Odin; he is  the strongest of the Gods and their champion against the giants,  and his antagonist at Ragnaroek is to be the World-Snake. Like Odin,  he travels much, but while the chief God generally goes craftily and  in disguise, to gain knowledge or test his wisdom, Thor's errands are  warlike; in _Lokasenna_ he is absent on a journey, in _Harbardsljod_  and _Alvissmal_ he is returning from one. His journeys are always  to the east; so in _Harbardsljod_: \"I was in the east, fighting  the malevolent giant-brides.... I was in the east and guarding the  river, when Svarang's sons attacked me.\" The Giants live in the  east (_Hymiskvida_ 5); Thor threatened Loki: \"I will fling thee up  into the east, and no one shall see thee more\" (_Lokasenna_ 59);  the fire-giants at Ragnaroek are to come from the east: \"Hrym comes  driving from the east, he lifts his shield before him.... A ship  comes from the east, Muspell's sons will come sailing over the  sea, and Loki steers\" (_Voeluspa_ 50, 51). It would not, perhaps,  be overstraining the point to suggest that this is a reminiscence of  early warfare between the Scandinavians and eastern nations, either  Lapps and Finns or Slavonic tribes.    Thor is the God of natural force, the son of Earth. Two of the  episodical poems deal with his contests with the giants. _Thrymskvida_,  the story of how Thor won back his hammer, Mjoellni, from the giant  Thrym, is the finest and one of the oldest of the mythological poems;  a translation is given in the appendix, as an example of Eddic poetry  at its best. Loki appears as the willing helper of the Gods, and Thor's  companion. The Thunderer's journey with Tyr in quest of a cauldron  is related with much humour in _Hymiskvida_: Hymi's beautiful wife,  who helps her guests to outwit her husband, is a figure familiar in  fairy-tales as the Ogre's wife.    The chief God of the Scandinavians is, it must be confessed, an  unsympathetic character. He is the head of the Valhalla system;  he is Val-father (Father of the Slain), and the Valkyries are his  \"Wishmaidens,\" as the Einherjar are his \"Wishsons.\" He naturally takes  a special interest in mortal heroes, from whom come the chosen hosts  of Valhalla. But, in spite of the splendour of his surroundings, he  is wanting in dignity. The chief of the Gods has neither the might and  unthinking valour of Thor, nor the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13008"],[0,"The Edda, Volume 2 (#2)"],[1,"  of faith to Brynhild. In the speeches of both Gripi and Sigurd, the  poet shows clearly that Brynhild had the first right to Sigurd's faith,  while the seer repeatedly protests his innocence in breaking it: \"Thou  shalt never be blamed though thou didst betray the royal maid.... No  better man shall come on earth beneath the sun than thou, Sigurd.\" On  the other hand, the poet gives no indication that Brynhild and the  sleeping Valkyrie are the same, which is a sign of confusion. Like  all poems in this form, _Gripisspa_ is a late composition embodying  earlier tradition.    The other poems are mostly episodical, though arranged so as to form  a continued narrative. _Gripisspa_ is followed by a compilation from  two or more poems in different metres, generally divided into three  parts in the editions: _Reginsmal_ gives the early history of the  treasure and the dragon, and Sigurd's battle with Hunding's sons;  _Fafnismal_, the slaying of the dragon and the advice of the talking  birds; _Sigrdrifumal_, the awakening of the Valkyrie. Then follows  a fragment on the death of Sigurd. All the rest, except the poem  generally called the _Third_, or _Short, Sigurd Lay_ (which tells of  the marriage with Gudrun and Sigurd's wooing of Brynhild for Gunnar)  continue the story after Sigurd's death, taking up the death of  Brynhild, Gudrun's mourning, and the fates of the other heroes who  became connected with the legend of the treasure.    In addition to the poems in the Elder Edda, an account of the story  is given by Snorri in _Skaldskaparmal_, but it is founded almost  entirely on the surviving lays. _Voelsunga Saga_ is also a paraphrase,  but more valuable, since parts of it are founded on lost poems, and  it therefore, to some extent, represents independent tradition. It  was, unfortunately from a literary point of view, compiled after the  great saga-time was over, in the decadent fourteenth century, when  material of all kinds, classical, biblical, romantic, mythological,  was hastily cast into saga-form. It is not, like the _Nibelungen  Lied_, a work of art, but it has what in this case is perhaps of  greater importance, the one great virtue of fidelity. The compiler  did not, like the author of the German masterpiece, boldly recast  his material in the spirit of his own time; he clung closely to his  originals, only trying with hesitating hand to copy the favourite  literary form of the Icelander. As a saga, therefore, _Voelsunga_  is far behind not only such great works as _Njala_, but also many of  the smaller sagas. It lacks form, and is marred by inconsistencies;  it is often careless in grammar and diction; it is full of traces  of the decadent romantic age. Sigurd, in the true spirit of romance,  is endowed with magic weapons and supernatural powers, which are no  improvement on the heroic tradition, \"Courage is better than a good  sword.\" At every turn, Odin is at hand to help him, which tends to  efface the older and truer picture of the hero with all the fates  against him; such heroes, found again and again in the historic  sagas, more truly represent the heathen heroic age and that belief  in the selfishness and caprice of the Gods on which the whole idea  of sacrifice rests. There is also the inevitable deterioration in the  character of Brynhild, without the compensating elevation in that of  her rival by which the _Nibelungen Lied_ places Chriemhild on a height  as lofty and unapproachable as that occupied by the Norse Valkyrie;  the Brynhild of _Voelsunga Saga_ is something of a virago, the Gudrun  is jealous and shrewish. But for actual material, the compiler is  absolutely to be trusted; and _Voelsunga Saga_ is therefore, in spite  of artistic faults, a priceless treasure-house for the real features  of the legend.    There are two main elements in the Volsung story: the slaying of the  dragon, and the awakening and desertion of Brynhild. The latter is  brought into close connexion with the former, which becomes the real  centre of the action. In the Anglo-Saxon reference, the fragment in  _Beowulf_, the second episode does not appear.    In this, the oldest version of the story, which, except for a vague  reference to early feats by Sigmund and Sinfjoetli, consists solely  of the dragon adventure, the hero is not Sigurd, but Sigemund the  Waelsing. All that it tells is that Sigemund, Fitela (Sinfjoetli)  not being with him, killed the dragon, the guardian of the hoard, and  loaded a ship with the treasure. The few preceding lines only mention  the war which Sigmund and Sinfjoetli waged on their foes. They are there  uncle and nephew, and there is no suggestion of the closer relationship  assigned to them by _Voelsunga Saga_, which tells their story in full.    Sigmund, one of the ten sons of Volsung (who is himself of  miraculous birth) and the Wishmaiden Hlod, is one of the chosen  heroes of Odin. His twin-sister Signy is married against her will to  Siggeir, an hereditary enemy, and at the wedding-feast Odin enters  and thrusts a sword up to the hilt into the tree growing in the  middle of the hall. All try to draw it, but only the chosen Sigmund  succeeds. Siggeir, on returning to his own home with his unwilling  bride, invites her father and brothers to a feast. Though suspecting  treachery, they come, and are killed one after another, except Sigmund  who is secretly saved by his sister and hidden in the wood. She  meditates revenge, and as her two sons grow up to the age of ten,  she tests their courage, and finding it wanting makes Sigmund kill  both: the expected hero must be a Volsung through both parents. She  therefore visits Sigmund in disguise, and her third son, Sinfjoetli,  is the child of the Volsung pair. At ten years old, she sends him to  live in the wood with Sigmund, who only knows him as Signy's son. For  years they live as wer-wolves in the wood, till the time comes for  vengeance. They set fire to Siggeir's hall; and Signy, after revealing  Sinfjoetli's real parentage, goes back into the fire and dies there,  her vengeance achieved:    \"I killed my children, because I thought them too weak to avenge our  father; Sinfjoetli has a warrior's might because he is both son's son  and daughter's son to King Volsung. I have laboured to this end,  that King Siggeir should meet his death; I have so toiled for the  achieving of revenge that I am now on no condition fit for life. As  I lived by force with King Siggeir, of free will shall I die with him.\"    Though no poem survives on this subject, the story is certainly  primitive; its savage character vouches for its antiquity. _Voelsunga_  then reproduces the substance of the prose _Death of Sinfjoetli_  mentioned above, the object of which, as a part of the cycle, seems  to be to remove Sinfjoetli and leave the field clear for Sigurd. It  preserves a touch which may be original in Sinfjoetli's burial, which  resembles that of Scyld in _Beowulf_: his father lays him in a boat  steered by an old man, which immediately disappears.    Sigmund and Sinfjoetli are always close comrades, \"need-companions\"  as the Anglo-Saxon calls them. They are indivisible and form one  story. Sigurd, on the other hand, is only born after his father  Sigmund's death. _Voelsunga_ says that Sigmund fell in battle against  Hunding, through the interference of Odin, who, justifying Loki's taunt  that he \"knew not how to give the victory fairly,\" shattered with his  spear the sword he had given to the Volsung. For this again we have  to depend entirely on the prose, except for one line in _Hyndluljod_:  \"The Father of Hosts gives gold to his followers;... he gave Sigmund  a sword.\" And from the poems too, Sigurd's fatherless childhood is  only to be inferred from an isolated reference, where giving himself  a false name he says to Fafni: \"I came a motherless child; I have no  father like the sons of men.\" Sigmund, dying, left the fragments of  the sword to be given to his unborn son, and Sigurd's fosterfather  Regin forged them anew for the future dragon-slayer. But Sigurd's  first deed was to avenge on Hunding's race the death of his father  and his mother's father. _Voelsunga_ tells this story first of Helgi  and Sinfjoetli, then of Sigurd, to whom the poems also attribute the  deed. It is followed by the dragon-slaying.    Up to this point, the story of Sigurd consists roughly of the same  features which mark that of Sigmund and Sinfjoetli. Both are probably,  like Helgi, versions of a race-hero myth. In each case there is  the usual irregular birth, in different forms, both familiar; a  third type, the miraculous or supernatural birth, is attributed by  _Voelsunga_ to Sigmund's father Volsung. Each story again includes  a deed of vengeance, and a dragon and treasure. The sword which the  hero alone could draw, and the wer-wolf, appear only in the Sigmund  and Sinfjoetli version. Among those Germanic races which brought the  legend to full perfection, Sigurd's version soon became the sole one,  and Sigmund and Sinfjoetli practically drop out.    The Dragon legend of the Edda is much fuller and more elaborate than  that of any other mythology. As a rule tradition is satisfied with  the existence of the monster \"old and proud of his treasure,\" but  here we are told its full previous history, certain features of which  (such as the shape-shifting) are signs of antiquity, whether it was  originally connected with the Volsungs or not.    As usual, _Voelsunga_ gives the fullest account, in the form of a  story told by Regin to his foster-son Sigurd, to incite him to slay  the dragon. Regin was one of three brothers, the sons of Hreidmar;  one of the three, Otr, while in the water in otter's shape, was seen by  three of the Aesir, Odin, Loki and Hoeni, and killed by Loki. Hreidmar  demanded as wergild enough gold to fill the otter's skin, and Loki  obtained it by catching the dwarf Andvari, who lived in a waterfall  in the form of a fish, and allowing him"]]]
