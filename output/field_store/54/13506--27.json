An enlargement from a drawing by Walter Crane was shown as illustrating  the principles of artistic and natural costume--costume which permitted  the waist to be the normal size, and allowed the drapery to fall in  natural folds--costume which knew nothing of pleats and flounces, stays  and \"improvers\"--costume which was very symbolization and embodiment of  womanly grace and modesty.    A life-sized enlargement of a fashion plate from _Myra's Journal_, dated  June 1, 1882, was next shown. The circumference of the waist was but 123/4  in., involving an utter exclusion of the liver from that part of the  organization, and the attitude was worthy of a costume which was the _ne  plus ultra_ of formal ugliness.    Having shown another and equally unbecoming costume, selected from a  recent issue by an Oxford Street firm, the lecturer asked, Why did women  think small waists beautiful? Was it because big-waisted women were so  frequently fat and forty, old and ugly? A young girl had no waist, and  did not need stays. As the figure matured the hips developed, and it was  this development which formed the waist. The slightest artificial  compression of the waist destroyed the line of beauty. Therefore, the  grown woman should never wear stays, and, since they tended to weaken  the muscles of the back, the aged and weak should not adopt them. A  waist really too large was less ungraceful than a waist too small. Dress  was designed partly for warmth and partly for adornment. As the uses  were distinct, the garments should be so. A close-fitting inner garment  should supply all requisite warmth, and the outer dress should be as  thin as possible, that it might drape itself into natural folds. Velvet,  from its texture, was ill adapted for this. When worn, it should be in  close fitting garments, and in dark colors only. It was most effective  when black.    Turning for a few moments, in conclusion, to men's attire, the lecturer  suggested that the ill-success of dress reformers hitherto had been the  too-radical changes they sought to introduce. We could be artistic  without being archaic. Most men were satisfied without clothes fairly in  fashion, a tolerable fit, and any unobtrusive color their tailor  pleased. He would suggest that any reformation should begin with color.           *       *       *       *       *          ARTISANS' DWELLINGS, HORNSEY.      The erection of artisans' dwellings is certainly a prominent feature in  the progress of building in the metropolis, and speculative builders who  work on a smaller scale would do well not to ignore the fact. The  Artisans, Laborers, and General Dwellings Company (Limited) has been  conspicuously successful in rearing large blocks of dwellings for  artisans, clerks, and others whose means necessitates the renting of a  convenient house at as low a rental as it is possible to find it. We  give an illustration of a terrace of first-class houses built by the  above company, who deserve great praise for the spirited and liberal  manner in which they are going to work on this the third of their London  estates--the Noel Park Estate, at Hornsey. On the estates at Shaftesbury  and Queen's Parks they have already built about three thousand houses,  employing therein a capital of considerably over a million sterling,  while at Noel Park they are rapidly covering an estate of one hundred  acres, which will contain, when completed, no less than two thousand six  hundred houses, to be let at weekly rentals varying from 6s. to 11s.  6d., rates and taxes all included. The object has been to provide  separate cottages, each in itself complete, and in so doing they have  not made any marked departure from the ordinary type of suburban terrace  plan, but adopting this as most favorable to economy, have added many  improvements, including sanitary appliances of the latest and most  approved type.    The most important entrance to Noel Park is by Gladstone Avenue, a road  60 ft. wide leading from the Green Lanes to the center of the estate. On  either side of this road the houses are set back 15 ft., in front of  which, along the edge of the pavement, trees of a suitable growth are  being planted, as also on all other roads on the estate. About the  center of Gladstone Avenue an oval space has been reserved as a site for  a church, and a space of five acres in another portion of the estate has  been set apart to be laid out as a recreation ground, should the  development of the estate warrant such an outlay. The remaining streets  are from 40 ft. to 50 ft. in width, clear of the garden space in front  of the houses. Shops will be erected as may be required.    [Illustration: SUGGESTIONS IN ARCHITECTURE.--A ROW OF COMFORTABLE  DWELLINGS.]    The drainage of the estate has been arranged on the dual system, the  surface water being kept separate from the sewage drains. Nowhere have  these drains been carried through the houses, but they are taken  directly into drains at the back, having specially ventilated manholes  and being brought through at the ends of terraces into the road sewers;  the ventilating openings in the roads have been converted into inlet  ventilators by placing upcast shafts at short intervals, discharging  above the houses. This system of ventilation was adopted on the  recommendation of Mr. W.A. De Pape, the engineer and surveyor to the  Tottenham Local Board.    All the houses are constructed with a layer of concrete over the whole  area of the site, and a portion of the garden at back. Every room is  specially ventilated, and all party walls are hollow in order to prevent  the passage of sound. A constant water supply is laid on, there being no  cisterns but those to the water-waste preventers to closets. All water  pipes discharge over open trapped gullies outside.    The materials used are red and yellow bricks, with terracotta sills, the  roofs being slated over the greater part, and for the purpose of forming  an agreeable relief, the end houses, and in some cases the central  houses, have red tile roofs, the roofs over porches being similarly  treated. The houses are simply but effectively designed, and the general  appearance of the finished portion of the estate is bright and cheerful.  All end houses of terraces have been specially treated, and in some  cases having rather more accommodation than houses immediately  adjoining, a slightly increased rental is required. There are five  different classes of houses. The first class houses (which we illustrate  this week) are built on plats having 16 ft. frontage by 85 ft. depth,  and containing eight rooms, consisting of two sitting rooms, kitchen,  scullery, with washing copper, coal cellar, larder, and water-closet on  ground floor, and four bedrooms over. The water-closet is entered from  the outside, but in many first-class houses another water-closet has  been provided on the first floor, and one room on this floor is provided  with a small range, so that if two families live in the one house they  will be entirely separated. The rental of these houses is about 11s. to  11s. 6d. per week.

By A. GOODALL.    [Footnote: Read before the Dundee and East of Scotland Photographic  Association.]      The process of making gelatino bromide of silver prints or enlargements  on paper or opal has been before the public for two or three years now,  and cannot be called new; but still it is neither so well known nor  understood as such a facile and easy process deserves to be, and I may  just say here that after a pretty extensive experience in the working of  it I believe there is no other enlarging process capable of giving  better results than can be got by this process when properly understood  and wrought, as the results that can be got by it are certainly equal to  those obtainable by any other method, while the ease and rapidity with  which enlarged pictures can be made by it place it decidedly ahead of  any other method. I propose to show you how I make a gelatino bromide  enlargement on opal.    [Mr. Goodall then proceeded to make an enlargement on a 12 by 10 opal,  using a sciopticon burning paraffin; after an exposure for two and  a-half minutes the developer was applied, and a brilliant opal was the  result.]    We now come to the paper process, and most effective enlargements can be  made by it also; indeed, as a basis for coloring, nothing could well be  better. Artists all over the country have told me that after a few  trials they prefer it to anything else, while excellent and effective  plain enlargements are easily made by it if only carefully handled. A  very good enlargement is made by vignetting the picture, as I have just  done, with the opal, and then squeezing it down on a clean glass, and  afterward framing it with another glass in front, when it will have the  appearance almost equal to an opal. To make sure of the picture adhering  to the glass, however, and at the same time to give greater brilliancy,  it is better to flow the glass with a 10 or 15 grain solution of clear  gelatine before squeezing it down. The one fault or shortcoming of the  plain argentic paper is the dullness of the surface when dry, and this  certainly makes it unsuitable for small work, such as the rapid  production of cartes or proofs from negatives wanted in a hurry; the  tone of an argentic print is also spoken of sometimes as being  objectionable; but my impression is, that it is not so much the tone as  the want of brilliancy that is the fault there, and if once the public  were accustomed to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11348"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 13, No. 368, May 2, (#2)"],[1,"mingled yarn of his existence--and 313 such sheets, or 1,252 such  folios make but a year of his history. The subject is too vast and  comprehensive for continued contemplation, for it is like all other  wheels of vicissitude; we become giddy by looking too steadfastly on  its twinings.    Let us take one side of any recent _Times _newspaper--say that of  _Thursday last_--and attempt something like an abstract of its  _memorabilia_. This may appear for us a toilsome task, but if the  reader be not fatigued also, our time will not be misspent. Begin \"at  the beginning\" with the old English title, broken by the royal  arms--like a blocking-course; and the No. and date in a sort of  typographical entablature. The first side is filled by 188  advertisements, for the most part, classed according to their objects.    Thus, we start, and not unappropriately, with notices of vessels _to  sail_ for India and the new settlement on _Swan River_. What  temptations for adventure and avarice--what associations of industry  and indolence--luxury and squalid misery--do these announcements  create in the reflective mind. The nabob in his chintz--the speculator  with his last hundred--and the half-starved agriculturist--are but  sorry portraits beside the class to whom the next notice is  addressed.--Packets to Calais, Dieppe, and Margate--necessity on her  last leg, and luxury on the fantastic toe--the wasted mind and  famished visage beside hoyden mirth and bloated luxury. Then the South  American Mining Association Deed \"lies for signature:\"--what a relief  in this sheet of _chiaro-scuro_--a kind of tinsel to set off its grave  parts, with gold dust enough to blind half its readers. To this little  flash of golden light succeeds shade--Chancery and creditors'  notices--proving debts and consciences--followed by civil contracts  for Bridewell and building a Lunatic Asylum in Kent. The association  is too obvious, and verily, the maker-up of the Times newspaper is a  Hogarth in his way; for what Hogarth did with pencil and brush, he  does with metallic types. Next is a Saw Mill to be sold cheap,  constructed for the express purpose of being sent to the Swan River  settlement--how fortunate--for surely any idle wight would make his  way with such assistance, especially as the machine is \"on improved  principles.\" _Luxury_ again--paper-hangings, French lamps, and French  roses--_necessity_ again--Money on mortgage, and bills discounted: how  obvious the connexion--the very cause and effect--the lamps will not  burn without oil, and the roses will not bloom without money--at least  they will only waste their fragrance in the desert air of the  nursery-ground.    The _second column_ begins with a solicitor's inquiry for a person  long unheard of, who, if alive, \"may hear of somewhat very  considerably to his advantage\"--any person proving his death, shall be  rewarded. Next is a notice from the City Chamber Court of Stralsund,  of a man who has been missing twenty years, and unless he informs the  court of his existence on or before Lady-day, 1830, he will be  declared dead--poor fellow--yet how many would rejoice at such an  opportunity of escaping from their worldly cares. Next comes a little  string of Anniversaries of Charities--followed by Exhibitions of the  Fine Arts--had their position been reversed, the effect would have  been better; for fine painting prepares the heart for acts of  benevolence, and kindleth all its best feelings. Portraits of the Rev.  Matthew Wilks and Pope Pius VII. (the latter a splendid mezzotinto  from Sir T. Lawrence's picture) are followed by a \"_Speaking_ French  Grammar,\" a very good companion for any Englishman about to visit the  continent; for with many, their stock of French does not last out  their cash. Next is fourteen years of the Morning Post to be sold--a  bargain for a fashionable novelist, and in fact, a complete  stock-in-trade for any court or town Adonis; a perfect vocabulary of  fashion, detailing the rise and progress of all the fashionable arts  since the peace--the gazette appointments and disappointments--and  elopements and _faux pas_, sufficient for all the comedy-writers of  the present century--the respective claims of Spanish Refugees and  Spitalfields Weavers--charitable concerts and opera benefits--and all  the lumber and light artillery of the _grand monde_.    The _third column_ is almost entirely occupied by \"Wanted\"  advertisements and we had resolved to pass over all their \"Wants;\" had  not some of them occurred to us as rather singular, even in these  times of general distress. The first of these is for a respectable  middle-aged woman, as lady's maid--\"to understand dress-making,  millinery, hair-dressing, getting-up fine linen, and to be useful and  obliging.\" All this is reasonable enough; but mark the inducement: \"a  clever person fond of the country, and who can bear confinement, will  find this a comfortable situation!\" \"This is too much.\" Another is for  a butler and a valet, to \"undertake the care and responsibility of a  numerous family:\" another is a young man for \"a situation in any shop  or warehouse, not particular what:\" another of \"a nurse, who can cut  and make children's dresses, and instruct them in reading and  spelling;\" a school-assistant \"to fill the second desk,\" &c. Next come  a few characteristics of a scientific age--as patent trouser-straps,  to \"prevent the dirt getting between the strap and the boot, &c.;\" and  patent springs for waistcoat backs--to cause the clothes to fit well  to the shape, &c.--and, above all, a legitimate, scientific _Diaphane_  parasol.    The \"Wants\" are resumed in the _fourth column_. One is a young man to  be able to walk well; \"it is immaterial what he has been accustomed  to.\"    In the fourth column we find \"a family grave to be sold, unused for  nearly 50 years at that period, but partly occupied. _To save  trouble_, price 25_l_.\" Another advertisement--\"to small capitalists\"  is a perfect puzzle; for the advertiser will not describe the  \"ready-money concern\" to be disposed of, but says, \"the principal  article of sale is what is consumed, either in a greater or less  degree, by almost every individual.\" Next is a tallowchandler's  business in a situation which \"will command an extensive trade  immediately the new Fleet Market is erected\"--rather anticipatory, to  be sure. Another, \"worthy of notice,\" offers for 260 guineas, seven  houses, which cost 800 in building--a tolerable speculation.    The _last column_ commences with a fine brown gelding, (like most  friends) parted with for no fault, free from vice, although, \"a  _trial_ will be granted.\" Another announces for sale, several \"_bays_,  greys, roans, _creams_, and _duns_:\" a chaise \"parted with for no  other fault than the present owner having purchased a four-wheeled  one;\" and \"a house near the church, commanding extensive and pleasing  prospects.\"    The fourth folio, or side of the paper, is nearly filled with  advertisements of _sales by auction_, a single glance at which would  convince us of the instability of human affairs, even if we did not  read in one corner, of a theatrical wardrobe, containing five splendid  new court dresses, trimmed with gold and silver (except the pockets,)  and 52 very fine wigs.    The inner, or second and third folios of the paper, present still  finer studies for our reflection. The eye almost instinctively lights  on the \"Foreign Papers,\" detailing the progress of war and the balance  of power--Francfort Fair, and English manufactures. Below is the  well-known graphic relief--a clock, and two opened and one closed  book, with \"The Times\"--past and future, decorated with oak and  laurel. Then come the theatrical announcements teeming with novelty  and attraction, which stand like the sauces, savoury dishes, and  sweetmeats of the day's repast.

It would seem that among our Pagan ancestors, before the introduction  of Christianity, the _first day of May_ was the great festival in  honour of the sun, and that fires were then kindled and rejoicings  made, in honour of that great luminary. The first day of May is still  called _Beltan_, or _Baal-tein_, \"the fire of Baal.\" In some parts of  the country the shepherds still make festivals of milk and eggs on  that day, but the custom is rapidly declining. In the Highlands the  festival is still continued with singular ceremonies. On Beltan day  all the boys in a township or hamlet meet in the moors; they cut a  table in the green sod, of a round figure, by casting a trench in the  ground of such circumference as to hold the whole company; they kindle  a fire, and dress a meal of eggs and milk of the consistence of a  custard; and then knead a cake of oatmeal, which "]]]
