Both Demosthenes  and Aristotle (_Rhet._ iii. 4) speak favourably of his powers as an  orator. He is said to have gone into exile at Megara, and to have  composed an _Atthis_, or annalistic account of Attica from the  earliest times to his own days (Pausanias vi. 7; x. 8). It is disputed  whether the annalist and orator are identical, but an Androtion  who wrote on agriculture is certainly a different person. Professor  Gaetano de Sanctis (in _L'Attide di Androzione e un papiro  di Oxyrhynchos_, Turin, 1908) attributes to Androtion, the  atthidographer, a 4th-century historical fragment, discovered by  B.P. Grenfell and A.S. Hunt (_Oxyrhynchus Papyri_, vol. v.). Strong  arguments against this view are set forth by E.M. Walker in the  _Classical Review_, May 1908.

ANECDOTE (from [Greek: an]-, privative, and [Greek: ekdidomi], to give  out or publish), a word originally meaning something not published. It  has now two distinct significations. The primary one is something not  published, in which sense it has been used to denote either secret  histories--Procopius, _e.g._, gives this as one of the titles of his  secret history of Justinian's court--or portions of ancient writers  which have remained long in manuscript and are edited for the first  time. Of such _anecdota_ there are many collections; the earliest was  probably L.A. Muratori's, in 1709. In the more general and popular  acceptation of the word, however, anecdotes are short accounts of  detached interesting particulars. Of such anecdotes the collections  are almost infinite; the best in many respects is that compiled by  T. Byerley (d. 1826) and J. Clinton Robertson (d. 1852), known as the  _Percy Anecdotes_ (1820-1823).        ANEL, DOMINIQUE (1679-1730), French surgeon, was born at Toulouse  about 1679. After studying at Montpellier and Paris, he served as  surgeon-major in the French army in Alsace; then after two years at  Vienna he went to Italy and served in the Austrian army. In 1710 he  was teaching surgery in Rouen, whence he went to Genoa, and in 1716 he  was practising in Paris. He died about 1730. He was celebrated for his  successful surgical treatment of _fistula lacrymalis_, and while  at Genoa invented for use in connexion with the operation the  fine-pointed syringe still known by his name.        ANEMOMETER (from Gr. [Greek: anemos], wind, and [Greek: metron],  a measure), an instrument for measuring either the velocity or the  pressure of the wind. Anemometers may be divided into two classes, (1)  those that measure the velocity, (2) those that measure the pressure  of the wind, but inasmuch as there is a close connexion between the  pressure and the velocity, a suitable anemometer of either class will  give information about both these quantities.    Velocity anemometers may again be subdivided into two classes, (1)  those which do not require a wind vane or weathercock, (2) those  which do. The Robinson anemometer, invented (1846) by Dr. Thomas Romney  Robinson, of Armagh Observatory, is the best-known and most generally  used instrument, and belongs to the first of these. It consists  of four hemispherical cups, mounted one on each end of a pair of  horizontal arms, which lie at right angles to each other and form a  cross. A vertical axis round which the cups turn passes through the  centre of the cross; a train of wheel-work counts up the number of  turns which this axis makes, and from the number of turns made in any  given time the velocity of the wind during that time is calculated.  The cups are placed symmetrically on the end of the arms, and it is  easy to see that the wind always has the hollow of one cup presented  to it; the back of the cup on the opposite end of the cross also  faces the wind, but the pressure on it is naturally less, and hence  a continual rotation is produced; each cup in turn as it comes round  providing the necessary force. The two great merits of this anemometer  are its simplicity and the absence of a wind vane; on the other hand  it is not well adapted to leaving a record on paper of the actual  velocity at any definite instant, and hence it leaves a short but  violent gust unrecorded. Unfortunately, when Dr. Robinson first  designed his anemometer, he stated that no matter what the size of the  cups or the length of the arms, the cups always moved with one-third  of the velocity of the wind. This result was apparently confirmed by  some independent experiments, but it is very far from the truth, for  it is now known that the actual ratio, or factor as it is commonly  called, of the velocity of the wind to that of the cups depends very  largely on the dimensions of the cups and arms, and may have almost  any value between two and a little over three. The result has been  that wind velocities published in many official publications have  often been in error by nearly 50%.    The other forms of velocity anemometer may be described as belonging  to the windmill type. In the Robinson anemometer the axis of rotation  is vertical, but with this subdivision the axis of rotation must  be parallel to the direction of the wind and therefore horizontal.  Furthermore, since the wind varies in direction and the axis has to  follow its changes, a wind vane or some other contrivance to fulfil  the same purpose must be employed. This type of instrument is very  little used in England, but seems to be more in favour in France. In  cases where the direction of the air motion is always the same, as  in the ventilating shafts of mines and buildings for instance, these  anemometers, known, however, as air meters, are employed, and give  most satisfactory results.    Anemometers which measure the pressure may be divided into the plate  and tube classes, but the former term must be taken as including a  good many miscellaneous forms. The simplest type of this form consists  of a flat plate, which is usually square or circular, while a wind  vane keeps this exposed normally to the wind, and the pressure of the  wind on its face is balanced by a spring. The distortion of the spring  determines the actual force which the wind is exerting on the plate,  and this is either read off on a suitable gauge, or leaves a record in  the ordinary way by means of a pen writing on a sheet of paper moved  by clockwork. Instruments of this kind have been in use for a long  series of years, and have recorded pressures up to and even exceeding  60 lb per sq. ft., but it is now fairly certain that these high values  are erroneous, and due, not to the wind, but to faulty design of the  anemometer.    The fact is that the wind is continually varying in force, and while  the ordinary pressure plate is admirably adapted for measuring the  force of a steady and uniform wind, it is entirely unsuitable for  following the rapid fluctuations of the natural wind. To make  matters worse, the pen which records the motion of the plate is often  connected with it by an extensive system of chains and levers. A  violent gust strikes the plate, which is driven back and carried by  its own momentum far past the position in which a steady wind of the  same force would place it; by the time the motion has reached the pen  it has been greatly exaggerated by the springiness of the connexion,  and not only is the plate itself driven too far back, but also its  position is wrongly recorded by the pen; the combined errors act  the same way, and more than double the real maximum pressure may be  indicated on the chart.    A modification of the ordinary pressure-plate has recently been  designed. In this arrangement a catch is provided so that the plate  being once driven back by the wind cannot return until released by  hand; but the catch does not prevent the plate being driven back  farther by a gust stronger than the last one that moved it. Examples  of these plates are erected on the west coast of England, where in the  winter fierce gales often occur; a pressure of 30 lb per sq. ft. has  not been shown by them, and instances exceeding 20 lb are extremely  rare.    Many other modifications have been used and suggested. Probably a  sphere would prove most useful for a pressure anemometer, since owing  to its symmetrical shape it would not require a weathercock. A small  light sphere hanging from the end of 30 or 40 ft. of fine sewing  cotton has been employed to measure the wind velocity passing over  a kite, the tension of the cotton being recorded, and this plan has  given satisfactory results.    Lind's anemometer, which consists simply of a U tube containing liquid  with one end bent into a horizontal direction to face the wind, is  perhaps the original form from which the tube class of instrument  has sprung. If the wind blows into the mouth of a tube it causes an  increase of pressure inside and also of course an equal increase in  all closed vessels with which the mouth is in airtight communication.  If it blows horizontally over the open end of a vertical tube it  causes a decrease of pressure, but this fact is not of any practical  use in anemometry, because the magnitude of the decrease depends on  the wind striking the tube exactly at right angles to its axis,  the most trifling departure from the true direction causing great  variations in the magnitude. The pressure tube anemometer (fig. 1)  utilizes the increased pressure in the open mouth of a straight tube  facing the wind, and the decrease of pressure caused inside when the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13602"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#2)"],[1,"fine 'taters, red on de outside and  pretty and white on de inside, but white folks called 'em  'nigger-killers.'

W.B. (Uncle Wash)\"; however,  this informant is different from the next informant, Rev. W.B. Allen.]      The story of \"Uncle Wash\", as he is familiarly known, is condensed as  follows:    He was born on the plantation of a Mr. Washington Allen of South  Carolina, for whom he was named. This Mr. Allen had several sons and  daughters, and of these, one son--George Allen--who, during the 1850's  left his South Carolina home and settled near LaFayette, Alabama. About  1858, Mr. Washington Allen died and the next year, when \"Wash\" was \"a  five-year old shaver\", the Allen estate in South Carolina was  divided--all except the Allen Negro slaves. These, at the instance and  insistence of Mr. George Allen, were taken to LaFayette, Alabama, to be  sold. All were put on the block and auctioned off, Mr. George Allen  buying every Negro, so that not a single slave family was divided up.    \"Uncle Wash\" does not remember what he \"fetched at de sale\", but he does  distinctly remember that as he stepped up on the block to be sold, the  auctioneer ran his hand \"over my head and said: Genilmens, dis boy is  as fine as split silk\". Then when Mr. George Allen had bought all the  Allen slaves, it dawned upon them, and they appreciated, why he had  insisted on their being sold in Alabama, rather than in South Carolina.    Before he was six years of age, little \"Wash\" lost his mother and, from  then until freedom, he was personally cared for and looked after by Mrs.  George Allen; and the old man wept every time he mentioned her name.    During the '60's, \"Uncle Wash's\" father drove a mail and passenger stage  between Cusseta and LaFayette, Alabama--and, finally died and was buried  at LaFayette by the side of his wife. \"Uncle Wash\" \"drifted over\" to  Columbus about fifty years ago and is now living with his two surviving  children.    He has been married four times, all his wives dying \"nachul\" deaths. He  has also \"buried four chillun\".    He was taught to read and write by the sons and daughters of Mr. George  Allen, and attended church where a one-eyed white preacher--named Mr.  Terrentine--preached to the slaves each Sunday \"evenin'\" (afternoon).  The salary of this preacher was paid by Mr. George Allen.    When asked what this preacher usually preached about, \"Uncle Wash\"  answered: \"He was a one-eyed man an' couldn' see good; so, he mout  a'made some mistakes, but he sho tole us plenty 'bout hell fire 'n  brimstone.\"    \"Uncle Wash\" is a literal worshipper of the memory of his \"old time  white fokes.\"          J.R. Jones    REV. W.B. ALLEN, EX-SLAVE  425-Second Ave  Columbus, Georgia  (June 29, 1937)  [JUL 28 1937]    [TR: Original index refers to \"Allen, Rev. W.B. (Uncle Wash)\"; however,  this informant is different from the previous informant, Washington  Allen, interviewed on Dec. 18, 1936. The previous interview for Rev.  Allen that is mentioned below is not found in this volume.]      In a second interview, the submission of which was voluntarily sought by  himself, this very interesting specimen of a rapidly vanishing type  expressed a desire to amend his previous interview (of May 10, 1937) to  incorporate the following facts:    \"For a number of years before freedom, my father bought his time from  his master and traveled about over Russell County (Alabama) as a  journeyman blacksmith, doing work for various planters and making good  money--as money went in those days--on the side. At the close of the  war, however, though he had a trunk full of Confederate money, all of  his good money was gone.    Father could neither read nor write, but had a good head for figures and  was very pious. His life had a wonderful influence upon me, though I was  originally worldly--that is, I drank and cussed, but haven't touched a  drop of spirits in forty years and quit cussing before I entered the  ministry in 1879.    I learned to pray when very young and kept it up even in my unsaved  days. My white master's folks knew me to be a praying boy, and asked  me--in 1865--when the South was about whipped and General Wilson was  headed our way--to pray to God to hold the Yankees back. Of course, I  didn't have any love for any Yankees--and haven't now, for that  matter--but I told my white folks straight-from-the-shoulder that I  _could not_ pray along those lines. I told them flat-footedly that,  while I loved them and would do any reasonable praying for them, I could  not pray against my conscience: that I not only wanted to be free, but  that I wanted to see all the Negroes freed!    I then told them that God was using the Yankees to scourge the  slave-holders just as He had, centuries before, used heathens and  outcasts to chastise His chosen people--the Children of Israel.\"    (Here it is to be noted that, for a slave boy of between approximately  15 and 17 years of age, remarkable familiarity with the Old Testament  was displayed.)    The Parson then entered into a mild tirade against Yankees, saying:    \"The only time the Northern people ever helped the Nigger was when they  freed him. They are not friends of the Negro and many a time, from my  pulpit, have I warned Niggers about going North. No, sir, the colored  man doesn't belong in the North---has no business up there, and you may  tell the world that the Reverend W.B. Allen makes no bones about saying  that! He also says that, if it wasn't for the influence of the white  race in the South, the Negro race would revert to savagery within a  year! Why, if they knew for dead certain that there was not a policeman  or officer of the law in Columbus tonight, the good Lord only knows what  they'd do tonight\"!    When the good Parson had delivered himself as quoted, he was asked a  few questions, the answers to which--as shall follow--disclose their  nature.    \"The lowest down Whites of slavery days were the average overseers. A  few were gentlemen, one must admit, but the regular run of them were  trash--commoner than the 'poor white trash'--and, if possible, their  children were worse than their daddies. The name, 'overseer', was a  synonym for 'slave driver', 'cruelty', 'brutishness'. No, sir, a Nigger  may be humble and refuse to talk outside of his race--because he's  afraid to, but you can't fool him about a white man!    And you couldn't fool him when he was a slave! He knows a white man for  what he is, and he knew him the same way in slavery times.\"    Concerning the punishment of slaves, the Reverend said:    \"I never heard or knew of a slave being tried in court for any thing. I  never knew of a slave being guilty of any crime more serious than taking  something or violating plantation rules. And the only punishment that I  ever heard or knew of being administered slaves was whipping.    I have"]]]
