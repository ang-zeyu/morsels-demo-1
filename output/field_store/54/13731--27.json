VISIT OF HOPE TO SYDNEY-COVE, NEAR BOTANY-BAY.    Where Sydney Cove her lucid bosom swells,  Courts her young navies, and the storm repels;  High on a rock amid the troubled air  HOPE stood sublime, and wav'd her golden hair;  Calm'd with her rosy smile the tossing deep,  And with sweet accents charm'd the winds to sleep;  To each wild plain she stretch'd her snowy hand,  High-waving wood, and sea-encircled strand.  \"Hear me,\" she cried, \"ye rising Realms! record  \"Time's opening scenes, and Truth's unerring word.--  \"There shall broad streets their stately walls extend,  \"The circus widen, and the crescent bend;  \"There, ray'd from cities o'er the cultur'd land,  \"Shall bright canals, and solid roads expand.--  \"There the proud arch, Colossus-like, bestride  \"Yon glittering streams, and bound the chasing tide;  \"Embellish'd villas crown the landscape-scene,  \"Farms wave with gold, and orchards blush between.--  \"There shall tall spires, and dome-capt towers ascend,  \"And piers and quays their massy structures blend;  \"While with each breeze approaching vessels glide,  \"And northern treasures dance on every tide!\"--  Then ceas'd the nymph--tumultuous echoes roar,  And JOY's loud voice was heard from shore to shore--  Her graceful steps descending press'd the plain,  And PEACE, and ART, and LABOUR, join'd her train.

FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 1: Africa for white African citizens.]          CURSORY HISTORY OF THE BOER NATION    The two principal elements of the Boer nation were the settlers of the  Dutch trading company at the Cape of Good Hope, sturdy farmers and  tradesmen belonging to the proletarian class of Holland, and a  subsequent contingent of French Huguenot refugees and their families who  joined as colonists soon after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. I  mention below the names still existing which form a large proportion of  the present Boer nation of Huguenot descent:--    Billion     Blignaut  Bisseux   Delporte  Du prez     Du Toit   De la Bey Durand  Davel       De Langue Duvenage  Fourie  Fouche      Grove     Hugo      Jourdan  Lombard     Le Roux   Roux      Lagrange  Labuscaque  Mare      Marais    Malan  Malraison   Maynard   Malherbe  De Meillon  De Marillac Matthee   Naude     Nortier  Rousseau    Taillard  Theron    Terblanche  De Villiers Fortier   Lindeque  Vervier  Vercueil    Basson    Pinard    Duvenage  Celliers    de Clercq Leclercq  Devinare    Men of the best French stock, noted for honour, energy and  perseverance, rather than recant their Protestant faith, abandoned  seigneurial homes, high positions and lucrative callings to carve out  fresh careers, and even to become humble farmers wherever they found  asylums and tolerance, men who became very valuable accessions to the  nations who received them and a correspondingly significant loss to  France. To those two main elements were added sparse accessions from  other nations at later intervals, and also a strain of aboriginal blood,  of which a more or less faint tinge is still discernible in some  families, an admixture which many deplore and others consider as most  serviceable, supplying a subtle piquancy for perfecting the general  stock.    The early Cape Governors aimed at the prompt assimilation of those  French people with their own colonists--to make Dutchmen of them. Among  other drastic enactments to enforce that object, no other language but  Dutch was permitted to be used in public of pain of corporal punishment.  Not a few noble Frenchmen were subjected to that indignity for  inadvertent breaches of that draconian law, but, as conscientious  observers of biblical commands which enjoin subjection to all  governmental rule, they willingly submitted and obeyed. Intermarriages  with their Dutch fellow-colonists further promoted assimilation into one  cohesive community. At the same time the Huguenot faith was transmitted  to their descendants, and had a marked influence in sustaining common  religious fervour and consistency. They did not look for a reward or  compensation for the sacrifices endured, for the sake of faith, by those  refugees, though a gracious providence, as the sequel showed, held in  store a most ample restitution--magnificent heirlooms for their later  descendants, heirlooms which are now unhappily staked in this present  war.    In 1814 a payment of six millions sterling received by the Prince of  Orange closed the transfer of the Dutch Cape settlement to Great  Britain. Immigration of English settlers followed and the area of the  colony soon largely extended. As under the Dutch _regime_, the practice  of slavery had continued until its abolition in 1833 by the ransom  payable by the English Government to the owners of slaves. The Boer  colonists deeply resented that act, and especially the next to  impracticable condition which provided that payments could only be  received in England instead of on the spot. Many were cheated of all  their emancipation money by their appointed proxies or agents, or else  had to submit to exorbitant charges and commissions; a great number  voluntarily renounced all in disgust.    By that time the existence had become known of promising tracts of  country lying north of the Orange River beyond the confines of the  British colonies, and a large number of Boers combined with the  intention of establishing an independent community northwards free from  British restraint.    The British authorities appeared at that time not to fully realize that  that movement was rife with future dangers and complications to their  own colonial interests, that it meant the creation of a nucleus of a  people openly averse to the English, and who would independently carry  out practices in near proximity, especially in dealing with aborigines,  which would seriously compromise them and become a standing menace  against peaceful expansion and civilization.    It was, on the other hand, anticipated that the movement could only end  in disaster, the people being too few to make a successful stand against  the numerous hostile Kaffir tribes. The Government, therefore, refrained  from preventive measures, and confined its efforts to discouraging the  emigration and to reconcile the malcontents. Those efforts, however,  proved fruitless; the people held to their project with resolute  fearlessness and self-confidence, and were even content to sacrifice  their farms and homesteads, their sale being in some cases forbidden by  special enactment.    The terms of \"Boer\" and \"Boer nation\" do not convey or mean anything  disparaging, rather the contrary. Boer simply means farmer, as a rule  the proprietor of a farm of about 3,000 to 10,000 acres, who combines  stock-breeding with a variety of other farming enterprises as well,  according to the soil and locality. As a national designation, the term  \"Boer\" conveys the distinction from the recently arrived Dutchman, who  is called \"Hollander.\" Hollanders, again, delight of late to claim the  Boer nation as their kith and kin, but prefer to ignore the existence of  the French Huguenot factor.    The great \"trek,\" with families and movables, as the emigration movement  is called, occurred in 1836; some families started even before, and  other contingents followed shortly afterwards. After many vicissitudes  and nearly twenty years of wanderings, and a nomadic life attended with  untold hardships and dangers, intermittent conflicts with native tribes,  and at times also contests with British forces, they were eventually  permitted, under treaty with England, to settle down and to constitute  the independent Orange Free State and Transvaal Republics. That was in  1854 and 1852 respectively.    But, until then, progress in the British colonies and peaceful relations  with the several Kaffir nations had at times been sadly impeded by the  aggressive native policy pursued by the Boers after the pattern adopted  from the previous Dutch _regime_, which admitted of slavery, whilst  English law had abolished and forbade that practice as contrary to a  soundly moral method of civilizing natives and inimical to prosperous  and peaceable colonial progress. Broils and wars between Boers and  Kaffirs had been almost incessant, and intervals of peace only proved  their mutually latent hostility. Besides being occasionally engaged in  unavoidable wars with neighbouring tribes themselves, it became  frequently incumbent upon the British military authorities to intervene  in conflicts induced by the Boers, alternately protecting them against  natives and natives against the Boers, and all that at the unnecessary  expenditure of much blood and treasure.    The Boer occupation of Natal was found to be wholly prejudicial to  British interests on aforesaid accounts, and was, besides, contrary to  the express declaration of the Boer emigrants at the time of their  exodus from the Cape Colony, which was that their new settlements should  be located north of the Orange River. Stepping in to the eastward and  claiming part of the littoral constituted a rivalry in conflict with  that understanding, and England therefore considered it within her  rights to expel the Boers from Natal, and to proceed with the  colonization there with British settlers instead. That temporary  occupation of Natal had been fraught to the Boers with most stirring  episodes--some of the most melancholy description, and others  representing records of really unsurpassed heroism, which can but arouse  deepest emotions and admiration in any reader of their history. There  was the treacherous massacre of Retief and Potgeiter and his party by  the Zulu king Dingaan at his military kraal, followed by other wholesale  massacres of men, women, and children at Weenen and other Boer camps in  Natal. Then came the punitive expedition of 450 Boers, armed with  flint-locks only, who utterly defeated Dingaan's most redoubtable impi  of 10,000 warriors, and resulted in the complete overthrow of that Zulu  monarch.    When that punitive Boer commando was about to start upon its mission it  was solemnly vowed to observe a day of national thanksgiving each year  if Divine aid were vouchsafed to accomplish the object. That brilliant  victory had occurred on the 16th December, 1838, and the day has ever  since been religiously observed as had been vowed. The celebrations in  the Transvaal take place at Paarden-kraal, near Johannesburg, and some  other accessible and central camping grounds, where the burghers with  their families congregate in thousands--a sort of feast of tabernacles,  lasting three days, undeterred by the most boisterous weather. The  declaration of independence fell on that same date at Paarden-kraal in  1879, and it was also in December of the succeeding year that the Boers  proved victorious over the British troops in Natal, after which the  Transvaal had its independence generously restored by the Gladstone  Ministry (subject to treaty 1881).    On those anniversaries stirring speeches would be made by the elder  leading men, rehearsing the events of the nation's "]]]
