From that day the Bismarcks have held their own among the  nobility of Brandenburg. Claus eventually became Hofmeister of  Brandenburg, the chief officer at the Court; he had his quarrels with  the Church, or rather with the spiritual lords, the bishops of Havelburg  and Magdeburg, and was once excommunicated, as his father had been  before him, and as two of his sons were after him.    Claus died about the year 1385. For two hundred years the Bismarcks  continued to live at Burgstall, to which they added many other estates.  When Conrad of Hohenzollern was appointed Margrave and Elector, he found  sturdy supporters in the lords of Burgstall; he and his successors often  came there to hunt the deer and wild boars, perhaps also the wolves  and bears, with which the forests around the castle abounded; for the  Hohenzollerns were keen sportsmen then as now, as their vassals found  to their cost. In 1555, Hans George, son of the reigning Elector,  Albert Achilles, bought the neighbouring estate of Letzlingen from  the Alvenslebens; there he built a house which is still the chief  hunting-lodge of the Kings of Prussia. Soon he cast envious eyes on the  great woods and preserves which belong to Burgstall, and intimated that  he wished to possess them. The Bismarcks resisted long. First they were  compelled to surrender their hunting rights; this was not sufficient;  the appetite of the Prince grew; in his own words he wished \"to be rid  of the Bismarcks from the moor and the Tanger altogether.\" He offered in  exchange some of the monasteries which had lately been suppressed; the  Bismarcks (the family was represented by two pairs of brothers, who all  lived together in the great castle) long refused; they represented that  their ancestors had been faithful vassals; they had served the Electors  with blood and treasure; they wished \"to remain in the pleasant place to  which they had been assigned by God Almighty.\" It was all of no use; the  Prince insisted, and his wrath was dangerous. The Bismarcks gave in;  they surrendered Burgstall and received in exchange Schoenhausen and  Crevisse, a confiscated nunnery, on condition that as long as the  ejected nuns lived the new lords should support them; for which purpose  the Bismarcks had annually to supply a certain quantity of food and  eighteen barrels of beer.    Of the four co-proprietors, all died without issue, except Friedrich,  called the Permutator, in whose hands the whole of the family property  was again collected; he went to live at Schoenhausen, which since then  has been the home of the family. No remains of the old castle exist, but  the church, built in the thirteenth century, is one of the oldest and  most beautiful in the land between the Havel and the Elbe. House and  church stand side by side on a small rising overlooking the Elbe. Here  they took up their abode; the family to some extent had come down in the  world. The change had been a disadvantageous one; they had lost in wealth  and importance. For two hundred years they played no very prominent part;  they married with the neighbouring country gentry and fought in all the  wars. Rudolph, Friedrich's son, fought in France in behalf of the  Huguenots, and then under the Emperor against the Turks. His grandson,  August, enlisted under Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar; afterwards he fought in  the religious wars in France and Germany, always on the Protestant  side; lastly, he took service under the Elector of Brandenburg.    It was in his lifetime that a great change began to take place which was  to alter the whole life of his descendants. In 1640, Frederick William,  known as the great Elector, succeeded his father. He it was who laid the  foundations for that system of government by which a small German  principality has grown to be the most powerful military monarchy in  modern Europe. He held his own against the Emperor; he fought with the  Poles and compelled their King to grant him East Prussia; he drove the  Swedes out of the land. More than this, he enforced order in his own  dominions; he laid the foundation for the prosperity of Berlin; he  organised the administration and got together a small but efficient  military force. The growing power of the Elector was gained to a great  extent at the expense of the nobles; he took from them many of the  privileges they had before enjoyed. The work he began was continued by  his son, who took the title of King; and by his grandson, who invented  the Prussian system of administration, and created the army with which  Frederick the Great fought his battles.    The result of the growth of the strong, organised monarchy was indeed  completely to alter the position of the nobles. The German barons in the  south had succeeded in throwing off the control of their territorial  lords; they owned no authority but the vague control of the distant  Emperor, and ruled their little estates with an almost royal  independence; they had their own laws, their own coinage, their own  army. In the north, the nobles of Mecklenburg Holstein, and Hanover  formed a dominant class, and the whole government of the State was in  their hands; but those barons whose homes fell within the dominion of  the Kings of Prussia found themselves face to face with a will and a  power stronger than their own; they lost in independence, but they  gained far more than they lost. They were the basis on which the State  was built up; they no longer wasted their military prowess in  purposeless feuds or in mercenary service; in the Prussian army and  administration they found full scope for their ambition, and when the  victories of Frederick the Great had raised Prussia to the rank of a  European Power, the nobles of Brandenburg were the most loyal of his  subjects. They formed an exclusive caste; they seldom left their homes;  they were little known in the south of Germany or in foreign countries;  they seldom married outside their own ranks. Their chief amusement was  the chase, and their chief occupation was war. And no king has ever had  under his orders so fine a race of soldiers; they commanded the armies  of Frederick and won his battles. Dearly did they pay for the greatness  of Prussia; of one family alone, the Kleists, sixty-four fell on the  field of battle during the Seven Years' War.    They might well consider that the State which they had helped to make,  and which they had saved by their blood, belonged to them. But if they  had become Prussians, they did not cease to be Brandenburgers; their  loyalty to their king never swerved, for they knew that he belonged to  them as he did to no other of his subjects. He might go to distant  Koenigsberg to assume the crown, but his home was amongst them; other  provinces might be gained or lost with the chances of war, but while a  single Hohenzollern lived he could not desert his subjects of the Mark.  They had the intense local patriotism so characteristic of the German  nation, which is the surest foundation for political greatness; but  while in other parts the Particularists, as the Germans called them,  aimed only at independence, the Brandenburger who had become a Prussian  desired domination.    Among them the Bismarcks lived. The family again divided into two  branches: one, which became extinct about 1780, dwelling at Crevisse,  gave several high officials to the Prussian Civil Service; the other  branch, which continued at Schoenhausen, generally chose a military  career. August's son, who had the same name as his father, rebuilt the  house, which had been entirely destroyed by the Swedes during the Thirty  Years' War; he held the position of Landrath, that is, he was the head  of the administration of the district in which he lived. He married a  Fraeulein von Katte, of a well-known family whose estates adjoined those  of the Bismarcks. Frau von Bismarck was the aunt of the unfortunate  young man who was put to death for helping Frederick the Great in his  attempt to escape. His tomb is still to be seen at Wust, which lies  across the river a few miles from Schoenhausen; and at the new house,  which arose at Schoenhausen and still stands, the arms of the Kattes  are joined to the Bismarck trefoil. The successor to the estates, August  Friedrich, was a thorough soldier; he married a Fraeulein von Diebwitz  and acquired fresh estates in Pomerania, where he generally lived.    He rose to the rank of colonel, and fell fighting against the Austrians  at Chotusitz in 1742. \"Ein ganzer Kerl\" (a fine fellow), said the King,  as he stood by the dying officer. His son, Carl Alexander, succeeded to  Schoenhausen; the next generation kept up the military traditions of the  family; of four brothers, all but one became professional officers and  fought against France in the wars of liberation. One fell at Moeckern in  1813; another rose to the rank of lieutenant-general; the third also  fought in the war; his son, the later Count Bismarck-Bohlen, was wounded  at Grossbehren, and the father at once came to take his place during his  convalescence, in order that the Prussian army might not have fewer  Bismarcks. When the young Otto was born two years later, he would often  hear of the adventures of his three uncles and his cousin in the great  war. The latter, Bismarck-Bohlen, rose to very high honours and was to  die when over eighty years of age, after he had witnessed the next great  war with France. It is a curious instance of the divisions of Germany in  those days that there were Bismarcks fighting on the French side  throughout the war. One branch of the family had settled in South  Germany; the head of it, Friedrich Wilhelm, had taken service in the  Wurtemburg army; he had become a celebrated leader of cavalry and was  passionately devoted to Napoleon. He served with distinction in the  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12406"],[0,"Kepler (#2)"],[1," break sufficiently away from the old tradition of uniform circular  motion. Ptolemy's efforts at exactness were baulked, as we have seen, by  the supposed necessity of all the orbit planes passing through the  earth, and if Copernicus had simply transferred this responsibility to  the sun he would have done better. But he would not sacrifice the old  fetish, and so, the orbit of the earth being clearly not circular with  respect to the sun, he made all his planetary planes pass through the  centre of the earth's orbit, instead of through the sun, thus  handicapping himself in the same way though not in the same degree as  Ptolemy. His thirty-four circles or epicycles comprised four for the  earth, three for the moon, seven for Mercury (on account of his highly  eccentric orbit) and five each for the other planets.    It is rather an exaggeration to call the present accepted system the  Copernican system, as it is really due to Kepler, half a century after  the death of Copernicus, but much credit is due to the latter for his  successful attempt to provide a real alternative for the Ptolemaic  system, instead of tinkering with it. The old geocentric system once  shaken, the way was gradually smoothed for the heliocentric system,  which Copernicus, still hampered by tradition, did not quite reach. He  was hardly a practical astronomer in the observational sense. His first  recorded observation, of an occultation of Aldebaran, was made in 1497,  and he is not known to have made as many as fifty astronomical  observations, while, of the few he did make and use, at least one was  more than half a degree in error, which would have been intolerable to  such an observer as Hipparchus. Copernicus in fact seems to have  considered accurate observations unattainable with the instruments at  hand. He refused to give any opinion on the projected reform of the  calendar, on the ground that the motions of the sun and moon were not  known with sufficient accuracy. It is possible that with better data he  might have made much more progress. He was in no hurry to publish  anything, perhaps on account of possible opposition. Certainly Luther,  with his obstinate conviction of the verbal accuracy of the Scriptures,  rejected as mere folly the idea of a moving earth, and Melanchthon  thought such opinions should be prohibited, but Rheticus, a professor at  the Protestant University of Wittenberg and an enthusiastic pupil of  Copernicus, urged publication, and undertook to see the work through the  press. This, however, he was unable to complete and another Lutheran,  Osiander, to whom he entrusted it, wrote a preface, with the apparent  intention of disarming opposition, in which he stated that the  principles laid down were only abstract hypotheses convenient for  purposes of calculation. This unauthorised interpolation may have had  its share in postponing the prohibition of the book by the Church of  Rome.    According to Copernicus the earth is only a planet like the others, and  not even the biggest one, while the sun is the most important body in  the system, and the stars probably too far away for any motion of the  earth to affect their apparent places. The earth in fact is very small  in comparison with the distance of the stars, as evidenced by the fact  that an observer anywhere on the earth appears to be in the middle of  the universe. He shows that the revolution of the earth will account for  the seasons, and for the stationary points and retrograde motions of the  planets. He corrects definitely the order of the planets outwards from  the sun, a matter which had been in dispute. A notable defect is due to  the idea that a body can only revolve about another body or a point, as  if rigidly connected with it, so that, in order to keep the earth's axis  in a constant direction in space, he has to invent a third motion. His  discussion of precession, which he rightly attributes to a slow motion  of the earth's axis, is marred by the idea that the precession is  variable. With all its defects, partly due to reliance on bad  observations, the work showed a great advance in the interpretation of  the motions of the planets; and his determinations of the periods both  in relation to the earth and to the stars were adopted by Reinhold,  Professor of Astronomy at Wittenberg, for the new Prutenic or Prussian  Tables, which were to supersede the obsolete Alphonsine Tables of the  thirteenth century.    In comparison with the question of the motion of the earth, no other  astronomical detail of the time seems to be of much consequence. Comets,  such as from time to time appeared, bright enough for naked eye  observation, were still regarded as atmospheric phenomena, and their  principal interest, as well as that of eclipses and planetary  conjunctions, was in relation to astrology. Reform, however, was  obviously in the air. The doctrine of Copernicus was destined very soon  to divide others besides the Lutheran leaders. The leaven of inquiry was  working, and not long after the death of Copernicus real advances were  to come, first in the accuracy of observations, and, as a necessary  result of these, in the planetary theory itself.              CHAPTER II.    EARLY LIFE OF KEPLER.      On 21st December, 1571, at Weil in the Duchy of Wurtemberg, was born a  weak and sickly seven-months' child, to whom his parents Henry and  Catherine Kepler gave the name of John. Henry Kepler was a petty officer  in the service of the reigning Duke, and in 1576 joined the army serving  in the Netherlands. His wife followed him, leaving her young son in his  grandfather's care at Leonberg, where he barely recovered from a severe  attack of smallpox. It was from this place that John derived the  Latinised name of Leonmontanus, in accordance with the common practice  of the time, but he was not known by it to any great extent. He was sent  to school in 1577, but in the following year his father returned to  Germany, almost ruined by the absconding of an acquaintance for whom he  had become surety. Henry Kepler was obliged to sell his house and most  of his belongings, and to keep a tavern at Elmendingen, withdrawing his  son from school to help him with the rough work. In 1583 young Kepler  was sent to the school at Elmendingen, and in 1584 had another narrow  escape from death by a violent illness. In 1586 he was sent, at the  charges of the Duke, to the monastic school of Maulbronn; from whence,  in accordance with the school regulations, he passed at the end of his  first year the examination for the bachelor's degree at Tuebingen,  returning for two more years as a \"veteran\" to Maulbronn before being  admitted as a resident student at Tuebingen. The three years thus spent  at Maulbronn were marked by recurrences of several of the diseases from  which he had suffered in childhood, and also by family troubles at his  home. His father went away after a quarrel with his wife Catherine, and  died abroad. Catherine herself, who seems to have been of a very  unamiable disposition, next quarrelled with her own relatives. It is not  surprising therefore that Kepler after taking his M.A. degree in August,  1591, coming out second in the examination lists, was ready to accept  the first appointment offered him, even if it should involve leaving  home. This happened to be the lectureship in astronomy at Gratz, the  chief town in Styria. Kepler's knowledge of astronomy was limited to the  compulsory school course, nor had he as yet any particular leaning  towards the science; the post, moreover, was a meagre and unimportant  one. On the other hand he had frequently expressed disgust at the way in  which one after another of his companions had refused \"foreign\"  appointments which had been arranged for them under the Duke's scheme of  education. His tutors also strongly urged him to accept the lectureship,  and he had not the usual reluctance to leave home. He therefore  proceeded to Gratz, protesting that he did not thereby forfeit his claim  to a more promising opening, when such should appear. His astronomical  tutor, Maestlin, encouraged him to devote himself to his newly adopted  science, and the first result of this advice appeared before very long  in Kepler's \"Mysterium Cosmographicum\". The bent of his mind was towards  philosophical speculation, to which he had been attracted in his  youthful studies of Scaliger's \"Exoteric Exercises\". He says he devoted  much time \"to the examination of the nature of heaven, of souls, of  genii, of the elements, of the essence of fire, of the cause of  fountains, the ebb and flow of the tides, the shape of the continents  and inland seas, and things of this sort\". Following his tutor in his  admiration for the Copernican theory, he wrote an essay on the primary  motion, attributing it to the rotation of the earth, and this not for  the mathematical reasons brought forward by Copernicus, but, as he  himself says, on physical or metaphysical grounds. In 1595, having more  leisure from lectures, he turned his speculative mind to the number,  size, and motion of the planetary orbits. He first tried simple  numerical relations, but none of them appeared to be twice, thrice, or  four times as great as another, although he felt convinced that there  was some relation between the motions and the distances, seeing that  when a gap appeared in one series, there was a corresponding gap in the  other. These gaps he attempted to fill by hypothetical planets between  Mars and Jupiter, and between Mercury and Venus, but this method also  failed to provide the regular proportion which he sought, besides being  open to the objection that on the same principle there might be many  more equally invisible planets at either end of the series. He was  nevertheless unwilling to adopt the opinion of Rheticus that the number  six was sacred, maintaining that the \"sacredness\" of the number was of  much more recent date than the creation "]]]
