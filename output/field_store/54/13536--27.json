And so of the nostrils: a wide-dilated nostril is at once better than a  contracted one for respiration, and gives the animal a fiercer aspect.  Note how, for instance, when one stallion is enraged against another, or  when his spirit chafes in being ridden, (21) the nostrils at once become  dilated.     (21) Or, \"in the racecourse or on the exercising-ground how readily he      distends his nostrils.\"    A comparatively large crest and small ears give a more typical and  horse-like appearance to the head, whilst lofty withers again allow the  rider a surer seat and a stronger adhesion between the shoulders and the  body. (22)     (22) Or if with L. D.  ({kai to somati}), transl. \"adhesion to the      horse's shoulders.\"    A \"double spine,\" (23) again, is at once softer to sit on than a single,  and more pleasing to the eye. So, too, a fairly deep side somewhat  rounded towards the belly (24) will render the animal at once easier to  sit and stronger, and as a general rule better able to digest his food.  (25)     (23) Reading after Courier {rakhis ge men}. See Virg. \"Georg.\" iii.      87, \"at duplex agitur per lumbos spina.\" \"In a horse that is in      good case, the back is broad, and the spine does not stick up like      a ridge, but forms a kind of furrow on the back\" (John Martyn); \"a      full back,\" as we say.     (24) Or, \"in proportion to.\" See Courier (\"Du Commandement de la      Cavalerie at de l'Equitation\": deux livres de Xenophon, traduits      par un officier d'artillerie a cheval), note ad loc. p. 83.     (25) i.e. \"and keep in good condition.\"    The broader and shorter the loins the more easily will the horse raise  his forequarters and bring up his hindquarters under him. Given these  points, moreover, the belly will appear as small as possible, a portion  of the body which if large is partly a disfigurement and partly tends to  make the horse less strong and capable of carrying weight. (26)     (26) Al. \"more feeble at once and ponderous in his gait.\"    The quarters should be broad and fleshy in correspondence with the sides  and chest, and if they are also firm and solid throughout they will be  all the lighter for the racecourse, and will render the horse in every  way more fleet.    To come to the thighs (and buttocks): (27) if the horse have these  separated by a broad line of demarcation (28) he will be able to plant  his hind-legs under him with a good gap between; (29) and in so doing  will assume a posture (30) and a gait in action at once prouder and more  firmly balanced, and in every way appear to the best advantage.

The human subject would seem to point to this conclusion. When a  man wants to lift anything from off the ground he essays to do so by  bringing the legs apart and not by bringing them together.    A horse ought not to have large testicles, though that is not a point to  be determined in the colt.    And now, as regards the lower parts, the hocks, (31) or shanks and  fetlocks and hoofs, we have only to repeat what has been said already  about those of the fore-legs.     (31) {ton katothen astragelon, e knemon}, lit. \"the under (or hinder?)      knuckle-bones (hocks?) or shins\"; i.e. anatomically speaking, the      os calcis, astragalus, tarsals, and metatarsal large and small.    I will here note some indications by which one may forecast the probable  size of the grown animal. The colt with the longest shanks at the moment  of being foaled will grow into the biggest horse; the fact being--and it  holds of all the domestic quadrupeds (32)--that with advance of time the  legs hardly increase at all, while the rest of the body grows uniformly  up to these, until it has attained its proper symmetry.     (32) Cf. Aristot. \"de Part. Anim.\" iv. 10; \"H. A.\" ii. 1; Plin. \"N.      H.\" xi. 108.    Such is the type (33) of colt and such the tests to be applied, with  every prospect of getting a sound-footed, strong, and fleshy animal  fine of form and large of stature. If changes in some instances develop  during growth, that need not prevent us from applying our tests in  confidence. It far more often happens that an ugly-looking colt will  turn out serviceable, (34) than that a foal of the above description  will turn out ugly or defective.     (33) Lit. \"by testing the shape of the colt in this way it seems to us      the purchaser will get,\" etc.     (34) For the vulg. {eukhroastoi}, a doubtful word = \"well coloured,\"      i.e. \"sleek and healthy,\" L. & S. would read {eukhrooi} (cf. \"Pol.      Lac.\" v. 8). L. Dind. conj. {enrostoi}, \"robust\"; Schneid.      {eukhrestoi}, \"serviceable.\"        II    The right method of breaking a colt needs no description at our hands.  (1) As a matter of state organisation, (2) cavalry duties usually  devolve upon those who are not stinted in means, and who have a  considerable share in the government; (3) and it seems far better for  a young man to give heed to his own health of body and to horsemanship,  or, if he already knows how to ride with skill, to practising manoeuvres,  than that he should set up as a trainer of horses. (4) The older man has  his town property and his friends, and the hundred-and-one concerns of  state or of war, on which to employ his time and energies rather than on  horsebreaking. It is plain then that any one holding my views (5) on  the subject will put a young horse out to be broken. But in so doing he  ought to draw up articles, just as a father does when he apprentices his  son to some art or handicraft, stating what sort of knowledge the  young creature is to be sent back possessed of. These will serve as  indications (6) to the trainer what points he must pay special heed to  if he is to earn his fee. At the same time pains should be taken on  the owner's part to see that the colt is gentle, tractable, and  affectionate, (7) when delivered to the professional trainer. That is a  condition of things which for the most part may be brought about at home  and by the groom--if he knows how to let the animal connect (8) hunger  and thirst and the annoyance of flies with solitude, whilst associating  food and drink and escape from sources of irritation with the presence  of man. As the result of this treatment, necessarily the young horse  will acquire--not fondness merely, but an absolute craving for human  beings. A good deal can be done by touching, stroking, patting those  parts of the body which the creature likes to have so handled. These  are the hairiest parts, or where, if there is anything annoying him, the  horse can least of all apply relief himself.     (1) Or, \"The training of the colt is a topic which, as it seems to us,      may fairly be omitted, since those appointed for cavalry service      in these states are persons who,\" etc. For reading see Courier,      \"Notes,\" p. 84.

(9) Or, \"is disposed to shy.\"    On this topic, then, of training, (10) the rules here given will, I  think, suffice for any private individual.

(1) \"Which the purchaser should lay to heart, if he does not wish to      be cheated.\"    First, then, let there be no mistake about the age. If the horse  has lost his mark teeth, (2) not only will the purchaser's hopes be  blighted, but he may find himself saddled for ever with a sorry bargain.  (3)     (2) Or, \"the milk teeth,\" i.e. is more than five years old. See      Morgan, p. 126.     (3) Lit. \"a horse that has lost his milk teeth cannot be said to      gladden his owner's mind with hopes, and is not so easily disposed      of.\"    Given that the fact of youth is well established, let there be no  mistake about another matter: how does he take the bit into his mouth  and the headstall (4) over his ears? There need be little ambiguity  on this score, if the purchaser will see the bit inserted and again  removed, under his eyes. Next, let it be carefully noted how the horse  stands being mounted. Many horses are extremely loath to admit the  approach of anything which, if once accepted, clearly means to them  enforced exertion.     (4) {koruphaia}, part of the {khalinos} gear.

Mr. Landry would not take  away any part for fear of injuring the truth of the circumstances, by  meddling with it. If Mr. Bredif, is always placed in the fore-ground, that  is not surprising; in a sister, a brother is the principal object which she  cannot lose sight of for a moment.    He who loves to observe men, in all the circumstances, in which they may be  placed, will easily judge, after what Mr. Bredif did or felt, what may have  been done or felt by the sharers in the same misfortunes, who are, besides,  never forgotten.    Mr. Bredif is now in the interior of Africa, employed upon the Mission  which the government has entrusted to him; the last accounts from him are  of the 14th of October, 1817. The manner in which he knows how to give an  account of the facts which he has observed, and still more the courage, the  prudence, and humanity, which he displayed in the disaster of the Medusa,  and in all that followed it, give reason to hope, and this hope cannot be  deceived, that be will duly execute his Mission, and render himself worthy  of his Majesty's favours.

INTRODUCTION      The French settlements, situated on the western coast of Africa, from Cape  Blanco to the mouth of the river Gambia, have been alternately possessed by  France and England, and have remained definitively in the hands of the  French, whose ancestors laid the foundations of them previously to the  fourteenth century, when they discovered this country.    The English made themselves masters in 1758 of the Isle of St Louis, the  seat of the general government of all the settlements which the French have  on that part of the coast; we recovered it twenty years after, in 1779 and  our possessions were again confirmed to us by the treaty of peace between  France and England, concluded on the 3d of September, 1783. In 1808, our  possessions fell again into the power of the English, less by the  superiority of their arms, than by the treachery of some individuals  unworthy of bearing the name of Frenchmen. They were finally restored to us  by the treaties of peace of 1814, and 1815, which confirmed that of 1783 in  its whole extent.    The stipulations of this treaty regulate the respective rights of the two  nations on the Western coast of Africa; they fix the possessions of France  as follows:--from Cape Blanco situated in longitude 19 deg. 30', and  latitude 20 deg. 55' 30\", to the mouth of the river Gambia in longitude 19 deg. 9',  and latitude 13 deg.; they guarantee this property exclusively to our country,  and only permit the English to trade together with the French, for gum,  from the river St. John to Fort Portendick inclusive, on condition, that  they shall not form establishments of any kind whatsoever in this river, or  upon any point of this coast. Only it is said, that the possession of the  factory of Albreda, situated at the month of the river Gambia, and that of  fort James, are confirmed to England.    The rights of the two nations being thus regulated, France thought of  resuming her possessions and the enjoyment of her rights. The minister of  the marine after having long meditated, and taken two years to prepare an  expedition of four vessels, at last gave orders that it should sail for  Senegal.

NARRATIVE, &c. &c.      On the 17th of June, 1816, at seven in the morning, the expedition for  Senegal sailed from the roads of the Island of Aix, under the command of  Captain Chaumareys; the vessels composing it were the _Medusa_[1] frigate  of 44 guns, Captain Chaumareys; the _Echo_[2] corvette, Captain Cornet de  Venancourt; the flute _La Loire_, commanded by Lieutenant Giquel  Destouches; and the _Argus_[3] brig, commanded by Lieutenant Parnajon. The  wind was northerly, blowing a fresh breeze; we carried all our sails; but  had hardly cleared the port when the wind scanted a little, and we tacked  to double the Tower of Chassiron, which is placed at the extremity of the  Isle of Oleron.[4] After having plied to windward the whole day, in the  evening about five o'clock, the _Loire_ being unable to stem the currents  which were at that time contrary, and hindered her from entering the  _passes_, desired leave to cast anchor; M. de Chaumareys granted it, and  ordered the whole squadron to anchor. We were then half a league from the  Isle of Rhe, within what is called the _\"Pertuis d'Antioche.\"_ We cast  anchor the first, and all the other vessels came and placed themselves near  us. The _Loire _being a dull sailer, was the last which came to an anchor.  The weather was fine: the wind N.W. and consequently too near to allow us  to double Chassiron, with a contrary current. At seven in the evening, at  the beginning of the ebb, we weighed anchor, and hoisted our sails; all the  other vessels did the same: the signal to get under way had been given them  a few minutes before. At night we found ourselves between the lights of  Chassiron and La Baleine.[5] A few moments sufficed to double them; we were  scarcely clear, when the wind became almost calm; the vessels no longer  obeyed the helm, the sky grew dark, the sea was very hollow, in short every  thing announced a storm; the wind threatened to blow from the west, and  consequently to become contrary; it was variable and squally; towards ten  o'clock it was perceived that we were running directly upon a danger,  called _Les Roches Bonnes_.[6] We tacked to escape certain destruction;  between eleven and twelve at night, a storm arose in the north, and brought  on wind from that quarter; we were then able to advance; the clouds  dispersed, and the next day the weather was very fine, with a breeze from  the N.E. but very faint; for some days we made but very little progress.    On the 21st or 22d we doubled Cape Finisterre; beyond this point which  bounds the Gulph of Gascony, the _Loire_ and the _Argus_ parted company;  these vessels sailing very ill, it was impossible for them to keep up with  the frigate, which to enable them to do so, would have been obliged to take  in her top-gallant sails and studding sails.    The _Echo_ alone was in sight, but at a great distance, and carrying a  press of sail not to lose sight of us. The frigate was so much a better  sailer than the corvette, that with a small quantity of sail, she not only  kept up with her, but even got a-head of her in a surprising manner; the  wind had freshened and we were going at the rate of "]]]
