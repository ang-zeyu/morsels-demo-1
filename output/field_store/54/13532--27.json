Every one sat rooted to the spot with fright, all except Mr. Bob, who  fled at the sound of the crash as if he had been the guilty one. Hinpoha  calmly collected the pieces and carried them out. \"My mother will be  extremely grateful to you for this when she comes home,\" she said. \"If  there was one vase in the house she hated it was this one. My Aunt  Phoebe brought it from the World's Fair in Chicago and thinks it's the  chief ornament of our home. Won't mother be glad when she finds it  broken and she can prove that none of us did it?\" The tension relaxed  and the girls breathed easily again.    \"When are your mother and father coming home?\" asked Nyoda.    \"They sailed last week on the _Francona_,\" answered Hinpoha.    \"Weren't you worried to death to have them in Europe so long with the  war going on?\" asked Migwan.    \"No, not much,\" said Hinpoha, \"because they have been in Switzerland all  the while, which is safe enough, and as they are coming home on a  neutral vessel they have had no trouble getting passage. They should be  here in a week.\" And Hinpoha's eyes shone with a great, glad light, for  although she had been having the jolliest time imaginable, doing as she  pleased in the house, which was in the care of easy-going \"Aunt Grace,\"  who never cared a bit what Hinpoha did so long as it did not bother her,  she missed her mother sorely, and could hardly wait until she returned.  Nyoda saw the transfigured look that came into her eyes when she spoke  of her mother's home coming, and her own eyes went dim, for her mother  had died when she was just Hinpoha's age.    After the breaking of the vase the game stopped and the girls sat down  again in a quiet circle. \"Do you know,\" said Nyoda, \"that bead band  Gladys made has given me an idea? Why can't we keep a personal record in  bead work? It would be a great deal more interesting and picturesque  than keeping a diary, and there would be no danger of your little sister  getting hold of it and reading your secrets out loud to her friends.\"    \"It's a great idea,\" said Migwan, who had always kept a diary and had  suffered much from an inquisitive brother and sister.    \"Besides,\" said Sahwah, \"think how exciting it would be at Ceremonial  Meetings, to sit with your life story hanging around your neck, and know  that your neighbor was just breaking _her_ neck trying to figure out  what the little pictures meant. Wouldn't old Fuzzytop love to be able to  read mine, though!\" And Sahwah giggled extravagantly as she saw in her  mind's eye the bead record of some of her activities in the Junior  session room.    \"Now, about all our activities,\" continued Nyoda, \"are covered by the  seven points of the Camp Fire Law, so that everything we do either  fulfills or breaks the Law. What do you say if we register our  commendable doings in colors, but record the event in black every time  we break the Law?\"    The girls thought this would be a fascinating game, and Sahwah remarked  that she must send to the Outfitting Company for a bunch of black beads  directly, as she had only a very few left.    \"It's a good thing we didn't keep this record last summer,\" said Gladys  with a thoughtful look in her eyes, \"or mine would have been black from  one end to the other.\"    \"It wouldn't, either,\" said Sahwah vehemently. \"You did more for us in  the end than we ever did for you. And my sins were as scarlet as yours,  every bit.\"    Since that terrible day in camp Gladys seemed to have been made over,  and never once reverted to her old selfishness and superciliousness, so  that she now had the love and esteem of every one of the Winnebagos. All  mention of her old short-comings was quickly silenced by Sahwah, who now  adored her, heart and soul. Gladys's entrance into the public school  after two years at Miss Russell's had caused quite a stir among the  girls of the neighborhood, who in times past had been wont to consider  her proud and haughty, but her simple, unaffected manner quickly won for  her a secure place in the affections of all. Teachers and scholars alike  loved her.    Sahwah was still counting up her own misdemeanors at camp when the  Evans's automobile came for Gladys, and reluctantly all the girls  prepared to go home. It always seemed harder to break away from  Hinpoha's house than from any of the others'. In spite of the rich  furnishings it had a cozy, homey atmosphere of being used from one end  to the other, and no guest, however humble, ever felt awkward or out of  place there. Thus it usually happens that when people are entirely at  ease in their own surroundings, they soon make others feel the same way  too.          CHAPTER II.      A SUDDEN MISFORTUNE.    As the day drew near for the return of her mother and father Hinpoha  went all over the house from garret to cellar seeing that everything was  put to rights. She and the other Winnebagos took a trip into the country  for bittersweet to decorate the fireplace in the library and in her  father's study upstairs. With pardonable pride she arranged a little  exhibition of the Craft work she had done in camp and the sketches she  had made of the lake and hills. On the table in her mother's room she  placed a work basket she had made of reed and lined with silk.    \"Gracious sakes, child,\" said her aunt, from her rocking chair by the  front window of the living-room, \"what a fuss you are going to! One  would think it was your Aunt Phoebe who was coming instead of your  mother and father. They'll be just as glad to see you if the house isn't  as neat as a pin from top to bottom.\" And Aunt Grace resumed her rocking  and her novel, as unconcerned about the imminent return of the travelers  as if it were nothing more than the daily visit of the milkman. Nothing  short of an earthquake would ever shake Aunt Grace out of her settled  complacency.    Hinpoha went happily on, seeing that every tack and screw was in place,  and arranging the books in the cases to correspond to her father's  catalog, for they had become sadly mixed during his absence. She even  took out a volume of his favorite essays and pored over them diligently  so that she might discuss them with him and show that she had used some  of her time to good advantage. She straightened out her bureau drawers  and mended all her clothes and stockings. When everything was in order  she viewed the result with a happy feeling at the pleasure it would give  her mother when she saw it. Hinpoha's most prominent trait in times past  had not been neatness.    Nyoda, who had been called in to make a final inspection before Hinpoha  was satisfied, wondered if all the girls were \"seeking beauty\" as  earnestly as Hinpoha was. She envied Hinpoha the homecoming of her  mother from the bottom of her heart. This feeling was particularly  strong one afternoon as she sat in the school room after the close of  school, looking over some English papers. It was the anniversary of the  death of her mother and she sat recalling little incidents of her  childhood before this best of chums had been taken away. As she sat  there half dreaming she heard voices in the hall before her door.    \"Have you heard the latest?\" asked one voice.    \"No,\" said the second voice, \"what is it?\"    \"Why, the _Francona_ has gone down,\" answered the first voice. \"Struck a  mine in the ocean.\"    At the word \"Francona\" Nyoda started up. That was the boat Hinpoha's  parents were coming on! She hurried out into the hall after the two  teachers. \"What did you say about the _Francona_?\" she asked. They  handed her the \"extra\" they had been reading and she saw with her own  eyes the account of the disaster. The list of \"saved\" was pitifully  small, and Hinpoha's parents were not among them. Soon she came to the  notation, \"Among the lost are Mr. and Mrs. Adam Bradford, prominent  Cleveland lawyer and his wife. Mr. Bradford was the son of the late  Judge Bradford and a well-known man about town.\" Of what little avail is  \"prominence\" when calamity stretches out her cruel hands! \"Well known\"  and obscure gave up their lives together and found a grave side by side.    \"You look like a ghost, Miss Kent,\" said one of the teachers. \"Any  friends of yours on board?\"    \"Dorothy Bradford's mother and father,\" answered Nyoda, \"one of the  pupils here at school.\"    Leaving her work unfinished, she hastened to Hinpoha's house. The news  had just been learned there. Aunt Grace had fainted and was being  revived with salts. Hinpoha flung herself on Nyoda and clung to her like  a drowning person. Between neighbors and friends coming to sympathize  and reporters from the newspapers seeking interviews the house was a  pandemonium. Nyoda saw that Hinpoha would never quiet down in those  surroundings and took her away to her own apartment. Of all the friends  who offered consolation Nyoda was the one to whom Hinpoha turned for  comfort. Here the brilliant young college woman and the simple girl were  on a level, for they shared a common experience, and each could  comprehend the other's sorrow.    Poor Hinpoha! She had need of all the consolation that Nyoda could give  her in the days that followed. Full of bitterness as her cup was, there  was to be added yet one more drop--the drop that caused it to run over.  Aunt Phoebe came to live with her and be the mistress of the Bradford  house. At some time in the past Judge Bradford and his sister Phoebe had  been named joint guardians of Hinpoha, but the Judge was now dead and  Aunt Phoebe was the sole guardian. Aunt Phoebe was a spinster of the  type usually described in books, tall and spare, with steely blue eyes.  She was sixty years old, but she might have been a hundred and sixty,  for all the sympathy she had with youth.

That is to  say, Messrs. Stephenson, in getting the engine put in order for the Patent  Office Museum, certainly did not cut off the fire-box shown in Mr.  Nasmyth's sketch, and replace it with the sham box now on the boiler. If  our readers will turn to our impression for the 30th of June, 1876, they  will find a very accurate engraving of the South Kensington engine, which  they can compare with Mr. Nasmyth's sketch, and not fail to perceive that  the differences are radical.    In \"Wood on Railroads,\" second edition, 1832, page 377, we are told that  \"after those experiments\"--the Rainhill trials--\"were concluded, the  Novelty underwent considerable alterations;\" and on page 399, \"Mr.  Stephenson had also improved the working of the Rocket engine, and by  applying the steam more powerfully in the chimney to increase the draught,  was enabled to raise a much greater quantity of steam than before.\" Nothing  is said as to where the new experiments took place, nor their precise date.  But it seems that the Meteor and the Arrow--Stephenson engines--were tried  at the same time; and this is really the only hint Wood gives as to what  was done to the Rocket between the 6th of October, 1829, and the 15th of  September, 1830.    There are men still alive who no doubt could clear up the question at  issue, and it is much to be hoped that they will do so. As the matter now  stands, it will be seen that we do not so much question that the Rocket in  South Kensington Museum is, in part perhaps, the original Rocket of  Rainhill celebrity, as that it ever ran in regular service on the Liverpool  and Manchester Railway. Yet, if not, then we may ask, what became of the  Rocket of 1830? It is not at all improbable that the first Rocket was cast  on one side, until it was bought by Lord Dundonald, and that its history is  set out with fair accuracy above. But the Rocket of the Manchester and  Liverpool Railway is hardly less worthy of attention than its immediate  predecessor, and concerning it information is needed. Any scrap of  information, however apparently trifling, that can be thrown on this  subject by our readers will be highly valued, and given an appropriate  place in our pages.--_The Engineer_.           *       *       *       *       *    The largest grain elevator in the world, says the _Nashville American_, is  that just constructed at Newport News under the auspices of the Chesapeake  & Ohio Railway Co.

[Footnote: Paper read before the British Association at Montreal.]    By Mr. ARTHUR RIGG, C.E.      Literature relating to turbines probably stands unrivaled among all that  concerns questions of hydraulic engineering, not so much in its voluminous  character as in the extent to which purely theoretical writers have ignored  facts, or practical writers have relied upon empirical rules rather than  upon any sound theory. In relation to this view, it may suffice to note  that theoretical deductions have frequently been based upon a  generalization that \"streams of water must enter the buckets of a turbine  without shock, and leave them without velocity.\" Both these assumed  conditions are misleading, and it is now well known that in every good  turbine both are carefully disobeyed. So-called practical writers, as a  rule, fail to give much useful information, and their task seems rather in  praise of one description of turbine above another. But generally, it is of  no consequence whatever how a stream of water may be led through the  buckets of any form of turbine, so long as its velocity gradually becomes  reduced to the smallest amount that will carry it freely clear of the  machine.    The character of theoretical information imparted by some _Chicago Journal  of Commerce_, dated 20th February, 1884. There we are informed that \"the  height of the fall is one of the most important considerations, as the same  stream of water will furnish five times the horse power at ten ft. that it  will at five ft. fall.\" By general consent twice two are four, but it has  been reserved for this imaginative writer to make the useful discovery that  sometimes twice two are ten. Not until after the translation of Captain  Morris' work on turbines by Mr. E. Morris in 1844, was attention in America  directed to the advantages which these motors possessed over the gravity  wheels then in use. A duty of 75 per cent. was then obtained, and a further  study of the subject by a most acute and practical engineer, Mr. Boyden,  led to various improvements upon Mr. Fauneyron's model, by which his  experiments indicated the high duty of 88 per cent. The most conspicuous  addition made by Mr. Boyden was the diffuser. The ingenious contrivance had  the effect of transforming part of whatever velocity remained in the stream  after passing out of a turbine into an atmospheric pressure, by which the  corresponding lost head became effective, and added about 3 per cent. to  the duty obtained. It may be worth noticing that, by an accidental  application of these principles to some inward flow turbines, there is  obtained most, if not all, of whatever advantage they are supposed to  possess, but oddly enough this genuine advantage is never mentioned by any  of the writers who are interested in their introduction or sale. The  well-known experiments of Mr. James B. Francis in 1857, and his elaborate  report, gave to hydraulic engineers a vast store of useful data, and since  that period much progress has been made in the construction of turbines,  and literature on the subject has become very complete.    In the limits of a short paper it is impossible to do justice to more than  one aspect of the considerations relating to turbines, and it is now  proposed to bring before the Mechanical Section of the British Association  some conclusions drawn from the behavior of jets of water discharged under  pressure, more particularly in the hope that, as water power is extremely  abundant in Canada, any remarks relating to the subject may not fail to  prove interesting.    Between the action of turbines and that of screw propellers exists an exact  parallelism, although in one case water imparts motion to the buckets of a  turbine, while in the other case blades of a screw give spiral movement to  a column of water driven aft from the vessel it propels forward. Turbines  have been driven sometimes by impact alone, sometimes by reaction above,  though generally by a combination of impact and reaction, and it is by the  last named system that the best results are now known to be obtained.    The ordinary paddles of a steamer impel a mass of water horizontally  backward by impact alone, but screw propellers use reaction somewhat  disguised, and only to a limited extent. The full use and advantages of  reaction for screw propellers were not generally known until after the  publication of papers by the present writer in the \"Proceedings\" of the  Institution of Naval Architects for 1867 and 1868, and more fully in the  \"Transactions\" of the Society of Engineers for 1868. Since that time, by  the author of these investigations then described, by the English  Admiralty, and by private firms, further experiments have been carried out,  some on a considerable scale, and all corroborative of the results  published in 1868. But nothing further has been done in utilizing these  discoveries until the recent exigencies of modern naval warfare have led  foreign nations to place a high value upon speed. Some makers of torpedo  boats have thus been induced to slacken the trammels of an older theory and  to apply a somewhat incomplete form of the author's reaction propeller for  gaining some portion of the notable performance of these hornets of the  deep. Just as in turbines a combination of impact and reaction produces the  maximum practical result, so in screw propellers does a corresponding gain  accompany the same construction.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    [Illustration: FIG. 2.]    _Turbines_.--While studying those effects produced by jets of water  impinging upon plain or concave surfaces corresponding to buckets of  turbines, it simplifies matters to separate these results due to impact  from others due to reaction. And it will be well at the outset to draw a  distinction between the nature of these two pressures, and to remind  ourselves of the laws which lie at the root and govern the whole question  under present consideration. Water obeys the laws of gravity, exactly like  every other body; and the velocity with which any quantity may be falling  is an expression of the full amount of work it contains. By a sufficiently  accurate practical rule this velocity is eight times the square root of the  head or vertical column measured in feet. Velocity per second = 8 sqrt  (head in feet), therefore, for a head of 100 ft. as an example, V = 8 sqrt  (100) = 80 ft. per second. The graphic method of showing velocities or  pressures has many advantages, and is used in all the following diagrams.  Beginning with purely theoretical considerations, we "]]]
