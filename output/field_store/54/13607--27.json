[Footnote 1: In _Central Italian Painters of the Renaissance_.]          II. ON BOOKS OF REFERENCE      Since the death of Millet, in 1875, much that is interesting and  valuable has been written of his life and work. The first biography  of the painter was that by his friend Sensier, in a large illustrated  volume whose contents have been made familiar to English readers by an  abridged translation published in this country simultaneously with  the issue of the French edition. Containing all the essential facts of  Millet's outward life, besides a great number of the artist's letters,  together with his autobiographical reminiscences of childhood,  Sensier's work is the principal source of information, from which all  later writers draw. Yet it is not an altogether fair and satisfactory  presentation of Millet's life. Undue emphasis is laid upon his  struggles with poverty, and the book leaves much to be desired.    Julia Cartwright's recent work, \"Jean Francois Millet: His Life and  Letters,\" is founded on Sensier's life, yet rounds out the study of  the master's character and work with the fuller knowledge with which  family and friends have described his career.    Another recent book called \"J.F. Millet and Rustic Art\" is by  Henry Naegely (published in England), and is critical rather than  biographical in purport. It is a sympathetic appreciation of Millet's  art and character, and grows out of a careful study of the painter's  works and an intimate connection with the Millet family.    Besides these books devoted exclusively to the subject, the life work  of Millet is admirably sketched in brief form in the following more  general works:--    Richard Muther's \"History of Modern Painting,\" Mrs. Stranahan's  \"History of French Painting,\" Rose G. Kingsley's \"History of French  Art,\" and D.C. Thomson's \"Barbizon School.\"    Of great importance to the student of Millet are the various articles  contributed to the magazines by those who knew and understood the  painter. The following are of special note: By Edward W. Wheelwright,  in \"The Atlantic Monthly,\" September, 1876; by Wyatt Eaton, in the  \"Century,\" May, 1889; by T.H. Bartlett, in \"Scribner's,\" May and June,  1890; by Pierre Millet, in \"Century,\" January, 1893, and April, 1894;  and by Will Low, in \"McClure's,\" May, 1896. Julia Cartwright, in the  preface to the above mentioned biography, mentions other magazine  articles not so generally accessible.          III. HISTORICAL DIRECTORY OF THE PICTURES OF THIS COLLECTION      _Portrait frontispiece_, a life-size crayon made by Millet in 1847  and given to his friend Charlier. It afterwards became the property of  Sensier..    1. _Going to Work_, one of several versions of the subject in  different mediums, oil, pastel, drawing, and etching. This picture was  painted in 1851, and was at one time (1891) in a private collection in  Glasgow.[1] It is to be distinguished from the picture of 1850, where  the woman carries a pitcher instead of a rope.[2]    2. _The Knitting Lesson_, a drawing corresponding in general  composition, with some changes of detail, to the small painting (17 by  14-1/2 in.) of the subject in the collection of Mrs. Martin Brimmer,  in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.    3. _The Potato Planters_, painted in 1862, and exhibited at the  great exhibition at Paris of that year, also again in 1867 at the  International Exhibition. It changed hands for large sums during  the painter's lifetime, and is now in the Quincy A. Shaw collection,  Boston, Mass.    4. _The Woman Sewing by Lamplight_, painted in 1872, and sold in 1873  for 38,500 francs, the highest price at that time ever paid for one of  Millet's works.    5. _The Shepherdess_, painted in 1862, and exhibited at the Salon of  1864, also again at the Exposition Universelle of 1867. It is now in  the collection of M. Chauchard.    6. _The Woman Feeding Hens_, a charcoal sketch, corresponding in  general composition to the description of a painting bearing the same  name, which was painted in 1854 for M. Letrone for 2000 francs.    7. _The Angelus_, an oil painting measuring 25 by 21 in. The first  drawing for the picture was sold February, 1858. The painting was  completed for exhibition in the Salon of 1859. It was declined by the  patron for whom it was intended, and finally sold to a Belgian artist  in 1860, and soon afterwards to the Belgian minister. The original  price was 2000 francs. The picture passed from one owner to another,  and in 1873 was bought by J.W. Wilson for 50,000 francs, later  bringing at the Wilson sale of 1881 the sum of L6400. In an auction  sale of the Secretan collection, July, 1889, there was an immense  excitement over the contest between the French government, represented  by M. Proust, Director of Fine Arts, and various American dealers, who  were determined to win the prize. It was finally knocked down to M.  Proust for 553,000 francs, but the French government refused to ratify  the purchase, and the picture was brought to the United States. Here  the customs duty exacted was so enormous (L7000) that the picture  remained only six months (the duty being waived during that period),  and after being exhibited throughout the country finally returned to  France, where it was purchased for L32,000 by M. Chauchard, who has  the finest collection of Millets in existence.    8. _Filling the Water-Bottles,_ a charcoal drawing, which attracted  much attention when exhibited in the Millet collection of the Paris  Exposition, 1889.    9. _Feeding Her Birds_, painted in 1860, and exhibited in Salon of  1861. Presented by a purchaser to the Museum of Lille in 1871.    10. _The Church at Greville_, sketched during Millet's visit at  Greville in the summer of 1871; referred to by him, in a letter of  1872, as still in process of painting; found in his studio at the  time of his death, in 1875. The picture was bought by the French  government, and is now in the Louvre, Paris.    11. _The Sower_, the second painting of the subject, painted in 1850,  and exhibited in the Salon of 1850-51. It is now in the Vanderbilt  collection, New York.    A pencil sketch of the Sower is in the collection of Millet's  drawings, at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.[3]    12. _The Gleaners_, a painting first exhibited at the Salon of 1867.  It was sold to M. Binder of l'Isle Adam for 2000 francs. In 1889 it  was purchased by Madame Pommeroy for 300,000 francs, and presented  to the Louvre, Paris. A pencil drawing of the three figures is in the  collection of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.    13. _The Milkmaid_, painted in 1871 from a sketch made in Greville.  Seen in Millet's studio in 1873 by Will Low, the American artist.    14. _The Woman Churning_, one of several versions of the subject, the  first of which appeared in 1870.    15. _The Man with the Hoe_, painted in 1862 and exhibited at the Salon  of 1863. Sold to a Belgian collector, and long in Brussels. It is now  owned by Mr. W.S. Crocker of San Francisco, Cal.      [Footnote 1: See D.C. Thomson's _Barbizon School_, pp. 226, 227.]    [Footnote 2: See Julia Cartwright, _Life and Letters of Jean Francois  Millet_, pp. 114,115.]    [Footnote 3: This is one of an interesting collection of drawings in  this museum, which also contains several original paintings by Millet,  a Shepherdess, seated, a portrait of the painter, and others. Other  fine Millets are in the private collections of Boston, where the  painter received early appreciation, owing to the enthusiasm of  William Morris Hunt, the painter, and such connoisseurs as Mr. Quincy  Shaw and Mr. Brimmer.]          IV.

Perhaps in the minor details of  fingers, toes, ears, etc., the camp may have been deficient, but  these slight omissions did not detract from their aggregate force. The  strongest man had but three fingers on his right hand; the best shot had  but one eye.    Such was the physical aspect of the men that were dispersed around  the cabin. The camp lay in a triangular valley between two hills and a  river. The only outlet was a steep trail over the summit of a hill that  faced the cabin, now illuminated by the rising moon. The suffering woman  might have seen it from the rude bunk whereon she lay,--seen it winding  like a silver thread until it was lost in the stars above.    A fire of withered pine boughs added sociability to the gathering. By  degrees the natural levity of Roaring Camp returned. Bets were freely  offered and taken regarding the result. Three to five that \"Sal would  get through with it;\" even that the child would survive; side bets as  to the sex and complexion of the coming stranger. In the midst of an  excited discussion an exclamation came from those nearest the door, and  the camp stopped to listen. Above the swaying and moaning of the pines,  the swift rush of the river, and the crackling of the fire rose a sharp,  querulous cry,--a cry unlike anything heard before in the camp. The  pines stopped moaning, the river ceased to rush, and the fire to  crackle. It seemed as if Nature had stopped to listen too.    The camp rose to its feet as one man! It was proposed to explode a  barrel of gunpowder; but in consideration of the situation of the  mother, better counsels prevailed, and only a few revolvers were  discharged; for whether owing to the rude surgery of the camp, or some  other reason, Cherokee Sal was sinking fast. Within an hour she had  climbed, as it were, that rugged road that led to the stars, and so  passed out of Roaring Camp, its sin and shame, forever. I do not think  that the announcement disturbed them much, except in speculation as  to the fate of the child. \"Can he live now?\" was asked of Stumpy. The  answer was doubtful. The only other being of Cherokee Sal's sex  and maternal condition in the settlement was an ass. There was some  conjecture as to fitness, but the experiment was tried. It was less  problematical than the ancient treatment of Romulus and Remus, and  apparently as successful.    When these details were completed, which exhausted another hour, the  door was opened, and the anxious crowd of men, who had already formed  themselves into a queue, entered in single file. Beside the low bunk or  shelf, on which the figure of the mother was starkly outlined below  the blankets, stood a pine table. On this a candle-box was placed,  and within it, swathed in staring red flannel, lay the last arrival at  Roaring Camp. Beside the candle-box was placed a hat. Its use was  soon indicated. \"Gentlemen,\" said Stumpy, with a singular mixture of  authority and EX OFFICIO complacency,--\"gentlemen will please pass in  at the front door, round the table, and out at the back door. Them as  wishes to contribute anything toward the orphan will find a hat handy.\"  The first man entered with his hat on; he uncovered, however, as he  looked about him, and so unconsciously set an example to the next. In  such communities good and bad actions are catching. As the procession  filed in comments were audible,--criticisms addressed perhaps rather  to Stumpy in the character of showman; \"Is that him?\" \"Mighty small  specimen;\" \"Has n't more 'n got the color;\" \"Ain't bigger nor a  derringer.\" The contributions were as characteristic: A silver tobacco  box; a doubloon; a navy revolver, silver mounted; a gold specimen; a  very beautifully embroidered lady's handkerchief (from Oakhurst the  gambler); a diamond breastpin; a diamond ring (suggested by the pin,  with the remark from the giver that he \"saw that pin and went two  diamonds better\"); a slung-shot; a Bible (contributor not detected); a  golden spur; a silver teaspoon (the initials, I regret to say, were not  the giver's); a pair of surgeon's shears; a lancet; a Bank of England  note for 5 pounds; and about $200 in loose gold and silver coin. During  these proceedings Stumpy maintained a silence as impassive as the dead  on his left, a gravity as inscrutable as that of the newly born on his  right. Only one incident occurred to break the monotony of the curious  procession. As Kentuck bent over the candle-box half curiously, the  child turned, and, in a spasm of pain, caught at his groping finger,  and held it fast for a moment. Kentuck looked foolish and embarrassed.  Something like a blush tried to assert itself in his weather-beaten  cheek. \"The damned little cuss!\" he said, as he extricated his finger,  with perhaps more tenderness and care than he might have been deemed  capable of showing. He held that finger a little apart from its fellows  as he went out, and examined it curiously. The examination provoked the  same original remark in regard to the child. In fact, he seemed to  enjoy repeating it. \"He rastled with my finger,\" he remarked to Tipton,  holding up the member, \"the damned little cuss!\"    It was four o'clock before the camp sought repose. A light burnt in the  cabin where the watchers sat, for Stumpy did not go to bed that night.  Nor did Kentuck. He drank quite freely, and related with great gusto his  experience, invariably ending with his characteristic condemnation of  the newcomer. It seemed to relieve him of any unjust implication of  sentiment, and Kentuck had the weaknesses of the nobler sex. When  everybody else had gone to bed, he walked down to the river and  whistled reflectingly. Then he walked up the gulch past the cabin,  still whistling with demonstrative unconcern. At a large redwood-tree he  paused and retraced his steps, and again passed the cabin. Halfway down  to the river's bank he again paused, and then returned and knocked at  the door. It was opened by Stumpy. \"How goes it?\" said Kentuck, looking  past Stumpy toward the candle-box. \"All serene!\" replied Stumpy.  \"Anything up?\" \"Nothing.\" There was a pause--an embarrassing one--Stumpy  still holding the door. Then Kentuck had recourse to his finger, which  he held up to Stumpy. \"Rastled with it,--the damned little cuss,\" he  said, and retired.    The next day Cherokee Sal had such rude sepulture as Roaring Camp  afforded. After her body had been committed to the hillside, there was  a formal meeting of the camp to discuss what should be done with her  infant. A resolution to adopt it was unanimous and enthusiastic. But an  animated discussion in regard to the manner and feasibility of providing  for its wants at once sprang up. It was remarkable that the argument  partook of none of those fierce personalities with which discussions  were usually conducted at Roaring Camp. Tipton proposed that they should  send the child to Red Dog,--a distance of forty miles,--where female  attention could be procured. But the unlucky suggestion met with fierce  and unanimous opposition. It was evident that no plan which entailed  parting from their new acquisition would for a moment be entertained.  \"Besides,\" said Tom Ryder, \"them fellows at Red Dog would swap it, and  ring in somebody else on us.\" A disbelief in the honesty of other camps  prevailed at Roaring Camp, as in other places.    The introduction of a female nurse in the camp also met with objection.  It was argued that no decent woman could be prevailed to accept Roaring  Camp as her home, and the speaker urged that \"they didn't want any more  of the other kind.\" This unkind allusion to the defunct mother, harsh as  it may seem, was the first spasm of propriety,--the first symptom of the  camp's regeneration. Stumpy advanced nothing. Perhaps he felt a certain  delicacy in interfering with the selection of a possible successor in  office. But when questioned, he averred stoutly that he and \"Jinny\"--the  mammal before alluded to--could manage to rear the child. There was  something original, independent, and heroic about the plan that pleased  the camp. Stumpy was retained. Certain articles were sent for to  Sacramento. \"Mind,\" said the treasurer, as he pressed a bag of gold-dust  into the expressman's hand, \"the best that can be got,--lace, you know,  and filigree-work and frills,--damn the cost!\"    Strange to say, the child thrived. Perhaps the invigorating climate of  the mountain camp was compensation for material deficiencies. Nature  took the foundling to her broader breast. In that rare atmosphere of the  Sierra foothills,--that air pungent with balsamic odor, that ethereal  cordial at once bracing and exhilarating,--he may have found food and  nourishment, or a subtle chemistry that transmuted ass's milk to lime  and phosphorus. Stumpy inclined to the belief that it was the latter  and good nursing. \"Me and that ass,\" he would say, \"has been father and  mother to him! Don't you,\" he would add, apostrophizing the helpless  bundle before him, \"never go back on us.\"    By the time he was a month old the necessity of giving him a name became  apparent. He had generally been known as \"The Kid,\" \"Stumpy's Boy,\"  \"The Coyote\" (an allusion to his vocal powers), and even by Kentuck's  endearing diminutive of \"The damned little cuss.\" But these were felt  to be vague and unsatisfactory, and were at last dismissed under another  influence. Gamblers and adventurers are generally superstitious, and  Oakhurst one day declared that the baby had brought \"the luck\" to  Roaring Camp. It was certain that of late they had been successful.  \"Luck\" was the name agreed upon, with the prefix of Tommy for greater  convenience. No allusion was made to the mother, and the father was  unknown. \"It's better,\" said the philosophical Oakhurst, \"to take a  fresh deal all round. Call him Luck, and start him fair.\" A day was  accordingly set apart for the christening. What was meant by this  ceremony the reader may"]]]
