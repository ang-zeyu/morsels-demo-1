Whence came this remarkable characteristic of the Egyptian  religion no man can say, and there is no evidence whatsoever to guide us  in formulating the theory that it was brought into Egypt by immigrants  from the East, as some have said, or that it was a natural product of  the indigenous peoples who formed the population of the valley of the  Nile some ten thousand years ago, according to the opinion of others.  All that is known is that it existed there at a period so remote that it  is useless to attempt to measure by years the interval of time which has  elapsed since it grew up and established itself in the minds of men, and  that it is exceedingly doubtful if we shall ever have any very definite  knowledge on this interesting point.    But though we know nothing about the period of the origin in Egypt of  the belief in the existence of an almighty God who was One, the  inscriptions show us that this Being was called by a name which was  something like _Neter_, [Footnote: There is no _e_ in Egyptian, and this  vowel is added merely to make the word pronounceable.] the picture sign  for which was an axe-head, made probably of stone, let into a long  wooden handle. The coloured picture character shews that the axe-head  was fastened into the handle by thongs of leather or string, and judging  by the general look of the object it must have been a formidable weapon  in strong, skilled hands. A theory has recently been put forward to the  effect that the picture character represents a stick with a bit of  coloured rag tied to the, but it will hardly commend itself to any  archaeologist. The lines which cross the side of the axe-head represent  string or strips of leather, and indicate that it was made of stone  which, being brittle, was liable to crack; the picture characters which  delineate the object in the latter dynasties shew that metal took the  place of the stone axe-head, and being tough the new substance needed no  support. The mightiest man in the prehistoric days was he who had the  best weapon, and knew how to wield it with the greatest effect; when the  prehistoric hero of many fights and victories passed to his rest, his  own or a similar weapon was buried with him to enable him to wage war  successfully in the next world. The mightiest man had the largest axe,  and the axe thus became the symbol of the mightiest man. As he, by  reason of the oft-told narrative of his doughty deeds at the prehistoric  camp fire at eventide, in course of time passed from the rank of a hero  to that of a god, the axe likewise passed from being the symbol of a  hero to that of a god. Far away back in the early dawn of civilization  in Egypt, the object which I identify as an axe may have had some other  signification, but if it had, it was lost long before the period of the  rule of the dynasties in that country.    Passing now to the consideration of the meaning of the name for God,  _neter_, we find that great diversity of opinion exists among  Egyptologists on the subject. Some, taking the view that the equivalent  of the word exists in Coptic, under the form of _Nuti_, and because  Coptic is an ancient Egyptian dialect, have sought to deduce its meaning  by seeking in that language for the root from which the word may be  derived. But all such attempts have had no good result, because the word  _Nuti_ stands by itself, and instead of being derived from a Coptic root  is itself the equivalent of the Egyptian _neter_, [Footnote: The letter  _r_ has dropped out in Coptic through phonetic decay.] and was taken  over by the translators of the Holy Scriptures from that language to  express the words \"God\" and \"Lord.\" The Coptic root _nomti_ cannot in  any way be connected with _nuti_, and the attempt to prove that the two  are related was only made with the view of helping to explain the  fundamentals of the Egyptian religion by means of Sanskrit and other  Aryan analogies. It is quite possible that the word _neter_ means  \"strength,\" \"power,\" and the like, but these are only some of its  derived meanings, and we have to look in the hieroglyphic inscriptions  for help in order to determine its most probable meaning. The eminent  French Egyptologist, E. de Rouge, connected the name of God, _neter_,  with the other word _neter_, \"renewal\" or \"renovation,\" and it would,  according to his view, seem as if the fundamental idea of God was that  of the Being who had the power to renew himself perpetually--or in other  words, \"self-existence.\" The late Dr. H. Brugsch partly accepted this  view, for he defined _neter_ as being \"the active power which produces  and creates things in regular recurrence; which bestows new life upon  them, and gives back to them their youthful vigour.\" [Footnote:  _Religion und Mythologie_, p. 93.] There seems to be no doubt that,  inasmuch as it is impossible to find any one word which will render  _neter_ adequately and satisfactorily, \"self-existence\" and \"possessing  the power to renew life indefinitely,\" may together be taken as the  equivalent of _neter_ in our own tongue, M. Maspero combats rightly the  attempt to make \"strong\" the meaning of _neter_ (masc.), or _neterit_  (fem.) in these words: \"In the expressions 'a town _neterit_ 'an arm  _neteri_,' ... is it certain that 'a strong city,' 'a strong arm,' give  us the primitive sense of _neter_? When among ourselves one says 'divine  music,' 'a piece of divine poetry,' 'the divine taste of a peach,' 'the  divine beauty of a woman,' [the word] divine is a hyperbole, but it  would be a mistake to declare that it originally meant 'exquisite'  because in the phrases which I have imagined one could apply it as  'exquisite music,' 'a piece of exquisite poetry,' 'the exquisite taste  of a peach,' 'the exquisite beauty of a woman.' Similarly, in Egyptian,  'a town _neterit_ is 'a divine town;' 'an arm _netsri_' is 'a divine  arm,' and _neteri_ is employed metaphorically in Egyptian as is [the  word] 'divine' in French, without its being any more necessary to  attribute to [the word] _neteri_ the primitive meaning of 'strong,' than  it is to attribute to [the word] 'divine' the primitive meaning of  'exquisite.'\" [Footnote: _La Mythologie Egyptienne_, p. 215.] It may be,  of course, that _neter_ had another meaning which is now lost, but it  seems that the great difference between God and his messengers and  created things is that he is the Being who is self-existent and  immortal, whilst they are not self-existent and are mortal.    Here it will be objected by those who declare that the ancient Egyptian  idea of God is on a level with that evolved by peoples and tribes who  stand comparatively little removed from very intelligent animals, that  such high conceptions as self-existence and immortality belong to a  people who are already on a high grade of development and civilization.  This is precisely the case with the Egyptians when we first know them.  As a matter of fact, we know nothing of their ideas of God before they  developed sufficiently to build the monuments which we know they built,  and before they possessed the religion, and civilization, and complex  social system which their writings have revealed to us. In the remotest  prehistoric times it is probable that their views about God and the  future life were little better than those of the savage tribes, now  living, with whom some have compared them. The primitive god was an  essential feature of the family, and the fortunes of the god varied with  the fortunes of the family; the god of the city in which a man lived was  regarded as the ruler of the city, and the people of that city no more  thought of neglecting to provide him with what they considered to be due  to his rank and position than they thought of neglecting to supply their  own wants. In fact the god of the city became the centre of the social  fabric of that city, and every inhabitant thereof inherited  automatically certain duties, the neglect of which brought stated pains  and penalties upon him. The remarkable peculiarity of the Egyptian  religion is that the primitive idea of the god of the city is always  cropping up in it, and that is the reason why we find semi-savage ideas  of God side by side with some of the most sublime conceptions, and it of  course underlies all the legends of the gods wherein they possess all  the attributes of men and women. The Egyptian in his semi-savage state  was neither better nor worse than any other man in the same stage of  civilization, but he stands easily first among the nations in his  capacity for development, and in his ability for evolving conceptions  concerning God and the future life, which are claimed as the peculiar  product of the cultured nations of our time.    We must now, however, see how the word for God, _neter_, is employed in  religious texts and in works which contain moral precepts. In the text  of Unas, [Footnote: Ed Maspero, _Pyramides de Saqqarah_; p. 25.] a king  who reigned about B.C. 3300, we find the passage:--\"That which is sent  by thy _ka_ cometh to thee, that which is sent by thy father cometh to  thee, that which is sent by R[=a] cometh to thee, and it arriveth in the  train of thy R[=a]. Thou art pure, thy bones are the gods and the  goddesses of heaven, thou existest at the side of God, thou art  unfastened, thou comest forth towards thy soul, for every evil word (or  thing) which hath been written in the name of Unas hath been done away.\"  And, again, in the text of Teta, [Footnote: _Ibid_., p. 113.] in the  passage which refers to the place in the eastern part of heaven \"where  the gods give birth unto themselves, where that to which they give birth  is born, and where they renew their youth,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11281"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 12, No. 334, (#2)"],[1,"my lover the Bulbul, all low and lone;    And the maid's soul-song, who forth hath crept,    When pale stars peer'd, and night flow'rs wept.      But oh! from the songs of Cashmire's vale,    The rose, the lute, and the nightingale,    From flow'rs, whose odours were _too_ divine;    From gems of beauty whose souls were mine;    From floating eyes, that could wound, yet bless,    In their warm, dark, deep, voluptuousness;    I'm come, in young iv'ry breasts to lie,    Betray'd like Love, by my luscious sigh!

M.L.B.      [1] Having, not long since, purchased a bottle of Persian Otto, warranted      _genuine_, (as is all) I laid it carefully by, wrapped thickly round      with cotton wool; the Atar which was certainly excellent, was in a      curious bottle of rough misshapen workmanship, but ornamented with      sundry circles, and lozenges, of various coloured glass. I was      inclined to regard this bottle as a more genuine specimen of oriental      art, than one of those, which, enamelled, with gold, stands forth in      its way an _elegant_ of the first water, and I hoped to have kept it      long. On visiting my Otto shortly afterwards, I found that not only      had it all evaporated, but destroyed its receptacle. Its strength (I      conclude) had dissolved the cement of the aforesaid coloured bits of      glass, and left me only an empty and plain bottle, the ugliest of the      ugly. I mention this circumstance as a caution to amateurs in Atar      Gul.           *       *       *       *       *      SHOOTING AT THE POPINJAY.    (_For the Mirror_.)      The Popinjay or Popingo (signifying painted bird) is a very favourite and  popular diversion in Denmark, and of which it may be interesting to give  some account. A society is constituted of various members, called the  \"King's Shooting Club,\" who have a code of laws and regulations drawn up  for their observance; and are under the direction of nine managers. The  entrance-money is 60 dollars. Members are admitted by ballot, and on  election receive a diploma on parchment, with the seal of the society.    The meetings are held in a large building in the environs, and members  are decorated with an order or badge of distinction, which is the figure  of a gilded bird with outstretched wings, perching on a branch of laurel.  This is worn on the left breast, and attached to a button-hole of the  waistcoat by a green silk riband. On the breast are marked the letters  \"_D.C._\" meaning \"_Danish Company_.\" On one side of the branch is the  date 1542, and on the other 1739.[2] In the month of August, when the  amusement commences, the members meet in their hall, and proceed in  formal procession to an adjoining field on the western side of the city;  where arrangements are previously made for the numerous spectators. The  bird to be shot at is about the size of a parrot, gilded, and placed on  the top of a high pole. On their way to the field they are attended by a  band of music, which precedes the members as they march with their pieces  over their shoulders.    According to a law of the institution, the competitors fire at this mark  with large rifle pieces charged with balls, and rested on triangular  stands. Whoever is so fortunate as to strike the wing of the Popingo  first, is entitled to a prize. This is sometimes a pair of handsome  candlesticks, or a silver tea-pot and spoons. Whoever hits the tail is  entitled to another prize not inferior to the last; but he who wounds the  body of the bird is complimented with the principal one which weighs at  least 65 ounces of silver, and is honoured with the title of the \"BIRD  KING.\" These prizes are surmounted with the royal cipher and crown. His  Danish majesty opens this ceremony in person, and is entitled to the  first shot, and the queen to the second, then they are followed by the  other branches of the royal family in succession. The firing continues  until the bird falls. In returning to the hall, the \"Bird King,\"  accompanied by the procession, first enters the room, and is placed at  the head of the table laid out for an entertainment, even in the presence  of his majesty. On this occasion he is understood to be invested with  peculiar privileges, such as proposing toasts, directing the order of the  feast, &c. and his own health is first given by the judges. The members  pay 100 dollars each. The festival is honoured by the presence of the  royal family, and no person excepting the members, the foreign ministers,  and other distinguished persons, who are specially invited, can be  admitted.    The practice of shooting at the Popingo or Popinjay, however, is not  peculiar to Denmark. In Scotland a nearly similar amusement is observed,  where the head marksman receives the title of \"Captain.\" In a future  paper, perhaps, I may notice the subject again, as it may prove  interesting.    W.H.H.      [2] I imagine this to mean the time of the introduction of the sport, and      the year when the company was instituted.           *       *       *       *       *      IMMENSE TROUT.    (_To the Editor of the Mirror._)      In No. 331 of the MIRROR, I observed an article on Trout-fishing in  Westmoreland. The writer states, that the largest trout ever caught in  that county weighed four pounds and a half. This circumstance induces me  to send you the annexed account respecting trout in Kent.    The county of Kent affords a vast number of trout-streams, which are  nowhere surpassed in England; and fish of extraordinary size and beauty  have frequently been caught in them. Some years ago, at Farningham, (a  village through which a noble trout-stream takes its course), stood a  flour-mill, the proprietor of which informed my father, that he had often  observed an enormous trout in the stream, near the mill-head, and that he  would endeavour to catch it, in order to ascertain its real dimensions,  as he was very desirous to have a picture done from it. My father having  consented to undertake the picture, the proprietor caused the trout,  though with much difficulty, to be caught in a stub-net. It appeared of a  most beautiful colour, and was finely variegated with spots; but it  possessed such exceeding strength, that the assistance of two men was  necessary to hold it down on a table while the measurement was made. It  proved to be twenty-six inches in length, and weighed _nine pounds_. The  proprietor returned it to the water unhurt, for he would by no means  suffer it to be killed, but caused food from time to time to be thrown  into the stream. This food chiefly consisted of meal and flour, made into  small balls, which allured the trout to remain near the mill-head. When  the particulars concerning this remarkable fish were circulated, many  persons came from different parts of Kent, and even from London, to  obtain a sight of it.    Numerous individuals now living at Farningham can attest the truth of  this account; and, probably, the painting may still be seen at that place.  _September_ 20, 1828.

Coule gentil ruisseau, car ton cours est l'image    D'un beau jour ecoule dans le sein du bonheur.    J. J. ROUSSEAU.      IMITATED FROM THE ABOVE.        Flow, gentle stream, thy course pursue      Beneath the shade of waving bowers,    Where sunbeams lightly glancing through,      The dew-drops kiss from off the flowers.      Thy murmurs charm the list'ning ear,      And soothe the senses to repose--    No wayward passion rages here,      The heart no throbbing tumult knows.      Thy waters, as they glide along,      Reflect but images of peace,    Emblem of days, too swiftly flown,      Pass'd in the midst of happiness.      Flow on, fair stream, thy course pursue      Beneath the shade of waving bowers,    Where sunbeams lightly glancing through,      Kiss the bright dew from off the flowers.    S.N.           *       *       *       *       *      NATIONAL VARIETIES.    (_Continued from page_ 165.)      It is almost impossible to lay down any rule which would define the  variations of national manners as having any reference to climate. We  frequently find that the passage of a river, or a chain of mountains,  dividing countries of the same natural features, brings us among an  entirely new people, and presents us with a fresh scene in the melodrama  of life. The inhabitants of Languedoc and Gascony, and the southern parts  of France, are the gayest and most lively of the subjects of Charles X.;  but the moment we have crossed the Pyrenees, we are among one of the  gravest nations in the world, the Spaniards. Again, contrast the  solemnity and deep sense of honour of the Turks, with the vivacity and,  we regret to add, the deceit and bad faith of the unfortunate modern  Greeks. The virtuous spirit will, we trust, revive in the Morea with the  return of civilization and freedom; for, as no one will attribute the  degradation of the modern Greeks from the high moral cultivation of their  ancestors, to any alteration in the climate of their country, so let us  never despair of the return of virtue, of poetry, of the arts and  sciences, whilst Parnassus and Helicon still enjoy the same glorious sun,  and whilst the Isles are still gilded by eternal summer. We want no  proofs that patriotism still lives in Greece, and with that feeling will  ever be associated the powers that are able to invigorate a nation.    Although a"]]]
