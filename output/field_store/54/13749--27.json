Raise the forefinger of the right hand, as the index or pointing finger.    3. Place the index finger upon the lower thumb joint of the left hand.    4. Draw the index finger down to the wrist, over the bone between the thumb  knuckle and the wrist, and count \"One.\"    5. Place the index finger on the knuckle of the first finger.    6. Draw the index finger down to the wrist, over the bone leading from the  first finger to the wrist, and count \"Two.\"    7. So on, for each of the three other bones of the hand. Repeat until no  mistake is made in touching or counting.    II.    1. Raise the thumb, and place the index finger of the right hand on the  middle of the upper part of the thumb for bone \"Six\"; then    2. On the lower part of the thumb for bone \"Seven.\" Repeat from the  beginning, until the children can touch and count each bone properly.    III.    1. Keep the thumb erect; raise the first finger of the left hand.    2. Place the index finger on the bone between the tip and the first joint  of the first finger for bone \"Eight.\"    3. Between the first and middle joint for bone \"Nine.\"    4. Between the middle and third joint for bone \"Ten.\" Review, from the  beginning, until the class can touch and count every bone as directed.    IV.    1. Keep the thumb and forefinger erect; raise the second finger and touch,  as in the lesson on the first finger bones, \"Eleven,\" \"Twelve,\" and  \"Thirteen.\" Review.    2. Proceed in the same manner for the third and fourth fingers, always  beginning with the bone nearest the tip of the finger, and touching that at  the lowest part last.    If the exercise has been properly performed, every child will say  \"Nineteen\" as its index finger touches the lowest bone of the little  finger, and all the fingers of every left hand will be outspread.           *       *       *       *       *    THE BONES    OF THE HEAD:  Skull                                      8  Face, including the lower jaw             14  Tongue                                     1  Ears                                       8                                          ----                                            31  OF THE TRUNK:  Spine                                     24  Ribs                                      24  Breastbone                                 8  Shoulder blades                            2  Collar bones                               2                                          ----                                            60  OF THE UPPER LIMBS:  Upper arms                         1 x 2 = 2  Fore-arms                          2 x 2 = 4  Wrists                            8 x 2 = 16  Hands                            19 x 2 = 38                                          ----                                            60  OF THE LOWER LIMBS:  Thighs                             1 x 2 = 2  Knee-pans                          1 x 2 = 2  Lower legs                         2 x 2 = 4  Feet                             26 x 2 = 52                                          ----                                            60    Total, 211, not including the teeth.[1]    We teach the children to say \"about two hundred,\" because there is not  always the same number of bones in the body.

When I became thoroughly convinced of this, I was transformed from  an amateur into a professional in a single day. I now began to take care  of myself, learn good habits, and endeavored to cultivate my mind as  well as my voice. The conviction gradually grew upon me that if I  studied and worked, I would be able one day to sing in such a way as to  satisfy myself.\"      THE VALUE OF WORK TO THE SINGER    Caruso believes in the necessity for work, and sends this message to all  ambitious students: \"To become a singer requires work, work, and again  work! It need not be in any special corner of the earth; there is no one  spot that will do more for you than other places. It doesn't matter so  much where you are, if you have intelligence and a good ear. Listen to  yourself; your ear will tell you what kind of tones you are making. If  you will only use your own intelligence you can correct your own  faults.\"      CEASELESS STUDY    This is no idle speech, voiced to impress the reader. Caruso practices  what he preaches, for he is an incessant worker. Two or three hours in  the forenoon, and several more later in the day, whenever possible. He  does not neglect daily vocal technic, scales and exercises. There are  always many roles to keep in rehearsal with the accompanist. He has a  repertoire of seventy roles, some of them learned in two languages.  Among the parts he has prepared but has never sung are: _Othello, Fra  Diavolo, Eugen Onegin, Pique Dame, Falstaff_ and _Jewels of the  Madonna_.    Besides the daily review of opera roles, Caruso examines many new songs;  every day brings a generous supply. Naturally some of these find their  way into the waste basket; some are preserved for reference, while the  favored ones which are accepted must be studied for use in recital.    I had the privilege, recently, of spending a good part of one forenoon  in Mr. Caruso's private quarters at his New York Hotel, examining a  whole book full of mementos of the Jubilee celebration of March, 1919,  on the occasion when the great tenor completed twenty-five years of  activity on the operatic stage. Here were gathered telegrams and  cablegrams from all over the world. Many letters and cards of greeting  and congratulation are preserved in this portly volume. Among them one  noticed messages from Mme. Schumann-Heink, the Flonzaley Quartet,  Cleofonte Campanini and hosts of others. Here, too, is preserved the  Jubilee Programme booklet, also the libretto used on that gala occasion.  Music lovers all over the world will echo the hope that this wonderful  voice may be preserved for many years to come!      A LAST WORD    The above article was shown to Mr. Caruso, at his request, and I was  asked a few days later to come to him. There had been the usual  rehearsal at the Opera House that day. \"Ah, those rehearsals,\" exclaimed  the secretary, stopping his typewriter for an instant; \"no one who has  never been through it has any idea of what a rehearsal means.\" And he  lifted hands and eyes expressively. \"Mr. Caruso rose at eight, went to  rehearsal at ten and did not finish till after three. He is now resting,  but will see you in a moment.\"    Presently the great tenor opened the door and entered. He wore a  lounging coat of oriental silk, red bordered, and on the left hand  gleamed a wonderful ring, a broad band of dull gold, set with diamonds,  rubies and sapphires. He shook hands, said he had read my story, that it  was quite correct and had his entire approval.    \"And have you a final message to the young singers who are struggling  and longing to sing some day as wonderfully as you do?\"    \"Tell them to study, to work always,--and--to sacrifice!\"    His eyes had a strange, inscrutable light in them, as he doubtless  recalled his own early struggles, and life of constant effort.    And so take his message to heart:    \"Work, work--and--sacrifice!\"          II    =GERALDINE FARRAR=    THE WILL TO SUCCEED A COMPELLING FORCE      \"To measure the importance of Geraldine Farrar (at the Metropolitan  Opera House, New York) one has only to think of the void there would  have been during the last decade, and more, if she had not been there.  Try to picture the period between 1906 and 1920 without Farrar--it is  inconceivable! Farrar, more than any other singer, has been the  triumphant living symbol of the new day for the American artist at the  Metropolitan. She paved the way. Since that night, in 1906, when her  Juliette stirred the staid old house, American singers have been added  year by year to the personnel. Among these younger singers there are  those who will admit at once that it was the success of Geraldine Farrar  which gave them the impetus to work hard for a like success.\"    [Illustration: GERALDINE FARRAR]    These thoughts have been voiced by a recent reviewer, and will find a  quick response from young singers all over the country, who have been  inspired by the career of this representative artist, and by the  thousands who have enjoyed her singing and her many characterizations.    I was present on the occasion of Miss Farrar's debut at the greatest  opera house of her home land. I, too, was thrilled by the fresh young  voice in the girlish and charming impersonation of Juliette. It is a  matter of history that from the moment of her auspicious return to  America she has been constantly before the public, from the beginning to  end of each operatic season. Other singers often come for part of the  season, step out and make room for others. But Miss Farrar, as well as  Mr. Caruso, can be depended on to remain.    Any one who gives the question a moment's thought, knows that such a  career, carried through a score of years, means constant, unremitting  labor. There must be daily work on vocal technic; repertoire must be  kept up to opera pitch, and last and perhaps most important of all, new  works must be sought, studied and assimilated.    The singer who can accomplish these tasks will have little or no time  for society and the gay world, inasmuch as her strength must be devoted  to the service of her art. She must keep healthy hours, be always ready  to appear, and never disappoint her audiences. And such, according to  Miss Farrar's own words is her record in the service of art.    While zealously guarding her time from interruption from the merely  curious, Miss Farrar does not entrench herself behind insurmountable  barriers, as many singers seem to do, so that no honest seeker for her  views of study and achievement can find her. While making a rule not to  try voices of the throng of young singers who would like to have her  verdict on their ability and prospects, Miss Farrar is very gracious to  those who really need to see her. Again--unlike others--she will make an  appointment a couple of weeks in advance, and one can rest assured she  will keep that appointment to the day and hour, in spite of many  pressing calls on her attention.    To meet and talk for an hour with an artist who has so often charmed you  from the other side of the footlights, is a most interesting experience.  In the present instance it began with my being taken up to Miss Farrar's  private sanctum, at the top of her New York residence. Though this is  her den, where she studies and works, it is a spacious parlor, where all  is light, color, warmth and above all, _quiet_. A thick crimson carpet  hushes the footfall. A luxurious couch piled with silken cushions, and  comfortable arm chairs are all in the same warm tint; over the grand  piano is thrown a cover of red velvet, gold embroidered. Portraits of  artists and many costly trifles are scattered here and there. The young  lady who acts as secretary happened to be in the room and spoke with  enthusiasm of the singer's absorption in her work, her delight in it,  her never failing energy and good spirits. \"From the day I heard Miss  Farrar sing I felt drawn to her and hoped the time would come when I  could serve her in some way. I did not know then that it would be in  this way. Her example is an inspiration to all who come in touch with  her.\"    In a few moments Miss Farrar herself appeared, and the young girl  withdrew.    And was this Farrar who stood before me, in the flush of vigorous  womanhood, and who welcomed me so graciously? The first impression was  one of friendliness and sincerity, which caused the artist for the  moment to be forgotten in the unaffected simplicity of the woman.    Miss Farrar settled herself comfortably among the red silk cushions and  was ready for our talk. The simplicity of manner was reflected in her  words. She did not imply--there is only one right way, and I have found  it. \"These things seem best for my voice, and this is the way I work.  But, since each voice is different, they might not fit any one else. I  have no desire to lay down rules for others; I can only speak of my own  experience.\"      THE QUESTION OF HEALTH    \"And you would first know how I keep strong and well and always ready?  Perhaps the answer is, I keep regular hours and habits, and love my  work. I have always loved to sing, as far back as I can remember. Music  means everything to me--it is my life. As a child and young girl, I was  the despair of my playmates because I would not join their games; I did  not care to skate, play croquet or tennis, or such things. I never  wanted to exercise violently, and, to me, unnecessarily, because it  interfered with my singing; took energy which I thought might be better  applied. As I grew older I did not care to keep late hours and be in an  atmosphere where people smoked and perhaps drank, for these things were  bad for my voice and I could not do my work next day. My time is always  regularly laid out. I rise at half past seven, and am ready to work at  nine."]]]
