At length time being called, say twenty minutes to eleven, and Mr.  Jorrocks, Nodding Homer, and the principal subscribers having cast up,  the hounds approach the cover. \"Yooi in there!\" shouts Tom Hills, who  has long hunted this crack pack; and crack! crack! crack! go the whips  of some scores of sportsmen. \"Yelp, yelp, yelp,\" howl the hounds; and in  about a quarter of an hour Tom has not above four or five couple at his  heels. This number being a trifle, Tom runs his prad at a gap in the  fence by the wood-side; the old nag goes well at it, but stops short at  the critical moment, and, instead of taking the ditch, bolts and wheels  round. Tom, however, who is \"large in the boiling pieces,\" as they say  at Whitechapel, is prevented by his weight from being shaken out of his  saddle; and, being resolved to take no denial, he lays the crop of his  hunting-whip about the head of his beast, and runs him at the same spot  a second time, with an _obligato_ accompaniment of his spur-rowels,  backed by a \"curm along then!\" issued in such a tone as plainly informs  his quadruped he is in no joking humour. These incentives succeed in  landing Tom and his nag in the wished-for spot, when, immediately,  the wood begins to resound with shouts of \"Yoicks True-bo-y, yoicks  True-bo-y, yoicks push him up, yoicks wind him!\" and the whole pack  begin to work like good 'uns. Occasionally may be heard the howl of some  unfortunate hound that has been caught in a fox trap, or taken in a hare  snare; and not unfrequently the discordant growls of some three or  four more, vociferously quarrelling over the venerable remains of some  defunct rabbit. \"Oh, you rogues!\" cries Mr. Jorrocks, a cit rapturously  fond of the sport. After the lapse of half an hour the noise in the wood  for a time increases audibly. 'Tis Tom chastising the gourmands. Another  quarter of an hour, and a hound that has finished his coney bone slips  out of the wood, and takes a roll upon the greensward, opining, no  doubt, that such pastime is preferable to scratching his hide among  brambles in the covers. \"Hounds have no right to opine,\" opines the head  whipper-in; so clapping spurs into his prad, he begins to pursue the  delinquent round the common, with \"Markis, Markis! what are you at,  Markis? get into cover, Markis!\" But \"it's no go\"; Marquis creeps  through a hedge, and \"grins horribly a ghastly smile\" at his ruthless  tormentor, who wends back, well pleased at having had an excuse for  taking \"a bit gallop\"! Half an hour more slips away, and some of  the least hasty of our cits begin to wax impatient, in spite of the  oft-repeated admonition, \"don't be in a hurry!\" At length a yokel pops  out of the cover, and as soon as he has recovered breath, informs the  field that he has been \"a-hollorin' to 'em for half an hour,\" and that  the fox had \"gone away for Tatsfield, 'most as soon as ever the 'oounds  went into 'ood.\"    All is now hurry-scurry--girths are tightened--reins gathered  up--half-munched sandwiches thrust into the mouth--pocket-pistols  applied to--coats comfortably buttoned up to the throat; and, these  preparations made, away goes the whole field, \"coolly and fairly,\" along  the road to Leaves Green and Crown Ash Hill--from which latter spot, the  operations of the pack in the bottom may be comfortably and securely  viewed--leaving the whips to flog as many hounds out of cover as they  can, and Tom to entice as many more as are willing to follow the \"twang,  twang, twang\" of his horn.    And now, a sufficient number of hounds having been seduced from the  wood, forth sallies \"Tummas,\" and making straight for the spot where our  yokel's \"mate\" stands leaning on his plough-stilts, obtains from him the  exact latitude and longitude of the spot where reynard broke through the  hedge. To this identical place is the pack forthwith led; and, no sooner  have they reached it, than the wagging of their sterns clearly shows how  genuine is their breed. Old Strumpet, at length, first looking up in  Tom's face for applause, ventures to send forth a long-drawn howl,  which, coupled with Tom's screech, setting the rest agog, away they all  go, like beans; and the wind, fortunately setting towards Westerham,  bears the melodious sound to the delighted ears of our \"roadsters,\" who,  forthwith catching the infection, respond with deafening shouts and  joyous yells, set to every key, and disdaining the laws of harmony.  Thus, what with Tom's horn, the holloaing of the whips, and the shouts  of the riders, a very pretty notion may be formed of what Virgil calls:      \"Clamorque virum, clangorque tubarum.\"    A terrible noise is the result!    At the end of nine minutes or so, the hounds come to fault in the  bottom, below the blacksmith's, at Crown Ash Hill, and the fox has a  capital chance; in fact, they have changed for the blacksmith's tom cat,  which rushed out before them, and finding their mistake, return at their  leisure. This gives the most daring of the field, on the eminence, an  opportunity of descending to view the sport more closely; and being  assembled in the bottom, each congratulates his neighbour on the  excellent condition and stanchness of the hounds, and the admirable view  that has been afforded them of their peculiar style of hunting. At this  interesting period, a \"regular swell\" from Melton Mowbray, unknown to  everyone except his tailor, to whom he owes a long tick, makes his  appearance and affords abundance of merriment for our sportsmen. He  is just turned out of the hands of his valet, and presents the very  beau-ideal of his caste--\"quite the lady,\" in fact. His hat is stuck on  one side, displaying a profusion of well-waxed ringlets; a corresponding  infinity of whisker, terminating at the chin, there joins an enormous  pair of moustaches, which give him the appearance of having caught the  fox himself and stuck its brush below his nose. His neck is very stiff;  and the exact Jackson-like fit of his coat, which almost nips him in two  at the waist, and his superlatively well-cleaned leather Andersons,[2]  together with the perfume and the general puppyism of his appearance,  proclaim that he is a \"swell\" of the very first water, and one that a  Surrey sportsman would like to buy at his own price and sell at the  other's. In addition to this, his boots, which his \"fellow\" has  just denuded from a pair of wash-leather covers, are of the finest,  brightest, blackest patent leather imaginable; the left one being the  identical boot by which Warren's monkey shaved himself, while the right  is the one at which the game-cock pecked, mistaking its own shadow for  an opponent, the mark of its bill being still visible above the instep;  and the tops--whose pampered appetites have been fed on champagne--are  of the most delicate cream-colour, the whole devoid of mud or speck. The  animal he bestrides is no less calculated than himself to excite the  risible faculties of the field, being a sort of mouse colour, with dun  mane and tail, got by Nicolo, out of a flibbertigibbet mare, and he  stands seventeen hands and an inch. His head is small and blood-like,  his girth a mere trifle, and his legs, very long and spidery, of course  without any hair at the pasterns to protect them from the flints; his  whole appearance bespeaking him fitter to run for half-mile hunters'  stakes at Croxton Park or Leicester, than contend for foxes' brushes in  such a splendid country as the Surrey. There he stands, with his tail  stuck tight between his legs, shivering and shaking for all the world as  if troubled with a fit of ague. And well he may, poor beast, for--oh,  men of Surrey, London, Kent, and Middlesex, hearken to my word--on  closer inspection he proves to have been shaved!!![3]    [Footnote 2: Anderson, of South Audley Street, is, or was, a famous  breeches-maker.]    [Footnote 3: Shaving was in great vogue at Melton some seasons back. It  was succeeded by clipping, and clipping by singeing.]    After a considerable time spent in casting to the right, the left, and  the rear, \"True-bouy\" chances to take a fling in advance, and hitting  upon the scent, proclaims it with his wonted energy, which drawing all  his brethren to the spot, they pick it slowly over some brick-fields and  flint-beds, to an old lady's flower-garden, through which they carry it  with a surprising head into the fields beyond, when they begin to fall  into line, and the sportsmen doing the same--\"one at a time and it will  last the longer\"--\"Tummas\" tootles his horn, the hunt is up, and away  they all rattle at \"Parliament pace,\" as the hackney-coachmen say.    Our swell, who flatters himself he can \"ride a few,\" according to the  fashion of his country, takes up a line of his own, abreast of the  leading hounds, notwithstanding the oft vociferated cry of \"Hold hard,  sir!\" \"Pray, hold hard, sir!\" \"For God's sake, hold hard, sir!\" \"G--d  d--n you, hold hard, sir!\" \"Where the h--ll are you going to, sir?\" and  other familiar inquiries and benedictions, with which a stranger is  sometimes greeted, who ventures to take a look at a strange pack of  hounds.    In the meantime the fox, who has often had a game at romps with his  pursuers, being resolved this time to give them a tickler, bears"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15399"],[0,"The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, Or Gustavus Vassa, The (#2)"],[1,"     George Rose, Esq.

People generally think those memoirs only worthy to be read or  remembered which abound in great or striking events, those, in short,  which in a high degree excite either admiration or pity: all others  they consign to contempt and oblivion. It is therefore, I confess, not  a little hazardous in a private and obscure individual, and a stranger  too, thus to solicit the indulgent attention of the public; especially  when I own I offer here the history of neither a saint, a hero, nor a  tyrant. I believe there are few events in my life, which have not  happened to many: it is true the incidents of it are numerous; and,  did I consider myself an European, I might say my sufferings were  great: but when I compare my lot with that of most of my countrymen, I  regard myself as a _particular favourite of Heaven_, and acknowledge  the mercies of Providence in every occurrence of my life. If then the  following narrative does not appear sufficiently interesting to engage  general attention, let my motive be some excuse for its publication. I  am not so foolishly vain as to expect from it either immortality or  literary reputation. If it affords any satisfaction to my numerous  friends, at whose request it has been written, or in the smallest  degree promotes the interests of humanity, the ends for which it was  undertaken will be fully attained, and every wish of my heart  gratified. Let it therefore be remembered, that, in wishing to avoid  censure, I do not aspire to praise.    That part of Africa, known by the name of Guinea, to which the trade  for slaves is carried on, extends along the coast above 3400 miles,  from the Senegal to Angola, and includes a variety of kingdoms. Of  these the most considerable is the kingdom of Benen, both as to extent  and wealth, the richness and cultivation of the soil, the power of its  king, and the number and warlike disposition of the inhabitants. It is  situated nearly under the line, and extends along the coast about 170  miles, but runs back into the interior part of Africa to a distance  hitherto I believe unexplored by any traveller; and seems only  terminated at length by the empire of Abyssinia, near 1500 miles from  its beginning. This kingdom is divided into many provinces or  districts: in one of the most remote and fertile of which, called  Eboe, I was born, in the year 1745, in a charming fruitful vale, named  Essaka. The distance of this province from the capital of Benin and  the sea coast must be very considerable; for I had never heard of  white men or Europeans, nor of the sea: and our subjection to the king  of Benin was little more than nominal; for every transaction of the  government, as far as my slender observation extended, was conducted  by the chiefs or elders of the place. The manners and government of a  people who have little commerce with other countries are generally  very simple; and the history of what passes in one family or village  may serve as a specimen of a nation. My father was one of those elders  or chiefs I have spoken of, and was styled Embrenche; a term, as I  remember, importing the highest distinction, and signifying in our  language a _mark_ of grandeur. This mark is conferred on the person  entitled to it, by cutting the skin across at the top of the forehead,  and drawing it down to the eye-brows; and while it is in this  situation applying a warm hand, and rubbing it until it shrinks up  into a thick _weal_ across the lower part of the forehead. Most of the  judges and senators were thus marked; my father had long born it: I  had seen it conferred on one of my brothers, and I was also  _destined_ to receive it by my parents. Those Embrence, or chief men,  decided disputes and punished crimes; for which purpose they always  assembled together. The proceedings were generally short; and in most  cases the law of retaliation prevailed. I remember a man was brought  before my father, and the other judges, for kidnapping a boy; and,  although he was the son of a chief or senator, he was condemned to  make recompense by a man or woman slave. Adultery, however, was  sometimes punished with slavery or death; a punishment which I believe  is inflicted on it throughout most of the nations of Africa[A]: so  sacred among them is the honour of the marriage bed, and so jealous  are they of the fidelity of their wives. Of this I recollect an  instance:--a woman was convicted before the judges of adultery, and  delivered over, as the custom was, to her husband to be punished.  Accordingly he determined to put her to death: but it being found,  just before her execution, that she had an infant at her breast; and  no woman being prevailed on to perform the part of a nurse, she was  spared on account of the child. The men, however, do not preserve the  same constancy to their wives, which they expect from them; for they  indulge in a plurality, though seldom in more than two. Their mode of  marriage is thus:--both parties are usually betrothed when young by  their parents, (though I have known the males to betroth themselves).  On this occasion a feast is prepared, and the bride and bridegroom  stand up in the midst of all their friends, who are assembled for the  purpose, while he declares she is thenceforth to be looked upon as his  wife, and that no other person is to pay any addresses to her. This is  also immediately proclaimed in the vicinity, on which the bride  retires from the assembly. Some time after she is brought home to her  husband, and then another feast is made, to which the relations of  both parties are invited: her parents then deliver her to the  bridegroom, accompanied with a number of blessings, and at the same  time they tie round her waist a cotton string of the thickness of a  "]]]
