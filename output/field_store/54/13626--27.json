On the first and  second stories are the family apartments, opening on either side from  great halls, of the same extent as that below, but with loftier roofs,  of heavy rafters gilded or painted. The fourth floor is of the same  arrangement, but has a lower roof, and was devoted to the better class  of servants. Of the two stories used by the family, the third is the  loftier and airier, and was occupied in summer; the second was  the winter apartment. On either hand the rooms open in suites.  The courtyard at the rear usually had a well in its centre with an  ornamental curb; and access to the upper floors of the house was  gained by an exterior staircase in the court, which was often  elaborately enriched with carved ornament.    The materials used in construction are mostly red and white marbles,  used with a fine color sense, and the desire for abundance of color  was frequently further gratified by painting the exterior walls with  elaborate pictorial decorations.    [Illustration: II. The Palazzo Contarini Fasan, Venice.]    The earliest palaces are Byzantine, but with the growth of the Gothic  movement these were gradually superseded, although the Gothic  influence worked more slowly here than on the mainland. The richest  and most elaborate work was built at this period. Finally the  Renaissance took the place of Gothic; and the later palaces, built in  this style, show strongly the debased condition into which the art of  Venice fell in the Dark Ages.    We have selected for the illustrations of this number of the BROCHURE  SERIES some of the most widely known examples of the fifteenth-century  Gothic palaces, built at the time when Venice was at the zenith of  prosperity as the principal commercial power of the world.          I.    SOUTHWEST ANGLE OF THE DUCAL PALACE, VENICE.      Although the Ducal Palace is much larger than the other palaces of  Venice, and intended for general civic uses as well as a residence for  the Duke or Doge, it follows closely the type already described. It  has undergone so many changes since its first foundation in about the  year 800 (813 according to Ruskin), having been destroyed five times,  and as often re-erected in grander style, besides having been added to  and the dilapidated portions restored, that it is impossible to assign  a comprehensive date to cover the building of the present structure.  In fact, the earliest portion was gradually added to, carrying it  further and further around the quadrangle until it reached the point  of beginning, when this process was repeated, partially replacing  the older Byzantine work with Gothic and then with Renaissance, the  present building still having examples of all three styles.    The portion shown in our illustration is said to have been erected  between the years 1424 and 1442, by Giovanni Buon and his sons  Pantaleone and Bartolommeo Buon the elder; although Mr. Ruskin states  that in 1423 the Grand Council sat in the Great Council Chamber for  the first time, and in that year the Gothic Ducal Palace of Venice was  completed.    This angle, which faces the Piazetta and the Riva, is called by  Mr. Ruskin the \"Fig-Tree Angle,\" because of the group of sculpture  representing the fall of man. The figure above the angle capital of  the upper arcade is that of Gabriel. The richly decorated capitals of  the lower arcade represent personifications of the Virtues and Vices,  the favorite subjects of decorative art, at this period, in all the  cities of Italy. The capitals of the upper arcade, no two of which are  alike, are also richly wrought with figure sculpture, the one on the  angle containing representations of the four winds.    The arrangement of the tracery above the upper arcade is worthy of  note as the placing of the quatrefoils between the arches, which  is characteristic of earlier examples, is more reasonable, from a  constructive point of view, than the later practice of placing them  above the centres of the arches.    The use of the rope moulding as a decorative finish for the angle of a  building is also characteristic of the palace architecture of Venice,  and may here be seen most effectively applied.          II.    THE PALAZZO CONTARINI FASAN, VENICE.      This is one of the most notable examples of domestic Gothic  architecture in Venice, and dates from the fifteenth century. Ruskin  refers to it as follows: \"In one respect, however, it deserves to be  regarded with attention, as showing how much beauty and dignity may  be bestowed on a very small and unimportant dwelling-house by Gothic  sculpture. Foolish criticisms upon it have appeared in English  accounts of foreign buildings, objecting to it on the ground of its  being 'ill proportioned'; the simple fact being that there was no room  in this part of the canal for a wider house, and that its builder made  its rooms as comfortable as he could, and its windows and balconies of  a convenient size for those who were to see through them and stand on  them, and left the 'proportions' outside to take care of themselves,  which, indeed, they have very sufficiently done; for though the house  thus honestly confesses its diminutiveness, it is nevertheless one of  the principal ornaments of the very noblest reach of the Grand Canal,  and would be nearly as great a loss if it were destroyed, as the  church of La Salute itself.\"    This building is popularly known as \"Desdemona's House.\"          III.    THE PALAZZO CAVALLI, VENICE.      This palace, situated opposite the Academy of Arts on the Grand Canal,  also dates from the fifteenth century. Its balconies and tracery are  of the later Gothic period, showing marked tendencies towards the  Renaissance.    It has been recently restored by its present owner, Baron Franchetti,  and is frequently spoken of as the Palazzo Franchetti.          IV.    WINDOW TRACERY IN THE PALAZZO CAVALLI.      In Venetian tracery it will always be found that a certain arrangement  of quatrefoils and other figures has been planned as if it were to  extend indefinitely into miles of arcade, and out of this colossal  piece of marble lace a portion in the shape of a window is cut  mercilessly and fearlessly: what fragments and odd shapes of  interstice, remnants of this or that figure of the divided foliation,  may occur at the edge of the window, it matters not; all are cut  across and shut in by the great outer archivolt. This is of course  open to serious criticism as construction, but its beauty and  effectiveness, as used here, cannot be gainsaid.          V.    WINDOW TRACERY IN THE PALAZZO CICOGNA, VENICE.      This is an example of early Gothic work in Venice and is quite unlike  later examples. Ruskin speaks of it as the only instance of good  _complicated_ tracery to be found in Venice. The fact that it is  moulded only on the face is considered evidence of its early date.    In this view, as, in fact, in all of the examples which we have  selected, the moulding formed of alternating blocks or dentils,  projecting first on one side and then the other, which is peculiar to  Venice, can be seen. It was commonly used as a frame about a window or  group of windows, and is very effective, especially when used, as it  frequently was, relieved against a flat wall surface.          VI. and VII.    TWO PORTIONS OF THE FACADE OF THE CA D'ORO, VENICE.      This, next to the Ducal Palace, is the most elaborate and it might be  said the most beautiful of the Gothic Venetian palaces. It has been  considerably changed in the various restorations to which it has been  subjected, but still has enough of its original features to remain  a wonderfully beautiful building. It is an extreme example of the  characteristic disregard of the ordinary principles of building  construction to be found throughout the work we have been considering.  Fergusson's remarks upon this failing of the Venetian architects is  pointed and well considered. He says: \"Most of the faults that strike  us in the buildings of Venice arise from the defective knowledge which  they betray of constructive principles. The Venetian architects had  not been brought up in the hard school of practical experience, nor  thoroughly grounded in construction, as the northern architects were  by the necessities of the large buildings which they erected. On the  contrary, they merely adopted details because they were pretty,  and used them so as to be picturesque in domestic edifices where  convenience was everything, and construction but a secondary  consideration.\"    The Ca D'oro was probably built about the middle of the fourteenth  century.    Evidences of the use of color in this facade can be plainly seen in  the photographic views, and the contrast of the deep shadows and flat  wall surfaces is strikingly beautiful.          VIII.    THE PALAZZO PISANI.      This palace is of the late Gothic period, nearly approaching the  Renaissance. It is situated on the lower reach of the Grand Canal.    In all of the examples here selected a marked predominance of  horizontal treatment will be observed. The roofs are flat, and arcades  and balconies all help to emphasize the horizontal direction in the  design. This, it will be observed, is distinctly different from the  contemporary Gothic of the rest of Europe.           *       *       *       *       *    Notable examples of American buildings modelled after or in the style  of the Venetian palaces are the Chicago Athletic Club, the Montauk  Club, Brooklyn, and the new building adjoining the Hoffman House,  Madison Square, New York.
