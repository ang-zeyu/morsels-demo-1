JACOBUS.      POSTURE MASTERS.      It is now a-days extremely common to style the tumble-down-dick exploits or  posture masters, balancers, conjurers, &c. an art. To ridicule such an  abuse of the term by applying it to mere adroitness, skill in trifles, and  labour-in-vain performances, Quinctilian gives us this merry  instance--\"Qualis illius fuit, qui grana ciceris ex spatio distante missa,  in acum continue, et sine frustratione inserebat; quem cum spectasset  Alexander, donasse eum dicitur leguminis modio--quod quidem praemium fuit  illo opere dignissimum.\" Translation--Of this kind of art, was his, who,  standing at a certain distance, could continually, without missing, stick a  small pea upon the point of a needle; which when Alexander had witnessed,  he ordered him a bushel of that grain for his trouble, a reward quite  adequate to such an exploit. We have a similar story related, I think, of  Charles II.: a posture master climbed up Grantham steeple, and then stood  on his head upon the weathercock. The facetious monarch, after witnessing  his ascent, told him he might forthwith have a patent that none should do  the like but himself.           *       *       *       *       *      TO MAKE BUBBLE AND SQUEAK.    _Published by request of the gentlemen of both Universities._      First--Take of beef, or mutton, or lamb, or veal, or any other meat, two  pounds and a half, or any other quantity; be sure to keep it in salt till  the saline particles have locked up all the animal juices, and rendered  the fibres hard of digestion; then boil it over a turf or peat fire, in a  brass kettle, covered with a copper lid, until it is over much done.    Second--Take a large turned cabbage, and boil it in a bell metal pot until  it is done enough, or (if you think proper) too much.    Thirdly--Slice the meat, and souse that and the cabbage both in a frying  pan together, and let them bubble and squeak over a charcoal fire for half  an hour, three minutes, and two seconds.    Lastly--Devour the whole, which will not weigh more than _four_ pounds, for  a quantum sufficit; drink six pints of good, fat ale; sit, smoke, sleep,  snore, and forget your book.           *       *       *       *       *      ADVERTISEMENT.    _In defence of the two Universities._      We can assure the public that the malicious report of the Greek language  being expelled from the abovenamed seats of Minerva, is entirely without  foundation; there being, at this moment, many thousand volumes written in  that tongue, actually extant, and quite unmolested in the several  libraries.           *       *       *       *       *      HONEST PREJUDICES,    _Or bona fide extracts from celebrated authors._      Before the conquest of this country by the Normans, the land in Norfolk was  so light and fine, that the farmers usually plowed with two rabbits and a  case knife!--_Jones's Wonderful Changes_, p. 86.--Weep at this ye who are  now racking your inventive powers for improvements in agricultural  implements.

The conspicuous part which Bolivar has acted throughout the revolution in  Colombia, and at the close of that in Peru, renders it imperative on us to  give some account of a character, identified with so many great and  extraordinary events.    Simon Bolivar was born at Caracas on the 25th of July, 1783. He lost his  parents at an early age; and, in his sixteenth year, was sent to Europe to  finish his education. He made the tour of France and Italy. Having married  at Madrid, he embarked for Venezuela, where his wife died a few months  after her arrival. Bolivar went a second time to Europe, and was present at  the coronation of Napoleon. He returned to Caracas in company with Emparan,  appointed captain-general of Venezuela by the central junta at Seville.  Soon after the raising of the standard of independence (19th April, 1810)  in that country, he was sent to solicit the protection of Great Britain. He  was well received by the Marquess Wellesley, then secretary for Foreign  Affairs. The British government offered its mediation between Spain and her  colonies, but the offer was rejected by the court of Madrid. Bolivar  returned to his own country, accompanied by General Miranda, who was placed  in command of the Venezuelan troops. But the revolutionary government was  too feebly organized to give efficiency to the military force. Divisions  arose, and the cause of independence was on the retrograde, when the  dreadful earthquake of 1812, and the subsequent invasion by the Spanish  force under General Monteverde, for the time, precluded all possibility of  success.    Bolivar, alleging that Miranda had betrayed "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11335"],[0,"The Einstein Theory of Relativity: A Concise Statement (#2)"],[1," to imply a  fourth dimension, which is not implied by these systems.    Einstein supposes that space is Euclidean where it is sufficiently  remote from matter, but that the presence of matter causes it  to become slightly non-Euclidean--the more matter there is in the  neighborhood, the more space will depart from Euclid. By the help of  this hypothesis, together with his previous theory of relativity, he  deduces gravitation--very approximately, but not exactly, according  to the Newtonian law of the inverse square. The minute differences  between the effects deduced from his theory and those deduced from  Newton are measurable in certain cases. There are, so far, three  crucial tests of the relative accuracy of the new theory and the old.    (1) The perihelion of Mercury shows a discrepancy which has long  puzzled astronomers. This discrepancy is fully accounted for by  Einstein. At the time when he published his theory, this was its only  experimental verification.    (2) Modern physicists were willing to suppose that light might be  subject to gravitation--i.e., that a ray of light passing near a  great mass like the sun might be deflected to the extent to which a  particle moving with the same velocity would be deflected according  to the orthodox theory of gravitation. But Einstein's theory required  that the light should be deflected just twice as much as this. The  matter could only be tested during an eclipse among a number of  bright stars. Fortunately a peculiarly favourable eclipse occurred  last year. The results of the observations have now been published,  and are found to verify Einstein's prediction. The verification is not,  of course, quite exact; with such delicate observations that was not to  be expected. In some cases the departure is considerable. But taking  the average of the best series of observations, the deflection at  the sun's limb is found to be 1.98'', with a probable error of about  6 per cent., whereas the deflection calculated by Einstein's theory  should be 1.75''. It will be noticed that Einstein's theory gave a  deflection twice as large as that predicted by the orthodox theory,  and that the observed deflection is slightly larger than Einstein  predicted. The discrepancy is well within what might be expected in  view of the minuteness of the measurements. It is therefore generally  acknowledged by astronomers that the outcome is a triumph for Einstein.    (3) In the excitement of this sensational verification, there has  been a tendency to overlook the third experimental test to which  Einstein's theory was to be subjected. If his theory is correct as it  stands, there ought, in a gravitational field, to be a displacement  of the lines of the spectrum towards the red. No such effect has  been discovered. Spectroscopists maintain that, so far as can be  seen at present, there is no way of accounting for this failure if  Einstein's theory in its present form is assumed. They admit that some  compensating cause may be discovered to explain the discrepancy, but  they think it far more probable that Einstein's theory requires some  essential modification. Meanwhile, a certain suspense of judgment  is called for. The new law has been so amazingly successful in two  of the three tests that there must be some thing valid about it,  even if it is not exactly right as yet.    Einstein's theory has the very highest degree of aesthetic merit:  every lover of the beautiful must wish it to be true. It gives a  vast unified survey of the operations of nature, with a technical  simplicity in the critical assumptions which makes the wealth of  deductions astonishing. It is a case of an advance arrived at by  pure theory: the whole effect of Einstein's work is to make physics  more philosophical (in a good sense), and to restore some of that  intellectual unity which belonged to the great scientific systems of  the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but which was lost through  increasing specialization and the overwhelming mass of detailed  knowledge. In some ways our age is not a good one to live in, but  for those who are interested in physics there are great compensations.            THE EINSTEIN THEORY OF RELATIVITY    A Concise Statement by Prof. H. A. Lorentz, of the University of Leyden    The total eclipse of the sun of May 29, resulted in a striking  confirmation of the new theory of the universal attractive power  of gravitation developed by Albert Einstein, and thus reinforced  the conviction that the defining of this theory is one of the most  important steps ever taken in the domain of natural science. In  response to a request by the editor, I will attempt to contribute  something to its general appreciation in the following lines.    For centuries Newton's doctrine of the attraction of gravitation has  been the most prominent example of a theory of natural science. Through  the simplicity of its basic idea, an attraction between two bodies  proportionate to their mass and also proportionate to the square  of the distance; through the completeness with which it explained  so many of the peculiarities in the movement of the bodies making  up the solar system; and, finally, through its universal validity,  even in the case of the far-distant planetary systems, it compelled  the admiration of all.    But, while the skill of the mathematicians was devoted to making  more exact calculations of the consequences to which it led, no  real progress was made in the science of gravitation. It is true  that the inquiry was transferred to the field of physics, following  Cavendish's success in demonstrating the common attraction between  bodies with which laboratory work can be done, but it always was  evident that natural philosophy had no grip on the universal power  of attraction. While in electric effects an influence exercised  by the matter placed between bodies was speedily observed--the  starting-point of a new and fertile doctrine of electricity--in  the case of gravitation not a trace of an influence exercised by  intermediate matter could ever be discovered. It was, and remained,  inaccessible and unchangeable, without any connection, apparently,  with other phenomena of natural philosophy.    Einstein has put an end to this isolation; it is now well established  that gravitation affects not only matter, but also light. Thus  strengthened in the faith that his theory already has inspired,  we may assume with him that there is not a single physical or  chemical phenomenon--which does not feel, although very probably in  an unnoticeable degree, the influence of gravitation, and that, on the  other side, the attraction exercised by a body is limited in the first  place by the quantity of matter it contains and also, to some degree,  by motion and by the physical and chemical condition in which it moves.    It is comprehensible that a person could not have arrived at such a  far-reaching change of view by continuing to follow the old beaten  paths, but only by introducing some sort of new idea. Indeed,  Einstein arrived at his theory through a train of thought of great  originality. Let me try to restate it in concise terms.        THE EARTH AS A MOVING CAR    Everyone knows that a person may be sitting in any kind of a vehicle  without noticing its progress, so long as the movement does not vary  in direction or speed; in a car of a fast express train objects fall  in just the same way as in a coach that is standing still. Only when  we look at objects outside the train, or when the air can enter the  car, do we notice indications of the motion. We may compare the earth  with such a moving vehicle, which in its course around the sun has  a remarkable speed, of which the direction and velocity during a  considerable period of time may be regarded as constant. In place  of the air now comes, so it was reasoned formerly, the ether which  fills the spaces of the universe and is the carrier of light and of  electro-magnetic phenomena; there were good reasons to assume that the  earth was entirely permeable for the ether and could travel through it  without setting it in motion. So here was a case comparable with that  of a railroad coach open on all sides. There certainly should have  been a powerful \"ether wind\" blowing through the earth and all our  instruments, and it was to have been expected that some signs of it  would be noticed in connection with some experiment or other. Every  attempt along that line, however, has remained fruitless; all the  phenomena examined were evidently independent of the motion of the  earth. That this is the way they do function was brought to the front  by Einstein in his first or \"special\" theory of relativity. For him  the ether does not function and in the sketch that he draws of natural  phenomena there is no mention of that intermediate matter.    If the spaces of the universe are filled with an ether, let us suppose  with a substance, in which, aside from eventual vibrations and other  slight movements, there is never any crowding or flowing of one part  alongside of another, then we can imagine fixed points existing in it;  for example, points in a straight line, located one meter apart, points  in a level plain, like the angles or squares on a chess board extending  out into infinity, and finally, points in space as they are obtained  by repeatedly shifting that level spot a distance of a meter in the  direction perpendicular to it. If, consequently, one of the points  is chosen as an \"original point\" we can, proceeding from that point,  reach any other point through three steps in the common perpendicular  directions in which the points are arranged. The figures showing how  many meters are comprized in each of the steps may serve to indicate  the place reached and to distinguish it from any other; these are, as  is said, the \"co-ordinates\" of these places, comparable, for example,  with the numbers on a map giving the longitude and"]]]
