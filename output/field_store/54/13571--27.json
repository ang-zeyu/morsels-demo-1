The town is obliged to provide him with a house suitable to the  dignity of his elevated situation. When he leaves his house, he is  always compelled to wear a crown of wheat-ears, and he cannot appear  in public without a robe of purple or scarlet cloth, and surrounded  by a great number of officers. The governor, the bishops, and other  dignitaries, are obliged to give him a feast; and all who meet him must  salute him with respect. When the fortnight is at an end, the king quits  his palace, strips off his crown and purple, dismisses his court, and  returns to his hovel. For a length of time this pantomimical king was  chosen from amongst the nobles, but at present it has devolved on the  lowest of the people.           *       *       *       *       *          NEW BOOKS.           *       *       *       *       *      THE LITERARY SOUVENIR, FOR 1833,      [Is, in our estimation, a splendid failure. It lacks the variety which  the _Annual_ should possess for a family of readers; and its  sameness is, moreover, of the saddest character in the whole region of  romance. The stories are long, and lazily told; and they overflow with  the most lugubrious monotony. There is scarcely a relief throughout the  volume, from Wordsworth's \"majestic sonnet\" on Sir Walter Scott, to  Autumn Flowers, by Agnes Strickland; we travel from one end to the  other, and all is lead and leaden--dull, heavy, and sad, as old Burton  could wish; and full of moping melancholy, unenlivened by quaintness, or  humour of any cast. Not that we mean to condemn the pieces individually;  but, collectively, they are too much in the same vein: the Editor has  studied too closely his text-motto:      \"Fairy tale to lull the heir,    Goblin grim the maids to scare.\"    It is all shade, without a gleam of sunshine, if we except two or three  of the most trifling of the papers. The best tale in the volume is the  Marsh Maiden, by Leigh Ritchie; next is the Jacobite Exile and his  Hound: Retrospections of Secundus Parnell, are an infliction upon the  reader; and these, with two _mediocre_ tales, and a sketch or two,  make up the prose contents. The poetry has greater merit, though almost  in one unvaried strain. Mr. Watts has contributed but one lyric, and  Mrs. Watts a stirring ballad of Spanish revenge; Mary Howitt has  contributed a fairy ballad, pretty enough; and the Sin of Earl Walter, a  tale of olden popish times in England, of some 60 or 70 verses. We quote  two specimens from the poetry:]      SONNET ON SIR WALTER SCOTT'S QUITTING ABBOTSFORD FOR NAPLES.    _By William Wordsworth._        A trouble, not of clouds, or weeping rain,    Nor of the setting sun's pathetic light    Engendered, hangs o'er Eildun's triple height:    Spirits of Power assembled there complain    For kindred Power departing from their sight;    While Tweed, best pleased in chanting a blithe strain,    Saddens his voice again and yet again.    Lift up your hearts, ye Mourners! for the might    Of the whole world's good wishes with him goes;    Blessings and prayers, in nobler retinue    Than sceptred king or laurelled conqueror knows,    Follow this wondrous Potentate. Be true    Ye winds of ocean and the midland sea,    Wafting your charge to soft Parthenope!      THE SKELETON DANCE.    _After the German of Goethe._        The warder looked out at the mid-hour of night,      Where the grave-hills all silently lay;    The moon-beams above gave so brilliant a light,      That the churchyard was clear as by day:    First one, then another, to open began;    Here came out a woman--there came out a man,--    Each clad in a shroud long and white.      And then for amusement--perchance it was cold--      In a circle they seemed to advance;    The poor and the rich, and the young and the old,--      But the grave-clothes impeded the dance:    And as no person thought about modesty there,    They flung off their garments, and stripped themselves bare,      And a shroud lay on each heap of mould.      They kicked up their heels, and they rattled their bones,      And the horrible din that they made    Went clickety-clackety--just like the tones      Of a castanet noisily played.    And the warder he laughed as he witnessed the cheer,    And he heard the Betrayer speak soft in his ear,      \"Go and steal away one of their shrouds.\"      Swift as thought it was done--in an instant he fled      Behind the church portal to hide;    And brighter and brighter the moon-beam was shed,      As the dance they still shudderingly plied;--    But at last they began to grow tired of their fun,    And they put on their shrouds, and slipped off, one by one,      Beneath, to the homes of the dead.      But tapping at every grave-hill, there staid      One skeleton, tripping behind;    Though not by his comrades the trick had been played--      Now its odour he snuffed in the wind:    He rushed to the door--but fell back with a shock;    For well for the wight of the bell and the clock,      The sign of the cross it displayed.      But the shroud he must have--not a moment he stays;      Ere a man had begun but to think,    On the Gothic-work his fingers quickly he lays,      And climbs up its chain, link by link.    Now woe to the warder--for sure he must die--    To see, like a long-legged spider, draw nigh      The skeleton's clattering form:      And pale was his visage, and thick came his breath;      The garb, alas! why did he touch?    How sick grew his soul as the garment of death      The skeleton caught in his clutch--    The moon disappeared, and the skies changed to dun,    And louder than thunder the church-bell tolled one--      The spectre fell tumbling to bits!        [and one of the prose tales, abridged:]      BEATRICE ADONY AND JULIUS ALVINZI.      There is not in all Germany a more pleasant station for a regiment of  horse than the city of Salzburgh, capital of the province of that name,  in the dominions of the House of Austria. Here, during the summer and  autumn of 1795, lay the third regiment of Hungarian hussars. This corps  had sustained a heavy loss during the campaign of the year previous in  Flanders, and was sent into garrison to be recruited and organized anew.  Count Zichy, who commanded it, was a noble of the highest rank, of  princely fortune, and of lavish expenditure; and being of a cheerful and  social turn of mind, he promoted all the amusements of the place, and  encouraged the gaiety of his officers.    The scenery around is grand and alpine. The narrow defiles and  picturesque valleys are watered by mountain rivers; and, at an easy  distance from the city, is the lone lake of Berchtolsgaden, lying  beneath a lofty, inaccessible alp, of the most stern and majestic  aspect. Need it be told how sweet upon that placid lake sounded the  mellow horns of the Hungarian band; and may it not be left to fancy to  image out, how these parties, these scenes, and these sensations, gave  birth to some abiding, and to very many passing loves.    Among the fair women of Salzburgh, the palm of beauty was yielded  readily by all to Beatrice Adony, the only daughter of a respected  statesman, long favoured at court, and then resident upon a private  estate in the neighbourhood. He had retired from public affairs a few  years before, when under deep affliction from the loss of a beloved  wife; and lived a life of fond parental devotion with this lovely  Beatrice, who was the image of her departed mother. He had directed  all her studies; and with such judgment, that he had imparted to her  character a masculine strength, which elevated her above all the common  dangers of that season of life when woman passes forth into society.    The Count Zichy was a relation of Count Adony, and a constant and  welcome guest at his mansion; and Beatrice, therefore, attended many and  most of the entertainments which the Count and his officers gave to the  society of Salzburgh during their stay. As she smiled no encouragement  upon the attentions which the Count seemed at first disposed to pay her,  and as he was a cheerful, manly-hearted creature, and though made of  penetrable stuff, by no means a person to lose either appetite, society,  or life, for love, he bestowed his gallantries elsewhere. She liked him  for this all the better; and gave him, in return, that free-hearted,  sisterly friendship, which might be innocently suffered to grow out of  their connexion and intimacy.    All the regular, conceited male coquettes were abashed and perplexed by  manners so natural, that they could make nothing of her; while those  more dangerous, but much to be blamed admirers, who stand apart with  sighs and gazes, were baffled and made sad by the silent dignity of eyes  serenely bright, that never looked upon their flattering worship with  one ray of favour. Such was Beatrice Adony; all the fair girls were fond  of her, and proud of her--because she was no one's rival. They looked on  her as a being of a higher order; one whose thoughts were chaste as the  unsunned Alps. She was admired by them, meditated upon--but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12545"],[0,"Traditions of the Tinguian: a Study in Philippine Folk-Lore (#2)"],[1," rationalism there is a tendency on the  part of a considerable number of the Tinguian to consider these  tales purely as stories and the characters as fictitious, but the  mass of the people hold them to be true and speak of the actors as  \"the people who lived in the first times.\" For the present we shall  take their point of view and shall try to reconstruct the life in  \"the first times\" as it appears in the tales.    The principal actors live in Kadalayapan and Kaodanan, [6] towns  which our chief story teller--when trying to explain the desire of  Kanag to go down and get fruit--assures us were somewhere in the air,  above the earth (p. 141). [7] At other times these places are referred  to as Sudipan--the term by which spirits are supposed to call the  present earth--while the actors are referred to as Ipogau--the spirit  name for Tinguian. Whatever its location it was a place much like the  present home of this people. The sky, the chief abode of spirits and  celestial bodies, was above the land, and the heroes of the tales  are pictured as ascending to visit the upper realms. The trees,  plants, and animals were for the most part those known to-day. The  ocean appears to have been well known, while mention is made of some  places in Luzon, such as Dagopan and San Fernando in Pangasinan with  which the people of to-day are not at all familiar (p. 89, 168).    We learn that each village is situated near to a river or waterway  by the banks of which shallow wells are dug, and there we find the  women gathering under the shade of the trees, dipping up water to be  carried to their homes, washing and combing their hair, and taking  their baths (p. 48). They seldom go singly, for enemies are apt to  be near, and unless several are in the company it will be impossible  to spread the alarm and secure help in case of attack (p. 43).    Leading up from the spring to the village are bamboo poles on which  the heads of enemies are displayed (p. 43). In cases where the  warriors have been especially successful these trophies may surround  the whole settlement (p. 76). About the town is a defensive wall,  generally of bamboo, but in some cases made up entirely of gigantic  snakes (p. 43). Within this inclosure are many houses. The bamboo  floors are raised high above the ground, while the thatching is of  grass. Ladders lead up to little porches, from which doors open into  the dwellings. At least part of the houses have a cooking room in  addition to that used by the family, while structures containing a  ninth room are several times mentioned (pp. 43, 52, 85).    In one corner of the living room is a box containing blankets, above  which are pillows and mats used by members of the household and guests;  an iron caldron lies on the floor, while numerous Chinese jars stand  about. A hearth, made up of a bed of ashes in which stones are sunk,  is used for cooking. Above it is a bamboo food hanger, while near by  stand jars of water and various cooking pots. Food baskets, coconut  shell cups, and dishes, and a quantity of Chinese plates appear when  the meal is served, while the use of glass is not unknown. Cups of  gold, wonderful jars, and plates appear at times, but seem to be so  rare as to excite comment (pp. 33, 98, 102, 105).    Scattered through the village are numerous small buildings known  as _balaua_ (p. 43), which are erected for the spirits during the  greatest of the ceremonies, and still inside the enclosure are the  rice drying plots and granaries, the latter raised high above the  ground so as to protect their contents from moisture (p. 150).    About the town pigs and chickens roam at will, while half-starved  hunting dogs prowl about below the kitchens and fight for morsels  which drop from above (p. 99). Carabao are kept and used as food  (p. 101), but in the cycle proper no mention is made of using them as  work animals. [8] Game, especially deer and wild chickens, and fish  are added to the domestic supply of food (p. 80), but the staple  appears to be mountain rice. Beans, coconuts, oranges, sugar cane,  betel-nuts, and tobacco are also cultivated (pp. 33, 107, 121, 138).    Clothing is scanty but nevertheless receives much attention. The  poorest of the men wear clouts of banana leaf, and the women, when in  danger of capture, don skirts of bark; but on most occasions we find  the man wearing a colored cotton clout, above which is a bright belt  of the same material, while for ceremonies he may add a short coat or  jacket. A headband, sometimes of gold, keeps his long hair in place,  and for very special events he may adorn each hair with a golden bead  (pp. 74, 76, 81).    The cotton skirts of the women reach from the waist to the knees;  the arms are covered with strands above strands of beads, while  strings of agate beads surround the neck or help to hold the hair in  place. To the real hair is often added a switch which appears to be  valued highly (p. 89). Ornaments of gold adorn the ears, and finger  rings of the same metal are several times mentioned (pp. 39, 43, 124).    The tales afford us a glimpse of the daily life. In the early  morning the chilly mountain air drives the people from their mats to  the yard, where they squat about the fires (p. 132). As it becomes  light, part of the women begin pounding out the rice from its straw  and husks (p. 144), while others depart for the springs to secure  water (p. 101). In planting time husband and wife trudge together  to the fields, where the man plants the seeds or cuttings, and his  wife assists by pouring on water (p. 107). In midday, unless it is  the busy season, the village activities are practically suspended,  and we see the _balaua_ filled with men, asleep or lounging, while  children may be playing about with tops or disk-like _lipi_ seeds  (p. 139). As it becomes cooler, the town again takes on life; in the  houses the women weave blankets or prepare food, the older women feed  the chickens and pigs (p. 93), while the workers from the fields,  or hunters with their dogs and game, add to the general din and  excitement (p. 80). When night comes on, if it be in the dry season,  bonfires spring up in different parts of the village, and about them  the girls and women gather to spin. Here also come the men and boys,  to lounge and talk (p. 117). A considerable portion of the man's time  is taken up in preparation for or actual participation in warfare  (p. 74). We have already seen that the constant danger of enemies  makes it advisable for the women to go in parties, even to the village  spring. One tale informs us of a girl who is left alone to guard the  rice field and is promptly killed by the _alzado;_ [9] another states  that \"all the tattooed Igorot are enemies\" (pp. 43, 155, 161).    Revenge for the loss of relations or townspeople is a potent cause  of hostile raids; old feuds may be revived by taunts; but the chief  incentive appears to be the desire for renown, to be known as \"a man  who goes to fight in the enemies' towns\" (pp. 90, 59).    Warriors sometimes go in parties, sometimes alone, but generally in  couples (p. 67). At times they lie in ambush and kill young girls  who go for water, or old men and women who pass their hiding place  (p. 97). Again they go out boldly, armed with shield, spear, and  headaxe; they strike their shields as they go and announce their  presence to the enemy (p. 103). In five of the tales the heroes  challenge their opponents and then refuse to be the first to use their  weapons. It is only when their foes have tried in vain to injure them  that they enter the conflict. In such cases whole towns are wiped out  of existence and a great number of heads and a quantity of jars and  other booty is sent back to the towns of the victors (p. 104). Peace  is restored in one instance by the payment of a number of valuable jars  (p. 91).    Upon the return of a successful war party, the relatives meet them  at the gate of the town and compel them to climb the _sangap;_  [10] then invitations are sent out to friends and relatives in  neighboring towns to come and aid in the celebration of the victory  (p. 140). When they arrive at the entrance of the village they are  met by the townspeople, who offer them liquor and then conduct them  to the houses where they feast and dance to the music of _gansas_  (p. 126). [11] Finally the captured heads are stuck on the _sagang_  [12] and are placed by the gate, the spring, and, if sufficient in  number, surround the town (p. 140). Taking the heads of one's neighbors  does not appear to be common, yet cases are mentioned where visitors  are treacherously killed at a dance (pp. 78, 83).    The use of poison [13] is twice mentioned. In one case the victims  are killed by drinking liquor furnished by the father of the girl  about whose head they are dancing (pp. 148, 156).    Bamboo spears appear to be used, but we are explicitly told that  they fought with steel weapons, and there are frequent references to  headaxes, spears, and knives (pp. 65, 76, 120).    Marriage appears generally to be negotiated by the mother of the youth  at his suggestion (p. 128). At times both his parents go to the girl's  home, and after many preliminaries broach the subject of their mission  (p. 128). The girl's people discuss the proposition, and if they are  favorable they set a day for the _pakalon_--a celebration at which the  price to be paid for the bride is decided upon (p. 49). The parents  of the groom then return home after having left some small present,  such as a jar or an agate bead, as a sign of engagement (p. 128)  [14]. The _pakalon_ is held a few days later at the girl's home,  and for this event her people prepare a quantity of food (p. 72). On  the agreed day the close friends and relatives of both families will  assemble. Those who accompany the groom carry jars and pigs, either  in part payment for the bride, or to serve as food for the company  (pp. 72,"]]]
