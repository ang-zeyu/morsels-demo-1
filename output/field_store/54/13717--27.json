You never told him not to buy or read  such things, did you?\"    \"No; and I think he would not have done so in defiance of a prohibition  from me. So I shall not punish him. But I am pleased that you should plead  for him. I am very glad that my children all love one another.\"    \"Yes, indeed we do, papa!\" she said, \"And we all love you, and you love  Max and Gracie very much, and----\"    \"And Lulu also,\" he said, putting his arm about her and drawing her closer  to his side, as she paused with quivering lip and downcast eyes.    \"As much as you do Max and Gracie?\" she asked brokenly, hiding her face on  his shoulder. \"You said just now I was naughtier than both of them put  together.\"    \"Yet you are my own dear child, and it is precisely because I love you so  dearly that I am so distressed over your quick temper and wilfulness. I  fear that if not conquered they will cause great unhappiness to yourself  as well as to your friends. I want you to promise me, daughter, that you  will try to conquer them, asking God to help you.\"    \"I will, papa,\" she said, with unwonted humility; \"but, oh, I wish you  were going to stay with us! It's easier to be good with you than with  anybody else.\"    \"I am sorry, indeed, that I cannot,\" he said, rising and taking her hand.  \"Come, we must go back to the house now.\"    They moved along in silence for a little, then Lulu said, with an  affectionate look up into her father's face, \"Papa, I do so like to walk  this way!\"    \"How do you mean?\" he asked, smiling kindly upon her.    \"With my hand in yours, papa. You know I haven't often had the chance.\"    \"No, my poor child,\" he sighed, \"that is one of the deprivations to which  a seaman and his family have to submit.\"    \"Well,\" said the little girl, lifting his hand to her lips, \"I'd rather  have you for my father than anybody else, for all that.\"    At that he bent down and kissed her with a smile full of pleasure and  fatherly affection.          CHAPTER II.        \"By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou      shalt be condemned.\"--_Matt._ 12:37.      As they drew near the house Max came to meet them.    \"I've been to the post-office since the mail came in, papa,\" he said, \"and  there is no government letter for you yet. I'm so glad! I hope they're  going to let us keep you a good deal longer.\"    \"I'm not sorry to prolong my stay with wife and children,\" the captain  responded, \"but cannot hope to be permitted to do so very much longer.\"    \"Grandpa Dinsmore has come back from taking Harold and Herbert to  college,\" pursued Max, \"and we're all to take tea in there, Mamma Vi says;  because grandpa wants us all about him this first evening.\"    \"That is kind,\" said the captain, opening the gate and looking smilingly  at Violet, who, with little Grace, was waiting for him on the veranda. He  stopped there to speak with them, while Lulu hurried on into the house  and up to her own room, Max following.    \"Where's my book, Lu?\" he asked.    \"O Max, I couldn't help it--but papa caught me reading it and took it away  from me. And he told me when you asked me for it I should send you to  him.\"    Max's face expressed both vexation and alarm. \"I sha'n't do that,\" he  said, \"if I never get it. But was he very angry, Lu?\"    \"No; and you needn't be afraid to go to him, for he won't punish you; I  asked him not to, and he said he wouldn't. But he threw the book into the  sea, and said neither you nor I should ever read such poisonous stuff with  his knowledge or consent.\"    \"Then, where would be the use of my going to him for it? I'll not say a  word about it.\"    He went out, closed the door and stood irresolutely in the hall, debating  with himself whether to go up-stairs or down. Up-stairs in his room was  another dime novel which he had been reading that afternoon; he had not  quite finished it, and was eager to do so; he wanted very much to know how  the story ended, and had meant to read the few remaining pages now before  the call to tea. But his father's words, reported to him by Lulu, made it  disobedience.    \"It's a very little sin,\" whispered the tempter; \"as having read so much,  you might as well read the rest.\"    \"But it will be disobeying wilfully the kind father who forgave a heedless  act of disobedience not very long ago,\" said conscience; \"the dear father  who must soon leave you to be gone no one knows how long, perhaps never to  come back.\"    Just then the captain came quickly up the stairs. \"Ah, Max, are you  there?\" he said, in a cheery tone, then laying his hand affectionately on  the boy's shoulder. \"Come in here with me, my son, I want to have a little  talk with you while I make my toilet.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Max, following him into the dressing-room.    \"What have you been reading to-day?\" asked the captain, throwing off his  coat, pouring water into the basin from the pitcher, and beginning his  ablutions.    Max hung his head in silence till the question was repeated, then  stammered out the title of the book, the perusal of which he was so  desirous to finish.    \"Where did you get it?\" asked his father.    \"I bought it at a news-stand, papa.\"    \"You must not buy anything more of that kind, Max; you must not read any  such trash.\"    \"I will not again, papa; I should not this time if you had ever forbidden  me before.\"    \"No, I don't believe you would be guilty of wilful disobedience to any  positive command of your father,\" the captain said in a grave but kindly  tone; \"and yet I think you suspected I would not approve, else why were  you so unwilling to tell me what you had been reading?\"    He was standing before the bureau now, hairbrush in hand, and as he spoke  he paused in his work, and gazed searchingly at his son.    Max's face flushed hotly, and his eyes drooped for a moment, then looking  up into his father's face he said frankly, \"Yes, papa, I believe I was  afraid you would take the book from me if you saw it. I deserve that you  should be angry with me for that and for lending one to Lu.\"    \"I am displeased with you on both accounts,\" the captain replied, \"but I  shall overlook it this time, my son, hoping there will be no repetition of  either offence. Now go to your room, gather up all the doubtful reading  matter you have, and bring it here to me. I shall not go with you, but  trust to your honor to keep nothing back.\"    \"Oh, thank you, papa, for trusting me!\" cried Max, his countenance  brightening wonderfully, and he hastened away to do his father's bidding.    \"Just the dearest, kindest father that ever was!\" he said to himself, as  he bounded up the stairs. \"I'll never do anything again to vex him, if I  can help it.\"    He was down again in a moment with two dime novels and a story-paper of  the same stamp.    The captain had finished his toilet. Seating himself he took what Max had  brought, and glancing hastily over it, \"How much of this trash have you  read, Max?\" he asked.    \"The paper and most of one book, papa. I'll not read any more such, since  you've forbidden me; but they're very interesting, papa.\"    \"I dare say, to a boy of your age. But you don't think I would want to  deprive you of any innocent pleasure, Max?\"    \"No, sir; oh, no! But may I know why you won't let me read such stories?\"    \"Yes; it is because they give false views of life, and thus lead to wrong  and foolish actions. Why, Max, some boys have been made burglars and  highwaymen by such stories. I want you to be a reader, but of good and  wholesome literature; books that will give you useful information and good  moral teachings; above all things, my son, I would have you a student of  the Bible, 'the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise unto  salvation through faith which is in Jesus Christ.' Do you read it often,  Max?\"    \"Not very, papa. But you know I hear you read it every morning and  evening.\"    \"Yes; but I have sometimes been grieved to see that you paid very little  attention.\"    Max colored at that. \"Papa, I will try to do better,\" he said.    \"I hope you will,\" said his father. \"You will enjoy the same religious  advantages at Ion, and, my boy, try to profit by them, remembering that we  shall have to render an account at last of the use or abuse of all our  privileges. I want you to promise me that you will read a few verses of  the Bible every day, and commit at least one to memory.\"    \"I will, papa. And what else shall I read? You will let me have some  story-books, won't you?\" Max said, entreatingly.    \"Yes,\" said his father, \"I have no objection to stories of the right sort.  There are some very beautiful stories in the Bible; there are entertaining  stories in history; and there are fictitious stories that will do you good  and not harm. I shall take care in future that you have plenty of  wholesome mental food, so that you will have no excuse for craving such  stuff as this,\" he added, with a glance of disgust at what he held in his  hand. \"It may go into the kitchen fire.\"    \"Mrs. Scrimp never burns the least little bit of paper, papa,\" said Max.    \"Indeed! Why not?\" asked his father, with an amused smile.    \"She says it is wicked waste, because it is better than rags for the  paper-makers.\"    \"Ah! well, then, we will tear these into bits and let them go to the  paper-makers.\"    Max was standing by his father's side. \"Papa,\" he said, with a roguish  look into his father's face, \"don't you think you would enjoy reading them  first?\"    The captain laughed. \"No, my son,\" he said; \"I have not the slightest  inclination to read them. Bring me that waste basket and you may help me  tear them up.\"    They began the work of destruction, Max taking the paper, the captain the  book his son had been reading. Presently something in it attracted his  attention; he paused and glanced over several pages one after the other,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14916"],[0,"Fairy Tales Every Child Should Know (#2)"],[1,"training, but places them in  social relations with their mates and in conscious contact with the  world about them. The old games that have been played by generations of  children not only precede the training of the school and supplement it,  but accomplish some results in the nature of the child which are beyond  the reach of the school. When a crowd of boys are rushing across country  in \"hounds and deer,\" they are giving lungs, heart and muscles the best  possible exercise; they are sharing certain rules of honor with one  another, expressed in that significant phrase, \"fair play\"; and they are  giving rein to their imaginations in the very name of their occupation.  Body, spirit and imagination have their part in every good game; for the  interest of a game lies in its appeal to the imagination, as in \"hounds  and deer,\" or in its stimulus to activity, as in \"tag\" and  \"hide-and-seek.\"    There are few chapters in the biography of the childhood of men of  genius more significant than those which describe imaginary worlds which  were, for a time, as real as the actual world in which the boy lived.  Goethe entertained and mystified his playmates with accounts of a  certain garden in which he wandered at will, but which they could not  find; and De Quincey created a kingdom, with all its complex relations  and varied activities, which he ruled with beneficence and affection  until, in an unlucky hour, he revealed his secret to his brother, who  straightway usurped his authority, and governed his subjects with such  tyranny and cruelty that De Quincey was compelled to save his people by  destroying them.    These elaborate and highly organized efforts of the young imagination,  of which boys and girls of unusual inventiveness are capable, are  imitated on a smaller scale by all normal children. They endow inanimate  things with life, and play and suffer with them as with their real  playmates. The little girl not only talks with her dolls, but weeps with  and for them when disaster overtakes them. The boy faces foes of his own  making in the woods, or at lonely places in the road, who are quite as  real to him as the people with whom he lives. By common agreement a  locality often becomes a historic spot to a whole group of boys; enemies  are met and overcome there; grave perils are bravely faced; and the  magic sometimes lingers long after the dream has been dissolved in the  dawning light of definite knowledge. Childhood is one long day of  discovery; first, to the unfolding spirit, there is revealed a  wonderland partly actual and partly created by the action of the mind;  then follows the slow awakening, when the growing boy or girl learns to  distinguish between fact and fancy, and to separate the real from the  imaginary.    This process of learning to \"see things as they are\" is often regarded  as the substance of education, and to be able to distinguish sharply and  accurately between reality and vision, actual and imaginary image is  accepted as the test of thorough training of the intelligence. What  really takes place is the readjustment of the work of the faculties so  as to secure harmonious action; and in the happy and sound development  of the nature the imagination does not give place to observation, but  deals with principles, forces and laws instead of with things. The loss  of vision is never compensated for by the gain of sight; to see a thing  one must use his mind quite as much as his eye. It too often happens, as  the result of our educational methods, that in training the observer we  blight the poet; and the poet is, after all, the most important person  in society. He keeps the soul of his fellows alive. Without him the  modern world would become one vast, dreary, soul-destroying Coketown,  and man would sink to the level of Gradgrind. The practical man develops  the resources of the country, the man of vision discerns, formulates and  directs its spiritual policy and growth; the mechanic builds the house,  but the architect creates it; the artisan makes the tools, but the  artist uses them; the observer sees and records the fact, but the  scientist discovers the law; the man of affairs manages the practical  concerns of the world from day to day, but the poet makes it spiritual,  significant, interesting, worth living in.    The modern child passes through the same stages as did the children of  four thousand years ago. He, too, is a poet. He believes that the world  about him throbs with life and is peopled with all manner of strange,  beautiful, powerful folk, who live just outside the range of his sight;  he, too, personifies light and heat and storm and wind and cold as his  remote ancestors did. He, too, lives in and through his imagination; and  if, in later life, he grows in power and becomes a creative man, his  achievements are the fruits of the free and vigorous life of his  imagination. The higher kinds of power, the higher opportunities of  mind, the richer resources, the springs of the deeper happiness, are  open to him in the exact degree in which he is able to use his  imagination with individual freedom and intelligence. Formal education  makes small provision for this great need of his nature; it trains his  eye, his hand, his faculty of observation, his ability to reason, his  capacity for resolute action; but it takes little account of that higher  faculty which, cooperating with the other faculties, makes him an  architect instead of a builder, an artist instead of an artisan, a poet  instead of a drudge.    The fairy tale belongs to the child and ought always to be within his  reach, not only because it is his special literary form and his nature  craves it, but because it is one of the most vital of the textbooks  offered to him in the school of life. In ultimate importance it outranks  the arithmetic, the grammar, the geography, the manuals of science; for  without the aid of the imagination none of these books is really  comprehensible.

The second had two eyes, like other people, and she was called  \"Two Eyes.\" The youngest had three eyes, two like her second sister, and  one in the middle of her forehead, like the eldest, and she bore the  name of \"Three Eyes.\"    Now because little Two Eyes looked just like other people, her mother  and sisters could not endure her. They said to her, \"You are not better  than common folks, with your two eyes; you don't belong to us.\"    So they pushed her about, and threw all their old clothes to her for her  to wear, and gave her only the pieces that were left to eat, and did  everything that they could to make her miserable. It so happened that  little Two Eyes was sent into the fields to take care of the goats, and  she was often very hungry, although her sisters had as much as they  liked to eat. So one day she seated herself on a mound in the field, and  began to weep and cry so bitterly that two little rivulets flowed from  her eyes. Once, in the midst of her sorrow she looked up, and saw a  woman standing near her who said, \"What are you weeping for, little Two  Eyes?\"    \"I cannot help weeping,\" she replied; \"for because I have two eyes, like  other people, my mother and sisters cannot bear me; they push me about  from one corner to another and make we wear their old clothes, and give  me nothing to eat but what is left, so that I am always hungry. To-day  they gave me so little that I am nearly starved.\"    \"Dry up your tears, little Two Eyes,\" said the wise woman; \"I will tell  you something to do which will prevent you from ever being hungry again.  You have only to say to your own goat:      \"'Little goat, if you're able,    Pray deck out my table,'    \"and immediately there will be a pretty little table before you full of  all sorts of good things for you to eat, as much as you like. And when  you have had enough, and you do not want the table any more, you need  only say:      \"'Little goat, when you're able,    Remove my nice table,'    \"a"]]]
