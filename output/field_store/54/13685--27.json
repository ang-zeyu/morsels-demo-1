What a delight it is to  walk through the park and have the squirrels come running up so close,  to eat from one's hand! That is kindness.    How about kindness to people? Have you ever seen an older person walking  along the street with a little child of three or four years of age, the  child reaching up as far as he could to take the hand of the older  person, the older one jerking, pulling, yanking, all the while saying,  \"Come now, hurry up, hurry up.\" That is not kindness, is it?        \"Howe'er it be, it seems to me        'Tis only noble to be good;      Kind hearts are more than coronets,        And simple faith than Norman blood.\"    MEMORY VERSE, _Ephesians_ 4: 32        \"Be ye kind to one another.\"    MEMORY HYMN [554]        _\"How sweet, how heavenly is the sight!\"_          GOD'S CALL      God calls each one of you. He asks you to give your life to him. He has  a special work for you to do. You have heard of Wendell Phillips who did  so much to make slavery unlawful in America! Once, when Wendell was a  boy fourteen years of age, he heard Lyman Beecher preach. In the course  of his sermon the preacher said, \"You belong to God.\" The boy Wendell  thought that the preacher looked straight at him when he said that. He  went to his home at the close of the service, climbed the stairs to his  room, shut the door, knelt in prayer, saying, \"O God, I belong to thee,  take what is thine own.\" He heard and answered God's call.    Many, many years before Wendell Phillips lived there was another boy. He  worked in the temple. He was a youthful assistant to the minister. I  suppose he ran errands for him, and performed any and every service  about the temple the minister desired. One night, as usual, the boy went  to bed and fell asleep. As he slept he heard a voice calling him. Now he  was an obedient boy, and though it was hard for him to rouse himself  from a sound sleep and leave his comfortable bed he did so. He ran to  the minister saying, \"Here I am, you called me, what do you want?\" The  minister said, \"No, my boy, I did not call you, go back to bed.\" The boy  returned to his bed and again went to sleep. A second time, and even a  third time he was called. Each time the faithful, obedient lad leaped  from his couch and ran to the minister. The third time it dawned on the  mind of the minister that the voice the lad heard was the voice of God,  calling him to himself and to his special service. Being a wise and  loving man he said to the boy, \"Return to your bed, and if you hear the  call again, say, 'Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.'\" The boy did as  instructed and that night was forever memorable in his life, for that  was the night God called Samuel and Samuel answered.    MEMORY VERSE, _I Samuel_ 3: 10        \"And the Lord came, and stood, and called as at other times,      Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak, for thy servant      heareth.\"    MEMORY HYMN [674]        _\"Hushed was the evening hymn.\"_          A HAPPY HOME      This morning, the first thing, my boy said to me, \"Tell me a story.\"  This is the story I told him. Once upon a time, it was a long, long time  ago, so long ago that we can scarcely realize how long, more than  twenty-five hundred years ago. Well, once upon a time there was a  home--homes then were quite the same in most ways as homes are  now--there were children in that home. They played and were happy. And  too, I suppose they had their misunderstandings, and sometimes the  children quarreled. One day the children heard music. Looking up the  street they saw a great company of men marching right toward them. They  were soldiers. There were thirty thousand of them. In the center of the  marching army were some oxen. The oxen were harnessed to a fine, new  cart. On the cart was a chest, most beautifully carved and decorated. On  the soldiers came. What was the amazement of the boys and girls when  they stopped right in front of their house! Then the king, majestic in  his bearing and gorgeously arrayed, came to their father and said, \"I  want to leave this chest here in your house. Take good care of it.\" The  king's men brought the wonderful chest within, set it down, went out,  and the army marched away. From that hour the home was a different home.  There was joy, and peace, and an utter absence of quarreling. Three  months passed by. Then one day the king came again and took the chest  away. But peace and happiness did not depart with the chest. The home  was as happy and peaceful and free from bickering through all the coming  months as through the three when the wonderful chest was in the house.  What was the chest? It was not the king's chest; it was the ark of God.  You will find this true story in Second Samuel, the sixth chapter.    Memory Verse, _II Samuel_ 6: 11        \"And the ark of the Lord continued in the house of Obededom the      Gittite three months; and the Lord blessed him, and all his      household.\"    MEMORY HYMN [671]        _\"O happy home, where thou art loved the dearest.\"_          SYSTEM      Here are three books. I put them down like this, one beside the other,  that is system. I throw them down carelessly, that is not system, it is  not orderly.    Here is a little box. Inside are letters, such as you see on the sign in  front of the Church. Each letter has a space all its own. Now if A were  put down at M, M at Z, and E at X, what a task it would be to pick out  the letters and make a sign!    One day I visited a Chinese school. Such lack of system, such  disorderliness I never did see! Such noise I never did hear! They were  all studying at the tops of their voices, sitting around in all sorts of  ways, each trying to out-shout the other. Another day I went into a  school here in our city. I saw the desks arranged in systematic fashion,  each child with a desk all his own. In front I saw a platform, with a  larger desk, for the teacher. All was quiet and orderly.    Here I have a package of envelopes. There are fifty-two envelopes, one  for each Sunday in the year. Each envelope is divided in the center. On  one side I read, \"For others.\" On the other half I read, \"For  ourselves.\" I need not tell you that these are church envelopes. In this  way, this systematic way, we support our local church and pay to  missions. We like to have the girls and boys, as well as older people,  use these envelopes. The financial secretary of your church is just as  willing to keep the records of young people who give but five cents in  each side of the envelope as he is to keep the account of the man or  woman who places five dollars in each side of the envelope every Sunday.  You see we want you to grow up systematic and orderly in all your  religious life. Our Master is pleased when we do our religious duties  \"decently and in order.\"    MEMORY VERSE, _I Corinthians_ 16: 2        \"Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in      store, as God hath prospered him.\"    MEMORY HYMN [631]        _\"Jesus shall reign where'er the sun.\"_          A BOY FROM THE COUNTRY      Once upon a time there was a boy who lived in the country. It was said  of him that he was \"ruddy and withal of a beautiful countenance, and  goodly to look to.\" I think that description fits a country lad. Well,  this boy had brothers who were away from home in the army, fighting. One  day the boy's father said to him, \"I wish you would go down and see how  your brothers are getting along, and take with you this present.\" The  boy started on his journey. Now when he came to the place where the  soldiers were encamped he saw a strange sight. A giant, from the  opposing army, came out, blustering and issuing his challenge to any one  who would dare come against him. All seemed afraid of him. Even the big,  strong soldiers would not do battle with him. Therefore this youth from  the country volunteered saying, \"I will go out and fight him.\" They  tried to dissuade him, but he insisted. Now he was a perfect shot with  the sling. He chose five smooth stones from the brook. With one of  these he prevailed over the giant.    This lad, however, had some other things which stood him in better stead  even than the sling and the stones. What were they? First, he had  courage. He possessed what all the others lacked. Second, he had the  ability to do one thing and do that one thing well. He could use a sling  with the utmost accuracy. Third, he had confidence in himself and faith  in God. He was not conceited, no, we do not like that. Rather he had  self-confidence. Above all was this--\"I come to thee in the name of the  Lord of hosts.\" So said the lad from the country as he went to fight the  giant. What was his name? It is a good name--David.    MEMORY VERSE, _I Samuel_ 17: 45        \"Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a      shield; but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts.\"    MEMORY HYMN [416]        _\"Faith of our fathers.\"_          THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING IN THE WORLD      The most beautiful thing in the world! Now what is it? If you will lift  your eyes just a little you will see the flowers on the table, but lift  them higher than the flowers, higher than this pulpit, higher than the  pipes of the organ, above the lights, above the arch, you will see the  most beautiful thing in the world. Do you see it? It is the Cross.    Do you know, girls and boys, that long ago the cross was the most  repulsive thing in the world? It was odious. It had none of the charm  and beauty that is now woven about it. But from the day that Jesus was  crucified on the cross it took on new meaning, and it has grown in charm  and power until I think we all agree that it is the most beautiful sight  in the world.    Out in Colorado, high up the side of a mountain, where the snow never  melts in the crevices, may be seen two long ravines, one straight up and  down, the other straight across."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14417"],[0,"The Agamemnon of Aeschylus (#2)"],[1," admits, of course, no approach to a love-scene; he uses no  sophisms; but he does make us see through Clytemnestra's eyes and feel  through her passions. The agony of silent prayer in which, if my  conception is right, we first see her, helps to interpret her speeches  when they come; but every speech needs close study. She dare not speak  sincerely or show her real feelings until Agamemnon is dead; and then she  is practically a mad woman.    For I think here that there is a point which has not been observed. It is  that Clytemnestra is conceived as being really \"possessed\" by the Daemon  of the House when she commits her crime. Her statements on p. 69 are not  empty metaphor. A careful study of the scene after the murder will show  that she appears first \"possessed\" and almost insane with triumph, utterly  dominating the Elders and leaving them no power to answer. Then gradually  the unnatural force dies out from her. The deed that was first an ecstasy  of delight becomes an \"affliction\" (pp. 72, 76). The strength that defied  the world flags and changes into a longing for peace. She has done her  work. She has purified the House of its madness; now let her go away and  live out her life in quiet. When Aigisthos appears, and the scene suddenly  becomes filled with the wrangling of common men, Clytemnestra fades into a  long silence, from which she only emerges at the very end of the drama to  pray again for Peace, and, strangest of all, to utter the entreaty: \"Let  us not stain ourselves with blood!\" The splash of her husband's blood was  visible on her face at the time. Had she in her trance-like state actually  forgotten, or did she, even then, not feel that particular blood to be a  stain?    To some readers it will seem a sort of irrelevance, or at least a blurring  of the dramatic edge of this tragedy, to observe that the theme on which  it is founded was itself the central theme both of Greek Tragedy and of  Greek Religion. The fall of Pride, the avenging of wrong by wrong, is no  new subject selected by Aeschylus. It forms both the commonest burden of  the moralising lyrics in Greek tragedy and even of the tragic myths  themselves; and recent writers have shown how the same idea touches the  very heart of the traditional Greek religion. \"The life of the  Year-Daemon, who lies at the root of so many Greek gods and heroes, is  normally a story of Pride and Punishment. Each year arrives, waxes great,  commits the sin of Hubris and must therefore die. It is the way of all  Life. As an early philosopher expresses it, \"All things pay retribution  for their injustice one to another according to the ordinance of Time.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: See my _Four Stages of Greek Religion_, p. 47. Cornford,  _From Religion to Philosophy_, Chapter I. See also the fine pages on the  Agamemnon in the same writer's _Thucydides Mythistoricus_, pp. 144, ff.  (E. Arnold 1907). G. M.]    To me this consideration actually increases the interest and beauty of the  _Oresteia_, because it increases its greatness. The majestic art, the  creative genius, the instinctive eloquence of these plays--that eloquence  which is the mere despair of a translator--are all devoted to the  expression of something which Aeschylus felt to be of tremendous import.  It was not his discovery; but it was a truth of which he had an intense  realization. It had become something which he must with all his strength  bring to expression before he died, not in a spirit of self-assertion or  of argument, like a discoverer, but as one devoted to something higher and  greater than himself, in the spirit of an interpreter or prophet.

On a high terrace of the roof stands a_ WATCHMAN. _It is night_.    WATCHMAN.    This waste of year-long vigil I have prayed  God for some respite, watching elbow-stayed,  As sleuthhounds watch, above the Atreidae's hall,  Till well I know yon midnight festival  Of swarming stars, and them that lonely go,  Bearers to man of summer and of snow,  Great lords and shining, throned in heavenly fire.    And still I await the sign, the beacon pyre  That bears Troy's capture on a voice of flame  Shouting o'erseas. So surely to her aim  Cleaveth a woman's heart, man-passioned!  And when I turn me to my bed--my bed  Dew-drenched and dark and stumbling, to which near  Cometh no dream nor sleep, but alway Fear  Breathes round it, warning, lest an eye once fain  To close may close too well to wake again;  Think I perchance to sing or troll a tune  For medicine against sleep, the music soon  Changes to sighing for the tale untold  Of this house, not well mastered as of old.    Howbeit, may God yet send us rest, and light  The flame of good news flashed across the night.      [_He is silent, watching.  Suddenly at a distance in the night there is  a glimmer of fire, increasing presently to a blaze._    Ha!  0 kindler of the dark, O daylight birth  Of dawn and dancing upon Argive earth  For this great end! All hail!--What ho, within!  What ho! Bear word to Agamemnon's queen  To rise, like dawn, and lift in answer strong  To this glad lamp her women's triumph-song,  If verily, verily, Ilion's citadel  Is fallen, as yon beacons flaming tell.    And I myself will tread the dance before  All others; for my master's dice I score  Good, and mine own to-night three sixes plain.      [_Lights begin to show in the Palace_.    Oh, good or ill, my hand shall clasp again  My dear lord's hand, returning! Beyond that  I speak not. A great ox hath laid his weight  Across my tongue. But these stone walls know well,  If stones had speech, what tale were theirs to tell.  For me, to him that knoweth I can yet  Speak; if another questions I forget.      [_Exit into the Palace. The women's \"Ololuge\" or triumph-cry, is heard  within and then repeated again and again further off in the City.  Handmaids and Attendants come from the Palace, bearing torches, with which  they kindle incense on the altars. Among them comes_ CLYTEMNESTRA, _who  throws herself on her knees at the central Altar in an agony of prayer._    _Presently from the further side of the open space appear the_ CHORUS _of_  ELDERS _and move gradually into position in front of the Palace.  The day begins to dawn._    CHORUS.    Ten years since Ilion's righteous foes,    The Atreidae strong,  Menelaues and eke Agamemnon arose,  Two thrones, two sceptres, yoked of God;  And a thousand galleys of Argos trod    The seas for the righting of wrong;  And wrath of battle about them cried,      As vultures cry,  Whose nest is plundered, and up they fly  In anguish lonely, eddying wide,  Great wings like oars in the waste of sky,  Their task gone from them, no more to keep  Watch o'er the vulture babes asleep.  But One there is who heareth on high  Some Pan or Zeus, some lost Apollo--  That keen bird-throated suffering cry  Of the stranger wronged in God's own sky;  And sendeth down, for the law transgressed,    The Wrath of the Feet that follow.      So Zeus the Watcher of Friend and Friend,  Zeus who Prevaileth, in after quest  For One Beloved by Many Men  On Paris sent the Atreidae twain;  Yea, sent him dances before the end      For his bridal cheer,  Wrestlings heavy and limbs forespent  For Greek and Trojan, the knee earth-bent,  The bloody dust and the broken spear.  He knoweth, that which is here is here,  And that which Shall Be followeth near;  He seeketh God with a great desire,  He heaps his gifts, he essays his pyre  With torch below and with oil above,  With tears, but never the wrath shall move  Of the Altar cold that rejects his fire.      We saw the Avengers go that day,  And they left us here; for our flesh is old  And serveth not; and these staves uphold  A strength like the strength of a child at play.  For the sap that springs in the young man's hand  And the valour of age, they have left the land.  And the passing old, while the dead leaf blows  And the old staff gropeth his three-foot way,  Weak as a babe and alone he goes,  A dream left wandering in the day.      [_Coming near the Central Altar they see_ CLYTEMNESTRA, _who is still  rapt in prayer_.    But thou, O daughter of Tyndareus,  Queen Clytemnestra, what need? What news?  What tale or tiding hath stirred thy mood  To send forth word upon all our ways  For incensed worship? Of every god  That guards the city, the deep, the high,  Gods of the mart, gods of the sky,      The altars blaze.      One here, one there,  To the skyey night the firebrands flare,  Drunk with the soft and guileless spell  Of balm of kings from the inmost cell.  Tell, O Queen, and reject us not,  All that can or"]]]
