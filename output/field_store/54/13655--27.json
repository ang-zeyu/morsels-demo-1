Is that quite clear?\"    \"Perfectly,\" I replied. \"But how do you arrive at the interval of time  between the visits of the two men?\"    \"That also is quite simple. The tide is now about halfway out; it is  thus about three hours since high water. Now, the fisherman walked just  about the neap-tide, high-water mark, sometimes above it and sometimes  below. But none of his footprints have been obliterated; therefore he  passed after high water--that is, less than three hours ago; and since  his footprints are all equally distinct, he could not have passed when  the sand was very wet. Therefore he probably passed less than an hour  ago. The other man's footprints, on the other hand, reach only to the  neap-tide, high-water mark, where they end abruptly. The sea has washed  over the remainder of the tracks and obliterated them. Therefore he  passed not less than three hours and not more than four days  ago--probably within twenty-four hours.\"    As Thorndyke concluded his demonstration the sound of voices was borne  to us from above, mingled with the tramping of feet, and immediately  afterwards a very singular party appeared at the head of the gap  descending towards the shore. First came a short burly fisherman clad in  oilskins and sou'-wester, clumping along awkwardly in his great  sea-boots, then the local police-sergeant in company with my  professional rival Dr. Burrows, while the rear of the procession was  brought up by two constables carrying a stretcher. As he reached the  bottom of the gap the fisherman, who was evidently acting as guide,  turned along the shore, retracing his own tracks, and the procession  followed in his wake.    \"A surgeon, a stretcher, two constables, and a police-sergeant,\"  observed Thorndyke. \"What does that suggest to your mind, Jervis?\"    \"A fall from the cliff,\" I replied, \"or a body washed up on the shore.\"    \"Probably,\" he rejoined; \"but we may as well walk in that direction.\"    We turned to follow the retreating procession, and as we strode along  the smooth surface left by the retiring tide Thorndyke resumed:    \"The subject of footprints has always interested me deeply for two  reasons. First, the evidence furnished by footprints is constantly being  brought forward, and is often of cardinal importance; and, secondly, the  whole subject is capable of really systematic and scientific treatment.  In the main the data are anatomical, but age, sex, occupation, health,  and disease all give their various indications. Clearly, for instance,  the footprints of an old man will differ from those of a young man of  the same height, and I need not point out to you that those of a person  suffering from locomotor ataxia or paralysis agitans would be quite  unmistakable.\"    \"Yes, I see that plainly enough,\" I said.    \"Here, now,\" he continued, \"is a case in point.\" He halted to point with  his stick at a row of footprints that appeared suddenly above high-water  mark, and having proceeded a short distance, crossed the line again, and  vanished where the waves had washed over them. They were easily  distinguished from any of the others by the clear impressions of  circular rubber heels.    \"Do you see anything remarkable about them?\" he asked.    \"I notice that they are considerably deeper than our own,\" I answered.    \"Yes, and the boots are about the same size as ours, whereas the stride  is considerably shorter--quite a short stride, in fact. Now there is a  pretty constant ratio between the length of the foot and the length of  the leg, between the length of leg and the height of the person, and  between the stature and the length of stride. A long foot means a long  leg, a tall man, and a long stride. But here we have a long foot and a  short stride. What do you make of that?\" He laid down his stick--a  smooth partridge cane, one side of which was marked by small lines into  inches and feet--beside the footprints to demonstrate the discrepancy.    \"The depth of the footprints shows that he was a much heavier man than  either of us,\" I suggested; \"perhaps he was unusually fat.\"    \"Yes,\" said Thorndyke, \"that seems to be the explanation. The carrying  of a dead weight shortens the stride, and fat is practically a dead  weight. The conclusion is that he was about five feet ten inches high,  and excessively fat.\" He picked up his cane, and we resumed our walk,  keeping an eye on the procession ahead until it had disappeared round a  curve in the coast-line, when we mended our pace somewhat. Presently we  reached a small headland, and, turning the shoulder of cliff, came full  upon the party which had preceded us. The men had halted in a narrow  bay, and now stood looking down at a prostrate figure beside which the  surgeon was kneeling.    \"We were wrong, you see,\" observed Thorndyke. \"He has not fallen over  the cliff, nor has he been washed up by the sea. He is lying above  high-water mark, and those footprints that we have been examining appear  to be his.\"    As we approached, the sergeant turned and held up his hand.    \"I'll ask you not to walk round the body just now, gentlemen,\" he said.  \"There seems to have been foul play here, and I want to be clear about  the tracks before anyone crosses them.\"    Acknowledging this caution, we advanced to where the constables were  standing, and looked down with some curiosity at the dead man. He was a  tall, frail-looking man, thin to the point of emaciation, and appeared  to be about thirty-five years of age. He lay in an easy posture, with  half-closed eyes and a placid expression that contrasted strangely  enough with the tragic circumstances of his death.    \"It is a clear case of murder,\" said Dr. Burrows, dusting the sand from  his knees as he stood up. \"There is a deep knife-wound above the heart,  which must have caused death almost instantaneously.\"    \"How long should you say he has been dead, Doctor?\" asked the sergeant.    \"Twelve hours at least,\" was the reply. \"He is quite cold and stiff.\"    [Illustration: PLAN OF ST.

F, Shepherd's Path ascending shelving cliff.  C, Footpath along edge of cliff.]    \"Twelve hours, eh?\" repeated the officer. \"That would bring it to about  six o'clock this morning.\"    \"I won't commit myself to a definite time,\" said Dr. Burrows hastily. \"I  only say not _less_ than twelve hours. It might have been considerably  more.\"    \"Ah!\" said the sergeant. \"Well, he made a pretty good fight for his  life, to all appearances.\" He nodded at the sand, which for some feet  around the body bore the deeply indented marks of feet, as though a  furious struggle had taken place. \"It's a mighty queer affair,\" pursued  the sergeant, addressing Dr. Burrows. \"There seems to have been only one  man in it--there is only one set of footprints besides those of the  deceased--and we've got to find out who he is; and I reckon there won't  be much trouble about that, seeing the kind of trade-marks he has left  behind him.\"    \"No,\" agreed the surgeon; \"there ought not to be much trouble in  identifying those boots. He would seem to be a labourer, judging by the  hob-nails.\"    \"No, sir; not a labourer,\" dissented the sergeant. \"The foot is too  small, for one thing; and then the nails are not regular hob-nails.  They're a good deal smaller; and a labourer's boots would have the nails  all round the edges, and there would be iron tips on the heels, and  probably on the toes too. Now these have got no tips, and the nails are  arranged in a pattern on the soles and heels. They are probably  shooting-boots or sporting shoes of some kind.\" He strode to and fro  with his notebook in his hand, writing down hasty memoranda, and  stooping to scrutinize the impressions in the sand. The surgeon also  busied himself in noting down the facts concerning which he would have  to give evidence, while Thorndyke regarded in silence and with an air of  intense preoccupation the footprints around the body which remained to  testify to the circumstances of the crime.    \"It is pretty clear, up to a certain point,\" the sergeant observed, as  he concluded his investigations, \"how the affair happened, and it is  pretty clear, too, that the murder was premeditated. You see, Doctor,  the deceased gentleman, Mr. Hearn, was apparently walking home from Port  Marston; we saw his footprints along the shore--those rubber heels make  them easy to identify--and he didn't go down Sundersley Gap. He  probably meant to climb up the cliff by that little track that you see  there, which the people about here call the Shepherd's Path. Now the  murderer must have known that he was coming, and waited upon the cliff  to keep a lookout. When he saw Mr. Hearn enter the bay, he came down the  path and attacked him, and, after a tough struggle, succeeded in  stabbing him. Then he turned and went back up the path. You can see the  double track between the path and the place where the struggle took  place, and the footprints going to the path are on top of those coming  from it.\"    \"If you follow the tracks,\" said Dr. Burrows, \"you ought to be able to  see where the murderer went to.\"    \"I'm afraid not,\" replied the sergeant. \"There are no marks on the path  itself--the rock is too hard, and so is the ground above, I fear. But  I'll go over it carefully all the same.\"    The investigations being so far concluded, the body was lifted on to the  stretcher, and the cortege, consisting of the bearers, the Doctor, and  the fisherman, moved off towards the Gap, while the sergeant, having  civilly wished us \"Good-evening,\" scrambled up the Shepherd's Path, and  vanished above.    \"A very smart officer that,\" said Thorndyke. \"I should like to know what  he wrote in his notebook.\"    \"His account of the circumstances of the murder seemed a very"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13888"],[0,"Bacon (#2)"],[1,"Gate which is now seen, far from the river, in the garden of  the Thames Embankment. His father was Sir Nicholas Bacon, Elizabeth's  first Lord Keeper, the fragment of whose effigy in the Crypt of St.  Paul's is one of the few relics of the old Cathedral before the fire.  His uncle by marriage was that William Cecil who was to be Lord  Burghley. His mother, the sister of Lady Cecil, was one of the daughters  of Sir Antony Cook, a person deep in the confidence of the reforming  party, who had been tutor of Edward VI. She was a remarkable woman,  highly accomplished after the fashion of the ladies of her party, and as  would become her father's daughter and the austere and laborious family  to which she belonged. She was \"exquisitely skilled in the Greek and  Latin tongues;\" she was passionately religious, according to the  uncompromising religion which the exiles had brought back with them from  Geneva, Strasburg, and Zurich, and which saw in Calvin's theology a  solution of all the difficulties, and in his discipline a remedy for all  the evils, of mankind. This means that his boyhood from the first was  passed among the high places of the world--at one of the greatest crises  of English history--in the very centre and focus of its agitations. He  was brought up among the chiefs and leaders of the rising religion, in  the houses of the greatest and most powerful persons of the State, and  naturally, as their child, at times in the Court of the Queen, who joked  with him, and called him \"her young Lord Keeper.\" It means also that the  religious atmosphere in which he was brought up was that of the nascent  and aggressive Puritanism, which was not satisfied with the compromises  of the Elizabethan Reformation, and which saw in the moral poverty and  incapacity of many of its chiefs a proof against the great traditional  system of the Church which Elizabeth was loath to part with, and which,  in spite of all its present and inevitable shortcomings, her political  sagacity taught her to reverence and trust.    At the age of twelve he was sent to Cambridge, and put under Whitgift at  Trinity. It is a question which recurs continually to readers about  those times and their precocious boys, what boys were then? For whatever  was the learning of the universities, these boys took their place with  men and consorted with them, sharing such knowledge as men had, and  performing exercises and hearing lectures according to the standard of  men. Grotius at eleven was the pupil and companion of Scaliger and the  learned band of Leyden; at fourteen he was part of the company which  went with the ambassadors of the States-General to Henry IV.; at sixteen  he was called to the bar, he published an out-of-the-way Latin writer,  Martianus Capella, with a learned commentary, and he was the  correspondent of De Thou. When Bacon was hardly sixteen he was admitted  to the Society of \"Ancients\" of Gray's Inn, and he went in the household  of Sir Amyas Paulet, the Queen's Ambassador, to France. He thus spent  two years in France, not in Paris alone, but at Blois, Tours, and  Poitiers. If this was precocious, there is no indication that it was  thought precocious. It only meant that clever and promising boys were  earlier associated with men in important business than is customary now.  The old and the young heads began to work together sooner. Perhaps they  felt that there was less time to spare. In spite of instances of  longevity, life was shorter for the average of busy men, for the  conditions of life were worse.    Two recollections only have been preserved of his early years. One is  that, as he told his chaplain, Dr. Rawley, late in life, he had  discovered, as far back as his Cambridge days, the \"unfruitfulness\" of  Aristotle's method. It is easy to make too much of this. It is not  uncommon for undergraduates to criticise their text-books; it was the  fashion with clever men, as, for instance, Montaigne, to talk against  Aristotle without knowing anything about him; it is not uncommon for men  who have worked out a great idea to find traces of it, on precarious  grounds, in their boyish thinking. Still, it is worth noting that Bacon  himself believed that his fundamental quarrel with Aristotle had begun  with the first efforts of thought, and that this is the one recollection  remaining of his early tendency in speculation. The other is more  trustworthy, and exhibits that inventiveness which was characteristic  of his mind. He tells us in the _De Augmentis_ that when he was in  France he occupied himself with devising an improved system of  cypher-writing--a thing of daily and indispensable use for rival  statesmen and rival intriguers. But the investigation, with its call on  the calculating and combining faculties, would also interest him, as an  example of the discovery of new powers by the human mind.    In the beginning of 1579 Bacon, at eighteen, was called home by his  father's death. This was a great blow to his prospects. His father had  not accomplished what he had intended for him, and Francis Bacon was  left with only a younger son's \"narrow portion.\" What was worse, he lost  one whose credit would have served him in high places. He entered on  life, not as he might have expected, independent and with court favour  on his side, but with his very livelihood to gain--a competitor at the  bottom of the ladder for patronage and countenance. This great change in  his fortunes told very unfavourably on his happiness, his usefulness,  and, it must be added, on his character. He accepted it, indeed,  manfully, and at once threw himself into the study of the law as the  profession by which he was to live. But the law, though it was the only  path open to him, was not the one which suited his genius, or his object  in life. To the last he worked hard and faithfully, but with doubtful  reputation as to his success, and certainly against the grain. And this  was not the worst. To make up for the loss of that start in life of  which his father's untimely death had deprived him, he became, for  almost the rest of his life, the most importunate and most untiring of  suitors.    In 1579 or 1580 Bacon took up his abode at Gray's Inn, which for a long  time was his home. He went through the various steps of his profession.  He began, what he never discontinued, his earnest and humble appeals to  his relative the great Lord Burghley, to employ him in the Queen's  service, or to put him in some place of independence: through Lord  Burghley's favour he seems to have been pushed on at his Inn, where, in  1586, he was a Bencher; and in 1584 he came into Parliament for Melcombe  Regis. He took some small part in Parliament; but the only record of his  speeches is contained in a surly note of Recorder Fleetwood, who writes  as an old member might do of a young one talking nonsense. He sat again  for Liverpool in the year of the Armada (1588), and his name begins to  appear in the proceedings. These early years, we know, were busy ones.  In them Bacon laid the foundation of his observations and judgments on  men and affairs; and in them the great purpose and work of his life was  conceived and shaped. But they are more obscure years than might have  been expected in the case of a man of Bacon's genius and family, and of  such eager and unconcealed desire to rise and be at work. No doubt he  was often pinched in his means; his health was weak, and he was delicate  and fastidious in his care of it. Plunged in work, he lived very much as  a recluse in his chambers, and was thought to be reserved, and what  those who disliked him called arrogant. But Bacon was  ambitious--ambitious, in the first place, of the Queen's notice and  favour. He was versatile, brilliant, courtly, besides being his father's  son; and considering how rapidly bold and brilliant men were able to  push their way and take the Queen's favour by storm, it seems strange  that Bacon should have remained fixedly in the shade. Something must  have kept him back. Burghley was not the man to neglect a useful  instrument with such good will to serve him. But all that Mr.  Spedding's industry and profound interest in the subject has brought  together throws but an uncertain light on Bacon's long disappointment.  Was it the rooted misgiving of a man of affairs like Burghley at that  passionate contempt of all existing knowledge, and that undoubting  confidence in his own power to make men know, as they never had known,  which Bacon was even now professing? Or was it something soft and  over-obsequious in character which made the uncle, who knew well what  men he wanted, disinclined to encourage and employ the nephew? Was  Francis not hard enough, not narrow enough, too full of ideas, too much  alive to the shakiness of current doctrines and arguments on religion  and policy? Was he too open to new impressions, made by objections or  rival views? Or did he show signs of wanting backbone to stand amid  difficulties and threatening prospects? Did Burghley see something in  him of the pliability which he could remember as the serviceable quality  of his own young days--which suited those days of rapid change, but not  days when change was supposed to be over, and when the qualities which  were wanted were those which resist and defy it? The only thing that is  clear is that Burghley, in spite of Bacon's continual applications,  abstained to the last from advancing his fortunes.    Whether employed by government or not, Bacon began at this time to  prepare those carefully-written papers on the public affairs of the day,  of which he has left a good many. In our day they would have been  pamphlets or magazine articles. In his they were circulated in  manuscript, and only occasionally printed. The first of any importance  is a letter of advice to the Queen, about the year 1585, on the policy  to be followed with a view to keeping in check the Roman Catholic  interest at home and"]]]
