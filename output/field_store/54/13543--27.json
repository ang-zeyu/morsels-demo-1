As  for Suger, ever far-seeing and only too well able to read the future, not  only did he not suggest to the monarch any such design, but he  disapproved of it so soon as it was mentioned to him.  The truth of it  is, that, after having vainly striven to nip it in the bud, and being  unable to put a check upon the king's zeal, he thought it wise, either  for fear of wounding the king's piety, or of uselessly incurring the  wrath of the partisans of the enterprise, to yield to the times.\"  As for  St. Bernard, at the first of the three assemblies, viz., at Bourges,  whether it were that his mind was not yet made up or that he desired to  cover himself with greater glory, he advised the king to undertake  nothing without having previously consulted the Holy See; but when Pope  Eugenius III., so far from hesitating, had warmly solicited the aid of  the Christians against the infidels, St. Bernard, at the second assembly,  viz., at Vezelai, gave free vent to his feelings and his eloquence.  After having read the pope's letters, \"If ye were told,\" said he, \"that  an enemy had attacked your castles, your cities, and your lands, had  ravished your wives and your daughters, and had profaned your temples,  which of you would not fly to arms?  Well, all those evils, and evils  still greater, have come upon your brethren, upon the family of Christ,  which is your own.  Why tarry ye, then, to repair so many wrongs, to  avenge so many insults?  Christian warriors, He who gave His life for you  to-day demandeth yours; illustrious knights, noble defenders of the  cross, call to mind the example of your fathers, who conquered Jerusalem,  and whose names are written in heaven!  The living God hath charged me to  tell unto you that He will punish those who shall not have defended Him  against His enemies.  Fly to arms, and let Christendom re-echo with the  words of the prophet, 'Woe to him who dyeth not his sword with blood!'  \"At this fervent address the assembly rang with the shout of the first  crusade, 'God willeth it!  God willeth it!'  The king, kneeling before  St. Bernard, received from his hands the cross; the queen, Eleanor of  Aquitaine, assumed it, like her husband; nearly all the barons present  followed their example; St. Bernard tore up his garments into crosses for  distribution, and, on leaving the assembly, he scoured the country  places, everywhere preaching and persuading the people.  The villages and  castles are deserted,\" he wrote to the pope; \"there is none to be seen  save widows and orphans whose husbands and fathers are alive.\"  Nor did  he confine himself to France; he crossed into Germany, and preached the  crusade all along the Rhine.  The emperor, Conrad III., showed great  hesitation; the empire was sorely troubled, he said, and had need of its  head.  \"Be of good cheer,\" replied St.  Bernard \"so long as you defend  His heritage, God himself will take the burden of defending yours.\"  One  day, in December, 1146, he was celebrating mass at Spire, in presence of  the emperor and a great number of German princes.  Suddenly he passed  from the regular service to the subject of the crusade, and transported  his audience to the last judgment, in the presence of all the nations of  the earth summoned together, and Jesus Christ bearing his cross, and  reproaching the emperor with ingratitude.  Conrad was deeply moved, and  interrupted the preacher by crying out, \"I know what I owe to Jesus  Christ: and I swear to go whither it pleaseth Him to call me.\"  The  attraction became general; and Germany, like France, took up the cross.      [Illustration: PREACHING THE SECOND CRUSADE----13]    St. Bernard returned to France.  The ardor there had cooled a little  during his absence; the results of his trip in Germany were being waited  for; and it was known that, on being eagerly pressed to put himself at  the head of the crusaders, and take the command of the whole expedition,  he had formally refused.  His enthusiasm and his devotion, sincere and  deep as they were, did not, in his case, extinguish common sense; and he  had not forgotten the melancholy experiences of Peter the Hermit.  In  support of his refusal he claimed the intervention of Pope Eugenius III.  \"Who am I,\" he wrote to him, \"that I should form a camp, and march at the  head of an army?  What can be more alien to my calling, even if I lacked  not the strength and the ability?  I need not tell you all this, for you  know it perfectly.  I conjure you by the charity you owe me, deliver me  not over, thus, to the humors of men.\"  The pope came to France; and the  third grand assembly met at Etampes, in February, 1147.  The presence of  St. Bernard rekindled zeal; but foresight began to penetrate men's minds.  Instead of insisting upon his being the chief of the crusade, attention  was given to preparations for the expedition; the points were indicated  at which the crusaders should form a junction, and the directions in  which they would have to move; and inquiry was made as to what measures  should be taken, and what persons should be selected for the government  of France during the king's absence.  \"Sir,\" said St.  Bernard, after  having come to an understanding upon the subject with the principal  members of the assembly, at the same time pointing to Suger and the Count  de Nevers, \"here be two swords, and it sufficeth.\"  The Count de Nevers  peremptorily refused the honor done him; he was resolved, he said, to  enter the order of St. Bruno, as indeed he did.  Suger also refused at  first, \"considering the dignity offered him a burden, rather than an  honor.\"  Wise and clear-sighted by nature, he had learned in the reign of  Louis the Fat, to know the requirements and the difficulties of  government.  \"He consented to accept,\" says his biographer, \"only when he  was at last forced to it by Pope Eugenius, who was present at the king's  departure, and whom it was neither permissible nor possible for him to  resist.\"  It was agreed that the French crusaders should form a junction  at Metz, under the command of King Louis, and the Germans at Ratisbonne,  under that of the Emperor Conrad, and that the two armies should  successively repair by land to Constantinople, whence they would cross  into Asia.    Having each a strength, it is said, of one hundred thousand men, they  marched by Germany and the Lower Danube, at an interval of two months  between them, without committing irregularities and without meeting  obstacles so serious as those of the first crusade, but still much  incommoded, and subjected to great hardships in the countries they  traversed.  The Emperor Conrad and the Germans first, and then King Louis  and the French, arrived at Constantinople in the course of the summer of  1117.  Manuel Comnenus, grandson of Alexis Comnenus, was reigning there;  and he behaved towards the crusaders with the same mixture of caresses  and malevolence, promises and perfidy, as had distinguished his  grandfather.  \"There is no ill turn he did not do them,\" says the  historian Nicetas, himself a Greek.  Conrad was the first to cross into  Asia Minor, and, whether it were unskilfulness or treason, the guides  with whom he had been supplied by Manuel Comnenus led him so badly that,  on the 28th of October, 1147, he was surprised and shockingly beaten by  the Turks near Iconium.  An utter distrust of Greeks grew up amongst the  French, who had not yet left Constantinople; and some of their chiefs,  and even one of their prelates, the Bishop of Langres, proposed to make,  without further delay, an end of it with this emperor and empire, so  treacherously hostile, and to take Constantinople in order to march more  securely upon Jerusalem.  But King Louis and the majority of his knights  turned a deaf ear: \"We be come forth,\" said they, \"to expiate our own  sins, not to punish the crimes of the Greeks; when we took up the cross,  God did not put into our hands the sword of His justice;\" and they, in  their turn, crossed over into Asia Minor.  There they found the Germans  beaten and dispersed, and Conrad himself wounded and so discouraged that,  instead of pursuing his way by land with the French, he returned to  Constantinople to go thence by sea to Palestine.  Louis and his army  continued their march across Asia Minor, and gained in Phrygia, at the  passage of the river Meander, so brilliant a victory over the Turks that,  \"if such men,\" says the historian Nicetas, abstained from taking  Constantinople, one cannot but admire their moderation and forbearance.\"    [Illustration: Defeat of the Turks----16]    But the success was short, and, ere long, dearly paid for.  On entering  Pisidia, the French army split up into two, and afterwards into several  divisions, which scattered and lost themselves in the defiles of the  mountains.  The Turks waited for them, and attacked them at the mouths  and from the tops of the passes; before long there was nothing but  disorder and carnage; the little band which surrounded the king was cut  to pieces at his side; and Louis himself, with his back against a rock,  defended himself, alone, for some minutes, against several Turks, till  they, not knowing who he was, drew off, whereupon he, suddenly throwing  himself upon a stray horse, rejoined his advanced guard, who believed him  dead.  The army continued their march pell-mell, king, barons, knights,  soldiers, and pilgrims, uncertain day by day what would become of them on  the morrow.  The Turks harassed them afield; the towns in which there  were Greek governors residing refused to receive them; provisions fell  short; arms and baggage were abandoned on the road.  On arriving in  Pamphylia, at Satalia, a little port on the Mediterranean, the  impossibility of thus proceeding became evident; they were still, by  land, forty days' march from Antioch, whereas it required but three to  get there by sea.

The Count of  Flanders repaired to the king, who said, \"Your quarrel is ours; get you  back to Artois; we shall soon be there and within sight of our enemies.\"    Accordingly, in November, 1382, the King of France and his army marched  into Flanders.  Several towns, Cassel, Bergues, Gravelines, and Turnhout,  hastily submitted to him.    There was less complete unanimity and greater alarm amongst the Flemings  than their chiefs had anticipated.  \"Noble king,\" said the inhabitants,  \"we place our persons and our possessions at your discretion, and to show  you that we recognize you as our lawful lord, here are the captains whom  Van Artevelde gave us; do with them according to your will, for it is  they who have governed us.\"  On the 28th of November the two armies found  themselves close together at Rosebecque, between Ypres and Courtrai.  In  the evening Van Artevelde assembled his captains at supper, and,  \"Comrades,\" said he, \"we shall to-morrow have rough work, for the King of  France is here all agog for fighting.  But have no fear; we are defending  our good right and the liberties of Flanders.  The English have not  helped us; well, we shall only have the more honor.  With the King of  France is all the flower of his kingdom.  Tell your men to slay all, and  show no quarter.  We must spare the King of France only; he is a child,  and must be pardoned; we will take him away to Ghent, and have him taught  Flemish.  As for the dukes, counts, barons, and other men-at-arms, slay  them all; the commons of France shall not bear us ill will; I am quite  sure that they would not have a single one of them back.\"  At the very  same moment King Charles VI. was entertaining at supper the princes his  uncles, the Count of Flanders, the constable, Oliver de Clisson, the  marshals, &c.  They were arranging the order of battle for the morrow.  Many folks blamed the Duke of Burgundy for having brought so young a  king, the hope of the realm, into the perils of war.  It was resolved to  confide the care of him to the constable de Clisson, whilst conferring  upon Sire de Coucy, for that day only, the command of the army.  \"Most  dear lord,\" said the constable to the king, \"I know that there is no  greater honor than to have the care of your person; but it would be great  grief to my comrades not to have me with them.  I say not that they could  not do without me; but for a fortnight now I have been getting everything  ready for bringing most honor to you and yours.  They would be much  surprised if I should now withdraw.\"  The king was somewhat embarrassed.  \"Constable,\" said he, \"I would fain have you in my company to-day; you  know well that my lord my father loved you and trusted you more than any  other; in the name of God and St. Denis do whatever you think best.  You  have a clearer insight into the matter than I and those who have advised  me.  Only attend my mass to-morrow.\"  The battle began with spirit the  next morning, in the midst of a thick fog.  According to the monk of  St. Denis, Van Artevelde was not without disquietude.  He had bidden one  of his people go and observe the French army; and, \"You bring me bad  news,\" said he to the man in a whisper, \"when you tell me there are so  many French with the king: I was far from expecting it.  .  .  .  This is  a hard war; it requires discreet management.  I think the best thing for  me is to go and hurry up ten thousand of our comrades who are due.\"  \"Why  leave thy host without a head?\" said they who were about him: \"it was to  obey thy orders that we engaged in this enterprise; thou must run the  risks of battle with us.\"  The French were more confident than Van  Artevelde.  \"Sir,\" said the constable, addressing the king, cap in hand,  \"be of good cheer; these fellows are ours; our very varlets might beat  them.\"  These words were far too presumptuous; for the Flemings fought  with great bravery.  Drawn up in a compact body, they drove back for a  moment the French who were opposed to them; but Clisson had made  everything ready for hemming them in; attacked on all sides they tried,  but in vain, to fly; a few, with difficulty, succeeded in escaping and  casting, as they went, into the neighboring swamps the banner of St.  George.  \"It is not easy,\" says the monk of St. Denis, \"to set down with  any certainty the number of the dead; those who were present on this day,  and I am disposed to follow their account, say that twenty-five thousand  Flemings fell on the field, together with their leader, Van Artevelde,  the concoctor of this rebellion, whose corpse, discovered with great  trouble amongst a heap of slain, was, by order of Charles VI., hung upon  a tree in the neighborhood.  The French also lost in this struggle some  noble knights, not less illustrious by birth than valor, amongst others  forty-four valiant men who, being the first to hurl themselves upon the  ranks of the enemy to break them, thus won for themselves great glory.\"    The victory of Rosebecque was a great cause for satisfaction and pride to  Charles VI. and his uncle, the Duke of Burgundy.  They had conquered on  the field in Flanders the commonalty of Paris as well as that of Ghent;  and in France there was great need of such a success, for, since the  accession of the young king, the Parisians had risen with a demand for  actual abolition of the taxes of which Charles V., on his death-bed, had  deplored the necessity, and all but decreed the cessation.  The king's  uncles, his guardians, had at first stopped, and indeed suppressed, the  greater part of those taxes; but soon afterwards they had to face a  pressing necessity: the war with England was going on, and the revenues  of the royal domain were not sufficient for the maintenance of it.  The  Duke of Anjou attempted to renew the taxes, and one of Charles V.'s  former councillors, John Desmarets, advocate-general in parliament,  abetted him in his attempt.  Seven times, in the course of the year 1381,  assemblies of notables met at Paris to consider the project, and on the  1st of March, 1382, an agent of the governing power scoured the city at  full gallop, proclaiming the renewal of the principal tax.  There was a  fresh outbreak.  The populace, armed with all sorts of weapons, with  strong mallets amongst the rest, spread in all directions, killing the  collectors, and storming and plundering the Hotel de Ville.  They were  called the Malleteers.  They were put down, but with as much timidity as  cruelty.  Some of them were arrested, and at night thrown into the Seine,  sewn up in sacks, without other formality or trial.  A fresh meeting of  notables was convened, towards the middle of April, at Compiegne, and the  deputies from the principal towns were summoned to it; but they durst not  come to any decision: \"They were come,\" they said, \"only to hear and  report; they would use their best endeavors to prevail on those by whom  they had been sent to do the king's pleasure.\"  Towards the end of April  some of them returned to Meaux, reporting that they had everywhere met  with the most lively resistance; they had everywhere heard shouted at  them, \"Sooner death than the tax.\"  Only the deputies from Sens had voted  a tax, which was to be levied on all merchandise; but, when the question  of collecting it arose, the people of Sens evinced such violent  opposition that it had to be given up.  It was when facts and feelings  were in this condition in France, that Charles VI. and the Duke of  Burgundy had set out with their army to go and force the Flemish communes  to submit to their count.    [Illustration: The Procession went over the Gates----16]    Returning victorious from Flanders to France, Charles VI. and his uncles,  everywhere brilliantly feasted on their march, went first of all for nine  days to Compiegne, \"to find recreation after their fatigues,\" says the  monk of St.  Denis, \"in the pleasures of the chase; afterwards, on the  10th of January, 1383, the king took back in state to the church of St.  Denis the oriflamme which he had borne away on his expedition; and next  day, the 11th of January, he re-entered Paris, he alone being mounted, in  the midst of his army.\"  The burgesses went out of the city to meet him,  and offer him their wonted homage, but they were curtly ordered to  retrace their steps; the king and his uncles, they were informed, could  not forget offences so recent.  The wooden barriers which had been placed  before the gates of the city to prevent anybody from entering without  permission, were cut down with battle-axes; the very gates were torn from  their hinges; they were thrown down upon the king's highway, and the  procession went over them, as if to trample under foot the fierce pride  of the Parisians.  When he was once in the city, and was leaving Notre  Dame, the king sent abroad throughout all the streets an order forbidding  any one, under the most severe penalties, from insulting or causing the  least harm to the burgesses in any way whatsoever; and the constable had  two plunderers strung up to the windows of the houses in which they had  committed their thefts.  But fundamental order having been thus upheld,  reprisals began to be taken for the outbreaks of the Parisians, municipal  magistrates or populace, burgesses or artisans, rich or poor, in the  course of the two preceding years;--arrests, imprisonments, fines,  confiscations, executions, severities of all kinds fell upon the most  conspicuous and the most formidable of those who had headed or favored  popular movements.  The most solemn and most iniquitous of these  punishments was that which befell the advocate-general, John Desmarets.  \"For nearly a whole year,\" says the monk of St. Denis, \"he had served as  mediator between the king and the Parisians; he had often restrained the  fury and stopped the excesses of the populace, by preventing them "]]]
