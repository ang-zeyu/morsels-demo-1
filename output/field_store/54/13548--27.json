Their doors closed against me, and the  spell was broken.    Edinburgh is full of interesting localities; particularly the old town. In  its ancient \"wynds and closes,\" now tenanted by the veriest of the plebeian  race, in former days resided men of the most distinguished rank and  celebrity. Before the stupendous improvements of later times had justly  entitled the Scottish metropolis to the appellation of the modern Athens,  the princes and nobles of the land, its judges and senators, were obliged  to dwell in those dirty streets and alleys, from which \"Auld Reekie\"  derived its then appropriate appellation. When in progress of time they  removed to more splendid and suitable abodes, their abandoned tenements  became habitations of wretchedness. Much however remained in them to remind  posterity of their former proprietors; and whoever is not afraid of  encountering the spectacle of a swarming population in a state of abject  and squalid poverty, will find an abundant field for his antiquarian  researches in the old town of Edinburgh. Like Switzerland, and other  mountainous countries, Scotland is by nature formed to be a land of  romantic associations; but how wonderfully have her historians, poets, and  novelists contributed to create and preserve them! The author of Waverley  has thrown a classic halo around the wild beauties of his native land, and  communicated to stranger minds a national enthusiasm which _his_ soul alone  could have felt, _his_ pen alone inspired! In Scotland, almost every step  we take is on hallowed ground, and the lover of historical recollections  may enjoy to its full extent the delight of visiting places immortalized by  the achievements of her heroes, or the pen of her poets.    To a man fond of localities, travelling either on the continent or in  England, will furnish numerous opportunities of indulging the reveries to  which they give birth. It would be hardly possible to name a town, or a  village, utterly destitute of local interest. In almost every instance,  some memento would be discovered to hallow its site, and to engage the  observation of an intelligent traveller. With a mind predisposed to enjoy  mental associations, they will crowd on us wherever we go, and be suggested  by the veriest trifles. Rousseau could not contain his ecstacy at  beholding a little flower (_la parvenche_) in bloom, which thirty years  before, Madame de Warens had first pointed out to his notice. That simple  incident summoned up a train of exquisite reminiscences. No one, indeed,  ever yielded so entirely to the influence of local enthusiasm as the author  of the _Nouvelle Heloise_. No one has so successfully attempted to invest  scenes, in themselves beautiful, with the additional and powerful interest  of ideal recollections. Picturesque as are the shores of Leman, Meillerie,  and Vevai, yet to Rousseau's sublime conceptions and eloquent descriptions,  they are chiefly indebted for the celebrity which they enjoy. Nature made  Switzerland a land of rugged magnificence. To complete the charm, nothing  was wanted, but that its mountains should be peopled by the creations of  Rousseau.    It were needless, however, to travel to foreign countries in search of  interesting localities. Our own island teems with them. In the metropolis  and its environs, a diligent inquirer will find them at every step. How  many coffeehouses and taverns are there in London which at one time or  another have been frequented by celebrated characters, and how many houses  in which others equally celebrated have resided; such as that of Milton, in  Westminster; and of Johnson, in Bolt Court. How many old gable-ended  tenements do we see in the eastern parts of the town that were standing  before the fire, and which, if explored, might be found to contain the most  interesting relics of antiquity. What a number of streets, courts, and  alleys, bearing names at once indicative of their ancient origin, and of  scenes, and persons, and local circumstances long since forgotten!    Then, if we extend our perambulations to the vicinity of London, how many  hallowed places shall we meet with? Where can we find a palace like Windsor  Castle, to which attach the historical recollections of many centuries,  adding, if possible, yet more solemnity to Gothic grandeur? Again, can  there be conceived a spot more entirely consecrated to classical  associations than the grotto, at Twickenham; that retreat in which gazing  on \"Thames translucent stream,\" Pope passed so many hours of undisturbed  privacy--that spot      \"Where British sighs from dying Wyndham stole,    And the bright flame was shot thro' Marchmont's soul.\"    I have visited it in summer, when the warmth of a mid-day sun has rendered  the \"_frigus amabile_\" of the interior doubly inviting, and on such  occasions, have quite revelled in local enthusiasm.    I remember, some years since, visiting the Duke of Devonshire's beautiful  villa, at Chiswick, in company with a friend, whose sentiments on the  subject of local impressions are similar to my own. While I was admiring  books and paintings in the library, my companion was contemplating in mute  emotion, the bed upon which Charles Fox breathed his last. That one object  engrossed all the powers of his soul; every other was forgotten!    C. J.           *       *       *       *       *      THE HUMBLE SPARROW'S ADDRESS TO T. S. A.    (_For the Mirror._)        My dearest Sir, how great a change    Has pass'd upon the groves I range,          Nay, all the face of nature!    A few weeks back, each pendent bough,    The fields, the groves, the mountain's brow,    Were bare and leafless all, but now          How verdant ev'ry feature!      Each little songster strives to raise    Its highest warbling notes of praise,          For all these blessings given:--    Ere Sol emerges from behind    The eastern hills, the lark we find    Soars, as it were on wings of wind,          With grateful notes to heaven.      A thousand others catch the strains,    Each bush and tree a tongue contains,          That offers up its praises.    From morn till the meridian day,    From noon till Sol has sunk away,    One ceaseless song, one grateful lay,          Each feather'd songster raises.      And when Night's grim and sable band,    Spreads her dim curtains o'er the land,          And all our prospect closes;    Then Philomela, queen of song,    The sweetest of the feather'd throng,    Takes up the theme the whole night long,          While nature all reposes.      Then surely I, the humblest bird,    That e'er among the groves was heard,          Should aid the thankful chorus;    With _chirping note_ I'll join the sound,    For not _a Sparrow_, 'twill be found,    Without HIS will falls to the ground,          Who high above reigns o'er us.      But what avail my feeble powers,    When softer notes descend in showers,          Mine are not worth regarding;    No honour'd title gilds my name,    No dulcet notes I e'er could claim;    So worthless I, you may obtain          _Two Sparrows_ for a farthing.      Besides, I ne'er was form'd to _sing_,    And so must soar on humbler wing,          Since nature saw it fitter;    But yet my feeble powers I'll try,    And sound my _chatt'ring_ notes on high,    For I am sure you'll not deny          To hear my simple _twitter_.      My gratitude is doubly due,    For all the hedges[2] in my view,          Afford a verdant cover;    I now can build my nest once more,    From childhood's prying glance secure,    And from the hawk's keen eye, tho' o'er          The sacred bush he hover.      Oh! had I Philomela's tongue,    The thrush's note, or warbling song          Of blackbird, lark, or linnet;    I'd then more gratitude display,    Striving to raise a sweeter lay,    I'd sing the fleeting hours away,          Nor silent be a minute.      But I must quit the trembling spray,    And to my duty fly away,          To pick a straw or feather;    My mate is somewhere on the wing,    I think she's gone some moss to bring,    For we must work while it is spring,          And build our nest together.      So now adieu--I've chirp'd too long,    Must leave the finish of my song          To some more learned bird's son;    Whose mellow notes can charm the ear    With no discordant chatter near;    So now, dear Sir, I'm your sincere          And humble Sparrow.

Yet why upo' so sma' a flower,    Dost thou exert thy deadly pow'r,    And nip fair beauty's natal hour,                  Wi' thy vile breath,    It is when wint'ry storms do low'r,                  We look for death.      But thou, thou evil one, hast come,    To bring this wee rose to its doom,    Not i' time of woe and gloom,                  But i' the spring,    When flowerets just begin to bloom.                  And birds to sing.      O fie, begone fra out my sight,    Nor dare attempt such joy to blight,    Thou evil wicked-doing doit,                  Then hie away,    Seek not the _morning_, but the _night_                  To crush thy prey!

But to be truthful, to be honest, to  be kind, to be brave, these had been taught him, and he never _quite_  forgot the lesson; nor amid the sorrows of after life did he ever quite  lose the sense--learnt at dear quiet Fairholm--of a present loving God,  of a tender and long-suffering Father.    As yet he could be hardly said to know what school was. He had been sent  indeed to Mr. Lawley's grammar-school for the last half-year, and had  learned a few declensions in his Latin grammar. But as Mr. Lawley  allowed his upper class to hear the little boys their lessons, Eric had  managed to get on pretty much as he liked. Only _once_ in the entire  half-year had he said a lesson to the dreadful master himself, and of  course it was a ruinous failure, involving some tremendous pulls of  Eric's hair, and making him tremble like a leaf. Several things combined  to make Mr. Lawley dreadful to his imagination. Ever since he was quite  little, he remembered hearing the howls which proceeded from the \"Latin  school\" as he passed by, whilst some luckless youngster was getting  caned; and the reverend pedagogue was notoriously passionate. Then,  again, he spoke so indistinctly with his deep, gruff voice, that Eric  never could and never did syllable a word he said, and this kept him in  a perpetual terror. Once Mr. Lawley had told him to go out, and see what  time it was by the church clock. Only hearing that he was to do  something, too frightened to ask what it was, and feeling sure that even  if he did, he should not understand what the master said, Eric ran out,  went straight to Mr. Lawley's house, and after having managed by  strenuous jumps to touch the knocker, informed the servant \"that Mr.  Lawley wanted his man.\"    \"What man?\" said the maid-servant, \"the young man? or the butler? or is  it the clerk?\"    Here was a puzzler! all Eric knew was that he was in the habit of  sending sometimes for one or the other of these functionaries; but he  was in for it, so with a faltering voice he said \"the young man\" at  hazard, and went back to the Latin school.    \"Why have you been so long?\" roared Mr. Lawley, as he timidly entered.  Fear entirely prevented Eric from hearing what was said, so he answered  at random, \"He's coming, sir.\" The master, seeing by his scared look  that something was wrong, waited to see what would turn up.    Soon after, in walked \"the young man,\" and coming to the astonished Mr.  Lawley, bowed, scraped, and said, \"Master Williams said you sent for  me, sir.\"    \"A mistake,\" growled the schoolmaster, turning on Eric a look which  nearly petrified him; he quite expected a book at his head, or at best a  great whack of the cane; but Mr. Lawley had naturally a kind heart,  soured as it was, and pitying perhaps the child's white face, he  contented himself with the effects of his look.    The simple truth was, that poor Mr. Lawley was a little wrong in the  head. A scholar and a gentleman, early misfortunes and an imprudent  marriage had driven him to the mastership of the little country  grammar-school; and here the perpetual annoyance caused to his refined  mind by the coarseness of clumsy or spiteful boys, had gradually  unhinged his intellect. Often did he tell the boys \"that it was an  easier life by far to break stones by the roadside than to teach them;\"  and at last his eccentricities became too obvious to be any longer  overlooked.    The denouement of his history was a tragic one, and had come a few days  before the time when, our narrative opens. It was a common practice  among the Latin school boys, as I suppose among all boys, to amuse  themselves by putting a heavy book on the top of a door left partially  ajar, and to cry out \"Crown him\" as the first luckless youngster who  happened to come in received the book thundering on his head. One day,  just as the trap had been adroitly laid, Mr. Lawley walked in  unexpectedly. The moment he entered the school-room, down came an  Ainsworth's Dictionary on the top of his hat, and the boy, concealed  behind the door, unconscious of who the victim was, enunciated with mock  gravity, \"Crown him! three cheers.\"    It took Mr. Lawley a second to raise from his eyebrows the battered hat,  and recover from his confusion; the next instant he was springing after  the boy who had caused the mishap, and who, knowing the effects of the  master's fury, fled with precipitation. In one minute the offender was  caught, and Mr. Lawley's heavy hand fell recklessly on his ears and  back, until he screamed with terror. At last by a tremendous writhe,  wrenching himself free, he darted towards the door, and Mr. Lawley, too  exhausted to pursue, snatched his large gold watch out of his fob, and  hurled it at the boy's retreating figure. The watch flew through the  air;--crash! it had missed its aim, and, striking the wall above the  lintel, fell smashed into a thousand shivers.    The sound, the violence of the action, the sight of the broken watch,  which was the gift of a cherished friend, instantly woke the master to  his senses. The whole school had seen it; they sate there pale and  breathless with excitement and awe. The poor man could bear it no  longer. He flung himself into his chair, hid his face with his hands,  and burst into hysterical tears. It was the outbreak of feelings long  pent up. In that instant all his life passed before him--its hopes, its  failures, its miseries, its madness. \"Yes!\" he thought, \"I am mad.\"    Raising his head, he cried wildly, \"Boys, go, I am mad!\" and sank again  into his former position, rocking himself to and fro. One by one the  boys stole out, and he was left alone. The end is soon told. Forced to  leave Ayrton, he had no means of earning his daily bread; and the weight  of this new anxiety hastening the crisis, the handsome proud scholar  became an inmate of the Brerely Lunatic Asylum. A few years afterwards,  Eric heard that he was dead. Poor broken human heart! may he rest  in peace.    Such was Eric's first school and schoolmaster. But although he learnt  little there, and gained no experience of the character of others or of  his own, yet there was one point about Ayrton Latin School, which he  never regretted. It was the mixture there of all classes. On those  benches gentlemen's sons sat side by side with plebeians, and no harm,  but only good, seemed to come from the intercourse. The neighboring  gentry, most of whom had begun their education there, were drawn into  closer and kindlier union with their neighbors and dependents, from the  fact of having been their associates in the days of their boyhood. Many  a time afterwards, when Eric, as he passed down the streets,  interchanged friendly greetings with some young glazier or tradesman  whom he remembered at school, he felt glad that thus early he had learnt  practically to despise the accidental and nominal differences which  separate man from man.        CHAPTER II    A NEW HOME         \"Life hath its May, and all is joyous then;       The woods are vocal and the flowers breathe odour,       The very breeze hath, mirth in't.\"--OLD PLAY.    At last the longed-for yet dreaded day approached, and a letter informed  the Trevors that Mr. and Mrs. Williams would arrive at Southampton on  July 5th, and would probably reach Ayrton the evening after. They  particularly requested that no one should come to meet them on their  landing. \"We shall reach Southampton,\" wrote Mrs. Trevor, \"tired, pale,  and travel-stained, and had much rather see you first at dear Fairholm,  where we shall be spared the painful constraint of a meeting in public.  So please expect our arrival at about seven in the evening.\"    Poor Eric! although he had been longing for the time ever since the news  came, yet now he was too agitated to enjoy. Exertion and expectation  made him restless, and he could settle down to nothing all day, every  hour of which hung most heavily on his hands.    At last the afternoon wore away, and a soft summer evening filled the  sky with its gorgeous calm. Far off they caught the sound of wheels; a  carriage dashed up to the door, and the next moment Eric sprang into his  mother's arms.    \"O mother, mother!\"    \"My own darling, darling boy!\"    And as the pale sweet face of the mother met the bright and rosy  child-face, each of them was wet with a rush of ineffable tears. In  another moment Eric had been folded to his father's heart, and locked in  the arms of \"little brother Vernon.\" Who shall describe the emotions of  those few moments? they did not seem like earthly moments; they seemed  to belong not to time, but to eternity.    The first evening of such a scene is too excited to be happy. The little  party at Fairholm retired early, and Eric was soon fast asleep with his  arm round his newfound brother's neck.    Quiet steps entered the little room, and noiselessly the father and  mother sat down by the bedside of their children. Earth could have shown  no scene more perfect in its beauty than that which met their eyes. The  pure moonlight flooded the little room, and showed distinctly the forms  and countenances of the sleepers, whose soft regular breathing was the  only sound that broke the stillness of the July night. The small shining  flower-like faces, with their fair hair--the trustful loving arms folded  round each brother's neck--the closed lids and parted lips made an  exquisite picture, and one never to be forgotten. Side by side, without  a word, the parents knelt down, and with eyes wet with tears of  joyfulness, poured out their hearts in passionate prayer for their young  and beloved boys.    Very happily the next month glided away; a new life seemed opened to  Eric in the world of rich affections which had unfolded itself before  him. His parents--above all, his mother--were"]]]
