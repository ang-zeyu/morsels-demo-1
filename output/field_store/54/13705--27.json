[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14742"],[0,"Vanishing England (#2)"],[1,"ourselves in the midst of a  busy, bustling world that knows no rest or peace. Inventions tread  upon each other's heels in one long vast bewildering procession. We  look back at the peaceful reign of the pack-horse, the rumbling wagon,  the advent of the merry coaching days, the \"Lightning\" and the  \"Quicksilver,\" the chaining of the rivers with locks and bars, the  network of canals that spread over the whole country; and then the  first shriek of the railway engine startled the echoes of the  countryside, a poor powerless thing that had to be pulled up the steep  gradients by a chain attached to a big stationary engine at the  summit. But it was the herald of the doom of the old-world England.  Highways and coaching roads, canals and rivers, were abandoned and  deserted. The old coachmen, once lords of the road, ended their days  in the poorhouse, and steam, almighty steam, ruled everywhere.    Now the wayside inns wake up again with the bellow of the motor-car,  which like a hideous monster rushes through the old-world villages,  startling and killing old slow-footed rustics and scampering children,  dogs and hens, and clouds of dust strive in very mercy to hide the  view of the terrible rushing demon. In a few years' time the air will  be conquered, and aeroplanes, balloons, flying-machines and air-ships,  will drop down upon us from the skies and add a new terror to life.      Not in vain the distance beacons. Forward, forward let us range,    Let the great world spin for ever down the ringing grooves of change.    Life is for ever changing, and doubtless everything is for the best in  this best of possible worlds; but the antiquary may be forgiven for  mourning over the destruction of many of the picturesque features of  bygone times and revelling in the recollections of the past. The  half-educated and the progressive--I attach no political meaning to  the term--delight in their present environment, and care not to  inquire too deeply into the origin of things; the study of evolution  and development is outside their sphere; but yet, as Dean Church once  wisely said, \"In our eagerness for improvement it concerns us to be  on our guard against the temptation of thinking that we can have the  fruit or the flower, and yet destroy the root.... It concerns us that  we do not despise our birthright and cast away our heritage of gifts  and of powers, which we may lose, but not recover.\"    Every day witnesses the destruction of some old link with the past  life of the people of England. A stone here, a buttress there--it  matters not; these are of no consequence to the innovator or the  iconoclast. If it may be our privilege to prevent any further  spoliation of the heritage of Englishmen, if we can awaken any respect  or reverence for the work of our forefathers, the labours of both  artist and author will not have been in vain. Our heritage has been  sadly diminished, but it has not yet altogether disappeared, and it is  our object to try to record some of those objects of interest which  are so fast perishing and vanishing from our view, in order that the  remembrance of all the treasures that our country possesses may not  disappear with them.    The beauty of our English scenery has in many parts of the country  entirely vanished, never to return. Coal-pits, blasting furnaces,  factories, and railways have converted once smiling landscapes and  pretty villages into an inferno of black smoke, hideous mounds of  ashes, huge mills with lofty chimneys belching forth clouds of smoke  that kills vegetation and covers the leaves of trees and plants with  exhalations. I remember attending at Oxford a lecture delivered by the  late Mr. Ruskin. He produced a charming drawing by Turner of a  beautiful old bridge spanning a clear stream, the banks of which were  clad with trees and foliage. The sun shone brightly, and the sky was  blue, with fleeting clouds. \"This is what you are doing with your  scenery,\" said the lecturer, as he took his palette and brushes; he  began to paint on the glass that covered the picture, and in a few  minutes the scene was transformed. Instead of the beautiful bridge a  hideous iron girder structure spanned the stream, which was no longer  pellucid and clear, but black as the Styx; instead of the trees arose  a monstrous mill with a tall chimney vomiting black smoke that spread  in heavy clouds, hiding the sun and the blue sky. \"That is* what you  are doing with your scenery,\" concluded Mr. Ruskin--a true picture of  the penalty we pay for trade, progress, and the pursuit of wealth. We  are losing faith in the testimony of our poets and painters to the  beauty of the English landscape which has inspired their art, and much  of the charm of our scenery in many parts has vanished. We happily  have some of it left still where factories are not, some interesting  objects that artists love to paint. It is well that they should be  recorded before they too pass away.       *Transcriber's Note: Original \"it\".    [Illustration: Rural Tenements, Capel, Surrey]    Old houses of both peer and peasant and their contents are sooner or  later doomed to destruction. Historic mansions full of priceless  treasures amassed by succeeding generations of old families fall a  prey to relentless fire. Old panelled rooms and the ancient  floor-timbers understand not the latest experiments in electric  lighting, and yield themselves to the flames with scarce a struggle.  Our forefathers were content with hangings to keep out the draughts  and open fireplaces to keep them warm. They were a hardy race, and  feared not a touch or breath of cold. Their degenerate sons must have  an elaborate heating apparatus, which again distresses the old timbers  of the house and fires their hearts of oak. Our forefathers, indeed,  left behind them a terrible legacy of danger--that beam in the  chimney, which has caused the destruction of many country houses.  Perhaps it was not so great a source of danger in the days of the old  wood fires. It is deadly enough when huge coal fires burn in the  grates. It is a dangerous, subtle thing. For days, or even for a week  or two, it will smoulder and smoulder; and then at last it will blaze  up, and the old house with all its precious contents is wrecked.    The power of the purse of American millionaires also tends greatly to  the vanishing of much that is English--the treasures of English art,  rare pictures and books, and even of houses. Some nobleman or  gentleman, through the extravagance of himself or his ancestors, or on  account of the pressure of death duties, finds himself impoverished.  Some of our great art dealers hear of his unhappy state, and knowing  that he has some fine paintings--a Vandyke or a Romney--offer him  twenty-five or thirty thousand pounds for a work of art. The  temptation proves irresistible. The picture is sold, and soon finds  its way into the gallery of a rich American, no one in England having  the power or the good taste to purchase it. We spend our money in  other ways. The following conversation was overheard at Christie's:  \"Here is a beautiful thing; you should buy it,\" said the speaker to a  newly fledged baronet. \"I'm afraid I can't afford it,\" replied the  baronet. \"Not afford it?\" replied his companion. \"It will cost you  infinitely less than a baronetcy and do you infinitely more credit.\"  The new baronet seemed rather offended. At the great art sales rare  folios of Shakespeare, pictures, Sevres, miniatures from English  houses are put up for auction, and of course find their way to  America. Sometimes our cousins from across the Atlantic fail to secure  their treasures. They have striven very eagerly to buy Milton's  cottage at Chalfont St. Giles, for transportation to America; but this  effort has happily been successfully resisted. The carved table in  the cottage was much sought after, and was with difficulty retained  against an offer of L150. An old window of fifteenth-century  workmanship in an old house at Shrewsbury was nearly exploited by an  enterprising American for the sum of L250; and some years ago an  application was received by the Home Secretary for permission to  unearth the body of William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania, from  its grave in the burial-ground of Jordans, near Chalfont St. Giles,  and transport it to Philadelphia. This action was successfully opposed  by the trustees of the burial-ground, but it was considered expedient  to watch the ground for some time to guard against the possibility of  any illicit attempts at removal.    [Illustration: Detail of Seventeenth-century Table in Milton's  Cottage, Chalfont St. Giles]    It was reported that an American purchaser had been more successful at  Ipswich, where in 1907 a Tudor house and corner-post, it was said, had  been secured by a London firm for shipment to America. We are glad to  hear that this report was incorrect, that the purchaser was an English  lord, who re-erected the house in his park.    Wanton destruction is another cause of the disappearance of old  mansions. Fashions change even in house-building. Many people prefer  new lamps to old ones, though the old ones alone can summon genii and  recall the glories of the past, the associations of centuries of  family life, and the stories of ancestral prowess. Sometimes fashion  decrees the downfall of old houses. Such a fashion raged at the  beginning of the last century, when every one wanted a brand-new house  built after the Palladian style; and the old weather-beaten pile that  had sheltered the family for generations, and was of good old English  design with nothing foreign or strange about it, was compelled to give  place to a new-fangled dwelling-place which was neither beautiful nor  comfortable. Indeed, a great wit once advised the builder of one of  these mansions to hire a room on the other side of the road and spend  his days looking at his Palladian house, but to be sure not to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14760"],[0,"Report of the Special Committee on Moral Delinquency in Children and Adolescents (#2)"],[1,"as much again as the sexual crime in  England and Wales. The reasons why the Committee does not accept this  statement at its face value are stated later under Section IV (2).      =(2) Press Reports from Overseas=    In view of the fact that the happenings in the Hutt Valley were reported  in all New Zealand newspapers, and by many newspapers in Australia and  Great Britain, the Committee points out that the increase of sexual  delinquency is not confined to any one district or any one country.    It cannot be too strongly asserted that the great majority of the young  people of the Hutt Valley are as healthy-minded and as well behaved as  those in other districts, whether in New Zealand or elsewhere. It just  happened that, through the voluntary confession of one girl in Petone,  many cases were immediately brought to the knowledge of the police.    In the absence of comparable statistics from other countries, the  Committee can merely quote from some of the reports received in New  Zealand at about the same time that the Hutt Valley cases were reported.    (_a_) _England_        In Monmouthshire last year there was an increase of 88 per cent      in sexual offences. The biggest increases recorded were for      indecent assault on females--132 in 1953, compared with 75 in      1952--and for offences against girls under 16 years of age. In      his annual report the Chief Constable states that this shocking      record is a further indication of the general lowering of moral      standards ...--_The \"Police Review\" (London), 19 February 1954._      (_b_) _New South Wales_            POLICE UNCOVER WILD TEENAGE SEX ORGIES        Detectives have uncovered evidence of an amazing sex cult in      which a bodgie \"high priest\" and a number of pretty teenagers      indulged in wild orgies in a Sydney suburb.        It is alleged that the \"high priest\" made the girls participate      in lewd rituals, swear a profane oath on \"the bodgies' bible\"      and worship at a \"bodgies' altar\".        Following these sensational allegations, four men were      arrested. Police expect to arrest another seven. Disappearance      of the 15-year-old daughter of a respected Erskineville family      started the police investigation which uncovered the sex cult.      Both the girl and the \"high priest\" undressed, and, as she lay      on a bed, he compelled her to engage in grossly obscene acts      with him.        Then, while the \"high priest\" performed a gross act of      indecency, the girl swore the \"widgies' oath\" on the \"bodgies'      bible\".--_Sydney \"Truth\" 27 June 1954._      (_c_) _South Australia_            ADELAIDE POLICE SEIZE TEENAGERS IN SWIFT RAIDS        In a series of lightning raids Port Adelaide police have      arrested six teenagers who they claim are members of a sex cult.      Vice Squad detectives say the cult indulged in sex and drug      parties. The Port Adelaide Police Chief Inspector, G.E.      Mensfort, said that when the cases came to Court he suspected      revelations similar to those in the Hutt Valley, which recently      shocked New Zealand. A number of teenage youths have already      appeared in Port Adelaide Police and Juvenile Courts on carnal      knowledge charges ...--_Telegram in the \"Dominion\", 30 July      1954._      (_d_) _London_            MANY GIRLS IN BAD COMPANY        One black spot in an otherwise more optimistic report by the      Police Commissioner on crime in London is a disturbing increase      in the number of 17-and 18-year-old girls who are coming under      the notice of policewomen on their beat, says the _Daily      Mirror_.--_N.Z.P.A. to \"Evening Post\", 2 September 1954_.      =(3) A World-wide Problem=    There have been waves of sexual crime in various countries at various  times.    Juvenile delinquency itself has been the subject of much research  (especially in the United States) during the past fifty years. But  although such offences as indecent exposure and sexual assault by  juniors have been included in published figures, no special mention has  been found by this Committee of the aspect of sexual delinquency now  being discussed in New Zealand. What is entirely new in New Zealand (and  probably in other places, too) is the attitude of mind of some young  people to sexual indulgence with one another, their planning and  organization of it, and their assumption that when they consent together  they are not doing anything wrong.    Clergymen and publicists in various parts of the world have been  declaiming about illicit sexual practices and their effects on young  people, but this is the first time that any Government has set up a  Committee to sift the available data on sexual misbehaviour with a view  to finding the cause and suggesting a remedy.    While this report was being typed there appeared in the local  newspapers the following telegram despatched from London on September  14:            INQUIRY INTO VICE WAVE IN BRITAIN        A Government committee, including three women, is to open      tomorrow a searching probe into Britain's homosexuals and      prostitutes, to decide whether the country's vice laws should be      changed.        The Government's decision to set up the committee followed      public alarm at the vice wave in Britain, highlighted by a steep      increase in homosexual offences.        The Home Secretary, Sir David Maxwell Fyfe, has charged the      committee with considering the law and practice relating to      homosexual offences and the treatment of persons convicted of      such offences, and offences against the criminal law in      connection with prostitution and solicitation for immoral      purposes. According to the police, prostitutes in London alone      have soared to a record of more than 10,000. Convictions for      sexual offences exceed 5,000 a year, compared with the immediate      pre-war total of 2,300. The figures for male homosexual offences      have bounded even more sharply.    The extent of juvenile immorality in New Zealand may have been greatly  magnified abroad. If the good name of this Dominion has been sullied by  these reports, the Committee hopes that any damage may be repaired by  setting out the facts in their true perspective and by demonstrating  that we can, and will, do something in the interests of morality which  may also give a lead to other countries.          _II. Order of Reference and Procedure Followed_      On 23 July 1954 a Special Committee was appointed by the Government with  the following Order of Reference:      _To inquire into and to report upon conditions and influences that    tend to undermine standards of sexual morality of children and    adolescents in New Zealand, and the extent to which such    conditions and influences are operative, and to make    recommendations to the Government for positive action by both    public and private agencies, or otherwise._    The Committee held its first meeting on Tuesday, 27 July, to determine  points of procedure and to make arrangements to hear all who desired to  make submissions. There were placed before the Committee files of  letters which had been written to Ministers of the Crown, and hundreds  of newspaper clippings, relating to this topic. Some days were occupied  in the sorting and reading of this material in anticipation of the task  which lay ahead.    The Committee commenced the hearing of evidence at Wellington on  Tuesday, 3 August. It sat in Christchurch for the convenience of people  in the South Island on 31 August and 1 September, and in Auckland from 6  September to 10 September.    Altogether 145 persons (18 on more than one occasion), appearing either  in a representative capacity or as private individuals, were heard. In  addition, 203 written submissions were made by interested organizations  and private persons, and a large volume of relevant correspondence,  addressed direct to the Committee, was considered. A list of the persons  who appeared before the Committee and of the organizations or societies  which made either written or oral representations is attached.    It should here be observed that the Committee, not having the powers of  a Commission of Inquiry, could not summon witnesses before it. All  officers of the Crown, and all public agencies from whom information was  sought, were helpful. Much of the evidence, however, was secondary or  hearsay evidence. The Committee had not the power to trace some of the  stated facts back to their source.    It was thought undesirable to interview any of the children involved in  recent happenings. Reliance had to be placed on information regarding  each individual made available by the police and Child Welfare Officers,  and, in some cases, by the heads of their respective schools. Similarly,  there was much secondary evidence of indecent behaviour and of other  facts said to have been derived from reliable sources. The absence of  direct evidence on some of these matters, however, did not prevent the  Committee from looking at the problem in its broad general aspects, and  from reaching conclusions which could not be affected by a closer  scrutiny of some of the individual matters narrated to the Committee.          _III. Narrative_      =(1) The Hutt Valley Cases=    Before proceeding to examine the extent of sexual laxity among children  and adolescents it is convenient to narrate the factual happenings which  caused this problem to assume such large proportions in the public mind  in July and August last.    On the 20th day of June 1954 information was sought from the police  concerning the whereabouts of a girl 15-1/2 years of age who was missing  from her home at Petone. A few hours later this girl called at the  Petone Police Station. She stated that, being unhappy at home with her  stepfather, she had, since the previous Christmas, been a member of what  she called a \"Milk Bar Gang\" which (in her own words) met \"mostly for  sex purposes\";"]]]
