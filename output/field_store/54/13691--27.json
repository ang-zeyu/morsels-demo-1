But what appeared to me to have made the greatest change, and has  probably had more effect on the Ornithology of the Island, especially of  that part known as the Vale, is the enormous number of granite quarries  which are being worked there (luckily the beautiful cliffs have hitherto  escaped the granite in those parts, probably not being so good); but in  the Vale from St. Samson's to Fort Doyle, and from there to the Vale  Church, with the exception of L'Ancresse Common itself, which has  hitherto escaped, the whole face of the country is changed by quarry  works and covered with small windmills used for pumping the water from  the quarries. These quarry works and the extra population brought by  them into the Island, all of whom carry guns and shoot everything that  is fit to eat or is likely to fetch a few \"doubles\" in the market, have  done a good deal to thin the birds in that part of the Islands,  especially such as are in any way fit for sale or food, and probably  have done more to make a change in the Ornithology of that part of the  Island than all the agricultural changes mentioned by Mr. MacCulloch.  Indeed, I am rather sceptical as to the agricultural changes above  described having produced so much change in the avifauna of the Islands  during the last fifty years as Mr. MacCulloch appears to think; there is  still a great deal of undrained or badly drained land in the  Island--especially about the Vale, the Grand Mare and L'Eree--which  might still afford a home for Moorhens, Water Rails, and even Bitterns,  and all that class of wading birds which delight in swampy land and reed  beds. Though no doubt, as Mr. MacCulloch said, many orchards have been  destroyed to make room for more profitable crops or for orchard-houses,  still there are many orchards left in the Island. I think, however,  many, if not all the cherry orchards (amongst which the Golden Orioles  apparently at one time luxuriated) are gone. There is also still a great  deal of hedgerow timber, none of it indeed very large, but in places  very thick; in fact, I could point out miles of hedges in Guernsey where  the trees, mostly elm, grow so thick together that it would be nearly  impossible to pick out a place where one could squeeze one's horse  between the trees without rubbing one's knees on one side or the other,  probably on both, against them, if one found it necessary to ride across  the country. True, on a great extent of the higher part of the Island,  all along on both sides of what is known as the Forest Road, there is  little or no hedgerow timber, the fields here being divided by low banks  with furze growing on the top of them. Furze brakes also are still  numerous, the whole of the flat land on the top of the cliffs and the  steep valleys and slopes down to the sea on the south and east side of  the Island, from Fermain Bay to Pleimont, being almost uninterrupted  wild land covered with heather, furze, and bracken; besides this wild  furze land, there are several thick furze brakes inland in different  parts of the Island. All these places seem to me to have remained almost  without change for years. The furze, however, never grows very high, as  it is cut every few years for fuel; in consequence of this, however, it  is more beautiful in blooming in the spring than if it had been allowed  several years' growth, covering the whole face of the ground above the  cliffs like a brilliant yellow carpet; but being kept so short, it is  not perhaps so convenient for nesting purposes as if it was allowed a  longer growth.    The Guernsey Bird Act, which applies to all the Islands in the  Bailiwick, and has been in force for some few years, seems to me to have  had little effect on the numbers of the sea-birds of the district,  though it includes the eggs as well as the birds, except perhaps to  increase the number of Herring Gulls and Shags (which were always  sufficiently numerous) in their old breeding-stations, and perhaps to  have added a few new breeding-stations. These two birds scarcely needed  the protection afforded by the Act, as their nests are placed amongst  very inaccessible rocks where very few nests can be reached without the  aid of a rope, and consequently but little damage was done beyond a few  young birds being shot soon after they had left the nest while they were  flappers, and the numbers were fully kept up; other birds, however,  included in the Act, and not breeding in quite such inaccessible places,  seem to gain but little advantage from it, as nests of the Lesser  Black-backed Gulls, Terns, Oystercatchers and Puffins are ruthlessly  robbed in a way that bids fair before long to exterminate all four  species as breeding birds; perhaps, also, the increase in the number of  Herring Gulls does something to diminish the numbers of other breeding  species, especially the Lesser Black-backs, as Herring Gulls are great  robbers both of eggs and young birds. The Act itself, after reciting  that \"le nombre des oiseaux de mer sur les cotes des Isles de cet  Bailliage a considerablement diminue depuis plusieurs annees; que les  dits oiseaux sont utiles aux pecheurs, en ce qu'ils indiquent les  parages ou les poissons se trouvent; que les dits oiseaux sont utiles  aux marins en ce qu'ils annoncent pendant la duree des brouillards la  proximite des rochers,\" goes on to enact as follows:--\"Il est defendu de  prendre, enlever ou detruire les ceufs des oiseaux de mer dans toute  I'entendue de la jurisdiction de cette isle, sur la peine d'une amende  qui ne sera pas moindre de sept livres tournois et n'excedera pas trente  livres tournois.\"[3] Sec. 2 enacts, \"Depuis ce jour[4] au 15 Octobre  prochain, il est defendu de tuer, blesser, prendre ou chasser les  oiseaux de mer dans toute l'entendue de la jurisdiction de cette isle.\"  Sec. 3, \"Ceux qui depuis ce jour au 15 Octobre prochain auront ete  trouves en possession d'un oiseau de mer recemment tue, blesse ou pris,  ou qui auront ete trouves en possession de plumage frais appartenant  d'un oiseau de mer seront censes avoir tue, blesse ou pris tel oiseau de  mer sauf e eux de prouver le contraire. Pareillement ceux qui depuis ce  jour au 15 Octobre prochain auront ete trouves en possession d'un oeuf  de l'annee d'un oiseau de mer seront censes avoir pris et enleve le dit  oeuf sauf a eux de prouver le contraire.\" The penalty in each case is  the same as in Section 1. Section 4 contains the list of the oiseaux de  mer which come under the protection of the Act, which is as  follows:--Les Mauves Mouettes, Pingouins, Guillemots, Cormorans,  Barbelotes, Hirondelles de mer, Pies-marants, Petrel, Plongeons, Grebes,  Puffins, Dotterells, Alouettes de mer, Toumpierres, Gannets, Courlis et  Martin pecheur.    As far as the eggs of many of the species actually breeding in the  Islands are concerned, this Act seems to be a dead letter: the only  birds of any size whose eggs are not regularly robbed are the Herring  Gulls and Shags, and they take sufficient care of themselves; were the  Act strictly enforced it would probably be found that there would be--as  would be the case in England--a good deal of opposition to this part of  it, which would greatly interfere with what appears to be a considerable  article of food with many of the population. Probably the only  compromise which would work, and could be rigidly enforced, would be to  fix a later date for the protection of the eggs--say as late as the 15th  June; this would allow those who wanted to rob the eggs for food to take  the earlier layings, and the birds would be able to bring up their  second or third broods in peace; and probably the fishermen and others,  who use the eggs as an article of consumption, would be glad to assist  in carrying out such an Act as this, as they would soon find the birds  increase so much that they would be able to take as many eggs by the  middle of June as they do now in the whole year, especially the  Black-back Gulls and the Puffins, which are the birds mostly  robbed,--the latter of which are certainly decreasing considerably in  numbers in consequence.    This plan is successfully carried out by many private owners of the  large breeding-stations of the Gannets, Eider Duck, and other sea-birds  in the north of England and Scotland. Of course, it must not be supposed  that all the birds mentioned in the Act whose eggs are protected breed  in the Islands, or anywhere within ten or fifteen degrees of latitude of  the Islands; in fact, a great many of them are not there at all during  the breeding-season, except perhaps an occasional wounded bird which has  been unable to join its companions on their migratory journey, or a few  non-breeding stragglers.    It has often struck me that a small but rigidly collected and enforced  gun-tax would be a more efficacious protection--not only to the oiseaux  de mer, but also to the inland birds, many of which are quite as much in  want of protection though not included in the Act--than the Sea-bird  Protection Act is. I am glad to see that there is some chance of this  being carried out, for, while this work was going through the press, I  see by the newspaper ('Gazette Officielle de Guernsey' for the 26th  March, 1879) that the Bailiff had then just issued a _Billet d'Etat_  which contained a \"Projet de loi\" on the subject, to be submitted to the  States at their next meeting; and in concluding its comments on this  _Projet de loi_ the Gazette says, \"Il n'est que juste en fait que ceux  qui veulent se lier au plaisir de la chasse paient pour cette fantaisie  et que par ce moyen le trop grand nombre de nos chasseurs maladroits et  inexperimentes se voit reduit au grand avantage de nos fermiers et de  nos promeneurs;\" and probably also to the advantage of the chasseurs  themselves.    In regard to the nomenclature, I have done the best I can to follow the  rule laid down by the British"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14474"],[0,"The Chemical History of a Candle (#2)"],[1,"first thing to be  done is to put a wick through them. Here is one--a plaited wick, which  does not require snuffing[3]--supported by a little wire. It goes to the  bottom, where it is pegged in--the little peg holding the cotton tight,  and stopping the aperture, so that nothing fluid shall run out. At the  upper part there is a little bar placed across, which stretches the cotton  and holds it in the mould. The tallow is then melted, and the moulds are  filled. After a certain time, when the moulds are cool, the excess of  tallow is poured off at one corner, and then cleaned off altogether, and  the ends of the wick cut away. The candles alone then remain in the mould,  and you have only to upset them, as I am doing, when out they tumble, for  the candles are made in the form of cones, being narrower at the top than  at the bottom; so that what with their form and their own shrinking, they  only need a little shaking, and out they fall. In the same way are made  these candles of stearin and of paraffin. It is a curious thing to see how  wax candles are made. A lot of cottons are hung upon frames, as you see  here, and covered with metal tags at the ends to keep the wax from  covering the cotton in those places. These are carried to a heater, where  the wax is melted. As you see, the frames can turn round; and as they  turn, a man takes a vessel of wax and pours it first down one, and then  the next and the next, and so on. When he has gone once round, if it is  sufficiently cool, he gives the first a second coat, and so on until they  are all of the required thickness. When they have been thus clothed, or  fed, or made up to that thickness, they are taken off, and placed  elsewhere. I have here, by the kindness of Mr. Field, several specimens of  these candles. Here is one only half-finished. They are then taken down,  and well rolled upon a fine stone slab, and the conical top is moulded by  properly shaped tubes, and the bottoms cut off and trimmed. This is done  so beautifully that they can make candles in this way weighing exactly  four, or six, to the pound, or any number they please.    We must not, however, take up more time about the mere manufacture, but go  a little further into the matter. I have not yet referred you to luxuries  in candles (for there is such a thing as luxury in candles). See how  beautifully these are coloured: you see here mauve, magenta, and all the  chemical colours recently introduced, applied to candles. You observe,  also, different forms employed. Here is a fluted pillar most beautifully  shaped; and I have also here some candles sent me by Mr. Pearsall, which  are ornamented with designs upon them, so that as they burn you have as it  were a glowing sun above, and a bouquet of flowers beneath. All, however,  that is fine and beautiful is not useful. These fluted candles, pretty as  they are, are bad candles; they are bad because of their external shape.  Nevertheless, I shew you these specimens sent to me from kind friends on  all sides, that you may see what is done, and what may be done in this or  that direction; although, as I have said, when we come to these  refinements, we are obliged to sacrifice a little in utility.    Now, as to the light of the candle. We will light one or two, and set them  at work in the performance of their proper functions. You observe a candle  is a very different thing from a lamp. With a lamp you take a little oil,  fill your vessel, put in a little moss or some cotton prepared by  artificial means, and then light the top of the wick. When the flame runs  down the cotton to the oil, it gets extinguished, but it goes on burning  in the part above. Now, I have no doubt you will ask, how is it that the  oil, which will not burn of itself, gets up to the top of the cotton,  where it will burn? We shall presently examine that; but there is a much  more wonderful thing about the burning of a candle than this. You have  here a solid substance with no vessel to contain it; and how is it that  this solid substance can get up to the place where the flame is? How is it  that this solid gets there, it not being a fluid? or, when it is made a  fluid, then how is it that it keeps together? This is a wonderful thing  about a candle.    We have here a good deal of wind, which will help us in some of our  illustrations, but tease us in others; for the sake, therefore, of a  little regularity, and to simplify the matter, I shall make a quiet  flame--for who can study a subject when there are difficulties in the way  not belonging to it? Here is a clever invention of some costermonger or  street stander in the market-place for the shading of their candles on  Saturday nights, when they are selling their greens, or potatoes, or fish.  I have very often admired it. They put a lamp-glass round the candle,  supported on a kind of gallery, which clasps it, and it can be slipped up  and down as required. By the use of this lamp-glass, employed in the same  way, you have a steady flame, which you can look at, and carefully  examine, as I hope you will do, at home.    You see, then, in the first instance, that a beautiful cup is formed. As  the air comes to the candle it moves upwards by the force of the current  which the heat of the candle produces, and it so cools all the sides of  the wax, tallow, or fuel, as to keep the edge much cooler than the part  within; the part within melts by the flame that runs down the wick as far  as it can go before it is extinguished, but the part on the outside does  not melt. If I made a current in one direction, my cup would be lop-sided,  and the fluid would consequently run over,--for the same force of gravity  which holds worlds together holds this fluid in a horizontal position, and  if the cup be not horizontal, of course the fluid will run away in  guttering. You see, therefore, that the cup is formed by this beautifully  regular ascending current of air playing upon all sides, which keeps the  exterior of the candle cool. No fuel would serve for a candle which has  not the property of giving this cup, except such fuel as the Irish  bogwood, where the material itself is like a sponge, and holds its own  fuel. You see now why you would have had such a bad result if you were to  burn these beautiful candles that I have shewn you, which are irregular,  intermittent in their shape, and cannot therefore have that nicely-formed  edge to the cup which is the great beauty in a candle. I hope you will now  see that the perfection of a process--that is, its utility--is the better  point of beauty about it. It is not the best looking thing, but the best  acting thing, which is the most advantageous to us. This good-looking  candle is a bad burning one. There will be a guttering round about it  because of the irregularity of the stream of air and the badness of the  cup which is formed thereby. You may see some pretty examples (and I trust  you will notice these instances) of the action of the ascending current  when you have A little gutter run down the side of a candle, making it  thicker there than it is elsewhere. As the candle goes on burning, that  keeps its place and forms a little pillar sticking up by the side,  because, as it rises higher above the rest of the wax or fuel, the air  gets better round it, and it is more cooled and better able to resist the  action of the heat at a little distance. Now, the greatest mistakes and  faults with regard to candles, as in many other things, often bring with  them instruction which we should not receive if they had not occurred. We  come here to be philosophers; and I hope you will always remember that  whenever a result happens, especially if it be new, you should say, \"What  is the cause? Why does it occur?\" and you will in the course of time find  out the reason.    Then, there is another point about these candles which will answer a  question,--that is, as to the way in which this fluid gets out of the cup,  up the wick, and into the place of combustion. You know that the flames on  these burning wicks in candles made of beeswax, stearin, or spermaceti, do  not run down to the wax or other matter, and melt it all away, but keep to  their own right place. They are fenced off from the fluid below, and do  not encroach on the cup at the sides. I cannot imagine a more beautiful  example than the condition of adjustment under which a candle makes one  part subserve to the other to the very end of its action. A combustible  thing like that, burning away gradually, never being intruded upon by the  flame, is a very beautiful sight; especially when you come to learn what a  vigorous thing flame is--what power it has of destroying the wax itself  when it gets hold of it, and of disturbing its proper form if it come only  too near.    But how does the flame get hold of the fuel? There is a beautiful point  about that--_capillary attraction_[4]. \"Capillary attraction!\" you  say,--\"the attraction of hairs.\" Well, never mind the name: it was given  in old times, before we had a good understanding of what the real power  was. It is by what is called capillary attraction that the fuel is  conveyed to the part where combustion goes on, and is deposited there, not  in a careless way, but very beautifully in the very midst of the centre of  action which takes place around it. Now, I am going to give you one or two  instances of capillary attraction. It is that kind of action or attraction  which makes two things that do not dissolve in each other still hold  together. When you wash your hands, you wet them thoroughly; you take a  little soap to make the adhesion better, and you find your hand remains  wet. This is by that kind of attraction of which I am about to speak. And,  what is more, if your hands are not soiled (as they almost always are by  the usages of life), if you put your finger into a little warm water, the  water will creep a little way up the finger, though you may not stop"]]]
