Twice he did this and returned with confidence unshaken.  \"Mark my word,\" he reiterated; \"three days at the outside and we  shall see the French!\"    That was in September, 1914. Those three days passed away into  as many weeks, into as many months, and into almost as many  years. I cannot help wondering whether the same hopes stirred  within him at each fresh outburst of cannonading on the Somme.  And whether through those soul-sickening months that white-  haired man peered daily down those Brussels streets, yearning for  the advent of the Red and Blue Army of Deliverance. Red and  Blue it was ever in his mind. If once it had come in its new uniform  of somber hue, it would have been a disappointing shock I fear.  He was an old man then; he is now perhaps beyond all such  human hurts. His pain was as real as anything I saw in all the war.  I had little time to dwell upon it, however, for presently I was put  into a situation that called for all my wits. I was introduced to it by  the announcement of the porter:    \"An American gentleman to see you, sir.\"    That was joyful news to one held within the confines of a captive  city, from which all exit was, for the time being, closely barred.    It was September 28th, my birthday, too. The necessity of  celebrating this in utter boredom was a dismal prospect. Now this  came upon me like a little surprise-party.    Picking up a bit of paper on which I had been scribbling down a  few memoranda that I feared might escape my mind, I hastened  into the hallway to meet a somewhat spare, tall, and extremely  erect-appearing man. He greeted me with a smile and a bow--a  rather dry smile and a rather stiff bow for an American.    So I queried, \"You're an American, are you?\"    \"Not exactly,\" he responded; \"but I would like to talk with you.\"    Without the shadow of a suspicion, I told him it would be a great  relief from the tedium of the day to talk to any one.    \"But I would prefer to talk to you in your room,\" he added.    \"Certainly,\" I responded, stepping toward the elevator.    The hotel was practically deserted, so I was somewhat surprised  when two men, one a huge fellow built on a superdreadnaught  plan, followed us in and got out with us on the fifth floor. The  superdreadnaught sailed on into my room, which seemed a  breach of propriety for an un-introduced stranger. He closed the  door rudely behind him. I was prepared to resent this altogether  high-handed intrusion, when my tall guest said, very simply, \"I am  representing the Imperial German Government.\"    I rallied under the shock sufficiently to say, \"Will you take a chair?\"    \"No,\" came the laconic reply, \"I will take you--and this,\" he said,  reaching for the piece of scribble-paper I had in my hands, \"and  any baggage you have in your room.\"    I assured him that I had none, as I really expected to stay in  Brussels but a day. He pretended not to hear my reply, and said,    \"We better take it with us, for we will probably need it.\"    He looked under the bed and unlocked the closet door. Finding  nothing, he asked for the key to my room. I handed it over, Room  Number 502.    \"You will be so good as to follow me now.\"    Now every one knows that the Spy-Season in Europe opened with  the beginning of the war. Spy hunting became at once a veritable  mania.    Consequently no self-respecting person returns from the war-zone  without at least one hair-raising story of being taken as a spy.  Being just an average species of American, I exhale no particular  air of mystery or villainy; yet I suffered a score of times the laying  on of hands by German, French, Belgian, and even Dutch authorities.    But this experience is marked off from all my other ordeals in four  ways. In the first place, instead of casually falling into the hands of  my captors, they came after me in full force. In the second place, a  specific charge of using money for bribing information was laid  against me, and witnesses were at hand. In the third place, the  leader of the party arrested me in civilian dress, but before  examination and trial he changed to military uniform. In the fourth  place, the officials were in such a surly mood that my message to  the American Ambassador was undelivered, and at the last trial  before the American representatives there was no apology, but  rather the sullen attitude of those who had been balked in bagging  their game.    When my captor bade me follow him I asked:    \"Can I leave word with my friends?\" For an answer he smiled  satirically. By accident or design, the time chosen for my taking off  was one when both of my two casual acquaintances were out of  the hotel.    \"Not now, but a little later perhaps, when this is fixed up,\" my  captor answered me.    We stepped into a carriage. The two assistants at the little surprise  party walked away, and my rising sense of fear was allayed by the  friendly offer of a cigarette. It was a brand-new experience to ride  away to prison in royal state like this. The almost pleasant attitude  of my companion reassured me. \"After all,\" I mused, \"this is a  lucky stroke; a little uncertain perhaps, but on the whole an  interesting way to while away the tedium of an otherwise eventless  birthday.\"    We stopped before the Belgian Government building, on the Rue  de la Loi, the headquarters of the German staff. At a word the  sentries dropped back and my companion bade me walk down a  long, dark corridor. I opened a door at the end, and found myself in  a room with a few officers in chairs, and a large array of  documents upon a table.    The moment I came within the safe confines of that room the  whole attitude of my captor changed. His mask of friendliness  dropped away. Perhaps his spirit responded and adapted itself to  the official atmosphere of the headquarters. Anyhow, at once he  froze up into the most rigid formality. Sitting down, he wrote out  what I deemed was the report of the morning's proceedings. I  watched him writing with all the semblance and precision of a  machine, except for a half-smile that sometimes flickered upon his  close-pressed lips.    He was a machine, or, more precisely, a cog in the great fighting  machine that was producing death and destruction to Belgium.  Just as the Germans have put men through a certain mold and  turned out the typical German soldier, in like manner through other  molds they have turned out according to pattern the German  secret service man. He is a kind of spy-destroyer performing in his  sphere the same service that the torpedo-boat destroyer does in  its domain. This man was the German reincarnation of Javert, the  police inspector who hung so relentlessly upon the flanks of Jean  Valjean. In his stolid silence I read an iron determination to \"get\"  me, and in that flickering smile I saw an inhuman delight in putting  the worst construction upon my case as he wrote it down.  Hereafter he shall be known as Javert.    Towards Javert I sustain a very distinct aversion. This is not the  result of any evil twist put into my constitution by original sin. Quite  the contrary. Hitherto I have always felt that I, like the man in  Oscar Wilde's play, could forgive anybody anything, any time,  anywhere. One can forgive even a hangman for doing his duty,  however it may thwart one's plans. Some men must play the part  of prosecutor and devil's advocate.    But such was the cold, cynical delight in this fellow's doing his duty,  such was his arrogant, overbearing attitude toward the helpless  peasant prisoners, that I know my prayers for the end of the war  were not motivated entirely by selfless considerations. I am  hankering to get into the neighborhood of this fellow when he  doesn't hold all the trump cards. In justice to Javert, I must say that  he reciprocated my feeling magnificently, and, inasmuch as he  was the cat and I the mouse, and a very small one at that, he  probably found much more spiritual satisfaction in the exercise of  his feelings than I did in mine. That is why I was anxious to have  the war end and embrace the first opportunity to change our roles.  I yearned to give him his proper place in the sun.    Having completed my case, he demanded my papers, and then  bade me open the door. There was a soldier waiting, and with him  ahead and Javert behind, I was escorted into the courtyard. Here  a double-door was opened, and I was thrust into a room filled with  a motley collection of persons guarded by a dozen soldiers with  rifles ready.    The sight was anything but reassuring. I turned toward Javert and  asked, somewhat frantically, I fear: \"What is all this for? Aren't you  going to do anything about my case?\"    My hitherto cool, smiling manner must have been an irritation to  him. A German official, especially a petty one, takes everything  with such deadly seriousness that he can't understand us taking  things so debonairly, especially when it is his own magisterial self.    So I think he thoroughly enjoyed my first signs of perturbation, and  said: \"Your case will be settled in a little while--perhaps directly.\"  He turned to a soldier, bade him watch me, and disappeared.    About five minutes later I heard outside the command \"Halt!\" to a  squad of soldiers. The doors opened and Javert reappeared, this  time in the full uniform of an officer. For the moment I thought he  had come with a firing squad and they were going to make short  shrift of me. The grim humor of disposing of my case thus  \"directly\" came home to me. But merely flicking the ashes from his  cigarette, he glanced round the room without offering the slightest  recognition, and then disappeared. How he made his change from  civilian clothes so quickly I can't understand. It seemed like a  vainglorious display of his uniform in order to let us take full"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11431"],[0,"Character Sketches of Romance, Fiction and the Drama, Vol. 1 (#2)"],[1,"ime, Richard I.).    ABDALS or _Santons_, a class of religionists who pretend to be  inspired with the most ravishing raptures of divine love. Regarded  with great veneration by the vulgar.--_Olearius_, i. 971.    AB'DIEL, the faithful seraph who withstood Satan when he urged those  under him to revolt.      ... the seraph Abdiel, faithful found;    Among the faithless faithful only he;    Among innumerable false, unmoved.    Unshaken, unseduced, unterrified,    His loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal.    Milton, _Paradise Lost_, v. 896, etc. (1665).    ABELARD and ELOISE, unhappy lovers, whose illicit love was succeeded  by years of penitence and remorse. Abelard was the tutor of Heloise  (or Eloise), and, although vowed to the church, won and returned her  passion. They were violently separated by her uncle. Abelard entered a  monastery and Eloise became a nun. Their love survived the passage of  years, and they were buried together at _Pere la Chaise.--Eloise and  Abelard_. By Alexander Pope (1688-1744).    ABENSBERG (_Count_), the father of thirty-two children. When Heinrich  II. made his progress through Germany, and other courtiers presented  their offerings, the count brought forward his thirty-two children,  \"as the most valuable offering he could make to his king and country.\"    ABES'SA, the impersonation of abbeys and convents in Spenser's _Faery  Queen_, i. 3. She is the paramour of Kirkrapine, who used to rob  churches and poor-boxes, and bring his plunder to Abessa, daughter of  Corceca (_Blindness of Heart_).    ABIGAIL, typical name of a maid.--See Beaumont and Fletcher, Swift,  Fielding, and many modern writers.    ABNEY, called _Young Abney_, the friend of colonel Albert Lee, a  royalist.--Sir W. Scott, _Woodstock_ (time, the Commonwealth).    ABON HASSAN, a young merchant of Bag dad, and hero of the tale called  \"The Sleeper Awakened,\" in the _Arabian Nights' Entertainments_.  While Abon Hassan is asleep he is conveyed to the palace of  Haroun-al-Raschid, and the attendants are ordered to do everything  they can to make him fancy himself the caliph. He subsequently becomes  the caliph's chief favorite.    Shakespeare, in the induction of _Taming of the Shrew_, befouls  \"Christopher Sly\" in a similar way, but Sly thinks it was \"nothing but  a dream.\"    Philippe _le Bon_, duke of Burgundy, on his marriage with Eleonora,  tried the same trick.--Burton, _Anatomy of Melancholy_, ii. 2,4.    ABOU BEN ADHEM, \"awakening one night from a deep dream of peace,\" sees  an angel writing the names of those who love the Lord. Ben Adhem's  name is registered as \"one who loves his fellow-men.\" A second vision  shows his name at the head of the list.    _Abou Ben Adhem_. By Leigh Hunt (1784-1859).      ABRA, the most beloved of Solomon's concubines.    Fruits their odor lost and meats their taste,    If gentle Abra had not decked the feast;    Dishonored did the sparkling goblet stand,    Unless received from gentle Abra's hand; ...    Nor could my soul approve the music's tone    Till all was hushed, and Abra sang alone.    M. Prior, _Solomon_ (1664-1721).    AB'RADAS, the great Macedonian pirate.    Abradas, the great Macedonian pirate, thought every one had a letter  of mart that bare sayles in the ocean.--Greene, _Penelope's Web_  (1601).

AB'SALOM, in Dryden's _Absalom and Achitophel_, is meant for the duke  of Monmouth, natural son of Charles II. _(David)_. Like Absalom, the  duke was handsome; like Absalom, he was beloved and rebellious; and  like Absalom, his rebellion ended in his death (1649-1685).    AB'SOLON, a priggish parish clerk in Chaucer's _Canterbury Tales_. His  hair was curled, his shoes slashed, his hose red. He could let blood,  cut hair, and shave, could dance, and play either on the ribible or  the gittern. This gay spark paid his addresses to Mistress Alison,  the young wife of John, a rich but aged carpenter: but Alison herself  loved a poor scholar named Nicholas, a lodger in the house.--_The  Miller's Tale_ (1388).    ABSOLUTE _(Sir Anthony)_, a testy but warm-hearted old gentleman, who  imagines that he possesses a most angelic temper, and when he quarrels  with his son, the captain, fancies it is the son who is out of temper,  and not himself. Smollett's \"Matthew Bramble\" evidently suggested this  character. William Dowton (1764-1851) was the best actor of this part.    _Captain Absolute_, son of sir Anthony, in love with Lydia Languish,  the heiress, to whom he is known only as ensign Beverley. Bob Acres,  his neighbor, is his rival, and sends a challenge to the unknown  ensign; but when he finds that ensign Beverley is captain Absolute,  he declines to fight, and resigns all further claim to the lady's  hand.--Sheridan, _The Rivals_ (1775).    ABSYRTUS, brother of Medea and companion of her flight from Colchis.  To elude or delay her pursuers, she cut him into pieces and strewed  the fragments in the road, that her father might be detained by  gathering up the remains of his son.    _Abu'dah_, in the drama called _The Siege of Damascus_, by John Hughes  (1720), is the next in command to Caled in the Arabian army set down  before Damascus. Though undoubtedly brave, he prefers peace to war;  and when, at the death of Caled, he succeeds to the chief command, he  makes peace with the Syrians on honorable terms.    ABU'DAH, in the _Tales of the Genii_, by H. Ridley, is a wealthy  merchant of Bag dad, who goes in quest of the talisman of Oroma'nes,  which he is driven to seek by a little old hag, who haunts him every  night and makes his life wretched. He finds at last that the talisman  which is to free him of this hag [_conscience_] is to \"fear God and  keep his commandments.\"    ACADE'MUS, an Attic hero, whose garden was selected by Plato for the  place of his lectures. Hence his disciples were called the \"Academic  sect.\"    The green retreats of Academus. Akenside, _Pleasures of Imagination_,  i (1721-1770).    ACAS'TO (_Lord_), father of Seri'no, Casta'lio, and Polydore; and  guardian of Monimia \"the orphan.\" He lived to see the death of his  sons and his ward. Polydore ran on his brother's sword, Castalio  stabbed himself, and Monimia took poison.--Otway, _The Orphan_ (1680).    ACES'TES (3 _syl_.). In a trial of skill, Acestes, the Sicilian,  discharged his arrow with such force that it took fire from the  friction of the air.--_The AEneid_, Bk. V.      Like Acestes' shaft of old,    The swift thought kindles as it flies.    Longfellow, _To a Child_.    ACHATES [_A-ka'-teze_], called by Virgil \"fidus Achates.\" The name has  become a synonym for a bosom friend, a crony, but is generally used  laughingly.--_The AEneid_.      He, like Achates, faithful to the tomb.    Byron, _Don Juan_, i. 159.    ACHER'IA, the fox, went partnership with a bear in a bowl of: milk.  Before the bear arrived, the fox skimmed off the cream and drank the  milk; then, filling the bowl with mud, replaced the cream atop. Says  the fox, \"Here is the bowl; one shall have the cream, and the other  all the rest: choose, friend, which you like.\" The bear told the fox  to take the cream, and thus bruin had only the mud.--_A Basque Tale_.    A similar tale occurs in Campbell's _Popular Tales of the West  Highlands_ (iii. 98), called \"The Keg of Butter.\" The wolf chooses the  _bottom_ when \"oats\" were the object of choice, and the _top_ when  \"potatoes\" were the sowing.    Rabelais tells the same tale about a farmer and the devil. Each was  to have on alternate years what grew _under_ and _over_ the soil. The  farmer sowed turnips and carrots when the _under_-soil produce came  to his lot, and barley or wheat when his turn was the _over_-soil  produce.

ACHIT'OPHEL, \"Him who drew Achitophel,\" Dryden, author of the famous  political satire of _Absalom and Achitophel_. \"David\" is Charles II.;  his rebellious son \"Absalom\" is the king's natural son, the handsome  but rebellious James duke of Monmouth; and \"Achitophel,\" the  traitorous counsellor, is the earl of Shaftesbury, \"for close designs  and crooked counsels fit.\"      Can sneer at him who drew Achitophel.    Byron, _Don Juan_, iii. 100.    There is a portrait of the first earl of Shaftesbury (Dryden's  \"Achitophel\") as lord chancellor of England, clad in ash-colored  robes, because he had never been called to the bar.--E. Yates,  _Celebrities_, xviii.    A'CIS, a Sicilian shepherd, loved by the nymph Galate'a. The monster  Polypheme (3 _syl_.), a Cyclops, was his rival, and crushed him under  a huge rock. The blood of Acis was changed into a river of the same  name at the foot of mount Etna.    Not such a pipe, good reader, as that which Acis did sweetly tune in  praise of his Galatea, but one of true Delft manufacture.--W. Irving  (1783-1859).
