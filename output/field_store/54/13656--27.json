[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13893"],[0,"Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents: William McKinley; (#2)"],[1,"by negotiations between the Spanish commander, Martinez de  Campos, and the insurgent leaders.    The present insurrection broke out in February, 1895. It is not  my purpose at this time to recall its remarkable increase or to  characterize its tenacious resistance against the enormous forces massed  against it by Spain. The revolt and the efforts to subdue it carried  destruction to every quarter of the island, developing wide proportions  and defying the efforts of Spain for its suppression. The civilized code  of war has been disregarded, no less so by the Spaniards than by the  Cubans.    The existing conditions can not but fill this Government and the  American people with the gravest apprehension. There is no desire on the  part of our people to profit by the misfortunes of Spain. We have only  the desire to see the Cubans prosperous and contented, enjoying that  measure of self-control which is the inalienable right of man, protected  in their right to reap the benefit of the exhaustless treasures of their  country.    The offer made by my predecessor in April, 1896, tendering the friendly  offices of this Government, failed. Any mediation on our part was not  accepted. In brief, the answer read: \"There is no effectual way to  pacify Cuba unless it begins with the actual submission of the rebels  to the mother country.\" Then only could Spain act in the promised  direction, of her own motion and after her own plans.    The cruel policy of concentration was initiated February 16, 1896. The  productive districts controlled by the Spanish armies were depopulated.  The agricultural inhabitants were herded in and about the garrison  towns, their lands laid waste and their dwellings destroyed. This policy  the late cabinet of Spain justified as a necessary measure of war and as  a means of cutting off supplies from the insurgents. It has utterly  failed as a war measure. It was not civilized warfare. It was  extermination.    Against this abuse of the rights of war I have felt constrained on  repeated occasions to enter the firm and earnest protest of this  Government. There was much of public condemnation of the treatment of  American citizens by alleged illegal arrests and long imprisonment  awaiting trial or pending protracted judicial proceedings. I felt it my  first duty to make instant demand for the release or speedy trial of all  American citizens under arrest. Before the change of the Spanish cabinet  in October last twenty-two prisoners, citizens of the United States, had  been given their freedom.    For the relief of our own citizens suffering because of the conflict  the aid of Congress was sought in a special message,[1] and under  the appropriation of May 24, 1897,[2] effective aid has been given to  American citizens in Cuba, many of them at their own request having been  returned to the United States.    The instructions given to our new minister to Spain before his departure  for his post directed him to impress upon that Government the sincere  wish of the United States to lend its aid toward the ending of the war  in Cuba by reaching a peaceful and lasting result, just and honorable  alike to Spain and to the Cuban people. These instructions recited the  character and duration of the contest, the widespread losses it entails,  the burdens and restraints it imposes upon us, with constant disturbance  of national interests, and the injury resulting from an indefinite  continuance of this state of things. It was stated that at this juncture  our Government was constrained to seriously inquire if the time was not  ripe when Spain of her own volition, moved by her own interests and  every sentiment of humanity, should put a stop to this destructive war  and make proposals of settlement honorable to herself and just to her  Cuban colony. It was urged that as a neighboring nation, with large  interests in Cuba, we could be required to wait only a reasonable time  for the mother country to establish its authority and restore peace and  order within the borders of the island; that we could not contemplate an  indefinite period for the accomplishment of this result.    No solution was proposed to which the slightest idea of humiliation to  Spain could attach, and, indeed, precise proposals were withheld to  avoid embarrassment to that Government. All that was asked or expected  was that some safe way might be speedily provided and permanent peace  restored. It so chanced that the consideration of this offer, addressed  to the same Spanish administration which had declined the tenders of  my predecessor, and which for more than two years had poured men and  treasure into Cuba in the fruitless effort to suppress the revolt, fell  to others. Between the departure of General Woodford, the new envoy,  and his arrival in Spain the statesman who had shaped the policy of his  country fell by the hand of an assassin, and although the cabinet of the  late premier still held office and received from our envoy the proposals  he bore, that cabinet gave place within a few days thereafter to a new  administration, under the leadership of Sagasta.    The reply to our note was received on the 23d day of October. It is in  the direction of a better understanding. It appreciates the friendly  purposes of this Government. It admits that our country is deeply  affected by the war in Cuba and that its desires for peace are just.  It declares that the present Spanish government is bound by every  consideration to a change of policy that should satisfy the United  States and pacify Cuba within a reasonable time. To this end Spain has  decided to put into effect the political reforms heretofore advocated by  the present premier, without halting for any consideration in the path  which in its judgment leads to peace. The military operations, it is  said, will continue, but will be humane and conducted with all regard  for private rights, being accompanied by political action leading to  the autonomy of Cuba while guarding Spanish sovereignty. This, it is  claimed, will result in investing Cuba with a distinct personality, the  island to be governed by an executive and by a local council or chamber,  reserving to Spain the control of the foreign relations, the army and  navy, and the judicial administration. To accomplish this the present  government proposes to modify existing legislation by decree, leaving  the Spanish Cortes, with the aid of Cuban senators and deputies, to  solve the economic problem and properly distribute the existing debt.    In the absence of a declaration of the measures that this Government  proposes to take in carrying out its proffer of good offices, it  suggests that Spain be left free to conduct military operations and  grant political reforms, while the United States for its part shall  enforce its neutral obligations and cut off the assistance which it is  asserted the insurgents receive from this country. The supposition of an  indefinite prolongation of the war is denied. It is asserted that the  western provinces are already well-nigh reclaimed, that the planting of  cane and tobacco therein has been resumed, and that by force of arms and  new and ample reforms very early and complete pacification is hoped for.    The immediate amelioration of existing conditions under the new  administration of Cuban affairs is predicted, and therewithal the  disturbance and all occasion for any change of attitude on the part  of the United States. Discussion of the question of the international  duties and responsibilities of the United States as Spain understands  them is presented, with an apparent disposition to charge us with  failure in this regard. This charge is without any basis in fact. It  could not have been made if Spain had been cognizant of the constant  efforts this Government has made, at the cost of millions and by the  employment of the administrative machinery of the nation at command,  to perform its full duty according to the law of nations. That it has  successfully prevented the departure of a single military expedition or  armed vessel from our shores in violation of our laws would seem to be  a sufficient answer. But of this aspect of the Spanish note it is not  necessary to speak further now. Firm in the conviction of a wholly  performed obligation, due response to this charge has been made in  diplomatic course.    Throughout all these horrors and dangers to our own peace this  Government has never in any way abrogated its sovereign prerogative of  reserving to itself the determination of its policy and course according  to its own high sense of right and in consonance with the dearest  interests and convictions of our own people should the prolongation of  the strife so demand.    Of the untried measures there remain only: Recognition of the insurgents  as belligerents; recognition of the independence of Cuba; neutral  intervention to end the war by imposing a rational compromise between  the contestants, and intervention in favor of one or the other party.  I speak not of forcible annexation, for that can not be thought of.  That, by our code of morality, would be criminal aggression.    Recognition of the belligerency of the Cuban insurgents has often  been canvassed as a possible, if not inevitable, step both in regard  to the previous ten years struggle and during the present war. I am  not unmindful that the two Houses of Congress in the spring of 1896  expressed the opinion by concurrent resolution that a condition of  public war existed requiring or justifying the recognition of a state  of belligerency in Cuba, and during the extra session the Senate voted  a joint resolution of like import, which, however, was not brought  to a vote in the House of Representatives. In the presence of these  significant expressions of the sentiment of the legislative branch it  behooves the Executive to soberly consider the conditions under which  so important a measure must"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/139"],[0,"The Lost World (#2)"],[1,"yourself, because it's natural to you, because the man  in you is crying out for heroic expression.  Now, when you described  the Wigan coal explosion last month, could you not have gone down and  helped those people, in spite of the choke-damp?\"    \"I did.\"    \"You never said so.\"    \"There was nothing worth bucking about.\"    \"I didn't know.\"  She looked at me with rather more interest.  \"That  was brave of you.\"    \"I had to.  If you want to write good copy, you must be where the  things are.\"    \"What a prosaic motive!  It seems to take all the romance out of it.  But, still, whatever your motive, I am glad that you went down that  mine.\"  She gave me her hand; but with such sweetness and dignity that  I could only stoop and kiss it.  \"I dare say I am merely a foolish  woman with a young girl's fancies.  And yet it is so real with me, so  entirely part of my very self, that I cannot help acting upon it.  If I  marry, I do want to marry a famous man!\"    \"Why should you not?\" I cried.  \"It is women like you who brace men up.  Give me a chance, and see if I will take it!  Besides, as you say, men  ought to MAKE their own chances, and not wait until they are given.  Look at Clive--just a clerk, and he conquered India!  By George!  I'll  do something in the world yet!\"    She laughed at my sudden Irish effervescence.  \"Why not?\" she said.  \"You have everything a man could have,--youth, health, strength,  education, energy.  I was sorry you spoke.  And now I am glad--so  glad--if it wakens these thoughts in you!\"    \"And if I do----\"    Her dear hand rested like warm velvet upon my lips.  \"Not another word,  Sir!  You should have been at the office for evening duty half an hour  ago; only I hadn't the heart to remind you.  Some day, perhaps, when  you have won your place in the world, we shall talk it over again.\"    And so it was that I found myself that foggy November evening pursuing  the Camberwell tram with my heart glowing within me, and with the eager  determination that not another day should elapse before I should find  some deed which was worthy of my lady.  But who--who in all this wide  world could ever have imagined the incredible shape which that deed was  to take, or the strange steps by which I was led to the doing of it?    And, after all, this opening chapter will seem to the reader to have  nothing to do with my narrative; and yet there would have been no  narrative without it, for it is only when a man goes out into the world  with the thought that there are heroisms all round him, and with the  desire all alive in his heart to follow any which may come within sight  of him, that he breaks away as I did from the life he knows, and  ventures forth into the wonderful mystic twilight land where lie the  great adventures and the great rewards.  Behold me, then, at the office  of the Daily Gazette, on the staff of which I was a most insignificant  unit, with the settled determination that very night, if possible, to  find the quest which should be worthy of my Gladys!  Was it hardness,  was it selfishness, that she should ask me to risk my life for her own  glorification?  Such thoughts may come to middle age; but never to  ardent three-and-twenty in the fever of his first love.                                      CHAPTER II                \"Try Your Luck with Professor Challenger\"    I always liked McArdle, the crabbed, old, round-backed, red-headed news  editor, and I rather hoped that he liked me.  Of course, Beaumont was  the real boss; but he lived in the rarefied atmosphere of some Olympian  height from which he could distinguish nothing smaller than an  international crisis or a split in the Cabinet.  Sometimes we saw him  passing in lonely majesty to his inner sanctum, with his eyes staring  vaguely and his mind hovering over the Balkans or the Persian Gulf.  He  was above and beyond us.  But McArdle was his first lieutenant, and it  was he that we knew.  The old man nodded as I entered the room, and he  pushed his spectacles far up on his bald forehead.    \"Well, Mr. Malone, from all I hear, you seem to be doing very well,\"  said he in his kindly Scotch accent.    I thanked him.    \"The colliery explosion was excellent.  So was the Southwark fire.  You  have the true descreeptive touch.  What did you want to see me about?\"    \"To ask a favor.\"    He looked alarmed, and his eyes shunned mine. \"Tut, tut!  What is it?\"    \"Do you think, Sir, that you could possibly send me on some mission for  the paper?  I would do my best to put it through and get you some good  copy.\"    \"What sort of meesion had you in your mind, Mr. Malone?\"    \"Well, Sir, anything that had adventure and danger in it.  I really  would do my very best.  The more difficult it was, the better it would  suit me.\"    \"You seem very anxious to lose your life.\"    \"To justify my life, Sir.\"    \"Dear me, Mr. Malone, this is very--very exalted.  I'm afraid the day  for this sort of thing is rather past.  The expense of the 'special  meesion' business hardly justifies the result, and, of course, in any  case it would only be an experienced man with a name that would command  public confidence who would get such an order.  The big blank spaces in  the map are all being filled in, and there's no room for romance  anywhere.  Wait a bit, though!\" he added, with a sudden smile upon his  face.  \"Talking of the blank spaces of the map gives me an idea.  What  about exposing a fraud--a modern Munchausen--and making him  rideeculous?  You could show him up as the liar that he is!  Eh, man,  it would be fine.  How does it appeal to you?\"    \"Anything--anywhere--I care nothing.\"    McArdle was plunged in thought for some minutes.    \"I wonder whether you could get on friendly--or at least on talking  terms with the fellow,\" he said, at last.  \"You seem to have a sort of  genius for establishing relations with people--seempathy, I suppose, or  animal magnetism, or youthful vitality, or something.  I am conscious  of it myself.\"    \"You are very good, sir.\"    \"So why should you not try your luck with Professor Challenger, of  Enmore Park?\"    I dare say I looked a little startled.    \"Challenger!\" I cried.  \"Professor Challenger, the famous zoologist!  Wasn't he the man who broke the skull of Blundell, of the Telegraph?\"    The news editor smiled grimly.    \"Do you mind?  Didn't you say it was adventures you were after?\"    \"It is all in the way of business, sir,\" I answered.    \"Exactly.  I don't suppose he can always be so violent as that.  I'm  thinking that Blundell got him at the wrong moment, maybe, or in the  wrong fashion.  You may have better luck, or more tact in handling him.  There's something in your line there, I am sure, and the Gazette should  work it.\"    \"I really know nothing about him,\" said I.  \"I only remember his name  in connection with the police-court proceedings, for striking Blundell.\"    \"I have a few notes for your guidance, Mr. Malone.  I've had my eye on  the Professor for some little time.\"  He took a paper from a drawer.  \"Here is a summary of his record.  I give it you briefly:--    \"'Challenger, George Edward.  Born: Largs, N. B., 1863.  Educ.: Largs  Academy; Edinburgh University.  British Museum Assistant, 1892.  Assistant-Keeper of Comparative Anthropology Department, 1893.  Resigned after acrimonious correspondence same year.  Winner of  Crayston Medal for Zoological Research.  Foreign Member of'--well,  quite a lot of things, about two inches of small type--'Societe Belge,  American Academy of Sciences, La Plata, etc., etc.  Ex-President  Palaeontological Society.  Section H, British Association'--so on, so  on!--'Publications: \"Some Observations Upon a Series of Kalmuck  Skulls\"; \"Outlines of Vertebrate Evolution\"; and numerous papers,  including \"The underlying fallacy of Weissmannism,\" which caused heated  discussion at the Zoological Congress of Vienna.  Recreations: Walking,  Alpine climbing.  Address: Enmore Park, Kensington, W.'    \"There, take it with you.  I've nothing more for you to-night.\"    I pocketed the slip of paper.    \"One moment, sir,\" I said, as I realized that it was a pink bald head,  and not a red face, which was fronting me.  \"I am not very clear yet  why I am to interview this gentleman.  What has he done?\"    The face flashed back again.    \"Went to South America on a solitary expedeetion two years ago.  Came  back last year.  Had undoubtedly been to South America, but refused to  say exactly where.  Began to tell his adventures in a vague way, but  somebody started to pick holes, and he just shut up like an oyster.  Something wonderful happened--or the man's a champion liar, which is  the more probable supposeetion.  Had some damaged photographs, said to  be fakes.  Got so touchy that he assaults anyone who asks questions,  and heaves reporters down the stairs.  In my opinion he's just a  homicidal megalomaniac with a turn for science.  That's your man, Mr.  Malone.  Now, off you run, and see what you can make of him.  You're  big enough to look after yourself.  Anyway, you are all safe.  Employers' Liability Act, you know.\"    A grinning red face turned once more into a pink oval, fringed with  gingery fluff; the interview was at an end.    I walked across to the Savage Club, but instead of turning into it I  leaned upon the railings of Adelphi Terrace and gazed thoughtfully for  a long time at the brown, oily river.  I can always think most sanely  and clearly in the open air.  I took out the list of Professor  Challenger's exploits, and I read it over under the electric lamp.  Then I had what I can only regard as an inspiration.  As a Pressman, I  felt sure from what I had been told that I could never hope to get into  touch with this cantankerous Professor.  But these recriminations,  twice mentioned in his skeleton biography, could only mean that he was  a fanatic in science.  Was there not an exposed margin there upon which  he might be accessible?  I would try.    "]]]
