In this frame, for the human brain only, there is an additional  hardware facility: to make and operate symbolic models.      FUNDAMENTAL TERMS (KEYWORDS)    Image model (or analogic model), symbolic model, simulation on model,  information, truth, reality, input reality (IR), external reality, image,  harmony, logic, general communications language (GCL), logical and  mathematical language.      DEFINITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BASIC TERMS    This theory is a symbolic model. Any symbolic model has a limited number of  fundamental terms. For these terms and only for them, there are accepted  descriptive definitions. A descriptive definition is, usually, not precise  enough for a scientific approach. This lack of precision is due to the fact  that it uses terms which must be defined before. The terms used in the  definition must also be defined using already defined words. This process  seems to be endless.    In any positive science, the descriptive definitions are accepted only for a  very limited number of terms. These are called \"fundamental terms\".    For instance, in the symbolic model of Newton's Mechanics, the fundamental  terms are mass, space and time. None of these terms have a normal definition  (i.e. generated by the model). They have only descriptive definitions.    Once the fundamental terms are introduced by description, all the other terms  have normal definitions, which are generated by the symbolic model, by logical  and mathematical operations.    Let's see the definitions of the terms used by the MDT theory.    Model: this is a term used on large scale in science and technology.  The MDT  theory accepts the definition used there.    A model means some fundamental elements and some fundamental relations between  the elements.    The elements could be of any type (physical objects, the representation of any  object in any form, including pictures of any type or images of any type or  mathematical symbols of any type and so on). In fact, an element could be  associated with anything which can be considered as an entity. The elements  have some properties, which must be specified somehow. There are a number of  relations between the elements, which must also be specified.    An image model (or analogic model) contains an unspecified number of elements  and an unspecified number of relations between the elements. An image model is  just given as it is. It is not possible to specify in explicit and precise  ways which are the elements and which are the relations.    Examples of image models: maps, models of an object of any type, an assembly  of such models including any material elements (water, air and so on), any  representation in any form of such elements.    A symbolic model uses as elements letters, numbers or words. The relations are  of logical or mathematical type.    The most important symbolic model is the General Communications Language  (GCL). The elements are usually nouns and the relations are usually verbs.    Warning: GCL is not really a symbolic model. The GCL just contains all the  elements and all the relations. When a symbolic model is made (a sentence, for  instance), elements and relations from GCL are used. Thus, because there is no  available word, I decided to consider, by extension, the GCL as a symbolic  model. In this frame, GCL has to be considered as \"symbolic model\".    Once a model given, it is possible to simulate some situations on it. For  simulation, a change must be made to the model. After that, the entire model  will be changed because all the elements have some relations between them.    Any implicit or explicit information which is generated by simulation by a  model, is called \"truth\". Any truth must be associated with the model, which  generated it. This is the definition of the term \"truth\" in the MDT theory.    All the information, which is or could be generated by a model by simulation,  is called \"reality\" associated to that model. This is the definition of the  term \"reality\" in the MDT theory. We also see here that before declaring the  reality, one needs to declare the model which generated it.    We already used the term \"information\". This term is a fundamental term. It  has no normal definition. MDT accepts the descriptive definition from common  life and from science. The same situation is for the term \"entity\".    Warning: in connection with the term \"information\", something is considered as  information after that \"something\" is processed somehow by a device which  takes and processes that \"something\".    This somehow confuse situation is normal for any fundamental term. Just think,  for instance, how one can explain what is \"time\". The only possibility to  explain what is \"time\" is to use examples that already use the term \"time\". In  fact it is impossible to define terms as \"mass\", \"time\", \"space\",  \"information\" or \"entity\".    Let's introduce two new terms: \"harmony\" and \"logic\".    Once a model is given, it is possible to make simulations on the model, as it  has already been explained. By simulation, it is necessary to change an  element or a relation. The model goes into a temporary unstable situation  because all the elements are connected between them.  The model will evolve to  a new stable situation. For an image model, the evolution to stability is  based on harmony laws. For a symbolic model, the evolution to stability is  based on logic. Thus, a stable model is a harmonic or logic model and, after a  perturbation, the model will regain the stability based on the laws of harmony  (image models) or logic (symbolic models). The evolution of any model toward  stability (to become harmonic or logic) is also a basic hardware facility of  the brain.    Because some situations from external reality can be associated, sometimes,  with both types of models, there can be a corespondence between harmony and  logic.    Thus, the implicit definitions of the terms \"harmony\" and \"logic\" are  associated with the methods to regain the stability of an image model  (harmony) or symbolic model (logic). An \"implicit definition\" means that we  are able to recognize the effect of harmony or logic in an informational  structure.    We are now in the situation to present the basic hardware function of any  brain, based on the terms, which have already been defined.    The basic hardware function of any brain (human or animal) is to make models  associated to external reality and to predict, by simulation, the possible  evolutions of the model. Because the model is associated with external  reality, it is possible to predict by simulation some probable evolutions of  the external reality.    We already used the term \"external reality\" which is not defined yet. This  fundamental term is considered as a source of information, which is not  localized in the structure of models of the brain. I want to emphasize that  the external reality is not a source of information, but is just considered so  by any brain.    Thus, one of the main hardware functions of the brain is to make models of the  external reality and to predict, by simulation on the model, the possible  evolution of the associated external reality.    We already defined the reality as all the information which is or could be  generated by a model. This means that we understand the external reality by  the reality, which is generated by a model, which is associated with the  external reality.    Example: For a given external reality, any person makes an associated model.  Any person has his/her own model associated to the same external reality. We  think and act based on our own reality and not based directly on the external  reality.    In fact, external reality is rather an invention of the brain to explain its  structure of models.        THE BASIC HARDWARE ELEMENT    Let's see what is the basic hardware element of a brain (human or animal).  There are some image-type models called M-models, which are associated with  the sense organs (eyes, ears and so on). M-models work in association with  some YM-models, which already exist in the brain. YM-models are concept  models. A concept-model is a simplified model which, in this way, fits a large  class of similar models.    Example of YM models: \"dog\", \"table\" and so on.    M-models have to discover as many as possible entities in the external reality  and to associate a YM model to any entity. Once an entity was firstly  associated with a YM, M-models will predict its evolution based also on that  YM.    Example: if an entity was associated with a YM-dog, the M-model is able to  predict how this YM performs in connection with all the other YMs of it.    Any prediction of M with that YM included is compared with the information  obtained by M from external reality. The information obtained by a M-model  from outside during the comparison process, is called \"input reality\" (IR).    We just introduced a new term as \"input reality\" or IR. IR is the information  obtained by an M-model from outside (from external reality or from other  models) to improve its predictions.    If the prediction meets IR, then M will try another prediction to improve its  quality. If one or more predictions do not meet IR, then M will replace that  YR with another, and the process will continue. This process will continue so  that all the entities which are discovered by M-models will be associated with  some YMs and all the predictions of M must confirm the M-model, unchanged.  Such a model is, thus, a stable model. When M is stable, all YMs are  integrated in M in a harmonic way.    The main function of M-models is to make a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14591"],[0,"Faust [part 1]. Translated Into English in the Original Metres (#2)"],[1,"retained. That very much of the  rhythmical character may be retained in English, was long ago shown by  Mr. Carlyle,[F] in the passages which he translated, both literally and  rhythmically, from the _Helena_ (Part Second). In fact, we have so many  instances of the possibility of reciprocally transferring the finest  qualities of English and German poetry, that there is no sufficient  excuse for an unmetrical translation of _Faust_. I refer especially to  such subtile and melodious lyrics as \"The Castle by the Sea,\" of Uhland,  and the \"Silent Land\" of Salis, translated by Mr. Longfellow; Goethe's  \"Minstrel\" and \"Coptic Song,\" by Dr. Hedge; Heine's \"Two Grenadiers,\" by  Dr. Furness and many of Heine's songs by Mr Leland; and also to the  German translations of English lyrics, by Freiligrath and Strodtmann.[G]      [D] Life of Goethe (Book VI.).    [E] Mr. Lewes gives the following advice: \"The English reader would  perhaps best succeed who should first read Dr. Anster's brilliant  paraphrase, and then carefully go through Hayward's prose translation.\"  This is singularly at variance with the view he has just expressed. Dr.  Anster's version is an almost incredible dilution of the original,  written in _other_ metres; while Hayward's entirely omits the element of  poetry.    [F] Foreign Review, 1828.    [G] When Freiligrath can thus give us Walter Scott:--    \"Kommt, wie der Wind kommt, Wenn Waelder erzittern Kommt, wie die  Brandung Wenn Flotten zersplittern! Schnell heran, schnell herab,  Schneller kommt Al'e!--Haeuptling und Bub' und Knapp, Herr und Vasalle!\"    or Strodtmann thus reproduce Tennyson:--    \"Es faellt der Strahl auf Burg und Thal, Und schneeige Gipfel, reich an  Sagen; Viel' Lichter wehn auf blauen Seen, Bergab die Wasserstuerze  jagen! Blas, Huefthorn, blas, in Wiederhall erschallend: Blas,  Horn--antwortet, Echos, hallend, hallend, hallend!\"    --it must be a dull ear which would be satisfied with the omission of  rhythm and rhyme.    I have a more serious objection, however, to urge against Mr. Hayward's  prose translation. Where all the restraints of verse are flung aside, we  should expect, at least, as accurate a reproduction of the sense,  spirit, and tone of the original, as the genius of our language will  permit. So far from having given us such a reproduction, Mr. Hayward not  only occasionally mistakes the exact meaning of the German text,[H] but,  wherever two phrases may be used to express the meaning with equal  fidelity, he very frequently selects that which has the less grace,  strength, or beauty.[I]    [H] On his second page, the line _Mein Lied ertoent der unbekannten  Menge_, \"My song sounds to the unknown multitude,\" is translated: \"My  _sorrow_ voices itself to the strange throng.\" Other English  translators, I notice, have followed Mr. Hayward in mistaking _Lied_ for  _Leid_.    I:   I take but one out of numerous instances, for the sake of  illustration. The close of the Soldier's Song (Part I. Scene II.) is:--              \"Kuehn is das Muehen,            Herrlich der Lohn!            Und die Soldaten            Ziehen davon.\"    Literally:              Bold is the endeavor,            Splendid the pay!            And the soldiers            March away.    This Mr. Hayward translates:--              Bold the adventure,            Noble the reward--            And the soldiers            Are off.    For there are few things which may not be said, in English, in a twofold  manner,--one poetic, and the other prosaic. In German, equally, a word  which in ordinary use has a bare prosaic character may receive a fairer  and finer quality from its place in verse. The prose translator should  certainly be able to feel the manifestation of this law in both  languages, and should so choose his words as to meet their reciprocal  requirements. A man, however, who is not keenly sensible to the power  and beauty and value of rhythm, is likely to overlook these delicate yet  most necessary distinctions. The author's thought is stripped of a last  grace in passing through his mind, and frequently presents very much the  same resemblance to the original as an unhewn shaft to the fluted  column. Mr. Hayward unconsciously illustrates his lack of a refined  appreciation of verse, \"in giving,\" as he says, \"_a sort of rhythmical  arrangement_ to the lyrical parts,\" his object being \"to convey some  notion of the variety of versification which forms one great charm of  the poem.\" A literal translation is always possible in the unrhymed  passages; but even here Mr. Hayward's ear did not dictate to him the  necessity of preserving the original rhythm.    While, therefore, I heartily recognize his lofty appreciation of  _Faust_,--while I honor him for the patient and conscientious labor he  has bestowed upon his translation,--I cannot but feel that he has  himself illustrated the unsoundness of his argument. Nevertheless, the  circumstance that his prose translation of _Faust_ has received so much  acceptance proves those qualities of the original work which cannot be  destroyed by a test so violent. From the cold bare outline thus  produced, the reader unacquainted with the German language would  scarcely guess what glow of color, what richness of changeful life, what  fluent grace and energy of movement have been lost in the process. We  must, of course, gratefully receive such an outline, where a nearer  approach to the form of the original is impossible, but, until the  latter has been demonstrated, we are wrong to remain content with the  cheaper substitute.    It seems to me that in all discussions upon this subject the capacities  of the English language have received but scanty justice. The  intellectual tendencies of our race have always been somewhat  conservative, and its standards of literary taste or belief, once set  up, are not varied without a struggle. The English ear is suspicious of  new metres and unaccustomed forms of expression: there are critical  detectives on the track of every author, and a violation of the accepted  canons is followed by a summons to judgment. Thus the tendency is to  contract rather than to expand the acknowledged excellences of the  language.[J]    [J] I cannot resist the temptation of quoting the following passage from  Jacob Grimm: \"No one of all the modern languages has acquired a greater  force and strength than the English, through the derangement and  relinquishment of its ancient laws of sound. The unteachable  (nevertheless _learnable_) profusion of its middle-tones has conferred  upon it an intrinsic power of expression, such as no other human tongue  ever possessed. Its entire, thoroughly intellectual and wonderfully  successful foundation and perfected development issued from a marvelous  union of the two noblest tongues of Europe, the Germanic and the  Romanic. Their mutual relation in the English language is well known,  since the former furnished chiefly the material basis, while the latter  added the intellectual conceptions. The English language, by and through  which the greatest and most eminent poet of modern times--as contrasted  with ancient classical poetry--(of course I can refer only to  Shakespeare) was begotten and nourished, has a just claim to be called a  language of the world; and it appears to be destined, like the English  race, to a higher and broader sway in all quarters of the earth. For in  richness, in compact adjustment of parts, and in pure intelligence, none  of the living languages can be compared with it,--not even our German,  which is divided even as we are divided, and which must cast off many  imperfections before it can boldly enter on its career.\"--_Ueber den  Ursprung der Sprache_.    The difficulties in the way of a nearly literal translation of _Faust_  in the original metres have been exaggerated, because certain affinities  between the two languages have not been properly considered. With all  the splendor of versification in the work, it contains but few metres of  which the English tongue is not equally capable. Hood has familiarized  us with dactylic (triple) rhymes, and they are remarkably abundant and  skillful in Mr. Lowell's \"Fable for the Critics\": even the unrhymed  iambic hexameter of the _Helena_ occurs now and then in Milton's _Samson  Agonistes_. It is true that the metrical foot into which the German  language most naturally falls is the _trochaic_, while in English it is  the _iambic_: it is true that German is rich, involved, and tolerant of  new combinations, while English is simple, direct, and rather shy of  compounds; but precisely these differences are so modified in the German  of _Faust_ that there is a mutual approach of the two languages. In  _Faust_, the iambic measure predominates; the style is compact; the many  licenses which the author allows himself are all directed towards a  shorter mode of construction. On the other hand, English metre compels  the use of inversions, admits many verbal liberties prohibited to prose,  and so inclines towards various flexible features of its sister-tongue  that many lines of _Faust_ may be repeated in English without the  slightest change of meaning, measure, or rhyme. There are words, it is  true, with so delicate a bloom upon them that it can in no wise be  preserved; but even such words will always lose less when they carry  with them their rhythmical atmosphere. The flow of Goethe's verse is  sometimes so similar to that of the corresponding English metre, that  not only its harmonies and caesural pauses, but even its punctuation,  may be easily retained.    I am satisfied that the difference between a translation of _Faust_ in  prose or metre is chiefly one of labor,--and of that labor which is  successful in proportion as it is joyously performed. My own task has  been cheered by the discovery, that the more closely I reproduced the  language of the original, the more of its rhythmical character was  transferred at"]]]
