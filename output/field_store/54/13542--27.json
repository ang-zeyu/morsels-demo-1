In these stories there are many incidents which appear in stories  collected in other parts of India, though it is rather surprising  that so few of them appear elsewhere in their entirety. We have  however, instances of the husk myth, the youngest son who surpasses  his brother, the life of the ogre placed in some external object, the  jealous stepmother, the selection of a king by an elephant, the queen  whose husband is invariably killed on his wedding night, etc. etc.    Few of the old Indian stories found in the Katha Sarit Sagara or the  Buddhist Birth stories appear in recognizable form in the present  collection.            I. Bajun and Jhore.    Once upon a time there were two brothers named Bajun and Jhore. Bajun  was married and one day his wife fell ill of fever. So, as he was  going ploughing, Bajun told Jhore to stay at home and cook the dinner  and he bade him put into the pot three measures of rice. Jhore stayed  at home and filled the pot with water and put it on to boil; then he  went to look for rice measures; there was only one in the house and  Jhore thought \"My brother told me to put in three measures and if I  only put in one I shall get into trouble.\" So he went to a neighbour's  house and borrowed two more measures, and put them into the pot and  left them to boil. At noon Bajun came back from ploughing and found  Jhore stirring the pot and asked him whether the rice was ready. Jhore  made no answer, so Bajun took the spoon from him, saying \"Let me feel  how it is getting on\", but when he stirred with the spoon he heard a  rattling noise and when he looked into the pot he found no rice but  only three wooden measures floating about; then he turned and abused  Jhore for his folly, but Jhore said \"You yourself told me to put in  three measures and I have done so.\" So Bajun had to set to work and  cook the rice himself and got his dinner very late.    Next day Bajun said to Jhore, \"You don't know how to cook the dinner;  I will stay at home to-day, you go to plough, and take a hatchet  with you and if the plough catches in a root or anything, give a  cut with the hatchet.\" So Jhore went ploughing and when the plough  caught in anything and stopped, he gave a cut with his hatchet at  the legs of the bullocks; they backed and plunged with the pain and  then he only chopped at them the more until he lamed them both. At  noon Bajun saw the bullocks come limping back and asked what was  the matter with them. \"O,\" said Jhore, \"that is because I cut at  them as you told me.\" \"You idiot,\" said Bajun, \"I meant you to give  a cut at the roots in which the plough got caught, not at the legs  of the bullocks; how will you live if you do such silly things? You  cannot plough, you must stay at home and cook the rice. I will show  you this evening how it is done.\" So after that Jhore stayed at home  and cooked. Bajun's wife grew no better, so one day Bajun, before he  went to the fields, told Jhore to warm some water in order that his  wife might wash with it. But Jhore made the water boiling hot and  then took it and began to pour it over his sister-in-law as she lay  on her bed; she was scalded and shrieked out \"Don't pour it over me,\"  but Jhore only laughed and went on pouring until he had scalded her  to death. Then he wrapped her up in a cloth and brought her dinner to  her and offered it her to eat, but she was dead and made no answer to  him, so he left it by her and went and ate his own rice. When Bajun  came back and found his wife scalded to death he was very angry and  went to get an axe to kill Jhore with; thereupon Jhore ran away into  the jungle and Bajun pursued him with the axe.    In the jungle Jhore found a dead sheep and he took out its stomach and  called out \"Where are you, brother, I have found some meat.\" But Bajun  answered, \"I will not leave you till I have killed you.\" So Jhore ran  on and climbed up inside a hollow tree, where Bajun could not follow,  Bajun got a long stick and poked at him with it and as he poked, Jhore  let fall the sheep's stomach, and when Bajun saw it he concluded that  he had killed his brother. So he went home and burned the body of  his wife and a few days later he performed the funeral ceremonies to  the memory of his wife and brother; he smeared the floor of the house  with cowdung and sacrificed goats and fowls. Now Jhore had come back  that day and climbed up on to the rafters of the house, and he sat  there watching all that his brother did. Bajun cooked a great basket  of rice and stewed the flesh of the animals he had sacrificed and  offered it to the spirits of the dead and he recited the dedication  \"My wife I offer this rice, this food, for your purification,\" and  so saying he scattered some rice on the ground; and he also offered  to Jhore, saying, \"Jhore, my brother, I offer this rice, this food,  for your purification,\" and then Jhore called out from the roof \"Well,  as you offer it to me I will take it.\" Bajun had not bargained to get  any answer, so he was astounded and went to ask the villagers whether  their spirits made answer when sacrificed to: and the villagers told  him that they had never heard of such a thing. While Bajun was away  on this errand, Jhore took up the unguarded basket of rice and ran  away with it; after going some way he sat down by the road and ate  as much as he wanted, then he sat and called out \"Is there anyone on  the road or in the jungle who wants a feast?\" A gang of thieves who  were on a thieving expedition heard him and went to see what he meant;  he offered to let them eat the rice if they would admit him to their  company; they agreed and he went on with them to steal; they broke  into a rich man's house and the thieves began to collect the pots  and pans but Jhore felt about in the dark and got hold of a drum and  began to beat on it. This woke up the people of the house and they  drove away the thieves. Then the thieves abused Jhore and said that  they could not let him stay with them: \"Very well\", said he, \"then  give me back the rice you ate.\" Of course they could not do this. So  they had to let him stay with them. Then they went to the house of a  rich Hindu who had a stable full of horses and they planned to steal  the horses and ride away with them; so each thief picked out a horse,  but Jhore got hold of a tiger which had come to the back of the stable  to kill one of the horses; and when the thieves mounted their horses,  Jhore mounted on the tiger, and the tiger ran off with him towards the  jungle. Jhore kept on calling out \"Keep to the road, you Hindu horse,  keep to the road, you Hindu horse.\" But it dragged him through the  briars and bushes till he was dead and that was the end of Jhore.          II. Anuwa and His Mother.    Once there was a young fellow named Anuwa who lived with his old  mother, and when he was out ploughing his mother used to take him  his breakfast. One day a jackal met her on her way to the field with  her son's breakfast and told her to put down the food which she was  carrying or he would knock her down and bite her; so she put it down  in a fright and the jackal ate most of it and then went away and  the old woman took what was left to her son and told him nothing  about what had happened. This happened several days in succession;  at last one day Anuwa asked her why she brought so little rice and  that so untidily arranged; so she told him how she was attacked every  day by the jackal. Then they made a plan that the next day the mother  should take the plough afield, while Anuwa should dress up as an old  woman and carry the breakfast. This they did and the jackal met Anuwa  as usual and made him put down the breakfast basket, but while the  jackal was eating, Anuwa knocked him head over heels with his stick;  and the jackal got up and fled, threatening and cursing Anuwa. Among  other things the jackal as he ran away, had threatened to eat Anuwa's  _malhan_ plants, so Anuwa put a fence of thorns round them and when  the jackal came at night and tried to eat the pods he only got his  nose pricked.    Foiled in this the jackal called out \"Well, I will eat your fowls  to-morrow;\" but Anuwa the next night sat by the fowl house with a  sickle and when the jackal came and poked in his head, Anuwa gave him a  rap on the snout with the sickle, so the jackal made off crying \"Well,  Anuwa, your fowls have pecked me on the head, you shall"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11951"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 1 (#2)"],[1," or huge wild ox, and with elks, too--a kind of beast  that one finds no longer nowadays, save in the colder regions of  north-eastern Europe, such as Lithuania and Courland.  Then wandered  over the champaign great herds of swine, as fierce almost as wolves,  tamed only so far as to know the sound of their keeper's horn.  The  better sort of fruits and of vegetables were quite unknown; they were  imported into Gaul--the greatest part from Asia, a portion from Africa  and the islands of the Mediterranean; and others, at a later period,  from the New World. Cold and rough was the prevailing temperature.  Nearly every winter the rivers froze sufficiently hard for the passage  of cars.  And three or four centuries before the Christian era, on that  vast territory comprised between the ocean, the Pyrenees, the  Mediterranean, the Alps, and the Rhine, lived six or seven millions of  men a bestial life, enclosed in dwellings dark and low, the best of them  built of wood and clay, covered with branches or straw, made in a single  round piece, open to daylight by the door alone, and confusedly heaped  together behind a rampart, not inartistically composed of timber, earth,  and stone, which surrounded and protected what they were pleased to call  a town.    [Illustration: Ideal Landscape of Ancient Gaul----13]    Of even such towns there were scarcely any as yet, save in the most  populous and least uncultivated portion of Gaul; that is to say, in the  southern and eastern regions, at the foot of the mountains of Auvergne  and the Cevennes, and along the coasts of the Mediterranean.  In the  north and the west were paltry hamlets, as transferable almost as the  people themselves; and on some islet amidst the morasses, or in some  hidden recess of the forest, were huge intrenchments formed of the trees  that were felled, where the population, at the first sound of the  war-cry, ran to shelter themselves with their flocks and all their  movables.  And the war-cry was often heard: men living grossly and idly  are very prone to quarrel and fight.  Gaul, moreover, was not occupied by  one and the same nation, with the same traditions and the same chiefs.  Tribes very different in origin, habits, and date of settlement, were  continually disputing the territory.  In the south were Iberians or  Aquitanians, Phoenicians and Greeks; in the north and north-west,  Kymrians or Belgians; everywhere else, Gauls or Celts, the most numerous  settlers, who had the honor of giving their name to the country.  Who  were the first to come, then? and what was the date of the first  settlement?  Nobody knows.  Of the Greeks alone does history mark with  any precision the arrival in southern Gaul.  The Phoenicians preceded  them by several centuries; but it is impossible to fix any exact time.  The information is equally vague about the period when the Kymrians  invaded the north of Gaul.  As for the Gauls and the Iberians, there is  not a word about their first entrance into the country, for they are  discovered there already at the first appearance of the country itself in  the domain of history.    The Iberians, whom Roman writers call Aquitanians, dwelt at the foot of  the Pyrenees, in the territory comprised between the mountains, the  Garonne, and the ocean.  They belonged to the race which, under the same  appellation, had peopled Spain; but by what route they came into Gaul is  a problem which we cannot solve.  It is much the same in tracing the  origin of every nation, for in those barbarous times men lived and died  without leaving any enduring memorial of their deeds and their destinies;  no monuments; no writings; just a few oral traditions, perhaps, which are  speedily lost or altered.  It is in proportion as they become enlightened  and civilized, that men feel the desire and discover the means of  extending their memorial far beyond their own lifetime.  That is the  beginning of history, the offspring of noble and useful sentiments, which  cause the mind to dwell upon the future, and to yearn for long  continuance; sentiments which testify to the superiority of man over all  other creatures living upon our earth, which foreshadow the immortality  of the soul, and which are warrant for the progress of the human race by  preserving for the generations to come what has been done and learned by  the generations that disappear.    By whatever route and at whatever epoch the Iberians came into the  south-west of Gaul, they abide there still in the department of the Lower  Pyrenees, under the name of Basques; a people distinct from all its  neighbors in features, costume, and especially language, which resembles  none of the present languages of Europe, contains many words which are to  be found in the names of rivers, mountains, and towns of olden Spain, and  which presents a considerable analogy to the idioms, ancient and modern,  of certain peoples of northern Africa.  The Phoenicians did not leave, as  the Iberians did, in the south of France distinct and well-authenticated  descendants.  They had begun about 1100 B.C.  to trade there.  They went  thither in search of furs, and gold and silver, which were got either  from the sand of certain rivers, as for instance the Allege (in Latin  Aurigera), or from certain mines of the Alps, the Cevennes, and the  Pyrenees; they brought in exchange stuffs dyed with purple, necklaces and  rings of glass, and, above all, arms and wine; a trade like that which is  nowadays carried on by the civilized peoples of Europe with the savage  tribes of Africa and America.  For the purpose of extending and securing  their commercial expeditions, the Phoenicians founded colonies in several  parts of Gaul, and to them is attributed the earliest origin of Nemausus  (Nimes), and of Alesia, near Semur.  But, at the end of three or four  centuries, these colonies fell into decay; the trade of the Phoenicians  was withdrawn from Gaul, and the only important sign it preserved of  their residence was a road which, starting from the eastern Pyrenees,  skirted the Gallic portion of the Mediterranean, crossed the Alps by the  pass of Tenda, and so united Spain, Gaul, and Italy.  After the  withdrawal of the Phoenicians this road was kept up and repaired, at  first by the Greeks of Marseilles, and subsequently by the Romans.    As merchants and colonists, the Greeks were, in Gaul, the successors of  the Phoenicians, and Marseilles was one of their first and most  considerable colonies.  At the time of the Phoenicians' decay in Gaul, a  Greek people, the Rhodians, had pushed their commercial enterprises to a  great distance, and, in the words of the ancient historians, held the  empire of the sea.  Their ancestors had, in former times, succeeded the  Phoenicians in the island of Rhodes, and they likewise succeeded them in  the south of Gaul, and founded, at the mouth of the Rhone, a colony  called Rhodanusia or Rhoda, with the same name as that which they had  already founded on the north-east coast of Spain, and which is nowadays  the town of Rosas, in Catalonia.  But the importance of the Rhodians on  the southern coast of Gaul was short-lived.  It had already sunk very low  in the year 600 B.C., when Euxenes, a Greek trader, coming from Phocea,  an Ionian town of Asia Minor, to seek his fortune, landed from a bay  eastward of the Rhone.  The Segobrigians, a tribe of the Gallic race,  were in occupation of the neighboring country.  Nann, their chief, gave  the strangers kindly welcome, and took them home with him to a great  feast which he was giving for his daughter's marriage, who was called  Gyptis, according to some, and Petta, according to other historians.  A  custom which exists still in several cantons of the Basque country, and  even at the centre of France in Morvan, a mountainous district of the  department of the Nievre, would that the maiden should appear only at the  end of the banquet, and holding in her hand a filled wine-cup, and that  the guest to whom she should present it should become the husband of her  choice.  By accident, or quite another cause, say the ancient legends,  Gyptis stopped opposite Euxenes, and handed him the cup.  Great was the  surprise, and, probably, anger amongst the Gauls who were present.  But  Nann, believing he recognized a commandment from his gods, accepted the  Phocean as his son-in-law, and gave him as dowry the bay where he had  landed, with some cantons of the territory around.  Euxenes, in  gratitude, gave his wife the Greek name of Aristoxena (that is, \"the best  of hostesses\"), sent away his ship to Phocea for colonists, and, whilst  waiting for them, laid in the centre of the bay, on a peninsula hollowed  out harbor-wise, towards the south, the foundations of a town, which he  called Massilia--thence Marseilles.    [Illustration: Gyptis presenting the Goblet to Euxenes----17]    Scarcely a year had elapsed when Euxenes' ship arrived from Phocea, and  with it several galleys, bringing colonists full of hope, and laden with  provisions, utensils, arms, seeds, vine-cuttings, and olive-cuttings,  and, moreover, a statue of Diana, which the colonists had gone to fetch  from the celebrated temple of that goddess at Ephesus, and which her  priestess, Aristarche, accompanied to its new country.    The activity and prosperity of Marseilles, both within and without, were  rapidly developed.  She carried her commerce wherever the Phoenicians and  the Rhodians had marked out a road; she repaired their forts; she took to  herself their establishments; and she placed on her medals, to signify  dominion, the rose, the emblem of Rhodes, beside the lion of Marseilles.  But Nann, the Gallic chieftain, who had protected her infancy, died; and  his son, Conran, shared the jealousy felt by the Segobrigians and the  neighboring peoplets towards the new corners.  He promised and really  resolved to destroy the new city.  It was the time of the flowering of  the vine, a season"]]]
