Well, Heath and his wife arrived late one evening, and  after lunch the following day, most of the men being off by  themselves--shooting, I think--my daughter, my sister (who is very often  down here), and Mrs. Heath took it into their heads to go  walking--fern-hunting, and so on. My sister was rather long dressing, and,  while they waited, my daughter went into Mrs. Heath's room, where Mrs.  Heath turned over all her treasures to show her, as women do, you know.  When my sister was at last ready, they came straight away, leaving the  things littering about the room rather than stay longer to pack them up.  The bracelet, with other things, was on the dressing-table then.\"    \"One moment. As to the door?\"    \"They locked it. As they came away my daughter suggested turning the key,  as we had one or two new servants about.\"    \"And the window?\"    \"That they left open, as I was going to tell you. Well, they went on their  walk and came back, with Lloyd (whom they had met somewhere) carrying  their ferns for them. It was dusk and almost dinner-time. Mrs. Heath went  straight to her room, and--the bracelet was gone.\"    \"Was the room disturbed?\"    \"Not a bit. Everything was precisely where it had been left, except the  bracelet. The door hadn't been tampered with, but of course the window was  open, as I have told you.\"    \"You called the police, of course?\"    \"Yes, and had a man from Scotland Yard down in the morning. He seemed a  pretty smart fellow, and the first thing he noticed on the dressing-table,  within an inch or two of where the bracelet had been, was a match, which  had been lit and thrown down. Now nobody about the house had had occasion  to use a match in that room that day, and, if they had, certainly wouldn't  have thrown it on the cover of the dressing-table. So that, presuming the  thief to have used that match, the robbery must have been committed when  the room was getting dark--immediately before Mrs. Heath returned, in  fact. The thief had evidently struck the match, passed it hurriedly over  the various trinkets lying about, and taken the most valuable.\"    \"Nothing else was even moved?\"    \"Nothing at all. Then the thief must have escaped by the window, although  it was not quite clear how. The walking party approached the house with a  full view of the window, but saw nothing, although the robbery must have  been actually taking place a moment or two before they turned up.    \"There was no water-pipe within any practicable distance of the window,  but a ladder usually kept in the stable-yard was found lying along the  edge of the lawn. The gardener explained, however, that he had put the  ladder there after using it himself early in the afternoon.\"    \"Of course it might easily have been used again after that and put back.\"    \"Just what the Scotland Yard man said. He was pretty sharp, too, on the  gardener, but very soon decided that he knew nothing of it. No stranger  had been seen in the neighborhood, nor had passed the lodge gates.  Besides, as the detective said, it scarcely seemed the work of a stranger.  A stranger could scarcely have known enough to go straight to the room  where a lady--only arrived the day before--had left a valuable jewel, and  away again without being seen. So all the people about the house were  suspected in turn. The servants offered, in a body, to have their boxes  searched, and this was done; everything was turned over, from the butler's  to the new kitchen-maid's. I don't know that I should have had this  carried quite so far if I had been the loser myself, but it was my guest,  and I was in such a horrible position. Well, there's little more to be  said about that, unfortunately. Nothing came of it all, and the thing's as  great a mystery now as ever. I believe the Scotland Yard man got as far as  suspecting _me_ before he gave it up altogether, but give it up he did in  the end. I think that's all I know about the first robbery. Is it clear?\"    \"Oh, yes; I shall probably want to ask a few questions when I have seen  the place, but they can wait. What next?\"    \"Well,\" Sir James pursued, \"the next was a very trumpery affair, that I  should have forgotten all about, probably, if it hadn't been for one  circumstance. Even now I hardly think it could have been the work of the  same hand. Four months or thereabout after Mrs. Heath's disaster--in  February of this year, in fact--Mrs. Armitage, a young widow, who had been  a school-fellow of my daughter's, stayed with us for a week or so. The  girls don't trouble about the London season, you know, and I have no town  house, so they were glad to have their old friend here for a little in the  dull time. Mrs. Armitage is a very active young lady, and was scarcely in  the house half an hour before she arranged a drive in a pony-cart with  Eva--my daughter--to look up old people in the village that she used to  know before she was married. So they set off in the afternoon, and made  such a round of it that they were late for dinner. Mrs. Armitage had a  small plain gold brooch--not at all valuable, you know; two or three  pounds, I suppose--which she used to pin up a cloak or anything of that  sort. Before she went out she stuck this in the pin-cushion on her  dressing-table, and left a ring--rather a good one, I believe--lying close  by.\"    \"This,\" asked Hewitt, \"was not in the room that Mrs. Heath had occupied, I  take it?\"    \"No; this was in another part of the building. Well, the brooch  went--taken, evidently, by some one in a deuce of a hurry, for, when Mrs.  Armitage got back to her room, there was the pin-cushion with a little  tear in it, where the brooch had been simply snatched off. But the curious  thing was that the ring--worth a dozen of the brooch--was left where it  had been put. Mrs. Armitage didn't remember whether or not she had locked  the door herself, although she found it locked when she returned; but my  niece, who was indoors all the time, went and tried it once--because she  remembered that a gas-fitter was at work on the landing near by--and found  it safely locked. The gas-fitter, whom we didn't know at the time, but who  since seems to be quite an honest fellow, was ready to swear that nobody  but my niece had been to the door while he was in sight of it--which was  almost all the time. As to the window, the sash-line had broken that very  morning, and Mrs. Armitage had propped open the bottom half about eight or  ten inches with a brush; and, when she returned, that brush, sash, and all  were exactly as she had left them. Now I scarcely need tell _you_ what an  awkward job it must have been for anybody to get noiselessly in at that  unsupported window; and how unlikely he would have been to replace it,  with the brush, exactly as he found it.\"    \"Just so. I suppose the brooch, was really gone? I mean, there was no  chance of Mrs. Armitage having mislaid it?\"    \"Oh, none at all! There was a most careful search.\"    \"Then, as to getting in at the window, would it have been easy?\"    \"Well, yes,\" Sir James replied; \"yes, perhaps it would. It was a  first-floor window, and it looks over the roof and skylight of the  billiard-room. I built the billiard-room myself--built it out from a  smoking-room just at this corner. It would be easy enough to get at the  window from the billiard-room roof. But, then,\" he added, \"that couldn't  have been the way. Somebody or other was in the billiard-room the whole  time, and nobody could have got over the roof (which is nearly all  skylight) without being seen and heard. I was there myself for an hour or  two, taking a little practice.\"    \"Well, was anything done?\"    \"Strict inquiry was made among the servants, of course, but nothing came  of it. It was such a small matter that Mrs. Armitage wouldn't hear of my  calling in the police or anything of that sort, although I felt pretty  certain that there must be a dishonest servant about somewhere. A servant  might take a plain brooch, you know, who would feel afraid of a valuable  ring, the loss of which would be made a greater matter of.\"    \"Well, yes, perhaps so, in the case of an inexperienced thief, who also  would be likely to snatch up whatever she took in a hurry. But I'm  doubtful. What made you connect these two robberies together?\"    \"Nothing whatever--for some months. They seemed quite of a different sort.  But scarcely more than a month ago I met Mrs. Armitage at Brighton, and we  talked, among other things, of the previous robbery--that of Mrs. Heath's  bracelet. I described the circumstances pretty minutely, and, when I  mentioned the match found on the table, she said: 'How strange! Why, _my_  thief left a match on the dressing-table when he took my poor little  brooch!'\"    Hewitt nodded. \"Yes,\" he said. \"A spent match, of course?\"    \"Yes, of course, a spent match. She noticed it lying close by the  pin-cushion, but threw it away without mentioning the circumstance. Still,  it seemed rather curious to me that a match should be lit and dropped, in  each case, on the dressing-cover an inch from where the article was taken.  I mentioned it to Lloyd when I got back, and he agreed that it seemed  significant.\"    \"Scarcely,\" said Hewitt, shaking his head. \"Scarcely, so far, to be called  significant, although worth following up. Everybody uses matches in the  dark, you know.\"    \"Well, at any rate, the coincidence appealed to me so far that it struck  me it might be worth while to describe the brooch to the police in order  that they could trace it if it had been pawned. They had tried that, of  course, over the bracelet without any result, but I fancied the shot might  be worth making, and might possibly lead us on the track of the more  serious robbery.\"    \"Quite so. It was the right thing to do. Well?\"    \"Well, they found it. A woman had pawned it in London--at a shop in  Chelsea.

She never got in contact wid her folks no more after she was sold.  She was a dark woman. Papa was a ginger cake colored man. Mama talked  like Alex Rogers had four or five hundred acres of land and lots of  niggers to work it. She said he had a cotton factory at Brownsville.    \"Mistress Barbara Ann was his wife. They had two boys and three girls.  One boy George went plumb crazy and outlived 'em all. The other boy died  early. Alex Rogers got my papa in Richmond, Virginia. He was took outer  a gang.

They'd buy a barrel of coffee, a  barrel molasses, a barrel sugar. Some great big barrels.    \"Alex Rogers wasn't a good man. He'd tell them to steal a hog and git  home wid it.

Interviewer: Mrs. Zillah Cross Peel  Person interviewed: \"Aunt Adeline\"      Age: 89  Home: 101 Rock Street, Fayetteville, Arkansas      \"I was born a slave about 1848, in Hickmon County, Tennessee,\" said Aunt  Adeline who lives as care taker in a house at 101 Rock Street,  Fayetteville, Arkansas, which is owned by the Blakely-Hudgens estate.    Aunt Adeline has been a slave and a servant in five generations of the  Parks family. Her mother, Liza, with a group of five Negroes, was sold  into slavery to John P.A. Parks, in Tennessee, about 1840.    \"When my mother's master come to Arkansas about 1849, looking for a  country residence, he bought what was known as the old Kidd place on the  Old Wire Road, which was one of the Stage Coach stops. I was about one  year old when we came. We had a big house and many times passengers  would stay several days and wait for the next stage to come by. It was  then that I earned my first money. I must have been about six or seven  years old. One of Mr. Parks' daughters was about one and a half years  older than I was. We had a play house back of the fireplace chimney. We  didn't have many toys; maybe a doll made of a corn cob, with a dress  made from scraps and a head made from a roll of scraps. We were playing  church. Miss Fannie was the preacher and I was the audience. We were  singing \"Jesus my all to Heaven is gone.\" When we were half way through  with our song we discovered that the passengers from the stage coach had  stopped to listen. We were so frightened at our audience that we both  ran. But we were coaxed to come back for a dime and sing our song over.  I remember that Miss Fannie used a big leaf for a book.    \"I had always been told from the time I was a small child that I was a  Negro of African stock. That it was no disgrace to be a Negro and had it  not been for the white folks who brought us over here from Africa as  slaves, we would never have been here and would have been much better  off.    \"We colored folks were not allowed to be taught to read or write. It was  against the law. My master's folks always treated me well. I had good  clothes. Sometimes I was whipped for things I should not have done just  as the white children were.    \"When a young girl was married her parents would always give her a  slave. I was given by my master to his daughter, Miss Elizabeth, who  married Mr. Blakely. I was just five years old. She moved into a new  home at Fayetteville and I was taken along but she soon sent me back  home to my master telling him that I was too little and not enough help  to her. So I went back to the Parks home and stayed until I was over  seven years old. [1]My master made a bill of sale for me to his  daughter, in order to keep account of all settlements, so when he died  and the estate settled each child would know how he stood.    \"I was about 15 years old when the Civil War ended and was still living  with Mrs. Blakely and helped care for her little children.
