There can scarcely be a  doubt that twenty-five hundred years ago the daily life and social  customs in the north of India, which had been under undisputed Aryan  control long enough for the Sanscrit language to spring up, come to  perfection and finally become obsolete, were more like ours than like  those of modern India after the, many--and especially the  Mohammedan--conquests and after centuries of oppression and alien rule.    If a thousand English-speaking Aryans should now be placed on some  distant island, how much would their social customs and even amusements  differ from ours in a hundred years?  Only so far as changed climate  and surrounding's compelled.    I give as an introduction an outline of the golden, silver, brazen and  iron ages, as described by the ancient poets and believed in by all  antiquity, as it was in the very depths of the darkness of the iron age  that our great light appeared in Northern India.  The very denseness of  the darkness of the age in which he came makes the clearness of the  light more wonderful, and accounts for the joy with which it was  received and the rapidity with which it spread.    Not to enter into the niceties of chronological questions, the mission  of Buddha may be roughly said to have commenced about five hundred  years before the commencement of our era, and with incessant labors and  long and repeated journeys to have lasted forty-five years, when at  about the age of eighty he died, or, as the Buddhists more truthfully  and more beautifully say, entered Nirvana.      HENRY T. NILES.    TOLEDO, January 1, 1894.          *      *      *      *      *    Since this work was in the hands of the printer I have read the recent  work of Bishop Copelston, of Columbo, Ceylon, and it was a source of no  small gratification to find him in all material points agreeing with  the result of my somewhat extensive investigations as given within, for  in Ceylon, if anywhere, we would expect accuracy.  Here the great  Buddhist development first comes in contact with authentic history  during the third century B.C. in the reign of the great Asoka, the  discovery of whose rock inscriptions shed such a flood of light on  primitive Buddhism, while it still retained enough of its primitive  power, as we learn from those inscriptions themselves, to turn that  monarch from a course of cruel tyranny, and, as we learn from the  history of Ceylon, to induce his son and daughter to abandon royalty  and become the first missionaries to that beautiful island.    H.T.N.            INTRODUCTION.      The golden age--when men were brothers all,    The golden rule their law and God their king;    When no fierce beasts did through the forests roam,    Nor poisonous reptiles crawl upon the ground;    When trees bore only wholesome, luscious fruits,    And thornless roses breathed their sweet perfumes;    When sickness, sin and sorrow were unknown,    And tears but spoke of joy too deep for words;    When painless death but led to higher life,    A life that knows no end, in that bright world    Whence angels on the ladder Jacob saw,    Descending, talk with man as friend to friend--    That age of purity and peace had passed,    But left a living memory behind,    Cherished and handed down from sire to son    Through all the scattered peoples of the earth,    A living prophecy of what this world,    This sad and sinful world, might yet become.      The silver age--an age of faith, not sight--    Came next, when reason ruled instead of love;    When men as through a glass but darkly saw    What to their fathers clearly stood revealed    In God's own light of love-illumined truth,    Of which the sun that rising paints the east,    And whose last rays with glory gild the west,    Is but an outbirth.  Then were temples reared,    And priests 'mid clouds of incense sang His praise    Who out of densest darkness called the light,    And from His own unbounded fullness made    The heavens and earth and all that in them is.    Then landmarks were first set, lest men contend    For God's free gifts, that all in peace had shared.    Then laws were made to govern those whose sires    Were laws unto themselves.  Then sickness came,    And grief and pain attended men from birth to death.    But still a silver light lined every cloud,    And hope was given to cheer and comfort men.      The brazen age, brilliant but cold, succeeds.    This was an age of knowledge, art and war,    When the knights-errant of the ancient world,    Adventures seeking, roamed with brazen swords    Which by a wondrous art--then known, now lost--    Were hard as flint, and edged to cut a hair    Or cleave in twain a warrior armor-clad    And armed with shields adorned by Vulcan's art,    Wonder of coming times and theme for bards.[1]    Then science searched through nature's heights and depths.    Heaven's canopy thick set with stars was mapped,    The constellations named, and all the laws searched out    That guide their motions, rolling sphere on sphere.[2]    Then men by reasonings piled up mountain high    Thought to scale heaven, and to dethrone heaven's king,    Whose imitators weak, with quips and quirks    And ridicule would now destroy all sacred things.    This age great Homer and old Hesiod sang,    And gods they made of hero, artist, bard.      At length this twilight of the ages fades,    And starless night now sinks upon the world--    An age of iron, cruel, dark and cold.    On Asia first this outer darkness fell,    Once seat of paradise, primordial peace,    Perennial harmony and perfect love.    A despot's will was then a nation's law;    An idol's car crushed out poor human lives,    And human blood polluted many shrines.    Then human speculation made of God    A shoreless ocean, distant, waveless, vast,    Of truth that sees not and unfeeling love,    Whence souls as drops were taken back to fall,    Absorbed and lost, when, countless ages passed,    They should complete their round as souls of men,    Of beasts, of birds and of all creeping things.    And, even worse, the cruel iron castes,    One caste too holy for another's touch,    Had every human aspiration crushed,    The common brotherhood of man destroyed,    And made all men but Pharisees or slaves.    And worst of all--and what could e'en be worse?--    Woman, bone of man's bone, flesh of his flesh,    The equal partner of a double life,    Who in the world's best days stood by his side    To lighten every care, and heighten every joy,    And in the world's decline still clung to him,    She only true when all beside were false,    When all were cruel she alone still kind,    Light of his hearth and mistress of his home,    Sole spot where peace and joy could still be found--    Woman herself cast down, despised was made    Slave to man's luxury and brutal lust.    Then war was rapine, havoc, needless blood,    Infants impaled before their mothers' eyes,    Women dishonored, mutilated, slain,    Parents but spared to see their children die.    Then peace was but a faithless, hollow truce,    With plots and counter-plots; the dagger's point    And poisoned cup instead of open war;    And life a savage, grim conspiracy    Of mutual murder, treachery and greed.    O dark and cruel age!  O cruel creeds!    O cruel men!  O crushed and bleeding hearts,    That from the very ground in anguish cry:    \"Is there no light--no hope--no help--no God?\"      [1]See Hesiod's description of the shield of Hercules, the St. George  of that ancient age of chivalry.

BOOK I.      Northward from Ganges' stream and India's plains    An ancient city crowned a lofty hill,    Whose high embattled walls had often rolled    The surging, angry tide of battle back.    Walled on three sides, but on the north a cliff,    At once the city's quarry and its guard,    Cut out in galleries, with vaulted roofs[1]    Upborne upon cyclopean columns vast,    Chiseled with art, their capitals adorned    With lions, elephants, and bulls, life size,    Once dedicate to many monstrous gods    Before the Aryan race as victors came,    Then prisons, granaries and magazines,    Now only known to bandits and wild beasts.    This cliff, extending at each end, bends north,    And rises in two mountain-chains that end    In two vast snow-capped Himalayan peaks,    Between which runs a glittering glacial stream,    A mighty moving mass of crystal ice,    Crushing the rocks in its resistless course;    From which bursts forth a river that had made    Of all this valley one great highland lake,    Which on one side had burst its bounds and cut    In myriad years a channel through the rock,    So narrow that a goat might almost leap    From cliff to cliff--these cliffs so smooth and steep    The eagles scarce could build upon their sides;    This yawning chasm so deep one scarce could hear    The angry waters roaring far below.      This stream, guided by art, now fed a lake    Above the city and behind this cliff,    Which, guided thence in channels through the rock,    Fed many fountains, sending crystal streams    Through every street and down the terraced hill,    And through the plain in little silver streams,    Spreading the richest verdure far and wide.[2]    Here was the seat of King Suddhodana,    His royal park, walled by eternal hills,    Where trees and shrubs and flowers all native grew;    For in its bounds all the four seasons met,    From ever-laughing, ever-blooming spring    To savage winter with eternal snows.

[Illustration: DIAGRAM OF IMMIGRATION RETURNS.    NOTE:--IN THE YEARS 1888, 1889 & 1890 THE ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT ASSISTED  PASSAGES.]    Mr. Wheelwright was an earnest and far-seeing man, and his knowledge of  railways in the United States helped him to realise their great  possibilities in Argentina; but, strange to say, upon his return to his  native land he could not impress any of those men who afterwards became  such great \"Railway Kings\" in the U.S.A. Failing to obtain capital for  Argentine railway development in his own country, Wheelwright came to  England, and interested Thomas Brassey, whose name was then a household  word amongst railway pioneers. These two men associated themselves with  Messrs. Ogilvie & Wythes, forming themselves into the firm of Brassey,  Ogilvie, Wythes & Wheelwright, whose first work was the building of a  railway 17,480 kilometres long between Buenos Aires and Quilmes in 1863;  afterwards they built the line from Rosario to Cordova, which is  embodied to-day in the Central Argentine Railway. Other railways were  projected, and this policy of progress and extension of the steel road  still holds good in Argentina.    The year 1857 saw the first railway built, from Buenos Ayres to Flores,  5,879 kilometres long; in 1870 there were 457 miles of railroad; in 1880  the railways had increased their mileage to 1,572; in 1890 Argentina  possessed 5,895 miles of railway, and in 1900 there were 10,352 miles.    The rapid increase in railway mileage during the last nine years is as  follows:--    In 1901 there were 10,565 miles of railway.   \" 1902  \"     \"   10,868   \"    \"    \"   \" 1903  \"     \"   11,500   \"    \"    \"   \" 1904  \"     \"   12,140   \"    \"    \"   \" 1905  \"     \"   12,370   \"    \"    \"   \" 1906  \"     \"   12,850   \"    \"    \"   \" 1907  \"     \"   13,829   \"    \"    \"   \" 1908  \"     \"   14,825   \"    \"    \"   \" 1909  \"     \"   15,937[A]\"    \"    \"    12,000 of which are owned by English companies, representing a capital  investment of L170,000,000.    In other words, for the last forty years Argentina has built railways  at the rate of over a mile a day, and in 1907, 1908, and 1909 her  average rate per day was nearly three miles. This means that owing to  the extension of railways during this last year alone, over a million  more acres of land could have been given up to the plough if suitable  for the cultivation of corn.    When William Wheelwright first visited Argentina it was little more than  an unknown land, whose inhabitants had no ambition, and no desire to  acquire wealth--except at the expense of broken heads. There was a  standard of wealth, but it lay in the number of cattle owned; land was  of little value, save for feeding cattle, and therefore counted for  naught, but cattle could be boiled down for tallow; bones and hides were  also marketable commodities; the man, therefore, who possessed cattle  possessed wealth.    The opening out of the country by railways soon changed the aspect of  affairs. The man who possessed cattle was no longer considered the rich  man; it was he who owned leagues of land upon which wheat could be grown  who became the potentially rich man; he, by cutting up his land and  renting it to the immigrants, who were beginning to flock in in an  endless stream to the country, found that riches were being accumulated  for him without much exertion on his part. He took a risk inasmuch as he  received payment in kind only. Therefore, when the immigrants did well,  so did he, and as many thousands of immigrants have become rich, it  follows that the land proprietors have become immensely so. It was the  railways which created this possibility, and endowed the country by  rendering it practicable to grow corn where cattle only existed before,  but many Argentines to-day forget what they owe to the railway pioneers;  it is the railways, and the railways only, which render the splendid and  yearly increasing exports possible.    In 1858 cattle formed 25 per cent. of the total wealth of Argentina, but  in 1885 cattle only represented 18 per cent. of the total wealth,  railways having made it possible during those thirty years to utilise  lands for other purposes than cattle-feeding. Let it be clearly  understood, the total value of cattle had not decreased; far from that,  the cattle had increased in value during the above period to the extent  of L48,000,000, and to-day cattle, sheep, horses, mules, pigs, goats and  asses represent a value of nearly L130,000,000. The following table  shows how great the improvement has been in Argentine animals:--                                                 Per Head.  Cattle in 1885 were valued at an average of  $13[B]     \"      1908        \"      \"      \"         32  Sheep  in 1885        \"      \"      \"          2     \"      1908        \"      \"      \"          4  Horses in 1885        \"      \"      \"         11            1908        \"      \"      \"         25    Notwithstanding these increased valuations per head, and the larger  number of animals in the country, the value created by man's labour far  outweighs the increased value of mere breeding animals.    Next to the railways the improvements in shipping have helped the  development of Argentina; the shipping trade of Buenos Aires has  increased at the rate of one million tons per annum for the past few  years, and the entries into the port form an interesting and instructive  table:    The following statement gives the total tonnage that passed through the  port of Buenos Aires from 1880 to 1909, and will more clearly show the  increase and advance made in the last thirty years. These figures  include both steamers and sailing-vessels, and local as well as foreign  trade:--                    Tons.  1880  ...    644,750  1881  ...    827,072  1882  ...    995,597  1883  ...  1,207,321  1884  ...  1,782,382  1885  ...  2,200,779  1886  ...  2,408,323  1887  ...  3,369,057  1888  ...  3,396,212  1889  ...  3,804,037  1890  ...  4,507,096  1891  ...  4,546,729  1892  ...  5,475,942  1893  ...  6,177,818  1894  ...  6,686,123  1895  ...  6,894,834  1896  ...  6,115,547  1897  ...  7,365,547  1898  ...  8,051,045  1899  ...  8,741,934  1900  ...  8,047,010  1901  ...  8,661,300  1902  ...  8,902,605  1903  ... 10,269,298  1904  ... 10,424,615  1905  ... 11,467,954  1906  ... 12,448,219  1907  ... 13,335,733  1908  ... 15,465,417  1909  ... 16,993,973    In 1897, out of the total number of steamers that entered Buenos Aires,  viz., 901, with a tonnage of 2,342,391; 519, with a tonnage of  1,327,571, were British. Taking the year 1909 we find that 2,008  steamers and 137 sailing-vessels entered the port of Buenos Aires from  foreign shores with a tonnage of 5,193,542, and 1,978 steamers and 129  sailing-vessels left the port for foreign shores with a tonnage of  5,174,114; out of these, British boats lead with 2,242 steamers and 37  sailing-vessels, or say 53-1/2 per cent. of the total. Germany comes  next with 456 steamers and 2 sailing-vessels, or say 10-3/4 per cent, of  the total. Italy with 307 steamers and 67 sailing-vessels is next, and  then France with 264 steamers. The total number of steamers that entered  and left the port from local and foreign ports is 13,485, with a tonnage  of 14,481,526, and 20,264 sailing-vessels with 2,512,447 tons, which  make up the amount of 16,993,973 tons, as shown above.    In the year 1884 the experiment of freezing beef, killed in Buenos  Aires, and shipping it to Europe was first tried. That was successful,  but an immense improvement was made when the process of chilling became  the common means by which meat could be exported. The frozen beef trade  in Argentina has had a wonderful development; it commenced in 1884, and  the export of chilled meat has progressed steadily at the rate of 25,000  beeves yearly, until, in 1908, it reached the enormous quantity of  573,946 beeves, or 180,000 tons. Frozen mutton has remained  comparatively steady, and has only increased by 38,000 tons in  twenty-two years, or from 2,000,000 sheep frozen in 1886 to 3,297,667 in  1908, whilst \"jerked beef,\" which was mostly sent to Cuba and Brazil,  has fallen from 50,000 tons per annum to 6,651 tons. The value of frozen  and preserved meats exported in 1908 was L5,233,948.    The value of live-stock in Argentina in 1908 was made up as follows:--    Cattle  ... ... ... L82,000,000  Sheep   ... ... ...  25,000,000  Horses  ... ... ...  18,000,000  Mules   ... ... ...   2,000,000  Pigs    ... ... ...   1,368,000  Goats and Asses ...   1,000,000    A few years ago it was common on an estancia feeding 50,000 or 60,000  cattle to find the household using canned Swiss milk. To-day 425,000  litres of milk are brought into the city of Buenos Aires each day for  consumption, and no less than two tons of butter, one ton of cream, and  three tons of cheese are used there daily. Argentina also exports  butter. This trade has sprung up entirely within the last fourteen  years, and in 1908 she exported 3,549 tons of butter, the value of which  was L283,973.    Until 1876 Argentina imported wheat for home consumption; in that year,  when for many years past agricultural labourers had been arriving at an  average of 25,000 per annum, she began to export wheat with a modest  shipment of 5,000 tons. Thirty years later the export had mounted up to  2,247,988 tons, and in 1908 the wheat exported amounted to 3,636,293  tons, and was valued at L25,768,520. Agricultural colonies had sprung up  everywhere, and cattle became of second-rate importance; to-day the  value of the exports of corn, which term includes wheat, barley, maize,  oats, etc., is more than double that of cattle and cattle products.
