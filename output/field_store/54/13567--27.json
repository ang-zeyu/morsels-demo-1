If the stranger is in any way unsuitable in  habits or temperament, you inflict an annoyance on your friend instead  of a pleasure. In questions of introduction never oblige one friend to  the discomfort of another.    Those to whom letters of introduction have been given, should send  them to the person to whom they are addressed, and enclose a card.  Never deliver a letter of introduction in person. It places you in the  most undignified position imaginable, and compels you to wait while it  is being read, like a servant who has been told to wait for an answer.  There is also another reason why you should not be yourself the bearer  of your introduction; i.e., you compel the other person to receive  you, whether she chooses or not. It may be that she is sufficiently  ill-bred to take no notice of the letter when sent, and in such case,  if you presented yourself with it, she would most probably receive you  with rudeness. It is, at all events, more polite on your part to give  her the option, and, perhaps, more pleasant. If the receiver of the  letter be a really well-bred person, she will call upon you or leave  her card the next day, and you should return her attentions within the  week.    If, on the other hand, a stranger sends you a letter of introduction  and her card, you are bound by the laws of politeness and hospitality,  not only to call upon her the next day, but to follow up that  attention with others. If you are in a position to do so, the most  correct proceeding is to invite her to dine with you. Should this  not be within your power, you can probably escort her to some of the  exhibitions, bazaars, or concerts of the season; any of which would be  interesting to a foreigner or provincial visitor. In short, etiquette  demands that you shall exert yourself to show kindness to the  stranger, if only out of compliment to the friend who introduced her  to you.    If you invite her to dine with you, it is a better compliment to ask  some others to meet her than to dine with her _tete-a-tete_. You are  thereby giving her an opportunity of making other acquaintances, and  are assisting your friend in still farther promoting the purpose for  which she gave her the introduction to yourself.    Be careful at the same time only to ask such persons as she will feel  are at least her own social equals.    A letter of introduction should be given unsealed, not alone because  your friend may wish to know what you have said of her, but also as  a guarantee of your own good faith. As you should never give such  a letter unless you can speak highly of the bearer, this rule of  etiquette is easy to observe. By requesting your friend to fasten the  envelope before forwarding the letter to its destination, you tacitly  give her permission to inspect its contents.    Let your note-paper be of the best quality and the proper size. Albert  or Queen's size is the best for these purposes.    It has been well said that \"attention to the punctilios of politeness  is a proof at once of self-respect, and of respect for your friend.\"  Though irksome at first, these trifles soon cease to be matters for  memory, and become things of mere habit. To the thoroughly well-bred  they are a second nature. Let no one neglect them who is desirous of  pleasing in society; and, above all, let no one deem them unworthy of  attention. They are precisely the trifles which do most to make social  intercourse agreeable, and a knowledge of which distinguishes the  gentlewoman from the _parvenue_.           *       *       *       *       *    III.--VISITING.--MORNING CALLS.--CARDS.      A morning visit should be paid between the hours of two and four p.m.,  in winter, and two and five in summer. By observing this rule  you avoid intruding before the luncheon is removed, and leave in  sufficient time to allow the lady of the house an hour or two of  leisure for her dinner toilette.    Be careful always to avoid luncheon hours when you pay morning  visits. Some ladies dine with their children at half-past one, and are  consequently unprepared for the early reception of visitors. When you  have once ascertained this to be the case, be careful never again to  intrude at the same hour.    A good memory for these trifles is one of the hall-marks of good  breeding.    Visits of ceremony should be short. If even the conversation  should have become animated, beware of letting your call exceed  half-an-hour's length. It is always better to let your friends regret  than desire your withdrawal.    On returning visits of ceremony you may, without impoliteness, leave  your card at the door without going in. Do not fail, however, to  inquire if the family be well.    Should there be daughters or sisters residing with the lady upon whom  you call, you may turn down a corner of your card, to signify that the  visit is paid to all. It is in better taste, however, to leave cards  for each.    Unless when returning thanks for \"kind inquiries,\" or announcing your  arrival in, or departure from, town, it is not considered respectful  to send round cards by a servant.    Leave-taking cards have P.P.C. (_pour prendre conge_) written in the  corner. Some use P.D.A. (_pour dire adieu_).    It is not the fashion on the Continent for unmarried ladies to affix  any equivalent to the English \"Miss\" to their visiting cards. _Emilie  Dubois_, or _Kaetchen Clauss_, is thought more simple and elegant than  if preceded by _Mademoiselle_ or _Frauelein_. Some English girls have  of late adopted this good custom, and it would be well if it became  general.    Autographic facsimiles for visiting cards are affectations in any  persons but those who are personally remarkable for talent, and whose  autographs, or facsimiles of them, would be prized as curiosities.  A card bearing the autographic signature of Agnes Strickland or Mary  Somerville, though only a lithographic facsimile, would have a certain  interest; whereas the signature of Jane Smith would be not only  valueless; but would make the owner ridiculous.    Visits of condolence are paid within the week after the event which  occasions them. Personal visits of this kind are made by relations  and very intimate friends only. Acquaintances should leave cards with  narrow mourning borders.    On the first occasion when you are received by the family after the  death of one of its members, it is etiquette to wear slight mourning.    Umbrellas should invariably be left in the hall.    Never take favourite dogs into a drawing-room when you make a morning  call. Their feet may be dusty, or they may bark at the sight of  strangers, or, being of too friendly a disposition, may take the  liberty of lying on a lady's gown, or jumping on the sofas and easy  chairs. Where your friend has a favourite cat already established  before the fire, a battle may ensue, and one or other of the pets be  seriously hurt. Besides, many persons have a constitutional  antipathy to dogs, and others never allow their own to be seen in the  sitting-rooms. For all or any of these reasons, a visitor has no  right to inflict upon her friend the society of her dog as well as of  herself. Neither is it well for a mother to take young children with  her when she pays morning visits; their presence, unless they are  unusually well trained, can only be productive of anxiety to both  yourself and your hostess. She, while striving to amuse them, or to  appear interested in them, is secretly anxious for the fate of  her album, or the ornaments on her _etagere_; while the mother is  trembling lest her children should say or do something objectionable.    If other visitors are announced, and you have already remained as long  as courtesy requires, wait till they are seated, and then rise from  your chair, take leave of your hostess, and bow politely to the newly  arrived guests. You will, perhaps, be urged to remain, but, having  once risen, it is best to go. There is always a certain air of  _gaucherie_ in resuming your seat and repeating the ceremony of  leave-taking.    If you have occasion to look at your watch during a call, ask  permission to do so, and apologise for it on the plea of other  appointments.    In receiving morning visitors, it is not necessary that the lady  should lay aside the employment in which she may be engaged,  particularly if it consists of light or ornamental needle-work.  Politeness, however, requires that music, drawing, or any occupation  which would completely engross the attention, be at once abandoned.    You need not advance to receive visitors when announced, unless  they are persons to whom you are desirous of testifying particular  attention. It is sufficient if a lady rises to receive her visitors,  moves forward a single step to shake hands with them, and remains  standing till they are seated.    When your visitors rise to take leave you should rise also, and remain  standing till they have quite left the room. Do not accompany them to  the door, but be careful to ring in good time, that the servant may be  ready in the hall to let them out.    A lady should dress well, but not too richly, when she pays a morning  visit. If she has a carriage at command, she may dress more elegantly  than if she were on foot. The question of morning and afternoon dress  will be found fully treated in Section VII.           *       *       *       *       *    IV.--CONVERSATION.      There is no conversation so graceful, so varied, so sparkling, as that  of an intellectual and cultivated woman. Excellence in this particular  is, indeed, one of the attributes of the sex, and should be cultivated  by every gentlewoman who aspires to please in general society.    In order to talk well, three conditions are indisputable,  namely--tact, a good memory, and a fair education.

Among the evils, corrected or subdued, either by the general influence of  Christianity on the minds of men, or by particular associations of  Christians, the African[A] Slave-trade appears to me to have occupied the  foremost place. The abolition of it, therefore, of which it has devolved  upon me to write the history, should be accounted as one of the greatest  blessings, and, as such, should be one of the most copious sources of our  joy. Indeed I know of no evil, the removal of which should excite in us a  higher degree of pleasure. For in considerations of this kind, are we not  usually influenced by circumstances? Are not our feelings usually affected  according to the situation, or the magnitude, or the importance of these?  Are they not more or less elevated as the evil under our contemplation has  been more or less productive of misery, or more or less productive of  guilt? Are they not more or less elevated, again, as we have found it more  or less considerable in extent? Our sensations will undoubtedly be in  proportion to such circumstances, or our joy to the appretiation or  mensuration of the evil which has been removed.    [Footnote A: Slavery had been before annihilated by Christianity, I mean in  the West of Europe, at the close of the twelfth century.]    To value the blessing of the abolition as we ought, or to appretiate the  joy and gratitude which we ought to feel concerning it, we must enter a  little into the circumstances of the trade. Our statement, however, of  these needs not be long. A few pages will do all that is necessary! A  glance only into such a subject as this will be sufficient to affect the  heart--to arouse our indignation and our pity,--and to teach us the  importance of the victory obtained.    The first subject for consideration, towards enabling us to make the  estimate in question, will be that of the nature of the evil belonging to  the Slave-trade. This may be seen by examining it in three points of  view:--First, As it has been proved to arise on the continent of Africa in  the course of reducing the inhabitants of it to slavery;--Secondly, in the  course of conveying them from thence to the lands or colonies of other  nations;--And Thirdly, In continuing them there as slaves.    To see it as it has been shown to arise in the first case, let us suppose  ourselves on the Continent just mentioned. Well then--We are landed--We are  already upon our travels--We have just passed through one forest--We are  now come to a more open place, which indicates an approach to habitation.  And what object is that, which first obtrudes itself upon our sight? Who is  that wretched woman, whom we discover under that noble tree, wringing her  hands, and beating her breast, as if in the agonies of despair? Three days  has she been there at intervals to look and to watch, and this is the  fourth morning, and no tidings of her children yet. Beneath its spreading  boughs they were accustomed to play--But alas! the savage man-stealer  interrupted their playful mirth, and has taken them for ever from her  sight.    But let us leave the cries of this unfortunate woman, and hasten into  another district:--And what do we first see here? Who is he, that just now  started across the narrow pathway, as if afraid of a human face? What is  that sudden rustling among the leaves? Why are those persons flying from  our approach, and hiding themselves in yon darkest thicket? Behold, as we  get into the plain, a deserted village! The rice-field has been just  trodden down around it. An aged man, venerable by his silver beard, lies  wounded and dying near the threshold of his hut. War, suddenly instigated  by avarice, has just visited the dwellings which we see. The old have been  butchered, because unfit for slavery, and the young have been carried off,  except such as have fallen in the conflict, or have escaped among the woods  behind us.    But let us hasten from this cruel scene, which gives rise to so many  melancholy reflections. Let us cross yon distant river, and enter into some  new domain. But are we relieved even here from afflicting spectacles? Look  at that immense crowd, which appears to be gathered in a ring. See the  accused innocent in the middle. The ordeal of poisonous water has been  administered to him, as a test of his innocence or his guilt. He begins to  be sick, and pale. Alas! yon mournful shriek of his relatives confirms that  the loss of his freedom is now sealed.    And whither shall we go now? The night is approaching fast. Let us find  some friendly hut, where sleep may make us forget for a while the sorrows  of the day. Behold a hospitable native ready to receive us at his door! Let  us avail ourselves of his kindness. And now let us give ourselves to  repose. But why, when our eyelids are but just closed, do we find ourselves  thus suddenly awakened? What is the meaning of the noise around us, of the  trampling of people's feet, of the rustling of the bow, the quiver, and the  lance? Let us rise up and inquire. Behold! the inhabitants are all alarmed!  A wakeful woman has shown them yon distant column of smoke and blaze. The  neighbouring village is on fire. The prince, unfaithful to the sacred duty  of the protection of his subjects, has surrounded them. He is now burning  their habitations, and seizing, as saleable booty, the fugitives from the  flames.    Such then are some of the scenes that have been passing in Africa in  consequence of the existence of the Slave-trade; or such is the nature of  the evil, as it has shown itself in the first of the cases we have noticed.  Let us now estimate it as it has been proved to exist in the second; or let  us examine the state of the unhappy Africans, reduced to slavery in this  manner, while on board the vessels, which are to convey them across the  ocean to other lands. And here I must observe at once, that, as far as this  part of the evil is concerned, I am at a loss to describe it. Where shall I  find words to express properly their sorrow, as arising from the reflection  of being parted for ever from their friends, their relatives, and their  country? Where shall I find language to paint in appropriate colours the  horror of mind brought on by thoughts of their future unknown destination,  of which they can augur nothing but misery from all that they have yet  seen? How shall I make known their situation, while labouring under painful  disease, or while struggling in the suffocating holds of their prisons,  like animals inclosed in an exhausted receiver? How shall I describe their  feelings, as exposed to all the personal indignities, which lawless  appetite or brutal passion may suggest? How shall I exhibit their  sufferings as determining to refuse sustenance and die, or as resolving to  break their chains, and, disdaining to live as slaves, to punish their  oppressors? How shall I give an idea of their agony, when under various  punishments and tortures for their reputed crimes? Indeed every part of  this subject defies my powers, and I must therefore satisfy myself and the  reader with a general representation, or in the words of a celebrated  member of Parliament, that \"Never was so much human suffering condensed in  so small a space.\"    I come now to the evil, as it has been proved to arise in the third case;  or to consider the situation of the unhappy victims of the trade, when  their painful voyages are over, or after they have been landed upon their  destined shores. And here we are to view them first under the degrading  light of cattle. We are to see them examined, handled, selected, separated,  and sold. Alas! relatives are separated from relatives, as if, like cattle,  they had no rational intellect, no power of feeling the nearness of  relationship, nor sense of the duties belonging to the ties of life! We are  next to see them labouring, and this for the benefit of those, to whom they  are under no obligation, by any law either natural or divine, to obey. We  are to see them, if refusing the commands of their purchasers, however  weary, or feeble, or indisposed, subject to corporal punishments, and, if  forcibly resisting them, to death. We are to see them in a state of general  degradation and misery. The knowledge, which their oppressors have of their  own crime in having violated the rights of nature, and of the disposition  of the injured to seek all opportunities of revenge, produces a fear, which  dictates to them the necessity of a system of treatment by which they shall  keep up a wide distinction between the two, and by which the noble feelings  of the latter shall be kept down, and their spirits broken. We are to see  them again subject to individual persecution, as anger, or malice, or any  bad passion may suggest. Hence the whip--the chain--the iron-collar. Hence  the various modes of private torture, of which so many accounts have been  truly given. Nor can such horrible cruelties be discovered so as to be made  punishable, while the testimony of any number of the oppressed is invalid  against the oppressors, however they may be offences against the laws. And,  lastly, we are to see their innocent offspring, against whose personal  liberty the shadow of an argument cannot be advanced, inheriting all the  miseries of their parents' lot.    The evil then, as far as it has been hitherto viewed, presents to us in its  three several departments a measure of human suffering not to be  equalled--not to be calculated--not to be described. But would that we  could consider this part of the subject as dismissed! Would that in each of  the departments now examined there was no counterpart left us to  contemplate! But this cannot be. For if there be persons, who suffer  unjustly, there must be others, who oppress. And if there be those who"]]]
