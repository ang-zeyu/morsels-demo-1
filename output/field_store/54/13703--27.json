For everything becomes more clear by comparison We can never  understand the nature of a phenomenon when we contemplate it by itself, as  well as when we look at it in its relations to other phenomena of the same  kind. The qualities of each become more clear in contrast with those of  the others. By comparing together, therefore, the religions of mankind,  to see wherein they agree and wherein they differ, we are able to perceive  with greater accuracy what each is. The first problem in Comparative  Theology is therefore analytical, being to distinguish each religion from  the rest. We compare them to see wherein they agree and wherein they  differ. But the next problem in Comparative Theology is synthetical, and  considers the adaptation of each system to every other, to determine its  place, use, and value, in reference to universal or absolute religion. It  must, therefore, examine the different religions to find wherein each is  complete or defective, true or false; how each may supply the defects of  the other or prepare the way for a better; how each religion acts on the  race which receives it, is adapted to that race, and to the region of the  earth which it inhabits. In this department, therefore, it connects itself  with Comparative Geography, with universal history, and with ethics.  Finally, this department of Comparative Theology shows the relation of  each partial religion to human civilization, and observes how each  religion of the world is a step in the progress of humanity. It shows that  both the positive and negative side of a religion make it a preparation  for a higher religion, and that the universal religion must root itself in  the decaying soil of partial religions. And in this sense Comparative  Theology becomes the science of missions.    Such a work as this is evidently too great for a single mind. Many  students must co-operate, and that through many years, before it can be  completed. This volume is intended as a contribution toward that end. It  will contain an account of each of the principal religions, and its  development. It will be, therefore, devoted to the natural history of  ethnic and catholic religions, and its method will be that of analysis.  The second part, which may be published hereafter, will compare these  different systems to show what each teaches concerning the great subjects  of religious thought,--God, Duty, and Immortality. Finally, it will  compare them with Christianity, and will inquire whether or not that is  capable of becoming the religion of the human race.        Sec. 2. Comparative Theology; its Nature, Value, and present Position.      The work of Comparative Theology is to do equal justice to all the  religious tendencies of mankind. Its position is that of a judge, not that  of an advocate. Assuming, with the Apostle Paul, that each religion has  come providentially, as a method by which different races \"should seek the  Lord, if haply they might feel after him and find him,\" it attempts to  show how each may be a step in the religious progress of the races, and \"a  schoolmaster to bring men to Christ.\" It is bound, however, to abstain  from such inferences until it has accurately ascertained all the facts.  Its first problem is to learn what each system contains; it may then go  on, and endeavor to generalize from its facts.    Comparative Theology is, therefore, as yet in its infancy. The same  tendency in this century, which has produced the sciences of Comparative  Anatomy, Comparative Geography, and Comparative Philology, is now creating  this new science of Comparative Theology.[1] It will be to any special  theology as Comparative Anatomy is to any special anatomy, Comparative  Geography to any special geography, or Comparative Philology to the study  of any particular language. It may be called a science, since it consists  in the study of the facts of human history, and their relation to each  other. It does not dogmatize: it observes. It deals only with  phenomena,--single phenomena, or facts; grouped phenomena, or laws.    Several valuable works, bearing more or less directly on Comparative  Theology, have recently appeared in Germany, France, and England. Among  these may be mentioned those of Max Mueller, Bunsen, Burnouf, Doellinger,  Hardwicke, St. Hilaire, Duencker, F. C. Baur, Renan, Creuzer, Maurice, G.  W. Cox, and others.    In America, except Mr. Alger's admirable monograph on the \"Doctrine of the  Future Life,\" we have scarcely anything worthy of notice. Mrs. Lydia Maria  Child's work on the \"Progress of Religious Ideas\" deserves the greatest  credit, when we consider the time when it was written and the few sources  of information then accessible.[2] Twenty-five years ago it was hardly  possible to procure any adequate information concerning Brahmanism,  Buddhism, or the religions of Confucius, Zoroaster, and Mohammed. Hardly  any part of the Vedas had been translated into a European language. The  works of Anquetil du Perron and Kleuker were still the highest authority  upon the Zendavesta. About the Buddhists scarcely anything was known. But  now, though many important _lacunae_ remain to be filled, we have ample  means of ascertaining the essential facts concerning most of these  movements of the human soul. The time seems to have come to accomplish  something which may have a lasting value.        Sec. 3. Ethnic Religions. Injustice often done to them by Christian  Apologists.      Comparative Theology, pursuing its impartial course as a positive science,  will avoid the error into which most of the Christian apologists of the  last century fell, in speaking of ethnic or heathen religions. In order to  show the need of Christianity, they thought it necessary to disparage all  other religions. Accordingly they have insisted that, while the Jewish and  Christian religions were revealed, all other religions were invented;  that, while these were from God, those were the work of man; that, while  in the true religions there was nothing false, in the false religions  there was nothing true. If any trace of truth was to be found in  Polytheism, it was so mixed with error as to be practically only evil. As  the doctrines of heathen religions were corrupt, so their worship was only  a debasing superstition. Their influence was to make men worse, not  better; their tendency was to produce sensuality, cruelty, and universal  degradation. They did not proceed, in any sense, from God; they were not  even the work of good men, but rather of deliberate imposition and  priestcraft. A supernatural religion had become necessary in order to  counteract the fatal consequences of these debased and debasing  superstitions. This is the view of the great natural religions of the  world which was taken by such writers as Leland, Whitby, and Warburton in  the last century. Even liberal thinkers, like James Foster[3] and John  Locke,[4] declare that, at the coming of Christ, mankind had fallen into  utter darkness, and that vice and superstition filled the world. Infidel  no less than Christian writers took the same disparaging view of natural  religions. They considered them, in their source, the work of fraud; in  their essence, corrupt superstitions; in their doctrines, wholly false; in  their moral tendency, absolutely injurious; and in their result,  degenerating more and more into greater evil.    A few writers, like Cudworth and the Platonists, endeavored to put in a  good word for the Greek philosophers, but the religions of the world were  abandoned to unmitigated reprobation. The account which so candid a writer  as Mosheim gives of them is worth noticing, on account of its sweeping  character. \"All the nations of the world,\" he says, \"except the Jews, were  plunged in the grossest superstition. Some nations, indeed, went beyond  others in impiety and absurdity, but all stood charged with irrationality  and gross stupidity in matters of religion.\" \"The greater part of the gods  of all nations were ancient heroes, famous for their achievements and  their worthy deeds, such as kings, generals, and founders of cities.\" \"To  these some added the more splendid and useful objects in the natural  world, as the sun, moon, and stars; and some were not ashamed to pay  divine honors to mountains, rivers, trees, etc.\" \"The worship of these  deities consisted in ceremonies, sacrifices, and prayers. The ceremonies  were, for the most part, absurd and ridiculous, and throughout debasing,  obscene, and cruel. The prayers were truly insipid and void of piety, both  in their form and matter.\" \"The priests who presided over this worship  basely abused their authority to impose on the people.\" \"The whole pagan  system had not the least efficacy to produce and cherish virtuous emotions  in the soul; because the gods and goddesses were patterns of vice, the  priests bad men, and the doctrines false.\"[5]    This view of heathen religions is probably much exaggerated. They must  contain more truth than error, and must have been, on the whole, useful to  mankind. We do not believe that they originated in human fraud, that their  essence is superstition, that there is more falsehood than truth in their  doctrines, that their moral tendency is mainly injurious, or that they  continually degenerate into greater evil. No doubt it may be justly  predicated of all these systems that they contain much which is false and  injurious to human virtue. But the following considerations may tend to  show that all the religions of the earth are providential, and that all  tend to benefit mankind.    To ascribe the vast phenomena of religion, in their variety and  complexity, to man as their author, and to suppose the whole a mere work  of human fraud, is not a satisfactory solution of the facts before us.  That priests, working on human ignorance or fear, should be able to build  up such a great mass of belief, sentiment, and action, is like the Hindoo  cosmogony,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1468"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II — Volume 1 (#2)"],[1,"      He takes the Title of King       His Reception at Bridgewater       Preparations of the Government to oppose him       His Design on Bristol       He relinquishes that Design       Skirmish at Philip's Norton; Despondence of Monmouth       He returns to Bridgewater; The Royal Army encamps at Sedgemoor       Battle of Sedgemoor       Pursuit of the Rebels       Military Executions; Flight of Monmouth       His Capture       His Letter to the King; He is carried to London       His Interview with the King       His Execution       His Memory cherished by the Common People       Cruelties of the Soldiers in the West; Kirke       Jeffreys sets out on the Western Circuit       Trial of Alice Lisle       The Bloody Assizes       Abraham Holmes       Christopher Battiseombe; The Hewlings       Punishment of Tutchin       Rebels Transported       Confiscation and Extortion       Rapacity of the Queen and her Ladies       Grey; Cochrane; Storey       Wade, Goodenough, and Ferguson       Jeffreys made Lord Chancellor       Trial and Execution of Cornish       Trials  and Executions of Fernley and Elizabeth Gaunt       Trial and Execution of Bateman       Persecution of the Protestant Dissenters            HISTORY OF ENGLAND.          CHAPTER I.    I PURPOSE to write the history of England from the accession of King  James the Second down to a time which is within the memory of men still  living. I shall recount the errors which, in a few months, alienated a  loyal gentry and priesthood from the House of Stuart. I shall trace the  course of that revolution which terminated the long struggle between our  sovereigns and their parliaments, and bound up together the rights of  the people and the title of the reigning dynasty. I shall relate how the  new settlement was, during many troubled years, successfully defended  against foreign and domestic enemies; how, under that settlement,  the authority of law and the security of property were found to be  compatible with a liberty of discussion and of individual action never  before known; how, from the auspicious union of order and freedom,  sprang a prosperity of which the annals of human affairs had furnished  no example; how our country, from a state of ignominious vassalage,  rapidly rose to the place of umpire among European powers; how her  opulence and her martial glory grew together; how, by wise and resolute  good faith, was gradually established a public credit fruitful of  marvels which to the statesmen of any former age would have seemed  incredible; how a gigantic commerce gave birth to a maritime power,  compared with which every other maritime power, ancient or modern, sinks  into insignificance; how Scotland, after ages of enmity, was at length  united to England, not merely by legal bonds, but by indissoluble ties  of interest and affection; how, in America, the British colonies rapidly  became far mightier and wealthier than the realms which Cortes and  Pizarro had added to the dominions of Charles the Fifth; how in Asia,  British adventurers founded an empire not less splendid and more durable  than that of Alexander.    Nor will it be less my duty faithfully to record disasters mingled with  triumphs, and great national crimes and follies far more humiliating  than any disaster. It will be seen that even what we justly account our  chief blessings were not without alloy. It will be seen that the system  which effectually secured our liberties against the encroachments of  kingly power gave birth to a new class of abuses from which absolute  monarchies are exempt. It will be seen that, in consequence partly  of unwise interference, and partly of unwise neglect, the increase of  wealth and the extension of trade produced, together with immense good,  some evils from which poor and rude societies are free. It will be seen  how, in two important dependencies of the crown, wrong was followed  by just retribution; how imprudence and obstinacy broke the ties which  bound the North American colonies to the parent state; how Ireland,  cursed by the domination of race over race, and of religion over  religion, remained indeed a member of the empire, but a withered  and distorted member, adding no strength to the body politic, and  reproachfully pointed at by all who feared or envied the greatness of  England.    Yet, unless I greatly deceive myself, the general effect of this  chequered narrative will be to excite thankfulness in all religious  minds, and hope in the breasts of all patriots. For the history of our  country during the last hundred and sixty years is eminently the history  of physical, of moral, and of intellectual improvement. Those who  compare the age on which their lot has fallen with a golden age which  exists only in their imagination may talk of degeneracy and decay: but  no man who is correctly informed as to the past will be disposed to take  a morose or desponding view of the present.    I should very imperfectly execute the task which I have undertaken if  I were merely to treat of battles and sieges, of the rise and fall  of administrations, of intrigues in the palace, and of debates in the  parliament. It will be my endeavour to relate the history of the people  as well as the history of the government, to trace the progress of  useful and ornamental arts, to describe the rise of religious sects  and the changes of literary taste, to portray the manners of successive  generations and not to pass by with neglect even the revolutions which  have taken place in dress, furniture, repasts, and public amusements. I  shall cheerfully bear the reproach of having descended below the dignity  of history, if I can succeed in placing before the English of the  nineteenth century a true picture of the life of their ancestors.    The events which I propose to relate form only a single act of a great  and eventful drama extending through ages, and must be very imperfectly  understood unless the plot of the preceding acts be well known. I shall  therefore introduce my narrative by a slight sketch of the history of  our country from the earliest times. I shall pass very rapidly over many  centuries: but I shall dwell at some length on the vicissitudes of that  contest which the administration of King James the Second brought to a  decisive crisis. [1]    Nothing in the early existence of Britain indicated the greatness which  she was destined to attain. Her inhabitants when first they became  known to the Tyrian mariners, were little superior to the natives of the  Sandwich Islands. She was subjugated by the Roman arms; but she  received only a faint tincture of Roman arts and letters. Of the western  provinces which obeyed the Caesars, she was the last that was conquered,  and the first that was flung away. No magnificent remains of Latin  porches and aqueducts are to be found in Britain. No writer of British  birth is reckoned among the masters of Latin poetry and eloquence. It is  not probable that the islanders were at any time generally familiar with  the tongue of their Italian rulers. From the Atlantic to the vicinity  of the Rhine the Latin has, during many centuries, been predominant. It  drove out the Celtic; it was not driven out by the Teutonic; and it is  at this day the basis of the French, Spanish and Portuguese languages.  In our island the Latin appears never to have superseded the old Gaelic  speech, and could not stand its ground against the German.    The scanty and superficial civilisation which the Britons had derived  from their southern masters was effaced by the calamities of the fifth  century. In the continental kingdoms into which the Roman empire was  then dissolved, the conquerors learned much from the conquered race. In  Britain the conquered race became as barbarous as the conquerors.    All the chiefs who founded Teutonic dynasties in the continental  provinces of the Roman empire, Alaric, Theodoric, Clovis, Alboin, were  zealous Christians. The followers of Ida and Cerdic, on the other hand,  brought to their settlements in Britain all the superstitions of the  Elbe. While the German princes who reigned at Paris, Toledo, Arles, and  Ravenna listened with reverence to the instructions of bishops, adored  the relics of martyrs, and took part eagerly in disputes touching the  Nicene theology, the rulers of Wessex and Mercia were still performing  savage rites in the temples of Thor and Woden.    The continental kingdoms which had risen on the ruins of the Western  Empire kept up some intercourse with those eastern provinces where the  ancient civilisation, though slowly fading away under the influence of  misgovernment, might still astonish and instruct barbarians, where the  court still exhibited the splendour of Diocletian and Constantine,  where the public buildings were still adorned with the sculptures of  Polycletus and the paintings of Apelles, and where laborious pedants,  themselves destitute of taste, sense, and spirit, could still read and  interpret the masterpieces of Sophocles, of Demosthenes, and of Plato.  From this communion Britain was cut off. Her shores were, to the  polished race which dwelt by the Bosphorus, objects of a mysterious  horror, such as that with which the Ionians of the age of Homer had  regarded the Straits of Scylla and the city of the Laestrygonian  cannibals. There was one province of our island in which, as Procopius  had been told, the ground was covered with serpents, and the air was  such that no man could inhale it and live. To this desolate region the  spirits of the departed were ferried over from the land of the Franks at  midnight. A strange race of fishermen performed the ghastly office. The  speech of the dead was distinctly heard by the boatmen, their weight  made the keel sink deep in the water; but their forms were invisible  to mortal eye. Such were the marvels which an able historian, the  contemporary of Belisarius, of Simplicius, and of Tribonian, gravely"]]]
