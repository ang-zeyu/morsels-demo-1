Shakespeare's fellow-actors, fellow-dramatists, and those who knew him  in other ways, agree in expressing not only admiration of his genius,  but their respect and love for the man. Ben Jonson said, \"I love the  man, and do honor his memory, on this side idolatry, as much as any. He  was indeed honest, and of an open and free nature.\" He was buried on  the second day after his death, on the north side of the chancel  of Stratford church.

Now, in Athens, where they lived, there was a wicked law, by which any  girl who refused to marry according to her father's wishes, might be put  to death. Hermia's father was so angry with her for refusing to do as  he wished, that he actually brought her before the Duke of Athens to  ask that she might be killed, if she still refused to obey him. The Duke  gave her four days to think about it, and, at the end of that time, if  she still refused to marry Demetrius, she would have to die.    Lysander of course was nearly mad with grief, and the best thing to  do seemed to him for Hermia to run away to his aunt's house at a place  beyond the reach of that cruel law; and there he would come to her and  marry her. But before she started, she told her friend, Helena, what she  was going to do.    Helena had been Demetrius' sweetheart long before his marriage with  Hermia had been thought of, and being very silly, like all jealous  people, she could not see that it was not poor Hermia's fault that  Demetrius wished to marry her instead of his own lady, Helena. She knew  that if she told Demetrius that Hermia was going, as she was, to the  wood outside Athens, he would follow her, \"and I can follow him, and  at least I shall see him,\" she said to herself. So she went to him, and  betrayed her friend's secret.    Now this wood where Lysander was to meet Hermia, and where the other two  had decided to follow them, was full of fairies, as most woods are, if  one only had the eyes to see them, and in this wood on this night were  the King and Queen of the fairies, Oberon and Titania. Now fairies  are very wise people, but now and then they can be quite as foolish as  mortal folk. Oberon and Titania, who might have been as happy as the  days were long, had thrown away all their joy in a foolish quarrel. They  never met without saying disagreeable things to each other, and scolded  each other so dreadfully that all their little fairy followers, for  fear, would creep into acorn cups and hide them there.    So, instead of keeping one happy Court and dancing all night through in  the moonlight as is fairies' use, the King with his attendants wandered  through one part of the wood, while the Queen with hers kept state in  another. And the cause of all this trouble was a little Indian boy whom  Titania had taken to be one of her followers. Oberon wanted the child to  follow him and be one of his fairy knights; but the Queen would not give  him up.

Professor Fournier of Vienna has most  kindly furnished me with details which seem to relegate to the domain  of legend the famous ice catastrophe at Austerlitz; and I have added a  note to this effect on p. 50 of vol. ii. On the other hand, I may  justly claim that the publication of Count Balmain's reports relating  to St. Helena has served to corroborate, in all important details, my  account of Napoleon's captivity.    It only remains to add that I much regret the omission of Mr. Oman's  name from II. 12-13 of page viii of the Preface, an omission rendered  all the more conspicuous by the appearance of the first volume of his  \"History of the Peninsular War\" in the spring of this year.

HELENA                        NOTE ON THE REPUBLICAN CALENDAR      The republican calendar consisted of twelve months of thirty days  each, each month being divided into three \"decades\" of ten days. Five  days (in leap years six) were added at the end of the year to bring it  into coincidence with the solar year.      An    I began Sept. 22, 1792.    \"    II  \"      \"       1793.    \"   III  \"      \"       1794.    \"    IV (leap year)     1795.           *       *       *       *       *      \"  VIII began Sept. 22, 1799.    \"    IX   \"   Sept. 23, 1800.    \"     X   \"      \"      1801.           *       *       *       *       *      \"   XIV   \"      \"      1805.    The new computation, though reckoned from Sept. 22, 1792, was not  introduced until Nov. 26, 1793 (An II). It ceased after Dec. 31, 1805.    The months are as follows:        Vendemiaire              Sept. 22 to Oct. 21.      Brumaire                 Oct. 22  \"  Nov. 20.      Frimaire                 Nov. 21  \"  Dec. 20.

Germinal                 Mar. 21  \"  April 19.      Floreal                  April 20 \"  May 19.      Prairial                 May 20   \"  June 18.

Add five (in leap years six) \"Sansculottides\" or \"Jours  complementaires.\"    In 1796 (leap year) the numbers in the table of months, so far as  concerns all dates between Feb. 28 and Sept. 22, will have to be  _reduced by one_, owing to the intercalation of Feb. 29, which is not  compensated for until the end of the republican year.    The matter is further complicated by the fact that the republicans  reckoned An VIII as a leap year, though it is not one in the Gregorian  Calendar. Hence that year ended on Sept. 22, and An IX and succeeding  years began on Sept. 23. Consequently in the above table of months the  numbers of all days from Vendemiaire 1, An IX (Sept. 23, 1800), to  Nivose 10, An XIV (Dec. 31, 1805), inclusive, will have to be  _increased by one_, except only in the next leap year between Ventose  9, An XII, and Vendemiaire 1, An XIII (Feb. 28-Sept, 23, 1804), when  the two Revolutionary aberrations happen to neutralize each other.           *       *       *       *       *            THE LIFE OF NAPOLEON I            CHAPTER I    PARENTAGE AND EARLY YEARS      \"I was born when my country was perishing. Thirty thousand French  vomited upon our coasts, drowning the throne of Liberty in waves of  blood, such was the sight which struck my eyes.\" This passionate  utterance, penned by Napoleon Buonaparte at the beginning of the  French Revolution, describes the state of Corsica in his natal year.  The words are instinct with the vehemence of the youth and the  extravagant sentiment of the age: they strike the keynote of his  career. His life was one of strain and stress from his cradle to his  grave.    In his temperament as in the circumstances of his time the young  Buonaparte was destined for an extraordinary career. Into a tottering  civilization he burst with all the masterful force of an Alaric. But  he was an Alaric of the south, uniting the untamed strength of his  island kindred with the mental powers of his Italian ancestry. In his  personality there is a complex blending of force and grace, of animal  passion and mental clearness, of northern common sense with the  promptings of an oriental imagination; and this union in his nature of  seeming opposites explains many of the mysteries of his life.  Fortunately for lovers of romance, genius cannot be wholly analyzed,  even by the most adroit historical philosophizer or the most exacting  champion of heredity. But in so far as the sources of Napoleon's power  can be measured, they may be traced to the unexampled needs of mankind  in the revolutionary epoch and to his own exceptional endowments.  Evidently, then, the characteristics of his family claim some  attention from all who would understand the man and the influence  which he was to wield over modern Europe.    It has been the fortune of his House to be the subject of dispute from  first to last. Some writers have endeavoured to trace its descent back  to the Caesars of Rome, others to the Byzantine Emperors; one  genealogical explorer has tracked the family to Majorca, and, altering  its name to Bonpart, has discovered its progenitor in the Man of the  Iron Mask; while the Duchesse d'Abrantes, voyaging eastwards in quest  of its ancestors, has confidently claimed for the family a Greek  origin. Painstaking research has dispelled these romancings of  historical _trouveurs_, and has connected this enigmatic stock with a  Florentine named \"William, who in the year 1261 took the surname of  _Bonaparte_ or _Buonaparte_. The name seems to have been assumed when,  amidst the unceasing strifes between Guelfs and Ghibellines that rent  the civic life of Florence, William's party, the Ghibellines, for a  brief space gained the ascendancy. But perpetuity was not to be found  in Florentine politics; and in a short time he was a fugitive at a  Tuscan village, Sarzana, beyond the reach of the victorious Guelfs.  Here the family seems to have lived for well nigh three centuries,  maintaining its Ghibelline and aristocratic principles with surprising  tenacity. The age was not remarkable for the virtue of constancy, or  any other virtue. Politics and private life were alike demoralized by  unceasing intrigues; and amidst strifes of Pope and Emperor, duchies  and republics, cities and autocrats, there was formed that type of  Italian character which is delineated in the pages of Macchiavelli.  From the depths of debasement of that cynical age the Buonapartes  were saved by their poverty, and by the isolation of their life at  Sarzana. Yet the embassies discharged at intervals by the more  talented members of the family showed that the gifts for intrigue were  only dormant; and they were certainly transmitted in their intensity  to the greatest scion of the race.
