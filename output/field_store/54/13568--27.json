These studies aim to combine both methods  of interpretation.    Briefly defined the chief objects of these studies are:    (1) To introduce the men and women of to-day to that which is most  vital in the literature and thought of the Old Testament.    (2) To interpret the often neglected Old Testament into the  language of modern life simply and directly and in the light of  that which is highest in the teachings of Christianity.    (3) To present the constructive results of the modern historical  and literary study of the Bible, not dogmatically but tentatively,  so that the reader and student may be in a position to judge for  himself regarding the conclusions that are held by a large number  of Biblical scholars and to estimate their practical religious  value.    (4) To show how closely the Old Testament is related to the life of  to-day and how it helps to answer the pressing questions now  confronting the nations.    (5) To lead strong men to think through our national, social and  individual problems, and to utilize fearlessly and practically the  constructive results of modern method and research in the fields of  both science and religion.        THE PLAN OF WORK.    These studies are planned to meet the needs of college students and  adult Bible classes.  Those who are able to command more time and  wish to do more thorough work will find in the list of _Parallel  Readings_ on the first page of each study carefully selected  references to the best authorities on the subject treated.  For  their guidance are also provided _Subjects for Further Study_.  In  using this text-book the student may proceed as follows:    (1) Read carefully the Biblical passage indicated in connection  with each title; for example, in the first study, Genesis 1 and 2.    (2) Read the Biblical and other quotations on the first page of  each study.  Unless otherwise indicated the Biblical quotations are  from the American Revised Version.  They include the most important  Biblical passages.  The other quotations embody some of the best  contributions of ancient and modern writers to the subject under  consideration.    (3) Read and think through the material presented under each  paragraph.  This material is arranged under six headings for the  convenience of those who wish to follow the plan of daily reading  and study.        BOOKS OF REFERENCE.

Kent, _Historical Bible_, Vol. I, pp. 1-7, 231-3.    Articles, \"Evolution\" and \"Cosmogony,\" in _Ency. Brit_. or _Inter.      Ency_., or any standard encyclopedia.    God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he  him, male and female created he them.  And God blessed them, and  God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the  earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea,  and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that  moveth upon the earth.--_Gen. 1:27, 28_.     When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers,   The moon and the stars which thou hast ordained;   What is man, that thou art mindful of him?   And the son of man that thou visitest him?   For thou hast made him but little lower than God,   And crownest him with glory and honor.   Thou makest him to have dominion over the works of thine hands,   Thou hast put all things under his feet.--_Ps. 8: 8-6_.     God clothed men with strength like his own,   And made them according to his own image.   He put the fear of them upon all flesh,   That they should have dominion over beasts and birds.   Mouth and tongue, eyes and ears,   And a mind with which to think he gave them;   With insight and wisdom he filled their minds,   Good and evil he taught them.  Ben Sira. 17, 3-7 (_Hist. Bible_).    All things were made through him; and without him was not any thing  made that hath been made.--John 1:3.      I.    DIFFERENT THEORIES OF CREATION.    Every early people naturally asked the questions, How were things  made?  How were men created?  First of all, Who made the world?  They necessarily answered them according to their own dawning  knowledge.    The most primitive races believed that some great animal created  the earth and man.  In the Alaskan collection in the museum of the  University of Pennsylvania there is a huge crow, sitting upon the  mask of a man's face.  This symbolizes the crude belief of the  Alaskan Indians regarding the way man was created.  The early  Egyptians thought that the earth and man were hatched out of an  egg.  In one part of Egypt it was held that the artisan god Ptah  broke the egg with his hammer.  In another part of the land and  probably at a later date the tradition was current that Thoth the  moon god spoke the world into existence.  The earliest Babylonian  record states that:      The god Marduk laid a reed on the face of the waters,    He formed dust and poured it out beside the reed;    That he might cause the gods to dwell in the dwellings      of their heart's desire,    He formed mankind.    Later he formed the grass and the rush of the marsh and the forest.  Then he created the animals and their young.    The Parsee teachers held that the rival gods, Ahriman and Ormuzd,  evolved themselves out of primordial matter and then through the  long ages created their attendant hierarchies of angels.  The  philosophers of India anticipated in some respects our modern  evolutionary theory.  Brahma is thought of as self-existent and  eternal.  He gradually condenses himself into material objects,  such as ether, fire, water, earth and the elements.  Last of all he  manifests himself in man.  The Greek philosophers were the first to  attempt to describe creation as a purely physical, generative  process.  They taught the evolution of the more complex from the  simpler forms.  Plato and Aristotle believed in a transcendental  deity and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12436"],[0,"The Night Horseman (#2)"],[1,"murmured. \"The mind?\"    \"Yes.\"    He rubbed his bloodless hands slowly together, and when he spoke his  voice was sharp and quick and wholly impersonal. \"Tell me the symptoms!\"    \"Can't we talk those over on the way to the ranch? Even if we start now  it will be dark before we arrive.\"    \"But,\" protested the doctor, \"I have not yet decided--this  precipitancy--\"    \"Oh,\" she said, and flushed. He perceived that she was on the verge of  turning away, but something withheld her. \"There is no other physician  within reach; my father is very ill. I only ask that you come as a  diagnostician, doctor!\"    \"But a ride to your ranch,\" he said miserably. \"I presume you refer to  riding a horse?\"    \"Naturally.\"    \"I am unfamiliar with that means of locomotion,\" said the doctor with  serious eyes, \"and in fact have not carried my acquaintance with the  equine species beyond a purely experimental stage. Anatomically I have a  superficial knowledge, but on the one occasion on which I sat in a  saddle I observed that the docility of the horse is probably a poetic  fallacy.\"    He rubbed his left shoulder thoughtfully and saw a slight tremor at the  corners of the girl's mouth. It caused his vision to clear and  concentrate; he found that the lips were, in fact, in the very act of  smiling. The face of the doctor brightened.    \"You shall ride my own horse,\" said the girl. \"She is perfectly gentle  and has a very easy gait. I'm sure you'll have not the slightest trouble  with her.\"    \"And you?\"    \"I'll find something about town; it doesn't matter what.\"    \"This,\" said the doctor, \"is most remarkable. You choose your mounts at  random?\"    \"But you will go?\" she insisted.    \"Ah, yes, the trip to the ranch!\" groaned the doctor. \"Let me see: the  physical obstacles to such a trip while many are not altogether  insuperable, I may say; in the meantime the moral urge which compels me  towards the ranch seems to be of the first order.\" He sighed. \"Is it not  strange, Miss Cumberland, that man, though distinguished from the lower  orders by mind, so often is controlled in his actions by ethical  impulses which override the considerations of reason? An observation  which leads us towards the conclusion that the passion for goodness is a  principle hardly secondary to the passion for truth. Understand that I  build the hypothesis only tentatively, with many reservations, among  which--\"    He broke off short. The smile was growing upon her lips.    \"I will put together a few of my things,\" said the doctor, \"and come  down to you at once.\"    \"Good!\" said the girl, \"I'll be waiting for you with two horses before  you are ready.\"    He turned away, but had taken hardly a step before he turned, saying:  \"But why are you so sure that you will be ready before I--\" but she was  already down the steps from the veranda and stepping briskly down the  street.    \"There is an element of the unexplainable in woman,\" said the doctor,  and resumed his way to his room. Once there, something prompted him to  act with the greatest possible speed. He tossed his toilet articles and  a few changes of linen into a small, flexible valise and ran down the  stairs. He reached the veranda again, panting, and the girl was not in  sight; a smile of triumph appeared on the grave, colourless lips of the  doctor. \"Feminine instinct, however, is not infallible,\" he observed to  himself, and to one of the cowboys, lounging loosely in a chair nearby,  he continued his train of thoughts aloud: \"Though the verity of the  feminine intuition has already been thrown in a shade of doubt by many  thinkers, as you will undoubtedly agree.\"    The man thus addressed allowed his lower jaw to drop but after a moment  he ejaculated: \"Now what in hell d'you mean by that?\"    The doctor already turned away, intent upon his thoughts, but he now  paused and again faced the cowboy. He said, frowning: \"There is  unnecessary violence in your remark, sir.\"    \"Duck your glasses,\" said the worthy in question. \"You ain't talkin' to  a book, you're talking to a man.\"    \"And in your attitude,\" went on the doctor, \"there is an element of  offense which if carried farther might be corrected by physical  violence.\"    \"I don't foller your words,\" said the cattleman, \"but from the drift of  your tune I gather you're a bit peeved; and if you are--\"    His voice had risen to a ringing note as he proceeded and he now slipped  from his chair and faced Randall Byrne, a big man, brown, hard-handed.  The doctor crimsoned.    \"Well?\" he echoed, but in place of a deep ring his words were pitched in  a high squeak of defiance.    He saw a large hand contract to a fist, but almost instantly the big man  grinned, and his eyes went past Byrne.    \"Oh, hell!\" he grunted, and turned his back with a chuckle.    For an instant there was a mad impulse in the doctor to spring at this  fellow but a wave of impotence overwhelmed him. He knew that he was  white around the mouth, and there was a dryness in his throat.    \"The excitement of imminent physical contest and personal danger,\" he  diagnosed swiftly, \"causing acceleration of the pulse and attendant  weakness of the body--a state unworthy of the balanced intellect.\"    Having brought back his poise by this quick interposition of reason, he  went his way down the long veranda. Against a pillar leaned another tall  cattleman, also brown and lean and hard.    \"May I inquire,\" he said, \"if you have any information direct or casual  concerning a family named Cumberland which possesses ranch property in  this vicinity?\"    \"You may,\" said the cowpuncher, and continued to roll his cigarette.    \"Well,\" said the doctor, \"do you know anything about them?\"    \"Sure,\" said the other, and having finished his cigarette he introduced  it between his lips. It seemed to occur to him instantly, however, that  he was committing an inhospitable breach, for he produced his Durham and  brown papers with a start and extended them towards the doctor.    \"Smoke?\" he asked.    \"I use tobacco in no form,\" said the doctor.    The cowboy stared with such fixity that the match burned down to his  fingertips and singed them before he had lighted his cigarette.    \"'S that a fact?\" he queried when his astonishment found utterance.  \"What d'you do to kill time? Well, I been thinking about knocking off  the stuff for a while. Mame gets sore at me for having my fingers all  stained up with nicotine like this.\"    He extended his hand, the first and second fingers of which were  painted a bright yellow.    \"Soap won't take it off,\" he remarked.    \"A popular but inexcusable error,\" said the doctor. \"It is the tarry  by-products of tobacco which cause that stain. Nicotine itself, of  course, is a volatile alkaloid base of which there is only the merest  trace in tobacco. It is one of the deadliest of nerve poisons and is  quite colourless. There is enough of that stain upon your fingers--if it  were nicotine--to kill a dozen men.\"    \"The hell you say!\"    \"Nevertheless, it is an indubitable fact. A lump of nicotine the size of  the head of a pin placed on the tongue of a horse will kill the beast  instantly.\"    The cowpuncher pushed back his hat and scratched his head.    \"This is worth knowin',\" he said, \"but I'm some glad that Mame ain't  heard it.\"    \"Concerning the Cumberlands,\" said the doctor, \"I--\"    \"Concerning the Cumberlands,\" repeated the cattleman, \"it's best to  leave 'em to their own concerns.\" And he started to turn away, but the  thirst for knowledge was dry in the throat of the doctor.    \"Do I understand,\" he insisted, \"that there is some mystery connected  with them?\"    \"From me,\" replied the other, \"you understand nothin'.\" And he lumbered  down the steps and away.    Be it understood that there was nothing of the gossip in Randall Byrne,  but now he was pardonably excited and perceiving the tall form of Hank  Dwight in the doorway he approached his host.    \"Mr. Dwight,\" he said, \"I am about to go to the Cumberland ranch. I  gather that there is something of an unusual nature concerning them.\"    \"There is,\" admitted Hank Dwight.    \"Can you tell me what it is?\"    \"I can.\"    \"Good!\" said the doctor, and he almost smiled. \"It is always well to  know the background of a case which has to do with mental states. Now,  just what do you know?\"    \"I know--\" began the proprietor, and then paused and eyed his guest  dubiously. \"I know,\" he continued, \"a story.\"    \"Yes?\"    \"Yes, about a man and a hoss and a dog.\"    \"The approach seems not quite obvious, but I shall be glad to hear it.\"    There was a pause.    \"Words,\" said the host, at length, \"is worse'n bullets. You never know  what they'll hit.\"    \"But the story?\" persisted Randall Byrne.    \"That story,\" said Hank Dwight, \"I may tell to my son before I die.\"    \"This sounds quite promising.\"    \"But I'll tell nobody else.\"    \"Really!\"    \"It's about a man and a hoss and a dog. The man ain't possible, the  hoss ain't possible, the dog is a wolf.\"    He paused again and glowered on the doctor. He seemed to be drawn two  ways, by his eagerness to tell a yarn and his dread of consequences.    \"I know,\" he muttered, \"because I've seen 'em all. I've seen\"--he looked  far, as though striking a silent bargain with himself concerning the sum  of the story which might safely be told--\"I've seen a hoss that  understood a man's talk like you and me does--or better. I've heard a  man whistle like a singing bird. Yep, that ain't no lie. You jest  imagine a bald eagle that could lick anything between the earth and the  sky and was able to sing--that's what that whistlin' was like. It made  you glad to hear it, and it made you look to see if your gun was in good  workin' shape. It wasn't very loud, but it travelled pretty far, like it  was comin' from up above you.\"    \"That's the way this strange man of the story whistles?\" asked Byrne,  leaning closer.    \"Man of the story?\" echoed the proprietor, with some warmth. \""]]]
