[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1401"],[0,"Tarzan the Untamed (#2)"],[1,"  more swiftly than before, for he was goaded now by a nameless fear,  more product of intuition than of reason.  Even as the beasts,  Tarzan of the Apes seemed to possess a sixth sense. Long before he  reached the bungalow, he had almost pictured the scene that finally  broke upon his view.    Silent and deserted was the vine-covered cottage. Smoldering embers  marked the site of his great barns. Gone were the thatched huts of  his sturdy retainers, empty the fields, the pastures, and corrals.  Here and there vultures rose and circled above the carcasses of  men and beasts.    It was with a feeling as nearly akin to terror as he ever had  experienced that the ape-man finally forced himself to enter his  home. The first sight that met his eyes set the red haze of hate  and bloodlust across his vision, for there, crucified against the  wall of the living-room, was Wasimbu, giant son of the faithful  Muviro and for over a year the personal bodyguard of Lady Jane.    The overturned and shattered furniture of the room, the brown pools  of dried blood upon the floor, and prints of bloody hands on walls  and woodwork evidenced something of the frightfulness of the battle  that had been waged within the narrow confines of the apartment.  Across the baby grand piano lay the corpse of another black warrior,  while before the door of Lady Jane's boudoir were the dead bodies  of three more of the faithful Greystoke servants.    The door of this room was closed. With drooping shoulders and dull  eyes Tarzan stood gazing dumbly at the insensate panel which hid  from him what horrid secret he dared not even guess.    Slowly, with leaden feet, he moved toward the door. Gropingly his  hand reached for the knob. Thus he stood for another long minute,  and then with a sudden gesture he straightened his giant frame,  threw back his mighty shoulders and, with fearless head held high,  swung back the door and stepped across the threshold into the  room which held for him the dearest memories and associations of  his life. No change of expression crossed his grim and stern-set  features as he strode across the room and stood beside the little  couch and the inanimate form which lay face downward upon it; the  still, silent thing that had pulsed with life and youth and love.    No tear dimmed the eye of the ape-man, but the God who made him alone  could know the thoughts that passed through that still half-savage  brain. For a long time he stood there just looking down upon the  dead body, charred beyond recognition, and then he stooped and lifted  it in his arms.  As he turned the body over and saw how horribly  death had been meted he plumbed, in that instant, the uttermost  depths of grief and horror and hatred.    Nor did he require the evidence of the broken German rifle in the  outer room, or the torn and blood-stained service cap upon the  floor, to tell him who had been the perpetrators of this horrid  and useless crime.    For a moment he had hoped against hope that the blackened corpse was  not that of his mate, but when his eyes discovered and recognized  the rings upon her fingers the last faint ray of hope forsook him.    In silence, in love, and in reverence he buried, in the little  rose garden that had been Jane Clayton's pride and love, the poor,  charred form and beside it the great black warriors who had given  their lives so futilely in their mistress' protection.    At one side of the house Tarzan found other newly made graves  and in these he sought final evidence of the identity of the real  perpetrators of the atrocities that had been committed there in  his absence.    Here he disinterred the bodies of a dozen German askaris and found  upon their uniforms the insignia of the company and regiment to  which they had belonged. This was enough for the ape-man. White  officers had commanded these men, nor would it be a difficult task  to discover who they were.    Returning to the rose garden, he stood among the Hun trampled  blooms and bushes above the grave of his dead--with bowed head he  stood there in a last mute farewell. As the sun sank slowly behind  the towering forests of the west, he turned slowly away upon the  still-distinct trail of Hauptmann Fritz Schneider and his blood-stained  company.    His was the suffering of the dumb brute--mute; but though voiceless  no less poignant. At first his vast sorrow numbed his other faculties  of thought--his brain was overwhelmed by the calamity to such an  extent that it reacted to but a single objective suggestion: She is  dead! She is dead! She is dead!  Again and again this phrase beat  monotonously upon his brain--a dull, throbbing pain, yet mechanically  his feet followed the trail of her slayer while, subconsciously,  his every sense was upon the alert for the ever-present perils of  the jungle.    Gradually the labor of his great grief brought forth another  emotion so real, so tangible, that it seemed a companion walking  at his side. It was Hate--and it brought to him a measure of solace  and of comfort, for it was a sublime hate that ennobled him as  it has ennobled countless thousands since--hatred for Germany and  Germans. It centered about the slayer of his mate, of course; but  it included everything German, animate or inanimate. As the thought  took firm hold upon him he paused and raising his face to Goro, the  moon, cursed with upraised hand the authors of the hideous crime  that had been perpetrated in that once peaceful bungalow behind  him; and he cursed their progenitors, their progeny, and all their  kind the while he took silent oath to war upon them relentlessly  until death overtook him.    There followed almost immediately a feeling of content, for, where  before his future at best seemed but a void, now it was filled  with possibilities the contemplation of which brought him, if not  happiness, at least a surcease of absolute grief, for before him  lay a great work that would occupy his time.    Stripped not only of all the outward symbols of civilization, Tarzan  had also reverted morally and mentally to the status of the savage  beast he had been reared. Never had his civilization been more than  a veneer put on for the sake of her he loved because he thought it  made her happier to see him thus. In reality he had always held the  outward evidences of so-called culture in deep contempt. Civilization  meant to Tarzan of the Apes a curtailment of freedom in all its  aspects--freedom of action, freedom of thought, freedom of love,  freedom of hate. Clothes he abhorred--uncomfortable, hideous,  confining things that reminded him somehow of bonds securing him to  the life he had seen the poor creatures of London and Paris living.  Clothes were the emblems of that hypocrisy for which civilization  stood--a pretense that the wearers were ashamed of what the clothes  covered, of the human form made in the semblance of God. Tarzan  knew how silly and pathetic the lower orders of animals appeared in  the clothing of civilization, for he had seen several poor creatures  thus appareled in various traveling shows in Europe, and he knew,  too, how silly and pathetic man appears in them since the only men  he had seen in the first twenty years of his life had been, like  himself, naked savages. The ape-man had a keen admiration for a  well-muscled, well-proportioned body, whether lion, or antelope,  or man, and it had ever been beyond him to understand how clothes  could be considered more beautiful than a clear, firm, healthy  skin, or coat and trousers more graceful than the gentle curves of  rounded muscles playing beneath a flexible hide.    In civilization Tarzan had found greed and selfishness and cruelty  far beyond that which he had known in his familiar, savage jungle,  and though civilization had given him his mate and several friends  whom he loved and admired, he never had come to accept it as you  and I who have known little or nothing else; so it was with a sense  of relief that he now definitely abandoned it and all that it stood  for, and went forth into the jungle once again stripped to his loin  cloth and weapons.    The hunting knife of his father hung at his left hip, his bow and  his quiver of arrows were slung across his shoulders, while around  his chest over one shoulder and beneath the opposite arm was coiled  the long grass rope without which Tarzan would have felt quite as  naked as would you should you be suddenly thrust upon a busy highway  clad only in a union suit. A heavy war spear which he sometimes  carried in one hand and again slung by a thong about his neck so  that it hung down his back completed his armament and his apparel.  The diamond-studded locket with the pictures of his mother and  father that he had worn always until he had given it as a token  of his highest devotion to Jane Clayton before their marriage was  missing. She always had worn it since, but it had not been upon  her body when he found her slain in her boudoir, so that now his  quest for vengeance included also a quest for the stolen trinket.    Toward midnight Tarzan commenced to feel the physical strain of  his long hours of travel and to realize that even muscles such as  his had their limitations. His pursuit of the murderers had not  been characterized by excessive speed; but rather more in keeping  with his mental attitude, which was marked by a dogged determination  to require from the Germans more than an eye for an eye and more  than a tooth for a tooth, the element of time entering but slightly  into his calculations.    Inwardly as well as outwardly Tarzan had reverted to beast and in  the lives of beasts, time, as a measurable aspect of duration, has  no meaning. The beast is actively interested only in NOW, and as  it is always NOW and always shall be, there is an eternity of time  for the accomplishment of objects. The ape-man, naturally, had a  slightly more comprehensive realization of the limitations of time;  but, like"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14012"],[0,"Ice-Caves of France and Switzerland (#2)"],[1,"of an old convent and its  drained fish-pond, and up the various rocky ridges of hill, with no  guide beyond the recollection of the previous visits two and three years  before, and a sort of idea that we must go north-west. As it was not yet  July, the cows had not made their summer move to the higher chalets, and  we found the mountains uninhabited and still.    The point to be made for is the upper Chalet of La Genolliere, called by  some of the people _La Baronne_, [2] though the district map puts La  Baronne at some distance from the site of the glaciere. We had some  difficulty in finding the chalet, and were obliged to spread out now and  then, that each might hunt a specified portion of the wood or glade for  signs to guide our further advance, enjoying meanwhile the lilies of the  mountain and lilies of the valley, and fixing upon curious trees and  plants as landmarks for our return. In crossing the last grass, we found  the earliest vanilla orchis (_Orchis nigra_) of the year, and came upon  beds of moonwort (_Botrychium Lunaria_) of so unusual a size that our  progress ceased till such time as the finest specimens were secured.    Some time before reaching this point, we caught a glimpse of a dark  speck on the highest summit in sight, which recalled pleasantly a night  we had spent there three years before for the purpose of seeing the sun  rise.[3] My sisters had revisited the Chalet des Chevres, which this  dark speck represented, in 1862, and found that the small chamber in  which we had slept on planks and logs had become a more total ruin than  before, in the course of the winter, so that it is now utterly  untenable.    From Arzier to the Chalet of La Genolliere, would be about two hours,  for a man walking and mounting quickly, and never losing the way; and  the glaciere lies a few minutes farther to the north-west, at an  elevation of about 2,800 feet above the lake, or 4,000 feet above the  sea.[4] A rough mountain road, leading over an undulating expanse of  grass, passes narrowly between two small clumps of trees, each  surrounded by a low circular wall, the longer diameter of the  enclosure on the south side of the road being 60 feet. In this  enclosure is a natural pit, of which the north side is a sheer rock,  of the ordinary limestone of the Jura, with a chasm almost from the  top; while the south side is less steep, and affords the means of  scrambling down to the bottom, where a cave is found at the foot of  the chasm, passing under the road. The floor of this small but  comparatively lofty cave is 52 feet below the surface of the earth,  and slopes away rapidly to the west, where, by the help of candles,  the rock which forms the wall is seen to stop short of the floor,  leaving an entrance 2 or 3 feet high to an inner cave--the glaciere.  The roof of this inner cave rises slightly, and its floor falls, so  that there is a height of about 6 feet inside, excepting where a large  open fissure in the roof passes high up towards the world above. At  one end, neither the roof nor the floor slopes much, and in this part  of the cave the height is less than 3 feet.    It would be very imprudent to go straight into an ice-cave after a long  walk on a hot summer's day, so we prepared to dine under the shade of  the trees at the edge of the pit, and I went down into the cave for a  few moments to get a piece of ice for our wine. My first impression was  that the glaciere was entirely destroyed, for the outer cave was a mere  chaos of rock and stones; but, on further investigation, it turned out  that the ruin had not reached the inner cave. In our previous visit we  had noticed a natural basin of some size and depth among the trees on  the north side of the road, and we now found that the chaos was the  result of a recent falling-in of this basin; so that from the bottom of  the first cave, standing as it were under the road, we could see  daylight through the newly-formed hole.    The total length of the floor of the inner cave, which lies north-east  and south-west, is 51 feet; and of this floor a length of about 37 feet  was more or less covered with ice, the greatest breadth of the ice being  within an inch or two of 11 feet. Excepting in the part of the cave  already mentioned as being less than 3 feet high, we found the floor not  nearly so dry, nor so completely covered with ice, as when we first saw  the glaciere, three years before, in the middle of an exceptionally hot  August. Under the low roof all was very dry, though even there the ice  had not an average thickness of more than 8 inches. It may be as well to  say, once for all, that the ice in these caves is never found in a sheet  on a pool of water; it is always solid, forming the floor of the cave,  filling up the interstices of the loose stones, and rising above them,  in this case with a surface perfectly level.    [Illustration: ICE-COLUMNS IN THE GLACIERE OF LA GENOLLIERE.]    We found four principal columns of ice, three of which, in the loftiest  part of the cave, are represented in the accompanying engraving: I call  them three, and not two, because the two which unite in a common base  proceeded from different fissures. The line of light at the foot of the  rock-wall is the only entrance to the glaciere. The lowest column was  11-2/3 feet high and 1-2/3 feet broad, not more than 6 inches thick in  the middle, half-way up, and flattened symmetrically so as to be  comparatively sharp at the edges, like a huge double-edged sword. It  stood clear of the rock through its whole height, but scarcely left room  between itself and the wall of the cave for a candle to be passed up and  down. The other two columns shown in the engraving poured out of  fissures in the rock, streaming down as cascades, the one being 13-1/2  and the other 15 feet high; and when we tied a candle to the end of an  alpenstock, and passed it into the fissures, we found that the bend of  the fissures prevented our seeing the termination of the ice. An  intermittent disturbance of the air in these fissures made the flame  flicker at intervals, though generally the candle burned steadily in  them, and we could detect no current in the cave. The fourth column was  in the low part of the cave, and we were obliged to grovel on the ice to  get its dimensions: it was 3-1/4 feet broad and 4-1/3 feet high, the  roof of the cave being only 2-3/4 feet high; and it poured out of the  vertical fissure like a smooth round fall of water, adhering lightly to  the rock at its upper end like a fungus, and growing out suddenly in its  full size. This column was dry, whereas on the others there were  abundant symptoms of moisture, as if small quantities of water were  trickling down them from their fissures, though the fissures themselves  appeared to be perfectly dry.    In one of the fissures there was a patch of what is known as  sweating-stone, [5] with globules of water oozing out, and standing  roundly upon it: the globules were not frozen. This stone was  exceedingly hard, and defied all our efforts to break off a specimen,  but at last we got two small pieces, hard and heavy, and wrapped them  in paper; ten weeks after, we found them of course quite dry, and  broke them easily, small as they were, with our fingers. The fissure  from which the shortest of the four columns came was full of gnats, as  were also several crevices in the walls of the cave, especially in the  lowest part; and we found a number of large red-brown flies, [6]  nearly an inch long, running rapidly on the ice and stones, after the  fashion of the flies with which trout love best to be taken. The  central parts of the cave, where the roof is high, were in a state  provincially known as 'sloppy,' and drops of water fell now and then  from above, either splashing on wet stones, or hollowing out basins in  the remaining ice, or, sometimes, shrewdly detecting the most  sensitive spot in the back of the human neck. We placed one of  Casella's thermometers on a piece of wood on one of the wet stones,  clear of the ice, and it soon fell to 34 deg.. Probably the temperature  had been somewhat raised by the continued presence of three human  beings and two lighted candles in the small cavern; and, at any rate,  the cold of two degrees above freezing was something very real on a  hot summer's day, and told considerably upon my sisters, so that we  were compelled to beat a retreat,--not quite in time, for one of our  party could not effect a thaw, even by stamping about violently in the  full afternoon sun.    While we were in the cave, we noticed that the surfaces of the columns  were covered by very irregular lines, marked somewhat deeply in the  ice, and dividing the surface into areas of all shapes, a sort of  network, with meshes of many different shapes and sizes. These areas  were smaller towards the edges of the columns; the lines containing  them were not, as a rule, straight lines, and almost baffled our  efforts to count them, but, to the best of my belief, there were  meshes with three, four, and up to eight sides. The column which  stood clear of the rock was composed of very limpid ice, without  admixture of air; but the cascades were interpenetrated by veins of  looser white ice, and, where the white ice came, the surface lines  seemed to disappear. As we sat on the grass outside, arranging our  properties for departure, my attention was arrested by the columnar  appearance of the fractured edge of the block of ice which we had used  at luncheon. It was about 5 inches thick, and had formed part of a  stalagmite whose horizontal section, like that of the free column,  would be an ellipse of considerable eccentricity; and, on examination,  it turned out that the surface areas, which varied in size from a  large thumb-nail to something very small, were the ends of prisms  reaching through to the other side of the piece of ice, at any rate in  the thinner parts, and presenting there"]]]
