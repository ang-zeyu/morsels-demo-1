The search after  food is the principal cause why animals change their places. The  different tribes of the wading birds always migrate when rain is  about to take place; and I remember once, in Italy, having been long  waiting, in the end of March, for the arrival of the double snipe in  the Campagna of Rome, a great flight appeared on the 3rd of April,  and the day after heavy rain set in, which greatly interfered with  my sport. The vulture, upon the same principle, follows armies; and  I have no doubt that the augury of the ancients was a good deal  founded upon the observation of the instincts of birds. There are  many superstitions of the vulgar owing to the same source. For  anglers, in spring, it is always unlucky to see single magpies,--but  two may be always regarded as a favourable omen; and the reason is,  that in cold and stormy weather, one magpie alone leaves the nest in  search of food, the other remaining sitting upon the eggs or the  young ones; but when two go out together, it is only when the  weather is warm and mild, and favourable for fishing.    _Poiet_. The singular connexions of causes and effects, to  which you have just referred, make superstition less to be wondered  at, particularly amongst the vulgar; and when two facts naturally  unconnected, have been accidentally coincident, it is not singular  that this coincidence should have been observed and registered, and  that omens of the most absurd kind should be trusted in. In the west  of England, half a century ago, a particular hollow noise on the  sea-coast was referred to a spirit or goblin, called Bucca, and was  supposed to foretell a shipwreck: the philosopher knows that sound  travels much faster than currents in the air, and the sound always  foretold the approach of a very heavy storm, which seldom takes  place on that wild and rocky coast without a shipwreck on some part  of its extensive shores, surrounded by the Atlantic.    _Phys_. All the instances of omens you have mentioned are  founded on reason; but how can you explain such absurdities as  Friday being an unlucky day, the terror of spilling salt, or meeting  an old woman? I knew a man of very high dignity, who was exceedingly  moved by these omens, and who never went out shooting without a  bittern's claw fastened to his button-hole by a riband, which he  thought ensured him good luck.    _Poiet_. These, as well as the omens of death-watches, dreams,  &c., are for the most part founded upon some accidental  coincidences; but spilling of salt, on an uncommon occasion, may, as  I have known it, arise from a disposition to apoplexy, shown by an  incipient numbness in the hand, and may be a fatal symptom; and  persons, dispirited by bad omens, sometimes prepare the way for evil  fortune; for confidence in success is a great means of ensuring it.  The dream of Brutus, before the field of Pharsalia, probably  produced a species of irresolution and despondency, which was the  principal cause of his losing the battle: and I have heard that the  illustrious sportsman to whom you referred just now, was always  observed to shoot ill, because he shot carelessly, after one of his  dispiriting omens.    _Hal_. I have in life met with a few {36} things which I found  it impossible to explain, either by chance coincidences or by  natural connexions; and I have known minds of a very superior class  affected by them,--persons in the habit of reasoning deeply and  profoundly.    _Phys_. In my opinion, profound minds are the most likely to  think lightly of the resources of human reason; and it is the pert,  superficial thinker, who is generally strongest in every kind of  unbelief. The deep philosopher sees chains of causes and effects so  wonderfully and strangely linked together, that he is usually the  last person to decide upon the impossibility of any two series of  events being independent of each other; and in sciences, so many  natural miracles, as it were, have been brought to light,--such as  the fall of stones from meteors in the atmosphere, the disarming of  a thunder-cloud by a metallic point, the production of fire from ice  by a metal white as silver, and referring certain laws of motion of  the sea to the moon,--that the physical inquirer is seldom disposed  to assert, confidently, on any abstruse subjects belonging to the  order of natural things, and still less so on those relating to the  more mysterious relations of moral events and intellectual natures.                     *       *       *       *       *      DEVIL'S HOLE, KIRBY STEPHEN.    (_For the Mirror._)    At about three quarters of a mile east of Kirby Stephen,  Westmoreland, is a bridge of solid rock, known by the name of  _Staincroft Bridge_ or Stonecroft Bridge, under which runs a  small but fathomless rivulet. The water roars and gushes through the  surrounding rocks and precipices with such violence, as almost to  deafen the visitor. Three or four yards from the bridge is an  immense abyss, where the waters \"incessantly roar,\" which goes by  the name of _Devil's Hole_; the tradition of which is, that two  lovers were swallowed up in this frightful gulf. The neighbouring  peasants tell a tale of one _Deville_, a lover, who, through  revenge, plunged his fair mistress into these waters, and afterwards  followed her. How far this story may get belief, I know not; but  such they aver is the truth, while they mournfully lament the sad  affair.--They point out a small hole in the bank where you may hear  the waters dashing with fury against the projecting rocks. This,  some imagine to be the noise of infernal spirits, who have taken up  their abode in this tremendous abyss; while others persist in their  opinion, that the lover's name was _Deville_, and that it  retains his name to this day, in commemoration of the horrid deed.    I have seen, and taken a view of the frightful place, which may  rather be imagined than described. One part of the water was  formerly so narrow, that a wager was laid by a gentleman that he  could span it with the thumb and little finger, and which he would  have accomplished, but his adversary, getting up in the night time,  chipped a piece off the rock with a hammer, and thus won the wager.  It is now, however, little more than from a foot and a half, to two  feet broad, excepting at the falls and _Devil's Hole_. The  water runs into the Eden at the distance of about a mile or two from  Staincroft Bridge. Trout are caught with the line and net in great  quantities, and are particularly fine here.

[Mrs. Bowdich is the widow of Mr. Thomas Edward Bowdich,      who fell a victim to his enterprize in exploring the      interior of Africa, in 1824. Mr. B. was a profound classic      and linguist and member of several learned societies in      England and abroad. In 1819 he published, in a quarto      volume, his \"Mission to Ashantee,\" a work of the highest      importance and interest. Mrs. B., whose pencil has      furnished embellishments for her husband's literary      productions, has published \"Excursions to Madeira, &c.,\"      and this amiable and accomplished lady has now in course      of publication, a work on the Fresh-water Fishes of Great      Britain.--The subsequent anecdotes are of equal interest      to the student of natural history and the general reader,      especially as they exhibit the habits and disposition of      the Panther in a new light. The Ounce, a variety of the      Panther is, however, easily tamed and trained to the chase      of deer, the gazelle, &c.--for which purpose it has long      been employed in the East, and also during the middle ages      in Italy and France.--Mr. Kean, the tragedian, a few years      since, had a tame _Puma_, or American Lion, which he      kept at his house in Clarges-street, Piccadilly, and      frequently introduced to large parties of company.--ED.]    I am induced to send you some account of a panther which was in my  possession for several months. He and another were found when very  young in the forest, apparently deserted by their mother. They were  taken to the king of Ashantee, in whose palace they lived several  weeks, when my hero, being much larger than his companion, suffocated  him in a fit of romping, and was then sent to Mr. Hutchison, the  resident left by Mr. Bowdich at Coomassie. This gentleman, observing  that the animal was very docile, took pains to tame him, and in a great  measure succeeded. When he was about a year old, Mr. Hutchison returned  to Cape Coast, and had him led through the country by a chain,  occasionally letting {37} him loose when eating was going forward, when  he would sit by his master's side, and receive his share with  comparative gentleness. Once or twice he purloined a fowl, but easily  gave it up to Mr. Hutchison, on being allowed a portion of something  else. The day of his arrival he was placed in a small court, leading to  the private rooms of the governor, and after dinner was led by a thin  cord into the room, where he received our salutations with some degree  of roughness, but with perfect good-humour. On the least encouragement  he laid his paws upon our shoulders, rubbed his head upon us, and his  teeth and claws having been filed, there was no danger of tearing our  clothes. He was kept in the above court for a week or two, and evinced  no ferocity, except when one of the servants tried to pull his food  from him; he then caught the offender by the leg, and tore out a piece  of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12888"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 05 (#2)"],[1,"by an all-wise and all-good Creator for  the benefit of man, his highest product; while other thinkers regarded  Spinozism as the only rational system, indeed as the last word of all  speculative metaphysics; for them logical thought necessarily led to  pantheism and determinism. In France, after reaching its climax in  Voltaire, it ended in materialism, atheism, and fatalism; and in  England, where it had developed the empiricism of Locke, it came to  grief in the scepticism of Hume. If we can know only our impressions,  then rational theology, cosmology, and psychology are impossible, and  it is futile to philosophize about God, the world, and the human soul.  Consistently carried out, the logical-mathematical method seemed to  land the intellect in Spinozism or in materialism--in either case to  catch man in the causal machinery of nature. In this dilemma many were  tempted to throw reason overboard as an instrument of ultimate  truth, and to seek for certainty through other functions of the human  soul--in feeling, faith, or mystical vision of some sort; the claims  of the heart and will were urged against the proud pretensions of the  intellect (Hamann, Herder, Jacobi). Another way of escape was found  by substituting the organic conception of reality for the  logical-mathematical view of the _Aufklaerung_; nature and life,  poetry, art, language, political, social, and religious institutions  are not creations of reason, not things made to order, but  organic--products of evolution (Lessing, Herder, Winckelmann, Goethe).  Man, himself, moreover, is not mere intellect, but a being in whom  feelings, impulses, yearnings, will, are elements to be reckoned with.  And reality is not as transparent as the Enlightenment assumed it to  be; existence divided by reason leaves a remainder, as Goethe had put  it.    It was Immanuel Kant who tried to arbitrate between the conflicting  tendencies of his age. He was an _Aufklaerer_ in so far as he brought  reason itself to the bar of reason and sat in judgment upon its  claims, and, likewise, in so far as he insisted on the objective  validity of physics and mathematics. But he was as much opposed to  the pretentiousness of dogmatic metaphysics as to the pusillanimity  of scepticism and the _Schwaermerei_ of mysticism. He repudiated the  shallow proofs of the existence of God, freedom, and immortality  no less emphatically than he rejected materialism with its  atheism, fatalism, and hedonism. He tried to save everything worth  saving--rational knowledge, modern science, the basal truths of  the old metaphysics, and the most precious human values. For  the scientific intelligence, so he held, nature and the self are  absolutely determined; every physical occurrence and every human act  are necessary links in a causal chain. But such knowledge is  possible only in the field of phenomena (_Erscheinungen_); through  sense-perception and the discursive understanding we cannot reach the  inner core of reality; nor can we pierce the veil of appearances by  means of intellectual intuitions, mystical visions, feeling, or faith,  i.e., through the emotional and instinctive parts of our nature. It is  the presence of the moral law or categorical imperative within us that  points to a spiritual world beyond the phenomenal causal order and  assures us of our freedom, immortality, and God. It is because we  possess this deeper source of truth in practical reason that freedom  and an ideal kingdom in which purpose reigns are vouchsafed to us, and  that we can free ourselves from the mechanism of the natural order.  It is moral truth that both sets us free and demonstrates our freedom,  and that makes harmony possible between the mechanical theory of  science and the teleological conception of philosophy. The scientific  understanding would plunge us into determinism and agnosticism; from  these, faith in the moral law alone can deliver us. In this sense  Kant destroyed knowledge to make room for a rational faith in a  supersensible world, to save the independence and dignity of the human  self and the spiritual values of his people. In claiming a place  for the autonomous personality in what _appeared to be_ a mechanical  universe, Kant gave voice to some of the deeper yearnings of the age.  The German Enlightenment, the new humanism, mysticism, pietism,  and the faith-philosophy were all interested in the human soul, and  unwilling to sacrifice it to the demands of a rationalistic science or  metaphysics. In seeking to rescue it, the great criticist, piloted by  the moral law, steered his course between the rocks of rationalism,  sentimentalism, and scepticism. It was his solution of the controversy  between the head and the heart that influenced Fichte, Schelling, and  Schleiermacher. They differed from Kant and among themselves in many  respects, but they all glorified the spirit, _Geist_, as the living,  active element of reality, and they all rejected the intellect as  the source of ultimate truth. They followed him in his  anti-intellectualism, but they did not avoid, as he did, the  attractive doctrine of an inner intuition; according to them we can  somehow grasp the supersensible in an inner experience which Fichte  called intellectual, Schelling artistic, Schleiermacher religious. The  bankruptcy of the intelligence was overcome in their systems by the  discovery of a faculty that revealed to them the living, dynamic  nature of the universe. They were all more or less influenced by the  romantic currents of the times, seeking with Herder and Jacobi an  approach to the heart of things other than through the categories  of logic. Like Lessing and Goethe, they were also attracted to  the pantheistic teaching of Spinoza, though rejecting its rigid  determinism so far as it might affect the human will. They likewise  accepted the idea of development which the leaders of German  literature, Lessing, Herder, and Goethe, had already opposed to the  unhistorical _Aufklaerung_, and which came to play such a prominent  part in the great system of Hegel.    Johann Gottlieb Fichte was born in Ramenau, Oberlausitz, May 19, 1762,  the son of a poor weaver. Through the generosity of a nobleman,  the gifted lad was enabled to follow his intellectual bent; after  attending the schools at Meissen and Schulpforta he studied theology  at the universities of Jena, Leipzig, and Wittenberg with the purpose  of entering the ministry. His poverty frequently compelled him to  interrupt his studies by accepting private tutorships in families, so  that he never succeeded in preparing him self for the examinations. In  1790 he became acquainted with Kant's philosophy, which two students  had asked him to expound to them, and to which he now devoted himself  with feverish zeal. It revolutionized his entire mode of thought and  determined the course of his life. The anonymous publication of his  book, _Attempt at a Critique of all Revelation_, in 1792, written  from the Kantian point of view and mistaken at first for a work of  the great criticist, won him fame and a professorship at Jena (1794).  Here, in the intellectual centre of Germany, Fichte became the  eloquent exponent of the new idealism, which aimed at the reform of  life as well as of _Wissenschaft_; he not only taught philosophy, but  _preached_ it, as Kuno Fischer has aptly said. During the Jena  period he laid the foundations for his \"Science of Knowledge\"  (_Wissenschaftslehre_) which he presented in numerous works: _The  Conception of the Science of Knowledge_, 1794; _The Foundation of  the Entire Science of Knowledge_, 1794; _The Foundation of Natural  Rights_, 1796; _The System of Ethics_, 1798--(all these translated by  Kroeger); the two _Introductions to the Science of Knowledge_, 1797  (trans. by Kroeger in _Journal of Speculative Philosophy_). The  appearance of an article _Concerning the Ground of our Belief in a  Divine World-Order_, 1798, in which Fichte seemed to identify God with  the moral world-order, brought down upon him the charge of atheism,  against which he vigorously defended himself in his _Appeal to the  Public_ and a series of other writings. Full of indignation over the  attitude which his government assumed in the matter, be offered his  resignation (1799) and removed to Berlin, where he presented his  philosophical notions in popular public lectures and in writings which  were characterized by clearness, force, and moral earnestness rather  than by their systematic form. There appeared: _The Vocation of Man_,  1800 (translated by Dr. Smith); _A Sun-Clear Statement concerning the  Nature of the New Philosophy_, 1801 (trans. by Kroeger in _Journal of  Speculative Philosophy_); _The Nature of the Scholar_, 1806 (trans. by  Smith); _Characteristics of the Present Age_, 1806 (trans. by Smith);  _The Way towards the Blessed Life_, 1806 (trans. by Smith). After the  overthrow of Prussia by Napoleon, in 1806, Fichte fled from Berlin to  Koenigsberg and Sweden, but returned when peace was declared in  1807, and delivered his celebrated _Addresses to the German Nation_,  1807-08, in which he sought to arouse the German people to a  consciousness of their national mission and their duty even while the  French army was still occupying the Prussian capital.    Fichte was appointed professor of philosophy (1810) in the new  University of Berlin, for which he had been invited to construct a  plan and in the establishment of which he took a lively interest.  During the last period of his life he devoted himself to the  development of his thoughts in systematic form and wrote a number of  books; most of these were published after his death, which occurred  January 27, 1814. Among them we mention: _General Outline of  the Science of Knowledge_, 1810 (trans. by Smith); _The Facts of  Consciousness_, 1813; _Theory of the State_, published 1820. The  Complete Works, edited by his son, J.H. Fichte, appeared 1843-46. New"]]]
