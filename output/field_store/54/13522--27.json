His master would sell him and tell him to run away  and come back to his cave. He'd feed him. He never worked and he went up  for his provisions. He was sold over and over and over. His master  learnt him in books and to how to cuss. He learnt him how to trick the  dogs and tap trees like a coon. At the end of the trail the dogs would  turn on the huntsman. Uncle Frank was active when he was old. He was  hired out to race other boys sometimes. He never wore glasses. He could  see well when he was old.

Civilized and educated, the Indian of  the better class is not less intelligent than the average white man, and he  has every capacity for becoming a good citizen.    This is the view held not only by myself, but by all of the many old  frontiersmen that I have known, who have had occasion to live much among  Indians, and by most experienced army officers. It was the view held by my  friend and schoolmate, the lamented Lieutenant Casey, whose good work in  transforming the fierce Northern Cheyennes into United States soldiers is  well known among all officers of the army, and whose sad death by an Indian  bullet has not yet, I believe, been forgotten by the public.    It is proper that something should be said as to how this book came to be  written.    About ten years ago, Mr. J.W. Schultz of Montana, who was then living in  the Blackfoot camp, contributed to the columns of the _Forest and Stream_,  under the title \"Life among the Blackfeet,\" a series of sketches of that  people. These papers seemed to me of unusual interest, and worthy a record  in a form more permanent than the columns of a newspaper; but no  opportunity was then presented for filling in the outlines given in them.    Shortly after this, I visited the Pi-k[)u]n-i tribe of the Black-feet, and  I have spent more or less time in their camps every year since. I have  learned to know well all their principal men, besides many of the Bloods  and the Blackfeet, and have devoted much time and effort to the work of  accumulating from their old men and best warriors the facts bearing on the  history, customs, and oral literature of the tribe, which are presented in  this volume.    In 1889 my book on the Pawnees was published, and seemed to arouse so much  interest in Indian life, from the Indian's standpoint, that I wrote to  Mr. Schultz, urging him, as I had often done before, to put his  observations in shape for publication, and offered to edit his work, and to  see it through the press. Mr. Schultz was unwilling to undertake this task,  and begged me to use all the material which I had gathered, and whatever he  could supply, in the preparation of a book about the Blackfeet.    A portion of the material contained in these pages was originally made  public by Mr. Schultz, and he was thus the discoverer of the literature of  the Blackfeet. My own investigations have made me familiar with all the  stories here recorded, from original sources, but some of them he first  published in the columns of the _Forest and Stream_. For this work he is  entitled to great credit, for it is most unusual to find any one living the  rough life beyond the frontier, and mingling in daily intercourse with  Indians, who has the intelligence to study their traditions, history, and  customs, and the industry to reduce his observations to writing.    Besides the invaluable assistance given me by Mr. Schultz, I acknowledge  with gratitude the kindly aid of Miss Cora M. Ross, one of the school  teachers at the Blackfoot agency, who has furnished me with a version of  the story of the origin of the Medicine Lodge; and of Mrs. Thomas Dawson,  who gave me help on the story of the Lost Children. William Jackson, an  educated half-breed, who did good service from 1874 to 1879, scouting under  Generals Custer and Miles, and William Russell, half-breed, at one time  government interpreter at the agency, have both given me valuable  assistance. The latter has always placed himself at my service, when I  needed an interpreter, while Mr. Jackson has been at great pains to assist  me in securing several tales which I might not otherwise have obtained, and  has helped me in many ways. The veteran prairie man, Mr. Hugh Monroe, and  his son, John Monroe, have also given me much information. Most of the  stories I owe to Blackfeet, Bloods, and Piegans of pure race. Some of these  men have died within the past few years, among them the kindly and  venerable Red Eagle; Almost-a-Dog, a noble old man who was regarded with  respect and affection by Indians and whites; and that matchless orator,  Four Bears. Others, still living, to whom I owe thanks, are Wolf Calf, Big  Nose, Heavy Runner, Young Bear Chief, Wolf Tail, Rabid Wolf, Running  Rabbit, White Calf, All-are-his-Children, Double Runner, Lone Medicine  Person, and many others.    The stories here given cover a wide range of subjects, but are fair  examples of the oral literature of the Blackfeet. They deal with religion,  the origin of things, the performances of medicine men, the bravery and  single-heartedness of warriors.    It will be observed that in more than one case two stories begin in the  same way, and for a few paragraphs are told in language which is almost  identical. In like manner it is often to be noted that in different stories  the same incidents occur. This is all natural enough, when it is remembered  that the range of the Indians' experiences is very narrow. The incidents  of camp life, of hunting and war excursions, do not offer a very wide  variety of conditions; and of course the stories of the people deal chiefly  with matters with which they are familiar. They are based on the every-day  life of the narrators.    The reader of these Blackfoot stories will not fail to notice many curious  resemblances to tales told among other distant and different peoples. Their  similarity to those current among the Ojibwas, and other Eastern Algonquin  tribes, is sufficiently obvious and altogether to be expected, nor is it at  all remarkable that we should find, among the Blackfeet, tales identical  with those told by tribes of different stock far to the south; but it is a  little startling to see in the story of the Worm Pipe a close parallel to  the classical myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. In another of the stories is an  incident which might have been taken bodily from the Odyssey.    Well-equipped students of general folk-lore will find in these tales much  to interest them, and to such may be left the task of commenting on this  collection.          STORIES OF ADVENTURE        THE PEACE WITH THE SNAKES      I    In those days there was a Piegan chief named Owl Bear. He was a great  chief, very brave and generous. One night he had a dream: he saw many dead  bodies of the enemy lying about, scalped, and he knew that he must go to  war. So he called out for a feast, and after the people had eaten, he  said:--    \"I had a strong dream last night. I went to war against the Snakes, and  killed many of their warriors. So the signs are good, and I feel that I  must go. Let us have a big party now, and I will be the leader. We will  start to-morrow night.\"    Then he told two old men to go out in the camp and shout the news, so that  all might know. A big party was made up. Two hundred men, they say, went  with this chief to war. The first night they travelled only a little way,  for they were not used to walking, and soon got tired.    In the morning the chief got up early and went and made a sacrifice, and  when he came back to the others, some said, \"Come now, tell us your dream  of this night.\"    \"I dreamed good,\" said Owl Bear. \"I had a good dream. We will have good  luck.\"    But many others said they had bad dreams. They saw blood running from their  bodies.    Night came, and the party started on, travelling south, and keeping near  the foot-hills; and when daylight came, they stopped in thick pine woods  and built war lodges. They put up poles as for a lodge, and covered them  very thick with pine boughs, so they could build fires and cook, and no one  would see the light and smoke; and they all ate some of the food they  carried, and then went to sleep.    Again the chief had a good dream, but the others all had bad dreams, and  some talked about turning back; but Owl Bear laughed at them, and when  night came, all started on. So they travelled for some nights, and all  kept dreaming bad except the chief. He always had good dreams. One day  after a sleep, a person again asked Owl Bear if he dreamed good. \"Yes,\" he  replied. \"I have again dreamed of good luck.\"    \"We still dream bad,\" the person said, \"and now some of us are going to  turn back. We will go no further, for bad luck is surely ahead.\" \"Go back!  go back!\" said Owl Bear. \"I think you are cowards; I want no cowards with  me.\" They did not speak again. Many of them turned around, and started  north, toward home.    Two more days' travel. Owl Bear and his warriors went on, and then another  party turned back, for they still had bad dreams. All the men now left with  him were his relations. All the others had turned back.    They travelled on, and travelled on, always having bad dreams, until they  came close to the Elk River.[1] Then the oldest relation said, \"Come, my  chief, let us all turn back. We still have bad dreams. We cannot have good  luck.\"    [Footnote 1: Yellowstone River.]    \"No,\" replied Owl Bear, \"I will not turn back.\"    Then they were going to seize him and tie his hands, for they had talked of  this before. They thought to tie him and make him go back with them. Then  the chief got very angry. He put an arrow on his bow, and said: \"Do not  touch me. You are my relations; but if any of you try to tie me, I will  kill you. Now I am ashamed. My relations are cowards and will turn back. I  have told you I have always dreamed good, and that we would have good luck.  Now I don't care; I am covered with shame. I am going now to the Snake camp  and will give them my body. I am ashamed. Go! go! and when you get home put  on women's dresses. You are no longer men.\"    They said no more. They turned back homeward, and the chief was all  alone. His heart was very sad as he travelled on, and he was much ashamed,  for his"]]]
