Their wants and caprices being supplied, they would take leave of the  governor, strike their tents, launch their canoes, and ply their way up  the Ottawa to the lakes.    A new and anomalous class of men gradually grew out of this trade. These  were called coureurs des bois, rangers of the woods; originally men  who had accompanied the Indians in their hunting expeditions, and made  themselves acquainted with remote tracts and tribes; and who now became,  as it were, peddlers of the wilderness. These men would set out from  Montreal with canoes well stocked with goods, with arms and ammunition,  and would make their way up the mazy and wandering rivers that interlace  the vast forests of the Canadas, coasting the most remote lakes, and  creating new wants and habitudes among the natives. Sometimes they  sojourned for months among them, assimilating to their tastes and habits  with the happy facility of Frenchmen, adopting in some degree the Indian  dress, and not unfrequently taking to themselves Indian wives.    Twelve, fifteen, eighteen months would often elapse without any tidings  of them, when they would come sweeping their way down the Ottawa in full  glee, their canoes laden down with packs of beaver skins. Now came their  turn for revelry and extravagance. \"You would be amazed,\" says an old  writer already quoted, \"if you saw how lewd these peddlers are when they  return; how they feast and game, and how prodigal they are, not only in  their clothes, but upon their sweethearts. Such of them as are married  have the wisdom to retire to their own houses; but the bachelors act  just as an East Indiaman and pirates are wont to do; for they lavish,  eat, drink, and play all away as long as the goods hold out; and when  these are gone, they even sell their embroidery, their lace, and their  clothes. This done, they are forced upon a new voyage for subsistence.\"    Many of these coureurs des bois became so accustomed to the Indian mode  of living, and the perfect freedom of the wilderness, that they lost  relish for civilization, and identified themselves with the savages  among whom they dwelt, or could only be distinguished from them by  superior licentiousness. Their conduct and example gradually corrupted  the natives, and impeded the works of the Catholic missionaries, who  were at this time prosecuting their pious labors in the wilds of Canada.    To check these abuses, and to protect the fur trade from various  irregularities practiced by these loose adventurers, an order was issued  by the French government prohibiting all persons, on pain of death, from  trading into the interior of the country without a license.    These licenses were granted in writing by the governor-general, and  at first were given only to persons of respectability; to gentlemen of  broken fortunes; to old officers of the army who had families to provide  for; or to their widows. Each license permitted the fitting out of  two large canoes with merchandise for the lakes, and no more than  twenty-five licenses were to be issued in one year. By degrees, however,  private licenses were also granted, and the number rapidly increased.  Those who did not choose to fit out the expeditions themselves, were  permitted to sell them to the merchants; these employed the coureurs des  bois, or rangers of the woods, to undertake the long voyages on shares,  and thus the abuses of the old system were revived and continued.    The pious missionaries employed by the Roman Catholic Church to convert  the Indians, did everything in their power to counteract the profligacy  caused and propagated by these men in the heart of the wilderness. The  Catholic chapel might often be seen planted beside the trading house,  and its spire surmounted by a cross, towering from the midst of an  Indian village, on the banks of a river or a lake. The missions had  often a beneficial effect on the simple sons of the forest, but had  little power over the renegades from civilization.    At length it was found necessary to establish fortified posts at the  confluence of the rivers and the lakes for the protection of the trade,  and the restraint of these profligates of the wilderness. The most  important of these was at Michilimackinac, situated at the strait of the  same name, which connects Lakes Huron and Michigan. It became the great  interior mart and place of deposit, and some of the regular merchants  who prosecuted the trade in person, under their licenses, formed  establishments here. This, too, was a rendezvous for the rangers of the  woods, as well those who came up with goods from Montreal as those who  returned with peltries from the interior. Here new expeditions  were fitted out and took their departure for Lake Michigan and the  Mississippi; Lake Superior and the Northwest; and here the peltries  brought in return were embarked for Montreal.    The French merchant at his trading post, in these primitive days of  Canada, was a kind of commercial patriarch. With the lax habits and easy  familiarity of his race, he had a little world of self-indulgence and  misrule around him. He had his clerks, canoe men, and retainers of  all kinds, who lived with him on terms of perfect sociability, always  calling him by his Christian name; he had his harem of Indian beauties,  and his troop of halfbreed children; nor was there ever wanting a  louting train of Indians, hanging about the establishment, eating and  drinking at his expense in the intervals of their hunting expeditions.    The Canadian traders, for a long time, had troublesome competitors in  the British merchants of New York, who inveigled the Indian hunters  and the coureurs des bois to their posts, and traded with them on more  favorable terms. A still more formidable opposition was organized in  the Hudson's Bay Company, chartered by Charles II., in 1670, with the  exclusive privilege of establishing trading houses on the shores of that  bay and its tributary rivers; a privilege which they have maintained to  the present day. Between this British company and the French merchants  of Canada, feuds and contests arose about alleged infringements of  territorial limits, and acts of violence and bloodshed occurred between  their agents.    In 1762, the French lost possession of Canada, and the trade fell  principally into the hands of British subjects. For a time, however, it  shrunk within narrow limits. The old coureurs des bois were broken up  and dispersed, or, where they could be met with, were slow to accustom  themselves to the habits and manners of their British employers. They  missed the freedom, indulgence, and familiarity of the old French  trading houses, and did not relish the sober exactness, reserve, and  method of the new-comers. The British traders, too, were ignorant of the  country, and distrustful of the natives. They had reason to be so. The  treacherous and bloody affairs of Detroit and Michilimackinac showed  them the lurking hostility cherished by the savages, who had too long  been taught by the French to regard them as enemies.    It was not until the year 1766, that the trade regained its old  channels; but it was then pursued with much avidity and emulation  by individual merchants, and soon transcended its former bounds.  Expeditions were fitted out by various persons from Montreal and  Michilimackinac, and rivalships and jealousies of course ensued. The  trade was injured by their artifices to outbid and undermine each other;  the Indians were debauched by the sale of spirituous liquors, which had  been prohibited under the French rule. Scenes of drunkeness, brutality,  and brawl were the consequence, in the Indian villages and around the  trading houses; while bloody feuds took place between rival trading  parties when they happened to encounter each other in the lawless depths  of the wilderness.    To put an end to these sordid and ruinous contentions, several of the  principal merchants of Montreal entered into a partnership in the winter  of 1783, which was augmented by amalgamation with a rival company in  1787. Thus was created the famous \"Northwest Company,\" which for a time  held a lordly sway over the wintry lakes and boundless forests of  the Canadas, almost equal to that of the East India Company over the  voluptuous climes and magnificent realms of the Orient.    The company consisted of twenty-three shareholders, or partners,  but held in its employ about two thousand persons as clerks, guides,  interpreters, and \"voyageurs,\" or boatmen. These were distributed at  various trading posts, established far and wide on the interior lakes  and rivers, at immense distances from each other, and in the heart of  trackless countries and savage tribes.    Several of the partners resided in Montreal and Quebec, to manage  the main concerns of the company. These were called agents, and were  personages of great weight and importance; the other partners took  their stations at the interior posts, where they remained throughout  the winter, to superintend the intercourse with the various tribes of  Indians. They were thence called wintering partners.    The goods destined for this wide and wandering traffic were put up at  the warehouses of the company in Montreal, and conveyed in batteaux, or  boats and canoes, up the river Attawa, or Ottowa, which falls into the  St. Lawrence near Montreal, and by other rivers and portages, to Lake  Nipising, Lake Huron, Lake Superior, and thence, by several chains of  great and small lakes, to Lake Winnipeg, Lake Athabasca, and the Great  Slave Lake. This singular and beautiful system of internal seas, which  renders an immense region of wilderness so accessible to the frail bark  of the Indian or the trader, was studded by the remote posts of the  company, where they carried on their traffic with the surrounding  tribes.

The poem is a sort of autobiography in blank  verse, marked by all the characteristics of the poet--his original  vein of thought; his majestic, but sometimes diffuse, style of  speculation; his large sympathies with humanity, from its proudest  to its humblest forms. It will be read with great avidity by his  admirers--and there are few at this day who do not belong to that  class--as affording them a deeper insight into the mind of Wordsworth  than any of his other works. It is divided into several books, named  from the different situations or stages of the author's life, or the  subjects which at any period particularly engaged his attention. We  believe it will be more generally read than any poem of equal length  that has issued from the press in this age.           *       *       *       *       *    Miss COOPER's \"RURAL HOURS\"[1] is everywhere commended as one of  the most charming pictures that have ever appeared of country life.  The books of the Howitts, delineating the same class of subjects  in England and Germany, are not to be compared to Miss Cooper's for  delicate painting or grace and correctness of diction. The Evening  Post observes:        \"This is one of the most delightful books we have lately      taken up. It is a journal of daily observations made by an      intelligent and highly educated lady, residing in a most      beautiful part of the country, commencing with the spring of      1848, and closing with the end of the winter of 1849. They      almost wholly concern the occupations and objects of country      life, and it is almost enough to make one in love with such a      life to read its history so charmingly narrated. Every day has      its little record in this volume,--the record of some rural      employment, some note on the climate, some observation      in natural history, or occasionally some trait of rural      manners. The arrival and departure of the birds of passage      is chronicled, the different stages of vegetation are noted,      atmospheric changes and phenomena are described, and the      various living inhabitants of the field and forest are made      to furnish matter of entertainment for the reader. All this      is done with great variety and exactness of knowledge, and      without any parade of science. Descriptions of rural holidays      and rural amusements are thrown in occasionally, to give a      living interest to a picture which would otherwise become      monotonous from its uniform quiet. The work is written in      easy and flexible English, with occasional felicities of      expression. It is ascribed, as we believe we have informed our      readers, to a daughter of J. Fenimore Cooper. Our country is      full of most interesting materials for a work of this sort;      but we confess we hardly expected, at the present time, to see      them collected and arranged by so skillful a hand.\"    [Footnote 1: RURAL HOURS: by a Lady, George P.
