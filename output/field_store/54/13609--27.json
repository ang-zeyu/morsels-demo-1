To stated and public instruction, he added familiar visits and  Personal application, and was careful to improve the opportunities  which conversation offered of diffusing and increasing the influence  of religion.    By his natural temper he was quick of resentment; but by his  established and habitual practice, he was gentle, modest, and  inoffensive. His tenderness appeared in his attention to children,  and to the poor. To the poor, while he lived in the family of his  friend, he allowed the third part of his annual revenue, though  the whole was not a hundred a year; and for children, he condescended  to lay aside the scholar, the philosopher, and the wit, to write  little poems of devotion, and systems of instruction adapted to  their wants and capacities, from the dawn of reason through its  gradations of advance in the morning of life. Every man, acquainted  with the common principles of human action, will look with veneration  on the writer who is at one time combating Locke, and at another  making a catechism for children in their fourth year. A voluntary  descent from the dignity of science is perhaps the hardest lesson  that humility can teach.    As his mind was capacious, his curiosity excursive, and his industry  continual, his writings are very numerous, and his subjects various.  With his theological works I am only enough acquainted to admire  his meekness of opposition, and his mildness of censure. It was  not only in his book but in his mind that _orthodoxy_ was _united_  with _charity_.    Of his philosophical pieces, his Logic has been received into the  universities, and therefore wants no private recommendation: if  he owes part of it to Le Clerc, it must he considered that no man  who undertakes merely to methodize or illustrate a system, pretends  to be its author.    In his metaphysical disquisitions, it was observed by the late  learned Dr. Dyer, that he confounded the idea of _space_ with that  of _empty space_, and did not consider that though space might be  without matter, yet matter being extended, could not be without  space.    Few books have been perused by me with greater pleasure than his  _Improvement of the Mind_, of which the radical principles may  indeed be found in _Locke's Conduct of the Understanding_, but  they are so expanded and ramified by Watts, as to confer upon him  the merit of a work in the highest degree useful and pleasing.  Whoever has the care of instructing others, may be charged with  deficience in his duty if this book is not recommended.    I have mentioned his treatises of Theology as distinct from his  other productions: but the truth is, that whatever he took in  hand was, by his incessant solicitude for souls, converted to  Theology. As piety predominated in his mind, it is diffused over  his works: under his direction it may be truly said, _Theologiae  Philosophia ancillatur_, philosophy is subservient to evangelical  instruction; it is difficult to read a page without learning, or  at least wishing to be better. The attention is caught by indirect  instruction, and he that sat down only to reason, is on a sudden  compelled to pray.    It was therefore with great propriety that, in 1728, he received  From Edinburgh and Aberdeen an unsolicited diploma, by which he  became a Doctor of Divinity. Academical honours would have more  value, if they were always bestowed with equal judgement.    He continued many years to study and to preach, and to do good by  His instruction and example: till at last the infirmities of age  disabled him from the more laborious part of his ministerial  functions, and being no longer capable of public duty, he offered  to remit the salary appendant to it; but his congregation would  not accept the resignation.    By degrees his weakness increased, and at last confined him to  his chamber and his bed; where he was worn gradually away without  pain, till he expired, Nov. 25, 1748, in the seventy-fifth year  of his age.    Few men have left behind such purity of character, or such monuments  of laborious piety. He has provided instruction for all ages, from  those who are lisping their first lessons, to the enlightened readers  of Malbranche and Locke; he has left neither corporeal nor spiritual  nature unexamined; he has taught the art of reasoning, and the  science of the stars.    His character, therefore, must be formed from the multiplicity  and diversity of his attainments, rather than from any single  performance; for it would not be safe to claim for him the highest  rank in any single denomination of literary dignity; yet perhaps  there was nothing in which he would not have excelled, if he had  not divided his powers to different pursuits.    As a poet, had he been only a poet, he would probably have stood  high among the authors with whom he is now associated. For his  judgement was exact, and he noted beauties and faults with very  nice discernment; his imagination, as the _Dacian Battle_ proves,  was vigorous and active, and the stores of knowledge were large  by which his fancy was to be supplied. His ear was well-tuned, and  his diction was elegant and copious. But his devotional poetry is,  like that of others, unsatisfactory. The paucity of its topics  enforces perpetual repetition, and the sanctity of the matter  rejects the ornaments of figurative diction. It is sufficient  for Watts to have done better than others what no man has done  well.    His poems on other subjects seldom rise higher than might be  expected from the amusements of a Man of Letters, and have different  degrees of value as they are more or less laboured, or as the  occasion was more or less favourable to invention.    He writes too often without regular measures, and too often in  blank verse; the rhymes are not always sufficiently correspondent.  He is particularly unhappy in coining names expressive of characters.  His lines are commonly smooth and easy, and his thoughts always  religiously pure; but who is there that, to so much piety and  innocence, does not wish for a greater measure of sprightliness  and vigour? He is at least one of the few poets with whom youth  and ignorance may be safely pleased; and happy will be that reader  whose mind is disposed by his verses, or his prose, to imitate him  in all but his non-conformity, to copy his benevolence to man, and  his reverence to God.        PREFACE.    THE following extract from the Doctor's Preface, as it contains  the plan of his version of the Psalms, may be found useful:    \"I come therefore to explain my own design, which is this, To  accommodate the book of Psalms to Christian worship. And in order  to do this, it is necessary to divest David and Asaph, &c. of every  other character but that of a psalmist and a saint, and to make  them always speak the common sense, and language of a Christian.    \"Attempting the work with this view, I have entirely omitted several  whole psalms, and large pieces of many others; and have chosen out  of all of them, such parts only as might easily and naturally be  accommodated to the various occasions of the Christian life, or  at least might afford us some beautiful allusion to Christian  affairs. These I have copied and explained in the general style  of the gospel; nor have I confined my expressions to any particular  party or opinion; that in words prepared for public worship, and  for the lips of multitudes, there might not be a syllable offensive  to sincere Christians, whose judgments may differ in the lesser  matters of religion.    \"Where the Psalmist uses sharp invectives against his personal  enemies, I have endeavoured to turn the edge of them against our  spiritual adversaries, sin, Satan, and temptation. Where the  flights of his faith and love are sublime, I have often sunk the  expressions within the reach of an ordinary Christian: where the  words imply some peculiar wants or distresses, joys, or blessings,  I have used words of greater latitude and comprehension, suited  to the general circumstances of men.    \"Where the original runs in the form of prophecy concerning Christ  and his salvation, I have given an historical turn to the sense:  there is no necessity that we should always sing in the obscure  and doubtful style of prediction, when the things foretold are  brought into open light by a full accomplishment. Where the writers  of the New Testament have cited or alluded to any part the Psalms,  I have often indulged the liberty of paraphrase, according to the  words of Christ, or his Apostles. And surely this may be esteemed  the word of God still, though borrowed from several parts of the  Holy Scripture. Where the Psalmist describes religion by the fear  of God, I have often joined faith and love to it. Where he  speaks of the pardon of sin, through the mercies of God, I have  added the merits of a Saviour. Where he talks of sacrificing goats  or bullocks, I rather chuse to mention the sacrifice of Christ,  the Lamb of God. When he attends the ark with shouting into Zion,  I sing the ascension of my Saviour into heaven, or his presence  in his church on earth. Where he promises abundance of wealth,  honour, and long life, I have changed some of these typical  blessings for grace, glory, and life eternal, which are brought  to light by the gospel, and promised in the New Testament. And I  am fully satisfied, that more honor is done to our blessed Saviour,  by speaking his name, his graces, and actions, in his own language,  according to the brighter discoveries he hath now made, than by  going back again to the Jewish forms of worship, and the language  of types and figures.\"      Of chusing or finding the Psalm.    By consulting the Index at the end, any one may find hymns very  proper for many occasions of the Christian life and worship; though  no copy of David's Psalter can provide for all, as I have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13172"],[0,"True Stories of Crime From the District Attorney's Office (#2)"],[1,"to  the girl's confidence was, as the detective afterward testified, \"a  hundred-to-one shot.\"    \"Poor Jim!\" exclaimed the girl. \"Couldn't you smuggle some into the  Tombs for him?\"    Peabody took the hint. Of course he could. It would be a hard job--those  turnkeys were so suspicious. But _he_ could do it for her if anybody  could. He rambled on, telling his experiences with Parker in the past,  how he had been in Elmira Reformatory and elsewhere with him, and  gaining each moment valuable information from the girl's exclamations,  questions, and expression. He soon learned that she was Parker's wife,  that they were living in comparative comfort, and that she was an  exceedingly clever and well-educated woman, but she said nothing during  the conversation which would indicate that she knew anything of her  husband's offenses or of any persons connected with them.    After a few moments the girl slipped on her coat and hat and the two  started down to the Tombs, where, by prearrangement with the officials,  the detective succeeded in convincing her that he had been able to send  in to her husband a small hypodermic syringe (commonly called \"the  needles\") which she had purchased at a neighboring drug store.    The apparent success of this undertaking put Mrs. Parker in excellent  humor and she invited the supposed crook to breakfast with her at the  Broadway Central Hotel. So far, it will be observed, Peabody had  accomplished practically nothing. At breakfast the girl inquired of her  companion what his particular \"graft\" was, to which he replied that he  was an expert \"second story man,\" and then proceeded to indulge his  imagination in accounts of bold robberies in the brown stone districts  and clever \"tricks\" in other cities, which left Mrs. Parker in no doubt  but that her companion was an expert \"gun\" of long experience.    Then he took, as he expressed it, \"another chance.\"    \"Jim wanted me to tell you to put the gang 'wise,'\" said he.    The girl looked at him sharply and contracted her brows.    \"Gang?\" she exclaimed. \"What gang? Oh, perhaps he meant 'Dutch' and  'Sweeney.'\"    Peabody bit his lip. He had had a close call.    \"Don't know,\" he replied, \"he didn't say who they were--just to put them  'wise.'\"    A second time the detective had made a lucky hit, for Mrs. Parker  suddenly laid aside all pretense and asked:    \"Do you want to make a lot of money?\"    Peabody allowed that he did.    \"Do you know what they have got Jim for?\" asked the girl.    \"'Phoney' paper, wasn't it?\"    \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Parker, \"but Jim didn't write those checks. I wrote  them myself. If you want to go in with me, we can earn enough money to  get Jim out and you can do a good turn for yourself besides.\"    The detective's blood leaped in his veins but he held himself under  control as well as he could and answered indifferently.    \"I guess not. I never met a woman that was very good at that sort of  game.\"    \"Oh, you don't know _me_,\" she persisted. \"Why, I can copy anything in a  few moments--really I can.\"    \"Too dangerous,\" remarked Peabody. \"I might get settled for ten years.\"    \"No, you wouldn't,\" she continued. \"It's the easiest thing in the world.  All you have to do is to pick the mail out of some box on a corner. I  can show you how with a copper wire and a little piece of wax--and you  are sure to find among the letters somebody's check in payment of a  bill. There at once you have the bank, and the signature. Then all you  have to do is to write a letter to the bank asking for a new check book,  saying yours is used up, and sign the name that appears on the check. If  you can fool the cashier into giving your messenger a check book you can  gamble pretty safely on his paying a check signed with the same name. In  that way, you see, you can get all the blank checks you need and test  the cashier's watchfulness at the same time. It's too easy. The only  thing you have to look out for is not to overdraw the account. Still,  you find so many checks in the mail that you can usually choose  somebody's account that will stand the strain. Do you know, I have made  _hundreds_ of checks and the banks have certified every single one!\"    Peabody laughed good naturedly. Things were looking up a bit.    \"What do you think I am, anyhow?\" he asked. \"I must look like a  'come-on.'\"    \"I'm giving it to you straight,\" she said simply. \"After you have made  out a good fat check, then you go to a store, buy something, tell them  to forward the check to the bank for certification, and that you'll send  for the goods and the change the next day. The bank always certifies the  check, and you get the money.\"    \"Not always,\" said Peabody with a grin.    \"No, not always,\" acquiesced Mrs. Parker. \"But Jim and I have been  averaging over a hundred dollars a day for months.\"    \"Good graft, all right,\" assented the detective. \"But how does the one  who lays down the check identify himself? For instance, suppose I go  into Tiffany's and pick out a diamond, and say I'm Mr. John Smith, of  100 West One Hundredth Street, and the floorwalker says, 'Sorry, Mr.  Smith, but we don't know you,' what then?\"    \"Just flash a few letters on him,\" said the girl. \"Letters and  envelopes.\"    \"Where do you get 'em?\" asked Peabody.    \"Just write them, silly, and send them to yourself through the mail.\"    \"That's all right,\" retorted the \"second story man.\" \"But how can I mail  myself a letter to 100 West One Hundredth Street _when I don't live  there_?\"    Mrs. Parker smiled in a superior manner.    \"I'm glad I can put you wise to a new game, I invented it myself. You  want letters of identification? In different names and addresses on  different days? Very good. Buy a bundle of stamped envelopes and write  your own name and address on them _in pencil_. When they arrive rub off  the pencil address. Then if you want to be John Smith of 100 West One  Hundredth Street, or anybody else, just address the cancelled envelope  _in ink_.\"    \"Mabel,\" said Peabody with admiration, \"you've got the 'gray matter' all  right. You can have _me_, if you can deliver the rest of the goods.\"    [Illustration: FIG.3.--A letter-head frill of Mabel Parker's.]    \"There's still another little frill,\" she continued, pleased at his  compliment, \"if you want to do the thing in style. Maybe you will find a  letter or bill head in the mail at the same time that you get your  sample check. If you do, you can have it copied and write your request  for the check book and your order for the goods on paper printed  exactly like it. That gives a sort of final touch, you know. I remember  we did that with a dentist named Budd, at 137 West Twenty-second  Street.\" (Fig. 3.)    \"You've got all the rest whipped to a standstill,\" cried Peabody.    \"Well, just come over to the room and I'll show you something worth  while,\" exclaimed the girl, getting up and paying their bill.    \"Now,\" said she, when they were safely at no West Thirty-eighth Street,  and she had closed the door of the room and drawn Peabody to a desk in  the bay window. \"Here's my regular handwriting.\"    She pulled towards her a pad which lay open upon the desk and wrote in a  fair, round hand:    \"Mrs. James D. Singley.\" (Fig. 4.)    \"This,\" she continued, changing her slant and dashing off a queer  feminine scrawl, \"is the signature we fooled the Lincoln National Bank  with--Miss Kauser's, you know. And this,\" she added a moment later,  adopting a stiff, shaky, hump-backed orthography, \"is the signature that  got poor Jim into all this trouble,\" and she inscribed twice upon the  paper the name \"E. Bierstadt.\" \"Poor Jim!\" she added to herself.    \"By George, Mabel,\" remarked the detective, \"you're a wonder! See if  you can copy _my_ name.\" And Peabody wrote the assumed name of William  Hickey, first with a stub and then with a fine point, both of which  signatures she copied like a flash, in each case, however, being guilty  of the lapse of spelling the word Willia_m_ \"Willia_n_.\"    The pad now contained more than enough evidence to convict twenty women,  and Peabody, with the remark, \"You don't want to leave this kind of  thing lying around, Mabel,\" pretended to tear the page up, but  substituted a blank sheet in its place and smuggled the precious bit of  paper into his pocket.    \"Yes, I'll go into business with you,--sure I will!\" said Peabody.    \"And we'll get enough money to set Jim free!\" exclaimed the girl.    They were now fast friends, and it was agreed that \"Hickey\" should go  and make himself presentable, after which they would dine at some  restaurant and then sample a convenient mail box. Meantime Peabody  telephoned to Headquarters, and when the two set out for dinner at six  o'clock the supposed \"Hickey\" was stopped on Broadway by Detective  Sergeant Clark.    \"What are you doing here in New York?\" demanded Clark. \"Didn't I give  you six hours to fly the coop? And who's this woman?\"    [Illustration: Fig. 4--The upper signature is an example of Mabel  Parker's regular penmanship; the next two are forgeries from memory; and  the last is a dashing imitation of her companion's handwriting.]    \"I was going, Clark, honest I was,\" whined \"Hickey,\" \"and this lady's  all right--she hasn't done a thing.\"    \"Well, I guess I'll have to lock you up at Headquarters for the night,\"  said Clark roughly. \"The girl can go.\"    \"Oh, Mr. Clark, do come and have dinner with us first!\" exclaimed Mrs.  Parker. \"Mr. Hickey has been very good to me, and he hasn't had anything  to eat for ever so long.\"    \"Don't care if I do,\" said Clark. \"I guess I can put up with the company  if the board is good.\"    The three entered the Raleigh Hotel and ordered a substantial meal. With  the arrival of dessert, however, the girl became uneasy, and apparently  fearing arrest herself, slipped a roll of bills under the table to  \"Hickey\" and whispered to him to keep it for her.
