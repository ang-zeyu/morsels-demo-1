[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13821"],[0,"Tales of Wonder (#2)"],[1,"foxes used to leave them and go right away  out of the county and they never returned. I think they went by night  and moved great distances. Well it was early April and we had drawn  blank all day, and at the last draw of all, the very last of the  season, we found a fox. He left the covert with his back to London and  its railways and villas and wire and slipped away towards the chalk  country and open Kent. I felt as I once felt as a child on one  summer's day when I found a door in a garden where I played left  luckily ajar, and I pushed it open and the wide lands were before me  and waving fields of corn.    We settled down into a steady gallop and the fields began to drift by  under us, and a great wind arose full of fresh breath. We left the  clay lands where the bracken grows and came to a valley at the edge of  the chalk. As we went down into it we saw the fox go up the other side  like a shadow that crosses the evening, and glide into a wood that  stood on the top. We saw a flash of primroses in the wood and we were  out the other side, hounds hunting perfectly and the fox still going  absolutely straight. It began to dawn on me then that we were in for a  great hunt, I took a deep breath when I thought of it; the taste of  the air of that perfect Spring afternoon as it came to one galloping,  and the thought of a great run, were together like some old rare wine.  Our faces now were to another valley, large fields led down to it,  with easy hedges, at the bottom of it a bright blue stream went  singing and a rambling village smoked, the sunlight on the opposite  slopes danced like a fairy; and all along the top old woods were  frowning, but they dreamed of Spring. The \"field\" had fallen of and  were far behind and my only human companion was James, my old first  whip, who had a hound's instinct, and a personal animosity against a  fox that even embittered his speech.    Across the valley the fox went as straight as a railway line, and  again we went without a check straight through the woods at the top. I  remember hearing men sing or shout as they walked home from work, and  sometimes children whistled; the sounds came up from the village to  the woods at the top of the valley. After that we saw no more  villages, but valley after valley arose and fell before us as though  we were voyaging some strange and stormy sea, and all the way before  us the fox went dead up-wind like the fabulous Flying Dutchman. There  was no one in sight now but my first whip and me, we had both of us  got on to our second horses as we drew the last covert.    Two or three times we checked in those great lonely valleys beyond the  village, but I began to have inspirations, I felt a strange certainty  within me that this fox was going on straight up-wind till he died or  until night came and we could hunt no longer, so I reversed ordinary  methods and only cast straight ahead and always we picked up the scent  again at once. I believe that this fox was the last one left in the  villa-haunted lands and that he was prepared to leave them for remote  uplands far from men, that if we had come the following day he would  not have been there, and that we just happened to hit off his journey.    Evening began to descend upon the valleys, still the hounds drifted  on, like the lazy but unresting shadows of clouds upon a summer's day,  we heard a shepherd calling to his dog, we saw two maidens move  towards a hidden farm, one of them singing softly; no other sounds,  but ours, disturbed the leisure and the loneliness of haunts that  seemed not yet to have known the inventions of steam and gun-powder  (even as China, they say, in some of her further mountains does not  yet know that she has fought Japan).    And now the day and our horses were wearing out, but that resolute fox  held on. I began to work out the run and to wonder where we were. The  last landmark I had ever seen before must have been over five miles  back and from there to the start was at least ten miles more. If only  we could kill! Then the sun set. I wondered what chance we had of  killing our fox. I looked at James' face as he rode beside me. He did  not seem to have lost any confidence yet his horse was as tired as  mine. It was a good clear twilight and the scent was as strong as  ever, and the fences were easy enough, but those valleys were terribly  trying and they still rolled on and on. It looked as if the light  would outlast all possible endurance both of the fox and the horses,  if the scent held good and he did not go to ground, otherwise night  would end it. For long we had seen no houses and no roads, only chalk  slopes with the twilight on them, and here and there some sheep, and  scattered copses darkening in the evening. At some moment I seemed to  realise all at once that the light was spent and that darkness was  hovering, I looked at James, he was solemnly shaking his head.  Suddenly in a little wooded valley we saw climb over the oaks the  red-brown gables of a queer old house, at that instant I saw the fox  scarcely heading by fifty yards. We blundered through a wood into full  sight of the house, but no avenue led up to it or even a path nor were  there any signs of wheel-marks anywhere. Already lights shone here and  there in windows. We were in a park, and a fine park, but unkempt  beyond credibility; brambles grew everywhere. It was too dark to see  the fox any more but we knew he was dead beat, the hounds were just  before us,--and a four-foot railing of oak. I shouldn't have tried it  on a fresh horse the beginning of a run, and here was a horse near his  last gasp. But what a run! an event standing out in a lifetime, and  the hounds close up on their fox, slipping into the darkness as I  hesitated. I decided to try it. My horse rose about eight inches and  took it fair with his breast, and the oak log flew into handfuls of  wet decay--it rotten with years. And then we were on a lawn and at the  far end of it the hounds were tumbling over their fox. Fox, hounds and  light were all done together at the of a twenty-mile point. We made  some noise then, but nobody came out of the queer old house.    I felt pretty stiff as I walked round to the hall door with the mask  and the brush while James went with the hounds and the two horses to  look for the stables. I rang a bell marvellously encrusted with rust,  and after a long while the door opened a little way revealing a hall  with much old armour in it and the shabbiest butler that I have ever  known.    I asked him who lived there. Sir Richard Arlen. I explained that my  horse could go no further that night and that I wished to ask Sir  Richard Arlen for a bed for the night.    \"O, no one ever comes here, sir,\" said the butler.    I pointed out that I had come.    \"I don't think it would be possible, sir,\" he said.    This annoyed me and I asked to see Sir Richard, and insisted until he  came. Then I apologised and explained the situation. He looked only  fifty, but a 'Varsity oar on the wall with the date of the early  seventies, made him older than that; his face had something of the shy  look of the hermit; he regretted that he had not room to put me up. I  was sure that this was untrue, also I had to be put up there, there  was nowhere else within miles, so I almost insisted. Then to my  astonishment he turned to the butler and they talked it over in an  undertone. At last they seemed to think that they could manage it,  though clearly with reluctance. It was by now seven o' clock and Sir  Richard told me he dined at half past seven. There was no question of  clothes for me other than those I stood in, as my host was shorter and  broader. He showed me presently to the drawing-room and there he  reappeared before half past seven in evening dress and a white  waistcoat. The drawing-room was large and contained old furniture but  it was rather worn than venerable, an Aubusson carpet flapped about  the floor, the wind seemed momently to enter the room, and old  draughts haunted corners; the stealthy feet of rats that were never at  rest indicated the extent of the ruin that time had wrought in the  wainscot; somewhere far off a shutter flapped to and fro, the  guttering candles were insufficient to light so large a room. The  gloom that these things suggested was quite in keeping with Sir  Richard's first remark to me after he entered the room: \"I must tell  you, sir, that I have led a wicked life. O, a very wicked life.\"    Such confidences from a man much older than oneself after one has  known him for half an hour are so rare that any possible answer merely  does not suggest itself. I said rather slowly, \"O, really,\" and  chiefly to forestall another such remark I said \"What a charming house  you have.\"    \"Yes,\" he said, \"I have not left it for nearly forty years. Since I  left the 'Varsity. One is young there, you know, and one has  opportunities; but I make no excuses, no excuses.\" And the door  slipping its rusty latch, came drifting on the draught into the room,  and the long carpet flapped and the hangings upon the walls, then the  draught fell rustling away and the door slammed to again.    \"Ah, Marianne,\" he said, \"we have a guest to-night. Mr. Linton. This  is Marianne Gib.\" And everything became clear to me. \"Mad,\" I said to  myself, for no one had entered the room.    The rats ran up the length of the room behind the wainscot  ceaselessly, and the wind unlatched the door again and the folds of  the carpet fluttered up to our feet and stopped there, for our weight  held it down.    \"Let me introduce Mr. Linton,\" said my host--\"Lady Mary Errinjer.\"    The door slammed back again. I bowed politely. Even had I been invited  I should have humoured him, but it was the very least that an  uninvited guest could do.    This kind of thing happened eleven times, the rustling, and the  fluttering of the carpet and the footsteps of the rats, and the  restless door, and then the sad"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13831"],[0,"Evolution Of The Japanese, Social And Psychic (#2)"],[1,"lums--Treatment of  horses--Torture in Old Japan--Crucifixion and transfixion by  spears--Hard-heartedness cultivated under feudalism--Cruelty and the  humane feelings in the Occident--Abolition of cruel customs in ancient  and in Old Japan--Cruelty a sociological, not a biological  characteristic--The rise of humane feelings--Doctors and  hospitals--Philanthropy, 127      XII.
