The histories of the Lost Cause are all written out by \"big bugs,\"  generals and renowned historians, and like the fellow who called a turtle  a \"cooter,\" being told that no such word as cooter was in Webster's  dictionary, remarked that he had as much right to make a dictionary as  Mr. Webster or any other man; so have I to write a history.    But in these pages I do not pretend to write the history of the war.  I only give a few sketches and incidents that came under the observation  of a \"high private\" in the rear ranks of the rebel army.  Of course,  the histories are all correct.  They tell of great achievements of great  men, who wear the laurels of victory; have grand presents given them;  high positions in civil life; presidents of corporations; governors of  states; official positions, etc., and when they die, long obituaries are  published, telling their many virtues, their distinguished victories,  etc., and when they are buried, the whole country goes in mourning and is  called upon to buy an elegant monument to erect over the remains of so  distinguished and brave a general, etc.  But in the following pages I  propose to tell of the fellows who did the shooting and killing, the  fortifying and ditching, the sweeping of the streets, the drilling,  the standing guard, picket and videt, and who drew (or were to draw)  eleven dollars per month and rations, and also drew the ramrod and tore  the cartridge.  Pardon me should I use the personal pronoun \"I\" too  frequently, as I do not wish to be called egotistical, for I only write  of what I saw as an humble private in the rear rank in an infantry  regiment, commonly called \"webfoot.\"  Neither do I propose to make this  a connected journal, for I write entirely from memory, and you must  remember, kind reader, that these things happened twenty years ago,  and twenty years is a long time in the life of any individual.    I was twenty-one years old then, and at that time I was not married.  Now I have a house full of young \"rebels,\" clustering around my knees and  bumping against my elbow, while I write these reminiscences of the war  of secession, rebellion, state rights, slavery, or our rights in the  territories, or by whatever other name it may be called.  These are all  with the past now, and the North and South have long ago \"shaken hands  across the bloody chasm.\"  The flag of the Southern cause has been furled  never to be again unfurled; gone like a dream of yesterday, and lives  only in the memory of those who lived through those bloody days and times.      EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY-ONE    Reader mine, did you live in that stormy period?  In the year of our Lord  eighteen hundred and sixty-one, do you remember those stirring times?  Do you recollect in that year, for the first time in your life, of  hearing Dixie and the Bonnie Blue Flag?  Fort Sumter was fired upon  from Charleston by troops under General Beauregard, and Major Anderson,  of the Federal army, surrendered.  The die was cast; war was declared;  Lincoln called for troops from Tennessee and all the Southern states,  but Tennessee, loyal to her Southern sister states, passed the ordinance  of secession, and enlisted under the Stars and Bars.  From that day on,  every person, almost, was eager for the war, and we were all afraid it  would be over and we not be in the fight.  Companies were made up,  regiments organized; left, left, left, was heard from morning till night.  By the right flank, file left, march, were familiar sounds.  Everywhere  could be seen Southern cockades made by the ladies and our sweethearts.  And some who afterwards became Union men made the most fiery secession  speeches.  Flags made by the ladies were presented to companies, and to  hear the young orators tell of how they would protect that flag, and that  they would come back with the flag or come not at all, and if they fell  they would fall with their backs to the field and their feet to the foe,  would fairly make our hair stand on end with intense patriotism, and we  wanted to march right off and whip twenty Yankees.  But we soon found out  that the glory of war was at home among the ladies and not upon the field  of blood and carnage of death, where our comrades were mutilated and torn  by shot and shell.  And to see the cheek blanch and to hear the fervent  prayer, aye, I might say the agony of mind were very different indeed  from the patriotic times at home.      CAMP CHEATHAM    After being drilled and disciplined at Camp Cheatham, under the  administrative ability of General R. C. Foster, 3rd, for two months, we,  the First, Third and Eleventh Tennessee Regiments--Maney, Brown and Rains--  learned of the advance of McClelland's army into Virginia, toward  Harper's Ferry and Bull Run.    The Federal army was advancing all along the line.  They expected to  march right into the heart of the South, set the negroes free, take our  property, and whip the rebels back into the Union.  But they soon found  that secession was a bigger mouthful than they could swallow at one  gobble.  They found the people of the South in earnest.    Secession may have been wrong in the abstract, and has been tried and  settled by the arbitrament of the sword and bayonet, but I am as firm in  my convictions today of the right of secession as I was in 1861.  The  South is our country, the North is the country of those who live there.  We are an agricultural people; they are a manufacturing people.  They are  the descendants of the good old Puritan Plymouth Rock stock, and we of  the South from the proud and aristocratic stock of Cavaliers.  We believe  in the doctrine of State rights, they in the doctrine of centralization.    John C. Calhoun, Patrick Henry, and Randolph, of Roanoke, saw the venom  under their wings, and warned the North of the consequences, but they  laughed at them.  We only fought for our State rights, they for Union and  power.  The South fell battling under the banner of State rights, but  yet grand and glorious even in death.  Now, reader, please pardon the  digression.  It is every word that we will say in behalf of the rights of  secession in the following pages.  The question has been long ago settled  and is buried forever, never in this age or generation to be resurrected.    The vote of the regiment was taken, and we all voted to go to Virginia.  The Southern Confederacy had established its capital at Richmond.    A man by the name of Jackson, who kept a hotel in Maryland, had raised  the Stars and Bars, and a Federal officer by the name of Ellsworth tore  it down, and Jackson had riddled his body with buckshot from a double-  barreled shotgun.  First blood for the South.    Everywhere the enemy were advancing; the red clouds of war were booming  up everywhere, but at this particular epoch, I refer you to the history  of that period.    A private soldier is but an automaton, a machine that works by the  command of a good, bad, or indifferent engineer, and is presumed to know  nothing of all these great events.  His business is to load and shoot,  stand picket, videt, etc., while the officers sleep, or perhaps die on  the field of battle and glory, and his obituary and epitaph but \"one\"  remembered among the slain, but to what company, regiment, brigade or  corps he belongs, there is no account; he is soon forgotten.    A long line of box cars was drawn up at Camp Cheatham one morning in July,  the bugle sounded to strike tents and to place everything on board the  cars.  We old comrades have gotten together and laughed a hundred times  at the plunder and property that we had accumulated, compared with our  subsequent scanty wardrobe.  Every soldier had enough blankets, shirts,  pants and old boots to last a year, and the empty bottles and jugs would  have set up a first-class drug store.  In addition, every one of us had  his gun, cartridge-box, knapsack and three days' rations, a pistol on  each side and a long Bowie knife, that had been presented to us by  William Wood, of Columbia, Tenn.  We got in and on top of the box cars,  the whistle sounded, and amid the waving of hats, handkerchiefs and flags,  we bid a long farewell and forever to old Camp Cheatham.    Arriving at Nashville, the citizens turned out _en masse_ to receive us,  and here again we were reminded of the good old times and the \"gal we  left behind us.\"  Ah, it is worth soldiering to receive such welcomes as  this.    The Rev. Mr. Elliott invited us to his college grove, where had been  prepared enough of the good things of earth to gratify the tastes of the  most fastidious epicure.  And what was most novel, we were waited on by  the most beautiful young ladies (pupils of his school).  It was charming,  I tell you.  Rev. C. D. Elliott was our Brigade Chaplain all through the  war, and Dr. C. T. Quintard the Chaplain of the First Tennessee Regiment--  two of the best men who ever lived.  (Quintard is the present Bishop of  Tennessee).      ON THE ROAD    Leaving Nashville, we went bowling along twenty or thirty miles an hour,  as fast as steam could carry us.  At every town and station citizens and  ladies were waving their handkerchiefs and hurrahing for Jeff Davis and  the Southern Confederacy.  Magnificent banquets were prepared for us all  along the entire route.  It was one magnificent festival from one end of  the line to the other.  At Chattanooga, Knoxville, Bristol, Farmville,  Lynchburg, everywhere, the same demonstrations of joy and welcome greeted  us.  Ah, those were glorious times; and you, reader, see why the old  soldier loves to live over again that happy period.    But the Yankees are advancing on Manassas.  July 21st finds us a hundred  miles from that fierce day's battle.  That night, after the battle is  fought and won, our train draws up at Manassas Junction.    Well, what news?

He  had never had one like it before. \"It is a fairy tale,\" he said.    Just as dessert came on, the door opened and in rushed mamma and papa;  the train had gotten in, after all. They were so glad to see their  darlings happy instead of moping that they gave them each some extra  kisses. You may be sure little Guido never went hungry and barefoot  after that. Long afterward he would say: \"That was a fairy Christmas!\"    That night, after Tita had said her prayers, she said:    \"Mamma, I know something. Whenever you feel sad and lonely, if you  will just find somebody sadder and lonelier than yourself and cheer  them up, it will make you all right.\"    And I think that that was the very best kind of a Christmas lesson of  love. Don't you?    ETHELDRED B. BARRY.          THE BALL GAME.      Did you ever know a boy    Make believe he had a toy?            That's the way            Babies play;    Babies who are young and small    Make believe they play at ball!          CHRISTMAS DAY.      \"Boys,\" said Mrs. Howard one morning, looking up from a letter she was  reading, \"I have had a letter from your grandmamma. She writes that  she is returning to England shortly.\"    The boys went on with their breakfast without showing any great amount  of interest in this piece of news, for they had never seen their  grandmother, and therefore could not very well be expected to show any  affection for her.    Now Mrs. Howard, the mother of two of the boys and aunt to the third  little fellow, was a widow and very poor, and often found it a hard  task to provide for her \"three boys,\" as she called them, for, having  adopted her little orphan nephew, she always treated him as her own  son. She had sometimes thought it strange that old Mrs. Howard should  not have offered to provide for Leslie herself but she had never done  so, and at last Mrs. Howard had ceased to expect it. But now, right at  the end of her letter, Grandmamma Howard wrote:--    \"I have been thinking that perhaps it would come a little hard on you  to support not only your own two boys, but poor Alice's son, and so,  on my return to England, I propose, if you are willing, to adopt one  of them, for I am a lonely old woman and shall be glad of a young face  about me again.\"    After thinking the matter over, Mrs. Howard decided she would say  nothing about their grandmother's intention to the boys, as she  thought that it was just possible she might change her mind again.    Time passed on, and winter set in, and full of the delights of  skating, the boys forgot all about the expected arrival of their  grandmother.    During the Christmas holidays the boys one morning started off to  Broome Meadow for a good day's skating on the pond there. They carried  their dinner with them, and were told to be sure and be home before  dark.    As they ran along the frosty road they came suddenly upon a poor old  woman, so suddenly that Leslie ran right up against her before he  could stop himself. The old woman grumbled about \"lazy, selfish boys,  only thinking of their own pleasure, and not caring what happened to a  poor old woman!\"    But Leslie stopped at once and apologized, in his polite little way,  for his carelessness.    \"I _am_ sorry,\" he said. \"I hope I did not hurt you; and you have such  heavy parcels to carry too. Won't you let me help you?\"    \"Oh! come on, Leslie,\" said his cousins; \"we shall never get to the  pond at this rate!\"    \"Yes, go on,\" said the old woman sharply; \"your skating is of a great  deal more importance than an old woman, eh?\"    But Leslie's only answer was to take the parcels and trudge merrily  along beside his companion.    On the way to her cottage the old woman asked him all sorts of  questions about himself and his cousins, and then, having reached her  cottage, dismissed him with scarcely a \"thank you\" for the trouble he  had taken. But Leslie did not take it much to heart.    He raced along, trying his hardest to overtake his cousins before they  reached the pond, and was soon skimming about with the rest of them.    Squire Leaholme, in whose grounds the boys were skating, afterwards  came down to the pond to watch the fun, and, being a kind-hearted old  gentleman, offered to give a prize of a new pair of skates to the boy  who should win the greatest number of races.    As it was getting late, it was arranged that the racing should come  off on the following day, and the Squire invited all the boys who took  part in it, to come up to his house to a substantial tea, after the  fun was over.    How delighted Leslie was, for he was a first-rate skater, and he _did_  so want a new pair of skates!    But the Squire's skates were not to be won by him, for on the  following day as he and his cousins were on their way to the pond,  they came across the queer old woman whom they had met on the previous  day.    She was sitting on the ground, and seemed to be in great pain. The  boys stopped to ask what ailed her, and she told them that she had  slipped and twisted her foot, and was afraid that her ankle was  sprained, for she could not bear to put it to the ground.    [Illustration: FROM THE CHRISTMAS TREE.]    \"You musn't sit here in the cold,\" said Leslie; \"come, try and get up,  and I will help you home.\"    \"Oh! Leslie,\" cried both his cousins, \"don't go. You will be late for  the races, and lose your chance of the prize.\"    Poor Leslie! He turned first red, then white, and then said, in a  husky tone of voice--    \"Never mind--you go on without me.\"    \"You're a good laddie,\" said the old woman. \"Will you be _very_ sorry  to miss the fun?\"    Leslie muttered something about not minding _much_, and then the brave  little fellow set himself to help the poor old woman home, as gently  and tenderly as he could.    She would not let him come in with her, but told him to run off as  quickly as he could, and perhaps after all, he would not be too late  for the skating. But Leslie could not bear to leave her alone and in  pain, so he decided to run home and fetch his Aunt.    When Mrs. Howard arrived at the cottage, you can think how surprised  she was to find that Leslie's \"poor old woman\" was none other than  Grandmamma Howard herself, who wishing to find out the real characters  of her grandsons, had chosen to come in this disguise to the little  village where they lived.    You will easily guess which of the three boys Grandmamma chose to be  her little companion. And oh! what a lovely Grandmamma she was, as not  only Leslie, but his cousins too, found out. She always seemed to know  exactly what a boy wanted, and still better, to give it to him.    Walter and Stanley often felt terribly ashamed of the selfish manner  in which they had behaved, and wished they were more like Leslie.    But Grandmamma told them that it was \"never too late to mend,\" and  they took her advice, and I am quite sure that at the present moment  if they were to meet a poor old woman in distress by the roadside,  they would not pass her by, as they once did Grandmamma Howard.    ANNA MORRISON.          THE DOLLS' CHRISTMAS PARTY.      It was the week before Christmas, and the dolls In the toy-shop played  together all night. The biggest one was from Paris.    One night she said, \"We ought to have a party before Santa Claus  carries us away to the little girls. I can dance, and I will show you  how.\"    \"I can dance myself if you will pull the string,\" said a \"Jim Crow\"  doll.    \"What shall we have for supper?\" piped a little boy-doll in a Jersey  suit. He was always thinking about eating.    \"Oh, dear,\" cried the French lady, \"I don't know what we shall do for  supper!\"    \"I can get the supper,\" added a big rag doll. The other dolls had  never liked her very well, but they thanked her now. She had taken  lessons at a cooking-school, and knew how to make cake and candy.  She gave French names to everything she made, and this made it taste  better. Old Mother Hubbard was there, and she said the rag doll did  not know how to cook anything.    They danced in one of the great shop-windows. They opened a toy piano,  and a singing-doll played \"Comin' through the Rye,\" The dolls did  not find that a good tune to dance by; but the lady did not know any  other, although she was the most costly doll in the shop. Then they  wound up a music-box, and danced by that. This did very well for some  tunes; but they had to walk around when it played \"Hail Columbia,\" and  wait for something else.    The \"Jim Crow\" doll had to dance by himself, for he could do nothing  but a \"break-down.\" He would not dance at all unless some one pulled  his string. A toy monkey did this; but he would not stop when the  dancer was tired.    They had supper on one of the counters. The rag doll placed some boxes  for tables. The supper was of candy, for there was nothing in the shop  to eat but sugar hearts and eggs. The dolls like candy better than  anything else, and the supper was splendid. Patsy McQuirk said he  could not eat candy. He wanted to know what kind of a supper it  was without any potatoes. He got very angry, put his hands into his  pockets, and smoked his pipe. It was very uncivil for him to do so in  company. The smoke made the little ladies sick, and they all tried to  climb into a \"horn of plenty\" to get out of the way.    Mother Hubbard and the two black waiters tried to sing \"I love Little  Pussy;\" but the tall one in a brigand hat opened his mouth wide,  that the small dollies were afraid they might fall into it. The clown  raised both arms in wonder, and Jack in the Box sprang up as high as  me could to look down into the fellow's throat.    All the baby-dolls in caps and long dresses had been put to bed. They  woke up when the others were at supper, and began to cry. The big doll  brought them some candy, and that kept them quiet for some time.    The next morning a little girl found the toy piano open. She was sure  the dolls had been playing on it. The"]]]
