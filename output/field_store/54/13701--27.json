He increased  also the number of Jewish inhabitants, for following his conquest of  Palestine (or Coele-Syria, as it was then called), he brought back to  his capital a large number of Jewish families and settled thirty  thousand Jewish soldiers in garrisons. For the next hundred years the  Palestinian and Egyptian Jews were under the same rule, and for the  most part the Ptolemies treated them well. They were easy-going and  tolerant, and while they encouraged the higher forms of Greek culture,  art, letters, and philosophy, both at their own court and through  their dominions, they made no attempt to impose on their subjects the  Greek religion and ceremonial. Under their tolerant sway the Jewish  community thrived, and became distinguished in the handicrafts as well  as in commerce. Two of the five sections into which Alexandria was  divided were almost exclusively occupied by them; these lay in the  north-east along the shore and near the royal palace--a favorable  situation for the large commercial enterprises in which they were  engaged. The Jews had full permission to carry on their religious  observances, and besides many smaller places of worship, each marked  by its surrounding plantation of trees, they built a great synagogue,  of which it is said in the Talmud, \"He who has not seen it has not  seen the glory of Israel.\"[3] It was in the form of a basilica, with a  double row of columns, and so vast that an official standing upon a  platform had to wave his head-cloth or veil to inform the people at  the back of the edifice when to say \"Amen\" in response to the Reader.  The congregation was seated according to trade-guilds, as was also  customary during the Middle Ages; the goldsmiths, silversmiths,  coppersmiths, and weavers had their own places, for the Alexandrian  Jews seem to have partially adopted the Egyptian caste-system. The  Jews enjoyed a large amount of self-government, having their own  governor, the ethnarch, and in Roman times their own council  (Sanhedrin), which administered their own code of laws. Of the  ethnarch Strabo says that he was like an independent ruler, and it was  his function to secure the proper fulfilment of duties by the  community and compliance with their peculiar laws.[4] Thus the people  formed a sort of state within a state, preserving their national life  in the foreign environment. They possessed as much political  independence as the Palestinian community when under Roman rule; and  enjoyed all the advantages without any of the narrowing influences,  physical or intellectual, of a ghetto. They were able to remain an  independent body, and foster a Jewish spirit, a Jewish view of life, a  Jewish culture, while at the same time they assimilated the different  culture of the Greeks around them, and took their part in the general  social and political life.    At the end of the third and the beginning of the second century  Palestine was a shuttlecock tossed between the Ptolemies and the  Seleucids; but in the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes (_c._ 150 B.C.E.)  it finally passed out of the power of the Ptolemaic house, and from  this time the Palestinian Jews had a different political history from  the Egyptian. The compulsory Hellenization by Antiochus aroused the  best elements of the Jewish nation, which had seemed likely to lose by  a gradual assimilation its adherence to pure monotheism and the Mosaic  law. The struggle of foe as against the Hellenizing party of his own  people, which, led by the high priests Jason, Menelaus, and Alcimus,  tried to crush both the national and the religious spirit. The  Maccabaean rule brought not only a renaissance of national life and  national culture, but also a revival of the national religion. Before,  however, the deliverance of the Jews had been accomplished by the  noble band of brothers, many of the faithful Palestinian families had  fled for protection from the tyranny of Antiochus to the refuge of his  enemy Ptolemy Philometor. Among the fugitives were Onias and  Dositheus, who, according to Josephus,[5] became the trusted leaders  of the armies of the Egyptian monarch. Onias, moreover, was the  rightful successor to the high-priesthood, and despairing of obtaining  his dignity in Jerusalem, where the office had been given to the  worthless Hellenist Alcimus, he conceived the idea of setting up a  local centre of the Jewish religion in the country of his exile. He  persuaded Ptolemy to grant him a piece of territory upon which he  might build a temple for Jewish worship, assuring him that his action  would have the effect of securing forever the loyalty of his Jewish  subjects. Ptolemy \"gave him a place one hundred and eighty furlongs  distant from Memphis, in the nomos of Heliopolis, where he built a  fortress and a temple, not like that at Jerusalem, but such as  resembled a tower.\"[6] Professor Flinders Petrie has recently  discovered remains at Tell-el-Yehoudiyeh, the \"mound of the Jews,\"  near the ancient Leontopolis, which tally with the description of  Josephus, and may be presumed to be the ruins of the temple.    It is difficult to arrive at an accurate idea of the nature and  importance of the Onias temple, because our chief authority,  Josephus,[7] gives two inconsistent accounts of it, and the Talmud  references[8] are equally involved. But certain negative facts are  clear. First, the temple did not become, even if it were designed to  be, a rival to the temple of Jerusalem: it did not diminish in any way  the tribute which the Egyptian Jews paid to the sacred centre of the  religion. They did not cease to send their tithes for the benefit of  the poor in Judaea, or their representatives to the great festivals,  and they dispatched messengers each year with contributions of gold  and silver, who, says Philo,[9] \"travelled over almost impassable  roads, which they looked upon as easy, in that they led them to  piety.\" The Alexandrian-Jewish writers, without exception, are silent  about the work of Onias; Philo does not give a single hint of it, and  on the other hand speaks[10] several times of the great national  centre at Jerusalem as \"the most beautiful and renowned temple which  is honored by the whole East and West.\" The Egyptian Jews, according  to Josephus, claimed that the prophecy of Isaiah had been  accomplished, \"that there shall be an altar to the Lord in the midst  of the land of Egypt\" (Is. xix. 19). But the altar, it has recently  been suggested,[11] was rather a \"Bamah\" (a high place) than a temple.  It served as a temporary sanctuary while the Jerusalem temple was  defiled, and afterwards it was a place where the priestly ritual was  carried out day by day, and offerings were brought by those who could  not make the pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Though the synagogue was the  main seat of religious life in the Diaspora, there was still a desire  for the sacrificial worship, and for a long time the rabbis looked  with favor upon the establishment of Onias. But when the tendency to  found a new ritual there showed itself, they denied its holiness.[12]  The religious importance of the temple, however, was never great, and  its chief interest is that it shows the survival of the affection for  the priestly service among the Hellenized community, and helps  therefore to disprove the myth that the Alexandrians allegorized away  the Levitical laws.    During the checkered history of Egypt in the first century B.C.E.,  when it was in turn the plaything of the corrupt Roman Senate, who  supported the claims of a series of feeble puppet-Ptolemies, the prize  of the warriors, who successively aspired to be masters of the world,  Julius Caesar, Mark Antony, and Octavian, and finally a province of the  Roman Empire, the political and material prosperity of the Alexandrian  Jews remained for the most part undisturbed. Julius Caesar and  Augustus, who everywhere showed special favor to their Jewish  subjects, confirmed the privileges of full citizenship and limited  self-government which the early Ptolemies had bestowed.[13] Josephus  records a letter of Augustus to the Jewish community at Cyrene, in  which he ordains: \"Since the nation of the Jews hath been found  grateful to the Roman people, it seemed good to me and my counsellors  that the Jews have liberty to make use of their own customs, and that  their sacred money be not touched, but sent to Jerusalem, and that  they be not obliged to go before the judge on the Sabbath day nor on  the day of preparation for it after the ninth hour,\" _i.e._, after the  early evening.[14] This decree is typical of the emperor's attitude to  his Jewish subjects; and Egypt became more and more a favored home of  the race, so that the Jewish population in the land, from the Libyan  desert to the border of Ethiopia, was estimated in Philo's time at not  less than one million.[15]    The prosperity and privileges of the Jews, combined with their  peculiar customs and their religious separateness, did not fail at  Alexandria, as they have not failed in any country of the Diaspora, to  arouse the mixed envy and dislike of the rude populace, and give a  handle to the agitations of self-seeking demagogues. The third book of  the Maccabees tells of a Ptolemaic persecution during which Jewish  victims were turned into the arena at Alexandria, to be trodden down  by elephants made fierce with the blood of grapes, and of their  deliverance by Divine Providence. Some fiction is certainly mixed with  this recital, but it may well be that during the rule of the stupid  and cruel usurper Ptolemy Physcon (_c._ 120 B.C.E.) the protection of  the royal house was for political reasons removed for a time from the  Jews. Josephus[16] relates that the anniversary of the deliverance was  celebrated as a festival in Egypt.

If  she didn't want the doll, why the deuce had she made such a point of  getting it? He was perhaps on the verge of putting this question to  her, when, waving her hand to include both stockings, she said \"Of  course, my dear, you _do_ see. There they are, and you know I know  you know we wouldn't, either of us, dip a finger into them.\" With a  vibrancy of tone that seemed to bring her voice quite close to him,  \"One doesn't,\" she added, \"violate the shrine--pick the pearl from the  shell!\"    Even had the answering question \"Doesn't one just?\" which for an  instant hovered on the tip of his tongue, been uttered, it could not  have obscured for Keith the change which her magnificence had wrought  in him. Something, perhaps, of the bigotry of the convert was already  discernible in the way that, averting his eyes, he said \"One doesn't  even peer.\" As to whether, in the years that have elapsed since he  said this either of our friends (now adult) has, in fact, \"peered,\" is  a question which, whenever I call at the house, I am tempted to put  to one or other of them. But any regret I may feel in my invariable  failure to \"come up to the scratch\" of yielding to this temptation is  balanced, for me, by my impression--my sometimes all but throned and  anointed certainty--that the answer, if vouchsafed, would be in the  negative.

I had spent Christmas Eve at the Club, listening to a grand pow-wow  between certain of the choicer sons of Adam. Then Slushby had cut  in. Slushby is one who writes to newspapers and is theirs obediently  \"HUMANITARIAN.\" When Slushby cuts in, men remember they have to be up  early next morning.    Sharp round a corner on the way home, I collided with something firmer  than the regulation pillar-box. I righted myself after the recoil  and saw some stars that were very pretty indeed. Then I perceived the  nature of the obstruction.    \"Evening, Judlip,\" I said sweetly, when I had collected my hat from  the gutter. \"Have I broken the law, Judlip? If so, I'll go quiet.\"    \"Time yer was in bed,\" grunted X, 36. \"Yer Ma'll be lookin' out for  yer.\"    This from the friend of my bosom! It hurt. Many were the night-beats  I had been privileged to walk with Judlip, imbibing curious lore that  made glad the civilian heart of me. Seven whole 8x5 inch note-books  had I pitmanised to the brim with Judlip. And now to be repulsed as  one of the uninitiated! It hurt horrid.    There is a thing called Dignity. Small boys sometimes stand on it.  Then they have to be kicked. Then they get down, weeping. I don't  stand on Dignity.    \"What's wrong, Judlip?\" I asked, more sweetly than ever. \"Drawn a  blank to-night?\"    \"Yuss. Drawn a blank blank blank. 'Avent 'ad so much as a kick at a  lorst dorg. Christmas Eve ain't wot it was.\" I felt for my note-book.  \"Lawd! I remembers the time when the drunks and disorderlies down this  street was as thick as flies on a fly-paper. One just picked 'em orf  with one's finger and thumb. A bloomin' battew, that's wot it wos.\"    \"The night's yet young, Judlip,\" I insinuated, with a jerk of my thumb  at the flaring windows of the \"Rat and Blood Hound.\" At that moment  the saloon-door swung open, emitting a man and woman who walked with  linked arms and exceeding great care.    Judlip eyed them longingly as they tacked up the street. Then he  sighed. Now, when Judlip sighs the sound is like unto that which  issues from the vent of a Crosby boiler when the cog-gauges are at  260 deg. F.    \"Come, Judlip!\" I said. \"Possess your soul in patience. You'll soon  find someone to make an example of. Meanwhile\"--I threw back my head  and smacked my lips--\"the usual, Judlip?\"    In another minute I emerged through the swing-door, bearing a furtive  glass of that same \"usual,\" and nipped down the mews where my friend  was wont to await these little tokens of esteem.    \"To the Majesty of the Law, Judlip!\"    When he had honoured the toast, I scooted back with the glass, leaving  him wiping the beads off his beard-bristles. He was in his philosophic  mood when I rejoined him at the corner.    \"Wot am I?\" he said, as we paced along. \"A bloomin' cypher. Wot's  the sarjint? 'E's got the Inspector over 'im. Over above the  Inspector there's the Sooprintendent. Over above 'im's the old  red-tape-masticatin' Yard. Over above that there's the 'Ome Sec.  Wot's 'e? A cypher, like me. Why?\" Judlip looked up at the stars.  \"Over above 'im's We Dunno Wot. Somethin' wot issues its horders  an' regulations an' divisional injunctions, inscrootable like, but  p'remptory; an' we 'as ter see as 'ow they're carried out, not arskin'  no questions, but each man goin' about 'is dooty.'    \"''Is dooty,'\" said I, looking up from my note-book. \"Yes, I've got  that.\"    \"Life ain't a bean-feast. It's a 'arsh reality. An' them as makes it a  bean-feast 'as got to be 'arshly dealt with accordin'. That's wot the  Force is put 'ere for from Above. Not as 'ow we ain't fallible. We  makes our mistakes. An' when we makes 'em we sticks to 'em. For the  honour o' the Force. Which same is the jool Britannia wears on 'er  bosom as a charm against hanarchy. That's wot the brarsted old Beaks  don't understand. Yer remember Smithers of our Div?\"    I remembered Smithers--well. As fine, upstanding, square-toed,  bullet-headed, clean-living a son of a gun as ever perjured himself in  the box. There was nothing of the softy about Smithers. I took off my  billicock to Smithers' memory.    \"Sacrificed to public opinion? Yuss,\" said Judlip, pausing at a front  door and flashing his 45 c.p. down the slot of a two-grade Yale.  \"Sacrificed to a parcel of screamin' old women wot ort ter 'ave gorn  down on their knees an' thanked Gawd for such a protector. 'E'll be  out in another 'alf year. Wot'll 'e do then, pore devil? Go a bust on  'is conduc' money an' throw in 'is lot with them same hexperts wot 'ad  a 'oly terror of 'im.\" Then Judlip swore gently.    \"What should you do, O Great One, if ever it were your duty to  apprehend him?\"    \"Do? Why, yer blessed innocent, yer don't think I'd shirk a fair clean  cop? Same time, I don't say as 'ow I wouldn't 'andle 'im tender like,  for sake o' wot 'e wos. Likewise cos 'e'd be a stiff customer to  tackle. Likewise 'cos--\"    He had broken off, and was peering fixedly upwards at an angle of 85 deg.  across the moonlit street. \"Ullo!\" he said in a hoarse whisper.    Striking an average between the direction of his eyes--for Judlip,  when on the job, has a soul-stirring squint--I perceived someone in  the act of emerging from a chimney-pot.    Judlip's voice clove the silence. \"Wot are yer doin' hup there?\"    The person addressed came to the edge of the parapet. I saw then that  he had a hoary white beard, a red ulster with the hood up, and what  looked like a sack over his shoulder. He said something or other in a  voice like a concertina that has been left out in the rain.    \"I dessay,\" answered my friend. \"Just you come down, an' we'll see  about that.\"    The old man nodded and smiled. Then--as I hope to be saved--he came  floating gently down through the moonlight, with the sack over his  shoulder and a young fir-tree clasped to his chest. He alighted in a  friendly manner on the curb beside us.    Judlip was the first to recover himself. Out went his right arm, and  the airman was slung round by the scruff of the neck, spilling his  sack in the road. I made a bee-line for his shoulder-blades. Burglar  or no burglar, he was the best airman out, and I was muchly desirous  to know the precise nature of the apparatus under his ulster. A  back-hander from Judlip's left caused me to hop quickly aside. The  prisoner was squealing and whimpering. He didn't like the feel of  Judlip's knuckles at his cervical vertebrae.    \"Wot wos yer doin' hup there?\" asked Judlip, tightening the grip.    \"I'm S-Santa Claus, Sir. P-please, Sir, let me g-go\"    \"Hold him,\" I shouted. \"He's a German.\"    \"It's my dooty ter caution yer that wotever yer say now may be used  in hevidence against yer, yer old sinner. Pick up that there sack, an'  come along o' me.\"    The captive snivelled something about peace on earth, good will toward  men.    \"Yuss,\" said Judlip. \"That's in the Noo Testament, ain't it? The Noo  Testament contains some uncommon nice readin' for old gents an' young  ladies. But it ain't included in the librery o' the Force. We confine  ourselves to the Old Testament--O.T., 'ot. An' 'ot you'll get it. Hup  with that sack, an' quick march!\"    I have seen worse attempts at a neck-wrench, but it was just not  slippery enough for Judlip. And the kick that Judlip then let fly was  a thing of beauty and a joy for ever.    \"Frog's-march him!\" I shrieked, dancing. \"For the love of heaven,  frog's-march him!\"    Trotting by Judlip's side to the Station, I reckoned it out that if  Slushby had not been at the Club I should not have been here to see.  Which shows that even Slushbys are put into this world for a purpose.          OUT OF HARM'S WAY    _By_    A.C.
