This third siege was the most destructive to the castle: the tremendous  artillery had shattered its massive walls; and its demolition was  completed by order of Parliament. Within two months after its reduction,  the buildings were unroofed, and all the materials sold. Thus was this  princely fortress reduced to a heap of ruins.    The Castle of Pontefract was built on an elevated rock, commanding  extensive and picturesque views. The north-west prospect takes in the  beautiful vale along which flows the Aire, skirted by woods and  plantations. It is bounded only by the hills of Craven. The north and east  prospect is more extensive, but the scenery is not equally striking and  impressive. The towers of York Minster are distinctly seen, and the  prospect is only bounded by the limits of vision. To the east--while the  eye follows the course of the Aire towards the Humber, the fertility of  the country, the spires of churches, and two considerable hills, Brayton  Barf, and Hambleton Haugh, which rise in the midst of a plain, and one of  which is covered with wood, increase the beauty of the scene. The  south-east view includes part of the counties of Lincoln and Nottingham.  To the south and south-west, the towering hills of Derbyshire, stretching  towards Lancashire, form the horizon, while the foreground is a  picturesque country variegated with handsome residences.    The Castle, by its situation, as well as by its structure, was rendered  almost impregnable. It was not commanded by any contiguous hills, and it  could only be taken by blockade.    By referring to the Engraving, the reader will better understand this  defence. The outworks are there distinctly shown with the respective posts  and guards: indeed, these lines exhibit a fine specimen of fortification.  The quadrangular enclosure on the crest of the hill, in the lower part of  the Engraving, represents Lamberts' Fort Royal. To the right is the  approach to the castle by the south gate to the barbican, crossed by a  wall, with the middle gate, with the east gate at the extremity of the  line. We next approach, the ballium, or castle yard through the Porter's  Lodge of two towers with a portcullis. The wall of the castle-yard, it  will be seen, has a parapet, and is flanked with towers, and the chapel to  the right of the Lodge. East and West of the yard is seen the  semi-circular moat or ditch; and on an eminence near the western extremity  of the ballium, stands the keep or round tower, the walls of which are  said to have been twenty-one feet thick. The state rooms are on the second  story. The dungeons of the towers are terrific even in description: one  was about 15 feet deep, and scarcely six feet square, without any  admission of light. The whole area occupied by the Pontrefact fortress  seems to have been about 7 acres, now converted into garden ground.    The church seen within the work is that of All Saints, or Allhallows, a  Gothic structure, probably of the time of Henry III., and almost destroyed  in the sieges of the castle.    Pontefract must be numbered in our recollections of childhood; since here  were grown whole fields of liquorice root, from the extract of which are  made. _Pontefract Cakes_, impressed with the arms--three lions passant  gardant, surmounted with a helmet, full-forward, open faced, and  garde-visure. We have likewise seen them impressed with the celebrated  fortress, and the motto \"Post mortem patris pro filio,\"--after the death  of the father--for the son--denoting the loyalty of the Pontefract  Royalists in proclaiming Charles II. at the death of his father.

(_For the Mirror_.)      It is the interest of an indolent man to be honest: for it requires  considerable trouble and finesse, to deceive others successfully.    Money was a wise contrivance to place fools somewhat on a level with men  of sense.    It will be observed, that people have generally the identical faults and  vices they accuse others of; we may instance cowardice.    Wherever a proposition is self-evident, it is but weakening its strength  to bring forward arguments in its support.    It is a melancholy reflection that a glass of wine will do more towards  raising the spirits, than the finest composition ever penned.    It is a great mistake in physiognomists to take outward signs as evidences  of feeling: the seat of real sensation is within.    Wherever art has travelled out of her proper sphere to ape nature, she has  proved herself but a miserable mimic, even in her most approved efforts.    We must not allow ourselves to dwell too seriously on life; for otherwise  we shall be tempted to forego all our plans, to indulge in no future  wishes, and, in short, to live on in torpid apathy.    Books are at last the best companions: they instruct us in silence without  any display of superiority, and they attend the pace of each man's  capacity, without reproaching him for his want of comprehension.    A disgust of life frequently proceeds from sheer vanity, or a wish to be  supposed incapable of deriving gratification from the ordinary routine of  happiness.    It sometimes happens that with men as well as animals, that evidences of  spirit are only the effect of excited fear.

We  now find that the _Legal Observer_ contained such description in March  last, \"collected,\" says the editor, \"with some pains and trouble.\" A  correspondent dropped the _Observer_ leaf into our letter-box in the  course of last week; but, unfortunately, the communication did not reach  us in time for insertion with our Engraving. Good news, we know, usually  comes upon crutches, but we hope our thanks will reach this correspondent  at a better pace.)    The style of architecture of the principal front in Chancery-lane is  purely Grecian. The details and proportions appear to have been founded  upon the best examples of the Ionic order in Athens and Asia Minor,[2] but  they are not servilely copied from any of them.    Mr. Vulliamy, the architect for the Institution, has thrown into this  front the true spirit of the originals; and the effect which the  harmonious proportions of the building produce on the spectator, when  viewing it from Chancery-lane, must have been the result of much  observation and experience in ancient and classic models.    This front, extending nearly sixty feet in width, is of Portland stone. It  consists of four columns and two antae, of the Grecian Ionic order,  supporting an entablature and pediment, and forming together one grand  portico. To give the requisite elevation, the columns and antae are raised  upon pedestals; these, as well as the basement story and podium of the  inner wall of the portico, are of Aberdeen granite; the columns and the  rest of the front are formed of large blocks of Portland stone. In the  front wall, within the portico, there are two ranges of windows above the  basement.    The front in Bell-yard extends nearly eighty feet, and will be finished  with Roman cement, in imitation of stone. It will have a portico of two  columns, and two antae of Portland stone, of the height of the ground  story, which is very lofty, and the width of the entire compartment of the  front. From the interior requiring to be divided into several rooms, this  front must have many windows. The elevation is formed more upon the models  of modern domestic architecture than of ancient public buildings, and  resembles, in its general appearance, one of the palazzi in the Strada  Balbi at Genoa, in the Corso at Rome, or in the Toledo at Naples. In its  details, however, the extravagancies of the middle ages, and the often  elegant frivolities of the _cinque cento_ period, have been avoided, and  the breadth and simplicity of Greek models have still been followed.    The ground plan of the building, by its general arrangement, divides  itself into three parts, which may be distinguished under the heads of the  _Library_, the _Hall_, and the _Club Room_. The first of these (that  towards Chancery-lane) consists, on the ground floor, of a first and  second vestibule, and staircase to the Library, the Secretary's Room, and  Registry Office; and above these on the first floor, the Library,  occupying the height of two stories.    The _Library_ is a large and lofty room, fifty-five feet by thirty-one and  a half, and twenty-three and a half high, divided by a screen of columns  and pilasters of scagliola, into two unequal parts, the first forming a  sort of ante-library to the other; both are surrounded by bookcases of oak,  and a gallery runs round the whole, above which is another range of  bookcases.    The principal light is obtained from a large lantern-light in the ceiling;  but there is a range of windows (double sashed, and glazed with plate  glass) towards Chancery-lane, which also admit light into the lower part.

Never wantonly offend any man however feeble his situation: you know not  how soon his personal interest may be acceptable.    In choosing a wife, a good disposition will be found the most staple  commodity. Most other virtues will flourish in so luxuriant a soil.    It should be the study of every individual to become rather a _useful_  than a _rich_ member of society.    Weak opponents are universally great calumniators.    To adduce an opinion without some argumentative reason to support it,  shows great precipitancy of idea. It is like raising a sumptuous pile  for the mere gratification of witnessing its destruction.    It is not the _enormity_, but the _certainty_, of punishment that deters  mankind from evil. Hope will always gain the ascendancy.    Precept and example are great opposites. The one is generally too  extravagantly lavished: the other abridges more personal comfort than  most people like to sacrifice.    Few individuals are patriotic enough to participate in the correction of  a public abuse, until the corruption produces personal inconvenience.    Flattery will ever, more or less, accompany the first overtures to  friendship. It may not be deemed impolitic if it be found to recede as  the intimacy matures.

Lithe and lysten, gentylmen,    That be of frebore blode,    I shall you tell of a good yeman,    His name was Robyn Hode.    _Old Ballad_.      Centuries have passed away, yet are the merry men of the cross-bow not  forgotten. The oft-told tale of blended theft and charity has run the  round of ages, delighting the homely circle; historians and poets have  found in them a theme suited to their energies, and sung the song of  their exploits to everlasting remembrance. It may be said that few  subjects of yore can boast so bewitching an interest as the present: for  even now, after the lapse of six or seven hundred years, the names of  Robin Hood and Little John are        Familiar in our mouths as household words.      Drayton writes        In this our spacious isle I think there is not one,    But he, of Robin Hood hath heard, and Little John;    And to the end of time the tales shall ne'er be done,    Of Scarlock, George a Green, and Much, the miller's son,    Of Tuck, the merry friar, which many a sermon made    In praise of Robin Hood, his outlaws and their trade.      Robin Hood, from the best accounts, was born at Locksley, in the county  of Nottingham, in the reign of King Henry II., and about the year of  Christ 1160. His extraction was noble, and his true name was Robert  Fitzoothes, which vulgar pronunciation corrupted into Robin Hood. He was  frequently styled, and commonly reputed to have been Earl of Huntington,  descending from Ralph Fitzoothes, a Norman, who came over to England  with William Rufus; marrying Maud, daughter of Gilbert de Gaunt, Earl  of Kyme and Lindsey, to which title in the latter part of his life, he  appears to have had some pretension. In his youth, he is reported to  have been of a wild and extravagant disposition, insomuch that his  inheritance being consumed or forfeited by his excesses, and his person  outlawed for debt, either from necessity or choice, he sought an asylum  in the woods and forests. Or, as some writers state, one of his first  exploits was the going into a forest, when, bearing with him a bow  of exceeding strength, he fell into company with certain rangers or  woodmen, who quarrelled with him for making show to use such a bow as no  man was able to shoot with. Robin replied, that he had two better than  that at Locksley, only he bore that with him now as a byrding bowe.  At length the contention grew so hot that a wager was laid about the  killing of a deer at a great distance, for performance of which Robin  offered to lay his head to a sum of money, the advantage of which rash  speech the others presently took; the mark being found out, one of them,  to make Robin's heart faint, and hand unsteady, when he was about  to shoot, urged him with the loss of head if he missed the mark,  notwithstanding which, Robin killed the deer, and gave every man his  money again, except him who upbraided him with loss of head if he lost  the wager; he now said they would drink together, when they began to  quarrel and fight with him, but Robin getting a little distance off,  with shooting, despatched them, then fled away and retired to the woods;  the chief of which seems to be Barnsdale, in Yorkshire, Sherwood, in  Nottinghamshire, and Plompton Park, in Cumberland. Here he either found,  or was afterwards joined by, a number of persons in similar  circumstances,        Such as the fury of ungovern'd youth    Thrust from the company of lawful men;      who appear to have considered him as their leader. Of these, his  principal favourites, or those in whose courage and fidelity he most  confided, were Little John, (whose surname is said to have been Nailor;)  William Scadlock, (Scathelock or Scarlet;) George a Green, pinder, (or  pound-keeper;) of Wakefield; Much, a miller's son; and a certain monk or  friar, named Tuck. He is likewise said to have been accompanied in his  retreat by a female, of whom he was enamoured, and whose real or adopted  name was Marian. His company, in process of time consisted of a hundred  archers, \"men,\" says Major, \"most skilful in battle, whom four times  that number of the boldest fellows durst not attack.\" His manner of  recruiting was somewhat singular; for, in the words of an old writer,  \"wheresoever he heard of any that were of unusual strength and  hardiness, he would disgyse himselfe, and rather than fayle, go lyke a  begger to become acquaynted with them, and after he had tryed them with  fyghting, never give them over tyl he had used means to drawe them to  lyve after his fashion; numerous instances of which are recorded in the  common and popular songs, where indeed he seldom fails to receive a  sound thrashing. After such manner he procured the pynner of Wakefyld,  friar Tuck, and Scadlock. One day meeting him, Scadlock, as he walked  solitary, and like to a man forlorn, because a maid to whom he was  affianced was taken from him by her friends, and given to another that  was old and wealthy; Robin hearing when the marriage day would be, came  to the church as a beggar, having his own company not far off; and who  at the sound of his horn rushed in, took the bride from him that was to  marry her, and caused the priest to wed her and Scadlock together.\" In  shooting with the long bow, the company excelled all the men in the  land; their archery indeed was unparalleled, as both Robin Hood and  Little John, _it is said_, have frequently shot an arrow a measured  mile, or 1,760 yards.    Charlton informs us, that in one of Robin's peregrinations, he, attended  by his trusty mate, John, went to dine at Whitby Abbey, with the abbot,  Richard, who having heard them often famed for their great dexterity  in shooting with the long bow, begged them after dinner to show him a  specimen. They went up top of the abbey, and each of them shot an arrow  that fell not far from Whitby-laths. The abbot placed a pillar on the  spot where each arrow fell, and named one Robin Hood's field, the other  John's field. Their distance from Whitby is more than a measured mile.    In these forests, and with his company, Robin for many years reigned  like an independent sovereign. At perpetual war with the King of England  and all his subjects, (with the exception of the poor and needy, the  desolate and oppressed, and those who stood in need of his protection,)  he defied the power of law and government; an outlaw in those times  having no protection, owed no allegiance, his hand was against every  man, and every man's hand against him;        The world was not his friend, nor the world's law.      The deer with which the royal forests then abounded, afforded Robin and  his companions an ample supply of food throughout the year. Their mode  of life and domestic economy are more easily guessed at than described.  Nevertheless, the poet has endeavoured to give us an outline in the  following:        The merry pranks he play'd would ask an age to tell,    And the adventures strange that Robin Hood befel;    When Mansfield many a time for Robin hath been laid,    How he hath cousen'd them, that him would have betray'd:    An hundred valiant men had this brave Robin Hood,    Still ready at his call, that bowmen were right good,    And of these archers brave, there was not any one    But he could kill a deer, his swiftest speed upon,    Which they did boil and roast, in many a mighty wood,    Sharp hunger, the fine sauce to their more kingly food.    Then taking them to rest, his merry men and he    Slept many a summer's night under the greenwood tree.    What oftentimes he took, he shar'd amongst the poor,    From wealthy Abbot's chests, and churl's abundant store,    He from the husband's bed no married woman wan,    But to his mistress dear, his loved Marian,    Was ever constant known, which wheresoe'er she came    Was sovereign of the woods, chief lady of the game;    Her clothes tuck'd to the knee, and dainty braided hair,    With bow and quiver arm'd, she wander'd here and there    Amongst the forests wild, Diana never knew    Such pleasures, nor such harts as Mariana slew.      Robin took away the goods of rich men only, never killing any person  unless he was attacked: nor would he suffer a woman to be maltreated.  Fordun, in the fourteenth century, calls him \"that most celebrated  robber;\" and Major says, \"I disapprove of the rapine of the man, but he  was the most humane, and prince of all robbers.\"    Robin Hood seems to have held bishops, abbots, priests, and monks,  indeed all the clergy, in"]]]
