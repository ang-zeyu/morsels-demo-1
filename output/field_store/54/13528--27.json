Professor Trowbridge then mentioned a  method which he had suggested some years ago for telegraphing across the  ocean without a cable, the method having been suggested more for its  interest than with any idea of its ever being put in practice. A conductor  is supposed to be laid from Labrador to Patagonia, ending in the ocean at  those points, and passing through New York, where a dynamo machine is  supposed to be included in the circuit. In Europe a line is to extend from  the north of Scotland to the south of Spain, making connections with the  ocean at those points, and in this circuit is to be included a telephone.  Then any change in the strength of the current in the American line would  produce a corresponding change in current in the European line; and thus  signals could be transmitted. Mr. Preece, of the English postal telegraph,  then gave an account of how such a system had actually been put into  practice in telegraphing between the Isle of Wight and Southampton during  a suspension in the action of the regular cable communication. The  instruments used were a telephone in one circuit, and in the other about  twenty-five Leclanche cells and an interrupter. The sound could then be  heard distinctly; and so communication was kept up until the cable was  again in working order. Of the two lines used in this case, one extended  from the sea at the end of the island near Hurst Castle, through the  length of the island, and entered the sea again at Rye; while the line on  the mainland ran from Hurst Castle, where it was connected with the sea,  through Southampton to Portsmouth, where it again entered the sea. The  distance between the two terminals at Hurst Castle was about one mile,  while that between the terminals at Portsmouth and Rye amounted to six  miles.--_Science._           *       *       *       *       *          PYROMETERS.      The accurate measurement of very high temperatures is a matter of great  importance, especially with regard to metallurgical operations; but it is  also one of great difficulty. Until recent years the only methods  suggested were to measure the expansion of a given fluid or gas, as in the  air pyrometer; or to measure the contraction of a cone of hard, burnt  clay, as in the Wedgwood pyrometer. Neither of these systems was at all  reliable or satisfactory. Lately, however, other principles have been  introduced with considerable success, and the matter is of so much  interest, not only to the practical manufacturer but also to the  physicist, that a sketch of the chief systems now in use will probably be  acceptable. He will thus be enabled to select the instrument best suited  for the particular purpose he may have in view.    The first real improvement in this direction, as in so many others, is due  to the genius of Sir William Siemens. His first attempt was a calorimetric  pyrometer, in which a mass of copper at the temperature required to be  known is thrown into the water of a calorimeter, and the heat it has  absorbed thus determined. This method, however, is not very reliable, and  was superseded by his well-known electric pyrometer. This rests on the  principle that the electric resistance of metal conductors increases with  the temperature. In the case of platinum, the metal chosen for the  purpose, this increase up to 1,500 deg.C. is very nearly in the exact  proportion of the rise of temperature. The principle is applied in the  following manner: A cylinder of fireclay slides in a metal tube, and has  two platinum wires one one-hundredth of an inch in diameter wound round it  in separate grooves. Their ends are connected at the top to two  conductors, which pass down inside the tube and end in a fireclay plug at  the bottom. The other ends of the wires are connected with a small  platinum coil, which is kept at a constant resistance. A third conductor  starting from the top of the tube passes down through it, and comes out at  the face of the metal plug. The tube is inserted in the medium whose  temperature is to be found, and the electric resistance of the coil is  measured by a differential voltameter. From this it is easy to deduce the  temperature to which the platinum has been raised. This pyrometer is  probably the most widely used at the present time.    Tremeschini's pyrometer is based on a different principle, viz., on the  expansion of a thin plate of platinum, which is heated by a mass of metal  previously raised to the temperature of the medium. The exact arrangements  are difficult to describe without the aid of drawings, but the result is  to measure the difference of temperature between the medium to be tested  and the atmosphere at the position of the instrument. The whole apparatus  is simple, compact, and easy to manage, and its indications appear to be  correct at least up to 800 deg.C.    The Trampler pyrometer is based upon the difference in the coefficients of  dilatation for iron and graphite, that of the latter being about  two-thirds that of the former. There is an iron tube containing a stick of  hard graphite. This is placed in the medium to be examined, and both  lengthen under the heat, but the iron the most of the two. At the top of  the stick of graphite is a metal cap carrying a knife-edge, on which rests  a bent lever pressed down upon it by a light spring. A fine chain attached  to the long arm of this lever is wound upon a small pulley; a larger  pulley on the same axis has wound upon it a second chain, which actuates a  third pulley on the axis of the indicating needle. In this way the  relative dilatation of the graphite is sufficiently magnified to be easily  visible.    A somewhat similar instrument is the Gauntlett pyrometer, which is largely  used in the north of England. Here the instrument is partly of iron,  partly of fireclay, and the difference in the expansion of the two  materials is caused to act by a system of springs upon a needle revolving  upon a dial.    The Ducomet pyrometer is on a very different principle, and only  applicable to rough determinations. It consists of a series of rings made  of alloys which have slightly different melting-points. These are strung  upon a rod, which is pushed into the medium to be measured, and are  pressed together by a spiral spring. As soon as any one of the rings  begins to soften under the heat, it is squeezed together by the pressure,  and, as it melts, it is completely squeezed out and disappears. The rod is  then made to rise by the thickness of the melted ring, and a simple  apparatus shows at any moment the number of rings which have melted, and  therefore the temperature which has been attained. This instrument cannot  be used to follow variations of temperature, but indicates clearly the  moment when a particular temperature is attained. It is of course entirely  dependent on the accuracy with which the melting-points of the various  alloys have been fixed.    Yet another principle is involved in the instrument called the  thalpotasimeter, which may be used either with ether, water, or mercury.  It is based on the principle that the pressure of any saturated vapor  corresponds to its temperature. The instrument consists of a tube of metal  partly filled with liquid, which is exposed to the medium which is to be  measured. A metallic pressure gauge is connected with the tube, and  indicates the pressure existing within it at any moment. By graduating the  face of the gauge when the instrument is at known temperatures, the  temperature can be read off directly from the position of the needle. From  100 deg. to 220 deg.F. ether is the liquid used, from thence to 680 deg. it is water,  and above the latter temperature mercury is employed.    Another class of pyrometers having great promise in the future is based on  what may be called the \"water-current\" principle. Here the temperature is  determined by noting the amount of heat communicated to a known current of  water circulating in the medium to be observed. The idea, which was due to  M. De Saintignon, has been carried out in its most improved form by M.  Boulier. Here the pyrometer itself consists of a set of tubes one inside  the other, and all inclosed for safety in a large tube of fireclay. The  central tube or pipe brings in the water from a tank above, where it is  maintained at a constant level. The water descends to the bottom of the  instrument, and opens into the end of another small tube called the  explorer (_explorateur_). This tube projects from the fireclay casing into  the medium to be examined, and can be pushed in or out as required. After  circulating through this tube the water rises again in the annular space  between the central pipe and the second pipe. The similar space between  the second pipe and the third pipe is always filled by another and much  larger current of water, which keeps the interior cool. The result is that  no loss of heat is possible in the instrument, and the water in the  central tube merely takes up just so much heat as is conducted into it  through the metal of the explorer. This heat it brings back through a  short India-rubber pipe to a casing containing a thermometer. This  thermometer is immersed in the returning current of water, and records its  temperature. It is graduated by immersing the instrument in known and  constant temperatures, and thus the graduations on the thermometer give at  once the temperature, not of the current of water, but of the medium from  which it has received its heat. In order to render the instrument  perfectly reliable, all that is necessary is that the current of water  should be always perfectly uniform, and this is easily attained by fixing  the size of the outlet once for all, and also the level of water in the  tank. So arranged, the pyrometer works with great regularity, indicating  the least variations of temperature, requiring no sort of attention, and  never suffering"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11649"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 799, April 25, 1891 (#2)"],[1,"t. These were  centrifugal pumps, capable of discharging 2,000 gallons a minute each.  One was placed in the engine room, another with its suction in No. 3  hold, and when these two compartments were pumped dry, it was found that  in No. 3 hold the leak was easily kept under, while in the engine room  there was no leak at all. The third pump was not used.    [Illustration]    In the two foremost holds 2,000 large casks were then placed, and all  the hatches over the leaky holds--Nos. 1, 2, and 4--were battened down,  and made airtight with felt, pitch, tow, etc. A small hole was then made  in Nos. 1 and 2 hatches, about 2 ft. square. When the tide had sunk its  farthest, these two holes were closed and made perfectly airtight, in  the same manner as the hatches had been.    Before this took place the whole of the lower deck over the badly  damaged holds had been prevented from bursting up by means of wooden  shores, which were placed in rows about 4 ft. apart, and wedged firmly  into position. The wood for the shores was obtained from Annapolis, and  the casks from St. John. The ship went ashore on August 26, 1890. This  work was commenced on September 8, and completed ten days afterward.    The labor of repairing her could only be carried out at low tide, and  only then with the greatest difficulty, as the decks were very slippery  with weeds, etc., and inclined at an angle of 30 deg. Everything was  ready for floating her off at high tide on the 18th, and the hatches  were closed up on that day.    She was raised off the rocks by the water rising and compressing the air  in the two foremost holds, assisted by the buoyancy of the engine room  and No. 3 compartments. At high water the bow was afloat, but she was  aground by the stern. When, however, she was taken in tow by three tugs,  she slowly slid down the reef and floated into deep water. One tug was  placed on each bow, and the third was ahead. In this state she was towed  into West Port, a distance of four miles, and there beached on a  sheltered stretch of sand.    The casks performed no part in floating the ship off, but were only  there in case the great pressure of air should cause the escape of some  of it, in which event all the space underneath the lower deck would soon  have been occupied with water instead of air. These casks would then, of  course, have served to displace a large amount of this water, and so  keep her afloat. Luckily the deck did not leak, and the barrels were  thus not instrumental in the raising.    When beached the hatches were taken off, the casks removed, and a false  deck was built about 7 ft. below the lower deck, and about 10 ft. above  the keel. This was used as the bottom of the ship to take her round to  Halifax, and was built in the following manner: A kind of iron platform,  about 2 ft. wide, runs along the sides of the holds in the Ulunda for  strengthening purposes, braced at intervals of 15 ft. by iron beams  across the ship.    On this was built the wooden deck. Beams for this deck were constructed  of three 3 in. planks, and were laid down on the iron platform about 31/2  ft. apart, and firmly wedged into the ship's side. On these beams a  layer of 3 in. planks was placed in a fore-and-aft direction and nailed  down; on this were three layers of felt, and on this again more planks  were laid down in the same direction as before.    The whole deck was then carefully calked and the sides made watertight  with Portland cement. This deck only extended to the engine room  bulkhead through the two foremost holds. It was prevented from bursting  up by the pressure on the bottom of it, by means of shores, in the same  manner as the iron deck had been served before. Shores were, therefore,  connecting the three decks--the upper deck, lower deck, and wooden  deck--this being done to equalize the pressure on the _extempore_ deck  and the two permanent decks, and thus gain additional strength.    No deck was built in either of the after compartments, inasmuch as No. 3  hold was kept clear of water as before by its pump, and in No. 4 the  deck was not necessary. To have built one there, as in the two foremost  ones, although it would have given a little more reserve of buoyancy to  the ship, would have raised the stern higher than the bows, and so would  have increased the upward pressure on the wooden deck, and thus have  increased the liability to burst up. For the same reason, when raising  the ship off the rocks, no compressed air was used in the after hold to  lift the ship. The anchors and cables were in both cases transferred  aft, for the same purpose, namely, to diminish the upward pressure  forward. In the case of the wooden deck leaking, 200 of the same casks  were placed between it and the lower deck in the foremost hold to retain  some of the buoyancy of the forepart, which would otherwise be lost. No  decks were built in the compartment before the collision bulkhead, as  very little buoyancy was lost by that space being full of water, and all  that was there was confined to that compartment by the bulkhead and the  iron lower deck.    While all these foregoing arrangements were being made for the exclusion  of water from the inside of the ship, the engineers and firemen were  employed clearing the engine room of some fifty tons of coal which had  been washed from the open bunkers into the machinery by the sea, when  the engine room was full and the ship on the reef. The greatest  difficulty was experienced in digging out and excavating the engines  from the coal and dirt, and still greater was the labor of cleaning all  the mechanism and putting everything once more in an efficient steaming  condition. But all was finished soon after the decks had been completed,  and on October 12 she was ready for sea. On the following day she was  floated off and started on her perilous voyage to Halifax, using her own  engines, and making about five and a half knots an hour. Her steam pumps  were by this time all ready for service to assist the big ones on deck  in an emergency. She anchored once on her way round, at Shelburne, on  the coast of Nova Scotia, arriving at Halifax at 1 p.m. on October 17.  The trip round was a very anxious time for all hands, more especially  when they were overtaken by a fresh gale in the Atlantic, for the  forward deck was very liable to be burst up with the increased pressure  on it caused by the pitching of the ship; also the rudder was entirely  unable to bear any strain on it, because the lower part of the rudder  post was unconnected with the stern post, part of the stern framing  which connects the two having been broken off. Any heavy sea was  therefore likely to carry away the rudder altogether, or the same  accident might happen if the helm was put down too hard, rendering the  ship unmanageable.    She was placed in dry dock as soon as she arrived at Halifax, and it was  not until then that the full extent of the damages, caused by the  pounding on the rocks, could be fully realized. The first 20 feet of the  keel had been torn completely out, and about 30 feet from the stern  there was an immense hole, with the thick plates torn and bent like  paper, the framing and stanchions being twisted into all sorts of shapes  almost beyond recognition. Under the foremast the bottom of the ship was  bent up in the form of an arch, having been raised 4 feet above its  natural position, with an immense hole punctured on the starboard side,  besides several smaller ones. Also the aftermost 20 feet of keel was  torn and jagged, with several small holes in the skin, and the lower  portion of the stern framing was broken off, leaving the rudder post to  hang down unsupported at its extremity. It would strike one on looking  at these gaping wounds that it would be nearly impossible to place the  Ulunda in an efficient condition again, but the work of renewing the  damaged plates is being carried out at a great rate, and in three  months' time it is hoped that all the repairs necessary will be  completed and the ship once more doing her duty. She has already cost  her owners some $10,000, and $40,000 are estimated to cover all future  repairs.    The foremast was snapped off in a somewhat novel manner. She was pivoted  on the rocks by her bows, and at high tide, the day after she struck, a  breeze sprang up and turned her round; the tide sinking again, the whole  weight of the ship came on the bottom of the ship where she was then  touching, namely, just on the spot where the foremost was stepped, and  right astern, leaving the center portion of the ship unsupported. This  caused the foremast to rise, and it being held down by wire rigging, it  snapped in several places, at the same time tearing up the shrouds from  the deck. This accounts also for the arch-like bulge in the bottom at  that spot and for the damages astern; also for the fact that Captain  Kelly discovered the ship with her head to sea.    Another incident happened when the ship was just rising off the rocks,  which nearly resulted in a catastrophe. When the ship was just beginning  to lift, the leak in No. 3 compartment was found to be gaining on its  pump. A diver was at once sent down to ascertain the cause, and he found  that a small hole, about 6 inches square, had been punctured in the  skin, which until then had been kept tight by the rock that had caused  it. It was necessary to close this leak at once. An iron bolt, which was  screwed for a nut at one end, was obtained and passed through a strong  piece of wood about 2 feet square. The inside of this board was  cushioned with canvas and oakum, and it was taken down outside the ship  by the diver and placed over the hole, with the feathered end of the  bolt sticking through the hole; the diver was then sent down inside the  hold, and with a nut set up the whole cushion until the flow of water  was stopped. The leak was thus stopped which had threatened the  arrangements"]]]
