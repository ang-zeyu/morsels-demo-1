His account is true, but he gives no  notion of the number or elaborate character of these interesting  ceremonies.    The sources to which we shall have occasion to refer will be, then,  the two most important collections of Vedic hymns--the Rig Veda and  the Atharva Veda; the Brahmanic literature, with the supplementary  Upanishads, and the S[=u]tras or mnemonic abridgments of religious and  ceremonial rules; the legal texts, and the religious and theological  portions of the epic; and the later sectarian writings, called  Pur[=a]nas. The great heresies, again, have their own special  writings. Thus far we shall draw on the native literature. Only for  some of the modern sects, and for the religions of the wild tribes  which have no literature, shall we have to depend on the accounts of  European writers.      DATES.    For none of the native religious works has one a certain date. Nor is  there for any one of the earlier compositions the certainty that it  belongs, as a whole, to any one time. The Rig Veda was composed by  successive generations; the Atharvan represents different ages; each  Br[=a]hmana appears to belong in part to one era, in part to another;  the earliest S[=u]tras (manuals of law, etc.) have been interpolated;  the earliest metrical code is a composite; the great epic is the work  of centuries; and not only do the Upanishads and Pur[=a]nas represent  collectively many different periods, but exactly to which period each  individually is to be assigned remains always doubtful. Only in the  case of the Buddhistic writings is there a satisfactorily approximate  terminus a quo, and even here approximate means merely within the  limit of centuries.    Nevertheless, criteria fortunately are not lacking to enable one to  assign the general bulk of any one work to a certain period in the  literary development; and as these periods are, if not sharply, yet  plainly distinguishable, one is not in so desperate a case as he might  have expected to be, considering that it is impossible to date with  certainty any Hindu book or writer before the Christian era. For,  first, there exists a difference in language, demarcating the most  important periods; and, secondly, the development of the literature  has been upon such lines that it is easy to say, from content and  method of treatment, whether a given class of writings is a product of  the Vedic, early Brahmanic, or late Brahmanic epochs. Usually, indeed,  one is unable to tell whether a later Upanishad was made first in the  early or late Brahmanic period, but it is known that the Upanishads,  as a whole, _i.e._, the literary form and philosophical material which  characterize Upanishads, were earlier than the latest Brahmanic period  and subsequent to the early Brahmanic period; that they arose at the  close of the latter and before the rise of the former. So the  Br[=a]hmanas, as a whole, are subsequent to the Vedic age, although  some of the Vedic hymns appear to have been made up in the same period  with that of the early Br[=a]hmanas. Again, the Pur[=a]nas can be  placed with safety after the late Brahmanic age; and, consequently,  subsequent to the Upanishads, although it is probable that many  Upanishads were written after the first Pur[=a]nas. The general  compass of this enormous literature is from an indefinite antiquity to  about 1500 A.D. A liberal margin of possible error must be allowed in  the assumption of any specific dates. The received opinion is that  the Rig Veda goes back to about 2000 B.C., yet are some scholars  inclined rather to accept 3000 B.C. as the time that represents this  era. Weber, in his _Lectures on Sanskrit Literature_ (p. 7), rightly  says that to seek for an exact date is fruitless labor; while Whitney  compares Hindu dates to ninepins--set up only to be bowled down again.  Schroeder, in his _Indiens Literatur und Cultur_, suggests that the  prior limit may be \"a few centuries earlier than 1500,\" agreeing with  Weber's preferred reckoning; but Whitney, Grassmann, and Benfey  provisionally assume 2000 B.C. as the starting point of Hindu  literature. The lowest possible limit for this event Mueller now places  at about 1500, which is recognized as a very cautious view; most  scholars thinking that Mueller's estimate gives too little time for the  development of the literary periods, which, in their opinion, require,  linguistically and otherwise, a greater number of years. Brunnhofer  more recently has suggested 2800 B.C. as the terminus; while the last  writers on the subject (Tilak and Jacobi) claim to have discovered  that the period from 3500 to 2500 represents the Vedic age. Their  conclusions, however, are not very convincing, and have been disputed  vigorously.[4] Without the hope of persuading such scholars as are  wedded to a terminus of three or four thousand years ago that we are  right, we add, in all deference to others, our own opinion on this  vexed question. Buddhism gives the first semblance of a date in Hindu  literature. Buddha lived in the sixth century, and died probably about  480, possibly (Westergaard's extreme opinion) as late as 368.[5]  Before this time arise the S[=u]tras, back of which lie the earliest  Upanishads, the bulk of the Br[=a]hmanas, and all the Vedic poems. Now  it is probable that the Brahmanic literature itself extends to the  time of Buddha and perhaps beyond it. For the rest of pre-Buddhistic  literature it seems to us incredible that it is necessary to require,  either from the point of view of linguistic or of social and religious  development, the enormous period of two thousand years. There are no  other grounds on which to base a reckoning except those of Jacobi and  his Hindu rival, who build on Vedic data results that hardly support  the superstructure they have erected. Jacobi's starting-point is from  a mock-serious hymn, which appears to be late and does not establish,  to whatever date it be assigned, the point of departure from which  proceeds his whole argument, as Whitney has shown very well. One is  driven back to the needs of a literature in respect of time sufficient  for it to mature. What changes take place in language, even with a  written literature, in the space of a few centuries, may be seen in  Persian, Greek, Latin, and German. No two thousand years are required  to bridge the linguistic extremes of the Vedic and classical Sanskrit  language.[6] But in content it will be seen that the flower of the  later literature is budding already in the Vedic age. We are unable to  admit that either in language or social development, or in literary or  religious growth, more than a few centuries are necessary to account  for the whole development of Hindu literature (meaning thereby  compositions, whether written or not) up to the time of Buddha.  Moreover, if one compare the period at which arise the earliest forms  of literature among other Aryan peoples, it will seem very strange  that, whereas in the case of the Romans, Greeks, and Persians, one  thousand years B.C. is the extreme limit of such literary activity as  has produced durable works, the Hindus two or three thousand years  B.C. were creating poetry so finished, so refined, and, from a  metaphysical point of view, so advanced as is that of the Rig Veda.  If, as is generally assumed, the (prospective) Hindus and Persians  were last to leave the common Aryan habitat, and came together to the  south-east, the difficulty is increased; especially in the light of  modern opinion in regard to the fictitious antiquity of Persian  (Iranian) literature. For if Darmesteter be correct in holding the  time of the latter to be at most a century before our era, the  incongruity between that oldest date of Persian literature and the  \"two or three thousand years before Christ,\" which are claimed in the  case of the Rig Veda, becomes so great as to make the latter  assumption more dubious than ever.    We think in a word, without wishing to be dogmatic, that the date of  the Rig Veda is about on a par, historically, with that of 'Homer,'  that is to say, the Collection[7] represents a long period, which was  completed perhaps two hundred years after 1000 B.C, while again its  earliest beginnings precede that date possibly by five centuries; but  we would assign the bulk of the Rig Veda to about 1000 B.C. With  conscious imitation of older speech a good deal of archaic linguistic  effect doubtless was produced by the latest poets, who really belong  to the Brahmanic age. The Brahmanic age in turn ends, as we opine,  about 500 B.C., overlapping the S[=u]tra period as well as that of the  first Upanishads. The former class of writings (after 500 B.C. one may  talk of writings) is represented by dates that reach from circa  600-500 B.C. nearly to our era. Buddhism's _floruit_ is from 500 B.C.  to 500 A.D., and epic Hinduism covers nearly the same centuries. From  500 to 1000 Buddhism is in a state of decadence; and through this time  extend the dramatic and older Puranic writings; while other Pur[=a]nas  are as late as 1500, at which time arises the great modern reforming  sect of the Sikhs. In the matter of the earlier termini a century may  be added or subtracted here and there, but these convenient divisions  of five hundreds will be found on the whole to be sufficiently  accurate.[8]      METHODS OF INTERPRETATION.    At the outset of his undertaking a double problem presents itself to  one that would give, even in compact form, a view of Hindu religions.  This problem consists in explaining, and, in so far as is possible,  reconciling opposed opinions in regard not only to the nature of these  religions but also to the method of interpreting"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14515"],[0,"The Nervous Child (#2)"],[1,"that forms  the distinguishing characteristic of the infancy of man. Were it not  for this rapid growth of the cerebral functions, the rearing of  children would be a matter almost as simple and uneventful as the  rearing of live stock. For most animals faults of environment must be  very pronounced to do harm by producing mental unrest and  irritability. Thus, indeed, some wild animal separated from its  fellows and kept in solitary captivity may sicken and waste, though  maintained and fed with every care. Yet if the whole conditions of  life for the animal are not profoundly altered, if the environment is  natural or approximately natural, it is as a rule necessary to care  only for its physical needs, and we need not fear that the results  will be spoiled by the reaction of the mind upon the body. But with  the child it is different; airy nurseries, big gardens, visits to the  seaside, and every advantage that money can buy cannot achieve success  if the child's mind is not at rest, if his sleep is broken, if food is  habitually refused or vomited, or if to leave him alone in the nursery  for a moment is to evoke a fit of passionate crying.    The grown-up person comes eventually to be able to control this  tremendous organ, this brain, which is the predominant feature of his  race. In the child its functions are always unstable and liable to be  upset. Evidence of mental unrest or fatigue, which is only rarely met  with in grown persons and which then betokens serious disturbance of  the mind, is of comparatively common occurrence in little children.  Habit spasm, bed-wetting, sleep-walking, night terrors, and  convulsions are symptoms which are frequent enough in children, and  there is no need to be unduly alarmed at their occurrence. In adult  age they are found only among persons who must be considered as  neuropathic. To make the point clear, I have chosen examples from the  graver and more serious symptoms of nervous unrest. But it is equally  true that minor symptoms which in adults are universally recognised to  be dependent upon cerebral unrest or fatigue are of everyday  occurrence in childhood. Broken and disturbed sleep, absence of  appetite and persistent refusal of food, gastric pain and discomfort  after meals, nervous vomiting, morbid flushing and blushing, headache,  irritability and excessive emotional display, at whatever age they  occur, are indications of a mind that is not at rest. In children, as  in adults, they may be prominent although the physical surroundings of  the patient may be all that could be desired and all that wealth can  procure. It is an everyday experience that business worries and  responsibilities in men, domestic anxieties or childlessness in women,  have the power to ruin health, even in those who habitually or grossly  break none of its laws. The unstable mind of the child is so sensitive  that cerebral fatigue and irritability are produced by causes which  seem to us extraordinarily trivial. In the little life which the child  leads, a life in which the whole seems to us to be comprised in  dressing and undressing, washing, walking, eating, sleeping, and  playing, it is not easy to detect where the elements of nervous  overstrain lie. Nor is it as a rule in these things that the mischief  is to be found. It is in the personality of mother or nurse, in her  conduct to the child, in her actions and words, in the tone of her  voice when she addresses him, even in the thoughts which pass through  her mind and which show themselves plainly to that marvellously acute  intuition of his, which divines what she has not spoken, that we must  seek for the disturbing element. The mental environment of the child  is created by the mother or the nurse. That is her responsibility and  her opportunity. The conduct of the child must be the criterion of her  success. If things go wrong, if there is constant crying or  ungovernable temper, if sleep and food are persistently refused, or if  there is undue timidity and tearfulness, there is danger that seeds  may be sown from which nervous disorders will spring in the future.    There are many women who, without any deep thought on the matter, have  the inborn knack of managing children, who seem to understand them,  and have a feeling for them. With them, we say, the children are  always good, and they are good because the element of nervous  overstrain has not arisen. There are other women, often very fond of  children, who are conspicuously lacking in this power. Contact with  one of these well-meaning persons, even for a few days, will  demoralise a whole nursery. Tempers grow wild and unruly, sleep  disappears, fretfulness and irritability take its place. Yet of most  mothers it is probably true that they are neither strikingly  proficient nor utterly deficient in the power of managing children. If  they lack the gift that comes naturally to some women, they learn from  experience and grow instinctively to feel when they have made a false  step with the child. Although by dearly bought experience they learn  wisdom in the management of their children, they nevertheless may not  study the subject with the same care which they devote to matters of  diet and hygiene. It is the mother whose education and understanding  best fits her for this task. In this country a separate nursery and a  separate nursery life for the children is found in nearly all  households among the well-to-do, and the care for the physical needs  of the children is largely taken off the mothers' shoulders by nurses  and nursemaids. That this arrangement is advantageous on the whole  cannot be doubted. In America and on the Continent, where the children  often mingle all day in the general life of the household, and occupy  the ordinary living rooms, experience shows that nerve strain and its  attendant evils are more common than with us. Nevertheless, the  arrangement of a separate nursery has its disadvantages. Nurses are  sometimes not sufficiently educated to have much appreciation of the  mental processes of the child. If the children are restless and  nervous they are content to attribute this to naughtiness or to  constipation, or to some other physical ailment. Their time is usually  so fully occupied that they cannot be expected to be very zealous in  reading books on the management of children. Nevertheless, in  practical matters of detail a good nurse will learn rapidly from a  mother who has given some attention to the subject, and who is able to  give explicit instructions upon definite points.    It is right that mothers should appreciate the important part which  the environment plays in all the mental processes of children, and in  their physical condition as well; that they should understand that  good temper and happiness mean a proper environment, and that constant  crying and fretfulness, broken sleep, refusal of food, vomiting, undue  thinness, and extreme timidity often indicate that something in this  direction is at fault.    Nevertheless, we must be careful not to overstate our case. We must  remember how great is the diversity of temperament in children--a  diversity which is produced purely by hereditary factors. The task of  all mothers is by no means of equal difficulty. There are children in  whom quite gross faults in training produce but little permanent  damage; there are others of so sensitive a nervous organisation that  their environment requires the most delicate adjustment, and when  matters have gone wrong, it may be very difficult to restore health of  mind and body. When a peculiarly nervous temperament is inherited,  wisdom in the management of the child is essential, and may sometimes  achieve the happiest results. Heredity is so powerful a factor in the  development of the nervous organisation of the child that, realising  its importance, we should be sparing in our criticism of the results  which the mothers who consult us achieve in the training of their  children. A sensitive, nervous organisation is often the mark of  intellectual possibilities above the average, and the children who are  cast outside the ordinary mould, who are the most wayward, the most  intractable, who react to trifling faults of management with the most  striking symptoms of disturbance, are often those with the greatest  potentialities for achievement and for good. It is natural for the  mother of placid, contented, and perhaps rather unenterprising  children, looking on as a detached outsider, seeing nothing of the  teeming activities of the quick, restless little brain, and the  persistent, though faulty reasoning--it is natural for her to blame  another's work, and to flatter herself that her own routine would have  avoided all these troublesome complications. The mother of the nervous  child may often rightly take comfort in the thought that her child is  worth the extra trouble and the extra care which he demands, because  he is sent into the world with mechanism which, just because it is  more powerful than the common run, is more difficult to master and  takes longer to control and to apply for useful ends.    It is through the mother, and by means of her alone, that the doctor  can influence the conduct of the child. Without her co-operation, or  if she fails to appreciate the whole situation, with the best will in  the world, we are powerless to help. Fortunately with the majority of  educated mothers there is no difficulty. Their powers of observation  in all matters concerning their children are usually very great. It is  their interpretation of what they have observed that is often faulty.  Thus, in the example given above, the mother observes correctly that  defaecation is inhibited, and produces crying and resistance. It is  her interpretation that the cause is to be found in pain that is at  fault. Again, a mother may bring her infant for tongue-tie. She has  observed correctly that the child is unable to sustain"]]]
