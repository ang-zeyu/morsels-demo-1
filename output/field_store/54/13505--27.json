Here I may be allowed a  remark or two on the animadversion which has been heaped on Johnson  for that beautiful piece of biography, \"The Life of Richard Savage.\"  It has hitherto been somewhat of a mystery that the stern critic whose  strictures so severely exposed the minutest derelictions of genius in  all other instances, should have adopted \"the melting mood\" in  detailing the life of such a man as Savage; for, much as we may admire  the concentrated smiles and tears of his two poems, \"The Bastard,\" and  \"The Wanderer,\" pitying the fortunes and miseries of the author, yet  his ungovernable temper and depraved propensities, which led to his  embruing his hands in blood, his ingratitude to his patrons and  benefactors, (but chiefly to Pope,) and his degraded misemployment of  talents which might have raised him to the capital of the proud column  of intellect of that day,--all conduce to petrify the tear of mingled  mercy and compassion, which the misfortunes of such a being might  otherwise demand. Nevertheless, as was lately observed by a  respectable journal, \"there must have been _something_ good about him,  or Samuel Johnson would not have loved him.\"    **H.           *       *       *       *       *      DREAMS.

(_For the Mirror_.)      ----He was but a poor undergraduate; not, indeed, one of lowest grade,  but still too much lacking pecuniary supplies to render him an  \"eligible match.\" Julia, too, though pretty, was portionless; and the  world, which always kindly interests itself in such affairs, said,  they had no business whatever to become attached to each other; but  then, such attachments and the world, never did, and never will agree;  and _I_, from fatal experience, assert that what people impertinently  call \"falling in love,\" is a thing that _cannot_ be helped; _I_, at  least, never could help it. The regard of Millington and Julia was of  a very peculiar nature; it was a morsel of platonism, which is rather  too curious to pass unrecorded; for as far as I have been able, upon  the most minute investigation to ascertain, they never spoke to each  other during the period of their tender acquaintance. No; they were  not dumb, but lacking a mutual friend to give them an introduction;  their regard for decorum and etiquette was too great to permit them to  speak otherwise than with their eyes. Millington had kept three terms,  when I arrived at ---- College, a shy and gawky freshman; we had been  previously acquainted, and he, pitying perhaps my youth and  inexperience, patronized his playmate, and I became his chum. For some  time I was at a loss to account for sundry fluctuations in Henry's  disposition and manners. He shunned society and would neither accept  invitations to wine and supper parties in other men's rooms, nor give  such in his own; nevertheless his person seemed to have become an  object of the tenderest regard; never was he so contented as when  rambling through the streets and walks, without his gown, in a new and  well cut suit; whilst in order eternally to display his figure to the  best advantage, he was content to endure as heavy an infliction of  fines and impositions, as the heads of his college could lay upon his  shoulders. He was ruined for a reading-man. About this period he also  had a perfect mania for flowers; observing which, and fancying I might  gratify my friend by such a mark of attention, I one day went to his  rooms with a large bouquet in either hand. He was not at home; but  having carelessly enough forgotten to lock his door, I commenced, _con  amore_, (anticipating the agreeable surprise which I should afford  him) to fill his vases with fresh, bright, and delicious summer  flowers, in lieu of the very mummies of their race by which they were  occupied. My work was in progress when Millington returned, but, oh!  good heavens! the rage, the profane, diabolical, incomprehensible rage  into which he burst! I shall never forget. Away went my beautiful, my  fragrant flowers, into the court, and seizing upon the remnant of the  mummies, as yet untouched by my sacrilegious fingers, he tossed them  into a drawer, double locked it, and ordered me out of the room.  Dreading a kick, I was off at his word; but had not proceeded half way  down stairs, when a hand from the rear, roughly grasped mine, and a  voice, in a wild and hurried manner, asked pardon for \"intemperance.\"  I should have called it madness. We were again firm allies; but I  resolved to fathom, if possible, the mystery of the flowers. I now  observed, with surprise, that Millington never quitted his rooms  without a flower in his hand, or _boutonniere_; which flower, upon his  return, appeared to have been either lost, or metamorphosed into,  sometimes, one of another description; sometimes into a nosegay. Very  strange indeed, thought I; and began to have my suspicions that in all  this might be traced \"fair woman's visitings.\" Yes, Millington must  decidedly have fallen in love. He was never in chapel, never in hall,  never in college, never at lectures, and never at parties; he was in  love, that was certain; but with whom? He knew none of the resident  gentry of ----, and he was far too proud to involve himself in \"an  affair\" with a girl of inferior rank. Many men did so; but Millington  despised them for it. Accidentally I discovered that he adored Julia,  the young, sweet daughter of an undoubted gentleman, who was not yet  \"come out.\" She was a lively, pretty brunette, with brownest curling  hair, only fifteen; and to this day, I believe, knows not the name of  her lover. From an attic window of a five storied house, this fond and  beautiful girl contrived, sometimes, to shower upon the head of her  devoted admirer sweet flowers, and sometimes this paragon of pairs  meeting each other in the walks, silently effected an interchange of  the buds and blossoms, with which they always took care to be  provided. Several weeks passed thus, Henry and Julia seeing each other  every day; but long vacation would arrive; and on the evening  preceding his departure from ----, the lovelorn student, twisting  round the stem of a spicy carnation, a leaf which he had torn from his  pocket book, thus conveyed, with his farewell to Julia, an intimation  that he designed upon his return to college next term, to effect an  introduction to her family. Julia's delight may easily be conceived. I  remained in college for the vacation to read, and had shortly the  pleasure of informing Millington that I should be able, upon his  return, to afford him the introduction which he had so much at heart,  having made the acquaintance of Julia and her family. Two months  elapsed ere Millington deigned to notice my letter. His answer to it  was expressed in these terms:--    \"Freddy--I'm married to a proper vixen, I fancy; but to twenty  thousand pounds. Ay, my boy, there it is--no doing in this world  without the needful, and I'm not the ass to fight shy of such a  windfall. As for Julia, hang her. By Jove, what an escape--wasn't it?  Name her never again, and should she cry for me, give her a sugar  plum--a kiss--a gingerbread husband, or yourself, as you please. I am  not so fond of milk and water, and bread and butter, I can assure her.    \"Ever truly yours,  Henry Owen Millington.    \"P.S. Capital shooting hereabout--can't you slip over for a few days?\"    Poor Julia! I certainly am not clear that I shall not marry her  myself; but as for that scoundrel Millington, he had better take care  how he comes in my way--that's all.

Hence, and from the other circumstance, its association      in the second stanza with the triune sonorous Cerberus. A      diligence indeed!        [4] The intrusive garrulity of French waiters at dinner is      notorious.        [5] This \"sea Mediterranean\" is a most filthy, fetid, uncovered      gutter, running down the middle of the most, even of the best      streets, and with which every merciless Jehu most liberally      bespatters the unhappy pedestrian. Truly _la belle nation_ has      little idea of decency, or there would be subterranean sewers      like ours.        [6] French houses are cleaner even than ours externally, being      all neatly whitewashed! _mais le dedans! le dedans!_        [7] The servants are as notorious for their incivility as for      their intrusive loquacity.        [8] As Scott well observes in the introduction to Waverley, \"the      word comfortable is peculiar to the English language.\" The thing      is certainly peculiar to us, if the word is not.        [9] All the tragedies are in rhyme, and that of the very worst      description for elocutionary effect. It is the anapestic, like,      as Hannah More remarks, \"A cobbler there was, and he lived in a      stall!\"        [10] It is scarcely necessary to remark, that the absurdity      (exploded in England at the Reformation) of a Latin liturgy      still obtains in France.        [11] The Palais Royal! that pandemonium of profligacy! whose      gaming tables have eternally ruined so many of our countrymen!      So many, that he who, unwarned by their sad experience, plays at      them, is--is he not?--\"complete ass.\"        [12] There are none, even in the leading streets; our      ambassador's, for instance.

(_To The Editor Of The Mirror._)      SIR,--In the haste in which I wrote my last account of the carrying of  \"tar barrels\" in Westmoreland,[14] (owing to the pressure of time,) I  omitted some most interesting information, and I think I cannot do  better than supply the deficiency this year.    As I said before, the day is prepared for, about a month previously--the  townsmen employ themselves in hagging furze for the \"bon-fire,\" which is  situated in an adjoining field. Another party go round to the different  houses, grotesquely attired, supplicating contributions for the \"tar  barrels,\" and at each house, after receiving a donation, chant a few  doggerel verses and huzza! It is, however, well that people should  contribute towards defraying the expense, for if they do not get enough  money they commit sad depredations, and if any one is seen carrying a  barrel they wrest it from him.    For my part, I liked the \"watch night\" the best, and if it were possible  to keep sober, one might enjoy the fun--sad havoc indeed was then made  among the poultry--when ducks and fowls were crackling before the fire  all night; in fact, a few previous days were regular shooting days, and  the little birds were killed by scores. But ere morning broke in upon  them, many of the merry group were lying in a beastly state under the  chairs and tables, or others had gone to bed; but this is what _they_  called spending a _merry night_. The day arrives, and a whole troop of  temporary soldiers assemble in the town at 10 P.M. with their borrowed  instruments and dresses, and _a real Guy_,--not a _paper one_,--but a  _living one_--a regular painted old fellow, I assure you, with a pair of  boots like the Ogre's seven leagued, seated on an ass, with the mob  continually bawling out, \"there's a _par_ o'ye!\"    Thus they parade the town--one of the head leaders knocks at the  door--repeats the customary verses, while the other holds a silken purse  for the cash, which they divide amongst them after the expenses are  paid--and a pretty full purse they get too. In the evening so anxious  are they to fire the stack, that lanterns may be seen glimmering in all  parts of the field like so many will-o'-the-wisps; then follow the tar  barrels, and after this boisterous amusement the scene closes, save the  noise throughout the night, and for some nights after of the drunken  people, who very often repent their folly by losing their situations.    Now, respecting the origin of this custom, I merely, by way of hint,  submit, that in the time of Christian martyrdom, as tar barrels were  used for the \"burning at the stake\" to increase the ravages of the  flame:--the custom is derived,--out of rejoicings for the abolition of  the horrid practice, and this they show by carrying them on their heads  (as represented at page 296, vol. 8.), but you may treat this suggestion  as you please, and perhaps have the kindness to substitute your own, or  inquire into it.    W.H.H.        [14] See MIRROR, vol. 8, page 296.           *       *       *       *       *      CUSTOM OF BAKING SOUR CAKES.    (_For The Mirror._)      Rutherglen, in the county of Lanarkshire, has long been famous for the  singular custom of baking what are called sour cakes. About eight or ten  days before St. Luke's fair (for they are baked at no other time in the  year), a certain quantity of oatmeal is made into dough with warm water,  and laid up in a vessel to ferment. Being brought to a proper degree of  fermentation and consistency, it is rolled up into balls proportionable  to the intended largeness of the cakes. With the dough is commonly mixed  a small quantity of sugar, and a little aniseed or cinnamon. The baking  is executed by women only; and they seldom begin their work till after  sunset, and a night or two before the fair. A large space of the house,  chosen for the purpose, is marked out by a line drawn upon it. The area  within is considered as consecrated ground, and is not, by any of the  bystanders, to be touched with impunity. The transgression incurs a  small fine, which is always laid out in drink for the use of the  company. This hallowed spot, is occupied by six or eight women, all of  whom, except the toaster, seat themselves on the ground, in a circular  form, having their feet turned towards the fire. Each of them is  provided with a bakeboard about two feet square, which they hold on  their knees. The woman who toasts the cakes, which is done on an iron  plate suspended over the fire, is called the queen, or bride, and the  rest are called her maidens. These are distinguished from one another by  names given them for the occasion. She who sits next the fire, towards  the east, is called the todler; her companion on the left hand is called  the trodler;[15] and the rest have arbitrary names given them by the  bride, as Mrs. Baker, best and worst maids, &c. The operation is begun  by the todler, who takes a ball of the dough, forms it into a cake, and  then casts it on the bakeboard of the trodler, who beats it out a little  thinner. This being done, she, in her turn, throws it on the board of  her neighbour; and thus it goes round, from east to west, in the  direction of the course of the sun, until it comes to the toaster, by  which time it is as thin and smooth as a sheet of paper. The first cake  that is cast on the girdle is usually named as a gift to some man who is  known to have suffered from the infidelity of his wife, from a  superstitious notion, that thereby the rest will be preserved from  mischance. Sometimes the cake is so thin, as to be carried by the  current of the air up into the chimney. As the baking is wholly  performed by the hand, a great deal of noise is the consequence. The  beats, however, are not irregular, nor destitute of an agreeable  harmony, especially when they are accompanied with vocal music, which is  frequently the case. Great dexterity is necessary, not only to beat out  the cakes with no other instrument than the hand, so that no part of  them shall be thicker than another, but especially to cast them from one  board to another without ruffling or breaking them. The toasting  requires considerable skill; for which reason the most experienced  person in the company is chosen for that part of the work. One cake is  sent round in quick succession to another, so that none of the company  is suffered to be idle. The whole is a scene of activity, mirth, and  diversion. As there is no account, even by tradition itself, concerning  the origin of this custom, it must be very ancient. The bread thus baked  was, doubtless, never intended for common use. It is not easy to  conceive how mankind, especially in a rude age, would strictly observe  so many ceremonies, and be at so great pains in making a cake, which,  when folded together, makes but a scanty mouthful.[16] Besides, it is  always given away in presents to strangers who frequent the fair. The  custom seems to have been originally derived from paganism, and to  contain not a few of the sacred rites peculiar to that impure religion;  as the leavened dough, and the mixing it with sugar and spices, the  consecrated ground, &c.; but the particular deity, for whose honour  these cakes were at first made, is not, perhaps, easy to determine.  Probably it was no other than the one known in Scripture (Jer. 7 ch. 18  v.) by the name of the Queen of Heaven, and to whom cakes were"]]]
