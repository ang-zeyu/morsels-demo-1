[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15199"],[0,"The Reformed Librarie-Keeper (1650) (#2)"],[1," appointed keeper of the king's medals and  library, and on 28 October 1650 Dury was appointed his deputy. According  to Anthony a Wood, Dury \"did the drudgery of the place.\"[6] The books  and manuscripts were in terrible disorder and disarray, and Dury  carefully reorganized them. As soon as he took over, Dury stopped any  efforts to sell the books and ordered that the new chapel, built  originally for the wedding of King Charles I, be turned into a library.  He immediately ordered the printing of the Septuagint copy of the Bible  in the royal collection.    In the same year that he became deputy keeper, Dury wrote the following  tract, one of a dozen he composed in 1650 on topics ranging from the  educational to the ecclesiastical. Among the latter was his introduction  to Thomas Thorowgood's book contending that the American Indians are  descended from the Israelites, a work that also served as promotional  material for New England colonization.    That Dury's _The Reformed Librarie-Keeper_ is part of his reform program  preparatory to the onset of the millennium is apparent both from its  setting and its content. It was published in 1650 along with two other  tracts (not reprinted here)[7] and Dury's supplement to his _Reformed  School_, which itself had appeared a few months earlier. _The Reformed  School_ was a basic presentation of the ideas of Comenius, Hartlib, and  Dury for transforming the nature of education in such a way that from  infancy people would be directed in their striving toward universal  knowledge and spiritual betterment. The _Supplement to the Reformed  School_ deals with the role that universities should take in preparing  for the Kingdom of God, a role making them more actively part of the  world.    Having placed educational institutions in the scheme of things  preparatory to the millennium, Dury then proceeds to place library  keeping and libraries in this scheme as well. Unfortunately, according  to Dury, library keepers had traditionally regarded their positions as  opportunities for profit and gain, not for \"the service, which is to bee  don by them unto the Common-wealth of Israel, for the advancement of  Pietie and Learning\" (p. 15). Library keepers \"ought to becom Agents for  the advancement of universal Learning\" and not just mercenary people (p.  17). Their role ought not to be just to guard the books but to make them  available to those seeking universal knowledge and understanding of the  Kingdom of God.    The library and the library keeper can play important roles in making  knowledge available. As Dury points out, Oxford and Heidelberg have  failed to do so. Dury's work enumerates very practical problems that  need to be solved and integrates them into an overall picture of the  library keeper, the library, the school, and the church--all fundamental  components of a better world, if properly reformed. Reforming involves  practical changes directed by the spiritual goal of preparing for the  millennium. And it should be noticed that while Dury had time to worry  about how much librarians should be paid and how books should be  classified, and while he was occupied in getting the king's books in  their proper place on the shelf, he was also convinced that the  penultimate events before the onset of the millennium were about to take  place. A month after his official appointment as deputy library keeper,  Dury wrote the preface, dated 28 November 1650, to Abraham von  Franckenberg's _Clavis Apocalyptica_. This work in Dury's translation of  1651 states on the title page that it offers a key to the prophecies in  the books of Daniel and Revelation and \"that the Prophetical Numbers com  to an end with the year of our Lord 1655.\" The work, which Dury strongly  endorses, lists as events \"which are shortly to com to pass, collected  out of the XI and XVI Chapters of the REVELATION,\" the destruction of  the city of Rome, the end of the Turkish Empire, the conversion of the  Jews, and the ruin of the whole papacy. Thereupon, the Devil will be  cast out and shut up in the bottomless pit, and the Son of God will take  \"possession of the Kingdom\" and reign for the millennium (pp. [164-65]).    As is all too evident, Dury's reform projects did not lead to the  millennium. He was active in England until sent abroad in 1654 as  Cromwell's unofficial agent. Again he traveled all over Protestant  Europe negotiating to reunite the churches. After the Restoration he was  unable to return to England and lived out his life on the Continent  trying to bring about Christian reunion. One of his last works, which  has not been located, was a shady _Touchant l'intelligence de  l'Apocalypse par l'Apocalypse meme_ of 1674. His daughter married Henry  Oldenburg, who became a secretary of the Royal Society of England and  who helped bring about some of the scientific reforms Dury had  advocated.    _Richard H. Popkin  Washington University_           *       *       *       *       *    John Dury's place in the intellectual and religious life of  seventeenth-century England and Europe is amply demonstrated in the  preceding part of the introduction. This section focuses on _The  Reformed Librarie-Keeper_ itself, which was printed in 1650 with the  subheading _Two copies of Letters concerning the Place and Office of a  Librarie-Keeper_ (p. 15). The first letter concentrates on practical  questions of the organization and administration of the library, the  second relates the librarian's function to educational goals and, above  all else, to the mission of the Christian religion. The work's two-part  structure is a clue to a proper understanding of the genesis of _The  Reformed Librarie-Keeper_ and to its meaning and puts in ironic  perspective its usefulness for later academic librarianship.    Because _The Reformed Librarie-Keeper_ appeared in the same year that  Dury became deputy librarian of the King's Library in St. James's  Palace, it has been assumed that he probably wrote the pamphlet as a  form of self-promotion to secure the job. An anonymous article in _The  Library_ in 1892, for instance, speculates that the pamphlet may have  been \"composed for the special purpose of the Author's advancement\" and  that Milton and Samuel Hartlib urged its production \"to forward his  claims\" while the Council of State was debating what to do with Charles  I's books.[8] Certainly the final sentence of the tract, with its  references to \"the Hous\" and \"the Counsels of leading men in this  Common-wealth\" (p. 31), suggests a connection with the debate, but the  tone of religious zeal that permeates the work, and especially the  second letter, seems to transcend any specific occasion. Moreover,  Hartlib, Dury's longtime friend and associate in millenarian causes and  the recipient and editor of these letters, claims that they and the  other, disparate works he selected for the volume are all \"_fruits of  som of my Solicitations and Negotiations for the advancement of  Learning_\" and as such \"_are but preparatives towards that perfection  which wee may exspect by the advancement of the Kingdom of Christ,  wherein the Communion of Saints, by the graces of the Spirit, will  swallow up all these poor Rudiments of knowledg, which wee now grope  after by so manie helps_\" (sig. A2r-v).    There is, in fact, no way of knowing with certainty if Dury's motives  were \"impure,\" especially since the exact date of the tract cannot be  determined, no entry existing for it in the Stationers' Register.  According to one of Dury's biographers, but with no reference to source,  the pamphlet was printed by William Dugard \"shortly after\" the latter's  release from prison in the early spring of 1650.[9] The Calendar of  State Papers and the records of Bulstrode Whitelocke indicate that Dury  was not officially considered for the library post before late summer  and not appointed until 28 October.[10]    The contents of the letters themselves reveal Dury far ahead of his time  in his conception of the Complete Librarian, but later commentators have  generally not understood that the administrative reforms he advocated  were inseparable from his idea of the sacramental nature of the  librarian's office--and so have tended to dismiss the second letter  because it \"merely repeats the ideas of the first with less practical  suggestion and in a more declamatory style.\"[11] Such a comment  illustrates how far we are from Dury's (and the age's) purposes and  hopes, and it shows a great misunderstanding of the religious and moral  context within which, for Dury, all human activity took place. As  Professor Popkin has shown, Dury considered libraries fundamental to the  preparation for the millennium: they housed the texts indispensable to  the spread of learning, which in turn was prerequisite to religious  unity and peace on earth and ultimately to the millennium itself; for  with enough of the right books, the Christian world could convert the  Jews, that final step which was to herald the reign of Christ on earth.  When, in the second letter, Dury refers to the \"stewardship\" of the  librarian he is speaking literally, not metaphorically.    But if libraries were to serve their purpose in the grand scheme--that  is, to make texts easily available--extensive reforms were necessary,  and that is the burden of the first letter. Dury's cardinal principle is  that libraries should be _useful_ to people: \"It is true that a fair  Librarie, is ... an ornament and credit to the place where it is [the  'jewel box' concept]; ... yet in effect it is no more then a dead Bodie  as now it is constituted, in comparison of what it might bee, if it were  animated with a publick Spirit to keep and use it, and _ordered as it  might bee for publick service_\" (p. 17, my emphasis). The public that  Dury refers to is an academic faculty and not the general public.

INDEX OF NAMES    INDEX OF SUBJECTS          CHAPTER I    THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICS      The now numerous public which tries with some success to keep abreast  of the movement in science, from seeing its mental habits every day  upset, and from occasionally witnessing unexpected discoveries that  produce a more lively sensation from their reaction on social life, is  led to suppose that we live in a really exceptional epoch, scored by  profound crises and illustrated by extraordinary discoveries, whose  singularity surpasses everything known in the past. Thus we often hear  it said that physics, in particular, has of late years undergone a  veritable revolution; that all its principles have been made new, that  all the edifices constructed by our fathers have been overthrown, and  that on the field thus cleared has sprung up the most abundant harvest  that has ever enriched the domain of science.    It is in fact true that the crop becomes richer and more fruitful,  thanks to the development of our laboratories, and that the quantity  of seekers has considerably increased in all countries, while their  quality has not diminished. We should be sustaining an absolute  paradox, and at the same time committing a crying injustice, were we  to contest the high importance of recent progress, and to seek to  diminish the glory of contemporary physicists. Yet it may be as well  not to give way to exaggerations, however pardonable, and to guard  against facile illusions. On closer examination it will be"]]]
