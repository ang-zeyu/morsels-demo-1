Maybe boar's head stuffed  with sugar-plums did not agree with him (it wouldn't with me, I know),  and he had had enough of sack and mead; so he slipped from the noisy  revel to steal a quiet moonlight hour with his beloved Elgiva.    Perhaps, from the casement, standing hand-in-hand, they were watching the  calm moonlight on the river, while from the distant halls the boisterous  revelry floated in broken bursts of faint-heard din and tumult.    Then brutal Odo and St. Dunstan force their rude way into the quiet room,  and hurl coarse insults at the sweet-faced Queen, and drag poor Edwy back  to the loud clamour of the drunken brawl.    Years later, to the crash of battle-music, Saxon kings and Saxon revelry  were buried side by side, and Kingston's greatness passed away for a  time, to rise once more when Hampton Court became the palace of the  Tudors and the Stuarts, and the royal barges strained at their moorings  on the river's bank, and bright-cloaked gallants swaggered down the  water-steps to cry: \"What Ferry, ho!  Gadzooks, gramercy.\"    Many of the old houses, round about, speak very plainly of those days  when Kingston was a royal borough, and nobles and courtiers lived there,  near their King, and the long road to the palace gates was gay all day  with clanking steel and prancing palfreys, and rustling silks and  velvets, and fair faces.  The large and spacious houses, with their  oriel, latticed windows, their huge fireplaces, and their gabled roofs,  breathe of the days of hose and doublet, of pearl-embroidered stomachers,  and complicated oaths.  They were upraised in the days \"when men knew how  to build.\"  The hard red bricks have only grown more firmly set with  time, and their oak stairs do not creak and grunt when you try to go down  them quietly.    Speaking of oak staircases reminds me that there is a magnificent carved  oak staircase in one of the houses in Kingston.  It is a shop now, in the  market-place, but it was evidently once the mansion of some great  personage.  A friend of mine, who lives at Kingston, went in there to buy  a hat one day, and, in a thoughtless moment, put his hand in his pocket  and paid for it then and there.    The shopman (he knows my friend) was naturally a little staggered at  first; but, quickly recovering himself, and feeling that something ought  to be done to encourage this sort of thing, asked our hero if he would  like to see some fine old carved oak.  My friend said he would, and the  shopman, thereupon, took him through the shop, and up the staircase of  the house.  The balusters were a superb piece of workmanship, and the  wall all the way up was oak-panelled, with carving that would have done  credit to a palace.    From the stairs, they went into the drawing-room, which was a large,  bright room, decorated with a somewhat startling though cheerful paper of  a blue ground.  There was nothing, however, remarkable about the  apartment, and my friend wondered why he had been brought there.  The  proprietor went up to the paper, and tapped it.  It gave forth a wooden  sound.    \"Oak,\" he explained.  \"All carved oak, right up to the ceiling, just the  same as you saw on the staircase.\"    \"But, great Caesar! man,\" expostulated my friend; \"you don't mean to say  you have covered over carved oak with blue wall-paper?\"    \"Yes,\" was the reply: \"it was expensive work.  Had to match-board it all  over first, of course.  But the room looks cheerful now.  It was awful  gloomy before.\"    I can't say I altogether blame the man (which is doubtless a great relief  to his mind).  From his point of view, which would be that of the average  householder, desiring to take life as lightly as possible, and not that  of the old-curiosity-shop maniac, there is reason on his side.  Carved  oak is very pleasant to look at, and to have a little of, but it is no  doubt somewhat depressing to live in, for those whose fancy does not lie  that way.  It would be like living in a church.    No, what was sad in his case was that he, who didn't care for carved oak,  should have his drawing-room panelled with it, while people who do care  for it have to pay enormous prices to get it.  It seems to be the rule of  this world.  Each person has what he doesn't want, and other people have  what he does want.    Married men have wives, and don't seem to want them; and young single  fellows cry out that they can't get them.  Poor people who can hardly  keep themselves have eight hearty children.  Rich old couples, with no  one to leave their money to, die childless.    Then there are girls with lovers.  The girls that have lovers never want  them.  They say they would rather be without them, that they bother them,  and why don't they go and make love to Miss Smith and Miss Brown, who are  plain and elderly, and haven't got any lovers?  They themselves don't  want lovers.  They never mean to marry.    It does not do to dwell on these things; it makes one so sad.    There was a boy at our school, we used to call him Sandford and Merton.  His real name was Stivvings.  He was the most extraordinary lad I ever  came across.  I believe he really liked study.  He used to get into awful  rows for sitting up in bed and reading Greek; and as for French irregular  verbs there was simply no keeping him away from them.  He was full of  weird and unnatural notions about being a credit to his parents and an  honour to the school; and he yearned to win prizes, and grow up and be a  clever man, and had all those sorts of weak-minded ideas.  I never knew  such a strange creature, yet harmless, mind you, as the babe unborn.    Well, that boy used to get ill about twice a week, so that he couldn't go  to school.  There never was such a boy to get ill as that Sandford and  Merton.  If there was any known disease going within ten miles of him, he  had it, and had it badly.  He would take bronchitis in the dog-days, and  have hay-fever at Christmas.  After a six weeks' period of drought, he  would be stricken down with rheumatic fever; and he would go out in a  November fog and come home with a sunstroke.    They put him under laughing-gas one year, poor lad, and drew all his  teeth, and gave him a false set, because he suffered so terribly with  toothache; and then it turned to neuralgia and ear-ache.  He was never  without a cold, except once for nine weeks while he had scarlet fever;  and he always had chilblains.  During the great cholera scare of 1871,  our neighbourhood was singularly free from it.  There was only one  reputed case in the whole parish: that case was young Stivvings.    He had to stop in bed when he was ill, and eat chicken and custards and  hot-house grapes; and he would lie there and sob, because they wouldn't  let him do Latin exercises, and took his German grammar away from him.    And we other boys, who would have sacrificed ten terms of our school-life  for the sake of being ill for a day, and had no desire whatever to give  our parents any excuse for being stuck-up about us, couldn't catch so  much as a stiff neck.  We fooled about in draughts, and it did us good,  and freshened us up; and we took things to make us sick, and they made us  fat, and gave us an appetite.  Nothing we could think of seemed to make  us ill until the holidays began.  Then, on the breaking-up day, we caught  colds, and whooping cough, and all kinds of disorders, which lasted till  the term recommenced; when, in spite of everything we could manoeuvre to  the contrary, we would get suddenly well again, and be better than ever.    Such is life; and we are but as grass that is cut down, and put into the  oven and baked.    To go back to the carved-oak question, they must have had very fair  notions of the artistic and the beautiful, our great-great-grandfathers.  Why, all our art treasures of to-day are only the dug-up commonplaces of  three or four hundred years ago.  I wonder if there is real intrinsic  beauty in the old soup-plates, beer-mugs, and candle-snuffers that we  prize so now, or if it is only the halo of age glowing around them that  gives them their charms in our eyes.  The \"old blue\" that we hang about  our walls as ornaments were the common every-day household utensils of a  few centuries ago; and the pink shepherds and the yellow shepherdesses  that we hand round now for all our friends to gush over, and pretend they  understand, were the unvalued mantel-ornaments that the mother of the  eighteenth century would have given the baby to suck when he cried.    Will it be the same in the future?  Will the prized treasures of to-day  always be the cheap trifles of the day before?  Will rows of our  willow-pattern dinner-plates be ranged above the chimneypieces of the  great in the years 2000 and odd?  Will the white cups with the gold rim  and the beautiful gold flower inside (species unknown), that our Sarah  Janes now break in sheer light-heartedness of spirit, be carefully  mended, and stood upon a bracket, and dusted only by the lady of the  house?    [Picture: China dog] That china dog that ornaments the bedroom of my  furnished lodgings.  It is a white dog.  Its eyes blue.  Its nose is a  delicate red, with spots.  Its head is painfully erect, its expression is  amiability carried to verge of imbecility.  I do not admire it myself.  Considered as a work of art, I may say it irritates me.  Thoughtless  friends jeer at it, and even my landlady herself has no admiration for  it, and excuses its presence by the circumstance that her aunt gave it to  her.    But in 200 years' time it is more than probable that that dog will be dug  up from somewhere or other, minus its legs, and with its tail broken, and  will be sold for old china, and put in a glass cabinet.  And people will  pass it round, and admire it.  They will be struck by the wonderful depth  of the colour on the nose, and speculate as to how beautiful the bit of  the tail that is lost no doubt"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30802"],[0,"Commentaries on the Laws of England, Book the First (#10)"],[1,"established certain laws of  motion, to which all moveable bodies must conform. And, to descend  from the greatest operations to the smallest, when a workman forms a  clock, or other piece of mechanism, he establishes at his own pleasure  certain arbitrary laws for it's direction; as that the hand shall  describe a given space in a given time; to which law as long as the  work conforms, so long it continues in perfection, and answers the end  of it's formation.    IF we farther advance, from mere inactive matter to vegetable and  animal life, we shall find them still governed by laws; more numerous  indeed, but equally fixed and invariable. The whole progres of plants,  from the seed to the root, and from thence to the seed again;--the  method of animal nutrition, digestion, secretion, and all other  branches of vital oeconomy;--are not left to chance, or the will of  the creature itself, but are performed in a wondrous involuntary  manner, and guided by unerring rules laid down by the great creator.    THIS then is the general signification of law, a rule of action  dictated by some superior being; and in those creatures that have  neither the power to think, nor to will, such laws must be invariably  obeyed, so long as the creature itself subsists, for it's existence  depends on that obedience. But laws, in their more confined sense, and  in which it is our present business to consider them, denote the  rules, not of action in general, but of _human_ action or conduct:  that is, the precepts by which man, the noblest of all sublunary  beings, a creature endowed with both reason and freewill, is commanded  to make use of those faculties in the general regulation of his  behaviour.    MAN, considered as a creature, must necessarily be subject to the laws  of his creator, for he is entirely a dependent being. A being,  independent of any other, has no rule to pursue, but such as he  prescribes to himself; but a state of dependance will inevitably  oblige the inferior to take the will of him, on whom he depends, as  the rule of his conduct: not indeed in every particular, but in all  those points wherein his dependance consists. This principle therefore  has more or less extent and effect, in proportion as the superiority  of the one and the dependance of the other is greater or less,  absolute or limited. And consequently as man depends absolutely upon  his maker for every thing, it is necessary that he should in all  points conform to his maker's will.    THIS will of his maker is called the law of nature. For as God, when  he created matter, and endued it with a principle of mobility,  established certain rules for the perpetual direction of that motion;  so, when he created man, and endued him with freewill to conduct  himself in all parts of life, he laid down certain immutable laws of  human nature, whereby that freewill is in some degree regulated and  restrained, and gave him also the faculty of reason to discover the  purport of those laws.    CONSIDERING the creator only as a being of infinite _power_, he was  able unquestionably to have prescribed whatever laws he pleased to his  creature, man, however unjust or severe. But as he is also a being of  infinite _wisdom_, he has laid down only such laws as were founded in  those relations of justice, that existed in the nature of things  antecedent to any positive precept. These are the eternal, immutable  laws of good and evil, to which the creator himself in all his  dispensations conforms; and which he has enabled human reason to  discover, so far as they are necessary for the conduct of human  actions. Such among others are these principles: that we should live  honestly, should hurt nobody, and should render to every one it's due;  to which three general precepts Justinian[a] has reduced the whole  doctrine of law.    [Footnote a: _Juris praecepta sunt haec, honeste vivere, alterum non  laedere, suum cuique tribuere._ _Inst._ 1. 1. 3.]    BUT if the discovery of these first principles of the law of nature  depended only upon the due exertion of right reason, and could not  otherwise be attained than by a chain of metaphysical disquisitions,  mankind would have wanted some inducement to have quickened their  inquiries, and the greater part of the world would have rested content  in mental indolence, and ignorance it's inseparable companion. As  therefore the creator is a being, not only of infinite _power_, and  _wisdom_, but also of infinite _goodness_, he has been pleased so to  contrive the constitution and frame of humanity, that we should want  no other prompter to enquire after and pursue the rule of right, but  only our own self-love, that universal principle of action. For he has  so intimately connected, so inseparably interwoven the laws of eternal  justice with the happiness of each individual, that the latter cannot  be attained but by observing the former; and, if the former be  punctually obeyed, it cannot but induce the latter. In consequence of  which mutual connection of justice and human felicity, he has not  perplexed the law of nature with a multitude of abstracted rules and  precepts, referring merely to the fitness or unfitness of things, as  some have vainly surmised; but has graciously reduced the rule of  obedience to this one paternal precept, \"that man should pursue his  own happiness.\" This is the foundation of what we call ethics, or  natural law. For the several articles into which it is branched in our  systems, amount to no more than demonstrating, that this or that  action tends to man's real happiness, and therefore very justly  concluding that the performance of it is a part of the law of nature;  or, on the other hand, that this or that action is destructive of  man's real happiness, and therefore that the law of nature forbids it.    THIS law of nature, being co-eval with mankind and dictated by God  himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other. It is  binding over all the globe, in all countries, and at all times: no  human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this; and such of them  as are valid derive all their force, and all their authority,  mediately or immediately, from this original.    BUT in order to apply this to the particular exigencies of each  individual, it is still necessary to have recourse to reason; whose  office it is to discover, as was before observed, what the law of  nature directs in every circumstance of life; by considering, what  method will tend the most effectually to our own substantial  happiness. And if our reason were always, as in our first ancestor  before his transgression, clear and perfect, unruffled by passions,  unclouded by prejudice, unimpaired by disease or intemperance, the  task would be pleasant and easy; we should need no other guide but  this. But every man now finds the contrary in his own experience; that  his reason is corrupt, and his understanding full of ignorance and  error.    THIS has given manifold occasion for the benign interposition of  divine providence; which, in companion to the frailty, the  imperfection, and the blindness of human reason, hath been pleased,  at sundry times and in divers manners, to discover and enforce it's  laws by an immediate and direct revelation. The doctrines thus  delivered we call the revealed or divine law, and they are to be found  only in the holy scriptures. These precepts, when revealed, are found  upon comparison to be really a part of the original law of nature, as  they tend in all their consequences to man's felicity. But we are not  from thence to conclude that the knowlege of these truths was  attainable by reason, in it's present corrupted state; since we find  that, until they were revealed, they were hid from the wisdom of ages.  As then the moral precepts of this law are indeed of the same original  with those of the law of nature, so their intrinsic obligation is of  equal strength and perpetuity. Yet undoubtedly the revealed law is  (humanly speaking) of infinitely more authority than what we generally  call the natural law. Because one is the law of nature, expressly  declared so to be by God himself; the other is only what, by the  assistance of human reason, we imagine to be that law. If we could be  as certain of the latter as we are of the former, both would have an  equal authority; but, till then, they can never be put in any  competition together.    UPON these two foundations, the law of nature and the law of  revelation, depend all human laws; that is to say, no human laws  should be suffered to contradict these. There is, it is true, a great  number of indifferent points, in which both the divine law and the  natural leave a man at his own liberty; but which are found necessary  for the benefit of society to be restrained within certain limits. And  herein it is that human laws have their greatest force and efficacy;  for, with regard to such points as are not indifferent, human laws are  only declaratory of, and act in subordination to, the former. To  instance in the case of murder: this is expressly forbidden by the  divine, and demonstrably by the natural law; and from these  prohibitions arises the true unlawfulness of this crime. Those human  laws, that annex a punishment to it, do not at all increase it's moral  guilt, or superadd any fresh obligation _in foro conscientiae_ to  abstain from it's perpetration. Nay, if any human law should allow or  injoin us to commit it, we are bound to transgress that human law, or  else we must offend both the natural and the divine. But with regard  to matters that are in themselves indifferent, and are not commanded  or forbidden by those superior laws; such, for instance, as exporting  of wool into foreign countries; here the inferior legislature has  scope and opportunity to interpose, and to make that action unlawful  which before was not so.    IF man were to live in a state of nature, unconnected with other  individuals,"]]]
