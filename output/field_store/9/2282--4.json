In  the library on the Esquiline the height was only three feet six inches; at  Herculaneum about six feet.    I can find no hint of any doors, or curtains, in front of the  pigeon-holes. That the ends of the rolls (_frontes_) were visible, is, I  think, quite clear from what Cicero says of his own library after the  construction of his shelves (_pegmata_); and the various devices for  making rolls attractive seem to me to prove that they were intended to be  seen.    A representation of rolls arranged on the system which I have attempted to  describe, occurs on a piece of sculpture (fig. 11) found at Neumagen near  Treves in the seventeenth century, among the ruins of a fortified camp  attributed to Constantine the Great[87]. Two divisions, full of rolls, are  shewn, from which a man, presumably the librarian, is selecting one. The  ends of the rolls are furnished with tickets.    [Illustration: Fig. 11. A Roman taking down a roll from its place in a  library.]    The system of pigeon-holes terminated, in all probability, in a cornice.  The explorers of Herculaneum depose to the discovery of such an ornament  there.    The wall-space above the book-cases was decorated with the likenesses of  celebrated authors--either philosophers, if the owner of the library  wished to bring into prominence his adhesion to one of the fashionable  systems--or authors, dead and living, or personal friends. This obvious  form of decoration was, in all probability, used at Pergamon[88]; Pollio,  as we have seen, introduced it into Rome: and Pliny, who calls it a  novelty (_novitium inventum_), deposes to its general adoption[89]. We are  not told how these portraits were commonly treated--whether they were  busts standing clear of the wall on the book-cases; or bracketed against  the wall; or forming part of its decoration, in plaster-work or distemper.  A suitable inscription accompanied them. Martial has preserved for us a  charming specimen of one of these complimentary stanzas--for such they  undoubtedly would be in the case of a contemporary--to be placed beneath  his own portrait in a friend's library:      Hoc tibi sub nostra breve carmen imagine vivat      Quam non obscuris iungis, Avite, viris:    _Ille ego sum nulli nugarum laude secundus,      Quem non miraris, sed puto, lector, amas.    Maiores maiora sonent: mihi parva locuto      Sufficit in vestras saepe redire manus_[90].      Placed, with my betters, on your study-wall    Let these few lines, Avitus, me recall:    _To foremost rank in trifles I was raised;    I think men loved me, though they never praised.    Let greater poets greater themes profess:    My modest lines seek but the hand's caress    That tells me, reader, of thy tenderness._    The beautiful alto-relievo in the Lateran Museum, Rome, representing an  actor selecting a mask, contains a contrivance for reading a roll (fig.  12) which may have been usual in libraries and elsewhere, though I have  not met with another instance of it. A vertical support attached to the  table on which two masks and a MS. are lying, carries a desk with a rim  along its lower edge and one of its sides. The roll is partially opened,  the closed portion lying towards the left side of the desk, next the rim.  The roll may be supposed to contain the actor's part[91].    It is much to be regretted that we have no definite information as to the  way in which the great public libraries built by Augustus were fitted up;  but I see no reason for supposing that their fittings differed from those  of private libraries.    [Illustration: Fig. 12. Desk to support a roll while it is being read.]    When books (_codices_), of a shape similar to that with which modern  librarians have to deal, had to be accommodated as well as rolls, it is  manifest that rectangular spaces not more than a few inches wide would be  singularly inconvenient. They were therefore discarded in favour of a  press (_armarium_), a piece of furniture which would hold rolls  (_volumina_) as well as books (_codices_), and was in fact, as I shall  shew, used for both purposes. The word (_armarium_) occurs commonly in  Cicero, and other writers of the best period, for a piece of furniture in  which valuables of all kinds, and household gear, were stowed away; and  Vitruvius[92] uses it for a book-case. A critic, he says, \"produced from  certain presses an infinite number of rolls.\" In later Latin writers--that  is from the middle of the first century A.D.--no other word, speaking  generally, occurs.    The jurist Ulpian, who died A.D. 228, in a discussion as to what is  comprised under the term _liber_, decides in favour of including all rolls  (_volumina_) of whatever material, and then considers the question whether  _codices_ come under the same category or not--thereby shewing that in his  day both forms of books were in use. Again, when a library (_bibliotheca_)  has been bequeathed, it is questioned whether the bequest includes merely  the press or presses (_armarium vel armaria_), or the books as well[93].    The Ulpian Library, or rather Libraries, in Trajan's Forum, built about  114 A.D.[94], were fitted up with presses, as we learn from the passage in  Vopiscus which I have already quoted; and when the ruins of the section of  that library which stood next to the Quirinal Hill were excavated by the  French, a very interesting trace of one of these presses was discovered.  Nibby, the Roman antiquary, thus describes it:        Beyond the above-mentioned bases [of the columns in the      portico] some remains of the inside of the room became      visible on the right. They consisted of a piece of      curtain-wall, admirably constructed of brick, part of      the side-wall, with a rectangular niche of large size in      the form of a press (_in foggia di armadio_). One      ascended to this by three steps, with a landing-place in      front of them, on which it was possible to stand with      ease. On the sides of this niche there still exist      traces of the hinges, on which the panels and the      wickets, probably of bronze, rested[95].    It seems to me that we have here an early instance, perhaps the earliest,  of those presses in the thickness of the wall which were so common  afterwards in the monasteries and in private libraries also. A similar  press, on a smaller scale, is described by the younger Pliny: \"My  bedroom,\" he says, \"has a press let into the wall which does duty as a  library, and holds books not merely to be read, but read over and over  again[96].\"    It must not, however, be supposed that cupboards were always, or even  usually, sunk into the wall in Roman times. They were detached pieces of  furniture, not unlike the wardrobes in which ladies hang their dresses at  the present day, except that they were fitted with a certain number of  horizontal shelves, and were used for various purposes according to the  requirements of their owners. For instance, there is a sarcophagus in the  Museo Nazionale at Rome, on which is represented a shoemaker at work. In  front of him is a cupboard, exactly like those I am about to describe, on  the top of which several pairs of shoes are set out.    I can, however, produce three representations of such presses being used  by the Romans to contain books.    The first occurs on a marble sarcophagus (fig. 13), now in the garden of  the Villa Balestra, Rome, where I had the good fortune to find it in  1898[97]; and Professor Petersen, of the German Archaeological School, was  so kind as to have it photographed for me. He assigns the work to about  200 A.D.    [Illustration: Fig. 13. A Roman reading a roll in front of a press  (_armarium_).    From a photograph of a sarcophagus in the garden of the Villa Balestra.  Rome.]    In the central portion, 21 in. high, by 15 1/2 in. wide, is a seated  figure, reading a roll. In front of him is a cupboard, the doors of which  are open. It is fitted with two shelves, on the uppermost of which are  eight rolls, the ends of which are turned to the spectator. On the next  shelf is something which looks like a dish or shallow cup. The lower part  of the press is solid. Perhaps a second cupboard is intended. Above, it is  finished off with a cornice, on which rests a very puzzling object. There  are a few faint lines on the marble, which Professor Petersen believes are  intended to represent surgical instruments, and so to indicate the  profession of the seated figure[98]. There is a Greek inscription on the  sarcophagus, but it merely warns posterity not to disturb the bones of the  deceased[99].    The second representation (fig. 14) is from the tomb of Galla Placidia, at  Ravenna. It occurs in a mosaic on the wall of the chapel in which she was  buried, A.D. 449[100]; and was presumably executed before that date. The  press closely resembles the one on the Roman sarcophagus, but it is  evidently intended to indicate a taller piece of furniture, and it  terminates in a pediment. There are two shelves, on which lie the four  Gospels, each as a separate _codex_, indicated by the name of the  Evangelist above it. This press rests upon a stout frame, the legs of  which are kept in position by a cross-piece nearly as thick as themselves.    [Illustration: Fig. 14. Press containing the four Gospels.    From a mosaic above the tomb of the Empress Galla Placidia at Ravenna.]    The third representation of an _armarium_ (fig. 15) occurs in the  manuscript of the Vulgate now in the Laurentian Library at Florence, known  as the _Codex Amiatinus_, from the Cistercian convent "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26393"],[0,"The Medicinal Plants of the Philippines (#10)"],[1,"used for constipation.

Nom. Vulg.--_Cacao._    Uses.--The roasted bean ground with sugar constitutes chocolate,  one of the most generally used foods of the Philippines.    It is very nutritious by virtue of the fat and sugar it contains,  but all stomachs do not bear it well and its use is the unsuspected  cause of much dyspepsia. The custom of drinking it very hot and  following with a large quantity of cold water is a very common  cause of dilatation of the stomach in the Philippines. The seed  of the cacao contains several substances: cacao butter, albumin,  theobromine, starch, glucose, gum, tartaric acid, free or combined,  tannin, and mineral substances. Of these the butter and theobromine  are the most important.    Theobromine (C_7_H_8_N_4_O_2_) is a weak alkaloid, crystalline,  slightly bitter, slightly soluble in cold water, more soluble in hot  water, less soluble in alcohol and ether; stable in the air up to  100°; sublimes without decomposition at 290° in microscopic crystals  of the form of rhomboid prisms ending in an octohedric point (Keller).    This alkaloid is very little used in therapeutics and its physiological  action is said to be analogous to that of caffeine but weaker. It  is better to use the salt of the alkaloid, and that most frequently  employed is the salicylate of soda and theobromine in doses of from  2 to 6 grams daily in solution or pill. Lately, however, Dr. Gram  has maintained that theobromine is a powerful diuretic operating when  other diuretics fail and further that this effect is produced without  injuring the heart. The double salt is non-toxic, though sometimes in  exceedingly weak patients it produces vertigo. Dr. Gram administers  6 grams a day in one-gram doses.    Cacao butter is a white substance, slightly yellowish, unctuous to  the touch, brittle; with the agreeable odor peculiar to cacao, and a  sweet and pleasant taste. Its density is 0.961, it melts at 30°-33°,  and solidifies at 25°. It dissolves in 20 parts of boiling alcohol,  in 100 parts of cold alcohol and in twice its weight of benzin. Cacao  butter is obtained by grinding or mashing the roasted seeds in a hot  apparatus and mixing the mass with a fifth or tenth of its weight of  boiling water. It is then pressed between two hot iron plates and  the butter thus obtained is refined by boiling water. It is then  put aside in earthen pans, or still better, in moulds, where it  solidifies. It does not easily become rancid and, for this reason,  enters into the composition of many ointments and pomades, or is  used alone. It serves as the base for suppositories and is, finally,  a highly valued cosmetic. A common substitute is made by mixing oil  of almonds, wax and animal fat.    Before going further let us describe the composition of Spanish  chocolate according to the French chemist Boussingault:              Cane sugar                  41.40  grams.          Cacao butter                29.24  grams.          Starch, glucose              1.48  grams.          Theobromine                  1.93  grams.          Asparagin                    a trace          Albumin                      6.25  grams.          Gum                          1.42  grams.          Tartaric acid                1.98  grams.          Tannin and coloring matter   0.022 grams.          Soluble cellulose            6.21  grams.          Ash                          2.34  grams.          Water                        4.36  grams.          Undetermined material        3.27  grams.                                     ------                                     100.00      Botanical Description.--A small tree about 10° high, with leaves broad,  6-12' long, hanging or drooping, lanceolate, entire, and somewhat  pubescent on both surfaces. Petioles very short with 2 deciduous  stipules at the base. Flowers in clusters on the roots, trunk and  branches. Peduncle very long. Nectary divided in 5 parts, straight,  awl-shaped and 2-nerved. Calyx, 5 sepals. Corolla, 5 petals curved  upward in the form of a bow as far as the middle, where they form a  hollow with two little horns; then curving downwards, then upwards,  widening at the end, the edge finely dentate. Stamens 5, inserted on  the nectary, and alternating with the lobes of the latter. Anthers  2 on each filament, concealed in the hollows of the petals. Ovary  globose. Style awl-shaped. Stigma cleft almost to the middle,  5-parted. Fruit broad, spindle-shaped, 4' or more long, dark reddish,  warty, 10-ribbed, with 5 compartments each containing many compressed,  ovoid seeds.    Habitat.--Common in orchards and gardens throughout the islands.          GERANIACEÆ.    Geranium Family.        _Oxalis corniculata_, L. (_O. Acetosella_, Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Taingan dogá, Susokayoli_, Tag.; _Darasig_, Vis.;  _Malabalugbug dagis_, _Ayo_, _Kongi_, _Yayo_, Pam.; _Indian Sorrel_,  Eng.    Uses.--The part of the plant used in medicine is the leaf which is acid  by virtue of the potassium oxalate which it contains. The decoction is  used internally as an antipyretic in fevers and in dysentery. Mistaking  the properties of the plant it is given for vesical calculus which,  if composed of oxalates, would be increased instead of diminished by  the treatment. In fact the salt of sorrel in the leaves contains a  large quantity of oxalic acid mixed with potassium oxalate. In China,  India and the Philippines the entire plant is used as an antiscorbutic.    The cold infusion of the leaves is given internally in doses of from  30 to 60 grams, but it is not a medicine to be given indiscriminately,  because in addition to its power of adding to the bulk of calculi of  the oxalates, the contained potassium oxalate is poisonous in doses  of 25 to 30 grams. If a concentrated solution is taken, it operates as  a corrosive poison, producing violent pains in the stomach, vomiting,  faintness and great weakness. If the solution is dilute its absorption  is rapid and it operates very energetically. When a patient is poisoned  by a concentrated solution, the stomach-pump is contraindicated,  because the mucous membrane of the organ is corroded and ulcerated;  if by a dilute solution, use the pump to remove as much of the poison  as possible. The best antidote is a watery solution of a soluble salt  of lime, _i. e._, the saccharate, which forms an insoluble salt with  oxalic acid.    The juice of the leaves is an antidote for the _Datura_  (Stramonium). In India they make a decoction of the plant, mix it with  onion juice and apply it to the head as a fomentation in hemicrania.    Botanical Description.--A plant 1° high, with a creeping, glabrous  stem, leaves horizontal, ternate with common long petiole. Leaflets  sessile, obcordate, with downy borders. Flowers axillary or terminal,  from 1 to 3 in number on a common long peduncle. The pedicel is  also long. Calyx common to the family. Corolla, 5 petals ending in  small claws. Stamens 10, monadelphous, the 5 shorter ones bearing  each a small gland on the outer surface of the base. Ovary large,  fluted. Styles 5, short. Stigmas hemispherical. Seed vessel pyramidal,  containing many seeds enveloped in an elastic aril by which they are  ejected when the fruit opens.    Habitat.--Abundant in Luzon, Panay and Cebú.        _Biophytum sensitivum_, DC. (_B. cumiagianum_, Turez.; _Oxalis  sensitivum_, Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Makahiya_, _Damonghiya_, Tag.; _Mahihiin_, Iloc.    Uses.--A decoction of the leaves is used internally as an  expectorant. The bruised leaves are used as an application to wounds  and contusions. In Java the decoction is used internally in asthma,  phthisis and snake bites.    The peculiar property which this plant possesses of closing its  leaves when touched, has caused the natives of India to attribute  to it mysterious virtues. Symbolism has determined its therapeutic  application and the Hindoos pretend that it endows with delicacy and  modesty women who lack these virtues and that it restores virginity.    Botanical Description.--A plant about 7' high. Stem straight, nodose  and without branches. Leaves abruptly pinnate, the place of the odd  leaflet taken by a stylet. The leaflets nearly linear with a small  point at the apex, 11-13 pairs, 2 stipules to each pair. Common  petioles long, cleft at the base and disposed in"]]]
