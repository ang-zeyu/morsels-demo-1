But  if, unfortunately, this deadly poison should by some mistake be taken  inwardly, the most effectual remedy will be a table-spoonful of powdered  charcoal, mixed with honey, butter, or treacle, and swallowed  immediately. Two hours afterwards, take an emetic or an opening draught,  to cleanse away the whole from the stomach and bowels. The baneful  effects of verdigris, from the use of copper boilers and saucepans, may  be counteracted by the same means, if resorted to in time, and no remedy  is so likely to become effectual.      ARTICHOKES. Soak them in cold water, wash them well, and boil them  gently in plenty of water. If young, they will be ready in half an hour;  if otherwise, they will not be done in twice that time. The surest way  to know when they are boiled enough is to draw out a leaf, and see  whether they be tender; but they cannot be properly boiled without much  water, which tends also to preserve their colour. Trim and drain them on  a sieve, serve with melted butter, pepper and salt, and small cups.      ARTICHOKE BOTTOMS, if dried, must be well soaked, and stewed in weak  gravy. Or they may be boiled in milk, and served with cream sauce, or  added to ragouts, French pies, &c. If intended to keep in the winter,  the bottoms must be slowly dried, and put into paper bags.      ASPARAGUS. Having carefully scraped the stalks till they appear white,  and thrown them into cold water, tie them up in small bundles with tape,  and cut the stalks of an equal length. Put them into a stewpan of  boiling water a little salted, and take them up as soon as they begin to  be tender, or they will lose both their taste and colour. Meanwhile make  toasts well browned for the bottom of the dish, moisten them in the  asparagus liquor, place them regularly, and pour on some melted butter.  Then lay the asparagus on the toasts round the dish, with the heads  united at the centre, but pour no butter over them. Serve with melted  butter in a sauce tureen, and separate cups, that the company may season  with salt and pepper to their taste.--As this vegetable is one of the  greatest delicacies which the garden affords, no person should be  unacquainted with the means of producing it in constant succession.  Toward the end of July, the stalks of the asparagus are to be cut down,  and the beds forked up and raked smooth. If the weather be dry, they  should be watered with the drain of a dunghill, and left rather hollow  in the middle to retain the moisture. In about a fortnight the stalks  will begin to appear, and the watering should be continued once a week  if the weather be dry. Asparagus may thus be cut till near the end of  September, and then by making five or six hot-beds during the winter, a  regular succession may be provided for almost every month in the year.  To obviate the objection of cutting the same beds twice a year, two or  three others may be left uncut in the spring, and additional beds made  for the purpose. The seed is cheap, and in most places the dung may be  easily procured. There is no need to continue the old beds when they  begin to fail; it is better to make new ones, and to force the old roots  by applying some rotten dung on the tops of the beds, and to sow seed  every year for new plants.      ASSES' MILK, so beneficial in consumptive cases, should be milked into a  glass that is kept warm, by being placed in a bason of hot water. The  fixed air that it contains sometimes occasions pain in the stomach; at  first therefore a tea-spoonful of rum may be taken with it, but should  only be put in the moment it is to be swallowed. The genuine milk far  surpasses any imitation of it that can be made; but a substitute may be  found in the following composition. Boil a quart of water with a quart  of new milk, an ounce of white sugar-candy, half an ounce of  eringo-root, and half an ounce of conserve of roses, till the quantity  be half wasted. As this is an astringent, the doses must be proportioned  accordingly, and the mixture is wholesome only while it remains  sweet.--Another way. Mix two spoonfuls of boiling water, two of milk,  and an egg well beaten. Sweeten with white sugar-candy pounded: this may  be taken twice or thrice a day. Or, boil two ounces of hartshorn-shavings,  two ounces of pearl barley, two ounces of candied eringo-root, and one  dozen of snails that have been bruised, in two quarts of water till  reduced to one. Mix with an equal quantity of new milk, when taken,  twice a day.      ASTHMA. As this complaint generally attacks aged people, the best mode  of relief will be to attend carefully to diet and exercise, which should  be light and easy, and to avoid as much as possible an exposure to cold  and frosty air. The temperature of the apartment should be equalised to  moderate summer's heat by flues and stoves, and frequently ventilated. A  dish of the best coffee, newly ground and made very strong, and taken  frequently without milk or sugar, has been found highly beneficial. An  excellent diet drink may be made of toast and water, with the addition  of a little vinegar, or a few grains of nitre. Tar water is strongly  recommended, and also the smoking of the dried leaves of stramonium,  commonly called the thorn-apple.      ASTRINGENT BOLUS, proper to be taken in female complaints, arising from  excessive evacuations. Fifteen grains of powdered alum, and five grains  of gum kino, made into a bolus with a little syrup, and given every four  or five hours till the discharge abates.      ASTRINGENT MIXTURE, in case of dysentery, may be made of three ounces of  cinnamon water, mixed with as much common water, an ounce and a half of  spirituous cinnamon-water, and half an ounce of japonic confection. A  spoonful or two of this mixture may be taken every four hours, after the  necessary evacuations have been allowed, and where the dysentery has not  been of long standing, interposing every second or third day a dose of  rhubarb.          B.      BACON, though intended to be a cheap article of housekeeping, is often,  through mismanagement, rendered one of the most expensive. Generally  twice as much is dressed as need be, and of course there is a deal of  waste. When sent to table as an accompaniment to boiled poultry or veal,  a pound and a half is plenty for a dozen people. Bacon will boil better,  and swell more freely, if the rind is taken off before it is dressed;  and when excessively salt, it should be soaked an hour or two in warm  water. If the bacon be dried, pare off the rusty and smoked part, trim  it neatly on the under side, and scrape the rind as clean as possible.  Or take it up when sufficiently boiled, scrape the under side, and cut  off the rind: grate a crust of bread over it, and place it a few minutes  before the fire to brown. Two pounds will require to be boiled gently  about an hour and a half, according to its thickness: the hock or gammon  being very thick, will take more. See DRIED BACON.      BAKING. This mode of preparing a dinner is undoubtedly one of the  cheapest and most convenient, especially for a small family; and the  oven is almost the only kitchen which the poor man possesses. Much  however depends on the care and ability of the baker: in the country  especially, where the baking of dinners is not always considered as a  regular article of business, it is rather a hazardous experiment to send  a valuable joint to the oven; and more is often wasted and spoiled by  the heedless conduct of the parish cook, than would have paid for the  boiling or roasting at home. But supposing the oven to be managed with  care and judgment, there are many joints which may be baked to great  advantage, and will be found but little inferior to roasting.  Particularly, legs and loins of pork, legs of mutton, fillets of veal,  and other joints, if the meat be fat and good, will be eaten with great  satisfaction, when they come from the oven. A sucking pig is also well  adapted to the purpose, and is equal to a roasted one, if properly  managed. When sent to the baker, it should have its ears and tail  covered with buttered paper fastened on, and a bit of butter tied up in  a piece of linen to baste the back with, otherwise it will be apt to  blister. A goose should be prepared the same as for roasting, placing it  on a stand, and taking care to turn it when it is half done. A duck the  same. If a buttock of beef is to be baked, it should be well washed,  after it has been in salt about a week, and put into a brown earthen pan  with a pint of water. Cover the pan tight over with two or three  thicknesses of writing paper, and give it four or five hours in a  moderate oven. Brown paper should never be used with baked dishes; the  pitch and tar which it contains will give the meat a smoky bad taste.  Previously to baking a ham, soak it in water an hour, take it out and  wipe it, and make a crust sufficient to cover it all over; and if done  in a moderate oven, it will cut fuller of gravy, and be of a finer  flavour, than a boiled one. Small cod-fish, haddock, and mackarel will  bake well, with a dust of flour and some bits of butter put on them.  Large eels should be stuffed. Herrings and sprats are to be baked in a  brown pan, with vinegar and a little spice, and tied over with paper.  These and various other articles may be baked so as to give full  satisfaction, if the oven be under judicious management.      BAKED CARP. Clean a large carp, put in a Portuguese stuffing, and sow  it up. Brush it all over with the yolk of an egg, throw on plenty of  crumbs, and drop on oiled butter to baste with. Place the carp in a deep  earthen dish, with a pint of stock, a few sliced onions, some bay  leaves, a bunch of herbs, such as basil, thyme, parsley, and both sorts  of marjoram; half a pint of port wine, and six anchovies. Cover over the  pan, and bake it an hour. Let it be done before it is wanted.

The cup is quite regular but it is fragile, easily broken and  usually deep in the ground. In some plants a slight umbo is developed at  the center.    The mushroom-eater wants to distinguish very carefully between this  species and Amanita spreta, which is very poisonous.    It is found in woods, in open places where there is much vegetable  mould, sometimes found in stubble and pastures, especially in meadows  under trees. Found from June to November.    The plant varies considerably in color, and there are several varieties,  separable by means of their color:    A. vaginata, var. alba. The whole plant is white.    A. vaginata var. fulva. The cap tawny yellow or pale ochraceous.    A. vaginata var. livida. The cap leaden brown; gills and stem tinged  with smoky brown.    [Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._    Plate V. Figure 31.--Amanita vaginata]      _Amanitopsis strangulata. Fr._    THE GRAY AMANITOPSIS. EDIBLE.    Strangulata means choked, from the stuffed stem. The pileus is two to  four inches broad, soon plane, livid-bay or gray, with patches of the  volva, margin striate or grooved.    The gills are free, white, close.    The stem is stuffed, silky above, scaly below, slightly tapering  upwards. The volva soon breaking up, forming several ring-like ridges on  the stem. The spores are globose, 10-13u.    This is a synonym for A. ceciliae. B. and Br. and perhaps nothing more  than a vigorous growth of Amanitopsis vaginata. It has almost no odor  and a sweet taste and cooks deliciously.    Found in the woods and in open places from August to October.      _Lepiota. Fr._    Lepiota means a scale. In the Lepiota the gills are typically free from  the stem, as in Amanita and Amanitopsis, but they differ in having no  superficial or removable warts on the cap, and no sheathing or scaly  remains of a volva at the base of the stem. In some species the  epidermis of the cap breaks into scales which persistently adhere to the  cap, and this feature, indeed, suggests the name of the genus, which is  derived from the Latin word _lepis_, a scale.    The stem is hollow or stuffed, its flesh being distinct from the pileus  and easily separable from it. There are a number of edible species.      _Lepiota procera. Scop._    THE PARASOL MUSHROOM. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._    Plate VI. Figure 32.--Lepiota procera.]    Procera means tall.    The pileus is thin, strongly umbonate, adorned with brown spot-like  scales.    The gills are white, sometimes yellowish-white, free, remote from the  stem, broad and crowded, ventricose, edge sometimes brownish.    The stem is very long, cylindrical, hollow or stuffed, even, very long  in proportion to its thickness and is, therefore, suggestive of the  specific name, procera. The ring is rather thick and firm, though in  mature plants it becomes loosened and movable on the stem. This and the  form of the plant suggest the name, parasol. The cap is from three to  five inches broad and the stem from five to nine inches high. I found  one specimen among fallen timber that was eleven inches tall and whose  cap was six inches broad.    It has a wide distribution. It is found in all parts of Ohio but is not  abundant anywhere. It is a favorite with those who have eaten it, and,  indeed, it is a delicious morsel when quickly broiled over coals,  seasoned to taste with salt and pepper, butter melted in the gills and  served on toast. This mushroom is especially free from grubs and it can  be dried for winter use.    There is no poisonous species with which one is likely to confound it.  The very tall, slender stem with a bulbous base, the very peculiar  spotted cap with the prominent dark colored umbo and the movable ring on  the stem, are ear-marks sufficient to identify this species.    Spores white and elliptical, 14x10u. Lloyd. It is found in pastures,  stubble, and among fallen timber. July to October.    I am indebted to C. G. Lloyd for the photograph given here.      _Lepiota naucina. Fr._    SMOOTH LEPIOTA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 33.--Lepiota naucina. The entire plant white.]    Pileus soft, smooth, white or smoky-white; gills free, white, slowly  changing with age to a dirty pinkish-brown color; stem annulate,  slightly thickened at the base, attenuated upward, clothed with fibres  pure white. The Smooth Lepiota is generally very regular in shape and of  a pure white color. The central part of the cap is sometimes tinged with  yellow or a smoky white hue. Its surface is nearly always very smooth  and even. The gills are somewhat narrower toward the stem than they are  in the middle. They are rounded and not attached to the stem.    Cap two to four inches broad; stem two to three inches long. It grows in  clean grassy places in lawn, pastures, and along roadsides. I have seen  the roadside white with this species around Sidney, Ohio. The specimens  represented in figure were found in Chillicothe, August to November.    This is one of the best mushrooms, not inferior to the meadow mushroom.  It has this advantage over the former that the gills retain their white  color and do not pass from a pink to a repulsive black. The halftone and  the description ought to make the plant known to the most casual reader.      _Lepiota americana. Pk._    THE AMERICAN LEPIOTA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 34.--Lepiota americana. Center of disk red or  reddish-brown, stem frequently swollen. Plant turning red when drying.]    This plant is quite common about Chillicothe, especially upon sawdust  piles. It grows both singly and in clusters. The umbonate cap is adorned  with reddish or reddish-brown scales except on the center where the  color is uniformly reddish or reddish-brown because the surface is not  broken up into scales; gills close, free, white, ventricose; stem  smooth, enlarged at the base. In some plants the base of the stem is  abnormally large; ring white, inclined to be delicate.    Wounds and bruises are apt to assume brownish-red hues. Dr. Herbst says:  \"This is truly an American plant, not being found in any other country.  This is the pride of the family. There is nothing more beautiful than a  cluster of this fungi. To look over the beautiful scaly pileus is a  sight equally as fascinating as a covey of quail.\"    Found in grassy lawns and on old sawdust piles, in common with Pluteus  cervinus. It is found almost all over the state. It is quite equal to  the Parasol mushroom in flavor. It has a tendency to turn the milk or  cream in which it is cooked to a reddish color. It is found from June to  October. Mr. Lloyd suggests the name Lepiota Bodhami. It is the same as  the European plant L. haematosperma. Bull.      _Lepiota Morgani. Pk._    IN HONOR OF PROF. MORGAN.    [Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._    Plate VII. Figure 35.--Lepiota morgani.    Entire plant white or brownish-white. Gills white at first then  greenish.]    Pileus fleshy, soft, at first subglobose, then expanded or even  depressed, white, the brownish or yellowish cuticule breaking up into  scales on the disk; gills close, lanceolate, remote, white, then green;  stem firm, equal or tapering upward, subbulbous, smooth, webby-stuffed,  whitish tinged with brown; ring rather large, movable as you will  observe in Figure 35. Flesh of both pileus and stem white, changing to a  reddish, then to yellowish hue when cut or bruised. Spores ovate or  subelliptical, mostly uninucleate, sordid green. 10-13x7-8. Peck.    This plant is very abundant about Chillicothe and I found it equally so  at Sidney. I have known several families to eat of it, making about half  of the children in each family sick. I regard it as a dangerous plant to  eat. It grows very large and I have seen it growing in well marked rings  a rod in diameter. If you are in doubt whether the plant you have is  Morgani or not, let it remain in the basket over night and you will  plainly see that the gills are turning green. The gills are white until  the spores begin to fall. The plant is found in pastures and sometimes  in pasture woods. June to October.      _Lepiota granulosa. Batsch._    GRAINY LEPIOTA. EDIBLE.    Granulosa--from granosus, full of grains. Pileus thin, convex or nearly  plain, sometimes almost umbonate, rough, with numerous granular scales,  often radiately wrinkled, rusty-yellow or reddish-yellow, often growing  paler with age. Flesh white or reddish tinged. Gills close, rounded  behind and usually slightly adnexed, white. Stem equal or slightly  thickened at the base, stuffed or hollow, white above the ring, colored  and adorned like the pileus below it. Ring slight and evanescent. Spores  elliptical, .00016 to .0002 inch long, .00012 to .00014 inch broad.    Plant one to two and one-fifth inches high; pileus one to two and  one-fifth inches broad; stem one to three lines thick. Common in woods,  copses, and waste places. August to October.    \"This is a small species with a short stem and granular reddish-yellow  pileus, and gills slightly attached to the stem. The annulus is very  small and fugacious, being little more than the abrupt termination to  the coating of the stem. The species was formerly made to include  several varieties which are now regarded as distinct.\"--Peck's Report.    Found in the open woods about Salem, Ohio. The plant is small but quite  meaty and of a pleasing quality.      _Lepiota cristatella. Pk._    Pileus thin, convex, subumbonate, minutely mealy, especially on the  margin, white disk slightly tinged with pink.    Gills close, rounded behind, free, white; stem slender, whitish, hollow;  spores subelliptical, .0002 inch long.    Mossy places in woods. October.--_Peck's Report_. No one will fail to  recognize the crested Lepiota the moment he sees it. It has many of the  ear marks of the Lepiota family.      _Lepiota granosa. Morg._    [Illustration: _Photo by C. G.
