And in this respect, observe, there is an enormous difference between  knowledge and education. An artist need not be a _learned_ man, in all  probability it will be a disadvantage to him to become so; but he ought,  if possible, always to be an _educated_ man: that is, one who has  understanding of his own uses and duties in the world, and therefore of  the general nature of the things done and existing in the world; and who  has so trained himself, or been trained, as to turn to the best and most  courteous account whatever faculties or knowledge he has. The mind of an  educated man is greater than the knowledge it possesses; it is like the  vault of heaven, encompassing the earth which lives and flourishes  beneath it: but the mind of an educated and learned man is like a  caoutchouc band, with an everlasting spirit of contraction in it,  fastening together papers which it cannot open, and keeps others from  opening.    Half our artists are ruined for want of education, and by the possession  of knowledge; the best that I have known have been educated, and  illiterate. The ideal of an artist, however, is not that he should be  illiterate, but well read in the best books, and thoroughly high bred,  both in heart and in bearing. In a word, he should be fit for the best  society, _and should keep out of it_.[11]    Sec. XIV. There are, indeed, some kinds of knowledge with which an artist  ought to be thoroughly furnished; those, for instance, which enable him  to express himself; for this knowledge relieves instead of encumbering  his mind, and permits it to attend to its purposes instead of wearying  itself about means. The whole mystery of manipulation and manufacture  should be familiar to the painter from a child. He should know the  chemistry of all colors and materials whatsoever, and should prepare all  his colors himself, in a little laboratory of his own. Limiting his  chemistry to this one object, the amount of practical science necessary  for it, and such accidental discoveries as might fall in his way in the  course of his work, of better colors or better methods of preparing  them, would be an infinite refreshment to his mind; a minor subject of  interest to which it might turn when jaded with comfortless labor, or  exhausted with feverish invention, and yet which would never interfere  with its higher functions, when it chose to address itself to them. Even  a considerable amount of manual labor, sturdy color-grinding and  canvas-stretching, would be advantageous; though this kind of work ought  to be in great part done by pupils. For it is one of the conditions of  perfect knowledge in these matters, that every great master should have  a certain number of pupils, to whom he is to impart all the knowledge of  materials and means which he himself possesses, as soon as possible; so  that, at any rate, by the time they are fifteen years old, they may know  all that he knows himself in this kind; that is to say, all that the  world of artists know, and his own discoveries besides, and so never be  troubled about methods any more. Not that the knowledge even of his own  particular methods is to be of purpose confined to himself and his  pupils, but that necessarily it must be so in some degree; for only  those who see him at work daily can understand his small and  multitudinous ways of practice. These cannot verbally be explained to  everybody, nor is it needful that they should, only let them be  concealed from nobody who cares to see them; in which case, of course,  his attendant scholars will know them best. But all that can be made  public in matters of this kind should be so with all speed, every artist  throwing his discovery into the common stock, and the whole body of  artists taking such pains in this department of science as that there  shall be no unsettled questions about any known material or method: that  it shall be an entirely ascertained and indisputable matter which is the  best white, and which the best brown; which the strongest canvas, and  safest varnish; and which the shortest and most perfect way of doing  everything known up to that time: and if any one discovers a better, he  is to make it public forthwith. All of them taking care to embarrass  themselves with no theories or reasons for anything, but to work  empirically only: it not being in any wise their business to know  whether light moves in rays or in waves; or whether the blue rays of the  spectrum move slower or faster than the rest; but simply to know how  many minutes and seconds such and such a powder must be calcined, to  give the brightest blue.    Sec. XV. Now it is perhaps the most exquisite absurdity of the whole  Renaissance system, that while it has encumbered the artist with every  species of knowledge that is of no use to him, this one precious and  necessary knowledge it has utterly lost. There is not, I believe, at  this moment, a single question which could be put respecting pigments  and methods, on which the body of living artists would agree in their  answers. The lives of artists are passed in fruitless experiments;  fruitless, because undirected by experience and uncommunicated in their  results. Every man has methods of his own, which he knows to be  insufficient, and yet jealously conceals from his fellow-workmen: every  colorman has materials of his own, to which it is rare that the artist  can trust: and in the very front of the majestic advance of chemical  science, the empirical science of the artist has been annihilated, and  the days which should have led us to higher perfection are passed in  guessing at, or in mourning over, lost processes; while the so-called  Dark ages, possessing no more knowledge of chemistry than a village  herbalist does now, discovered, established, and put into daily practice  such methods of operation as have made their work, at this day, the  despair of all who look upon it.    Sec. XVI. And yet even this, to the painter, the safest of sciences, and  in some degree necessary, has its temptations, and capabilities of abuse.  For the simplest means are always enough for a great man; and when once  he has obtained a few ordinary colors, which he is sure will stand, and  a white surface that will not darken nor moulder, nor rend, he is master  of the world, and of his fellow-men. And, indeed, as if in these times  we were bent on furnishing examples of every species of opposite error,  while we have suffered the traditions to escape us of the simple methods  of doing simple things, which are enough for all the arts, and to all  the ages, we have set ourselves to discover fantastic modes of doing  fantastic things,--new mixtures and manipulations of metal, and  porcelain, and leather, and paper, and every conceivable condition of  false substance and cheap work, to our own infinitely multiplied  confusion,--blinding ourselves daily more and more to the great,  changeless, and inevitable truth, that there is but one goodness in art;  and that is one which the chemist cannot prepare, nor the merchant  cheapen, for it comes only of a rare human hand, and rare human soul.    Sec. XVII. Within its due limits, however, here is one branch of science  which the artist may pursue; and, within limits still more strict,  another also, namely, the science of the appearances of things as they  have been ascertained and registered by his fellow-men. For no day  passes but some visible fact is pointed out to us by others, which,  without their help, we should not have noticed; and the accumulation and  generalization of visible facts have formed, in the succession of ages,  the sciences of light and shade, and perspective, linear and aerial: so  that the artist is now at once put in possession of certain truths  respecting the appearances of things, which, so pointed out to him, any  man may in a few days understand and acknowledge; but which, without  aid, he could not probably discover in his lifetime. I say, probably  could not, because the time which the history of art shows us to have  been actually occupied in the discovery and systematization of such  truth, is no measure of the time _necessary_ for such discovery. The  lengthened period which elapsed between the earliest and the perfect  developement of the science of light (if I may so call it) was not  occupied in the actual effort to ascertain its laws, but in _acquiring  the disposition to make that effort_. It did not take five centuries to  find out the appearance of natural objects; but it took five centuries  to make people care about representing them. An artist of the twelfth  century did not desire to represent nature. His work was symbolical and  ornamental. So long as it was intelligible and lovely, he had no care to  make it like nature. As, for instance, when an old painter represented  the glory round a saint's head by a burnished plate of pure gold, he had  no intention of imitating an effect of light. He meant to tell the  spectator that the figure so decorated was a saint, and to produce  splendor of effect by the golden circle. It was no matter to him what  light was like. So soon as it entered into his intention to represent  the appearance of light, he was not long in discovering the natural  facts necessary for his purpose.    Sec. XVIII. But, this being fully allowed, it is still true that the  accumulation of facts now known respecting visible phenomena, is greater  than any man could hope to gather for himself, and that it is well for  him to be made acquainted with them; provided always, that he receive  them only at their true value, and do not suffer himself to be misled by  them. I say, at their true value; that is, an exceedingly small one. All  the information which men can receive from the accumulated experience of  others, is of no use but to enable them more"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30775"],[0,"Elements of Chemistry, (#10)"],[1,"substances: _First_, Of all bodies that are susceptible of  evaporation, or, more strictly speaking, which are capable of retaining  the state of aeriform elasticity in the temperature of our atmosphere,  and under a pressure equal to that of a column of twenty-eight inches of  quicksilver in the barometer; and, _secondly_, Of all substances,  whether liquid or solid, which are capable of being dissolved by this  mixture of different gasses.    The better to determine our ideas relating to this subject, which has  not hitherto been sufficiently considered, let us, for a moment,  conceive what change would take place in the various substances which  compose our earth, if its temperature were suddenly altered. If, for  instance, we were suddenly transported into the region of the planet  Mercury, where probably the common temperature is much superior to that  of boiling water, the water of the earth, and all the other fluids which  are susceptible of the gasseous state, at a temperature near to that of  boiling water, even quicksilver itself, would become rarified; and all  these substances would be changed into permanent aeriform fluids or  gasses, which would become part of the new atmosphere. These new species  of airs or gasses would mix with those already existing, and certain  reciprocal decompositions and new combinations would take place, until  such time as all the elective attractions or affinities subsisting  amongst all these new and old gasseous substances had operated fully;  after which, the elementary principles composing these gasses, being  saturated, would remain at rest. We must attend to this, however, that,  even in the above hypothetical situation, certain bounds would occur to  the evaporation of these substances, produced by that very evaporation  itself; for as, in proportion to the increase of elastic fluids, the  pressure of the atmosphere would be augmented, as every degree of  pressure tends, in some measure, to prevent evaporation, and as even the  most evaporable fluids can resist the operation of a very high  temperature without evaporating, if prevented by a proportionally  stronger compression, water and all other liquids being able to sustain  a red heat in Papin's digester; we must admit, that the new atmosphere  would at last arrive at such a degree of weight, that the water which  had not hitherto evaporated would cease to boil, and, of consequence,  would remain liquid; so that, even upon this supposition, as in all  others of the same nature, the increasing gravity of the atmosphere  would find certain limits which it could not exceed. We might even  extend these reflections greatly farther, and examine what change might  be produced in such situations upon stones, salts, and the greater part  of the fusible substances which compose the mass of our earth. These  would be softened, fused, and changed into fluids, &c.: But these  speculations carry me from my object, to which I hasten to return.    By a contrary supposition to the one we have been forming, if the earth  were suddenly transported into a very cold region, the water which at  present composes our seas, rivers, and springs, and probably the greater  number of the fluids we are acquainted with, would be converted into  solid mountains and hard rocks, at first diaphanous and homogeneous,  like rock crystal, but which, in time, becoming mixed with foreign and  heterogeneous substances, would become opake stones of various colours.  In this case, the air, or at least some part of the aeriform fluids  which now compose the mass of our atmosphere, would doubtless lose its  elasticity for want of a sufficient temperature to retain them in that  state: They would return to the liquid state of existence, and new  liquids would be formed, of whose properties we cannot, at present, form  the most distant idea.    These two opposite suppositions give a distinct proof of the following  corollaries: _First_, That _solidity_, _liquidity_, and _aeriform  elasticity_, are only three different states of existence of the same  matter, or three particular modifications which almost all substances  are susceptible of assuming successively, and which solely depend upon  the degree of temperature to which they are exposed; or, in other words,  upon the quantity of caloric with which they are penetrated[8]. _2dly_,  That it is extremely probable that air is a fluid naturally existing in  a state of vapour; or, as we may better express it, that our atmosphere  is a compound of all the fluids which are susceptible of the vaporous  or permanently elastic state, in the usual temperature, and under the  common pressure. _3dly_, That it is not impossible we may discover, in  our atmosphere, certain substances naturally very compact, even metals  themselves; as a metallic substance, for instance, only a little more  volatile than mercury, might exist in that situation.    Amongst the fluids with which we are acquainted, some, as water and  alkohol, are susceptible of mixing with each other in all proportions;  whereas others, on the contrary, as quicksilver, water, and oil, can  only form a momentary union; and, after being mixed together, separate  and arrange themselves according to their specific gravities. The same  thing ought to, or at least may, take place in the atmosphere. It is  possible, and even extremely probable, that, both at the first creation,  and every day, gasses are formed, which are difficultly miscible with  atmospheric air, and are continually separating from it. If these gasses  be specifically lighter than the general atmospheric mass, they must, of  course, gather in the higher regions, and form strata that float upon  the common air. The phenomena which accompany igneous meteors induce me  to believe, that there exists in the upper parts of our atmosphere a  stratum of inflammable fluid in contact with those strata of air which  produce the phenomena of the aurora borealis and other fiery meteors.--I  mean hereafter to pursue this subject in a separate treatise.    FOOTNOTES:    [8] The degree of pressure which they undergo must be taken into  account. E.          CHAP. III.    _Analysis of Atmospheric Air, and its Division into two Elastic Fluids;  the one fit for Respiration, the other incapable of being respired._      From what has been premised, it follows, that our atmosphere is composed  of a mixture of every substance capable of retaining the gasseous or  aeriform state in the common temperature, and under the usual pressure  which it experiences. These fluids constitute a mass, in some measure  homogeneous, extending from the surface of the earth to the greatest  height hitherto attained, of which the density continually decreases in  the inverse ratio of the superincumbent weight. But, as I have before  observed, it is possible that this first stratum is surmounted by  several others consisting of very different fluids.    Our business, in this place, is to endeavour to determine, by  experiments, the nature of the elastic fluids which compose the inferior  stratum of air which we inhabit. Modern chemistry has made great  advances in this research; and it will appear by the following details  that the analysis of atmospherical air has been more rigorously  determined than that of any other substance of the class. Chemistry  affords two general methods of determining the constituent principles of  bodies, the method of analysis, and that of synthesis. When, for  instance, by combining water with alkohol, we form the species of liquor  called, in commercial language, brandy or spirit of wine, we certainly  have a right to conclude, that brandy, or spirit of wine, is composed of  alkohol combined with water. We can produce the same result by the  analytical method; and in general it ought to be considered as a  principle in chemical science, never to rest satisfied without both  these species of proofs.    We have this advantage in the analysis of atmospherical air, being able  both to decompound it, and to form it a new in the most satisfactory  manner. I shall, however, at present confine myself to recount such  experiments as are most conclusive upon this head; and I may consider  most of these as my own, having either first invented them, or having  repeated those of others, with the intention of analysing atmospherical  air, in perfectly new points of view.    I took a matrass (A, fig. 14. plate II.) of about 36 cubical inches  capacity, having a long neck B C D E, of six or seven lines internal  diameter, and having bent the neck as in Plate IV. Fig. 2. so as to  allow of its being placed in the furnace M M N N, in such a manner that  the extremity of its neck E might be inserted under a bell-glass F G,  placed in a trough of quicksilver R R S S; I introduced four ounces of  pure mercury into the matrass, and, by means of a syphon, exhausted the  air in the receiver F G, so as to raise the quicksilver to L L, and I  carefully marked the height at which it stood by pasting on a slip of  paper. Having accurately noted the height of the thermometer and  barometer, I lighted a fire in the furnace M M N N, which I kept up  almost continually during twelve days, so as to keep the quicksilver  always almost at its boiling point. Nothing remarkable took place during  the first day: The Mercury, though not boiling, was continually  evaporating, and covered the interior surface of the vessels with small  drops, at first very minute, which gradually augmenting to a sufficient  size, fell back into the mass at the bottom of the vessel. On the second  day, small red particles began to appear on the surface of the mercury,  which, during the four or five following days, gradually increased in  size and number; after which they ceased to increase in either respect.  At the end of twelve days, seeing that the calcination of the mercury  did not at all increase, I extinguished the fire, and allowed the  vessels to"]]]
