I then heard that the night I  had been taken to the hospital, the British had once more been forced  to retire across the Tugela, and early in the morning of the 7th of  February our burghers were again in possession of the kopje  \"Vaalkrantz,\" round which such a fierce fight had waged and for the  possession of which so much blood had been spilled.    So far as I could gather from the English official reports they lost  about 400 men, while our dead and wounded numbered only sixty-two.    Taking into consideration the determination with which General Buller  had attacked us, and how dearly he had paid for this third abortive  attempt, the retreat of his troops remains as much of a mystery to me  as that at Spion Kop.    Our \"Long Tom\" was a decided success, and had proved itself to be  exceedingly useful.    The Battle of \"Vaalkrantz\" kopje was to me and to the Johannesburg  commando undoubtedly the most important and the fiercest fight in this  war, and although one point in our positions was taken, I think that  on the whole I may be proud of our defence. About two-thirds of its  defenders were killed or wounded before the enemy took that spot, and  all who afterwards visited the kopje where our struggle had taken  place had to admit that unmistakable evidence showed it to be one of  the hottest fights of the Natal campaign. All the trees were torn up  or smashed by shells, great blocks of rock had been splintered and  were stained yellow by the lyddite; mutilated bodies were lying  everywhere--Briton and Boer side by side; for during the short time  \"Vaalkrantz\" had been in their possession the English had not had an  opportunity of burying the bodies of friends or foe.    I think I may quote a few paragraphs of what Dr. Doyle says in his  book about this engagement:--         \"The artillery-fire (the \"Zwartkop\" guns and other       batteries) was then hurriedly aimed at the isolated       \"Vaalkrantz\" (the real object of the attack), and had a       terrific effect. It is doubtful whether ever before a       position has been exposed to such an awful bombardment. The       weight of the ammunition fired by some of the cannon was       greater than that of an entire German battery during the       Franco-Prussian war.\"    Prince Kraft describes the 4 and 6-pounders as mere toys compared with  machine Howitzer and 4.7 guns.    Dr. Doyle, however, is not sure about the effect of these powerful  guns, for he says:--         \"Although the rims of the kopje were being pounded by       lyddite and other bombs it is doubtful whether this terrific       fire did much damage among the enemy, as seven English       officers and 70 men were lying dead on the kopje against       only a few Boers, who were found to have been wounded.\"    Of the pom-pom, which I succeeded in saving from the enemy's hands,  the same writer says:--         \"It was during this attack that something happened of a more       picturesque and romantic nature than is usually the case in       modern warfare; here it was not a question of combatants and       guns being invisible or the destruction of a great mass of       people. In this case it concerns a Boer gun, cut off by the       British troops, which all of a sudden came out of its       hiding-place and scampered away like a frightened hare from       his lair. It fled from the danger as fast as the mules' legs       would take it, nearly overturning, and jolting and knocking       against the rocks, while the driver bent forward as far as       he could to protect himself from the shower of bullets which       were whistling round his ears in all directions. British       shells to the right of him, shells to the left of him       bursting and spluttering, lyddite shrapnel fuming and       fizzing and making the splinters fly. But over the \"randtje\"       the gun disappeared, and in a few minutes after it was in       position again, and dealing death and destruction amongst       the British assailants.\"    While I was under treatment in Dr. Shaw's ambulance I was honoured by  a visit from General Joubert, who came to compliment me on what he  called the splendid defence of Vaalkrantz, and to express his regret  at the heavy loss sustained by our commando. I heard from Dr. Shaw  that after the battle the groans and cries of the wounded burghers  could be heard in the immediate neighbourhood of the English outposts.  Some burghers volunteered to go, under cover of the darkness, to see  if they could save these wounded men. They cautiously crept up to the  foot of the kopjes, from where they could plainly see the English  sentinels, and a little further down found in a ditch two of our  wounded, named Brand and Liebenberg; the first had an arm and a leg  smashed, the latter had a bullet in his thigh.    One can imagine what a terrible plight they were in after laying there  for two nights and a day, exposed to the night's severe cold and the  day's scorching sun. Their wounds were already decomposing, and the  odour was most objectionable.    The two unfortunate men were at once carried to the laager and  attended to with greatest care. Poor Liebenberg died of his wounds  soon after. Brand, the youngest son of the late President Brand, of  the Orange Free State, soon recovered, if I remember rightly.    At the risk of incurring the displeasure of a great number of people  by adding the following statement to my description of the battle of  Vaalkrantz, I feel bound to state that Commandant-General Joubert,  after our successes at Colenso, Spion Kop, and Vaalkrantz, asked the  two State Presidents, Kruger and Steyn, to consider the urgency of  making peace overtures to the English Government. He pointed out that  the Republics had no doubt reached the summit of their glory in the  War. The proposal read as follows: That the Republican troops should  at once evacuate British territory, compensation to be given for the  damage to property, etc., inflicted by our commandos, against which  the British Government was to guarantee that the Republics should be  spared from any further incursions or attacks from British troops, and  to waive its claim of Suzerainty; and that the British Government  should undertake not to interfere with the internal affairs and legal  procedure of the two Republics, and grant general amnesty to the  colonial rebels.    Commander-in-Chief Joubert defended these proposals by pointing out  that England was at that moment in difficulties, and had suffered  repeated serious defeats. The opportunity should be taken, urged the  General.    He was supported by several officers, but other Boer leaders contended  that Natal, originally Boer territory, should never again be ceded to  the enemy. As we heard nothing more of these proposals, I suppose the  two State Presidents rejected them.          CHAPTER XI.    THE TURN OF THE TIDE.      After the English forces had retreated from Vaalkrantz across the  Tugela, a patrol of my commando under my faithful adjutant, J. Du  Preez, who had taken my place for the time being, succeeded in  surprising a troop of fifty Lancers, of the 17th regiment, I believe,  near Zwartkop, east of the Tugela, and making them prisoners after a  short skirmish. Among these men, who were afterwards sent to Pretoria,  was a certain Lieutenant Thurlington. It was a strange sight to see  our patrol coming back with their victims, each Boer brandishing a  captured lance.    Being still in the hospital in feeble health without any prospect of a  speedy recovery, I took the doctor's advice and went home to  Rondepoort, near Krugersdorp, where my family was staying at the  time, and there, thanks to the careful treatment of my kind doctor and  the tender care of my wife I soon recovered my strength.    On the 25th of February I received a communication from my commando to  the effect that General Buller had once more concentrated his forces  on Colenso and that heavy fighting was going on. The same evening I  also had a telegram from President Kruger, urging me to rejoin my  commando so soon as health would allow, for affairs seemed to have  taken a critical turn. The enemy appeared to mean business this time,  and our commando had already been compelled to evacuate some very  important positions, one of which was Pieter's Heights.    Then the news came from Cape Colony that General Piet Cronje had been  surrounded at Paardeberg, and that as he stubbornly refused to abandon  his convoy and retreat, he would soon be compelled by a superior force  to surrender.    The next morning I was in a fast train to Natal, accompanied by my  faithful adjutant, Rokzak. My other adjutant, Du Preez, had meantime  been ordered to take a reinforcement of 150 men to Pieter's Heights,  and was soon engaged in a desperate struggle in the locality situated  between the Krugersdorpers' and the Middleburgers' positions. The  situation was generally considered very serious when I arrived near  the head laager at Modderspruit late in the evening of the 27th of  February, unaware of the unfavourable turn things had taken during the  day at Paardeberg, in the Cape Colony, and on the Tugela. We rode on  that night to my laager at Potgietersdrift, but having to go by a  roundabout way it took us till early next morning before we reached  our destination. The first thing I saw on my arrival was a cart  containing ten wounded men, who had just been brought in from the  fighting line, all yellow with lyddite.    Field-cornet P. van der Byl, who came fresh from the fight near  Pieter's Heights, told me that these burghers had been wounded there.  I asked them what had happened and how matters stood. \"Ah,  Commandant,\" he replied, \"things are in a very bad way! Commandant Du  Preez and myself were called to Pieter's Heights three days ago, as  the enemy wanted to force their way through. We were in a very awkward  position, the enemy storming us again and again;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25063"],[0,"The Beggar's Opera; to Which is Prefixed the Musick to Each Song (#10)"],[1,"Difficulties, as oblige him to live with such ill Company, and herd  with Gamesters.    _Matt._ See the Partiality of Mankind! --One Man may steal a Horse,  better than another look over a Hedge. --Of all Mechanics, of all  servile Handicrafts-men, a Gamester is the vilest.

'Tis not Youth  or Beauty that fixes their Price. The Gentlemen always pay according to  their Dress, from half a Crown to two Guineas; and yet those Hussies  make nothing of bilking of me. --Then too, allowing for Accidents.  --I have eleven fine Customers now down under the Surgeon's Hands-- what  with Fees and other Expenses, there are great Goings-out, and no Comings  in, and not a Farthing to pay for at least a Month's Clothing. --We run  great Risques-- great Risques indeed.    _Peachum._ As I remember, you said something just now of Mrs. _Coaxer_.    _Mrs. Trapes._ Yes, Sir. --To be sure I stript her of a Suit of my own  Clothes about two Hours ago; and have left her as she should be, in her  Shift, with a Lover of hers at my House. She call'd him up Stairs, as he  was going to _Mary-bone_ in a Hackney Coach. --And I hope, for her own  sake and mine, she will persuade the Captain to redeem her, for the  Captain is very generous to the Ladies.    _Lockit._ What Captain?    _Mrs. Trapes._ He thought I did not know him-- An intimate Acquaintance  of yours, Mr. _Peachum_-- Only Captain _Macheath_-- as fine as a Lord.    _Peachum._ To-morrow, dear Mrs. _Dye_, you shall set your own Price upon  any of the Goods you like-- We have at least half a Dozen Velvet Scarfs,  and all at your Service. Will you give me leave to make you a Present of  this Suit of Night-clothes for your own wearing? --But are you sure it  is Captain _Macheath_.    _Mrs. Trapes._ Though he thinks I have forgot him; no body knows him  better. I have taken a great deal of the Captain's Money in my Time at  second-hand, for he always lov'd to have his Ladies well drest.    _Peachum._ Mr. _Lockit_ and I have a little Business with the Captain;--  You understand me-- and we will satisfy you for Mrs. _Coaxer's_ Debt.    _Lockit._ Depend upon it-- we will deal like Men of Honour.    _Mrs. Trapes._ I don't enquire after your Affairs-- so whatever happens,  I wash my Hands on't-- It hath always been my Maxim, that one Friend  should assist another-- But if you please-- I'll take one of the Scarfs  home with me.
