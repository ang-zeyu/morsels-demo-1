These cut pieces have the advantage over any oily fuel, such as  colza oil, that they can be wrapped in paper or carried in a cardboard  box; further they will keep indefinitely, even in the presence of air,  without undergoing any perceptible change.    _Forms of Lamp for Paraffin Wax._--Probably, the best form is that  devised by Thomas Bolas, and described by him in the _Journal of the  Society of Arts_, December 2nd, 1898. This lamp consists of a small open  tray of iron, through which pass three or more flat tubes, and between  these tubes are placed small flat pieces of wick, the fit being such  that the pieces of wick may be adjusted easily by means of a pair of  pointed tweezers.    The flame thus obtained, instead of having one large hollow, is broken  or divided so that the combustion is concentrated into a smaller area,  and the air blast, which is directed across the flame, carries the flame  with it in a more complete manner than is the case with the ordinary  flame; a more thorough combustion being realised by this arrangement.    Another advantage is the ease with which the wick may be changed and a  larger or smaller wick inserted to suit the flame to any size of air  jet.    This form of lamp may be used for oily fuel, although it is specially  suitable for paraffin wax.    Two small pieces of bent tin-plate may be used as side covers, and these  serve to adjust the flame within certain limits. A tin-plate cover which  fits easily over the whole lamp serves as an extinguisher. The complete  lamp is shown by _d_, Fig. 16, and this figure shows also a quick-change  air-jet device, the whole arrangement forming a blowpipe for use where a  non-gaseous fuel is to be employed.    Although the lamp just described is desirable when complete control over  the size of the flame is necessary, and if the ideal conditions and  maximum heat are to be obtained, yet a simpler form of lamp will be  found to give very good results. Such a lamp may consist of a flat tin  tray, having a diameter of about three and a half inches and a depth of  about one inch. In this tray is a tin support for the wick, and the wick  itself may consist of a bundle of soft cotton, for example, a loosely  rolled piece of cotton cloth, but in either case the top of the wick  should be cut to approximately the same angle as that at which the  blowpipe jet meets the flame.    In using paraffin wax as a fuel, it is necessary to see that sufficient  wax reaches the wick to prevent charring during the first few minutes  before the bulk of the wax is melted.    _Animal and Vegetable Oils._--Almost any oil may be used as a fuel, but  many tend to become hard and gummy if allowed to stand in the air for  any considerable time. When this happens, the wick becomes clogged and  it is impossible to obtain a good flame. A number of the oils tend,  also, to produce rather strongly smelling smoke.    _A Flame-Guard for Use With Non-Gaseous Fuels._--In order to avoid the  eye-strain produced by the luminous base of the flame from a wick  burning paraffin wax or oil, it is often advantageous to make a small  tunnel of tin-plate, which can be rested on the sides of the lamp and  rises over the top of the wick. Such a flame guard is shown by _e_, Fig.  16.    _Small Rods and Tubes from Glass Scrap_:--It is scarcely practicable to  make small quantities of good glass with the blowpipe flame as the only  source of heat, but it is less difficult to make small rods or tubes  from glass scrap, and the ability to do this is sometimes of  considerable value when a small tube has to be joined on to some special  piece of apparatus made of glass of unknown composition. It may be  possible to obtain some fragments of similar glass, either from a broken  part of the apparatus or from a similar piece, and from these fragments  small tubes or rods can be made.    The fragments of glass may be melted together on the end of a clay  pipe-stem, care being taken to avoid trapping air bubbles as fresh  fragments are added to the molten mass. When a sufficient quantity of  glass has been accumulated, the viscous mass may be drawn out into a rod  by bringing another pipe-stem into contact with the hot mass, rotating  both pipe-stems steadily, and separating them until a rod of the desired  size has been obtained.    If, on the other hand, it is desired to produce a tube from the mass of  heated glass, the mass should be blown hollow before the pipe-stems  supporting it are separated.    _Methods of Manufacture._--When the student has familiarised himself  with the more common operations and processes used in glass-blowing, he  will be in a position to increase his skill and knowledge of special  methods by a critical examination of various examples of commercial  work. There are few exercises more valuable than such an examination,  combined with an attempt to reconstruct the stages and the methods by  which the article chosen for examination was made.    Obviously, it is impossible to give full details of all constructions in  a small text-book; but it is easy to give an example of the  constructional methods employed in the making of almost any piece of  light blown-glass apparatus, and these methods should prove of special  value when apparatus of a new pattern has to be evolved for the purposes  of research. That is to say, one designs the apparatus required, applies  known methods of construction as far as possible, and, by the  examination of commercial apparatus having similar features, evolves the  new methods required. For an exercise in such a process of  reconstruction we may well take an ordinary commercial vacuum tube, such  as that shown by _a_, Fig. 17.    [Illustration: Fig. 17]    In the tube from which this drawing was made, it was found that the  spiral in the middle bulb was of a slightly yellowish colour and gave a  green fluorescence when the electric discharge was passed through the  tube; that is to say, the spiral is made of uranium-glass, which is  usually a soda-glass containing trace of uranium, and hence differing  slightly in composition from the ordinary glasses. The two enclosed  tubes which are bent into a series of S bends gave a pink fluorescence,  which indicates lead-glass; and the remainder of the tube fluoresced  with an apple-green colour; this suggests ordinary soda-glass. We have,  therefore, a piece of apparatus in which three dissimilar glasses are  joined, while, at the same time, that apparatus contains a number of  internal seals, and it is not probable that the dissimilar glasses will  have their coefficients of expansion so nearly alike as to permit of a  stable internal seal being made if one part of the seal consists of a  glass differing from that of the other part.    These considerations lead us to a closer examination of the joins where  the dissimilar glasses are introduced, and we find that in no case is  the internal seal made between dissimilar glasses, but that a soda-glass  extension is joined on to both the uranium-glass tube and the lead-glass  tubes at a point about half an inch before the internal seal commences.  Careful examination of these joins shows that the change from one glass  to another is not abrupt but gradual. Such a transitional joint may be  made by taking a length of soda-glass tubing, sealing the end and fusing  a minute bead of the other glass on to the sealed end, the end is then  expanded and another bead of the other glass added, this bead is  expanded and the operation is repeated, thus building up a tube, and,  finally, the tube of the other glass is joined on to the end of this.    We are now concerned with the question of the insertion of the  uranium-glass spiral into the bulb (see p. 38). Obviously the spiral is  too large to pass through the necks of the bulb, and it is difficult to  imagine that the spiral was obtained by the insertion of a length of  straight tubing which was bent after entering the bulb; therefore, the  only remaining method is that the spiral was made first and the  soda-glass extensions fastened on, and that the bulb was blown, cut in  halves and the spiral inserted, and the two halves were then rejoined.  That this was actually the case is confirmed by traces of a join which  are just visible round the middle of the bulb. The insertion of the  spiral and the making of the first internal seal are shown by _b_, and  _c_.    There is one detail in making the second join of the spiral to the bulb  which calls for attention, and the small branch, similar to an  exhaustion branch, at the side of the bulb provides a clue to this. If  an attempt were made to complete the second internal seal through a  closed bulb it would be impossible to obtain a good result, as the  air-pressure in the bulb would not be under control when once union was  effected, and further heating of the air in the bulb would cause  expansion and perforate the wall near the second internal seal; we  therefore make a small branch which can be left open and through which  such air-pressure as may be found necessary can be maintained.    The third join, by which the lead-glass tube is joined to the soda-glass  is made in stages similar to those in which the soda-glass and  uranium-glass were joined; but the internal seal is most conveniently  made by sliding a length of tubing over the lead-glass and fusing this  tubing to the large diameter soda-glass tube to which the lead-glass is  already joined. The first stage of this operation is illustrated by _d_.  When this seal is completed, the end of the soda-glass tube is drawn off  and sealed as shown in _e_, and at this stage a side tube or branch is  joined on. The sealed end of the outer and large diameter soda-glass  tube is heated until it contracts and fuses to the enlargement that has  previously been joined to the lead-glass tube, and the end is burst out  as shown in _f_.

Color brownish pale tan, or whitish. The stem in the larger  species is stout, and sometimes deeply furrowed in longitudinal grooves,  usually white or whitish.    The species Helvella crispa is white or pallid throughout, cap very  irregular, sometimes deeply concave in the centre, with margin at first  erect, then drooping; again it is undulating, much divided and deflexed;  in fact, so irregular is the shape that scarcely two specimens will show  the cap the same in outline; stem stout and deeply channelled. Spores  elliptical, transparent. Habitat woods, growing singly or in groups, but  not caespitose.    Fig. 6, the ascus or spore sack and paraphyses.    _Genus Mitrula_ Fries. Soft and fleshy, simple capitate, stem distinct,  hymenium surrounding the inflated cap; head ovate, obtuse, inflated.--M.  C. Cooke.    Cooke says of this genus that it is scarcely so well characterized as  many with which it is associated, and that some of the species are  evidently so closely allied to some of the species of the genus  Geoglossum that it is difficult to draw the line of demarcation between  them, particularly so with the species Mitrula _pistillaris_ B. from  Louisiana.    The plants are very small, and though none are recorded as poisonous,  only one or two have any value as esculents.         FIG. 7. =Mitrula sclerotipes= Boudier.    The cap in this species is small, and the stem long and slender. The  spores are transparent, the asci club-shaped. The plants of this species  are always found springing from an oblong sclerotium; hence the name  sclerotipes.    Fig. 8 represents the sporidia enclosed in their asci with paraphyses  and individual spores, the latter magnified 800 diameters. Fig. 9,  sectional view of mature plant.         FIG. 10. =Mitrula vitellina= Sacc., var. _irregularis_ Peck.    Saccardo, in his Sylloge Fungorum, includes in this genus those having a  club-shaped cap, which brings into it, with others, the species Mitrula  _vitellina_ Sacc., formerly classed in the genus Geoglossum, and its  variety _irregularis_ Peck. The latter was first described in 1879, in  Peck's Thirty-Second Report, under the name Geoglossum _irregulare_.  Prof. Peck now gives preference to the name assigned to it by Saccardo,  and it is so recorded in Peck's later reports.    Prof. Peck records this species as edible, and recommends it as having  tender flesh and an agreeable flavor. It sometimes grows in profusion in  wet mossy places, in woods, or swampy ground. It is bright yellow in  color, clean and attractive. The cap is much longer than the stem, often  deeply lobed, extremely irregular in outline, and tapers to a short  yellowish or whitish stem. The spores are narrowly elliptical and  transparent. The specimen illustrated is from a small one figured by  Peck. The plants sometimes reach two inches in height. They are most  abundant in temperate climates.         [Illustration: Plate D.       FOUR TYPES OF THE GENUS MORCHELLA.       T. TAYLOR, DEL.       THE NORRIS PETERS CO., PHOTO-LITHO., WASHINGTON, D. C.]         PLATE D.    In Plate D are represented four species of the genus Morchella, viz., M.  _semilibera_, M. _bispora_, M. _conica_, and M. _deliciosa_. Morchella  _esculenta_ is figured in Plate C.         FIG. 1. =Morchella semilibera= De Candolle. \"_Half Free Morel_.\"         EDIBLE.    Cap conical but half free from the stem as the name of the species  indicates. The ribs are longitudinal, forming oblong pits; stem hollow,  much longer than the cap, white; spores elliptical. Peck says that this  species has been described by Persoon under the name Morchella  _hybrida_, and this name is adopted in Saccardo's Sylloge Fungorum, but  most English writers prefer the first.    Fig. 2. Sectional view of Morchella _semilibera_.    Fig. 8. Sporidia of same inclosed in ascus with accompanying  paraphyses.         FIG. 3. Sectional view of =Morchella bispora= Sorokin. \"_Two-Spored       Morel_.\"         EDIBLE.    Cap free from the stem to the top, somewhat resembling that of M.  _semilibera_, but blunt at its summit instead of conical, the outward  surface deeply pitted, inner surface smooth and barren. A characteristic  of this species which distinguishes it from others of the same genus is  found in the number of its sporidia, spores as seen in the ascus or  spore sack. In the plants of the genus Morchella the spore sacks, with  one or two exceptions, contain eight spores.    In the species M. _bispora_ the spore sacks contain but two spores and  these are much larger than the sporidia of those which contain eight.  This characteristic, however, can only be determined by the aid of the  microscope.    Cooke figures a specimen taken from those published by Sorokin in  Thumen's Exsiccata, and calls it a variety of Morchella _Bohemica_  Kromb. He says that it is not unusual to find M. _Bohemica_ with two or  four sporidia in some of the asci, mixed with others containing more,  some specimens being entirely tetrasporous, and some, as the variety  _bispora_, usually containing but two sporidia. Cooke contends that M.  bispora is simply a bisporous form of Morchella _Bohemica_, and calls it  M. _Bohemica_ var. _bispora_. It is not as common as other species.    Fig. 9 represents asci of M. bispora showing the two spores in each  ascus.         FIG. 4. =Morchella conica.= \"_Conical Morel_.\"         EDIBLE.    Cap conical or oblong-conical, margin adhering to the stem, the  prominent ridges longitudinal and irregularly bisected with shorter  ones; the whole plant hollow throughout; color pale tan or ochraceous  yellow, growing dingy and darker with age; stem white; spores  elliptical.    This species is quite plentiful in some localities; the flavor is like  that of M. _esculenta_.    Fig. 5. Sectional view of M. _conica_.    Fig. 10. Ascus, sporidia and paraphyses.         FIG. 6. =Morchella deliciosa= Fries. \"_Delicious Morel_.\"    Cap nearly cylindrical, blunt at the top, and usually much longer than  the stem, adnate. Plant hollow throughout. Stem white. Spores  elliptical.    Fig. 7. Sectional view of M. _deliciosa_.    Fig. 11. Ascus, sporidia, and paraphyses.    The Morchella _deliciosa_ is highly esteemed as an esculent wherever  eaten. Split open and stuffed with bread crumbs seasoned with pepper,  salt, and butter and a pinch of thyme or onion, steamed in a hot oven,  and served with butter sauce, this mushroom makes a very savory dish.    _Note._--Small specimens have been selected for illustration in this  plate in order to utilize as much as possible the plate space.

LEUCOSPORI (SPORES WHITE OR YELLOWISH).    _Genus Lactarius_ Fries. The plants of this genus have neither veil nor  volva. They somewhat resemble the _Russulae_, but can be readily  distinguished from them by the greater fleshiness of the stem and by the  milky juice which exudes from the flesh. The latter is a characteristic  feature of the _Lactars_, giving to the group its name.    The species were originally arranged by Fries into groups according to  the color and quality of the milk, and of the naked or pruinose  character of the gills. Prof. Peck, however, considering the latter  character not sufficiently constant or obvious to be satisfactory, in  his early reports makes the color of the milk alone the basis of the  primary grouping of the American species.    Saccardo, in his Sylloge, follows Fries in his classification of the  species of the genus Lactarius.    In some species the milk is at first bright colored and continues  unchanged; in others it is always white or whitish, and in others again  it is at first white, changing to different hues on exposure to the air,  becoming pinkish, pale violet, or yellow. In one species (C. indigo)  both plant and milk are of indigo blue. The taste of the milk varies, as  does that of the flesh, according to species. Sometimes it is mild or  very slightly acrid, and again it resembles Cayenne pepper in its hot,  biting acridity. It is somewhat viscid or sticky in character, and  permeates to some extent the whole flesh of the mushroom, but is most  profuse in the gills, where in fresh young specimens it is seen exuding  on the slightest pressure. In old or wilted specimens it does not flow  so freely, but may be found by breaking off portions of the cap.    The plants usually present a fleshy cap, the flesh quite brittle, and  breaking in clean, even fractures. In a number of the species the upper  surface of the cap shows bands or zones of warm coloring, not found in  any of the species of the allied genus Russula. The gills are sometimes  even, more often forked, acute on the edge, color white or whitish,"]]]
