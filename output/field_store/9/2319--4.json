We judge that the chickadee, from the  peculiarity of his feeding habits, is more certain than most birds are  of finding a meal whenever he is hungry; and that, we are assured from  experience, goes a long way toward making a body contented. We think it  likely that the brown thrush is at some special disadvantage in this  respect, or has some peculiar enemies warring upon him; in which case it  is no more than we might expect that he should be a pessimist. And, with  all our ignorance, we are yet sure that everything has a cause, and we  would fain hold by the brave word of Emerson, \"Undoubtedly we have no  questions to ask which are unanswerable.\"    FOOTNOTES:    [7] This does not harmonize exactly with a statement which Emerson makes  somewhere, to the effect that all the stoics were stoics indeed. But  Epictetus had never lived in Concord.                                   IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS        Our music's in the hills.                         EMERSON.                               IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS.      It was early in June when I set out for my third visit to the White  Mountains, and the ticket-seller and the baggage-master in turn assured  me that the Crawford House, which I named as my destination, was not yet  open. They spoke, too, in the tone which men use when they mention  something which, but for uncommon stupidity, you would have known  beforehand. The kindly sarcasm missed its mark, however. I was aware  that the hotel was not yet ready for the \"general public.\" But I said to  myself that, for once at least, I was not to be included in that  unfashionably promiscuous company. The vulgar crowd must wait, of  course. For the present the mountains, in reporters' language, were \"on  private view;\" and despite the ignorance of railway officials, I was one  of the elect. In plainer phrase, I had in my pocket a letter from the  manager of the famous inn before mentioned, in which he promised to do  what he could for my entertainment, even though he was not yet, as he  said, keeping a hotel.    Possibly I made too much of a small matter; but it pleased me to feel  that this visit of mine was to be of a peculiarly intimate  character,--almost, indeed, as if Mount Washington himself had bidden me  to private audience.    Compelled to wait three or four hours in North Conway, I improved the  opportunity to stroll once more down into the lovely Saco meadows, whose  \"green felicity\" was just now at its height. Here, perched upon a  fence-rail, in the shadow of an elm, I gazed at the snow-crowned Mount  Washington range, while the bobolinks and savanna sparrows made music on  every side. The song of the bobolinks dropped from above, and the  microphonic tune of the sparrows came up from the grass,--sky and earth  keeping holiday together. Almost I could have believed myself in Eden.  But, alas, even the birds themselves were long since shut out of that  garden of innocence, and as I started back toward the village a crow  went hurrying past me, with a kingbird in hot pursuit. The latter was  more fortunate than usual, or more plucky; actually alighting on the  crow's back and riding for some distance. I could not distinguish his  motions,--he was too far away for that,--but I wished him joy of his  victory, and grace to improve it to the full. For it is scandalous that  a bird of the crow's cloth should be a thief; and so, although I reckon  him among my friends,--in truth, _because_ I do so,--I am always able to  take it patiently when I see him chastised for his fault. Imperfect as  we all know each other to be, it is a comfort to feel that few of us are  so altogether bad as not to take more or less pleasure in seeing a  neighbor's character improved under a course of moderately painful  discipline.    At Bartlett word came that the passenger car would go no further, but  that a freight train would soon start, on which, if I chose, I could  continue my journey. Accordingly, I rode up through the Notch on a  platform car,--a mode of conveyance which I can heartily and in all good  conscience recommend. There is no crowd of exclaiming tourists, the  train of necessity moves slowly, and the open platform offers no  obstruction to the view. For a time I had a seat, which after a little  two strangers ventured to occupy with me; for \"it's an ill wind that  blows nobody good,\" and there happened to be on the car one piece of  baggage,--a coffin, inclosed in a pine box. Our sitting upon it could  not harm either it or us; nor did we wean any disrespect to the man,  whoever he might be, whose body was to be buried in it. Judging the  dead charitably, as in duty bound, I had no doubt he would have been  glad if he could have seen his \"narrow house\" put to such a use. So we  made ourselves comfortable with it, until, at an invisible station, it  was taken off. Then we were obliged to stand, or to retreat into a  miserable small box-car behind us. The platform would lurch a little now  and then, and I, for one, was not experienced as a \"train hand;\" but we  all kept our places till the Frankenstein trestle was reached. Here,  where for five hundred feet we could look down upon the jagged rocks  eighty feet below us, one of the trio suddenly had an errand into the  box-car aforesaid, leaving the platform to the other stranger and me.  All in all, the ride through the Notch had never before been so  enjoyable, I thought; and late in the evening I found myself once again  at the Crawford House, and in one of the best rooms,--as well enough I  might be, being the only guest in the house.    The next morning, before it was really light, I was lying awake looking  at Mount Webster, while through the open window came the loud, cheery  song of the white-throated sparrows. The hospitable creatures seemed to  be inviting me to come at once into their woods; but I knew only too  well that, if the invitation were accepted, they would every one of  them take to hiding like bashful children.    The white-throat is one of the birds for whom I cherish a special  liking. On my first trip to the mountains I jumped off the train for a  moment at Bartlett, and had hardly touched the ground before I heard his  familiar call. Here, then, was Mr. Peabody at home. Season after season  he had camped near me in Massachusetts, and many a time I had been  gladdened by his lively serenade; now he greeted me from his own native  woods. So far as my observations have gone, he is common throughout the  mountain region; and that in spite of the standard guide-book, which  puts him down as patronizing the Glen House almost exclusively. He knows  the routes too well to need any guide, however, and may be excused for  his ignorance of the official programme. It is wonderful how shy he  is,--the more wonderful, because, during his migrations, his manner is  so very different. Then, even in a city park you may watch him at your  leisure, while his loud, clear whistle is often to be heard rising above  a din of horse-cars and heavy wagons. But here, in his summer quarters,  you will listen to his song a hundred times before you once catch a  glimpse of the singer. At first thought it seems strange that a bird  should be most at home when he is away from home; but in the one case  he has nothing but his own safety to consult, while in the other he is  thinking of those whose lives are more to him than his own, and whose  hiding-place he is every moment on the alert to conceal.    In Massachusetts we do not expect to find sparrows in deep woods. They  belong in fields and pastures, in roadside thickets, or by fence-rows  and old stone-walls bordered with barberry bushes and alders. But these  white-throats are children of the wilderness. It is one charm of their  music that it always comes, or seems to come, from such a  distance,--from far up the mountain-side, or from the inaccessible  depths of some ravine. I shall not soon forget its wild beauty as it  rose out of the spruce forests below me, while I was enjoying an evening  promenade, all by myself, over the long, flat summit of Moosilauke. From  his habit of singing late at night this sparrow is in some places known  as the nightingale. His more common name is the Peabody bird; while a  Jefferson man, who was driving me over the Cherry Mountain road, called  him the Peverly bird, and told me the following story:--    A farmer named Peverly was walking about his fields one spring morning,  trying to make up his mind whether the time had come to put in his  wheat. The question was important, and he was still in a deep quandary,  when a bird spoke up out of the wood and said, \"Sow wheat, Peverly,  Peverly, Peverly!--Sow wheat, Peverly, Peverly, Peverly!\" That settled  the matter. The wheat was sown, and in the fall a most abundant harvest  was gathered; and ever since then this little feathered oracle has been  known as the Peverly bird.    We have improved on the custom of the ancients: they examined a bird's  entrails; we listen to his song. Who says the Yankee is not wiser than  the Greek?    But I was lying abed in the Crawford House when the voice of  _Zonotrichia albicollis_ sent my thoughts thus astray, from Moosilauke  to Delphi. That day and the two following were passed in roaming about  the woods near the hotel. The pretty painted trillium was in blossom, as  was also the dark purple species, and the hobble-bush showed its broad  white cymes in all directions. Here and there was the modest little  spring beauty (_Claytonia Caroliniana_), and not far from the Elephant's  Head I discovered my first and only patch of dicentra, with its delicate  dissected leaves and its oddly shaped petals of white and pale yellow.  The false mitrewort (_Tiarella cordifolia_) was in flower likewise, and  the spur which is cut off Mount Willard by the railroad was all aglow  with rhodora,--a perfect flower-garden,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28020"],[0,"History of Woman Suffrage, Volume I (#10)"],[1,"ica, plead her own case in the  courts of New York, continuing her contest for many years. The  temperance reform and the deep interest taken in it by women; the  effective appeals they made, setting forth their wrongs as mother,  wife, sister, and daughter of the drunkard, with a power beyond that  of man, early gave them a local place on this platform as a favor,  though denied as a right. Delegates from woman's societies to State  and National conventions invariably found themselves rejected. It was  her early labors in the temperance cause that first roused Susan B.  Anthony to a realizing sense of woman's social, civil, and political  degradation, and thus secured her life-long labors for the  enfranchisement of woman. In 1847 she made her first speech at a  public meeting of the Daughters of Temperance in Canajoharie, N. Y.  The same year Antoinette L. Brown, then a student at Oberlin College,  Ohio, the first institution that made the experiment of co-education,  delivered her first speech on temperance in several places in Ohio,  and on Woman's Rights, in the Baptist church at Henrietta, N. Y. Lucy  Stone, a graduate of Oberlin, made her first speech on Woman's Rights  the same year in her brother's church at Brookfield, Mass.    Nor were the women of Europe inactive during these years. In 1824  Elizabeth Heyrick, a Quaker woman, cut the gordian knot of difficulty  in the anti-slavery struggle in England, by an able essay in favor of  immediate, unconditional emancipation. At Leipsic, in 1844, Helene  Marie Weber--her father a Prussian officer, and her mother an English  woman--wrote a series of ten tracts on \"Woman's Rights and Wrongs,\"  covering the whole question and making a volume of over twelve hundred  pages. The first of these treated of the intellectual faculties; the  second, woman's rights of property; the third, wedlock--deprecating  the custom of woman merging her civil existence in that of her  husband; the fourth claimed woman's right to all political emoluments;  the fifth, on ecclesiasticism, demanded for woman an entrance to the  pulpit; the sixth, upon suffrage, declared it to be woman's right and  duty to vote. These essays were strong, vigorous, and convincing. Miss  Weber also lectured in Vienna, Berlin, and several of the large German  cities. In England, Lady Morgan's \"Woman and her Master\" appeared;--a  work filled with philosophical reflections, and of the same general  bearing as Miss Weber's. Also an \"Appeal of Women,\" the joint work of  Mrs. Wheeler and William Thomson--a strong and vigorous essay, in  which woman's limitations under the law were tersely and pungently set  forth and her political rights demanded. The active part women took in  the Polish and German revolutions and in favor of the abolition of  slavery in the British West Indies, all taught their lessons of  woman's rights. Madam Mathilde Anneke, on the staff of her husband,  with Hon. Carl Schurz, carried messages to and fro in the midst of  danger on the battle-fields of Germany.    Thus over the civilized world we find the same impelling forces, and  general development of society, without any individual concert of  action, tending to the same general result; alike rousing the minds of  men and women to the aggregated wrongs of centuries and inciting to an  effort for their overthrow.    The works of George Sand, Frederika Bremer, Charlotte Bronte, George  Eliot, Catharine Sedgwick, and Harriet Beecher Stowe, in literature;  Mrs. Hemans, Mrs. Sigourney, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, in poetry;  Angelica Kauffman, Rosa Bonheur, Harriet Hosmer, in art; Mary  Somerville, Caroline Herschell, Maria Mitchell, in science; Elizabeth  Fry, Dorothea Dix, Mary Carpenter, in prison reform; Florence  Nightingale and Clara Barton in the camp--are all parts of the great  uprising of women out of the lethargy of the past, and are among the  forces of the complete revolution a thousand pens and voices herald at  this hour.      FOOTNOTES:    [1] As showing woman's ignorance and prejudice, Mrs. Davis used to  relate that when she uncovered her manikin some ladies would drop  their veils because of its indelicacy, and others would run from the  room; sometimes ladies even fainted.    [2] The writer's father, a physician, as early as 1843-4, canvassed  the subject of giving his daughter (Matilda Joslyn Gage) a medical  education, looking to Geneva--then presided over by his old  instructor--to open its doors to her. But this bold idea was dropped,  and Miss Blackwell was the first and only lady who was graduated from  that Institution until its incorporation with the Syracuse University  and the removal of the college to that city.    [3] Judge Hurlbut, with a lawyer's prejudice, first prepared a paper  against the rights of woman. Looking it over, he saw himself able to  answer every argument, which he proceeded to do--the result being his  \"Human Rights.\"    [4] In the New York chapter a fuller account of the discussion and  action upon these bills will be given.    [5] See Appendix.          CHAPTER II.    WOMAN IN NEWSPAPERS.      In newspaper literature woman made her entrance at an early period and  in an important manner. The first _daily_ newspaper in the world was  established and edited by a woman, Elizabeth Mallet, in London, March,  1702. It was called _The Daily Courant_. In her salutatory, Mrs.  Mallet declared she had established her paper to \"spare the public at  least half the impertinences which the ordinary papers contain.\" Thus  the first daily paper was made reformatory in its character by its  wise woman-founder.    The first newspaper printed in Rhode Island was by Anna Franklin in  1732. She was printer to the colony, supplied blanks to the public  officers, published pamphlets, etc., and in 1745 she printed for the  colonial government an edition of the laws comprising three hundred  and forty pages. She was aided by her two daughters, who were correct  and quick compositors. The woman servant of the house usually worked  the press. The third paper established in America was _The Mercury_,  in Philadelphia. After the death of its founder, in 1742, it was  suspended for a week, when his widow, Mrs. Cornelia Bradford, revived  it and carried it on for many years, making it both a literary and a  pecuniary success. The second newspaper started in the city of New  York, entitled the _New York Weekly Journal_, was conducted by Mrs.  Zeuger for years after the death of her husband. She discontinued its  publication in 1748. The _Maryland Gazette_, the first paper in that  colony, and among the oldest in America, was established by Anna K.  Greene in 1767. She did the colony printing and continued the business  till her death, in 1775. Mrs. Hassebatch also established a paper in  Baltimore in 1773. Mrs. Mary K. Goddard published the _Maryland  Journal_ for eight years. Her editorials were of so spirited and  pronounced a character that only her sex saved her from sound  floggings. She took in job work. She was the first postmaster after  the Revolution, holding the office for eight years. Two papers were  early published in Virginia by women. Each was established in  Williamsburg, and each was called _The Virginia Gazette_. The first,  started by Clementina Reid, in 1772, favored the Colonial cause,  giving great offense to many royalists. To counteract its influence,  Mrs. H. Boyle, of the same place, started another paper in 1774, in  the interests of the Crown, and desirous that it should seem to  represent the true principles of the colony, she borrowed the name of  the colonial paper. It lived but a short time. The Colonial _Virginia  Gazette_ was the first paper in which was printed the Declaration of  Independence. A synopsis was given July 19th, and the whole document  the 26th. Mrs. Elizabeth Timothee published a paper in Charleston,  South Carolina, from 1773 to 1775, called _The Gazette_. Anna Timothee  revived it after the Revolution, and was appointed printer to the  State, holding the office till 1792. Mary Crouch also published a  paper in Charleston, S. C., until 1780. It was founded in special  opposition to the Stamp Act. She afterward removed to Salem, Mass.,  and continued its publication for several years. Penelope Russell  printed _The Censor_ in Boston, Mass., in 1771. She set her own type,  and was such a ready compositor as to set up her editorials without  written copy, while working at her case. The most tragical and  interesting events were thus recorded by her. The first paper  published in America, living to a second issue, was the _Massachusetts  Gazette and North Boston News Letter_. It was continued by Mrs.  Margaret Draper, two years after the death of her husband, and was the  only paper of spirit in the colony, all but hers suspending  publication when Boston was besieged by the British. Mrs. Sarah  Goddard printed a paper at Newport, R. I., in 1776. She was a  well-educated woman, and versed in general literature. For two years  she conducted her journal with great ability, afterward associating  John Carter with her, under the name of Sarah Goddard & Co., retaining  the partnership precedence so justly belonging to her. _The Courant_  at Hartford, Ct., was edited for two years by Mrs. Watson, after the  death of her husband, in 1777. In 1784 Mrs. Mary Holt edited and  published the _New York Journal_, continuing the business several  years. She was appointed State printer. In 1798, _The Journal and  Argus_ fell into the hands of Mrs. Greenleaf, who for some time  published both a daily and semi-weekly edition. In Philadelphia, after  the death of her father in 1802, Mrs. Jane Aitkins continued his  business of printing. Her press-work bore high reputation. She was  specially noted for her correctness in proof-reading. The _Free  Enquirer_, edited in New York by Frances Wright in 1828, \"was the  first periodical established in the United States for the purpose of"]]]
