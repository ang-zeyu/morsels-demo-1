Repairs were always wanting: to keep some of the force of the water off  the piers these were furnished with 'starlings,' i.e. at first piles  driven down in front of the piers, afterwards turned into projecting  buttresses of stone. Then corn mills were built in some of the openings,  and in the year 1582 great waterworks were constructed at the southern  end. The tower before the drawbridge was by Queen Elizabeth rebuilt and  made a very splendid house--called Nonesuch House. The Fire destroyed  the houses on the Bridge, some of which were not rebuilt: and in the  year 1757 all the houses were removed from the Bridge.    The New Bridge was finished and opened in 1831--it stands 180 feet west  of its predecessor. Then the Old Bridge was pulled down. The work of  Peter Colechurch lasted from 1209 to 1831 or 622 years. The Pontife  Brothers, therefore, knew how to put in good and lasting work.    This is the history of London Bridge. First a narrow wooden gangway of  beams lying on timber piles with a fortified gate; then a stone  structure of twenty irregular arches, the Bridge broad but the roadway  still narrow with houses on either side and a fortress and a chapel upon  it--in those times there was always a fortress, and there was always a  chapel. It must have been a pleasant place of residence: the air fresh  and clear: the supply of water unlimited--one drew it up in a bucket:  always something going on: the entrance of a foreign ambassador, a  religious procession, a riding of the Lord Mayor, a pageant, a nobleman  with his livery, a Bishop or a Prior with his servants, a pilgrimage, a  string of pack horses out of Kent bringing fruit for the City: always  something to see. Then there were the stories and traditions of the  place, with the songs which the children sang about the Bridge.  Especially there was the story of Edward Osborne. He was the son of one  Richard Osborne, a gentleman of Kent. Like many sons of the poor country  gentlemen, he was sent up to London and apprenticed to Sir William  Hewitt a cloth worker who lived on London Bridge. His master had a  daughter named Anne, a little girl who one day, while playing with her  nurse at an open window overhanging the river, fell out into the rushing  water sixty feet below. The apprentice, young Osborne, leaped into the  river after her and succeeded in saving her. When the girl was grown up  her father gave her to his ex-apprentice, Edward Osborne, to wife.  Edward Osborne became Lord Mayor. His descendant is now Duke of Leeds.  So that the Dukedom of Leeds sprang from that gallant leap out of the  window overhanging the river Thames from London Bridge.          17. THE TOWER OF LONDON.    PART I.      In an age when every noble's house was a castle, and when every castle  was erected in order to dominate, as well as to defend, the town and the  district in which it stood, the Tower of London was erected. The builder  of the White Tower was William the Conqueror, who gave the City its  Charter but had no intention of giving up his own sovereignty; the  architect, as has been already said, was one Gundulph, Bishop of  Rochester. Part of the City wall was pulled down to make room for it,  and it was intended at once for the King's Palace, the King's Castle,  and the King's Prison. It was also the key of London--who held the  Tower, held the City.    William Rufus built a wall round the Tower so as to separate it entirely  from the City and to prevent the danger of a hasty rising of the  people: with the same object he gave it a water gate.    A hundred years later, while Richard Coeur de Lion was on his Crusade,  the moat was constructed. Henry III. and his son Edward I. added to the  outer walls and strengthened them.    [Illustration: TOWER OF LONDON.]    There is a plan of the Tower made from a survey of the year 1597 and  published by the Society of Antiquaries. A study of the plan should be  made before visiting the place. Remark first of all that the fortress  has three entrances only: one at the S.W. angle to the City; one to the  river now called Traitors' Gate; and one on the S.E. angle called the  Irongate: that it is surrounded by a broad and deep moat which could be  filled at every high tide: that from the moat rises a battlemented wall,  and that within this first wall is another, flanked with protecting  towers; that the City entrance is most jealously guarded by a strong  gate first: then by a narrow way passing under a tower: then over a  bridge. In all mediaeval castles the first thought was to make it  impossible to carry the place by a rush. If we would restore the Tower  of Queen Elizabeth to the Tower of Edward III. we must abolish all those  buildings which stand on the north and east sides, with those called  'Lieutenants' Lodgings' on the south. The space on the north side of the  Keep was the exercising ground: stables there must have been somewhere  in this great area; the men at arms would live in the smaller towers. If  you will study this plan carefully, you will understand the general  arrangement of a mediaeval castle.    In the sixteenth century the place was no longer regarded as a fortress  for the defence or the domination of the City. But the old forms were  kept up: nobody was admitted who carried arms: the guard kept the gate:  a garrison was maintained. Within, there was an armoury, the beginning  of the splendid collection which is now shown: there was a Mint for the  coining of money: there were collections of tapestry, saddles, bed  furniture and robes belonging to the Crown: here were kept the Crown and  sceptre and insignia: here was the Royal menagerie. Here were the rooms  reserved for state criminals. It was no longer the Royal Palace but the  sovereign sometimes occupied the Tower. James the First was here, for  instance, in 1604.    Near the outer gate where is now the Refreshment Room were kept the  King's lions. Henry I. began this menagerie which was continued until  the year 1834. At the entrance of the fortress is the Bell Tower where  Queen Elizabeth was once confined. The Water Gate called Traitors' Gate  is under St. Thomas's Tower. The Beauchamp Tower has been the prison of,  among others, Queen Anne Boleyn and Lady Jane Grey. In the Great White  Tower Richard II. abdicated in favour of Henry IV. In the vaults are  dungeons, once the prison of Guy Fawkes. In the Chapel the newly made  Knights of the Bath watched their armour all night long. The collection  of arms contains examples of weapons and armour of every age. In the  Church of St. Peter ad Vincula you will find the graves of the  unfortunate Princes, Queens, and nobles who have been executed for State  offences. Nothing, except the Royal tombs of Westminster, so much helps  to prove the reality of History, as this collection of graves and slabs  and tablets in this little church. And here were kept the Crown jewels  about which many a chapter might be written.    But to study the Tower of London one must visit it with the History of  England in hand. Hither were brought all the State prisoners: here they  were confined: here they were executed. Every tower, every stone reminds  one of sufferers and criminals and traitors and innocent victims. Do  not, however, forget that this Tower was built for the restriction of  the liberties of the people. That purpose has been defeated. The  liberties have grown beyond what could ever have been hoped while the  privileges of the Crown, which this Tower was built to protect and to  enlarge, have been restricted beyond the greatest fears of the mediaeval  kings.          18. THE TOWER OF LONDON.    PART II.      Of all the prisoners who suffered death at the termination of their  captivity in the Tower, there is none whose fate was so cruel as that of  Lady Jane Grey. Her story belongs to English history. Recall, when next  you visit the Tower, the short and tragic life of this young Queen of a  nine days' reign.    [Illustration]    She was not yet eighteen when she was beheaded, not through any fault of  her own, but solely because her relationship to the Crown placed her in  the hands of men who used her for their own political purposes. She was  the second cousin of Edward VI., Mary, and Elizabeth. Her grandmother  was the sister of Henry VIII., widow of Louis XII. of France, and wife  of Charles, Duke of Suffolk. The young King on his deathbed was  persuaded to name her as his successor. She was sixteen years of age:  she was already married to Lord Guilford Dudley, son of the Duke of  Northumberland: when she was proclaimed Queen. Nine days after the  proclamation she was a prisoner. On the 8th of July she was  acknowledged Queen by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen: on the 10th she was  taken by water from Greenwich to the Tower, and proclaimed Queen in the  City: on the 17th another proclamation was made of Queen Mary, and her  reign was over. But the Tower she was never more to leave.    On the 13th of November--after five months of suspense--she was tried  for high treason with Cranmer, her husband Lord Guilford, and her  husband's brother, Lord Ambrose. They were all four found guilty, and  condemned to death--their judges being the very men who had sworn  allegiance to her as Queen. It would seem that Mary had no desire to  carry out the sentence: Cranmer she reserved for a more cruel death than  that of beheading--he was to be burned as a heretic. The other three,  two boys and a girl, it would be dangerous to execute on account of the  popular sympathy their death would awaken. They were therefore sent back  to the Tower. Probably it was intended that Lady Jane, at least, should  pass the rest of her life in honourable captivity, as happened later on  to Arabella Stuart. But the rebellion of Wyatt showed that her name  could still be used as a cry in favour of a Protestant succession.

Ah! did they but know it.    Verily, for the God-fearing are gardens of delight in the presence of their  Lord.    Shall we then deal with those who have surrendered themselves to God, as with  those who offend him?    What hath befallen you that ye thus judge?    Have ye a Scripture wherein ye can search out    That ye shall have the things ye choose?    Or have ye received oaths which shall bind Us even until the day of the  resurrection, that ye shall have what yourselves judge right?    Ask them which of them will guarantee this?    Or is it that they have joined gods with God? let them produce those  associate-gods of theirs, if they speak truth.    On the day when men's legs shall be bared,6 and they shall be called upon to  bow in adoration, they shall not be able:    Their looks shall be downcast: shame shall cover them: because, while yet in  safety, they were invited to bow in worship, but would not obey.    Leave me alone therefore with him who chargeth this revelation with  imposture. We will lead them by degrees to their ruin; by ways which they  know not;    Yet will I bear long with them; for my plan is sure.    Askest thou any recompense from them? But they are burdened with debt.    Are the secret things within their ken? Do they copy them from the Book of  God?    Patiently then await the judgment of thy Lord, and be not like him who was in  the fish,7 when in deep distress he cried to God.    Had not favour from his Lord reached him, cast forth would he have been on  the naked shore, overwhelmed with shame:    But his Lord chose him and made him of the just.    Almost would the infidels strike thee down with their very looks when they  hear the warning of the Koran. And they say, \"He is certainly possessed.\"    Yet is it nothing less than a warning for all creatures.      _______________________    1 It has been conjectured that as the word Nun means fish, there may be a  reference to the fish which swallowed Jonas (v. 48). The fact, however, is  that the meaning of this and of the similar symbols, throughout the Koran,  was unknown to the Muhammadans themselves even in the first century. Possibly  the letters Ha, Mim, which are prefixed to numerous successive Suras were  private marks, or initial letters, attached by their proprietor to the copies  furnished to Said when effecting his recension of the text under Othman. In  the same way, the letters prefixed to other Suras may be monograms, or  abbreviations, or initial letters of the names of the persons to whom the  copies of the respective Suras belonged.    addenda: The symbol nun may possibly refer to this letter as forming the  Rhyme in most of the verses of this Sura.    2 This Sura has been supposed by ancient Muslim authorities to be, if not the  oldest, the second revelation, and to have followed Sura xcvi. But this  opinion probably originated from the expression in v. 1 compared with Sura  xcvi. 4. Verses 17-33 read like a later addition, and this passage, as well  as verse 48-50, has been classed with the Medina revelations. In the absence  of any reliable criterion for fixing the date, I have placed this Sura with  those which detail the opposition encountered by the Prophet at Mecca.    3 By djinn. Comp.

What! have we not made him eyes,    And tongue, and lips,    And guided him to the two highways?2    Yet he attempted not the steep.    And who shall teach thee what the steep is?    It is to ransom the captive,3    Or to feed in the day of famine,    The orphan who is near of kin, or the poor that lieth in the dust;    Beside this, to be of those who believe, and enjoin stedfastness on each  other, and enjoin compassion on each other.

And he sent against them birds in flocks (ababils),    Claystones did they hurl down upon them,    And he made them like stubble eaten down!      _______________________    1 This Sura is probably Muhammad's appeal to the Meccans, intended at the  same time for his own encouragement, on the ground of their deliverance from  the army of Abraha, the Christian King of Abyssinia and Arabia Felix, said to  have been lost in the year of Muhammad's birth in an expedition against Mecca  for the purpose of destroying the Caaba. This army was cut off by small-pox  (Wakidi; Hishami), and there is no doubt, as the Arabic word for small-pox  also means \"small stones,\" in reference to the hard gravelly feeling of the  pustules, what is the true interpretation of the fourth line of this Sura,  which, like many other poetical passages in the Koran, has formed the  starting point for the most puerile and extravagant legends.

I swear by the heaven which accomplisheth its cycle,    And by the earth which openeth her bosom,    That this Koran is a discriminating discourse,    And that it is not frivolous.
