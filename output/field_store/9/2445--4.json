Many coats  began to be embroidered in the later reign, and waistcoats became a  special feature for the display of fine needlecraft on the fronts and  pockets, while quilting or imitations of it in various needlework  designs are often seen. In the female dress a more elaborate interest  was again taken in the stomachers and the jewelled claspings, while  lengths of soft silk gathered into long puffs often edged the outer  skirts or were used in smaller trimmings, and \"classical\" shapings of  the edges of materials and sleeves are often seen, also heavy bands of  rich embroidery bordered the underskirt or train.      SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. JAMES I. FEMALE.    We find much the same high forms of set-up head-dress continuing in  fashion as in the later years of Elizabeth's reign; but the hair began  to take a fuller shape, rather round, done up in tight frizzled curls,  with the usual decorations of jewels, pearls, or set bows of this  period. Hats with high crowns and small straight brims, with an upright  set of small plumes, gradually assumed a larger brimmed character--often  turned up on one side. The same absurd pleated hoop, with its hanging  skirt, continued for some time (worn rather short); but we also see the  longer and very full hooped-out skirt, with an overskirt opened in the  front. The stomacher front became much enlarged during this reign, many  having shaped designs at the point. Most bodices took a very deep curved  front at the neck, and large padded sleeves narrowed at the wrist still  continued, besides the high fan collar at the back of the neck, and  large ruffs were used by many. There also appeared, later in the reign,  a stiff round collar, set high in the neck, cut off straight across  the front, and the bodice took a very low square-cut neck, with a raised  curved shape at the centre of neck. The tighter sleeve was also worn  throughout this time, with the overdress and sleeve hanging almost to  the ground, which often had a very angular cuff. A little later some  sleeves began to be gathered at intervals into puffy forms. The waist  also showed signs of shortening.    [Illustration: FIG. 58.]    [Illustration: FIG. 59.--Costumes. Period, James I.]    Shoes with rounded toes and latchets holding large rosettes were chiefly  worn, and heels of various heights are seen. Chopins, still worn on the  Continent, do not seem to have appeared here.      SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. JAMES I. MALE.    The hat was of the high-crowned type, perhaps higher than in the last  reign. The brim had broadened, and feathers were placed upwards  fantastically at the back and sides of crown. Brims were often fastened  up on the right side with a jewel; otherwise a band was buckled in  front. The hair was now allowed to fall longer again, and a pointed or  square-shaped beard with a brushed-up moustache was the mode. Ruffs both  large and small surrounded the neck, and a flat fan-shaped collar  was seen in the earlier years.    [Illustration: Plate XIV.--        (_a_) Embroidered Silk Dress with Pannier. 1765-80.      (_b_) Brocade Dress and Quilted Petticoat. 1750-65.    _Pattern of bodice, p. 322._]    [Illustration: FIG. 60.--Costumes. Period James I.]    The jerkin was close fitting and the length of the waist more normal,  with less tendency to being tightened in, and not so deep in the front  point, so as to set better over the very full trunks or breeches. The  square tabs of the jerkin increased in size, and soon formed large flaps  divided into three or four, to the centre of the back. Sleeves were  fairly tight and started from slightly larger epaulets, and were usually  set at the wrist, either with a small ruff or turned-up lawn cuff, edged  with lace.    The trunks were padded in a very full shape and were much longer, just  above the knee. Also full padded-out breeches tapering to the knee or  just above, where a large tie and bow hung at the side, and full square  breeches not tied in, are also a feature of these days, usually banded  with wide braids at ends and sides. Upright pockets were made on either  side towards the front, about two inches from the side seams. They  fastened up the front in a pleated fold, many being decorated with  punched, pricked, or slashed design of a smallish character.    [Illustration: FIG. 61.--Shapes of Shoes from 1590-1650.]    Cloaks were worn longer to the knee, retaining the same shapes and  braid decoration as in the Elizabethan period, and hanging sleeves were  still worn on them, as well as on some of the jerkins.    Shoes became fuller and rounder at the toes, mostly with thick welted  soles and short heels, or none. They were fastened with a large rosette  of gold lace or ribbon on the front, and the latchets were set back to  show an open side. The top-boots were close fitting and took squarer  toes; the spur flap being rather small. Beautifully embroidered clocks  are seen on the tights and stockings of this period.      SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. CHARLES I. FEMALE.    The hair was now allowed to fall in ringlets round the back and sides,  with a few flat curls on the brow, and a bow and pearls were caught in  at the sides. Short feathers may also be noted in use. A plait was often  coiled at the back after 1630.    [Illustration: Plate XV.--        (_a_) White Cloth Coat. 1775-90.      (_b_) Silk Dress. 1740-60.      (_c_) Embroidered Velvet Coat. 1755-75.]    [Illustration: FIG. 62.]    [Illustration: FIG. 63.    Collar and Bodice types. Period Charles I.]    [Illustration: FIG. 64.    Collar and Bodice types. Period Charles I to 1660.]    In the early part of this reign the ladies were wearing the long  corset-bodice, with a richly decorated stomacher which curved outwards  to set on the very full skirts; this often finished with a curved or  foliated shape at the point. Square starched collars, rounded at  the back, sometimes set up at the back of the neck or flat on the  shoulder, and ruffs were still seen round the neck with collars as well,  but they were seldom met with after 1635. A plainer, deep collar, flat,  round, or =V=-shaped at the back, coming well over the shoulders, was  caught together by a bow or ornament in front. About 1630 shorter  waisted bodices came in, with full, loose sleeves set in epaulets: the  neck shape was rounded or square. The bodices were often slashed, and  the full sleeves, cut into bands, were sometimes gathered by cross bands  from one to three times. Full plain sleeves, opened in the front seam,  were also clasped at the elbow in a like manner. Outer short sleeves  became a feature, opening in the front, showing the full under one or a  tight one; the waist became very short and its tabs larger. A waistband  fastened in the stomacher with a bow either side and bows with long gold  tags decorated the waist as in the male jerkin. The skirt decorated by a  band of ornament down the front was often tied upon the corset-bodice,  the front point being left outside. Shoes of the same shape as the male  illustrations, with very square toes, were frequent, but an oval toe,  rather pointed, is seen in many pictures, with the large lace rosettes  in front. Muffs are first noticed in these days, though they were seen  much earlier on the Continent.    [Illustration: FIG. 65.--Period 1625-1660.]      SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. CHARLES I. MALE.    The hair was worn loose to the shoulders, and a small plait was  sometimes arranged on the left side, brought to the front of shoulder.  The beard was trimmed to a pointed shape, and smarter curled moustaches  were fashionable. Hats were still high in the crown, but rather lower  than with James I; the large brims were turned about in various curves,  and feathers were worn falling over the brims to the side or back.    The jerkin was high in the collar, supporting a large, square, turn-down  collar edged with pointed lace to the shoulders, or a small, plain,  turn-over collar; ruffs are very rarely seen after 1630.    [Illustration: FIG. 66.--Charles I.]    [Illustration: FIG. 67.--Period 1625-1660.]    [Illustration: FIG. 68.--Period 1625-1660.]    A rather short waist grew shorter during this reign, with much larger  tabs, or large flaps laced to the body, forming a series of bows with  long gilt tags round the waist. The body is usually decorated with  long slashes from the shoulders to the breast, or the full length, and a  long slashed opening is often seen in the back (presumably to give more  play to the sword-thrust). The sleeve is also treated in the same way to  the elbow or waist. All sleeves start from a stiff epaulet. Breeches are  both very full and fairly tight, the latter edged with a purfling of  silk or gold lace as well as the sides, the former shape tied either  above or below the knee with a large silk bow with falling ends. They  were held up by a number of hooks, fastening to a small flap with  eyelets, round the inside of the doublet (see pattern 11, p. 295), and  were buttoned down the front, the buttons being half hidden in a pleat.  The pockets were placed vertically in the front of the thigh, and were  frequently of a decorative character.    A short or long circular cloak was worn, and a coat-cloak with opened  sleeves is an interesting garment. These coverings were hung in various  ways from the shoulders by methods of tying the cords across the body.    [Illustration: FIG. 69.--Period 1625-1660.]    [Illustration: FIG. 70.--Shoe shapes.

That one, the spongilla, is not  easily found and is very difficult to maintain in the laboratory. For  these reasons the material for this study is very meager, except at  the seashore, and much of the work must be done from diagrams and  reference books. Small simple preserved sponges and complex toilet  sponge skeletons will also be used.          _Definitions._    _Body wall_, the outer wall in bodies of the many-celled animals.    _Central cavity_, the cavity surrounded by the body wall in the  simpler many-celled animals, as in the sponges.    _Canals_, channels through the body walls of sponges.    _Inhalent pores_, the outer ends of the canals.    _Ostia_, the inner ends of the canals.    _Osculum_, the large opening of the central cavity, at the distal end  of the sponge.    _Spicules_, tiny needles of mineral substance found in the walls of  many sponges.    _Fibers_, flexible threads of horny material found in the walls of  many sponges.    _Endoderm cells_, cells lining the canals. They have cilia or  flagella (projections larger than cilia).    _Ectoderm cells_, cells covering the outside of sponges and some  other animals. In sponges it is believed that endoderm and ectoderm  cells are able to exchange positions and functions.    _Mesoglea_, a jelly-like layer between the endoderm and ectoderm  layers. In the sponges this contains many wandering cells, probably  from the other layers.    _Porifera_ (pore bearers), animals with many more or less independent  cells, supported by solid skeletal parts and penetrated by a system  of canals which open on the surface as pores.          _Directions._    Study a simple sponge to see the shape, size, and point of  attachment. Identify the osculum. In a diagram of a long section of a  simple sponge identify the central cavity, body walls, canals,  inhalent pores, ostia, and osculum. In a simple sponge cut like the  diagram identify the same structures. Do the same for the toilet  sponge.    Study a diagram of a portion of the body wall, considerably enlarged.  Identify the endoderm and ectoderm cells, the spicules or fibers,  and, among the spicules or fibers, irregular amoeboid cells,  sometimes called mesoderm cells.    Examine a fragment or section of each kind of sponge under the  microscope. Notice the arrangement, shape, and length of the spicules  and of the fibers.    Test both kinds of sponges by dropping a bit of each into weak acid,  and noting the results. Also burn a bit of each and notice the odor.          _Questions._    1. What is the shape of a simple sponge? What enables a mass of cells  to retain such a definite shape?    2. What seems to be the composition of the skeletons? Why is one type  of skeleton rigid and the other elastic?    3. Since sponges are attached for most of their lives to stationary  objects, suggest means for obtaining food and oxygen, and for getting  rid of waste matter.    4. Although individual cells are sensitive, a sponge as a whole is  not. What connection has this fact with the fact that sponges are  stationary?      5. Compare simple and complex sponges.          _Suggested drawings._    a. A view of a simple sponge. Label everything shown.    b. A diagram of a simple sponge split in halves. Show by arrows the  path followed by the water as it passes through the sponge.    c. A few spicules.    d. A few fibers.      Summary of Important Points in the Study of Sponges      1. What are two functions of the spicules or fibers?    2. What are at least two of the functions of the endoderm cells?    3. What can you suggest as functions for the ectoderm cells?    4. In what cases do cells show \"team work\" in accomplishing an  object?    5. What degree of specialization is indicated by the fact that the  cells may exchange positions and functions?    6. What work can any single cell of a sponge do? Compare the work  done by such a cell with that done by a paramecium.    7. What work can a whole sponge do? Compare that with the work done  by a paramecium.      Review and Library Exercise on Sponges      1. What are the distinguishing characteristics of Porifera?    2. Sponges were once supposed to be plants. In what respect are they  plant-like? What made students finally class them as animals?    3. How do sponges reproduce? How are they distributed to new  locations?    4. Where, as to depth of water, do most sponges grow? Where, as to  oceans? Where, as to latitude?    5. What are some of the difficulties which confront a stationary  animal? How are they overcome?    6. To what class of sponges do the \"toilet\" sponges belong? Why?    7. What conditions are necessary for toilet sponges to thrive? Where  are the best ones found? Where are they most numerous? How are they  collected? How are they prepared for market?    8. What is man able to do toward raising good sponges for market?    9. Using reference books and museum specimens, describe some  especially odd sponges.      3. A STUDY OF COELENTERATES    _To show cells working together more definitely than in Sponges_      A Study of Hydra          _Materials._    Living hydras in permanent aquaria, undisturbed. Living hydras in  small aquaria, _i.e._ tumblers, test tubes, watch glasses, etc., with  pieces of water weed and if possible some of the microscopic animals  found in water where hydras are abundant. If kept cool, hydras may  live several days in such aquaria. Permanent slides of hydras;  some whole, some in sections, and some showing the organs of  reproduction.          _Definitions._    _Proximal end_, the end by which an animal is attached to an object.    _Distal end_, the end opposite the proximal end.    _Tentacles_, slender projections around the distal end.    _Mouth_, the opening through the distal end, into the central cavity.    _Bud_, a small hydra or other coelenterate growing out from the wall  of the parent.    _Mesoglea_, a thin, gluey partition, without wandering cells, between  the ectoderm and the endoderm.    _Nettle cells_, very small cells, chiefly in the tentacles, easily  identified in permanent preparations as clear cells with small hairs  projecting from them. See text-books for details of their structure.    _Spermary_, the region or organ where the sperm cells are formed.    _Ovary_, the region or organ where the egg cells are formed.    _Coelenterates_ (hollow bowels), sac-shaped animals, the digestive  tract having only one opening; the body wall is of two layers.          _Directions._    Take a small aquarium to your table, set it down carefully and leave  it undisturbed. Identify a hydra and watch it for some time.          _Observations on the living animals._    1. Describe the size and shape of a hydra when expanded. Disturb it  slightly by shaking the aquarium a little, and describe its shape  when contracted. Notice also the flexibility of the body. What do you  infer concerning the hydra's possession of a skeleton? What advantage  can it be to have a body so flexible?    2. How many tentacles has the hydra that you are studying? What does  the hydra do with these tentacles when it is expanded? What is the  probable object of such actions?    3. How does a hydra respond to contact? What seems to be the object  of such a response?    4. Notice the location of the hydras in the large, undisturbed  aquaria. Where are they placed as regards the light side of the  aquarium? Of what value is such a response to light in their case?    5. How can a hydra locate the small animals which are its food?      How can it capture them?    6. What motions may a hydra perform, while remaining attached by its  base? What are the results of these movements?    7. If you have happened to see a hydra move from one place to  another, describe the process. If not, give the facts which lead you  to believe that it is able to do so. Suggest all the methods you  think it may be able to use. What is your opinion of the hydra's  power of locomotion? Of what use is it in getting food; in escaping  enemies; in following the fluctuations of the water supply? If you  had to class the hydra as either one, would you call it a stationary  or a locomotory animal?    8. Study budding hydras. Compare the bud with the parent hydra as to  size, form and number and size of tentacles. Notice whether the bud  moves independently or only with the parent. When does it separate  from the parent?      9. In hydras collected late in the fall you may see another    method of reproduction. If such material is at hand, notice small    swellings near the proximal end and others near the tentacles.    Eggs are produced in the lower one, the ovary, and sperm cells    in the upper one, the spermary. Refer to your text-book for    further details.          _Details of structure._    1. Using an entire mounted specimen and a section of hydra, identify  the body wall and the central cavity. What is the extent of the  central cavity? (Examine both the body and the tentacles.) Where does  it open to the outside? What do you think is its use?    2. In the body wall, identify the endodermal and ectodermal layers of  cells, separated by the mesoglea, which is usually stained more  deeply. Study these cell layers carefully. What work ought each to  do? What can you discover in its structure which would fit each layer  to do its work?    3. In the tentacles, identify the nettle cells. Where are they? How  are they arranged? About how many of them would be discharged if a  small animal were to bump into a tentacle?      Summary of Important Points in the Study of Hydra      1. Name the different kinds of cells in a hydra. Which kind differs  most from such a cell as the starfish egg? What work does this  specialized cell do?    2. How much of a hydra's body may be set in action by touching a  tentacle? Contrast this with the sponge. What do you"]]]
