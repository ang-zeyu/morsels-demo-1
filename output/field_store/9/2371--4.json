But  canst thou wonder that I fear thy wearying of me, and am therefore  peevish and jealous? thou so far above the Queens of the World, and I a  poor youth that without thee were nothing!\"    She answered nought, and he went on again: \"Was it not so, O goddess,  that this man of the sons of the merchants was little heedful of thee,  and thy loveliness and thy majesty?\"    She laughed and said: \"Maybe he deemed not that he had much to gain of  us, seeing thee sitting by our side, and whereas we spake to him coldly  and sternly and disdainfully.  Withal, the poor youth was dazzled and  shamefaced before us; that we could see in the eyes and the mien of him.\"    Now this she spoke so kindly and sweetly, that again was Walter all  stirred thereat; and it came into his mind that it might be she knew he  was anigh and hearing her, and that she spake as much for him as for the  King's Son: but that one answered: \"Lady, didst thou not see somewhat  else in his eyes, to wit, that they had but of late looked on some fair  woman other than thee?  As for me, I deem it not so unlike that on the  way to thine hall he may have fallen in with thy Maid.\"    He spoke in a faltering voice, as if shrinking from some storm that might  come.  And forsooth the Lady's voice was changed as she answered, though  there was no outward heat in it; rather it was sharp and eager and cold  at once.  She said: \"Yea, that is not ill thought of; but we may not  always keep our thrall in mind.  If it be so as thou deemest, we shall  come to know it most like when we next fall in with her; or if she hath  been shy this time, then shall she pay the heavier for it; for we will  question her by the Fountain in the Hall as to what betid by the Fountain  of the Rock.\"    Spake the King's Son, faltering yet more: \"Lady, were it not better to  question the man himself? the Maid is stout-hearted, and will not be  speedily quelled into a true tale; whereas the man I deem of no account.\"    \"No, no,\" said the Lady sharply, \"it shall not be.\"    Then was she silent a while; and then she said: \"How if the man should  prove to be our master?\"    \"Nay, our Lady,\" said the King's Son, \"thou art jesting with me; thou and  thy might and thy wisdom, and all that thy wisdom may command, to be over-  mastered by a gangrel churl!\"    \"But how if I will not have it command, King's Son?\" said the Lady.  \"I  tell thee I know thine heart, but thou knowest not mine.  But be at  peace!  For since thou hast prayed for this woman--nay, not with thy  words, I wot, but with thy trembling hands, and thine anxious eyes, and  knitted brow--I say, since thou hast prayed for her so earnestly, she  shall escape this time.  But whether it will be to her gain in the long  run, I misdoubt me.  See thou to that, Otto! thou who hast held me in  thine arms so oft.  And now thou mayest depart if thou wilt.\"    It seemed to Walter as if the King's Son were dumbfoundered at her words:  he answered nought, and presently he rose from the ground, and went his  ways slowly toward the house.  The Lady lay there a little while, and  then went her ways also; but turned away from the house toward the wood  at the other end thereof, whereby Walter had first come thither.    As for Walter, he was confused in mind and shaken in spirit; and withal  he seemed to see guile and cruel deeds under the talk of those two, and  waxed wrathful thereat.  Yet he said to himself, that nought might he do,  but was as one bound hand and foot, till he had seen the Maid again.          CHAPTER XIII: NOW IS THE HUNT UP      Next morning was he up betimes, but he was cast down and heavy of heart,  not looking for aught else to betide than had betid those last four days.  But otherwise it fell out; for when he came down into the hall, there was  the lady sitting on the high-seat all alone, clad but in a coat of white  linen; and she turned her head when she heard his footsteps, and looked  on him, and greeted him, and said: \"Come hither, guest.\"    So he went and stood before her, and she said: \"Though as yet thou hast  had no welcome here, and no honour, it hath not entered into thine heart  to flee from us; and to say sooth, that is well for thee, for flee away  from our hand thou mightest not, nor mightest thou depart without our  furtherance.  But for this we can thee thank, that thou hast abided here  our bidding and eaten thine heart through the heavy wearing of four days,  and made no plaint.  Yet I cannot deem thee a dastard; thou so well knit  and shapely of body, so clear-eyed and bold of visage.  Wherefore now I  ask thee, art thou willing to do me service, thereby to earn thy  guesting?\"    Walter answered her, somewhat faltering at first, for he was astonished  at the change which had come over her; for now she spoke to him in  friendly wise, though indeed as a great lady would speak to a young man  ready to serve her in all honour.  Said he: \"Lady, I can thank thee  humbly and heartily in that thou biddest me do thee service; for these  days past I have loathed the emptiness of the hours, and nought better  could I ask for than to serve so glorious a Mistress in all honour.\"    She frowned somewhat, and said: \"Thou shalt not call me Mistress; there  is but one who so calleth me, that is my thrall; and thou art none such.  Thou shalt call me Lady, and I shall be well pleased that thou be my  squire, and for this present thou shalt serve me in the hunting.  So get  thy gear; take thy bow and arrows, and gird thee to thy sword.  For in  this fair land may one find beasts more perilous than be buck or hart.  I  go now to array me; we will depart while the day is yet young; for so  make we the summer day the fairest.\"    He made obeisance to her, and she arose and went to her chamber, and  Walter dight himself, and then abode her in the porch; and in less than  an hour she came out of the hall, and Walter's heart beat when he saw  that the Maid followed her hard at heel, and scarce might he school his  eyes not to gaze over-eagerly at his dear friend.  She was clad even as  she was before, and was changed in no wise, save that love troubled her  face when she first beheld him, and she had much ado to master it:  howbeit the Mistress heeded not the trouble of her, or made no semblance  of heeding it, till the Maiden's face was all according to its wont.    But this Walter found strange, that after all that disdain of the Maid's  thralldom which he had heard of the Mistress, and after all the threats  against her, now was the Mistress become mild and debonaire to her, as a  good lady to her good maiden.  When Walter bowed the knee to her, she  turned unto the Maid, and said: \"Look thou, my Maid, at this fair new  Squire that I have gotten!  Will not he be valiant in the greenwood?  And  see whether he be well shapen or not.  Doth he not touch thine heart,  when thou thinkest of all the woe, and fear, and trouble of the World  beyond the Wood, which he hath escaped, to dwell in this little land  peaceably, and well-beloved both by the Mistress and the Maid?  And thou,  my Squire, look a little at this fair slim Maiden, and say if she  pleaseth thee not: didst thou deem that we had any thing so fair in this  lonely place?\"    Frank and kind was the smile on her radiant visage, nor did she seem to  note any whit the trouble on Walter's face, nor how he strove to keep his  eyes from the Maid.  As for her, she had so wholly mastered her  countenance, that belike she used her face guilefully, for she stood as  one humble but happy, with a smile on her face, blushing, and with her  head hung down as if shamefaced before a goodly young man, a stranger.    But the Lady looked upon her kindly and said: \"Come hither, child, and  fear not this frank and free young man, who belike feareth thee a little,  and full certainly feareth me; and yet only after the manner of men.\"    And therewith she took the Maid by the hand and drew her to her, and  pressed her to her bosom, and kissed her cheeks and her lips, and undid  the lacing of her gown and bared a shoulder of her, and swept away her  skirt from her feet; and then turned to Walter and said: \"Lo thou,  Squire! is not this a lovely thing to have grown up amongst our rough oak-  boles?  What! art thou looking at the iron ring there?  It is nought,  save a token that she is mine, and that I may not be without her.\"    Then she took the Maid by the shoulders and turned her about as in sport,  and said: \"Go thou now, and bring hither the good grey ones; for needs  must we bring home some venison to-day, whereas this stout warrior may  not feed on nought save manchets and honey.\"    So the Maid went her way, taking care, as Walter deemed, to give no side  glance to him.  But he stood there shamefaced, so confused with all this  openhearted kindness of the great Lady and with the fresh sight of the  darling beauty of the Maid, that he went nigh to thinking that all he had  heard since he had come to the porch of the house that first time was but  a dream of evil.    But while he stood pondering these matters, and staring before him as one  mazed, the Lady laughed out in his face, and touched him on the arm and  said: \"Ah, our Squire, is it so that now thou hast seen my Maid thou  wouldst with a good will abide behind to talk with her?  But call to mind  thy word pledged to me e'en now!  And moreover I tell thee this for thy  behoof now she is out of ear-shot, that I will above all things take thee  away to-day: for there be other eyes, and they nought uncomely, that look  at whiles on my fair-ankled thrall; and who knows but the swords might be  out if I take not the better heed, and give thee not every whit of thy  will.\"    As she spoke and moved forward, he turned a little, so that now the edge  of that hazel-coppice was within his eye-shot, and he deemed that once  more he saw the yellow-brown evil thing crawling forth from the thicket;  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30550"],[0,"Finn The Wolfhound (#10)"],[1,"never to  spoil their appetites by permitting them at any time to experience  surfeit; and, in the third place, he believed strongly in light  meals for young hounds, as distinguished from the sort of meal  often given, which leaves the puppy fit for nothing but the heavy  sleep of the overeaten. Tara's pups romped after their meals, and  slept before them. Their digestions were never overtaxed, and their  soft, unset legs were never overstrained by the extremely bulging  stomach which many breeders associate as a matter of course with  puppyhood. This the Master held to be a point of great importance  with hounds of this kind, whose limbs take just as long to harden  and set as those of any other breed, while their increase in weight  to be carried on those limbs is enormously rapid, at all events in  the case of such whelps as those of Tara's.    For instance, at the age of five weeks Finn weighed just over  fourteen pounds. Sixteen days later he weighed 22 lbs. 2 ozs.,  while the other three pups weighed respectively on the same day 20  lbs., 19 1/2 lbs., and 18 3/4 lbs. Growth at the rate of just half  a pound weight per day is growth which requires a good deal of wise  feeding and care. At the age of twenty weeks Finn weighed 91 [sic] 1/4  lbs. Puppies' legs are easily bowed and rarely straightened. Finn  and his brother and sisters were never allowed on damp ground at  this period. It was rarely that they were out of the sight of  either the Master or the Mistress of the Kennels for more than half  an hour at a time. As the Master said, breeding champion Irish  Wolfhounds is no light undertaking. The Mistress of the Kennels was  the more inclined to agree with him for the reason that it was her  province to see to it, even when the pups were having their nine  meals a day, that the same kind of meal was never served twice  consecutively. The dietary included four or five staple articles,  with as many as seven or eight different accessories. The bills of  fare at different successive periods were as studiously and exactly  drawn up by the Master as ever a human patient's diet is arranged  by doctors in a hospital.    But of all these things, which kept several people pretty busy--five  or six feeding dishes were scalded and washed nine times a  day; there was a puppy's kitchen and a puppy's larder--Finn and his  companions knew nothing. To them life was the most delightfully  haphazard affair, made up exclusively of playing, sleeping, and  eating, with a little occasional fighting and mock-fighting (over  the huge bones which were placed at their disposal to serve the  purpose of tooth-brushes and tooth-sharpeners) by way of diversion  and excitement. Their play was not at all unlike that of human  children. They loved to dig holes in the ground; to hide behind  tree-trunks and spring out upon one another with terrifying cries  and pretended fierceness; all kinds of make-believe appealed to  them greatly, and to none of them more keenly than to Finn, who  liked to come galloping down from the other end of the orchard to  the old oak tree, flying exaggerated danger signals, and making  believe that he was pursued by a savage and remorseless enemy.    [Illustration:  Tara smiled broadly, and stretched out her fore-legs  on the ground.]    One morning, very much to the amazement of the pups, the Master  came strolling into the orchard, followed by a huge creature of  their own species, who walked with the slow and gracious dignity of  a great queen. None of them guessed that this was Tara, their own  mother, and Tara herself gave no sign of being aware that these  were her own children. After some minutes of embarrassed, watchful  uncertainty, Finn, greatly daring, ventured to step out from among  his companions and approach Tara closely enough to sniff warily at  her legs and tail, his own tail hanging meekly on the ground the  while. Tara sniffed at him once with amiable indifference, and then  turned her head the other way. Two minutes later Finn had  discovered that this great hound was perfectly well-meaning and  kindly disposed, and that, his habit and nature being what they  were, was sufficient to place him at once upon terms of highly  presumptuous familiarity. Having watched their daring brother from  a distance so far, the other pups now took heart of grace, and were  soon sniffing respectfully about Tara's legs. For a moment the  mother of heroes felt, or pretended to feel, mere boredom; but as  the Master turned away to look at some distant object--a diplomatic  move upon his part this--Tara smiled broadly, stretched out her  fore-legs on the ground, exactly as a cat will when about to play,  and, again in cat-like fashion, began to spring about, around, and  over the half-fearful but wholly delighted puppies. When the Master  turned round again, the five of them, mother and four children,  were in the midst of the wildest sort of frolic, and impudent Finn  had actually reached the length of growling at his mother with  theatrical savagery, and leaping at the loose skin about her throat  with widely distended eyes and gaping jaws.    After this Tara spent most of her days in the orchard with the  pups. When tired of their frivolity, she would retire to the roots  of the oak tree and give them to understand that they were not to  bother her further, or she would leap the gate leading into the  garden, leaving her offspring gaping admiringly upon its orchard  side, and stroll into the Master's den for an hour or so. On one  occasion she opened a new vista of life before Finn and the others.  At the higher end of the orchard, nearest to the open downs, there  were a number of rabbit earths, and one morning, when the four pups  were frolicsomely following Tara in that direction, an unwary  rabbit allowed the dogs to get between himself and the earths. Too  late the rabbit started up from the leaf he had been nibbling, and  headed for his burrow. Tara bounded forward and cut off his  retreat. Wheeling then at a tangent, the rabbit flew toward the far  end of the orchard, where there was a gap in the fence. Tara was  after him like the wind, her puppies excitedly galloping in her  wake, yapping with delight. Half-way across the orchard Tara  overtook the bunny, and her great jaws closed upon the middle of  its body, smashing the spinal column and killing instantaneously. A  moment later and Finn was on the scene in a frenzy of excitement.  Tara drew back, eyeing the dead rabbit with lofty unconcern. Finn,  on the other hand, endowed the poor dead little beast with the  dangerous ferocity of a live tiger, and sprang upon it, snarling  and growling desperately. Round and round his head he whirled the  rabbit till his throat was half-choked with fur, and by that time  the other puppies butted in, each snatching a hold where it could,  and tugging valorously. Then it was that the Master arrived,  attracted by the noise of the youngsters' yapping, and the pups saw  no more of their victim.    [Illustration]    But this brought a new interest into Finn's life, and much of his  time now was spent in the neighbourhood of the rabbit earths. Many  glorious runs Finn had after venturesome rabbits in that corner of  the orchard, but he was not fleet enough as yet to catch them, and  possibly his jaws could hardly have managed the killing in any  case. But even so, he experienced great joy in the matter of  stalking, hunting, and lying in wait.    On a glorious mellow afternoon in September, when the four pups,  captained as usual by Finn, were having great fun with a hammock  chair, from which they had managed to tear the canvas, they looked  up suddenly, and not without some sense of shame, to see three  people strolling into the orchard from the garden with Tara. There  was the Master and the Mistress of the Kennels and a stately,  white-haired lady, who fondled Tara's beautiful head as she walked.  Tara was walking with great care and delicacy to make the fondling  easy. She had no idea who the lady might be, but yet remembered  having met her before upon more than one occasion. This was the  lady from Yorkshire who had been the generous means of restoring  Tara to the Master. She was staying now in Sussex for a few days,  and had been asked to come to the little house beside the downs to  see Tara's children. Tara was perfectly aware that this was the  object of the walk in the orchard, and, though she may have  forgotten that these puppies were her own offspring, she certainly  had a distinctly proprietary feeling where they were concerned, as  one could see from the modest, deprecatory expression on her face  when the youngsters came gambolling about her, and were duly  admired by the visitor.    \"You have not disposed of any of them yet, then?\" said the lady to  the Master. \"Oh, no; I should not have thought of doing that until  you had an opportunity of making your choice,\" he replied.    \"I? Oh, but, really, I--I----\"    The lady from Yorkshire paused. For one thing she was not quite  sure whether the Master meant that he wished her to buy one of the  puppies, or whether he wanted to give one of them to her. She was a  wealthy lady, so that the monetary aspect of it did not exercise  her mind much, but she would not for the world have hurt the  Master's feelings.    \"But I am quite sure you will not deny me the real pleasure of  giving you one of Tara's children,\" said the Master. \"That is a  small return for your gift of Tara herself; but I should like to  think of your having one of this family, and it would make me  unhappy if you were to deny me the opportunity of giving you your  real choice. That was why I asked you to come to-day. It is Tara's  thank-offering, and I can assure you she has excelled herself in  the making of it.\"    The three were seated now, so that they might observe and admire  the family at leisure.    \"Yes, she really has excelled herself. That grey dog there is Finn."]]]
