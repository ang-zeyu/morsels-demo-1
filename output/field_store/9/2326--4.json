E., ii. 5.    (2) Ibid., 6,19.      As Eusebius, like Clemens of Alexandria, Arnobius, and the other early  Christian disputants, had no prejudice in favour of Hellenic mythology,  and no sentimental reason for wishing to suppose that the origin of  its impurities was pure, he found his way almost to the theory of the  irrational element in mythology which we propose to offer.    Even to sketch the history of mythological hypothesis in modern times  would require a book to itself. It must suffice here to indicate the  various lines which speculation as to mythology has pursued.    All interpretations of myth have been formed in accordance with the  ideas prevalent in the time of the interpreters. The early Greek  physicists thought that mythopoeic men had been physicists. Aristotle  hints that they were (like himself) political philosophers.(1)  Neo-platonists sought in the myths for Neo-platonism; most Christians  (unlike Eusebius) either sided with Euhemerus, or found in myth the  inventions of devils, or a tarnished and distorted memory of the  Biblical revelation.      (1) Met., xi. 8,19.      This was the theory, for example, of good old Jacob Bryant, who saw  everywhere memories of the Noachian deluge and proofs of the correctness  of Old Testament ethnology.(1)      (1) Bryant, A New System, wherein an Attempt is made to Divest Tradition  of Fable, 1774.      Much the same attempt to find the Biblical truth at the bottom of savage  and ancient fable has been recently made by the late M. Lenormant, a  Catholic scholar.(1)      (1) Les Origines de l'Histoire d'apres le Bible, 1880-1884.      In the beginning of the present century Germany turned her attention to  mythology. As usual, men's ideas were biassed by the general nature of  their opinions. In a pious kind of spirit, Friedrich Creuzer sought to  find SYMBOLS of some pure, early, and Oriental theosophy in the myths  and mysteries of Greece. Certainly the Greeks of the philosophical  period explained their own myths as symbols of higher things, but  the explanation was an after-thought.(1) The great Lobeck, in his  Aglaophamus (1829), brought back common sense, and made it the guide of  his vast, his unequalled learning. In a gentler and more genial  spirit, C. Otfried Muller laid the foundation of a truly scientific  and historical mythology.(2) Neither of these writers had, like Alfred  Maury,(3) much knowledge of the myths and faiths of the lower races, but  they often seem on the point of anticipating the ethnological method.      (1) Creuzer, Symbolik und Mythologie, 2d edit., Leipzig, 1836-43.    (2) Introduction to a Scientific System of Mythology, English trans.,  London, 1844.    (3) Histoire des Religions de la Grece Antique, Paris, 1857.      When philological science in our own century came to maturity, in  philology, as of old in physics and later in symbols, was sought the  key of myths. While physical allegory, religious and esoteric symbolism,  verbal confusion, historical legend, and an original divine tradition,  perverted in ages of darkness, have been the most popular keys in other  ages, the scientific nineteenth century has had a philological key  of its own. The methods of Kuhn, Breal, Max Muller, and generally the  philological method, cannot be examined here at full length.(1) Briefly  speaking, the modern philological method is intended for a scientific  application of the old etymological interpretations. Cadmus in the  Bacchae of Euripides, Socrates in the Cratylus of Plato, dismiss  unpalatable myths as the results of verbal confusion. People had  originally said something quite sensible--so the hypothesis runs--but  when their descendants forgot the meaning of their remarks, a new and  absurd meaning followed from a series of unconscious puns.(2) This view  was supported in ancient times by purely conjectural and impossible  etymologies. Thus the myth that Dionysus was sewn up in the THIGH of  Zeus (Greek text omitted) was explained by Euripides as the result of a  confusion of words. People had originally said that Zeus gave a pledge  (Greek text omitted) to Hera. The modern philological school relies for  explanations of untoward and other myths on similar confusions. Thus  Daphne is said to have been originally not a girl of romance, but the  dawn (Sanskirt, dahana: ahana) pursued by the rising sun. But as the  original Aryan sense of Dahana or Ahana was lost, and as Daphne came to  mean the laurel--the wood which burns easily--the fable arose that the  tree had been a girl called Daphne.(3)      (1) See Mythology in Encyclop. Brit. and in La Mythologie (A. L.),  Paris, 1886, where Mr. Max Muller's system is criticised. See also  Custom and Myth and Modern Mythology.    (2) That a considerable number of myths, chiefly myths of place names,  arise from popular etymologies is certain: what is objected to is the  vast proportion given to this element in myths.    (3) Max Muller, Nineteenth Century, December, 1885; \"Solar Myths,\"  January, 1886; Myths and Mythologists (A. L). Whitney, Mannhardt,  Bergaigne, and others dispute the etymology. Or. and Ling. Studies,  1874, p. 160; Mannhardt, Antike Wald und Feld Kultus (Berlin, 1877), p.  xx.; Bergaigne, La Religion Vedique, iii. 293; nor does Curtius like it  much, Principles of Greek Etymology, English trans., ii. 92, 93; Modern  Mythology (A. L.), 1897.      This system chiefly rests on comparison between the Sanskrit names in  the Rig-Veda and the mythic names in Greek, German, Slavonic, and other  Aryan legends. The attempt is made to prove that, in the common speech  of the undivided Aryan race, many words for splendid or glowing natural  phenomena existed, and that natural processes were described in a  figurative style. As the various Aryan families separated, the sense of  the old words and names became dim, the nomina developed into numina,  the names into gods, the descriptions of elemental processes into myths.  As this system has already been criticised by us elsewhere with minute  attention, a reference to these reviews must suffice in this place.  Briefly, it may be stated that the various masters of the school--Kuhn,  Max Muller, Roth, Schwartz, and the rest--rarely agree where agreement  is essential, that is, in the philological foundations of their  building. They differ in very many of the etymological analyses of  mythical names. They also differ in the interpretations they put on the  names, Kuhn almost invariably seeing fire, storm, cloud, or lightning  where Mr. Max Muller sees the chaste Dawn. Thus Mannhardt, after having  been a disciple, is obliged to say that comparative Indo-Germanic  mythology has not borne the fruit expected, and that \"the CERTAIN gains  of the system reduce themselves to the scantiest list of parallels,  such as Dyaus = Zeus = Tius, Parjanya = Perkunas, Bhaga = Bog, Varuna =  Uranos\" (a position much disputed), etc. Mannhardt adds his belief that  a number of other \"equations\"--such as Sarameya = Hermeias, Saranyus =  Demeter Erinnys, Kentauros = Gandharva, and many others--will not stand  criticism, and he fears that these ingenious guesses will prove  mere jeux d'esprit rather than actual facts.(1) Many examples of the  precarious and contradictory character of the results of philological  mythology, many instances of \"dubious etymologies,\" false logic, leaps  at foregone conclusions, and attempts to make what is peculiarly Indian  in thought into matter of universal application, will meet us in the  chapters on Indian and Greek divine legends.(2) \"The method in its  practical working shows a fundamental lack of the historical sense,\"  says Mannhardt. Examples are torn from their contexts, he observes;  historical evolution is neglected; passages of the Veda, themselves  totally obscure, are dragged forward to account for obscure Greek  mythical phenomena. Such are the accusations brought by the regretted  Mannhardt against the school to which he originally belonged, and  which was popular and all-powerful even in the maturity of his own more  clear-sighted genius. Proofs of the correctness of his criticism will  be offered abundantly in the course of this work. It will become evident  that, great as are the acquisitions of Philology, her least certain  discoveries have been too hastily applied in alien \"matter,\" that is, in  the region of myth. Not that philology is wholly without place or part  in the investigation of myth, when there is agreement among philologists  as to the meaning of a divine name. In that case a certain amount of  light is thrown on the legend of the bearer of the name, and on its  origin and first home, Aryan, Greek, Semitic, or the like. But how rare  is agreement among philologists!      (1) Baum und Feld Kultus, p. xvii. Kuhn's \"epoch-making\" book is Die  Herabkunft des Feuers, Berlin, 1859. By way of example of the disputes  as to the original meaning of a name like Prometheus, compare Memoires  de la Societe de Linguistique de Paris, t. iv. p. 336.    (2) See especially Mannhardt's note on Kuhn's theories of Poseidon and  Hermes, B. u. F. K., pp. xviii., xix., note 1.      \"The philological method,\" says Professor Tiele,(1) \"is inadequate and  misleading, when it is a question of discovering the ORIGIN of a myth,  or the physical explanation of the oldest myths, or of accounting for  the rude and obscene element in the divine legends of civilised races.  But these are not the only problems of mythology. There is, for example,  the question of the GENEALOGICAL relations of myths, where we have  to determine whether the myths of peoples whose speech is of the same  family are special modifications of a mythology once common to the race  whence these peoples have sprung. The philological method alone can  answer here.\" But this will seem a very limited province when we find  that almost all races,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2833"],[0,"The Portrait of a Lady — Volume 1 (#10)"],[1,"not come in she prepared to take her  departure.    \"Your sister must be a great gossip. Is she accustomed to staying out so  many hours?\"    \"You've been out almost as long as she,\" Isabel replied; \"she can have  left the house but a short time before you came in.\"    Mrs. Touchett looked at the girl without resentment; she appeared to  enjoy a bold retort and to be disposed to be gracious. \"Perhaps she  hasn't had so good an excuse as I. Tell her at any rate that she must  come and see me this evening at that horrid hotel. She may bring her  husband if she likes, but she needn't bring you. I shall see plenty of  you later.\"        CHAPTER IV    Mrs. Ludlow was the eldest of the three sisters, and was usually thought  the most sensible; the classification being in general that Lilian  was the practical one, Edith the beauty and Isabel the \"intellectual\"  superior. Mrs. Keyes, the second of the group, was the wife of an  officer of the United States Engineers, and as our history is not  further concerned with her it will suffice that she was indeed very  pretty and that she formed the ornament of those various military  stations, chiefly in the unfashionable West, to which, to her deep  chagrin, her husband was successively relegated. Lilian had married a  New York lawyer, a young man with a loud voice and an enthusiasm for  his profession; the match was not brilliant, any more than Edith's, but  Lilian had occasionally been spoken of as a young woman who might be  thankful to marry at all--she was so much plainer than her sisters.  She was, however, very happy, and now, as the mother of two peremptory  little boys and the mistress of a wedge of brown stone violently driven  into Fifty-third Street, seemed to exult in her condition as in a bold  escape. She was short and solid, and her claim to figure was questioned,  but she was conceded presence, though not majesty; she had moreover, as  people said, improved since her marriage, and the two things in life  of which she was most distinctly conscious were her husband's force in  argument and her sister Isabel's originality. \"I've never kept up with  Isabel--it would have taken all my time,\" she had often remarked;  in spite of which, however, she held her rather wistfully in sight;  watching her as a motherly spaniel might watch a free greyhound. \"I want  to see her safely married--that's what I want to see,\" she frequently  noted to her husband.    \"Well, I must say I should have no particular desire to marry her,\"  Edmund Ludlow was accustomed to answer in an extremely audible tone.    \"I know you say that for argument; you always take the opposite ground.  I don't see what you've against her except that she's so original.\"    \"Well, I don't like originals; I like translations,\" Mr. Ludlow had more  than once replied. \"Isabel's written in a foreign tongue. I can't make  her out. She ought to marry an Armenian or a Portuguese.\"    \"That's just what I'm afraid she'll do!\" cried Lilian, who thought  Isabel capable of anything.    She listened with great interest to the girl's account of Mrs.  Touchett's appearance and in the evening prepared to comply with their  aunt's commands. Of what Isabel then said no report has remained, but  her sister's words had doubtless prompted a word spoken to her husband  as the two were making ready for their visit. \"I do hope immensely  she'll do something handsome for Isabel; she has evidently taken a great  fancy to her.\"    \"What is it you wish her to do?\" Edmund Ludlow asked. \"Make her a big  present?\"    \"No indeed; nothing of the sort. But take an interest in her--sympathise  with her. She's evidently just the sort of person to appreciate her. She  has lived so much in foreign society; she told Isabel all about it. You  know you've always thought Isabel rather foreign.\"    \"You want her to give her a little foreign sympathy, eh? Don't you think  she gets enough at home?\"    \"Well, she ought to go abroad,\" said Mrs. Ludlow. \"She's just the person  to go abroad.\"    \"And you want the old lady to take her, is that it?\"    \"She has offered to take her--she's dying to have Isabel go. But what  I want her to do when she gets her there is to give her all the  advantages. I'm sure all we've got to do,\" said Mrs. Ludlow, \"is to give  her a chance.\"    \"A chance for what?\"    \"A chance to develop.\"    \"Oh Moses!\" Edmund Ludlow exclaimed. \"I hope she isn't going to develop  any more!\"    \"If I were not sure you only said that for argument I should feel very  badly,\" his wife replied. \"But you know you love her.\"    \"Do you know I love you?\" the young man said, jocosely, to Isabel a  little later, while he brushed his hat.    \"I'm sure I don't care whether you do or not!\" exclaimed the girl; whose  voice and smile, however, were less haughty than her words.    \"Oh, she feels so grand since Mrs. Touchett's visit,\" said her sister.    But Isabel challenged this assertion with a good deal of seriousness.  \"You must not say that, Lily. I don't feel grand at all.\"    \"I'm sure there's no harm,\" said the conciliatory Lily.    \"Ah, but there's nothing in Mrs. Touchett's visit to make one feel  grand.\"    \"Oh,\" exclaimed Ludlow, \"she's grander than ever!\"    \"Whenever I feel grand,\" said the girl, \"it will be for a better  reason.\"    Whether she felt grand or no, she at any rate felt different, as if  something had happened to her. Left to herself for the evening she sat  a while under the lamp, her hands empty, her usual avocations unheeded.  Then she rose and moved about the room, and from one room to another,  preferring the places where the vague lamplight expired. She was  restless and even agitated; at moments she trembled a little. The  importance of what had happened was out of proportion to its appearance;  there had really been a change in her life. What it would bring with it  was as yet extremely indefinite; but Isabel was in a situation that gave  a value to any change. She had a desire to leave the past behind her  and, as she said to herself, to begin afresh. This desire indeed was not  a birth of the present occasion; it was as familiar as the sound of the  rain upon the window and it had led to her beginning afresh a great many  times. She closed her eyes as she sat in one of the dusky corners of the  quiet parlour; but it was not with a desire for dozing forgetfulness. It  was on the contrary because she felt too wide-eyed and wished to check  the sense of seeing too many things at once. Her imagination was by  habit ridiculously active; when the door was not open it jumped out of  the window. She was not accustomed indeed to keep it behind bolts; and  at important moments, when she would have been thankful to make use  of her judgement alone, she paid the penalty of having given undue  encouragement to the faculty of seeing without judging. At present, with  her sense that the note of change had been struck, came gradually a host  of images of the things she was leaving behind her. The years and hours  of her life came back to her, and for a long time, in a stillness broken  only by the ticking of the big bronze clock, she passed them in  review. It had been a very happy life and she had been a very fortunate  person--this was the truth that seemed to emerge most vividly. She had  had the best of everything, and in a world in which the circumstances  of so many people made them unenviable it was an advantage never to have  known anything particularly unpleasant. It appeared to Isabel that the  unpleasant had been even too absent from her knowledge, for she had  gathered from her acquaintance with literature that it was often a  source of interest and even of instruction. Her father had kept it  away from her--her handsome, much loved father, who always had such  an aversion to it. It was a great felicity to have been his daughter;  Isabel rose even to pride in her parentage. Since his death she had  seemed to see him as turning his braver side to his children and as  not having managed to ignore the ugly quite so much in practice as in  aspiration. But this only made her tenderness for him greater; it  was scarcely even painful to have to suppose him too generous, too  good-natured, too indifferent to sordid considerations. Many persons  had held that he carried this indifference too far, especially the large  number of those to whom he owed money. Of their opinions Isabel was  never very definitely informed; but it may interest the reader to know  that, while they had recognised in the late Mr. Archer a remarkably  handsome head and a very taking manner (indeed, as one of them had said,  he was always taking something), they had declared that he was making a  very poor use of his life. He had squandered a substantial fortune, he  had been deplorably convivial, he was known to have gambled freely.  A few very harsh critics went so far as to say that he had not even  brought up his daughters. They had had no regular education and no  permanent home; they had been at once spoiled and neglected; they had  lived with nursemaids and governesses (usually very bad ones) or had  been sent to superficial schools, kept by the French, from which, at the  end of a month, they had been removed in tears. This view of the matter  would have excited Isabel's indignation, for to her own sense her  opportunities had been large. Even when her father had left his  daughters for three months at Neufchatel with a French bonne who had  eloped with a Russian nobleman staying at the same hotel--even in this  irregular situation (an incident of the girl's eleventh year) she had  been neither frightened nor ashamed, but had thought it a romantic  episode in a liberal education. Her father had a large way of looking at  life, of which his restlessness and even his occasional incoherency  of conduct had been only a proof. He wished his daughters, even as  children, to see as much of the world as possible; and it was for this  purpose that, before "]]]
