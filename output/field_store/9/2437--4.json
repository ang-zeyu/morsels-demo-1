The sinker is  supposed to go bumping along the bottom, while the bait follows three or  four feet above it. The drag of the line and the constant joggling of  the sinker on rocks and snags, make it difficult to tell when one has a  strike--and it is always too long between bites.    Sitting for hours at a baited buoy with a hand-line, and without taking  a fish, is still worse, as more than once I have been compelled to  acknowledge in very weariness of soul. There are enthusiastic anglers,  however, whose specialty is trolling for lake trout. A gentleman by the  name of Thatcher, who has a fine residence on Raquette Lake--which he  calls a camp--makes this his leading sport, and keeps a log of his  fishing, putting nothing on record of less than ten pounds weight. His  largest fish was booked at twenty-eight pounds, and he added that a  well-conditioned salmon trout was superior to a brook trout on the  table; in which I quite agree with him. But he seemed quite disgusted  when I ventured to suggest that a well-conditioned cattie or bullhead,  caught in the same waters--was better than either.    \"Do you call the cattie a game fish?\" he asked.    Yes; I call any fish a game fish that is taken for sport with hook and  line. I can no more explain the common prejudice against the catfish and  eel than I can tell why an experienced angler should drag a gang of  thirteen hooks through the water--ten of them being worse than  superfluous. \"Frank Forester\" gives five hooks as the number for a  trolling gang. We mostly use hooks too small, and do not look after  points and barbs closely enough. A pair of No. 1 O'Shaughnessy, or 1-1/2  Sproat, or five tapered blackfish hooks, will make a killing rig for  small-mouthed bass using No. 4 Sproat for lip hook. Larger hooks are  better for the big-mouthed, a four-pound specimen of which will easily  take in one's fist. A pair of 5-0 O'Shaughnessy's, or Sproat's will be  found none too large; and as for the mascalonge and pickerel, if I must  err, let it be on the side of large hooks and strong lines.    [Sidenote: Stout Tackle]    It is idle to talk of playing the fish in water where the giving of a  few yards insures a hopeless tangle among roots, tree-tops, etc. I was  once fishing in Western waters where the pickerel ran very large, and I  used a pair of the largest salmon hooks with tackle strong enough to  hold a fish of fifteen pounds, without any playing; notwithstanding  which, I had five trains of three hooks each taken off in as many days  by monster pickerel. An expert mascalonge fisherman--Davis by  name--happened to take board at the farm house where I was staying, and  he had a notion that he could \"beat some of them big fellows;\" and he  did it; with three large cod hooks, a bit of fine, strong chain, twelve  yards of cod-line, an eighteen-foot tamarack pole, and a twelve inch  sucker for bait. I thought it the most outlandish rig I had ever seen,  but went with him in the early gray of the morning to see it tried, just  where I had lost my hooks and fish.    Raising the heavy bait in the air, he would give it a whirl to gather  headway, and launch it forty feet away with a splash that might have  been heard thirty rods. It looked more likely to scare than catch, but  was a success. At the third or fourth cast we plainly saw a huge  pickerel rise, shut his immense mouth over bait, hooks, and a few inches  of chain, turn lazily, and head for the bottom, where Mr. D. let him  rest a minute, and then struck steadily but strongly. The subsequent  struggle depended largely on main strength, though there was a good deal  of skill and cool judgment shown in the handling and landing of the  fish. A pickerel of forty pounds or more is not to be snatched out of  the water on his first mad rush; something must be yielded--and with no  reel there is little chance of giving line. It struck me my friend  managed his fish remarkably well, towing him back and forth with a  strong pull, never giving him a rest and finally sliding him out on a  low muddy bank, as though he were a smooth log. We took him up to the  house and tested the size of his mouth by putting a quart cup in it,  which went in easily. Then we weighed him, and he turned the scales at  forty-four pounds. It was some consolation to find three of my hooks  sticking in his mouth. Lastly, we had a large section of him stuffed and  baked. It was good; but a ten-pound fish would have been better. The  moral of all this--if it has any moral--is, use hooks according to the  size of fish you expect to catch.    And, when you are in a permanent camp, and fishing is very poor, try  frogging. It is not a sport of a high order, though it may be called  angling--and it can be made amusing, with hook and line. I have seen  educated ladies in the wilderness, fishing for frogs with an eagerness  and enthusiasm not surpassed by the most devoted angler with his  favorite cast of flies.    There are several modes of taking the festive batrachian. He is speared  with a frog-spear; caught under the chin with snatch-hooks; taken with  hook and line, or picked up from a canoe with the aid of a headlight,  or jack-lamp. The two latter modes are best.    To take him with hook and line: a light rod, six to eight feet of line,  a snell of single gut with a 1-0 Sproat or O'Shaughnessy hook, and a bit  of bright scarlet flannel for bait; this is the rig. To use it, paddle  up behind him silently, and drop the rag just in front of his nose. He  is pretty certain to take it on the instant. Knock him on the head  before cutting off his legs. It is unpleasant to see him squirm, and  hear him cry like a child while you are sawing at his thigh joints.    By far the most effective manner of frogging is by the headlight on dark  nights. To do this most successfully, one man in a light canoe, a good  headlight and a light, one-handed paddle, are the requirements. The frog  is easily located, either by his croaking, or by his peculiar shape.  Paddle up to him silently and throw the light in his eyes; you may then  pick him up as you would a potato. I have known a North Woods guide to  pick up a five-quart pail of frogs in an hour, on a dark evening. On the  table, frogs' legs are usually conceded first place for delicacy and  flavor. For an appetizing breakfast in camp, they have no equal, in my  judgment. The high price they bring at the best hotels, and their  growing scarcity, attest the value placed on them by men who know how  and what to eat. And, not many years ago, an old pork-gobbling  backwoodsman threw his frying-pan into the river because I had cooked  frogs' legs in it. While another, equally intelligent, refused to use my  frying-pan, because I had cooked eels in it; remarking sententiously,  \"Eels is snakes, an' I know it.\"    It may be well, just here and now, to say a word on the importance of  the headlight. I know of no more pleasant and satisfactory adjunct of a  camp than a good light that can be adjusted to the head, used as a jack  in floating, carried in the hand, or fastened up inside the shanty. Once  fairly tried, it will never be ignored or forgotten. Not that it will  show a deer's head seventeen rods distant with sufficient clearness for  a shot--or your sights with distinctness enough to make it. (See  Murray's _Adirondacks_, page 174.)    A headlight that will show a deer plainly at six rods, while lighting  the sights of a rifle with clearness, is an exceptionally good light.  More deer are killed in floating under than over four rods. There are  various styles of headlights, jack-lamps, etc., in use. They are bright,  easily adjusted, and will show rifle sights, or a deer, up to 100  feet--which is enough. They are also convenient in camp, and better than  a lantern on a dim forest path.    Before leaving the subject of bait-fishing, I have a point or two I wish  to make. I have attempted to explain the frog-bait, and the manner of  using it, and I shall probably never have occasion to change my belief  that it is, on the whole, the most killing lure for the entire tribes of  bass and pickerel. There is however, another, which, if properly  handled, is almost as good. It is as follows:    Take a bass, pickerel, or yellow perch, of one pound or less; scrape the  scales clean on the under side from the caudal fin to a point just  forward of the vent.    [Sidenote: Swivels and Snells]    Next, with a sharp knife, cut up toward the backbone, commencing just  behind the vent with a slant toward the tail. Run the knife smoothly  along just under the backbone, and out through the caudal fin, taking  about one-third of the latter, and making a clean, white bait, with the  anal and part of the caudal by way of fins. It looks very like a white  minnow in the water; but is better, in that it is more showy, and  infinitely tougher. A minnow soon drags to pieces. To use it, two strong  hooks are tied on a wire snell at right angles, the upper one an inch  above the lower, and the upper hook is passed through the bait, leaving  it to draw without turning or spinning. The casting and handling is the  same as with the frog-bait, and is very killing for bass, pickerel, and  mascalonge. It is a good lure for salmon trout also; but, for him it was  found better to fasten the bait with the lower hook in a way to give it  a spinning motion; and this necessitates the use of a swivel, which I do  not like; because, \"a rope is as strong as its weakest part\"; and I have  more than once found that weakest part the swivel. If, however, a swivel  has been tested by a dead lift of twenty to twenty-five pounds, it will  do to trust.    I have spoken only of brass or copper wire for snells, and for pickerel  or mascalonge of large size nothing else is to be depended on. But for  trout and bass,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34617"],[0,"The Jews of Barnow: Stories (#10)"],[1," housekeeper gets up to see what is the matter, and to  call the man-servant. As she passes her master's room, she notices a  light under the door, and, on hearing the sound of her footsteps, old  Moses comes out. He is still dressed; he has evidently not yet gone to  bed, although it is nearly two o'clock in the morning. He looks  thoroughly worn-out.    \"Go back to bed,\" he says to the old woman; \"I will go myself and see if  anything is wrong.\"    At the same moment the dog again barks furiously, and then all at once  begins to whine and utter short barks of joy. They hear the huge  creature jumping about and scratching at the outer door. He has  evidently recognized the person who has come up to the house, and is  trying to get to him.    The old man turns as pale as death. \"Who can it be?\" he murmurs. Then he  proceeds with tottering steps toward the entrance-hall. The housekeeper  prepares to follow him, but he exclaims \"Go away\" so passionately, that  she draws back. He takes no candle with him, for it is the Sabbath; so  he feels his way to the house-door.    The old woman stands and listens. She hears the dog spring forward to  meet his master, and then run with joyous whines toward the outer door.    Then she hears Moses ask, \"Who is there?\"    All is still. The dog alone utters a short bark.    Moses repeats his question.    An answer comes from without. The housekeeper can not hear what it is.  It sounds to her like a cry of pain.    But the old man must have understood. He opens the heavy outer door,  steps out, and shuts it behind him. The dog has apparently slipped out  at the same time as his master, for the housekeeper can hear the stifled  sound of his bark.    Then Moses's voice becomes audible; he speaks very loudly and  passionately. What he says sounds at first like scolding, and then like  a solemn curse or conjuration. But the old woman can not hear the  words.... No mortal ear hears the words that Moses Freudenthal addresses  to the person who had knocked at his door that dismal night.    After a minute of suspense, the housekeeper hears the outer door creak.  Moses is coming back. He returns alone. The dog has remained outside.    There is a moment's silence; and then the housekeeper hears a heavy  fall.    She seizes the candle--what does she care in her terror about the old  pious custom?--and hastens to the door. There lies Moses Freudenthal,  motionless and pale as death. She raises his head; he breathes  stertorously.    On perceiving this, the old woman utters a loud shriek. The man-servant  and shopman, wakened by her cry, hasten to the spot. They lifted their  master, and, carrying him to his room, put him to bed. Then one of them  goes for the doctor of the district, who lives close by on the first  floor. He bleeds the sick man, but shakes his head as he does so. The  old man has had a stroke.    The housekeeper weeps, the men stand about the room awkwardly, not  knowing whether to go or stay, and the doctor attends to his patient.    Thus the hours pass slowly, and the morning comes. No one remembers the  stranger who had knocked at the door in the night.    Early in the morning a loud knocking is heard at the door. The  night-watchman stands without, accompanied by several people who have  come in early to the market. They have found a poorly-dressed,  half-starved-looking young woman lying dead at the door. Black Britan is  lying beside the corpse, whining, and licking its hands. When any one  tries to approach, he growls and shows his teeth.    The doctor goes on and bends over the dead woman. He lays his hand on  her heart; it has ceased to beat. He then looks at the pale, worn face,  and recognizes it at once.    He rises sadly, and orders the corpse to be taken to the dead-house. He  then returns to the sick man, who still lies senseless.    Next day they bury Esther Freudenthal. No one knows what her religion  had been--whether she had remained a Jewess, or had become a Christian.  Not even her uncle Schlome, who cowers down by her bier in a stupor of  grief. So they bury her where suicides are laid; and yet she had died of  starvation.    A packet of letters is found in her pocket. They are all written in the  same hand, and bear the same superscription--Geza. The last of these  letters, which is stamped with the post-mark of a small Hungarian town,  contains the following lines: \"I tell you honestly that I am tired of  the whole thing. I am now with my regiment, and advise you not to  attempt to follow me. My sergeant, Koloman, has promised to marry you.  He likes you. If you don't like him, you had better go home.\"    She did go home.    Old Moses does not die in consequence of the occurrences of that night.  He lives on for a long time; he outlives his brother-in-law, and many  happy people. He lives a gloomy, solitary, mysterious life. When he  dies, the only people who weep for him are the mourning-women who have  been hired for the purpose. He leaves his great fortune to the  wonder-working Rabbi of Sadagora, the most jealous opponent of light,  the most fanatical supporter of the old dark faith.    This is the story of Moses Freudenthal, whom they called the \"Shylock of  Barnow.\"          CHANE.    (1873.)      Many years have passed since poor Esther Freudenthal died at her  father's feet. Moses has also been dead for a long time. The large white  house opposite the Dominican monastery, which now belongs to the Rabbi  of Sadagora, looks quite as grand and well cared for as when it was  owned by the stern, unhappy old man. An oval plate now hangs above the  door, on which a black eagle is painted on a yellow shield, and round  the edge are the words, \"Royal and Imperial District Court.\" Petty  thieves, Polish rebels, and Jewish usurers are brought to trial where  Moses and his daughter had lived and suffered. These public offices  occupy the ground-floor on the right of the entrance-door. The shop  formerly kept by old Moses still remains on the left hand, but another  name is now painted above the door--\"Nathan Silberstein, Grocer and  Wine-Merchant.\" Two words of the inscription were wrongly spelt; but  that was the fault of humpbacked little Janko, who painted the sign.    The new owner has made no changes on the first floor, which is still let  to the doctor and district judge. The district judge is, however,  different from the one Moses Freudenthal knew. Herr Julko von Negrusz  has succeeded Herr Hippolyt Lozinski, with the yellow face and  attenuated figure. He differs from his predecessor in every respect.  Herr Lozinski considered the Jews his prey, rich and poor alike; and  what he extorted from them he gave to poor Christians--such as the  nobles, officials, and officers. His wife, Kasimira, who came of the  noble family of Cybulski--which name in English means Onion--was  celebrated for five German miles around Barnow for three  peculiarities--her debts, her brilliant toilets, and her love of  dancing. She deceived her husband so openly, that people wondered how he  could continue to cock his hat so jauntily on his long yellow head.    But all this is changed.    Herr von Negrusz extorts nothing from the Jews, nor does he give great  feasts to the Christians. He lives entirely in his office, and for his  lovely young wife and two pretty boys. His wife is very beautiful. Her  figure is straight and slender, and though her carriage is proud, she is  extremely graceful. Her features are finely cut, and her dreamy dark  eyes are unfathomably deep. But her most striking beauty is her rich  olive complexion. Her appearance conjures up Zuleima and Zuleika, and  the enchanted beauties of the East; but it must be observed that the  district judge's wife wears a cross upon a chain round her throat, and  that she has printed upon her calling-cards, \"Christine von Negrusz.\"    Strange to say, these cards form her sole connection with other people.  She has no visitors, and she visits no one. Between her and the world of  Barnow there is a limit of acquaintance, past which neither she nor  they try to step.    If some public functionary sent to Barnow happens to be a married man,  he is carefully instructed by his colleagues to borrow the old carriage  and horses of old Herr von Wolanski, and drive with his wife to the  large white house. Arrived there, he is to send in cards, and is warned  that the customary answer received on such occasions is, that the  district judge is not at home, and that _gnaedige Frau_ is not well. In  the course of a week Herr von Negrusz and his wife drive in the same  carriage to return the visit, and the ceremony is acted over again with  the parts reversed. All intercourse then ceases between the two  families. This custom is invariable.    Another curious circumstance is, that Frau von Negrusz never goes out of  the house alone. Once or twice a week she takes a walk with her husband.  The inhabitants of Barnow are accustomed to walk in the new park  surrounding the castle of Graefin Jadwiga Bortynska, _nee_ Polanska.  Unlike other people, the district judge and his wife always take their  constitutional in the deserted garden by the river-side, and close to  the old castle. The direct road to these pleasure-grounds is through the  Jews' quarter; but this unsociable pair avoid the nearest way, and  choose rather to go all round the outskirts of the town. One might have  supposed their reason to have been that they wished to escape the dust  and bad odors of the Ghetto; but this hardly accounts for it, as when  once caught in a storm, they made the same long round in the pouring  rain.    Herr von Negrusz looks everybody pluckily in the face, and never avoids  meeting his friends; why should his wife be so unsociable, and what  proscription separates her from the rest of the world?    You have only to ask the gossip and newsmonger of Barnow--the  magnificent Frau Emilie, wife of the new registrar. Her husband has  lived ten"]]]
