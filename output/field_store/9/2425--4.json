CHAPTER XIII.    EXPERIENCED TRAPPERS' WAYS.    At first when I started to trap I thought I could catch mink every  time, says an Iowa trapper. That was three years ago this last  February. Well I caught two mink that spring and seven the next  winter and sixteen the next. That was the first season that I was  able to catch every mink that trots or lopes my way, big, little, old  and young are treated all alike; sometimes it takes a mink three or  four days to come out of a hole when you track him in.    A water set is a pretty good set for mink but you cannot find many  springs that you can set a trap in the winter time, so I set dry sets  for them. At a hole is a good place. Put a piece of muskrat carcass  in the hole to keep the rabbits from going in and set a Blake & Lamb  trap in the entrance. Chop a hole in the frozen ground large enough  for the trap and cover it with tissue paper and thinly with dry dirt.  Be sure to put some dry material of some sort under the trap to keep  it from freezing down, have the surface of the ground level after it  is covered over with dry dirt so you cannot tell just exactly where  the trap is yourself, or in other words don't have a high place where  the trap is when it is covered over. Fasten the trap to a drag of  some sort. If you fasten to something solid the mink will pull out if  he is only caught by the toes.    I caught two mink one winter that only had three legs. They were the  ones that pulled out of my traps because I had the trap fastened too  solid. One mink I caught was only caught by one toe and was tied to a  little brush drag; when I tracked him up I found that he had gone  about ten rods. When I got in sight of him he got stout and pulled  out and started off at a pretty stiff gait, and I had to let the dog  catch him for he was geared up too high for me to catch.    Trappers, have you not had your mink trap set and baited under a  shelving bank and seen mink tracks going up and down by the bait and  they would not touch it? Get some sticks and stick them from bank  down into water that is five or six inches deep, is the advice of a  Maine trapper. Leave a place for trap up next to bank where he  travels and cover nicely with fine rotten wood, and you will get more  mink setting this way than you will with all the bait you bother  with, that is, if you pick out such places along the brook and stick  up sticks close enough so he cannot get by without going over trap.      [Illustration: EASTERN TRAPPER AND TRAPS.]    I don't mean to say that bait isn't good, because I have caught a  good many with bait, and there are lots of times when I can't find  such a place and of course use bait and scent. Some say mink are  afraid of human scent and set the trap with gloves, and that they are  foxy and hard to catch. I don't think a mink knows any more than a  skunk, and I can catch them just as easy. Last winter I went to my  trap one morning and found two toes of a mink in one and one toe in  another, and inside of a week I had both of them in the same trap and  in the same place.    Mink are not very plentiful in some places which makes some people  think they are hard to catch, and others don't know how to set a trap  right for mink.    The first requisite in trapping mink is water, either a lake or  river, says a Minnesota trapper. Small streams are to be preferred,  and the swifter the current the better. Why? Because swiftly running  water does not freeze so quickly, a fact every boy knows.    Next, select a spot on the shore where the bank is steep, ascending  directly up from the water, and place your trap (a No. 1 or 1 1/2 of  any good make) in about two inches of water and about six inches from  the bank, and fasten trap by driving a stake full length of chain out  in the water. Many trappers advocate the use of both bait and sliding  pole or spring pole, but personally I do not care for either, unless  there is danger of trap lifters \"swiping\" your game; in such cases  the sliding pole is the best, as it is more humane and game is  entirely concealed. If the bank is not too high set your trap from  the top and place in position with a stick, for by so doing you do  not make any muss around the trap.    Now let me caution young trappers about setting too many traps for  one mink. One trap well set is better than a dozen just slung in or  even well set and carefully concealed. It is not necessary to have  four or five traps within a radius of six feet as young trappers  often do. I discovered a case of this kind once.    For two weeks once I was after a sly representative of the mink  family but without success. Every trick in my command was tried  without success, but one morning I determined to try for him up a  small spring creek, where he was in the habit of going. I hesitated  about putting my traps on this creek. I had hesitated about putting  my traps on this creek as the owner usually lifted all traps found  there. As there was no snow there except small patches I was not  aware of another trapper's work on this brook, but a few drops of  blood on a patch of snow caused me to open my eyes, and I was not  long in discovering his traps. A blind man could have done that for  they were literally thrown in, some almost upside down and others  with the spring half out of the water.    I followed his line for about twenty rods, and then discovered the  place of capture. Six traps were set in as many holes, and all in a  radius of five feet, but they had done the business. Was I mad? I  shall leave it to the reader to guess. Boys, let me tell you this  capture was an accident and not the result of skill.    I have endeavored to explain as simply as possible one set for mink,  but this method will not answer all winter, for all the streams will  freeze during extreme cold weather. On nearly all lakes and rivers  springs can be found, and here is the place for your traps in cold  weather. Common sense will show you the most suitable spot for the  set. All minks have a weakness for wading in such springs, and a trap  carefully placed and concealed will get a mink if there are any in  the vicinity.    It was early in the fall of 1901 and I was working on the farm. I one  day saw signs of mink under a bridge near home so I had a friend who  was working for us set two traps for him that day, writes another  party from Minnesota. I set the traps a few inches under water,  covered them with wet leaves, thinking, \"I will have you tomorrow.\"  Well, the next morning we came along but no mink, so in the afternoon  we looked at them again and Mr. Mink got in one trap, pulled it in  between two logs, and the other trap was sprung. I then pulled on the  other chain and the mink was in the trap. I pulled and all at once  his foot slipped out. This taught Mr. Mink a lesson.    I set my traps again, and after this he sprung traps about as fast as  I could reset them. So I set six more traps and got some ten and  twelve inches under water. I used to reset the traps before I went to  dinner, and after dinner he had every one sprung and the water looked  very muddy. I laid for him but never did see him. I trapped for that  mink every year until 1904. I saw his tracks on the snow so I got out  some snow sets and one January morning I found him dead in the trap.  He was a large dark mink and had lost all his toes by traps.    A good place to catch mink is at the mouth of a spring. Get your  traps well under water and cover up with wet leaves, as a mink  usually goes up such a small stream. I will say to the beginner,  never get cheap traps, as they are the dearest in the end. Never  catch fur until it is prime.    I find no difficulty in catching mink if they are plenty, but thin  them down to one or two well educated animals and your task is  different, says an Ohio trapper. Where plenty I set in riffles,  building stone walls or staking across not too high, a foot is  plenty, leaving one or more openings, according to width. Place a  trap (No. 1 or 1 1/2 Newhouse is best) in each opening. I invariably  stake at such places for if attached to shunks, bushes or small logs,  the trap is liable to float away in sudden rising of high water.  Place a trap at mouth of tiles, ditches or drains, staking well out  from trap.      [Illustration: BARRICADE SET.]    I have caught a great many mink along where the over-hanging sod had  curled down, leaving a space between sod and bank sometimes of a good  length. This is a capital place to catch mink, as every one that goes  up and down that side will almost always go through. All trappers  know mink are very inquisitive about such places, and if the place is  formed in summer or early fall they will already have used it as a  runway. After finding such a place, put a trap at one or both ends of  hole. Set trap level and cover well but not too deep, and I am sure  if there are any mink traveling the stream you will stand a fair show  of getting them. I have caught two mink at such places, one in each  trap in the same night, more than once.    An old hollow log is also a good place for mink with a trap at each  end. You will notice when there is a light shift of snow that mink  cross old logs, limbs, boards and dams that are across streams. Put  your trap in the center of crossing place, as you cannot tell where  he will get on or off at. Always cover traps when not setting in  water. Old hollow stumps, trees, openings in fences, stone walls, or  flood-gates, drifts and the like are good places to set traps for  mink; path openings in brush, in fact anywhere you see signs of their  travels, as they most generally have a route which they follow more  or less. I have followed them across country from the headwaters of  one stream to another, to swamp and swales where the muskrat abounds,  turning every \"hole inside out,\" so to speak, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34098"],[0,"Science of Trapping (#10)"],[1," be frightened and you will have a hard time to get  them.    In the spring, after the ice has gone, it is a good plan to set a few  traps along the stream, baiting with beaver castor, as the beavers  are traveling at this time, and you are likely to catch one almost  anywhere along the streams. When setting traps in this way, it is  best to drench the set with water to remove the human scent. The  beaver is seldom afraid of human scent, but there is likely to be an  otter along that way, and you stand a good chance of catching him in  a trap baited with beaver castor.    Beavers may be caught in mid-winter and early spring, by setting  baited traps under the ice. It is not much use to set traps under the  ice in early winter, as the beaver's food is still in good condition,  and they will not take bait well; moreover you are likely to frighten  them and make them harder to trap later on. The following methods are  among the best for use under the ice, the one first given, being most  used, and is probably the best:    Go close to the beaver's house where the ice is thin, and by cutting  small holes in the ice, find a place where the water is about twelve  inches deep. Having found such a place, enlarge the hole until it is  about sixteen by twenty inches in size, making a pen the same size as  the hole, by shoving down dead sticks about four inches apart. If the  bottom is very hard, you will have to freeze the sticks to the ice,  to hold them in place. This may be done by throwing snow in the  water, and packing it around the sticks and against the edge of the  ice. When the pen is completed, cut a piece of green poplar about 1  1/2 or 2 inches thick and two or three feet long, and fasten it to a  stake by one end--the poplar being placed at a right angle to the  stake. This green poplar is for bait, and the stake should be driven  down in one corner of the pen so that the bait is within two or three  inches from the bottom, and close along one side of the pen,  extending a foot or more beyond the entrance.      [Illustration: Beaver Trap Set Under Ice.]    The trap should be staked and set well inside of the pen, and quite  close to the bait, so that the jaw of the trap will just clear the  bait. This set will be readily understood by referring to the cut. If  the bottom is of thin mud, as is often the case, you will have to  make a bed for the trap, by sinking a bunch of evergreen boughs  inside of the pen. It is also best to fasten the bait near the  entrance to prevent the beaver from swinging it around. When the set  is completed, cover the hole with evergreen boughs, bank it with  snow, to keep it from freezing.    It is best to let this set go for about a week before looking at it.  The beavers will be frightened and will not approach the set for a  few days, but finally one of them musters up courage enough to try to  pull the bait out of the pen. When he finds it fast, he cuts it off  at the entrance of the pen, takes it to the house to eat it; this  sharpens his appetite, makes him more courageous, and he finally  ventures into the pen for the balance of the bait. In attempting to  cut the bait, he places one front foot on the bait and the other one  in the trap. When using this set you should use three or four sets at  each house.    Another good ice method is as follows: Find the proper depth of  water, about fourteen inches, and make a pen of dead sticks arranging  them in the form of a half-circle. Now take some green poplar and  shove them down firmly into the bottom, about six inches apart, close  up to the stakes, on the inside of the pen. These bait sticks must be  long enough to reach above the ice, so that they will freeze fast at  the top. Stake the trap and set it in the center of the enclosure,  with the pan about nine inches from the center bait. Throw some snow  in the hole, so that it will freeze and hold the bait sticks  securely.    The following method is one of the best for use in deep water: Cut a  dead pole about four inches in diameter and six or seven feet long.  Flatten the pole at one end, and loop the trap chain around the pole;  then set the trap on the end of the pole and tie it with a string, to  hold it in place. Now, cut an oblong hole in the ice, and place the  pole in the water in an inclined position so that the trap is about  twelve inches below the ice. Pack wet snow around the pole to hold it  in place, fasten two sticks of green poplar in the ice over the trap,  one on either side. In attempting to cut the bait, the beaver will  put his foot in the trap.    Always fasten your trap to a dead stick or pole, for if a green stake  is used, the beavers are likely to carry it away, trap and all.  Poplar and cottonwood make the best baits, but in case they cannot be  obtained, use birch, willow or black cherry.    When setting traps near the house, in open water, make as little  noise as possible, and do not remain in the vicinity longer than  necessary.    When trapping in open water, never camp or make a fire near the pond  where the beavers are located. In winter, after the ice has formed,  it does not matter.    If you find a beaver house in winter when the snow is deep, and wish  to know if it is inhabited, examine the house, and if the snow is  melted on the top, you may be sure there are beavers in it.    Another way to tell whether a house is inhabited, is to cut a hole  through the ice and shove down a piece of green poplar, filling the  hole with snow. Examine it in about a week, and if the poplar has  been cut, you may be sure you have found beavers.    The track of the beaver is seldom seen as they do not move about much  in winter and on their trails their tracks are obliterated by the  food which they drag into the water. The trapper does not look for  tracks, but for more conspicuous signs, such as houses and dams with  fresh cut wood.      [Illustration: The Muskrat.]        CHAPTER IX.    THE MUSKRAT.    The muskrat is a small herbivorous animal of the amphibious class.  Its head and body are from thirteen to fifteen inches in length. The  tail is nine or ten inches, two edged, and for two-thirds its length  is rudder shaped and covered with scales and thin, short hair. The  front feet are small, the hind feet, large and slightly webbed,  making the animal an expert swimmer. The color of the fur is brown  above and ashy beneath.    The muskrat is a nocturnal animal, but is sometimes seen in the day  time. Their food consists of grass and roots, fruit, grain and  vegetables. They will also eat clams, sometimes, when food is scarce.  They thrive best in sluggish streams and ponds, bordered with grass  and flags, the roots of which are their chief support and from the  tops of which they construct their houses. These structures are dome  shaped, and rise, sometimes to a height of five feet from the water.  The entrances are at the bottom, under water, so that the inside of  the house is not exposed to the open air. From six to ten muskrats  are sometimes found in one house. Hundreds of these dwellings can be  counted from a single point in many large marshes.    The muskrats found on the streams do not build houses, but live in  holes in the bank, the entrances of which are under water. The  muskrat is found throughout the greater part of the United States and  Canada. They are especially numerous in the marshes on the coast of  Delaware and Maryland. This muskrat ground is owned by private  parties, who lease the ground to the trappers for a certain length of  time, the trapper catching all the animals he can in that length of  time. Muskrats are also very plentiful in some parts of Western  Canada. These animals are very prolific, bringing forth from six to  nine at a birth and three litters in a season. They have many  enemies, such as the fox, mink, otter and owl, but their greatest  enemy is man.    Muskrats are trapped in the fall, winter and spring, but they are not  prime until mid-winter, and some are not fully prime until the first  of March. Nevertheless, they are more easily caught in the fall, and  as the skins bring a fair price, the most trapping is done at this  time, that is for \"bank rats,\"--those living in holes in the banks.  Where the muskrats live in houses, they are trapped mostly after the  ice had formed.    In the far North the skins are in good condition until the first of  June, while in the extreme South they should not be trapped after the  first of April. The muskrats found in settled districts are larger  and better furred than those of the wilderness, also, those found  East of the Mississippi River are larger than those of the West.    When trapping for these animals, the traps should always be staked  full length of chain into deep water, so that the captured animal  will drown, as otherwise they are almost certain to twist off the  foot, and escape, unless they are caught by a hind foot. Many  trappers set their traps several inches under water, as by so doing  they catch the rat by a hind foot, and there is very little danger of  them escaping. Some stake their traps the length of the chain into  deep water, and drive another stake about a foot beyond. The muskrat,  when caught, winds the chain around the outer stake and is thus  prevented from reaching the bank. Others prefer to tie a stone on the  end of the chain, and lay the stone in deep water.    The traps most used are the Nos. 1 and 1 1/2, but the No. 0 is also  used sometimes. The Victor trap is a great favorite, as it does not  have a strong a spring as the higher priced traps, and is not so  likely to break the animal's leg. The single spring Oneida Jump traps  are also fine traps for muskrats.    One of the most common methods of trapping the muskrat is to find  their slides on the bank and set the trap at the foot of the slide  under about two and a half or three inches of water. No covering is  needed.    If you can find a log, with one end lying in"]]]
