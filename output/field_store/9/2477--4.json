The sunlight shining through the  nearest window will be a call which you cannot counteract and your  butterfly will constantly respond to it in a most vexing manner. So  you must catch the butterfly young and take advantage of a brief but  docile period in their lives when they are willing to pose before your  camera in quite a remarkable manner. This is the period just after  the butterfly emerges from the chrysalis when its wings are fully  developed but before the tissues have hardened and the muscles in the  thorax are strong enough for flight. At this time the butterfly is  perfect, every scale is in its place and every spot of color is at its  best, and it will rest quietly upon a flower, leaf, or twig while you  adjust the camera and expose the plate. From one such specimen one can  get many pictures upon different flowers and with different angles of  view. (_See plates, pages 160, 225._)    In order to make admirable photographs of living butterflies it is by  no means necessary to have a regular photographic studio. If one has a  room lighted from the north or east one can arrange for exposure near  the window, using cardboard reflectors to make the light more even  from both sides. In such a situation one soon learns the exposure  periods required and can easily get many beautiful photographs.    A collection of prints of the butterflies of one's locality would be  one of the most interesting photographic exhibits that an amateur  could select. It is comparatively easy to get rather full sets showing  the life-histories of several of our larger species and such sets are  of course of especial interest. In the case of those caterpillars  which make nests upon the food plant, like the Painted Beauty larva  which remains for weeks feeding upon the leaves of the common wild  everlasting, the taking of the pictures of the different stages is  comparatively easy. One can keep the plant with the stem in water, and  get the caterpillar to change to the chrysalis, and emerge as the  butterfly, in the nest made from the flower heads and the upper  leaves.

They are easily obtained, easily  preserved, and retain their beauty for a long period even under  exposure to strong light. They offer opportunities for serious study  in which one cannot only review the facts which others have already  discovered, but also hope to contribute something of value to the sum  of human knowledge.    The mistake most commonly made by beginners with butterflies, as with  other collections, is to undertake too much. Instead of starting on  the hopeless task of making a collection of the butterflies of the  world, it is much better to start with the intention of making a  collection of those of one's own town. In the latter case one can hope  soon to attain the desired end and then, if one wishes, it is a simple  matter to reach out and make a collection of the butterflies of the  state or even of the particular region in which the state is located.  The natural limitations for a collection in New England is to make a  collection of New England butterflies. There is a splendid example of  such a collection on exhibition in the museum of the Boston Society of  Natural History. This contains representatives of practically every  kind that has been collected in New England, and yet there are less  than a hundred species in all. So it is apparent that a local  collection should be attainable by any enthusiastic student and the  very fact that the number of species is limited adds interest and  satisfaction to the pursuit.    The main value of any collection of objects lies in the point of view  of the collector. The most natural point of view for a beginner is  that of the local fauna, as indicated in the previous paragraph. Such  a collection best serves as a basis for a study of the subject but it  may well lead to a broader field through some special phase of  scientific interest. Thus while it would be hopeless for most persons  to attempt a collection of the butterflies of the world it would be  entirely reasonable for one to start a collection of all the species  in the world of any given genus or tribe, and such a set of specimens  would soon come to possess decided scientific value. Or, instead of  the point of view of generic or family relationship, one could take  the point of view of special geographical distribution. Thus a  collection of all the butterflies found within a certain number of  degrees of the North Pole showing the circumpolar butterfly fauna  would have great scientific interest.    There are also various other points of view which could be followed in  making a collection. There are already in many of the museums of the  world collections of butterflies which illustrate the various phases  of true mimicry--the resemblance of one species to another in the same  region. This is a field in which one could spend a lifetime of  endeavor, and secure results of great value to the world of science.  An easier problem for most collectors in the United States would be a  collection made from the point of view of resemblance to environment,  including such examples as the Angle-wings that show a bark-like set  of marks on the under surface. Yet another point of view would be that  of hibernation, the making of a collection of all butterflies that  hibernate as adults.    These are only a few suggestions. There are many other phases of  butterfly life which could be utilized as the basis for interesting  collections. The important thing is to have a definite object in view  and to make the collection a basis for a real study of the subject, so  that the collector will not only be growing intellectually but will  also be making a real contribution to our scientific knowledge.      _Collecting Apparatus_    To collect and preserve butterflies in proper condition for study,  certain apparatus is necessary. Perhaps the first essential is the  collecting net for catching butterflies in the field. The simplest way  to obtain this is to buy it of the dealers in entomological supplies.  Nets in considerable variety and at various prices are offered in the  catalogues of these firms. One can make, however, a net at home with  little difficulty. One need only obtain an iron wire about one fifth  of an inch in diameter and bend it into a circular ring a foot or  fifteen inches wide, leaving the ends projecting at right angles to  the circle and having a blacksmith weld them together so as to form a  spur about four inches long. Now thrust this spur into some convenient  handle, such as a broomstick, and sew over the wire circle a bag of  mosquito netting, Swiss muslin, or some similar fabric. It is better  that this material be green or black rather than white.    After the butterflies are caught, they must be killed, so some form of  killing bottle is necessary. Most collectors use a cyanide bottle, in  which the fumes of cyanide of potassium kill the insects. One of the  best ways to make this is to place in a wide-mouthed bottle two or  three lumps of cyanide of potassium, approximately an inch across.  Over this place some fine sawdust and on top of the sawdust, pour  liquid plaster of paris carefully so that it will harden into a layer  about half an inch thick. Allow the plaster to become thoroughly dry,  then insert the stopper into the bottle and it will be ready for use.  It is better to use a ground glass stopper so that the bottle will  always be air tight. The sawdust is often omitted, the plaster of  paris being poured directly over the cyanide. The special advantage of  the sawdust is that it tends to absorb the cyanide in case it  liquefies, as it often does in damp weather. As this cyanide is a  deadly poison, it is better to let a druggist prepare the bottle or  else to buy it already prepared of the dealers in such supplies.       [Illustration: Butterfly Envelopes. Fold first on line _AB_;       then on _AD_ and _CB_; then on _BF_ and _EA_. (From Holland).]    After the specimens have been killed in the cyanide bottle, some  method of keeping them is necessary. The simplest way is to preserve  them with their wings closed together in pieces of paper folded over  into triangles as indicated on the accompanying diagrams. Such  specimens may be kept for an indefinite time and if one wishes to  mount them later, it is only necessary to place them for a few hours  in a relaxing jar, which is simply a closed vessel with enough water  in the bottom to saturate the air with moisture. A great advantage of  keeping the specimens in these paper covers is that they require so  little room and are easily stored away in tin cans or boxes where they  are safe from dust and destroying enemies.       [Illustration: Setting Board with Butterfly in place.       (From Holland)]    Those butterflies which are to be preserved in the ordinary way, in  drawers or cabinets, must be spread out and held in position while the  body is drying so that the wings will remain expanded. For this  purpose,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3708"],[0,"An Introduction to Chemical Science (#10)"],[1,"is the turning of blue litmus red.    Experiment 43.--Pour 5 cc. of a solution of litmus in water, into  a clean t.t. or small beaker. Pour 2 or 3 cc. of HCl into an  evaporating-dish, and the same quantity of NH4OH into another  dish. Take a drop of the HCl on a stirring-rod and stir the  litmus solution with it. Note the acid reaction. Clean the rod,  and with it take a drop (or more if necessary) of NH4OH, and add  this to the red litmus solution, noting the alkaline reaction.  Experiment in the same way with the two other principal acids and  the two other alkalies.    Litmus paper is commonly used to test these reactions, and  hereafter whenever the term LITMUS is employed in that sense, the  test-paper should be understood. This paper can be prepared by  dipping unglazed paper into a strong aqueous solution of  litmus.    CHAPTER XVI.    SALTS.    71. Acids and Bases are usually Opposite in Character.--When two  forces act in opposition they tend to neutralize each other. We  may see an analogy to this in the union of the two opposite  classes of compounds, acids and bases, to form salts.    72. Neutralization.    Experiment 44.--Put into an evaporating-dish 5 cc. of NaOH  solution. Add HCl to this from a t.t., a few drops at a time,  stirring the mixture with a glass rod (Fig. 20), and testing it  with litmus paper, until the liquid is neutral, i.e. will not  turn the test paper from blue to red, or red to blue. Test with  both colors. If it turns blue to red, too much acid has been  added; if red to blue, too much base. When it is very nearly  neutral, add the reagent, HCl or NaOH, a drop at a time with the  stirring-rod. It must be absolutely neutral to both colors.  Evaporate the water by heating the dish over asbestus paper, wire  gauze, or sand, in an iron plate (Fig. 21) till the residue  becomes dry and white. Cool the residue, taste, and name it. The  equation is: HCl + NaOH = NaCl + HOH or H2O. Note which elements,  positive or negative, change places. Why was the liquid boiled?  The residue is a type of a large class of compounds, called  salts.    (Fig. 20)                           (Fig. 21)    Experiment 45. -- Experiment in the same way with KOH solution  and H2SO4, applying the same tests. H2SO4 + 2 KOH = K2SO4 + 2  HOH. What is the solid product?    Experiment 46.--Neutralize NH4OH with HNO3, evaporate, apply the  tests, and write the equation. Write equations for the  combination of NaOH and H2SO4; NaOH and HNO3; KOH and HCl; KOH  and HNO3; NH4OH and HCl; NH4OH and H2SO4. Describe the experiment  represented by each equation, and be sure you can perform it if  asked to do so. What is the usual action of a salt on litmus? How  is a salt made? What else is formed at the same time? Have all  salts a saline taste? Does every salt contain a positive element  or radical? A negative?    73. A Salt is the product of the union of a positive and a  negative element or radical; it may be made by mixing a base and  an acid.    The salt KI represents what acid? What base, or hydrate? Write  the equation for making KI from its acid and base. Describe the  experiment in full. Classify, as to acids, bases, or salts: KBr,  Fe(OH)2, HI, NaBr, HNO2, Al2(OH)6, KClO3, HClO3, H2S, K2S, H2S03,  K2SO4, Ca(OH)2, CaCO3, NaBr03, CaSO4, H2CO3, K2CO3, Cu(OH)2,  Cu(NO3)2, PbSO4, H3P04, Na2P04. In the SALTS above, draw a light  vertical line, separating the positive from the negative part of  the symbol. Now state what acid each represents. What base. Write  the reaction in the preparation of each salt above from its acid  and base; then state the experiment for producing it.    74. Naming Salts.--(NO3) is the nitrate radical; KNO3 is  potassium nitrate. From what acid? (NO2) is the nitrite radical;  KN02 is potassium nitrite. From what acid? Note that the endings  of the acids are OUS and IC; also that the names of their salts  end in ITE and ATE. From which acid--IC or OUS--is the salt  ending in ATE derived? That ending in ITE?    Name these salts, the acids from which they are derived, and the  endings of both acids and salts: NaNO3, NaNO2, K2SO4, K2SO3,  CaSO4, CaSO3, KClO3, KClO2, KClO, KClO4 (use prefixes HYPO and  PER, as with acids), Ca3(PO4)2, Ca3(P03)2, CuSO4, CuSO3, AgNO3,  Cu(NO3)2. FeS, FeS2, are respectively FERROUS SULPHIDE and FERRIC  SULPHIDE. Name: HgCl, HgCl2, FeCl2, Fe2Cl6, FeSO4, Fe2(SO4)3.75.  Acid Salts.--Write symbols for nitric, sulphuric, phosphoric  acids. How many H atoms in each? Replace all the H in the symbol  of each with Na, and name the products. Again, in sulphuric acid  replace one atom of H with Na; then in phosphoric replace first  one, then two, and finally three H atoms with Na. HNaSO4 is  hydrogen sodium sulphate; HNa2P04 is hydrogen di-sodium  phosphate. Name the other salts symbolized. Name HNaNH4P04.  Though these products are all salts, some contain replaceable H,  and are called acid salts. Those which have all the H replaced by  a metal are normal salts. Name and classify, as to normal or acid  salts: Na2CO3, HNaCO3, K2SO4, HKSO4, (NH4)2SO4, HNH4SO4, Na3P04,  HNa2P04, H2NaP04.    The BASICITY of an acid is determined by the number of  replaceable H atoms in its molecule. It is called MONOBASIC if it  has one; DIBASIC if two; TRI- if three, etc. Note the basicity of  each acid named above. How many possible salts of H2SO4 with Na?  Of H3P04 with Na? Which are normal and which acid? What is the  basicity of H4Si04?    Some normal, as well as acid, salts change litmus. Na2CO3,  representing a strong base and a weak acid, turns it blue. There  are other modes of obtaining salts, but this is the only one  which we sball consider.    76. Salts Occur Abundantly in Nature, such as NaCl, MgSO4, CaCO3.  Acids and bases are found in small quantities only. Why is this?  Why are there not springs of H2SO4 and NH4OH? We have seen that  acids and bases are extremely active, have opposite characters,  and combine to form relatively inactive salts. If they existed in  the free state, they would soon combine by reason of their strong  affinities. This is what in all ages of the world has taken  place, and this is why salts are common, acids and bases rare.  Active agents rarely exist in the free state in large quantities.  Oxygen seems to be an exception, but this is because there is a  superabundance of it. While vast quantities are locked up in  compounds in rocks, water, and salts of the earth, much remains  with which there is nothing to combine.    CHAPTER XVII.    CHLORHYDRIC ACID.    77. We have seen that salts are made by the union of acids and  bases. Can these last be obtained from salts?    78. Preparation of HCl.    Experiment 47.--Into a flask put 10 g. coarse NaCl, and add 20  cc. H2SO4. Connect with Woulff bottles [Woulff bottles may be  made by fitting to wide-mouthed bottles corks with three holes,  through which pass two delivery tubes, and a central safety tube  dipping into the liquid, as in Figures 22 and 23.] partly filled  with water, as in Figure 22. One bottle is enough to collect the  HCl; but in that case it is less pure, since some H2SO4 and other  impurities are carried over. Several may be connected, as in  Figure 23. The water in the first bottle must be nearly saturated  before much gas will pass into the second. Heat the mixture 15 or  20 minutes, not very strongly, to prevent too much foaming.  Notice any current in the first bottle. NaCl + H2SO4 = HNaSO4 +  HCl. Intense heat would have given: 2NaCl + H2SO4 = Na2SO4 +  2HCl. Compare these equations with those for HNO3. In which  equation above is H2SO4 used most economically? Both reactions  take place when HCl is made on the large scale.    (Fig. 22)    79. Tests. Experiment 48.--(1) Test with litmus the liquid in  each Woulffbottle. (2) Put a piece of Zn into a t.t. and cover it  with liquid from the first bottle. Write the reaction, and test  the gas. (3) To 2 cc.solution  AgNO3 in a t.t. add 2 cc.of the  acid. Describe, and write the reaction. Is AgCl soluble in water?  (4) Into a t.t. pour 5 cc.Pb(NO3)2 solution, and add the same  amount of prepared acid. Give the description and the reaction.  (5) In the same way test the acid with Hg2(NO3)2 solution, giving  the reaction. (6) Drake a little HCl in a t.t., and bring the gas  escaping from the d.t. in contact with a burning stick. Does it  support the combustion of C? (7) Hold a piece of dry litmus paper  against it. [figure 23] (8) Hold it over 2 cc.of NH4OH in an  evaporating-dish. Describe, name the product, and write the  reaction. (3), (4), (5), (8), are characteristic tests for this  acid.    80. Chlorhydric, Hydrochloric or Muriatic, Acid is a Gas.--As  used, it is dissolved, in water, for which it has great affinity.  Water will hold, according to temperature, from 400 to 500 times  its volume of HCl. Hundreds of thousands of tons of the acid are  annually made, mostly in Europe, as a bye-product in Na2CO3  manufacture. The gas is passed into towers through which a spray  of water falls; this absorbs it. The yellow color in most  commercial HCl indicates impurities, some of which are Fe, S, As,  and organic matter. As, S, etc., come from the pyrites used in  making H2SO4. Chemically pure (C.P.) acid is freed from these,  and is without color. The gas may be dried by passing it through  a glass tube holding CaCl2 (Fig. 16) and collecting it over  mercury.    The muriatic acid of commerce consists of about two- thirds water  by weight. HCl can also be made by direct union of its  constituents.81. Uses.--HCl is used to make Cl, and also  bleaching- powder. Its use as a reagent in the laboratory is  illustrated by the following experiment:-- Experiment 49.--Put  into a t.t. 2 cc. AgNO3 solution, add 5 cc. H2O, then add slowly  HCl so long as a ppt. (precipitate) is formed. This ppt. is AgCl.  Now in another t.t. put 2 cc. Cu(NO3)2, solution, add 5 cc. H2O,  then a little HCl. No ppt. is formed. Now if a solution of AgNO3  and a solution of"]]]
