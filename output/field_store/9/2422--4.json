There was no sound of struggling       from within, but the screams seemed to increase in loudness,       and at the same time they heard the bolts of the latticed       window withdrawn, and the window itself grated upon the sill       as if thrown open. One _last_ shriek, so long, and piercing,       and agonized, as to be scarcely human, swelled from the       room, and suddenly there followed a death-like silence. A       light step was heard crossing the floor, as if from the bed       to the window, and almost at the same instant the door gave       way, and yielding to the pressure of the external       applicants, they were nearly precipitated into the room. It       was empty. The window was open, and Schalken sprang to a       chair, and gazed out upon the street and canal below. There       was no one there; but he saw, or thought he saw, the waters       of the broad canal beneath settling ring after ring, in       heavy circles, as if a moment before disturbed by the       submersion of some ponderous body.\"          SKETCHES OF LIFE IN SWEDEN.      Hans Christian Anderson, the Danish poet and story-teller, whose  _Improvisatore_ is one of the most beautiful and intrinsically truthful  of the myriad beautiful books upon Italian life, has published a new  work, _Pictures of Sweden_. It is very genial summer reading, consisting  of detached sketches of Swedish life and scenery, with interludes of  poetic reverie. The London journals complain that it is not sufficiently  well translated, but we quote the following characteristic passages in  which the same weird child-likeness of feeling which his readers will  recall, is expressed in the peculiar, subdued strain of northern  sentimentalism, which is more the complexion, than the substance of his  style. Here is the prelude to the book:         \"It is a delightful spring: the birds warble, but you do not       understand their song! Well, hear it in a free translation.         \"'Get on my back,' says the stork, our green island's sacred       bird, 'and I will carry thee over the Sound. Sweden also has       fresh and fragrant beech woods, green meadows and       cornfields. In Scania, with the flowering apple-trees behind       the peasant's house, you will think that you are still in       Denmark.'         \"'Fly with me,' says the swallow; 'I fly over Holland's       mountain ridge, where the beech-trees cease to grow; I fly       further towards the north than the stork. You shall see the       vegetable mould pass over into rocky ground; see snug, neat       towns, old churches and mansions, where all is good and       comfortable, where the family stand in a circle around the       table and say grace at meals, where the least of the       children says a prayer, and, morning and evening, sings a       psalm. I have heard it, I have seen it, when little, from my       nest under the eaves.'         \"'Come with me! come with me!' screams the restless       sea-gull, and flies in an expecting circle. 'Come with me to       the Skjaergaards, where rocky isles by thousands, with fir       and pine, lie like flower beds along the coast; where the       fishermen draw the well-filled nets!'         \"'Rest thee between our extended wings,' sing the wild       swans. 'Let us bear thee up to the great lakes, the       perpetually roaring elves (rivers), that rush on with arrowy       swiftness; where the oak forest has long ceased, and the       birch-tree becomes stunted. Rest thee between our extended       wings: we fly up to Sulitelma, the island's eye, as the       mountain is called; we fly from the vernal green valley, up       over the snow-drifts, to the mountain's top, whence thou       canst see the North Sea, on yonder side of Norway.         \"'We fly to Jemteland, where the rocky mountains are high       and blue; where the Foss roars and rushes; where the torches       are lighted as _budstikke,_ to announce that the ferryman is       expected. Up to the deep, cold-running waters, where the       midsummer sun does not set; where the rosy hue of eve is       that of morn.\"    Stockholm is thus pictured, with an allusion, at the close, to a  building dear to us all, now--as that which was first enriched by the  voice, whose recent lapse into silence has made our hearts heavy:         \"It is but the work of one night; the same night when Oluf       Hakonson, with iron and with fire, burst his onward way       through the stubborn ground; before the day breaks the       waters of the Maelar roll there; the Norwegian prince, Oluf,       sailed through the royal channel he had cut in the east. The       stockades, where the iron chains hang, must bear the       defences; the citizens from the burnt-down Sigtuna erect       themselves a bulwark here, and build their new little town       on stock-holms.[A] The clouds go, and the years go! Do you       see how the gables grow? there rise towers and forts. Birger       Jarl makes the town of Stockholm a fortress; the warders       stand with bow and arrow on the walls, reconnoitring over       lake and fiord, over Brunkaberg sand-ridge. There where the       sand slopes upwards from Roerstrand's Lake they build Clara       cloister, and between it and the town a street springs up:       several more appear; they form an extensive city, which soon       becomes the place of contest for different partisans, where       Ladelaas's sons plant the banner, and where the German       Albrecht's retainers burn the Swedes alive within its walls.       Stockholm is, however, the heart of the kingdom: that the       Danes know well; that the Swedes know too, and there is       strife and bloody combating. Blood flows by the       executioner's hand, Denmark's Christian the Second, Sweden's       executioner, stands in the market-place. Roll, ye runes! see       over Brunkaberg sand-ridge, where the Swedish people       conquered the Danish host, there they raise the May-pole: it       is midsummer-eve--Gustavus Vasa makes his entry into       Stockholm. Around the May-pole there grow fruit and       kitchen-gardens, houses and streets; they vanish in flames,       they rise again; that gloomy fortress towards the tower is       transformed into a palace, and the city stands magnificently       with towers and draw-bridges. There grows a town by itself       on the sand-ridge, a third springs up on the rock towards       the south; the old walls fall at Gustavus Adolphus's       command; the three towns are one, large and extensive,       picturesquely varied with old stone houses, wooden shops,       and grass-roofed huts; the sun shines on the brass balls of       the towers, and a forest of masts stands in that secure       harbor. * * *         \"It is a very little semicircular island, on which the       arches of the bridge rest: a garden full of flowers and       trees, which we overlook from the high parapet of the       bridge. Ladies and gentlemen promenade there; musicians       play, families sit there in groups, and take refreshments in       the vaulted halls under the bridge, and look out between the       green trees over the open water, to the houses and mansions,       and also to the woods and rocks: we forget that we are in       the midst of the city. It is the bridge here that unites       Stockholm with Nordmalen, where the greatest part of the       fashionable world live, in two long Berlin-like streets; yet       amongst all the great houses we will only visit one, and       that is the theatre. We will go on the stage itself--it has       an historical signification. Here by the third side-scene       from the stage-lights, to the right, as we look down towards       the audience, Gustavus the Third was assassinated at a       masquerade; and he was borne into that little chamber there,       close by the scene, whilst all the outlets were closed, and       the motley group of harlequins, polichinellos, wild men,       gods and goddesses, with unmasked faces, pale and terrified,       crept together; the dancing ballet-farce had become a real       tragedy. This theatre is Jenny Lind's childhood's home. Here       she has sung in the choruses when a little girl; here she       first made her appearance in public, and was cheeringly       encouraged when a child; here, poor and sorrowful, she has       shed tears, when her voice left her, and sent up pious       prayers to her Maker. From hence the world's nightingale       flew out over distant lands, and proclaimed the purity and       holiness of art.\"    We ramble a moment in the garden of Linnaeus, and contemplate his  monument. It is withered and wasted now; it appears not unlike that  grave garden of Ferney, with the close bower in which Voltaire used to  walk and meditate:         \"The walls shine brightly, and with varied hues, in the       great chapel behind the high altar. The fresco paintings       present to us the most eventful circumstances of Gustavus       Vasa's life. Here his clay moulders, with that of his three       consorts. Yonder, a work in marble, by Sargel, solicits our       attention: it adorns the burial-chapel of the De Geers; and       here, in the centre aisle, under that flat stone, rests       Linnaeus. In the side chapel, is his monument, erected by       _amici_ and _discipuli_; a sufficient sum was quickly raised       for its erection, and the King, Gustavus the Third, himself       brought his royal gift. The projector of the subscription       then explained to him, that the purposed inscription was,       that the monument was erected only by friends and disciples,       and King Gustavus answered: 'And am not I also one of       Linnaeus's disciples?' The monument was raised, and a hall       built in the botanical garden, under splendid trees. There       stands his bust; but the remembrance of himself, his home,    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33972"],[0,"Florida: An Ideal Cattle State (#10)"],[1,". It is too bad that you do not raise more sheep on your  ranges, for they do not hurt the cattle pastures, eating only the tender  blades down under the more mature grass. We run thousands of sheep on  our cattle ranges in Texas. The goats will be a distinct benefit to the  Florida ranges, as they do not eat much grass when they can get  underbrush, briars and weeds. By having those cleaned out of the  pastures the grass will have a better chance to grow.    \"I am informed that Florida does not have to combat coyotes, which are  our worst sheep enemies, so you really have no serious losses to  anticipate on your sheep investments. And yet there are very few sheep  on the ranges we have visited. It is to be hoped that your cattlemen  will use more sheep on the ranges.    \"The range country should become the calf incubator for the Southeastern  States, the offspring being sold at weaning time or as yearlings. That  will give your ranges a larger carrying capacity for breeding stock and  let the grain-producing sections do the finishing.\"--_From the  Manufacturers' Record, Sept. 13, 1917._          CATTLE RAISING IN FLORIDA.         As I Saw it on a Thousand-mile Tour of the Central Part of       the State.    _By A. C. Williams._      Wasn't it Saul who went out in search of asses and found a kingdom? You  men who are familiar with the Bible can answer that. But I can testify  that I, while not in search of asses, duplicated Saul's experience  during the past month, when, in company with M. Sansom, W. N. Waddell,  Caesar Kleberg and Tom T. East of Texas, Dr. L. J. Allen of Oklahoma,  Geo. M. Rommel of Washington, P. L. Sutherland, C. L. Gaines and J. G.  Boyd of Florida, I had the pleasure of a thousand-mile trip through the  central part of the State of Florida.    Nature has been very kind to Florida, providing delightful climate,  fertile lands and adequate rainfall for farming purposes; broad  prairies, carpeted with succulent grasses and watered by running streams  for live stock raising; timber galore for sawmills, and countless beauty  spots beckoning to tourists. But the citizens of that State have been  slow to take advantage of their opportunities. Agriculture in many  sections has been a neglected art. Practically all of the foodstuffs,  including grain, meat, butter and eggs, have been produced outside the  State. Colonization companies have devoted their energies to boosting  orange orchards and truck gardens (the \"poker game of agriculture\"), and  little organized effort has been made to attract farmers and stockmen of  tireless energy--the backbone of any community.    Among the neglected industries, none stand out more conspicuously than  stock raising. The native cattle, inbred, stunted specimens of doubtful  origin, have been turned loose on the free, open range to rustle for  themselves, and little effort has been made in most sections toward  breed improvement. Due to the mild climate, good range, adequate water  supply and absence of screw worms, coyotes and other pests, they have  survived. And with open range and no expense they have been very  profitable. In our entire trip we saw only two or three flocks of sheep  and goats. They were of better quality than I had expected--fairly good  for mutton, but light on wool.    A new era is dawning for the cattle business of Florida. The war has  forced a reduction in the exports of turpentine and rosin, and the large  land owners are turning their attention to improved stock raising. A  packing house has been erected at Jacksonville. Systematic tick  eradication is being carried on. Large tracts of land have been fenced  and stocked. Hundreds of well-bred Texas cows and registered Hereford,  Angus, Shorthorn and Brahma bulls are being purchased, and the work of  breed improvement is growing in popularity.    Good feed and forage crops can be grown in most sections, and with this  new movement for improved live stock will come deeper interest in  agriculture. The chief forage crops now produced in that State are corn,  velvet beans, Japanese cane, sorghum, cow peas and beggar-weed. The  first three perhaps take the lead. The corn and velvet beans are planted  together, in rows from four to six feet apart. The beans grow very rank,  producing an abundance of good hay, and beans which are high in feeding  value. The beans may be left on the vines for pasturage, or gathered and  ground into bean meal, which is excellent for cattle feeding. Japanese  cane resembles our Texas ribbon cane. It makes good silage, keeps well  and is highly relished by cattle. The Florida beggar-weed grows as a  volunteer in old fields of a light sandy soil. If cut at the right time  it makes good hay, and, while it is rather bulky for silage alone, it is  said to add greatly to the fattening value of silage. Corn and cow peas  need no introduction to our readers.    The most common grasses are several varieties of paspalum or carpet  grass, switch grass, wire grass, little blue maiden cane and Bermuda.  Crab and Natal grass are volunteers which follow crops on sandy soils.  Both Guinea and Para grasses thrive in South Florida, where less liable  to injury by frost. Fort Thompson grass, which resembles giant Bermuda,  with larger joint, stem and leaf, is a native of Florida, which will  some day be recognized as one of their very best pasture grasses.    With their open range and native cattle--a poorer grade than our  old-time longhorn--the cattle business of Florida today may be compared  to that of Texas twenty years ago. What they need is more bulls and  experienced cattlemen who will apply the intelligence, energy and  persistence that know not failure.    Leaving Kenansville at 8:15, we were soon out on the Kissimmee prairie  of thousands and thousands of acres of open range. Here, where the grass  was very luxuriant, resembling a hay meadow, we saw several hundred more  of the small native cattle, followed by the common scrubby bulls. The  fat four-year-old steers weighed around 550 pounds, and are valued at  $30 per head. The cows weighed around 500 pounds. The range herds of  mixed ages and classes are valued at $20 per head. We soon left the  public highway, circling marshes and dodging palmettos. Our next stop  was on Gum Slough Ranch, where we were told that on a pasture of 10,000  acres there were 6,000 cattle. The ground was well covered with carpet  and a variety of other grasses, and did not show the effects of close  grazing. The cattle were in good condition and of better quality than  most of the others which we had inspected.--_From The Cattleman,  September, 1917._"]]]
