Young-of-the-year were taken at the lower Neosho station on 1 July, 1959  (and subsequently), in moderately fast water over gravel. On 21 August,  1958, a ripe female (eggs stripped easily) was the only slender-headed  darter present in a collection from riffles at the middle Neosho  station.      #Percina caprodes# (Rafinesque)    Logperch    Logperch were not taken in the Marais des Cygnes. They were rare in the  Neosho, where they were taken most frequently at the upper station in  water two to three feet deep, over gravel bottom, in moderate to slight  current. This species was present in intermittent pools at the upper  Neosho station in 1957.      #Percina copelandi# (Jordan)    Channel Darter    One specimen was taken at the lower Neosho station in 1959. Because no  others ever have been found in the mainstream of the Neosho River, I  suspect that my specimen is a \"stray\" from one of the smaller  tributaries, where channel darters are locally common.      #Etheostoma flabellare# Rafinesque    Fan-tailed Darter    The fan-tailed darter is represented in my collections by one specimen,  obtained in the mainstream of the Neosho River at the lower station in  1957. Records of this species in Kansas are almost confined to the  smallest, clear, permanent streams of the southeastern part of the  state. My specimen may represent a small population that retreated to  the mainstream of the Neosho during drought.      #Etheostoma spectabile# (Agassiz)    Orange-throated Darter    Orange-throated darters were common at the upper Marais des Cygnes and  upper Neosho stations in 1959, rare at the middle and lower Neosho  stations, and absent from the middle and lower Marais des Cygnes  stations. The species was found almost exclusively on upstream riffles  over gravel-rubble bottom. The population in the upper Neosho was  decimated by drought, and the fish did not become common until the  summer of 1959, the third year after resumption of normal stream-flow.    Deacon and Metcalf (1961:320) indicated that long periods of  intermittency result in depletion or elimination of populations of the  orange-throated darter in the Wakarusa River, Kansas. A limited number  of orange-throated darters probably survived in the few permanent pools  in the upper Neosho and provided the brood-stock necessary to repopulate  this section of the stream.      #Aplodinotus grunniens# Rafinesque    Freshwater Drum    Drum were taken at all stations, but were most abundant at the middle  and lower Neosho stations. A high level of abundance also was found in  1957 at the middle Marais des Cygnes station. The abundance of drum  declined from 1957 to 1959, but the average size increased because of a  dominant 1957 year-class that was moderately reduced by natural  mortality in 1958-'59. Although the population was composed largely of  young-of-the-year and adults in 1957, it was dominated by yearling  individuals in 1958. By 1959 the number had declined considerably and  the population consisted mostly of juveniles and adults. Fish of the  1957 year-class reached a length of approximately ten inches by  mid-summer of 1959 (Table 8).    Adults were taken in a variety of habitats, but most often in quiet  water. On the other hand, yearlings were extremely abundant in 1958 near  shore in shallow, moderately fast water over rubble bottom at night.  Drum were rare in the same areas in daylight (Table 9).  Young-of-the-year occur in shallow, quiet water, usually over  mud-bottom.    The freshwater drum matures at about 12 inches T. L. Ripe males were  taken as late as 23 June 1959; however, the height of the spawning  season probably is in May.      TABLE 8.

The man who trusts womankind trusts  deceivers.    (ll. 376-380) There should be an only son, to feed his father's house,  for so wealth will increase in the home; but if you leave a second son  you should die old. Yet Zeus can easily give great wealth to a greater  number. More hands mean more work and more increase.    (ll. 381-382) If your heart within you desires wealth, do these things  and work with work upon work.    (ll. 383-404) When the Pleiades, daughters of Atlas, are rising [1310],  begin your harvest, and your ploughing when they are going to set  [1311]. Forty nights and days they are hidden and appear again as the  year moves round, when first you sharpen your sickle. This is the law  of the plains, and of those who live near the sea, and who inhabit rich  country, the glens and dingles far from the tossing sea,--strip to  sow and strip to plough and strip to reap, if you wish to get in all  Demeter's fruits in due season, and that each kind may grow in its  season. Else, afterwards, you may chance to be in want, and go begging  to other men's houses, but without avail; as you have already come to  me. But I will give you no more nor give you further measure. Foolish  Perses! Work the work which the gods ordained for men, lest in bitter  anguish of spirit you with your wife and children seek your livelihood  amongst your neighbours, and they do not heed you. Two or three times,  may be, you will succeed, but if you trouble them further, it will  not avail you, and all your talk will be in vain, and your word-play  unprofitable. Nay, I bid you find a way to pay your debts and avoid  hunger.    (ll. 405-413) First of all, get a house, and a woman and an ox for the  plough--a slave woman and not a wife, to follow the oxen as well--and  make everything ready at home, so that you may not have to ask of  another, and he refuses you, and so, because you are in lack, the season  pass by and your work come to nothing. Do not put your work off till  to-morrow and the day after; for a sluggish worker does not fill his  barn, nor one who puts off his work: industry makes work go well, but a  man who puts off work is always at hand-grips with ruin.    (ll. 414-447) When the piercing power and sultry heat of the sun abate,  and almighty Zeus sends the autumn rains [1312], and men's flesh comes  to feel far easier,--for then the star Sirius passes over the heads  of men, who are born to misery, only a little while by day and takes  greater share of night,--then, when it showers its leaves to the ground  and stops sprouting, the wood you cut with your axe is least liable to  worm. Then remember to hew your timber: it is the season for that work.  Cut a mortar [1313] three feet wide and a pestle three cubits long, and  an axle of seven feet, for it will do very well so; but if you make  it eight feet long, you can cut a beetle [1314] from it as well. Cut  a felloe three spans across for a waggon of ten palms' width. Hew also  many bent timbers, and bring home a plough-tree when you have found it,  and look out on the mountain or in the field for one of holm-oak; for  this is the strongest for oxen to plough with when one of Athena's  handmen has fixed in the share-beam and fastened it to the pole with  dowels. Get two ploughs ready work on them at home, one all of a piece,  and the other jointed. It is far better to do this, for if you should  break one of them, you can put the oxen to the other. Poles of laurel or  elm are most free from worms, and a share-beam of oak and a plough-tree  of holm-oak. Get two oxen, bulls of nine years; for their strength is  unspent and they are in the prime of their age: they are best for work.  They will not fight in the furrow and break the plough and then leave  the work undone. Let a brisk fellow of forty years follow them, with a  loaf of four quarters [1315] and eight slices [1316] for his dinner, one  who will attend to his work and drive a straight furrow and is past the  age for gaping after his fellows, but will keep his mind on his work. No  younger man will be better than he at scattering the seed and avoiding  double-sowing; for a man less staid gets disturbed, hankering after his  fellows.    (ll. 448-457) Mark, when you hear the voice of the crane [1317] who  cries year by year from the clouds above, for she give the signal for  ploughing and shows the season of rainy winter; but she vexes the heart  of the man who has no oxen. Then is the time to feed up your horned  oxen in the byre; for it is easy to say: 'Give me a yoke of oxen and a  waggon,' and it is easy to refuse: 'I have work for my oxen.' The man  who is rich in fancy thinks his waggon as good as built already--the  fool! He does not know that there are a hundred timbers to a waggon.  Take care to lay these up beforehand at home.    (ll. 458-464) So soon as the time for ploughing is proclaimed to men,  then make haste, you and your slaves alike, in wet and in dry, to plough  in the season for ploughing, and bestir yourself early in the morning so  that your fields may be full. Plough in the spring; but fallow broken up  in the summer will not belie your hopes. Sow fallow land when the  soil is still getting light: fallow land is a defender from harm and a  soother of children.    (ll. 465-478) Pray to Zeus of the Earth and to pure Demeter to make  Demeter's holy grain sound and heavy, when first you begin ploughing,  when you hold in your hand the end of the plough-tail and bring down  your stick on the backs of the oxen as they draw on the pole-bar by the  yoke-straps. Let a slave follow a little behind with a mattock and make  trouble for the birds by hiding the seed; for good management is the  best for mortal men as bad management is the worst. In this way your  corn-ears will bow to the ground with fullness if the Olympian himself  gives a good result at the last, and you will sweep the cobwebs from  your bins and you will be glad, I ween, as you take of your garnered  substance. And so you will have plenty till you come to grey [1318]  springtime, and will not look wistfully to others, but another shall be  in need of your help.    (ll. 479-492) But if you plough the good ground at the solstice [1319],  you will reap sitting, grasping a thin crop in your hand, binding the  sheaves awry, dust-covered, not glad at all; so you will bring all home  in a basket and not many will admire you. Yet the will of Zeus who holds  the aegis is different at different times; and it is hard for mortal  men to tell it; for if you should plough late, you may find this  remedy--when the cuckoo first calls [1320] in the leaves of the oak and  makes men glad all over the boundless earth, if Zeus should send rain  on the third day and not cease until it rises neither above an ox's hoof  nor falls short of it, then the late-plougher will vie with the early.  Keep all this well in mind, and fail not to mark grey spring as it comes  and the season of rain.    (ll 493-501) Pass by the smithy and its crowded lounge in winter time  when the cold keeps men from field work,--for then an industrious man  can greatly prosper his house--lest bitter winter catch you helpless and  poor and you chafe a swollen foot with a shrunk hand. The idle man  who waits on empty hope, lacking a livelihood, lays to heart  mischief-making; it is not an wholesome hope that accompanies a need man  who lolls at ease while he has no sure livelihood.    (ll. 502-503) While it is yet midsummer command your slaves: 'It will  not always be summer, build barns.'    (ll. 504-535) Avoid the month Lenaeon [1321], wretched days, all of them  fit to skin an ox, and the frosts which are cruel when Boreas blows over  the earth. He blows across horse-breeding Thrace upon the wide sea and  stirs it up, while earth and the forest howl. On many a high-leafed  oak and thick pine he falls and brings them to the bounteous earth in  mountain glens: then all the immense wood roars and the beasts shudder  and put their tails between their legs, even those whose hide is covered  with fur; for with his bitter blast he blows even through them although  they are shaggy-breasted. He goes even through an ox's hide; it does not  stop him. Also he blows through the goat's fine hair. But through the  fleeces of sheep, because their wool is abundant, the keen wind Boreas  pierces not at all; but it makes the old man curved as a wheel. And it  does not blow through the tender maiden who stays indoors with her  dear mother, unlearned as yet in the works of golden Aphrodite, and who  washes her soft body and anoints herself with oil and lies down in an  inner room within the house, on a winter's day when the Boneless One  [1322] gnaws his foot in his fireless house and wretched home; for the  sun shows him no pastures to make for, but goes to and fro over the land  and city of dusky men [1323], and shines more sluggishly upon the whole  race of the Hellenes. Then the horned and unhorned denizens of the wood,  with teeth chattering pitifully, flee through the copses and glades, and  all, as they seek shelter, have this one care, to gain thick coverts or  some hollow rock. Then, like the Three-legged One [1324] whose back is  broken and whose head looks down upon the ground, like him, I say, they  wander to escape the white snow.    (ll. 536-563) Then put on, as I bid you, a soft coat and a tunic to the  feet to shield your body,--and you should weave thick woof on thin warp.  In this clothe yourself so that your hair may keep still and not bristle  and stand upon end all over your body.    Lace on your feet close-fitting boots of the hide of a slaughtered ox,  thickly lined with felt inside. And when the season of frost comes on,  stitch together skins of firstling kids with ox-sinew, to put over your  back and to keep off the rain. On your head above wear a shaped cap  of felt to"]]]
