The economy rebounded in 1993-95 after a severe    depression accompanying the collapse of the previous centrally    planned system in 1990 and 1991. However, a weakening of government    resolve to maintain stabilization policies in the election year of    1996 contributed to renewal of inflationary pressures, spurred by    the budget deficit which exceeded 12%. The collapse of financial    pyramid schemes in early 1997--which had attracted deposits from a    substantial portion of Albania's population--triggered severe social    unrest which led to more than 1,500 deaths, widespread destruction    of property, and an 8% drop in GDP. The new government installed in    July 1997 has taken strong measures to restore public order and to    revive economic activity and trade. The economy continues to be    bolstered by remittances of some 20% of the labor force which works    abroad, mostly in Greece and Italy. These remittances supplement GDP    and help offset the large foreign trade deficit. Most agricultural    land was privatized in 1992, substantially improving peasant    incomes. In 1998, Albania probably recovered most if not all of the    7% drop in GDP of 1997.    GDP: purchasing power parity--$5 billion (1998 est.)    GDP--real growth rate: 7% (1998 est.)

She has strained them in some way, but she will  come out of it.\"    \"Praise the Lord!\" cried Mrs. Pepper, throwing her apron over her  head; and then she sobbed on, \"and thank you, sir--I can't ever thank  you--for--for--if Polly was blind, we might as well give up!\"    The next day, Phronsie, who had the doctor's permission to sit up, only  she was to be kept from taking cold, scampered around in stocking-feet  in search of her shoes, which she hadn't seen since she was first taken  sick.    \"Oh, I want on my very best shoes,\" she cried; \"can't I, mammy?\"    \"Oh, no, Phronsie; you must keep them nice,\" remonstrated her mother;  \"you can't wear 'em every-day, you know.\"    \"'Tisn't every-day,\" said Phronsie, slowly; \"it's only one day.\"    \"Well, and then you'll want 'em on again tomorrow,\" said her mother.    \"Oh, no, I won't!\" cried Phronsie; \"never, no more to-morrow, if I can  have 'em to-day; please, mammy dear!\"    Mrs. Pepper went to the lowest drawer in the high bureau, and took  therefrom a small parcel done up in white tissue paper. Slowly unrolling  this before the delighted eyes of the child, who stood patiently  waiting, she disclosed the precious red-topped shoes which Phronsie  immediately clasped to her bosom.    \"My own, very own shoes! whole mine!\" she cried, and trudged out into  the kitchen to put them on herself.    \"Hulloa!\" cried Dr. Fisher, coming in about a quarter of an hour later  to find her tugging laboriously at the buttons--\"new shoes! I declare!\"    \"My own!\" cried Phronsie, sticking out one foot for inspection, where  every button was in the wrong button-hole, \"and they've got red tops,  too!\"    \"So they have,\" said the doctor, getting down on the floor beside her;  \"beautiful red tops, aren't they?\"    \"Be-yew-ti-ful,\" sang the child delightedly.    \"Does Polly have new shoes every day?\" asked the doctor in a low voice,  pretending to examine the other foot.    Phronsie opened her eyes very wide at this.    \"Oh, no, she don't have anything, Polly don't.\"    \"And what does Polly want most of all--do you know? see if you can tell  me.\" And the doctor put on the most alluring expression that he could  muster.    \"Oh, I know!\" cried Phronsie, with a very wise look. \"There now,\" cried  the doctor, \"you're the girl for me! to think you know! so, what is it?\"    Phronsie got up very gravely, and with one shoe half on, she leaned over  and whispered in the doctor's ear:    \"A stove!\"    \"A what?\" said the doctor, looking at her, and then at the old, black  thing in the corner, that looked as if it were ashamed of itself; \"why,  she's got one.\"    \"Oh,\" said the child, \"it won't burn; and sometimes Polly cries, she  does, when she's all alone--and I see her.\"    \"Now,\" said the doctor, very sympathetically, \"that's too bad; that is!  and then what does she do?\"    \"Oh, Ben stuffs it up,\" said the child, laughing; \"and so does Polly  too, with paper; and then it all tumbles out quick; oh! just as quick!\"  And Phronsie shook her yellow head at the dismal remembrance.    \"Do you suppose,\" said the doctor, getting up, \"that you know of any  smart little girl around here, about four years old and that knows how  to button on her own red-topped shoes, that would like to go to ride  to-morrow morning in my carriage with me?    \"Oh, I do!\" cried Phronsie, hopping on one toe; \"it's me!\"    \"Very well, then,\" said Dr. Fisher, going to the bedroom door, \"we'll  lookout for to-morrow, then.\"    To poor Polly, lying in the darkened room, or sitting up in the big  rocking-chair--for Polly wasn't really very sick in other respects,  the disease having all gone into the merry brown eyes--the time seemed  interminable. Not to do anything! The very idea at any time would have  filled her active, wide-awake little body with horror; and now, here she  was!    \"Oh, dear, I can't bear it!\" she said, when she knew by the noise in the  kitchen that everybody was out there; so nobody heard, except a fat, old  black spider in the corner, and he didn't tell anyone!    \"I know it's a week,\" she said, \"since dinnertime! If Ben were only  well, to talk to me.\"    \"Oh, I say, Polly,\" screamed Joel at that moment running in, \"Ben's  a-comin' down the stairs!\"    \"Stop, Joe,\" said Mrs. Pepper; \"you shouldn't have told; he wanted to  surprise Polly.\"    \"Oh, is he!\" cried Polly, clasping her hands in rapture; \"mammy, can't I  take off this horrid bandage, and see him?\"    \"Dear me, no!\" said Mrs. Pepper, springing forward; \"not for the world,  Polly! Dr. Fisher'd have our ears off!\"    \"Well, I can hear, any way,\" said Polly, resigning herself to the  remaining comfort; \"here he is! oh, Ben!\"    \"There,\" said Ben, grasping Polly, bandage and all; \"now we're all  right; and say, Polly, you're a brick!\"    \"Mammy told me not to say that the other day,\" said Joel, with a very  virtuous air.    \"Can't help it,\" said Ben, who was a little wild over Polly, and  besides, he had been sick himself, and had borne a good deal too.    \"Now,\" said Mrs. Pepper, after the first excitement was over, \"you're  so comfortable together, and Phronsie don't want me now, I'll go to the  store; I must get some more work if Mr. Atkins'll give it to me.\"    \"I'll be all right now, mammy, that Ben's here,\" cried Polly, settling  back into her chair, with Phronsie on the stool at her feet.    \"I'm goin' to tell her stories, ma,\" cried Ben, \"so you needn't worry  about us.\"    \"Isn't it funny, Ben,\" said Polly, as the gate clicked after the mother,  \"to be sitting still, and telling stories in the daytime?\"    \"Rather funny!\" replied Ben.    \"Well, do go on,\" said Joel, as usual, rolling on the floor, in a  dreadful hurry for the story to begin. Little David looked up quietly,  as he sat on Ben's other side, his hands clasped tight together, just as  eager, though he said nothing.    \"Well; once upon a time,\" began Ben delightfully, and launched into one  of the stories that the children thought perfectly lovely.    \"Oh, Bensie,\" cried Polly, entranced, as they listened with bated  breath, \"however do you think of such nice things!\"    \"I've had time enough to think, the last week,\" said Ben, laughing, \"to  last a life-time!\"    \"Do go on,\" put in Joel, impatient at the delay.    \"Don't hurry him so,\" said Polly, reprovingly; \"he isn't strong.\"    \"Ben,\" said David, drawing a long breath, his eyes very big--, \"did he  really see a bear?\"    \"No,\" said Ben; \"oh! where was I?\"    \"Why, you said Tommy heard a noise,\" said Polly, \"and he thought it was  a bear.\"    \"Oh, yes,\" said Ben; \"I remember; 'twasn't a--\"    \"Oh, make it a bear, Ben!\" cried Joel, terribly disappointed; \"don't let  it be not a bear.\"    \"Why, I can't,\" said Ben; \"twouldn't sound true.\"    \"Never mind, make it sound true,\" insisted Joel; \"you can make anything  true.\"    \"Very well,\" said Ben, laughing; \"I suppose I must.\"    \"Make it two bears, Ben,\" begged little Phronsie.    \"Oh, no, Phronsie, that's too much,\" cried Joel; \"that'll spoil it; but  make it a big bear, do Ben, and have him bite him somewhere, and most  kill him.\"    \"Oh, Joel!\" cried Polly, while David's eyes got bigger than ever.    So Ben drew upon his powers as story-teller, to suit his exacting  audience, and was making his bear work havoc upon poor Tommy in a way  captivating to all, even Joel, when, \"Well, I declare,\" sounded Mrs.  Pepper's cheery voice coming in upon them, \"if this isn't comfortable!\"    \"Oh, mammy!\" cried Phronsie, jumping out of Polly's arms, whither she  had taken refuge during the thrilling tale, and running to her mother  who gathered her baby up, \"we've had a bear! a real, live bear, we have!  Ben made him!\"    \"Have you!\" said Mrs. Pepper, taking off her shawl, and laying her  parcel of work down on the table, \"now, that's nice!\"    \"Oh, mammy!\" cried Polly, \"it does seem so good to be all together  again!\"    \"And I thank the Lord!\" said Mrs. Pepper, looking down on her happy  little group; and the tears were in her eyes--\"and children, we ought to  be very good and please Him, for He's been so good to us.\"          THE CLOUD OVER THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE      When Phronsie, with many crows of delight, and much chattering, had  gotten fairly started the following morning on her much-anticipated  drive with the doctor, the whole family excepting Polly drawn up around  the door to see them off, Mrs. Pepper resolved to snatch the time and  run down for an hour or two to one of her customers who had long been  waiting for a little \"tailoring\" to be done for her boys.    \"Now, Joel,\" she said, putting on her bonnet before the cracked  looking-glass, \"you stay along of Polly; Ben must go up to bed, the  doctor said; and Davie's going to the store for some molasses; so you  and Polly must keep house.\"    \"Yes'm,\" said Joel; \"may I have somethin' to eat, ma?\"    \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Pepper; \"but don't you eat the new bread; you may have  as much as you want of the old.\"    \"Isn't there any molasses, mammy?\" asked Joel, as she bade Polly  good-bye! and gave her numberless charges \"to be careful of your eyes,\"  and \"not to let a crack of light in through the curtain,\" as the old  green paper shade was called.    \"No; if you're very hungry, you can eat bread,\" said Mrs. Pepper,  sensibly.    \"Joel,\" said Polly, after the mother had gone, \"I do wish you could read  to me.\"    \"Well, I can't,\" said Joel, glad he didn't know how; \"I thought the  minister was comin'.\"    \"Well, he was,\" said Polly, \"but mammy said he had to go out"]]]
