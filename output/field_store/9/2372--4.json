[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30560"],[0,"Music: An Art and a Language (#10)"],[1,"Suite    Theme    Inversion]    An excellent example from an orchestral work is the theme of the third  movement of Brahms's _C minor Symphony_, the second phrase of which is  an Inversion of the opening measures, _e.g._    [Music: Inversion]    II. Augmentation and Diminution; the length of the notes is doubled or  halved while their metrical relativity is maintained, _e.g._    [Music: BACH: Fugue No. 8, Book I    Theme    Augmentation]    [Music: BACH: Fugue No. IX, Book II    Theme    Diminution]    Augmentation is very frequent in modern literature when a composer, by  lengthening out the phraseology of a theme, wishes to gain for it  additional emphasis. Excellent examples are the closing measures of  Schumann's _Arabesque_, in which the reminiscence of the original  motto is most haunting, _e.g._,    [Music: Motto]    [Music: Motto augmented]    the Finale of Liszt's _Faust Symphony_, where the love theme of the  Gretchen movement is carried over and intoned by a solo baritone with  impressive effect, _e.g._    [Music]    [Music: In augmentation    _Das ewig Weibliche_]    III. Shifted Rhythm; the position of the subject in the measure is so  changed that the accents fall on different beats, _e.g._    [Music: BACH: Fugue No. V, Book II    Subject    Shifted]    IV. Stretto; (from the Italian verb \"stringere,\" to draw close) that  portion of a fugue, often the climax, where the entrances are  _crowded_ together, _i.e._, the imitating voice enters before the  leading voice has finished, _e.g._    [Music: _Fuga giocosa_, J.K. PAINE, op. 41    Subject]    The effect is obviously one of great concentration and dramatic  intensity--with a sense of impending climax--and its use is by no  means limited to fugal composition; being frequently found in all  large symphonic works of the classic and modern school. For a  magnificent example of the climactic effect produced by a Stretto,  witness the last part of Bach's Fugue in G major (see Supplement, Ex.  No. 16).    Although there is considerable complexity in any complete fugue, and  although it requires great concentration on the part of the listener,  we should avoid thinking of the form as mechanical in any derogatory  sense, but rather as a means to a definite artistic end. Certainly no  greater mistake can be made than that of considering Bach, the supreme  master of polyphonic writing, as too austere, too involved, for the  delight and edification of every-day mortals. Bach means brook, and  the name[41] is most appropriate; for Bach is a never ceasing stream  of musical life, the fountain-head from which spring the leading  tendencies of modern music. In these days when stress is laid on the  romantic element in music, on warm emotional appeal, it is well to  consider the quality so prevalent in Bach of spiritual vitality.  Exactly because the romantic element represents the human side of  music, it is subject to the whims of fashion and is liable to change  and decay. Bach carries us into the realm of universal ideas,  inexhaustible and changeless in their power to exalt. Schumann says  that \"Music owes to Bach what a religion owes to its founder\"; and it  is true that a knowledge of Bach is the beginning of musical wisdom.  By some, Bach is considered dry or too reserved for companionship with  ordinary human beings. Others carelessly assert that he has no melody.  Nothing can be further from the truth than these two misconceptions.  Bach surely is not dry, because his work abounds in such vitality of  rhythm. As Parry says, in his biography, \"No composer ever attained to  anything approaching the spontaneity, freshness, and winsomeness of  his dances, such as the gavottes, bourrees, passepieds and gigues in  the suites; while many of his great choruses and instrumental fugues  are inspired with a force of rhythmic movement which thrills the  hearer with a feeling of being swept into space out of the range of  common things.\" The charge of a lack of melody is the same which used  to be brought against Wagner. Instead of there being no melody, it is  _all_ melody, so that the partially musical, who lack the power of  sustained attention, are drowned in the flood of melodic outpouring. A  strong claim, in fact, may be made for Bach as a _popular_ composer in  the best sense of the term. Many of his colossal works, to be sure,  are heard but seldom, for they require the most highly trained  executive ability. But if the average music-lover will become familiar  with the French and English Suites, with the Preludes and Fugues of  the _Well-tempered Clavichord_, with some of the Violin Sonatas, he  will find for his imagination and mental machinery a food which, once  enjoyed, becomes indispensable. For his music has that greatest of  qualities in art as in human relationships--it wears well and _lasts_.  We all know that books which reveal everything at a first reading are  soon thrown aside, and that people whose depth of character and  sweetness of disposition we discern but slowly, often become our  life-long friends. Music which is too easily heard is identical with  that which is immediately forgotten. The first impulse created by any  great work of art is our longing to know it better. Its next attribute  is its power to arouse and hold our steady affection. These  observations may be applied literally to Bach's music, which can be  heard for a lifetime, never losing its appeal but continually  unfolding new beauties. Furthermore, in Bach, we feel the force of a  great character even more than the artistic skill with which the  personality is revealed. In this respect Bach in music is quite on a  par with Shakespeare in literature and Michael Angelo in plastic art.  With many musicians, there is so disconcerting and inexplicable a  discrepancy between their deeds as men and the artistic thoughts for  which they seem to be the unconscious media, that it is inspiring to  come into touch with one who rings true as a man whatever demands are  made upon him; whose music is free from morbidity or carnal blemish,  as pure as the winter wind, as elemental as the ocean, as uplifting as  the stars. In Bach let us always remember the noble human traits; for  the universal regard in which his work is held could never have come  merely from profound skill in workmanship, but is due chiefly to the  manly sincerity and emotional depth which are found therein. The  revival of his works, for which the world owes to Mendelssohn such a  debt, has been the single strongest factor in the development of music  during the 19th century; and their influence[42] is by no means yet at  an end, as may be seen from the glowing tributes paid to him by such  modern composers as Franck, d'Indy and Debussy.[43]    [Footnote 41: Beethoven, commenting on the name, majestically said:  \"He is no brook; he is the open sea!\"]    [Footnote 42: For a very suggestive article on this point by Philip  Greeley Clapp see the Musical Quarterly for April, 1916.]    [Footnote 43: Some eloquent comments on Bach's style and significance  may be found in Chapter III of _The Appreciation of Music_ by Surette  and Mason.]    Two additional fugues are now given in the Supplement (see Nos. 17 and  18) for the consideration of the student: the _Cat-Fugue_ of Domenico  Scarlatti, with its fantastic subject (said to have been suggested by  the walking of a favorite cat on the key-board) and the _Fuga Giocosa_  of John Knowles Paine, (the subject of which is the well-known  street-tune \"Rafferty's lost his pig\"). This latter example is not  only a brilliant piece of fugal writing but a typical manifestation of  American humor.    Several eulogies of the fugue are to be found in literature; three of  the most famous are herewith appended.        \"Hist, but a word, fair and soft!      Forth and be judged, Master Hugues!      Answer the question I've put you so oft:      What do you mean by your mountainous fugues?      See, we're alone in the loft.\"        --Browning, _Master Hugues of Saxe-Gotha_.    Throughout, a most fantastic description of fugal style.             \"Whence the sound      Of instruments, that made melodious chime,      Was heard, of harp and organ; and who mov'd      Their stops and chords was seen; his volant touch      Instinct through all proportions, low and high,      Fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue.\"        --Milton, _Paradise Lost_, Book XI.        \"Then rose the agitation, spreading through the infinite      cathedral to its agony; then was completed the passion of      the mighty fugue. The golden tubes of the organ which as yet      had but sobbed and muttered at intervals--gleaming amongst      clouds and surges of incense--threw up, as from fountains      unfathomable, columns of heart-shattering music. Choir and      antichoir were filling fast with unknown voices. Thou also,      Dying Trumpeter! with thy love which was victorious, and thy      anguish that was finishing, didst enter the tumult; trumpet      and echo--farewell love and farewell anguish--rang through      the dreadful Sanctus.\"        --From De Quincey's _Dream Fugue in the \"Vision of Sudden      Death_.\"    Truly a marvellous picture of the effect of a fugue in a great  medieval cathedral!          CHAPTER IV    THE MUSICAL SENTENCE      Before passing on to an explanation of the fundamental types of  musical structure, we must give some idea of the constituent parts of  the _Period_ in music. Every art has its units of expression: the  straight line, the curve, the arch, the poetic stanza and the prose  sentence. Just as poetry and prose are a series of stanzas or  sentences, so a musical composition is a succession of definitely  organized portions of thought and emotion, in terms of rhythm and  sound. In the heart of a composition, to be sure, we often find a  great freedom in the phraseology, comparable to blank verse or to a  rhapsodic kind of prose; but with few exceptions, such as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30576"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#10)"],[1," run de niggers from Merryville round  Longview.

Frank lives in Madisonville, Texas.      \"I was owned by Johnson Bell and born in New Orleans, in Louisiana.  'Cordin' to the bill of sale, I'm eighty-six years old, and my master  was a Frenchman and was real mean to me. He run saloon and kept bad  women. I don't know nothing 'bout my folks, if I even had any, 'cept  mama. They done tell me she was a bad woman and a French Creole.    \"I worked 'round master's saloon, kep' everything cleaned up after  they'd have all night drinkin' parties, men and women. I earned nickels  to tip off where to go, so's they could sow wild oats. I buried the  nickels under rocks. If master done cotch me with money, he'd take it  and beat me nearly to death. All I had to eat was old stuff those people  left, all scraps what was left.    \"One time some bad men come to master's and gits in a shootin' scrape  and they was two men kilt. I sho' did run. But master cotch me and make  me take them men to the river and tie a weight on them, so they'd sink  and the law wouldn't git him.    \"The clothes I wore was some master's old ones. They allus had holes in  them. Master he stay drunk nearly all time and was mean to his slave.  I'm the only one he had, and didn't cost him nothing. He have bill of  sale made, 'cause the law say he done stole me when I'm small child.  Master kept me in chains sometimes. He shot several men.    \"I didn't have no quarters but stays 'round the place and throw old sack  down and lay there and sleep. I'm 'fraid to run, 'cause master say he'd  hunt me and kill nigger.    \"When I's 'bout seventeen I marries a gal while master on drunk spell.

Although she remembers being told she was born on Christmas Day,       she does not know the year, but says she guesses she is about 88       years old.      \"Well, suh, the fus' question you ask me, 'bout how old I is, I don'  know 'zactly. You see it ain't like things is today. The young folks can  tell you their 'zact age and everything, but in those days we didn' pay  much 'tention to such things. But I knows I was bo'n in slavery times  and my pappy tol' me I was bo'n on a Christmas Day, but didn' 'member  jus' what year.    \"We was owned by Massa Lewis. Thomas Lewis was his name, and he was a  United States lawyer. I ain't gwineter talk 'gainst my white folks like  some cullud folks do, 'cause Massa Lewis was a mighty fine man and so  was Miss Mary, and they treated us mighty good.    \"Massa had a big plantation near Opelousas and I was bo'n there. I  'member the neighbor folks used to bring their cotton to the gin on his  farm for ginnin' and balin'. My mother's name was Della. That was all,  jus' Della. My pappy's name was Jim Blair. Both of them was from  Virginny, but from diff'rent places, and was brought to Louisiana by  nigger traders and sold to Massa Lewis. I know my pappy was lots older  than my mother and he had a wife and five chillen back in Virginny and  had been sold away from them out here. Then he and my mother started a  family out here. I don' know what become of his family back in Virginny,  'cause when we was freed he stayed with us.    \"When I got old enough I was housegirl and used to carry notes for Miss  Mary to the neighbors and bring back answers. Miss Mary would say, 'Now,  Virginny, you take this note to sech and sech place and be sure and be  back in sech and sech time,' and I allus was.    \"Massa Lewis had four or five families of us slaves, but we used to have  some fun after work and us young folks would skip rope and play ring  games. Durin' week days the field hands would work till the sun was jus'  goin' down and then the overseer would holler 'all right' and that was  the signal to quit. All hands knocked off Sat'day noon.    \"We didn' have no schoolin' or preachin'. Only the white folks had them,  but sometimes on Sundays we'd go up to the house and listen to the white  folks singin'.    \"Iffen any of the slave hands wanted to git married, Massa Lewis would  git them up to the house after supper time, have the man and woman jine  hands and then read to them outen a book.
