NUX VOMICA    Some breeders recommend nux vomica very highly as a tonic, and we  mention it so those who follow the directions in this book may have  their choice. Sixty drops of the tincture of nux vomica is put in two  gallons of the drinking water twice a week, during the molting season.  At other times in the year it is given when the flock seems to lack  liveliness or to be droopy for any reason.    The tincture of nux vomica is about the easiest of all the tonics to  use, as enough for a year can be kept in a small bottle and put into the  water without trouble at any time it is needed.      THE MEDICINE CHEST    Every pigeon-breeder should have a small box in which to keep a supply  of the medicines which may be needed. This box should contain a pot of  carbolated vaseline to be used on cuts or bruises, as in wing trouble.  There should be a four-ounce bottle of peroxide of hydrogen, a small  bottle of camphorated oil, an ounce or two of carbolic acid, a few  quinine capsules, a bottle of cod liver oil and a bottle filled with  kerosene. There should also be a medicine dropper, such as is used to  fill fountain pens, and a small sewing machine oil can to use in cases  of roup. Such a medicine chest will come handy many times a year.    Don't get into the habit of dosing your birds for every imaginary  trouble. If pigeons are given a dry, light house, good sound grain,  plenty of grit, salt, charcoal and perfectly pure water to drink, with  good facilities for bathing, there will be little call for use of  medicines. Only doctor sick birds when necessary, and then take them out  of the loft and keep them out until they are well. The careful  pigeon-breeder will always learn to know his birds by sight and will  notice any symptoms of disease as soon as they appear. Once any disease  is noticed, apply the remedy at once without giving the ailment  opportunity to become chronic.    If the directions given in this book are followed, the pigeon-breeder,  although he may start without practical knowledge of the business, will  be able to carry his birds along in good health and promote  productiveness in such a manner that he may anticipate the best results  from his work.      [Illustration]          CHAPTER VIII    MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION--CATCHING MATED PAIRS      When it is desired to catch mated pairs, take the catching net into the  fly with you. Drive all the pigeons out in the fly and shut them out of  the house. Then take another person with you and go into the fly. Watch  until a cock begins to drive a hen and trap him in the net, while your  helper watches the hen. Take the cock out of the net and hand it to your  helper, who will catch the hen. Then band the two, putting the band on  the right leg of the cock and on the left leg of the hen. If squabs are  banded in the nest, nearly all of them will be found banded correctly if  the band has been put on the right leg of the squab first hatched and on  the left leg of the one hatched later.      STARTING A LOFT    Buy from ten to fifty mated pairs, according to the amount with which  you decide to begin. Keep all the best squabs hatched during the year,  so cross-mating them as not to have nest mates mated up for breeding.  Dispose of all under-sized squabs, and when the birds have grown up sell  all those which prove inferior. In this way you will learn to manage  your loft and get your breeding stock at the lowest possible cost.      THE PRICE OF BREEDING STOCK    It does not pay to start with poor breeding stock. Buy of a reliable  breeder and pay a fair price. No one can afford to sell first-class  breeding stock except in certain seasons at less than $1.50 a pair in  large numbers or less than $2.00 a pair when from ten to twenty-five  pairs are sold in a lot. It is poor economy to buy common pigeons as  squab-breeders at any price and just as bad management to buy cheap  Homers and run the risk of getting old and worn out birds.      BEST WEIGHT FOR SQUABS    Squabs that weigh less than eight pounds to the dozen are not desirable,  as they sell at a price which drops rapidly as they run below eight  pounds to the dozen. It costs just as much to raise a dark-fleshed and  light-weight squab as it does to raise a big plump bird with white  flesh; and a pair of pigeons which produce dark squabs of light weights  should be disposed of. Select all the time for heavy weights in your  squabs and get the top of the market.      LENGTH OF BREEDING PERIOD    Pigeons will breed regularly for seven or eight years, so it is to the  interest of the breeders to keep only the best in his lofts. The good  breeder watches what kind of squabs each pair produces and keeps  selecting the best from time to time until he has a loft full which may  be depended upon.      DON'T OVERCROWD    Don't overcrowd your lofts. It is better to waste a little room than to  have too many birds together. Give each fifty pairs a room eight by ten  feet and a fly at least ten by twenty-four feet.      SQUAB HOMERS    Health and vigor are the foundation on which success must be built. The  well-bred squab Homer carries its head erect, its plumage is smooth and  sleek, and its neck carries the colors of the rain-bow. When it stands  still, it seems on wires and when you go in to your loft in the morning  and look over the flock any bird which does not in turn give you a  looking over is not fit for a breeder. The eye is the index of health of  pigeons. If the eye is dull or the bird sits winking in a listless  manner, there is something wrong about it. Sickly birds shun society and  mope in dark corners. The droppings should be noticed. If the birds are  healthy, there should be a fair proportion of pure white in them, and  they should be rather firm. The squab Homer in health is a beautiful  bird, alive every moment and noticing keenly everything that passes.      INCREASING PRICES    Squabs have constantly increased in price in the larger markets for  several years, and hundreds of new towns have come in with a call for  good squabs. Everyone who begins to raise squabs for the market makes  the demand for them larger. There is no danger of overdoing the business  and it will continue to grow larger as game birds decrease in numbers.  Many restaurants now serve squab when there is an order for quail on  toast, and those who like good things usually go back and want some more  of that same kind of \"quail.\" Good restaurants now keep squabs on hand  and put them on their tables under their proper name, having learned  that it pays to do so.      THE SOUTH JERSEY SQUAB DISTRICT    The great business of raising squabs which is carried on in South Jersey  started with one man and has spread out until almost every one in the  country for miles around Bridgeton keeps pigeons and sells squabs. About  7,000 squabs are sent out of this district every week, equal to 365,000  in a year, and there is never a time but these squabs sell as soon as  they reach the market at prices which make it very profitable to produce  them. Men, women and children raise squabs in this district, nearly  every one of them being sold in New York City.      THE PROFESSION OF SQUAB BREEDING    Only a few years ago the man who spent his time breeding pigeons was  thought to be engaged in a small business. Now it has become a  profession and is followed by all sorts of men as a profitable way of  putting in spare time. The professional man raises squabs as a  diversion, the clerk or shop operative keeps a loft to help out on his  income, young men pay their way through college on the profits of the  squab business, old men who have got beyond the harder work of life make  a good living from squabs; and still the insistent food markets call for  more squabs at better prices. There is no risk in going into the squab  business, if the birds are properly cared for.      REGULARITY    Have a certain time to do all the work and work to the schedule you have  prepared. Clean the house on a certain day in the week, kill the squabs  on the day which best suits your market. Feed as nearly at the same time  every day as possible, for the birds soon learn to know when feeding  time comes, and the squabs even learn to know when to look for the  parents to feed them. Keep everything going like clock work, and the  work will be properly done and the birds thrive better for the regular  habits they learn.      GO QUIETLY    There will always be a number of birds sitting, others will be feeding  the young, and quick motions or loud noises disturb them and cause them  to stop feeding or to leave their nests. Keep the birds tame by going  among them but go quietly.      THE BEST AGE    A pair of pigeons begin to breed at about six months of age, but young  birds are not very profitable as breeders. After they are one year old  they are in full working condition and for the next seven or eight years  may be depended on to produce regularly, if they are the right kind of  stock.      DON'T KILL TOO YOUNG    Do not kill your squabs too young. They should be killed just before  they are ready to leave the nest, but not before their flesh has become  firm and solid. A squab which is killed too young never brings a good  price, as the buyers in the cities know one immediately they have felt  of it, and a few squabs which have been killed too soon decrease the  price of the whole package. Remember that the price paid for squabs in a  given package is made on the basis of all of them being as poor as the  poorest in the package.      MICE IN NESTS    If you find some of your squabs smashed flat in the nests, look out for  mice. These little pests like to nest with a pair of pigeons, and  particularly in cold weather have a fashion of crawling between the  parent bird and the squab. This causes the parent to move about and kill  the young. To kill the mice, take a large cigar box--or any box of about  that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37904"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 4, No. 4, November 1, 1851 (#10)"],[1," for a  companion in his pursuits, who was his intelligent amanuensis and  correspondent as well as indefatigable nurse.[1]    I forbear enlarging on matters too professional for present detail. During  the night after my arrival he sustained an attack of severe fainting, which  convinced me still further of his great personal weakness. An ennobling  philosophy, however, gave him support, and in the morning he had again been  refreshed by a sleep of some few hours' duration. I renewed to him and to  his family the hopes and the discouragements in his case. Never was  information of so grave a cast received by any individual in a calmer  spirit. He said little as to his prospects of recovery. Upon my taking  leave of him, however, shortly after, in the morning, I am convinced from  his manner that he shared my apprehensions of a fatal termination of his  disorder. Nature, however strong in her gifted child, had now her healthful  rights largely invaded. His constitutional buoyancy and determination, by  leading him to slight that distant and thorough attention demanded by  primary symptoms, doubtless contributed to their subsequent aggravation.    I shall say but a few words more on this agonizing topic. The letters which  I received, after my return home, communicated at times some cheering facts  of renovation, but on the whole, discouraging demonstrations of augmenting  illness, and lessened hope, were their prominent characteristics. A letter  to me from his son-in-law, of the 14th of September, announced: \"Mr. Cooper  died, apparently without much pain, to-day at half-past one, P.M., leaving  his family, although prepared by his gradual failure, in deep affliction.  He would have been sixty-two years old to-morrow.\"    A life of such uniform and unparalleled excellence and service, a career so  brilliant and honorable, closed in a befitting manner, and was crowned by a  death of quiet resignation. Conscious of his approaching dissolution, his  intelligence seemed to glow with increased fulness as his prostrated frame  yielded by degrees to the last summons. It is familiarly known to his most  intimate friends, that for some considerable period prior to his fatal  illness, he appropriated liberal portions of his time to the investigation  of scriptural truths, and that his convictions were ripe in Christian  doctrines. With assurances of happiness in the future, he graciously  yielded up his spirit to the disposal of its Creator. His death, which must  thus have been the beginning of a serene and more blessed life to him, is  universally regarded as a national loss.    Will you allow me to add a few words to this letter, already perhaps of  undue extent. It has been my gratification during a life of some duration  to have become personally acquainted with many eminent characters in the  different walks of professional and literary avocation. I never knew an  individual more thoroughly imbued with higher principles of action than Mr.  Cooper: he acted upon principles, and fully comprehended the principles  upon which he acted. Casual observers could scarcely, at times, understand  and appreciate his motives or conduct. An independence of character worthy  of the highest respect, and a natural boldness of temper which led him to a  frank, emphatic, and intrepid utterance of his thoughts and sentiments,  were uncongenial to that large class of people, who, from the want of moral  courage, or a feeble physical temperament, habitually conform to public  opinion, and endeavor to conciliate the world. Mr. Cooper was one of the  most genuine Americans in his tone of mind, in manly self-reliance, in  sympathy with the scenery, the history, and the constitution of his  country, which it has ever been my lot to know. His genius was American,  fresh, vigorous, independent, and devoted to native subjects. The  opposition he met with on his return from Europe, in consequence of his  patriotic, though, perhaps, injudicious attempts to point out the faults  and duties of his countrymen, threw him reluctantly on the defensive, and  sometimes gave an antagonistic manner to his intercourse; but, whoever,  recognizing his intellectual superiority, and respecting his integrity of  purpose, met him candidly, in an open, cordial and generous spirit, soon  found in Mr. Cooper an honest man, and a thorough patriot.    How strongly is impressed upon my memory his personal appearance, so often  witnessed during his rambles in Broadway and amidst the haunts of this busy  population. His phrenological development might challenge comparison with  that of the most favored of mortals. His manly figure, high, prominent  brow, clear and fine gray eye, and royal bearing, revealed the man of will  and intelligence. His intellectual hardihood was remarkable. He worked upon  a novel with the patient industry of a man of business, and set down every  fact of costume, action, expression, local feature, and detail of maritime  operations or woodland experience, with a kind of consciousness and  precision that produced a Flemish exactitude of detail, while in portraying  action, he seemed to catch by virtue of an eagle glance and an heroic  temperament, the very spirit of his occasion and convey it to the reader's  nerves and heart, as well as to his understanding. Herein Mr. Cooper was a  man of unquestionable originality. As to his literary services, some idea  may be formed of the consideration in which they are held by the almost  countless editions of many of his works in his own country, and their  circulation abroad by translations into almost every living tongue.    I may add a word or two on the extent of his sympathies with humanity. What  a love he cherished for superior talents in every ennobling pursuit in  life--how deep an interest he felt in the fortunes of his scientific and  literary friends--what gratification he enjoyed in the physical inquiries  of Dekay and Le Conte, the muse of Halleck and of Bryant, the painting of  Cole, the sculpture of Greenough! Dunlap, were he speaking, might tell you  of his gratuities to the unfortunate playwright and the dramatic performer.  With the mere accumulators of money--those golden calves whose hearts are  as devoid of emotion as their brains of the faculty of cogitation--he held  no congenial communion at any time: they could not participate in the  fruition of his pastime; and he felt in himself an innate superiority in  the gifts with which nature had endowed him. He was ever vigilant, a keen  observer of men and things; and in conversation frank and emphatic. It was  a gratifying spectacle to encounter him with old Col. Trumbull, the  historical painter, descanting on the many excellencies of Cole's pencil,  in the delineation of American forest-scenery--a theme the richest in the  world for Mr. Cooper's contemplation. A Shylock with his money-bags never  glutted over his possessions with a happier feeling than did these two  eminent individuals--the venerable Colonel with his patrician dignity, and  Cooper with his somewhat aristocratic bearing, yet democratic sentiment;  the one fruitful with the glories of the past, the other big with the  stirring events of his country's progress, in the refinement of arts, and  national power. Trumbull was one of the many old men I knew who delighted  in Cooper's writings, and who in conversation dwelt upon his captivating  genius.    To his future biographer Mr. Cooper has left the pleasing duty rightly to  estimate the breadth and depth of his powerful intellect--psychologically  to investigate the development and functions of that cerebral organ, which  for so many years, with such rapid succession and variety, poured out the  creations of poetic thought and descriptive illustration--to determine the  value of his capacious mind by the influence which, in the dawn of American  literature, it has exercised, in rearing the intellectual fabric of his  country's greatness--and to unfold the secret springs of those  disinterested acts of charity to the poor and needy, which signalized his  conduct as a professor of religious truth, and a true exampler of the  Christian graces. He has unquestionably done more to make known to the  transatlantic world his country, her scenery, her characteristics, her  aboriginal inhabitants, her history, than all preceding writers. His death  may well be pronounced a national calamity. By common consent he long  occupied an enviable place--the highest rank in American literature. To  adopt the quaint phraseology of old Thomas Fuller, the felling of so mighty  an oak must needs cause the increase of much underwood. Who will fill the  void occasioned by his too early departure from among us, time alone must  determine. With much consideration, I remain,                                  Dear sir, yours most truly,                                JOHN W. FRANCIS.      PUBLIC HONORS TO THE MEMORY OF MR. COOPER.    In the last number of the _International_ we were able merely to announce  the death of our great countryman Mr. Cooper. The following account of  proceedings in reference to the event is compiled mainly from the _Evening  Post_.    A meeting of literary men, and others, was held at the City Hall in  New-York, on the 25th of September, for the purpose of taking the necessary  measures for rendering fit honors to the memory of the deceased author.  Rufus W. Griswold, calling the meeting to order, said it had been convened  to do justice to the memory of the most illustrious American who had died  in the present century. Since the design of such a meeting had first been  formed, a consultation among Mr. Cooper's friends had been held, and it had  been determined that the present should be only a preparatory meeting, for  the making of such arrangements as should be thought necessary for a more  suitable demonstration of respect for that eminent person, whose name, more  completely than that of any of his"]]]
