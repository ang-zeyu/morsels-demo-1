A second expedition is made, lasting longer than the  first; and, though my retreat is effected without great precipitation,  not an Anthophora has touched me with her sting, nor even shown  herself disposed to fall upon the aggressor.    This success emboldens me. I remain permanently in front of the work  in progress, continually removing lumps of earth filled with cells,  spilling the liquid honey on the ground, eviscerating larvae and  crushing the Bees busily occupied in their nests. All this devastation  results merely in arousing a louder hum in the swarm and is not  followed by any hostile demonstration. The Anthophorae whose cells are  not hurt go about their labours as if nothing unusual were happening  round about them; those whose dwellings are overturned try to repair  them, or hover distractedly in front of the ruins; but none of them  seems inclined to swoop down upon the author of the damage. At most, a  few, more irritated than the rest, come at intervals and hover before  my face, confronting me at a distance of a couple of inches, and then  fly away, after a few moments of this curious inspection.    Despite the selection of a common site for their nests, which might  suggest an attempt at communistic interests among the Anthophorae,  these Bees, therefore, obey the egotistical law of each one for  himself and do not know how to band themselves together to repel an  enemy who threatens one and all. Taken singly, the Anthophora does not  even know how to dash at the enemy who is ravaging her cells and drive  him away with her stings; the pacific creature hastily leaves its  dwelling when disturbed by undermining and escapes in a crippled  state, sometimes even mortally wounded, without thinking of making use  of its venomous sting, except when it is seized and handled. Many  other Hymenoptera, honey-gatherers or hunters, are quite as  spiritless; and I can assert to-day, after a long experience, that  only the Social Hymenoptera, the Hive-bees, the Common Wasps and the  Bumble-bees, know how to devise a common defence; and only they dare  fall singly upon the aggressor, to wreak an individual vengeance.    Thanks to this unexpected lack of spirit in the Mason-bee, I was able  for hours to pursue my investigations at my leisure, seated on a stone  in the midst of the murmuring and distracted swarm, without receiving  a single sting, though I took no precautions whatever. Country-folk,  happening to pass and beholding me seated, unperturbed, in the midst  of the whirl of Bees, stopped aghast to ask me whether I had bewitched  them, whether I charmed them, since I appeared to have nothing to fear  from them:    \"_Me, moun bel ami, li-z-ave doun escounjurado que vous pougnioun pas,  caneu de sort!_\"    My miscellaneous impedimenta spread over the ground, boxes, glass jars  and tubes, tweezers and magnifying-glasses, were certainly regarded by  these good people as the implements of my wizardry.    We will now proceed to examine the cells. Some are still open and  contain only a more or less complete store of honey. Others are  hermetically sealed with an earthen lid. The contents of these latter  vary greatly. Sometimes we find the larva of a Bee which has finished  its mess or is on the point of finishing it; sometimes a larva, white  like the first, but more corpulent and of a different shape; at other  times honey with an egg floating on the surface. The honey is liquid  and sticky, with a brownish colour and a very strong, repulsive smell.  The egg is of a beautiful white, cylindrical in shape, slightly curved  into an arc, a fifth or a sixth of an inch in length and not quite a  twenty-fifth of an inch in thickness; it is the egg of the Anthophora.    In a few cells this egg is floating all alone on the surface of the  honey; in others, very numerous these, we see, lying on the egg of the  Anthophora, as on a sort of raft, a young Sitaris-grub with the shape  and the dimensions which I have described above, that is to say, with  the shape and the dimensions which the creature possesses on leaving  the egg. This is the enemy within the gates.    When and how did it get in? In none of the cells where I have observed  it was I able to distinguish a fissure which could have allowed it to  enter; they are all sealed in a quite irreproachable manner. The  parasite therefore established itself in the honey-warehouse before  the warehouse was closed; on the other hand, the open cells, full of  honey, but as yet without the egg of the Anthophora, are always free  from parasites. It is therefore during the laying, or afterwards, when  the Anthophora is occupied in plastering the door of the cell, that  the young larva gains admittance. It is impossible to decide by  experiment to which of these two periods we must ascribe the  introduction of the Sitares into the cell; for, however peaceable the  Anthophora may be, it is evident that we cannot hope to witness what  happens in the cell at the moment when she is laying an egg or at the  moment when she is making the lid. But a few attempts will soon  convince us that the only second which would allow the Sitaris to  establish itself in the home of the Bee is the very second when the  egg is laid on the surface of the honey.    Let us take an Anthophora-cell full of honey and furnished with an egg  and, after removing the lid, place it in a glass tube with a few  Sitaris-grubs. The grubs do not appear at all eager for this wealth of  nectar placed within their reach; they wander at random about the  tube, run about the outside of the cell, sometimes happen upon the  edge of the orifice and very rarely venture inside. When they do, they  do not go far in and they come out again at once. If one happens to  reach the honey, which only half fills the cell, it tries to escape as  soon as it has perceived the shifting nature of the sticky soil upon  which it was about to enter; but, tottering at every step, because of  the viscous matter clinging to its feet, it often ends by falling back  into the honey, where it dies of suffocation.    Again, we may experiment as follows: having prepared a cell as before,  we place a larva most carefully on its inner wall, or else on the  surface of the food itself. In the first case, the larva hastens to  leave the cell; in the second case, it struggles awhile on the surface  of the honey and ends by getting so completely caught that, after a  thousand efforts to gain the shore, it is swallowed up in the viscous  lake.    In short, all attempts to establish the Sitaris-grub in an  Anthophora-cell provisioned with honey and furnished with an egg are  no more successful than those which I made with cells whose store of  food had already been broached by the larva of the Bee, as described  above. It is therefore certain that the Sitaris-grub does not leave  the fleece of the Mason-bee when the Bee is in her cell or at the  entrance to it, in order itself to make a rush for the coveted honey;  for this honey would inevitably cause its death, if it happened by  accident to touch the perilous surface merely with the tip of its  tarsi.    Since we cannot admit that the Sitaris-grub leaves the furry corselet  of its hostess to slip unseen into the cell, whose orifice is not yet  wholly walled up, at the moment when the Anthophora is building her  door, all that remains to investigate is the second at which the egg  is being laid. Remember in the first place that the young Sitaris  which we find in a closed cell is always placed on the egg of the Bee.  We shall see in a minute that this egg not merely serves as a raft for  the tiny creature floating on a very treacherous lake, but also  constitutes the first and indispensable part of its diet. To get at  this egg, situated in the centre of the lake of honey, to reach, at  all costs, this raft, which is also its first ration, the young larva  evidently possesses some means of avoiding the fatal contact of the  honey; and this means can be provided only by the actions of the Bee  herself.    In the second place, observations repeated _ad nauseam_ have shown me  that at no period do we find in each invaded cell more than a single  Sitaris, in one or other of the forms which it successively assumes.  Yet there are several young larvae established in the silky tangle of  the Bee's thorax, all eagerly watching for the propitious moment at  which to enter the dwelling in which they are to continue their  development. How then does it happen that these larvae, goaded by such  an appetite as one would expect after seven or eight months' complete  abstinence, instead of all rushing together into the first cell within  reach, on the contrary enter the various cells which the Bee is  provisioning one at a time and in perfect order? Some action must take  place here independent of the Sitares.    To satisfy those two indispensable conditions, the arrival of the  larva upon the egg without crossing the honey and the introduction of  a single larva among all those waiting in the fleece of the Bee, there  can be only one explanation, which is to suppose that, at the moment  when the Anthophora's egg is half out of the oviduct, one of the  Sitares which have hastened from the thorax to the tip of the abdomen,  one more highly favoured by its position, instantly settles upon the  egg, a bridge too narrow for two, and with it reaches the surface of  the honey. The impossibility of otherwise fulfilling the two  conditions which I have stated gives to the explanation which I am  offering a degree of certainty almost equivalent to that which would  be furnished by direct observation, which is here, unfortunately,  impracticable. This presupposes, it is true, in the microscopic little  creature destined to live in a place where so many dangers threaten it  from the first, an astonishingly rational inspiration, which adapts  the means to the end with amazing logic.

One fault of Nat's gave the Bhaers much anxiety, although they saw how  it had been strengthened by fear and ignorance. I regret to say that  Nat sometimes told lies. Not very black ones, seldom getting deeper than  gray, and often the mildest of white fibs; but that did not matter, a  lie is a lie, and though we all tell many polite untruths in this queer  world of ours, it is not right, and everybody knows it.    \"You cannot be too careful; watch your tongue, and eyes, and hands, for  it is easy to tell, and look, and act untruth,\" said Mr. Bhaer, in one  of the talks he had with Nat about his chief temptation.    \"I know it, and I don't mean to, but it's so much easier to get along  if you ain't very fussy about being exactly true. I used to tell 'em  because I was afraid of father and Nicolo, and now I do sometimes  because the boys laugh at me. I know it's bad, but I forget,\" and Nat  looked much depressed by his sins.    \"When I was a little lad I used to tell lies! Ach! what fibs they were,  and my old grandmother cured me of it how, do you think? My parents had  talked, and cried, and punished, but still did I forget as you. Then  said the dear old grandmother, 'I shall help you to remember, and put a  check on this unruly part,' with that she drew out my tongue and snipped  the end with her scissors till the blood ran. That was terrible, you  may believe, but it did me much good, because it was sore for days, and  every word I said came so slowly that I had time to think. After that I  was more careful, and got on better, for I feared the big scissors. Yet  the dear grandmother was most kind to me in all things, and when she lay  dying far away in Nuremberg, she prayed that little Fritz might love God  and tell the truth.\"    \"I never had any grandmothers, but if you think it will cure me, I'll  let you snip my tongue,\" said Nat, heroically, for he dreaded pain, yet  did wish to stop fibbing.    Mr. Bhaer smiled, but shook his head.    \"I have a better way than that, I tried it once before and it worked  well. See now, when you tell a lie I will not punish you, but you shall  punish me.\"    \"How?\" asked Nat, startled at the idea.    \"You shall ferule me in the good old-fashioned way; I seldom do it  myself, but it may make you remember better to give me pain than to feel  it yourself.\"    \"Strike you? Oh, I couldn't!\" cried Nat.    \"Then mind that tripping tongue of thine. I have no wish to be hurt, but  I would gladly bear much pain to cure this fault.\"    This suggestion made such an impression on Nat, that for a long time he  set a watch upon his lips, and was desperately accurate, for Mr. Bhaer  judged rightly, that love of him would be more powerful with Nat that  fear for himself. But alas! one sad day Nat was off his guard, and when  peppery Emil threatened to thrash him, if it was he who had run over his  garden and broken down his best hills of corn, Nat declared he didn't,  and then was ashamed to own up that he did do it, when Jack was chasing  him the night before.    He thought no one would find it out, but Tommy happened to see him, and  when Emil spoke of it a day or two later, Tommy gave his evidence, and  Mr. Bhaer heard it. School was over, and they were all standing about in  the hall, and Mr. Bhaer had just set down on the straw settee to enjoy  his frolic with Teddy; but when he heard Tommy and saw Nat turn scarlet,  and look at him with a frightened face, he put the little boy down,  saying, \"Go to thy mother, bubchen, I will come soon,\" and taking Nat by  the hand led him into the school and shut the door.    The boys looked at one another in silence for a minute, then Tommy  slipped out and peeping in at the half-closed blinds, beheld a sight  that quite bewildered him. Mr. Bhaer had just taken down the long rule  that hung over his desk, so seldom used that it was covered with dust.    \"My eye! He's going to come down heavy on Nat this time. Wish I hadn't  told,\" thought good-natured Tommy, for to be feruled was the deepest  disgrace at this school.    \"You remember what I told you last time?\" said Mr. Bhaer, sorrowfully,  not angrily.    \"Yes; but please don't make me, I can't bear it,\" cried Nat, backing  up against the door with both hands behind him, and a face full of  distress.    \"Why don't he up and take it like a man? I would,\" thought Tommy, though  his heart beat fast at the sight.    \"I shall keep my word, and you must remember to tell the truth. Obey me,  Nat, take this and give me six good strokes.\"    Tommy was so staggered by this last speech that he nearly tumbled down  the bank, but saved himself, and hung onto the window ledge, staring in  with eyes as round as the stuffed owl's on the chimney-piece.    Nat took the rule, for when Mr. Bhaer spoke in that tone everyone obeyed  him, and, looking as scared and guilty as if about to stab his master,  he gave two feeble blows on the broad hand held out to him. Then  he stopped and looked up half-blind with tears, but Mr. Bhaer said  steadily:    \"Go on, and strike harder.\"    As if seeing that it must be done, and eager to have the hard task soon  over, Nat drew his sleeve across his eyes and gave two more quick hard  strokes that reddened the hand, yet hurt the giver more.    \"Isn't that enough?\" he asked in a breathless sort of tone.    \"Two more,\" was all the answer, and he gave them, hardly seeing where  they fell, then threw the rule all across the room, and hugging the kind  hand in both his own, laid his face down on it sobbing out in a passion  of love, and shame, and penitence:    \"I will remember! Oh! I will!\"    Then Mr. Bhaer put an arm about him, and said in a tone as compassionate  as it had just now been firm:    \"I think you will. Ask the dear God to help you, and try to spare us  both another scene like this.\"    Tommy saw no more, for he crept back to the hall, looking so excited and  sober that the boys crowded round him to ask what was being done to Nat.    In a most impressive whisper Tommy told them, and they looked as if the  sky was about to fall, for this reversing the order of things almost  took their breath away.    \"He made me do the same thing once,\" said Emil, as if confessing a crime  of the deepest dye.    \"And you hit him? dear old Father Bhaer? By thunder, I'd just like  to see you do it now!\" said Ned, collaring Emil in a fit of righteous  wrath.    \"It was ever so long ago. I'd rather have my head cut off than do it  now,\" and Emil mildly laid Ned on his back instead of cuffing him, as he  would have felt it his duty to do on any less solemn occasion.    \"How could you?\" said Demi, appalled at the idea.    \"I was hopping mad at the time, and thought I shouldn't mind a  bit, rather like it perhaps. But when I'd hit uncle one good crack,  everything he had ever done for me came into my head all at once  somehow, and I couldn't go on. No sir! If he'd laid me down and walked  on me, I wouldn't have minded, I felt so mean,\" and Emil gave himself a  good thump in the chest to express his sense of remorse for the past.    \"Nat's crying like anything, and feels no end sorry, so don't let's say  a word about it; will we?\" said tender-hearted Tommy.    \"Of course we won't, but it's awful to tell lies,\" and Demi looked as if  he found the awfulness much increased when the punishment fell not upon  the sinner, but his best Uncle Fritz.    \"Suppose we all clear out, so Nat can cut upstairs if he wants to,\"  proposed Franz, and led the way to the barn, their refuge in troublous  times.    Nat did not come to dinner, but Mrs. Jo took some up to him, and said a  tender word, which did him good, though he could not look at her. By and  by the lads playing outside heard the violin, and said among themselves:  \"He's all right now.\" He was all right, but felt shy about going down,  till opening his door to slip away into the woods, he found Daisy  sitting on the stairs with neither work nor doll, only her little  handkerchief in her hand, as if she had been mourning for her captive  friend.    \"I'm going to walk; want to come?\" asked Nat, trying to look as if  nothing was the matter, yet feeling very grateful for her silent  sympathy, because he fancied everyone must look upon him as a wretch.    \"Oh yes!\" and Daisy ran for her hat, proud to be chosen as a companion  by one of the big boys.    The others saw them go, but no one followed, for boys have a great deal  more delicacy than they get credit for, and the lads instinctively felt  that, when in disgrace, gentle little Daisy was their most congenial  friend.    The walk did Nat good, and he came home quieter than usual, but looking  cheerful again, and hung all over with daisy-chains made by his little  playmate while he lay on the grass and told her stories.    No one said a word about the scene of the morning, but its effect was  all the more lasting for that reason, perhaps. Nat tried his very best,  and found much help, not only from the earnest little prayers he prayed  to his Friend in heaven, but also in the patient care of the earthly  friend whose kind hand he never touched without remembering that it had  willingly borne pain for his sake.        CHAPTER V. PATTYPANS    \"What's the matter, Daisy?\"    \"The boys won't let me play with them.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"They say girls can't play football.\"    \"They can, for I've done it!\" and Mrs. Bhaer laughed at the remembrance  of certain youthful frolics.    \"I know I can play; Demi and I used to, and have nice times, but he  won't let me now because the other boys laugh at him,\" and Daisy looked  deeply grieved at her brother's hardness of heart.    \"On the whole, I think he is right, deary. It's all very well when you  two are alone, but it is too rough a game for you with a dozen boys; so  I'd find some nice little play for myself.\"    \"I'm tired of playing alone!\" and Daisy's tone was very mournful.    \"I'll play with you by and by, but just now I must"]]]
