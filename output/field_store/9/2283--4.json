The view thence of Florence is most  beautiful--far better than the hackneyed view of Fiesole. It is the view  that Alessio Baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures. That  man had a decided feeling for landscape. Decidedly. But who looks at it  to-day? Ah, the world is too much for us.\"    Miss Bartlett had not heard of Alessio Baldovinetti, but she knew  that Mr. Eager was no commonplace chaplain. He was a member of the  residential colony who had made Florence their home. He knew the people  who never walked about with Baedekers, who had learnt to take a siesta  after lunch, who took drives the pension tourists had never heard of,  and saw by private influence galleries which were closed to them. Living  in delicate seclusion, some in furnished flats, others in Renaissance  villas on Fiesole's slope, they read, wrote, studied, and exchanged  ideas, thus attaining to that intimate knowledge, or rather perception,  of Florence which is denied to all who carry in their pockets the  coupons of Cook.    Therefore an invitation from the chaplain was something to be proud of.  Between the two sections of his flock he was often the only link, and it  was his avowed custom to select those of his migratory sheep who seemed  worthy, and give them a few hours in the pastures of the permanent. Tea  at a Renaissance villa? Nothing had been said about it yet. But if it  did come to that--how Lucy would enjoy it!    A few days ago and Lucy would have felt the same. But the joys of life  were grouping themselves anew. A drive in the hills with Mr. Eager and  Miss Bartlett--even if culminating in a residential tea-party--was  no longer the greatest of them. She echoed the raptures of Charlotte  somewhat faintly. Only when she heard that Mr. Beebe was also coming did  her thanks become more sincere.    \"So we shall be a partie carree,\" said the chaplain. \"In these days of  toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of  purity. Andate via! andate presto, presto! Ah, the town! Beautiful as it  is, it is the town.\"    They assented.    \"This very square--so I am told--witnessed yesterday the most sordid of  tragedies. To one who loves the Florence of Dante and Savonarola  there is something portentous in such desecration--portentous and  humiliating.\"    \"Humiliating indeed,\" said Miss Bartlett. \"Miss Honeychurch happened to  be passing through as it happened. She can hardly bear to speak of it.\"  She glanced at Lucy proudly.    \"And how came we to have you here?\" asked the chaplain paternally.    Miss Bartlett's recent liberalism oozed away at the question. \"Do  not blame her, please, Mr. Eager. The fault is mine: I left her  unchaperoned.\"    \"So you were here alone, Miss Honeychurch?\" His voice suggested  sympathetic reproof but at the same time indicated that a few harrowing  details would not be unacceptable. His dark, handsome face drooped  mournfully towards her to catch her reply.    \"Practically.\"    \"One of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home,\" said Miss  Bartlett, adroitly concealing the sex of the preserver.    \"For her also it must have been a terrible experience. I trust that  neither of you was at all--that it was not in your immediate proximity?\"    Of the many things Lucy was noticing to-day, not the least remarkable  was this: the ghoulish fashion in which respectable people will nibble  after blood. George Emerson had kept the subject strangely pure.    \"He died by the fountain, I believe,\" was her reply.    \"And you and your friend--\"    \"Were over at the Loggia.\"    \"That must have saved you much. You have not, of course, seen the  disgraceful illustrations which the gutter Press--This man is a public  nuisance; he knows that I am a resident perfectly well, and yet he goes  on worrying me to buy his vulgar views.\"    Surely the vendor of photographs was in league with Lucy--in the eternal  league of Italy with youth. He had suddenly extended his book before  Miss Bartlett and Mr. Eager, binding their hands together by a long  glossy ribbon of churches, pictures, and views.    \"This is too much!\" cried the chaplain, striking petulantly at one of  Fra Angelico's angels. She tore. A shrill cry rose from the vendor. The  book it seemed, was more valuable than one would have supposed.    \"Willingly would I purchase--\" began Miss Bartlett.    \"Ignore him,\" said Mr. Eager sharply, and they all walked rapidly away  from the square.    But an Italian can never be ignored, least of all when he has a  grievance. His mysterious persecution of Mr. Eager became relentless;  the air rang with his threats and lamentations. He appealed to Lucy;  would not she intercede? He was poor--he sheltered a family--the tax on  bread. He waited, he gibbered, he was recompensed, he was dissatisfied,  he did not leave them until he had swept their minds clean of all  thoughts whether pleasant or unpleasant.    Shopping was the topic that now ensued. Under the chaplain's guidance  they selected many hideous presents and mementoes--florid little  picture-frames that seemed fashioned in gilded pastry; other little  frames, more severe, that stood on little easels, and were carven out  of oak; a blotting book of vellum; a Dante of the same material; cheap  mosaic brooches, which the maids, next Christmas, would never tell from  real; pins, pots, heraldic saucers, brown art-photographs; Eros and  Psyche in alabaster; St. Peter to match--all of which would have cost  less in London.    This successful morning left no pleasant impressions on Lucy. She had  been a little frightened, both by Miss Lavish and by Mr. Eager, she knew  not why. And as they frightened her, she had, strangely enough, ceased  to respect them. She doubted that Miss Lavish was a great artist. She  doubted that Mr. Eager was as full of spirituality and culture as she  had been led to suppose. They were tried by some new test, and they were  found wanting. As for Charlotte--as for Charlotte she was exactly the  same. It might be possible to be nice to her; it was impossible to love  her.    \"The son of a labourer; I happen to know it for a fact. A mechanic of  some sort himself when he was young; then he took to writing for the  Socialistic Press. I came across him at Brixton.\"    They were talking about the Emersons.    \"How wonderfully people rise in these days!\" sighed Miss Bartlett,  fingering a model of the leaning Tower of Pisa.    \"Generally,\" replied Mr. Eager, \"one has only sympathy for their  success. The desire for education and for social advance--in these  things there is something not wholly vile. There are some working men  whom one would be very willing to see out here in Florence--little as  they would make of it.\"    \"Is he a journalist now?\" Miss Bartlett asked.    \"He is not; he made an advantageous marriage.\"    He uttered this remark with a voice full of meaning, and ended with a  sigh.    \"Oh, so he has a wife.\"    \"Dead, Miss Bartlett, dead. I wonder--yes I wonder how he has the  effrontery to look me in the face, to dare to claim acquaintance with  me. He was in my London parish long ago. The other day in Santa Croce,  when he was with Miss Honeychurch, I snubbed him. Let him beware that he  does not get more than a snub.\"    \"What?\" cried Lucy, flushing.    \"Exposure!\" hissed Mr. Eager.    He tried to change the subject; but in scoring a dramatic point he had  interested his audience more than he had intended. Miss Bartlett was  full of very natural curiosity. Lucy, though she wished never to see the  Emersons again, was not disposed to condemn them on a single word.    \"Do you mean,\" she asked, \"that he is an irreligious man? We know that  already.\"    \"Lucy, dear--\" said Miss Bartlett, gently reproving her cousin's  penetration.    \"I should be astonished if you knew all. The boy--an innocent child at  the time--I will exclude. God knows what his education and his inherited  qualities may have made him.\"    \"Perhaps,\" said Miss Bartlett, \"it is something that we had better not  hear.\"    \"To speak plainly,\" said Mr. Eager, \"it is. I will say no more.\" For the  first time Lucy's rebellious thoughts swept out in words--for the first  time in her life.    \"You have said very little.\"    \"It was my intention to say very little,\" was his frigid reply.    He gazed indignantly at the girl, who met him with equal indignation.  She turned towards him from the shop counter; her breast heaved quickly.  He observed her brow, and the sudden strength of her lips. It was  intolerable that she should disbelieve him.    \"Murder, if you want to know,\" he cried angrily. \"That man murdered his  wife!\"    \"How?\" she retorted.    \"To all intents and purposes he murdered her. That day in Santa  Croce--did they say anything against me?\"    \"Not a word, Mr. Eager--not a single word.\"    \"Oh, I thought they had been libelling me to you. But I suppose it is  only their personal charms that makes you defend them.\"    \"I'm not defending them,\" said Lucy, losing her courage, and relapsing  into the old chaotic methods. \"They're nothing to me.\"    \"How could you think she was defending them?\" said Miss Bartlett, much  discomfited by the unpleasant scene. The shopman was possibly listening.    \"She will find it difficult. For that man has murdered his wife in the  sight of God.\"    The addition of God was striking. But the chaplain was really trying  to qualify a rash remark. A silence followed which might have been  impressive, but was merely awkward. Then Miss Bartlett hastily purchased  the Leaning Tower, and led the way into the street.    \"I must be going,\" said he, shutting his eyes and taking out his watch.    Miss Bartlett thanked him for his kindness, and spoke with enthusiasm of  the approaching drive.    \"Drive? Oh, is our drive to come off?\"    Lucy was recalled to her manners, and after a little exertion the  complacency of Mr. Eager was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26457"],[0,"New observations on the natural history of bees (#10)"],[1,"not resolve to suggest, though  the same expedient had occurred to myself. He proposed to examine each  bee in the hive separately, to discover whether some small queen had not  insinuated herself among them, and escaped our first researches. This  was an important experiment; for, should no small queen be found, it  would be demonstrative evidence that the eggs had been laid by simple  workers.    To perform this operation with all possible exactness, immersing the  bees was not enough. You know, Sir, that the contact of water stiffens  their organs, that it produces a certain alteration of their external  figure: and, from the resemblance of small queens to workers, the  slightest alteration of shape would prevent us from distinguishing with  sufficient accuracy to what species those immersed might belong.  Therefore it was necessary to seize the whole bees of both hives,  notwithstanding their irritation, and examine their specific character  with the utmost care. This my assistant undertook, and executed with  great address. Eleven days were employed in it; and, during all that  time, he scarcely allowed himself any relaxation, but what the relief of  his eyes required. He took every bee in his hand; he attentively  examined the trunk, the hind limbs, and the sting: there was not one  without the characteristics of the common bee, that is, the little  basket on the hind legs, the long trunk, and the straight sting. He had  previously prepared glass cases containing combs. Into these, he put  each bee after examination. It is superfluous to observe they were  confined, which was a precaution indispensible until termination of the  experiment. Neither was it enough to establish that the whole were  workers; we had also to continue the experiment, and observe whether any  would produce eggs. Thus we examined the cells for several days, and  soon observed new laid eggs, from which the worms of drones came at the  proper time. My assistant held in his hands the bees that produced them;  and as he was perfectly certain they were common ones, it is proved that  there are sometimes fertile workers in hives.    Having ascertained M. Schirach's discovery, by so decisive an  experiment, we replaced all the bees examined, in very thin glass hives,  being only eighteen lines thick, and capable of containing but a single  row of combs, and thus were extremely favourable to the observer. We  thought, by strictly persisting to watch the bees, we might surprise a  fertile one in the act of laying, seize and dissect her. This we were  desirous of doing, for the purpose of comparing her ovaries with those  of queens, and to ascertain the difference. At length, on the eighth of  September, we had the good fortune to succeed.    A bee appeared in the position of a female laying. Before she had time  to leave the cell, we suddenly opened the hive and seized her. She  presented all the external characteristics of common bees; the only  difference we could recognise, and that was a very slight one, consisted  in the belly seeming less and more slender than that of workers. On  dissection, her ovaries were found more fragile, smaller and composed of  fewer oviducts than the ovaries of queens. The filaments containing the  eggs were extremely fine, and exhibited swellings at equal distances. We  counted eleven eggs of sensible size, some of which appeared ripe for  laying. This ovary was double like that of queens.    On the ninth of September, we seized another fertile worker the instant  she laid, and dissected her. The ovary was still less expanded than that  of the preceding bee, and only four eggs had attained maturity. My  assistant extracted one from the oviducts, and succeeded in fixing it by  an end on a glass slider. We may take this opportunity of remarking,  that it is in the oviducts themselves the eggs are imbued with the  viscous liquid, with which they are produced, and not in passing through  the spherical sac as Swammerdam believed. During the remainder of this  month, we found ten fertile workers in the same hives, and dissected  them all. In most, the ovaries were easily distinguished, but in some we  could not discern the faintest traces of them. In these last, the  oviducts to all appearance were but imperfectly developed, and more  address than we had acquired in dissection was necessary to distinguish  them.    Fertile workers never lay the eggs of common bees; they produce none but  those of males. M. Riems had already observed this singular fact; and  here all my observations correspond with his. I shall only add to what  he says, that fertile workers are not absolutely indifferent in the  choice of cells for depositing their eggs. They always prefer large  ones; and only use small cells when unable to find those of larger  diameter. But they so far correspond with queens whose impregnation has  been retarded, that they sometimes lay in royal cells.    Speaking of females laying male eggs alone, I have already expressed my  surprise that bees bestow, on those deposited in royal cells, such care  and attention as to feed the worms proceeding from them, and, at the  period of transformation, to close them up. But I know not, Sir, why I  omitted to observe that, after sealing the royal cells, the workers  build them up, and sit on them until the last metamorphosis of the  included male{I}. The treatment of the royal cells where fertile workers  lay the eggs of drones is very different. They begin indeed with  bestowing every care on their eggs and worms; they close the cells at a  suitable time, but never fail to destroy them three days afterwards.    Having finished these first experiments with success, I had still to  discover the cause of the expansion of the sexual organs of fertile  workers. M. Riems had not engaged in this interesting problem; and at  first I dreaded that I should have no other guide towards its solution  than conjecture. Yet from serious reflection, it appeared, that, by  connecting the facts contained in this letter, there was some light that  might elucidate my procedure in this new research.    From M. Schirach's elegant discoveries, it is beyond all doubt that  common bees are originally of the female sex. They have received from  nature the germs of an ovary, but she has allowed its expansion only in  the particular case of their receiving a certain aliment while a worm.  Thus it must be the peculiar object of inquiry whether the fertile  workers get that aliment while worms.    All my experiments convince me that bees, capable of laying, are  produced in hives that have lost the queen. A great quantity of royal  jelly is then prepared for feeding the larvae destined to replace her.  Therefore, if fertile workers are produced in this situation alone, it  is evident their origin is only in those hives where bees prepare the  royal jelly. Towards this circumstance, I bent all my attention. It  induced me to suspect that when bees give the _royal treatment_ to  certain worms, they either by accident or a particular instinct, the  principle of which is unknown to me, drop some particles of royal jelly  into cells contiguous to those containing the worms destined for queens.  The larvae of workers that have accidentally received portions of so  active an aliment, must be more or less affected by it; and their  ovaries should acquire a degree of expansion. But this expansion will be  imperfect; why? because the royal food has been administered only in  small portions, and, besides, the larvae having lived in cells of the  smallest dimensions, their parts cannot extend beyond the ordinary  proportions. Thus, the bees produced by them will resemble common  workers in size and all the external characteristics. Added to that,  they will have the faculty of laying some eggs, solely from the effect  of the trifling portion of royal jelly mixed with their aliment.    That we may judge of the justness of this explanation, it is necessary  to consider fertile workers from their origin; to investigate whether  the cells, where they are brought up, are constantly in the vicinity of  the royal cells, and if their food is mixed with particles of the royal  jelly. Unfortunately, the execution of these experiments is very  difficult. When pure, the royal jelly is recognised by its sharp and  pungent taste; but, when mixed with other substances, the peculiar  savour is very imperfectly distinguished. Thus I conceived, that my  investigation should be limited to the situation of the cells; and, as  the subject is important, permit me to enter a little into detail{J}.    In June 1790, I observed that one of my thinnest hives had wanted the  queen several days, and that the bees had no mean of replacing her,  there being no workers' worms. I then provided them with a small portion  of comb, each cell containing a young worm of the working species. Next  day, the bees prolonged several cells around the worms destined for  queens, in the form of royal ones. They also bestowed some care on the  worms in the adjoining cells. Four days afterwards, all the royal cells  were shut, and we counted nineteen small cells also perfected and closed  by a covering almost flat. In these were worms that had not received the  royal treatment; but as they had lived in the vicinity of the worms  destined for replacing the queens, it was very interesting to follow  their history, and necessary to watch the moment of their last  transformation. I removed the nineteen cells into a grated box, which  was introduced among the bees. I also removed the royal cells, for it  was of great importance, that the queens they would produce should not  disturb or derange the result of the experiment. But here another  precaution was also requisite. It was to be feared, that the bees being  deprived of the produce of their labour, and the object of their hope  might be totally discouraged; therefore, I supplied them with another"]]]
