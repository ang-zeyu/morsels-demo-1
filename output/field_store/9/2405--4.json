She was to      all appearances just on the point of death. I injected at once 17      minims of liq. strychniae. In about two minutes she sighed, and      then began to breathe in a jerky manner. In about ten minutes, on      my pulling her hair, she opened her eyes and looked around, but      could not recognise any one. Pupils now acted to stimulus of      light. In a short time she could speak when spoken to, but not see      at any distance. Her sight gradually returned completely; she kept      on improving, and in four to five hours after the one injection      she seemed quite well, but rather weak. I gave small doses of      stimulants till morning, and did not let her go to sleep till next      evening. She suffered no relapse, and her recovery was complete.\"        CASE 5.--This remarkable case was not published in the medical      press, but in many of the papers of Queensland, where it created      much sensation. The writer is indebted for an account of it to Dr.      Thwaites, who vouches for its correctness. It appears that this      gentleman acquainted the well-known explorer of Northern      Queensland, Mr. Johnstone, who is his uncle, and now police      magistrate at Maryborough, Queensland, with his success in      treating snakebite with strychnine. Mr. Johnstone, who during his      explorations had seen much of snakebite and many deaths from it,      wrote rather incredulously in reply, stating that our southern      snakes were innocuous in comparison with those of the north; and      that, having seen twelve persons bitten and die by the deadly      brown snake of the north (_Diemenia superciliosa_), he must      withhold his belief in the new antidote until he had witnessed a      case of brown snakebite cured by it or reported on good authority.      This desire he had quickly gratified, and by a strange fatality in      his own person. Whilst taking his children for a walk in the bush      a few weeks afterwards he stepped aside the path to pluck a flower      from a bush, and in doing so was bitten on the leg by a vigorous      brown snake. He at once applied a ligature, and had the punctures      sucked by an aboriginal, but became comatose before he reached      home. Three medical men were summoned in haste, injected ammonia      into several veins, and finally had to resort to artificial      respiration, declaring the case a hopeless one. In this extremity      Mrs Johnstone rushed to a fourth one, who had seen Dr. Thwaites'      letter, and discussed its contents with her husband in her      presence. This gentleman--Dr. Garde--laid up in bed, quickly      furnished the lady with liq. strychniae, accompanied by the request      to his colleagues to inject it freely. She came back to her      husband's bedside, when artificial respiration was about to be      given up, but the very first injection rendered it no longer      necessary and two more restored Mr. Johnstone completely. Saving      the life of this highly respected and popular functionary, who was      the first in Queensland treated with the antidote, paved the way      for it in that colony, where it is most needed and is now highly      appreciated.        These five cases, thoroughly typical of the effects of strychnine      in snakebite, are almost in themselves sufficient to bear out the      correctness of the writer's deductions, but for the benefit of a      certain class of rigorously incredulous scientists, who would not      be satisfied with five cases, the writer submits 45 more and in      addition to these--last but not least--Dr. Bannerjee's eight      Indian cases. They are all well authenticated, being mostly taken      from the _Australasian Medical Gazette_ or from private notes, but      to avoid useless repetition the greater part of them will be      merely cited and only the more remarkable ones be given in detail.      Whether in the face of this formidable array of evidence that      blind incredulity and senseless opposition, usually blocking the      way of every new discovery, will at last give way, remains to be      seen. The writer has had his full share of them, and but for the      valuable aid he received from the Hon. Dr. Creed, the able editor      of the _A. M. Gazette_, would probably be struggling yet for the      introduction of his antidote. When it is considered that, in spite      of such evidence as here produced, his discovery has as yet      received no official recognition from any of the Australian      medical authorities, and that even now there are medical men who      can write such effusions as that of Dr. T. L. Bancroft, of      Brisbane, beginning with the words: \"It is deplorable to still see      recorded cases of snakebite treated with strychnine, &c.,\" (see      _Gazette_ for July, 1892)--the attitude assumed from the first by      Dr. Creed and his unfailing advocacy of the antidote can not be      too highly appreciated and lay both the writer and the public      under a debt of deep gratitude to him. But for his early      recognition of the soundness of the writer's theory and treatment      of snakebite many valuable lives now saved would have been lost.      As early as June, 1889, Dr. Creed wrote in an editorial: \"We      desire to call the special attention of the profession to Dr.      Mueller's papers on the pathology and cure of snakebite, published      in our issues for Nov., Dec., Feb, April and May last, and to      press upon them the justice and, we submit, the necessity of      extremely careful consideration of his theory and of the results      shown in the cases in which, acting on it, he has used hypodermic      injections of strychnine for the treatment of snakebite. We      formerly expressed our concurrence in the opinion of Sir Joseph      Fayrer, who wrote: 'I do not say that a physiological antidote is      impossible, all I assert is, that it is not yet found.' We are      indeed pleased to state that we believe such an antidote is now      found and that Dr. Mueller is the happy discoverer. We are of      opinion that his theory as to the pathological changes set up in      the human system by the injection of snake-poison is a sound one      and that the treatment he has suggested and used is correct and      proper, and the one likely to avert death in cases of snakebite,      which would otherwise in all probability prove fatal. We therefore      press the use of hypodermic injections of strychnia in the manner      described by him upon the attention of practitioners who may have      to treat cases in which the symptoms present are the result of      snake or dangerous insect poison, and think that, should the      patients die without its having been used, all will not have been      done to save life that might have been.\" Without such utterances      repeated from time to time and without the ample space always      allowed in the _Gazette_ to the subject, a record like that now      submitted would not have been possible.

CASE 8.--Luke Dewhurst, labourer, bitten on hand by tiger snake.      Cured by one injection of m. xv. liq. strychniae after ammonia had      failed. Notes by Dr. Dutton, of Lillydale.        CASE 9.--P. Moroney, labourer, bitten on thigh at night, snake not      identified. Cured by three injections of 1/12th grain each. Notes      by Dr. Pardey, of Myrtleford.        CASE 10.--Mrs. Skinner, bitten on thigh, at Carrum. Treated by Dr.      Verity.        CASE 11.--Child of Mr. Weeks, aged three years. Treated by Dr.      Degner, of Myrtleford.        CASE 12.--Annie Rankin, servant, at Corowa. Treated by local      chemist.        CASE 13.--Child of Mr. F. Daniels, of Mount Kent, Queensland,      _only two years old_, bitten by a death adder on fourth finger of      left hand, the snake found clinging to finger. Ligature applied      and finger chopped off, but condition of child very precarious      when admitted to Toowoomba Hospital, after a night's journey, at      daylight, in complete collapse. Pronounced out of danger by Dr.      Hunt, the house-surgeon, at 10.30 and taken home in the afternoon.      Notes not furnished.        CASE 14.--Reported by Dr. Pain, of Allora, Queensland. Symptoms      serious. Four injections of m. xv., x., viii. and vii.

Four injections of m. xv., xv., xx., and xv., total 65      minims of liq. strych. P.B. injected within less than two hours,      muscular spasms appearing after last injection. Patient made rapid      recovery, riding home, a distance of 16 miles, within a few hours      after treatment.        CASE 17.--Reported by Dr. Ray, of Seymour, severe bite of a tiger      snake. Within six hours 4/5th of a grain administered      subcutaneously, besides a considerable quantity given by the      mouth. Patient made a good recovery. \"Every injection after the      second one,\" Dr. Ray reports, \"having a distinct effect within      three or four minutes, and lasting from one to one and a half      hours before tendency to coma returned.\"        CASE 18.--Very remarkable.

When one side of the bread is done,  you turn it over.    [Sidenote: Dutch Ovens]    The second method, and that almost universally employed in the West, is  by means of the Dutch oven. The latter instrument is in shape like a  huge and heavy iron kettle on short legs, and provided with a massive  iron cover. A hole is dug, a fire built in the hole, the oven containing  its bread set in on the resultant coals, and the hole filled in with hot  earth and ashes. It makes very good bread, but is a tremendous nuisance.  You have the weight of the machine to transport, the hole to dig, and an  extra fire to make. It also necessitates a shovel.    [Illustration: _Folding Aluminum Reflector Oven._]    [Sidenote: Reflector]    That the Westerner carries such an unwieldy affair about with him has  been mainly, I think, because of his inability to get a good reflector.  The perfect baker of this sort should be constructed at such angles of  top and bottom that the heat is reflected equally front and back, above  and below. This requires some mathematics. The average reflector is  built of light tin by the village tinsmith. It throws the heat almost  anywhere. The pestered woodsman shifts it, shifts the bread pan, shifts  the loaf trying to \"get an even scald on the pesky thing.\" The bread is  scorched at two corners and raw at the other two, brown on top, but  pasty at the bottom. He burns his hands. If he persists, he finds that a  dozen bakings tarnish the tin beyond polish, so that at last the heat  hardly reflects at all. He probably ends by shooting it full of holes.  And next trip, being unwilling to bake in the frying pan while he has a  horse to carry for him, he takes along the same old piece of  ordnance--the Dutch oven.    [Illustration:              \"We may live without friends, we may live without books,             But civilized man cannot live without cooks\"]    [Sidenote: Aluminum Baker]    This is no exaggeration. I have been there myself. Until this very year  I carried a Dutch oven on my pack trips. Then I made one more try,  purchased an aluminum baker of Abercrombie & Fitch, and have had good  bread at minimum trouble.    I realize that I seem to be recommending this firm rather extensively,  but it cannot be helped. It is not because I know no others, for  naturally I have been purchasing sporting goods and supplies in a great  many places and for a good many years. Nor do I recommend everything  they make. Only along some lines they have carried practical ideas to  their logical conclusion. The Abercrombie & Fitch balloon silk tents,  food bags, pack harness, aluminum alloys, and reflector ovens completely  fill the bill. And as they cannot be procured elsewhere, I must perhaps  seem unduly to advertise this one firm.    Their aluminum baker, then, I found to be a joy. I put the bread in the  pan, stuck the reflector in front of my regular cooking fire, and went  ahead with dinner. It required absolutely no more attention. By the time  I was ready to dish up grub, the bread was done. That was all there was  to it. The angles are correct, and the aluminum is easily kept bright.  When not in use it folds to an inch thick, and about a foot by a foot  and a half. It weighs only about two pounds. A heavy canvas case  protects it and the bread pan. I pack it between blankets, and never  know it is there; whereas the Dutch oven was always a problem. The cost  was three dollars.    [Sidenote: Food Bags]    Food is best transported in bags. Cotton drill, or even empty flour  sacks are pretty good on a pack horse; but in canoe and forest traveling  you will want something waterproof. Even horseback a waterproof bag is  better, for it keeps out the dust. Again I must refer you to Abercrombie  & Fitch. Their food bags are of light, waterproof, and durable  material, and cost only from a dollar to a dollar and a half a dozen,  according to size.    [Illustration: _Use of Parallel Logs._]    [Sidenote: Fire Irons]    Of course on a tramp you will carry no extra conveniences in the way of  fire irons, but will use as cooking range two green logs laid nearly  parallel, or rocks placed side by side. But with a pack horse, there is  no reason why you should not relieve yourself of this bother.    Usually two pieces of strap iron about thirty inches long and an inch  wide are employed for this purpose. The ends are rested on two stones  and the fire built beneath them. In case stones lack, a small trench is  dug, and the irons laid across that.    [Illustration: _Use of Ordinary Fire Irons._]    [Illustration: _The Ernest Britten Fire Irons._]    [Sidenote: The Britten Fire Irons]    [Sidenote: Inspirator]    Mr. Ernest Britten, a Forest Ranger, has however invented a contrivance  that is much better. The irons, instead of being made of strap iron, are  of angle iron. To the inside of the L and at each end sharpened legs are  swung on a rivet. A squared outer corner next the angle iron prevents  their spreading, but a rounded inner corner permits their being folded  flat. When used, the legs are opened and stuck upright in the ground,  the irons being arranged parallel at an appropriate distance from each  other. Mark these advantages: The irons can be driven to any height from  the ground according as fuel is plenty or scarce. They can be leveled  absolutely, a thing difficult to accomplish with stones and strap irons.  In case the ground is too hard to admit the insertion of the legs in it,  they can be folded back, and the irons used across stones in the manner  of the old strap irons. Moreover, and this is important, they weigh no  more.    I have had presented me by Mr. Robert Logan of New York, so simple,  transportable and efficient a device for kindling fires that I have  included it in my regular outfit. It consists of a piece of small rubber  tube two feet or so in length, into one end of which is forced a brass  cylinder three or four inches long. The extremity of this brass cylinder  is then beaten out so that its opening is flattened. Logan calls this  instrument an \"Inspirator.\"    [Sidenote: How to Use the Inspirator]    To encourage a fire you apply the brass nozzle to the struggling blaze,  and blow steadily through the rubber tube. The result is an effect  midway between a pair of bellows and a Bunsen burner.    Until you have tried it you will have difficulty in realizing how  quickly wet wood will ignite when persuaded by the Inspirator. I have  used it over five months of camping, and never have failed to blow up a  brisk blaze in the foulest conditions of weather and fuel. No more heavy  chopping for dry heart-wood, no more ashes in the face empurpled by  stooping, no more frantic waving of the hat that scatters ashes.  Furthermore, the Inspirator's use is not confined to wet days alone. If  ever you particularly desire any individual kettle to boil in a hurry,  and that utensil sullenly declines to do so, just direct the Inspirator  beneath it, and in a jiffy it is on the bubble. When out of use you wrap  the rubber tube around the brass nozzle and tuck it away in your  waistcoat pocket.    [Sidenote: Towels, Soap, etc.]    There remains only the necessity of cleaning up. Get three yards or so  of toweling and cut off pieces as you need them. Keep them washed and  they will last a long time. Borax soap and a cake of Sapolio help; but  you can clean up dishes without soap. Long tough grass bent double makes  an excellent swab. For washing clothes I have found nothing to equal  either Fels-Naphtha or Frank Siddal's Soap. You soap your garments at  night, rinse them in the morning--and the job is done. No hot water, no  boiling, little rubbing. And the garments are really clean.      _SUMMARY_              _Minimum for comfort_              1 tin cup with riveted handle            1 aluminum coffee pot            1 aluminum pail            1 knife, fork, spoon            1 aluminum plate            Fry pan            Food bags            Dish towel            Fels-Naphtha or Frank Siddal's soap.                _Maximum_              Tin cup            Aluminum coffee pot            2 aluminum pails            Knife, fork, 3 spoons            2 plates            Milk pan            2 fry pans to nest            Reflector oven            Food bags            Fire irons            Dish towel            Borax soap            Sapolio            Fels-Naphtha or Frank Siddal's soap.

CHAPTER VII    GRUB      [Sidenote: Variety]    IN no department of outdoor life does the mistaken notion of \"roughing  it\" work more harm. I have never been able to determine why a man should  be content with soggy, heavy, coarse and indigestible food when, with  the same amount of trouble, the same utensils, and the same materials he  can enjoy variety and palatability. To eat a well-cooked dinner it is  not necessary to carry an elaborate commissary. In a later chapter I  shall try to show you how to combine the simple and limited ingredients  at your command into the greatest number of dishes. At present we will  concern ourselves strictly with the kind and quantity of food you will  wish to carry with you.    Necessarily bulk and weight are such important considerations that they  will at once cut out much you would enjoy. Also condensed and  desiccated foods are, in a few cases, toothsome enough to earn  inclusion--and many are not. Perishability bars certain other sorts. But  when all is said and done there remains an adequate list from which to  choose.    [Sidenote: Luxuries]    However closely you confine yourself to the bare necessities, be sure to  include one luxury. This is not so much to eat as for the purpose of  moral support. I remember one trip in the Black Hills on which our  commissary consisted quite simply of oatmeal, tea,"]]]
