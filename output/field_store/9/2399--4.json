(#10)"],[1,"  thus prepared to receive the most favourable accounts of the doings of  Cats, and the most atrocious histories of the actions of Bears, Senor  Don Tomas Ricardo proceeded at once to the adventure of the morning,  in which his Kitten had nearly been brought to an untimely end, and,  although the mishap was quite as much due to the carelessness of the  nurse as to the rudeness of the master of the band, he worked up such a  wonderful picture, that the audience, thrilled with horror, soon after  separated, with a determination to bear the tyranny of the Ursine  Dynasty no longer.    I cannot tell what machinery was put in operation to produce the effects  which shortly after ensued; but I suppose, in a place where beasts are  fond of change and have very little to do, it is not difficult to get  them to do mischief. It is certain that an alliance was formed between  the Cats and Dogs of the city, who outnumbered together the rest of the  inhabitants, and one fine day, about a week after the meeting just  described, there was a revolution in Norsarque; the Bears who could not  escape were torn to pieces by the enraged rebels, and after some hours'  fighting, peace was restored, and Senor Don Tomas Ricardo was elected  King! Cats were appointed with Dogs to fill different offices of State,  and all animals of these races were, as it is easy to imagine, in very  high favour.    The change was a very important one to me. I had been on most friendly  terms with Senora Dona Ricardo ever since my saving her Kitten; and when  her husband was appointed to his elevated dignity, and she herself  became Queen, Her Majesty did not forget her former companions, but  offered me the post of Puss of Honour!    Behold me now, from the wild little creature, robbing birds' nests and  hunting rats, raised to the high dignity of attendant on a Queen! It is  true, I was rather mortified to think that my elevation was due more  to a mere combination of circumstances than to any merit of my own; but  I consoled myself with the reflection that mine was not a solitary  example, and that if we animals refused to enjoy the goods of fortune  when they were thrown in our way, because we did not happen exactly to  deserve them, there would be very few beasts who could enjoy anything  at all.    His Majesty Don Tomas was ambitious of renown; and no sooner found  himself upon the throne, than he proceeded to make a great many changes  and reforms, which, though certainly very necessary, were far from  pleasing to his subjects.    Her Majesty Dona Tomas was ambitious, too, but _her_ reforms produced a  very contrary effect; for as they referred to the dress of the female  sex, which she laboured to make as showy and attractive as possible,  every alteration was received with enthusiasm, and the more frequent  the changes, the greater they were liked. She spent whole days in  considering the propriety of long and short waists; she had many  sleepless nights in thinking over some new fashion for a cloak; and the  quantity of bonnets she spoiled before she got one to her mind, would  have covered the heads of half the female inhabitants of Norsarque. The  one she selected at last, curiously enough, did not cover the head at  all, but sticking up in a very pretty way at the back of the neck,  allowed the whole head to be visible. It was natural enough that the  young Pussies, who had pretty faces and glossy hair, should think a  fashion--which permitted them to show both to the admiring gaze of  passers-by--a most delightful one; but it seemed strange to me at first  that the old and ugly Cats should adopt it so eagerly. On thinking a  second time, however, my surprise vanished; for, in the first place,  you never could convince a Cat that she was _not_ pretty or graceful or  attractive in some way; and secondly, no female Cat ever seemed to know  when she was old.    These were some of the brilliant days of my existence; but, alas! the  most brilliant are always those which fade away the quickest. I said  that the reforms of His Majesty were not received with the same pleasure  as those carried out by the Queen. He had the good sense to observe that  they were not liked; but was too proud to withdraw them when he had once  declared that they should be carried through. Discontent increased  daily,--a feeling said to be fomented by the Dogs, who were more  dissatisfied than the rest, because, I suppose, they had received  more;--murmurs were soon heard throughout the city; and another fine  day, with the same rapidity which had marked the fall of the Bears and  the elevation of the Cats, saw the Cats overthrown in their turn, and  the Dogs,--those ungrateful Dogs!--raised in their place.    The same confusion occurred on this occasion as happened previously. His  Majesty Don Tomas Ricardo was strangled by a Cur, as he was escaping  from the Palace; Her Majesty fled no one knew whither. The household ran  off in every direction, and I took to flight with the rest. Fortunately  _Snubbini_--who was a great favourite with everybody and had some  friends among the dominant party--saved me from either violence or  insult, and I was able to remain shut up in my own apartment until  things were once more settled, and calm was restored.    When that event did occur, I resolved in my own mind to depart from  Norsarque, and take my way back to the city of my birth, which I now  felt a strong inclination to see again. The proposal seemed no less  delightful to my faithful valet than it was agreeable to myself; but how  far the thought of the effect which our fine clothes and foreign habits  was to produce upon the good beasts of Caneville mixed itself up with  our wish to return to our native country, I leave to the charitable to  determine.    It was with a very different train that I took my departure from  Norsarque to that with which I had entered it. Then _Snub_, with a  single box upon his head, was my solitary attendant and my only luggage;  now _Snub_, converted into _Snubbini_, my servant, multiplied by four,  and my trunk by five, made no despicable figure. We carried with us all  the necessaries for lodging at night and for refreshment during the day;  and passing on by easy journeys, we arrived, in about three weeks, at  Caneville.    How delightful did each well-known spot appear to me as I drew near and  recognized its familiar feature! how fondly did I gaze upon each hill,  each tree, which I had visited and loved in earlier days! with what a  mixed feeling of gratitude, of pain, and pleasure, did I recline upon  the soft grass, and, gazing on the city, pass in review the scenes and  events which had occurred there, and in which I had been an actress!  I have known many pleasures in the course of my life, but I count the  return to one's country, after a long absence, as one of the purest  and most satisfactory. I am not aware if the having left it with the  shame of crime could destroy this delight; but I, who left mine with  the feeling of disappointment and vexation, felt that _it_, at least,  had no power to make my pleasure less; for the first few days of my  return--during which I visited every old haunt, and every spot to which  was attached a recollection--were perfectly happy.    [Illustration: A VERY FINE CAT.]    Age creeps upon us all imperceptibly, and we are long before we can  bring ourselves to _confess_ that we are growing old: even when we _say_  so, we flatter ourselves that we are yet strong and hearty, and have  many years in store to live before we reach our resting-place. We may  however generally discover we are no longer young by comparing the  different effects produced on us by the same events at various periods  of our existence; and if we find that we cease to attribute to them the  same consequence with which we once invested them, we shall not be far  wrong in looking upon our change of opinion as one of the proofs of  our first youth being over. As I write these Memoirs, I cannot forbear  smiling at many things to which, at the time they were acting, I  attached a vast deal of importance. I remember, as if it were only  yesterday, my first entrance into the streets of Caneville after my long  absence abroad. I recollect, with wonderful accuracy, my having selected  my most showy dress, my most fashionable mantle, my most delightful  bonnet, with which to astonish the weak minds of the inhabitants of my  native city. I remember glancing round with pride at Snubbini, who had  put on his richest suit of livery, and who was strutting along with  his gold-headed staff under his arm, and his nose straight before him.  I remember, too, the satisfaction I experienced when, on drawing near  my house, one of my former neighbours, who was reputed the richest and  proudest Cat of the quarter, drew aside to let me pass, and made me  a profound bow as I swept by!    I think I have learnt to be wiser since that time, and to appreciate  things as they _are_, not by what they _seem_. It is long before vanity  can be eradicated from the heart; but I do believe I managed to root out  some of mine before my pretensions to youth and beauty were entirely  departed. Solitary thought and study, stolen from the gaieties of the  world, have taught me great truths; they have proved to me the more  vividly the goodness of my deceased cousin, and the wisdom of her  counsels. I have again aimed at being _useful_ to my fellow-creatures;  and although I have often failed, I have sometimes succeeded, and one  success, in such a pursuit, outweighs a thousand failures. If I can only  impress this truth upon _one_ out of, I hope, my many readers, there may  be some good even in a Cat's Tale.        THE END.

Then the forward rep-ray  generator exploded, and all signals went dead.    \"The fate of the LG-25 was somewhat similar, except that this ship hung  nose down, and drifted on the wind southward as it slowly descended out  of control.    \"As its control room was shattered, verbal report from its Action  Captain was precluded. The record of the interior rear viewplate shows  members of the crew climbing toward the rear rep-ray generator in an  attempt to establish manual control of it, and increase the lift. The  projectoscope relays, swinging in wide arcs, recorded little of value  except at the ends of their swings. One of these, from a machine which  happened to be set in telescopic focus, shows several views of great  value in picturing the falls of the other ships, and all of the rear  projectoscope records enable the reconstruction in detail of the  pendulum and torsional movements of the ship, and its sag toward the  earth. But none of the views showing the forest below contain any  indication of tribesmen's presence. A final explosion put this ship out  of commission at a height of 1,000 feet, and at a point four miles S. by  E. of the center of the valley.\"    The message ended with a repetition of the warning to other airmen to  avoid the valley.          CHAPTER VII    Incredible Treason      After receiving this report, and reassurances of support from the Big  Bosses of the neighboring Gangs, Hart determined to reestablish the  Wyoming Valley community.    A careful survey of the territory showed that it was only the northern  sections and slopes that had been \"beamed\" by the first Han ship.    The synthetic-fabrics plant had been partially wiped out, though the  lower levels underground had not been reached by the dis ray. The forest  screen above it, however, had been annihilated, and it was determined to  abandon it, after removing all usable machinery and evidences of the  processes that might be of interest to the Han scientists, should they  return to the valley in the future.    The ammunition plant, and the rocket-ship plant, which had just been  about to start operation at the time of the raid, were intact, as were  the other important plants.    Hart brought the Camboss up from the Susquanna Works, and laid out new  camp locations, scattering them farther to the south, and avoiding  ground which had been seared by the Han beams and the immediate  locations of the Han wrecks.    During this period, a sharp check was kept upon Han messages, for the  phone plant had been one of the first to be put in operation, and when  it became evident that the Hans did not intend any immediate reprisals,  the entire membership of the community was summoned back, and normal  life was resumed.    Wilma and I had been married the day after the destruction of the ships,  and spent this intervening period in a delightful honeymoon, camping  high in the mountains. On our return, we had a camp of our own, of  course. We were assigned to location 1017. And as might be expected, we  had a great deal of banter over which one of us was Camp Boss. The title  stood after my name on the Big Boss' records, and those of the Big  Camboss, of course, but Wilma airily held that this meant nothing at  all--and generally succeeded in making me admit it whenever she chose.    I found myself a full-fledged member of the Gang now, for I had elected  to search no farther for a permanent alliance, much as I would have  liked to familiarize myself with this 25th Century life in other  sections of the country. The Wyomings had a high morale, and had  prospered under the rule of Big Boss Hart for many years. But many of  the gangs, I found, were badly organized, lacked strong hands in  authority, and were rife with intrigue. On the whole, I thought I would  be wise to stay with a group which had already proved its friendliness,  and in which I seemed to have prospects of advancement. Under these  modern social and economic conditions, the kind of individual freedom to  which I had been accustomed in the 20th Century was impossible. I would  have been as much of a nonentity in every phase of human relationship by  attempting to avoid alliances, as any man of the 20th Century would have  been politically, who aligned himself with no political party.    This entire modern life, it appeared to me, judging from my ancient  viewpoint, was organized along what I called \"political\" lines. And in  this connection, it amused me to notice how universal had become the use  of the word \"boss.\" The leader, the person in charge or authority over  anything, was a \"boss.\" There was as little formality in his relations  with his followers as there was in the case of the 20th Century  political boss, and the same high respect paid him by his followers as  well as the same high consideration by him of their interests. He was  just as much of an autocrat, and just as much dependent upon the general  popularity of his actions for the ability to maintain his autocracy.    The sub-boss who could not command the loyalty of his followers was as  quickly deposed, either by them or by his superiors, as the ancient ward  leader of the 20th Century who lost control of his votes.    As society was organized in the 20th Century, I do not believe the  system could have worked in anything but politics. I tremble to think  what would have happened, had the attempt been made to handle the A. E.  F. this way during the First World War, instead of by that rigid  military discipline and complete assumption of the individual as a mere  standardized cog in the machine.    But owing to the centuries of desperate suffering the people had endured  at the hands of the Hans, there developed a spirit of self-sacrifice and  consideration for the common good that made the scheme applicable and  efficient in all forms of human co-operation.    I have a little heresy about all this, however. My associates regard the  thought with as much horror as many worthy people of the 20th Century  felt in regard to any heretical suggestion that the original outline of  government as laid down in the First Constitution did not apply as well  to 20th Century conditions as to those of the early 19th.    In later years, I felt that there was a certain softening of moral fiber  among the people, since the Hans had been finally destroyed with all  their works; and Americans have developed a new luxury economy. I have  seen signs of the reawakening of greed, of selfishness. The eternal  cycle seems to be at work. I fear that slowly, though surely, private  wealth is reappearing, codes of inflexibility are developing; they will  be followed by corruption, degradation; and in the end some cataclysmic  event will end this era and usher in a new one.    All this, however, is wandering afar from my story, which concerns our  early battles against the Hans, and not our more modern problems of  self-control.    Our victory over the seven Han ships had set the country ablaze. The  secret had been carefully communicated to the other gangs, and the  country was agog from one end to the other. There was feverish activity  in the ammunition plants, and the hunting of stray Han ships became an  enthusiastic sport. The results were disastrous to our hereditary  enemies.    From the Pacific Coast came the report of a great transpacific liner of  75,000 tons \"lift\" being brought to earth from a position of  invisibility above the clouds. A dozen Sacramentos had caught the hazy  outlines of its rep rays approaching them, head-on, in the twilight,  like ghostly pillars reaching into the sky. They had fired rockets into  it with ease, whereas they would have had difficulty in hitting it if it  had been moving at right angles to their position. They got one rep ray.  The other was not strong enough to hold it up. It floated to earth, nose  down, and since it was unarmed and unarmored, they had no difficulty in  shooting it to pieces and massacring its crew and passengers. It seemed  barbarous to me. But then I did not have centuries of bitter persecution  in my blood.    From the Jersey Beaches we received news of the destruction of a  Nu-yok-A-lan-a liner. The Sand-snipers, practically invisible in their  sand-colored clothing, and half buried along the beaches, lay in wait  for days, risking the play of dis beams along the route, and finally  registering four hits within a week. The Hans discontinued their service  along this route, and as evidence that they were badly shaken by our  success, sent no raiders down the Beaches.    It was a few weeks later that Big Boss Hart sent for me.    \"Tony,\" he said, \"There are two things I want to talk to you about. One  of them will become public property in a few days, I think. We aren't  going to get any more Han ships by shooting up their repellor rays  unless we use much larger rockets. They are wise to us now. They're  putting armor of great thickness in the hulls of their ships below the  rep-ray machines. Near Bah-flo this morning a party of Eries shot one  without success. The explosions staggered her, but did not penetrate. As  near as we can gather from their reports, their laboratories have  developed a new alloy of great tensile strength and elasticity which  nevertheless lets the rep rays through like a sieve. Our reports  indicate that the Eries' rockets bounced off harmlessly. Most of the  party was wiped out as the dis rays went into action on them.    \"This is going to mean real business for all of the gangs before long.  The Big Bosses have just held a national ultrophone council. It was  decided that America must organize on a national basis. The first move  is to develop sectional organization by Zones. I have been made  Superboss of the Mid-Atlantic Zone.    \"We're in for it now. The Hans are sure to launch reprisal expeditions.  If we're to save the race we must keep them away from our camps and  plants. I'm thinking of developing"]]]
