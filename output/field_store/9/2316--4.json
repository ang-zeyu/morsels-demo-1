The  creature's back was broken, and it was otherwise severely injured.  It  was evident that nothing could be done for it.  The dog must die, and  the great heart of Groot Willem was sorely afflicted.    Turning to Macora, he observed that the chief had reloaded his musket.  Willem pointed to the dog's head and then to the gun.    The chief took the hint and raised the weapon to his shoulder.    Groot Willem turned away with his eyes full of tears, and went off in  pursuit of his horse.        CHAPTER FOURTEEN.    THE LAGOON.    On returning to the camp, they found that Hendrik and Arend had been  successful in their chase of the antelopes, and the greater part of two  were cooking over a large fire.    A quantity of felled timber had been brought to the ground for  construction of the kraal, and the work of building it had already  commenced.    For the labour of his followers Macora would accept nothing but a small  quantity of coffee, a bottle of Schiedam and some tobacco, and in the  evening he took his departure, after seeing his friends safely  established in their camp.    Three of his people were left with the hunters, with orders to make  themselves useful in whatever way they could be employed.  This addition  to the company was, however, a source of great annoyance to the Bushman.  Any communication made to them required the assistance of his rival,  Congo.    Congo had others under him,--people to whom he gave instructions and  commands.  Swartboy had not, and was, therefore, very discontented with  the arrangements.    \"You and I must do something to-day,\" said Arend to Hendrik, as they  were eating their first breakfast at the new camping-place.    \"Yes,\" replied Hendrik, \"Willem has one day the start of us in  adventures, but I dare say fortune will favour us ere long.\"    \"She has favoured us all I think,\" said Willem.  \"How could we have a  better prospect of success?  There is apparently an abundance of game;  and we have found people willing to assist us in getting at it,--willing  to perform most of the toil and leave us all of the sport.\"    \"You are quite right,\" said Hendrik; \"our brightest hopes could not have  been crowned by a more favourable commencement, although two days ago we  were repining.  What do you say, Swartboy?\" he added, turning to the  Bushman; \"are you content?\"    \"I berry much content, Baas Hendrik,\" answered Swartboy, with an  expression that did not confirm his words.    That day the young hunters, leaving Swartboy and the Kaffir in charge of  the camp, made a visit to the lagoon, where they expected to find  hippopotami.    They passed by the place where Groot Willem had killed the leopard, and  observed that the bones of that animal, mingled with those of the  faithful Smoke, were scattered over the ground, clean-picked of their  flesh by the jackals and hyenas.    Half a mile farther on they reached the lagoon; and while riding along  its shore, they all pulled up to listen to an unfamiliar and  indescribable sound, that seemed to proceed from two dark objects just  visible above the surface of the water.  They were the heads of a brace  of sea-cows.  The animals were making towards them, uttering loud cries  that could not be compared with anything the hunters had previously  heard.  Any attempt to kill them in the water would only have resulted  in a waste of ammunition; for, with only the eyes and nose above the  surface, there was no chance for a bullet to strike them with fatal  effect.    The monsters showed some intention of coming out and making war; but, on  getting nearer, they changed their design, and, turning about,  floundered off out of reach.    Before proceeding many yards farther, they saw three other hippopotami,  this time not in the water, but out upon the plain.  They were browsing  on the grass, unconscious that an enemy was near.    \"Let us get between them and the water,\" suggested Willem.  \"By that  means we will make sure of them.\"    Riding forward at a sharp pace, the hunters succeeded in this design;  and, for a time, the retreat of the hippopotami appeared impossible.    Instinct does not lead these animals to flee from a foe.  They only make  for the water without regard to the position of the enemy.    On the first alarm, therefore, the three hippopotami started for the  lagoon, going at a heavy rolling pace, and much faster than might have  been supposed possible for creatures of such ungainly shape.  As they  ran in a direct line, the hunters were compelled to glide out of their  way, or run the risk of being trodden under foot.    Hans and Groot Willem were together; and, as soon as the broad side of a  hippopotamus came fairly before them, both fired at the same beast,  taking aim behind the shoulder.  Hendrik and Arend fired about at the  same time at another.    Onward rolled the immense masses towards the river, but before reaching  it the one to which Hans and Willem had devoted their attention was seen  to go unsteadily and with less speed.  Before arriving at the bank, it  gave a heavy lurch, like a water-logged ship, and fell over upon its  side.  Two or three abortive efforts were made to recover its feet, but  these soon subsided into a tremulous quivering of its huge frame, that  ended in the stillness of death.    Its two companions plunged into the water, leaving Hendrik and Arend a  little chagrined by the failure of their first attempt at killing a  hippopotamus.    Hans and Groot Willem had no pretensions to military prowess, and the  first was generally absorbed in some subject connected with his  botanical researches.  But he could claim his share in killing a  hippopotamus under circumstances no more favourable than the two who had  allowed their game to escape.        CHAPTER FIFTEEN.    HIPPOPOTAMI.    Herodotus, Aristotle, Diodorus, and Pliny have all given descriptions  more or less correct of the hippopotamus, river-horse, or zeekoe  (sea-cow) of the South African Dutch.    So great has been the interest taken in this animal, of which European  people have long read, but never until lately seen, that the Zoological  Society cleared 10,000 pounds in the year of the Great Exhibition of  1851, by their specimens exhibited in the gardens at Regent's Park.    Hippopotami procured from Northern Africa were not uncommon in the Roman  spectacles.  Afterwards, the knowledge of them became lost to Europe for  several hundred years; and, according to the authority of several  writers, they entirely disappeared from the Nile.    Several centuries after they had been shown in Rome and Constantinople,  it was stated that hippopotami could not be transported alive to a  foreign country; but the progress of civilisation has refuted this  erroneous hypothesis, and the harsh, heavy sound of its voice, since  May, 1850, has been familiar to the frequenters of a London park.    According to Michael Boyn, the hippopotamus has been found in the rivers  of China.  Marsden has placed them in Sumatra, and others say they exist  in the Indus, but these statements have never been sustained by  well-authenticated facts, and the creature is now believed to be  exclusively a native of Africa.    Monsieur Desmoulins describes two species,--one the _H. Capensis_, or  the hippopotamus of the Cape, and the _H. Senegalensis_ of the Senegal  river.    How the animal obtained its name would be difficult to imagine, since a  quadruped more unlike a horse could hardly exist.    When in the water, the hippopotamus can place its eyes, ears, and nose  on a level with the surface, and thus see, hear, and breathe, with but  little danger of being injured by a shot.  It is often ferocious in this  element, where it can handle itself with much ease; but on dry land it  is unwieldy, and, conscious of its awkwardness, it is rather timid and  sometimes cowardly.    These huge creatures are supposed to serve a good purpose by uprooting  and destroying large water-plants that might otherwise obstruct the  current of the stream and hinder the drainage of the surrounding  country.    The hide of the hippopotamus is used by the natives for many purposes.  Although soft when stripped off, it becomes so hard, when thoroughly  dry, that the Africans manufacture spears and shields of it.    Many of the Cape colonists are very fond of what they call \"zeekoe  speek,\" which is a portion of the flesh salted and preserved.    The greatest value which the hippopotamus has, in the eyes of man, is  found in its teeth,--its large canine tusks being the finest ivory  known, and much prized by the dentists.  It keeps its colour much  better, and lasts longer than any other used in the manufacture of  artificial teeth.    Tusks of the hippopotamus are sometimes found sixteen inches in length,  and weighing as much as a dozen pounds.  Travellers have even affirmed  that some have been seen measuring twenty-six inches in length; but no  specimens of this size have as yet been exhibited in the museums of  Europe.    The hide of a full-grown hippopotamus is thicker than that of the  rhinoceros; otherwise, it very much resembles the latter.  Its thickness  protects the animal against the poisoned arrows and javelins of the  natives.  But for this, it would soon become extinct in the rivers of  Africa, since, unlike most animals, there is no difficulty in  approaching the hippopotamus within bow-shot distance.  It can only be  killed by the natives after a great deal of trouble combined with  ingenuity.    The plan generally adopted is, by digging pits in places where the  hippopotami are known to pass in leaving the water to feed on the  herbage of the neighbouring plain.  These pits have to be dug in the  rainy season, when the ground "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27933"],[0,"Forest Neighbors: Life Stories of Wild Animals (#10)"],[1,"had grown rather too warm for comfort,  and lately he had got into the habit of frequenting certain deep, quiet  pools where icy springs bubbled out of the banks and imparted a very  grateful coolness to the slow current. It was delightful to spend a long  July afternoon in the wash below one of these fountains, having a lazy,  pleasant time, and enjoying the touch of the cold water as it went  sliding along his body from nose to tail. One sunshiny day, as he lay in  his favorite spring-hole, thinking about nothing in particular, and just  working his fins enough to keep from drifting down stream, a fly lit on  the surface just over his head--a bright, gayly colored fly of a species  which was entirely new to him, but which looked as if it must be very  finely flavored. As it happened, there had been several days of very  warm, sultry weather, and even the fish had grown sullen and lazy, but  this afternoon the wind had whipped around to the north, straight off  Lake Superior, and all the animals in the Great Tahquamenon Swamp felt  as if they had been made over new. How the brook trout could have known  of it so quickly, down under the water, is a mystery; but our friend  seemed to wake up all of a sudden, and to realize that he hadn't been  eating as much as usual, and that he was hungry. He made a dash at the  fly and seized it, but he had no sooner got it between his lips than he  spat it out again. There was something wrong with it. Instead of being  soft and juicy and luscious, as all flies ought to be, it was stiff, and  dry, and hard, and it had a long, crooked stinger that was different  from anything belonging to any other fly that he had ever tasted. It  disappeared as suddenly as it had come, and the Trout sank back to the  bottom of the pool.    But presently three more flies came down together, and lit in a row, one  behind another. They were different from the first, and he decided to  try again. He chose the foremost of the three, and found it quite as  ill-tasting as the other had been; but this time he didn't spit it out,  for the stinger was a little too quick for him, and before he could let  go it was fast in his lip. For the next few minutes he tore around the  pool as if he was crazy, frightening some of the smaller fishes almost  out of their wits, and sending them rushing up-stream in a panic. He  himself had more than once been badly scared by seeing other trout do  just what he was doing, but he had never realized what it all meant. Now  he understood.    The first thing he did was to go shooting along the surface for several  feet, throwing his head from side to side as he went, and doing his best  to shake that horrible fly out of his mouth. But it wouldn't shake, so  he tried jumping out of the water and striking at the line with his  tail. That wasn't any better, and next he rushed off up the stream as  hard as he could go. But the line kept pulling him round to the left  with gentle but irresistible force, and before he knew it he was back in  the pool again. Wherever he went, and whatever he did, it was always  pulling, pulling, pulling--not hard enough to tear the hook away, but  just enough to keep him from getting an inch of slack. If there had been  any chance to jerk he would probably have got loose in short order. He  rushed around the pool so hard that he soon grew weary, and presently he  sank to the bottom, hoping to lie still for a few minutes, and rest, and  perhaps think of some new way of escape. But even there that steady  tugging never ceased. It seemed as if it would pull his jaw out of his  head if he didn't yield, and before long he let himself be drawn up  again to the surface. Once he was so close to the shore that the angler  made a thrust at him with the landing-net, and just grazed his side. It  frightened him worse than ever, and he raced away again so fast that the  reel sang, and the line swished through the water like a knife.    [Illustration: \"_He tried jumping out of the water._\"]    The other two flies were trailing behind, and the short line that held  them was constantly catching on his fins and twisting itself around his  tail in a way that annoyed him greatly. He almost thought he could get  away if they were not there to hinder him. And yet, as it finally turned  out, it was one of those flies that saved his life. He was coming slowly  back from that last unsuccessful rush for liberty, fighting for every  inch, and only yielding to a strength a thousand times greater than his  own, when the trailer caught on a sunken log and held fast. Instantly  the strain on his mouth relaxed. The angler was no longer pulling on  him, but on the log. He could jerk now, and he immediately began to  twitch his head this way and that, backward and forward, right and  left, tearing the hole in his lip a little larger at every yank,  until the hook came away and he was free.    It was a painful experience, and he carried the scar as long as he  lived, but the lesson he learned was worth all it cost. I won't say that  he never touched bait again, but he was much more cautious, and no other  artificial fly ever stung him as badly as that one.    The years went by, and the Trout increased in size and strength and  wisdom, as a trout should. One after another his rivals went away to the  happy hunting-grounds, most of them losing their lives because they  could not resist the temptation to taste a made-up fly, or to swallow a  luscious angle-worm festooned on a dainty little steel hook; and the  number of fish who dared dispute his right to do whatever he pleased  grew beautifully less. And at last there was only one trout left in all  the stream who was larger and stronger than he. That was the same big  fellow who had come so near swallowing him on the occasion of his first  visit to the nesting-grounds; and the way the fierce, solemn old brute  finally departed this life deserves a paragraph all to itself.    It happened one morning in early spring, just after the ice had gone  out. Our friend was still a trifle sleepy and lazy after the long, dull  winter, though he had an eye open, as always, for anything particularly  good to eat. I doubt if he would have jumped at any kind of a fly, for  it was not the right time of year for flies, and he did not believe in  eating them out of season; but almost anything else was welcome. He was  faring very well that morning, as it chanced, for the stream was running  high, and many a delicious grub and earthworm had been swept into it by  the melting snow. And presently, what should come drifting down with the  current but a poor little field-mouse, struggling desperately in a vain  effort to swim back to the shore. Once before our friend had swallowed a  mouse whole, just as you would take an oyster from the half-shell, and  he knew that they were very nice, indeed. He made a rush for the unlucky  little animal, and in another second he would have had him; but just  then the big bully came swaggering up with an air which seemed to say:  \"That's my meat. You get out of this!\"    Our friend obeyed, the big fellow gave a leap and seized the mouse, and  then--his time had come. He fought bravely, but he was fairly hooked,  and in a few minutes he lay out on the bank, gasping for breath,  flopping wildly about, and fouling his beautiful sides with sand and  dirt. If he had understood English he might have overheard an argument  which immediately took place between the angler and a girl, and which  began something like this:    \"There!\" in a triumphant tone; \"who says mice aren't good bait? This is  the biggest trout that's been caught in this stream for years.\"    \"Oh, George, don't kill him! He's so pretty! Put him back in the water.\"    \"Put him back in the water? Well, I should say not! What do you take me  for?\"    Evidently the girl took him for one who could be easily influenced by  the right person, for she kept up the argument, and in the end she won  her case. The trout was tossed back into the stream, where he gave  himself a shake or two, to get rid of the sand, and then swam away,  apparently as well as ever. But girls don't always know what is good for  trout. It would really have been kinder if the angler had hit him over  the head with the butt of his fishing-rod, and then carried him home and  put him in the frying-pan. In his struggles a part of the mucus had been  rubbed from his body, and that always means trouble for a fish. A few  days later our friend met him again, and noticed that a curious growth  had appeared on his back and sides--a growth which bore a faint  resemblance to the bloom on a peach, and which had taken the exact shape  of the prints of the angler's fingers. The fungus had got him. He was  dying, slowly but surely, and within a week he turned over on his back  and drifted away down the stream. A black bear found him whirling round  and round in a little eddy under the bank, and that was the end of him.    And so our friend became the King of the Trout Stream.    You are not to suppose, however, that he paid very much attention to his  subjects, or that he was particularly fond of having them about him and  giving them orders. On the contrary, he had become very hermit-like in  his habits. In his youth he had been fond of society, and he and his  companions had often roamed the stream in little schools and bands, but  of late years his tastes seemed to have undergone a change, and he kept  to himself and lurked in the shady, sunless places till his skin grew  darker and darker, and he more and more resembled the shadows in which  he lived. His great delight was to watch from the depths of some  cave-like hollow under an overhanging bank until a star-gazer, or a  herring, or a minnow, or some other baby-eater came in sight, and then  to rush out and swallow him head first. He took ample revenge on all  those pesky little fishes for all that they had done and tried to do to  him and"]]]
