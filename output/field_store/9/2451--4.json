Gerald's pitch was in the shade of the tent; otherwise, of course,  everyone would have seen the shadow of the invisible Mabel as  she moved about making things vanish.    Gerald told the woman to divide the money, which she did  honestly enough.    \"Now,\" he said, while the impatient crowd pressed closer and  closer, \"I'll give you five bob for your shawl.    \"Seven-and-six,\" said the woman mechanically.    \"Righto!\" said Gerald, putting his heavy share of the money in his  trouser pocket.    \"This shawl will now disappear,\" he said, picking it up. He handed  it to Mabel, who put it on; and, of course, it disappeared. A roar of  applause went up from the audience.    \"Now,\" he said, \"I come to the last trick of all. I shall take three  steps backwards and vanish. He took three steps backwards, Mabel  wrapped the invisible shawl round him, and he did not vanish. The  shawl, being invisible, did not conceal him in the least.    \"Yah!\" cried a boy's voice in the crowd. \"Look at \"im! \"E knows \"e  can't do it.\"    \"I wish I could put you in my pocket,\" said Mabel. The crowd was  crowding closer. At any moment they might touch Mabel, and then  anything might happen  simply anything. Gerald took hold of his  hair with both hands, as his way was when he was anxious or  discouraged. Mabel, in invisibility, wrung her hands, as people are  said to do in books  that is, she clasped them and squeezed very  tight.    \"Oh!\" she whispered suddenly, \"it's loose. I can get it off.\"    \"Not \"    \"Yes the ring.\"    \"Come on, young master. Give us summat for our money,\" a farm  labourer shouted.    \"I will,\" said Gerald. \"This time I really will vanish. Slip round  into the tent,\" he whispered to Mabel.    \"Push the ring under the canvas. Then slip out at the back and join  the others. When I see you with them I'll disappear. Go slow, and  I'll catch you up.\"    \"It's me,\" said a pale and obvious Mabel in the ear of Kathleen.  \"He's got the ring; come on, before the crowd begins to scatter.\"    As they went out of the gate they heard a roar of surprise and  annoyance rise from the crowd, and knew that this time Gerald  really had disappeared.    They had gone a mile before they heard footsteps on the road, and  looked back. No one was to be seen.    Next moment Gerald's voice spoke out of clear, empty-looking  space.    \"Halloa!\" it said gloomily.    \"How horrid!\" cried Mabel; \"you did make me jump! Take the ring  off; it makes me feel quite creepy, you being nothing but a voice.\"    \"So did you us,\" said Jimmy.    \"Don't take it off yet,\" said Kathleen, who was really rather  thoughtful for her age, \"because you're still blackleaded, I suppose,  and you might be recognized, and eloped with by gypsies, so that  you should go on doing conjuring for ever and ever.\"    \"I should take it off,\" said Jimmy; \"it's no use going about  invisible, and people seeing us with Mabel and saying we've  eloped with her.\"    \"Yes,\" said Mabel impatiently, \"that would be simply silly. And,  besides, I want my ring.\"    \"It's not yours any more than ours, anyhow,\" said Jimmy.    \"Yes, it is,\" said Mabel.    \"Oh, stow it!\" said the weary voice of Gerald beside her. \"What's  the use of jawing?\"    \"I want the ring,\" said Mabel, rather mulishly.    \"Want\" the words came out of the still evening air  \"want must be  your master. You can't have the ring. I can't get it off!\"    The difficulty was not only that Gerald had got the ring on and  couldn't get it off, and was therefore invisible, but that Mabel, who  had been invisible and therefore possible to be smuggled into the  house, was now plain to be seen and impossible for smuggling  purposes.    The children would have not only to account for the apparent  absence of one of themselves, but for the obvious presence of a  perfect stranger.    \"I can't go back to aunt. I can't and I won't,\" said Mabel firmly, \"not  if I was visible twenty times over.\"    \"She'd smell a rat if you did,\" Gerald owned \"about the motor-car,  I mean, and the adopting lady. And what we're to say to  Mademoiselle about you !\" He tugged at the ring.    \"Suppose you told the truth,\" said Mabel meaningly.    \"She wouldn't believe it,\" said Cathy; \"or, if she did, she'd go stark,  staring, raving mad.\"    \"No,\" said Gerald's voice, \"we daren't tell her. But she's really  rather decent. Let's ask her to let you stay the night because it's too  late for you to get home.\"    \"That's all right,\" said Jimmy, \"but what about you?\"    \"I shall go to bed,\" said Gerald, \"with a bad headache. Oh, that's  not a lie! I've got one right enough. It's the sun, I think. I know  blacklead attracts the concentration of the sun.\"    \"More likely the pears and the gingerbread,\" said Jimmy unkindly.  \"Well, let's get along. I wish it was me was invisible. I'd do  something different from going to bed with a silly headache, I  know that.\"    \"What would you do?\" asked the voice of Gerald just behind him.    \"Do keep in one place, you silly cuckoo!\" said Jimmy. \"You make  me feel all jumpy. He had indeed jumped rather violently. \"Here,  walk between Cathy and me.    \"What would you do?\" repeated Gerald, from that apparently  unoccupied position.    \"I'd be a burglar,\" said Jimmy.    Cathy and Mabel in one breath reminded him how wrong burgling  was, and Jimmy replied:    \"Well, then a detective.\"    \"There's got to be something to detect before you can begin  detectiving,\" said Mabel.    \"Detectives don't always detect things,\" said Jimmy, very truly. \"If  I couldn't be any other kind I'd be a baffled detective. You could be  one all right, and have no end of larks just the same. Why don't you  do it?\"    \"It's exactly what I am going to do,\" said Gerald. \"We'll go round  by the police-station and see what they've got in the way of  crimes.\"    They did, and read the notices on the board outside. Two dogs had  been lost, a purse, and a portfolio of papers \"of no value to any but  the owner.\" Also Houghton Grange had been broken into and a  quantity of silver plate stolen. \"Twenty pounds reward offered for  any information that may lead to the recovery of the missing  property.\"    \"That burglary's my lay,\" said Gerald; \"I'll detect that. Here comes  Johnson,\" he added; \"he's going off duty. Ask him about it. The fell  detective, being invisible, was unable to pump the constable, but  the young brother of our hero made the inquiries in quite a  creditable manner. Be creditable, Jimmy.\"    Jimmy hailed the constable.    \"Halloa, Johnson!\" he said.    And Johnson replied: \"Halloa, young shaver!\"    \"Shaver yourself!\" said Jimmy, but without malice.    \"What are you doing this time of night?\" the constable asked  jocosely. \"All the dicky birds is gone to their little nesteses.\"    \"We've been to the fair,\" said Kathleen. \"There was a conjurer  there. I wish you could have seen him.\"    \"Heard about him,\" said Johnson; \"all fake, you know. The  quickness of the 'and deceives the hi.\"    Such is fame. Gerald, standing in the shadow, jingled the loose  money in his pocket to console himself.    \"What's that?\" the policeman asked quickly.    \"Our money jingling,\" said Jimmy, with perfect truth.    \"It's well to be some people,\" Johnson remarked; \"wish I'd got my  pockets full to jingle with.\"    \"Well, why haven't you?\" asked Mabel. \"Why don't you get that  twenty pounds reward?\"    \"I'll tell you why I don't. Because in this \"ere realm of liberty, and  Britannia ruling the waves, you ain't allowed to arrest a chap on  suspicion, even if you know puffickly well who done the job.\"    \"What a shame!\" said Jimmy warmly. \"And who do you think did  it?\"    \"I don't think I know.\" Johnson's voice was ponderous as his boots.  \"It's a man what's known to the police on account of a heap o  crimes he's done, but we never can't bring it \"ome to \"im, nor yet  get sufficient evidence to convict.\"    \"Well, said Jimmy, \"when I've left school I'll come to you and be  apprenticed, and be a detective. Just now I think we'd better get  home and detect our supper. Good night!\"    They watched the policeman's broad form disappear through the  swing door of the police-station; and as it settled itself into quiet  again the voice of Gerald was heard complaining bitterly.    \"You've no more brains than a halfpenny bun,\" he said; \"no details  about how and when the silver was taken.\"    \"But he told us he knew,\" Jimmy urged.    \"Yes, that's all you've got out of him. A silly policeman's silly idea.  Go home and detect your precious supper! It's all you're fit for.\"    \"What'll you do about supper?\" Mabel asked.    \"Buns!\" said Gerald, \"halfpenny buns. They'll make me think of  my dear little brother and sister. Perhaps you've got enough sense  to buy buns? I can't go into a shop in this state.\"    \"Don't you be so disagreeable,\" said Mabel with spirit.    \"We did our best. If I were Cathy you should whistle for your nasty  buns.\"    \"If you were Cathy the gallant young detective would have left  home long ago. Better the cabin of a tramp steamer than the best  family mansion that's got a brawling sister in it,\" said Gerald. \"You  are a bit of an outsider at present, my gentle maiden. Jimmy and  Cathy know well enough when their bold leader is chaffing and  when he isn't.    \"Not when we can't see your face we don't,\" said Cathy, in tones of  relief. \"I really thought you were in a flaring wax, and so did  Jimmy, didn't you?\"    \"Oh, rot!\" said Gerald. \"Come on! This way to the bun shop.\"    They went, And it was while Cathy and Jimmy were in the shop  and the others were gazing through the glass at the jam tarts and  Swiss rolls and Victoria sandwiches and Bath buns under the  spread yellow muslin in the window, that Gerald discoursed in  Mabel's ear of the plans and hopes of one entering on a detective  career.    \"I shall keep my eyes open tonight, I can tell you,\" he began. \"I  shall keep my eyes skinned, and no jolly error. The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35409"],[0,"Beauty: Illustrated Chiefly (#10)"],[1,"were much given to sexual pleasure.    It is, then, of the greatest importance to young men who are ambitious of  excellence, to mark well this truth, that the most powerful and  distinguished in mental faculties, other things being equal, will be he  who wastes them least in early life by sexual indulgence--who most  economizes the vital stimulant, in order to excite the mental powers on  great occasions. By such means may a man surely surpass others, if he have  received from his parents proportional mental energy.    Beside the means already indicated, there is one proposed by an able  writer, as serving to divert the instinct of propagation when too early  and excessive, and consequently dangerous: that is, the sentiment of love.  To employ this means, he observes, \"it is necessary to search early, after  knowing the character of the adolescent whom it is wished to direct, for a  young woman whose beauty and good qualities may inspire him with  attachment. This means will serve, more than can easily be imagined, to  preserve the adolescent both from the grosser attractions of libertinism  and the disease it entails, and from _the more dangerous snares of  coquetry_. It is,\" he adds, \"a virtuous young woman and a solid  attachment that are here spoken of.\"--At some future period I shall  probably show how wise this recommendation is, as well as the necessity  and the advantages of early marriages, under favorable circumstances.    Having now shown the evils of early sexual association, I may briefly  notice those of later libertinism.    If, even in more advanced life, and when the constitution is stronger, the  instinct of propagation be not restrained within just limits, it  degenerates into inordinate lewdness or real mania: \"Repperit obscaenas  veneres vitiosa libido.\" By such depravation, nobleness of character is  utterly destroyed.    This scarcely evitable consequence of great fortune and of the facility of  indulgence, it has been justly observed, will ever be the ruin of the  rich, and a mode of enervating the most vigorous branches of the most  powerful house.    The libertine, then, owing to exhaustion, by sexual indulgence, is  characterized by physical and moral impotence, or has a brain as incapable  of thinking, as his muscles are of acting.    As libertines are enfeebled by indulgence, it follows that they are  proportionally distinguished by fear and cowardice. Nothing, indeed,  destroys courage more than sexual abuses.    But, from cowardice, spring cunning, duplicity, lying, and perfidy. These  common results of cowardice are uniformly found in eunuchs, slaves,  courtiers, and sycophants; while boldness, frankness, and generosity,  belong to virtuous, free, and magnanimous men.    Again, cowardice, artifice, falsehood, and perfidy, are the usual elements  of cruelty. Men feel more wounded in self-love, as they are conscious of  being more contemptible; and they avenge themselves with more malignity  upon their enemy, as they find themselves more weak and worthless, and as  they consequently dread him more.    These are the causes of that malignant revenge which princes have often  shown, as, in ancient times, Tiberius, Caligula, Nero, Domitian,  Heliogabalus, &c. In later times, Catharine de Medici solicited the  massacre of the Protestants; Paul, Constantine, and Nicholas, of Russia,  were happy only when they wallowed in blood; Charles X., equally  effeminate and bigoted, perpetrated the massacre of the Parisians; Don  Miguel covered Portugal with his assassinations; and nearly all the  sovereigns and sycophants in Europe upheld or palliated his atrocities.[7]    The strong and brave man, on the contrary, scarcely feels hurt, and scorns  revenge.    It is not cruelty only with which we may reproach these effeminate  individuals: it is every vice which springs from baseness of character.    Libertinism, moreover, is not hurtful only to the health and welfare of  these individuals: it is so also to those of their posterity.    Finally, the results of libertinism have constantly marked, not merely the  ruin of families, but the degeneration of races, and the decay of empires.  The delights of Capua caused the ruin of Hannibal; and the Roman, once so  proud before kings, finally transformed himself into the wretched slave of  monsters degraded far below the rank of humanity.    So little, however, do men look to remote consequences that perhaps the  most frightful punishments of libertinism are the diseases which it  inflicts. Man may, then, be said to meet only death on the path of life.    The dangers of promiscuous love are, indeed, far beyond what young men  will easily believe. I do not exaggerate when I state, that, out of every  three women, and those the least common of the promiscuous, two at least  are certainly in a state of disease capable of the most destructive  infection. A surgeon in the habit of receiving foul patients at a public  hospital tells me, I might safely say that nine out of every ten are in  this state.[8]    While writing this, Sir Anthony Carlisle observes to me, that, \"the  special disease which appears to be a punishment for sexual profligacy, is  not only malignant, painful, and hideous, in every stage of it, but the  only remedy known for its cure, mercury, is a poison which generally  leaves its own evils for the venom which it destroys. This frightful  disease has no natural termination but in a disgusting disgraceful death,  after disfiguring the countenance, by causing blindness, loss of the nose,  the palate and teeth, and by the spoliation of the sinning organs. The  miserables, who thus perish in public hospitals, are so offensive to the  more respectable patients, that they are confined to appointed rooms,  termed foul wards, where they linger and die in the bloom of life, either  of the penalty inflicted by their profligacy, of the poison administered  to them, or of incurable consequent diseases, such as consumption, palsy,  or madness.\"    Hence, it has been observed, that, if we have to deal with a young man  incapable of guidance by the nobler motives, of feeling contempt for vice,  and horror for debauchery, there yet remain means to be employed. Let him  be conducted to the hospital, where he will find collected the poor  victims of debauchery--the unhappy women whom, even the day before, he may  have seen in the streets, with faces dressed in smiles, amid the torments,  the corrosion, and the contagion of disease. This may leave an impression  sufficiently deep. But let him also know that these unhappy creatures are  a thousand times more pitiable than the libertine who destroys them, and  who forfeits the only good we cannot refuse to other wretches, compassion  for the misery he endures.[9]          CHAPTER IV.    NATURE OF BEAUTY.      In this chapter, my aim is to show that there is more than one kind of  beauty, and that much confusion has arisen among writers, from not clearly  distinguishing the characteristics of these kinds.    An essential condition, then, of all excitement and action in animal  bodies, is a greater or less degree of novelty in the objects impressing  them--even if this novelty should arise only from a previous cessation of  excitement.    Now, objects of greater or less novelty are the causes of excitement,  pleasurable or painful, by means of their various relations.    The lowest degree of bodily pleasure (though, owing to its constancy,  immense in its total amount) is that which arises, during health, from  those relations of bodies and that excitement which cause the mere local  exercise of the organs--a source of pleasure which is seldom the object of  our voluntary attention, but which seems to me to be the chief cause of  attachment to life amid its more definite and conspicuous evils.    All higher mental emotions consist of pleasure or pain superadded to more  or less definite ideas. Pleasurable emotions arise from the agreeable  relations of things; painful emotions, from the disagreeable ones.    The term by which we express the influence which objects, by means of  their relations, possess of exciting emotions of pleasure in the mind, is  BEAUTY.    Beauty, when founded on the relations of objects, or of the parts of  objects, to each other, forms a first class, and may be termed _intrinsic  beauty_.    When beauty is farther considered in relation to ourselves, it forms a  second class, and may be termed _extrinsic_ beauty.    We are next led (hitherto this has apparently been done without analyzing  or defining the operation) to a division of the latter into two genera;  namely, the _minor beauty_, of which prettiness, delicacy, &c., are  modifications, and that which is called _grandeur_ or _sublimity_.    The characters of the minor beauty or prettiness, with relation to  ourselves, are smallness, subordination, and subjection. Hence female  beauty, in relation to the male.    The characters of grandeur or sublimity, with relation to ourselves, are  greatness, superordination, and power. Hence male beauty, in relation to  the female.    By the preceding brief train of analysis and definition, is, I believe,  answered the question--\"whether the emotion of grandeur make a branch of  the emotion of beauty, or be entirely distinct from it.\"    Having, by this concise statement of my own views on these subjects, made  the reader acquainted with some of the materials of future consideration  here employed, I may now examine the opinions of some philosophers, in  order to see how far they accord with these first principles, and what  answer can be given to them where they differ.    That _beauty_, _generally considered_, has nothing to do with particular  size, is very well shown by Payne Knight, who, though he argues  incorrectly about it in many other respects, here truly says: \"All degrees  of magnitude contribute to beauty in proportion as they show objects to be  perfect in their kind."]]]
