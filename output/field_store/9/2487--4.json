As for me, while I live, I am not afraid that any  one will be killed, and then I can not answer for the safety of my  two colleagues. It would be your turn to govern,\" said, he, smiling,  and turning to Cambaceres;\" and you are not as yet very firm in  the stirrups . It will be better to have a law for the present, as  well as for the future.\" It was finally, after much deliberation,  decided that the Council of State should draw up a declaration of  the reasons, for the act. The First Consul was to sign the decree,  and the Senate was to declare whether it was or was not constitutional.  Thus cautiously Napoleon proceed under circumstances so exciting.  The law, however, was unjust and tyrannical. Guilty as these men  were of other crimes, by which they had forfeited all sympathy,  it subsequently appeared that they were not guilty of this crime.  Napoleon was evidently embraced by this uncertainty of their guilty,  and was not willing that they should be denounced as contrivers  of the infernal machine. \"We believe ,\" said he, \"that they are  guilty. But we do not know it. They must be transported for the  crimes which they have committed, the massacres and the conspiracies  already proved against them.\" The decree was passed. But Napoleon,  strong in popularity, became so convinced of the powerlessness and  insignificance of these Jacobins, that the decree was never enforced  against them. They remained in France. But they were conscious that  the eye of the police was upon them. \"It is not my own person,\" said  Napoleon, \"that I seek to avenge. My fortune which has preserved  me so often on the field of battle, will continue to preserve me.  I think not of myself. I think of social order which it is my mission  to re-establish, and of the national honor, which it is my duty  to purge from an abominable stain.\" To the innumerable addresses  of congratulation and attachment which this occurrence elicited  Napoleon replied. \"I have been touched by the proofs of affection  which the people of Paris have shown me on this occasion. I deserve  them. For the only aim of my thoughts, and of my actions, is to  augment the prosperity and the glory of France. While those banditti  confined themselves to direct attacks upon me, I could leave to  the laws the task of punishing them. But since they have endangered  the population of the capital by a crime, unexampled in history,  the punishment must be equally speedy and terrible.\"    It was soon proved, much to the surprise of Napoleon, that the  atrocious act was perpetrated by the partisans of the Bourbons.  Many of the most prominent of the Loyalists were implicated in this  horrible conspiracy. Napoleon felt that he deserved their gratitude.  He had interposed to save them from the fury of the Jacobins.  Against the remonstrances of his friends, he had passed a decree  which restored one hundred and fifty thousand of these wandering  emigrants to France. He had done every thing in his power to enable  them to regain their confiscated estates. He had been in all respects  their friend and benefactor, and he would not believe, until the  proof was indisputable, that they could thus requite him. The wily  Fouche, however, dragged the whole matter into light. The prominent  conspirators were arrested and shot. The following letter, written  on this occasion by Josephine, to the Minister of Police, strikingly  illustrates the benevolence of her heart, and exhibits in a very  honorable light the character of Napoleon.    \"While I yet tremble at the frightful event which has just occurred,  I am distressed through fear of the punishment to be inflicted on  the guilty, who belong, it is said, to families with whom I once  lived in habits of intercourse. I shall be solicited by mothers,  sisters, and disconsolate wives, and my heart will be broken through  my inability to obtain all the mercy for which I would plead. I know  that the elemency of the First who belong, it is said, to families  with whom I once lived in habits of intercourse. I shall be  solicited by mothers,sisters, and disconsolate wives, and my heart  will be broken through my inability to obtain all the mercy for  which I would plead. I know that the elemency of the First Consul  is great--his attachment to me extreme. The chief of the government  has not been alone exposed; and it is that which will render him  severe, inflexible. I conjure you, therefore, to do all in your  power to prevent inquiries being pushed too far. Do not detect all  those persons who have been accomplices in this odious transaction.  Let not France, so long overwhelmed in consternation, by public  executions, groan anew, beneath such inflictions. When the ringleaders  of this nefarious attempt shall have been secured, let severity  give place to pity for inferior agents, seduced, as they may have  been by dangerous falsehoods or exaggerated opinions. As a woman,  a wife, and a mother, I must feel the heartrendings of those will  apply to me. Act, citizen minister, in such a way that the number  of these may be lessened.\"    It seems almost miraculous that Napoleon should have escaped the  innumerable conspiracies which at this time were formed against  him. The partisans of the Bourbons though that if Napoleon could be  removed, the Bourbons might regain their throne. It was his resistless  genius alone, which enabled France to triumph over combined Europe.  His death would leave France without a leader. The armies of the  allies could then, with bloody strides, march to Paris, and place  the hated Bourbons on the throne. France knew this, and adored its  preserver. Monarchical Europe knew this, and hence all the engergies  of its combined kings were centred upon Napoleon. More than thirty  of these consipracies were detected by the police. London was  the hot-house where they were engendered. Air-guns were aimed to  Napoleon. Assassins dogged him with their poniards. A bomb-shell was  invented, weighing about fifteen pounds, which was to be thrown in  at his carriage-window, and which exploding by its own concussion,  would hurl death on every side. The conspirators were perfectly  reckless of the lives of others, if they could only destroy the life  of Napoleon. The agents of the infernal-machine had the barbarity  to get a young girl fifteen years of age to hold the horse who  drew the machine. This was to disarm suspicion. The poor child was  blown into such fragments, that no part of her body. excepting the  feet, could afterwards be found. At last Napoleon became aroused,  and declared that he would \"teach those Bourbons that he was not  a man to be shot at like a dog.\"    One day at St. Helena, as he was putting on his flannel waistcoat,  he observed Las Casas looking at him very steadfastly.    \"Well! what is your Excellency thinking of?\" said Napoleon, with  a smile.    \"Sire,\" Las Casas replied, \"in a pamphlet which I lately read, I  found it stated that your majesty was shielded by a coat-of-mail,  for the security of your person. I was thinking that I could bear  positive evidence that at St. Helena at least, all precautions for  personal safety have been laid aside.\"    \"This,\" said Napoleon, \"is one of the thousand absurdities which  have just mentioned is the more ridiculous, since every individual  about me well knows how careless I am with regard to self-preservation.  Accustomed from the age of eighteen to be exposed to the connon-ball,  and knowing the inutility of precautions, I abandoned myself to  my fate. When I came to the head of affairs, I might still have  fancied myself surrounded by the dangers of the field of battle;  and I might have regarded the conspiracies which were formed against  me as so many bomb-shells. But I followed my old course. I trusted  to my lucky star, and left all precautions to the police. I was  perhaps the only sovereign in Europe who dispensed with a body-guard.  Every one could freely approach me, without having, as it were, to  pass through military barracks. Maria Lousia was much astonished  to see me so poorly guarded, and she often remarked that her father  was surrounded by bayonets. For my part, I had no better defense  at the Tuileries than I have here. I do not even know where to  find my sword,\" said he, looking around the room; \"do you see it?  I have, to be sure, incurred great dangers. Upward of thirty plots  were found against me. These have been proved by authentic testimony,  without mentioning many which never came to light. Some sovereigns  invent conspiracies against themselves; for my part, I made it a  rule carefully to conceal them whenever I could. The crisis most  serious to me was during the interval from the battle of Marengo, to  the attempt of George Cadoudal and the affair of the Duke D'Enghien\"    Napoleon now, with his accustomed vigor, took hold of the robbers an  and made short work with them. The insurgent armies of La Vendee,  numbering more than one hundred thousand men, and filled with  adventurers and desperadoes of every kind, were disbanded when their  chiefs yielded homage to Napoleon. Many of these men, accustomed to  banditti warfare, took to the highways. The roads were so infested  by them, that travailing became exceedingly perilous, and it was  necessary that every stage-coach which left Paris should be accompanied  by a guard of armed soldiers. To remedy a state of society thus  convulsed to its very centre, special tribunals were organized,  consisting of eight judges. They were to take cognizance of all such  crimes as conspiracies, robberies, and acts of violence of any kind.  The armed bands of Napoleon swept over France like a whirlwind.  The robbers were seized, tried, and shot without delay. Order was  at once restored. The people thought not of the dangerous power  they were placing in the hands of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3777"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle; Or, Daring Adventures in Elephant Land (#10)"],[1,"us for  another of its enemies.\"    Sailors and passengers crowded around Tom, eager to shake his hand,  and to hear about the gun. Many declared that he had saved the ship.    This was hardly true, for the whale could not have kept up its  attacks much longer. Still he might have done serious damage, by  causing a leak, and, while the Soudalar was a stanch craft, with  many water-tight compartments, still no captain likes to be a week  from land with a bad leak, especially if a storm comes up. Then,  too, there was the danger of a panic among the passengers, had the  attacks been kept up, so, though Tom wanted to make light of his  feat, the others would not let him.    \"You're entitled to the thanks of all on board,\" declared Captain  Wendon, \"and I'll see that the owners hear of what you did. Well, I  guess we can go on, now. I'll not stop again to see a fight between  a killer and a whale.\"    The steamer resumed her way at full speed, and the sailor, who had  gone below, came up to report that there was only a slight leak,  which need not cause any uneasiness.    Little was talked of for the next few days but the killing of the  whale, and Tom had to give several exhibitions of his electric  rifle, and explain its workings. Then, too, the story of his  expedition became known, and also the object of Mr. Anderson's  quest, and Tom's offer of aid to help rescue the missionaries, so  that, altogether, our hero was made much of during the remainder of  the voyage.    \"Well, if your gun will do that to a whale, what will it do to an  elephant?\" asked Mr. Durban one morning, when they were within a  day's steaming of their port. \"I'm afraid it's almost too strong,  Tom. It will leave nothing--not even the tusks to pick up.\"    \"Oh, I can regulate the power,\" declared the lad. \"I used full force  on the whale, just to see what it would do. It was the first time  I'd tried it on anything alive. I can so regulate the charge that it  will kill even an elephant, and leave scarcely a mark on the beast.\"    \"I'd like to see it done,\" remarked the old hunter.    \"I'll show you, if we sight any sharks,\" promised Tom. He was able  to keep his word for that afternoon a school of the ugly fish  followed the steamer for the sake of the food scraps thrown  overboard. Tom took his position in the stern, and gave an  exhibition of shooting with his electric gun that satisfied even Mr.  Durban, exacting as he was.    For the lad, by using his heaviest charges, destroyed the largest  sharks so that they seemed to instantly disappear in the water, and  from that he toned down the current until he could kill some of the  monsters so easily and quickly that they seemed to float motionless  on the surface, yet there was no life left in them once the electric  charge touched them.    \"We'll use the light charges when we're killing elephants for their  tusks,\" said Tom, \"and the heavy ones when we're in danger from a  rush of the beasts.\"    He little knew how soon he would have to put his plan into effect.    They arrived safely at Majumba, the African coast city, and for two  days Tom was kept busy superintending the unloading of the parts of  his airship. But it was safely taken ashore, and he and his friends  hired a disused warehouse in which to work at reassembling the Black  Hawk.    Tom had everything down to a system, and, in less than a week the  aircraft was once more ready to be sent aloft. It was given a try-out,  much to the astonishment of the natives, and worked perfectly.  Then Tom and his friends busied themselves laying in a stock of  provisions and stores for the trip into the interior.    They made inquiries about the chances of getting ivory and were told  that they were good if they went far enough into the jungle and  forests, for the big beasts had penetrated farther and farther  inland.    They also tried to get some news regarding the captive missionaries,  but were unsuccessful nor could they learn what had become of Tomba,  who had brought the dire news to civilization.    \"It's too soon to hope for anything yet,\" said Mr. Anderson. \"Wait  until we get near the country of the red pygmies.\"    \"And then it may be too late,\" said Tom in a low voice.    It was two weeks after their arrival in Majumba that Tom announced  that all was in readiness. The airship was in perfect working order,  it was well stocked with food, arms, articles and trinkets with  which to trade among the natives, spare parts for the machinery,  special tools and a good supply of the chemicals needed to  manufacture the lifting gas.    Of course Tom did not leave behind his electric weapon and Mr.  Durban and the others took plenty of ammunition for the ordinary  rifles which they carried.    One morning, after cabling to his father that they were about to  start, Tom gave a last careful look to his airship, tested the motor  and dynamos, took a hasty survey of the storeroom, to see that  nothing had been forgotten, and gave the word to get aboard.    They took their places in the cabin. Outside a crowd of natives, and  white traders of many nationalities had gathered. Tom pulled the  starting lever. The Black Hawk shot across a specially prepared  starting ground, and, attaining sufficient momentum, suddenly arose  into the air.    There was a cheer from the watching crowd, and several superstitious  blacks, who saw the airship for the first time, ran away in terror.    Up into the blue atmosphere Tom took his craft. He looked down on  the city over which he was flying. Then he pointed the prow of the  Black Hawk toward the heart of the dark continent.    \"Off for the interior!\" he murmured. \"I wonder if we'll ever get out  again?\"    No one could answer. They had to take their chances with the dangers  and terrors of elephant land, and with the red pygmies. Yet Tom  Swift was not afraid.          CHAPTER XI    ANCHORED TO EARTH      With the voyage on the steamer, their arrival in Africa, the many  strange sights of the city of Majumba, and the refitting of the  airship, our friends had hardly had time to catch their breath since  Tom Swift's determination to go elephant hunting. Now, as the Black  Hawk was speeding into the interior, they felt, for the first time  in many weeks, that they \"could take it easy,\" as Ned Newton  expressed it.    \"Thank goodness,\" said the bank clerk, \"I can sit down and look at  something for a while,\" and he gazed out of the main cabin windows  down at the wild country over which they were then flying.    For, so swiftly had the airship moved that it was hardly any time at  all before it had left Majumba far behind, and was scudding over the  wilderness.    \"Bless my camera,\" exclaimed Mr. Damon, who had brought along one of  the picture machines, \"bless my camera! I don't call that much to  look at,\" and he pointed to the almost impenetrable forest over  which they then were.    \"No, it isn't much of a view,\" said the old elephant hunter, \"but  wait. You'll soon see all you want to. Africa isn't all like this.  There are many strange sights before us yet. But, Tom Swift, tell us  how the airship is working in this climate. Do you find any  difficulty managing it?\"    \"Not at all,\" answered Tom, who was in the cabin then, having set  the automatic steering apparatus in the pilot house, and come back  to join the others. \"It works as well as it did in good old York  State. Of course I can't tell what affect the continual hot and  moist air will have on the gas bag, but I guess we'll make out all  right.\"    \"I certainly hope so,\" put in Mr. Anderson. \"It would be too bad to  be wrecked in the middle of Africa, with no way to get out.\"    \"Oh, you needn't worry about that,\" said Ned with a laugh. \"If the  airship should smash, Tom would build another out of what was left,  and we'd sail away as good as before.\"    \"Hardly that,\" answered the young inventor.    \"But we won't cross a bridge until we hear it coming, as Eradicate  would say. Hello, that looks like some sort of native village.\"    He pointed ahead to a little clearing in the forest, where a number  of mud and grass huts were scattered about. As they came nearer they  could see the black savages, naked save for a loin cloth, running  about in great excitement, and pointing upward.    \"Yes, that's one of the numerous small native villages we'll see  from now on,\" said Mr. Durban. \"Many a night have I spent in those  same grass huts after a day's hunting. Sometimes, I've been  comfortable, and again not. I guess we've given those fellows a  scare.\"    It did seem so, for by this time the whole population, including  women and children, were running about like mad. Suddenly, from  below there sounded a deep booming noise, which came plainly to the  ears of the elephant hunters through the opened windows of the  airship cabin.    \"Hark! What's that?\" cried Tom, raising his hand for silence.    \"Bless my umbrella! it sounds like thunder,\" said Mr. Damon.    \"No, it's one of their war drums,\" explained Mr. Durban. \"The  natives make large ones out of hollow trees, with animal skins  stretched over the ends, and they beat them to sound a warning, or  before going into battle. It makes a great noise.\"    \"Do you think they want to fight us?\" asked Ned, looking anxiously  at Tom, and then toward where his rifle stood in a corner of the  cabin.    \"No, probably that drum was beaten by some of the native priests,\"  explained the hunter. \"The natives are very superstitious, and  likely they took us for an evil spirit, and wanted to drive us  away.\"    \"Then we'll hustle along out of their sight,\" said Tom, as he went  to the pilot house to increase the speed of the airship, for he had  been letting it drift along slowly to enable the adventurers to view  the country over which they were passing. A few minutes later, under  the increased force of the machinery, the Black Hawk left the native  village, and the crowd of frightened blacks, far behind."]]]
