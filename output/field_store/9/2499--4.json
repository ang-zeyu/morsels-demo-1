[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38032"],[0,"Game Birds and Game Fishes of the Pacific Coast (#10)"],[1,"-Top of head and neck, brown of a chestnut tinge, the  feathers forming almost a crest; a broad stripe of green runs back  from the eye to the neck; back and sides, mottled gray; breast, buff,  shaded to white on the abdomen and spotted with black; speculum,  green.    Female--The top of the head of the female is a rusty brown, and with a  very faint stripe on the sides; upper parts, gray, spotted with black;  speculum, green.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest of the green-winged teal is generally a  little more carefully made than most of the ground nesting ducks. The  eggs average about ten and are of a light brownish buff.    =Measurements=--The green-winged teal is the smallest of the  fresh-water ducks. Total length, about 14 inches; wing, 7-1/4; bill,  1-1/4 inches.        [Illustration: CINNAMON TEAL (Anas cyanoptera)]      THE CINNAMON TEAL    (Anas cyanoptera)    The cinnamon teal, very commonly called the blue-winged teal by the  sportsmen of the Coast, is only a late fall and early spring bird on  our shooting grounds north of Lower California and Mexico. While the  cinnamon teal has a blue wing there is no resemblance between the  male cinnamon and the male blue-winged. The females of the two  species, however, have a marked resemblance in color but a wide  difference in shape of body. The female cinnamon teal is much darker  on the throat than the blue-winged female, and generally shows a  considerable of the cinnamon color of the male. The male of the  blue-winged teal partakes more of the grayish color of the  green-winged variety and has a white crescent in front of the eye. The  northern limit of the cinnamon teal is about the latitude of San  Francisco so far as their appearance on our shooting grounds is  concerned. A few, however, go farther north for breeding purposes.  They are quite common in the southern part of California, where they  come to breed. They winter in Mexico, Lower California and Arizona in  great numbers. They nest on the mountain lakes and along the mountain  streams of California and even as far north as Oregon. In southern  California they nest along the salt-water marshes, especially those of  Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties.    =Color=--Male--The male bird cannot well be mistaken for that of any  other species. The general color being a dark cinnamon, or in fact  much nearer a chestnut in color; the head being somewhat darker than  the rest of the bird; the upper wing-coverts being blue, form a large  patch of blue at the shoulders when the wing is at rest; the speculum,  like that of all the teal is green.    Female--The female resembles the female of the blue-winged teal, but  is a little larger with a longer and slimmer body; the chin is dusky  and the throat is speckled; the breast also has a slight tinge of the  cinnamon color of the male.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nests are built generally in long grass patches  of the low grounds bordering the streams and lakes and even the salt  marshes. The eggs which average about a dozen are of a peculiar light  creamy color with a faint bluish tinge.    =Measurements=--Total length, 16 inches; wing, 7-1/2; bill, 1-3/4.        [Illustration: BLUE-WINGED TEAL (Anas discors)]      THE BLUE-WINGED TEAL    (Anas discors)    The blue-winged teal is only a straggler north of Lower California,  Arizona and Mexico. In Mexico and Lower California I know them to be  quite common, and reasonably plentiful in some parts of Arizona.    The blue-winged teal is a plumper bird than either of the other  species, and not near so handsomely marked. It is a rapid flyer and  affords good shooting in those sections where it is plentiful.    =Color=--Male--Head, a glossy purplish gray, darker on top; between  the eye and the bill is a white crescent-shaped mark about one-fourth  wider in its center than the eye; the wing-coverts are blue like those  of the cinnamon teal; back, dark gray; under parts, gray, spotted with  black; speculum, rich green; bill, black, and legs and feet, yellow.    Female--The female resembles the female of the cinnamon teal; but  unlike the cinnamon it has no dark markings under the chin, or any of  the cinnamon color faintly seen on the cinnamon female. The bill also  is much shorter, and the legs are of a yellowish tinge.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nests are much the same as the other members of  the teal family. The eggs about a dozen in number are pale buff.    =Measurements=--Total length, 15 inches; wing, about 7, and bill,  1-1/2 inches.        [Illustration: SHOVELLER OR SPOON-BILL                   (Spatula clypeata)]      THE SPOON-BILL OR SHOVELLER    (Spatula clypeata)    The shoveler, or spoonbill, as they are commonly called, is also an  early duck upon our ponds; they, too, breed throughout the mountains  of our hunting grounds. When they first arrive on our ponds they are  very fat and finely flavored, but they soon become poor of flesh and  lose the flavor brought with them from their mountain homes. And then  they are generally let pass undisturbed by the discriminating  sportsman.    =Color=--Male--Head and neck, green; breast, white, shading into rusty  chestnut toward the abdomen; lesser wing-coverts, blue; speculum,  green, with white border; legs, orange red.    Female--The female is much smaller than the male and lacks all its  high coloring. The general color is buff, mottled with brown;  wing-coverts and speculum, same as the male.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest, which is a rude affair, generally contains  from seven to ten eggs of a light buff color.    =Measurements=--Total length of the male, about 20 and the female, 18  inches; wing, 9 to 9-1/2; bill, about 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 inches, and very  broad at the end.        [Illustration: PIN-TAIL OR SPRIG (Spatula acuta)]      THE PIN-TAIL    (Dafila acuta)    The pin-tail, or sprig is another very common duck of the Coast. Great  numbers of this species breed on our mountain lakes and, maturing  early, they are about the first to appear upon our shooting grounds,  great flocks reaching as far south as San Diego county, the mouth of  the Colorado river and the lakes and marshes of Lower California,  Arizona and northern Mexico as early as the middle of August or the  first of September. They come from the mountains plump and fat, and as  soon as the shooting season is open prove quite acceptable to the  epicure.    The pin-tail ranges throughout the territory covered by this work and  far to the north of it, and the fact that they breed around the  mountain lakes for the whole distance accounts for their early  appearance on the shooting grounds of the Coast.    =Color=--Male--Head and neck, rich brown, with a white stripe running  from the ociput down the sides of the neck to the breast; bill, lead  color, with a black stripe along the top; back, gray; breast, white;  central tail feathers, very long and pointed; speculum, light smoky  brown, edged with white.    Female--The female is much more of an ocher brown than the male, and  without the stripe on the neck or the lead color of the bill. The top  of the head and the sides of the neck are streaked with brown; breast,  spotted with dark brown; under parts, white. While it somewhat  resembles the female mallard, the much narrower bill and difference of  the speculum should prevent any error in identification. Besides the  tail is pointed and the axillars are white, barred with dark brown.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest is usually back a little distance from the  water's edge and contains from eight to twelve bluish-white eggs.    =Measurements=--Total length, male, 28 and female, 22 inches;  wing, 9-1/2; bill, 2 inches.        [Illustration: WOOD DUCK (Aix sponsa)]      THE WOOD DUCK    (Aix sponsa)    The wood duck, the handsomest of all the American ducks, is not  plentiful anywhere, and seems to be growing fewer in numbers.  Ornithologists class them as resident ducks, breeding throughout their  range. From my personal experience I believe that they are migratory,  at least to a considerable extent, for while many flocks of from half  a dozen to twenty birds can be seen along the timbered portions of the  Sacramento river during the summer months and the early fall, as well  as along other wooded streams of the Coast, few are to be seen during  the shooting season. From this fact I can draw but one conclusion;  they migrate south in the winter. A few are killed each winter but  they can only be considered a rare duck whose beauty lends an  occasional charm to the game bag.    =Color=--Male--The male has a long crest falling down the back of the  neck and showing a green and purple luster; the bill is red with a  dark stripe on top; a broad stripe of white commences under the bill  and passes down the neck, meeting another stripe of white that nearly  encompasses the neck; sides and front of lower neck, brownish purple,  dotted with white; back, a bronze green; speculum, bluish purple,  bordered with black and white.    Female--The general plan of the markings of the female is the same as  that of the male, but the colors are not so bright, nor the crest so  long. The crest is more of a brown, and the breast a pale brown,  mottled with dark spots.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest is built in the hollow of a tree or stump,  and occasionally a considerable distance above the ground. The eggs,  which average about eight, are of a pale brownish white. The young are  taken from the nest in the bill of the mother, and are often seen  perched on her back while she is swimming around in search of food.    =Measurements=--Total length of the male, about 18 inches, with the  female about an inch less; wing, 9-1/4 to 9-1/2; bill 1 3/8 inches.      THE FULVOUS TREE DUCK    (Dendrocygna fulva)    The fulvous tree-duck, commonly called the Mexican tree-duck, and  cavalier, as well as the black-bellied tree-duck (=Dendrocygna  autumnalis=), according to the classification of the ornithologist,  belong to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38077"],[0,"British Birds in Their Haunts (#10)"],[1,"     do this completely.

The art of teaching the Blackbird is of old date, for we  find in Pepys' Diary, May 22, 1663, the following passage: 'Rendall,  the house carpenter at Deptford, hath sent me a fine Blackbird, which  I went to see. He tells me he was offered twenty shillings for him as  he came along, he do so whistle. 23d. Waked this morning between four  and five by my Blackbird, which whistled as well as ever I heard any;  only it is the beginning of many tunes very well, but then leaves them  and goes no further.'    The song of the Blackbird is occasionally heard during the mild days  of winter, but it is not until spring sets in that it can be said to  be in full, uninterrupted song. It then repairs to some thick bush or  hedge, especially at the corner of a pond, and builds its nest, a  bulky structure, the framework of which is composed of twigs and  roots; within is a thin layer of mud lined with small fibrous roots,  bents, and moss. The nest contains four or five eggs, and the young  birds are fed with worms. In the breeding season Blackbirds are far  more venturesome than at any other time, as they frequently select a  garden in which to build their nest, with the double object, perhaps,  of procuring plenty of worms for their nestlings, and of launching  them when fledged where they will have great facilities for regaling  themselves on summer fruits. In such localities the appearance of a  cat near their nest greatly excites their wrath. From being timid they  become very courageous, scolding with all their might, darting down so  near as almost to dash in her face, and generally ending by compelling  her to beat a retreat.    The female Blackbird differs materially from the male, its plumage  being of a dingy brown hue, the breast light and spotted, the beak  dark brown with yellowish edges. White and pied specimens of both  sexes are occasionally met with. In a district of France not far from  Paris they are very numerous, and here the title to a certain estate  used to be kept up by the annual presentation of a white Blackbird to  the lord of the manor. Large flocks from the Continent visit us in the  autumn and winter.        THE RING OUZEL     TURDUS TORQUATUS        Plumage black edged with greyish white; a large      crescent-shaped pure white spot on the throat; bill and legs      dusky. _Female_ with the gorget smaller and tinged with red      and grey, and the rest of the plumage greyer. Length ten      inches. Eggs greenish white, spotted with reddish brown and      grey.    Ring Ouzel is hardly an appropriate name for this bird; for in reality  it does not wear a ring round its neck, but a white gorget on its  breast, the contrast between which and its black plumage is very  striking. It frequents the mountainous parts of Scotland and hilly  parts of Derbyshire, and other wild parts where moors and hills are.  Though never so abundant as the Blackbird and Thrush are in the  plains, it is far from uncommon. It is a migratory bird, arriving in  this country in April, and returning to its southern winter  quarters--Corsica and other islands of the Mediterranean--early in  autumn; not so early, however, as to miss the vintage season of the  south of Europe. In summer it travels as far north as Sweden and  Norway, where, on the authority of Mr. Hewitson, it is often seen  'enlivening the most bleak and desolate islands with its sweet song.  It shares with the Redwing the name of Nightingale, and often  delighted us in our midnight visits amongst the islands.' Its habits  and food while it remains with us are very similar to those of the  Blackbird, and its nest, generally built among stones and bushes, near  the ground, is constructed of the same materials with the nest of that  bird. Towards the end of their sojourn in Britain, Ring Ouzels descend  to the level countries, and are not unfrequently met with in gardens,  whither they repair for the sake of feeding on fruit and berries. In  form and movements the Ring Ouzel is a more elegantly shaped bird than  the Blackbird.        THE WHEATEAR (STONE-SMATCH)[2]     SAXACOLA OENANTHA%        Upper parts, in autumn reddish brown, in spring bluish grey;      wings and wing-coverts, centre and extremity of the tail, legs      and feet, bill and area which comprises the nostrils, eyes and      ears, black; base and lower portion of the side of the tail      pure white; the chin, forehead, stripe over the eyes, and      under parts are also white, and in autumn the tail-feathers      are also tipped with white. _Female_--upper parts ash-brown,      tinged with yellow; stripe over the eyes dingy; all the      colours less bright. Length six and a half inches; breadth      twelve inches. Eggs pale bluish green.    During a considerable portion of its stay with us, open downs near  the sea are the favourite resort of this lively bird, to which it  repairs from its transmarine winter quarters towards the second week  of March. Here it may be seen for several weeks flitting from rock to  rock, and occasionally soaring to the height of about twenty yards  into the air, warbling from time to time its pleasant song, now aloft,  and now restlessly perched on a rock, or bank, or low stone wall,  calling _chack-chack_--and making itself all the more welcome that few  others among our summer visitants have as yet recovered their voices.  We need not suppose that Wheatears prolong their stay on the coast in  order to rest after their voyage. More probably they make marine  insects (for these are abundant even in early spring) the principal  portion of their food, and are taught, by the same instinct which  guided them across the sea, to remain where their wants will be fully  supplied until land insects have emerged from their winter quarters.  As the season advances many of them proceed inland, and repair to  barren districts, whether mountainous or lowland, where they may enjoy  a considerable expanse without any great admixture of trees. A wide  common studded with blocks of stone, a rabbit-warren or sloping  upland, is likely to be more or less thickly peopled by these shy  birds. Shy we term them, because, disposed as they are to be social  among themselves (especially in spring and autumn), they are with  respect to other birds most exclusive. Travelling through the waste  lands of England, one may sometimes go on for miles and see no winged  creatures but an occasional Wheatear, which, with dipping flight, made  conspicuous by the snow-white spot at the base of its tail, shoots  ahead of us some thirty or forty yards, alights on a stone, and, after  a few uneasy upward and downward movements of its tail, starts off  again to repeat the same manA\"uvre, until we begin to wonder what  tempts it to stray away so far from home. It does not ordinarily sing  during these excursions, but utters its occasional note, very  different from its spring song. It builds its nest of grass, moss, and  leaves, and lines it with hair or wool, selecting some very secret  spot on the ground, a deserted rabbit-burrow or cavity under a rock,  where, beyond the reach of any but the most cunning marauder, it lays  five or six eggs. Early in August, when the young are fully fledged,  the scattered colonies of Wheatears assemble for emigration on open  downs near the sea. We have seen a good many of them on the sandy  coast of Norfolk and of North Hales; but it is on the extensive downs  of Sussex that they collect in the largest numbers, not in flocks, but  in parties of six or eight; each party perhaps constituting a family.  They here retain their shy habits of flying off at the approach of a  human being, and are often seen to drop suddenly, where they may  remain concealed from sight behind a stone, furze-bush or bank. The  shepherds and others, whose vocation lies on the downs, used to take  advantage of the habit of these birds to conceal themselves, and  construct a multitude of simple but efficacious traps in which they  capture large numbers. The method which they adopted was to cut out  from the sward an oblong piece of turf about the size of a brick,  which they inverted over the hole from which it was taken so as to  form a cross. Beneath this are placed two running nooses of horsehair,  in which the poor bird, when it takes refuge in one of the open ends  of the hole for concealment, is easily snared. The birds being in fine  condition at this season--having, in fact, fattened themselves  previously to undertaking their long sea voyage--are highly prized as  a dainty article of food. It was formerly the custom for persons who  wanted a dish of Wheatears to supply themselves from the traps,  placing a penny in every hole from which they took a bird; but  afterwards the influx of visitors to the neighbouring watering-places  so much enhanced their value, that the shepherds allowed no such  interference. We once tried the experiment of releasing a bird and  depositing the penny-piece in the trap, when, from a neighbouring  eminence, we were assailed with such a torrent of abuse, that we  declined repeating the experiment. In September, all who have escaped  the sportsman and fowler wing their way to southern lands. It is  thought that the autumnal flocks are partially composed of birds on  their way from high latitudes, which stop to recruit their"]]]
