The trapdoor had been left open, and I thought that was the place it  came through. I listened, and heard a soft rushing sort of noise and a  low crackling and snapping. I did not know what it was, but there was  something in the sound so strange that it made me tremble all over. The  other horses were all awake; some were pulling at their halters, others  stamping.    At last I heard steps outside, and the hostler who had put up the  traveler's horse burst into the stable with a lantern, and began to  untie the horses, and try to lead them out; but he seemed in such a  hurry and so frightened himself that he frightened me still more. The  first horse would not go with him; he tried the second and third, and  they too would not stir. He came to me next and tried to drag me out of  the stall by force; of course that was no use. He tried us all by turns  and then left the stable.    No doubt we were very foolish, but danger seemed to be all round, and  there was nobody we knew to trust in, and all was strange and uncertain.  The fresh air that had come in through the open door made it easier to  breathe, but the rushing sound overhead grew louder, and as I looked  upward through the bars of my empty rack I saw a red light flickering  on the wall. Then I heard a cry of \"Fire!\" outside, and the old hostler  quietly and quickly came in; he got one horse out, and went to another,  but the flames were playing round the trapdoor, and the roaring overhead  was dreadful.    The next thing I heard was James' voice, quiet and cheery, as it always  was.    \"Come, my beauties, it is time for us to be off, so wake up and come  along.\" I stood nearest the door, so he came to me first, patting me as  he came in.    \"Come, Beauty, on with your bridle, my boy, we'll soon be out of this  smother.\" It was on in no time; then he took the scarf off his neck, and  tied it lightly over my eyes, and patting and coaxing he led me out  of the stable. Safe in the yard, he slipped the scarf off my eyes, and  shouted, \"Here somebody! take this horse while I go back for the other.\"    A tall, broad man stepped forward and took me, and James darted back  into the stable. I set up a shrill whinny as I saw him go. Ginger told  me afterward that whinny was the best thing I could have done for her,  for had she not heard me outside she would never have had courage to  come out.    There was much confusion in the yard; the horses being got out of other  stables, and the carriages and gigs being pulled out of houses and  sheds, lest the flames should spread further. On the other side the yard  windows were thrown up, and people were shouting all sorts of things;  but I kept my eye fixed on the stable door, where the smoke poured out  thicker than ever, and I could see flashes of red light; presently I  heard above all the stir and din a loud, clear voice, which I knew was  master's:    \"James Howard! James Howard! Are you there?\" There was no answer, but I  heard a crash of something falling in the stable, and the next moment  I gave a loud, joyful neigh, for I saw James coming through the smoke  leading Ginger with him; she was coughing violently, and he was not able  to speak.    \"My brave lad!\" said master, laying his hand on his shoulder, \"are you  hurt?\"    James shook his head, for he could not yet speak.    \"Ay,\" said the big man who held me; \"he is a brave lad, and no mistake.\"    \"And now,\" said master, \"when you have got your breath, James, we'll get  out of this place as quickly as we can,\" and we were moving toward the  entry, when from the market-place there came a sound of galloping feet  and loud rumbling wheels.    \"'Tis the fire-engine! the fire-engine!\" shouted two or three voices,  \"stand back, make way!\" and clattering and thundering over the stones  two horses dashed into the yard with a heavy engine behind them. The  firemen leaped to the ground; there was no need to ask where the fire  was--it was rolling up in a great blaze from the roof.    We got out as fast as we could into the broad quiet market-place; the  stars were shining, and except the noise behind us, all was still.  Master led the way to a large hotel on the other side, and as soon as  the hostler came, he said, \"James, I must now hasten to your mistress;  I trust the horses entirely to you, order whatever you think is needed,\"  and with that he was gone. The master did not run, but I never saw  mortal man walk so fast as he did that night.    There was a dreadful sound before we got into our stalls--the shrieks of  those poor horses that were left burning to death in the stable--it was  very terrible! and made both Ginger and me feel very bad. We, however,  were taken in and well done by.    The next morning the master came to see how we were and to speak to  James. I did not hear much, for the hostler was rubbing me down, but  I could see that James looked very happy, and I thought the master was  proud of him. Our mistress had been so much alarmed in the night that  the journey was put off till the afternoon, so James had the morning  on hand, and went first to the inn to see about our harness and the  carriage, and then to hear more about the fire. When he came back we  heard him tell the hostler about it. At first no one could guess how the  fire had been caused, but at last a man said he saw Dick Towler go into  the stable with a pipe in his mouth, and when he came out he had not  one, and went to the tap for another. Then the under hostler said he had  asked Dick to go up the ladder to put down some hay, but told him to lay  down his pipe first. Dick denied taking the pipe with him, but no one  believed him. I remember our John Manly's rule, never to allow a pipe in  the stable, and thought it ought to be the rule everywhere.    James said the roof and floor had all fallen in, and that only the black  walls were standing; the two poor horses that could not be got out were  buried under the burnt rafters and tiles.          17 John Manly's Talk      The rest of our journey was very easy, and a little after sunset we  reached the house of my master's friend. We were taken into a clean,  snug stable; there was a kind coachman, who made us very comfortable,  and who seemed to think a good deal of James when he heard about the  fire.    \"There is one thing quite clear, young man,\" he said, \"your horses know  who they can trust; it is one of the hardest things in the world to get  horses out of a stable when there is either fire or flood. I don't know  why they won't come out, but they won't--not one in twenty.\"    We stopped two or three days at this place and then returned home. All  went well on the journey; we were glad to be in our own stable again,  and John was equally glad to see us.    Before he and James left us for the night James said, \"I wonder who is  coming in my place.\"    \"Little Joe Green at the lodge,\" said John.    \"Little Joe Green! why, he's a child!\"    \"He is fourteen and a half,\" said John.    \"But he is such a little chap!\"    \"Yes, he is small, but he is quick and willing, and kind-hearted, too,  and then he wishes very much to come, and his father would like it;  and I know the master would like to give him the chance. He said if I  thought he would not do he would look out for a bigger boy; but I said I  was quite agreeable to try him for six weeks.\"    \"Six weeks!\" said James; \"why, it will be six months before he can be of  much use! It will make you a deal of work, John.\"    \"Well,\" said John with a laugh, \"work and I are very good friends; I  never was afraid of work yet.\"    \"You are a very good man,\" said James. \"I wish I may ever be like you.\"    \"I don't often speak of myself,\" said John, \"but as you are going away  from us out into the world to shift for yourself I'll just tell you how  I look on these things. I was just as old as Joseph when my father and  mother died of the fever within ten days of each other, and left me and  my cripple sister Nelly alone in the world, without a relation that we  could look to for help. I was a farmer's boy, not earning enough to keep  myself, much less both of us, and she must have gone to the workhouse  but for our mistress (Nelly calls her her angel, and she has good right  to do so). She went and hired a room for her with old Widow Mallet, and  she gave her knitting and needlework when she was able to do it; and  when she was ill she sent her dinners and many nice, comfortable things,  and was like a mother to her. Then the master he took me into the stable  under old Norman, the coachman that was then. I had my food at the house  and my bed in the loft, and a suit of clothes, and three shillings a  week, so that I could help Nelly. Then there was Norman; he might have  turned round and said at his age he could not be troubled with a raw boy  from the plow-tail, but he was like a father to me, and took no end of  pains with me. When the old man died some years after I stepped into his  place, and now of course I have top wages, and can lay by for a rainy  day or a sunny day, as it may happen, and Nelly is as happy as a bird.  So you see, James, I am not the man that should turn up his nose at a  little boy and vex a good, kind master. No, no! I shall miss you very  much, James, but we shall pull through, and there's nothing like doing a  kindness when 'tis put in your way, and I am glad I can do it.\"    \"Then,\" said James, \"you don't hold with that saying, 'Everybody look  after himself, and take care of number one'?\"    \"No, indeed,\" said John, \"where should I and Nelly have been if master  and mistress and old Norman had only taken care of number one? Why,  she in the workhouse and I hoeing turnips! Where would Black Beauty and  Ginger have been if you had only thought of number one? why, roasted to  death! No, Jim, no! that is a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2710"],[0,"Louise de la Valliere (#10)"],[1,"to call me Planchet, as you used to do; and to speak  to me as familiarly as in old times. You cannot possibly imagine the  pleasure it would give me.\"    \"If that be the case, my dear Planchet, I will do so, certainly,\"  replied Porthos. And as he was quite close to Planchet, he raised  his hand, as if to strike him on the shoulder, in token of friendly  cordiality; but a fortunate movement of the horse made him miss his aim,  so that his hand fell on the crupper of Planchet's horse, instead; which  made the animal's legs almost give way.    D'Artagnan burst out laughing, as he said, \"Take care, Planchet; for  if Porthos begins to like you so much, he will caress you, and if he  caresses you he will knock you as flat as a pancake. Porthos is still as  strong as ever, you know.\"    \"Oh,\" said Planchet, \"Mousqueton is not dead, and yet monsieur le baron  is very fond of him.\"    \"Certainly,\" said Porthos, with a sigh which made all the three horses  rear; \"and I was only saying, this very morning, to D'Artagnan, how much  I regretted him. But tell me, Planchet?\"    \"Thank you, monsieur le baron, thank you.\"    \"Good lad, good lad! How many acres of park have you got?\"    \"Of park?\"    \"Yes; we will reckon up the meadows presently, and the woods  afterwards.\"    \"Whereabouts, monsieur?\" \"At your chateau.\"    \"Oh, monsieur le baron, I have neither chateau, nor park, nor meadows,  nor woods.\"    \"What have you got, then?\" inquired Porthos, \"and why do you call it a  country-seat?\"    \"I did not call it a country-seat, monsieur le baron,\" replied Planchet,  somewhat humiliated, \"but a country-box.\"    \"Ah, ah! I understand. You are modest.\"    \"No, monsieur le baron, I speak the plain truth. I have rooms for a  couple of friends, that's all.\"    \"But in that case, whereabouts do your friends walk?\"    \"In the first place, they can walk about the king's forest, which is  very beautiful.\"    \"Yes, I know the forest is very fine,\" said Porthos; \"nearly as  beautiful as my forest at Berry.\"    Planchet opened his eyes very wide. \"Have you a forest of the same kind  as the forest at Fontainebleau, monsieur le baron?\" he stammered out.    \"Yes; I have two, indeed, but the one at Berry is my favorite.\"    \"Why so?\" asked Planchet.    \"Because I don't know where it ends; and, also, because it is full of  poachers.\"    \"How can the poachers make the forest so agreeable to you?\"    \"Because they hunt my game, and I hunt them--which, in these peaceful  times, is for me a sufficiently pleasing picture of war on a small  scale.\"    They had reached this turn of conversation, when Planchet, looking up,  perceived the houses at the commencement of Fontainebleau, the lofty  outlines of which stood out strongly against the misty visage of the  heavens; whilst, rising above the compact and irregularly formed mass  of buildings, the pointed roofs of the chateau were clearly visible, the  slates of which glistened beneath the light of the moon, like the scales  of an immense fish. \"Gentlemen,\" said Planchet, \"I have the honor to  inform you that we have arrived at Fontainebleau.\"        Chapter V. Planchet's Country-House.    The cavaliers looked up, and saw that what Planchet had announced to  them was true. Ten minutes afterwards they were in the street called the  Rue de Lyon, on the opposite side of the hostelry of the Beau Paon.  A high hedge of bushy elders, hawthorn, and wild hops formed an  impenetrable fence, behind which rose a white house, with a high tiled  roof. Two of the windows, which were quite dark, looked upon the street.  Between the two, a small door, with a porch supported by a couple of  pillars, formed the entrance to the house. The door was gained by a step  raised a little from the ground. Planchet got off his horse, as if he  intended to knock at the door; but, on second thoughts, he took hold of  his horse by the bridle, and led it about thirty paces further on, his  two companions following him. He then advanced about another thirty  paces, until he arrived at the door of a cart-house, lighted by an  iron grating; and, lifting up a wooden latch, pushed open one of the  folding-doors. He entered first, leading his horse after him by the  bridle, into a small courtyard, where an odor met them which revealed  their close vicinity to a stable. \"That smells all right,\" said Porthos,  loudly, getting off his horse, \"and I almost begin to think I am near my  own cows at Pierrefonds.\"    \"I have only one cow,\" Planchet hastened to say modestly.    \"And I have thirty,\" said Porthos; \"or rather, I don't exactly know how  many I have.\"    When the two cavaliers had entered, Planchet fastened the door behind  them. In the meantime, D'Artagnan, who had dismounted with his usual  agility, inhaled the fresh perfumed air with the delight a Parisian  feels at the sight of green fields and fresh foliage, plucked a piece  of honeysuckle with one hand, and of sweet-briar with the other. Porthos  clawed hold of some peas which were twined round poles stuck into  the ground, and ate, or rather browsed upon them, shells and all: and  Planchet was busily engaged trying to wake up an old and infirm peasant,  who was fast asleep in a shed, lying on a bed of moss, and dressed in  an old stable suit of clothes. The peasant, recognizing Planchet, called  him \"the master,\" to the grocer's great satisfaction. \"Stable the horses  well, old fellow, and you shall have something good for yourself,\" said  Planchet.    \"Yes, yes; fine animals they are too,\" said the peasant. \"Oh! they shall  have as much as they like.\"    \"Gently, gently, my man,\" said D'Artagnan, \"we are getting on a little  too fast. A few oats and a good bed--nothing more.\"    \"Some bran and water for my horse,\" said Porthos, \"for it is very warm,  I think.\"    \"Don't be afraid, gentlemen,\" replied Planchet; \"Daddy Celestin is an  old gendarme, who fought at Ivry. He knows all about horses; so come  into the house.\" And he led the way along a well-sheltered walk, which  crossed a kitchen-garden, then a small paddock, and came out into a  little garden behind the house, the principal front of which, as we have  already noticed, faced the street. As they approached, they could  see, through two open windows on the ground floor, which led into a  sitting-room, the interior of Planchet's residence. This room, softly  lighted by a lamp placed on the table, seemed, from the end of the  garden, like a smiling image of repose, comfort, and happiness. In every  direction where the rays of light fell, whether upon a piece of old  china, or upon an article of furniture shining from excessive neatness,  or upon the weapons hanging against the wall, the soft light was softly  reflected; and its rays seemed to linger everywhere upon something or  another, agreeable to the eye. The lamp which lighted the room, whilst  the foliage of jasmine and climbing roses hung in masses from the  window-frames, splendidly illuminated a damask table-cloth as white as  snow. The table was laid for two persons. Amber-colored wine sparkled  in a long cut-glass bottle; and a large jug of blue china, with a silver  lid, was filled with foaming cider. Near the table, in a high-backed  armchair, reclined, fast asleep, a woman of about thirty years of age,  her face the very picture of health and freshness. Upon her knees lay  a large cat, with her paws folded under her, and her eyes half-closed,  purring in that significant manner which, according to feline habits,  indicates perfect contentment. The two friends paused before the window  in complete amazement, while Planchet, perceiving their astonishment,  was in no little degree secretly delighted at it.    \"Ah! Planchet, you rascal,\" said D'Artagnan, \"I now understand your  absences.\"    \"Oh, oh! there is some white linen!\" said Porthos, in his turn, in a  voice of thunder. At the sound of this gigantic voice, the cat took  flight, the housekeeper woke up with a start, and Planchet, assuming  a gracious air, introduced his two companions into the room, where the  table was already laid.    \"Permit me, my dear,\" he said, \"to present to you Monsieur le Chevalier  d'Artagnan, my patron.\" D'Artagnan took the lady's hand in his in the  most courteous manner, and with precisely the same chivalrous air as he  would have taken Madame's.    \"Monsieur le Baron du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds,\" added  Planchet. Porthos bowed with a reverence which Anne of Austria would  have approved of.    It was then Planchet's turn, and he unhesitatingly embraced the lady  in question, not, however, until he had made a sign as if requesting  D'Artagnan's and Porthos's permission, a permission as a matter of  course frankly conceded. D'Artagnan complimented Planchet, and said,  \"You are indeed a man who knows how to make life agreeable.\"    \"Life, monsieur,\" said Planchet, laughing, \"is capital which a man ought  to invest as sensibly as he possibly can.\"    \"And you get very good interest for yours,\" said Porthos, with a burst  of laughter like a peal of thunder.    Planchet turned to his housekeeper. \"You have before you,\" he said to  her, \"the two gentlemen who influenced the greatest, gayest, grandest  portion of my life. I have spoken to you about them both very  frequently.\"    \"And about two others as well,\" said the lady, with a very decided  Flemish accent.    \"Madame is Dutch?\" inquired D'Artagnan. Porthos curled his mustache, a  circumstance which was not lost upon D'Artagnan, who noticed everything.    \"I am from Antwerp,\" said the lady.    \"And her name is Madame Getcher,\" said Planchet.    \"You should not call her madame,\" said D'Artagnan.    \"Why not?\" asked Planchet.    \"Because it would make her seem older every time you call her so.\"    \"Well, I call her Truchen.\"    \"And a very pretty name too,\" said Porthos.    \"Truchen,\" said Planchet, \"came to me from Flanders with her virtue and  two thousand florins. She ran away from a brute of a husband who"]]]
