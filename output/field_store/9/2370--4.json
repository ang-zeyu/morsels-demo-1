These hills looked so quiet and sunny and well kept  that they reminded one of a New England orchard.  There was a blue  bungalow on a hill to the right, a red bungalow higher up on the right,  and in the centre the block-house of San Juan, which looked like a  Chinese pagoda.  Three-quarters of a mile behind them, with a dip  between, were the long white walls of the hospital and barracks of  Santiago, wearing thirteen Red Cross flags, and, as was pointed out to  the foreign attaches later, two six-inch guns a hundred yards in advance  of the Red Cross flags.    It was so quiet, so fair, and so prosperous looking that it breathed of  peace.  It seemed as though one might, without accident, walk in and take  dinner at the Venus Restaurant, or loll on the benches in the Plaza, or  rock in one of the great bent-wood chairs around the patio of the Don  Carlos Club.    But, on the 27th of June, a long, yellow pit opened in the hill-side of  San Juan, and in it we could see straw sombreros rising and bobbing up  and down, and under the shade of the block-house, blue-coated Spaniards  strolling leisurely about or riding forth on little white ponies to  scamper over the hills.  Officers of every regiment, _attaches_ of  foreign countries, correspondents, and staff officers daily reported the  fact that the rifle-pits were growing in length and in number, and that  in plain sight from the hill of El Poso the enemy was intrenching himself  at San Juan, and at the little village of El Caney to the right, where he  was marching through the streets.  But no artillery was sent to El Poso  hill to drop a shell among the busy men at work among the trenches, or to  interrupt the street parades in El Caney.  For four days before the  American soldiers captured the same rifle-pits at El Caney and San Juan,  with a loss of two thousand men, they watched these men diligently  preparing for their coming, and wondered why there was no order to  embarrass or to end these preparations.    On the afternoon of June 30, Captain Mills rode up to the tent of Colonel  Wood, and told him that on account of illness, General Wheeler and  General Young had relinquished their commands, and that General Sumner  would take charge of the Cavalry Division; that he, Colonel Wood, would  take command of General Young's brigade, and Colonel Carroll, of General  Sumner's brigade.    \"You will break camp and move forward at four o'clock,\" he said.  It was  then three o'clock, and apparently the order to move forward at four had  been given to each regiment at nearly the same time, for they all struck  their tents and stepped down into the trail together.  It was as though  fifteen regiments were encamped along the sidewalks of Fifth Avenue and  were all ordered at the same moment to move into it and march downtown.  If Fifth Avenue were ten feet wide, one can imagine the confusion.    General Chaffee was at General Lawton's head-quarters, and they stood  apart whispering together about the march they were to take to El Caney.  Just over their heads the balloon was ascending for the first time and  its great glistening bulk hung just above the tree tops, and the men in  different regiments, picking their way along the trail, gazed up at it  open-mouthed.  The head-quarters camp was crowded.  After a week of  inaction the army, at a moment's notice, was moving forward, and every  one had ridden in haste to learn why.    There were _attaches_, in strange uniforms, self-important Cuban  generals, officers from the flagship _New York_, and an army of  photographers.  At the side of the camp, double lines of soldiers passed  slowly along the two paths of the muddy road, while, between them, aides  dashed up and down, splashing them with dirty water, and shouting, \"You  will come up at once, sir.\"  \"You will not attempt to enter the trail  yet, sir.\"  \"General Sumner's compliments, and why are you not in your  place?\"    Twelve thousand men, with their eyes fixed on a balloon, and treading on  each other's heels in three inches of mud, move slowly, and after three  hours, it seemed as though every man in the United States was under arms  and stumbling and slipping down that trail.  The lines passed until the  moon rose.  They seemed endless, interminable; there were cavalry mounted  and dismounted, artillery with cracking whips and cursing drivers, Rough  Riders in brown, and regulars, both black and white, in blue.  Midnight  came, and they were still stumbling and slipping forward.    General Sumner's head-quarters tent was pitched to the right of El Poso  hill.  Below us lay the basin a mile and a half in length, and a mile and  a half wide, from which a white mist was rising.  Near us, drowned under  the mist, seven thousand men were sleeping, and, farther to the right,  General Chaffee's five thousand were lying under the bushes along the  trails to El Caney, waiting to march on it and eat it up before  breakfast.    The place hardly needs a map to explain it.  The trails were like a  pitchfork, with its prongs touching the hills of San Juan.  The long  handle of the pitchfork was the trail over which we had just come, the  joining of the handle and the prongs were El Poso.  El Caney lay half-way  along the right prong, the left one was the trail down which, in the  morning, the troops were to be hurled upon San Juan.  It was as yet an  utterly undiscovered country.  Three miles away, across the basin of  mist, we could see the street lamps of Santiago shining over the San Juan  hills.  Above us, the tropical moon hung white and clear in the dark  purple sky, pierced with millions of white stars.  As we turned in, there  was just a little something in the air which made saying \"good-night\" a  gentle farce, for no one went to sleep immediately, but lay looking up at  the stars, and after a long silence, and much restless turning on the  blanket which we shared together, the second lieutenant said: \"So, if  anything happens to me, to-morrow, you'll see she gets them, won't you?\"  Before the moon rose again, every sixth man who had slept in the mist  that night was either killed or wounded; but the second lieutenant was  sitting on the edge of a Spanish rifle-pit, dirty, sweaty, and weak for  food, but victorious, and the unknown she did not get them.    El Caney had not yet thrown off her blanket of mist before Capron's  battery opened on it from a ridge two miles in the rear.  The plan for  the day was that El Caney should fall in an hour.  The plan for the day  is interesting chiefly because it is so different from what happened.  According to the plan the army was to advance in two divisions along the  two trails.  Incidentally, General Lawton's division was to pick up El  Caney, and when El Caney was eliminated, his division was to continue  forward and join hands on the right with the divisions of General Sumner  and General Kent.  The army was then to rest for that night in the woods,  half a mile from San Juan.    On the following morning it was to attack San Juan on the two flanks,  under cover of artillery.  The objection to this plan, which did not  apparently suggest itself to General Shafter, was that an army of twelve  thousand men, sleeping within five hundred yards of the enemy's  rifle-pits, might not unreasonably be expected to pass a bad night.  As  we discovered the next day, not only the five hundred yards, but the  whole basin was covered by the fire from the rifle-pits.  Even by  daylight, when it was possible to seek some slight shelter, the army  could not remain in the woods, but according to the plan it was expected  to bivouac for the night in those woods, and in the morning to manoeuvre  and deploy and march through them to the two flanks of San Juan.  How the  enemy was to be hypnotized while this was going forward it is difficult  to understand.    According to this programme, Capron's battery opened on El Caney and  Grimes's battery opened on the pagoda-like block-house of San Juan.  The  range from El Poso was exactly 2,400 yards, and the firing, as was  discovered later, was not very effective.  The battery used black powder,  and, as a result, after each explosion the curtain of smoke hung over the  gun for fully a minute before the gunners could see the San Juan  trenches, which was chiefly important because for a full minute it gave a  mark to the enemy.  The hill on which the battery stood was like a  sugar-loaf.  Behind it was the farm-house of El Poso, the only building  in sight within a radius of a mile, and in it were Cuban soldiers and  other non-combatants.  The Rough Riders had been ordered to halt in the  yard of the farm-house and the artillery horses were drawn up in it,  under the lee of the hill.  The First and Tenth dismounted Cavalry were  encamped a hundred yards from the battery along the ridge.  They might as  sensibly have been ordered to paint the rings in a target while a company  was firing at the bull's-eye.  To our first twenty shots the enemy made  no reply; when they did it was impossible, owing to their using smokeless  powder, to locate their guns.  Their third shell fell in among the Cubans  in the block-house and among the Rough Riders and the men of the First  and Tenth Cavalry, killing some and wounding many.  These casualties were  utterly unnecessary and were due to the stupidity of whoever placed the  men within fifty yards of guns in action.      [Picture: Grime's battery at El Poso.  The third Spanish shell fell in       among the Cubans in the block-house and among the Rough Riders]    A quarter of an hour after the firing began from El Poso one of General  Shafter's aides directed General Sumner to advance with his division down  the Santiago trail, and to halt at the edge of the woods.    \"What am I to do then?\" asked General Sumner.    \"You are to await further orders,\" the aide answered.

[Illustration: Fig. 34. The table is too high, and the position is  oblique and improper. The right shoulder is seen higher than the left,  while the spinal column, 1, 1, exhibits three curves.]    140. One shoulder may be elevated, and no injurious results follow,  provided care is taken not to keep it in the raised position too long,  or if the opposite shoulder is elevated for the same period of time.  The right shoulder projects more frequently than the left. This arises  from the greater use of the right hand with the shoulder elevated, and  not unfrequently the oblique positions assumed in performing the daily  vocations of life. With proper care, and by calling into action the  left shoulder, this deformity can be prevented.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    What experiment is mentioned? What does fig. 34 represent? 140. How  can one shoulder be elevated and no injurious results follow?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    [Illustration: Fig. 35. A representation of a deformed trunk.]    141. The loss of symmetry and diminution of height from deformed  spines are minor considerations, compared with the distortions that  the chest experiences, thereby impairing respiration and inducing  diseases of the heart and lungs. The invasion of the functions of  these two important organs lessens the vitality of the whole system,  and causes general ill health. Again, the curvature of the spinal  column is frequently attended by irritation and disease of the spinal  cord.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    Why does the right shoulder project more frequently than the left? How  can this deformity be prevented? 141. What is said of deformed spinal  columns?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    142. Eminent physicians, both in this country and France state that  not more than one female in ten, who has been fashionably educated, is  free from deformities of the shoulder or spinal column. Teachers, as  well as mothers, should notice the positions of the child in  performing the tasks allotted to it, whether studying or pursuing any  employment. The feebler the organization of the child, the more  frequently should there be a change of position.    143. When a slight projection of the shoulder, with a curvature of the  spine, exists, it can be improved by walking with a book, or something  heavier, upon the head; to balance which, the spinal column must be  nearly erect. Those people that carry burdens upon their heads seldom  have crooked spines.    _Observation._ Persons from the North, in travelling through the  Southern States, are surprised to see the heavy burdens that the  porters carry on their heads. It is not unusual to see them walking at  a rapid pace, with one or two trunks, weighing fifty or eighty pounds  each, upon their heads. Occasionally, we meet an itinerant toy-man,  with his tray of fragile merchandise upon his head, walking with as  much apparent security, as though his toys, or images, were in his  hands. This is the easiest method of carrying burdens, because the  position of the head and spinal column is erect.    144. _If the animal and earthy matter of the bones is not deposited in  proper proportions, they are deficient in strength._ If the gelatin  predominates, the bones are weak, and become distorted. When  nutrition is defective in the cylindrical bones, the heads are  generally enlarged, and the shafts crooked; if in the spinal column,  it may be curved; or in the cranium, it may be enlarged. This disease  is familiarly known by the name of rickets. It is most common among  these who have poor and insufficient food, live in dark, damp rooms,  and breathe a vitiated air. The prevention and remedies for this  disease are cleanliness, regular exercise, pure air, and nutritious  food.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    142. What statement by eminent physicians respecting deformities of  the spine? What caution to teachers and mothers? 143. Why should we  stand and sit erect? How may slight deformities of the spine be  prevented? What is frequently noticed in travelling South? 144. What  is the effect upon the bones when the gelatin preponderates?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    145. When a bone is broken, some days elapse before the substance that  reunites it is thrown out from the blood. In young persons, it may be  secreted during the second or third week, and in individuals advanced  in life, usually during the third and fourth week. When the bone is  uniting, during the second, third, or fourth week, the attention of a  surgeon is more needed than during the first week. At this time, the  ends of the bone should be placed together with accuracy, which  requires the careful application of proper dressing. After the bones  have united, it will take some weeks to consolidate the uniting  material and render the \"callus,\" or union, firm. During this time,  the limb should be used with care.    _Observation._ When a bone is fractured, a surgeon is immediately  called, and the bone is \"set.\" While the limb remains swelled and  painful, the surgeon is required to attend and keep the dressings  (bandages and splints) on. When the swelling has abated, and the pain  subsided, frequently the patient intimates to the surgeon that his  services can be dispensed with, as the \"limb is doing well.\" This is  the most important period, as the bone is uniting, and, unless the  ends are nicely adjusted, the dressing properly applied, the person  will find, on recovery, a shortened and crooked limb. The surgeon is  then censured, when he is not blamable.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    What is one cause of rickets? What are the prevention and remedies for  this disease? 145. Does the time vary when the reuniting substance of  the bone is secreted from the blood? When is the surgeon's care most  needed? Why?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    146. It is seldom that a bone is displaced without injury to the  connecting ligaments and membranes. When these connecting bands are  lacerated, pain, swelling, and other symptoms indicating inflammation  succeed, which should be removed by proper treatment, directed by a  surgical adviser.    147. In sprains, but few, if any, of the fibres of the connecting  ligaments are lacerated; but they are unduly strained and twisted,  which occasions acute pain at the time of the injury. This is followed  by inflammation and weakness of the joints. The treatment of these  injuries is similar to that of a dislocated bone after its reduction.  The most important item in the treatment during the few first days, is  rest.    148. In persons of scrofulous constitutions, and those in whom the  system is enfeebled by disease, white swellings and other chronic  diseases of the joints frequently succeed sprains. Such persons cannot  be too assiduous in adopting a proper and early treatment of injured  joints.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    146. What parts are injured in the displacement of a bone? 147. What  causes the acute pain in sprains? What is a good remedy for this kind  of injury? 148. What caution to persons of scrofulous constitutions?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=          CHAPTER VIII    THE MUSCLES.      149. All the great motions of the body are caused by the movement of  some of the bones which form the framework of the system; but these,  independently of themselves, have not the power of motion, and only  change their position through the action of other organs attached to  them, which, by contracting, draw the bones after them. In some of the  slight movements, as the winking of the eye, no bones are displaced.  These moving, contracting organs are the _Mus'cles_, (lean meat.)      ANATOMY OF THE MUSCLES.    150. The MUSCLES, by their size and number, constitute the great bulk  of the body, upon which they bestow form and symmetry. In the limbs,  they are situated around the bones, which they invest and defend,  while they form, to some of the joints, their principal protection. In  the trunk, they are spread out to enclose cavities, and constitute a  defensive wall, capable of yielding to internal pressure, and  reassuming its original state.    151. In structure, a muscle is composed of _fas-cic'u-li_ (bundles of  fibres) of variable size. These are enclosed in a cellular membranous  investment, or sheath. Every bundle composed of a number of small  fibres, and each fibre consists of a number of filaments, each of  which is enclosed in a delicate sheath. Toward the extremity of the  organ the muscular fibre ceases, and the cellular structure becomes  aggregated, and so modified as to constitute _ten'dons_, (cords,) by  which the muscle is tied to the surface of the bone. The union is so  firm, that, under extreme violence, the bone will sooner break than  permit the tendon to separate from its attachment. In some situations,  there is an expansion of the tendon, in the manner of a membrane,  called _Ap-o-neu-ro'sis_, or _Fas'ci-a_.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    149. How are all the motions of the body produced? What are these  motor organs called? 150-160. _Give the anatomy of the muscles._ 150.  What is said of the muscles? 151. Give their structure.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    _Observation._ The pupil can examine a piece of boiled beef, or the  leg of a fowl, and see the structure of the fibres and tendons of a  muscle.    [Illustration: Fig. 36. 1, A representation of the direction and  arrangement of the fibres in a fusiform, or spindle-shaped muscle. 2, In  a radiated muscle. 3, In a penniform muscle. 4, In a bipenniform muscle.  _t_, _t_, The tendons of a muscle.]    152. Muscles present various modifications in the arrangement of their  fibres, as relates to their tendinous structure. Sometimes they are  completely longitudinal, and terminate, at each extremity, in a  tendon, the entire muscle being spindle-shaped. In other situations,  they are disposed like the rays of a fan,"]]]
