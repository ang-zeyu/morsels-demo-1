He was in good spirits, and if there was anything troubling him  he gave no sign of it. He was by nature quiet and rather reserved,\" she  said.    \"Yes, she knew his habit of sometimes going to the lake shore beyond the  town to practice at target-shooting, but when he did not appear at his  post at nine o'clock, she never thought to send to the lake shore at  first, because he usually returned from his morning exercise before nine  o'clock; and so her first thought had been to send to Mrs. Fry's.\"    When the doctor and Robert were about to leave the scene of the murder,  among other instructions given to Doran had been this:    \"Don't say anything in town about Mr. Brierly's arrival; you know how  curious our people are, and we would have a lot of our curiosity lovers  hovering around my place to see and hear and ask questions. Just caution  the others, will you?\"    Doran held an acknowledged leadership over the men with whom he  consorted, and the group willingly preserved silence. Later, when Doctor  Barnes explained to Ferrars how he had kept the curious away from his  door, and from Brierly, he thought the detective's gratification because  of this rather strange, just at first, and in excess of the cause.    \"You couldn't have done a better thing,\" Ferrars had declared. \"It's  more than I had ventured to hope. Keep Brierly's identity as close as  possible until the inquest is called, and then hold it back, and do not  put him on the stand until the last.\"    After Mrs. Fry, the boy Peter and Hilda Grant had been questioned,  Samuel Doran took the witness chair, telling of his summons from Miss  Grant, of the separation of the group at the Indian Mound, of his  meeting with Mrs. Jamieson, of the discovery made by his two companions  and of all that followed. And then Mrs. Jamieson was called.    She had entered the place accompanied by an acquaintance from the  Glenville, and they had taken, from choice, as it seemed to them, seats  in the rear of the jury, and somewhat aloof from the place where Hilda  Grant, Mrs. Marcy, and Mrs. Fry sat. Robert Brierly would have taken his  place beside Hilda, but the detective interposed.    \"Owing to the precautions of the doctor and Mr. Doran, the fact of your  relationship has not leaked out. It appears that Mrs. Fry was not  informed of your coming until the evening before, or Thursday evening,  and she seems to be a very discreet woman. After the inquest you will be  free to devote yourself to Miss Grant. Until then, it is my whim, if you  like, to keep you incog.\"    Of course Brierly acquiesced, but more than once he found himself  wondering why this should seem to Ferrars needful.    Mrs. Jamieson came quietly to the witnesses' chair, and took her place.  There was a little stir as she came forward, for, while she had been for  some weeks in Glenville, and had driven much about its pretty country  roads and lanes, she had gone, for the most part, more or less closely  veiled in fleecy gauzes of black or white. Afoot she was seldom seen  beyond the grounds about the family hotel.    To-day, however, the lady had chosen to wear a Parisian looking gown of  dull black silk and a tiny capote of the same material rested upon her  blonde and abundant hair, while only the filmiest of white illusion  veiled, but did not hide, the pretty face from which the blue eyes  looked out and about her, gravely but with perfect self-possession.    She told of her morning drive, and while so doing, Ferrars, sitting a  little in the rear of the coroner, slipped into his palm a small card  closely written upon both sides. Upon one side was written, \"Use these  as random shots.\"    And when she spoke of the man whom she had seen going into the wood near  the mound, the doctor interposed his first question.    \"Can you describe the person at all? His dress, his bearing?\"    \"Not distinctly,\" she replied. \"He was going from me and his face, of  course, I could not see. In fact, as I have before stated, my pony was  fresh, and required my attention. Besides, there was really no reason  why I should look a second time at the back of a strange person whom I  passed at some little distance. As I seem to recall the figure now, it  was that of a rather tall, fair-haired man. I can say no more.\"    \"And at what hour was this?\"    \"It must have been nearing eight o'clock, I fancy, although being out  for pleasure I took little notice of the hour.\"    No further interruptions were made until she had finished the story of  the morning's experience, of her meeting with Doran and the others, of  the drive to the village, and of her message to Miss Grant.    \"Did you know Miss Grant?\"    \"Only as I had seen her at church, and upon the street or in the  school-yard. We had never met, prior to that morning.\"    \"And Charles Brierly? Did you know him?\"    \"Only by sight. I know few people in Glenville outside of my ho--of the  Glenville House.\"    Both the doctor and Ferrars noted the unfinished word broken off at the  first syllable. To the one it was a riddle; to the other it told  something which he might find useful later on.    \"Mrs. Jamieson,\" resumed the coroner, after consulting the detective's  card, \"how far did you drive yesterday before you turned about upon the  wood road?\"    For a moment the lady seemed to be questioning her memory. Then she  replied.    \"The distance in miles, or fractions of miles, I could not give. I  turned the pony about, I remember, at the place where the road curves  toward the lake, at the old mill, near the opening of the wood.\"    \"Ah, then you could see, of course, for some distance up and down the  lake shore?\"    \"I could!\"    There was a hint of surprise in her coldly courteous reply.    \"And at that point did you see anything, any one in the wood, or along  the lake?\"    \"I certainly saw no person. But--yes, I do remember that there was a  boat at the water's edge, not far from the place where I turned  homeward. It was a little beyond, or north of me.\"    \"Did you observe whether there were oars in the boat?\"    \"I saw none, I am quite sure,\" the lady replied, and this ended her part  in the inquiry.    But now there were some youthful, eager and valuable new witnesses, and  their combined testimony amounted to this:    When the body of their beloved teacher had been brought home and the  first hour of excitement had passed, three boys, who had been among  Charles Brierly's brightest and most mischief loving and adventurous  pupils, had set out, a full hour in advance of the elder exploring  party, and had followed the lake shore and the wood road, one closely  skirting the lake shore, another running through the sparse timber and  undergrowth about half way up the shallow slope, and the third trotting  down the road beyond; the three keeping pretty nearly parallel, until  the discovery, by the lad upon the shore, of the boat drawn out of the  water, and in the shade of a tree. This had brought the others down to  the lake and then caused them to go hastily back. Meeting the party of  men, who were not far behind them, the boys had turned back with them,  and now there was a crowd of witnesses to corroborate the story of the  boat.    It stood, they all affirmed, in the shade of a spreading tree, so as  that no sun rays had beaten upon it, and its sides were still damp from  recent contact with the water, while it stood entirely upon the land.  Two oars, also showing signs of contact with the lake, were in the  little boat, blade ends down, and it was evident that its late occupant  had disembarked in haste, for, while the stake by which the boat had  been secured, stood scarcely three feet away, and the chain and padlock  lay over the edge of the little craft, there had been no effort to  secure it, and the oars had the look of having been hastily shipped and  left thus without further care.    When the matter of the boat had been fully investigated, the coroner and  Ferrars conferred together for some moments, and during these moments  Mrs. Jamieson and her companion exchanged some whispered words.    Through some mistake, it would seem, these two had been given places  which, while aloof from the strange men, and almost in the rear of the  jurors, brought them facing the open door of the inner room, where, in  full view, the shrouded body of the murdered man lay, and from the first  the eyes of the two seemed held and fascinated by the sight of the long,  still figure outlined under the white covering.    \"Is it possible,\" whispered the lady witness, \"that we must sit here  until the end, face to face with that!\" She was trembling slightly, as  she spoke. \"It is making me nervous.\"    \"And no wonder,\" murmured her friend. \"But it must be almost over. I--I  confess to some curiosity. This is such a new and unusual sensation, to  be here, you know.\"    \"Ugh!\"    Mrs. Jamieson turned away, for the coroner was speaking.    \"There is one point,\" he said, \"upon which our witnesses differ, and  that is the mental condition of the deceased during the twenty-four  hours preceding his death. Another witness will now speak upon this  matter. Mr. Robert Brierly, the brother of Charles Brierly, will now  testify.\"    As Robert Brierly came out from the rather secluded place he had  heretofore occupied, at the suggestion of the detective, all eyes were  fixed upon him. There could be no doubt of his relationship to the  deceased. It was the same face, but darker and stronger; the same tall  form, but broader and more athletic. The eyes of this man were darker  and more resolute than those of his dead brother; his hair was browner,  too, and where the face of the one had been full of kindliness and  gentle dignity, that of this other was strong, spirited and resolute.  But, beyond a doubt, these two were brothers.    There was a stir as Brierly made his way forward, paused before the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3533"],[0,"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town (#10)"],[1," a sort of amendment to the constitution. And there's Dean  Drone, the Chaplain of the Order, with a fishing-rod (you never saw  such green bass as lie among the rocks at Indian's Island), and with  a trolling line in case of maskinonge, and a landing net in case of  pickerel, and with his eldest daughter, Lilian Drone, in case of young  men. There never was such a fisherman as the Rev. Rupert Drone.      Perhaps I ought to explain that when I speak of the excursion as being  of the Knights of Pythias, the thing must not be understood in any  narrow sense. In Mariposa practically everybody belongs to the Knights  of Pythias just as they do to everything else. That's the great thing  about the town and that's what makes it so different from the city.  Everybody is in everything.    You should see them on the seventeenth of March, for example, when  everybody wears a green ribbon and they're all laughing and glad,--you  know what the Celtic nature is,--and talking about Home Rule.    On St. Andrew's Day every man in town wears a thistle and shakes hands  with everybody else, and you see the fine old Scotch honesty beaming out  of their eyes.    And on St. George's Day!--well, there's no heartiness like the good old  English spirit, after all; why shouldn't a man feel glad that he's an  Englishman?    Then on the Fourth of July there are stars and stripes flying over half  the stores in town, and suddenly all the men are seen to smoke cigars,  and to know all about Roosevelt and Bryan and the Philippine Islands.  Then you learn for the first time that Jeff Thorpe's people came from  Massachusetts and that his uncle fought at Bunker Hill (it must have  been Bunker Hill,--anyway Jefferson will swear it was in Dakota all  right enough); and you find that George Duff has a married sister in  Rochester and that her husband is all right; in fact, George was down  there as recently as eight years ago. Oh, it's the most American town  imaginable is Mariposa,--on the fourth of July.    But wait, just wait, if you feel anxious about the solidity of the  British connection, till the twelfth of the month, when everybody is  wearing an orange streamer in his coat and the Orangemen (every man in  town) walk in the big procession. Allegiance! Well, perhaps you remember  the address they gave to the Prince of Wales on the platform of the  Mariposa station as he went through on his tour to the west. I think  that pretty well settled that question. So you will easily understand  that of course everybody belongs to the Knights of Pythias and the  Masons and Oddfellows, just as they all belong to the Snow Shoe Club and  the Girls' Friendly Society.    And meanwhile the whistle of the steamer has blown again for a quarter  to seven:--loud and long this time, for any one not here now is late  for certain; unless he should happen to come down in the last fifteen  minutes.    What a crowd upon the wharf and how they pile on to the steamer! It's a  wonder that the boat can hold them all. But that's just the marvellous  thing about the Mariposa Belle.    I don't know,--I have never known,--where the steamers like the Mariposa  Belle come from. Whether they are built by Harland and Wolff of Belfast,  or whether, on the other hand, they are not built by Harland and Wolff  of Belfast, is more than one would like to say offhand.    The Mariposa Belle always seems to me to have some of those strange  properties that distinguish Mariposa itself. I mean, her size seems to  vary so. If you see her there in the winter, frozen in the ice beside  the wharf with a snowdrift against the windows of the pilot house, she  looks a pathetic little thing the size of a butternut. But in the summer  time, especially after you've been in Mariposa for a month or two, and  have paddled alongside of her in a canoe, she gets larger and taller,  and with a great sweep of black sides, till you see no difference  between the Mariposa Belle and the Lusitania. Each one is a big steamer  and that's all you can say.    Nor do her measurements help you much. She draws about eighteen inches  forward, and more than that,--at least half an inch more, astern, and  when she's loaded down with an excursion crowd she draws a good two  inches more. And above the water,--why, look at all the decks on her!  There's the deck you walk on to, from the wharf, all shut in, with  windows along it, and the after cabin with the long table, and above  that the deck with all the chairs piled upon it, and the deck in front  where the band stand round in a circle, and the pilot house is higher  than that, and above the pilot house is the board with the gold name and  the flag pole and the steel ropes and the flags; and fixed in somewhere  on the different levels is the lunch counter where they sell the  sandwiches, and the engine room, and down below the deck level, beneath  the water line, is the place where the crew sleep. What with steps and  stairs and passages and piles of cordwood for the engine,--oh no, I  guess Harland and Wolff didn't build her. They couldn't have.    Yet even with a huge boat like the Mariposa Belle, it would be  impossible for her to carry all of the crowd that you see in the boat  and on the wharf. In reality, the crowd is made up of two classes,--all  of the people in Mariposa who are going on the excursion and all those  who are not. Some come for the one reason and some for the other.    The two tellers of the Exchange Bank are both there standing side by  side. But one of them,--the one with the cameo pin and the long face  like a horse,--is going, and the other,--with the other cameo pin and  the face like another horse,--is not. In the same way, Hussell of the  Newspacket is going, but his brother, beside him, isn't. Lilian Drone is  going, but her sister can't; and so on all through the crowd.      And to think that things should look like that on the morning of a  steamboat accident.    How strange life is!    To think of all these people so eager and anxious to catch the steamer,  and some of them running to catch it, and so fearful that they might  miss it,--the morning of a steamboat accident. And the captain blowing  his whistle, and warning them so severely that he would leave them  behind,--leave them out of the accident! And everybody crowding so  eagerly to be in the accident.    Perhaps life is like that all through.    Strangest of all to think, in a case like this, of the people who were  left behind, or in some way or other prevented from going, and always  afterwards told of how they had escaped being on board the Mariposa  Belle that day!    Some of the instances were certainly extraordinary. Nivens, the lawyer,  escaped from being there merely by the fact that he was away in the  city.    Towers, the tailor, only escaped owing to the fact that, not intending  to go on the excursion he had stayed in bed till eight o'clock and so  had not gone. He narrated afterwards that waking up that morning  at half-past five, he had thought of the excursion and for some  unaccountable reason had felt glad that he was not going.      The case of Yodel, the auctioneer, was even more inscrutable. He had  been to the Oddfellows' excursion on the train the week before and to  the Conservative picnic the week before that, and had decided not to  go on this trip. In fact, he had not the least intention of going. He  narrated afterwards how the night before someone had stopped him on the  corner of Nippewa and Tecumseh Streets (he indicated the very spot) and  asked: \"Are you going to take in the excursion to-morrow?\" and he had  said, just as simply as he was talking when narrating it: \"No.\" And ten  minutes after that, at the corner of Dalhousie and Brock Streets (he  offered to lead a party of verification to the precise place) somebody  else had stopped him and asked: \"Well, are you going on the steamer trip  to-morrow?\" Again he had answered: \"No,\" apparently almost in the same  tone as before.    He said afterwards that when he heard the rumour of the accident  it seemed like the finger of Providence, and fell on his knees in  thankfulness.    There was the similar case of Morison (I mean the one in Glover's  hardware store that married one of the Thompsons). He said afterwards  that he had read so much in the papers about accidents lately,--mining  accidents, and aeroplanes and gasoline,--that he had grown nervous. The  night before his wife had asked him at supper: \"Are you going on the  excursion?\" He had answered: \"No, I don't think I feel like it,\" and had  added: \"Perhaps your mother might like to go.\" And the next evening just  at dusk, when the news ran through the town, he said the first thought  that flashed through his head was: \"Mrs. Thompson's on that boat.\"    He told this right as I say it--without the least doubt or confusion. He  never for a moment imagined she was on the Lusitania or the Olympic  or any other boat. He knew she was on this one. He said you could have  knocked him down where he stood. But no one had. Not even when he got  halfway down,--on his knees, and it would have been easier still to  knock him down or kick him. People do miss a lot of chances.    Still, as I say, neither Yodel nor Morison nor anyone thought about  there being an accident until just after sundown when they--    Well, have you ever heard the long booming whistle of a steamboat two  miles out on the lake in the dusk, and while you listen and count and  wonder, seen the crimson rockets going up against the sky and then heard  the fire bell ringing right there beside you in the town, and seen the  people running to the town wharf?    That's what the people of Mariposa saw and felt that summer evening as  they watched the Mackinaw life-boat go plunging out into the lake  with seven sweeps to a side and the foam clear to the gunwale with the  lifting stroke of fourteen men!    But, dear me, I am afraid that this is no way to tell a story. I suppose  the true "]]]
