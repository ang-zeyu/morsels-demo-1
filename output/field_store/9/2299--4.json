No, an the contrary, the wound, though still open, is in a  good state; and I owe that not only to the excellent nursing around me,  but also to the pure blood that I received from you, my mother. Thus I  have lacked neither earthly assistance nor heavenly encouragement. Thus,  on the anniversary of my birth, I had every reason--oh, not to curse the  hour in which I was born, but, on the contrary, after serious  contemplation of the world, to thank God and you, my dear parents, for  the life that you have given me! I celebrated it, on the 18th of  October, by a peaceful and ardent submission to the holy will of God. On  Christmas Day I tried to put myself into the temper of children who are  devoted to the Lord; and with God's help the new year will pass like its  predecessor, in bodily pain, perhaps, but certainly in spiritual joy.  And with this wish, the only one that I form, I address myself to you,  my dear parents, and to you and yours, my dear brothers and sisters.    \"I cannot hope to see a twenty-fifth new year; so may the prayer that I  have just made be granted! May this picture of my present state afford  you some tranquillity, and may this letter that I write to you from the  depths of my heart not only prove to you that I am not unworthy of the  inexpressible love that you all display, but, on the contrary, ensure  this love to me for eternity.    \"Within the last few days I have also received your dear letter of the  2nd of December, my kind mother, and the grind-duke's commission has  deigned to let me also read my kind brother's letter which accompanied  yours. You give me the best of news in regard to the health of all of  you, and send me preserved fruits from our dear home. I thank you for  them from the bottom of my heart. What causes me most joy in the matter  is that you have been solicitously busy about me in summer as in winter,  and that you and my dear Julia gathered them and prepared them for me at  home, and I abandon my whole soul to that sweet enjoyment.    \"I rejoice sincerely at my little cousin's coming into the world; I  joyfully congratulate the good parents and the grandparents; I transport  myself, for his baptism, into that beloved parish, where I offer him my  affection as his Christian brother, and call down on him all the  blessings of heaven.    \"We shall be obliged, I think, to give up this correspondence, so as not  to inconvenience the grand-duke's commission. I finish, therefore, by  assuring you, once more, but for the last time, perhaps, of my profound  filial submission and of my fraternal affection.--Your most tenderly  attached \"KARL-LUDWIG SAND.\"    Indeed, from that moment all correspondence between Karl and his family  ceased, and he only wrote to them, when he knew his fate, one more  letter, which we shall see later on.    We have seen by what attentions Sand was surrounded; their humanity  never flagged for an instant. It is the truth, too, that no one saw in  him an ordinary murderer, that many pitied him under their breath, and  that some excused him aloud. The very commission appointed by the  grand-duke prolonged the affair as much as possible; for the severity of  Sand's wounds had at first given rise to the belief that there would be  no need of calling in the executioner, and the commission was well  pleased that God should have undertaken the execution of the judgment.  But these expectations were deceived: the skill of the doctor defeated,  not indeed the wound, but death: Sand did not recover, but he remained  alive; and it began to be evident that it would be needful to kill him.    Indeed, the Emperor Alexander, who had appointed Kotzebue his  councillor, and who was under no misapprehension as to the cause of the  murder, urgently demanded that justice should take its course. The  commission of inquiry was therefore obliged to set to work; but as its  members were sincerely desirous of having some pretext to delay their  proceedings, they ordered that a physician from Heidelberg should visit  Sand and make an exact report upon his case; as Sand was kept lying down  and as he could not be executed in his bed, they hoped that the  physician's report, by declaring it impossible for the prisoner to rise,  would come to their assistance and necessitate a further respite.    The chosen doctor came accordingly to Mannheim, and introducing himself  to Sand as though attracted by the interest that he inspired, asked him  whether he did not feel somewhat better, and whether it would be  impossible to rise. Sand looked at him for an instant, and then said,  with a smile--    \"I understand, sir; they wish to know whether I am strong enough to  mount a scaffold: I know nothing about it myself, but we will make the  experiment together.\"    With these words he rose, and accomplishing, with superhuman courage,  what he had not attempted for fourteen months, walked twice round the  room, came back to his bed, upon which he seated himself, and said:    \"You see, sir, I am strong enough; it would therefore be wasting  precious time to keep my judges longer about my affair; so let them  deliver their judgment, for nothing now prevents its execution.\"    The doctor made his report; there was no way of retreat; Russia was  becoming more and more pressing, and an the 5th of May 1820 the high  court of justice delivered the following judgment, which was confirmed  on the 12th by His Royal Highness the Grand-Duke of Baden:    \"In the matters under investigation and after administration of the  interrogatory and hearing the defences, and considering the united  opinions of the court of justice at Mannheim and the further  consultations of the court of justice which declare the accused, Karl  Sand of Wonsiedel, guilty of murder, even on his own confession, upon  the person of the Russian imperial Councillor of State, Kotzebue; it is  ordered accordingly, for his just punishment and for an example that may  deter other people, that he is to be put from life to death by the  sword.    \"All the costs of these investigations, including these occasioned by  his public execution, will be defrayed from the funds of the law  department, on account of his want of means.\"    We see that, though it condemned the accused to death, which indeed  could hardly be avoided, the sentence was both in form and substance as  mild as possible, since, though Sand was convicted, his poor family was  not reduced by the expenses of a long and costly trial to complete ruin.    Five days were still allowed to elapse, and the verdict was not  announced until the 17th. When Sand was informed that two councillors of  justice were at the door, he guessed that they were coming to read his  sentence to him; he asked a moment to rise, which he had done but once  before, in the instance already narrated, during fourteen months. And  indeed he was so weak that he could not stand to hear the sentence, and  after having greeted the deputation that death sent to him, he asked to  sit down, saying that he did so not from cowardice of soul but from  weakness of body; then he added, \"You are welcome, gentlemen; far I have  suffered so much for fourteen months past that you come to me as angels  of deliverance.\"    He heard the sentence quite unaffectedly and with a gentle smile upon  his lips; then, when the reading was finished, he said--    \"I look for no better fate, gentlemen, and when, more than a year ago, I  paused on the little hill that overlooks the town, I saw beforehand the  place where my grave would be; and so I ought to thank God and man far  having prolonged my existence up to to-day.\"    The councillors withdrew; Sand stood up a second time to greet them on  their departure, as he had done on their entrance; then he sat down  again pensively in his chair, by which Mr. G, the governor of the  prison, was standing. After a moment of silence, a tear appeared at each  of the condemned man's eyelids, and ran down his cheeks; then, turning  suddenly to Mr. G----, whom he liked very much, he said, \"I hope that my  parents would rather see me die by this violent death than of some slow  and shameful disease. As for me, I am glad that I shall soon hear the  hour strike in which my death will satisfy those who hate me, and those  wham, according to my principles, I ought to hate.\"    Then he wrote to his family.    \"MANNHEIM    \"17th of the month of spring, 1820    \"DEAR PARENTS, BROTHERS, AND SISTERS,--You should have received my last  letters through the grand-duke's commission; in them I answered yours,  and tried to console you for my position by describing the state of my  soul as it is, the contempt to which I have attained for everything  fragile and earthly, and by which one must necessarily be overcome when  such matters are weighed against the fulfilment of an idea, or that  intellectual liberty which alone can nourish the soul; in a word, I  tried to console you by the assurance that the feelings, principles, and  convictions of which I formerly spoke are faithfully preserved in me and  have remained exactly the same; but I am sure all this was an  unnecessary precaution on my part, for there was never a time when you  asked anything else of me than to have God before my eyes and in my  heart; and you have seen how, under your guidance, this precept so  passed into my soul that it became my sole object of happiness for this  world and the next; no doubt, as He was in and near me, God will be in  and near you at the moment when this letter brings you the news of my  sentence. I die willingly, and the Lord will give me strength to die as  one ought to die.    \"I write to you perfectly quiet and calm about all things, and I hope  that your lives too will pass calmly and tranquilly until the moment  when our souls meet again full of fresh force to love one another and to  share eternal happiness together.    \"As for me, such as I have lived as long as I "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2746"],[0,"Urbain Grandier (#10)"],[1,"it there, he protested that in all he was doing he  was actuated by the purest motives and the highest integrity; that he  had no desire to harm anyone on earth; and he adjured God to strike him  dead if he had been guilty of any bad action or collusion, or had  instigated the nuns to any deceit during the investigation.    The prior of the Carmelites next advanced and made the same declaration,  taking the oath in the same manner, holding the pyx over his head; and  further calling down on himself and his brethren the curse of Korah,  Dathan, and Abiram if they had sinned during this inquiry. These  protestations did not, however, produce the salutary effect intended,  some of those present saying aloud that such oaths smacked of sacrilege.    Barre hearing the murmurs, hastened to begin the exorcisms, first  advancing to the superior to offer her the holy sacrament: but as soon  as she caught sight of him she became terribly convulsed, and attempted  to drag the pyx from his hands. Barre, however, by pronouncing the  sacred words, overcame the repulsion of the superior, and succeeded in  placing the wafer in her mouth; she, however, pushed it out again with  her tongue, as if it made her sick; Barge caught it in his fingers and  gave it to her again, at the same time forbidding the demon to make her  vomit, and this time she succeeded in partly swallowing the sacred  morsel, but complained that it stuck in her throat. At last, in order to  get it down, Barge three times gave her water to drink; and then, as  always during his exorcisms, he began by interrogating the demon.    \"Per quod pactum ingressus es in corpus hujus puellae?\" (By what pact  didst thou enter the body of this maiden?)    \"Aqua\" ( By water), said the superior.    One of those who had accompanied the bailiff was a Scotchman called  Stracan, the head of the Reformed College of Loudun. Hearing this  answer, he called on the demon to translate aqua into Gaelic, saying if  he gave this proof of having those linguistic attainments which all bad  spirits possess, he and those with him would be convinced that the  possession was genuine and no deception. Barre, without being in the  least taken aback, replied that he would make the demon say it if God  permitted, and ordered the spirit to answer in Gaelic. But though he  repeated his command twice, it was not obeyed; on the third repetition  the superior said--    \"Nimia curiositas\" (Too much curiosity), and on being asked again,  said--    \"Deus non volo.\"    This time the poor devil went astray in his conjugation, and confusing  the first with the third person, said, \"God, I do not wish,\" which in  the context had no meaning. \"God does not wish,\" being the appointed  answer.    The Scotchman laughed heartily at this nonsense, and proposed to Barre  to let his devil enter into competition with the boys of his seventh  form; but Barre, instead of frankly accepting the challenge in the  devil's name, hemmed and hawed, and opined that the devil was justified  in not satisfying idle curiosity.    \"But, sir, you must be aware,\" said the civil lieutenant, \"and if you  are not, the manual you hold in your hand will teach you, that the gift  of tongues is one of the unfailing symptoms of true possession, and the  power to tell what is happening at a distance another.\"    \"Sir,\" returned Barre, \"the devil knows the language very well, but,  does not wish to speak it; he also knows all your sins, in proof of  which, if you so desire, I shall order him to give the list.\"    \"I shall be delighted to hear it,\" said the civil lieutenant; \"be so  good as to try the experiment.\"    Barre was about to approach the superior, when he was held back by the  bailiff, who remonstrated with him on the impropriety of his conduct,  whereupon Barre assured the magistrate that he had never really intended  to do as he threatened.    However, in spite of all Barre's attempts to distract the attention of  the bystanders from the subject, they still persisted in desiring to  discover the extent of the devil's knowledge of foreign languages, and  at their suggestion the bailiff proposed to Barre to try him in Hebrew  instead of Gaelic. Hebrew being, according to Scripture, the most  ancient language of all, ought to be familiar to the demon, unless  indeed he had forgotten it. This idea met with such general applause  that Barre was forced to command the possessed nun to say aqua in  Hebrew. The poor woman, who found it difficult enough to repeat  correctly the few Latin words she had learned by rote, made an impatient  movement, and said--    \"I can't help it; I retract\" (Je renie).    These words being heard and repeated by those near her produced such an  unfavourable impression that one of the Carmelite monks tried to explain  them away by declaring that the superior had not said \"Je renie,\" but  \"Zaquay,\" a Hebrew word corresponding to the two Latin words, \"Effudi  aquam\" (I threw water about). But the words \"Je renie\" had been heard so  distinctly that the monk's assertion was greeted with jeers, and the  sub-prior reprimanded him publicly as a liar. Upon this, the superior  had a fresh attack of convulsions, and as all present knew that these  attacks usually indicated that the performance was about to end, they  withdrew, making very merry over a devil who knew neither Hebrew nor  Gaelic, and whose smattering of Latin was so incorrect.    However, as the bailiff and civil lieutenant were determined to clear up  every doubt so far as they still felt any, they went once again to the  convent at three o'clock the same afternoon. Barre came out to meet  them, and took them for a stroll in the convent grounds. During their  walk he said to the civil lieutenant that he felt very much surprised  that he, who had on a former occasion, by order of the Bishop of  Poitiers, laid information against Grandier should be now on his side.  The civil lieutenant replied that he would be ready to inform against  him again if there were any justification, but at present his object was  to arrive at the truth, and in this he felt sure he should be  successful. Such an answer was very unsatisfactory to Barre; so, drawing  the bailiff aside, he remarked to him that a man among whose ancestors  were many persons of condition, several of whom had held positions of  much dignity in the Church, and who himself held such an important  judicial position, ought to show less incredulity in regard to the  possibility of a devil entering into a human body, since if it were  proved it would redound to the glory of God and the good of the Church  and of religion. The bailiff received this remonstrance with marked  coldness, and replied that he hoped always to take justice for his  guide, as his duty commanded. Upon this, Barre pursued the subject no  farther, but led the way to the superior's apartment.    Just as they entered the room, where a large number of people were  already gathered, the superior, catching sight of the pyx which Barre  had brought with him, fell once more into convulsions. Barre went  towards her, and having asked the demon as usual by what pact he had  entered the maiden's body, and received the information that it was by  water, continued his examination as follows:    \"Quis finis pacti\" (What is the object of this pact?)    \"Impuritas\" (Unchastity).    At these words the bailiff interrupted the exorcist and ordered him to  make the demon say in Greek the three words, 'finis, pacti, impuritas'.  But the superior, who had once already got out of her difficulties by an  evasive answer, had again recourse to the same convenient phrase, \"Nimia  curiositas,\" with which Barre agreed, saying that they were indeed too  much given to curiosity. So the bailiff had to desist from his attempt  to make the demon speak Greek, as he had before been obliged to give up  trying to make him speak Hebrew and Gaelic. Barre then continued his  examination.    \"Quis attulit pactum?\" (Who brought the pact?)    \"Magus\" (The sorcerer).    \"Quale nomen magi?\" (What is the sorcerer's name?)    \"Urbanus\" (Urban).    \"Quis Urbanus? Est-ne Urbanus papa?\"    (What Urban? Pope Urban?)    \"Grandier.\"    \"Cujus qualitatis?\" (What is his profession?)    \"Curcatus.\"    The enriching of the Latin language by this new and unknown word  produced a great effect on the audience; however, Barre did not pause  long enough to allow it to be received with all the consideration it  deserved, but went on at once.    \"Quis attulit aquam pacti?\" (Who brought the water of the pact?)    \"Magus\" (The magician).    \"Qua hora?\" (At what o'clock?)    \"Septima\" (At seven o'clock).    \"An matutina?\" (In the morning?)    \"Sego\" (In the evening).    \"Quomodo intravit?\" (How did he enter?)    \"Janua\" (By the door).    \"Quis vidit?\" (Who saw him?)    \"Tres\" (Three persons).    Here Barre stopped, in order to confirm the testimony of the devil,  assuring his hearers that the Sunday after the superior's deliverance  from the second possession he along with Mignon and one of the sisters  was sitting with her at supper, it being about seven o'clock in the  evening, when she showed them drops of water on her arm, and no one  could tell where they came from. He had instantly washed her arm in holy  water and repeated some prayers, and while he was saying them the  breviary of the superior was twice dragged from her hands and thrown at  his feet, and when he stooped to pick it up for the second time he got a  box on the ear without being able to see the hand that administered it.  Then Mignon came up and confirmed what Barre had said in a long  discourse, which he wound up by calling down upon his head the most  terrible penalties if every word he said were not the exact truth. He  then dismissed the assembly, promising to drive out the evil spirit the  next day, and exhorting those present to prepare themselves, by  penitence and receiving the holy communion, for the contemplation of"]]]
