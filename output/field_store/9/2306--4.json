He brought this to the outside  gate, and assuring himself he was not being spied upon, he raised the  body of the dead man in his arms, hid it under the straw, and sat down  above it. He had the gate of the hotel opened, followed Niewski Street  as far as the Zunamenie Church, passed through the shops in the  Rejestwenskoi district, drove the sledge out on to the frozen Neva, and  halted in the middle of the river, in front of the deserted church of  Ste. Madeleine. There, protected by the solitude and darkness, hidden  behind the black mass of his sledge, he began to break the ice, which  was fifteen inches thick, with his pick. When he had made a large enough  hole, he searched the body of Foedor, took all the money he had about  him, and slipped the body head foremost through the opening he had made.  He then made his way back to the hotel, while the imprisoned current of  the Neva bore away the corpse towards the Gulf of Finland. An hour  after, a new crust of ice had formed, and not even a trace of the  opening made by Ivan remained.    At midnight Vaninka returned with her father. A hidden fever had been  consuming her all the evening: never had she looked so lovely, and she  had been overwhelmed by the homage of the most distinguished nobles and  courtiers. When she returned, she found Annouschka in the vestibule  waiting to take her cloak. As she gave it to her, Vaninka sent her one  of those questioning glances that seem to express so much. \"It is done,\"  said the girl in a low voice. Vaninka breathed a sigh of relief, as if a  mountain had been removed from her breast. Great as was her  self-control, she could no longer bear her father's presence, and  excused herself from remaining to supper with him, on the plea of the  fatigues of the evening. Vaninka was no sooner in her room, with the  door once closed, than she tore the flowers from her hair, the necklace  from her throat, cut with scissors the corsets which suffocated her, and  then, throwing herself on her bed, she gave way to her grief. Annouschka  thanked God for this outburst; her mistress's calmness had frightened  her more than her despair. The first crisis over, Vaninka was able to  pray. She spent an hour on her knees, then, yielding to the entreaties  of her faithful attendant, went to bed. Annouschka sat down at the foot  of the bed.    Neither slept, but when day came the tears which Vaninka had shed had  calmed her.    Annouschka was instructed to reward her brother. Too large a sum given  to a slave at once might have aroused suspicion, therefore Annouschka  contented herself with telling Ivan that when he had need of money he  had only to ask her for it.    Gregory, profiting by his liberty and wishing to make use of his  thousand roubles, bought a little tavern on the outskirts of the town,  where, thanks to his address and to the acquaintances he had among the  servants in the great households of St. Petersburg, he began to develop  an excellent business, so that in a short time the Red House (which was  the name and colour of Gregory's establishment) had a great reputation.  Another man took over his duties about the person of the general, and  but for Foedor's absence everything returned to its usual routine in the  house of Count Tchermayloff.    Two months went by in this way, without anybody having the least  suspicion of what had happened, when one morning before the usual  breakfast-hour the general begged his daughter to come down to his room.  Vaninka trembled with fear, for since that fatal night everything  terrified her. She obeyed her father, and collecting all her strength,  made her way to his chamber, The count was alone, but at the first  glance Vaninka saw she had nothing to fear from this interview: the  general was waiting for her with that paternal smile which was the usual  expression of his countenance when in his daughter's presence.    She approached, therefore, with her usual calmness, and, stooping down  towards the general, gave him her forehead to kiss.    He motioned to her to sit down, and gave her an open letter. Vaninka  looked at him for a moment in surprise, then turned her eyes to the  letter.    It contained the news of the death of the man to whom her hand had been  promised: he had been killed in a duel.    The general watched the effect of the letter on his daughter's face, and  great as was Vaninka's self-control, so many different thoughts, such  bitter regret, such poignant remorse assailed her when she learnt that  she was now free again, that she could not entirely conceal her emotion.  The general noticed it, and attributed it to the love which he had for a  long time suspected his daughter felt for the young aide-de-camp.    \"Well,\" he said, smiling, \"I see it is all for the best.\"    \"How is that, father?\" asked Vaninka.    \"Doubtless,\" said the general. \"Did not Foedor leave because he loved  you?\"    \"Yes,\" murmured the young girl.    \"Well, now he may return,\" said the general.    Vaninka remained silent, her eyes fixed, her lips trembling.    \"Return!\" she said, after a moment's silence.    \"Yes, certainly return. We shall be most unfortunate,\" continued the  general, smiling, \"if we cannot find someone in the house who knows  where he is. Come, Vaninka, tell me the place of his exile, and I will  undertake the rest.\"    \"Nobody knows where Foedor is,\" murmured Vaninka in a hollow voice;  \"nobody but God, nobody!\"    \"What!\" said the general, \"he has sent you no news since the day he  left?\"    Vaninka shook her head in denial. She was so heart-broken that she could  not speak.    The general in his turn became gloomy. \"Do you fear some misfortune,  then?\" said he.    \"I fear that I shall never be happy again on earth,\" cried Vaninka,  giving way under the pressure of her grief; then she continued at once,  \"Let me retire, father; I am ashamed of what I have said.\"    The general, who saw nothing in this exclamation beyond regret for  having allowed the confession of her love to escape her, kissed his  daughter on the brow and allowed her to retire. He hoped that, in spite  of the mournful way in which Vaninka had spoken of Foedor, that it would  be possible to find him. The same day he went to the emperor and told  him of the love of Foedor for his daughter, and requested, since death  had freed her from her first engagement, that he might dispose of her  hand. The emperor consented, and the general then solicited a further  favour. Paul was in one of his kindly moods, and showed himself disposed  to grant it. The general told him that Foedor had disappeared for two  months; that everyone, even his daughter, was ignorant of his  whereabouts, and begged him to have inquiries made. The emperor  immediately sent for the chief of police, and gave him the necessary  orders.    Six weeks went by without any result. Vaninka, since the day when the  letter came, was sadder and more melancholy than ever. Vainly from time  to time the general tried to make her more hopeful. Vaninka only shook  her head and withdrew. The general ceased to speak, of Foedor.    But it was not the same among the household. The young aide-de-camp had  been popular with the servants, and, with the exception of Gregory,  there was not a soul who wished him harm, so that, when it became known  that he had not been sent on a mission, but had disappeared, the matter  became the constant subject of conversation in the antechamber, the  kitchen, and the stables. There was another place where people busied  themselves about it a great deal--this was the Red House.    From the day when he heard of Foedor's mysterious departure Gregory had  his suspicions. He was sure that he had seen Foedor enter Vaninka's  room, and unless he had gone out while he was going to seek the general,  he did not understand why the latter had not found him in his daughter's  room. Another thing occupied his mind, which it seemed to him might  perhaps have some connection with this event--the amount of money Ivan  had been spending since that time, a very extraordinary amount for a  slave. This slave, however, was the brother of Vaninka's cherished  foster-sister, so that, without being sure, Gregory already suspected  the source from whence this money came. Another thing confirmed him in  his suspicions, which was that Ivan, who had not only remained his most  faithful friend, but had become one of his best customers, never spoke  of Foedor, held his tongue if he were mentioned in his presence, and to  all questions, however pressing they were, made but one answer: \"Let us  speak of something else.\"    In the meantime the Feast of Kings arrived. This is a great day in St.  Petersburg, for it is also the day for blessing the waters.    As Vaninka had been present at the ceremony, and was fatigued after  standing for two hours on the Neva, the general did not go out that  evening, and gave Ivan leave to do so. Ivan profited by the permission  to go to the Red House.    There was a numerous company there, and Ivan was welcomed; for it was  known that he generally came with full pockets. This time he did not  belie his reputation, and had scarcely arrived before he made the  sorok-kopecks ring, to the great envy of his companions.    At this warning sound Gregory hastened up with all possible deference, a  bottle of brandy in each hand; for he knew that when Ivan summoned him  he gained in two ways, as innkeeper and as boon companion. Ivan did not  disappoint these hopes, and Gregory was invited to share in the  entertainment. The conversation turned on slavery, and some of the  unhappy men, who had only four days in the year of respite from their  eternal labour, talked loudly of the happiness Gregory had enjoyed since  he had obtained his freedom.    \"Bah!\" said Ivan, on whom the brandy had begun to take effect, \"there  are some slaves who are freer than their masters.\"    \"What do you mean?\" said Gregory, pouring him"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2758"],[0,"Marquise De Ganges (#10)"],[1,"might be:  this was the period in which persons of the Reformed Church were being  persecuted, and the zeal of the marquis appeared to M. de Baville to  compensate and more than compensate for the peccadillo of which he had  been accused; consequently, instead of prosecuting him, he entered into  secret communication with him, reassuring him about his stay in France,  and urging on his religious zeal; and in this manner twelve years passed  by.    During this time the marquise's young son, whom we saw at his mother's  deathbed, had reached the age of twenty, and being rich in his father's  possessions--which his uncle had restored to him--and also by his  mother's inheritance, which he had shared with his sister, had married a  girl of good family, named Mademoiselle de Moissac, who was both rich  and beautiful. Being called to serve in the royal army, the count  brought his young wife to the castle of Ganges, and, having fervently  commended her to his father, left her in his charge.    The Marquis de Ganges was forty-two veers old, and scarcely seemed  thirty; he was one of the handsomest men living; he fell in love with  his daughter-in-law and hoped to win her love, and in order to promote  this design, his first care was to separate from her, under the excuse  of religion, a maid who had been with her from childhood and to whom she  was greatly attached.    This measure, the cause of which the young marquise did not know,  distressed her extremely. It was much against her will that she had come  to live at all in this old castle of Ganges, which had so recently been  the scene of the terrible story that we have just told. She inhabited  the suite of rooms in which the murder had been committed; her  bedchamber was the same which had belonged to the late marquise; her bed  was the same; the window by which she had fled was before her eyes; and  everything, down to the smallest article of furniture, recalled to her  the details of that savage tragedy. But even worse was her case when she  found it no longer possible to doubt her father-in-law's intentions;  when she saw herself beloved by one whose very name had again and again  made her childhood turn pale with terror, and when she was left alone at  all hours of the day in the sole company of the man whom public rumour  still pursued as a murderer. Perhaps in any other place the poor lonely  girl might have found some strength in trusting herself to God; but  there, where God had suffered one of the fairest and purest creatures  that ever existed to perish by so cruel a death, she dared not appeal to  Him, for He seemed to have turned away from this family.    She waited, therefore, in growing terror; spending her days, as much as  she could, with the women of rank who lived in the little town of  Ganges, and some of whom, eye-witnesses of her mother-in-law's murder,  increased her terrors by the accounts which they gave of it, and which  she, with the despairing obstinacy of fear, asked to hear again and  again. As to her nights, she spent the greater part of them on her  knees, and fully dressed, trembling at the smallest sound; only  breathing freely as daylight came back, and then venturing to seek her  bed for a few hours' rest.    At last the marquis's attempts became so direct and so pressing, that  the poor young woman resolved to escape at all costs from his hands. Her  first idea was to write to her father, explain to him her position and  ask help; but her father had not long been a Catholic, and had suffered  much on behalf of the Reformed religion, and on these accounts it was  clear that her letter would be opened by the marquis on pretext of  religion, and thus that step, instead of saving, might destroy her. She  had thus but one resource: her husband had always been a Catholic; her  husband was a captain of dragoons, faithful in the service of the king  and faithful in the service of God; there could be no excuse for opening  a letter to him; she resolved to address herself to him, explained the  position in which she found herself, got the address written by another  hand, and sent the letter to Montpellier, where it was posted.    The young marquis was at Metz when he received his wife's missive. At  that instant all his childish memories awoke; he beheld himself at his  dying mother's bedside, vowing never to forget her and to pray daily for  her. The image presented itself of this wife whom he adored, in the same  room, exposed to the same violence, destined perhaps to the same fate;  all this was enough to lead him to take positive action: he flung  himself into a post-chaise, reached Versailles, begged an audience of  the king, cast himself, with his wife's letter in his hand, at the feet  of Louis XIV, and besought him to compel his father to return into  exile, where he swore upon has honour that he would send him everything  he could need in order to live properly.    The king was not aware that the Marquis do Ganges had disobeyed the  sentence of banishment, and the manner in which he learned it was not  such as to make him pardon the contradiction of his laws. In consequence  he immediately ordered that if the Marquis de Ganges were found in  France he should be proceeded against with the utmost rigour.    Happily for the marquis, the Comte de Ganges, the only one of his  brothers who had remained in France, and indeed in favour, learned the  king's decision in time. He took post from Versailles, and making the  greatest haste, went to warn him of the danger that was threatening;  both together immediately left Ganges, and withdrew to Avignon. The  district of Venaissin, still belonging at that time to the pope and  being governed by a vice-legate, was considered as foreign territory.  There he found his daughter, Madame d'Urban, who did all she could to  induce him to stay with her; but to do so would have been to flout Louis  XIV's orders too publicly, and the marquis was afraid to remain so much  in evidence lest evil should befall him; he accordingly retired to the  little village of l'Isle, built in a charming spot near the fountain of  Vaucluse; there he was lost sight of; none ever heard him spoken of  again, and when I myself travelled in the south of France in 1835, I  sought in vain any trace of the obscure and forgotten death which closed  so turbulent and stormy an existence.    As, in speaking of the last adventures of the Marquis de Ganges, we have  mentioned the name of Madame d'Urban, his daughter, we cannot exempt  ourselves from following her amid the strange events of her life,  scandalous though they may be; such, indeed, was the fate of this  family, that it was to occupy the attention of France through well-nigh  a century, either by its crimes or by its freaks.    On the death of the marquise, her daughter, who was barely six years  old, had remained in the charge of the dowager Marquise de Ganges, who,  when she had attained her twelfth year, presented to her as her husband  the Marquis de Perrant, formerly a lover of the grandmother herself. The  marquis was seventy years of age, having been born in the reign of Henry  IV; he had seen the court of Louis XIII and that of Louis XIV's youth,  and he had remained one of its most elegant and favoured nobles; he had  the manners of those two periods, the politest that the world has known,  so that the young girl, not knowing as yet the meaning of marriage and  having seen no other man, yielded without repugnance, and thought  herself happy in becoming the Marquise de Perrant.    The marquis, who was very rich, had quarrelled With his younger brother,  and regarded him with such hatred that he was marrying only to deprive  his brother of the inheritance that would rightfully accrue to him,  should the elder die childless. Unfortunately, the marquis soon  perceived that the step which he had taken, however efficacious in the  case of another man, was likely to be fruitless in his own. He did not,  however, despair, and waited two or three years, hoping every day that  Heaven would work a miracle in his favour; but as every day diminished  the chances of this miracle, and his hatred for his brother grew with  the impossibility of taking revenge upon him, he adopted a strange and  altogether antique scheme, and determined, like the ancient Spartans, to  obtain by the help of another what Heaven refused to himself.    The marquis did not need to seek long for the man who should give him  his revenge: he had in his house a young page, some seventeen or  eighteen years old, the son of a friend of his, who, dying without  fortune, had on his deathbed particularly commended the lad to the  marquis. This young man, a year older than his mistress, could not be  continually about her without falling passionately in love with her; and  however much he might endeavour to hide his love, the poor youth was as  yet too little practised in dissimulation to succeed iii concealing it  from the eyes of the marquis, who, after having at first observed its  growth with uneasiness, began on the contrary to rejoice in it, from the  moment when he had decided upon the scheme that we have just mentioned.    The marquis was slow to decide but prompt to execute. Having taken his  resolution, he summoned his page, and, after having made him promise  inviolable secrecy, and having undertaken, on that condition, to prove  his gratitude by buying him a regiment, explained what was expected of  him. The poor youth, to whom nothing could have been more unexpected  than such a communication, took it at first for a trick by which the  marquis meant to make him own his love, and was ready to throw himself  at his feet and declare everything; but the marquis seeing his  confusion, and easily guessing its cause, reassured him completely by  swearing that he authorised him to take any steps in order to attain the  end that the marquis had in view. As in his inmost heart the aim of the"]]]
