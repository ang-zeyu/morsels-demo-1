Market value of publicly traded shares:  This entry gives the value of  shares issued by publicly traded companies at a price determined in the  national stock markets on the final day of the period indicated. It is  simply the latest price per share multiplied by the total number of  outstanding shares, cumulated over all companies listed on the  particular exchange.    Median age:  This entry is the age that divides a population into two  numerically equal groups; that is, half the people are younger than  this age and half are older. It is a single index that summarizes the  age distribution of a population. Currently, the median age ranges from  a low of about 15 in Uganda and Gaza Strip to 40 or more in several  European countries and Japan. See the entry for \"Age structure\" for the  importance of a young versus an older age structure and, by  implication, a low versus a higher median age.    Merchant marine:  Merchant marine may be defined as all ships engaged  in the carriage of goods; or all commercial vessels (as opposed to all  nonmilitary ships), which excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil  rigs, etc. This entry contains information in four fields - total,  ships by type, foreign-owned, and registered in other countries.    Total includes the number of ships (1,000 GRT or over), total DWT for  those ships, and total GRT for those ships. DWT or dead weight tonnage  is the total weight of cargo, plus bunkers, stores, etc., that a ship  can carry when immersed to the appropriate load line. GRT or gross  register tonnage is a figure obtained by measuring the entire sheltered  volume of a ship available for cargo and passengers and converting it  to tons on the basis of 100 cubic feet per ton; there is no stable  relationship between GRT and DWT.    Ships by type includes a listing of barge carriers, bulk cargo ships,  cargo ships, chemical tankers, combination bulk carriers, combination  ore/oil carriers, container ships, liquefied gas tankers, livestock  carriers, multifunctional large-load carriers, petroleum tankers,  passenger ships, passenger/cargo ships, railcar carriers, refrigerated  cargo ships, roll-on/roll-off cargo ships, short-sea passenger ships,  specialized tankers, and vehicle carriers.    Foreign-owned are ships that fly the flag of one country but belong to  owners in another.    Registered in other countries are ships that belong to owners in one  country but fly the flag of another.    Military:  This category includes the entries dealing with a country's  military structure, manpower, and expenditures.    Military - note:  This entry includes miscellaneous military  information of significance not included elsewhere.    Military branches:  This entry lists the service branches subordinate  to defense ministries or the equivalent (typically ground, naval, air,  and marine forces).    Military expenditures:  This entry gives spending on defense programs  for the most recent year available as a percent of gross domestic  product (GDP); the GDP is calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e.,  not in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP).    Military service age and obligation:  This entry gives the required  ages for voluntary or conscript military service and the length of  service obligation.    Money figures:  All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US  dollars unless otherwise indicated.    National holiday:  This entry gives the primary national day of  celebration - usually independence day.    Nationality:  This entry provides the identifying terms for citizens -  noun and adjective.    Natural gas - consumption:  This entry is the total natural gas  consumed in cubic meters (cu m). The discrepancy between the amount of  natural gas produced and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or  exported is due to the omission of stock changes and other complicating  factors.    Natural gas - exports:  This entry is the total natural gas exported in  cubic meters (cu m).    Natural gas - imports:  This entry is the total natural gas imported in  cubic meters (cu m).    Natural gas - production:  This entry is the total natural gas produced  in cubic meters (cu m). The discrepancy between the amount of natural  gas produced and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is  due to the omission of stock changes and other complicating factors.    Natural gas - proved reserves:  This entry is the stock of proved  reserves of natural gas in cubic meters (cu m). Proved reserves are  those quantities of natural gas, which, by analysis of geological and  engineering data, can be estimated with a high degree of confidence to  be commercially recoverable from a given date forward, from known  reservoirs and under current economic conditions.    Natural hazards:  This entry lists potential natural disasters.    Natural resources:  This entry lists a country's mineral, petroleum,  hydropower, and other resources of commercial importance.    Net migration rate:  This entry includes the figure for the difference  between the number of persons entering and leaving a country during the  year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear population). An excess of  persons entering the country is referred to as net immigration (e.g.,  3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the  country as net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000 population). The  net migration rate indicates the contribution of migration to the  overall level of population change. High levels of migration can cause  problems such as increasing unemployment and potential ethnic strife  (if people are coming in) or a reduction in the labor force, perhaps in  certain key sectors (if people are leaving).    Oil - consumption:  This entry is the total oil consumed in barrels per  day (bbl/day). The discrepancy between the amount of oil produced  and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is due to the  omission of stock changes, refinery gains, and other complicating  factors.    Oil - exports:  This entry is the total oil exported in barrels per day  (bbl/day), including both crude oil and oil products.    Oil - imports:  This entry is the total oil imported in barrels per day  (bbl/day), including both crude oil and oil products.    Oil - production:  This entry is the total oil produced in barrels per  day (bbl/day). The discrepancy between the amount of oil produced  and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is due to the  omission of stock changes, refinery gains, and other complicating  factors.    Oil - proved reserves:  This entry is the stock of proved reserves of  crude oil in barrels (bbl). Proved reserves are those quantities of  petroleum which, by analysis of geological and engineering data, can be  estimated with a high degree of confidence to be commercially  recoverable from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under  current economic conditions.    People:  This category includes the entries dealing with the  characteristics of the people and their society.    People - note:  This entry includes miscellaneous demographic  information of significance not included elsewhere.    Personal Names - Capitalization:  The Factbook capitalizes the surname  or family name of individuals for the convenience of our users who are  faced with a world of different cultures and naming conventions. The  need for capitalization, bold type, underlining, italics, or some other  indicator of the individual's surname is apparent in the following  examples: MAO Zedong, Fidel CASTRO Ruz, George W. BUSH, and TUNKU  SALAHUDDIN Abdul Aziz Shah ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Hisammuddin Alam Shah.  By knowing the surname, a short form without all capital letters can be  used with confidence as in President Castro, Chairman Mao, President  Bush, or Sultan Tunku Salahuddin. The same system of capitalization is  extended to the names of leaders with surnames that are not commonly  used such as Queen ELIZABETH II. For Vietnamese names, the given name  is capitalized because officials are referred to by their given name  rather than by their surname. For example, the president of Vietnam is  Tran Duc LUONG. His surname is Tran, but he is referred to by his given  name - President LUONG.    Personal Names - Spelling:  The romanization of personal names in the  Factbook normally follows the same transliteration system used by the  US Board on Geographic Names for spelling place names. At times,  however, a foreign leader expressly indicates a preference for, or the  media or official documents regularly use, a romanized spelling that  differs from the transliteration derived"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29246"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 3, No. 2, May, 1851 (#10)"],[1,"of grain and to       grazing. Having its Atlantic seaport at Halifax, and its       Pacific Depot near Vancouver's Island, it would inevitably draw       to it the commerce of Europe, Asia, and the United States. Thus       British America, from a mere colonial dependency, would assume       a controlling rank in the world. To her other nations would be       tributary, and in vain would the United States attempt to be       her rival; for we could never dispute with her the possession       of the Asiatic commerce, or the power which that confers.\"         But the matter reaches beyond the suggestions of national       interest, and has a wider scope than the mere sentiment of       patriotism. We have hoped that this republic might make the       easy effort necessary to grasp a prize so magnificent, but we       shall hail with satisfaction the actual commencement of such a       work, wherever and by whomsoever it is undertaken.          A JEW AND A CHRISTIAN.      A few days ago, a man of various genius and acquirement, with whose  writings people of many countries have been delighted, entered an  office, holding in his hand two black-bordered notes, inviting him to  funerals.    So--other friends have gone! who now?    Two persons very unlike each other. Truly I have never known more  striking contrasts. I was meditating of popular prejudices by which  their lives were more or less affected, by which their reputations were  certainly much affected: one was a Jew, and the other a Christian.    Proceed with your morality.    I was very poor when I came to this country. I sought occupation in the  pursuits for which I was best fitted by my education: for a time with  little success; and at length I was offered for the translation of two  wretched French novels, the meager sum of fifty dollars. I sold some of  my wife's trinkets to purchase paper and ink, and worked diligently, you  can guess how many weeks, until they were in English as readable as the  French of their author. The task accomplished, I went to my patron,  expecting of course to have the pittance counted down in current notes  or gold; but----the market for such literature was by this time over  stocked; he had supplied it too liberally; and with some insulting  excuse he refused the manuscripts.    You have an invitation to his funeral?    Yes--he was rich--always speculating in the sweat of brains--and we had  business relations afterward.    The other history?    I chanced one day to meet a gentleman, with whom I had no personal  acquaintance, though our names were known to each other, and conversing  of a subject with which I was familiar he inquired if I would write  something upon it for his journal. I replied that I would be very happy  to do so, and as we shook hands, at parting, he left in my palm two  twenty-dollar notes. He would gladly have avoided a word of explanation,  but seeing my surprise he said, \"It is merely a retainer, as the lawyers  have it; consider it upon account of the articles you will write me.\" I  wrote the articles; it was but an evening's work; and wrote frequently  afterward for the same person, always receiving a liberal reward--always  more than I asked--though my employer was himself by no means rich. You  will think that in the first place he expected a profit for the money he  gave me, but I knew better: he cared not a fig for the papers I was to  prepare; he simply suspected that I was in need of money, and took that  delicate way to relieve me, as, in his time, he relieved hundreds of  men.    A noble characteristic of a man perhaps in all respects deserving of  admiration: But what of the prejudice you were meditating?    It is this--that even in this land, where many an old world superstition  has found life impossible--the community regard a _Jew_ as an  incarnation of all selfishness, meanness and dishonor. A hundred to one,  being told that the hero of one of these two histories was an Israelite,  would swear instantly that the name of him who swindled me was Moses.  But it was not: that person will to-morrow have Christian burial, and  the other--one of the most sincere and generous men of the age, was an  officer of the synagogue. You know--we both know--that the Hebrew race  are not only before the other races in all fine intelligence, but that  in defiance of prejudices and disabilities which might turn any other  people into hordes of robbers, they are of the most honorable portion of  mankind.          POLICARPA LA SALVARIETTA,    THE HEROINE OF COLOMBIA.      There are not many subjects for poetry or romance in American history  more suggestive than that furnished in the following incidents,  translated from Restrepo's _Historia de la Revolucion de la Colombia_:         \"After the standard of liberty had been raised in all the       provinces, and the people had struck a successful blow for       freedom, Morillo, with an overwhelming force, re-conquered the       country for Spain. During six months this fiendish savage held       undisputed sway over Colombia. The best men of the provinces       were by him seized and shot, and each of his officers had the       power of death over the inhabitants of the districts in which       they were stationed. It was during this period that the       barbarous execution of Policarpa La Salvarietta--a heroic girl       of New Granada--roused the Patriots once more to arms, and       produced in them a determination to expel their oppressors or       die. This young lady was enthusiastically attached to the cause       of liberty, and had, by her influence, rendered essential aid       to the Patriots. The wealth of her father, and her own superior       talents and education, early excited the hostility of the       Spanish commander against her and her family. She had promised       her hand in marriage to a young officer in the Patriot service,       who had been compelled by Morillo to join the Spanish army as a       private soldier. La Salvarietta, by means that were never       disclosed, obtained, through him an exact account of the       Spanish forces, and a plan of their fortifications. The       Patriots were preparing to strike a decisive blow, and this       intelligence was important to their success. She had induced       Sabarain, her lover, and eight others, to desert. They were       discovered, and apprehended. The letters of La Salvarietta,       found on the person of her lover, betrayed her to the vengeance       of the tyrant of her country. She was seized, brought to the       Spanish camp, and tried by court martial. The highest rewards       were promised her if she would disclose the names and plans of       her associates. The inducements proving of no avail, torture       was employed to wring from her the secret, in which so many of       the best families of Colombia were interested, but even on the       rack she persisted in making no disclosure. The accomplished       young lady, hardly eighteen years of age, was condemned to be       shot. She calmly and serenely heard her sentence, and prepared       to meet her fate. She confessed to a Catholic priest, partook       of the sacrament, and with a firm step walked to the open       square, where a file of soldiers, in presence of Morillo and       his officers, were drawn up, with loaded muskets. Turning to       Morillo, she said, \"I shall not die in vain, for my blood will       raise up heroes from every hill and valley of my country.\" She       had scarcely uttered the above, when Morillo himself gave the       signal to the soldiers to fire, and in the next moment La       Salvarietta was a mangled and bleeding corpse. The Spanish       officers and soldiers were overwhelmed with astonishment at the       firmness and patriotism of this lovely girl, but the effect       upon her own countrymen was electrical. The Patriots lost no       time in flying to arms, and their war cry, \"_La Salvarietta_!\"       made every heart burn to inflict vengeance upon her murderers.       In a very short time the army of Morillo was nearly cut to       pieces, and the commander himself escaped death only by flight,       and in disguise.\"    In Mexico a dramatic piece, which we have seen described as possessing  considerable merit, has been founded upon this tragical history. In the  Spanish American wars there have been numerous instances of remarkable  heroism by women, which is the more noticeable for the little the sex  has had to gain by the political independence of the Spanish race on  this continent.          A REAL AMERICAN SAINT.      Mrs. Jameson, in her beautiful book lately published in London, _Legends  of the Monastic Orders_, has the following account of the only American  woman ever canonized:         \"Santa Rosa di Lima was born at Lima, in Peru, in 1586. This       flower of sanctity, whose fragrance has filled the whole       Christian world, is the patroness of America, the St. Theresa       of Transatlantic Spain. She was distinguished, in the first       place, by her austerities. 'Her usual food was an herb bitter       as wormwood. When compelled by her mother to wear a wreath of       roses, she so adjusted it on her brow that it became a crown of       thorns. Rejecting a host of suitors, she destroyed the lovely       complexion to which she owed her name, by an application of       pepper and quicklime. But she was also a noble example of       filial devotion, and maintained her once wealthy parents,       fallen on evil days, by the labor of her hands.' All day she       toiled in a garden, and at night she worked with her needle.       She took the habit of the third order of St. Dominic, and died       in 1617. She was canonized by Clement X. According to the       Peruvian legend, the Pope, when entreated to canonize her,       absolutely refused, exclaiming, 'India y santa! asi como       llueven rosas!'
