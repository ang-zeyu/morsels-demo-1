I am halfway through the opening when I hear the sound again. A soft  slithering; a faint defeated thump.    I freeze where I am, and then I hear the sigh; a long, long weary  sound, almost musical.    An air leak somewhere in the hull and wind or waves altering the air  pressure below.    All the same I do not seem able to come any farther through this door.    Light might help; I turn the beam up and play it cautiously around.  This is the last compartment, right in the nose; a sawn-off  cone-shape. No breaks here, though the hull is buckled to my left and  the \"floor\"--the partition, horizontal when the ship is in the normal  operating position, which holds my trap door--is torn up; some large  heavy object was welded to a thin surface skin which has ripped away  leaving jagged edges and a pattern of girders below.    There is no dust here; it has all been sucked out when the ship was  open to space; nothing to show the beam except the sliding yellow  ellipse where it touches the wall. It glides and turns, spiraling  down, deformed every so often where it crosses a projection or a dent,  till it halts suddenly on a spoked disk, four feet across and standing  nearly eighteen inches out from the wall. The antigrav.    I never saw one this size, it is like the little personal affairs as a  giant is like a pigmy, not only bigger but a bit different in  proportion. I can see an Andite cartridge fastened among the spokes.    The fuse is a \"sympathizer\" but it is probably somewhere close. The  ellipse moves again. There is no feeling that I control it; it is  hunting on its own. To and fro around the giant wheel. Lower. It halts  on a small flat box, also bolted to the wall, a little way below. This  is it, I can see the dial.    The ellipse stands still, surrounding the fuse. There is something at  the very edge of it.    When _Gilgamesh_ was right way up the antigrav was bolted to one wall,  about three feet above the floor. Now the lowest point is the place  where this wall joins what used to be the floor. Something has fallen  down to that point and is huddled there in the dark.    The beam jerks suddenly up and the breath whoops out of me; a round  thing sticking out of the wall--then I realize it is an archaic  space-helmet, clamped to the wall for safety when the wearer took it  off.    I take charge of the ellipse of light and move it slowly down, past  the fuse, to the thing below. A little dark scalloping of the edge of  the light. The tips of fingers. A hand.    I turn up the light.    When the missile struck the big computer was wrenched loose from the  floor. It careened down as the floor tilted, taking with it anything  that stood in its way.    M'Clare was just stooping to the fuse, I think. The computer smashed  against his legs and pinned him down in the angle between the wall and  the floor. His legs are hidden by it.    Because of the spacesuit he does not looked crushed; the thick clumsy  joints have kept their roundness, so far as they are visible; only his  hands and head are bare and vulnerable looking.    I am halfway down, floating on minimum gravity, before it really  occurs to me that he may be still alive.    I switch to half and drop beside him. His face is colorless but he is  breathing all right.    First-aid kit. I will never make fun of Space Force thoroughness  again. Rows and rows of small plastic ampoules. Needles.    Pain-killer, first. I read the directions twice, sweating. Emergencies  only--this is. One dose _only_ to be given and if patient is not in  good health use--never mind that. I fit on the longest needle and jab  it through the suit, at the back of the thigh, as far towards the  knee-joint as I can get because the suit is thinner. Half one side,  half the other.    Now to get the computer off. At a guess it weighs about five hundred  pounds. The beam-lever would do it but it would probably fall back.    Antigrav; the personal size is supposed to take up to three times the  weight of the average man. I take mine off and buckle the straps  through a convenient gap. I have my hands under the thing when M'Clare  sighs again.    He is lying on his belly but his head is turned to one side, towards  me. Slowly his eyelids open. He catches the sight of my hand; his head  moves a little, and he says, \"Lizzie. Golden Liz.\"    I say not to worry, we will soon be out of here.    His body jumps convulsively and he cries out. His hand reaches my  sleeve and feels. He says, \"Liz! Oh, God, I thought ... what--\"    I say things are under control and just keep quiet a bit.    His eyes close. After a moment he whispers, \"Something hit the ship.\"    \"A homing missile, I think.\"    I ought not to have said that; but it seems to make no particular  impression, maybe he guessed as much.           *       *       *       *       *    I was wrong in wanting to shift the computer straight away, the  release of pressure might start a hemorrhage; I dig out ampoules of  blood-seal and inject them into the space between the suit and the  flesh, as close to the damage as I can.    M'Clare asks how the ship is lying and I explain, also how I got here.  I dig out the six-by-two-inch packet of expanding stretcher and read  the directions. He is quiet for a minute or two, gathering strength;  then he says sharply: \"Lizzie. Stop that and listen.    \"The fuse for the Andite is just under the antigrav. Go and find it.  Go now. There's a dial with twenty divisions. Marked in black--you see  it. Turn the pointer to the last division. Is that done?    \"Now you see the switch under the pointer? Is your boat ready? I beg  your pardon, of course you left it that way. Then turn the switch and  get out.\"    I come back and see by my chrono that the blood-seal should be set; I  get my hands under the computer. M'Clare bangs his hand on the floor.    \"Lizzie, you little idiot, don't you realize that even if you get me  out of this ship, which is next to impossible, you'll be delayed all  the way--and if the Incognitans find either of us the whole plan's  ruined? Much worse than ruined, once they see it's a hoax--\"    I tell him I have two Andite sticks and they won't find us and on a  night like this any story of explosions will be put down to sudden  gusts or to lightning.    He is silent for a moment while I start lifting the computer,  carefully; its effective weight with the antigrav full on is only  about twenty pounds but is has all its inertia. Then he says quietly,  \"Please, Lizzie--can't you understand that the worst nightmare in the  whole affair has been the fear that one of you might get injured? Or  even killed? When I realized that only one person was needed to pilot  _Gilgamesh_--it was the greatest relief I ever experienced. Now you  say....\" His voice picks up suddenly. \"Lizzie, you're beaten anyway.  The ... I'm losing all feeling. Even pain. I can't feel anything  behind my shoulders ... it's creeping up--\"    I say that means the pain-killer I shot him with is acting as  advertised, and he makes a sound as much like an explosive chuckle as  anything and it's quiet again.    The curvature between floor and wall is not helpful, I am trying to  find a place to wedge the computer so it cannot fall back when I take  off the antigrav. Presently I get it pushed on to a sort of ledge  formed by a dent in the floor, which I think will hold it. I ease off  the antigrav and the computer stays put, I don't like the looks of it  so let's get out of here.    I push the packaged stretcher under his middle and pull the tape  before I turn the light on to his legs to see the damage. I cannot  make out very much; the joints of the suit are smashed some, but as  far as I can see the inner lining is not broken which means it is  still air-and-water-tight.    I put a hand under his chest to feel how the stretcher is going; it is  now expanded to eighteen inches by six and I can feel it pushing out,  but it is _slow_, what else have I to do--oh yes, get the helmet.    I am standing up to reach for it when M'Clare says, \"What are you  doing? Yes ... well, don't put it on for a minute. There's something I  would like to tell you, and with all respect for your obstinacy I  doubt very much whether I shall have another chance. Keep that light  off me, will you? It hurts my eyes.    \"You know, Lizzie, I dislike risking the lives of any of the students  for whom I am responsible, but as it happens I find the idea of  you--blowing yourself to atoms particularly objectionable because ... I  happen to be in love with you. You're also one of my best students, I  used to think that ... was why I'd been so insistent on your coming to  Russett, but I rather think ... my motives were mixed even then. I meant  to tell you this after you graduated, and to ask you to marry me, not  that ... I thought you would, I know quite well ... you never quite  forgave me, but I don't-want-to-have to remember ... I didn't ... have  the guts to--\"    His voice trails off, I get a belated rush of sense to the head and  turn the light on his face. His head is turned sideways and his fist  is clenched against the side of his neck. When I touch it his hand  falls open and five discharged ampoules fall out.    Pain-killer.    Maximum dose, one ampoule.    All that talk was just to hold my attention while he fixed the needles  and--    I left the kit spread out right next to him.    While I am taking this in some small cold corner of my mind is  remembering the instructions that are on the pain-killer ampoule; it  does not say, outright, that it is the last refuge for men in the  extremity of pain and despair; therefore it cannot say, outright, that  they sometimes despair too soon; but it does tell you the name of the  antidote."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3043"],[0,"The Quaker Colonies: A Chronicle of the Proprietors of the Delaware (#10)"],[1,", most of them sturdy, thrifty  Quakers. They could meet very easily anywhere--at the Governor's house,  if in conference with him, or at the treasurer's office or at the loan  office, if investigating accounts. Beneath their broad brim hats and  grave demeanor they were as Anglo-Saxon at heart as Robin Hood and his  merry men, and in their ninety years of political control they built up  as goodly a fabric of civil liberty as can be found in any community in  the world.    The dignified, confident message from a deputy governor, full of  lofty admonitions of their duty to the Crown, the province, and the  proprietor, is often met by a sarcastic, stinging reply of the Assembly.  David Lloyd, the Welsh leader of the anti-proprietary party, and  Joseph Wilcox, another leader, became very skillful in drafting these  profoundly respectful but deeply cutting replies. In after years,  Benjamin Franklin attained even greater skill. In fact, it is not  unlikely that he developed a large measure of his world famous aptness  in the use of language in the process of drafting these replies. The  composing of these official communications was important work, for a  reply had to be telling and effective not only with the Governor but  with the people who learned of its contents at the coffeehouse and  spread the report of it among all classes. There was not a little  good-fellowship in their contests; and Franklin, for instance, tells us  how he used to abuse a certain deputy governor all day in the Assembly  and then dine with him in jovial intercourse in the evening.    The Assembly had a very convenient way of accomplishing its purposes in  legislation in spite of the opposition of the British Government.  Laws when passed and approved by the deputy governor had to be sent to  England for approval by the Crown within five years. But meanwhile the  people would live under the law for five years, and, if at the end of  that time it was disallowed, the Assembly would reenact the measure and  live under it again for another period.      The ten years after Penn's return to England in 1701 were full of  trouble for him. Money returns from the province were slow, partly  because England was involved in war and trade depressed, and partly  because the Assembly, exasperated by the deputy governors he appointed,  often refused to vote the deputy a salary and left Penn to bear all the  expense of government. He was being rapidly overwhelmed with debt. One  of his sons was turning out badly. The manager of his estates in England  and Ireland, Philip Ford, was enriching himself by the trust, charging  compound interest at eight per cent every six months, and finally  claiming that Penn owed him 14,000 pounds. Ford had rendered accounts  from time to time, but Penn in his careless way had tossed them aside  without examination. When Ford pressed for payment, Penn, still without  making any investigation, foolishly gave Ford a deed in fee simple of  Pennsylvania as security. Afterwards he accepted from Ford a lease of  the province, which was another piece of folly, for the lease could,  of course, be used as evidence to show that the deed was an absolute  conveyance and not intended as a mortgage.    This unfortunate business Ford kept quiet during his lifetime. But on  his death his widow and son made everything public, professed to be  the proprietors of Pennsylvania, and sued Penn for 2000 pounds rent in  arrears. They obtained a judgment for the amount claimed and, as Penn  could not pay, they had him arrested and imprisoned for debt. For nine  months he was locked up in the debtors' prison, the \"Old Bailey,\" and  there he might have remained indefinitely if some of his friends had  not raised enough money to compromise with the Fords. Isaac Norris,  a prominent Quaker from Pennsylvania, happened at that time to be in  England and exerted himself to set Penn free and save the province from  further disgrace. After this there was a reaction in Penn's favor. He  selected a better deputy governor for Pennsylvania. He wrote a long and  touching letter to the people, reminding them how they had flourished  and grown rich and free under his liberal laws, while he had been  sinking in poverty.    After that conditions improved in the affairs of Penn. The colony was  better governed, and the anti-proprietary party almost disappeared. The  last six or eight years of Penn's life were free from trouble. He  had ceased his active work at court, for everything that could be  accomplished for the Quakers in the way of protection and favorable  laws had now been done. Penn spent his last years in trying to sell the  government of his province to the Crown for a sum that would enable him  to pay his debts and to restore his family to prosperity. But he was  too particular in stipulating that the great principles of civil and  religious liberty on which the colony had been established should not be  infringed. He had seen how much evil had resulted to the rights of the  people when the proprietors of the Jerseys parted with their right to  govern. In consequence he required so many safeguards that the sale of  Pennsylvania was delayed and delayed until its founder was stricken with  paralysis. Penn lingered for some years, but his intellect was now too  much clouded to make a valid sale. The event, however, was fortunate  for Pennsylvania, which would probably otherwise have lost many valuable  rights and privileges by becoming a Crown colony.    On July 30,1718, Penn died at the age of seventy-four. His widow became  proprietor of the province, probably the only woman who ever became  feudal proprietor of such an immense domain. She appointed excellent  deputy governors and ruled with success for eight years until her death  in 1726. In her time the ocean was free from enemy cruisers, and the  trade of the colony grew so rapidly that the increasing sales of land  and quitrents soon enabled her to pay off the mortgage on the province  and all the rest of her husband's debts. It was sad that Penn did not  live to see that day, which he had so hoped for in his last years, when,  with ocean commerce free from depredations, the increasing money returns  from his province would obviate all necessity of selling the government  to the Crown.    With all debts paid and prosperity increasing, Penn's sons became very  rich men. Death had reduced the children to three--John, Thomas,  and Richard. Of these, Thomas became what may be called the managing  proprietor, and the others were seldom heard of. Thomas lived in the  colony nine years--1732 to 1741--studying its affairs and sitting as a  member of the Council. For over forty years he was looked upon as the  proprietor. In fact, he directed the great province for almost as long  a time as his father had managed it. But he was so totally unlike his  father that it is difficult to find the slightest resemblance in feature  or in mind. He was not in the least disposed to proclaim or argue about  religion. Like the rest of his family, he left the Quakers and joined  the Church of England, a natural evolution in the case of many Quakers.  He was a prosperous, accomplished, sensible, cool-headed gentleman, by  no means without ability, but without any inclination for setting the  world on fire. He was a careful, economical man of business, which is  more than can be said of his distinguished father. He saw no visions and  cared nothing for grand speculations.    Thomas Penn, however, had his troubles and disputes with the Assembly.  They thought him narrow and close. Perhaps he was. That was the opinion  of him held by Franklin, who led the anti-proprietary party. But at the  same time some consideration must be given to the position in which  Penn found himself. He had on his hands an empire, rich, fertile, and  inhabited by liberty-loving Anglo-Saxons and by passive Germans. He  had to collect from their land the purchase money and quitrents rapidly  rolling up in value with the increase of population into millions of  pounds sterling, for which he was responsible to his relatives. At the  same time he had to influence the politics of the province, approve or  reject laws in such a way that his family interest would be protected  from attack or attempted confiscation, keep the British Crown satisfied,  and see that the liberties of the colonists were not impaired and that  the people were kept contented.    It was not an easy task even for a clear-headed man like Thomas Penn.  He had to arrange for treaties with the Indians and for the purchase of  their lands in accordance with the humane ideas of his father and in the  face of the Scotch-Irish thirst for Indian blood and the French desire  to turn the savages loose upon the Anglo-Saxon settlements. He had to  fight through the boundary disputes with Connecticut, Maryland, and  Virginia, which threatened to reduce his empire to a mere strip of land  containing neither Philadelphia nor Pittsburgh. The controversy with  Connecticut lasted throughout the colonial period and was not definitely  settled till the close of the Revolution. The charter of Connecticut  granted by the British Crown extended the colony westward to the Pacific  Ocean and cut off the northern half of the tract afterwards granted to  William Penn. In pursuance of what they believed to be their rights, the  Connecticut people settled in the beautiful valley of Wyoming. They were  thereupon ejected by force by the proprietors of Pennsylvania; but they  returned, only to be ejected again and again in a petty warfare carried  on for many years. In the summer of 1778, the people of the valley  were massacred by the Iroquois Indians. The history of this Connecticut  boundary dispute fills volumes. So does the boundary dispute with  Maryland, which also lasted throughout the colonial period; the dispute  with Virginia over the site of Pittsburgh is not so voluminous.  All these controversies"]]]
