[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32455"],[0,"Christmas Eve and Christmas Day: Ten Christmas stories (#10)"],[1,"can I do for you?\"    \"Some whiskey,--first of all.\"    \"There are two bottles,\" said Mary, who was holding the candle,--\"in the  cupboard, behind his dressing-glass.\"    I took Bridget with me, struck a light in the dressing-room (how she  blundered about the match), and found the cupboard door locked! Key  doubtless in Mary's pocket,--probably in pocket of \"another dress.\" I  did not ask. Took my own bunch, willed tremendously that my account-book  drawer key should govern the lock, and it did. If it had not, I should  have put my fist through the panels. Bottle of bedbug poison; bottle  marked \"bay rum\"; another bottle with no mark; two bottles of Saratoga  water. \"Set them all on the floor, Bridget.\" A tall bottle of Cologne.  Bottle marked in MS. What in the world is it? \"Bring that candle,  Bridget.\" \"Eau destillee. Marron, Montreal.\" What in the world did  Lycidas bring distilled water from Montreal for? And then Morton's clear  voice in the other room, \"As quick as you can, Fred.\" \"Yes! in one  moment. Put all these on the floor, Bridget.\" Here they are at last.  \"Bourbon whiskey.\" \"Corkscrew, Bridget.\"    \"Indade, sir, and where is it?\" \"Where? I don't know. Run down as quick  as you can, and bring it. His wife cannot leave him.\" So Bridget ran,  and the first I heard was the rattle as she pitched down the last six  stairs of the first flight headlong. Let us hope she has not broken her  leg. I meanwhile am driving a silver pronged fork into the Bourbon  corks, and the blade of my own penknife on the other side.    \"Now, Fred,\" from George within. (We all call Morton \"George.\") \"Yes, in  one moment,\" I replied. Penknife blade breaks off, fork pulls right out,  two crumbs of cork come with it. Will that girl never come?    I turned round; I found a goblet on the washstand; I took Lycidas's  heavy clothes-brush, and knocked off the neck of the bottle. Did you  ever do it, reader, with one of those pressed glass bottles they make  now? It smashed like a Prince Rupert's drop in my hand, crumbled into  seventy pieces,--a nasty smell of whiskey on the floor,--and I, holding  just the hard bottom of the thing with two large spikes running  worthless up into the air. But I seized the goblet, poured into it what  was left in the bottom, and carried it in to Morton as quietly as I  could. He bade me give Lycidas as much as he could swallow; then showed  me how to substitute my thumb for his, and compress the great artery.  When he was satisfied that he could trust me, he began his work again,  silently; just speaking what must be said to that brave Mary, who seemed  to have three hands because he needed them. When all was secure, he  glanced at the ghastly white face, with beads of perspiration on the  forehead and upper lip, laid his finger on the pulse, and said: \"We will  have a little more whiskey. No, Mary, you are overdone already; let Fred  bring it.\" The truth was that poor Mary was almost as white as Lycidas.  She would not faint,--that was the only reason she did not,--and at the  moment I wondered that she did not fall. I believe George and I were  both expecting it, now the excitement was over. He called her Mary, and  me Fred, because we were all together every day of our lives. Bridget,  you see, was still nowhere.    So I retired for my whiskey again,--to attack that other bottle. George  whispered quickly as I went, \"Bring enough,--bring the bottle.\" Did he  want the bottle corked? Would that Kelt ever come up stairs? I passed  the bell-rope as I went into the dressing-room, and rang as hard as I  could ring. I took the other bottle, and bit steadily with my teeth at  the cork, only, of course, to wrench the end of it off. George called  me, and I stepped back. \"No,\" said he, \"bring your whiskey.\"    Mary had just rolled gently back on the floor. I went again in despair.  But I heard Bridget's step this time. First flight, first passage;  second flight, second passage. She ran in in triumph at length, with a  _screw-driver_!    \"No!\" I whispered,--\"no. The crooked thing you draw corks with,\" and I  showed her the bottle again. \"Find one somewhere and don't come back  without it.\" So she vanished for the second time.    \"Frederic!\" said Morton. I think he never called me so before. Should I  risk the clothes-brush again? I opened Lycidas's own drawers,--papers,  boxes, everything in order,--not a sign of a tool.    \"Frederic!\" \"Yes,\" I said. But why did I say \"Yes\"? \"Father of Mercy,  tell me what to do.\"    And my mazed eyes, dim with tears,--did you ever shed tears from  excitement?--fell on an old razor-strop of those days of shaving, made  by C. WHITTAKER, SHEFFIELD. The \"Sheffield\" stood in black letters out  from the rest like a vision. They make corkscrews in Sheffield too. If  this Whittaker had only made a corkscrew! And what is a \"Sheffield  wimble\"?    Hand in my pocket,--brown paper parcel.    \"Where are you, Frederic?\" \"Yes,\" said I, for the last time. Twine off!  brown paper off. And I learned that the \"Sheffield wimble\" was one of  those things whose name you never heard before, which people sell you in  Thames Tunnel, where a hoof-cleaner, a gimlet, a screw-driver, and a  _corkscrew_ fold into one handle.    \"Yes,\" said I, again. \"Pop,\" said the cork. \"Bubble, bubble, bubble,\"  said the whiskey. Bottle in one hand, full tumbler in the other, I  walked in. George poured half a tumblerful down Lycidas's throat that  time. Nor do I dare say how much he poured down afterwards. I found that  there was need of it, from what he said of the pulse, when it was all  over. I guess Mary had some, too.    This was the turning-point. He was exceedingly weak, and we sat by him  in turn through the night, giving, at short intervals, stimulants and  such food as he could swallow easily; for I remember Morton was very  particular not to raise his head more than we could help. But there was  no real danger after this.    As we turned away from the house on Christmas morning,--I to preach and  he to visit his patients,--he said to me, \"Did you make that whiskey?\"    \"No,\" said I, \"but poor Dod Dalton had to furnish the corkscrew.\"    And I went down to the chapel to preach. The sermon had been lying ready  at home on my desk,--and Polly had brought it round to me,--for there  had been no time for me to go from Lycidas's home to D Street and to  return. There was the text, all as it was the day before:--        \"They helped every one his neighbor, and every one said to his      brother, Be of good courage. So the carpenter encouraged the      goldsmith, and he that smootheth with the hammer him that smote      the anvil.\"    And there were the pat illustrations, as I had finished them yesterday;  of the comfort Mary Magdalen gave Joanna, the court lady; and the  comfort the court lady gave Mary Magdalen, after the mediator of a new  covenant had mediated between them; how Simon the Cyrenian, and Joseph  of Arimathea, and the beggar Bartimeus comforted each other, gave each  other strength, common force, _com-fort_, when the One Life flowed in  all their veins; how on board the ship the Tent-Maker proved to be  Captain, and the Centurion learned his duty from his Prisoner, and how  they \"_All_ came safe to shore,\" because the New Life was there. But as  I preached, I caught Frye's eye. Frye is always critical; and I said to  myself, \"Frye would not take his illustrations from eighteen hundred  years ago.\" And I saw dear old Dod Dalton trying to keep awake, and  Campbell hard asleep after trying, and Jane Masury looking round to see  if her mother did not come in; and Ezra Sheppard, looking, not so much  at me, as at the window beside me, as if his thoughts were the other  side of the world. And I said to them all, \"O, if I could tell you, my  friends, what every twelve hours of my life tells me,--of the way in  which woman helps woman, and man helps man, when only the ice is  broken,--how we are all rich so soon as we find out that we are all  brothers, and how we are all in want, unless we can call at any moment  for a brother's hand,--then I could make you understand something, in  the lives you lead every day, of what the New Covenant, the New  Commonwealth, the New Kingdom is to be.\"    But I did not dare tell Dod Dalton what Campbell had been doing for  Todd, nor did I dare tell Campbell by what unconscious arts old Dod had  been helping Lycidas. Perhaps the sermon would have been better had I  done so.    But, when we had our tree in the evening at home, I did tell  all this story to Polly and the bairns, and I gave Alice her  measuring-tape,--precious with a spot of Lycidas's blood,--and  Bertha her Sheffield wimble. \"Papa,\" said old Clara, who is the  next child, \"all the people gave presents, did not they, as they  did in the picture in your study?\"    \"Yes,\" said I, \"though they did not all know they were giving them.\"    \"Why do they not give such presents every day?\" said Clara.    \"O child,\" I said, \"it is only for thirty-six hours of the three hundred  and sixty-five days, that all people remember that they are all brothers  and sisters, and those are the hours that we call, therefore, Christmas  eve and Christmas day.\"    \"And when they always remember it,\" said Bertha, \"it will be Christmas  all the time! What fun!\"    \"What fun, to be sure; but, Clara, what is in the picture?\"    \"Why, an old woman has brought eggs to the baby in the manger, and an  old man has brought a sheep. I suppose they all brought what they had.\"    \"I suppose those who came from Sharon brought roses,\" said Bertha. And  Alice, who is eleven, and goes to the Lincoln School, and therefore  knows every thing, said,--\"Yes, and the Damascus people brought Damascus  wimbles.\"    \"This is certain,\" said Polly, \"that nobody tried to give a straw, but  the straw, if he really gave it, carried a blessing.\"          ALICE'S CHRISTMAS-TREE.

Stadelman collector]. Stuart, Misc. Publ., Univ. Michigan Mus.      Zool., 29:38, October 1935. Gaige, Carnegie Inst. Washington Publ.,      457:293, 1936.    _Diagnosis._--Small frogs (Male to 29 mm., Female to 31.6 mm.);  dorsolateral stripes irregular; paravertebral stripes usually broken;  two or three transverse bars on shanks; thighs spotted or not; arms  usually barred; interorbital bar usually present; toes about three  fourths webbed; color brown, tan, or olive-green.    _Variation._--Three hundred and sixty males chosen at random from  throughout the range have snout-vent lengths of 20.7 to 29 mm. (25.9  mm.). The smallest individuals are from Costa Rica and Nicaragua (means  24.2 and 24.4 mm., respectively). The largest individuals are from  Guatemala and El Salvador (mean of each 27.0 mm.). The ratio of the  diameter of the tympanum to that of the eye is more than 60 per cent in  most samples, but in those from Costa Rica and British Honduras it is  smaller. The color pattern is highly variable. Some specimens are dark  brown or pale brown in color. Incomplete dorsal stripes are present in  94.6 per cent of the specimens, and transverse bars are present on the  shanks in 98.3 per cent of the specimens. The interorbital spot varies  from transverse to longitudinal in position, and an irregular white  line extends from the upper jaw to the arm in some specimens (Table 7).    _Distribution._--_Hyla staufferi staufferi_ inhabits savanna and  subhumid and xeric forests in the lowlands and moderate elevations from  southern Tamaulipas southward to Nicaragua on the Caribbean versant and  from Guerrero, Mexico to northwestern Costa Rica on the Pacific  lowlands (Fig. 7). Duellman (1963:226) commented that a specimen from  Chinaja, Guatemala, possibly was transported there in the cargo from  Toocog, because with this one exception the species is unknown in  tropical rainforest in Guatemala.

Kansas Publ., Mus. Nat. Hist., 17:274, June      17, 1966.    _Diagnosis._--Small frogs (Male to 26 mm., Female to 27 mm.);  dorsolateral and paravertebral stripes complete; longitudinal dark gray  stripe on shank; thighs unmarked; interorbital bar usually absent; toes  about three fifths webbed; gray to brownish gray above.    _Variation._--_Hyla staufferi altae_ is less variable in size,  proportions, and color pattern than is _H. s. staufferi_. The size  varies from 21.7 to 26 mm. (23.6) in 72 males. The ratio of tibia to  snout-vent length is 0.42 to 0.50 (0.45), slightly less than in the  northern subspecies. In color pattern 94.5 per cent of the individuals  have complete dorsal stripes, and all have a longitudinal stripe on the  shank (Table 7).    _Distribution._--This subspecies is restricted to subhumid forests and  savannas on the Pacific lowlands of Panama. _Hyla s. altae_ is  presently known to occur from Chepo in east-central Panama through the  Azuero Peninsula to Concepcion, Chiriqui, in western Panama (Fig. 7).    _Specimens Examined._--Panama: _Canal Zone_: No specific locality, TNHC  24406; 2.8 km SW Fort Kobbe, KU 101679. _Chiriqui_: 14.4 km E  Concepcion, AMNH 69799-801; 6.6 km N David, TNHC 32013-4; 2 km S David,  AMNH 68802. _Cocle_: 1 km NE El Cano, KU 101662-75; El Valle de Anton,  AMNH 59601-5, KU 77333-47; 7 km SSW Penonome, KU 101654-61. _Los  Santos_: Tonosi, KU 101246 (tadpoles), 101697-701. _Panama_: 2 km WSW  Chepo, KU 101680-8; 6 km WSW Chepo, KU 77324-27; El Cangrejo (Panama),  KU 101676-8; Nueva Gorgona, AMNH 69991, 69798; 1.5 km W Pacora, KU  77328-32; 2 km N Tocumen, KU 101689-95; 8 km NE Tocumen, KU 101696.          EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY      My assumptions regarding the evolutionary history of the _Hyla rubra_  group in Central America were derived partly from interpretations of the  evolutionary history of other animal groups (Simpson, 1943, 1965; Dunn,  1931b; Stuart, 1950; Duellman, 1958, 1960, 1963, 1965; and Duellman and  Trueb, 1966). The origin and early evolution of the group probably  occurred prior to the Mid-Pliocene in the lowlands of South America,  because the greatest diversity of the group is in Brazil.
