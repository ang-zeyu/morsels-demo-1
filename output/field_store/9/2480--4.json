Then you've been ground  through the routine of colonial service so many years that you've lost  every viewpoint except the state's expediency. Thank God, I haven't!  That is why I think I can do something for you in Bulungan--\"    He checked himself. \"Common sense and a little elemental justice go a  long, long way in dealing with savages,\" he observed.    Sachsen's eyes looked steadily into Peter Gross's. Sachsen's kindly  smile did not falter. But the governor's patience had reached its limit.    \"Look you here, Mynheer Gross,\" he exclaimed, \"I want no sympathy for  that she-devil from my resident.\"    An angry retort leaped to Peter Gross's lips, but before it could be  uttered Sachsen's hand had leaped across the table and had gripped his  warningly.    \"She may be as beautiful as a houri, but she is a witch, a very  Jezebel,\" the governor stormed. \"I have nipped a dozen uprisings in the  bud, and this Koyala has been at the bottom of all of them. She hates us  _orang blandas_ with a hate that the fires of hell could not burn out,  but she is subtler than the serpent that taught Mother Eve. She has  bewitched my _controlleur_; see that she does not bewitch you. I have  put a price on her head; your first duty will be to see that she is  delivered for safe-keeping here in Batavia.\"    The governor's eyes were sparkling fire. There was a like anger in Peter  Gross's face; he was on the point of speaking when Sachsen's nails dug  so deeply into his hand that he winced.    \"Mynheer Gross is an American, therefore he is chivalrous,\" Sachsen  observed. \"He aims to be just, but there is much that he does not  understand. If your excellency will permit me--\"    Van Schouten gave assent by picking up his pipe and closing his teeth  viciously on the mouthpiece.    Sachsen promptly addressed Peter Gross.    \"Vrind Pieter,\" he said, \"I am glad you have spoken. Now we understand  each other. You are just what I knew you were, fearless, honest, frank.  You have convinced me the more that you are the man we must have as  resident of Bulungan.\"    Peter Gross looked up distrustfully. Van Schouten, too, evinced his  surprise by taking the pipe from his mouth.    \"But,\" Sachsen continued, \"you have the common failing of youth. Youth  dreams dreams, it would rebuild this sorry world and make it Paradise  before the snake. It is sure it can. With age comes disillusionment. We  learn we cannot do the things we have set our hands to do in the way we  planned. We learn we must compromise. Once old Sachsen had thoughts  like yours. To-day\"--he smiled tenderly--\"he has the beginnings of  wisdom. That is, he has learned that God ordains. Do you believe that,  Vrind Pieter?\"    \"Ay, of course,\" Peter Gross acknowledged, a trifle bewildered. \"But--\"    \"Now, concerning this woman,\" Sachsen cut in briskly. \"We will concede  that she was wronged before she was born. We will concede the sin of her  father. We will concede his second sin, leaving her mother to die in the  jungle. We will concede the error, if error it was, to educate Koyala in  a mission school among white children. We will concede the fatal error  of permitting her to return to her own people, knowing the truth of her  birth.\"    His voice took a sharper turn.    \"But there are millions of children born in your own land, in my land,  in every land, with deformed bodies, blind perhaps, crippled, with faces  uglier than baboons. Why? Because one or both of their parents sinned.  Now I ask you,\" he demanded harshly, \"whether these children, because of  the sin of their parents, have the right to commit crimes, plot murders,  treasons, rebellions, and stir savage people to wars of extermination  against their white rulers? What is your answer?\"    \"That is not the question,\" Peter Gross began, but Sachsen interrupted.    \"It is the question. It was the sin of the parent in both cases. Leveque  sinned; his daughter, Koyala, suffers. Parents sin everywhere, their  children must suffer.\"    Peter Gross stared at the wall thoughtfully.    \"Look you here, Vrind Pieter,\" Sachsen said, \"learn this great truth.  The state is first, then the individual. Always the good of the whole  people, that is the state, first, then the good of the individual.  Thousands may suffer, thousands may die, but if the race benefits, the  cost is nothing. This law is as old as man. Each generation says it a  new way, but the law is the same. And so with this Koyala. She was  wronged, we will admit it. But she cannot be permitted to make the whole  white race pay for those wrongs and halt progress in Borneo for a  generation. She will have justice; his excellency is a just man. But  first there must be peace in Bulungan. There must be no more plottings,  no more piracies, no more head-hunting. The spear-heads must be  separated from their shafts, the krisses must be buried, the _sumpitans_  must be broken in two. If Koyala will yield, this can be done. If you  can persuade her to trust us, Pieter, half your work is done. Bulungan  will become one of our fairest residencies, its trade will grow, the  piracies will be swept from the seas, and the days of head-hunting will  become a tradition.\"    Peter Gross bowed his head.    \"God help me, I will,\" he vowed.    \"But see that she does not seduce you, Vrind Pieter,\" the old man  entreated earnestly. \"You are both young, she is fair, and she is a  siren, a vampire. Hold fast to your God, to your faith, to the oath you  take as a servant of the state, and do not let her beauty blind you--no,  nor your own warm heart either, Pieter.\"    Sachsen rose. There were tears in his eyes as he looked fondly down at  the young man that owed so much to him.    \"Pieter,\" he said, \"old Sachsen will pray for you. I must leave you now,  Pieter; the governor desires to talk to you.\"          CHAPTER VI    THE PIRATE LEAGUE      As Sachsen left the room the governor snapped shut the silver cap on the  porcelain bowl of his pipe and regretfully laid the pipe aside.    \"_Nu_, Mynheer Gross, what troops will you need?\" he asked in a  business-like manner. \"I have one thousand men here in Java that you may  have if you need them. For the sea there is the gun-boat, _Prins  Lodewyk_, and the cutter, _Katrina_, both of which I place at your  disposal.\"    \"I do not need a thousand men, your excellency,\" Peter Gross replied  quietly.    \"Ha! I thought not!\" the governor exclaimed with satisfaction. \"An army  is useless in the jungle. Let them keep their crack troops in the  Netherlands and give me a few hundred irregulars who know the cane and  can bivouac in the trees if they have to. Your Amsterdammer looks well  enough on parade, but his skin is too thin for our mosquitoes. But that  is beside the question. Would five hundred men be enough, Mynheer Gross?  We have a garrison of fifty at Bulungan.\"    Peter Gross frowned reflectively at the table-top.    \"I would not need five hundred men, your excellency,\" he announced.    The governor's smile broadened. \"You know more about jungle warfare  than I gave you credit for, Mynheer Gross,\" he complimented. \"But I  should have known that the rescuer of Lieutenant de Koren was no novice.  Only this morning I remarked to General Vanden Bosch that a capable  commander and three hundred experienced bush-fighters are enough to  drive the last pirate out of Bulungan and teach our Dyaks to cultivate  their long-neglected plantations. What say you to three hundred of our  best colonials, _mynheer_?\"    \"I will not need three hundred men, your excellency,\" Peter Gross  declared.    Van Schouten leaned back in surprise.    \"Well, Mynheer Gross, how large a force will you need?\"    Peter Gross's long, ungainly form settled lower in his chair. His legs  crossed and his chin sagged into the palm of his right hand. The fingers  pulled gently at his cheeks. After a moment's contemplation he looked up  to meet the governor's inquiring glance and remarked:    \"Your excellency, I shall need about twenty-five men.\"    Van Schouten stared at him in astonishment.    \"Twenty-five men, Mynheer Gross!\" he exclaimed. \"What do you mean?\"    \"Twenty-five men, men like I have in mind, will be all I will need, your  excellency,\" Peter Gross assured gravely.    Van Schouten edged his chair nearer. \"Mynheer Gross, do you understand  me correctly?\" he asked doubtfully. \"I would make you resident of  Bulungan. I would give you supreme authority in the province. The  commandant, Captain Van Slyck, would be subject to your orders. You will  be answerable only to me.\"    \"Under no other conditions would I accept your excellency's  appointment,\" Peter Gross declared.    \"But, Mynheer Gross, what can twenty-five do? Bulungan has more than one  hundred thousand inhabitants, few of whom have ever paid a picul of rice  or kilo of coffee as tax to the crown. On the coast there are the  Chinese pirates, the Bugi outlaws from Macassar and their traitorous  allies, the coast Dyaks of Bulungan, of Tidoeng, and Pasir, ay, as far  north as Sarawak, for those British keep their house in no better order  than we do ours. In the interior we have the hill Dyaks, the worst  thieves and cut-throats of them all. But these things you know. I ask  you again, what can twenty-five do against so many?\"    \"With good fortune, bring peace to Bulungan,\" Peter Gross replied  confidently.    The governor leaned aggressively across the table and asked the one-word  pointed question:    \"How?\"    Peter Gross uncrossed his legs and tugged gravely at his chin.    \"Your excellency,\" he said, \"I have a plan, not fully developed as yet,  but a plan. As your excellency well knows, there are two nations of  Dyaks in the province. There are the hillmen--\"    \"Damned thieving, murdering, head-hunting scoundrels!\" the governor  growled savagely.    \"So your excellency has been informed. But I believe that much of the  evil that is said of them is untrue.

But when Charles Martel, with his Christian warriors, appeared on  the field at sunrise there was no enemy to fight. The Mohammedans  had fled in the silence and darkness of the night and had left  behind them all their valuable spoils. There was now no doubt which  side had won.    The battle of Tours, or Poitiers, as it should be called, is regarded  as one of the decisive battles of the world. It decided that Christians,  and not Moslems, should be the ruling power in Europe.    Charles Martel is especially celebrated as the hero of this battle.  It is said that the name _Martel_ was given to him because of his  bravery during the fight. Marteau (_mar-to'_) is the French word  for hammer, and one of the old French historians says that as a  hammer breaks and crushes iron and steel, so Charles broke and  crushed the power of his enemies in the battle of Tours.    But though the Saracens fled from the battlefield of Tours, they  did not leave the land of the Franks; and Charles had to fight  other battles with them, before they were finally defeated. At  last, however, he drove them across the Pyrenees, and they never  again attempted to invade Frankland.    After his defeat of the Saracens Charles Martel was looked upon as  the great champion of Christianity; and to the day of his death,  in 741, he was in reality, though not in name, the king of the  Franks.    III    Charles Martel had two sons, Pepin and Carloman. For a time they  ruled together, but Carloman wished to lead a religious life, so he  went to a monastery and became a monk. Then Pepin was sole ruler.    Pepin was quite low in stature, and therefore was called Pepin  the Short. But he had great strength and courage. A story is told  of him, which shows how fearless he was.    One day he went with a few of his nobles to a circus to see a fight  between a lion and a bull. Soon after the fight began, it looked  as though the bull was getting the worst of it. Pepin cried out  to his companions:    \"Will one of you separate the beasts?\"    But there was no answer. None of them had the courage to make the  attempt. Then Pepin jumped from his seat, rushed into the arena,  and with a thrust of his sword killed the lion.    In the early years of Pepin's rule as mayor of the palace the throne  was occupied by a king named Chil'der-ic III. Like his father and  the other \"do-nothing\" kings, Childeric cared more for pleasures  and amusements than for affairs of government. Pepin was the real  ruler, and after a while he began to think that he ought to have  the title of king, as he had all the power and did all the work  of governing and defending the kingdom.    So he sent some friends to Rome to consult the Pope. They said to  His Holiness:    \"Holy father, who ought to be the king of France--the man who has  the title, or the man who has the power and does all the duties  of king?\"    \"Certainly,\" replied the Pope, \"the man who has the power and does  the duties.\"    \"Then, surely,\" said they, \"Pepin ought to be the king of the Franks;  for he has all the power.\"    The Pope gave his consent, and Pepin was crowned king of the Franks;  and thus the reign of Childeric ended and that of Pepin began.    During nearly his whole reign Pepin was engaged in war. Several  times he went to Italy to defend the Pope against the Lombards.  These people occupied certain parts of Italy, including the province  still called Lombardy.    Pepin conquered them and gave as a present to the Pope that part  of their possessions which extended for some distance around Rome.  This was called \"Pepin's Donation.\" It was the beginning of what is  known as the \"temporal power\" of the Popes, that is, their power  as rulers of part of Italy.    Pepin died in 768.          CHARLEMAGNE    KING FROM 768-814 A.D.    I    Pepin had two sons Charles and Carloman. After the death of their  father they ruled together, but in a few years Carloman died, and  then Charles became sole king.    This Charles was the most famous of the kings of the Franks. He did  so many great and wonderful things that he is called Charlemagne  (_shar-le-main'_) which means Charles the Great.    He was a great soldier. For thirty years he carried on a war against  the Saxons. Finally he conquered them, and their great chief, Wittekind,  submitted to him. The Saxons were a people of Germany, who then  lived near the land of the Franks. They spoke the same language  and were of the same race as the Franks, but had not been civilized  by contact with the Romans.    They were still pagans, just as the Franks had been before Clovis  became a Christian. They actually offered human sacrifices.    After Charlemagne conquered them he made their lands part of his  kingdom. A great number of them, among whom was Wittekind, then  became Christians and were baptized; and soon they had churches  and schools in many parts of their country.    Another of Charlemagne's wars was against the Lombards.    Pepin, as you have read, had defeated the Lombards and given to  the Pope part of the country held by them. The Lombard king now  invaded the Pope's lands and threatened Rome itself; so the Pope  sent to Charlemagne for help.    Charlemagne quickly marched across the Alps and attacked the Lombards.  He drove them out of the Pope's lands and took possession of their  country.    After he had conquered the Lombards he carried on war, in 778,  in Spain. A large portion of Spain was then held by the Moorish  Saracens. But a Mohammedan leader from Damascus had invaded their  country, and the Moors invited Charlemagne to help them. He therefore  led an army across the Pyrenees. He succeeded in putting his Moorish  friends in possession of their lands in Spain and then set out on  his return to his own country.    On the march his army was divided into two parts. The main body  was led by Charlemagne himself. The rear guard was commanded by a  famous warrior named Roland. While marching through the narrow pass  of Roncesvalles (_ron-thes-val'yes_), among the Pyrenees, Roland's  division was attacked by a tribe called the Basques (_basks_), who  lived on the mountain slopes of the neighboring region.    [Illustration: THE BAPTISM OF WITTEKIND]    High cliffs walled in the pass on either side. From the tops of  these cliffs the Basques hurled down rocks and trunks of trees  upon the Franks, and crushed many of them to death. Besides this,  the wild mountaineers descended into the pass and attacked them  with weapons. Roland fought bravely; but at last he was overpowered,  and he and all his men were killed.    Roland had a friend and companion named Oliver, who was as brave  as himself. Many stories and songs have been written telling of  the wonderful adventures they were said to have had and of their  wonderful deeds in war.    The work of Charlemagne in Spain was quickly undone; for Abd-er-Rahman,  the leader of the Mohammedans who had come from Damascus, soon  conquered almost all the territory south of the Pyrenees.    [Illustration: ROLAND IN THE BATTLE OF RONCESVALLES]    For more than forty years Charlemagne was king of the Franks; but  a still greater dignity was to come to him. In the year 800 some  of the people in Rome rebelled against the Pope, and Charlemagne  went with an army to put down the rebellion. He entered the city  with great pomp and soon conquered the rebels. On Christmas day  he went to the church of St. Peter, and as he knelt before the  altar the Pope placed a crown upon his head, saying:    \"Long live Charles Augustus, Emperor of the Romans.\"    The people assembled in the church shouted the same words; and so  Charlemagne was now emperor of the Western Roman Empire, as well  as king of the Franks.[*]    [Footnote: The emperors of Constantinople still called themselves  Roman Emperors, and still claimed Italy, Germany and France as  parts of their empire, though really their authority had not been  respected in these countries for more than 300 years.]    Charlemagne built a splendid palace at Aix-la-Chapelle  (_aks-la-shap-el'_), a town in Germany, where perhaps he was born.    Charlemagne was a tall man, with long, flowing beard, and of noble  appearance. He dressed in very simple style; but when he went into  battle he wore armor, as was the custom for kings and nobles, and  often for ordinary soldiers in his day.    [Illustration: THE POPE CROWNING CHARLEMAGNE]    Armor was made of leather or iron, or both together. There was a  helmet of iron for the head, and a breastplate to cover the breast,  or a coat of mail to cover the body. The coat of mail was made of  small iron or steel rings linked together, or fastened on to a  leather shirt. Coverings for the legs and feet were often attached  to the coat.    II    Charlemagne was a great king in may other ways besides the fighting  of battles. He did much for the good of his people. He made many  excellent laws and appointed judges to see that the laws were carried  out. He established schools and placed good teachers in charge of  them. He had a school in his palace for his own children, and he  employed as their teacher a very learned Englishman named Alcuin  (_al'kwin_).    In those times few people could read or write. There were not many  schools anywhere, and in most places there were none at all. Even  the kings had little education. Indeed, few of them could write  their own names, and most of them did not care about sending their  children to school. They did not think that reading or writing was  of much use; but thought that it was far better for boys to learn  to be good soldiers, and for girls to learn to spin and weave.    Charlemagne had a very different opinion. He was fond of learning;  and whenever he heard of a learned man, living in any foreign country,  he tried to get him to come and live in Frankland.
