I see no reason why girls should not go up and down stairs just as  freely as boys, if they are properly dressed; but going up and down  stairs in tight clothing is certainly very injurious.          CHAPTER IX.    BATHING.      You and your girl friends take much pains with your personal  adornment. You spend time in curling your hair and in putting on  ribbons and laces, but I sometimes think you do not pay as much  attention to personal cleanliness as you ought. It would seem as if  some of you thought that powder would cover a defect in cleanliness  and perfumery would conceal the odors of the person; but indeed it  seems to me that the stylish make-up of your dress or the curl of your  hair is of very little importance compared with the care of your  health.    You each desire to have a beautiful complexion. I used to be told in  my childhood that beauty was only skin-deep, but I have learned  better. I know that even the beauty of the complexion depends upon the  integrity of the nutritive organs as well as upon the care and  attention given to matters of personal cleanliness.    I read the other day of a discussion between two young men concerning  the cleanliness of girls of their acquaintance. One young man noticed  that although one of the girls wore a very pretty dress-gown, she had  forgotten to clean her finger-nails. The other remarked that many  things in regard to a girl's personal cleanliness could be learned by  riding behind her on a tandem. The two then commented favorably upon  the girl whose nails were pink, whose ears and neck were clean, her  teeth white and dazzling, and her hair well brushed. I might say, in  passing, that this hair-brushing time at night may be well employed in  reviewing the experiences of the day in order to learn the lessons  they teach, and thereby to avoid to-morrow the mistakes of to-day.    These same young men also said that the complexions of some girls  suggested the idea of too little fresh air and too much candy. This,  they agreed, it was impossible to hide with powder. So we see that the  care of the skin is quite important if one would have the respect and  the admiration of her associates.    The skin is a very beautiful, complex and delicate covering of the  body. It consists of six layers, and contains arteries, capillaries,  lymphatics, nerves, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, pigment, etc. So  you see that the care of the skin involves much. One writer has said,  \"At the skin man ends and the outlying universe begins.\"    The skin, filled with nerves, is continually reporting to the brain  concerning what is the condition of all parts of the body. The  condition of the skin reflects the condition of the digestive organs.  Many girls are trying to cure pimples on the face by the use of salves  and lotions, when in all probability all that they would need to do to  gain a good complexion is to pay attention to diet, to quit eating  between meals, and not to eat so much pastry, pickles or sweetmeats.  Our athletes and pugilists are learning that they must take care of  the skin if they would keep in good condition, and they are what in  horses would be called well groomed. The skin is rubbed, cared for,  kept active, because it is understood that it is an organ of  sensation, of secretion, of excretion, of absorption, and of  respiration. More solid matter is thrown out from the skin than from  the lungs, in the proportion of eleven to seven. It is even more than  the excretion from the bowels.    The skin is an organ of breathing. This seems strange to us, but it  really does take up oxygen and give out carbonic acid, so upon the  condition of the skin will depend very largely the condition of the  general health. We can detect a constipated condition of the bowels  through the color and odor of the skin.    Many girls feel that it is more delicate to neglect the care of the  bowels than to attend to a daily evacuation, but if they would  remember that it is just as indelicate to carry effete or dead matter  about in the bowels as it would be to carry it upon the person in any  other way, they would realize that it is only politeness and  refinement to see that this part of their bodily housekeeping is duly  attended to. If the bowels do not do their work the skin will be  obliged to take extra labor upon itself; so, as we have said, by the  odor of the skin we can detect the fact that the skin is doing the  work that should be done by the bowels. When a person is sick the  condition of the internal organs is shown in the complexion, and  nothing more clearly indicates health than the condition of the skin.    If this is so important, how shall we care for the skin? First, by  bathing. The tin bath-tub of the Englishman accompanies him in all his  travels, and has penetrated even to the jungles of Africa. Bathing  appliances are marks of civilization, and the bath-room is becoming a  necessity. Where the bath-room does not exist it is easy to bathe  thoroughly and completely. A wash-basin of water, with a sponge and  towel, furnish all that is absolutely necessary. A most convenient  bath is the portable thermal bath, an arrangement of rubber cloth that  can be opened out to form a square enclosure in which the person sits,  with the head in the free outside air, the body enveloped in steam  generated by an alcohol lamp. This, followed by a quick sponge-bath of  cool water, is a most efficient way of cleansing the skin; and this  bath may be used in any room, no matter how beautifully furnished,  without soiling the carpet or furniture in the least.    One great secret of healthful bathing is, when warm or hot water is  used, to follow it by an immediate application of cold water, which  leaves the skin in a tonic condition. In preparation for going out in  cold weather, nothing is so efficient a protection from the cold as a  foot-bath. Soak the feet for a few minutes in water as warm as is  comfortable, then plunge them into cold water and remove immediately,  or throw cold water over them, wipe them thoroughly dry, rub them with  a little olive oil, draw on a pair of clean, warm hose, and the feet  are not only warmed, but are protected against cold and will stay  warm. These precautions will prevent one taking cold from the  foot-bath. Care of the feet is a great necessity not only for health,  for equalizing the circulation, but for the prevention of unpleasant  odors.    As to time of bathing, I suppose that the body is at its highest point  of vital power at about ten o'clock in the morning, but this is, for  most people, the most inconvenient time for a bath. The circumstances  of the individual are to be consulted, and also the effect of bathing.  There are those who are made nervous by taking a bath, consequently  they will not be benefited by taking one just before going to bed. In  other cases the bath conduces to slumber. This depends very largely  upon the amount of blood in the brain. A person with an anaemic brain  will not be benefited by the bath at bedtime, but the person whose  brain is overcharged with blood will find the evening bath quieting.    I would not advise everybody to take a daily bath. There are those who  are benefited by it; there are others who might be injured by it. It  is best to study personal peculiarities and to watch the effect of the  bath. If, within a few hours, or the next day, there is great  exhaustion, one might naturally conclude that the bath was not  altogether beneficial. There are those in such delicate health that a  cold bath at any time does not seem desirable; but constant attention  will secure perfect cleanliness, as the arms and chest can be bathed  one day, the abdomen and back another, the lower extremities still  another day, and so the whole body be compassed twice or more in the  space of a week.    In regard to the use of soap for bathing purposes, the finest, purest  soaps should be used, and these alone. It is generally supposed that  pure, white castile soap is the best. Various soaps are widely  advertised, while some that claim to be of the very best are not  always up to the requisite standard. Yet one can tell by a little  experience what soap is of pure quality, and such soap can be applied  even to the face without injury.    In washing the face the hand is probably the best instrument, with the  thumb under the chin, the fingers turned toward the upper part of the  face. The manipulation should be against the direction of forming  wrinkles, wherever there is a tendency for wrinkles to appear. They  can be held in check by the judicious manipulation of the fingers in  the opposite direction. Wrinkles are created by obliterating the  capillary circulation of the skin. The manipulation increases the  circulation, and so tends to overcome wrinkles. The expression of the  face may form wrinkles. I saw a girl the other day on a street-car who  continually held her eyebrows elevated, forming longitudinal lines  across her forehead, which had become as fixed in her youthful face as  if she had been seventy years of age. This was a lack of care in the  governing of the expression of the face, and also a lack in keeping up  the capillary circulation.    The care of the hands may be considered also while discussing the  question of bathing. The hands should be kept clean, the finger-nails  particularly cared for, as much of the beauty of the hands depends  upon the delicate appearance of the finger-nails. The manicure sets,  which are at the disposal of almost every young woman of the present  day, are a very great addition to toilet appurtenances. The curved  scissors, the polisher, the blunt ivory instrument for pushing back  the fold of skin from the root of the nail, all of these used but a  few moments in the day will conduce to great beauty in the hands, even  for those who are doing housework.          PART II.    NEED OF SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2846"],[0,"The Life of Flavius Josephus (#10)"],[1," to disbelieve.  However, they desired me to lodge some where else, because the next day  was the sabbath, and that it was not fit the city of Tiberias should be  disturbed [on that day].    54. So I suspected nothing, and went away to Tarichese; yet did I withal  leave some to make inquiry in the city how matters went, and whether any  thing was said about me: I also set many persons all the way that led  from Tarichese to Tiberias, that they might communicate from one to  another, if they learned any news from those that were left in the city.  On the next day, therefore, they all came into the Proseucha; [22] it  was a large edifice, and capable of receiving a great number of people;  thither Jonathan went in, and though he durst not openly speak of  a revolt, yet did he say that their city stood in need of a better  governor than it then had. But Jesus, who was the ruler, made no scruple  to speak out, and said openly, \"O fellow citizens! it is better for you  to be in subjection to four than to one; and those such as are of high  birth, and not without reputation for their wisdom;\" and pointed to  Jonathan and his colleagues. Upon his saying this, Justus came in and  commended him for what he had said, and persuaded some of the people to  be of his mind also. But the multitude were not pleased with what was  said, and had certainly gone into a tumult, unless the sixth hour, which  was now come, had dissolved the assembly, at which hour our laws require  us to go to dinner on sabbath days; so Jonathan and his colleagues put  off their council till the next day, and went off without success.  When I was informed of these affairs, I determined to go to the city of  Tiberias in the morning. Accordingly, on the next day, about the first  hour of the day, I came from Tarichee, and found the multitude already  assembled in the Proseucha; but on what account they were gotten  together, those that were assembled did not know. But when Jonathan and  his colleagues saw me there unexpectedly, they were in disorder; after  which they raised a report of their own contrivance, that Roman horsemen  were seen at a place called Union, in the borders of Galilee, thirty  furlongs distant from the city. Upon which report, Jonathan and his  colleagues cunningly exhorted me not to neglect this matter, nor to  suffer the land to be spoiled by the enemy. And this they said with a  design to remove me out of the city, under the pretense of the want of  extraordinary assistance, while they might dispose the city to be my  enemy.    55. As for myself, although I knew of their design, yet did I comply  with what they proposed, lest the people of Tiberias should have  occasion to suppose that I was not careful of their security. I  therefore went out; but, when I was at the place, I found not the least  footsteps of any enemy, so I returned as fast as ever I could, and found  the whole council assembled, and the body of the people gotten together,  and Jonathan and his colleagues bringing vehement accusations against  me, as one who had no concern to ease them of the burdens of war, and  as one that lived luxuriously. And as they were discoursing thus, they  produced four letters, as written to them from some people that lived  at the borders of Galilee, imploring that they would come to their  assistance, for that there was an army of Romans, both horsemen and  footmen, who would come and lay waste the country on the third day;  they desired them also to make haste, and not to overlook them. When the  people of Tiberias heard this, they thought they spake truth, and made a  clamor against me, and said I ought not to sit still, but to go away to  the assistance of their countrymen. Hereupon I said [for I understood  the meaning of Jonathan and his colleagues] that I was ready to comply  with what they proposed, and without delay to march to the war which  they spake of, yet did I advise them, at the same time, that since  these letters declared that the Romans would make their assault in four  several places, they should part their forces into five bodies, and make  Jonathan and his colleagues generals of each body of them, because it  was fit for brave men, not only to give counsel, but to take the place  of leaders, and assist their countrymen when such a necessity pressed  them; for, said I, it is not possible for me to lead more than one  party. This advice of mine greatly pleased the multitude; so they  compelled them to go forth to the war. But their designs were put into  very much disorder, because they had not done what they had designed  to do, on account of my stratagem, which was opposite to their  undertakings.    56. Now there was one whose name was Ananias [a wicked man he was, and  very mischievous]; he proposed that a general religious fast [23] should  be appointed the next day for all the people, and gave order that at the  same hour they should come to the same place, without any weapons, to  make it manifest before God, that while they obtained his assistance,  they thought all these weapons useless. This he said, not out of piety,  but that they might catch me and my friends unarmed. Now, I was hereupon  forced to comply, lest I should appear to despise a proposal that tended  to piety. As soon, therefore, as we were gone home, Jonathan and his  colleagues wrote to John to come to them in the morning, and desiring  him to come with as many soldiers as he possibly could, for that they  should then be able easily to get me into their hands, and to do all  they desired to do. When John had received this letter, he resolved to  comply with it. As for myself, on the next day, I ordered two of  the guards of my body, whom I esteemed the most courageous and most  faithful, to hide daggers under their garments, and to go along with me,  that we might defend ourselves, if any attack should be made upon us by  our enemies. I also myself took my breastplate, and girded on my sword,  so that it might be, as far as it was possible, concealed, and came into  the Proseucha.    57. Now Jesus, who was the ruler, commanded that they should exclude all  that came with me, for he kept the door himself, and suffered none but  his friends to go in. And while we were engaged in the duties of  the day, and had betaken ourselves to our prayers, Jesus got up, and  inquired of me what was become of the vessels that were taken out of the  king's palace, when it was burnt down [and] of that uncoined silver; and  in whose possession they now were? This he said, in order to drive away  time till John should come. I said that Capellus, and the ten principal  men of Tiberias, had them all; and I told him that they might ask them  whether I told a lie or not. And when they said they had them, he asked  me, What is become of those twenty pieces of gold which thou didst  receive upon the sale of a certain weight of uncoined money? I replied,  that I had given them to those ambassadors of theirs, as a maintenance  for them, when they were sent by them to Jerusalem. So Jonathan and his  colleagues said that I had not done well to pay the ambassadors out of  the public money. And when the multitude were very angry at them for  this, for they perceived the wickedness of the men, I understood that a  tumult was going to arise; and being desirous to provoke the people to  a greater rage against the men, I said, \"But if I have not done well in  paying our ambassadors out of the public stock, leave off your anger at  me, for I will repay the twenty pieces of gold myself.\"    58. When I had said this, Jonathan and his colleagues held their peace;  but the people were still more irritated against them, upon their openly  showing their unjust ill-will to me. When Jesus saw this change in file  people, he ordered them to depart, but desired the senate to stay; for  that they could not examine things of such a nature in a tumult: and  as the people were crying out that they would not leave me alone, there  came one and told Jesus and his friends privately, that John and his  armed men were at hand: whereupon Jonathan and his colleagues, being  able to contain themselves no longer, [and perhaps the providence of  God hereby procuring my deliverance, for had not this been so, I had  certainly been destroyed by John,] said, \"O you people of Tiberias!  leave off this inquiry about the twenty pieces of gold; for Josephus  hath not deserved to die for them; but he hath deserved it by his desire  of tyrannizing, and by cheating the multitude of the Galileans with his  speeches, in order to gain the dominion over them.\" When he had said  this, they presently laid hands upon me, and endeavored to kill me: but  as soon as those that were with me saw what they did, they drew their  swords, and threatened to smite them, if they offered any violence to  me. The people also took up stones, and were about to throw them at  Jonathan; and so they snatched me from the violence of my enemies.    59. But as I was gone out a little way, I was just upon meeting John,  who was marching with his armed men. So I was afraid of him, and turned  aside, and escaped by a narrow passage to the lake, and seized on a  ship, and embarked in it, and sailed over to Tarichese. So, beyond my  expectation, I escaped this danger. Whereupon I presently sent for the  chief of the Galileans, and told them after what manner, against all  faith given, I had been very near to destruction from Jonathan and his  colleagues, and the people of Tiberias. Upon which the multitude of the  Galileans were very angry, and encouraged me to delay no longer to make  war upon them, but to permit them to go against John, and utterly  to destroy him, as well as Jonathan and his colleagues. However, I  restrained them, though they were in such a rage, and desired them to  tarry a while, till we should be informed what orders those ambassadors,  that were sent by them to the city of Jerusalem, should bring thence;  for I"]]]
