There was no need to tell  them, no need to show the lead.  They leaped pluckily from their boats  and dashed up the beach.  There was a pause while a few collected.    Then, seeing the Turks firing furiously from a trench ahead, somebody  yelled out, \"Charge!\"  A cheer electrified the chilling dawn as they  rushed on.  Some were killed; some fell, wounded, on the way; the  others pressed forward, their faces grim, their eyes alert, and the  muscles of their arms all taut with the fierce gripping of the rifles  in their hands.  It was their first charge; but they did it like the  veterans of Corunna and Waterloo.    \"Allah!  Allah!\" shouted the Turks as they neared the trenches.    \"Too late, old cock,\" said Bill, plunging his bayonet home.    \"That's one for Paddy Doolan.\"    \"Help, Paddy; this big deevil's got me,\" yelled Sandy, who had been  struck by a Turk.  Crash went the Irishman's butt on the Turk's skull,  and he fell back dead.  Sandy's wound was dressed, and he was sent to  the rear.  Meantime some supports had come up.    Seeing the Turks fleeing into another trench some fifty yards up the  slope, the colonel ordered them to charge again.  The Australians'  blood was up.  They had seen red and had felt success.  They wanted  more.  Throwing off their cumbersome packs, they charged forward again.    \"They've got me,\" shouted an officer, throwing up his arms and letting  out the awful shriek of death.  But this withering fire did not appal  these young Australians.  The sight of their comrades, dead and  wounded, roused them more.  Revenge set their faces hard, and with many  a fierce and terrible oath they leaped into the second trench.    \"The Australians will retire,\" said an officer, jumping in front of the  attacking line.    \"Who said so?\" asked Colonel Killem, looking at the man.    \"I say so.  I'm one of zee Staff.\"    \"You damned German!\" shouted the colonel, shooting him dead.  The game  which had been so well played in France did not come off.    The remnants of the Turks were bayoneted and butted to death; but the  main body were fleeing up the hill.    \"Rapid fire!\" roared the colonel; but the eager men were already after  the enemy with the bayonet.  Up the steep, steep sides of the cliff  they clambered and stumbled.  It was more like a race for a prize than  a juggle with death.  Occasionally the morning light showed the red  blood on the bayonets and hands of the charging men.    These blood-stained, panting soldiers terrified the Turks at the top of  the hill.  Their tactics had surprised them.  They had looked for the  usual musketry assault; instead, they had received the chilling steel.  And the bayonet on a cold morning is a sight that sickens the best.  Furiously they pumped another dose of lead into the gallant  Australians.  More fell dead, others dropped wounded, blood spattered  the grass, and above the din of musketry and guns could be heard the  cries of:    \"Bearers--stretcher bearers!\"    \"Water, for God's sake!\"    \"Send up the doctor.\"    \"I'm done, boys--I'm d-o-n-e!\"    The units, by this time, had become mixed.  Many officers had been  killed.  There was that confusion which is found in all attacks.  Still, all these men knew that \"forward--forward\" was the game.  The  roughest and most daring took charge of little groups, and, with these,  they cheered, cursed, and leaped into the trench at the edge of the  green plateau.  Again, the main body had fled, leaving the more weary  and stubborn to defend the hill.    \"Kill the beggars!\"    \"Plug his bread-basket!\"    These were some of the things that were shouted, for all soldiers, in a  charge, curse like Marlborough's troops did in Flanders.    A charge seems a terrible thing when reading of it at one's fireside.  Folks shiver and ask, \"How can they do it?  Don't they feel afraid?\"  They may at the outset; but the noise, the swing, the officers'  inspiration, the sight of blood and a fleeing foe damp down the  sensitiveness of culture and recreate the primitive lust to kill.    For the moment the man is a savage; Nature blinds him to the perils of  wounds and death.  Duty steels him harder still, and pride of race  tells him that he must do as his fathers did--die like a gentleman and  a soldier.    The success of the first troops inspired the following reserves.  They  all wanted to emulate the Kangaroo Marines and other dashing corps.  Without waiting for their complete units, these little groups crawled,  floundered, and wriggled their way up the gully on to the hill.  It was  now daylight.  As they gained the summit the Turks greeted them with  terrific bursts of shrapnel and common shell.  The crack, the white  puff of smoke, then the scattering balls of lead did not dismay these  warriors.    It roused their curiosity, and, like schoolboys, some stopped to see  the fun of the show.  Cover they disdained.  They were too proud to  duck and hide in a hole or trench.  This was the recklessness for which  they had to pay.  Yet it was useful.  It taught them that to take  advantage of all cover was the modern soldier's game.    \"Extend, boys, extend!\" roared an officer as the reserves came up.  They ran out and tried to make a long, rough line.  They could see the  fleeing Turks, and behind them the Kangaroo Marines and other members  of the first landing force.  Ahead was a little valley and then a  slope.  This was commanded by the Turks.    \"Come on, boys,\" shouted an officer.    Little groups, under subalterns, N.C.O.'s, or privates with the  leader's instinct, dashed towards this hill.  More were killed, more  wounded on the way; but, undaunted, they pushed on.  Up the slopes  crawled, clambered, and cursed the dashing infantry.  They reached  their objective, and, again, the Turks had gone.    \"My God--what a sight!\" said Claud, looking behind.  The ground was  dotted with dead and dying.  Wounded men crawled and limped to the  rear, their clothes soaked in blood.  Men with limbs shattered to pulp  lay moaning and pleading for death.  Others, slightly wounded, poured  water down the parched throats of the suffering.  It was a shambles.  It was war.    Yet the touch of mercy and humanity was not absent.  Doctors and  bearers, disdaining death, tended the wounded and dying.  Under a  ruthless fire orderlies carried the sufferers down to the beach below.  Many were killed at the job.  Nobly they stuck to it.  The heroism of  these Red Cross men is one of the finest things in the Gaba Tepe show.    The attack had now developed into a galloping pursuit.  Turks were  demoralised, and after them went the Australians like whippets on the  course.  There was no regular line.  Little units were here and there.  It was the day for the born leader.  Having no precise information as  to where the pursuit should end and a defensive line made, many pushed  right on with a courage that was amazing.    One group was caught in a gully and decimated; others, who pushed  almost across the Peninsula, were either killed, wounded, or captured.  The remainder, realising the need of consolidating into a general line,  came back to the main body.  With their entrenching tools they dug  holes in the ground, and from behind these little mounds of earth they  kept up a steady fire.  Without rations, without water--and, at times,  without ammunition--they patiently hung on.    All this, too, in a sweltering heat and in the centre of a terrific  bombardment.  It was the greatest trial any force could have  experienced.  The Australians exceeded all expectations.    \"They're coming back again,\" said an officer late that afternoon.    Sure enough, there was the Turkish host.  Rapid fire wiped many out;  still on they came right up to the line.  The Australians charged.  And  all day it was charge and counter-charge.  Officers have seldom  displayed the tenacity and courage of these Australians' leaders.  They  played the game as well as the scions of Eton and other historic  schools.  And then God, in His mercy, sent down the fall of night.  This hid the shambles, gave ease to the wounded and dying, and allowed  the living to snatch a drink and bite.    But none were idle.  On their knees, on their backs, on their sides,  they had to dig in, for the fire was still deadly and many were being  killed and wounded.  The sailors worked like Trojans, bringing rations,  ammunition, and reserves ashore.  Thanks to them, the gunners, and the  untiring zeal of the Staff, the line next day was fairly well  established.    The landing was complete; they had achieved what the Germans had  advertised as the impossible.  Australians have, therefore, every right  to feel proud.  And all Britishers ought to feel proud of them too.          *      *      *      *      *    \"Well, boys--how's things?\" asked Colonel Killem, one day, when  visiting his men in the trenches.    \"A1 at Lloyd's, colonel.  But I reckon we ought to pull old Johnny  Turk's leg.\"    \"How?\"    \"Play tricks on him.  Give a cheer an' kid we're going to charge.  They'll fire every bally round they've got.\"    \"Good idea, Buster--good idea!  We'll do that to-night.\"    About 8 P.M. that night the whole front line fixed bayonets and showed  them above the parapet.  At a given signal all let out a ringing cheer.  The poor old Turks got into an awful stew.  Machine-guns, field-guns,  and rifles opened up a terrific fire.  They kept it up for over half an  hour, firing thousands of rounds.    \"Another cheer, boys,\" ordered the colonel.    \"Bang!  Bang!  Bang!\" went the Turks again.  The ruse was a splendid  one.  But the wily Turk tumbled to the game at last.    \"We'll need to get something new, boys; that game's played out,\" said  the colonel next day.    After consulting his men they hit on another scheme.  About twenty men  were ordered to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2546"],[0,"Hopalong Cassidy's Rustler Round-Up; Or, Bar-20 (#10)"],[1,"rrect, and so was very careful to smile and take it as a joke.  Finally, wearied by his vain efforts to keep it open and fearing for the  door, he hit upon a scheme, the brilliancy of which inflated his chest  and gave him the appearance of a prize-winning bantam. When his patrons  strolled in that night there was no door to slam, as it lay behind the  bar.    When Buck and Red entered, closely followed by Hopalong, they elbowed  their way to the rear of the room, where they could see before being  seen. As yet they had said nothing to Hopalong about Pie's warning and  were debating in their minds whether they should do so or not, when  Hopalong interrupted their thoughts by laughing. They looked up and he  nodded toward the front, where they saw that anxious eyes from all parts  of the room were focused on the open door. Then they noticed that it had  been removed.    The air of semi-hostile, semi-anxious inquiry of the patrons and the  smile of satisfaction covering the face of Baum appealed to them as the  most ludicrous sight their eyes had seen for months, and they leaned  back and roared with laughter, thus calling forth sundry looks of  disapproval from the innocent causes of their merriment. But they were  too well known in Albuquerque to allow the disapproval to approach a  serious end, and finally, as the humorous side of the situation dawned  on the crowd, they joined in the laugh and all went merrily.      At the psychologic moment some one shouted for a dance and the  suggestion met with uproarious approval. At that moment Harris, the  sheriff, came in and volunteered to supply the necessary music if the  crowd would pay the fine against a straying fiddler he had corraled the  day before. A hat was quickly passed and a sum was realized which would  pay several fines to come and Harris departed for the music.    A chair was placed on the bar for the musician and, to the tune of \"Old  Dan Tucker\" and an assortment of similar airs, the board floor shook  and trembled. It was a comical sight and Hopalong, the only wallflower  besides Baum and the sheriff, laughed until he became weak. Cow punchers  play as they work, hard and earnestly, and there was plenty of action.  Sombreros flapped like huge wings and the baggy chaps looked like small,  distorted balloons.    The Virginia reel was a marvel of supple, exaggerated grace and the  quadrille looked like a free-for-all for unbroken colts. The honor  of prompter was conferred upon the sheriff, and he gravely called the  changes as they were usually called in that section of the country:       \"Oh, th' ladies trail in        An' th' gents trail out,     An' all stampede down th' middle.        If yu ain't got th' tin           Yu can dance an' shout,     But yu must keep up with th' fiddle.\"      As the dance waxed faster and the dancers grew hotter Hopalong,  feeling lonesome because he wouldn't face ridicule, even if it was not  expressed, went over and stood by the sheriff. He and Harris were good  friends, for he had received the wound that crippled him in saving the  sheriff from assassination. Harris killed the man who had fired that  shot, and from this episode on the burning desert grew a friendship that  was as strong as their own natures.    Harris was very well liked by the majority and feared by the rest, for  he was a square man and the best sheriff the county had ever known.  Quiet and unassuming, small of stature and with a kind word for every  one, he was a universal favorite among the better class of citizens.  Quick as a flash and unerring in his shooting, he was a nightmare to the  \"bad men.\" No profane word had ever been known to leave his lips, and  he was the possessor of a widespread reputation for generosity. His  face was naturally frank and open; but when his eyes narrowed with  determination it became blank and cold. When he saw his young friend  sidle over to him he smiled and nodded a hearty welcome.        \"They's shore cuttin' her loose,\" remarked Hopalong.    \"First two pairs forward an' back!--they shore is,\" responded the  prompter.    \"Who's th' gent playin' lady to Buck?\" Queried Hopalong.    \"Forward again an' ladies change!--Billy Jordan.\"    Hopalong watched the couple until they swung around and then he laughed  silently. \"Buck's got too many feet,\" he seriously remarked to his  friend.    \"Swing th' girl yu loves th' best!--he ain't lonesome, look at that--\"    Two shots rang out in quick succession and Harris stumbled, wheeled and  pitched forward on his face as Hopalong's sombrero spun across his  body. For a second there was an intense silence, heavy, strained  and sickening. Then a roar broke forth and the crowd of frenzied  merry-makers, headed by Hopalong, poured out into the street and spread  out to search the town. As daylight dawned the searchers began to  straggle back with the same report of failure. Buck and Red met on the  street near the door and each looked questioningly at the other. Each  shook his head and looked around, their fingers toying absentmindedly at  their belts. Finally Buck cleared his throat and remarked casually,    \"Mebby he's following 'em.\"    Red nodded and they went over toward their horses. As they were  hesitating which route to take, Billy Jordan came up.    \"Mebby yu'd like to see yore pardner--he's out by Buzzard's Spring. We'll  take care of him,\" jerking his thumb over his shoulder toward the saloon  where Harris's body lay. \"And we'll all git th' others later. They  cain't git away for long.\"    Buck and Red nodded and headed for Buzzard's Spring. As they neared the  water hole they saw Hopalong sitting on a rock, his head resting in one  hand while the other hung loosely from his knee. He did not notice  them when they arrived, and with a ready tact they sat quietly on their  horses and looked in every direction except toward him. The sun became  a ball of molten fire and the sand flies annoyed them incessantly, but  still they sat and waited, silent and apologetic.    Hopalong finally arose, reached for his sombrero, and, finding it gone,  swore long and earnestly at the scene its loss brought before him. He  walked over to his horse and, leaping into the saddle, turned and faced  his friends. \"Yu old sons-of-guns,\" he said. They looked sheepish and  nodded negatively in answer to the look of inquiry in his eyes. \"They  ain't got 'em yet,\" remarked Red slowly. Hopalong straightened up, his  eyes narrowed and his face became hard and resolute as he led the way  back toward the town.    Buck rode up beside him and, wiping his face with his shirt sleeve,  began to speak to Red. \"We might look up th' Joneses, Red. They had been  dodgin' th' sheriff purty lively lately, an' they was huntin' Hopalong.  Ever since we had to kill their brother in Buckskin they has been  yappin' as how they was goin' to wipe us out. Hopalong an' Harris was  standin' clost together an' they tried for both. They shot twice, one  for Harris an' one for Hopalong, an' what more do yu want?\"    \"It shore looks thataway, Buck,\" replied Red, biting into a huge plug of  tobacco which he produced from his chaps. \"Anyhow, they wouldn't be no  loss if they didn't. Member what Pie said?\"    Hopalong looked straight ahead, and when he spoke the words sounded as  though he had bitten them off: \"Yore right, Buck, but I gits first try  at Thirsty. He's my meat an' I'll plug th' fellow what says he ain't.  Damn him!\"    The others replied by applying their spurs, and in a short time they  dismounted before the Nugget and Rope. Thirsty wouldn't have a chance to  not care how he dealt the cards.    Buck and Red moved quickly through the crowd, speaking fast and  earnestly. When they returned to where they had left their friend they  saw him half a block away and they followed slowly, one on either side  of the street. There would be no bullets in his back if they knew what  they were about, and they usually did.    As Hopalong neared the corner, Thirsty and his two brothers turned it  and saw him. Thirsty said something in a low voice, and the other two  walked across the street and disappeared behind the store. When assured  that they were secure, Thirsty walked up to a huge boulder on the side  of the street farthest from the store and turned and faced his enemy,  who approached rapidly until about five paces away, when he slowed up  and finally stopped.    For a number of seconds they sized each other up, Hopalong quiet  and deliberate with a deadly hatred; Thirsty pale and furtive with a  sensation hitherto unknown to him. It was Right meeting Wrong, and Wrong  lost confidence. Often had Thirsty Jones looked death in the face and  laughed, but there was something in Hopalong's eyes that made his flesh  creep.    He glanced quickly past his foe and took in the scene with one flash of  his eyes. There was the crowd, eager, expectant, scowling. There were  Buck and Red, each lounging against a boulder, Buck on his right, Red  on his left. Before him stood the only man he had ever feared. Hopalong  shifted his feet and Thirsty, coming to himself with a start, smiled.  His nerve had been shaken, but he was master of himself once more.    \"Well!\" he snarled, scowling.    Hopalong made no response, but stared him in the eyes.    Thirsty expected action, and the deadly quiet of his enemy oppressed  him. He stared in turn, but the insistent searching of his opponent's  eyes scorched him and he shifted his gaze to Hopalong's neck.    \"Well!\" he repeated uneasily.    \"Did yu have a nice time at th' dance last night?\" Asked Hopalong, still  searching the face before him.    \"Was there a dance? I was over in Alameda,\" replied Thirsty shortly.    \"Ya-as, there was a dance, an' yu can shoot purty durn far if yu was in  Alameda,\" responded Hopalong, his voice low and monotonous.    Thirsty shifted his feet and glanced around. Buck and Red were still  lounging against their bowlders and apparently were not paying any"]]]
