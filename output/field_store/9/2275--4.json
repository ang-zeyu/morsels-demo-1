I fear  we must ask you to hand it to us with still more breezy frankness.  Do you speak from purely friendly motives? Are you advising us to  discontinue the articles merely because you fear that they will  damage our literary reputation? Or are there other reasons why you  feel that they should cease? Do you speak solely as a literary  connoisseur? Is it the style or the subject-matter of which you  disapprove?\"    Mr. Parker leaned forward.    \"The gentleman whom I represent--\"    \"Then this is no matter of your own personal taste? You are an  emissary?\"    \"These articles are causing a certain inconvenience to the  gentleman whom I represent. Or, rather, he feels that, if  continued, they may do so.\"    \"You mean,\" broke in Billy explosively, \"that if we kick up enough  fuss to make somebody start a commission to inquire into this  rotten business, your friend who owns the private Hades we're  trying to get improved, will have to get busy and lose some of his  money by making the houses fit to live in? Is that it?\"    \"It is not so much the money, Mr. Windsor, though, of course, the  expense would be considerable. My employer is a wealthy man.\"    \"I bet he is,\" said Billy disgustedly. \"I've no doubt he makes a  mighty good pile out of Pleasant Street.\"    \"It is not so much the money,\" repeated Mr. Parker, \"as the  publicity involved. I speak quite frankly. There are reasons why my  employer would prefer not to come before the public just now as the  owner of the Pleasant Street property. I need not go into those  reasons. It is sufficient to say that they are strong ones.\"    \"Well, he knows what to do, I guess. The moment he starts in to  make those houses decent, the articles stop. It's up to him.\"    Psmith nodded.    \"Comrade Windsor is correct. He has hit the mark and rung the bell.  No conscientious judge would withhold from Comrade Windsor a cigar  or a cocoanut, according as his private preference might dictate.  That is the matter in a nutshell. Remove the reason for those very  scholarly articles, and they cease.\"    Mr. Parker shook his head.    \"I fear that is not feasible. The expense of reconstructing the  houses makes that impossible.\"    \"Then there's no use in talking,\" said Billy. \"The articles will  go on.\"    Mr. Parker coughed. A tentative cough, suggesting that the  situation was now about to enter upon a more delicate phase. Billy  and Psmith waited for him to begin. From their point of view the  discussion was over. If it was to be reopened on fresh lines, it  was for their visitor to effect that reopening.    \"Now, I'm going to be frank, gentlemen,\" said he, as who should  say, \"We are all friends here. Let us be hearty.\" \"I'm going to put  my cards on the table, and see if we can't fix something up. Now,  see here: We don't want unpleasantness. You aren't in this business  for your healths, eh? You've got your living to make, just like  everybody else, I guess. Well, see here. This is how it stands. To  a certain extant, I don't mind admitting, seeing that we're being  frank with one another, you two gentlemen have got us--that's to  say, my employer--in a cleft stick. Frankly, those articles are  beginning to attract attention, and if they go on there's going to  be a lot of inconvenience for my employer. That's clear, I reckon.  Well, now, here's a square proposition. How much do you want to  stop those articles? That's straight. I've been frank with you,  and I want you to be frank with me. What's your figure? Name it,  and, if it's not too high, I guess we needn't quarrel.\"    He looked expectantly at Billy. Billy's eyes were bulging. He  struggled for speech. He had got as far as \"Say!\" when Psmith  interrupted him. Psmith, gazing sadly at Mr. Parker through his  monocle, spoke quietly, with the restrained dignity of some old  Roman senator dealing with the enemies of the Republic.    \"Comrade Parker,\" he said, \"I fear that you have allowed constant  communication with the conscienceless commercialism of this worldly  city to undermine your moral sense. It is useless to dangle rich  bribes before our eyes. _Cosy Moments_ cannot be muzzled. You  doubtless mean well, according to your--if I may say so--somewhat  murky lights, but we are not for sale, except at ten cents weekly.  From the hills of Maine to the Everglades of Florida, from Sandy  Hook to San Francisco, from Portland, Oregon, to Melonsquashville,  Tennessee, one sentence is in every man's mouth. And what is that  sentence? I give you three guesses. You give it up? It is this:  '_Cosy Moments_ cannot be muzzled!'\"    Mr. Parker rose.    \"There's nothing more to be done then,\" he said.    \"Nothing,\" agreed Psmith, \"except to make a noise like a hoop and  roll away.\"    \"And do it quick,\" yelled Billy, exploding like a fire-cracker.    Psmith bowed.    \"Speed,\" he admitted, \"would be no bad thing. Frankly--if I may  borrow the expression--your square proposition has wounded us. I am  a man of powerful self-restraint, one of those strong, silent men,  and I can curb my emotions. But I fear that Comrade Windsor's  generous temperament may at any moment prompt him to start throwing  ink-pots. And in Wyoming his deadly aim with the ink-pot won him  among the admiring cowboys the sobriquet of Crack-Shot Cuthbert. As  man to man, Comrade Parker, I should advise you to bound swiftly  away.\"    \"I'm going,\" said Mr. Parker, picking up his hat. \"And I'll give  you a piece of advice, too. Those articles are going to be stopped,  and if you've any sense between you, you'll stop them yourselves  before you get hurt. That's all I've got to say, and that goes.\"    He went out, closing the door behind him with a bang that added  emphasis to his words.    \"To men of nicely poised nervous organisation such as ourselves,  Comrade Windsor,\" said Psmith, smoothing his waistcoat thoughtfully,  \"these scenes are acutely painful. We wince before them. Our  ganglions quiver like cinematographs. Gradually recovering command  of ourselves, we review the situation. Did our visitor's final  remarks convey anything definite to you? Were they the mere casual  badinage of a parting guest, or was there something solid behind  them?\"    Billy Windsor was looking serious.    \"I guess he meant it all right. He's evidently working for somebody  pretty big, and that sort of man would have a pull with all kinds  of Thugs. We shall have to watch out. Now that they find we can't  be bought, they'll try the other way. They mean business sure  enough. But, by George, let 'em! We're up against a big thing, and  I'm going to see it through if they put every gang in New York on  to us.\"    \"Precisely, Comrade Windsor. _Cosy Moments_, as I have had occasion  to observe before, cannot be muzzled.\"    \"That's right,\" said Billy Windsor. \"And,\" he added, with the  contented look the Far West editor must have worn as the bullet  came through the window, \"we must have got them scared, or they  wouldn't have shown their hand that way. I guess we're making a  hit. _Cosy Moments_ is going some now.\"        CHAPTER XI    THE MAN AT THE ASTOR    The duties of Master Pugsy Maloney at the offices of _Cosy Moments_  were not heavy; and he was accustomed to occupy his large store of  leisure by reading narratives dealing with life in the prairies,  which he acquired at a neighbouring shop at cut rates in  consideration of their being shop-soiled. It was while he was  engrossed in one of these, on the morning following the visit of  Mr. Parker, that the seedy-looking man made his appearance. He  walked in from the street, and stood before Master Maloney.    \"Hey, kid,\" he said.    Pugsy looked up with some hauteur. He resented being addressed as  \"kid\" by perfect strangers.    \"Editor in, Tommy?\" inquired the man.    Pugsy by this time had taken a thorough dislike to him. To be  called \"kid\" was bad. The subtle insult of \"Tommy\" was still worse.    \"Nope,\" he said curtly, fixing his eyes again on his book. A  movement on the part of the visitor attracted his attention. The  seedy man was making for the door of the inner room. Pugsy  instantly ceased to be the student and became the man of action. He  sprang from his seat and wriggled in between the man and the door.    \"Youse can't butt in dere,\" he said authoritatively. \"Chase  yerself.\"    The man eyed him with displeasure.    \"Fresh kid!\" he observed disapprovingly.    \"Fade away,\" urged Master Maloney.    The visitor's reply was to extend a hand and grasp Pugsy's left ear  between a long finger and thumb. Since time began, small boys in  every country have had but one answer for this action. Pugsy made  it. He emitted a piercing squeal in which pain, fear, and  resentment strove for supremacy.    The noise penetrated into the editorial sanctum, losing only a  small part of its strength on the way. Psmith, who was at work on  a review of a book of poetry, looked up with patient sadness.    \"If Comrade Maloney,\" he said, \"is going to take to singing as well  as whistling, I fear this journal must put up its shutters.  Concentrated thought will be out of the question.\"    A second squeal rent the air. Billy Windsor jumped up.    \"Somebody must be hurting the kid,\" he exclaimed.    He hurried to the door and flung it open. Psmith followed at a more  leisurely pace. The seedy man, caught in the act, released Master  Maloney, who stood rubbing his ear with resentment written on every  feature.    On such occasions as this Billy was a man of few words. He made a  dive for the seedy man; but the latter, who during the preceding  moment had been eyeing the two editors as if he were committing  their appearance to memory, sprang back, and was off down the  stairs with the agility of a Marathon runner.    \"He blows in,\" said Master Maloney, aggrieved, \"and asks is de  editor dere. I tells him no, 'cos youse said youse wasn't, and he  nips me by the ear when I gets busy to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26076"],[0,"Birds from Coahuila, Mexico (#10)"],[1," black bars are wider than the white. The specimen is in  worn plumage, but nevertheless suggests intergradation with _D. s.  symplectus_.    _Platypsaris aglaiae albiventris_ (Lawrence).--The Rose-throated  Becard, if it occurs in Coahuila at all, is rare in the State. Without  giving any specific locality, Sclater (1857:74) described  _Pachyrhamphus aglaiae_ from Coahuila. Hellmayr (1929:202) considered  Sclater's record as representing _Platypsaris aglaiae albiventris_  (Lawrence).    *_Tyrannus vociferans vociferans_ (Swainson).--_Specimens examined:_  total 2: [Male] 32064 from 7 mi. S, 4 mi. E Bella Union, 7200 ft., June  24, 1952; and [Female] 31650 from the north foot of Sierra Guadalupe  (=10 mi. S, 5 mi. W General Cepeda), 6400 ft., April 15, 1953.    The small number of records of Cassin's Kingbird in Coahuila is  surprising, for I would expect the species in most areas of the State  between 6000 and 7000 feet. All Coahuilan records are from the  southeastern part of the State. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:193) found it  \"on infrequent occasions in the arid country near Saltillo.\" Miller,  Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:71) reported that _T. v.  vociferans_ nested in Coahuila on July 7. The size of the testes (15x7  mm.) of our specimen from near Bella Union also indicates breeding.    **_Muscivora forficata_ (Gmelin).--_Specimen examined:_ one, [Female]  32063, from 12 mi. N, 12 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft., June 19, 1952.    The status of the Scissor-tailed Flycatcher in Coahuila is uncertain.  Although the condition of the gonads of No. 32063 was not recorded by  the collector, the late date (June 19) on which is was obtained  suggests that this female was a resident in northeastern Coahuila.  Findley saw a Scissor-tailed Flycatcher 2 mi. S and 11 mi. E Nava, 810  feet, on June 15, 1952. Dickerman saw one 4 mi. N San Isidro on May 10,  1954. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:69) recorded this  flycatcher from Sabinas on April 12. No other records of _Muscivora  forficata_ in Coahuila have come to my attention, but the species  probably occurs in the State in migration.    *_Myiarchus crinitus crinitus_ (Linnaeus).--_Specimens examined:_ total  3: [Female] 32065 from 12 mi. N, 12 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft., June 19,  1952; and [Male] 32066 and [Female] 32067 from 2 mi. W Jimenez, 850  ft., June 20, 1952.    The Great Crested Flycatcher seems to be rare in Coahuila. Nos.  32065-32067 are the first specimens that I know of from Coahuila. Bangs  (1898:179-180) said that the subspecies _crinitus_ has an \"enormous  swollen bill\" (exposed culmen of male, 20 mm.; breadth of bill at  middle of nostril, 10.3 mm.) whereas _M. c. boreus_ has a \"small  slender bill\" (exposed culmen of male, 18.6 mm.; breadth of bill at  middle of nostril, 8.6 mm.). No. 32066 has a large bill (exposed  culmen, 21 mm.; breadth of bill at middle of nostril, 10 mm.). Bangs  (_loc. cit._) did not give any measurements for females of _M. c.  crinitus_ or _boreus_. Nevertheless, I suspect that Nos. 32065 and  32067 represent _crinitus_ (No. 32065: exposed culmen, 19 mm.; breadth  of bill at middle of nostril, 9 mm.; No. 32067: exposed culmen, 20 mm.;  breadth of bill at middle of nostril, 9.5 mm.). The size of the testes  (9 mm. long) of No. 32066 and the dates (June 19 and 20) on which the  specimens were collected indicate breeding by this species in the  State.    *_Myiarchus tyrannulus cooperi_ Baird.--_Specimens examined:_ total 2:  [Male] 32068 and [Female] 32069 from 2 mi. S, 3 mi. E San Juan de  Sabinas, 1160 ft., June 22, 1952, measurements: wing, 102, 97 mm.;  tail, 93, 90 mm.    Wied's Crested Flycatcher is not common in Coahuila. Eastern Coahuila  represents the eastern limit of the range of _M. t. cooperi_.  Measurements of our specimens agree well with the average measurements  of typical _M. t. cooperi_. According to Ridgway (1907:621), _M. t.  cooperi_ (then called _Myiarchus mexicanus mexicanus_) has been  recorded from Sabinas. The size of the testes (14x7 mm.) of No. 32068  and the date (June 22) on which the specimens were collected indicate  breeding by this species in the State.    *_Myiarchus cinerascens cinerascens_ (Lawrence).--_Specimens examined:_  total 7: [Female] 31045 from 15 mi. SE Boquillas, 1500 ft., March 16,  1952; [Male] 32070 from 12 mi. N, 12 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft., June 19,  1952; [Female] 32071 from 2 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft., June 20, 1952;  [Male] 35413 from 6 mi. N, 2 mi. W Castillon, 3750 ft., June 30, 1953;  [Male] 32072 from 9 mi. S, 11 mi. E Sabinas, June 14, 1952; [Female]  31584 from 17 mi. S Ocampo, 5300 ft., April 7, 1954; and [Male] 31673  from the west foot of Pico de Jimulco, 5000 ft., April 4, 1953.    The Ash-throated Flycatcher is common in Coahuila. All specimens  examined by me from there are typical of _M. c. cinerascens_. Ridgway  (1907:626) listed _M. c. cinerascens_ from Monclovia (=Monclova?) and  Sabinas. Miller (1955a:166) found the species \"only in the oak belt at  5000 feet, where it was common.\" Burleigh and Lowery (1942:193)  recorded _M. c. cinerascens_ from \"near Saltillo.\" Dickerman obtained  No. 31584 in a mesquite-grassland-shrubby area. Miller, Friedmann,  Griscom, and Moore (1957:78) stated that _M. c. cinerascens_ breeds in  Coahuila.    _Sayornis phoebe_ (Latham).--Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore  (1957:66) recorded the Eastern Phoebe from Coahuila on November 4-14.    *_Sayornis nigricans semiatra_ (Vigors).--_Specimens examined:_ total  2: [Female] 31046 from 1 mi. N Boquillas, 700 ft., March 7, 1952; and  [Female] 31047 from Fortin (=33 mi. N, 8 mi. W San Geronimo), 3300 ft.,  March 27, 1952.    Of the Black Phoebe, the two subspecies _semiatra_ and _nigricans_  intergrade in Coahuila. Typical representatives of _S. n. semiatra_ are  present in northern Coahuila. The under tail coverts of Nos.  31046-31047 are immaculate and white. Miller (1955:167) noted the two  specimens collected from the Sierra del Carmen to have narrow dark  shaft streaks on the under tail coverts. He (_loc. cit._) remarked also  that \"the marking of the under tail coverts may indicate a beginning of  a gradient in increased darkening of these feathers toward _S. n.  nigricans_ in southern Coahuila.\"    *_Sayornis nigricans nigricans_ (Swainson).--Burleigh and Lowery  (1942:193) collected several specimens of _S. n. nigricans_ \"on the  outskirts of Saltillo\" and saw a pair at the Chorro del Agua on April  19.    *_Sayornis saya saya_ (Bonaparte).--_Specimens examined:_ total 4:  [Female] 31049 from the Rio Grande (=17 mi. S Dryden, Terrell Co.,  Texas, in Coahuila), 600 ft., March 18, 1952; sex ? 31048 from 10 mi. S,  5 mi. E Boquillas, 1500 ft., March 4, 1952; [Male] 31050 from Fortin  (=33 mi. N, 8 mi. W San Geronimo), 3300 ft., March 29, 1952; and  [Female] 32059 from 7 mi. S, 4 mi. E Bella Union, 7200 ft., June 25,  1952.    Say's Phoebe occurs commonly in Coahuila. Miller (1955a:167) obtained a  female with an active brood patch in Boquillas Canyon of the Sierra del  Carmen, and remarked that Marsh took a juvenile on September 2 at El  Rincon. Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:33) saw this phoebe several times in  southern Coahuila and obtained a male \"near San Pedro\" on January 29.  Burleigh and Lowery (1942:193) recorded this species as \"a common  breeding bird both on Diamante Pass and on the arid plateau around  Saltillo.\" No. 32059 was a juvenile.    _Empidonax traillii brewsteri_ Oberholser.--Amadon and Phillips  (1947:578) look a Traill Flycatcher of the subspecies _brewsteri_ at  Las Delicias on August 11.    _Empidonax minimus_ (Baird and Baird).--_Specimen examined:_ one,  [Male] 31470, from Sierra del Pino (=5 mi. S, 3 mi. W Acebuches), 6200  ft., May 13, 1954.    Amadon and Phillips (1947:578) obtained two Least Flycatchers at Las  Delicias on August 12. Dickerman took No. 31470 in pine-oak vegetation.    _Empidonax hammondii_ (Xantus).--_Specimen examined:_ one, sex ? 31657,  from the north slope of Sierra Guadalupe (=11 mi. S, 7 mi. W General  Cepeda), 7800 ft., April 20, 1953.    No. 31657 is similar to _E. wrightii_ (Wright's Flycatcher); however,  the outmost (tenth) primary is equal to or slightly larger than the  fifth primary. Yet, the underparts of No. 31657 are darker and more  uniform in coloration than those of typical representatives of _E.  wrightii_. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:88) stated that  Hammond's Flycatcher is \"transient\" in Coahuila. Burleigh and Lowery  (1942:193-194) reported that _E. hammondii_ was the most prevalent of  the small flycatchers in southeastern Coahuila. They (_loc. cit._)  obtained specimens of this flycatcher from the Chorro del Agua and  Diamante Pass. Miller (1955a:167) characterized _E. hammondii_ as a  common migrant, \"chiefly in stands of low oaks in the pine-oak belt but  also occasionally in the desert scrub\" of the Sierra del Carmen.    _Empidonax wrightii_ Baird.--Amadon and Phillips (1947:578) reported  one Wright's Flycatcher from Las Delicias. Miller (1955a:167) stated  that this species was a common migrant and occurred chiefly in the  lower oak belt and in the desert scrub. Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:34)  obtained specimens of _E. wrightii_ from San Pedro on January 29.    _Empidonax griseus_ Brewster.--Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:34) noted  that the Gray Flycatcher was common \"in the San Pedro region\" and  collected two at San Pedro on January 29. Burleigh and Lowery  (1942:194) collected specimens \"near the Chorro del Agua, at Saltillo,  and ... in the open desert some twenty miles west of Saltillo.\"    **_Empidonax affinis trepidus_ Nelson.--_Specimen examined:_ one,  [Male] 32750, from 13 mi. E San Antonio de las Alazanas, 9950 ft., July  6, 1955.    Ridgway (1907:576) previously reported the little known and poorly  defined Pine Flycatcher from Sierra Guadalupe. Because of its small  size (wing, 75 mm.; tail, 65 mm.), No. 32750 is referable to _E. a.  trepidus_. No indication of"]]]
