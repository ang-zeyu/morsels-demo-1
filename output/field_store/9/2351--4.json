Began  then the siege of Namur. Namur, being the second fortress hope of the  Allies--the pivot upon which General Joffre had planned to swing his  army into Belgium in a sweeping attack upon the advancing Germans--a  brief survey of the city and fortifications will be necessary. The  situation of the city is not as imposing as that of Liege. For the most  part it sits on a hillside declivity, to rest in the angle formed by the  junction of the Sambre and Meuse. It is a place of some historic and  industrial importance, though in the latter respect not so well known as  Liege. To the west, however, up the valley of the Sambre, the country  presents the usual features of a mining region--pit shafts, tall  chimneys issuing clouds of black smoke, and huge piles of unsightly  debris. While away to the north stretches the great plain of Central  Belgium, southward the Central Meuse offers a more picturesque prospect  in wooded slopes rising to view-commanding hilltops. Directly east, the  Meuse flows into the precipitous cut on its way to Liege.    But in Belgian eyes the fame of Namur lay to a great extent in its being  the second of Brialmont's fortress masterpieces. Its plan was that of  Liege--a ring of outer detached forts, constructed on the same  armor-clad cupola principle. At Namur these were nine in number, four  major forts and five _fortins_. The distance between each fort was on  the average two and a half miles, with between two and a half to five  miles from the city as the center of the circumference.    Facing Von Buelow's advance, fort Cognelee protected the Brussels  railway, while the guns of Marchovelette swept the space between it and  the left bank of the Meuse. In the southwest angle formed by the Meuse,  forts Maizeret, Andoy and Dave continued the ring. Again in the angle of  the Sambre and Meuse forts St. Heribert and Malonne protected the city.  North of the Sambre, forts Suarlee and Emines completed the circle.    In the emergency Namur possessed one advantage over Liege. The  resistance of Liege gave Namur due warning of the German invasion, and  some days to prepare for attack. General Michel was in command of the  garrison of Namur, which comprised from 25,000 to 30,000 men. Doubtless  reports had come to him of the situation at Liege. He immediately set to  work to overcome the cause of the failure of Brialmont's plan at Liege,  by constructing trenches between the forts, protected by barbed wire  entanglements, and mines in advance of the German approach. As his  circumference of defense was less than that of Liege, his force promised  to be capable of a more prolonged resistance.    Besides the Allies were close at hand. Only eighteen miles separated  him from strong detachments of French infantry and artillery at Dinant.  As we have seen French cavalry had been thrown forward as far as  Gembloux on the road to Brussels, but ten miles to the northeast of  Namur. Somewhere between that place and Charleroi French Chasseurs  d'Afrique had advanced to occupy outpost positions. His position  appeared by no means hopeless--considerably better than the unsupported  field army at Liege. The armor of his forts was calculated to withstand  the 36-lb. shells of the heaviest German fieldpieces, but comparatively  slight damage was anticipated from the known heavier howitzers. If the  Germans purposed to assault Namur in mass formation, as they had done at  Liege, General Michel had every reason to feel confident he could  repulse them with tremendous losses.    But the Germans had learned a severely taught lesson at Liege. They had  no intention of repeating those tactics. Behind a remarkable screen of  secrecy, they managed to conceal from General Michel--as they did from  the Allies--the existence of their enormous siege guns. Whether they  brought into action at Namur their famous 42-centimeters, capable of  throwing a shell of high explosive power weighing 2,500 lbs., is  uncertain. In fact, it is still doubtful where they were first fired at  the allied enemy. Two are said to have assisted in the final destruction  of the northern forts of Liege, and two were seen rolling over the field  of Waterloo. The Germans remained silent upon the subject, and nothing  definite about their first discharge was disclosed. But unquestionably  their fire was capable of demolishing into ruin any fort on earth within  a short period. It is certain, however, the Germans brought against  Namur their 28-centimeter guns, and probably some of 21-centimeter  caliber. These artillery weapons were quite formidable enough to reduce  the Namur forts. The former threw a shell of 750 pounds from a range of  three miles--beyond the reach of the Namur guns. The latter projected  shells of 250 pounds. The Germans are said to have employed thirty-two  of the heavier caliber guns, and a large number of 21-centimeter.    Thus Namur was doomed before the bombardment commenced. Von Buelow's  left wing advanced up the Meuse north bank from Huy, some part of it  crossing to the south bank at Ardenne, where it came in touch with the  Saxon army.    At sundown of August 20, 1914, Von Buelow was in position before Namur,  three miles from its defenses. Darkness fell upon a hot and sultry  August atmosphere. Presently the flashes and boom of the German guns  began a bombardment of the trenches between forts Cognelee and  Marchovelette. It continued through the night. But the Belgian fortress  guns were outranged. It would have been a mere waste of ammunition to  reply. Neither could the Belgian infantry venture on a counterattack,  for the Germans were clearly observed in overwhelming strength. At the  outset the Germans devoted their efforts to clearing the trenches of the  Belgian infantry, leaving the forts for subsequent demolition. The  unfortunate Belgian infantry, therefore, could do nothing but fire  intermittent rifle volleys, without any effect upon the Germans. They  bravely bore this storm of shells for ten hours. Not a man who lifted  his head above the German machine gun-swept parapets but was not  instantly killed or wounded. Thus the majority of the officers were  killed, and the ranks within the trenches decimated.    Toward morning on August 21, 1914, the Belgians could stand the tornado  of death no longer. The demoralized troops fled from the trenches,  leaving the gap between forts Cognelee and Marchovelette open. The  Germans then opened fire on the forts. In comparison with the new German  siege howitzers, the old-fashioned Belgian guns proved to be weak  weapons. The tremendous pounding of the German shells not only smashed  the fort cupolas, and crumpled into ruin the interior stone and steel  protective armor, but quickly put the Belgian guns out of action. Thus  while fort Maizeret received some 1,200 German shells at the speed of  twenty to the minute, it was able to reply with only ten shots. Forts  Marchovelette and Maizeret were the first to fall. Seventy-five men of  the Marchovelette garrison were found dead amid its ruins--nearly its  total complement.    [Illustration: French Invasion of Alsace-lorraine.]    Early on Friday morning of August 21, 1914, forts Andoy, Dave, St.  Heribert and Malonne were subjected to a similar furious bombardment.  After three hours of the cannonade Andoy, Dave and St. Heribert  surrendered. During the morning the Germans thrust a force into the  southern angle of the Sambre and Meuse. Here the Belgian infantry  offered a vigorous resistance. It was hoped that the French at Dinant  would hasten to their relief. But Dinant was for the second time within  a few days the scene of conflict. Some 6,000 French Turcos and artillery  did arrive, but too late to be of use in helping to save Namur. Shells  now began to drop in the city while aeroplanes flung down bombs. A  thunderstorm rumbled in combination with the continuous roar of the  German guns. A panic took hold of the citizens. Distracted men, women  and children huddled together in spellbound terror, or sought the  shelter of their cellars. The more superstitious pronounced this to be  the end of all things, from the eclipse of the sun which darkened the  sky. Fort Malonne succumbed sometime during the afternoon of August 21,  1914.    As at Liege, with General Leman, so in Namur General Michel foresaw the  city and forts' fate was imminent. Only the northwest forts Suarlee,  Emines and Cognelee held out. The Belgians and French had been defeated  by the Germans in the angle of the Sambre and Meuse. The horizon  revealed no sign of a French army advancing. General Michel, therefore,  decided upon the evacuation of the city by the Belgian infantry. It was  successfully accomplished, though even more in the nature of a flight  than at Liege. But General Michel went with them, instead of remaining,  like General Leman, to fight the defense of his fortress to the last.    The retreating Belgians on August 22, 1914, had some adventurous  wandering before them. They had first to cut their way through a body of  German troops, then to become involved with a French force near  Charleroi. It took them seven days to reach Rouen by way of Amiens.  There they were embarked for sea transport to Ostend. At Ostend, they  joined the main Belgian army after its retreat from Antwerp.    On Sunday morning, August 23, 1914, the Germans began the bombardment of  Fort Suarlee. This fort repeated the heroic resistance of Fort  Boncelles at Liege. It held out until the afternoon of August 25. It was  apparently then blown up by the explosion of its own magazine, thus  again repeating the end of Fort Loncin at Liege. Meantime the Germans  had succeeded in reducing Forts Cognelee and Emines.    The Germans entered Namur on the afternoon of August 23, 1914.
