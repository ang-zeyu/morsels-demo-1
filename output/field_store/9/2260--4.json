Amid such a world, if  anywhere, our ideals henceforward must find a home. That Man is the  product of causes which had no prevision of the end they were  achieving; that his origin, his growth, his hopes and fears, his loves  and his beliefs, are but the outcome of accidental collocations of  atoms; that no fire, no heroism, no intensity of thought and feeling,  can preserve an individual life beyond the grave; that all the labours  of the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration, all the noonday  brightness of human genius, are destined to extinction in the vast  death of the solar system, and that the whole temple of Man's  achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the d√©bris of a universe  in ruins--all these things, if not quite beyond dispute, are yet so  nearly certain, that no philosophy which rejects them can hope to  stand. Only within the scaffolding of these truths, only on the firm  foundation of unyielding despair, can the soul's habitation henceforth  be safely built.    How, in such an alien and inhuman world, can so powerless a creature  as Man preserve his aspirations untarnished? A strange mystery it is  that Nature, omnipotent but blind, in the revolutions of her secular  hurryings through the abysses of space, has brought forth at last a  child, subject still to her power, but gifted with sight, with  knowledge of good and evil, with the capacity of judging all the works  of his unthinking Mother. In spite of Death, the mark and seal of the  parental control, Man is yet free, during his brief years, to examine,  to criticise, to know, and in imagination to create. To him alone, in  the world with which he is acquainted, this freedom belongs; and in  this lies his superiority to the resistless forces that control his  outward life.    The savage, like ourselves, feels the oppression of his impotence  before the powers of Nature; but having in himself nothing that he  respects more than Power, he is willing to prostrate himself before  his gods, without inquiring whether they are worthy of his worship.  Pathetic and very terrible is the long history of cruelty and torture,  of degradation and human sacrifice, endured in the hope of placating  the jealous gods: surely, the trembling believer thinks, when what is  most precious has been freely given, their lust for blood must be  appeased, and more will not be required. The religion of Moloch--as  such creeds may be generically called--is in essence the cringing  submission of the slave, who dare not, even in his heart, allow the  thought that his master deserves no adulation. Since the independence  of ideals is not yet acknowledged, Power may be freely worshipped, and  receive an unlimited respect, despite its wanton infliction of pain.    But gradually, as morality grows bolder, the claim of the ideal world  begins to be felt; and worship, if it is not to cease, must be given  to gods of another kind than those created by the savage. Some, though  they feel the demands of the ideal, will still consciously reject  them, still urging that naked Power is worthy of worship. Such is the  attitude inculcated in God's answer to Job out of the whirlwind: the  divine power and knowledge are paraded, but of the divine goodness  there is no hint. Such also is the attitude of those who, in our own  day, base their morality upon the struggle for survival, maintaining  that the survivors are necessarily the fittest. But others, not  content with an answer so repugnant to the moral sense, will adopt the  position which we have become accustomed to regard as specially  religious, maintaining that, in some hidden manner, the world of fact  is really harmonious with the world of ideals. Thus Man creates God,  all-powerful and all-good, the mystic unity of what is and what should  be.    But the world of fact, after all, is not good; and, in submitting our  judgment to it, there is an element of slavishness from which our  thoughts must be purged. For in all things it is well to exalt the  dignity of Man, by freeing him as far as possible from the tyranny of  non-human Power. When we have realised that Power is largely bad, that  man, with his knowledge of good and evil, is but a helpless atom in a  world which has no such knowledge, the choice is again presented to  us: Shall we worship Force, or shall we worship Goodness? Shall our  God exist and be evil, or shall he be recognised as the creation of  our own conscience?    The answer to this question is very momentous, and affects profoundly  our whole morality. The worship of Force, to which Carlyle and  Nietzsche and the creed of Militarism have accustomed us, is the  result of failure to maintain our own ideals against a hostile  universe: it is itself a prostrate submission to evil, a sacrifice of  our best to Moloch. If strength indeed is to be respected, let us  respect rather the strength of those who refuse that false  \"recognition of facts\" which fails to recognise that facts are often  bad. Let us admit that, in the world we know, there are many things  that would be better otherwise, and that the ideals to which we do and  must adhere are not realised in the realm of matter. Let us preserve  our respect for truth, for beauty, for the ideal of perfection which  life does not permit us to attain, though none of these things meet  with the approval of the unconscious universe. If Power is bad, as it  seems to be, let us reject it from our hearts. In this lies Man's true  freedom: in determination to worship only the God created by our own  love of the good, to respect only the heaven which inspires the  insight of our best moments. In action, in desire, we must submit  perpetually to the tyranny of outside forces; but in thought, in  aspiration, we are free, free from our fellow-men, free from the petty  planet on which our bodies impotently crawl, free even, while we live,  from the tyranny of death. Let us learn, then, that energy of faith  which enables us to live constantly in the vision of the good; and let  us descend, in action, into the world of fact, with that vision always  before us.    When first the opposition of fact and ideal grows fully visible, a  spirit of fiery revolt, of fierce hatred of the gods, seems necessary  to the assertion of freedom. To defy with Promethean constancy a  hostile universe, to keep its evil always in view, always actively  hated, to refuse no pain that the malice of Power can invent, appears  to be the duty of all who will not bow before the inevitable. But  indignation is still a bondage, for it compels our thoughts to be  occupied with an evil world; and in the fierceness of desire from  which rebellion springs there is a kind of self-assertion which it is  necessary for the wise to overcome. Indignation is a submission of our  thoughts, but not of our desires; the Stoic freedom in which wisdom  consists is found in the submission of our desires, but not of our  thoughts. From the submission of our desires springs the virtue of  resignation; from the freedom of our thoughts springs the whole world  of art and philosophy, and the vision of beauty by which, at last, we  half reconquer the reluctant world. But the vision of beauty is  possible only to unfettered contemplation, to thoughts not weighted by  the load of eager wishes; and thus Freedom comes only to those who no  longer ask of life that it shall yield them any of those personal  goods that are subject to the mutations of Time.    Although the necessity of renunciation is evidence of the existence of  evil, yet Christianity, in preaching it, has shown a wisdom exceeding  that of the Promethean philosophy of rebellion. It must be admitted  that, of the things we desire, some, though they prove impossible, are  yet real goods; others, however, as ardently longed for, do not form  part of a fully purified ideal. The belief that what must be renounced  is bad, though sometimes false, is far less often false than untamed  passion supposes; and the creed of religion, by providing a reason  for proving that it is never false, has been the means of purifying  our hopes by the discovery of many austere truths.    But there is in resignation a further good element: even real goods,  when they are unattainable, ought not to be fretfully desired. To  every man comes, sooner or later, the great renunciation. For the  young, there is nothing unattainable; a good thing desired with the  whole force of a passionate will, and yet impossible, is to them not  credible. Yet, by death, by illness, by poverty, or by the voice of  duty, we must learn, each one of us, that the world was not made for  us, and that, however beautiful may be the things we crave, Fate may  nevertheless forbid them. It is the part of courage, when misfortune  comes, to bear without repining the ruin of our hopes, to turn away  our thoughts from vain regrets. This degree of submission to Power is  not only just and right: it is the very gate of wisdom.    But passive renunciation is not the whole of wisdom; for not by  renunciation alone can we build a temple for the worship of our own  ideals. Haunting foreshadowings of the temple appear in the realm of  imagination, in music, in architecture, in the untroubled kingdom of  reason, and in the golden sunset magic of lyrics, where beauty shines  and glows, remote from the touch of sorrow, remote from the fear of  change, remote from the failures and disenchantments of the world of  fact. In the contemplation of these things the vision of heaven will  shape itself in our hearts, giving at once a touchstone to judge the  world about us, and an inspiration by which to fashion to our needs  whatever is not incapable of serving as a stone in the sacred"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25449"],[0,"The Young Castellan: A Tale of the English Civil War (#10)"],[1,"it, and I told him, to please him, that he  might clean up some of the big guns.\"    \"But you should not have done this, my dear.\"    \"No; I'll tell him not to, mother.  And I'd made an arrangement with him  to meet him every morning out in the primrose dell to practise  sword-cutting.  I was going to-morrow morning, but I won't go now.\"    Lady Royland pressed her lips to the boy's forehead, and smiled in his  face.    \"Thank you, my dear,\" she said, softly.  \"Recollect you are everything  to me now!  And I want your help and comfort now I am so terribly alone.  Master Pawson is profuse in his offers of assistance to relieve me of  the management here, but I want that assistance to come from my son.\"    \"Of course!\" said Roy, haughtily.  \"He's only the secretary, and if any  one is to take father's place, it ought to be me.\"    \"Yes; and you shall, Roy, my dear.  You are very young, but now this  trouble has come upon us, you must try to be a man and my counsellor so  that when your father returns--\"    She ceased speaking, and Roy pressed her hands encouragingly as he saw  her lips trembling and that she had turned ghastly white.    \"When your father returns,\" she said, now firmly, \"we must let him see  that we have managed everything well.\"    \"Then why not, as it's war time, let Ben do what he wanted, and we'll  put the place in a regular state of defence?\"    \"No, no, no, my dear,\" said Lady Royland, with a shudder.  \"Why should  you give our peaceful happy home even the faintest semblance of war,  when it can by no possibility come into this calm, quiet, retired nook.  No, my boy, not that, please.\"    \"Very well, mother.  Then I'll go riding round to see the tenants, and  look after the things at home just as you wish me to.  Will that do?\"    Lady Royland smiled, and then pressed her son's arm.    \"Go up now, then, to Master Pawson's room,\" she said; \"and recollect  that one of the things I wish you to do is to be more studious than you  would be if your father were at home.\"    Roy nodded and hurried up into the corridor, thinking to himself that  Master Pawson would not like his being so much in his mother's  confidence.    \"Then he'll have to dislike it.  He has been a bit too forward lately,  speaking to the servants as if he were master here.  I heard him quite  bully poor old Jenk one day.  But, of course, I don't want to quarrel  with him.\"    Roy ascended the staircase and entered the room, to find the secretary  bending over a big volume in the Greek character; and, as he looked up  smiling, the boy felt that his tutor was about the least  quarrelsome-looking personage he had ever seen.    \"Rather a long half-hour, Roy, is it not?\" he said.    \"Yes, sir; I'm very sorry.  My mother met me as I was coming across the  garden, and talked to me, and I could not leave her in such trouble.\"    \"Trouble?  Trouble?\" said the secretary, raising his eyebrows.    \"Of course, sir, about the bad news you told her this morning.\"    \"Indeed!  And did Lady Royland confide in you?\"    \"Why, of course!\" said Roy, quickly.    \"Oh, yes,--of course!  Her ladyship would do what is for the best.  Well, let us to our reading.  We have lost half an hour, and I am going  to make it a little shorter this morning, for I thought of going across  as far as the vicarage.\"    \"To see Master Meldew, sir?\"    \"Yes; of course.  He has not been here lately.  Now, then, where we left  off,--it was about the Punic War, was it not?\"    \"Yes, sir; but don't let's have anything about war this morning.\"    \"Very well,\" said the secretary; \"let it be something about peace.\"    It was something about peace, but what Roy did not know half an hour  later, for his head was in a whirl, and his reading became quite  mechanical.  For there was the trouble his mother was in, her wishes as  to his conduct, and his secret interview with Ben, to keep on buzzing in  his brain, so that it was with a sigh of relief that he heard the  secretary's command to close his book, and he gazed at him wonderingly,  asking himself whether the words were sarcastic, for Master Pawson  said--    \"I compliment you, Roy; you have done remarkably well, and been very  attentive this morning.  By the way, if her ladyship makes any remark  about my absence, you can say that you expect Master Meldew has asked me  to stay and partake of dinner with him.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Not unless she asks,\" continued the secretary.  \"In all probability she  will not notice my absence.\"    Roy descended with his books; then felt that he should like to be alone  and think, and to this end he made his way to the gloomy old guard-room  on the right of the great gate-way, ran up the winding stair, and soon  reached the roof, where he lay down on the breastwork over the  machicolations, and had not been there long before he heard steps, and,  looking over, saw Master Pawson cross the drawbridge and go out of the  farther gate-way, watching him unseen till he turned off by the pathway  leading through the village and entering the main road.    Then it occurred to Roy that, as he had an unpleasant communication to  make, he could not do better than get it over at once.  So he descended,  and began to search for the old soldier; but it was some time before he  could find him out.    Yet it seemed to be quite soon enough, for the old fellow looked very  grim and sour as he listened to the communication.    \"Very well, Master Roy,\" he said; \"the mistress is master now, and it's  your dooty to obey her; but it do seem like playing at fast and loose  with a man.  There, I've got no more to say,--only that I was beginning  to feel a bit bright and chirpy; but now I'm all going back'ard again,  and feel as rusty as everything else about the place.\"    \"I'm very sorry, Ben, for I really did want to learn,\" said Roy,  apologetically.    \"Yes, sir, I s'pose you did; and this here's a world o' trouble, and the  longer you lives in it the more you finds out as you can't do what you  like, so you grins and bears it; but the grinning's about the hardest  part o' the job.  You're 'bliged to bear it, but you aren't 'bliged to  grin; and, when the grins do come, you never has a looking-glass afore  you, but you allus feels as if you never looked so ugly afore in your  life.\"    \"But you'll have to help me in other things, Ben.\"    \"Shall I, sir?  Don't seem to me as there's anything else as I can help  you over.\"    \"Oh, but there is,--while the war keeps my father away.\"    \"War, sir?  Nonsense!  You don't call a bit of a riot got up by some  ragged Jacks war.\"    \"No; but this is getting to be a very serious affair, according to what  Master Pawson told my mother this morning.\"    \"Master Pawson, sir!  Why, what does he know about it?\"    \"A good deal, it seems.  Some friends of his in London send him news,  and they said it is going to be a terrible civil war.\"    \"And me not up there with Sir Granby!\" groaned the man.  \"Oh, dear! oh,  dear! it's a wicked, rusty old world!\"    \"But I've promised to help my mother all I can, Ben, and you must  promise to help me.\"    \"Of course, sir; that you know.  But say, sir, war breaking out, and we  all rusted up like this!  We ought to be ready for anything.\"    \"So I thought, Ben; but my mother says there's not likely to be trouble  in this out-of-the-way place.\"    \"Then bless my dear lady's innocence! says Ben Martlet, and that's me,  sir.  Why, you never knows where a spark may drop and the fire begin to  run.\"    \"No, Ben.\"    \"And if this is sure to be such a peaceful spot, why did the old  Roylands build the castle and make a moat and drawbridge, and all the  rest of it?  They didn't mean the moat for nothing else, sir, but carp,  tench, and eels.\"    \"And pike, Ben.\"    \"No, sir.  They thought of very different kind of pikes, sir, I can tell  you,--same as they I've got on the walls yonder in sheaves.  But there;  her ladyship gives the word to you, and you gives it to me, and I  shouldn't be worth calling a soldier if I didn't do as I was ordered,  and directly, too, and--Hark!\"    The old soldier held up his hand.    \"Horses!\" cried Roy, excitedly.  \"Why, who's coming here?\"        CHAPTER SEVEN.    NEWS FROM THE WAR.    Roy and the old soldier hurried to a slit which gave on the road, and  the latter began to breathe hard with excitement as his eyes rested upon  three dusty-looking horsemen, well-mounted, and from whose round-topped,  spiked steel caps the sun flashed from time to time.    \"Why, they're dragoons!\" cried the old fellow, excitedly.  \"Enemies,  perhaps, and we're without a drawbridge as'll pull up.  Here, quick,  take a sword, Master Roy.  Here's mine.  Let's make a show.  They won't  know but what there's dozens of us.\"    Roy followed the old soldier's commands, and, buckling on the sword,  hurried with him down to the outer gate, just as the venerable old  retainer slammed it to with a heavy, jarring sound, and challenged the  horsemen, whom he could hardly see, to halt.    \"Well done, old man!\" muttered Ben.  \"The right stuff, Master Roy,  though he is ninety-four.\"    \"What is it?\" cried Roy, as he reached the gate, where the men were  dismounting and patting their weary troop-horses.    \"Despatches for Lady Royland,\" said one, who seemed to be the leader.  \"Are you Master Roy, Sir Granby's son?\"    \"Yes.  Have you come from my father?\"    \"Yes, sir, and made all the haste we could; but we've left two brave  lads on the road.\"    \"What! their horses broke down?\"    \"No, sir,\" said the man, significantly; \"but they did.\"    He took off his cap as he spoke, and displayed a bandage round his  forehead.    \"My mate there's got his shoulder ploughed, too, by a bullet.\"    \"Open the gates, Jenks,\" cried Roy.    \"One moment, sir,\" whispered Ben.  \"Get the despatches and see if  they're in your father's writing.\"    \"Right,\" whispered back Roy.  \"Here!--your despatches.\"    \"No, sir,\" said the man, firmly.  \"That's what they asked who barred "]]]
