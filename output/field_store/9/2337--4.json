She is the wife of Fritz, the swineherd, and she will make  him tell thy father; for she will do whatever I ask of her, and Fritz  will do whatever she bids him do.\"    \"And for my sake, wilt thou tell him, Pauline?\" said Otto.    \"But see, Otto,\" said the little girl, \"if I tell him, wilt thou promise  to come indeed and marry me when thou art grown a man?\"    \"Yes,\" said Otto, very seriously, \"I will promise.\"    \"Then I will tell thy father where thou art,\" said she.    \"But thou wilt do it without the Baron Henry knowing, wilt thou not,  Pauline?\"    \"Yes,\" said she, \"for if my father and my mother knew that I did such  a thing, they would strike me, mayhap send me to my bed alone in the  dark.\"          IX. How One-eyed Hans came to Trutz-Drachen.    Fritz, the swineherd, sat eating his late supper of porridge out of a  great, coarse, wooden bowl; wife Katherine sat at the other end of the  table, and the half-naked little children played upon the earthen floor.  A shaggy dog lay curled up in front of the fire, and a grunting pig  scratched against a leg of the rude table close beside where the woman  sat.    \"Yes, yes,\" said Katherine, speaking of the matter of which they had  already been talking. \"It is all very true that the Drachenhausens are a  bad lot, and I for one am of no mind to say no to that; all the same it  is a sad thing that a simple-witted little child like the young Baron  should be so treated as the boy has been; and now that our Lord Baron  has served him so that he, at least, will never be able to do us 'harm,  I for one say that he should not be left there to die alone in that  black cell.\"    Fritz, the swineherd, gave a grunt at this without raising his eyes from  the bowl.    \"Yes, good,\" said Katherine, \"I know what thou meanest, Fritz, and that  it is none of my business to be thrusting my finger into the Baron's  dish. But to hear the way that dear little child spoke when she was here  this morn--it would have moved a heart of stone to hear her tell of all  his pretty talk. Thou wilt try to let the red-beard know that that poor  boy, his son, is sick to death in the black cell; wilt thou not, Fritz?\"    The swineherd dropped his wooden spoon into the bowl with a clatter.  \"Potstausand!\" he cried; \"art thou gone out of thy head to let thy wits  run upon such things as this of which thou talkest to me? If it should  come to our Lord Baron's ears he would cut the tongue from out thy head  and my head from off my shoulders for it. Dost thou think I am going to  meddle in such a matter as this? Listen! these proud Baron folk, with  their masterful ways, drive our sort hither and thither; they beat us,  they drive us, they kill us as they choose. Our lives are not as much  to them as one of my black swine. Why should I trouble my head if they  choose to lop and trim one another? The fewer there are of them the  better for us, say I. We poor folk have a hard enough life of it without  thrusting our heads into the noose to help them out of their troubles.  What thinkest thou would happen to us if Baron Henry should hear of our  betraying his affairs to the Red-beard?\"    \"Nay,\" said Katherine, \"thou hast naught to do in the matter but to tell  the Red-beard in what part of the castle the little Baron lies.\"    \"And what good would that do?\" said Fritz, the swineherd.    \"I know not,\" said Katherine, \"but I have promised the little one that  thou wouldst find the Baron Conrad and tell him that much.\"    \"Thou hast promised a mare's egg,\" said her husband, angrily. \"How shall  I find the Baron Conrad to bear a message to him, when our Baron has  been looking for him in vain for two days past?\"    \"Thou has found him once and thou mayst find him again,\" said Katherine,  \"for it is not likely that he will keep far away from here whilst his  boy is in such sore need of help.\"    \"I will have nothing to do with it!\" said Fritz, and he got up from the  wooden block whereon he was sitting and stumped out of the house. But,  then, Katherine had heard him talk in that way before, and knew, in  spite of his saying \"no,\" that, sooner or later, he would do as she  wished.    Two days later a very stout little one-eyed man, clad in a leathern  jerkin and wearing a round leathern cap upon his head, came toiling up  the path to the postern door of Trutz-Drachen, his back bowed under the  burthen of a great peddler's pack. It was our old friend the one-eyed  Hans, though even his brother would hardly have known him in his present  guise, for, besides having turned peddler, he had grown of a sudden  surprisingly fat.    Rap-tap-tap! He knocked at the door with a knotted end of the crooked  thorned staff upon which he leaned. He waited for a while and then  knocked again--rap-tap-tap!    Presently, with a click, a little square wicket that pierced the door  was opened, and a woman's face peered out through the iron bars.    The one-eyed Hans whipped off his leathern cap.    \"Good day, pretty one,\" said he, \"and hast thou any need of glass beads,  ribbons, combs, or trinkets? Here I am come all the way from Gruenstadt,  with a pack full of such gay things as thou never laid eyes on before.  Here be rings and bracelets and necklaces that might be of pure silver  and set with diamonds and rubies, for anything that thy dear one could  tell if he saw thee decked in them. And all are so cheap that thou hast  only to say, 'I want them,' and they are thine.\"    The frightened face at the window looked from right to left and from  left to right. \"Hush,\" said the girl, and laid her finger upon her lips.  \"There! thou hadst best get away from here, poor soul, as fast as thy  legs can carry thee, for if the Lord Baron should find thee here talking  secretly at the postern door, he would loose the wolf-hounds upon thee.\"    \"Prut,\" said one-eyed Hans, with a grin, \"the Baron is too big a fly to  see such a little gnat as I; but wolf-hounds or no wolf-hounds, I  can never go hence without showing thee the pretty things that I have  brought from the town, even though my stay be at the danger of my own  hide.\"    He flung the pack from off his shoulders as he spoke and fell to  unstrapping it, while the round face of the lass (her eyes big with  curiosity) peered down at him through the grated iron bars.    Hans held up a necklace of blue and white beads that glistened like  jewels in the sun, and from them hung a gorgeous filigree cross. \"Didst  thou ever see a sweeter thing than this?\" said he; \"and look, here is a  comb that even the silversmith would swear was pure silver all the way  through.\" Then, in a soft, wheedling voice, \"Canst thou not let me in,  my little bird? Sure there are other lasses besides thyself who would  like to trade with a poor peddler who has travelled all the way from  Gruenstadt just to please the pretty ones of Trutz-Drachen.\"    \"Nay,\" said the lass, in a frightened voice, \"I cannot let thee in; I  know not what the Baron would do to me, even now, if he knew that I was  here talking to a stranger at the postern;\" and she made as if she would  clap to the little window in his face; but the one-eyed Hans thrust his  staff betwixt the bars and so kept the shutter open.    \"Nay, nay,\" said he, eagerly, \"do not go away from me too soon. Look,  dear one; seest thou this necklace?\"    \"Aye,\" said she, looking hungrily at it.    \"Then listen; if thou wilt but let me into the castle, so that I may  strike a trade, I will give it to thee for thine own without thy paying  a barley corn for it.\"    The girl looked and hesitated, and then looked again; the temptation was  too great. There was a noise of softly drawn bolts and bars, the door  was hesitatingly opened a little way, and, in a twinkling, the one-eyed  Hans had slipped inside the castle, pack and all.    \"The necklace,\" said the girl, in a frightened whisper.    Hans thrust it into her hand. \"It's thine,\" said he, \"and now wilt thou  not help me to a trade?\"    \"I will tell my sister that thou art here,\" said she, and away she ran  from the little stone hallway, carefully bolting and locking the further  door behind her.    The door that the girl had locked was the only one that connected the  postern hail with the castle.    The one-eyed Hans stood looking after her. \"Thou fool!\" he muttered to  himself, \"to lock the door behind thee. What shall I do next, I should  like to know? Here am I just as badly off as I was when I stood outside  the walls. Thou hussy! If thou hadst but let me into the castle for only  two little minutes, I would have found somewhere to have hidden myself  while thy back was turned. But what shall I do now?\" He rested his pack  upon the floor and stood looking about him.    Built in the stone wall opposite to him, was a high, narrow fireplace  without carving of any sort. As Hans' one eye wandered around the bare  stone space, his glance fell at last upon it, and there it rested. For  a while he stood looking intently at it, presently he began rubbing his  hand over his bristling chin in a thoughtful, meditative manner. Finally  he drew a deep breath, and giving himself a shake as though to arouse  himself from his thoughts, and after listening a moment or two to  make sure that no one was nigh, he walked softly to the fireplace, and  stooping, peered up the chimney. Above him yawned a black cavernous  depth, inky with the soot of years. Hans straightened himself, and  tilting his leathern cap to one side, began scratching his bullet-head;  at last he drew a long breath. \"Yes, good,\" he muttered to himself; \"he  who jumps into the river must e'en swim the best he can. It is a vile,  dirty place to thrust one's self; but I am in for it now, and must make  the best of a lame horse.\"    He settled the cap more firmly upon his head, spat"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28681"],[0,"The Cook's Oracle; and Housekeeper's Manual (#10)"],[1,"   The anticipation of pleasure warms our imagination, and keeps those  feelings alive, which possession too often extinguishes.        \"'Tis _expectation_ only makes us blest;      _Enjoyment_ disappoints us at the best.\"    Dr. Johnson has most sagaciously said; \"Such is the state of life, that  none are happy, but by the anticipation of change: the change itself is  nothing: when we have made it, the next wish is, immediately to change  again.\"    However singular our assertions may have at first appeared to those who  have not considered the subject, we hope by this time we have made  converts of our readers, and convinced the \"_Amateurs de Bonne Chere_\"  of the truth and importance of our remarks; and that they will remember,  that DINNER is the only act of the day which cannot be put off with  impunity, for even FIVE MINUTES.    In a well-regulated family, all the clocks and watches should agree; on  this depends the fate of the dinner; what would be agreeable to the  stomach, and restorative to the system, if served at FIVE o'clock, will  be uneatable and innutritive and indigestible at A QUARTER PAST.    The dining-room should be furnished with a good-going clock; the space  over the kitchen fire-place with another, vibrating in unison with the  former, so placed, that the cook may keep one eye on the clock, and the  other on the spit, &c. She will calculate to a minute the time required  to roast a large capon or a little lark, and is equally attentive to the  degree of heat of her stove, and the time her sauce remains on it, when  to withdraw the bakings from the oven, the roast from the spit, and the  stew from the pan.    With all our love of punctuality, the first consideration must still be,  that the dinner \"be well done, when 't is done.\"    It is a common fault with cooks who are anxious about time, to overdress  every thing--the guests had better wait than the dinner--a little delay  will improve their appetite; but if the dinner waits for the guests, it  will be deteriorated every minute: the host who wishes to entertain his  friends with food perfectly well dressed, while he most earnestly  endeavours to impress on their minds the importance of being punctual to  the appointed hour, will still allow his cook a quarter of an hour's  grace.    The old adage that \"the eye is often bigger than the belly,\" is often  verified by the ridiculous vanity of those who wish to make an  appearance above their fortune. Nothing can be more ruinous to real  comfort than the too common custom of setting out a table, with a parade  and a profusion, unsuited not only to the circumstances of the hosts,  but to the number of the guests; or more fatal to true hospitality, than  the multiplicity of dishes which luxury has made fashionable at the  tables of the great, the wealthy, and the ostentatious, who are, often,  neither great nor wealthy.    Such pompous preparation, instead of being a compliment to our guests,  is nothing better than an indirect offence; it is a tacit insinuation,  that it is absolutely necessary to provide such delicacies to bribe the  depravity of their palates, when we desire the pleasure of their  company; and that society now, must be purchased, at the same price  SWIFT told POPE he was obliged to pay for it in Ireland. \"I should  hardly prevail to find one visiter, if I were not able to hire him with  a bottle of wine.\" Vide Swift's letters to Pope, July 10th, 1732.    When twice as much cooking is undertaken as there are servants, or  conveniences in the kitchen to do it properly, dishes must be dressed  long before the dinner hour, and stand by spoiling--the poor cook loses  her credit, and the poor guests get indigestions. Why prepare for eight  or ten friends, more than sufficient for twenty or thirty visiters?  \"Enough is as good as a feast,\" and a prudent provider, who sensibly  takes measure of the stomachic, instead of the SILLY ocular, appetite of  his guests, may entertain his friends, three times as often, and ten  times as well.    It is your SENSELESS SECOND COURSES--ridiculous variety of WINES,  LIQUEURS, ICES,[38-*] DESSERTS, &c.--which are served up merely to feed  the eye, or pamper palled appetite, that _overcome the stomach and  paralyze digestion_, and seduce \"children of a larger growth\" to  sacrifice the health and comfort of several days, for the baby-pleasure  of tickling their tongue for a few minutes, with trifles and custards!!!  &c. &c.    \"INDIGESTION will sometimes overtake the most experienced epicure; when  the gustatory nerves are in good humour, hunger and savoury viands will  sometimes seduce the tongue of a '_grand gourmand_' to betray the  interests of his stomach in spite of his brains.    \"On such an unfortunate occasion, when the stomach sends forth  eructant[38-+] signals of distress, the _peristaltic persuaders_ are as  agreeable and effectual assistance as can be offered; and for delicate  constitutions, and those that are impaired by age or intemperance, are a  valuable panacea.    \"They derive, and deserve this name, from the peculiar mildness of their  operation. One or two very gently increase the action of the principal  viscera, help them to do their work a little faster, and enable the  stomach to serve with an ejectment whatever offends it, and move it into  the bowels.    \"Thus _indigestion_ is easily and speedily removed, _appetite_ restored,  the mouths of the absorbing vessels being cleansed, _nutrition_ is  facilitated, and _strength_ of body, and _energy_ of mind, are the happy  results.\" See \"PEPTIC PRECEPTS,\" from which we extract the following  prescription--    To make FORTY PERISTALTIC PERSUADERS,      Take      Turkey rhubarb, finely pulverized, two drachms,    Syrup (by weight), one drachm,    Oil of carraway, ten drops (minims),    Made into pills, each of which will contain _three grains of rhubarb_.    \"The DOSE OF THE PERSUADERS must be adapted to the constitutional  peculiarity of the patient. When you wish to accelerate or augment the  alvine exoneration, take two, three, or more, according to the effect  you desire to produce. _Two pills_ will do as much for one person, as  _five or six_ will for another: they will generally very regularly  perform what you wish to-day, without interfering with what you hope  will happen to-morrow; and are therefore as convenient an argument  against constipation as any we are acquainted with.    \"The most convenient opportunity to introduce them to the stomach, is  early in the morning, when it is unoccupied, and has no particular  business of digestion, &c. to attend to--i. e. at least half an hour  before breakfast. Physic must never interrupt the stomach, when it is  busy in digesting food.    \"From two to four persuaders will generally produce one additional  motion, within twelve hours. They may be taken at any time by the most  delicate females, whose constitutions are so often distressed by  constipation, and destroyed by the drastic purgatives they take to  relieve it.\"    The cloth[39-*] should be laid in the parlour, and all the paraphernalia  of the dinner-table completely arranged, at least half an hour before  dinner-time.    The cook's labour will be lost, if the parlour-table be not ready for  action, and the eaters ready for the eatables, which the least delay  will irreparably injure: therefore, the GOURMAND will be punctual for  the sake of gratifying his ruling passion; the INVALID, to avoid the  danger of encountering an _indigestion_ from eating ill-dressed food;  and the RATIONAL EPICURE, who happily attends the banquet with \"_mens  sana in corpore sano_,\" will keep the time not only for these strong  reasons, but that he may not lose the advantage of being introduced to  the other guests. He considers not only what is on the table, but who  are around it: his principal inducement to leave his own fireside, is  the charm of agreeable and instructive society, and the opportunity of  making connexions, which may augment the interest and enjoyment of  existence.    It is the most pleasing part of the duty of the master of the feast  (especially when the guests are not very numerous), to take advantage of  these moments to introduce them to one another, naming them individually  in an audible voice, and adroitly laying hold of those ties of  acquaintanceship or profession which may exist between them.    This will much augment the pleasures of the festive board, to which it  is indeed as indispensable a prelude, as an overture is to an opera: and  the host will thus acquire an additional claim to the gratitude of his  guests. We urge this point more strongly, because, from want of  attention to it, we have seen more than once persons whom many kindred  ties would have drawn closely together, pass an entire day without  opening their lips to each other, because they were mutually ignorant of  each other's names, professions, and pursuits.    To put an end at once to all ceremony as to the order in which the  guests are to sit, it will save much time and trouble, if the mistress  of the mansion adopts the simple and elegant method of placing the name  of each guest in the plate which is intended for him. This proceeding  will be of course the result of consideration, and the host will place  those together whom he thinks will harmonize best.    _Le Journal des Dames_ informs us, that in several fashionable houses in  Paris, a new arrangement has been introduced in placing the company at a  dinner-table.    \"The ladies first take their places, leaving intervals for the  gentlemen; after being seated, each is desired to call on a gentleman to  sit beside her; and thus the lady of the house is relieved from all  embarrassment of _etiquette_ as to rank and pretensions,\" &c.    But, without doubt, says the Journalist, this method has its  inconveniences.    \"It may happen that a bashful beauty dare not name the object of her  secret wishes; and an acute observer may"]]]
