[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3800"],[0,"Ethics (#10)"],[1,"P. IV.  The idea of God, from which an infinite number of  things follow in infinite ways, can only be one.    Proof.--Infinite intellect comprehends nothing save the  attributes of God and his modifications (Part i., Prop. xxx.).  Now God is one (Part i., Prop. xiv., Coroll.).  Therefore the  idea of God, wherefrom an infinite number of things follow in  infinite ways, can only be one.  Q.E.D.    PROP. V.  The actual being of ideas owns God as its cause, only  in so far as he is considered as a thinking thing, not in so far  as he is unfolded in any other attribute; that is, the ideas  both of the attributes of God and of particular things do not own  as their efficient cause their objects (ideata) or the things  perceived, but God himself in so far as he is a thinking thing.    Proof.--This proposition is evident from Prop. iii. of this  Part.  We there drew the conclusion, that God can form the idea  of his essence, and of all things which follow necessarily  therefrom, solely because he is a thinking thing, and not because  he is the object of his own idea.  Wherefore the actual being of  ideas owns for cause God, in so far as he is a thinking thing.  It may be differently proved as follows: the actual being of  ideas is (obviously) a mode of thought, that is (Part i., Prop.  xxv., Coroll.) a mode which expresses in a certain manner the  nature of God, in so far as he is a thinking thing, and therefore  (Part i., Prop. x.) involves the conception of no other attribute  of God, and consequently (by Part i., Ax. iv.) is not the effect  of any attribute save thought.  Therefore the actual being of  ideas owns God as its cause, in so far as he is considered as a  thinking thing, &c.  Q.E.D.    PROP. VI.  The modes of any given attribute are caused by God, in  so far as he is considered through the attribute of which they  are modes, and not in so far as he is considered through any  other attribute.    Proof.--Each attribute is conceived through itself, without  any other (Part i., Prop. x.); wherefore the modes of each  attribute involve the conception of that attribute, but not of  any other.  Thus (Part i., Ax. iv.) they are caused by God, only  in so far as he is considered through the attribute whose modes  they are, and not in so far as he is considered through any  other.  Q.E.D.    Corollary.--Hence the actual being of things, which are not  modes of thought, does not follow from the divine nature, because  that nature has prior knowledge of the things.  Things  represented in ideas follow, and are derived from their  particular attribute, in the same manner, and with the same  necessity as ideas follow (according to what we have shown) from  the attribute of thought.    PROP. VII.  The order and connection of ideas is the same as the  order and connection of things.    Proof.--This proposition is evident from Part i., Ax. iv.  For  the idea of everything that is caused depends on a knowledge of  the cause, whereof it is an effect.    Corollary.--Hence God's power of thinking is equal to his  realized power of action--that is, whatsoever follows from the  infinite nature of God in the world of extension (formaliter),  follows without exception in the same order and connection from  the idea of God in the world of thought (objective).    Note.--Before going any further, I wish to recall to mind what  has been pointed out above--namely, that whatsoever can be  perceived by the infinite intellect as constituting the essence  of substance, belongs altogether only to one substance:  consequently, substance thinking and substance extended are one  and the same substance, comprehended now through one attribute,  now through the other.  So, also, a mode of extension and the  idea of that mode are one and the same thing, though expressed in  two ways.  This truth seems to have been dimly recognized by  those Jews who maintained that God, God's intellect, and the  things understood by God are identical.  For instance, a circle  existing in nature, and the idea of a circle existing, which is  also in God, are one and the same thing displayed through  different attributes.  Thus, whether we conceive nature under the  attribute of extension, or under the attribute of thought, or  under any other attribute, we shall find the same order, or one  and the same chain of causes--that is, the same things following  in either case.    I said that God is the cause of an idea--for instance, of the  idea of a circle,--in so far as he is a thinking thing; and of a  circle, in so far as he is an extended thing, simply because the  actual being of the idea of a circle can only be perceived as a  proximate cause through another mode of thinking, and that again  through another, and so on to infinity; so that, so long as we  consider things as modes of thinking, we must explain the order  of the whole of nature, or the whole chain of causes, through the  attribute of thought only.  And, in so far as we consider things  as modes of extension, we must explain the order of the whole of  nature through the attributes of extension only; and so on, in  the case of the other attributes.  Wherefore of things as they  are in themselves God is really the cause, inasmuch as he  consists of infinite attributes.  I cannot for the present  explain my meaning more clearly.    PROP. VIII.  The ideas of particular things, or of modes, that do  not exist, must be comprehended in the infinite idea of God, in  the same way as the formal essences of particular things or modes  are contained in the attributes of God.    Proof.--This proposition is evident from the last; it is  understood more clearly from the preceding note.    Corollary.--Hence, so long as particular things do not exist,  except in so far as they are comprehended in the attributes of  God, their representations in thought or ideas do not exist,  except in so far as the infinite idea of God exists; and when  particular things are said to exist, not only in so far as they  are involved in the attributes of God, but also in so far as they  are said to continue, their ideas will also involve existence,  through which they are said to continue.    Note.--If anyone desires an example to throw more light on  this question, I shall, I fear, not be able to give him any,  which adequately explains the thing of which I here speak,  inasmuch as it is unique; however, I will endeavour to  illustrate it as far as possible.  The nature of a circle is such  that if any number of straight lines intersect within it, the  rectangles formed by their segments will be equal to one another;  thus, infinite equal rectangles are contained in a circle.  Yet  none of these rectangles can be said to exist, except in so far  as the circle exists; nor can the idea of any of these  rectangles be said to exist, except in so far as they are  comprehended in the idea of the circle.  Let us grant that, from  this infinite number of rectangles, two only exist.  The ideas of  these two not only exist, in so far as they are contained in the  idea of the circle, but also as they involve the existence of  those rectangles; wherefore they are distinguished from the  remaining ideas of the remaining rectangles.    PROP. IX.  The idea of an individual thing actually existing is  caused by God, not in so far as he is infinite, but in so far as  he is considered as affected by another idea of a thing actually  existing, of which he is the cause, in so far as he is affected  by a third idea, and so on to infinity.    Proof.--The idea of an individual thing actually existing is  an individual mode of thinking, and is distinct from other modes  (by the Corollary and note to Prop. viii. of this part); thus  (by Prop. vi. of this part) it is caused by God, in so far only  as he is a thinking thing.  But not (by Prop. xxviii. of Part i.)  in so far as he is a thing thinking absolutely, only in so far as  he is considered as affected by another mode of thinking; and he  is the cause of this latter, as being affected by a third, and so  on to infinity.  Now, the order and connection of ideas is (by  Prop. vii. of this book) the same as the order and connection of  causes.   Therefore of a given individual idea another individual  idea, or God, in so far as he is considered as modified by that  idea, is the cause; and of this second idea God is the cause, in  so far as he is affected by another idea, and so on to infinity.  Q.E.D.    Corollary.--Whatsoever takes place in the individual object of  any idea, the knowledge thereof is in God, in so far only as he  has the idea of the object.    Proof.--Whatsoever takes place in the object of any idea, its  idea is in God (by Prop. iii. of this part), not in so far as he  is infinite, but in so far as he is considered as affected by  another idea of an individual thing (by the last Prop.); but (by  Prop. vii. of this part) the order and connection of ideas is the  same as the order and connection of things.  The knowledge,  therefore, of that which takes place in any individual object  will be in God, in so far only as he has the idea of that object.  Q.E.D.    PROP. X.  The being of substance does not appertain to the  essence of man--in other words, substance does not constitute the  actual being[2] of man.    [2] \"Forma\"      Proof.--The being of substance involves necessary existence  (Part i., Prop. vii.).  If, therefore, the being of substance  appertains to the essence of man, substance being granted, man  would necessarily be granted also (II. Def. ii.), and,  consequently, man would necessarily exist, which is absurd  (II. Ax. i.).  Therefore, &c.  Q.E.D.    Note.--This proposition may also be proved from I.v., in which  it is shown that there cannot be two substances of the same  nature; for as there may be many men, the being of substance is  not that which constitutes the actual being of man.  Again, the  proposition is evident from the other properties of  substance--namely,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38003"],[0,"Color Key to North American Birds (#10)"],[1,"ion: 69.]    =69.

TUBE-NOSED SWIMMERS.    TUBINARES.         Family 1. ALBATROSSES. DiomedeidA|. 4 species.       Family 2. FULMARS, SHEARWATERS, and PETRELS. ProcellariidA|.       26 species, 1 subspecies.      The Albatrosses, of which about ten species are known, are birds of  far southern seas, where they nest on isolated islands. After the  young are reared, several species migrate northward and are found off  our Pacific coast. The largest known species, the Wandering Albatross,  which has been made famous by Coleridge's \"Rime of the Ancient  Mariner,\" measures from twelve to fourteen feet in expanse of wing,  and, like other members of this family, is a tireless ocean wanderer.    In the museum of Brown University, there is a mounted Wandering  Albatross, killed off the coast of Chili by Capt. Hiram Luther,  December 20, 1847. When captured, a small bottle was found tied around  the bird's neck, containing a slip of paper from which it was learned  that the bottle had been attached to the bird December 12, 1847, by  Capt. Edwards of the New Bedford Whaler, \"Euphrates,\" when about 800  miles off the coast of New Zealand, or about 3,400 miles from the  point at which, eight days later, the bird was secured.    The Fulmars, (genus _Fulmarus_), are northern birds and nest in  immense numbers on isolated islets, somewhat like certain Gulls.    Comparatively little is known of the nesting places of our  Shearwaters, but it is believed that most of them breed on the islands  of the South Atlantic and South Pacific, and pass their winter, (our  summer) off our coasts.    One of the Petrels, (Wilson Petrel), is known to have this habit. It  has been found nesting on Kerguelen Island, in S. Lat. 49A deg. 54', in  February, and in May it appears off our coasts for the summer.    Petrels nest in holes in the ground, laying one white egg. They are  never seen near their homes during the day, the bird then on the nest  waiting until night to feed, when the one which has been at sea  returns to assume its share of the task of incubation. Those birds are  therefore both diurnal and nocturnal.      Albatrosses      [Illustration: 81.]    =81. Black-footed Albatross= (_Diomedea nigripes_).
