At 6:30       A.M. in presence of the Scientific Commission of the Aero Club, I       started again for the Eiffel Tower.         I turned the tower at the end of nine minutes and took my way       back to St. Cloud; but my balloon was losing hydrogen through one       of its two automatic gas valves whose spring had been       accidentally weakened.         I had perceived the beginning of this loss of gas even before       reaching the Eiffel Tower, and ordinarily, in such an event, I       should have come at once to earth to examine the lesion. But here       I was competing for a prize of great honour and my speed had been       good. Therefore I risked going on.         The balloon now shrunk visibly. By the time I had got back to the       fortifications of Paris, near La Muette, it caused the suspension       wires to sag so much that those nearest to the screw-propeller       caught in it as it revolved.         I saw the propeller cutting and tearing at the wires. I stopped       the motor instantly. Then, as a consequence, the airship was at       once driven back toward the tower by the wind which was strong.    [Illustration: Photo by International Film Service Co.    _A Kite Balloon Rising from the Hold of a Ship._]         At the same time I was falling. The balloon had lost much gas. I       might have thrown out ballast and greatly diminished the fall,       but then the wind would have time to blow me back on the Eiffel       Tower. I therefore preferred to let the airship go down as it was       going. It may have seemed a terrific fall to those who watched it       from the ground but to me the worst detail was the airship's lack       of equilibrium. The half-empty balloon, fluttering its empty end       as an elephant waves his trunk, caused the airship's stern to       point upward at an alarming angle. What I most feared therefore       was that the unequal strain on the suspension wires would break       them one by one and so precipitate me to the ground.         Why was the balloon fluttering an empty end causing all this       extra danger? How was it that the rotary ventilator was not       fulfilling its purpose in feeding the interior air balloon and in       this manner swelling out the gas balloon around it? The answer       must be looked for in the nature of the accident. The rotary       ventilator stopped working when the motor itself stopped, and I       had been obliged to stop the motor to prevent the propeller from       tearing the suspension wires near it when the balloon first began       to sag from loss of gas. It is true that the ventilator which was       working at that moment had not proved sufficient to prevent the       first sagging. It may have been that the interior balloon refused       to fill out properly. The day after the accident when my balloon       constructor's man came to me for the plans of a \"No. 6\" balloon       envelope I gathered from something he said that the interior       balloon of \"No. 5,\" not having been given time for its varnish to       dry before being adjusted, might have stuck together or stuck to       the sides or bottom of the outer balloon. Such are the rewards of       haste.         I was falling. At the same time the wind was carrying me toward       the Eiffel Tower. It had already carried me so far that I was       expecting to land on the Seine embankment beyond the Trocadero.       My basket and the whole of the keel had already passed the       Trocadero hotels, and had my balloon been a spherical one it       would have cleared the building. But now at the last critical       moment, the end of the long balloon that was still full of gas       came slapping down on the roof just before clearing it. It       exploded with a great noise; struck after being blown up. This       was the terrific explosion described in the newspaper of the day.         I had made a mistake in my estimate of the wind's force, by a few       yards. Instead of being carried on to fall on the Seine       embankment, I now found myself hanging in my wicker basket high       up in the courtyard of the Trocadero hotels, supported by my       airship's keel, that stood braced at an angle of about forty-five       degrees between the courtyard wall above and the roof of a lower       construction farther down. The keel, in spite of my weight, that       of the motor and machinery, and the shock it had received in       falling, resisted wonderfully. The thin pine scantlings and piano       wires of Nice (the town where the idea of a keel first suggested       itself) had saved my life!         After what seemed tedious waiting, I saw a rope being lowered to       me from the roof above. I held to it and was hauled up, when I       perceived my rescuers to be the brave firemen of Paris. From       their station at Passy they had been watching the flight of the       airship. They had seen my fall and immediately hastened to the       spot. Then, having rescued me, they proceeded to rescue the       airship.         The operation was painful. The remains of the balloon envelope       and the suspension wires hung lamentably; and it was impossible       to disengage them except in strips and fragments!    The later balloon \"No. VI.\" with which Santos-Dumont won the Deutsch  prize may fairly be taken as his conception of the finished type of  dirigible for one man. In fact his aspirations never soared as high  as those of Count Zeppelin, and the largest airship he ever  planned--called \"the _Omnibus_\"--carried only four men. It is  probable that the diversion of his interest from dirigibles to  airplanes had most to do with his failure to carry his development  further than he did. \"No. VI.\" was 108 feet long, and 20 feet in  diameter with an eighteen-horse-power gasoline engine which could  drive it at about nineteen miles an hour. Naturally the aeronaut's  first thought in his new construction was of the valves. The memory  of the anxious minutes spent perched on the window-sill of the  Trocadero Hotel or dangling like a spider at the end of the  firemen's rope were still fresh. The ballonet which had failed him  in \"No. V.\" was perfected in its successor. Notwithstanding the care  with which she was constructed the prize-winner turned out to be a  rather unlucky ship. On her trial voyage she ran into a tree and was  damaged, and even on the day of her greatest conquest she behaved  badly. The test was made on October 1, 1901. The aeronaut had  rounded the Tower finely and was making for home when the motor  began to miss and threatened to stop altogether. While Santos-Dumont  was tinkering with the engine, leaving the steering wheel to itself,  the balloon drifted over the Bois de Boulogne. As usual the cool air  from the wood caused the hydrogen in the balloon to contract and the  craft dropped until it appeared the voyage would end in the tree  tops. Hastily shifting his weights the aeronaut forced the prow of  the ship upwards to a sharp angle with the earth. Just at this  moment the reluctant engine started up again with such vigour that  for a moment the ship threatened to assume a perpendicular position,  pointing straight up in the sky. A cry went up from the spectators  below who feared a dire catastrophe was about to end a voyage which  promised success. But with incomparable _sang-froid_ the young  Brazilian manipulated the weights, restored the ship to the  horizontal again without stopping the engines, and reached the  finishing stake in time to win the prize. Soon after it was awarded  him the Brazilian Government presented him with another substantial  prize, together with a gold medal bearing the words: _Por ceos nunca  d'antes navegados_ (\"Through heavens hitherto unsailed\").    In a sense the reference to the heavens is a trifle over-rhetorical.  Santos-Dumont differed from all aviators (or pilots of airplanes)  and most navigators of dirigibles in always advocating the strategy  of staying near the ground. In his flights he barely topped the  roofs of the houses, and in his writings he repeatedly refers to the  sense of safety that came to him when he knew he was close to the  tree tops of a forest. This may have been due to the fact that in  his very first flight in a dirigible he narrowly escaped a fatal  accident due to flying too high. As he descended, the gas which had  expanded now contracted. The balloon began to collapse in the  middle. Cords subjected to unusual stress began to snap. The air  pump, which should have pumped the ballonet full of air to keep the  balloon rigid failed to work. Seeing that he was about to fall into  a field in which his drag rope was already trailing the imperilled  airman had a happy thought. Some boys were there flying kites. He  shouted to them to seize his rope and run against the wind. The  balloon responded to the new force like a kite. The rapidity of its  fall was checked, and its pilot landed with only a serious shaking.    But thereafter Santos-Dumont preached the maxim--rare among  airmen--\"Keep near the ground. That way lies safety!\" Most aviators  however, prefer the heights of the atmosphere, as the sailor prefers  the wide and open sea to a course near land.    After winning the Deutsch prize, Santos-Dumont continued for a time  to amuse himself with dirigibles. I say \"amuse\" purposely, for never  did serious aeronaut get so much fun out of a rather perilous  pastime as he. In his \"No. IX.\" he built the smallest dirigible  ever known. The balloon had just power enough to raise her pilot and  sixty-six pounds more beside a three-horse-power motor. But she  attained a speed of twelve miles an hour, was readily handled, and  it was her owner's dearest delight to use her for a taxicab, calling  for lunch at the cafes in the Bois, and paying visits to friends  upon whom he looked in, literally, at their second-story"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3005"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Airship (#10)"],[1,"smashed.    \"It'll take him a day to repair that,\" commented the aeronaut dryly.    The Red Cloud created a sensation as she slowly settled down in front  of the big tent assigned to her. Tom's craft was easily the best one at  the carnival, so far, though the managers said other machines were on  the way.    The exhibition opened the next day, but no flights were to be attempted  until the day following. Two more crafts arrived, a large triplane, and  a dirigible balloon. There were many visitors to the ground, and Tom,  Ned and Mr. Sharp were kept busy answering questions put by those who  crowded into their tent. Toward the close of the day a fussy little  Frenchman entered, and, making his way to where Tom stood, asked:    \"Air you ze ownair of zis machine?\"    \"One of them,\" replied the lad.    \"Ha! Sacre! Zen I challenge you to a race. I have a monoplane zat is ze  swiftest evaire! One thousand francs will I wager you, zat I can fly  higher and farther zan you.\"    \"Shall we take him up, Mr. Sharp?\" asked Tom.    \"We'll race with him, after we get through with the club entries,\"  decided the aeronaut. \"But not for money. It's against my principles,  and I don't believe your father would like it. Racing for prizes is a  different thing.\"    \"Well, we will devote ze money to charity,\" conceded the Frenchman.  This was a different matter, and one to which Mr. Sharp did not object,  so it was arranged that a trial should take place after the regular  affairs.    That night was spent in getting the Red Cloud in shape for the contests  of the next day. She was \"groomed\" until every wire was taut and every  cog, lever and valve working perfectly. Ned Newton helped all he could.  So much has appeared in the newspapers of the races at Blakeville that  I will not devote much space here to them. Suffice it to say that the  Red Cloud easily distanced the big dirigible from which much was  expected. It was a closer contest with the large triplane, but Tom's  airship won, and was given the prize, a fine silver cup.    As the carnival was a small one, no other craft in a class with the Red  Cloud had been entered, so Tom and Mr. Sharp had to be content with the  one race they won. There were other contests among monoplanes and  biplanes, and the little Frenchman won two races.    \"Now for ze affaire wis ze monstaire balloon of ze rouge color!\" he  cried, as he alighted from his monoplane while an assistant filled the  gasolene tank. \"I will in circles go around you, up and down, zis side  zen ze ozzer, and presto! I am back at ze starting place, before you  have begun. Zen charity shall be ze richair!\"    \"All right, wait and see,\" said Tom, easily. But, though he showed much  confidence he asked Mr. Sharp in private, just before the impromptu  contest: \"Do you think we can beat him?\"    \"Well,\" said the aeronaut, shrugging his shoulders, \"you can't tell  much about the air. His machine certainly goes very fast, but too much  wind will be the undoing of him, while it will only help us. And I  think,\" he added, \"that we're going to get a breeze.\"    It was arranged that the Red Cloud would start from the ground, without  the use of the gas, so as to make the machines more even. At the signal  off they started, the motors making a great racket. The monoplane with  the little Frenchman in the seat got up first.    \"Ah, ha!\" he cried gaily, \"I leave you in ze rear! Catch me if you can!\"    \"Don't let him beat us,\" implored Ned.    \"Can't you speed her up any more?\" inquired Tom of Mr. Sharp.    The aeronaut nodded grimly, and turned more gasolene into the  twenty-cylindered engine. Like a flash the Red Cloud darted forward.  But the Frenchman also increased his speed and did, actually, at first,  circle around the bigger machine, for his affair was much lighter. But  when he tried to repeat that feat he found that he was being left  behind.    \"That's the stuff! We're winning!\" yelled Tom, Ned joining in the shout.    Then came a puff of wind. The monoplane had to descend, for it was in  danger of turning turtle. Still the navigator was not going to give up.  He flew along at a lower level. Then Mr. Sharp opened up the Red  Cloud's engine at full speed, and it was the big machine which now  sailed around the other.    \"I protest! I protest!\" cried the Frenchman, above the explosions of  his motor. \"Ze wind is too strong for me!\"    Mr. Sharp said nothing, but, with a queer smile on his face he sent the  airship down toward the earth. A moment later he was directly under the  monoplane. Then, quickly rising, he fairly caught the Frenchman's  machine on top of a square platform of the gas container, the bicycle  wheels of the monoplane resting on the flat surface. And, so swiftly  did the Red Cloud fly along that it carried the monoplane with it, to  the chagrin of the French navigator.    \"A trick! A trick!\" he cried. \"Eet is not fair!\"    Then, dropping down, Mr. Sharp allowed the monoplane to proceed under  its own power, while he raced on to the finish mark, winning, of  course, by a large margin.    \"Ha! A trick! I race you to-morrow and again to-morrow!\" cried the  beaten Frenchman as he alighted.    \"No, thanks,\" answered Tom. \"We've had enough. I guess charity will be  satisfied.\"    The little Frenchman was a good loser, and paid over the money, which  was given to the Blakeville Hospital, the institution receiving it  gladly.    At the request of the carnival committee, Mr. Sharp and Tom gave an  exhibition of high and long flights the next day, and created no little  astonishment by their daring feats.    \"Well, I think we have reason to be proud of our ship,\" remarked Mr.  Sharp that night. \"We won the first contest we were ever in, and beat  that speedy monoplane, which was no small thing to do, as they are very  fast.\"    \"But wait until we go on our trip,\" added Tom, as he looked at the cup  they had won. He little realized what danger they were to meet with in  the flight that was before them.          Chapter 9    The Runaway Auto      Had the inventors of the Red Cloud desired, they could have made  considerable money by giving further exhibitions at the Blakeville Aero  Carnival, and at others which were to be held in the near future at  adjoining cities. The fame of the new machine had spread, and there  were many invitations to compete for prizes.    But Tom and Mr. Sharp wished to try their skill in a long flight, and  at the close of the Blakeville exhibition they started for Shopton,  arriving there without mishap, though Tom more than half hoped that  they might happen to strike the tower of a certain school. I needn't  specify where.    The first thing to be done was to complete the fitting-up of the car,  or cabin. No berths had, as yet, been put in, and these were first  installed after the Red Cloud was in her shed. Then an electrical  heating and cooking apparatus was fitted in; some additional machinery,  tanks for carrying water, and chemicals for making the gas, boxes of  provisions, various measuring instruments and other supplies were put  in the proper places, until the cabin was filled almost to its  capacity. Of course particular attention had been paid to the ship  proper, and every portion was gone over until Mr. Sharp was sure it was  in shape for a long flight.    \"Now the question is,\" he said to Tom one evening, \"who shall we take  with us? You and I will go, of course, but I'd like one more. I wonder  if your father can't be induced to accompany us? He seemed to like the  trial trip.\"    \"I'll ask him to-morrow,\" said the lad. \"He's very busy to-night. If he  doesn't care about it, maybe Garret Jackson will go.\"    \"I'm afraid not. He's too timid.\"    \"I'd like to take Ned Newton, but he can't get any more time away from  the bank. I guess we'll have to depend on dad.\"    But, to the surprise of Tom and Mr. Sharp, the aged inventor shook his  head when the subject was broached to him next day.    \"Why won't you go, dad?\" asked his son.    \"I'll tell you,\" replied Mr. Swift. \"I was keeping it a secret until I  had made some advance in what I am engaged upon. But I don't want to go  because I am on the verge of perfecting a new apparatus for submarine  boats. It will revolutionize travel under the water, and I don't want  to leave home until I finish it. There is another point to be  considered. The government has offered a prize for an under-water boat  of a new type, and I wish to try for it.\"    \"So that's what you've been working on, eh, dad?\" asked his son.    \"That's it, and, much as I should like to accompany you, I don't feel  free to go. My mind would be distracted, and I need to concentrate  myself on this invention. It will produce the most wonderful results,  I'm sure. Besides, the government prize is no small one. It is fifty  thousand dollars for a successful boat.\"    Mr. Swift told something more about his submarine, but, as I expect to  treat of that in another book, I will not dwell on it here, as I know  you are anxious to learn what happened on the trip of the Red Cloud.    \"Well,\" remarked Mr. Sharp, somewhat dubiously, \"I wonder who we can  get to go? We need someone besides you and I, Tom.\"    \"I s'pose I could get Eradicate Sampson, and his mule Boomerang,\"  replied the lad with a smile. \"Yet I don't know--\"    At that instant there was a tremendous racket outside. The loud puffing  of an automobile could be heard, but mingled with it was the crash of  wood, and then the whole house seemed jarred and shaken.    \"Is it an earthquake?\" exclaimed Mr. Swift, springing to his feet, and  rushing to the library windows.    \"Something's happened!\" cried Tom.    \"Maybe an explosion of the airship gas!\" yelled Mr. Sharp, making ready  to run to the balloon shed. But there was no need. The crashing of wood  ceased, and, above the puffing of an auto could be heard a voice  exclaiming:    \"Bless my very existence! Bless my cats and dogs! Good gracious! But I  never"]]]
