If there is not this  indiarubber spring, when the top strap is buckled tight enough to prevent  the cap slipping down, the motion will cause it to rub the skin at the  back of the knee; and I have seen some bad abrasions, that caused  temporary lameness, from this cause. If the top strap is buckled loose  enough to avoid this chafing, then the knee-cap won't stay up in its  proper place, if it has no spring. The country-made knee-caps sold by the  native saddlers seldom are fitted with it; and if they are they cannot be  relied on, as generally the indiarubber is bad and perished. The lower  strap of the knee-cap should be buckled quite loose, it being only  required to keep it down and prevent it flapping about; but \"syces\" are  very apt to draw it tight also, and if they do, it is pretty certain to  cut the skin.          GROOMING, STABLE GEAR, Etc.      Heel Ropes (_pecharie_).    If possible, horses should be left loose, which generally can be done in  India, as most of the stables are loose boxes. Sometimes it is necessary  to fasten them up, such as when picketed out at night in the hot weather  or on the march. There are several plans of picketing, each having its  advantages and disadvantages; but as these generally apply to military  animals, I will merely mention those commonly used in private stables. The  most common plan is to fasten the horse up with head and heel ropes, to  wooden pegs driven into the ground. Heel ropes (pecharie) consist of  either two ropes about twelve feet long, ending in a single one, so as to  be Y-shaped, the single one being fastened to a wooden peg (make) driven  into the ground, and the two arms to the horse's hind fetlocks by means of  leather straps, called \"muzzumas.\" These straps are loops of rope covered  with leather, to one end of which the heel rope is tied, and into which  the hind foot is slipped, being secured by a flat leather thong wound  round the middle of it behind the fetlock joint to prevent its slipping  off. The strap is then of a fig. 8, or hour-glass shape, the heel rope  being tied in one loop, the foot placed in the other, the thong forming  the neck or constriction. These, I think, are the best form of leather  foot strap; but in buying them care should be taken that the stitching of  the leather is on the outside, as if it is on the inside, where natives  often put it, it is very likely to rub the skin and cause a bad cracked  heel. Another form of \"muzzuma\" is made out of stiff flat leather lined  with felt. This has a slip loop going round it, with a buckle on one side  and a strap on the other, that runs along the centre. The heel rope is  tied to one end, the foot put into the other, and when the strap is  buckled tightly, the running loop is drawn close up to the heel, so as to  keep the whole arrangement in its place. This form of \"muzzuma\" is the  usual kind sold; but it is objectionable, as the edges get stiff and hard,  and are likely to cut the heel, which the round ones do not. Both sorts of  leather \"muzzumas\" require to be kept soft and pliable with dubbing  (momrogan), which \"syces\" never think necessary. I, however, prefer those  made out of plaited hemp or tow. They are merely a band of loosely plaited  tow, about eighteen inches long, the heel rope being fastened to one end,  and secured by a string or tape just behind the fetlock; they are much  softer than the leather ones, and quite as strong. The disadvantage,  however, is that they soon wear out, but they are very cheap; in fact, the  \"syces\" can make them themselves out of the raw hemp or tow (sun). They  are used by many of the native cavalry regiments in India in preference to  the leather ones. The heel ropes can be made out of one long rope doubled,  a \"muzzuma\" fastened to each free end, and the doubled portion to a  tent-peg. When heel ropes are used, one should be put on each hind leg; it  is dangerous to only put on one, and I have seen more than one fractured  thigh caused by this. If the heel ropes are on both hind legs, and the  horse kicks, he has to do so straight into the air, as there is equal  restraint on both; but if there is only one, the unequal check of the  single rope is likely to cause a fracture. If allowed, \"syces\" will always  pull the heel ropes so tight as to stretch the horse out; they should be  loose enough to allow him to stand in a natural position.      Head Ropes (_aghari_).    Head ropes should be fastened to the ring on the head collar (nukta) under  the chin. There should either be two separate ropes, one end of each  fastened to the ring, or one long one doubled in the middle, the central  portion fastened to the ring, and the two ends to two wooden pegs driven  into the ground about three or four feet on each side of the horse's head.  If only a single rope is used, it must, naturally, be fastened to a peg  straight in front, and, to allow the horse to move his head up and down,  must be loose. When fastened in this way he is exceedingly likely to get  his fore leg over the rope and get hung up in it, a nasty wound in the  heel or at the back of the knee being the result, if nothing worse;  whereas, if the ropes are pegged out on each side, he can move about  freely, and it would be difficult for him to get his leg over them. Both  head and heel ropes should be made of hemp; the cotton rope used in India  for most purposes is not strong enough, and soon breaks and wears out. In  Peshawur and along the north-west frontier, a rope is made of goat hair  that is very strong, and is excellent for this purpose. It is somewhat  more expensive than ordinary rope, but with care will last a long time,  and will amply repay itself. Both head and heel ropes should be tied to  the pegs in a slipknot, so that with a single pull horses can be set free  when necessary. \"Syces\" will usually tie them in a jam-knot, and horses  struggling to get loose when frightened very often badly injure themselves  before they can be set free.      Fetlock Picketing.    A method of picketing horses was introduced into the Indian army some  years ago, by dispensing with head ropes and using a short chain shackle  about three feet long, buckled round one of the fore fetlocks, and  fastened to a peg driven into the ground. This was chiefly done with the  object of reducing the weight carried, and with animals used for military  purposes, doubtless fulfilled the purpose, but in a private stable I fail  to see its advantages over the other plan.      Picketing Posts.    When horses are picketed outside the stable, and there is space enough,  picketing posts are the most preferable method, as they allow greater  freedom than any other. A stout smooth post, about five or six inches in  diameter, is driven several feet into the ground, so that it is five or  six feet above the surface, a strong iron ring is slipped over it, and to  this the head rope is made fast; no heel ropes are used, and the horse can  move round it as he pleases. The post must be smooth, so that there is  nothing for the ring to catch in, and when put into the ground the point  should be put into the fire and charred, or covered with kerosene oil, to  keep off the white ants. It will also have to be examined occasionally to  see that it is not damaged or rotten. The only drawback to this plan is  that, if there are several horses, a considerable space is necessary, as  they must be far enough apart to prevent their kicking at each other.      Ringing.    In South Africa and the colonies horses are picketed by the method known  as \"ringing,\" the head rope of one being fastened to the head collar of  the next, and so on, till the head rope of the last is in its turn  fastened to the head collar of the first, their heads forming a ring  looking inwards. Colonial horses will stand like this for hours together;  but they are very quiet, and behave in a different way to the Indian  country-bred. I have seen the same plan used in a cavalry regiment of the  Italian army on the march near Milan.      Rheims.    In South Africa head ropes are made of prepared raw hide called \"rheims.\"  They are prepared by the Kaffir women out of raw ox hide, and are very  strong and supple, and are excellent for the purpose.      Knee-haltering.    Knee-haltering is also a South African plan of securing horses when turned  out to graze. The fore leg is lifted up, so that the forearm from the  elbow to the knee is parallel to the ground. The head rope, or \"rheim,\" is  then fastened above the knee, the head being pulled a little downwards.  The horse is then turned out to graze on the veldt, and when his head is  down feeding he can use his limbs and walk about as he likes, but as soon  as he puts up his head to trot or gallop the fore leg is pulled up, and he  has only three to go on, and can easily be caught.      Shackles (_bheri_).    The natives of India use iron shackles, much like handcuffs, to fasten  with a key round both fore fetlocks of horses when turned out loose; but  they are not a desirable invention, and in young animals are very likely  to cause ringbones. But this, I think, is on account of their clumsy shape  and being constantly worn, as I believe shackles made out of round iron  that shut with a spring were used by the Canadian mounted police at one  time when turning their horses out, and they found they did not chafe and  rub so much as leather ones did. It was found that even moving through the  wet grass the steel hobbles were polished, kept bright, and required no  attention, whereas the leather ones perished and became hard, and gave  constant trouble unless carefully looked after. I have never tried this  plan myself, for I have found the Cape system of knee-haltering when  turning animals out to graze the best I have yet come across.      Picketing-pegs (_make_).    Picketing-pegs should be made out of hard wood about eighteen inches to  two feet long; iron ones are dangerous."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32426"],[0,"A Synopsis of the North American Lagomorpha (#10)"],[1," floridanus subcinctus_, Lyon, Smiths.

Hind feet densely covered with long hair; ear short; tympanic  bulla of moderate size. In the northern part of its range _S. nuttallii_  occurs principally in the sagebrush areas but it occurs also in the  timbered areas of the Transition Life-zone and almost exclusively in  timbered areas in the southern part of its range. From _S. floridanus_,  _S. nuttallii_ along the eastern margin of its range differs in more  slender rostrum, and larger external auditory meatus. In New Mexico and  Arizona, _S. nuttallii_ differs from _S. floridanus_ in the posteriorly  pointed and un-notched supraoccipital shield and in the posterior  extension of the supraorbital process, the tip of which projects free  from the braincase or merely lies against the braincase instead of being  firmly welded to the side of the skull. From _S. audubonii_, _S.  nuttallii_ differs in shorter ears, smaller tympanic bullae and smaller  hind legs; _S. nuttallii_ usually occurs at higher elevations, or where  the two occur at approximately the same elevation _S. nuttallii_ occurs  in wooded or brushy areas and _S. audubonii_ lives on the plains or in  relatively open country.
