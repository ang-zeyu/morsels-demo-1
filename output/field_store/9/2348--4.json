[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29031"],[0,"Sir William Herschel: His Life and Works (#10)"],[1,"te, for      on the 1st of January, 1783, a very fine one cracked by frost in the      tube.        . . . \"In my brother's absence from home I was, of course, left alone      to amuse myself with my own thoughts, which were anything but      cheerful. I found I was to be trained for an assistant astronomer,      and, by way of encouragement, a telescope adapted for 'sweeping,'      consisting of a tube with two glasses, such as are commonly used in      a 'finder,' was given me. I was 'to sweep for comets,' and I see, by      my journal, that I began August 22d, 1782, to write down and      describe all remarkable appearances I saw in my 'sweeps,' which were      horizontal. But it was not till the last two months of the same year      that I felt the least encouragement to spend the star-light nights      on a grass-plot covered with dew or hoar-frost, without a human      being near enough to be within call. I knew too little of the real      heavens to be able to point out every object so as to find it again,      without losing much time by consulting the Atlas. But all these      troubles were removed when I knew my brother to be at no great      distance making observations, with his various instruments, on      double stars, planets, etc., and when I could have his assistance      immediately if I found a nebula or cluster of stars, of which I      intended to give a catalogue; but, at the end of 1783, I had only      marked fourteen, when my sweeping was interrupted by being employed      to write down my brother's observations with the large twenty-foot.      I had, however, the comfort to see that my brother was satisfied      with my endeavors to assist him when he wanted another person either      to run to the clocks, write down a memorandum, fetch and carry      instruments, or measure the ground with poles, etc., etc., of which      something of the kind every moment would occur. For the assiduity      with which the measurements on the diameter of the _Georgium Sidus_,      and observations of other planets, double stars, etc., etc., were      made, was incredible, as may be seen by the various papers that were      given to the Royal Society in 1783, which papers were written in the      daytime, or when cloudy nights interfered. Besides this, the      twelve-inch speculum was perfected before the spring, and many hours      were spent at the turning-bench, as not a night clear enough for      observing ever passed but that some improvements were planned for      perfecting the mounting and motions of the various instruments then      in use, or some trials were made of new constructed eye-pieces,      which were mostly executed by my brother's own hands. Wishing to      save his time, he began to have some work of that kind done by a      watchmaker who had retired from business and lived on Datchet      Common; but the work was so bad, and the charges so unreasonable,      that he could not be employed. It was not till some time afterwards,      in his frequent visits to the meetings of the Royal Society (made in      moonlight nights), that he had an opportunity of looking about for      mathematical workmen, opticians, and founders. But the work seldom      answered expectation, and it was kept, to be executed with      improvements by ALEXANDER during the few months he spent with us.        \"The summer months passed in the most active preparation for getting      the large twenty-foot ready against the next winter. The carpenters      and smiths of Datchet were in daily requisition, and, as soon as      patterns for tools and mirrors were ready, my brother went to town      to have them cast, and, during the three or four months ALEXANDER      could be absent from Bath, the mirrors and optical parts were nearly      completed.        \"But that the nights after a day of toil were not given to rest, may      be seen by the observations on _Mars_, of which a paper, dated      December 1, 1783, was given to the Royal Society. Some trouble,      also, was often thrown away, during those nights, in the attempt to      teach me to remeasure double stars with the same micrometers with      which former measures had been taken, and the small twenty-foot was      given me for that purpose. . . . I had also to ascertain their places      by a transit instrument lent for that purpose by Mr. DALRYMPLE; but,      after many fruitless attempts, it was seen that the instrument was,      perhaps, as much in fault as my observations.\"    In 1783 HERSCHEL says:        \"I have now finished my third review of the heavens. The first was      made with a Newtonian telescope something less than seven feet focal      length, a power of 222, and an aperture of four and a half inches.      It extended only to stars of the first, second, third, and fourth      magnitudes. My second review was made with an instrument much      superior to the other, of 85.2 inches focus, 6.2 inches aperture,      and power 227. It extended to all the stars of HARRIS'S maps and      the telescopic ones near them, as far as the eighth magnitude. The      Catalogue of Double Stars and the discovery of the _Georgium Sidus_,      were the results of that review. The third was with the same      instrument and aperture, but with a power of 460. This review      extended to all the stars of FLAMSTEED'S Catalogue, together with      every small star about them, to the amount of a great many thousands      of stars. I have, many a night, in the course of eleven or twelve      hours of observation, carefully and singly examined not less than      400 celestial objects, besides taking measures, and sometimes      viewing a particular star for half an hour together.\"    The fourth review began with the twenty-foot, in 1784.        \"My brother began his series of sweeps when the instrument was yet      in a very unfinished state, and my feelings were not very      comfortable when every moment I was alarmed by a crack or fall,      knowing him to be elevated fifteen feet or more on a temporary      cross-beam, instead of a safe gallery. The ladders had not even      their braces at the bottom; and one night, in a very high wind, he      had hardly touched the ground before the whole apparatus came down.      Some laboring men were called up to help in extricating the mirror,      which was, fortunately, uninjured, but much work was cut out for      carpenters next day. I could give a pretty long list of accidents      which were near proving fatal to my brother as well as myself. To      make observations with such large machinery, where all around is in      darkness, is not unattended with danger, especially when personal      safety is the last thing with which the mind is occupied; even poor      PIAZZI did not go home without getting broken shins by falling over      the rack-bar.        \"In the long days of the summer months many ten and seven foot      mirrors were finished; there was nothing but grinding and polishing      to be seen. For ten-foot, several had been cast with ribbed backs,      by way of experiment, to reduce the weight in large mirrors. In my      leisure hours I ground seven-foot and plain mirrors from rough to      fining down, and was _indulged_ with polishing and the last      finishing of a very beautiful mirror for Sir WILLIAM WATSON.        \"An account of the discoveries made with the twenty-foot and the      improvements of the mechanical parts of the instrument during the      winter of 1785 is given with the catalogue of the first 1,000 new      nebulae. By which account it must plainly appear that the expenses of      these improvements, and those which were yet to be made in the      apparatus of the twenty-foot (which, in fact, proved to be a model      of a larger instrument), could not be supplied out of a salary of      L200 a year, especially as my brother's finances had been too much      reduced during the six months before he received his _first_      quarterly payment of _fifty pounds_ (which was Michaelmas, 1782).      Travelling from Bath to London, Greenwich, Windsor, backwards and      forwards, transporting the telescope, etc., breaking up his      establishment at Bath and forming a new one near the court, all      this, even leaving such personal conveniences as he had for many      years been used to, out of the question, could not be obtained for a      trifle; a good large piece of ground was required for the use of the      instruments, and a habitation in which he could receive and offer a      bed to an astronomical friend, was necessary after a night's      observation.        \"It seemed to be supposed that enough had been done when my brother      was enabled to leave his profession that he might have time to make      and sell telescopes. The king ordered four ten-foot himself, and      many seven-foot besides had been bespoke, and much time had already      been expended on polishing the mirrors for the same. But all this      was only retarding the work of a thirty or forty foot instrument,      which it was my brother's chief object to obtain as soon as      possible; for he was then on the wrong side of forty-five, and felt      how great an injustice he would be doing to himself and to the cause      of astronomy by giving up his time to making telescopes for other      observers.        \"Sir WILLIAM WATSON, who often in the lifetime of his father came to      make some stay with us at Datchet, saw my brother's difficulties,      and expressed great dissatisfaction. On his return to Bath he met,      among the visitors there, several belonging to the court, to whom he      gave his opinion concerning his friend and his situation very      freely. In consequence of this, my brother had soon after, through      Sir J. BANKS, the promise that L2,000 would be granted for enabling      him to make himself an instrument.        \"Immediately every preparation for beginning the great"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29070"],[0,"Brighter Britain! (Volume 1 of 2) (#10)"],[1," having to pay him to take it away.    Our friend contemptuously examined parcel after parcel of things. Dress  suits and white waistcoats, broadcloth and doeskin, scarves and gloves,  white shirts, collars, and cuffs all appeared to move his derision. He  kicked aside a dozen pairs of boots with the remark that--    \"There's nothing there fit for this country. Rough-hide and hobnails is  what you want.\"    Certain tweed suits that the fancy of our London tailor had invested  with the title \"New Zealand Specialities\" were, said our friend, only  suitable for colonists who intended to settle on the top of the Southern  Alps. Various knick-knacks, dressing-cases, writing-cases, clocks,  etcetera, were regarded by him as contemptible lumber. Some silk socks  he looked upon almost as a criminal possession.    In the end we were reduced to a single box apiece, containing something  like the following assortment, several items of which had to be  purchased in Auckland. Six flannel shirts, two blankets, two pair  moleskin breeches, one light pilot coat, one light tweed coat and  trousers (which we wore at the time), some handkerchiefs, some socks,  two towels, brush and comb, two pairs of boots, and one pair of  leggings, a wide-awake hat, and a few odds and ends. Such books as we  had we were allowed to retain, for, although the time for reading is  very limited in the bush, yet, books being a rare commodity, are much  prized there.    Of course, there was much merriment among the colonials at our expense,  but I think the greatest mirth was excited by our cases of revolvers.  These we had brought under the idea that they would prove to be a  necessity, imagining that war with the Maoris was the normal condition  of things, and that society was constituted something like what Bret  Harte writes of in the Rocky Mountains.    We had had to pay a tax of five shillings each upon our pistols before  bringing them on shore. We were now told that this tax was a main source  of the Government revenue. Again, we were told that the exportation of  new-chums' pistols to the United States was one of the main industries  of the colony. But our purgatory was over at last, and our splendid  outfits had passed into Hebrew hands, leaving a very meagre sum of money  with us to represent them. And now we are ready to start in earnest.    Low down in the water, almost beneath the timbers of the wharf, is lying  a queer little steam-tub, the _Gemini_, which will convey us on the  first stage of our journey. A loafer on the wharf cautions us mockingly  to step aboard with care, lest we overset the little steamer, or break  through her somewhat rickety planking. She is about the size of some of  those steam-launches that puff up and down the English Thames, but she  would look rather out of place among them; for the _Gemini_ and her  sister boat, the _Eclipse_, which carry on the steam service of the  Waitemata, are neither handsome nor new. They are rough and ready boats,  very much the worse for wear. Such as they are, however, they suffice  for the limited traffic up to Riverhead, and to the districts reached  through that place. When that increases, doubtless their enterprising  owner will replace them with more serviceable craft.    Punctuality is by no means one of the chief points of the _Gemini_, and  it is an hour or two after the advertised time before we get off. There  is a good deal of snorting and shrieking, of backing and filling, on the  part of our bark, and then at last we are fairly on our way up the  river. We take a last long look at the good ship that brought us from  England, as she lies out at anchor in the harbour, and when a bend in  the river hides Auckland's streets and terraces from our view, we feel  that we have turned our backs on civilization for a while, and are fast  getting among the pioneers.    On board the _Gemini_ is a face we know. It is that of Dobbs, a sometime  shipmate of ours. He is a farm labourer from Sussex, and he and his  wife have come out among our ship-load of emigrants. There is a chronic  look of wonder on their broad English faces. They are in speechless  surprise at everything they see, but chiefly, apparently, at finding  themselves actually in a new country at all.    Dobbs touches his hat, and addresses me as \"sir,\" when he sees me, quite  forgetting that we are now in the colonies, where such modes are not  practised; regardless also of the fact that I am on my way to just the  same life and work that he is himself. The skipper of the _Gemini_  notices the action, and grins sarcastically, while he tells a  subordinate in a stage-whisper to \"just look at them new-chums.\"    English readers must not suppose from this that colonial manners are  discourteous. Far from it. Colonials will not touch their hats, or use  any form that appears to remind them of servility, flunkeyism, or  inequalities of station. On the other hand, incivility is much more  rarely experienced among even the roughest colonials than it is in many  parts of the old country, in Birmingham, for example. Apart from that,  the new-chum is the incarnate comedy of colonial life. He is eagerly  watched, and much laughed at; yet he is seldom or never subjected to any  actual rudeness. On the contrary, he is generally treated with extra  tenderness and consideration, on account of his helpless and immature  condition. Perhaps I may sum up the analysis by saying, that, if polish  is lacking to the colonial character, so also is boorishness.    Our fellow-emigrant tells us that he has been engaged as a farm labourer  by a settler at Ararimu, near Riverhead, and that his wife is to do  washing and cooking and dairy-work. They are to have thirty shillings a  week, and they, with their child, will have board and lodging provided  for them as well, and that in a style a good deal better than  agriculturals are accustomed to in England. They seem well enough  contented with things, though a trifle daunted by the strangeness of  their surroundings. Dobbs has misgivings as to the work that will be  required of him. He knows, however, that the labourer's day is reckoned  at only eight hours here, and is much consoled thereby. Very likely we  may find him a thriving farmer on his own account, and on his own land,  if we should chance to meet again in a few years' time.    There is little or no attraction in the scenery along the eighteen or  twenty miles of river between Auckland and Riverhead. Great stretches of  mud-bank are visible in many places at low tide, varied by occasional  clumps of mangrove, and by oyster-covered rocks. The land on either side  is mostly of very poor quality, though a good deal of it has been taken  up. Here and there, we pass in sight of some homestead; a white  verandah-ed wooden house, surrounded by its gardens, orchards, paddocks,  and fields. The steamer stops, and lies off three or four such places  while her dingey communicates with the shore, embarking or disembarking  passengers, mails, or goods. Generally, though, when the river-banks are  low enough to permit of a view beyond them, we see nothing but very  barren and shaggy-looking tracts, not unlike Scottish moorlands in  general aspect. Occasionally there are poor scrubby grasslands, where  the soil has not done justice to the seed put upon it; and where cattle,  horses, and sheep appear to be picking up a living among the fern and  ti-tree.    As we get nearer to Riverhead the stream narrows. This is the point to  which the tide reaches. Beyond it the Waitemata is supplied by two  creeks, the Riverhead Creek and the Rangitopuni. Here the banks are  steep and high, somewhat picturesque, with varied ferns and shrubbery.  On the north side the ranges rise into a background of hills.    This is the end of our river journey, as is evidenced by the Riverhead  wharf, built out from the bank. Here we land, and are received by two  men, who represent the population of the district, and who apparently  are idle spectators. By their advice we shoulder our traps, and climb up  some steps to the top of the bank. Right before us here is an  unpretending house, built in the usual rambling style of architecture  peculiar to frame-houses in this country. A board stuck up over the  verandah announces that this is the hotel; and, as the arrival of the  steamer is the signal for dinner, every one makes for the open French  windows of the dining-room.    Dinner is ready we find, and we are ready for it. Perhaps about a dozen  passengers came up from Auckland in the boat, and as many of these as  are not at home in the immediate neighbourhood sit down to the table.  The party is further augmented by the skipper and his assistants, the  wharf-keepers, one or two residents in the hotel, and the host and  hostess with their family. Quite a large company altogether, and of very  promiscuous elements. The only persons not entirely at their ease are  Dobbs and his wife. They find themselves dining with the \"quality,\" as  they would have said at home, and have not yet learnt that that word is  written \"equality\" in this part of the world.    At the head of the table sits somebody who is evidently a personage,  judging by the flattering attentions paid to him by the daughters of the  house, and by the regard with which all but we strangers treat him. It  is Dandy Jack, afterwards to become one of our most intimate and  cherished chums. As I shall have more to say about him, perhaps I may  here be allowed to formally introduce him to the reader.    The first glance at him reveals the origin of his sobriquet. Amid the  rawness and roughness of everything in the bush, its primitive society  included, the figure of Dandy Jack stands out in strong relief.  Contrasted with the unkempt, slovenly, ragged, and dirty bushmen with  whom he mostly comes in contact, he is the very essence of foppery. Yet,  as we are afterwards to learn, he is anything but the idle, effeminate  "]]]
