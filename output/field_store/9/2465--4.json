From now on the women are averse even to letting men pass  near them. The cactus-seekers themselves make in like manner a clean  breast of all their frailties. For every peccadillo they tie a knot  on a string, and after they have \"talked to all the five winds\" they  deliver the rosary of their sins to the leader, who burns it in the  fire.    Many of the indigenous tribes of Sarawak are firmly persuaded that  were the wives to commit adultery while their husbands are searching  for camphor in the jungle, the camphor obtained by the men would  evaporate. Husbands can discover, by certain knots in the tree, when  the wives are unfaithful; and it is said that in former days many  women were killed by jealous husbands on no better evidence than  that of these knots. Further, the wives dare not touch a comb while  their husbands are away collecting the camphor; for if they did so,  the interstices between the fibres of the tree, instead of being  filled with the precious crystals, would be empty like the spaces  between the teeth of a comb. In the Kei Islands, to the southwest of  New Guinea, as soon as a vessel that is about to sail for a distant  port has been launched, the part of the beach on which it lay is  covered as speedily as possible with palm branches, and becomes  sacred. No one may thenceforth cross that spot till the ship comes  home. To cross it sooner would cause the vessel to perish. Moreover,  all the time that the voyage lasts three or four young girls,  specially chosen for the duty, are supposed to remain in sympathetic  connexion with the mariners and to contribute by their behaviour to  the safety and success of the voyage. On no account, except for the  most necessary purpose, may they quit the room that has been  assigned to them. More than that, so long as the vessel is believed  to be at sea they must remain absolutely motionless, crouched on  their mats with their hands clasped between their knees. They may  not turn their heads to the left or to the right or make any other  movement whatsoever. If they did, it would cause the boat to pitch  and toss; and they may not eat any sticky stuff, such as rice boiled  in coco-nut milk, for the stickiness of the food would clog the  passage of the boat through the water. When the sailors are supposed  to have reached their destination, the strictness of these rules is  somewhat relaxed; but during the whole time that the voyage lasts  the girls are forbidden to eat fish which have sharp bones or  stings, such as the sting-ray, lest their friends at sea should be  involved in sharp, stinging trouble.    Where beliefs like these prevail as to the sympathetic connexion  between friends at a distance, we need not wonder that above  everything else war, with its stern yet stirring appeal to some of  the deepest and tenderest of human emotions, should quicken in the  anxious relations left behind a desire to turn the sympathetic bond  to the utmost account for the benefit of the dear ones who may at  any moment be fighting and dying far away. Hence, to secure an end  so natural and laudable, friends at home are apt to resort to  devices which will strike us as pathetic or ludicrous, according as  we consider their object or the means adopted to effect it. Thus in  some districts of Borneo, when a Dyak is out head-hunting, his wife  or, if he is unmarried, his sister must wear a sword day and night  in order that he may always be thinking of his weapons; and she may  not sleep during the day nor go to bed before two in the morning,  lest her husband or brother should thereby be surprised in his sleep  by an enemy. Among the Sea Dyaks of Banting in Sarawak the women  strictly observe an elaborate code of rules while the men are away  fighting. Some of the rules are negative and some are positive, but  all alike are based on the principles of magical homoeopathy and  telepathy. Amongst them are the following. The women must wake very  early in the morning and open the windows as soon as it is light;  otherwise their absent husbands will oversleep themselves. The women  may not oil their hair, or the men will slip. The women may neither  sleep nor doze by day, or the men will be drowsy on the march. The  women must cook and scatter popcorn on the verandah every morning;  so will the men be agile in their movements. The rooms must be kept  very tidy, all boxes being placed near the walls; for if any one  were to stumble over them, the absent husbands would fall and be at  the mercy of the foe. At every meal a little rice must be left in  the pot and put aside; so will the men far away always have  something to eat and need never go hungry. On no account may the  women sit at the loom till their legs grow cramped, otherwise their  husbands will likewise be stiff in their joints and unable to rise  up quickly or to run away from the foe. So in order to keep their  husbands' joints supple the women often vary their labours at the  loom by walking up and down the verandah. Further, they may not  cover up their faces, or the men would not to be able to find their  way through the tall grass or jungle. Again, the women may not sew  with a needle, or the men will tread on the sharp spikes set by the  enemy in the path. Should a wife prove unfaithful while her husband  is away, he will lose his life in the enemy's country. Some years  ago all these rules and more were observed by the women of Banting,  while their husbands were fighting for the English against rebels.  But alas! these tender precautions availed them little; for many a  man, whose faithful wife was keeping watch and ward for him at home,  found a soldier's grave.    In the island of Timor, while war is being waged, the high-priest  never quits the temple; his food is brought to him or cooked inside;  day and night he must keep the fire burning, for if he were to let  it die out, disaster would be fall the warriors and would continue  so long as the hearth was cold. Moreover, he must drink only hot  water during the time the army is absent; for every draught of cold  water would damp the spirits of the people, so that they could not  vanquish the enemy. In the Kei Islands, when the warriors have  departed, the women return indoors and bring out certain baskets  containing fruits and stones. These fruits and stones they anoint  and place on a board, murmuring as they do so, \"O lord sun, moon,  let the bullets rebound from our husbands, brothers, betrothed, and  other relations, just as raindrops rebound from these objects which  are smeared with oil.\" As soon as the first shot is heard, the  baskets are put aside, and the women, seizing their fans, rush out  of the houses. Then, waving their fans in the direction of the  enemy, they run through the village, while they sing, \"O golden  fans! let our bullets hit, and those of the enemy miss.\" In this  custom the ceremony of anointing stones, in order that the bullets  may recoil from the men like raindrops from the stones, is a piece  of pure homoeopathic or imitative magic; but the prayer to the sun,  that he will be pleased to give effect to the charm, is a religious  and perhaps later addition. The waving of the fans seems to be a  charm to direct the bullets towards or away from their mark,  according as they are discharged from the guns of friends or foes.    An old historian of Madagascar informs us that \"while the men are at  the wars, and until their return, the women and girls cease not day  and night to dance, and neither lie down nor take food in their own  houses. And although they are very voluptuously inclined, they would  not for anything in the world have an intrigue with another man  while their husband is at the war, believing firmly that if that  happened, their husband would be either killed or wounded. They  believe that by dancing they impart strength, courage, and good  fortune to their husbands; accordingly during such times they give  themselves no rest, and this custom they observe very religiously.\"    Among the Tshi-speaking peoples of the Gold Coast the wives of men  who are away with the army paint themselves white, and adorn their  persons with beads and charms. On the day when a battle is expected  to take place, they run about armed with guns, or sticks carved to  look like guns, and taking green paw-paws (fruits shaped somewhat  like a melon), they hack them with knives, as if they were chopping  off the heads of the foe. The pantomime is no doubt merely an  imitative charm, to enable the men to do to the enemy as the women  do to the paw-paws. In the West African town of Framin, while the  Ashantee war was raging some years ago, Mr. Fitzgerald Marriott saw  a dance performed by women whose husbands had gone as carriers to  the war. They were painted white and wore nothing but a short  petticoat. At their head was a shrivelled old sorceress in a very  short white petticoat, her black hair arranged in a sort of long  projecting horn, and her black face, breasts, arms, and legs  profusely adorned with white circles and crescents. All carried long  white brushes made of buffalo or horse tails, and as they danced  they sang, \"Our husbands have gone to Ashanteeland; may they sweep  their enemies off the face of the earth!\"    Among the Thompson Indians of British Columbia, when the men were on  the war-path, the women performed dances at frequent intervals.  These dances were believed to ensure the success of the expedition.  The dancers flourished their knives, threw long sharp-pointed sticks  forward, or drew sticks with hooked ends repeatedly backward and  forward. Throwing the sticks forward was symbolic of piercing or  warding off the enemy, and drawing them back was symbolic of drawing  their own men from danger. The hook at the end of the stick was  particularly well adapted to serve the purpose of a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36299"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage: King AEthelbert - King George III, 600 A.D. - 1776 (#10)"],[1,"s, and  was then known as \"loenland\".         Ploughs and wagons could be drawn by four or more oxen or horses in  sets of two behind each other. Oxenshoes and horseshoes prevented  lameness due to cracked hooves. Horse collars especially fitted for  horses, replaced oxen yoke that had been used on horses. The horse  collar did not restrict breathing and enabled horses to use the same  strength of oxen. Also, horses had better endurance and faster speed.         A free holder's house was wood, perhaps with a stone foundation, and  roofed with thatch or tiles. There was a main room or hall, with bed  chambers around it. Beyond was the kitchen, perhaps outside under a  lean-to. These buildings were surrounded by a bank or stiff hedge.         Simple people lived in huts made from wood and mud, with one door and  no windows. They slept around a wood-burning fire in the middle of the  earthen floor. They wore shapeless clothes of goat hair and unprocessed  wool from their sheep. They ate rough brown bread, vegetable and grain  broth, ale from barley, bacon, beans, milk, cabbage, onion, apples,  plums, cherries, and honey for sweetening or mead. Vegetables grown in  the country included onions, leeks, celery, lettuce, radish, carrots,  garlic, shallots, parsnip, dill, chervil, marigold, coriander, and  poppy. In the summer, they ate boiled or raw veal and wild fowl such as  ducks, geese, or pigeons, and game snared in the forest. Poultry was a  luxury food, but recognized as therapeutic for invalids, especially in  broth form [chicken soup]. Venison was highly prized. There were still  some wild boar, which were hunted with long spears, a greyhound dog, and  hunting horns. They sometimes mated with the domestic pigs which roamed  the woodlands. In September, the old and infirm pigs were slaughtered  and their sides of bacon smoked in the rafters for about a month. Their  intestines provided skin for sausages. In the fall, cattle were  slaughtered and salted for food during the winter because there was no  more pasture for them. However, some cows and breed animals were kept  through the winter.         For their meals, people used wooden platters, sometimes earthenware  plates, drinking horns, drinking cups from ash or alderwood turned on a  foot-peddled pole lathe, and bottles made of leather. Their bowls, pans,  and pitchers were made by the potter's wheel. Water could be boiled in  pots made of iron, brass, lead, or clay. Water could be carried in  leather bags because leather working preservative techniques improved so  that tanning prevented stretching or decaying. At the back of each hut  was a hole in the ground used as a latrine, which flies frequented. Moss  was used for toilet paper. Parasitical worms in the stool were  ubiquitous.         Most of the simple people lived in villages of about 20 homes circling  a village green or lining a single winding lane. There were only first  names, and these were usually passed down family lines. To grind their  grain, the villagers used hand mills with crank and gear, or a communal  mill, usually built of oak, driven by power transmitted through a solid  oak shaft, banded with iron as reinforcement, to internal gear wheels of  elm. Almost every village had a watermill. It might be run by water  shooting over or flowing under the wheel.         Clothing for men and women was made from coarse wool, silk, and linen  and was usually brown in color. Only the wealthy could afford to wear  linen or silk. Men also wore leather clothing, such as neckpieces,  breeches, ankle leathers, shoes, and boots. Boots were worn when  fighting. They carried knives or axes under metal belts. They could  carry items by tying leather pouches onto their belts with their  drawstrings. They wore leather gloves for warmth and for heavy working  with their hands.         People were as tall, strong and healthy as in the late 1900s, not  having yet endured the later malnourishment and overcrowding that was  its worst in the 1700s and 1800s. Their teeth were very healthy. Most  adults died in their 40s, after becoming arthritic from hard labor.  People in their 50s were deemed venerable. Boys of twelve were  considered old enough to swear an oath of allegiance to the king. Girls  married in their early teens, often to men significantly older.         The lands of the large landholding lords were administered by freemen.  They had wheat, barley, oats, and rye fields, orchards, vineyards for  wine, and beekeeping areas for honey. On this land lived not only farm  laborers, cattle herders, shepherds, goatherds, and pigherds, but  craftsmen such as goldsmiths, hawkkeepers, dogkeepers, horsekeepers,  huntsmen, foresters, builders, weaponsmiths, embroiders, bronze smiths,  blacksmiths, watermill wrights, wheelwrights, wagon wrights, iron nail  makers, potters, soap makers (made from wood ashes reacting chemically  with fats or oils), tailors, shoemakers, salters (made salt at the  \"wyches\", which later became towns ending with '-wich'), bakers, cooks,  and gardeners. Most men did carpentry work. Master carpenters worked  with ax, hammer, and saw to make houses, doors, bridges, milk buckets,  washtubs, and trunks. Blacksmiths made gates, huge door hinges, locks,  latches, bolts, and horseshoes. The lord loaned these people land on  which to live for their life, called a \"life estate\", in return for  their services. The loan could continue to their widows or children who  took up the craft. Mills were usually powered by water. Candles were  made from beeswax, which exuded a bright and steady light and pleasant  smell, or from mutton fat, which had an unpleasant odor. The wheeled  plough and iron-bladed plough made the furrows. One man held the plough  and another walked with the oxen, coaxing them forward with a stick and  shouts. Seeds were held in an apron for seeding. Farm implements  included spades, shovels, rakes, hoes, buckets, barrels, flails, and  sieves. Plants were pruned to direct their growth and to increase their  yield. Everyone got together for feasts at key stages of the farming,  such as the harvest. Easter was the biggest feast. When the lord was in  the field, his lady held their estate. There were common lands of these  estates as well as of communities. Any proposed new settler had to be  admitted at the court of this estate.         The land of some lords included fishing villages along the coasts. From  the sea were caught herrings, salmon, porpoises, sturgeon, oysters,  crabs, mussels, cockles, winkles, plaice, flounder, and lobsters.  Sometimes whales were driven into an inlet by many boats. River fish  included eels, pike, minnows, burbot, trout, and lampreys. They were  caught by brushwood weirs, net, bait, hooks, and baskets. Oysters were  so numerous that they were eaten by the poor. The king's peace extended  over the waterways. If mills, fisheries, weirs, or other structures were  set up to block them, they were to be destroyed and a penalty paid to  the king.         Other lords had land with iron mining industries. Ore was dug from the  ground and combined with wood charcoal in a shaft furnace to be smelted  into liquid form. Wood charcoal was derived from controlled charring of  the wood at high temperatures without using oxygen. This burned  impurities from it and left a purer carbon, which burned better than  wood. The pure iron was extracted from this liquid and formed into bars.  To keep the fire hot, the furnaces were frequently placed at windswept  crossings of valleys or on the tops of hills.         Some lords had markets on their land, for which they charged a toll for  participation. There were about fifty markets in the nation. Cattle and  slaves (from the word \"slav\") were the usual medium of exchange. An ox  was still worth about 30d. Shaking hands was symbolic of an agreement  for a sale, which had to be carried out in front of witnesses at the  market for any property worth over 20d. The higher the value of the  property, the more witnesses were required. Witnesses were also required  for the exchange of property and to vouch for cattle having being born  on the property of a person claiming them. People traveled to markets on  deep, sunken roads and narrow bridges kept in repair by certain men who  did this work as their service to the King. The king's peace extended to  a couple of high roads, i.e. highways, running the length of the country  and a couple running its width.         Salt was used throughout the nation to preserve meat over the winter.  Inland saltworks had an elaborate and specialized organization. The  chief one used saltpans and furnaces to extract salt from natural brine  springs. They formed little manufacturing enclaves in the midst of  agricultural land, and they were considered to be neither large private  estates headed by a lord nor appurtenant to such. They belonged jointly  to the king and the local earl, who shared, at a proportion of two to  one, the proceeds of the tolls upon the sale of salt and methods of  carriage on the ancient salt ways according to cartload, horse load, or  man load. Sometimes there were investors in a portion of the works who  lived quite at distance away. The sales of salt were mostly retail, but  some bought to resell. Peddlers carried salt to sell from village to  village.         Some smiths traveled for their work, for instance, stonewrights  building arches and windows in churches, and lead workers putting lead  roofs on churches.         An example of a grant of hides of land is: \"[God has endowed King Edred  with England], wherefore he enriches and honors men, both ecclesiastic  and lay, who can justly deserve it. The truth of this can be  acknowledged by the thegn AElfsige Hunlafing through his acquisition of  the estate of 5 hides at Alwalton for himself and his heirs, free from  every burden except the repair of fortifications, the building of  bridges and military service; a prudent"]]]
