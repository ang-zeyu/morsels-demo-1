Exploration and discovery do not  constitute the whole business of astronomy; the less adventurous, though  not less arduous, task of gaining a more and more complete mastery over  the problems immemorially presented to her, may, on the contrary, be  said to form her primary duty. A knowledge of the movements of the  heavenly bodies has, from the earliest times, been demanded by the  urgent needs of mankind; and science finds its advantage, as in many  cases it has taken its origin, in condescension to practical claims.  Indeed, to bring such knowledge as near as possible to absolute  precision has been defined by no mean authority[58] as the true end of  astronomy.    Several causes concurred about the beginning of the last century to give  a fresh and powerful impulse to investigations having this end in view.  The rapid progress of theory almost compelled a corresponding advance in  observation; instrumental improvements rendered such an advance  possible; Herschel's discoveries quickened public interest in celestial  inquiries; royal, imperial, and grand-ducal patronage widened the scope  of individual effort. The heart of the new movement was in Germany.  Hitherto the observatory of Flamsteed and Bradley had been the  acknowledged centre of practical astronomy; Greenwich observations were  the standard of reference all over Europe; and the art of observing  prospered in direct proportion to the fidelity with which Greenwich  methods were imitated. Dr. Maskelyne, who held the post of Astronomer  Royal during forty-six years (from 1765 to 1811), was no unworthy  successor to the eminent men who had gone before him. His foundation of  the _Nautical Almanac_ (in 1767) alone constitutes a valid title to  fame; he introduced at the Observatory the important innovation of the  systematic publication of results; and the careful and prolonged series  of observations executed by him formed the basis of the improved  theories, and corrected tables of the celestial movements, which were  rapidly being brought to completion abroad. His catalogue of thirty-six  \"fundamental\" stars was besides excellent in its way, and most  serviceable. Yet he was devoid of Bradley's instinct for divining the  needs of the future. He was fitted rather to continue a tradition than  to found a school. The old ways were dear to him; and, indefatigable as  he was, a definite purpose was wanting to compel him, by its exigencies,  along the path of progress. Thus, for almost fifty years after Bradley's  death, the acquisition of a small achromatic[59] was the only notable  change made in the instrumental equipment of the Observatory. The  transit, the zenith sector, and the mural quadrant, with which Bradley  had done his incomparable work, retained their places long after they  had become deteriorated by time and obsolete by the progress of  invention; and it was not until the very close of his career that  Maskelyne, compelled by Pond's detection of serious errors, ordered a  Troughton's circle, which he did not live to employ.    Meanwhile, the heavy national disasters with which Germany was  overwhelmed in the early part of the nineteenth century seemed to  stimulate rather than impede the intellectual revival already for some  years in progress there. Astronomy was amongst the first of the sciences  to feel the new impulse. By the efforts of Bode, Olbers, Schroeter, and  Von Zach, just and elevated ideas on the subject were propagated,  intelligence was diffused, and a firm ground prepared for common action  in mutual sympathy and disinterested zeal. They received powerful aid  through the foundation, in 1804, by a young artillery officer named Von  Reichenbach, of an Optical and Mechanical Institute at Munich. Here the  work of English instrumental artists was for the first time rivalled,  and that of English opticians--when Fraunhofer entered the new  establishment--far surpassed. The development given to the refracting  telescope by this extraordinary man was indispensable to the progress of  that fundamental part of astronomy which consists in the exact  determination of the places of the heavenly bodies. Reflectors are  brilliant engines of discovery, but they lend themselves with difficulty  to the prosaic work of measuring right ascensions and polar distances. A  signal improvement in the art of making and working flint-glass thus  most opportunely coincided with the rise of a German school of  scientific mechanicians, to furnish the instrumental means needed for  the reform which was at hand. Of the leader of that reform it is now  time to speak.    Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel was born at Minden, in Westphalia, July 22,  1784. A certain taste for figures, coupled with a still stronger  distaste for the Latin accidence, directed his inclination and his  father's choice towards a mercantile career. In his fifteenth year,  accordingly, he entered the house of Kuhlenkamp and Sons, in Bremen, as  an apprenticed clerk. He was now thrown completely upon his own  resources. From his father, a struggling Government official, heavily  weighted with a large family, he was well aware that he had nothing to  expect; his dormant faculties were roused by the necessity for  self-dependence, and he set himself to push manfully forward along the  path that lay before him. The post of supercargo on one of the trading  expeditions sent out from the Hanseatic towns to China and the East  Indies was the aim of his boyish ambition, for the attainment of which  he sought to qualify himself by the industrious acquisition of suitable  and useful knowledge. He learned English in two or three months; picked  up Spanish with the casual aid of a gunsmith's apprentice; studied the  geography of the distant lands which he hoped to visit; collected  information as to their climates, inhabitants, products, and the courses  of trade. He desired to add some acquaintance with the art (then much  neglected) of taking observations at sea; and thus, led on from  navigation to astronomy, and from astronomy to mathematics, he groped  his way into a new world.    It was characteristic of him that the practical problems of science  should have attracted him before his mind was as yet sufficiently  matured to feel the charm of its abstract beauties. His first attempt at  observation was made with a sextant, rudely constructed under his own  directions, and a common clock. Its object was the determination of the  longitude of Bremen, and its success, he tells us himself,[60] filled  him with a rapture of delight, which, by confirming his tastes, decided  his destiny. He now eagerly studied Bode's _Jahrbuch_ and Von Zach's  _Monatliche Correspondenz_, overcoming each difficulty as it arose with  the aid of Lalande's _Traite d'Astronomie_, and supplying, with amazing  rapidity, his early deficiency in mathematical training. In two years he  was able to attack a problem which would have tasked the patience, if  not the skill, of the most experienced astronomer. Amongst the Earl of  Egremont's papers Von Zach had discovered Harriot's observations on  Halley's comet at its appearance in 1607, and published them as a  supplement to Bode's Annual. With an elaborate care inspired by his  youthful ardour, though hardly merited by their loose nature, Bessel  deduced from them an orbit for that celebrated body, and presented the  work to Olbers, whose reputation in cometary researches gave a special  fitness to the proffered homage. The benevolent physician-astronomer of  Bremen welcomed with surprised delight such a performance emanating from  such a source. Fifteen years previously, the French Academy had crowned  a similar work; now its equal was produced by a youth of twenty, busily  engaged in commercial pursuits, self-taught, and obliged to snatch from  sleep the hours devoted to study. The paper was immediately sent to Von  Zach for publication, with a note from Olbers explaining the  circumstances of its author; and the name of Bessel became the common  property of learned Europe.    He had, however, as yet no intention of adopting astronomy as his  profession. For two years he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28257"],[0,"The Story of the Great War, Volume 1 (#10)"],[1,"Turkey being the Padishah or head of the  Mohammedan faith.    At least Britain would be forced to maintain larger garrisons than  usual both in Egypt and India against any threat of insurrection.  Among all who have had to deal with the Oriental peoples, and  particularly those who know them as intimately as the British rulers  of India, the importance of power--and publicly demonstrated  power--is fully understood. To the average British Indian or  Egyptian subject, Britain has been an unconquerable country, the  mistress of the world.    Many reasons united in calling for some action on the part of the  British to offset that of the Germans. With Russia in retreat the  Balkan States, which had regarded her prowess as irresistible, were  losing their faith in the Allies. One successful blow would do more  to dispel their skepticism and to bring Italy in on the side of the  Allies than sheafs of diplomatic cablegrams and notes. During such a  crisis every message in the game of war diplomacy becomes only a  polite calling card that represents armed men.    The British decided to take the initiative though their new army had  as yet received hardly sufficient training to make them soldiers and  their supply of rifles, guns and munitions was insufficient. Indeed,  England was just beginning to awaken fully to the fact that the  forces of France and Russia alone were insufficient to cope on land  with the Central Powers, particularly now that the weight of Turkey  was thrown in the balance.    With her casualties three times the number of her original  expeditionary force, with more than the original number of her army  engaged in Flanders, she undertook an offensive against  Constantinople itself. Second-class men-of-war which were not  required with the grand fleet and a single first-class dreadnought  of the latest type, the _Queen Elizabeth_, in conjunction with a  French squadron, bombarded and reduced the ancient forts at the  entrance to the Dardanelles and then attacked those in the narrows.  British bluejackets even smoked their pipes and cracked jokes as  they sat on the crest of Achi Baba, which became an impregnable  Turkish position after the British Mediterranean force was landed.  Had the _Queen Elizabeth_ been able to fire an army corps ashore,  the corps could have marched on into Constantinople.    The success or failure of the Gallipoli expedition depended upon  surprise. Superficially it seems a colossal blunder. There are  inside facts about it which have never been disclosed. Greece, it is  supposed, agreed to send troops, but at the last moment changed her  mind. Undoubtedly the expedition was an important influence in  bringing Italy in. There was a fatal delay in its departure from  Alexandria. Too much time elapsed between the preparatory  bombardment and the landing. The Turks had been forewarned what to  expect. They had leisure for concentration and preparation. On a  narrow front of difficult shore where the landing was to be made,  they had stretched their barbed-wire entanglements into the sea  itself, while along the beach were carefully concealed machine guns  and back of them ample forces of men and artillery.    No effort in history was ever more gallant than that of the British  force, including the Australians, which threw itself ashore in the  face of simply insurmountable obstacles and fire, under the cover of  the guns of the men-of-war. As a surprise, the affair was a complete  failure. Its only chance of success being as a surprise, most  competent military leaders and experts agree that this was  sufficient reason, in a military sense, for an immediate withdrawal;  yet British stubbornness would not yield.    Indeed, the Gallipoli expedition was a political move, a violation  of the true military principle--that you should always go against  the main body of your enemy, which was at this time on the frontiers  of Russia and France. Of course the effort was not entirely without  its compensations; no expedition is, which holds any part of the  enemy's troops in place in front of your own. The pressure was  withdrawn from the Russians in the Caucasus and also further  adventures from the outskirts of Asia Minor toward India in stirring  up the Mohammedan population were for the time abated.    The attempt to reach the heart of Turkish power, the sultan's  capital itself, by opening these famous straits and sending British  ships to lay Constantinople under their guns, was a splendid  conception worthy the military imagination of the daring ages when  the British Empire was built and the days of the Spanish Main, but  the only criterion in the ghastly business of war remains success.    Yet the spring of 1915 opened with no rebellion in India except  sporadic outbreaks of the frontier tribes which are always  recurring, while Egypt itself remained peaceful. The Germans  inaugurated their second year's campaign by closing the Belgo-Dutch  frontier and by the administrative use of every possible means for  safeguarding their movements on the western front, which would  indicate that they were to undertake another effort for the Channel  ports. This was an obvious feint to conceal an effort elsewhere.  Instead of using troops to make it, they tried out for the first  time a form of warfare which was not new in the consideration of any  army, though it had not been used because it was considered inhuman.    With the wind blowing in the right direction, the Germans released  an immense cloud of chlorine gas. Its gravity held it close to the  ground as it swept down upon the British and French in the famous  Ypres salient. The effort was successful beyond their expectation,  more successful than they realized and had they had sufficient  reserves to press on, they might have broken the allied line at this  point.    The effect of the gas was that of a horrible form of asphyxiation;  the soldiers who did not succumb retreated in face of a weapon which  could not be countered by any in their possession. The casualties  were heavy, the sufferings of the wounded indescribable in their  torment. From the military point of view, which holds that war is  killing and that any method whatsoever is warrantable, the attack  was a success as it gained ground, and for the time being confused  the enemy. But it was a form of attack which could succeed only  once. After the soldiers were provided with proper respirators  containing a chemical antidote, they were in no danger of being  \"gassed.\" Among those in the thick of the gas attack were the first  Canadian contingent, who bore themselves with unflinching fortitude,  not only that, but after the first surprise of the attack was over,  the survivors charged with rare heroism.    Strategy which formerly meant the swift movement of a few thousand  troops to one flank or another overnight, or in a two or three-hour  march, now means the concentration of hundreds of thousands by  railway trains upon a particular point and of many thousands of guns  and enormous quantities of material of every kind from shells to  that for building railroads to keep up with your advance.    But the general of to-day no less than the general of yesterday,  would always know where his enemy is most vulnerable, and strike him  at that point. In the spring of 1915, the line of least resistance  for the German army was obviously to the east where the loose  organization of the Russian army, lacking munitions, was stretched  over a front of over a thousand miles.    The French were better off in munitions, and their army and the  British had a front of four hundred and fifty miles of intact trench  line. It is estimated that in order to hold a battle front with  modern troops, about three thousand men to the mile are required.  This does not mean that there are three thousand actually on every  mile; but counting the thin line in the trenches, the thicker line  in the reserve trenches and the soldiers who are out of the trenches  resting and the battalions in reserve and the reserve supplies of  men in the depots who can promptly be brought into action.    For example, to hold a mile of the famous Ypres salient might  require double the number of men necessary to hold a mile where the  lay of the ground was in the favor of your troops. Owing to the use  of motor trucks and to railway trains, whenever there is an attack,  concentration of men at any point is very rapid. Holding to this  rule, the Germans maintained all through the summer of 1915,  1,500,000 men on their western front, and they had that number at  least to spare for their eastern front. Field Marshal von Hindenburg  said that by hammering he would get Warsaw, and he was to keep his  word with stolid German persistence. Napoleon, who had depended upon  the number of his guns, would have fully appreciated the  Austro-German plan of action against Russia.    The Russian army has been compared to cotton wool. The farther you  went into Russia, the more cotton wool there was. The Russian army  would yield, but there never seemed any end of it. Gaining a passive  victory over the Russian army has also been compared to brushing the  snow off the front doorstep. The more you brushed, the more snow  banked up. Russia could afford to lose territory equivalent to the  area of all France without having received a vital blow. Russia has  plenty of room in which to retreat, as Napoleon learned. She is  confident in the safety of her distances. When the enemy falls back  she follows on his heels.    At the end of the winter, 1914-15, she was still in the possession  of a large portion of Galicia. But the Germans were preparing a  battering ram which their generals thought irresistible. Their plan  now was to deliver so hard a blow at the Russian that he would be  forced to yield a separate peace. Von Mackensen formed his  unprecedented phalanx of soldiery and of artillery in Galicia and  destroying all the"]]]
