Ralph was sitting there in the clear gloom, at the base of a  statue of Terpsichore--a dancing nymph with taper fingers and inflated  draperies in the manner of Bernini; the extreme relaxation of his  attitude suggested at first to Isabel that he was asleep. Her light  footstep on the grass had not roused him, and before turning away she  stood for a moment looking at him. During this instant he opened his  eyes; upon which she sat down on a rustic chair that matched with his  own. Though in her irritation she had accused him of indifference she  was not blind to the fact that he had visibly had something to brood  over. But she had explained his air of absence partly by the languor of  his increased weakness, partly by worries connected with the property  inherited from his father--the fruit of eccentric arrangements of  which Mrs. Touchett disapproved and which, as she had told Isabel, now  encountered opposition from the other partners in the bank. He ought to  have gone to England, his mother said, instead of coming to Florence;  he had not been there for months, and took no more interest in the bank  than in the state of Patagonia.    \"I'm sorry I waked you,\" Isabel said; \"you look too tired.\"    \"I feel too tired. But I was not asleep. I was thinking of you.\"    \"Are you tired of that?\"    \"Very much so. It leads to nothing. The road's long and I never arrive.\"    \"What do you wish to arrive at?\" she put to him, closing her parasol.    \"At the point of expressing to myself properly what I think of your  engagement.\"    \"Don't think too much of it,\" she lightly returned.    \"Do you mean that it's none of my business?\"    \"Beyond a certain point, yes.\"    \"That's the point I want to fix. I had an idea you may have found me  wanting in good manners. I've never congratulated you.\"    \"Of course I've noticed that. I wondered why you were silent.\"    \"There have been a good many reasons. I'll tell you now,\" Ralph said.  He pulled off his hat and laid it on the ground; then he sat looking at  her. He leaned back under the protection of Bernini, his head against  his marble pedestal, his arms dropped on either side of him, his hands  laid upon the rests of his wide chair. He looked awkward, uncomfortable;  he hesitated long. Isabel said nothing; when people were embarrassed she  was usually sorry for them, but she was determined not to help Ralph to  utter a word that should not be to the honour of her high decision. \"I  think I've hardly got over my surprise,\" he went on at last. \"You were  the last person I expected to see caught.\"    \"I don't know why you call it caught.\"    \"Because you're going to be put into a cage.\"    \"If I like my cage, that needn't trouble you,\" she answered.    \"That's what I wonder at; that's what I've been thinking of.\"    \"If you've been thinking you may imagine how I've thought! I'm satisfied  that I'm doing well.\"    \"You must have changed immensely. A year ago you valued your liberty  beyond everything. You wanted only to see life.\"    \"I've seen it,\" said Isabel. \"It doesn't look to me now, I admit, such  an inviting expanse.\"    \"I don't pretend it is; only I had an idea that you took a genial view  of it and wanted to survey the whole field.\"    \"I've seen that one can't do anything so general. One must choose a  corner and cultivate that.\"    \"That's what I think. And one must choose as good a corner as possible.  I had no idea, all winter, while I read your delightful letters, that  you were choosing. You said nothing about it, and your silence put me  off my guard.\"    \"It was not a matter I was likely to write to you about. Besides, I knew  nothing of the future. It has all come lately. If you had been on your  guard, however,\" Isabel asked, \"what would you have done?\"    \"I should have said 'Wait a little longer.'\"    \"Wait for what?\"    \"Well, for a little more light,\" said Ralph with rather an absurd smile,  while his hands found their way into his pockets.    \"Where should my light have come from? From you?\"    \"I might have struck a spark or two.\"    Isabel had drawn off her gloves; she smoothed them out as they lay  upon her knee. The mildness of this movement was accidental, for her  expression was not conciliatory. \"You're beating about the bush, Ralph.  You wish to say you don't like Mr. Osmond, and yet you're afraid.\"    \"Willing to wound and yet afraid to strike? I'm willing to wound HIM,  yes--but not to wound you. I'm afraid of you, not of him. If you marry  him it won't be a fortunate way for me to have spoken.\"    \"IF I marry him! Have you had any expectation of dissuading me?\"    \"Of course that seems to you too fatuous.\"    \"No,\" said Isabel after a little; \"it seems to me too touching.\"    \"That's the same thing. It makes me so ridiculous that you pity me.\"    She stroked out her long gloves again. \"I know you've a great affection  for me. I can't get rid of that.\"    \"For heaven's sake don't try. Keep that well in sight. It will convince  you how intensely I want you to do well.\"    \"And how little you trust me!\"    There was a moment's silence; the warm noontide seemed to listen. \"I  trust you, but I don't trust him,\" said Ralph.    She raised her eyes and gave him a wide, deep look. \"You've said it now,  and I'm glad you've made it so clear. But you'll suffer by it.\"    \"Not if you're just.\"    \"I'm very just,\" said Isabel. \"What better proof of it can there be than  that I'm not angry with you? I don't know what's the matter with me, but  I'm not. I was when you began, but it has passed away. Perhaps I ought  to be angry, but Mr. Osmond wouldn't think so. He wants me to know  everything; that's what I like him for. You've nothing to gain, I know  that. I've never been so nice to you, as a girl, that you should have  much reason for wishing me to remain one. You give very good advice;  you've often done so. No, I'm very quiet; I've always believed in your  wisdom,\" she went on, boasting of her quietness, yet speaking with a  kind of contained exaltation. It was her passionate desire to be  just; it touched Ralph to the heart, affected him like a caress from a  creature he had injured. He wished to interrupt, to reassure her; for a  moment he was absurdly inconsistent; he would have retracted what he had  said. But she gave him no chance; she went on, having caught a glimpse,  as she thought, of the heroic line and desiring to advance in that  direction. \"I see you've some special idea; I should like very much to  hear it. I'm sure it's disinterested; I feel that. It seems a strange  thing to argue about, and of course I ought to tell you definitely that  if you expect to dissuade me you may give it up. You'll not move me  an inch; it's too late. As you say, I'm caught. Certainly it won't be  pleasant for you to remember this, but your pain will be in your own  thoughts. I shall never reproach you.\"    \"I don't think you ever will,\" said Ralph. \"It's not in the least the  sort of marriage I thought you'd make.\"    \"What sort of marriage was that, pray?\"    \"Well, I can hardly say. I hadn't exactly a positive view of it, but I  had a negative. I didn't think you'd decide for--well, for that type.\"    \"What's the matter with Mr. Osmond's type, if it be one? His being  so independent, so individual, is what I most see in him,\" the girl  declared. \"What do you know against him? You know him scarcely at all.\"    \"Yes,\" Ralph said, \"I know him very little, and I confess I haven't  facts and items to prove him a villain. But all the same I can't help  feeling that you're running a grave risk.\"    \"Marriage is always a grave risk, and his risk's as grave as mine.\"    \"That's his affair! If he's afraid, let him back out. I wish to God he  would.\"    Isabel reclined in her chair, folding her arms and gazing a while at her  cousin. \"I don't think I understand you,\" she said at last coldly. \"I  don't know what you're talking about.\"    \"I believed you'd marry a man of more importance.\"    Cold, I say, her tone had been, but at this a colour like a flame leaped  into her face. \"Of more importance to whom? It seems to me enough that  one's husband should be of importance to one's self!\"    Ralph blushed as well; his attitude embarrassed him. Physically speaking  he proceeded to change it; he straightened himself, then leaned forward,  resting a hand on each knee. He fixed his eyes on the ground; he had an  air of the most respectful deliberation.    \"I'll tell you in a moment what I mean,\" he presently said. He felt  agitated, intensely eager; now that he had opened the discussion he  wished to discharge his mind. But he wished also to be superlatively  gentle.    Isabel waited a little--then she went on with majesty. \"In everything  that makes one care for people Mr. Osmond is pre-eminent. There may  be nobler natures, but I've never had the pleasure of meeting one. Mr.  Osmond's is the finest I know; he's good enough for me, and interesting  enough, and clever enough. I'm far more struck with what he has and what  he represents than with what he may lack.\"    \"I had treated myself to a charming vision of your future,\" Ralph  observed without answering this; \"I had amused myself with planning out  a high destiny for you. There was to be nothing of this sort in it. You  were not to come down so easily or so soon.\"    \"Come down, you say?\"    \"Well, that renders my sense of what has happened to you. You seemed to  me to be soaring far up in the blue--to be, sailing in the bright light,  over the heads of men. Suddenly some one tosses up a faded rosebud--a  missile that should never have reached you--and straight you drop to  the ground. It hurts me,\" said Ralph audaciously, \"hurts me as if I had  fallen myself!\"    The look of pain and bewilderment deepened in his companion's face. \"I  don't understand you in the least,\" she repeated. \"You say you amused  yourself with a project for my career--I don't"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28346"],[0,"Deathworld (#10)"],[1," up.    \"This is Grif,\" Brucco said. \"He will stay with you, wherever you go,  from now on.\"    \"My personal bodyguard?\" Jason asked, looking down at the stocky child  who barely reached his waist.    \"You might call him that.\" Brucco swung the door open. \"Grif tangled  with a sawbird, so he won't be able to do any real work for a while. You  yourself admitted that you will never be able to equal a Pyrran, so you  should be glad of a little protection.\"    \"Always a kind word, that's you, Brucco,\" Jason said. He bent over and  shook hands with the boy. Even the eight-year-olds had a bone-crushing  grip.    The two of them entered the lock and Brucco swung the inner door shut  behind them. As soon as it was sealed the outer door opened  automatically. It was only partly open when Grif's gun blasted twice.  Then they stepped out onto the surface of Pyrrus, over the smoking body  of one of its animals.    Very symbolic, Jason thought. He was also bothered by the realization  that he hadn't remembered to look for something coming in. Then, too, he  couldn't even identify the beast from its charred remains. He glanced  around, hoping he would be able to fire first himself, next time.    This was an unfulfilled hope. The few beasts that came their way were  always seen first by the boy. After an hour of this, Jason was so  irritated that he blasted an evil-looking thorn plant out of existence.  He hoped that Grif wouldn't look too closely at it. Of course the boy  did.    \"That plant wasn't close. It is stupid to waste good ammunition on a  plant,\" Grif said.    There was no real trouble during the day. Jason ended by being bored,  though soaked by the frequent rainstorms. If Grif was capable of  carrying on a conversation, he didn't show it. All Jason's gambits  failed. The following day went the same way. On the third day, Brucco  appeared and looked Jason carefully up and down.    \"I don't like to say it, but I suppose you are as ready to leave now as  you ever will be. Change the virus filter noseplugs every day. Always  check boots for tears and metalcloth suiting for rips. Medikit supplies  renewed once a week.\"    \"And wipe my nose and wear my galoshes. Anything else?\" Jason asked.    Brucco started to say something, then changed his mind. \"Nothing that  you shouldn't know well by now. Keep alert. And ... good luck.\" He  followed up the words with a crushing handshake that was totally  unexpected. As soon as the numbness left Jason's hand, he and Grif went  out through the large entrance lock.          IX.      Real as they had been, the training chambers had not prepared him for  the surface of Pyrrus. There was the basic similarity of course. The  feel of the poison grass underfoot and the erratic flight of a stingwing  in the last instant before Grif blasted it. But these were scarcely  noticeable in the crash of the elements around him.    A heavy rain was falling, more like a sheet of water than individual  drops. Gusts of wind tore at it, hurling the deluge into his face. He  wiped his eyes clear and could barely make out the conical forms of two  volcanoes on the horizon, vomiting out clouds of smoke and flame. The  reflection of this inferno was a sullen redness on the clouds that raced  by in banks above them.    There was a rattle on his hard hat and something bounced off to splash  to the ground. He bent over and picked up a hailstone as thick as his  thumb. A sudden flurry of hail hammered painfully at his back and neck,  he straightened hurriedly.    As quickly as it started the storm was over. The sun burned down,  melting the hailstones and sending curls of steam up from the wet  street. Jason sweated inside his armored clothing. Yet before they had  gone a block it was raining again and he shook with chill.    Grif trudged steadily along, indifferent to the weather or the volcanoes  that rumbled on the horizon and shook the ground beneath their feet.  Jason tried to ignore his discomfort and match the boy's pace.    The walk was a depressing one. The heavy, squat buildings loomed grayly  through the rain, more than half of them in ruins. They walked on a  pedestrian way in the middle of the street. The occasional armored  trucks went by on both sides of them. The midstreet sidewalk puzzled  Jason until Grif blasted something that hurtled out of a ruined building  towards them. The central location gave them some chance to see what was  coming. Suddenly Jason was very tired.    \"Grif, this city of yours is sure down at the heels. I hope the other  ones are in better shape.\"    \"I don't know what you mean talking about heels. But there are no other  cities. Some mining camps that can't be located inside the perimeter.  But no other cities.\"    This surprised Jason. He had always visualized the planet with more than  one city. There were a _lot_ of things he didn't know about Pyrrus, he  realized suddenly. All of his efforts since landing had been taken up  with the survival studies. There were a number of questions he wanted to  ask. But ask them of somebody other than his grouchy eight-year-old  bodyguard. There was one person who would be best equipped to tell him  what he wanted to know.    \"Do you know Kerk?\" he asked the boy. \"Apparently he's your ambassador  to a lot of places, but his last name--\"    \"Sure, everybody knows Kerk. But he's busy, you shouldn't see him.\"    Jason shook a finger at him. \"Minder of my body you may be. But minder  of my soul you are not. What do you say I call the shots and you go  along to shoot the monsters? O.K.?\"           *       *       *       *       *    They took shelter from a sudden storm of fist-sized hailstones. Then,  with ill grace, Grif led the way to one of the larger, central  buildings. There were more people here and some of them even glanced at  Jason for a minute, before turning back to their business. Jason dragged  himself up two flights of stairs before they reached a door marked  CO-ORDINATION AND SUPPLY.    \"Kerk in here?\" Jason asked.    \"Sure,\" the boy told him. \"He's in charge.\"    \"Fine. Now you get a nice cold drink, or your lunch, or something, and  meet me back here in a couple of hours. I imagine Kerk can do as good a  job of looking after me as you can.\"    The boy stood doubtfully for a few seconds, then turned away. Jason  wiped off some more sweat and pushed through the door.    There were a handful of people in the office beyond. None of them looked  up at Jason or asked his business. Everything has a purpose on Pyrrus.  If he came there--he must have had a good reason. No one would ever  think to ask him what he wanted. Jason, used to the petty officialdom of  a thousand worlds, waited for a few moments before he understood. There  was only one other door. He shuffled over and opened it.    Kerk looked up from a desk strewed about with papers and ledgers. \"I was  wondering when you would show up,\" he said.    \"A lot sooner if you hadn't prevented it,\" Jason told him as he dropped  wearily into a chair. \"It finally dawned on me that I could spend the  rest of my life in your blood-thirsty nursery school if I didn't do  something about it. So here I am.\"    \"Ready to return to the 'civilized' worlds, now that you've seen enough  of Pyrrus?\"    \"I am not,\" Jason said. \"And I'm getting very tired of everyone telling  me to leave. I'm beginning to think that you and the rest of the Pyrrans  are trying to hide something.\"    Kerk smiled at the thought. \"What could we have to hide? I doubt if any  planet has as simple and one-directional an existence as ours.\"    \"If that's true, then you certainly wouldn't mind answering a few direct  questions about Pyrrus?\"    Kerk started to protest, then laughed. \"Well done. I should know better  by now than to argue with you. What do you want to know?\"    Jason tried to find a comfortable position on the hard chair, then gave  up. \"What's the population of your planet?\" he asked.    For a second Kerk hesitated, then said, \"Roughly thirty thousand. That  is not very much for a planet that has been settled this long, but the  reason for that is obvious.\"    \"All right, population thirty thousand,\" Jason said. \"Now how about  surface control of your planet. I was surprised to find out that this  city within its protective wall--the perimeter--is the only one on the  planet. Let's not consider the mining camps, since they are obviously  just extensions of the city. Would you say then, that you people control  more or less of the planet's surface than you did in the past?\"           *       *       *       *       *    Kerk picked up a length of steel pipe from the desk, that he used as a  paperweight, and toyed with it as he thought. The thick steel bent like  rubber at his touch, as he concentrated on his answer.    \"That's hard to say offhand. There must be records of that sort of  thing, though I wouldn't know where to find them. It depends on so many  factors--\"    \"Let's forget that for now then,\" Jason said. \"I have another question  that's really more relevant. Wouldn't you say that the population of  Pyrrus is declining steadily, year after year?\"    There was a sharp _twang_ as the steel snapped in Kerk's fingers, the  pieces dropping to the floor. He stood, over Jason, his hands extended  towards the smaller man, his face flushed and angry.    \"Don't ever say that,\" he roared. \"Don't let me ever hear you say that  again!\"    Jason sat as quietly as he could, talking slowly and picking out each  word with care. His life hung in the balance.    \"Don't get angry, Kerk. I meant no harm. I'm on your side, remember? I  can talk to you because you've seen much more of the universe than the  Pyrrans who have never left the planet. You are used to discussing  things. You know that words are just symbols. We can talk and know you  don't have to lose your temper over mere words--\"    Kerk slowly lowered his arms and stepped away. Then he turned and poured  himself a glass of water from a"]]]
