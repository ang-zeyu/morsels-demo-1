In the three instances in which hatching was closely observed in _T.  ornata_, the caruncle made the initial opening in the shell; claws of  the forefeet may have torn shells in other hatchings that were not so  closely observed. In all observed instances, the shell was first  opened at a point opposite the anterior end of the embryo. The initial  opening had the appearance of a three-cornered tear. A quantity of  albuminous fluid oozed from eggs as soon as the shells were punctured.    The initial tear is enlarged by lateral movements of the front feet,  and later the hind feet reach forward and lengthen the tear farther  posteriorly. In many instances a tear develops on each side and the  egg has the appearance of being cleft longitudinally. The young turtle  emerges from the anterior end of the shell or backs out of the shell  through a lateral tear.    The process of hatching, from rupture of shell to completion of  emergence, extended over three to four days in the laboratory. Many  hatchlings from time to time crawled back into the shell over a period  of several days after hatching was completed. In a clutch of eggs kept  in a pail of earth, by William R. Brecheisen, eight days elapsed  between onset of hatching and appearance of the first hatchling at the  surface.    A nest in an outdoor pen at the Reservation was discovered in early  October. The cap had been recently perforated and the hatchlings had  escaped. One of them, judged to be approximately two weeks old, was  found in a burrow nearby. The cavity of the nest appeared to have been  enlarged by the young. The eggs were probably laid in early July.  Emergence of young from the nest had been delayed for a time after  hatching, until rain softened the ground in late September and early  October.      Fertility and Prenatal Mortality    Eggs were incubated in the laboratory at more nearly optimum  temperature and humidity than were eggs in natural nests. Percentage  of prenatal mortality probably was lower in laboratory-incubated eggs  than in those under natural conditions.    Of sixty eggs studied in the laboratory, 45 (75 per cent) were  fertile; 36 (80 per cent) of the fertile eggs (those in which the  blastodisc was at some time discernible by transmitted light) hatched  successfully. In six clutches all the eggs were fertile and five of  these clutches hatched with 100 per cent success. One clutch contained  eggs that were all infertile and another clutch had four infertile  eggs and two fertile eggs that failed to hatch. Among nine fertile  eggs that failed to survive, four casualties occurred in the late  stages of incubation or after hatching had begun, indicating that  these are probably critical periods.    Fertility of eggs was not correlated with size or age of female, with  size of clutch, or with size of egg. Eggs laid in the laboratory had  higher rates of infertility and prenatal mortality than did eggs  dissected from oviducts. Handling of eggs in removing them from nests  to incubation dishes, after embryonic development had begun, might  have been responsible for reduced viability (Table 2).       TABLE 2.--Comparative Rates of Fertility and Prenatal Mortality for       Eggs Dissected from Oviducts and for Eggs That Were Laid in the       Laboratory and Subsequently Removed to Incubation Dishes.   ===========================+==============+===============                              | Eggs removed | Eggs dissected      NUMBER OR PERCENTAGE    |  from nests  | from oviducts   ---------------------------+--------------+---------------   Number of eggs examined    |      22      |      38   ---------------------------+--------------+---------------   Percentage of fertile eggs |      64      |      82   ---------------------------+--------------+---------------   Percentage of fertile      |              |     eggs hatched             |      50      |      94   ---------------------------+--------------+---------------   Percentage of eggs hatched |      32      |      76   ---------------------------+--------------+---------------      Reproductive Potential    Assuming that 4.7 eggs are laid per season, that all eggs are fertile  and all hatch, that all young survive to maturity, that half the  hatchlings are females, and that females first lay eggs in the  eleventh year, the progeny of a single mature female would number 699  after twenty years. Considering that infertility and prenatal  mortality eliminate approximately 40 per cent of eggs laid (according  to laboratory findings) the average number of surviving young per  clutch would be 2.8 and the total progeny, after 20 years, would be  270, provided that only one clutch of eggs was laid per year. But it  is thought that, on the average, one third of the female population  produces two clutches of eggs in a single season. If the second clutch  contains 3.5 eggs (resulting in 2.1 surviving young when factors of  infertility and prenatal mortality are considered), the progeny of a  single female, after 20 years, would number approximately 380.  Postnatal mortality reduces the progeny to a still smaller number.    The small number of eggs laid each year and the long period required  to reach sexual maturity make the reproductive potential of _T.  ornata_ smaller than that of the other turtles of the Great Plains,  and much smaller than nearly any of the non-chelonian reptiles of the  same region.      Number of Reproductive Years    The total span of reproductive years is difficult to determine; I am  unable to ascertain the age of a turtle that has stopped growing. No  clearly defined external characteristics of senility were discovered  in the populations studied. A male that I examined had one atrophied  testis. In another male both testes were shrunken and discolored and  appeared to be encased by fibrous tissue. Both males were large, well  past the age of regular growth, and had smoothly worn shells. Several  old females had seemingly inactive ovaries. Reproductive processes  probably continue throughout life in most members of the population,  although possibly at a somewhat reduced rate in later life.          GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT      Initiation of Growth    Young box turtles became active and alert as soon as they hatched, and  remained so until low temperatures induced quiescence. If sand or soil  was available, hatchlings soon burrowed into it and became inactive.  Covering containers with damp cotton also induced inactivity; the  hatchlings usually made no attempt to burrow through the confining  layer. Desire to feed varied in hatchlings of the same brood and  seemed not to be correlated with retraction of the yolk sac or  retention of the caruncle. Some hatchlings actively pursued mealworms;  on subsequent feedings they learned to associate my presence with food  and eagerly took mealworms from forceps or from my hand. Meat,  vegetables, and most other motionless but edible objects were ignored  by hatchlings but some individuals learned to eat meat after several  forced feedings. Hatchlings that regularly took food in the first  month of life ordinarily grew faster than hatchlings that did not eat.  Many of the hatchlings in the laboratory showed no areas of new  epidermal growth on the shell in the time between hatching and first  (induced) hibernation.      Size and Appearance at Hatching    The proportions of the shell change somewhat in the first few weeks of  life. At hatching the shell may be misshapen as a result of  confinement in the egg. Early changes in proportions of the shell  result from expansion--widening and, to a lesser degree, lengthening  of the carapace--immediately after hatching. Subsequent retraction or  rupture of the yolk sac and closure of the navel are accompanied by a  decrease in height of shell and slight, further widening of the  carapace.    The yolk sac retracts mainly between the time when the egg shell is  first punctured and the time when the turtle actually emerges from the  shell. When hatching is completed, the yolk sac usually protrudes no  more than two millimeters, but in some individuals it is large and  retracts slowly over a period of several days.    One individual began hatching on November 11 and was completely out of  the egg shell next day; the yolk sac was 15 millimeters in diameter,  protruded six millimeters from the umbilical opening, and hindered  the hatchling's movements. The sac broke two days later, smearing the  bottom of the turtle's dish with semifluid yolk. The hatchling then  became more active. Twenty-six days later the turtle was still in good  condition and its navel was nearly closed. A turtle that hatched with  a large yolk sac in a natural nest possibly would benefit, through  increased ease of mobility, if the yolk sac ruptured.    A recently hatched turtle was found at the Reservation in October,  1954, and was kept in a moist terrarium in the laboratory where it  died the following May. The turtle was sluggish and ate only five or  six mealworms while in captivity; no growth was detectable on the  laminae of the shell. Autopsy revealed a vestige of the retracted yolk  sac, approximately one millimeter in diameter, on the small intestine.    The navel (\"umbilical scar\") of captive hatchlings ordinarily closed  by the end of the second month but in three instances remained open  more than 99 days. The position of the navel is marked by a  crescent-shaped crease, on the abdominal lamina, that persists until  the plastron is worn down in later years (Pl. 24, Fig. 1).       [Illustration: FIG. 7.

This apparent change  may be attributable to a reduction in snaring, trapping, and aerial  hunting that took place between the two periods as a result of changes  in State game regulations.    A similar comparison between our observations from 1967 and those from  1968-69 (table 1) shows no significant difference between these years,  so it appears that the density of wolves in our area has remained about  the same over the period of three winters. This agrees with the results  of several other studies summarized by Mech (1970) in which wolf  populations unaffected by man have been found to remain relatively  stable from year to year.      DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS    The movements, behavior, and ecology of the wolves in our study area  during winter are variable, and are influenced considerably by snow  conditions. This may explain the fact that in late February 1969 wolves  1051, 1053, and 1055 suddenly extended their travels and range (fig.  F-34 and table 4).    However, increased travel may have resulted from other factors. For one  thing, the wolves apparently did not need to spend so much time hunting  as before. Because of the deep snow, the ability of wolves to capture  deer increased, and the animals had a surplus of food. Perhaps under  such conditions wolves may use more of their energy for traveling than  for hunting.    [Illustration: _Figure 34.--Net weekly (straight-line) distances  traveled by three radiotagged wolves._]    In this respect it is interesting that 1051 moved right out of his area  and traveled into country that presumably was unknown to him. Wolves  1053 and 1055 each ventured into an area that was almost devoid of deer  and that even had few moose in it. Without sufficient fat reserves in  all these animals, it would seem disadvantageous for them to have made  these travels.    Evidently wolves can obtain enough food in much smaller areas than  these three animals used after February. Both 1059's pack of five and  1057 lived in relatively small areas throughout the winter and seemed  to survive well. Before late February, 1051, 1053, and 1055 did also.  Thus some factor other than food must have influenced the movements of  these three animals from late February through April.    The fact that the increased movement began during the breeding season  makes one suspect a relationship between the two. One possibility is  that the factors increasing the hormonal flow associated with breeding  in adults stimulate a hormone output in immature or subordinate  individuals that causes an increase in their movements. An alternative  is that the breeding behavior of resident packs involves the beginning  of, or an increase in, aggression toward neighboring nonmembers. This  might force the lone animals to shift about over large areas in  avoidance of such aggression.    Whatever the cause of the changes in movements of these animals, the  fact that the pack used a much smaller area than any of the lone wolves  may be of central importance in trying to understand the organization  of the wolf population. The following pieces of information are also  pertinent to such an understanding: (1) the pack, which can be presumed  to include a breeding pair (Mech 1970), chased other wolves in its  area; (2) the lone wolves, which apparently did not breed, were  tolerant of, or indifferent to, other lone wolves in their areas; (3)  the ranges of the lone wolves overlapped considerably (fig. 35); (4)  the lone wolves seemed to avoid certain large areas that one might  logically think would have been visited by them (fig. 35); and (5)  packs of wolves were sometimes observed in these large areas (fig. 35).    [Illustration: _Figure 35.--Locations of all radiotagged wolves and  unmarked packs observed during winter 1968-69, except dispersal of 1051  out of the study area. Only selected lakes shown._]    From the above information it can be hypothesized that the wolf  population consists basically of groups of breeding packs defending  territories of limited size, with lone wolves and other nonbreeding  population units that are tolerant of each other shifting about in much  larger nonexclusive areas among these territories. The information from  Isle Royale (Mech 1966a, Jordan _et al._ 1967) is consistent with  this idea, but the area of that island (210 square miles) is too small  to allow untested extrapolations to be made about spacing in much  larger wolf populations. Data from Algonquin Park, Ontario (Pimlott _et  al._ 1969) also strongly suggest this hypothesis. However, the packs  studied there could not be identified with certainty, and little  information was obtained about nonbreeding population units.    To test the proposed hypothesis with certainty, a larger number of  identifiable breeding and nonbreeding population units from the same  general area must be followed during at least one winter. This will be  the main objective of our next study.      SUMMARY    During the winters of 1966-67, 1967-68, and 1968-69, aerial  observations of timber wolves (_Canis lupus_) were made in the Superior  National Forest in northeastern Minnesota, where the primary prey is  white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_). In 480 hours of flying  during the study, 77 sightings involving 323 wolves were made. In  addition, during 1968-69, five radiotagged wolves and their associates  were tracked via receivers in aircraft for a total of 570 \"wolf-days.\"  Visual observations were made during 65 percent of the times the wolves  were located from December through April.    The average size of each population unit (including single wolves,  pairs, and packs) observed was 4.2, although packs of as many as 13  wolves were sighted. Radiotagged wolves spent most of their daylight  hours resting during winter, and when traveling, hunting or feeding  during the day, tended to do so before 11:00 a.m. and after 3:00 p.m.    Considerable variation was discovered in the movement patterns of  individual wolves, with straight line distances between consecutive  daily locations ranging from 0.0 to 12.8 miles, and between weekly  locations, 0.0 to 49.0 miles. A pack of five wolves used a range about  43 square miles in extent, whereas lone wolves covered areas many times  this size. One animal in an apparent dispersal was tracked a straight  line distance of 129 miles between extreme points.    A reddish male wolf was the leader of the pack of five and led two  observed chases after alien wolves in the pack's territory. This  animal was also most active during scent marking by the pack. Lone  wolves were apparently indifferent to other wolves, and thus exclusive  areas, or territories, were not observed among lone wolves.    Hunts involving a total of seven deer were observed and described, and  two successful attacks on deer were interpreted from tracks in the  snow. Wolves generally consumed all the flesh and much of the hair and  bones from kills, except during February and March 1969 when extreme  snow conditions increased the vulnerability of deer to an unusual  degree. At that time kills were found that were partly or totally  uneaten. The kill rate by radiotagged wolves and associates during the  winter of 1968-69, based on 468 wolf-days of data, varied from one deer  per 6.3 days to one per 37.5 days per wolf, with the average being one  deer per 10 to 13 days. The rate was much lower per wolf for members of  the pack of five than for lone wolves, and much lower before February  1, 1969, than after. The average rate of kill during more usual winters  was estimated to be about one deer per 18 days. This is a consumption  rate of about 5.6 pounds of deer per wolf per day.    Indirect evidence based on comparisons of pack-size distributions for  different periods indicates that the wolf density in the study area may  have increased since 1953, but that it has remained the same from 1967  to 1969.    On the basis of data presented in this paper, the following hypothesis  about the organization of the wolf population studied is proposed: The  wolf population consists basically of groups of breeding packs  defending territories of limited size, with lone wolves and other  nonbreeding population units, tolerant of each other, shifting about in  much larger nonexclusive areas among these territories.
