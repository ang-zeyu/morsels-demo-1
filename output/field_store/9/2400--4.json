It  makes a lot of pleasant work,\" said he, smiling, \"for however much care  you take of such goods, break they will, one day or another, so there is  always plenty to do.\"    I held my tongue and pondered.    We came just here on a gang of men road-mending which delayed us a  little; but I was not sorry for it; for all I had seen hitherto seemed a  mere part of a summer holiday; and I wanted to see how this folk would  set to on a piece of real necessary work.  They had been resting, and had  only just begun work again as we came up; so that the rattle of the picks  was what woke me from my musing.  There were about a dozen of them,  strong young men, looking much like a boating party at Oxford would have  looked in the days I remembered, and not more troubled with their work:  their outer raiment lay on the road-side in an orderly pile under the  guardianship of a six-year-old boy, who had his arm thrown over the neck  of a big mastiff, who was as happily lazy as if the summer-day had been  made for him alone.  As I eyed the pile of clothes, I could see the gleam  of gold and silk embroidery on it, and judged that some of these workmen  had tastes akin to those of the Golden Dustman of Hammersmith.  Beside  them lay a good big basket that had hints about it of cold pie and wine:  a half dozen of young women stood by watching the work or the workers,  both of which were worth watching, for the latter smote great strokes and  were very deft in their labour, and as handsome clean-built fellows as  you might find a dozen of in a summer day.  They were laughing and  talking merrily with each other and the women, but presently their  foreman looked up and saw our way stopped.  So he stayed his pick and  sang out, \"Spell ho, mates! here are neighbours want to get past.\"  Whereon the others stopped also, and, drawing around us, helped the old  horse by easing our wheels over the half undone road, and then, like men  with a pleasant task on hand, hurried back to their work, only stopping  to give us a smiling good-day; so that the sound of the picks broke out  again before Greylocks had taken to his jog-trot.  Dick looked back over  his shoulder at them and said:    \"They are in luck to-day: it's right down good sport trying how much pick-  work one can get into an hour; and I can see those neighbours know their  business well.  It is not a mere matter of strength getting on quickly  with such work; is it, guest?\"    \"I should think not,\" said I, \"but to tell you the truth, I have never  tried my hand at it.\"    \"Really?\" said he gravely, \"that seems a pity; it is good work for  hardening the muscles, and I like it; though I admit it is pleasanter the  second week than the first.  Not that I am a good hand at it: the fellows  used to chaff me at one job where I was working, I remember, and sing out  to me, 'Well rowed, stroke!'  'Put your back into it, bow!'\"    \"Not much of a joke,\" quoth I.    \"Well,\" said Dick, \"everything seems like a joke when we have a pleasant  spell of work on, and good fellows merry about us; we feels so happy, you  know.\"  Again I pondered silently.          CHAPTER VIII: AN OLD FRIEND      We now turned into a pleasant lane where the branches of great  plane-trees nearly met overhead, but behind them lay low houses standing  rather close together.    \"This is Long Acre,\" quoth Dick; \"so there must once have been a  cornfield here.  How curious it is that places change so, and yet keep  their old names!  Just look how thick the houses stand! and they are  still going on building, look you!\"    \"Yes,\" said the old man, \"but I think the cornfields must have been built  over before the middle of the nineteenth century.  I have heard that  about here was one of the thickest parts of the town.  But I must get  down here, neighbours; I have got to call on a friend who lives in the  gardens behind this Long Acre.  Good-bye and good luck, Guest!\"    And he jumped down and strode away vigorously, like a young man.    \"How old should you say that neighbour will be?\" said I to Dick as we  lost sight of him; for I saw that he was old, and yet he looked dry and  sturdy like a piece of old oak; a type of old man I was not used to  seeing.    \"O, about ninety, I should say,\" said Dick.    \"How long-lived your people must be!\" said I.    \"Yes,\" said Dick, \"certainly we have beaten the threescore-and-ten of the  old Jewish proverb-book.  But then you see that was written of Syria, a  hot dry country, where people live faster than in our temperate climate.  However, I don't think it matters much, so long as a man is healthy and  happy while he _is_ alive.  But now, Guest, we are so near to my old  kinsman's dwelling-place that I think you had better keep all future  questions for him.\"    I nodded a yes; and therewith we turned to the left, and went down a  gentle slope through some beautiful rose-gardens, laid out on what I took  to be the site of Endell Street.  We passed on, and Dick drew rein an  instant as we came across a long straightish road with houses scantily  scattered up and down it.  He waved his hand right and left, and said,  \"Holborn that side, Oxford Road that.  This was once a very important  part of the crowded city outside the ancient walls of the Roman and  Mediaeval burg: many of the feudal nobles of the Middle Ages, we are  told, had big houses on either side of Holborn.  I daresay you remember  that the Bishop of Ely's house is mentioned in Shakespeare's play of King  Richard III.; and there are some remains of that still left.  However,  this road is not of the same importance, now that the ancient city is  gone, walls and all.\"    He drove on again, while I smiled faintly to think how the nineteenth  century, of which such big words have been said, counted for nothing in  the memory of this man, who read Shakespeare and had not forgotten the  Middle Ages.    We crossed the road into a short narrow lane between the gardens, and  came out again into a wide road, on one side of which was a great and  long building, turning its gables away from the highway, which I saw at  once was another public group.  Opposite to it was a wide space of  greenery, without any wall or fence of any kind.  I looked through the  trees and saw beyond them a pillared portico quite familiar to me--no  less old a friend, in fact, than the British Museum.  It rather took my  breath away, amidst all the strange things I had seen; but I held my  tongue and let Dick speak.  Said he:    \"Yonder is the British Museum, where my great-grandfather mostly lives;  so I won't say much about it.  The building on the left is the Museum  Market, and I think we had better turn in there for a minute or two; for  Greylocks will be wanting his rest and his oats; and I suppose you will  stay with my kinsman the greater part of the day; and to say the truth,  there may be some one there whom I particularly want to see, and perhaps  have a long talk with.\"    He blushed and sighed, not altogether with pleasure, I thought; so of  course I said nothing, and he turned the horse under an archway which  brought us into a very large paved quadrangle, with a big sycamore tree  in each corner and a plashing fountain in the midst.  Near the fountain  were a few market stalls, with awnings over them of gay striped linen  cloth, about which some people, mostly women and children, were moving  quietly, looking at the goods exposed there.  The ground floor of the  building round the quadrangle was occupied by a wide arcade or cloister,  whose fanciful but strong architecture I could not enough admire.  Here  also a few people were sauntering or sitting reading on the benches.    Dick said to me apologetically: \"Here as elsewhere there is little doing  to-day; on a Friday you would see it thronged, and gay with people, and  in the afternoon there is generally music about the fountain.  However, I  daresay we shall have a pretty good gathering at our mid-day meal.\"    We drove through the quadrangle and by an archway, into a large handsome  stable on the other side, where we speedily stalled the old nag and made  him happy with horse-meat, and then turned and walked back again through  the market, Dick looking rather thoughtful, as it seemed to me.    I noticed that people couldn't help looking at me rather hard, and  considering my clothes and theirs, I didn't wonder; but whenever they  caught my eye they made me a very friendly sign of greeting.    We walked straight into the forecourt of the Museum, where, except that  the railings were gone, and the whispering boughs of the trees were all  about, nothing seemed changed; the very pigeons were wheeling about the  building and clinging to the ornaments of the pediment as I had seen them  of old.    Dick seemed grown a little absent, but he could not forbear giving me an  architectural note, and said:    \"It is rather an ugly old building, isn't it?  Many people have wanted to  pull it down and rebuild it: and perhaps if work does really get scarce  we may yet do so.  But, as my great grandfather will tell you, it would  not be quite a straightforward job; for there are wonderful collections  in there of all kinds of antiquities, besides an enormous library with  many exceedingly beautiful books in it, and many most useful ones as  genuine records, texts of ancient works and the like; and the worry and  anxiety, and even risk, there would be in moving all this has saved the  buildings themselves.  Besides, as we said before, it is not a bad thing  to have some record of what our forefathers thought a handsome building.  For there is plenty of labour and material in it.\"    \"I see there is,\" said I, \"and I quite agree with you.  But now hadn't we  better make haste to see your "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32664"],[0,"Black Amazon of Mars (#10)"],[1,"suddenly he felt a hard shock, and a flashing sensation of warmth  that was somehow inside his own flesh, and not in any tempering of the  frozen air. He gave a startled leap forward, and whirled, looking up  into the face of the mailed figure with the confused idea that it had  reached down and struck him.    It had not moved, of course. And Stark knew, with no need of anyone to  tell him, that he looked into the face of Ban Cruach.           *       *       *       *       *    It was a face made for battles and for ruling, the bony ridges harsh and  strong, the hollows under them worn deep with years. Those eyes, dark  shadows under the rusty helm, had dreamed high dreams, and neither age  nor death had conquered them.    And even in death, Ban Cruach was not unarmed.    Clad as for battle in his ancient mail, he held upright between his  hands a mighty sword. The pommel was a ball of crystal large as a man's  fist, that held within it a spark of intense brilliance. The little,  blinding flame throbbed with its own force, and the sword-blade blazed  with a white, cruel radiance.    Ban Cruach, dead but frozen to eternal changelessness by the bitter  cold, sitting here upon his cairn for a million years and warding  forever the inner end of the Gates of Death, as his ancient city of  Kushat warded the outer.    Stark took two cautious steps closer to Ban Cruach, and felt again the  shock and the flaring heat in his blood. He recoiled, satisfied.    The strange force in the blazing sword made an invisible barrier across  the mouth of the pass, protected Ban Cruach himself. A barrier of short  waves, he thought, of the type used in deep therapy, having no heat in  themselves but increasing the heat in body cells by increasing their  vibration. But these waves were stronger than any he had known before.    A barrier, a wall of force, closing the inner end of the Gates of Death.  A barrier that was not designed against man.    Stark shivered. He turned from the sombre, brooding form of Ban Cruach  and his eyes followed the gaze of the dead king, out beyond the cairn.    He looked across this forbidden land within the Gates of Death.    At his back was the mountain barrier. Before him, a handful of miles to  the north, the terminus of the polar cap rose like a cliff of bluish  crystal soaring up to touch the early stars. Locked in between those two  titanic walls was a great valley of ice.    White and glimmering that valley was, and very still, and very  beautiful, the ice shaped gracefully into curving domes and hollows.  And in the center of it stood a dark tower of stone, a cyclopean bulk  that Stark knew must go down an unguessable distance to its base on the  bedrock. It was like the tower in which Camar had died. But this one was  not a broken ruin. It loomed with alien arrogance, and within its bulk  pallid lights flickered eerily, and it was crowned by a cloud of  shimmering darkness.    _It was like the tower of his dread vision, the tower that he had seen,  not as Eric John Stark, but as Ban Cruach!_    Stark's gaze dropped slowly from the evil tower to the curving ice of  the valley. And the fear within him grew beyond all bounds.    He had seen that, too, in his vision. The glimmering ice, the domes and  hollows of it. He had looked down through it at the city that lay  beneath, and he had seen those who came and went in the buried streets.    Stark hunkered down. For a long while he did not stir.    He did not want to go out there. He did not want to go out from the  grim, warning figure of Ban Cruach with his blazing sword, into that  silent valley. He was afraid, afraid of what he might see if he went  there and looked down through the ice, afraid of the final dread  fulfillment of his vision.    But he had come after Balin, and Balin must be out there somewhere. He  did not want to go, but he was himself, and he must.           *       *       *       *       *    He went, going very softly, out toward the tower of stone. And there was  no sound in all that land.    The last of the twilight had faded. The ice gleamed, faintly luminous  under the stars, and there was light beneath it, a soft radiance that  filled all the valley with the glow of a buried moon.    Stark tried to keep his eyes upon the tower. He did not wish to look  down at what lay under his stealthy feet.    Inevitably, he looked.    _The temples and the palaces glittering in the ice...._    Level upon level, going down. Wells of soft light spanned with soaring  bridges, slender spires rising, an endless variation of streets and  crystal walls exquisitely patterned, above and below and overlapping, so  that it was like looking down through a thousand giant snowflakes. A  metropolis of gossamer and frost, fragile and lovely as a dream, locked  in the clear, pure vault of the ice.    Stark saw the people of the city passing along the bright streets, their  outlines blurred by the icy vault as things are half obscured by water.  The creatures of vision, vaguely shining, infinitely evil.    He shut his eyes and waited until the shock and the dizziness left him.  Then he set his gaze resolutely on the tower, and crept on, over the  glassy sky that covered those buried streets.    Silence. Even the wind was hushed.    He had gone perhaps half the distance when the cry rang out.    It burst upon the valley with a shocking violence. \"_Stark! Stark!_\" The  ice rang with it, curving ridges picked up his name and flung it back  and forth with eerie crystal voices, and the echoes fled out whispering  _Stark! Stark!_ until it seemed that the very mountains spoke.    Stark whirled about. In the pallid gloom between the ice and the stars  there was light enough to see the cairn behind him, and the dim figure  atop it with the shining sword.    Light enough to see Ciara, and the dark knot of riders who had followed  her through the Gates of Death.    She cried his name again. \"Come back! Come back!\"    The ice of the valley answered mockingly, \"_Come back! Come back!_\" and  Stark was gripped with a terror that held him motionless.    She should not have called him. She should not have made a sound in that  deathly place.    A man's hoarse scream rose above the flying echoes. The riders turned  and fled suddenly, the squealing, hissing beasts crowding each other,  floundering wildly on the rocks of the cairn, stampeding back into the  pass.    Ciara was left alone. Stark saw her fight the rearing beast she rode  and then flung herself out of the saddle and let it go. She came toward  him, running, clad all in her black armor, the great axe swinging high.    \"Behind you, Stark! Oh, gods of Mars!\"    He turned then and saw them, coming out from the tower of stone, the  pale, shining creatures that move so swiftly across the ice, so fleet  and swift that no man living could outrun them.           *       *       *       *       *    He shouted to Ciara to turn back. He drew his sword and over his  shoulder he cursed her in a black fury because he could hear her mailed  feet coming on behind him.    _The gliding creatures, sleek and slender, reedlike, bending, delicate  as wraiths, their bodies shaped from northern rainbows of amethyst and  rose--if they should touch Ciara, if their loathsome hands should touch  her...._    Stark let out one raging catlike scream, and rushed them.    The opalescent bodies slipped away beyond his reach. The creatures  watched him.    They had no faces, but they watched. They were eyeless but not blind,  earless, but not without hearing. The inquisitive tendrils that formed  their sensory organs stirred and shifted like the petals of ungodly  flowers, and the color of them was the white frost-fire that dances on  the snow.    \"Go back, Ciara!\"    But she would not go, and he knew that they would not have let her. She  reached him, and they set their backs together. The shining ones ringed  them round, many feet away across the ice, and watched the long sword  and the great hungry axe, and there was something in the lissome swaying  of their bodies that suggested laughter.    \"You fool,\" said Stark. \"You bloody fool.\"    \"And you?\" answered Ciara. \"Oh, yes, I know about Balin. That mad girl,  screaming in the palace--she told me, and you were seen from the wall,  climbing to the Gates of Death. I tried to catch you.\"    \"Why?\"    She did not answer that. \"They won't fight us, Stark. Do you think we  could make it back to the cairn?\"    \"No. But we can try.\"    Guarding each others' backs, they began to walk toward Ban Cruach and  the pass. If they could once reach the barrier, they would be safe.    Stark knew now what Ban Cruach's wall of force was built against. And he  began to guess the riddle of the Gates of Death.    The shining ones glided with them, out of reach. They did not try to bar  the way. They formed a circle around the man and woman, moving with them  and around them at the same time, an endless weaving chain of many  bodies shining with soft jewel tones of color.    They drew closer and closer to the cairn, to the brooding figure of Ban  Cruach and his sword. It crossed Stark's mind that the creatures were  playing with him and Ciara. Yet they had no weapons. Almost, he began to  hope....    From the tower where the shimmering cloud of darkness clung came a black  crescent of force that swept across the ice-field like a sickle and  gathered the two humans in.    Stark felt a shock of numbing cold that turned his nerves to ice. His  sword dropped from his hand, and he heard Ciara's axe go down. His body  was without strength, without feeling, dead.    He fell, and the shining ones glided in toward him.          VIII      Twice before in his life Stark had come near to freezing. It had been  like this, the numbness and the cold. And yet it seemed that the dark  force had struck rather at his nerve centers than at his flesh.    He could not see Ciara, who was behind him, but he heard the metallic"]]]
