Two slim, silent figures, both identical.    They were very near. The David bent down suddenly, dropping its teddy  bear. The bear raced across the ground. Automatically, Hendricks'  fingers tightened around the trigger. The bear was gone, dissolved  into mist. The two Tasso Types moved on, expressionless, walking side  by side, through the gray ash.    When they were almost to him, Hendricks raised the pistol waist high  and fired.    The two Tassos dissolved. But already a new group was starting up the  rise, five or six Tassos, all identical, a line of them coming rapidly  toward him.    And he had given her the ship and the signal code. Because of him she  was on her way to the moon, to the Moon Base. He had made it possible.    He had been right about the bomb, after all. It had been designed with  knowledge of the other types, the David Type and the Wounded Soldier  Type. And the Klaus Type. Not designed by human beings. It had been  designed by one of the underground factories, apart from all human  contact.    The line of Tassos came up to him. Hendricks braced himself, watching  them calmly. The familiar face, the belt, the heavy shirt, the bomb  carefully in place.    The bomb--    As the Tassos reached for him, a last ironic thought drifted through  Hendricks' mind. He felt a little better, thinking about it. The bomb.  Made by the Second Variety to destroy the other varieties. Made for  that end alone.    They were already beginning to design weapons to use against each  other."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3226"],[0,"Records of Journeys to Venice and the Low Countries (#10)"],[1,"of Cologne also gave me a florin, and besides this I  bought two bed-covers for 4 florins less 10 stivers.
