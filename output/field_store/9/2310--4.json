To the under surface of this plate is pivoted a  similarly curved plate, fitted with three tubulures, each of which  carries an objective. By rotating the lower plate each of the objectives  can be brought successively in to the optical axis of the microscope.    [Illustration: FIG. 49.--Eye shade.]    For critical work and particularly for photo-micrography, however, the  interchangeable nosepiece is by no means perfect as it is next to  impossible to secure accurate centreing of each lens in the optical  axis. For special purposes, therefore, it is necessary to employ a  special nosepiece such as that made by Zeiss or Leitz into which each  objective slides on its own carrier and upon which it is accurately  centred.    [Illustration: FIG. 50.--Double nosepiece.]    [Illustration: FIG. 51.--Triple nosepiece.]    _Warm Stage_ (Fig. 52).--This is a flat metal case containing a system  of tubes through the interior of which water of any required temperature  can be circulated. It is made to clamp on to the stage of the  microscope by the screws _A A'_, and is perforated with a large hole  coinciding with the optical axis of the microscope; a short tube B,  projecting from one end of the warm stage permits water of the desired  temperature to be conducted from a reservoir through a length of rubber  tubing to the interior of the stage and a similar tube at the other end  _B'_ of the stage allows exit to the waste water. By raising the  temperature of hanging-drop preparations, etc., placed upon it, above  that of the surrounding atmosphere, the warm stage renders possible  exact observations on spore germination, hanging-drop cultivations, etc.    [Illustration: FIG. 52.--Warm stage.]    A better form is the electrical hot stage designed by Lorrain Smith;[2]  it requires the addition of a lamp resistance and sliding rheostat, also  a delicate ammeter reading to .01 of an ampere. It consists of a wooden  frame supporting a flat glass bulb with a long neck bent upward at an  obtuse angle (Fig. 53). The bulb is filled with liquid paraffin, which  rises in the open neck when expanded by heat. The neck also accommodates  the thermometer. Two coils of manganin wire run in the paraffin at  opposite sides of the bulb (outside the field of vision), coupled to  brass terminals on the wooden frame by platinum wire fused into the  glass. The resistance of the two coils in series is about 10 ohms. A  current of 2-1/2 amperes is needed, and is conducted to the coils in the  stage through the rheostat. With the help of the ammeter any desired  temperature can be obtained and maintained, up to about 200 deg. C. If  immersion oil contact is made between the top lens of the condenser and  the lower surface of the bulb, this stage works very well indeed with  the 1/12-inch oil immersion lens.    [Illustration: FIG. 53.--Lorrain Smith's warm stage.]    _Dark Ground or Paraboloid Condenser._--This is an immersion substage  condenser of high aperture by means of which unstained objects such as  bacteria can be shown as bright white particles upon a dense black  background. The central rays of light are blocked out by means of an  opaque stop while the peripheral rays are reflected from the  paraboloidal sides of the condenser and refracted by the object viewed.  To obtain the best results with this type of condenser a powerful  illuminant--such as a small arc lamp or an incandescent gas lamp--is  needed, together with picked slides of a certain thickness (specified  for the particular make of condenser but generally 1 mm.) and specially  thin cover-glasses (not more than 0.17 mm.) The objective must not have  a higher NA than 1.0, consequently immersion lenses must be fitted with  an internal stop to cut down the aperture.    _Micrometer._--Some form of micrometer for the purpose of measuring  bacteria and other objects is also essential. Details of those in  general use will be found in the following pages.    [Illustration: FIG. 54--Diamond Object marker.]    _Object Marker_ (Fig. 54).--This is an exceedingly useful piece of  apparatus. Made in the form of an objective, the lenses are replaced by  a diamond point, set slightly out of the centre, which can be rotated by  means of a milled plate. Screwed on to the nosepiece in place of the  objective, rotation of the diamond point will rule a small circle on the  object slide to permanently record the position of an interesting  portion of the specimen. The diamond is mounted on a spring which  regulates the pressure, and the size of the circle can be adjusted by  means of a lateral screw.      METHODS OF MICROMETRY.    The unit of length as applied to the measurement of microscopical  objects is the one-thousandth part of a millimetre (0.001 mm.),  denominated a _micron_ (sometimes, and erroneously, referred to as a  micro-millimetre), and indicated in writing by the Greek letter mu. Of  the many methods in use for the measurement of bacteria, three only will  be here described, viz.:    (a) By means of the Camera Lucida.    (b) By means of the ocular or Eyepiece Micrometer.    (c) By means of the Filar Micrometer (Ramsden's micrometer eyepiece).    For each of these methods a ~stage micrometer~ is necessary. This is a 3  by 1 inch glass slip having engraved on it a scale divided to hundredths  of a millimetre (0.01 mm.), every tenth line being made longer than the  intervening ones, to facilitate counting; and from these engraved lines  the measurement in every case is evaluated. A cover-glass is cemented  over the scale to protect it from injury.    [Illustration: FIG. 55.--Camera lucida, Abbe pattern.]    (a) By means of the Camera Lucida.    1. Attach a camera lucida (of the Wollaston, Beale, or Abbe pattern)  (Fig. 55) to the eyepiece of the microscope.    2. Adjust the micrometer on the stage of the microscope and accurately  focus the divisions.    3. Project the scale of the stage micrometer on to a piece of paper and  with pen or pencil sketch in the magnified image, each division of which  corresponds to 10 mu. Mark on the paper the optical combination (ocular  objective and tube length) employed to produce this particular  magnification.    4. Repeat this procedure for each of the possible combinations of  oculars and objectives fitted to the microscope supplied, and carefully  preserve the scales thus obtained.    To measure an object by this method simply project the image on to the  scale corresponding to the particular optical combination in use at the  moment. Read off the number of divisions it occupies and express them as  _micra_.    In place of preserving a scale for each optical combination, the object  to be measured and the micrometer scale may be projected and sketched,  in turn, on the same piece of paper, taking particular care that the  centre of the eyepiece is 25 cm. from the paper on which the divisions  are drawn.    [Illustration: FIG. 56.--Eyepiece micrometer, ordinary.]    [Illustration: FIG. 57.--Eyepiece micrometer, net.]    (b) By means of the Eyepiece Micrometer.    The ~eyepiece micrometer~ is a circular glass disc having engraved on it a  scale divided to tenths of a millimetre (0.1 mm.) (Fig. 56), or the  entire surface ruled in 0.1 mm. squares (the net micrometer) (Fig. 57).  It can be fitted inside the mount of any ocular just above the aperture  of the diaphragm and must be adjusted exactly in the focus of the eye  lens.    Some makers mount the glass disc together with a circular cover-glass in  such a way that when placed in position in any Huyghenian eyepiece of  their own manufacture, the scale is exactly in focus for normal vision.  Special eyepieces are also obtainable having a sledging adjustment to  the eye lens for focussing the micrometer.    The value of one division of the micrometer scale must first be  ascertained for each optical combination by the aid of the stage  micrometer, thus:    1. Insert the eyepiece micrometer inside the ocular and adjust the stage  micrometer on the stage of the microscope.    2. Focus the scale of the stage micrometer accurately; the lines will  appear to be immediately below those of the eyepiece micrometer. Make  the lines on the two micrometers parallel by rotating the ocular.    3. Make two of the lines on the ocular micrometer coincide with those  bounding one division of the stage micrometer; this is effected by  increasing or diminishing the tube length; and note the number of  included divisions.    4. Calculate the value of each division of the eyepiece micrometer in  terms of  mu, by means of the following formula:        x = 10 y.        Where x = the number of included divisions of the                          eyepiece micrometer.              y = the number of included divisions of the                         stage micrometer.    5. Note the optical combination employed in this experiment and record  it with the calculated micrometer value.    Repeat this process for each of the other combinations. Carefully record  the results.    To measure an object by this method read off the number of divisions of  the eyepiece micrometer it occupies and express the result in _micra_ by  a reference to the standard value for the particular optical combination  employed.    Zeiss prepares a compensating eyepiece micrometer for use with his  apochromatic objectives, the divisions of which are so computed that  (with a tube length of 160 mm.) the value of each is equivalent to as  many _micra_ as there are millimetres in the focal length of the  objective employed.    _Wright's Eikonometer_ is really a modification of the eyepiece  micrometer for rapidly measuring microscopical objects by direct  inspection, having previously determined the magnifying power of the  particular optical"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27748"],[0,"Popular Lectures on Zoonomia (#10)"],[1,"latitude, sustaining a degree of cold, which in January became so  severe, that the spirit in the thermometer was 126 degrees below the  freezing point. Professor Pallas in Siberia, and our countrymen at  Hudson's Bay, have experienced a degree of cold almost equal to this.  All these facts tend to prove, that the heat of animals continues  without alteration in very different temperatures. Hence it is  evident that they must be able to produce a greater degree of heat,  when surrounded by a cold medium; and on the contrary, that they must  effect a diminution of the heat, when the surrounding medium is very  hot.    All these circumstances may be accounted for, by the principles we  have laid down; the decomposition of oxygen in the lungs.    There have not been wanting, however, some very eminent  physiologists, who have contended that animal heat is produced  chiefly by the nerves. They have brought forward in proof of this the  well known fact, that when the spinal marrow is injured, the  temperature of the body generally becomes diminished; and that in a  paralytic limb the heat is less than ordinary, though the strength  and velocity of the pulse remain the same. These facts, and others of  a similar nature, have induced them to believe, that the nervous  system is the chief cause and essential organ of heat; and they have  adduced similar arguments, to prove that nutrition is performed by  the nerves, for a limb which is paralytic from an injury of the  nerves, wastes, though the circulation continues. The truth is, that  the nerves exert their influence upon these, and all other functions  of the body, and modify their action. The liver secretes bile, but if  the nerves leading to it be destroyed, the secretion of bile will  cease; but who will say, that the bile is secreted by the nerves? The  nitric acid will dissolve metals, and this solution will go on more  quickly if heat be applied; but surely the nitric acid is the  solvent, the heat being only an aiding cause.    But though the human body has been so wisely constructed, as to bear,  without inconvenience, a considerable variation of temperature; yet  this latitude has its limits, which depend upon the capability of  extricating heat from the atmosphere. There must be a limit below  which the diminution of heat takes place faster than its production.  If this be continued, or increased, the heat of the animal must  diminish, the functions lose their energy, and an insuperable  inclination to sleep is felt, in which if the sufferer indulge, he  will be sure to wake no more.    This is confirmed by what happened to Sir Joseph Banks and his party  on the heights of Terra del Fuego. Dr. Solander, who had more than  once crossed the mountains which divide Sweden from Norway, well knew  that extreme cold produces an irresistible torpor and sleepiness, he  therefore conjured the company to keep always in motion, whatever  exertion it might require, and however great might be their  inclination to rest. Whoever sits down, says he, will sleep; and  whoever sleeps will wake no more. Thus, at once admonished and  alarmed, they set forward; but, while they were still upon the naked  rocks, the cold was so intense, as to produce the effects which had  been so much dreaded. Dr. Solander himself was the first who found  the inclination against which he had warned others, irresistible; and  insisted on being suffered to lie down. Sir Joseph entreated and  remonstrated in vain; he lay down upon the ground, though it was  covered with snow; and it was with great difficulty that his friend  kept him from sleeping. One of his black servants also began to  linger, having suffered from the cold in the same manner as the  Doctor. Partly by persuasion, and partly by force, they were got  forwards; soon however they both declared that they would go no  further. Sir Joseph had recourse again to entreaty and expostulation,  but these produced no effect: when the black was told, that if he did  not go on, he would shortly be frozen to death; he answered, that he  desired nothing so much as to lie down and die. The Doctor did not so  explicitly renounce his life, but said, he would go on, if they would  first allow him to take some sleep, though he had before told them,  that to sleep was to perish. They both in a few minutes fell into a  profound sleep, and after five minutes Sir Joseph Banks happily  succeeded in waking Dr. Solander, who had almost lost the use of his  limbs; the muscles were so shrunk, that his shoes fell from his feet;  but every attempt to recal the unfortunate black to life proved  unsuccessful.    As the circulation of the blood is the means by which the heat  produced is conveyed to all parts of the body; and as it is a  function of the highest importance, I shall, in the next lecture,  proceed to the consideration of it.    LECTURE III.  CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD.    Two kinds of motion may be distinguished in the animal economy; the  one voluntary, or under the command of the will, which takes place at  certain intervals, but may be stopped at pleasure. The other kind of  motion is called involuntary, as not depending on the will, but going  on constantly, without interruption, both when we sleep and when we  wake.    Of the first kind is the motion of the limbs, of which I have already  spoken in general terms; the object of which is, to change the  situation of the animal, and carry it where the will directs.    Among the involuntary motions, the most remarkable is the circulation  of the blood, which I shall proceed to consider in this lecture.    There is one motion, however, which claims a middle place between the  voluntary and involuntary; I mean respiration. This action is so far  under the command of the will, that it may be suspended, increased,  or diminished in strength and frequency: but we can only suspend it  for a very short time; and it goes on regularly during sleep, and in  general, even when we are awake, without the intervention of the  will; its continuation being always necessary, as we have already  seen, to support life.    The motion of the fluids in the living body is regulated by very  different laws, from those which govern the motion of ordinary  fluids, that depend upon their gravity and fluidity: these last have  a general centre of gravitation to which they incessantly tend. Their  motion is from above downwards, when not prevented by any obstacles;  and when they meet with obstruction, they either stop till the  obstacle is removed, or escape where they find the least resistance.  When they have reached the lowest situations, they remain at rest,  unless acted upon by some internal impulse, which again puts them in  motion.    But the motion of the fluids in an animal body, is less uniform,  constant, and regular; it takes place upwards as well as downwards,  and overcomes numerous obstacles; it carries the blood from the  interior parts of the body to the surface, and from the surface back  again to the internal parts; it forces it from the left side of the  body to the right, and with such rapidity that not a particle of the  fluid remains an instant in the same place.    The principal organ concerned in the circulation of the blood, is the  heart; which is a hollow muscle, of a conical figure, with two  cavities, called ventricles; this organ is situated in the thorax or  chest; its apex or point is inclined downwards and to the left side,  where it is received in a cavity of the left lobe of the lungs.    At the basis of the heart on each side are situated two cavities,  called auricles, to receive the blood; and these contracting, force  the blood into the ventricles, which are two cavities in the heart,  separated from each other by a strong muscular partition. The cavity  which is situated on the right side of the heart, is called the right  ventricle, and that on the left the left ventricle. From the right  ventricle of the heart issues a large artery, called the pulmonary  artery, which goes to the lungs, and is there divided and subdivided  into a vast number of branches, the extremities of which are too  small to be visible. These ultimate ramifications unite again into  larger branches; these again into branches still larger, and so  continually, till at last they form four tubes, called the pulmonary  veins, which are inserted into the left auricle of the heart,    From the left ventricle of the heart there issues another large  artery, called the aorta, which, in its passage, sends off branches  to the heart, arms, legs, head, and every other part of the body.  These branches, in the course of their progress, are divided and  subdivided into innumerable minute ramifications, the last of which  are invisible. These small ramifications unite again into branches  continually larger and larger, till they form two great tubes, called  the venae cavae; which large veins are inserted into the right  auricle of the heart; where a vein, termed the coronary vein of the  heart, which returns the blood from the heart itself, also  terminates.    From what has been said, it will be evident, that strictly speaking,  there are only two arteries and seven veins in the body; one  pulmonary artery, which carries the blood from the right ventricle of  the heart to the lungs, and four pulmonary veins, which bring it back  again; then the aorta or large artery, which carries the blood from  the left ventricle of the heart to all parts of the body; the two  venae cavae, and the coronary vein of the heart, which bring it back  again.    At the beginning of both arteries, where they leave the heart, are  placed valves, which allow the blood to flow freely from the heart  into the arteries, but which prevent its return to the heart. There  are likewise valves between the auricles and ventricles, which permit  the blood to flow from the former into the latter, but prevent its  return into the auricles. The veins are"]]]
