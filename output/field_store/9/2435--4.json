One morning the sunshine disclosed that all its  green leaves had changed into leaves made of gold, and the heart of  the Yew tree danced with happiness. But some robbers, as they stole  through the forest, were attracted by the glitter, and stripped off  every golden leaf. Again the tree bemoaned its fate, and next day the  sun shone on leaves of purest crystal. \"How beautiful!\" thought the  tree; \"see how I sparkle!\" But a hailstorm burst from the clouds, and  the sparkling leaves lay shivered on the grass. Once more the good  fairies tried to comfort the unhappy tree. Smooth broad leaves covered  its branches, and the Yew tree flaunted these gay banners in the wind.  But, alas, a flock of goats came by and ate of the fresh young leaves  \"a million and ten.\" \"Give me back again my old dress,\" sobbed the  Yew, \"for I see that it was best.\" And ever since its leaves remain  unchanging, and it wears the sombre dress which covered its boughs in  the days when King William landed from Normandy on our shores, and the  swineherd tended his pigs in the great forests which covered so much  of Merry England.          HOW THE PINE TREE DID SOME GOOD    Samuel W. Duffield      It was a long narrow valley where the Pine Tree stood, and perhaps if  you want to look for it you might find it there today. For pine trees  live a long time, and this one was not very old.    The valley was quite barren. Nothing grew there but a few scrubby  bushes; and, to tell the truth, it was about as desolate a place as  you can well imagine. Far up over it hung the great, snowy caps of the  Rocky Mountains, where the clouds played hide and seek all day, and  chased each other merrily across the snow. There was a little stream,  too, that gathered itself up among the snows and came running down the  side of the mountain; but for all that the valley was very dreary.    Once in a while there went a large grey rabbit, hopping among the  sagebushes; but look as far as you could you would find no more  inhabitants. Poor, solitary little valley, with not even a cottonwood  down by the stream, and hardly enough grass to furnish three oxen with  a meal! Poor, barren little valley lying always for half the day in  the shadow of those tall cliffs--burning under the summer sun, heaped  high with the winter snows--lying there year after year without a  friend! Yes, it had two friends, though they could do it but little  good, for they were two pine trees. The one nearest the mountain,  hanging quite out of reach in a cleft of the rock, was an old, gnarled  tree, which had stood there for a hundred years. The other was  younger, with bright green foliage, summer and winter. It curled up  the ends of its branches, as if it would like to have you understand  that it was a very fine, hardy fellow, even if it wasn't as old as its  father up there in the cleft of the rock.    Now the young Pine Tree grew very lonesome at times, and was glad to  talk with any persons who came along, and they were few, I can tell  you. Occasionally, it would look lovingly up to the father pine, and  wonder if it could make him hear what it said. It would rustle its  branches and shout by the hour, but the father pine heard him only  once, and then the words were so mixed with falling snow that it was  really impossible to say what they meant.    So the Pine Tree was very lonesome and no wonder. \"I wish I knew of  what good I am,\" he said to the grey rabbit one day. \"I wish I  knew,--I wish I knew,\" and he rustled his branches until they all  seemed to say, \"Wish I knew--wish I knew.\"    \"O pshaw!\" said the rabbit, \"I wouldn't concern myself much about  that. Some day you'll find out.\"    \"But do tell me,\" persisted the Pine Tree, \"of what good you think I  am.\"    \"Well,\" answered the rabbit, sitting up on her hind paws and washing  her face with her front ones, in order that company shouldn't see her  unless she looked trim and tidy--\"well,\" said the rabbit, \"I can't  exactly say myself what it is. If you don't help one, you help  another--and that's right enough, isn't it? As for me, I take care of  my family. I hop around among the sagebushes and get their breakfast  and dinner and supper. I have plenty to do, I assure you, and you must  really excuse me now, for I have to be off.\"    \"I wish I was a hare,\" muttered the Pine Tree to himself, \"I think I  could do some good then, for I should have a family to support, but I  know I can't now.\"    Then he called across to the little stream and asked the same question  of him. And the stream rippled along, and danced in the sunshine, and  answered him. \"I go on errands for the big mountain all day. I carried  one of your cones not long ago to a point of land twenty miles off,  and there now is a pine tree that looks just like you. But I must run  along, I am so busy. I can't tell you of what good you are. You must  wait and see.\" And the little stream danced on.    \"I wish I were a stream,\" thought the Pine Tree. \"Anything but being  tied down to this spot for years. That is unfair. The rabbit can run  around, and so can the stream; but I must stand still forever. I wish  I were dead.\"    By and by the summer passed into autumn, and the autumn into winter,  and the snowflakes began to fall.    \"Halloo!\" said the first one, all in a flutter, as she dropped on the  Pine Tree. But he shook her off, and she fell still farther down on  the ground. The Pine Tree was getting very churlish and cross lately.    However, the snow didn't stop for all that and very soon there was a  white robe over all the narrow valley. The Pine Tree had no one to  talk with now. The stream had covered himself in with ice and snow,  and wasn't to be seen.    The hare had to hop around very industriously to get enough for her  children to eat; and the sagebushes were always low-minded fellows and  couldn't begin to keep up a ten-minutes' conversation.    At last there came a solitary figure across the valley, making its way  straight for the Pine Tree. It was a lame mule, which had been left  behind from some wagon-train. He dragged himself slowly on till he  reached the tree. Now the Pine, in shaking off the snow, had shaken  down some cones as well, and they lay on the snow. These the mule  picked up and began to eat.    \"Heigh ho!\" said the tree, \"I never knew those things were fit to eat  before.\"    \"Didn't you?\" replied the mule. \"Why I have lived on these things, as  you call them, ever since I left the wagons. I am going back on the  Oregon Trail, and I sha'n't see you again. Accept my thanks for  breakfast. Good-bye.\"    And he moved off to the other end of the valley and disappeared among  the rocks.    \"Well!\" exclaimed the Pine Tree. \"That's something, at all events.\"  And he shook down a number of cones on the snow. He was really happier  than he had ever been before,--and with good reason, too.    After a while there appeared three people. They were a family of  Indians,--a father, a mother, and a little child. They, too, went  straight to the tree.    \"We'll stay here,\" said the father, looking across at the snow-covered  bed of the stream and up at the Pine Tree. He was very poorly  clothed, this Indian. He and his wife and the child had on dresses of  hare-skins, and they possessed nothing more of any account, except bow  and arrows, and a stick with a net on the end. They had no lodge  poles, and not even a dog. They were very miserable and hungry. The  man threw down his bow and arrows not far from the tree. Then he began  to clear away the snow in a circle and to pull up the sagebushes.  These he and the woman built into a round, low hut, and then they  lighted a fire within it. While it was beginning to burn the man went  to the stream and broke a hole in the ice. Tying a string to his  arrow, he shot a fish which came up to breathe, and, after putting it  on the coals, they all ate it half-raw. They never noticed the Pine  Tree, though he scattered down at least a dozen more cones.    At last night came on, cold and cheerless. The wind blew savagely  through the valleys, and howled at the Pine Tree, for they were old  enemies. Oh, it was a bitter night, but finally the morning broke!  More snow had fallen and heaped up against the hut so that you could  hardly tell that it was there. The stream had frozen tighter than  before and the man could not break a hole in the ice again. The  sagebushes were all hid by the drifts, and the Indians could find none  to burn.    Then they turned to the Pine Tree. How glad he was to help them! They  gathered up the cones and roasted the seeds on the fire. They cut  branches from the tree and burned them, and so kept up the warmth in  their hut.    The Pine Tree began to find himself useful, and he told the hare so  one morning when she came along. But she saw the Indian's hut, and did  not stop to reply. She had put on her winter coat of white, yet the  Indian had seen her in spite of all her care. He followed her over the  snow with his net, and caught her among the drifts. Poor Pine Tree!  She was almost his only friend, and when he saw her eaten and her skin  taken for the child's mantle, he was very sorrowful, you may be sure.  He saw that if the Indians stayed there, he, too, would have to die,  for they would in time burn off all his branches, and use all his  cones; but he was doing good at last, and he was content.    Day after day passed by,--some bleak, some warm,--and the winter moved  slowly along. The Indians only went from their hut to the Pine Tree  now. He gave them fire and food, and the snow was their drink. He was  smaller than before, for many branches were gone, but he was happier  than ever.    One day the sun came out more warmly, and it seemed as if spring was  near. The Indian man broke a hole in the ice, and got more fish. The  Indian woman caught a rabbit.

It is sad that the phrase /divine service/          has come so generally to mean public worship instead of  40:30   daily deeds.                                 Within the veil            The nature of Christianity is peaceful and blessed,          but in order to enter into the kingdom, the anchor of  41:1    hope must be cast beyond the veil of matter into the          Shekinah into which Jesus has passed before us; and  41:3    this advance beyond matter must come          through the joys and triumphs of the right-          eous as well as through their sorrows and afflictions.  41:6    Like our Master, we must depart from material sense          into the spiritual sense of being.                             The thorns and flowers            The God-inspired walk calmly on though it be with  41:9    bleeding footprints, and in the hereafter they will reap          what they now sow. The pampered hypo-          crite may have a flowery pathway here, but  41:12   he cannot forever break the Golden Rule and escape the          penalty due.                               Healing early lost            The proofs of Truth, Life, and Love, which Jesus gave  41:15   by casting out error and healing the sick, completed his          earthly mission; but in the Christian Church          this demonstration of healing was early lost,  41:18   about three centuries after the crucifixion. No ancient          school of philosophy, /materia medica/, or scholastic theol-          ogy ever taught or demonstrated the divine healing of  41:21   absolute Science.                                Immortal achieval            Jesus foresaw the reception Christian Science would have          before it was understood, but this foreknowledge hindered  41:24   him not. He fulfilled his God-mission, and          then sat down at the right hand of the Father.          Persecuted from city to city, his apostles still went about  41:27   doing good deeds, for which they were maligned and          stoned. The truth taught by Jesus, the elders scoffed at.          Why? Because it demanded more than they were willing  41:30   to practise. It was enough for them to believe in a national          Deity; but that belief, from their time to ours, has never          made a disciple who could cast out evils and heal the sick.  42:1    Jesus' life proved, divinely and scientifically, that God          is Love, whereas priest and rabbi affirmed God to be a  42:3    mighty potentate, who loves and hates. The Jewish the-          ology gave no hint of the unchanging love of God.                                A belief in death            The universal belief in death is of no advantage. It  42:6    cannot make Life or Truth apparent. Death          will be found at length to be a mortal dream,          which comes in darkness and disappears with the light.                                 Cruel desertion    42:9    The \"man of sorrows\" was in no peril from salary or          popularity. Though entitled to the homage of the world          and endorsed pre-eminently by the approval  42:12   of God, his brief triumphal entry into Jerusa-          lem was followed by the desertion of all save a few friends,          who sadly followed him to the foot of the cross.                                  Death outdone    42:15   The resurrection of the great demonstrator of God's          power was the proof of his final triumph over body          and matter, and gave full evidence of divine  42:18   Science, - evidence so important to mortals.          The belief that man has existence or mind separate from          God is a dying error. This error Jesus met with divine  42:21   Science and proved its nothingness. Because of the won-          drous glory which God bestowed on His anointed, temp-          tation, sin, sickness, and death had no terror for Jesus.  42:24   Let men think they had killed the body! Afterwards he          would show it to them unchanged. This demonstrates          that in Christian Science the true man is governed by  42:27   God - by good, not evil - and is therefore not a mortal          but an immortal. Jesus had taught his disciples the          Science of this proof. He was here to enable them to  42:30   test his still uncomprehended saying, \"He that believ-          eth on me, the works that I do shall he do also.\" They          must understand more fully his Life-principle by casting  43:1    out error, healing the sick, and raising the dead, even as          they did understand it after his bodily departure.                               Pentecost repeated    43:3    The magnitude of Jesus' work, his material disappear-          ance before their eyes and his reappearance, all enabled          the disciples to understand what Jesus had  43:6    said. Heretofore they had only believed;          now they understood. The advent of this understanding          is what is meant by the descent of the Holy Ghost, - that  43:9    influx of divine Science which so illuminated the Pentecos-          tal Day and is now repeating its ancient history.                               Convincing evidence            Jesus' last proof was the highest, the most convincing,  43:12   the most profitable to his students. The malignity of          brutal persecutors, the treason and suicide of          his betrayer, were overruled by divine Love to  43:15   the glorification of the man and of the true idea of God,          which Jesus' persecutors had mocked and tried to slay.          The final demonstration of the truth which Jesus taught,  43:18   and for which he was crucified, opened a new era for the          world. Those who slew him to stay his influence perpetu-          ated and extended it.                                 Divine victory    43:21   Jesus rose higher in demonstration because of the cup          of bitterness he drank. Human law had condemned          him, but he was demonstrating divine Science.  43:24   Out of reach of the barbarity of his enemies,          he was acting under spiritual law in defiance of mat-          ter and mortality, and that spiritual law sustained him.  43:27   The divine must overcome the human at every point.          The Science Jesus taught and lived must triumph over          all material beliefs about life, substance, and intelli-  43:30   gence, and the multitudinous errors growing from such          beliefs.            Love must triumph over hate. Truth and Life must  44:1    seal the victory over error and death, before the thorns          can be laid aside for a crown, the benediction follow,  44:3    \"Well done, good and faithful servant,\" and the suprem-          acy of Spirit be demonstrated.                                Jesus in the tomb            The lonely precincts of the tomb gave Jesus a refuge  44:6    from his foes, a place in which to solve the great          problem of being. His three days' work in          the sepulchre set the seal of eternity on time.  44:9    He proved Life to be deathless and Love to be the mas-          ter of hate. He met and mastered on the basis of Chris-          tian Science, the power of Mind over matter, all the claims  44:12   of medicine, surgery, and hygiene.            He took no drugs to allay inflammation. He did not          depend upon food or pure air to resuscitate wasted  44:15   energies. He did not require the skill of a surgeon to          heal the torn palms and bind up the wounded side and          lacerated feet, that he might use those hands to remove  44:18   the napkin and winding-sheet, and that he might employ          his feet as before.                              The deific naturalism            Could it be called supernatural for the God of nature  44:21   to sustain Jesus in his proof of man's truly derived power?          It was a method of surgery beyond material          art, but it was not a supernatural act. On  44:24   the contrary, it was a divinely natural act, whereby divinity          brought to humanity the understanding of the Christ-          healing and revealed a method infinitely above that of  44:27   human invention.                               Obstacles overcome            His disciples believed Jesus to be dead while he was          hidden in the sepulchre, whereas he was alive, demon-  44:30   strating within the narrow tomb the power          of Spirit to overrule mortal, material sense.          There were rock-ribbed walls in the way, and a great  45:1    stone must be rolled from the cave's mouth; but Jesus          vanquished every material obstacle, overcame every law  45:3    of matter, and stepped forth from his gloomy resting-place,          crowned with the glory of a sublime success, an everlasting          victory.                             Victory over the grave    45:6    Our Master fully and finally demonstrated divine Sci-          ence in his victory over death and the grave. Jesus'          deed was for the enlightenment of men and  45:9    for the salvation of the whole world from sin,          sickness, and death. Paul writes: \"For if, when we were          enemies, we were reconciled to God by the [seeming] death  45:12   of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved          by his life.\" Three days after his bodily burial he talked          with his disciples. The persecutors had failed to hide im-  45:15   mortal Truth and Love in a sepulchre.                              The stone rolled away            Glory be to God, and peace to the struggling hearts!          Christ hath rolled away the stone from the door of hu-  45:18   man hope and faith, and through the reve-          lation and demonstration of life in God, hath          elevated them to possible at-one-ment with the"]]]
