At present it is only necessary to say how the slaves are obtained.  The expeditions organised for this purpose are simply a perfected  chase, both by the way in which they are conducted, and by the result  to which they are to lead. It is not a question of brutally seizing a  prey to be devoured immediately. The captured animal must be carefully  managed, carried away alive and in such a condition that it has not  yet known a free life, and can accustom itself to new conditions. When  the _Polyergus_ or Amazon ants desire to increase their band of  slaves, one first remarks extreme excitement in the neighbourhood of  the nest. They all come out helter-skelter, but this disorder lasts  only for a short time; they soon form in line, and a regular serried  column is formed, longer or shorter according to the swarm; it has  been found to measure more than five metres long by fifteen  centimetres broad. The Amazons advance, often changing their direction  like a dog who is seeking a scent: this is exactly what they are  doing, they smell the ground with their antennae in order to recognise  traces of the _Formica fusca_. In this march the eminently republican  instinct of the ants comes out. The band has no chief; those who are  at the head go forward smelling the ground; this slackens their pace,  so that they are passed by those in the ranks behind. Little by little  they fall into single file, and this continuing during the whole  course of the march, a particular ant may sometimes be at the head of  the column, sometimes in the middle, sometimes in the rear. At the end  of a longer or shorter period the expedition discovers a scent, which  it follows up to the nest of the _Formica fusca_. The alarm is  immediately given in the threatened ant-hill; the approach is  announced of a band of slavers, and they all rush out, some to face  their terrible adversaries while the others take up the nymphs and  eggs in their mandibles and flee in all directions to save as many as  possible of their offspring. The small ants endeavour with their  burdens to climb to the summits of blades of grass; those who succeed  are in safety with the eggs that they carry, for the Amazons do not  climb. In the meanwhile a fierce battle is going on in the  neighbourhood of the nest between the _Formica fusca_, who have made a  sortie, and the slavers. It is an unequal struggle, because the latter  are armed with formidable jaws, strong and sharp, borne by a large  head with powerful muscles. The defenders of the nest are seized and  placed _hors de combat_. They flee discouraged, and the assailants  force the entry of the dwelling. They then take possession of the  larvae and nymphs and come out again holding them in their mandibles.  The _Polyergus_ thus laden flee as fast as possible, escaping as well  as they can from the bereaved parents, who endeavour to save their  offspring. The band returns to the nest by the same road that it came,  although not the shortest, for these insects seem to lack the sense of  direction and are guided by smell, so that they have to retrace all  the windings of the road. The march is slackened by the weight of the  booty (Fig. 7), and each travels according to his fancy, without  following the regular order of the departure. At last the ants regain  their household. The slaves, warned of the return of the victorious  army, rush out to meet it and relieve the arrivals of their burdens,  some in their zeal even carrying at the same time both the master and  his burden. The nymphs transported into the ant-hill are henceforth  cared for by their fellow-slaves; the _Polyergus_ do not trouble  themselves further.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.]    [Illustration: FIG. 8.]    _Wars of the ants._--As sociable as man, the manners of ants present  more than one resemblance to his. Slave-hunting expeditions are among  these; the wars that these insects undertake also resemble human wars.  The causes of the quarrel are of various nature, most often they  result from the close proximity of two ant swarms. The rival colonies  are always meeting in the same regions and seeking the same material;  their mutual rivalry strains their relations. A moment comes when one  of them is decidedly in the way of the other. At such a period, which  is almost a diplomatic crisis, great excitement is observed in the two  camps; there is a continual coming and going. One fine day, as the  result of some unknown act,--some mysterious _casus belli_ or  declaration of war,--two armies place themselves on the march against  each other. They advance in serried ranks. All ants do not follow the  same tactics; some throw themselves out in a thicker line, while  others form in squares. But as soon as action commences the individual  regains his rights. It is a series of duels, of fierce hand-to-hand  struggles. Legs are torn away, heads are cut off by strokes of the  jaws, abdomens are disembowelled; a terrible fury animates the  combatants, and nothing will disturb them from the battle. (Fig. 8.)  By-and-by victory remains with the fiercest or the strongest; the  vanquished draw in, carrying away as far as possible their wounded and  their dead. Nothing more is seen on the field of carnage but separated  limbs or heads which strew the ground like a multitude of small black  points. Often the enmity is not extinguished after a battle, and  several defeats are necessary before the weaker swarm is destroyed or  forced to emigrate.[36]       [36] P. Huber, _Moeurs des Fourmis indigenes_, chap. ix.          Many of the chief observations--given in the words of the          original observers--as well as a summary of the facts known          regarding the social activities of ants generally, will be          found in the useful volume by Romanes in the International          Scientific Series, _Animal Intelligence_, 1882.          CHAPTER III.    METHODS OF DEFENCE.        FLIGHT--FEINT--RESISTANCE IN COMMON BY SOCIAL      ANIMALS--SENTINELS.      Studying the animal kingdom in the manner here adopted, that is to say  by passing in review the various manifestations of zoological life, we  are necessarily led to find certain industries which are opposed to  others. We have seen the various methods of hunting; but attack calls  forth defence. In the struggle for life we find the action of beings  on other beings, and the re-action of these latter; the final result  is the expression of the difference between the two according as one  or the other is stronger.    _Flight._--Just as the most rudimentary method of attack is simple  pursuit, so the most simple and natural method of defence is flight;  but if very fleet animals like hares, gazelles, and deer can escape by  simply exerting their maximum rapidity, it is not always thus, and  certain species exercise in flight perfected methods appropriate to  circumstances, and so raise this method of defence to an art.    Of all animals the Ape most skilfully directs his flight. There is no  question that in his intelligence we may find every rudiment of our  own; but of all his qualities none more nearly approximates him to us  than his courage. There are no animals, not even the great beasts of  prey, who are so brave as Man and the Ape, and who are capable of so  much presence of mind. It is perhaps this bravery which, joined to his  sociability, has most contributed to assure the supremacy of the one.  As to the other, the road has been barred to him by his better-endowed  cousin; he is disappearing before Man, and not before nature or other  animals. In thinly-inhabited regions he is still the king. It is  generally considered that the Lion is the incarnation of courage, but  he is the strongest and the best armed; there is none before whom he  need tremble. In captivity he allows himself to be struck by the  tamer, which the most miserable ape would never suffer. The Lion will  struggle with extreme energy without calculating the difference of  strength between his opponent and himself, and will resist as long as  he is able to move. The Ape directs all his courage and presence of  mind to order his flight when he has recognised a danger that is  insurmountable. He does not act like those infatuated beasts who lose  their head and rush away trembling, in their precipitation paralysing  a great part of their resources. A band of apes in flight utilises all  obstacles that can be interposed between themselves and the pursuer;  they retire without excessive haste and take advantage of the first  shelter met with; a female never abandons her young, and if a young  one remains behind, and is in danger of being taken, the old males of  the troop go back boldly to save it at the peril of their lives. In  this connection many heroic facts have been narrated. This animal has  too frequently been judged by comparison with ourselves; he has been  regarded as a human caricature and covered with ridicule. We obtain a  very much higher idea of him if we compare him with other animals.  Always and everywhere there has been a prejudiced insistence on his  defects; we perceive them so easily because they are an exaggeration  of our own; but he also possesses qualities of the first order.    As an example of flight arranged with intelligence, we have already  seen how the _Formica fusca_ profits by the difficulty experienced by  the _Polyergus_ in climbing. It hastily gains the summit of a blade of  grass, to place there in safety the larvae which the others wish to  carry away. The ruses adopted in flight are as varied as those of  attack. Every animal tries to profit as much as possible by all his  resources.    Larks, a feeble race of birds, rise higher in the air than any  rapacious bird, and this is often a cause of safety. Their greatest  enemy is the Hobby (_Hypotriorchis sublutes_). They fear him greatly,  so that as soon as one appears singing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29839"],[0,"The House in the Water: A Book of Animal Stories (#10)"],[1,"all knew what these low, snow-covered mounds meant. In the roof  of each house the cunning builders had left several tiny, crooked  openings for ventilation, and the warm air steaming up through these  made little chimney holes in the snow above. To these, now and then,  when stung by the hunger-pangs, a lynx or fox would come, and sniff  with greedy longing at the appetizing aroma. Growing desperate, the  prowler would dig down, through perhaps three feet of snow, till he  reached the stony roof of the house. On this he would tear and scratch  furiously, but in vain. Nothing less than a pick-axe would break  through that stony defence; and the beavers, perhaps dimly aware of  the futile assault upon their walls, would go on calmly nibbling  birch-sticks in their safe, warm dark.    [Illustration: \"HUNTED THROUGH THE SILENT AND PALLID AISLES OF THE  FOREST.\"]    Inside the house everything was clean and dry. All refuse from the  clean repasts of the family was scrupulously removed, and even the  entrances, far out in the pond, were kept free from litter. When food  was needed, a beaver would slip down into the dark water of the  tunnel, out into the glimmering light of the pond, and straight to the  brush pile. Selecting a suitable stick, he would tow it back to the  house, up the main entrance, and into the dry, dark chamber. When all  the tender bark was eaten off, the bare stick would be carried away  and deposited on the dam. It was an easy life; and the beavers grew  fat while all the rest of the wild kindreds, save the porcupine and  the bear, were growing lean with famine. There was absolutely nothing  to do but eat, sleep and take such exercise as they would by swimming  hither and thither at terrific speed beneath the silver armour of the  ice.    One night, however, there came to the pond an enemy of whose powers  they had never had experience. Wandering down from northwestward,  under the impulse of one of those migratory whims which sometimes give  the lie to statistics and tradition, came a sinister, dark,  slow-moving beast whose savage and crafty eyes took on a sudden flame  when they detected the white mound which hid the shore beaver-house.  The wolverene did not need that faint, almost invisible wisp of vapour  from the air-holes to tell him there were beavers below. He knew  something about beavers. His powerful forearms and mighty claws got  him to the bottom of the snow in a few seconds. Other hungry marauders  had done the same thing before, to find themselves as far off as ever  from their aim. But the wolverene was not to be balked so easily. His  cunning nose found the minute openings of the air-holes; and by  digging his claws into these little apertures he was able to put forth  his great strength and tear up some tiny fragments of frozen mud.    [Illustration: \"A SINISTER, DARK, SLOW-MOVING BEAST.\"]    If he had had the patience to keep on at his strenuous task  unremittingly for, perhaps, twenty-four hours or more, it is  conceivable that this fierce digger might have succeeded in making his  way into the chamber. There was no such implacable purpose, however,  in his attack. In a very little while he would have desisted from what  he knew to be a vain undertaking. Even had he succeeded, the beavers  would have fled before he could reach them, and taken refuge in their  burrows under the bank. But while he was still engrossed, perhaps only  amusing himself with the thought of giving the dwellers in the house a  bad quarter of an hour, it chanced that a huge lynx came stealing  along through the shadows of the trees, which lay blue and spectral in  the white moonlight. He saw the hind quarters of some unknown animal  which was busy working out a problem which he himself had striven in  vain to solve. The strange animal was plainly smaller than himself.  Moreover, he was in a position to be taken at a disadvantage. Both  these points weighed with the lynx; and he was enraged at this  attempted poaching upon what he chose to regard as his preserves.  Creeping stealthily, stealthily forward, eyes aflame and belly to the  snow, he sprang with a huge bound that landed him, claws open,  squarely on the wolverene's hind quarters.    Instantly there arose a hideous screeching, growling, spitting and  snarling, which pierced even to the ears of the beavers and sent them  scurrying wildly to their burrows in the bank. Under ordinary  circumstances the wolverene, with his dauntless courage and tremendous  strength, would have given a good account of himself with any lynx  alive. But this time, caught with head down and very busy, he stood  small chance with his powerful and lightning-swift assailant. In a  very few minutes the lynx's eviscerating claws had fairly torn him to  shreds; and thus came to a sudden close the invasion of the  wolverene.    But meanwhile, from far over the hills, moving up from the lowlands  by the sea, approached a peril which the beavers did not dream of  and could find no ingenuity to evade. Two half-breed trappers,  semi-outlaws from the Northern Peninsula, in search of fresh  hunting-grounds, had come upon this rich region of ponds and dams.    [Illustration: \"HE SPRANG WITH A HUGE BOUND THAT LANDED HIM, CLAWS OPEN,  SQUARELY ON THE WOLVERENE'S HIND QUARTERS.\"]          CHAPTER VIII    The Saving of Boy's Pond      WHEN, early in the winter, the lumbermen moved into these woods which  Jabe had cruised over, establishing their camp about two miles  down-stream from the spot where the Boy and the woodsman had had their  lean-to, Jabe came with them as boss of a gang. He had for the time  grown out of the mood for trapping. Furs were low, and there was a  \"sight\" more money for him in lumbering that winter. Popular with the  rest of the lumbermen--who most of them knew of the Boy and his  \"queer\" notions--Jabe had no difficulty in pledging them to respect  the sanctity of Boy's Pond and its inhabitants. In fact, in the  evenings around the red-hot stove, Jabe told such interesting stories  of what he and the Boy had seen together a few months before, that the  reckless, big-hearted, boisterously profane but sentimental woodsmen  were more than half inclined to declare the whole series of ponds  under the special protection of the camp. As for Boy's Pond, that  should be safe at any cost.    Not long after Christmas the Boy, taking advantage of the fact that  some fresh supplies were being sent out from the Settlement by team,  came to visit the camp. The head of the big lumber company which owned  these woods was a friend of the Boy's father, and the Boy himself was  welcome in any of the camps. His special purpose in coming now was to  see how his beavers got on in winter, and to assure himself that Jabe  had been able to protect them.    The morning after his arrival in camp he set out to visit the pond. He  went on snowshoes, of course, and carried his little Winchester as he  always did in the woods, holding tenaciously that the true lover of  peace should be ever prepared for war. The lumbermen had gone off to  work with the first of dawn; and far away to his right he heard the  axes ringing, faintly but crisply, on the biting morning air. For half  a mile he followed a solitary snowshoe trail, which he knew to be  Jabe's by the peculiar broad toe and long, trailing heel which Jabe  affected in snowshoes; and he wondered what his friend was doing in  this direction, so far from the rest of the choppers. Then Jabe's  track swerved off to the left, crossing the brook; and the Boy tramped  on over the unbroken snow.    The sound of the distant choppers soon died away, and he was alone in  the unearthly silence. The sun, not yet risen quite clear of the  hilltops, sent spectral, level, far-reaching gleams of thin  pink-and-saffron light down the alleys of the sheeted trees. The low  crunching of his snowshoes on the crisp snow sounded almost blatant in  the Boy's tensely listening ears. In spite of himself he began to  tread stealthily, as if the sound of his steps might bring some  ghostly enemy upon him from out of the whiteness.    Suddenly the sound of an axe came faintly to his ears from straight  ahead, where he knew no choppers were at work. He stopped short. That  axe was not striking wood. It was striking ice. It was chopping the  ice of Boy's Pond! What could it mean? There were no fish in that pond  to chop the ice for!    As he realized that some one was preparing to trap his beavers his  face flushed with anger, and he started forward at a run. That it was  no one from the camp he knew very well. It must be some strange  trapper who did not know that this pond was under protection. He  thought this out as he ran on; and his anger calmed down. Trappers  were a decent, understanding folk; and a word of explanation would  make things all right. There were plenty of other beaver ponds in that  neighbourhood.    Pressing through the white-draped ranks of the young fir-trees, he  came out suddenly upon the edge of the pond, and halted an instant in  irresolution. Two dark-visaged men--his quick eye knew them for  half-breeds--were busy on the snow about twenty paces above the low  mound which marked the main beaver house. They had a number of stakes  with them; and they were cutting a series of holes in a circle. From  what Jabe had told him of the Indian methods, he saw at once that  these were not regular trappers, but poachers, who were violating the  game laws and planning to annihilate the whole beaver colony by  fencing in its brush pile.    The Boy realized now that the situation was a delicate if not a  dangerous one. For an instant he thought of going back to camp for  help; but one of the men was on his knees, fixing the stakes, and the  other was already chopping what appeared to be the last hole. Delay  might mean the death of several of his precious beavers. Indignation  and compassion together urged him on, and his young face hardened in"]]]
