They have extraordinary amiable patience,  and find the young ones a perpetual source of charming amusement.  They look at one another, the elder ones, and laugh and comment,  while the two young ones mix themselves and the table into a  lemon-milk-orange-tea-sugar-biscuit-cake-chocolate mess. This inordinate  Italian amiable patience with their young monkeys is astonishing. It  makes the monkeys more monkey-like, and self-conscious incredibly, so  that a baby has all the tricks of a Babylonian harlot, making eyes and  trying new pranks. Till at last one sees the southern Holy Family as an  unholy triad of imbecility.    Meanwhile I munched my Infant-Jesus-and-Dove arrangement, which was  rather like eating thin glass, so hard and sharp. It was made of almond  and white of egg presumably, and was not so bad if you could eat it at  all. It was a Christmas relic.--And I watched the Holy Family across the  narrow board, and tried not to look all I felt.           *       *       *       *       *    Going on deck as soon as possible, we watched the loading of barrels of  wine into the hold--a mild and happy-go-lucky process. The ship seemed  to be almost as empty of cargo as of passengers. Of the latter, we were  apparently twelve adults, all told, and the three children. And as for  cargo, there were the wooden chests of the officer, and these fourteen  barrels of wine from Trapani. The last were at length settled more or  less firm, the owner, or the responsible landsman seeing to it. No one  on the ship seemed to be responsible for anything. And four of the  innumerable crew were replacing the big planks over the hold. It was  curious how forlorn the ship seemed to feel, now she was ready for sea  again. Her innumerable crew did not succeed in making her alive. She ran  her course like a lost soul across the Mid-Mediterranean.           *       *       *       *       *    Outside the harbour the sun was sinking, gorgeous gold and red the sky,  and vast, beyond the darkening islands of the Egades group. Coming as we  did from the east side of the island, where dawn beyond the Ionian sea  is the day's great and familiar event: so decisive an event, that as the  light appears along the sea's rim, so do my eyes invariably open and  look at it, and know it is dawn, and as the night-purple is fused back,  and a little scarlet thrills towards the zenith, invariably, day by day,  I feel I must get up: coming from the east, shut off hermetically from  the west by the steep spikes of the mountains at our back, we felt this  sunset in the African sea terrible and dramatic. It seemed much more  magnificent and tragic than our Ionian dawn, which has always a  suggestion of a flower opening. But this great red, trumpet-flaring  sunset had something African, half-sinister, upon the sea: and it seemed  so far off, in an unknown land. Whereas our Ionian dawn always seems  near and familiar and happy.    A different goddess the Eryx Astarte, the woman Ashtaroth, _Erycina  ridens_ must have been, in her prehstoric dark smiling, watching the  fearful sunsets beyond the Egades, from our gold-lighted Apollo of the  Ionian east. She is a strange goddess to me, this Erycina Venus, and the  west is strange and unfamiliar and a little fearful, be it Africa or be  it America.    Slowly at sunset we moved out of the harbour. And almost as we passed  the bar, away in front we saw, among the islands, the pricking of a  quick pointed light. Looking back, we saw the light at the harbour  entrance twitching: and the remote, lost town beginning to glimmer. And  night was settling down upon the sea, through the crimsoned purple of  the last afterglow.    The islands loomed big as we drew nearer, dark in the thickening  darkness. Overhead a magnificent evening-star blazed above the open sea,  giving me a pang at the heart, for I was so used to see her hang just  above the spikes of the mountains, that I felt she might fall, having  the space beneath.    Levanzo and the other large island were quite dark: absolutely dark,  save for one beam of a lighthouse low down in the distance. The wind was  again strong and cold: the ship had commenced her old slither and heave,  slither and heave, which mercifully we had forgotten. Overhead were  innumerable great stars active as if they were alive in the sky. I saw  Orion high behind us, and the dog-star glaring. And _swish!_ went the  sea as we took the waves, then after a long trough, _swish!_ This  curious rhythmic swishing and hollow drumming of a steamer at sea has a  narcotic, almost maddening effect on the spirit, a long, hissing burst  of waters, then the hollow roll, and again the upheaval to a sudden  hiss-ss-ss!    A bell had clanged and we knew the crew were once more feeding. At every  moment of the day and presumably of the night, feeding was going on--or  coffee-drinking.           *       *       *       *       *    We were summoned to dinner. Our young woman was already seated: and a  fat uniformed mate or purser or official of some sort was finishing off  in the distance. The pale professor also appeared: and at a certain  distance down the table sat a little hard-headed grey man in a long grey  alpaca travelling coat. Appeared the beloved macaroni with tomato sauce:  no food for the sea. I put my hopes on the fish. Had I not seen the  cook making whiting bite their own tails viciously?--The fish appeared.  And what was it? Fried ink-pots. A _calamaio_ is an ink-pot: also it is  a polyp, a little octopus which, alas, frequents the Mediterranean and  squirts ink if offended. This polyp with its tentacles is cut up and  fried, and reduced to the consistency of boiled celluloid. It is  esteemed a delicacy: but is tougher than indiarubber, gristly through  and through.    I have a peculiar aversion to these ink-pots. Once in Liguria we had a  boat of our own and paddled with the peasant paddlers. Alessandro caught  ink-pots: and like this. He tied up a female by a string in a cave--the  string going through a convenient hole in her end. There she lived, like  an Amphitrite's wire-haired terrier tied up, till Alessandro went  a-fishing. Then he towed her, like a poodle behind. And thus, like a  poodly-bitch, she attracted hangers-on in the briny seas. And these poor  polyp inamorati were the victims. They were lifted as prey on board,  where I looked with horror on their grey, translucent tentacles and  large, cold, stony eyes. The she-polyp was towed behind again. But after  a few days she died.    And I think, even for creatures so awful-looking, this method is  indescribably base, and shows how much lower than an octopus even, is  lordly man.    Well, we chewed a few ends of oil-fried ink-pots, and gave it up. The  Cagliari girl gave up too: the professor had not even tried. Only the  hard-headed grey man in the alpaca coat chewed animatedly, with bouncing  jaws. Mountains of calamaio remained for the joyous blue-bottles.    Arrived the inevitable meat--this long piece of completely tasteless  undercut in innumerable grey-brown slices. Oh, Italy! The professor  fled.    Arrived the wash-leather pears, the apples, the oranges--we saved an  apple for a happier hour.    Arrived coffee, and, as a magnificent treat, a few well-known pastries.  They all taste wearily alike. The young woman shakes her head. I shake  mine, but the q-b, like a child, is pleased. Most pleased of all,  however, are the blue-bottles, who dart in a black-alpaca bunch to the  tin altar, and there loudly buzz, wildly, above the sallow cakes.    The citron-cheeked, dry one, however, cares darkly nothing for cakes. He  comes once more to twit us about wine. So much so that the Cagliari girl  orders a glass of Marsala: and I must second her. So there we are, three  little glasses of brown liquid. The Cagliari girl sips hers and suddenly  flees. The q-b sips hers with infinite caution, and quietly retires. I  finish the q-b's little glass, and my own, and the voracious blow-flies  buzz derisively and excited. The yellow-cheeked one has disappeared with  the bottle.    From the professorial cabin faint wails, sometimes almost fierce, as one  or another is going to be ill. Only a thin door is between this  state-room and them. The most down-trodden frayed ancient rag of a man  goes discreetly with basins, trying not to let out glimpses of the awful  within. I climb up to look at the vivid, drenching stars, to breathe the  cold wind, to see the dark sea sliding. Then I too go to the cabin, and  watch the sea run past the porthole for a minute, and insert myself like  the meat in a sandwich into the tight lower bunk. Oh, infinitesimal  cabin, where we sway like two matches in a match box! Oh strange, but  even yet excellent gallop of a ship at sea.           *       *       *       *       *    I slept not so badly through the stifled, rolling night--in fact later  on slept soundly. And the day was growing bright when I peered through  the porthle, the sea was much smoother. It was a brilliant clear  morning. I made haste and washed myself cursorily in the saucer that  dribbled into a pail in a corner: there was not space even for one  chair, this saucer was by my bunk-head. And I went on deck.    Ah the lovely morning! Away behind us the sun was just coming above the  sea's horizon, and the sky all golden, all a joyous, fire-heated gold,  and the sea was glassy bright, the wind gone still, the waves sunk into  long, low undulations, the foam of the wake was pale ice-blue in the  yellow air. Sweet, sweet wide morning on the sea, with the sun coming,  swimming up, and a tall sailing bark, with her flat fore-ladder of sails  delicately across the light, and a far-far steamer on the electric vivid  morning horizon.    The lovely dawn: the lovely pure, wide morning in the mid-sea, so  golden-aired and delighted,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3721"],[0,"France and England in North America, Part I: Pioneers of France in the New World (#10)"],[1,"with him. On this, Laudonniere, at the head of  twenty soldiers, proceeded to the Indian town, placed a guard at the  opening of the great lodge, entered with his arquebusiers, and seated  himself without ceremony in the highest place. Here, to show his  displeasure, he remained in silence for half an hour. At length he  spoke, renewing his demand. For some moments Satouriona made no  reply; then he coldly observed that the sight of so many armed men had  frightened the prisoners away. Laudonniere grew peremptory, when the  chief's son, Athore, went out, and presently returned with the two  Indians, whom the French led back to Fort Caroline.    Satouriona, says Laudonniere, \"was wonderfully offended with his  bravado, and bethought himselfe by all meanes how he might be revenged  of us.\" He dissembled for the time, and presently sent three of his  followers to the fort with a gift of pumpkins; though under this show  of good-will the outrage rankled in his breast, and he never forgave it.  The French had been unfortunate in their dealings with the Indians. They  had alienated old friends in vain attempts to make new ones.    Vasseur, with the Swiss ensign Arlac, a sergeant, and ten soldiers,  went up the river early in September to carry back the two prisoners  to Outina. Laudonniere declares that they sailed eighty leagues, which  would have carried them far above Lake Monroe; but it is certain that  his reckoning is grossly exaggerated. Their boat crawled up the hazy St.  John's, no longer a broad lake like expanse, but a narrow and tortuous  stream, winding between swampy forests, or through the vast savanna,  a verdant sea of brushes and grass. At length they came to a village  called Mayarqua, and thence, with the help of their oars, made their way  to another cluster of wigwams, apparently on a branch of the main  river. Here they found Outina himself, whom, prepossessed with ideas of  feudality, they regarded as the suzerain of a host of subordinate lords  and princes, ruling over the surrounding swamps and pine barrens. Outina  gratefully received the two prisoners whom Laudonniere had sent to  propitiate him, feasted the wonderful strangers, and invited them to  join him on a raid against his rival, Potanou. Laudonniere had promised  to join Satouriona against Outina, and Vasseur now promised to join  Outina against Potanon, the hope of finding gold being in both cases the  source of this impolitic compliance. Vasseur went back to Fort Caroline  with five of the men, and left Arlac with the remaining five to fight  the battles of Ontina.    The warriors mustered to the number of some two hundred, and the  combined force of white men and red took up their march. The wilderness  through which they passed has not yet quite lost its characteristic  features,--the bewildering monotony of the pine barrens, with their  myriads of bare gray trunks and their canopy of perennial green, through  which a scorching sun throws spots and streaks of yellow light, here on  an undergrowth of dwarf palmetto, and there on dry sands half hidden  by tufted wire-grass, and dotted with the little mounds that mark the  burrows of the gopher; or those oases in the desert, the \"hummocks,\"  with their wild, redundant vegetation, their entanglement of trees,  bushes, and vines, their scent of flowers and song of birds; or the  broad sunshine of the savanna, where they waded to the neck in grass; or  the deep swamp, where, out of the black and root-encumbered slough, rise  the huge buttressed trunks of the Southern cypress, the gray Spanish  moss drooping from every bough and twig, wrapping its victims like a  drapery of tattered cobwebs, and slowly draining away their life,  for even plants devour each other, and play their silent parts in the  universal tragedy of nature.    The allies held their way through forest, savanna, and swamp, with  Outina's Indians in the front, till they neared the hostile villages,  when the modest warriors fell to the rear, and yielded the post of honor  to the Frenchmen.    An open country lay before them, with rough fields of maize, beans, and  pumpkins, and the palisades of an Indian town. Their approach was seen,  and the warriors of Potanon swarmed out to meet them; but the sight of  the bearded strangers, the flash and report of the fire-arms, and the  fall of their foremost chief, shot through the brain by Arlac, filled  them with consternation, and they fled within their defences. Pursuers  and pursued entered pell-mell together. The place was pillaged and  burned, its inmates captured or killed, and the victors returned  triumphant.            CHAPTER V.    1564, 1565.    CONSPIRACY.    In the little world of Fort Caroline, a miniature France, cliques and  parties, conspiracy and sedition, were fast stirring into life.  Hopes had been dashed, and wild expectations had come to naught. The  adventurers had found, not conquest and gold, but a dull exile in  a petty fort by a hot and sickly river, with hard labor, bad fare,  prospective famine, and nothing to break the weary sameness but some  passing canoe or floating alligator. Gathered in knots, they nursed each  other's wrath, and inveighed against the commandant. Why are we put on  half-rations, when he told us that provision should be made for a full  year? Where are the reinforcements and supplies that he said should  follow us from France? And why is he always closeted with Ottigny,  Arlac, and this and that favorite, when we, men of blood as good as  theirs, cannot gain his ear for a moment?    The young nobles, of whom there were many, were volunteers, who had paid  their own expenses in expectation of a golden harvest, and they chafed  in impatience and disgust. The religious element in the colony--unlike  the former Huguenot emigration to Brazil--was evidently subordinate.  The adventurers thought more of their fortunes than of their faith;  yet there were not a few earnest enough in the doctrine of Geneva to  complain loudly and bitterly that no ministers had been sent with them.  The burden of all grievances was thrown upon Laudonniere, whose greatest  errors seem to have arisen from weakness and a lack of judgment,--fatal  defects in his position.    The growing discontent was brought to a partial head by one La Roquette,  who gave out that, high up the river, he had discovered by magic a  mine of gold and silver, which would give each of them a share of ten  thousand crowns, besides fifteen hundred thousand for the King. But for  Laudonniere, he said, their fortunes would all be made. He found an ally  in a gentleman named Genre, one of Laudonniere's confidants, who, while  still professing fast adherence to his interests, is charged by him with  plotting against his life. \"This Genre,\" he says, \"secretly enfourmed  the Souldiers that were already suborned by La Roquette, that I would  deprive them of this great game, in that I did set them dayly on worke,  not sending them on every side to discover the Countreys; therefore  that it were a good deede to dispatch mee out of the way, and to choose  another Captaine in my place.\" The soldiers listened too well. They made  a flag of an old shirt, which they carried with them to the rampart  when they went to their work, at the same time wearing their arms; and,  pursues Laudonniere, \"these gentle Souldiers did the same for none other  ende but to have killed mee and my Lieutenant also, if by chance I had  given them any hard speeches.\" About this time, overheating himself, he  fell ill, and was confined to his quarters. On this, Genre made advances  to the apothecary, urging him to put arsenic into his medicine; but the  apothecary shrugged his shoulders. They next devised a scheme to blow  him up by hiding a keg of gunpowder under his bed; but here, too, they  failed. Hints of Genre's machinations reaching the ears of Laudonniere,  the culprit fled to the woods, whence he wrote repentant letters, with  full confession, to his commander.    Two of the ships meanwhile returned to France, the third, the \"Breton,\"  remaining at anchor opposite the fort. The malcontents took the  opportunity to send home charges against Laudonniere of peculation,  favoritism, and tyranny.    On the fourth of September, Captain Bourdet, apparently a private  adventurer, had arrived from France with a small vessel. When he  returned, about the tenth of November, Laudonniere persuaded him to  carry home seven or eight of the malcontent soldiers. Bourdet left some  of his sailors in their place. The exchange proved most disastrous.  These pirates joined with others whom they had won over, stole  Laudonniere's two pinnaces, and set forth on a plundering excursion to  the West Indies. They took a small Spanish vessel off the coast of Cuba,  but were soon compelled by famine to put into Havana and give themselves  up. Here, to make their peace with the authorities, they told all they  knew of the position and purposes of their countrymen at Fort Caroline,  and thus was forged the thunderbolt soon to be hurled against the  wretched little colony.    On a Sunday morning, Francois de la Caille [13] came to Laudonniere's  quarters, and, in the name of the whole company, requested him to come  to the parade ground. He complied, and issuing forth, his inseparable  Ottigny at his side, he saw some thirty of his officers, soldiers, and  gentlemen volunteers waiting before the building with fixed and sombre  countenances. La Caille, advancing, begged leave to read, in behalf  of the rest, a paper which he held in his hand. It opened with  protestations of duty and obedience; next came complaints of hard work,  starvation, and broken promises, and a request that the petitioners  should be allowed to embark in the vessel lying in the river, and cruise  along the Spanish Main, in order to procure provisions by purchase  \"or otherwise.\" In short, the flower of the company wished to turn  buccaneers.
