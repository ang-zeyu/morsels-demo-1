If a  barrister below the rank of serjeant was invited to take a seat on the  Bench he invariably conformed to the recognised custom and \"took the  coif\"--became a serjeant-at-law--before he was sworn as one of his (or  her) Majesty's judges. This explains the term \"brother\" applied by  judges when addressing serjeants pleading before them in Court. \"Taking  the coif\" had a curious origin. It was customary in very early times for  the clergy to add to their clerical duties that of a legal practitioner,  by which considerable fees were obtained, and when the Canon law forbade  them engaging in all secular occupations the remuneration they had  obtained from the law-courts proved too strong a temptation to evade the  new law. They continued therefore to practise in the Courts, and to hide  their clerical identity they concealed the tonsure by covering the upper  part of their heads with a black cap or coif. When ultimately clerical  barristers were driven from the law-courts, the \"coif\" or black patch on  the crown of a barrister's wig became the symbol of the rank of  serjeant-at-law. That this distinguishing mark has been, in later years,  occasionally misunderstood is illustrated in the story of Serjeant  Allen and Sir Henry Keating, Q.C., who were opposed to one another in a  case before the Assize Court at Stafford. During the hearing of the case  a violent altercation had taken place between them, but when the Court  rose they left the building together, walking amicably to their  lodgings. Two men who had been in Court and had heard their wrangle were  following behind them, when one said to the other: \"If you was in  trouble, Bill, which o' them two tip-top 'uns would you have to defend  you?\"--\"Well, Jim,\" was the reply, \"I should pitch upon this 'un,\"  pointing to the Q.C. \"Then you'd be a fool,\" said his companion; \"the  fellow with the _sore head_ is worth six of t'other 'un.\"    There used to be a student joke against the serjeants. \"Why is a  serjeant's speech like a tailor's goose?\"--\"Because it is hot and  heavy.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"Taking silk,\" or becoming a K.C. and a senior at the Bar, originated at  a much later date than that of serjeant-at-law. Lord Bacon was the first  to be recognised as Queen's Counsel, but this distinction arose from his  position as legal adviser to Queen Elizabeth, and did not indicate the  existence of a senior body (as K.C. does now) among the barristers of  that period. The institution of the rank dates from the days of Charles  II, when Sir Francis North, Lord Guildford, was created King's Counsel  by a writ issued under the Great Seal. As was customary in the case of a  barrister proposing to \"take the coif,\" so in that of one proposing to  \"take silk\"; he intimates to the seniors already holding the rank that  he intends to apply for admission to the body. A story is current in the  Temple that when Mr. Justice Eve \"took silk\" the usual notification of  his intention was sent to the seniors, and from one of them he received  the following reply: \"My dear Eve, whether you wear silk or a fig-leaf,  I do not care.--A Dam.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Our selection of facetiae of the English Bar, therefore, naturally opens  with stories of the serjeants-at-law, and one of the best-known members  of that body in early days was Serjeant Hill, a celebrated lawyer, who  was also somewhat remarkable for absence of mind, which was attributed  to the earnestness with which he devoted himself to his professional  duties.    On the very day when he was married, he had an intricate case on hand,  and forgot his engagement, until reminded of his waiting bride, and that  the legal time for performing the ceremony had nearly elapsed. He then  quitted law for the church; after the ceremony, the serjeant returned to  his books and his papers, having forgotten the _cause_ he had been  engaged in during the morning, until again reminded by his clerk that  the assembled company impatiently awaited his presence at dinner.    Being once on Circuit, and having occasion to refer to a law authority,  he had recourse, as usual, to his bag; but, to the astonishment of the  Court, instead of a volume of Viner's abridgment, he took out a specimen  candlestick, the property of a Birmingham traveller, whose bag Serjeant  Hill had brought into Court by mistake.    A learned serjeant kept the Court waiting one morning for a few minutes.  The business of the Court commenced at nine. \"Brother,\" said the judge,  \"you are behind your time this morning. The Court has been waiting for  you.\"--\"I beg your lordship's pardon,\" replied the serjeant; \"I am  afraid I was longer than usual in dressing.\"--\"Oh,\" returned the judge,  \"I can dress in five minutes at any time.\"--\"Indeed!\" said the learned  brother, a little surprised for the moment; \"but in that my dog Shock  beats your lordship hollow, for he has nothing to do but to shake his  coat, and thinks himself fit for any company.\"    Serjeant Davy, when at the height of his professional career, once  received a large brief on which a fee of two guineas only was marked on  the back. His client asked him if he had read the brief. Pointing with  his finger to the fee, Davy replied: \"As far as that I have read, and  for the life of me I can read no further.\" Of the same eminent serjeant  in his earlier years an Old Baily story is told. Judge Gould, who  presided, asked: \"Who is concerned for the prisoner?\"--\"I am concerned  for him, my lord,\" said Davy, \"and very much concerned after what I have  just heard.\"    If Serjeant Davy was concerned about his client, Serjeant Miller had no  such scruple about the man charged with horse stealing whom he  successfully defended, although the evidence convinced the judge and  everybody in the Court that there ought to have been a conviction. When  the trial was over and the prisoner had been acquitted, the judge said  to him: \"Prisoner, luckily for you, you have been found Not Guilty by  the jury, but you know perfectly well you stole that horse. You may as  well tell the truth, as no harm can happen to you now by a confession,  for you cannot be tried again. Now tell me, did you not steal that  horse?\" \"Well, my lord,\" replied the man, \"I always thought I did, until  I heard my counsel's speech, but now I begin to think I didn't.\"           *       *       *       *       *    In the days of \"riding\" and \"driving circuit,\" and even later, the  Circuit mess was a very popular institution with circuiteers, and was  made the occasion of much merriment. After the table had been cleared a  fictitious charge would be made against one of the barristers present,  and a mock tribunal was immediately constituted before which he was  arraigned and his case duly set forth with all solemnity. The victim was  invariably fined--generally in wine, which had to be paid at once, and  consumed before the company retired to bed. On one such occasion  Serjeant Prime, who is represented as a good-natured but rather dull  man, and as a barrister wearisome beyond comparison, was engaged in an  important case in an over-crowded courtroom. He had been speaking for  three hours, when a boy, seated on a beam above the heads of the  audience, overcome by the heat and the serjeant's monotonous tones, fell  asleep, and, losing his balance, tumbled down on the people below. The  incident was made the subject of a charge against the serjeant at the  mess, and he was duly sentenced to pay a fine of two dozen of wine,  which he did with the greatest good humour.    Serjeant Wilkins, on one occasion, on defending a prisoner, said: \"Drink  has upon some an elevating, upon others a depressing, effect; indeed,  there is a report, as we all know, that an eminent judge, when at the  Bar, was obliged to resort to heavy drinking in the morning, to reduce  himself to the level of the judges.\" Lord Denman, the judge, who had no  love for Wilkins, bridled up instantly. His voice trembled with  indignation as he uttered the words: \"Where is the report, sir? Where is  it?\" There was a death-like silence. Wilkins calmly turned round to the  judge and said: \"It was burnt, my lord, in the Temple fire.\" The  effect of this was considerable, and it was a long time before order  could be restored, but Lord Denman was one of the first to acknowledge  the wit of the answer.    Difference of manner or temperament sometimes gives point to the  collisions which occasionally occur in Court between rival counsel.  Serjeant Wilkins, who had an inflated style of oratory, was once opposed  in a case to Serjeant Thomas, whose manner of delivery was lighter and  more lively. On the conclusion of a heavy bombardment of ponderous  Johnsonian sentences from the former, Thomas rose, and, with his eyes  fixed on his opponent, prefaced his address to the jury with the words,  delivered with much solemnity of manner and intonation: \"And now the  hurly-burly's done.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Dunning was defending a gentleman in an action brought from _crim. con._  with the plaintiff's wife. The chief witness for the plaintiff was the  lady's maid, a clever, self-composed person, who spoke confidently as to  seeing the defendant in bed with her mistress. Dunning, on rising to  cross-examine her, first made her take off her bonnet, that they might  have a good view of her face, but this did not discompose her, as she  knew she was good-looking. He then arranged his brief, solemnly drew up  his shirt sleeves, and then began: \"Are you sure it was not your master  you saw in bed with your mistress?\"--\"Perfectly sure.\"--\"What, do you  pretend to say you can be certain when the head only appeared from the  bedclothes, and that enveloped in a nightcap?\"--\"Quite certain.\"--\"You  have often found occasion, then, to see your master in his  nightcap?\"--\"Yes--very frequently.\"--\"Now, young"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3003"],[0,"Wild Flowers (#10)"],[1,"large settlements.    The special importance of producing a quantity of fertile seed  has led the gentians to adopt proterandry - one of the commonest,  because most successful, methods of insuring it. The anthers,  coming to maturity early, shed their pollen on the bumblebees  that have been first attracted by their favorite color and the  enticing fringes before they crawl half way down the tube where  they can reach the nectar secreted in the walls. After the pollen  has been carried from the early flowers, and the stamens begin to  wither, up rises the pistil to be fertilized with pollen brought  from a newly opened blossom by the bee or butterfly. The late  development of the pistil accounts for the error often stated,  that some gentians have none. No doubt the fringe, which most  scientists regard simply as an additional attraction for winged  insects, serves a double purpose in entangling the feet of ants  and other crawlers that would climb over the edge to pilfer  sweets clearly intended for the bumblebee alone.    Fifteen species of gentian have been gathered during a half-hour  walk in Switzerland, where the pastures are spread with sheets of  blue. Indeed, one can little realize the beauty of these heavenly  flowers who has not seen them among the Alps.    The FIVE-FLOWERED or STIFF GENTIAN, or AGUE-WEED (Gentiana  quinquefolia; G. quinqueflora of Gray) has its five-parted,  small, picotee-edged blue flowers arranged in clusters, not  exceeding seven, at the ends of the branches or seated in the  leaf-axils. The slender, branching, ridged stem may rise only two  inches in dry soil; or perhaps two feet in rich, moist, rocky  ground, where it grows to perfection, especially in mountainous  regions. From Canada to Florida and westward to Missouri is its  range, and beginning to bloom in August southward, it may not be  found until September in the Catskills, and in October it is  still in its glory in Ontario. The colorless, bitter juice of  many of the gentian tribe has long been valued as a tonic in  medicine. Evidently the butterflies that pilfer this \"ague-weed,\"  and the bees that are its legitimate feasters, find something  more delectable in its blue walls.    A deep, intense blue is the CLOSED, BLIND, or BOTTLE GENTIAN (G.  Andrewsii), more truly the color of the \"male bluebird's back,\"  to which Thoreau likened the paler fringed gentian. Rarely some  degenerate plant bears white flowers. As it is a perennial, we  are likely to find it in its old haunts year after year;  nevertheless its winged seeds sail far abroad to seek pastures  new. This gentian also shows a preference for moist soil. Gray  thought that it expanded slightly, and for a short time only in  sunshine, but added that, although it is proterandrous, i.e. it  matures and sheds its pollen before its stigma is susceptible to  any, he believed it finally fertilized itself by the lobes of the  stigma curling backward until they touched the anthers. But Gray  was doubtless mistaken. Several authorities have recently proved  that the flower is adapted to bumblebees. It offers them the last  feast of the season, for although it comes into bloom in August  southward, farther northward - and it extends from Quebec to the  Northwest Territory - it lasts through October.    Now, how can a bumblebee enter this inhospitable-looking flower?  If he did but know it, it keeps closed for his special benefit,  having no fringes or hairs to entangle the feet of crawling  pilferers, and no better way of protecting its nectar from rain  and marauding butterflies that are not adapted to its needs. But  he is a powerful fellow. Watch him alight on a cluster of  blossoms, select the younger, nectar-bearing ones, that are  distinctly marked white against a light-blue background at the  mouth of the corolla for his special guidance. Old flowers from  which the nectar has been removed turn deep reddish purple, and  the white pathfinders become indistinct. With some difficulty, it  is true, the bumblebee (B. Americanorum) thrusts his tongue  through the valve of the chosen flower where the five plaited  lobes overlap one another; then he pushes with all his might  until his head having passed the entrance most of his body  follows, leaving only his hind legs and the tip of his abdomen  sticking out as he makes the circuit. He has much sense as well  as muscle, and does not risk imprisonment in what must prove a  tomb by a total and unnecessary disappearance within the bottle.  Presently he backs out, brushes the pollen from his head and  thorax into his baskets, and is off to fertilize an older,  stigmatic flower with the few grains of quickening dust that must  remain on his velvety head.      WILD BLUE PHLOX    (Phlox divaricata)  Phlox family    Flowers - Pale lilac blue, slightly fragrant, borne on sticky  pedicels, in loose, spreading clusters. Calyx with 5 long, sharp  teeth. Corolla of 5 flat lobes, indented like the top of a heart,  and united into a slender tube; 5 unequal, straight, short  stamens in corolla tube; 1 pistil with 3 stigmas. Stem: to 2 ft.  high, finely coated with sticky hairs above, erect or spreading,  and producing leafy shoots from base. Leaves: Of flowering stem -  opposite, oblong, tapering to a point; of sterile shoots - oblong  or egg-shaped, not pointed, 1 to 2 in. long.  Preferred habitat - Moist, rocky woods.  Flowering Season - April-June.  Distribution - Eastern Canada to Florida, Minnesota to Arkansas.    The merest novice can have no difficulty in naming the flower  whose wild and cultivated relations abound throughout North  America, the almost exclusive home of the genus, although it is  to European horticulturists, as usual the first to see the  possibilities in our native flowers, that we owe the gay hybrids  in our gardens. Mr. Drummond, a collector from the Botanical  Society of Glasgow, early in the thirties sent home the seeds of  a species from Texas, which became the ancestor of the gorgeous  annuals, the Drummond phloxes of commerce today; and although he  died of fever in Cuba before the plants became generally known,  not even his kinsman, the author of \"Natural Law in the Spiritual  World,\" has done more to immortalize the family name.    While the wild blue phlox is sometimes cultivated, it is the  GARDEN PHLOX (P. paniculata), common in woods and thickets from  Pennsylvania to Illinois and southward, that under a gardener's  care bears the large terminal clusters of purple, magenta,  crimson, pink, and white flowers abundant in old-fashioned, hardy  borders. From these it has escaped so freely in many sections of  the North and East as to be counted among the local wildflowers.  Unless the young offshoots are separated from the parent and  given a nook of their own, the flower quickly reverts to the  original type. European cultivators claim that the most brilliant  colors are obtained by crossing annual with perennial phloxes.    WILD SWEET WILLIAM (P. maculata), another perennial much sought  by cultivators, loves the moisture of low woods and the  neighborhood of streams in the Middle and Western States when it  is free to choose its habitat; but it, too, has so freely escaped  from gardens farther north into dry and dusty roadsides, that  anyone who has passed the ruins of Hawthorne's little red cottage  at Lenox, for example, and seen the way his wife's clump of white  phlox under his study window has spread to cover an acre of  hillside, would suppose it to be luxuriating in its favorite  locality. This variety of the species (var. Candida) lacks the  purplish flecks on stem and lower leaves responsible for the  specific name of the type. Pinkish purple or pink blossoms are  borne in a rather narrow, elongated panicle on the typical Sweet  William.    Most members of the phlox family resort to the trick of coating  the upper stem and the peduncles immediately below the flowers  with a sticky secretion in which crawling insects, intent on  pilfering sweets, meet their death, just as birds are caught on  limed twigs. Butterflies, for whom phloxes have narrowed their  tubes to the exclusion of most other insects, are their  benefactors; but long-tongued bees and flies often seek their  nectar. Indeed, the number of strictly butterfly-flowers is  surprisingly small.      VIRGINIA COWSLIP; TREE or SMOOTH LUNGWORT; BLUE-BELLS    (Mertensia Virginica)  Borage family    Flowers - Pinkish in bud, afterward purplish blue, fading to  light blue; about 1 in. long, tubular, funnel form, the tube of  corolla not crested; spreading or hanging on slender pedicels in  showy, loose clusters at end of smooth stem from 1 to 2 ft. high;  stamens 5, inserted on corolla; 1 pistil; ovary of 4 divisions.  Leaves: Large, entire, alternate, veiny, oblong or obovate, the  upper ones seated on stem; lower very large ones diminishing  toward base into long petioles; at first rich, dark purple,  afterward pale bluish gray. Fruit: 4 seed-like little nuts,  leathery, wrinkled when mature.  Preferred Habitat - Alluvial ground, low meadows, and along  streams.  Flowering Season - March-May.  Distribution - Southern Canada to South Carolina and Kansas, west  to Nebraska; most abundant in middle West.    Not to be outdone by its cousins the heliotrope and the  forget-me-not, this lovely and far more showy spring flower has  found its way into the rockwork and sheltered, moist nooks of  many gardens, especially in England, where Mr. W. Robinson, who  has appealed for its wider cultivation in that perennially  charming book, \"The English Flower Garden,\" says of the  Mertensias: \"There is something about them more beautiful in form  of foliage and stem, and in the graceful way in which they rise  to panicles of blue, than in almost any other family....  Handsomest of all is the Virginia cowslip.\" And yet Robinson  never saw the alluvial meadows in the Ohio Valley blued with  lovely masses of the plant in April.    A great variety "]]]
