In the next Lecture we shall penetrate to the very  heart of this singular religion, as we discuss its terrible sacrifices,  its institutions, and its doctrines concerning this world and the life  to come. And here, again, we shall find cause for amazement in the  striking analogies it presents to the rites and institutions of other  religions much nearer home. Meanwhile, observe that in examining the  purely mythological portion of the subject which we have passed in  review to-day, we have seen that there is not a single law manifested by  the mythologies of the ancient world, which had not its parallel  manifestations in Mexico before it was discovered by the Europeans. The  great gods, derived from a dramatized nature--animism, with the  fetishism that springs from it, occupying the basement, if I may so  express myself, beneath these mythological conceptions--in the midst of  all a tendency manifested from time to time towards a purer and more  spiritual conception of the adorable Being--all re-appears and all is  combined in Mexico, even down to something like an incarnation, and the  hope of the coming of the god of justice and of goodness who will  restore all things. Indeed, I know not where else one could look for so  complete a resume of what has constituted in all places, now the  smallness and wretchedness, now the grandeur and nobleness, of that  incomprehensible and irresistible factor of human nature which we call  _religion_. The \"eternally religious\" element in man had stamped its  mark upon the unknown Mexico as upon all other lands; and when at last  it was discovered, evidence might have been found, had men been able to  appreciate it, that there too, however frightfully misinterpreted, the  Divine breath had been felt.    It is the spiritually-minded who must learn the art of discerning the  spirit wherever it reveals itself; and when the horrors rise up before  us of which religion has more than once in the course of history been  the cause or the pretext, and we are almost tempted to ask whether this  attribute of human nature has really worked more good than ill in the  destinies of our race, we may remember that the same question might be  asked of all the proudest attributes of our humanity. Take polity or the  art of governing human societies. To what monstrous aberrations has it  not given birth! Take science. Through what lamentable and woful errors  has it not pursued its way! Take art. How gross were its beginnings, and  how often has it served, not to elevate man, but to stimulate his vilest  and most degrading passions! Yet, who would wish to live without  government, science or art?    Let us apply the same test to religion. The horrors it has caused cannot  weigh against the final and overmastering good which it produces; and  its annals, too often written in blood, should teach us how to guide it,  how to purify it from all that corrupts and debases it. We shall see at  the close of our Lectures what that directing, normalizing, purifying  principle is that must hold the helm of religion and guide it in its  evolution. Meanwhile, let no imperfection, no repulsiveness--nay, no  atrocity even--blind us to the ideal value of what we have been  considering, any more than we should allow the disasters that spring  from the use of fire to make us cease to rank it amongst the great  blessings of our earthly life.          LECTURE III.    THE SACRIFICES, SACERDOTAL AND MONASTIC INSTITUTIONS, ESCHATOLOGY AND  COSMOGONY OF MEXICO.      LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,    In our last Lecture we passed in review the chief gods and goddesses of  ancient Mexico, and you might see how, in spite of very characteristic  differences, the Mexican mythology obeys the same law of formation that  manifests itself among the peoples of the Old World, thereby proving  once more that the religious development of humanity is not arbitrary,  that it proceeds in every case under the direction of the inherent and  inalienable principles of the human mind.    To-day we are to complete the internal study of the Mexican religion, by  dealing with its sacrifices, its institutions, and its eschatological  and cosmogonical doctrines. We begin with those sacrifices of which I  have already spoken as so numerous and so horrible.      I.    We have some little difficulty in our times, familiar as we are with  spiritual conceptions of God and the divine purposes, in comprehending  the extreme importance which sacrifices, offerings, gifts to the divine  being, assumed in the eyes of peoples who were still enveloped in the  darkness of polytheism and idolatry. And perhaps we may find it more  difficult yet to realize the primitive object and intention of these  sacrifices. There can be no doubt that they were originally suggested by  the idea that the divine being, whatever it may have been--whether a  natural object, an animal, or a creature analogous to man--liked what we  like, was pleased with what pleases us, and had the same tastes and the  same proclivities as ours. This is the fundamental idea that urged the  polytheistic peoples along the path of religious anthropomorphism.    This principle once established, and the object being to secure the  goodwill and the protection of the divine beings, what could be more  natural than to offer them the things in which men themselves took  pleasure, such as viands, drinks, perfumes, handsome ornaments, slaves  and wives? We must not carry back to the origins of sacrifice the  meta-physical and moral ideas which did not really appear until much  later. And since the necessity of eating, and the pleasure of eating  choice food, take a foremost rank in the estimation of infant peoples,  it is not surprising that the food-offering was the most frequent and  the most important amongst them, so as in some sort to absorb all the  rest.    And here we are compelled to bow before a fact which cannot possibly be  disputed, namely, that traces of the primitive sacrifice of human  victims meet us everywhere. And this shows that cannibalism, which is  now restricted to a few of the savage tribes who have remained closest  to the animal life, was once universal to our race. For no one would  ever have conceived the idea of offering to the gods a kind of food  which excited nothing but disgust and horror amongst men.    This being granted, two rival tendencies must be reckoned with. In the  first place, moral development, with its influence on religious ideas,  worked towards the suppression of the horrible custom of human  sacrifice, whilst at the same time extirpating the taste and desire for  human flesh. For we must not forget that where cannibalism still reigns,  human flesh is regarded as the most delicious of foods; and the Greek  mythology has preserved legends and myths that are connected with the  very epoch at which human sacrifices first became an object of horror to  gods and men. But, in the second place, in virtue of the strange  persistency of rites and usages connected with religion, human  sacrifices prevailed in many places when cannibalism had completely  disappeared from the habits and tastes of the population. Thus the  Semites of Western Asia and the Civaite Hindus, the Celts, and some of  the populations of Greece and Italy, long after they had renounced  cannibalism, still continued to sacrifice human beings to their deities.    And this gives us the clue to a third phase, which was actually  realized in Mexico before the conquest. Cannibalism, in ordinary life,  was no longer practised. The city of Mexico underwent all the horrors of  famine during the siege conducted by Fernando Cortes. When the Spaniards  finally entered the city, they found the streets strewn with corpses,  which is a sufficient proof that human flesh was not eaten even in dire  extremities. And, nevertheless, the Aztecs not only pushed human  sacrifices to a frantic extreme, but they were _ritual cannibals_, that  is to say, there were certain occasions on which they ate the flesh of  the human victims whom they had immolated.    This practice was connected with another religious conception, grafted  upon the former one. Almost everywhere, but especially amongst the  Aztecs, we find the notion that the victim devoted to a deity, and  therefore destined to pass into his substance and to become by  assimilation an integral part of him, is already co-substantial with  him, has already become part of him; so that the worshipper in his turn,  by himself assimilating a part of the victim's flesh, unites himself in  substance with the divine being. And now observe that in all religions  the longing, whether grossly or spiritually apprehended, to enter into  the closest possible union with the adored being is fundamental. This  longing is inseparable from the religious sentiment itself, and becomes  imperious wherever that sentiment is warm; and this consideration is  enough to convince us that it is in harmony with the most exalted  tendencies of our nature, but may likewise, in times of ignorance, give  rise to the most deplorable aberrations.    Note this, again, that immolation or sacrifice cannot be accomplished  without suffering to the victim. Yet more: the immense importance of  sacrifice in the inferior religions raises the mere rite itself to a  position of unrivalled efficacy as gauged by the childlike notions that  have given it birth, so that at last it acquires an intrinsic and  magical virtue in the eyes of the sacrificers. They have lost all  distinct idea as to how their sacrifice gives pleasure to the gods, but  they retain the firm belief that as a matter of fact, it is the  appointed means of acting upon their dispositions and modifying their  will. The civilized Greeks and Romans no longer believed that their gods  ate the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34834"],[0,"A Text-Book of Astronomy (#10)"],[1," of the rider may turn the bicycle to the right or the  left, but unless some disturbing force is applied it will go straight  ahead, and if all resistance to its motion could be removed it would go  always at the speed given it by the last power applied, swerving neither  to the one hand nor the other.    When a slow rider increases his speed we recognize at once that he has  applied additional power to the wheel, and when this speed is slackened  it equally shows that force has been applied against the motion. It is  force alone which can produce a change in either velocity or direction  of motion; but simple as this law now appears it required the genius of  Galileo to discover it and of Newton to give it the form in which it is  stated above.    35. THE SECOND LAW OF MOTION, which is also due to Galileo and Newton,  is:    \"Change of motion is proportional to force applied and takes place in  the direction of the straight line in which the force acts.\" Suppose a  man to fall from a balloon at some great elevation in the air; his own  weight is the force which pulls him down, and that force operating at  every instant is sufficient to give him at the end of the first second  of his fall a downward velocity of 32 feet per second--i. e., it has  changed his state from rest, to motion at this rate, and the motion is  toward the earth because the force acts in that direction. During the  next second the ceaseless operation of this force will have the same  effect as in the first second and will add another 32 feet to his  velocity, so that two seconds from the time he commenced to fall he will  be moving at the rate of 64 feet per second, etc. The column of figures  marked _v_ in the table below shows what his velocity will be at the end  of subsequent seconds. The changing velocity here shown is the change of  motion to which the law refers, and the velocity is proportional to the  time shown in the first column of the table, because the amount of force  exerted in this case is proportional to the time during which it  operated. The distance through which the man will fall in each second is  shown in the column marked _d_, and is found by taking the average of  his velocity at the beginning and end of this second, and the total  distance through which he has fallen at the end of each second, marked  _s_ in the table, is found by taking the sum of all the preceding values  of _d_. The velocity, 32 feet per second, which measures the change of  motion in each second, also measures the _accelerating force_ which  produces this motion, and it is usually represented in formulæ by the  letter _g_. Let the student show from the numbers in the table that the  accelerating force, the time, _t_, during which it operates, and the  space, _s_, fallen through, satisfy the relation        s = 1/2 gt^{2},    which is usually called the law of falling bodies. How does the table  show that _g_ is equal to 32?                TABLE        _t_   _v_   _d_   _s_         0      0     0     0       1     32    16    16       2     64    48    64       3     96    80   144       4    128   112   256       5    160   144   400      etc.  etc.  etc.  etc.    If the balloon were half a mile high how long would it take to fall to  the ground? What would be the velocity just before reaching the ground?    [Illustration: GALILEO GALILEI (1564-1642).]    Fig. 19 shows the path through the air of a ball which has been struck  by a bat at the point _A_, and started off in the direction _A B_ with a  velocity of 200 feet per second. In accordance with the first law of  motion, if it were acted upon by no other force than the impulse given  by the bat, it should travel along the straight line _A B_ at the  uniform rate of 200 feet per second, and at the end of the fourth second  it should be 800 feet from _A_, at the point marked 4, but during these  four seconds its weight has caused it to fall 256 feet, and its actual  position, 4', is 256 feet below the point 4. In this way we find its  position at the end of each second, 1', 2', 3', 4', etc., and drawing a  line through these points we shall find the actual path of the ball  under the influence of the two forces to be the curved line _A C_. No  matter how far the ball may go before striking the ground, it can not  get back to the point _A_, and the curve _A C_ therefore can not be a  part of a circle, since that curve returns into itself. It is, in fact,  a part of a _parabola_, which, as we shall see later, is a kind of orbit  in which comets and some other heavenly bodies move. A skyrocket moves  in the same kind of a path, and so does a stone, a bullet, or any other  object hurled through the air.    [Illustration: FIG. 19.--The path of a ball.]    36. THE THIRD LAW OF MOTION.--\"To every action there is always an equal  and contrary reaction; or the mutual actions of any two bodies are  always equal and oppositely directed.\" This is well illustrated in the  case of a man climbing a rope hand over hand. The direct force or action  which he exerts is a downward pull upon the rope, and it is the reaction  of the rope to this pull which lifts him along it. We shall find in a  later chapter a curious application of this law to the history of the  earth and moon.    It is the great glory of Sir Isaac Newton that he first of all men  recognized that these simple laws of motion hold true in the heavens as  well as upon the earth; that the complicated motion of a planet, a  comet, or a star is determined in accordance with these laws by the  forces which act upon the bodies, and that these forces are essentially  the same as that which we call weight. The formal statement of the  principle last named is included in--    37. NEWTON'S LAW OF GRAVITATION.--\"Every particle of matter in the  universe attracts every other particle with a force whose direction is  that of a line joining the two, and whose magnitude is directly as the  product of their masses, and inversely as the square of their distance  from each other.\" We know that we ourselves and the things about us are  pulled toward the earth by a force (weight) which is called, in the  Latin that Newton wrote, _gravitas_, and the word marks well the true  significance of the law of gravitation. Newton did not discover a new  force in the heavens, but he extended an old and familiar one from a  limited terrestrial sphere of action to an unlimited and celestial one,  and furnished a precise statement of the way in which the force  operates. Whether a body be hot or cold, wet or dry, solid, liquid, or  gaseous, is of no account in determining the force which it exerts,  since this depends solely upon mass and distance.    The student should perhaps be warned against straining too far the  language which it is customary to employ in this connection. The law of  gravitation is certainly a far-reaching one, and it may operate in every  remotest corner of the universe precisely as stated above, but  additional information about those corners would be welcome to  supplement our rather scanty stock of knowledge concerning what happens  there. We may not controvert the words of a popular preacher who says,  \"When I lift my hand I move the stars in Ursa Major,\" but we should not  wish to stand sponsor for them, even though they are justified by a  rigorous interpretation of the Newtonian law.    The word _mass_, in the statement of the law of gravitation, means the  quantity of matter contained in the body, and if we represent by the  letters _m´_ and _m´´_ the respective quantities of matter contained in  the two bodies whose distance from each other is _r_, we shall have, in  accordance with the law of gravitation, the following mathematical  expression for the force, _F_, which acts between them:        F = k {m´m´´/r^{2}}.    This equation, which is the general mathematical expression for the law  of gravitation, may be made to yield some curious results. Thus, if we  select two bullets, each having a mass of 1 gram, and place them so that  their centers are 1 centimeter apart, the above expression for the force  exerted between them becomes        F = k {(1 × 1)/1^{2}} = k,    from which it appears that the coefficient _k_ is the force exerted  between these bodies. This is called the gravitation constant, and it  evidently furnishes a measure of the specific intensity with which one  particle of matter attracts another. Elaborate experiments which have  been made to determine the amount of this force show that it is  surprisingly small, for in the case of the two bullets whose mass of 1  gram each is supposed to be concentrated into an indefinitely small  space, gravity would have to operate between them continuously for more  than forty minutes in order to pull them together, although they were  separated by only 1 centimeter to start with, and nothing save their own  inertia opposed their movements. It is only when one or both of the  masses _m´_, _m´´_ are very great that the force of gravity becomes  large, and the weight of bodies at the surface of the earth is  considerable because of the great quantity of matter which goes to make  up the earth. Many of the heavenly bodies are much more massive than the  earth, as the mathematical astronomers have found by applying the law of  gravitation to determine numerically their masses, or, in more popular  language, to \"weigh\" them.    The student should observe that the two terms mass and weight are not  synonymous; mass is defined above as the quantity of matter contained in  a body, while weight is the force with which the earth attracts that  body, and in accordance with the law of gravitation its weight depends  upon its distance from the center of the earth, while its mass is quite  independent of its position with respect to the earth.    By the third law of motion the earth is pulled toward a falling body  just as strongly as the body is pulled toward the earth--i. e., by a  force equal to"]]]
