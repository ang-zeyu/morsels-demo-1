But the instructions of the Fish Commission were to the effect that  the patrolmen should avoid complications, and this one, did we call on  the higher powers, might well end in a pretty international tangle.    The second week of the siege drew to its close, and there was no sign  of change in the situation. On the morning of the fourteenth day the  change came, and it came in a guise as unexpected and startling to us  as it was to the men we were striving to capture.    Charley and I, after our customary night vigil by the side of the  _Lancashire Queen_, rowed into the Solano Wharf.    \"Hello!\" cried Charley, in surprise. \"In the name of reason and common  sense, what is that? Of all unmannerly craft did you ever see the  like?\"    Well might he exclaim, for there, tied up to the dock, lay the  strangest-looking launch I had ever seen. Not that it could be called  a launch, either, but it seemed to resemble a launch more than any  other kind of boat. It was seventy feet long, but so narrow was it,  and so bare of superstructure, that it appeared much smaller than it  really was. It was built wholly of steel, and was painted black. Three  smokestacks, a good distance apart and raking well aft, arose in  single file amidships; while the bow, long and lean and sharp as a  knife, plainly advertised that the boat was made for speed. Passing  under the stern, we read _Streak_, painted in small white letters.    Charley and I were consumed with curiosity. In a few minutes we were  on board and talking with an engineer who was watching the sunrise  from the deck. He was quite willing to satisfy our curiosity, and in a  few minutes we learned that the _Streak_ had come in after dark from  San Francisco; that this was what might be called the trial trip; and  that she was the property of Silas Tate, a young mining millionaire of  California, whose fad was high-speed yachts. There was some talk about  turbine engines, direct application of steam, and the absence of  pistons, rods, and cranks,--all of which was beyond me, for I was  familiar only with sailing craft; but I did understand the last words  of the engineer.    \"Four thousand horse-power and forty-five miles an hour, though you  wouldn't think it,\" he concluded proudly.    \"Say it again, man! Say it again!\" Charley exclaimed in an excited  voice.    \"Four thousand horse-power and forty-five miles an hour,\" the engineer  repeated, grinning good-naturedly.    \"Where's the owner?\" was Charley's next question. \"Is there any way I  can speak to him?\"    The engineer shook his head. \"No, I'm afraid not. He's asleep, you  see.\"    At that moment a young man in blue uniform came on deck farther aft  and stood regarding the sunrise.    \"There he is, that's him, that's Mr. Tate,\" said the engineer.    Charley walked aft and spoke to him, and while he talked earnestly the  young man listened with an amused expression on his face. He must have  inquired about the depth of water close in to the shore at Turner's  Shipyard, for I could see Charley making gestures and explaining. A  few minutes later he came back in high glee.    \"Come on, lad,\" he said. \"On to the dock with you. We've got them!\"    It was our good fortune to leave the _Streak_ when we did, for a  little later one of the spy fishermen appeared. Charley and I took up  our accustomed places, on the stringer-piece, a little ahead of the  _Streak_ and over our own boat, where we could comfortably watch the  _Lancashire Queen_. Nothing occurred till about nine o'clock, when we  saw the two Italians leave the ship and pull along their side of the  triangle toward the shore. Charley looked as unconcerned as could be,  but before they had covered a quarter of the distance, he whispered to  me:    \"Forty-five miles an hour...nothing can save them...they are ours!\"    Slowly the two men rowed along till they were nearly in line with the  windmill. This was the point where we always jumped into our salmon  boat and got up the sail, and the two men, evidently expecting it,  seemed surprised when we gave no sign.    When they were directly in line with the windmill, as near to the  shore as to the ship, and nearer the shore than we had ever allowed  them before, they grew suspicious. We followed them through the  glasses, and saw them standing up in the skiff and trying to find out  what we were doing. The spy fisherman, sitting beside us on the  stringerpiece, was likewise puzzled. He could not understand our  inactivity. The men in the skiff rowed nearer the shore, but stood up  again and scanned it, as if they thought we might be in hiding there.  But a man came out on the beach and waved a handkerchief to indicate  that the coast was clear. That settled them. They bent to the oars to  make a dash for it. Still Charley waited. Not until they had covered  three-quarters of the distance from the _Lancashire Queen_, which left  them hardly more than a quarter of a mile to gain the shore, did  Charley slap me on the shoulder and cry:    \"They're ours! They're ours!\"    We ran the few steps to the side of the _Streak_ and jumped aboard.  Stern and bow lines were cast off in a jiffy. The _Streak_ shot ahead  and away from the wharf. The spy fisherman we had left behind on the  stringer-piece pulled out a revolver and fired five shots into the air  in rapid succession. The men in the skiff gave instant heed to the  warning, for we could see them pulling away like mad.    But if they pulled like mad, I wonder how our progress can be  described? We fairly flew. So frightful was the speed with which we  displaced the water, that a wave rose up on either side our bow and  foamed aft in a series of three stiff, up-standing waves, while astern  a great crested billow pursued us hungrily, as though at each moment  it would fall aboard and destroy us. The _Streak_ was pulsing and  vibrating and roaring like a thing alive. The wind of our progress was  like a gale--a forty-five-mile gale. We could not face it and draw  breath without choking and strangling. It blew the smoke straight  back from the mouths of the smoke-stacks at a direct right angle to  the perpendicular. In fact, we were travelling as fast as an express  train. \"We just _streaked_ it,\" was the way Charley told it afterward,  and I think his description comes nearer than any I can give.    As for the Italians in the skiff--hardly had we started, it seemed to  me, when we were on top of them. Naturally, we had to slow down long  before we got to them; but even then we shot past like a whirlwind and  were compelled to circle back between them and the shore. They had  rowed steadily, rising from the thwarts at every stroke, up to the  moment we passed them, when they recognized Charley and me. That took  the last bit of fight out of them. They hauled in their oars and  sullenly submitted to arrest.    \"Well, Charley,\" Neil Partington said, as we discussed it on the wharf  afterward, \"I fail to see where your boasted imagination came into  play this time.\"    But Charley was true to his hobby. \"Imagination?\" he demanded,  pointing to the _Streak_. \"Look at that! Just look at it! If the  invention of that isn't imagination, I should like to know what is.\"    \"Of course,\" he added, \"it's the other fellow's imagination, but it  did the work all the same.\"          V    CHARLEY'S COUP      Perhaps our most laughable exploit on the fish patrol, and at the same  time our most dangerous one, was when we rounded in, at a single haul,  an even score of wrathful fishermen. Charley called it a \"coop,\"  having heard Neil Partington use the term; but I think he  misunderstood the word, and thought it meant \"coop,\" to catch, to  trap. The fishermen, however, coup or coop, must have called it a  Waterloo, for it was the severest stroke ever dealt them by the fish  patrol, while they had invited it by open and impudent defiance of the  law.    During what is called the \"open season\" the fishermen might catch as  many salmon as their luck allowed and their boats could hold. But  there was one important restriction. From sun-down Saturday night to  sun-up Monday morning, they were not permitted to set a net. This was  a wise provision on the part of the Fish Commission, for it was  necessary to give the spawning salmon some opportunity to ascend the  river and lay their eggs. And this law, with only an occasional  violation, had been obediently observed by the Greek fishermen who  caught salmon for the canneries and the market.    One Sunday morning, Charley received a telephone call from a friend in  Collinsville, who told him that the full force of fishermen was out  with its nets. Charley and I jumped into our salmon boat and started  for the scene of the trouble. With a light favoring wind at our back  we went through the Carquinez Straits, crossed Suisun Bay, passed the  Ship Island Light, and came upon the whole fleet at work.    But first let me describe the method by which they worked. The net  used is what is known as a gill-net. It has a simple diamond-shaped  mesh which measures at least seven and one-half inches between the  knots. From five to seven and even eight hundred feet in length, these  nets are only a few feet wide. They are not stationary, but float with  the current, the upper edge supported on the surface by floats, the  lower edge sunk by means of leaden weights.    This arrangement keeps the net upright in the current and effectually  prevents all but the smaller fish from ascending the river. The  salmon, swimming near the surface, as is their custom, run their heads  through these meshes, and are prevented from going on through by their  larger girth of body, and from going back because of their gills,  which catch in the mesh. It requires two fishermen to set such a  net,--one to row the boat, while the other, standing in the stern,  carefully pays out the net.

We have also seen that these two _Grey_ Counters, taken _separately_,  represent the two Propositions \"No xy exist\" and \"No xy' exist\".

[In the \"books\" example, this Proposition would be \"No old books      exist\".

This tells us that at least _one_ Thing, in the _North_ Half, is also in  the _West_ Half. Hence it must be in the space _common_ to them, that  is, in the _North-West Cell_. Hence the North-West Cell is _occupied_.  And this we can represent by placing a _Red_ Counter in it.        .-------.      |(.)|   |      |---|---|      |   |   |      .-------.
