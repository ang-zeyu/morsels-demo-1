When the ice with its burden of  material scraped from the hills of the north passed over the coastal  plain, it filled the hollows with rich new soil. The icy streams that  flowed out from the glaciers were full of fine sediment, which they  deposited over enormous flood plains. During dry seasons the winds  picked up this dust and spread it out still more widely, forming the  great banks of yellow loess whose fertile soil mantles the sides of many  a valley in the Mississippi basin. Thus glaciers, streams, and winds  laid down ten, twenty, fifty, or even one hundred feet of the finest,  most fertile soil. We have already seen how much the soil was improved  by glaciation in Wisconsin and Ohio. It was in the prairie States that  this improvement reached a maximum. The soil there is not only fine  grained and free from rocks, but it consists of particles brought from  widely different sources and is therefore full of all kinds of plant  foods. In most parts of the world a fine-grained soil is formed only  after a prolonged period of weathering which leaches out many valuable  chemical elements. In the prairies, however, the soil consists largely  of materials that were mechanically ground to dust by the ice without  being exposed to the action of weathering. Thus they have reached their  present resting-places without the loss of any of their original plant  foods. When such a soil is found with a climate which is good for crops  and which is also highly stimulating to man, the combination is almost  ideal. There is some justification for those who say that the north  central portion of the United States is more fortunate than any other  part of the earth. Nowhere else, unless in western Europe, is there such  a combination of fertile soil, fine climate, easy communication, and  possibilities for manufacturing and commerce. Iron from that outlier of  the Laurentian highland which forms the peninsula of northern Michigan  can easily be brought by water almost to the center of the prairie  region. Coal in vast quantities lies directly under the surface of this  region, for the rock of the ancient coastal plain belongs to the same  Pennsylvanian series which yields most of the world's coal. Here man is,  indeed, blessed with resources and opportunities scarcely equaled in any  other part of the world, and finds the only drawbacks to be the extremes  of temperature in both winter and summer and the remoteness of the  region from the sea. Because of the richness of their heritage and  because they live safely protected from threats of foreign aggression,  the people who live in this part of the world are in danger of being  slow to feel the currents of great world movements.    The western half of the plains of North America consists of two parts  unlike either the Atlantic coastal plain or the prairies. From South  Dakota and Nebraska northward far into Canada and westward to the Rocky  Mountains there extends an ancient peneplain worn down to gentle relief  by the erosion of millions of years. It is not so level as the plains  farther east nor so low. Its western margin reaches heights of four or  five thousand feet. Here and there, especially on the western side, it  rises to the crest of a rugged escarpment where some resistant layer of  rocks still holds itself up against the forces of erosion. Elsewhere its  smooth surfaces are broken by lava-capped mesas or by ridges where some  ancient volcanic dike is so hard that it has not yet been worn away.  The soil, though excellent, is thinner and less fertile than in the  prairies. Nevertheless the population might in time become as dense and  prosperous as almost any in the world if only the rainfall were more  abundant and good supplies of coal were not quite so far away. Yet in  spite of these handicaps the northwestern peneplain with its vast  open stretches, its cattle, its wheat, and its opportunities is a most  attractive land.    South of Nebraska and Wyoming the \"high plains,\" the last of the four  great divisions of the plains, extend as far as western Texas. These,  like the prairies, have been built up by deposits brought from other  regions. In this case, however, the deposits consist of gravel, sand,  and silt which the rivers have gradually washed out from the Rocky  Mountains. As the rivers have changed their courses from one bed to  another, layer after layer has been laid down to form a vast plain  like a gently sloping beach hundreds of miles wide. In most places the  streams are no longer building this up. Frequently they have carved  narrow valleys hundreds of feet deep in the materials which they  formerly deposited. Elsewhere, however, as in western Kansas, most of  the country is so flat that the horizon is like that of the ocean. It  seems almost incredible that at heights of four or five thousand feet  the plains can still be so wonderfully level. When the grass is green,  when the spring flowers are at their best, it would be hard to find a  picture of greater beauty. Here the buffalo wandered in the days before  the white man destroyed them. Here today is the great cattle region of  America. Here is the region where the soul of man is filled with the  feeling of infinite space.    To the student of land forms there is an ever-present contrast between  those due directly to the processes which build up the earth's surface  and those due to the erosive forces which destroy what the others have  built. In the great plains of North America two of the divisions, that  is, the Atlantic coastal plain of the southeast and the peneplain of the  northwest, owe their present form to the forces of erosion. The other  two, that is, the prairies and the high plains, still bear the impress  of the original processes of deposition and have been modified to only a  slight extent by erosion.    A similar but greater contrast separates the mountains of eastern North  America and those of the western cordillera--the fourth and last of the  main physical divisions of the continent. In both the Laurentian and  the Appalachian highlands the eastern mountains show no trace of the  original forms produced by the faulting of the crust or by volcanic  movements. All the original distinctive topography has been removed.  What we see today is the product of erosion working upon rocks that were  thousands of feet beneath the surface when they were brought to their  present positions. In the western cordillera, on the contrary, although  much of the present form of the land is due to erosion, a vast amount is  due directly to so-called \"tectonic\" activities such as the breaking of  the crust, the pouring out of molten lavas, and the bursting forth of  explosive eruptions.    The character of these tectonic activities has differed widely in  different parts of the cordillera. A broad upheaval of great blocks  of the earth's crust without tilting or disturbance has produced the  plateaus of Arizona and Utah. The gorges that have been rapidly cut  into such great upheaved blocks form part of the world's most striking  scenery. The Grand Canyon of the Colorado with its tremendous platforms,  mesas, and awe-inspiring cliffs could have been formed in no other way.  Equally wonderful are some of the narrow canyons in the broadly upheaved  plateaus of southern Utah where the tributaries of the Virgin and other  rivers have cut red or white chasms thousands of feet deep and so narrow  that at their bottoms perpetual twilight reigns. It is a curious proof  of the fallibility of human judgment that these great gorges are often  cited as the most striking examples of the power of erosion. Wonderful  as these gorges certainly are, the Piedmont plain or the northwestern  peneplain is far more wonderful. Those regions had their grand canyons  once upon a time, but now erosion has gone so far that it has reduced  the whole area to the level of the bottoms of the gorges. Though such  a fate is in store for all the marvelous scenery of the western  cordillera, we have it, for the present at least, as one of the most  stimulating panoramas of our American environment. No man worthy of the  name can sit on the brink of a great canyon or gaze up from the dark  depths of a gorge without a sense of awe and wonder. There, as in few  other places, Nature shows with unmistakable grandeur the marvelous  power and certainty with which her laws work out the destiny of the  universe.    In other parts of the great American cordillera some of the simplest and  youngest mountain ridges in the world are found. In southern Oregon, for  example, lava blocks have been broken and uplifted and now stand with  steep fresh faces on one side and with the old surface inclining more  gently on the other. Tilted blocks on a larger scale and much more  deeply carved by erosion are found in the lofty St. Elias Mountain of  Alaska, where much of the erosion has been done by some of the world's  greatest glaciers. The western slope of the Wasatch Mountains facing the  desert of Utah is the wall of a huge fracture, as is the eastern face  of the Sierra Nevadas facing the deserts of Nevada. Each of these great  faces has been deeply eroded. At the base, however, recent breaking and  upheaval of the crust have given rise to fresh uneroded slopes. Some  take the form of triangular facets, where a series of ridges has been  sliced across and lifted up by a great fault. Others assume the shape  of terraces which sometimes continue along the base of the mountains for  scores of miles. In places they seem like bluffs cut by an ancient lake,  but suddenly they change their altitude or pass from one drainage area  to another as no lake-formed strand could possibly do.    In other parts of the cordillera, mountains have been formed by a single  arching of the crust without any breaking."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3069"],[0,"The Great Boer War (#10)"],[1,"mediation of the heads of the Afrikander Bond, the political  union of the Dutch Cape colonists. On the one hand, they were the  kinsmen of the Boers; on the other, they were British subjects, and  were enjoying the blessings of those liberal institutions which we were  anxious to see extended to the Transvaal. 'Only treat our folk as we  treat yours! Our whole contention was compressed into that prayer. But  nothing came of the mission, though a scheme endorsed by Mr. Hofmeyer  and Mr. Herholdt, of the Bond, with Mr. Fischer of the Free State, was  introduced into the Raad and applauded by Mr. Schreiner, the Africander  Premier of Cape Colony. In its original form the provisions were obscure  and complicated, the franchise varying from nine years to seven under  different conditions. In debate, however, the terms were amended until  the time was reduced to seven years, and the proposed representation of  the gold fields placed at five. The concession was not a great one,  nor could the representation, five out of thirty-one, be considered a  generous provision for the majority of the population; but the reduction  of the years of residence was eagerly hailed in England as a sign that a  compromise might be effected. A sigh of relief went up from the country.  'If,' said the Colonial Secretary, 'this report is confirmed, this  important change in the proposals of President Kruger, coupled with  previous amendments, leads Government to hope that the new law may prove  to be the basis of a settlement on the lines laid down by Sir Alfred  Milner in the Bloemfontein Conference.' He added that there were some  vexatious conditions attached, but concluded, 'Her Majesty's Government  feel assured that the President, having accepted the principle for which  they have contended, will be prepared to reconsider any detail of  his scheme which can be shown to be a possible hindrance to the full  accomplishment of the object in view, and that he will not allow them  to be nullified or reduced in value by any subsequent alterations of the  law or acts of administration.' At the same time, the 'Times' declared  the crisis to be at an end. 'If the Dutch statesmen of the Cape have  induced their brethren in the Transvaal to carry such a Bill, they will  have deserved the lasting gratitude, not only of their own countrymen  and of the English colonists in South Africa, but of the British Empire  and of the civilised world.'    But this fair prospect was soon destined to be overcast. Questions of  detail arose which, when closely examined, proved to be matters of very  essential importance. The Uitlanders and British South Africans, who had  experienced in the past how illusory the promises of the President might  be, insisted upon guarantees. The seven years offered were two years  more than that which Sir Alfred Milner had declared to be an irreducible  minimum. The difference of two years would not have hindered  their acceptance, even at the expense of some humiliation to our  representative. But there were conditions which excited distrust when  drawn up by so wily a diplomatist. One was that the alien who aspired to  burghership had to produce a certificate of continuous registration for  a certain time. But the law of registration had fallen into disuse in  the Transvaal, and consequently this provision might render the whole  Bill valueless. Since it was carefully retained, it was certainly meant  for use. The door had been opened, but a stone was placed to block it.  Again, the continued burghership of the newcomers was made to depend  upon the resolution of the first Raad, so that should the mining members  propose any measure of reform, not only their Bill but they also might  be swept out of the house by a Boer majority. What could an Opposition  do if a vote of the Government might at any moment unseat them all? It  was clear that a measure which contained such provisions must be very  carefully sifted before a British Government could accept it as a final  settlement and a complete concession of justice to its subjects. On the  other hand, it naturally felt loth to refuse those clauses which offered  some prospect of an amelioration in their condition. It took the course,  therefore, of suggesting that each Government should appoint delegates  to form a joint commission which should inquire into the working of  the proposed Bill before it was put into a final form. The proposal was  submitted to the Raad upon August 7th, with the addition that when  this was done Sir Alfred Milner was prepared to discuss anything else,  including arbitration without the interference of foreign powers.    The suggestion of this joint commission has been criticised as an  unwarrantable intrusion into the internal affairs of another country.  But then the whole question from the beginning was about the internal  affairs of another country, since the internal equality of the white  inhabitants was the condition upon which self-government was restored  to the Transvaal. It is futile to suggest analogies, and to imagine what  France would do if Germany were to interfere in a question of French  franchise. Supposing that France contained as many Germans as Frenchmen,  and that they were ill-treated, Germany would interfere quickly enough  and continue to do so until some fair modus vivendi was established.  The fact is that the case of the Transvaal stands alone, that such a  condition of things has never been known, and that no previous precedent  can apply to it, save the general rule that a minority of white men  cannot continue indefinitely to tax and govern a majority. Sentiment  inclines to the smaller nation, but reason and justice are all on the  side of England.    A long delay followed upon the proposal of the Secretary of the  Colonies. No reply was forthcoming from Pretoria. But on all sides there  came evidence that those preparations for war which had been quietly  going on even before the Jameson raid were now being hurriedly  perfected. For so small a State enormous sums were being spent upon  military equipment. Cases of rifles and boxes of cartridges streamed  into the arsenal, not only from Delagoa Bay, but even, to the  indignation of the English colonists, through Cape Town and Port  Elizabeth. Huge packing-cases, marked 'Agricultural Instruments' and  'Mining Machinery,' arrived from Germany and France, to find their  places in the forts of Johannesburg or Pretoria. Men of many nations  but of a similar type showed their martial faces in the Boer towns.  The condottieri of Europe were as ready as ever to sell their blood for  gold, and nobly in the end did they fulfill their share of the bargain.  For three weeks and more during which Mr. Kruger was silent these  eloquent preparations went on. But beyond them, and of infinitely more  importance, there was one fact which dominated the situation. A burgher  cannot go to war without his horse, his horse cannot move without grass,  grass will not come until after rain, and it was still some weeks before  the rain would be due. Negotiations, then, must not be unduly hurried  while the veld was a bare russet-coloured dust-swept plain. Mr.  Chamberlain and the British public waited week after week for their  answer. But there was a limit to their patience, and it was reached on  August 26th, when the Colonial Secretary showed, with a plainness of  speech which is as unusual as it is welcome in diplomacy, that the  question could not be hung up for ever. 'The sands are running down  in the glass,' said he. 'If they run out, we shall not hold ourselves  limited by that which we have already offered, but, having taken the  matter in hand, we will not let it go until we have secured conditions  which once for all shall establish which is the paramount power in  South Africa, and shall secure for our fellow-subjects there those equal  rights and equal privileges which were promised them by President Kruger  when the independence of the Transvaal was granted by the Queen, and  which is the least that in justice ought to be accorded them.' Lord  Salisbury, a little time before, had been equally emphatic. 'No one  in this country wishes to disturb the conventions so long as it is  recognised that while they guarantee the independence of the Transvaal  on the one side, they guarantee equal political and civil rights for  settlers of all nationalities upon the other. But these conventions are  not like the laws of the Medes and the Persians. They are mortal, they  can be destroyed...and once destroyed they can never be reconstructed  in the same shape.' The long-enduring patience of Great Britain was  beginning to show signs of giving way.    In the meantime a fresh dispatch had arrived from the Transvaal which  offered as an alternative proposal to the joint commission that the Boer  Government should grant the franchise proposals of Sir Alfred Milner  on condition that Great Britain withdrew or dropped her claim to a  suzerainty, agreed to arbitration, and promised never again to interfere  in the internal affairs of the republic. To this Great Britain answered  that she would agree to arbitration, that she hoped never again to have  occasion to interfere for the protection of her own subjects, but that  with the grant of the franchise all occasion for such interference would  pass away, and, finally, that she would never consent to abandon  her position as suzerain power. Mr. Chamberlain's dispatch ended by  reminding the Government of the Transvaal that there were other matters  of dispute open between the two Governments apart from the franchise,  and that it would be as well to have them settled at the same time. By  these he meant such questions as the position of the native races and  the treatment of Anglo-Indians.    On September 2nd the answer of the Transvaal Government was returned.  It was short and uncompromising. They withdrew their offer of the  franchise. They"]]]
