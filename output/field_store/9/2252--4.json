And then--I suppose it was  all my fancy--the air seemed to smell sweet, like the incense in  Catholic churches, and my breath came queer and catchy, as it does when  one gets very excited about anything. I felt altogether stranger than  I've ever felt before or since.'    Darnell stopped suddenly and looked up at his wife. She was watching him  with parted lips, with eager, wondering eyes.    'I hope I'm not tiring you, dear, with all this story about nothing. You  have had a worrying day with that stupid girl; hadn't you better go to  bed?'    'Oh, no, please, Edward. I'm not a bit tired now. I love to hear you  talk like that. Please go on.'    'Well, after I had walked a bit further, that queer sort of feeling  seemed to fade away. I said a bit further, and I really thought I had  been walking about five minutes, but I had looked at my watch just  before I got into that little street, and when I looked at it again it  was eleven o'clock. I must have done about eight miles. I could scarcely  believe my own eyes, and I thought my watch must have gone mad; but I  found out afterwards it was perfectly right. I couldn't make it out, and  I can't now; I assure you the time passed as if I walked up one side of  Edna Road and down the other. But there I was, right in the open  country, with a cool wind blowing on me from a wood, and the air full of  soft rustling sounds, and notes of birds from the bushes, and the  singing noise of a little brook that ran under the road. I was standing  on the bridge when I took out my watch and struck a wax light to see the  time; and it came upon me suddenly what a strange evening it had been.  It was all so different, you see, to what I had been doing all my life,  particularly for the year before, and it almost seemed as if I couldn't  be the man who had been going into the City every day in the morning and  coming back from it every evening after writing a lot of uninteresting  letters. It was like being pitched all of a sudden from one world into  another. Well, I found my way back somehow or other, and as I went along  I made up my mind how I'd spend my holiday. I said to myself, \"I'll have  a walking tour as well as Ferrars, only mine is to be a tour of London  and its environs,\" and I had got it all settled when I let myself into  the house about four o'clock in the morning, and the sun was shining,  and the street almost as still as the wood at midnight!'    'I think that was a capital idea of yours. Did you have your tour? Did  you buy a map of London?'    'I had the tour all right. I didn't buy a map; that would have spoilt  it, somehow; to see everything plotted out, and named, and measured.  What I wanted was to feel that I was going where nobody had been before.  That's nonsense, isn't it? as if there could be any such places in  London, or England either, for the matter of that.'    'I know what you mean; you wanted to feel as if you were going on a sort  of voyage of discovery. Isn't that it?'    'Exactly, that's what I was trying to tell you. Besides, I didn't want  to buy a map. I made a map.'    'How do you mean? Did you make a map out of your head?'    'I'll tell you about it afterwards. But do you really want to hear about  my grand tour?'    'Of course I do; it must have been delightful. I call it a most original  idea.'    'Well, I was quite full of it, and what you said just now about a voyage  of discovery reminds me of how I felt then. When I was a boy I was  awfully fond of reading of great travellers--I suppose all boys are--and  of sailors who were driven out of their course and found themselves in  latitudes where no ship had ever sailed before, and of people who  discovered wonderful cities in strange countries; and all the second day  of my holidays I was feeling just as I used to when I read these books.  I didn't get up till pretty late. I was tired to death after all those  miles I had walked; but when I had finished my breakfast and filled my  pipe, I had a grand time of it. It was such nonsense, you know; as if  there could be anything strange or wonderful in London.'    'Why shouldn't there be?'    'Well, I don't know; but I have thought afterwards what a silly lad I  must have been. Anyhow, I had a great day of it, planning what I would  do, half making-believe--just like a kid--that I didn't know where I  might find myself, or what might happen to me. And I was enormously  pleased to think it was all my secret, that nobody else knew anything  about it, and that, whatever I might see, I would keep to myself. I had  always felt like that about the books. Of course, I loved reading them,  but it seemed to me that, if I had been a discoverer, I would have kept  my discoveries a secret. If I had been Columbus, and, if it could  possibly have been managed, I would have found America all by myself,  and never have said a word about it to anybody. Fancy! how beautiful it  would be to be walking about in one's own town, and talking to people,  and all the while to have the thought that one knew of a great world  beyond the seas, that nobody else dreamed of. I should have loved that!    'And that is exactly what I felt about the tour I was going to make. I  made up my mind that nobody should know; and so, from that day to this,  nobody has heard a word of it.'    'But you are going to tell me?'    'You are different. But I don't think even you will hear everything; not  because I won't, but because I can't tell many of the things I saw.'    'Things you saw? Then you really did see wonderful, strange things in  London?'    'Well, I did and I didn't. Everything, or pretty nearly everything, that  I saw is standing still, and hundreds of thousands of people have looked  at the same sights--there were many places that the fellows in the  office knew quite well, I found out afterwards. And then I read a book  called \"London and its Surroundings.\" But (I don't know how it is)  neither the men at the office nor the writers of the book seem to have  seen the things that I did. That's why I stopped reading the book; it  seemed to take the life, the real heart, out of everything, making it as  dry and stupid as the stuffed birds in a museum.    'I thought about what I was going to do all that day, and went to bed  early, so as to be fresh. I knew wonderfully little about London,  really; though, except for an odd week now and then, I had spent all my  life in town. Of course I knew the main streets--the Strand, Regent  Street, Oxford Street, and so on--and I knew the way to the school I  used to go to when I was a boy, and the way into the City. But I had  just kept to a few tracks, as they say the sheep do on the mountains;  and that made it all the easier for me to imagine that I was going to  discover a new world.'    Darnell paused in the stream of his talk. He looked keenly at his wife  to see if he were wearying her, but her eyes gazed at him with unabated  interest--one would have almost said that they were the eyes of one who  longed and half expected to be initiated into the mysteries, who knew  not what great wonder was to be revealed. She sat with her back to the  open window, framed in the sweet dusk of the night, as if a painter had  made a curtain of heavy velvet behind her; and the work that she had  been doing had fallen to the floor. She supported her head with her two  hands placed on each side of her brow, and her eyes were as the wells in  the wood of which Darnell dreamed in the night-time and in the day.    'And all the strange tales I had ever heard were in my head that  morning,' he went on, as if continuing the thoughts that had filled his  mind while his lips were silent. 'I had gone to bed early, as I told  you, to get a thorough rest, and I had set my alarum clock to wake me  at three, so that I might set out at an hour that was quite strange for  the beginning of a journey. There was a hush in the world when I awoke,  before the clock had rung to arouse me, and then a bird began to sing  and twitter in the elm tree that grew in the next garden, and I looked  out of the window, and everything was still, and the morning air  breathed in pure and sweet, as I had never known it before. My room was  at the back of the house, and most of the gardens had trees in them, and  beyond these trees I could see the backs of the houses of the next  street rising like the wall of an old city; and as I looked the sun  rose, and the great light came in at my window, and the day began.    'And I found that when I was once out of the streets just about me that  I knew, some of the queer feeling that had come to me two days before  came back again. It was not nearly so strong, the streets no longer  smelt of incense, but still there was enough of it to show me what a  strange world I passed by. There were things that one may see again and  again in many London streets: a vine or a fig tree on a wall, a lark  singing in a cage, a curious shrub blossoming in a garden, an odd shape  of a roof, or a balcony with an uncommon-looking trellis-work in iron.  There's scarcely a street, perhaps, where you won't see one or other of  such things as these; but that morning they rose to my eyes in a new  light, as if I had on the magic spectacles in the fairy tale, and just  like the man in the fairy tale, I went on and on in the new light. I  remember going through wild land on a high place; there were pools of  water shining in the sun, and great white houses in the middle of dark,  rocking pines, and then on the turn of the height I came to a little  lane that went aside from the main road, a lane that led to a wood, and  in the lane was a little old shadowed house, with a bell turret in the  roof, and a porch of trellis-work all dim and faded into the colour of  the sea; and in the garden there were growing tall, white lilies, just  as we saw them that day we went to look "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2503"],[0,"Myths and Legends of California and the Old Southwest (#10)"],[1,"by night, until it  lifted them up beyond the sight of their tribe, who looked for them  everywhere.    The rock grew until the boys were lifted high into the heaven, even far  up above the blue sky, until they scraped their faces against the moon.  And still, year after year, among the clouds they slept.    Then there was held a great council of all the animals to bring the boys  down from the top of the great rock. Every animal leaped as high as he  could up the face of the rocky wall. Mouse could only jump as high as  one's hand; Rat, twice as high. Then Raccoon tried; he could jump a  little farther. One after another of the animals tried, and Grizzly Bear  made a great leap far up the wall, but fell back. Last of all Lion  tried, and he jumped farther than any other animal, but fell down upon  his back. Then came tiny Measuring-Worm, and began to creep up the rock.  Soon he reached as high as Raccoon had jumped, then as high as Bear,  then as high as Lion's leap, and by and by he was out of sight, climbing  up the face of the rock. For one whole snow, Measuring-Worm climbed the  rock, and at last he reached the top. Then he wakened the boys, and came  down the same way he went up, and brought them down safely to the  ground. Therefore the rock is called Tutokanula, the measuring worm. But  white men call it El Capitan.          Legend of Tis-Se'-Yak (South Dome and North Dome)  Yosemite Valley    Tisseyak and her husband journeyed from a country very far off, and  entered the valley of the Yosemite foot-sore from travel. She bore a  great heavy conical basket, strapped across her head. Tisseyak came  first. Her husband followed with a rude staff and a light roll of skins  on his back. They were thirsty after their long journey across the  mountains. They hurried forward to drink of the waters, and the woman  was still in advance when she reached Lake Awaia. Then she dipped up the  water in her basket and drank of it. She drank up all the water. The  lake was dry before her husband reached it. And because the woman drank  all the water, there came a drought. The earth dried tip. There was no  grass, nor any green thing.    But the man was angry because he had no water to drink. He beat the  woman with his staff and she fled, but he followed and beat her even  more. Then the woman wept. In her anger she turned and flung her basket  at the man. And even then they were changed into stone. The woman's  basket lies upturned beside the man. The woman's face is tear-stained,  with long dark lines trailing down.    South Dome is the woman and North Dome is the husband. The Indian woman  cuts her hair straight across the forehead, and allows the sides to drop  along her cheeks, forming a square face.          Historic Tradition of the Upper Tuolumne  Yosemite Valley    (As given by Mr. Stephen Powers, 1877.)(4)    There is a lake-like expansion of the Upper Tuolumne some four miles  long and from a half mile to a mile wide, directly north of Hatchatchie  Valley (erroneously spelled Hetch Hetchy). It appears to have no name  among Americans, but the Indians call it O-wai-a-nuh, which is  manifestly a dialectic variation of a-wai'-a, the generic word for  \"lake.\" Nat. Screech, a veteran mountaineer and hunter, states that he  visited this region in 1850, and at that time there was a valley along  the river having the same dimensions that this lake now has. Again, in  1855, he happened to pass that way and discovered that the lake had been  formed as it now exists. He was at a loss to account for its origin; but  subsequently he acquired the Miwok language as spoken at Little Gap, and  while listening to the Indians one day he overheard them casually refer  to the formation of this lake in an extraordinary manner. On being  questioned they stated that there had been a tremendous cataclysm in  that valley, the bottom of it having fallen out apparently, whereby  the entire valley was submerged in the waters of the river. As nearly  as he could ascertain from their imperfect methods of reckoning time,  this occurred in 1851; and in that year, while in the town of Sonora,  Screech and many others remembered to have heard a huge explosion in  that direction which they then supposed was caused by a local earthquake.    On Drew's Ranch, Middle Fork of the Tuolumne, lives an aged squaw called  Dish-i, who was in the valley when this remarkable event occurred.  According to her account the earth dropped in beneath their feet, and  waters of the river leaped up and came rushing upon them in a vast,  roaring flood, almost perpendicular like a wall of rock. At first the  Indians were stricken dumb, and motionless with terror, but when they  saw the waters coming, they escaped for life, though thirty or forty  were overtaken and drowned. Another squaw named Isabel says that the  stubs of trees, which are still plainly visible deep down in the  pellucid waters, are considered by the old superstitious Indians to be  evil spirits, the demons of the place, reaching up their arms, and that  they fear them greatly.    (4) (Vol. 3, Part 2, U. S. Geographical and Geological Survey of the  Rocky Mountain region: Contributions to North American Ethnology, 1877.)          California Big Trees  Pai Utes (near Kern River, Cal.)    The California big trees are sacred to the Monos, who call them  \"woh-woh-nau,\" a word formed in imitation of the hoot of the owl. The  owl is the guardian spirit and the god of the big trees. Bad luck comes  to those who cut down the big trees, or shoot at an owl, or shoot in the  presence of the owl.    In old days the Indians tried to persuade the white men not to cut down  the big trees. When they see the trees cut down they call after the  white men. They say the owl will bring them evil.          The Children of Cloud  Pima (Arizona)    When the Hohokam dwelt on the Gila River and tilled their farms around  the great temple which we call Casa Grande, there was a beautiful young  woman in the pueblo who had two twin sons. Their father was Cloud, and  he lived far away.    One day the boys came to their mother, as she was weaving mats. \"Who is.  our father?\" they asked. \"We have no one to run to when he returns from  the hunt, or from war, to shout to him.\"    The mother answered: \"In the morning, look toward the sunrise and you  will see a white Cloud standing upright. He is your father.\"    \"Can we visit our father?\" they asked.    \"Yes,\" said their mother. \"You may visit him, but you must make the  journey without stopping. First you will reach Wind, who is your  father's eldest brother. Behind him you will find your father.\"    The boys travelled four days and came to the house of Wind.    \"Are you our father?\" they asked.    \"No, I am your Uncle,\" answered Wind.\" Your father lives in the next  house. Go on to him.\"    They travelled on to Cloud. But Cloud drove them away. He said, \"Go to  your uncle Wind. He will tell you something.\" But Wind sent them back to  Cloud again. Thus the boys were driven away from each house four times.    Then Cloud said to them, \"Prove to me you are my sons. If you are, you  can do what I do.\"    The younger boy sent chain lightning across the sky with sharp,  crackling thunder. The elder boy sent the heat lightning with its  distant rumble of thunder.    \"You are my children,\" said Cloud. \"You have power like mine.\"    But again he tested them. He took them to a house near by where a flood  of rain had drowned the people. \"If I they are my sons,\" he said, \"they  will not be harmed.\"    Then Cloud sent the rain and the storm. The water rose higher and  higher, but the two boys were not harmed. The water could not drown  them. Then Cloud took them to his home and there they stayed a long,  long time.    But after a long time, the boys wished to see their mother again. Then  Cloud made them some bows and arrows differing from any they had ever  seen, and sent them to their mother. He told them he would watch over  them as they travelled but they must speak to no one they met on their  way.    So the boys travelled to the setting sun. First they met Raven. They  remembered their father's command and turned aside so as not to meet  him. Then they met Roadrunner, and turned aside to avoid him. Next came  Hawk and Eagle.    Eagle said, \"Let's scare those boys.\" So he swooped down over their  heads until they cried from fright.    \"We were just teasing you,\" said Eagle. \"We will not do you any harm.\"  Then Eagle flew on.    Next they met Coyote. They tried to avoid him, but Coyote ran around and  put himself in their way. Cloud was watching and he sent down thunder  and lightning. And the boys sent out their magic thunder and lightning  also, until Coyote was frightened and ran away.    Now this happened on the mountain top, and one boy was standing on each  side of the trail. After Coyote ran away, they were changed into mescal  --the very largest mescal ever known. The place was near Tucson. This is  the reason why mescal grows on the mountains, and why thunder and  lightning go from place to place--because the children did. That is why  it rains when we gather mescal.          The Cloud People  Sia (New Mexico)    Now all the Cloud People, the Lightning People, the Thunder and Rainbow  Peoples followed the Sia into the upper world. But all the people of  Tinia, the middle world, did not leave the lower world. Only a portion  were sent by the Spider to work for the people of the upper world. The  Cloud People are so many that, although the demands of the earth people  are so great, there are always many passing about over Tinia for  pleasure. These Cloud People ride on wheels, small wheels being used by  the little Cloud children and large wheels by the older ones. (5)    The Cloud People keep always behind their masks. The shape of the mask  depends upon the number of the people and the work being done. The  Henati are the floating white clouds behind which the Cloud People"]]]
