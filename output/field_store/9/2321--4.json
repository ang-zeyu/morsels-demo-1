I say, nearly all; because it  is a sad truth that there are some persons who have no ear whatever  for music, and to whom the harsh, rattling noise of the cart on the  stony street affords just as much melody as do the sweetest tones that  may issue from a musical instrument. Again: there are those, who,  although possessing to some extent a faculty for musical discernment,  are yet so much governed by what is called a sense of the \"practical\"  in life as to avoid all opportunity for the enjoyment of melody,  considering such indulgence as a waste of precious time. It is,  however, pleasant to know that the number of all such persons--who  must, I think, be regarded as really unfortunate--is but a small one,  and that almost every one has a born capacity for musical appreciation  and enjoyment.    It is true that the mighty genius of Mozart and Beethoven soared far  above common musical minds. With a love for the noble art of music  almost sacred in its intensity, these great composers penetrated far,  far into its depths, finding their greatest enjoyment in so doing.  Starting with the simpler forms of the art left by their predecessors,  they deepened, they broadened and varied those forms; while, with  every intricacy created, they experienced the sweetest of pleasure.  And one of the most fitting tributes that can be paid to these and  others of the noble masters of harmony is beautifully embodied in the  lines of Rogers:--         \"The _soul_ of music slumbers in the shell       Till waked and kindled by the master's spell.\"    But this far-reaching art, with all its difficult forms to awaken and  enchain the interest, and to inspire the love of the man of genius or  the ambitious student of aesthetics, has also those more simple ones  for the delight of the humbler mind. Even the babe that lies in its  mother's arms has within the yet narrow confines of its new-born soul  the germ of musical sympathy. Often, when it is in a state of  disquiet, its mother sings to it a simple, pretty song. Soon the  crying ceases; the little eyes brighten with a delighted interest; the  charm of music is working. The mother continues the touching  \"lullaby,\" and anon finds that her tender charge, with the pleasing  sounds of melody gently ringing in its ears to the last, has been  soothed into dreamland. Indeed, the power of music to touch the heart,  to fill the soul, lies oftenest in those tones that are comprised in  its least difficult melodies. Nothing is truer than that music, so  beneficent in its influence, is _meant_ for the comprehension,  enjoyment, and improvement of _all_; and that it should never be  regarded as an all-mysterious art, the charming domain of which only  the gifted few are to enter. Whoever can distinguish musical sounds  from their reverse, is, in degree at least, a musician; and whether  such a one may enlarge his faculty for musical discernment and  enjoyment depends only upon the extent of his observations, or rather  upon the amount and kind of his study.    As elsewhere remarked, some time has elapsed since the music-loving  world has been called to the contemplation of any great, new  revelation in harmony. Meanwhile devotees of the divine art have  generally been so much employed in endeavors to properly interpret the  sublime works left for their study and enjoyment by the great  composers of the past, that they have had neither time nor desire to  seek for newer creations. For nearly all seem convinced that what is  most needed now is, not new music, but that the masses of the people  should possess an intelligent appreciation of, and warm love for, the  best of that which is already at hand; and as an intelligent,  heartfelt religious faith is needed to carry light and happiness alike  into the homes of the highly-favored and the lowly, so is the  beauty-shedding art of music--a close ally of that faith--needed to  cheer, to soothe their hearts, and to develop in the minds of all  God's children a love for that which may be fitly called the \"true,  beautiful, and good.\" Associating music with the very highest form of  happiness, one of the older poets imagines this beautiful scene in  heaven:--               \"Their golden harps they took,       Harps ever tuned, that glittering by their side       Like quivers hung, and with preamble sweet       Of charming symphony they introduce       Their sacred song, and waken raptures high       No voice exempt, no voice but well could join       Melodious part, such concord is in heaven.\"    But I shall now more particularly invite the reader to a consideration  of a few among the many forms in which the beauty, the power, and  good uses of music are exemplified, and of the advantages to be  derived from its conscientious study.    It may be noticed, that, in those towns and cities containing a  preponderance of cultivated people, theatres do not flourish to the  same extent as in neighborhoods where the reverse is true. The reason  is obvious: cultured people have attractive and generally musical  homes, and are thus made, to a great extent, independent of the  amusements afforded in public places. This I mention, not to decry the  theatre, which, I hold, has its appropriate, and, under proper  conditions, educational and refining uses. In fact, the theatre (in  which is performed the legitimate drama) would seem to be in certain  respects a necessity, affording as it does occasional change of scene,  and ministering to that desire for relaxation and amusement so  naturally, so invariably felt by those persons who have not, in a true  sense, homes. Nevertheless, our firesides should be made to compete  with, nay, to far surpass in attractiveness, all places of public  amusement; for it is very much better that the employments and  _entertainments_ of our homes should charm and retain their members,  than that these should be sought for outside their, in some respects,  sacred confines. The reasons for this are so apparent to the  thoughtful, that they need not be greatly enlarged upon. Briefly,  then, in the home is _safety_: over its members are extended the  protecting wings of guardian angels; while without are often snares  and danger, either in palpable forms, or in those hidden by the  glittering, the alluring disguises which are so often thrown over  vice. On this very subject with what truth and directness Cotton  speaks, when he says,--         \"If solid happiness we prize,       Within our breasts this jewel lies;         And they are fools that roam.       The world has nothing to bestow:       From our own selves our joys must flow,         _And that dear hut, our home_!\"    Nor need I dwell at great length upon the delights and benefits  afforded the members of families whose leisure is given to the study  and practice of an art so ennobling as music. How charming are those  homes in which it is, in its purest style, cultivated! what refinement  reigns therein! and what a gentle yet potent aid it is in parental  government! The allurements to outside and often harmful pleasures  lose their power over the children of that household in which music's  engaging, magic influence holds delightful, elevating sway. And then  at times, when instruments and voices mingle in a \"concord of sweet  sounds,\" how delightful is the effect, how serenely beautiful is the  scene! Often have I, when passing in the evening a dwelling from which  floated out upon the air the notes of tuneful voices, accompanied by  the piano-forte or some other instrument, paused to listen, lingering  long, the ear so ravished by the sweet sounds as to cause me to stand  almost spell-bound, and to remain under music's magic influence even  after its charming sounds had died away.         \"The music in my heart I bore       Long after it was heard no more.\"    To the great aid afforded them by music in government, the teachers in  our common schools can testify. Often a turbulent school, swayed by  youthful passions, or wearied by monotonous study into a state of  painful unrest, has been stilled, calmed, and refreshed by the  singing of a song,--an indulgence in the enjoyment of its melody  affording delightful relaxation, and also awaking to life that better,  that poetic sentiment that abides in every soul. The writer readily  recalls his own experience as a teacher in gently enforcing lessons in  polite deportment among his pupils by the aid of music. The exercises  of each session of his school were always begun and ended with song;  while sometimes, for reasons previously mentioned, books were laid  aside, and all joined in singing, even during a part of the time  usually devoted to study. By such procedure (the songs were of the  simplest kind, and without the adding charm of instrumental  accompaniment), even the most unruly pupils were generally induced to  yield to the softening influences of \"magic numbers and persuasive  sound.\" In regard to the influence wielded over the mind and heart by  songs, an eminent writer thus speaks: \"Songs have at all times, and in  all places, afforded amusement and consolation to mankind: every  passion in the human breast has been vented in song; and the most  savage as well as the most civilized inhabitants of the earth have  encouraged these effusions.\" The following description of the effects  of music at a reform-school is quite interesting in this connection.  It is clipped from a recent number of \"The Boston Transcript.\"         \"A reporter of 'The San Francisco Chronicle,' who recently       visited the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28057"],[0,"Highways and Byways in Surrey (#10)"],[1,"ward, \"rather a bulky man for a  cricketer,\" was buried close to Lord's ground, aged 86; Barber, who  kept the Bat and Ball on Broad Halfpenny Down, was 71; William Fennex,  at the age of 75, walked ninety miles in three days, carrying an  umbrella, clothes, and three cricket bats (but he died soon after);  William Lambert, almost the greatest of Surrey hitters, and the first  player who ever made two centuries in the same match, died at 72; Lumpy  Stevens, who won L100 for Lord Tankerville by hitting a feather once in  four balls, and lies in Walton churchyard, was 84; John Small, who saved  his life by playing his violin to a ferocious bull, to the \"admiration  and perfect satisfaction of the mischievous beast,\" lived to be 89; Tom  Sueter--\"I have never seen a handsomer man than Tom Sueter,\" wrote  Nyren--lived to be 77; \"Shock\" White, with his bat as broad as his  stumps, \"a short and rather stoutly-made man,\" was buried at Reigate,  aged 91; Yalden of Chertsey,--he jumped over a fence and then on his  back caught the ball--was 84; and John Wells, buried at Farnham, died at  the age of 76. John Wells shared with \"Silver Billy\" a curious  distinction. He was Beldham's brother-in-law, and an admiring publican  at Wrecclesham put up a sign to draw thirsty wayfarers to Wrecclesham's  best beer. It was \"The Rendezvous of the Celebrated Cricketers, Beldham  and Wells.\" If it were still standing, it would attract a pilgrimage.

Hardly two miles from Farnham, and reached by a road overarched by fine  oaks, Moor Park stands on the banks of the Wey. A turn in the lane  throws open a view of rich hayfields and pasture, with the river winding  in and out under a ridge of oakwoods; much the same view, perhaps, as  Swift first had of the fields and the Wey when he came to Moor Park from  Ireland to copy out Sir William Temple's essays and to meet the  dark-eyed waiting-maid who was to inspire one of the great passions of  literary history.    Moor Park was Sir William Temple's new name for an old manor. The name  under which he bought the house and land was Compton Hall, and he  renamed it after a property in Hertfordshire. \"The perfectest figure of  a garden I ever saw, either at home or abroad, was that of Moor Park in  Hertfordshire, when I knew it about thirty years ago,\" he wrote in his  _Essay on the Gardens of Epicures_: and he laid out his own garden in  the Dutch style which he admired. The garden has changed with the  changing tastes of later owners; the house has fared a little better,  though it was once metamorphosed into a Hydropathic Sanatorium--a new  and dismal Tale of a Tub.    [Illustration: _Moor Park._]    Moor Park, when Sir William Temple had it, saw the writing of many  books. Sir William Temple himself, deeply hurt with his sovereign, James  II, for striking his name off the Privy Council, had vowed to give up  diplomacy and turn to gardening and writing for the rest of his life.  His gardening may have been as good as his writing, and his essay on  Gardening is, of all his writings, perhaps the best. But it was in his  seclusion at Moor Park that he wrote, also, one of the most ridiculous  papers that ever brought the fame of an essayist to a retired  politician. His _Essay Upon the Ancient and Modern Learning_ remains one  of the most astonishing examples of the admirable writing down of trash  in the history of letters. Quite unnecessarily, he had taken up the task  of comparing modern writers with ancient, to the disadvantage of the  modern, and he cannot be said to have been well equipped for the  business. He had never read a word of Greek, and he achieved the  distinction of criticising modern writing without a single reference to  the works of Dante, Petrarch, Tasso, Ariosto, Moliere, Racine,  Corneille, Chaucer, Spenser, Milton, and Shakespeare. The extraordinary  thing is that the book was welcomed, and when a quarrel was struck over  his claim that the Letters of Phalaris (which he could not read) were  the best Letters in the world, he found ready champions. They were  hopelessly defeated by Bentley, but Sir William Temple fortunately died  before the defeat.    Better books were written at Moor Park by Sir William's secretary.  Jonathan Swift, angry and rebellious, hating the authority and restraint  of his Irish University, came to England an uncouth, ill-balanced,  extravagant creature of twenty-one, and settled, or half-settled, to his  work as amanuensis. He threw up his post in a rage, went over to Ireland  and was ordained priest, made up his quarrel with his patron and came  back to Moor Park to write _The Tale of a Tub_ and _The Battle of the  Books_. But the books were almost incidents. The mainspring of his life  was his melancholy devotion to the pretty girl who waited on Lady  Giffard, Sir William Temple's sister. She was Esther Johnson, daughter  of Sir William's steward, but as Swift's Stella she lives in the story  of sad and mysterious passions with Heloise and Laura.    Sir William Temple died in 1699, and was buried by his wife's side in  Westminster Abbey; all but his heart, and that was laid in a silver box  under the sundial in his garden. He left his papers to Swift, who wrote  that there had died \"with him all that was good and amiable among men,\"  and to prove it quarrelled acrimoniously with the family.    Of another, gentler inmate of Moor Park we hear very little. Her fame  was assured her when, as Dorothy Osborne, she had waited seven years to  marry William Temple, and had sent to him, without an idea that they  would reach an English public, some of the most graceful girlish letters  ever written. After her marriage she leaves the scene, or we see her  seldom. She corresponded with Queen Mary, but Swift has little to tell  us about her. She, at least, could never have enraged him.    [Illustration: _Stella's Cottage._]    Moor Park lies along the banks of the Wey, and through it runs a drive  open to foot passengers, but not to bicycles or dogs. Nearly at the end  of the drive going towards Waverley Abbey is a curious cave, lined and  roofed at the entrance with stone, and barred and gated and spiked with  iron, evidently a fit habitation, once upon a time, for a very  witch-like old woman. The gates, or rather railings which do not open,  must have been placed there many years ago, for no initials have been  carved, or at least none are visible, on the stone within. The cave runs  back, some way from the road, into pleasantly dubious darkness. In this  case, according to the tradition of the place, lived the witch, Mother  Ludlam, whose caldron lies in the tower of Frensham Church. Another  excavation in the ground a few yards away has also its own tradition,  or rather two traditions. One is that it was the regular abode of a  hermit named Foote, who starved to death in it; another, that Foote was  a lunatic who was found dying in the hole, but actually died in the  workhouse. The details are precise. \"Foote was a gentleman. He came one  day to the Unicorn Inn at Farnham. Next day he hired a man to wheel a  heavy portmanteau to Moor Park gate, when he told the man to put it  down. Foote was taken very ill, was found by old Hill the keeper and  taken to Swift's cottage where Hill lived. The union officials took  Foote and his heavy portmanteau to the Union. 'It's only buttons  inside,' said they. 'It's gold! gold!' exclaimed Foote with his dying  breath.\" So runs the local version.    [Illustration: _In Moor Park._]    At the gates of the entrance of Moor Park stands a charming cottage,  brick and timber embowered in roses. It has been known at different  times as \"Dean Swift's Cottage\" and \"Stella's Cottage.\" Perhaps neither  lived there. Outside the park the Wey broadens out into a wide pool,  shaded by magnificent sycamores, and then drops through sluices to a  lower level, to twist back to the north-west under the walls of Waverley  Abbey.    Waverley Abbey is the greatest of the ruins in a county where ruins are  few. Once the Abbey precinct covered sixty acres of ground; to-day  nothing remains but tumbled walls and broken gates. It was not the  oldest nor the richest of Abbeys in the county, but in some ways it was  the noblest foundation of all. It was the earliest house of Cistercian  monks in England; it inherited the spirit and the traditions of one of  the finest of the monastic orders, the stricter sect of the monks of St.  Benedict; its brethren were simple, kindly men with few wants and little  money, who yet were generous hosts and the most skilful farmers of their  day; it was the elder sister of Tintern Abbey, the mother of the Abbeys  of Garendon, Ford, Combe and Thame, and the grandmother of seven others;  and its abbots had precedence in the chapters of abbots throughout the  order of Cistercians.    The White Monks, as the Cistercians were called, used to choose wild and  lonely places for their churches, and Waverley Abbey, which stands in  fields even now sometimes flooded, in its early days was more than once  in difficulties through rain and bad seasons. It was founded in 1128 by  William Giffard, the second Bishop of Winchester after the Conquest,  and the buildings were still unfinished when, in 1201, a great storm  inundated the Abbey, almost carried away its walls, and ruined all its  crops, wheat, hay, and flax. Two years later, from the failure of the  harvest after the flood, corn was so scarce that the monks had to  scatter themselves among other Convents till they could thresh another  summer's corn. In 1215 the spring from which they got all the water  suddenly failed, and"]]]
