[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34211"],[0,"A Treatise on Physiology and Hygiene (#10)"],[1," the body? What is the advantage?]    5. WATER.--Water, from a physiological point of view, is the most important  of all the articles of food. It is everywhere found in the body, even in  the bones and the teeth. It has been computed that as large a proportion as  two-thirds of the body is water. The teeth, the densest of the solids in  the human system, contain ten per cent. of water. The muscles, tendons, and  ligaments are more than half water; for it is found that they lose more  than half their {55} weight when dried with moderate heat. But it is in the  _fluids_ of the body that water is found most abundantly. It gives to them  the power of holding a great variety of substances in solution, and is the  great highway by which new supplies are conveyed to the point where they  are required, and by which old particles of matter, that have served their  uses, are brought to the outlets of the body to be thus removed from the  system.    [Sidenote: 6. Length of time man can do without food or water? Give the  comparison? Bulk of drinks? Constituent of meats, etc.? Fruits?]    6. Man can remain a longer time without solid food than without water. He  may be deprived of the former for ten to twelve hours without great  suffering, but deprivation of water for the same length of time will  produce both severe pain and great weakness. The food should contain not  less than two parts of water to one of solid nutriment. Water constitutes  the great bulk of all our drinks, and is also a large constituent of the  meats, vegetables, and fruits which come upon the table. Fruits,  especially, contain it in great abundance, and, in their proper season,  furnish most agreeable and refreshing supplies of the needed fluid.    [Sidenote: 7. Salt, how obtained? Where found? In the human body?  Importance of salt? What else can you state of the value of salt?]    7. COMMON SALT.--Salt, or sodium chloride, as an article of food, is  obtained chiefly from the mineral kingdom; although plants contain it in  small quantities, and it is also found in the tissues of nearly all animals  used as food. In the human body, it is an ingredient of all the solids and  fluids. The importance of salt to animal life in general, is shown by the  great appetite for it manifested by domestic animals, and also by the  habitual resort of herds of wild beasts to the \"salt-licks\" or springs. In  those parts of the world where salt is obtained with difficulty, man places  a very high price upon it.    [Sidenote: 8. Experiments upon animals?]    8. Experiments upon domestic animals show that the withdrawal of salt from  their food, not only makes their {56} hides rough and causes the hair to  fall out, but also interferes with the proper digestion of food. If it be  withheld persistently, they become entirely unable to appropriate  nourishment, and die of starvation.    [Sidenote: 9. Salt, how taken into the system? Its use in cooking?  Consumption?]    9. Salt is usually taken into the system in sufficient quantities in our  food. Even the water we drink often has traces of it. The habitual use of  much salt in cooking, or as a seasoning at the table, is not wise; and  while it may not lead to consumption, as some writers declare, it is a bad  habit in itself, and leads to the desire for other and more injurious  condiments.    [Sidenote: 10. Lime in the bones? What does it impart? Chief ingredient of  the bones and teeth? Where else found?]    10. LIME.--This is the mineral substance which we have spoken of before as  entering very largely into the composition of the bones. It is the  important element which gives solidity and permanence to the framework upon  which the body is built. Calcium tri-phosphate, or \"bone-earth,\" is the  chief ingredient of the bones and teeth, but is found in the cartilages and  other parts of the body in smaller quantities.    [Sidenote: 11. How does lime find its way into the body? Early life? Effect  of its derivation?]    11. How does this substance find its way into the body? Meat, milk, and  other articles obtained from the animal kingdom contain it, and it is  abundantly stored away also in the grains from which our bread is made, in  wheat, rye, and Indian corn. In early life, while the body is growing, the  supplies of this substance should be carefully provided. The evil effects  of the deprivation of it are too often and painfully evident in the  softening of the bones, and in the predisposition to curvature of the  spine--deformities which are most deplorable and which continue through  life.    [Sidenote: 12. Iron, its abundance and diffusion? Where found? What part of  the blood is it? How supplied to the system? In case of loss of blood or  wasting disease?]    12. IRON.--This substance is probably the most abundant and widely diffused  of the metals. It is found in {57} most of the vegetables, and is a very  important component of animal tissues. It enters into the composition of  human blood in about one part per thousand. Ordinarily, the food conveys to  the system enough iron for its use, but it must sometimes be introduced  separately as a remedy, especially after great loss of blood, or after some  wasting disease. Under its influence the blood seems to be rapidly  restored, and a natural color of the lips and skin replaces the pallor  caused by disease.    [Sidenote: 13. Soda, potash, and magnesia? How do they occur?]    13. OTHER INORGANIC SUBSTANCES.--In addition to the substances mentioned,  the mineral kingdom supplies compounds of soda, potash, and magnesia, which  are essential for the use of the body. They occur in small quantities in  the body, and enter it in combination with the various articles of diet.    [Sidenote: 14. Organic substances, whence derived? What do they comprise?  Groups?]    14. ORGANIC SUBSTANCES.--These substances are derived from the vegetable  and animal creations. They comprise all those articles which are commonly  spoken of as \"food,\" and which are essential to sustain the body in life  and strength. They are divided into three groups, namely: the Albuminoid  substances, the Fats, and Sugars.    [Sidenote: 15. The Albuminoid class, includes what? These compounds  constitute what? The food? Their importance? Their properties?]    15. THE ALBUMINOIDS.--This class includes three important nutritive  substances--(1) _Albumen_, which gives it its name; (2) _Fibrin_, including  _gluten_; and (3) _Casein_. These compounds constitute a large part of the  human body, and the food contains them in proportionally large quantities.  Their importance is so great, and the system so promptly suffers from their  absence, that they have been styled the \"_nutritious_ substances.\" The  properties which they hold in common are, that they do not crystallize, and  have a jelly-like form, except when heat is applied to them, when they  harden, or _coagulate_. {58}    [Sidenote: 16. Decomposition? Effect of cold? Illustrations? Elephants?]    16. They likewise decompose, or _putrefy_, under the influence of warmth  and moisture. Hence the decay of all dead animal tissues. Cold arrests this  process. It is well known that milk, eggs, and the like, \"keep\" much longer  in winter than at other seasons. The bodies of elephants, caught in the ice  many hundred years ago, are occasionally borne by the icebergs to the coast  of Siberia, completely frozen, but preserved almost perfectly in form and  limb.    [Sidenote: 17. In what substances does albumen exist? What further is said  of the egg?]    17. ALBUMEN exists in milk, meat, the grains, and the juices of many  plants; but the purest form is obtained from the white of egg. When we  consider that an egg is composed chiefly of albumen and water--namely, six  parts in seven; and when we also consider the numerous, diverse, and  complex tissues--the muscles, bones, internal organs, bill, claws, and  feathers--with which the chick is equipped on leaving his shell, we are  impressed with the importance of these apparently simple constituents of  the food and body.    [Sidenote: 18. Fibrin, gluten, clotting of the blood?]    18. FIBRIN is derived from meats, and exists in the blood both of man and  the lower animals. _Gluten_, or vegetable fibrin, resembles closely true  fibrin, and is abundantly furnished in wheat and other grains from which  flour is commonly made. Animal fibrin coagulates spontaneously when it is  removed from the body, and thus causes the \"clotting\" of the blood.    [Sidenote: 19. Casein? Its coagulation? Effect of rennet? Making of  cheese?]    19. CASEIN is the curdy ingredient of milk, and a highly important  food-substance. Its coagulation in milk takes place not from heat, but by  the addition of an acid, and also when milk becomes sour from exposure to  the air. It is commonly effected, however, by introducing a piece of  _rennet_, a preparation made from a calf's stomach. The _curds_, or casein,  may then be separated from the _whey_, {59} and made into cheese, by  pressing it sufficiently to drive off the water.    [Sidenote: 20. What are the fats? The oils? How supplied? How alike?  Emulsifying? Example? How do we know it?]    20. THE FATS OR OILS.--This is the second group of organic foods. Those  which are more solid are called _fats_: the more fluid ones are the _oils_.  Oleaginous substances are supplied in both animal and vegetable food; but,  from whatever source derived, they are chemically much alike. They are  insoluble in water, and yet they unite readily with the watery fluids of  the body, and are by them conveyed to its various parts for their  nourishment. This is due to their property of \"emulsifying;\" that is, they  are held in suspension, in a finely divided state, in water. Ordinary milk  is an example of an _emulsion_. We know that it contains fat; for butter is  obtained from it, and, under the microscope, the minute oil-globules may be  distinctly seen.    [Sidenote: 21. Whence are fatty articles"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3422"],[0,"The Life of the Fly; With Which are Interspersed Some Chapters of Autobiography (#10)"],[1," why did not I open  a shop and expose for sale some packets of candles, a dozen dried cod,  a barrel of sardines and a few cakes of soap! I am no more of a fool nor  any less industrious than another; and I should have made my way. But,  as it was, what could I expect? As an accoucheur of brains, a molder of  intellects, I had no claim even to bread and cheese.    Here is my former habitation, occupied since by droning monks. In the  embrasure of that window, sheltered from profane hands, between the  closed outer shutters and the panes, I used to keep my chemicals, bought  for a few sous cheated out of the weekly budget in the early days of our  housekeeping. The bowl of a pipe was my crucible, a sweet jar my retort,  mustard pots my receptacles for oxides and sulfides. My experiments,  harmless or dangerous, were made on a corner of the fire beside the  simmering broth.    How I should love to see that room again where I pored over  differentials and integrals, where I calmed my poor burning head  by gazing at Mont Ventoux, whose summit held in store for my coming  expedition' those denizens of arctic climes, the saxifrage and the  poppy! And to see my familiar friend, the blackboard which I hired at  five francs a year from a crusty joiner, that board whose value I paid  many times over, though I. could never buy it outright, for want of the  necessary cash! The conic sections which I described on that blackboard,  the learned hieroglyphics!    Though all my efforts, which were the more deserving because I had to  work alone, led to almost nothing in that congenial calling, I would  begin it all over again if I could. I should love to be conversing for  the first time with Leibnitz and Newton, with Laplace and Lagrange, with  Cuvier and Jussieu, even if I had afterwards to solve that other arduous  problem: how to procure one's daily bread. Ah, young men, my successors,  what an easy time you have of it today! If you don't know it, then let  me tell you so by means of these few pages from the life of one of your  elders.    But let us not forget our insects, while listening to the echoes of  illusions and difficulties roused in my memories by the cupboard window  and the hired blackboard. Let us go back to the sunken roads of the  Legue, which have become classic, so they say, since the appearance of  my notes on the Oil beetles. Ye illustrious ravines, with your sun-baked  slopes, if I have contributed a little to your fame, you, in your turn,  have given me many fair hours of forgetfulness in the happiness of  learning. You, at least, did not lure me with vain hopes; all that you  promised you gave me and often a hundredfold. You are my promised land,  where I would have sought at the last to pitch my observer's tent. My  wish was not to be realized. Let me, at least, in passing, greet my  beloved animals of the old days.    I raise my hat to Cerceris tuberculata, whom I see engaged on that  slant, storing her Cleonus [a large species of weevil]. As I saw her  then, so I see her now: the same staggering attempts to hoist the prey  to the mouth of the burrow; the same brawls between males watching in  the brushwood of the kermes oak. The sight of them sends a younger blood  coursing through my veins; I receive as it were the breath of a new  springtime of life. Time presses; let us pass on.    Another bow on this side. I hear buzzing up above, on that ledge, a  colony of Sphex wasps, stabbing their crickets. We will give them a  friendly glance, but no more. My acquaintances here are too numerous;  I have not the leisure to renew my former relations with all of them.  Without stopping, a wave of the hat to the Philanthi [bee-hunting wasps]  who send the long avalanches of rubbish streaming down from their  nests; and to Stizus ruficornis, [a hunting wasp] who stacks her praying  mantises between two flakes of sandstone; and to the silky Ammophila  [a digger wasp] with the red legs, who collects an underground store of  loopers [also known as measuring worms, the larvae or caterpillars of  the geometrid moth] and to the Tachtyti [hunting wasps], devourers of  locusts; and to the Eumenes, builders of clay cupolas on a bough.    Here we are at last. This high, perpendicular rock, facing the south  to a length of some hundreds of yards and riddled with holes like a  monstrous sponge, is the time-honored dwelling place of the hairy-footed  Anthophora and of her rent free tenant, the three-horned Osmia. Here  also swarm their exterminators: the Sitaris beetle, the parasite of the  Anthophora; the Anthrax fly, the murderer of the Osmia. Ill informed as  to the proper period, I have come rather late, on the 10th of September.  I should have been here a month ago, or even by the end of July, to  watch the fly's operations. My journey threatens to be fruitless: I see  but a few rare Anthrax flies, hovering round the face of the cliff. We  will not despair, however, and we will begin by consulting the locality.    The Anthophora's cells contain this bee in the larval stage. Some of  them provide me with the oil beetle and the Sitaris, rare finds at one  time, today of no use to me. Others contain the Melecta [a parasitic  bee] in the form of a highly colored pupa, or even in that of the full  grown insect. The Osmia, still more precocious, though dating from the  same period, shows herself exclusively in the adult form, a bad omen for  my investigations, for what the Anthrax demands is the larva and not the  perfect insect. The fly's grub doubles my apprehensions. Its development  is complete, the larva on which it feeds is consumed, perhaps several  weeks ago. I no longer doubt but that I have come too late to see what  happens in the Osmia's cocoons.    Is the game lost? Not yet. My notes contain evidence of Anthrax flies  hatching in the latter half of September. Besides, those whom I now see  exploring the rock are not there to take exercise: their preoccupation  is the settling of the family. These belated ones cannot tackle the  Osmia, who, with her firm, adult flesh, would not suit the nursling's  delicate needs and who, moreover, powerful as she is, would offer  resistance. But in autumn a less numerous colony of honey gatherers  takes the place, upon the slope, of the spring colony, from which  it differs in species. In particular, I see the Diadem Anthidium [a  clothier bee who lines her nest with wool and cotton] at work, entering  her galleries at one time with her harvest of pollen dust and at  another with her little bale of cotton. Might not these autumnal Bees be  themselves exploited by the Anthrax, the same that selected the Osmia as  her victim a couple of months earlier? This would explain the presence  of the Anthrax flies whom I now see fussing about.    A little reassured by this conjecture, I take my stand at the foot  of the rock, under a broiling sun; and, for half a day, I follow the  evolutions of my flies. They flit quietly in front of the slope, at a  few inches from the earthy covering. They go from one orifice to the  next, but without even penetrating. For that matter, their big wings,  extended crosswise even when at rest, would resist their entrance into a  gallery, which is too narrow to admit those spreading sails. And so they  explore the cliff, going to and fro and up and down, with a flight that  is now sudden, now smooth and slow. From time to time, I see the Anthrax  quickly approach the wall and lower her abdomen as though to touch the  earth with the end of her ovipositor. This proceeding takes no longer  than the twinkling of an eye. When it is done, the insect alights  elsewhere and rests. Then it resumes its sober flight, its long  investigations and its sudden blows with the tip of its belly against  the layer of earth. The Bombylii [bee flies] observe similar tactics  when soaring at a short height above the ground.    I at once rushed to the spot touched, lens in hand, in the hope of  finding the egg which everything told me was laid during that tap of the  abdomen. I could distinguish nothing, in spite of the closest attention.  It is true that my exhaustion, together with the blinding light and  scorching heat, made examination very difficult. Afterwards, when I made  the acquaintance of the tiny thing that issues from that egg, my failure  no longer surprised me. In the leisure of my study, with my eyes rested  and with my most powerful glasses held in a hand no longer shaking with  excitement and fatigue, I have the very greatest difficulty in finding  the infinitesimal creature, though I know exactly where it lies. Then  how could I see the egg, worn out as I was under the sun-baked cliff,  how discover the precise spot of a laying performed in a moment by an  insect seen only at a distance? In the painful conditions wherein I  found myself, failure was inevitable.    Despite my negative attempts, therefore, I remain convinced that the  Anthrax flies strew their eggs one by one, on the spots frequented by  those bees who suit their grubs. Each of their sudden strokes with the  tip of the abdomen represents a laying. They take no precaution to place  the germ under cover; for that matter, any such precaution would be  rendered impossible by the mother's structure. The egg, that delicate  object, is laid roughly in the blazing sun, between grains of sand,  in some wrinkle of the calcined chalk. That summary installation is  sufficient, provided the coveted larva be near at hand. It is for the  young grub now to manage as best it can at its own risk and peril.    Though the sunken roads of the Legue did not tell me all that I wished  to know, they at least made it very probable that the coming grub must  reach the victualled cell by its own efforts. But the grub which we  know, the one that drains the bag of fat which may be a Chalicodoma  larva or an Osmia larva, cannot move from its place, still less indulge  in journeys of discovery through the thickness of a"]]]
