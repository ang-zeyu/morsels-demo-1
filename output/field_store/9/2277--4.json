The common law gave the Sovereign no power to control his  troops. The Parliament, regarding them as mere tools of tyranny, had not  been disposed to give such power by statute. James indeed had  induced his corrupt and servile judges to put on some obsolete laws a  construction which enabled him to punish desertion capitally. But this  construction was considered by all respectable jurists as unsound,  and, had it been sound, would have been far from effecting all that was  necessary for the purpose of maintaining military discipline. Even James  did not venture to inflict death by sentence of a court martial. The  deserter was treated as an ordinary felon, was tried at the assizes by a  petty jury on a bill found by a grand jury, and was at liberty to  avail himself of any technical flaw which might be discovered in the  indictment.    The Revolution, by altering the relative position of the prince and the  parliament, had altered also the relative position of the army and the  nation. The King and the Commons were now at unity; and both were alike  menaced by the greatest military power which had existed in Europe  since the downfall of the Roman empire. In a few weeks thirty thousand  veterans, accustomed to conquer, and led by able and experienced  captains, might cross from the ports of Normandy and Brittany to our  shores. That such a force would with little difficulty scatter three  times that number of militia, no man well acquainted with war could  doubt. There must then be regular soldiers; and, if there were to be  regular soldiers, it must be indispensable, both to their efficiency,  and to the security of every other class, that they should be kept under  a strict discipline. An ill disciplined army has ever been a more costly  and a more licentious militia, impotent against a foreign enemy, and  formidable only to the country which it is paid to defend. A strong line  of demarcation must therefore be drawn between the soldiers and the  rest of the community. For the sake of public freedom, they must, in the  midst of freedom, be placed under a despotic rule. They must be subject  to a sharper penal code, and to a more stringent code of procedure,  than are administered by the ordinary tribunals. Some acts which in the  citizen are innocent must in the soldier be crimes. Some acts which in  the citizen are punished with fine or imprisonment must in the soldier  be punished with death. The machinery by which courts of law ascertain  the guilt or innocence of an accused citizen is too slow and too  intricate to be applied to an accused soldier. For, of all the maladies  incident to the body politic, military insubordination is that which  requires the most prompt and drastic remedies. If the evil be not  stopped as soon as it appears, it is certain to spread; and it cannot  spread far without danger to the very vitals of the commonwealth. For  the general safety, therefore, a summary jurisdiction of terrible extent  must, in camps, be entrusted to rude tribunals composed of men of the  sword.    But, though it was certain that the country could not at that moment  be secure without professional soldiers, and equally certain that  professional soldiers must be worse than useless unless they were placed  under a rule more arbitrary and severe than that to which other men were  subject, it was not without great misgivings that a House of Commons  could venture to recognise the existence and to make provision for the  government of a standing army. There was scarcely a public man of note  who had not often avowed his conviction that our polity and a standing  army could not exist together. The Whigs had been in the constant habit  of repeating that standing armies had destroyed the free institutions of  the neighbouring nations. The Tories had repeated as constantly that, in  our own island, a standing army had subverted the Church, oppressed the  gentry, and murdered the King. No leader of either party could, without  laying himself open to the charge of gross inconsistency, propose that  such an army should henceforth be one of the permanent establishments  of the realm. The mutiny at Ipswich, and the panic which that mutiny  produced, made it easy to effect what would otherwise have been in the  highest degree difficult. A short bill was brought in which began by  declaring, in explicit terms, that standing armies and courts martial  were unknown to the law of England. It was then enacted that, on account  of the extreme perils impending at that moment over the state, no man  mustered on pay in the service of the crown should, on pain of death,  or of such lighter punishment as a court martial should deem sufficient,  desert his colours or mutiny against his commanding officers. This  statute was to be in force only six months; and many of those who voted  for it probably believed that it would, at the close of that period,  be suffered to expire. The bill passed rapidly and easily. Not a single  division was taken upon it in the House of Commons. A mitigating clause  indeed, which illustrates somewhat curiously the manners of that age,  was added by way of rider after the third reading. This clause provided  that no court martial should pass sentence of death except between the  hours of six in the morning and one in the afternoon. The dinner hour  was then early; and it was but too probable that a gentleman who had  dined would be in a state in which he could not safely be trusted with  the lives of his fellow creatures. With this amendment, the first and  most concise of our many Mutiny Bills was sent up to the Lords, and was,  in a few hours, hurried by them through all its stages and passed by the  King. [48]    Thus was made, without one dissentient voice in Parliament, without one  murmur in the nation, the first step towards a change which had become  necessary to the safety of the state, yet which every party in the state  then regarded with extreme dread and aversion. Six months passed;  and still the public danger continued. The power necessary to the  maintenance of military discipline was a second time entrusted to the  crown for a short term. The trust again expired, and was again renewed.  By slow degrees familiarity reconciled the public mind to the names,  once so odious, of standing army and court martial. It was proved by  experience that, in a well constituted society, professional soldiers  may be terrible to a foreign enemy, and yet submissive to the civil  power. What had been at first tolerated as the exception began to be  considered as the rule. Not a session passed without a Mutiny Bill.  When at length it became evident that a political change of the highest  importance was taking place in such a manner as almost to escape notice,  a clamour was raised by some factious men desirous to weaken the hands  of the government, and by some respectable men who felt an honest but  injudicious reverence for every old constitutional tradition, and who  were unable to understand that what at one stage in the progress of  society is pernicious may at another stage be indispensable. This  clamour however, as years rolled on, became fainter and fainter.  The debate which recurred every spring on the Mutiny Bill came to be  regarded merely as an occasion on which hopeful young orators fresh  from Christchurch were to deliver maiden speeches, setting forth how  the guards of Pisistratus seized the citadel of Athens, and how the  Praetorian cohorts sold the Roman empire to Didius. At length  these declamations became too ridiculous to be repeated. The most  oldfashioned, the most eccentric, politician could hardly, in the reign  of George the Third, contend that there ought to be no regular soldiers,  or that the ordinary law, administered by the ordinary courts, would  effectually maintain discipline among such soldiers. All parties being  agreed as to the general principle, a long succession of Mutiny Bills  passed without any discussion, except when some particular article of  the military code appeared to require amendment. It is perhaps because  the army became thus gradually, and almost imperceptibly, one of the  institutions of England, that it has acted in such perfect harmony with  all her other institutions, has never once, during a hundred and sixty  years, been untrue to the throne or disobedient to the law, has never  once defied the tribunals or overawed the constituent bodies. To this  day, however, the Estates of the Realm continue to set up periodically,  with laudable jealousy, a landmark on the frontier which was traced  at the time of the Revolution. They solemnly reassert every year the  doctrine laid down in the Declaration of Rights; and they then grant  to the Sovereign an extraordinary power to govern a certain number of  soldiers according to certain rules during twelve months more.    In the same week in which the first Mutiny Bill was laid on the table  of the Commons, another temporary law, made necessary by the unsettled  state of the kingdom, was passed. Since the flight of James many persons  who were believed to have been deeply implicated in his unlawful acts,  or to be engaged in plots for his restoration, had been arrested and  confined. During the vacancy of the throne, these men could derive no  benefit from the Habeas Corpus Act. For the machinery by which alone  that Act could be carried into execution had ceased to exist; and,  through the whole of Hilary term, all the courts in Westminster Hall had  remained closed. Now that the ordinary tribunals were about to resume  their functions, it was apprehended that all those prisoners whom it was  not convenient to bring instantly to trial would demand and obtain their  liberty. A bill was therefore brought in which empowered the King to  detain in custody "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2613"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II — Volume 4 (#10)"],[1," vindications of the Doctor, the pasquinades on the Doctor,  would fill a library. The clamour redoubled when it was known that the  convert had not only been reappointed Master of the Temple, but had  accepted the Deanery of Saint Paul's, which had become vacant in  consequence of the deprivation of Sancroft and the promotion of  Tillotson. The rage of the nonjurors amounted almost to frenzy. Was it  not enough, they asked, to desert the true and pure Church, in this her  hour of sorrow and peril, without also slandering her? It was easy to  understand why a greedy, cowardly hypocrite should refuse to take the  oaths to the usurper as long as it seemed probable that the rightful  King would be restored, and should make haste to swear after the battle  of the Boyne. Such tergiversation in times of civil discord was nothing  new. What was new was that the turncoat should try to throw his own  guilt and shame on the Church of England, and should proclaim that she  had taught him to turn against the weak who were in the right, and to  cringe to the powerful who were in the wrong. Had such indeed been  her doctrine or her practice in evil days? Had she abandoned her Royal  Martyr in the prison or on the scaffold? Had she enjoined her children  to pay obedience to the Rump or to the Protector? Yet was the government  of the Rump or of the Protector less entitled to be called a settled  government than the government of William and Mary? Had not the battle  of Worcester been as great a blow to the hopes of the House of Stuart as  the battle of the Boyne? Had not the chances of a Restoration seemed as  small in 1657 as they could seem to any judicious man in 1691? In spite  of invectives and sarcasms, however, there was Overall's treatise; there  were the approving votes of the two Convocations; and it was much easier  to rail at Sherlock than to explain away either the treatise or the  votes. One writer maintained that by a thoroughly settled government  must have been meant a government of which the title was uncontested.  Thus, he said, the government of the United Provinces became a  settled government when it was recognised by Spain, and, but for that  recognition, would never have been a settled government to the end  of time. Another casuist, somewhat less austere, pronounced that a  government, wrongful in its origin, might become a settled government  after the lapse of a century. On the thirteenth of February 1789,  therefore, and not a day earlier, Englishmen would be at liberty to  swear allegiance to a government sprung from the Revolution. The history  of the chosen people was ransacked for precedents. Was Eglon's a settled  government when Ehud stabbed him? Was Joram's a settled government when  Jehe shot him? But the leading case was that of Athaliah. It was indeed  a case which furnished the malecontents with many happy and pungent  allusions; a kingdom treacherously seized by an usurper near in blood  to the throne; the rightful prince long dispossessed; a part of the  sacerdotal order true, through many disastrous years, to the Royal  House; a counterrevolution at length effected by the High Priest at the  head of the Levites. Who, it was asked, would dare to blame the heroic  pontiff who had restored the heir of David? Yet was not the government  of Athaliah as firmly settled as that of the Prince of Orange?    Hundreds of pages written at this time about the rights of Joash and the  bold enterprise of Jehoiada are mouldering in the ancient bookcases of  Oxford and Cambridge. While Sherlock was thus fiercely attacked by  his old friends, he was not left unmolested by his old enemies. Some  vehement Whigs, among whom Julian Johnson was conspicuous, declared that  Jacobitism itself was respectable when compared with the vile doctrine  which had been discovered in the Convocation Book. That passive  obedience was due to Kings was doubtless an absurd and pernicious  notion. Yet it was impossible not to respect the consistency and  fortitude of men who thought themselves bound to bear true allegiance,  at all hazards, to an unfortunate, a deposed, an exiled oppressor. But  the theory which Sherlock had learned from Overall was unmixed baseness  and wickedness. A cause was to be abandoned, not because it was unjust,  but because it was unprosperous. Whether James had been a tyrant or had  been the father of his people was quite immaterial. If he had won the  battle of the Boyne we should have been bound as Christians to be his  slaves. He had lost it; and we were bound as Christians to be his foes.  Other Whigs congratulated the proselyte on having come, by whatever  road, to a right practical conclusion, but could not refrain from  sneering at the history which he gave of his conversion. He was, they  said, a man of eminent learning and abilities. He had studied the  question of allegiance long and deeply. He had written much about it.  Several months had been allowed him for reading, prayer and reflection  before he incurred suspension, several months more before he incurred  deprivation. He had formed an opinion for which he had declared himself  ready to suffer martyrdom; he had taught that opinion to others; and he  had then changed that opinion solely because he had discovered that it  had been, not refuted, but dogmatically pronounced erroneous by the two  Convocations more than eighty years before. Surely, this was to renounce  all liberty of private judgment, and to ascribe to the Synods of  Canterbury and York an infallibility which the Church of England had  declared that even Oecumenical Councils could not justly claim. If, it  was sarcastically said, all our notions of right and wrong, in matters  of vital importance to the well being of society, are to be suddenly  altered by a few lines of manuscript found in a corner of the library at  Lambeth, it is surely much to be wished, for the peace of mind of humble  Christians, that all the documents to which this sort of authority  belongs should be rummaged out and sent to the press as soon as  possible; for, unless this be done, we may all, like the Doctor when he  refused the oaths last year, be committing sins in the full persuasion  that we are discharging duties. In truth, it is not easy to believe  that the Convocation Book furnished Sherlock with any thing more than a  pretext for doing what he had made up his mind to do. The united force  of reason and interest had doubtless convinced him that his passions and  prejudices had led him into a great error. That error he determined to  recant; and it cost him less to say that his opinion had been changed by  newly discovered evidence, than that he had formed a wrong judgment with  all the materials for the forming of a right judgment before him. The  popular belief was that his retractation was the effect of the tears,  expostulations and reproaches of his wife. The lady's spirit was high;  her authority in the family was great; and she cared much more about her  house and her carriage, the plenty of her table and the prospects of her  children, than about the patriarchal origin of government or the meaning  of the word Abdication. She had, it was asserted, given her husband no  peace by day or by night till he had got over his scruples. In letters,  fables, songs, dialogues without number, her powers of seduction and  intimidation were malignantly extolled. She was Xanthippe pouring water  on the head of Socrates. She was Dalilah shearing Samson. She was Eve  forcing the forbidden fruit into Adam's mouth. She was Job's wife,  imploring her ruined lord, who sate scraping himself among the ashes,  not to curse and die, but to swear and live. While the ballad makers  celebrated the victory of Mrs. Sherlock, another class of assailants  fell on the theological reputation of her spouse. Till he took the  oaths, he had always been considered as the most orthodox of divines.  But the captious and malignant criticism to which his writings were now  subjected would have found heresy in the Sermon on the Mount; and he,  unfortunately, was rash enough to publish, at the very moment when the  outcry against his political tergiversation was loudest, his thoughts  on the mystery of the Trinity. It is probable that, at another time, his  work would have been hailed by good Churchmen as a triumphant answer  to the Socinians and Sabellians. But, unhappily, in his zeal against  Socinians and Sabellians, he used expressions which might be construed  into Tritheism. Candid judges would have remembered that the true path  was closely pressed on the right and on the left by error, and that it  was scarcely possible to keep far enough from danger on one side without  going very close to danger on the other. But candid judges Sherlock was  not likely to find among the Jacobites. His old allies affirmed that he  had incurred all the fearful penalties denounced in the Athanasian Creed  against those who divide the substance. Bulky quartos were written to  prove that he held the existence of three distinct Deities; and some  facetious malecontents, who troubled themselves very little about the  Catholic verity, amused the town by lampoons in English and Latin on his  heterodoxy. \"We,\" said one of these jesters, \"plight our faith to one  King, and call one God to attest our promise. We cannot think it strange  that there should be more than one King to whom the Doctor has sworn  allegiance, when we consider that the Doctor has more Gods than one to  swear by.\" [61]    Sherlock would, perhaps, have doubted whether the government to which he  had submitted was entitled to be called a settled government, if he had  known all the dangers by which it was threatened. Scarcely had Preston's  plot been detected; when a new plot of a very different kind was formed  in the camp, in the navy, in the treasury, in the very bedchamber of  the King. This mystery of iniquity has, through five generations, been  gradually"]]]
