Another piece of advice is: don't _waste time_ in trying to puzzle out the  _meaning_, the why or the wherefore of butterflies' scientific names. Now  and then, certainly, they have some allusion to the insect's appearance, or  to the plant on which it feeds; thus, for instance, _Gonepteryx Rhamni_,  the entomological name of the Brimstone Butterfly, means the  \"_Angle-winged_ (butterfly) _of the Buckthorn_,\" and this is very  appropriate and descriptive; but in general there is no more connexion  between the name and the character of a butterfly, than there is between a  ship's name--the \"_Furious_,\" the \"_Coquette_,\" or the \"_Pretty Jane_,\" as  it may be--and the moral disposition or personal appearance of the vessel  that bears it.    Also, don't _waste money_ and encourage dishonesty, by {62} giving the  absurdly large prices put upon _British_, or _pretended_ British specimens  of butterflies, or other insects that are rare in this country though  common on the Continent; when, for all purposes of science, or the pleasure  derived from their beauty, _avowed_ Continental specimens, at one-twentieth  of the price, will do just as well. In putting these into your cabinet,  however, always attach to the pin underneath the insect a label, bearing  some mark to denote the specimen's foreign origin.           *       *       *       *       *      {63}    CHAPTER VI.    THE BRITISH BUTTERFLIES SEPARATELY DESCRIBED.    THE SWALLOW-TAILED BUTTERFLY. (_Papilio Machaon._)    (Plate III. fig. 1.)    There is no possibility of mistaking this noble insect for any other of our  native species, after a glance at its portrait. Its superior size,  conjoined with the possession of a pair of _long_ tails on the hind wings,  would at once mark it distinctly, independently of the peculiar markings  and colour.    In the colouring of the wings, a broad simplicity prevails, the general  ground-tint being a clear creamy yellow, with the bars and marginal bands  of the deepest velvety black. The broad bands of black on the front wings  are powdered towards the centre with _yellow_ scales, and those on the hind  wings with _blue_ scales. The only other colour on this side is a spot of  rust-red at the inner angle of the hind wings.    The under side is very similar in colouring to the upper, but the black  markings are less decided and sharp, and there are several additional  rust-red spots on the hind wings. {64}    The _caterpillar_, which is a very handsome creature, is found feeding on  various umbelliferous plants; among which, its chief favourites in this  country appear to be the Wild Carrot (_Daucus Carota_), the Marsh  Milk-parsley (_Selinum palustre_), and Fennel (_Anethum Foeniculum_). In  colour it is bright green, with velvet-black rings, which are spotted with  red. A distinguishing mark of this caterpillar is a reddish-coloured forked  appendage just behind its head, which, when the animal is alarmed, gives  out a strong-scented fluid, supposed to be for the purpose of alarming some  of its enemies.    The _chrysalis_, again, is a very pretty object, especially when of its  ordinary colour, which is a lively green, shaded in some parts into bright  yellow; but there is a frequent variety marked only with various shades of  brown and buff. Living specimens of both of these are before me at this  moment, and when they assume the perfect state, I shall be curious to mark  whether these differences are continued in the respective butterflies.    These chrysalides are most interesting objects to keep during the winter  months. As the spring advances, the colours of the butterfly begin to  appear faintly through their thin green envelope, and the pattern of the  upper wings, which only are visible, becomes at last distinctly  perceptible, of course in miniature. When this is the case, we should begin  to watch for the release of the beautiful prisoner.    If you visit his cage the first thing every morning (for his exit most  frequently takes place in the early part of {65} the day), you may be  fortunate enough on one of these occasions, to find the creature either  actually emerging, or just out of his case; cutting an odd figure, and  evidently neither very proud of himself nor much at his ease, his wings  being tiny things, hardly bigger than those of a humble-bee, and hanging  limply from his comparatively ponderous and gigantic body; which they are  nevertheless destined, ere many hours are over, to carry with most enviable  celerity through the air.    The rapid increase in size of these organs is a matter of marvel; you can  literally see them grow, and within about an _hour_ they will have reached  their full expanse. The creature attaches itself, back downwards, to the  lid of its cage, or to the under side of any convenient _horizontal_  surface, that the wings, by their own weight, may aid in their dilatation,  and that they may dry without creasing, as they will sometimes do, when the  insect, being under a slippery bell-glass, for instance, is unable to reach  the desirable point of suspension, which it always evinces extreme anxiety  to do. By the time the sun is well out, our pet will have his wings  thoroughly plumed for flight; and here a difficulty sometimes presents  itself to the entomologist. What is to be done with our new-born Machaon?  It is probably a splendid specimen for the cabinet, and the collector may  long to grace his \"series\" with its virgin splendours. But then there will  creep over him the unwelcome sensation, that it is a somewhat cowardly  proceeding to foster a bright being into a life that might be all  joyousness, {66} and then, taking advantage of his domesticated position,  to cut short that life, almost ere commenced, and to forbid those wondrous  wings to carry their possessor to even one short day's enjoyment of  sunshine and nectar, and the doubtlessly exalted pleasure of mere airy  motion itself. Fairly chasing down a butterfly is all well enough; but this  is quite another thing.    Every one must, however, choose for himself, as to taking the sentimental  or the entomological view of the matter.    Each probably finds its followers, and to the occasional prevalence of the  more tender sentiment, are probably owing many of those stray Swallow-Tails  that turn up here and there in unlikely places.    The chrysalides, for rearing, may be obtained in the autumn or winter,  either from entomologists resident in the localities of the butterfly, or  more generally and certainly from the London or Cambridge dealers, who will  send them into the country by post for a few pence each.    The flight of this species is rapid and powerful, and it has a habit of  soaring loftily.    In this country its head quarters are in the fens of Cambridgeshire,  Norfolk, and Huntingdonshire. It has been found in some abundance near  Cambridge, Norwich, Yaxley, Whittlesea Mere, Burwell, and Hornsey Fens;  also singly in Lancashire, at Battersea, Pulborough in Sussex, near Ashford  in Kent, at Balcombe, Isle of Wight, Hampshire, near Chatham, at Southend,  Essex, and on the Cliffs of the South Coast. {67}    From its local character, this is of course one of the species that the  collector can hardly expect to meet with, except he live in one of the  districts given above as its head quarters. In these, however, it is  abundant enough, and the first sight of a number of these grand insects on  the wing must be enough to gladden the eye of any naturalist.    This butterfly comes out first in May, and is met with from that time till  August.           *       *       *       *       *    THE BRIMSTONE BUTTERFLY. (_Gonepteryx Rhamni._)    (Plate III. fig. 2.)    Though one of the commonest of our native butterflies, this, like  numberless other very common things, is also one of the loveliest, both in  the graceful outline of its wings, and in the lively hue that overspreads  their surface; charms the more to be appreciated, as this insect is one of  the few that do not wait for the full bloom of summer ere they condescend  to make their appearance, but in the earliest, chill months of spring, and  even in the dead winter season, the country rambler is sometimes gladdened  by its gay flight; and in fact there is not one winter month that is not  occasionally enlivened by this flying flower, when a day of unwonted  mildness and sunshine tempts it from its winter retreat. {68}    Until very recently it had always been stated by entomologists, that the  Brimstone Butterfly was \"double-brooded\" (a term meaning that it went  through _two whole cycles of existence_, from the _egg_ to the _perfect  insect_, in _one year_), one brood appearing in May, and the other in the  autumn.    But it is now established, on very satisfactory evidence, that _one brood  only is produced, and that, the autumnal one_. A considerable number of  these survive the winter in some place of concealment, and coming out again  in the spring form the so-called spring brood. Many of these hybernators  are found to be in very fair condition in the spring, but in general they  lack the perfect freshness and bloom of those taken in autumn; the wings of  those I have taken at this period are often semi-transparent, from having  lost feather, and frequently are spotted and discoloured, as if by mildew;  a sign probably of their owners having wintered in damp lodgings.    Mr. Douglas states that they get very fat and full of honey before  consigning themselves to their long winter's sleep; evidently an  instinctive provision against the waste of substance that must of necessity  accompany all, even the most sluggish vitality: in this respect following  the same instinct that leads bears, and other hybernating animals, to  fatten up to their utmost stretch before retiring for the season.

I have caught _Andrenas_ with two  _Stylops_ in them, flying about as usual and apparently none the worse for  their inmates. Probably the position the parasite occupies may make a great  difference in its effects on the bee.    The most notable effect produced by _Stylops_ is the alteration in the  structure and colour of certain of the bee's characteristic features. In  _Andrena_ the males differ very considerably from the females both in form  and colouring. They have no pollen-brushes on their legs, and in some few  species the face above the mouth is white, whereas in the female it is  black. Now the effect of the parasite seems to be to unsex as it were its  victims so far as their outward appearance is concerned. This is no doubt  due to the internal effects it has on the larva of the bee. Anyhow, if a  female is attacked, in most cases the pollen-brush is much reduced, the  face tends to become more hairy, and, if it be the female of a white-faced  male, spots of white are often produced on the face. On the other hand,  {80} if it be a male subject, the hairiness of the face is diminished, the  white colour is often reduced or absent, and the hairiness of the legs is  increased.    Before the effects of the parasite were recognized, several new species  were described simply on specimens of unusual appearance in consequence of  its presence.    These effects, however, like the effects produced on the activity of the  bee, vary exceedingly in extent. On some the parasite seems to have no  effect, in others the alteration in appearance is very great. This, again,  is probably due to the position of the parasites and to the pressure they  exert on the reproductive organs of the body in the larval state.           *       *       *       *       *    {81}    AMONGST THE BEES AT WORK    Now I feel sure many will be thinking \"It is all very well to talk about  all these solitary and social bees, but I never see them. I certainly know  a humble bee with a white tail and another with a red tail, and a wasp, and  perhaps a hornet, but I never notice any others.\" The reason for this, no  doubt, is that people are not as a rule observant, and even if they notice  a creature one moment they probably forget all about it the next. If any  one goes out on a bright spring morning, late in March or early in April,  about 11 o'clock, into a garden well stocked with flowers, it will not, I  think, be many minutes before an insect darts on the wing along some  border, and, if attention be paid to the flowers, a little black hairy bee  with yellow legs, like a small humble bee, will be seen diligently at work  sucking honey from one of them. The darting bee, which is of a brownish red  colour, gradually {82} fading to grey after a few days' exposure to the  sun, is the male, and the black one the female. The male rarely settles,  but flies about courting the female. Often two or three males may be seen  dodging and crossing each other in their flight. The name of this bee is  _Anthophora_. It is quite a harbinger of spring, and I mention it  especially as it so forces itself on one's attention, and there are few who  will not meet with it without going especially on its quest.    Another opportunity of seeing several kinds of solitary bees flying  together may be secured by standing on a sunny day in front of a sallow  bush in full blossom, I mean what is commonly called \"palm.\" Its catkins,  when the anthers are out and covered with yellow pollen, are most  attractive to all kinds of bees, humble bees, hive bees, and solitary bees,  and any one who can manage to watch a sallow bush for some time will  realize that there are many kinds of bees at work. Of course it is  difficult, without special knowledge, to recognize which are bees and which  are flies amongst the many which are coming and going, but the  yellow-pollened legs of the female bees will generally betray them, as well  {83} as their steadier flight. A fly turns about more rapidly than a bee,  and sits down much more abruptly. Bees are very captious about the weather;  they do not like an east wind and are, apparently, very sensitive to coming  wet. I have often gone out on a bright morning and been surprised to find  nothing stirring, and then clouds have come up and proved the wisdom of the  bees in staying at home. They also fly very little in cloudy weather,  especially in the early spring, when the temperature is reduced by cloud  below their fancy. One may be watching a sallow bush and see dozens of  insects flying about. A cloud shadows it, and almost immediately they  disappear, to appear again as suddenly with the return of the sun's rays.  It is interesting to watch bees at work collecting pollen, etc., but if any  one wishes to study them at home, their nesting haunts must, of course, be  visited. These are so various that it is impossible to point them all out,  but the best locality to select is a sandy bank facing south. In June or  July such a bank is often alive with bees, sand-wasps, etc.; here, again,  we want sunshine or the bees will stay in their holes. {84} Even when dull,  however, it is a very interesting spot, and we can notice the numbers of  holes bored in the bank, and their different sizes and shapes; most of them  are round, but some sandwasps make very irregular holes. If we look closely  at some of the holes we shall see something closing the aperture, and, if  we are too inquisitive, that something will disappear down the hole like  lightning; it is the face of the owner of the burrow waiting to come out  for the first ray of sunshine, but the owner is very timid and it will be  some minutes before she puts her face so near danger again. In most of the  sandwasps the face is clothed with bright silvery, or sometimes golden,  hairs, and it is a very pretty sight to see these little silvery faces  peering out of their burrows. Again, one may sometimes notice a little  stream of sand emerging from a hole; this is from some bee who is enlarging  her domain or clearing out some of the sand which occasionally falls in. In  some cases this ejection of sand is done with a great deal of action: the  sand comes streaming out and then the bee follows, quite up to the mouth of  the passage, kicking out the sand as hard as it can. {85} The moment,  however, that the sun comes out the whole bank is full of life; and just as  in the case of the sallow bush, one wonders where it has all been during  the shadow. Bees will now be seen flying home laden with pollen; they will  pause at the opening of their burrow and then disappear suddenly into its  depths. In a very short time they will reappear quite clean and ready for  another journey. Their cleaning apparatus must be wonderfully well adapted  to its purpose. I have often had to remove the pollen from a bee's leg to  see what colour the hairs are, and it takes some time even to brush enough  of it off to ascertain this, and yet the natural cleaning process seems to  take no time in comparison. But to return to our bank, numbers of bees will  be seen coursing up and down and hardly ever settling; these are males  paying what attention they can to any females who have time to attend to  them, and often falling foul of other males intent on similar pursuits. If  one has good luck in the choice of one's bank an elegant wasp-like creature  may occasionally be seen amongst the others; this is one of the cuckoos.  The flight of all the cuckoo bees is peculiar; it is much {86} quieter and  slower than that of the hosts, and a cuckoo may easily be seen solemnly  flying up and down the bank, over the various holes, no doubt watching for  the proper opportunity to enter one, and deposit its egg in it. This  deliberate flight seems a curious habit in a creature which one would think  would wish to escape detection. If it seemed to inspire fear in the mind of  its host it would be different, but they appear to fly about together  unconcerned at each other's presence, and the cuckoo sails along demurely  and imposes on its hosts' labours without any apparent resentment on the  latter's part; both seem to accept their relationship as a matter of  course. Another very interesting frequenter of sandy banks is a pretty  little stout sandwasp, about a quarter of an inch long, called _Oxybelus_.  It has a very bright silvery face which shines most brilliantly in the sun,  and the body has a row of white spots on each side, and it brings flies  back to its nest. It is very active and common, and may often be seen with  its fly going back to its hole. There is a rare species of the same genus,  which is clothed all over with silvery hairs, and this in some places,  curiously {87} enough, selects as its victim a fly which is also coated  with silver. There are, of course, many other inhabitants in such a bank as  this. There are sure to be ants, which are always interesting to watch, and  probably now and then a _Pompilus_ will appear on the scene. These  exceedingly lively creatures which run at a very rapid pace, vibrating  their wings as they go, and taking short flights between the runs, are on  the hunt for spiders. They will be seen to forage amongst any grass or  herbage there may be on the bank, and if they can only secure a spider it  is stung and paralyzed and carried off at once to the nest. Of course every  sand bank will not yield a great number of insects, but some, especially in  sandy districts like Woking, Oxshott, and other parts of the Surrey  commons, and the New Forest, simply teem with life--and would repay any one  for hours of watching and observation.           *       *       *       *       *    {88}    ANTS, THEIR GUESTS AND THEIR LODGERS    The number of insects of different kinds which live in ants' nests, either  as scavengers, stray visitors who have found a lodging for the moment, as  guests carefully taken care of and appreciated by the"]]]
