Two months later the Saxons were again called to arms.  Somerled, a Danish chieftain, had again advanced to Reading, and had  captured and burned the town. The king marched against him, and the two  armies met at Merton. Here another desperate battle took place.    During the first part of the day the Saxons were victorious over both  the divisions of the Danish army, but in the afternoon the latter  received some reinforcements and renewed the fight. The Saxons,  believing that the victory had been won, had fallen into disorder and  were finally driven from the field. Great numbers were slain on both  sides. Bishop Edmund and many Saxon nobles were killed, and King  Ethelred so severely wounded that he expired a few days later, April  23rd, 871, having reigned for five years. He was buried at Wimbourne  Minster, and Prince Alfred ascended the throne.    Ethelred was much regretted by his people, but the accession of Alfred  increased their hopes of battling successfully against the Danes.  Although wise and brave, King Ethelred had been scarcely the monarch  for a warlike people in troubled times. Religious exercises occupied  too large a share of his thoughts. His rule was kindly rather than  strong, and his authority was but weak over his nobles. From Prince  Alfred the Saxons hoped better things. From his boyhood he had been  regarded with special interest and affection by the people, as his  father had led them to regard him as their future king.    The fact that he had been personally consecrated by the pope appeared  to invest him with a special authority. His immense superiority in  learning over all his people greatly impressed them. Though gentle he  was firm and resolute, prompt in action, daring in the field. Thus,  then, although the people regretted King Ethelred, there was a general  feeling of hope and joy when Alfred took his place on the throne. He  had succeeded to the crown but a month when the Danes again advanced in  great numbers. The want of success which had attended them in the last  two battles had damped the spirit of the people, and it was with a very  small force only that Alfred was able to advance against them.    The armies met near Wilton, where the Danes in vastly superior numbers  were posted on a hill. King Alfred led his forces forward and fell upon  the Danes, and so bravely did the Saxons fight that for some time the  day went favourably for them. Gradually the Danes were driven from  their post of vantage, and after some hours' fighting turned to fly;  but, as at Merton and Kesteven, the impetuosity of the Saxons proved  their ruin. Breaking their compact ranks they scattered in pursuit of  the Danes, and these, seeing how small was the number of their  pursuers, rallied and turned upon them, and the Saxons were driven from  the field which they had so bravely won.    \"Unless my brave Saxons learn order and discipline,\" the king said to  Edmund and some of his nobles who gathered round him on the evening  after the defeat, \"our cause is assuredly lost. We have proved now in  each battle that we are superior man to man to the Danes, but we throw  away the fruits of victory by our impetuosity. The great Caesar, who  wrote an account of his battles which I have read in Latin, described  the order and discipline with which the Roman troops fought. They were  always in heavy masses, and even after a battle the heavy-armed  soldiers kept their ranks and did not scatter in pursuit of the enemy,  leaving this task to the more lightly armed troops.    \"Would that we had three or four years before us to teach our men  discipline and order, but alas! there is no time for this. The Danes  have fallen in great numbers in every fight, but they are ever  receiving reinforcements and come on in fresh waves of invasion; while  the Saxons, finding that all their efforts and valour seem to avail  nothing, are beginning fast to lose heart. See how small a number  assembled round my standard yesterday, and yet the war is but  beginning. Truly the look-out is bad for England.\"    The king made strenuous efforts again to raise an army, but the people  did not respond to his call. In addition to the battles which have been  spoken of several others had been fought in different parts of Wessex  by the ealdormen and their followers against bodies of invading Danes.  In the space of one year the Saxons had engaged in eight pitched  battles and in many skirmishes. Great numbers had been slain on both  sides, but the Danes ever received fresh accessions of strength, and  seemed to grow stronger and more numerous after every battle, while the  Saxons were dwindling rapidly. Wide tracts of country had been  devastated, the men slaughtered, and the women and children taken  captives, and the people, utterly dispirited and depressed, no longer  listened to the voices of their leaders, and refused again to peril  their lives in a strife which seemed hopeless. Alfred therefore called  his ealdormen together and proposed to them, that since the people  would no longer fight, the sole means that remained to escape  destruction was to offer to buy off the Danes.    The proposal was agreed to, for although none of them had any hope that  the Danes would long keep any treaty they might make, yet even a little  respite might give heart and spirit to the Saxons again. Accordingly  negotiations were entered into with the Danes, and these, in  consideration of a large money payment, agreed to retire from Wessex.  The money was paid, the Danes retired from Reading, which they had used  as their headquarters, and marched to London. King Burhred, the feeble  King of Mercia, could do nothing to oppose them, and he too agreed to  pay them a large annual tribute.    From the end of 872 till the autumn of 875 the country was  comparatively quiet. Alfred ruled it wisely, and tried to repair the  terrible damages the war had made. Edmund looked after his earldom, and  grew into a powerful young man of nineteen years old.    King Alfred had not deceived himself for a moment as to the future.  \"The Danes,\" he said, \"are still in England. East Anglia and  Northumbria swarm with them. Had this army, after being bought off by  us and my brother of Mercia, sailed across the seas and landed in  France there would have been some hope for us, but their restless  nature will not allow them to stay long in the parts which they have  conquered.    \"In Anglia King Guthrum has divided the land among his jarls, and there  they seem disposed to settle down; but elsewhere they care not for the  land, preferring to leave it in the hands of its former owners to till,  and after to wring from the cultivators the fruits of the harvest;  then, as the country becomes thoroughly impoverished, they must move  elsewhere. Mercia they can overrun whensoever they choose, and after  that there is nothing for them to do but to sweep down again upon  Wessex, and with all the rest of England at their feet it is hopeless  to think that we alone can withstand their united power.\"    \"Then what, think you, must be the end of this?\" Edmund asked.    \"'Tis difficult to see the end,\" Alfred replied. \"It would seem that  our only hope of release from them is that when they have utterly eaten  up and ravaged England they may turn their thoughts elsewhere. Already  they are harrying the northern coasts of France, but there are richer  prizes on the Mediterranean shores, and it may be that when England is  no longer worth plundering they may sail away to Spain and Italy. We  have acted foolishly in the way we have fought them. When they first  began to arrive upon our coasts we should have laboured hard to build  great fleets, so that we could go forth and meet them on the seas.    \"Some, indeed, might have escaped our watch and landed, but the fleets  could have cut off reinforcements coming to them, and thus those who  reached our shores could have been overwhelmed. Even now, I think that  something might be done that way, and I purpose to build a fleet which  may, when they again invade us, take its station near the mouth of the  Thames and fall upon the vessels bringing stores and reinforcements.  This would give much encouragement to the people, whose hopelessness  and desperation are caused principally by the fact that it seems to be  of no use killing the enemy, since so many are ready constantly to take  their places.\"    \"I will gladly undertake to build one ship,\" Edmund said. \"The fort is  now finished, and with the revenues of the land I could at once  commence a ship; and if the Danes give us time, when she is finished I  would build another. I will the more gladly do it, since it seems to me  that if the Danes entirely overrun our country we must take to the sea  and so in turn become plunderers. With this view I will have the ship  built large and strong, so that she may keep the sea in all weathers  and be my home if I am driven out of England. There must be plenty of  ports in France, and many a quiet nook and inlet round England, where  one can put in to refit when necessary, and we could pick up many a  prize of Danish ships returning laden with booty. With such a ship I  could carry a strong crew, and with my trusty Egbert and the best of my  fighting men we should be able to hold our own, even if attacked by two  or three of the Danish galleys.\"    \"The idea is a good one, Edmund,\" the king said, \"and I would that I  myself could carry it into effect. It were a thousand times better to  live a free life on the sea, even if certain at last to be overpowered  by a Danish fleet, than to lurk a hunted fugitive in the woods; but I  cannot do it. So long as I live I must remain among my people, ready to  snatch any chance that may offer of striking a blow against the  invader. But for you it is different.\"    \"I should not, of course, do it,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36764"],[0,"In the Track of the Bookworm (#10)"],[1,"and by fire,      And Germans like locusts devoured the land.    Doubtless the occupation of bookseller is generally regarded as a very  pleasant as well as a refined one. But there is another side, in the  estimation of a true Book-Worm, and it is not agreeable to him to  contemplate the life of      THE BOOK-SELLER.      He stands surrounded by rare tomes    Which find with him their transient homes,      He knows their fragrant covers;    He keeps them but a week or two,    Surrenders then their charming view      To bibliomaniac lovers.      An enviable man, you say,    To own such wares if but a day,      And handle, see and smell;    But all the time his spirit shrinks,    As wandering through his shop he thinks      He only keeps to sell.      The man who buys from him retains    His purchase long as life remains,      And then he doesn't mind    If his unbookish eager heirs,    Administering his affairs,      Shall throw them to the wind.      Or if in life he sells, in sooth,    'Tis parting with a single tooth,      A momentary pain;    Booksellers, like Sir Walter's Jew,    Must this keen suffering renew,      Again and yet again.      And so we need not envy him    Who sells us books, for stark and grim      Remains this torture deep.    This Universalistic hell--    Throughout this life he's bound to sell;      He has, but cannot keep.          XII.    THE PUBLIC LIBRARIAN.      There is one species of the Book-Worm which is more pitiable than the  Bookseller, and that is the Public Librarian, especially of a circulating  library. He is condemned to live among great collections of books and  exhibit them to the curious public, and to be debarred from any  proprietorship in them, even temporary. But the greater part this does not  grieve a true Book-Worm, for he would scorn ownership of a vast majority  of the books which he shows, but on the comparatively rare occasions when  he is called on to produce a real book (in the sense of Bibliomania), he  must be saddened by the reflection that it is not his own, and that the  inspection of it is demanded of him as a matter of right. I have often  observed the ill concealed reluctance with which the librarian complies  with such a request; how he looks at the demandant with a degree of  surprise, and then produces the key of the repository where the treasure  is kept under guard, and heaving a sigh delivers the volume with a  grudging hand. It was this characteristic which led me in my youth, before  I had been inducted into the delights of Bibliomania and had learned to  appreciate the feelings of a librarian, to define him as one who  conceives it to be his duty to prevent the public from seeing the books. I  owe a good old librarian an apology for having said this of him, and  hereby offer my excuses to one whose honorable name is recorded in the  Book of Life. Much is to be forgiven to the man who loves books, and yet  is doomed to deal out books that perish in the using, which no human being  would ever read a second time nor \"be found dead with.\" These are the true  tests of a good book, especially the last. Shelley died with a little  AEschylus on his person, which the cruel waves spared, and when Tennyson  fell asleep it was with a Shakespeare, open at \"Cymbeline.\" One may be  excused for reading a good deal that he never would re-read, but not for  owning it, nor for owning a good deal which he would feel ashamed to have  for his last earthly companion. But now for my tribute to      THE PUBLIC LIBRARIAN.      His books extend on every side,    And up and down the vistas wide        His eye can take them in;    He does not love these books at all,    Their usefulness in big and small        He counts as but a sin.      And all day long he stands to serve    The public with an aching nerve;        He views them with disdain--    The student with his huge round glasses,    The maiden fresh from high school classes,        With apathetic brain;      The sentimental woman lorn,    The farmer recent from his corn,        The boy who thirsts for fun,    The graybeard with a patent-right,    The pedagogue of school at night,        The fiction-gulping one.      They ask for histories, reports,    Accounts of turf and prize-ring sports,        The census of the nation;    Philosophy and science too,    The fresh romances not a few,        Also \"Degeneration.\"      \"They call these books!\" he said, and throws    Them down in careless heaps and rows        Before the ticket-holder;    He'd like to cast them at his head,    He wishes they might strike him dead,        And with the reader moulder.      But now as for the shrine of saint    He seeks a spot whence sweet and faint        A leathery smell exudes,    And there behind the gilded wires    For some loved rarity inquires        Which common gaze eludes.      He wishes Omar would return    That vulgar mob of books to burn,        While he, like Virgil's hero,    Would shoulder off this precious case    To some secluded private place        With temperature at zero.      And there in that Seraglio    Of books not kept for public show,        He'd feast his glowing eyes,    Forgetting that these beauties rare,    Morocco-clad and passing fair,        Are but the Sultan's prize.      But then a tantalizing sense    Invades expectancy intense,        And with extorted moan,    \"Unhappy man!\" he sighs, \"condemned    To show such treasure and to lend--        I keep, but cannot own!\"          XIII.    DOES BOOK COLLECTING PAY.      We now come to the sordid but serious consideration whether books are a  \"good investment\" in the financial sense. The mind of every true  Book-Worm should revolt from this question, for none except a bookseller  is pardonable for buying books with the design of selling them.  Booksellers are a necessary evil, as purveyors for the Book-Worm. I  regard them as the old woman regarded the thirty-nine articles of faith;  when inquired of by her bishop what she thought of them, she said, \"I  don't know as I've anything against them.\" So I don't know that I have  anything against booksellers, although I must concede that they generally  have something against me. As no well regulated man ever grudges expense  on the house that forms his home, or on its adornment, and rarely cares or  even reflects whether he can get his money back, so it is with the true  bibliomaniac. He never intends to part with his books any more than with  his homestead. Then again the use and enjoyment of books ought to count  for something like interest on the capital invested. Many times, directly  or indirectly, the use of a library is worth even more than the interest  on the outlay. It is singular how expenditure in books is regarded as an  extravagance by the business world. One may spend the price of a fine  library in fast or showy horses, or in travel, or in gluttony, or in stock  speculations eventuating on the wrong side of his ledger, and the  money-grubbing community think none the worse of him. But let him expend  annually a few thousands in books, and these sons of Mammon pull long  faces, wag their shallow heads, and sneeringly observe, \"screw loose  somewhere,\" \"never get half what he has paid for them,\" \"too much of a  Book-Worm to be a sharp business man.\" A man who boldly bets on stocks in  Wall Street is a gallant fellow, forsooth, and excites the admiration of  the business community (especially of those who thrive on his losses) even  when he \"comes out at the little end of the horn.\" As Ruskin observes, we  frequently hear of a bibliomaniac, never of a horse-maniac. It is said  there is a private stable in Syracuse, New York, which has cost several  hundred thousand dollars. The owner is regarded as perfectly sane and the  building is viewed with great pride by the public, but if the owner had  expended as much on a private library his neighbors would have thought him  a lunatic. If a man in business wants to excite the suspicion of the sleek  gentlemen who sit around the discount board with him, or yell like  lunatics at the stock exchange with him, or talk with him about the tariff  or free silver, or any other subject on which no two men ever agree unless  it is for their interest, let it leak out that he has put a few thousand  dollars into a Mazarine Bible, or a Caxton, or a first folio Shakespeare  or some other rare book. No matter if he can afford it, most of his  associates regard him as they do a Bedlamite who goes about collecting  straws. Fortunate is he if his wife does not privately call on the family  attorney and advise with him about putting a committee over the poor man.    But if we must regard book-buying in a money sense, and were to admit that  books never sell for as much as they cost, it is no worse in respect to  books than in respect to any other species of personal property. What  chattel is there for which the buyer can get as much as he paid, even the  next day? When it is proposed to transform the seller himself into the  buyer of the same article, we find that the bull of yesterday is converted  into the bear of to-day. Circumstances alter cases. I have bought a good  many books and \"objects of bigotry and virtue,\" and have sold some, and  the nearest I ever came to getting as much as I paid was in the case of a  rare print, the seller of which, after the lapse of several years,  solicited me to let him have it again, at exactly what I paid for it, in  order that he might sell it to some one else at an advance. I declined his  offer with profuse thanks, and keep the picture as a curiosity.    So I should say, as a rule, that books are not a good financial investment  in the business sense, and speaking of most books and most buyers. Give  a man the same experience in buying books that renders him expert in  buying other personal property, the mere gross objects of trade, and let  him set out with the purpose of accumulating a library that shall be a"]]]
