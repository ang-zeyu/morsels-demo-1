He afterwards  completed the great altar of San Donato, at Arezzo, the cost of which  was thirty thousand gold florins; besides many other works which remain  in Naples and in several cities of Tuscany. Andrea Pisano was his  associate, and probably also his disciple in Perugia, who, after  establishing himself in Florence, ornamented with statues the cathedral  and the church of San Giovanni in that city; and in twenty-two years  finished the great gate of bronze \"to which we are indebted for all that  is excellent, difficult, or beautiful in the other two, which are the  workmanship of succeeding artists.\" He was, in fact, the founder of that  great school that successively produced Orcagna, Donatello, and the  celebrated Ghiberti, who fabricated those gates for the same church,  which Michelagnolo pronounced worthy to form the entrance of Paradise.  After Andrea, we may notice Giovanni Balducci, of Pisa, whose era,  country, and style, all lead us to suppose him one of the same school.  He was an excellent artist, and was employed by Castruccio, Lord of  Lucca, and by Azzone Visconti, Prince of Milan; where he flourished, and  left, among other monuments of his art, the tomb of San Pietro Martire,  at S. Eustorgio, which is so highly praised by Torre, by Lattuada, and  by various other learned illustrators of Milanese antiquities.[35] Two  eminent artists, natives of Siena, proceeded from the school of Gio.  Pisano, namely, the two brothers, Agnolo and Agostino, who are greatly  commended by Vasari as improvers of the art. Whoever has seen the  sepulchre of Guido, bishop of Arezzo, which is decorated with an  infinity of statues and basso-relievos, representing passages of his  life, will not only find reason to admire in them the design, which was  the work of Giotto, but the execution of the sculpture. The brothers  also executed many of their own designs in Orvieto, in Siena, and in  Lombardy, where they brought up several pupils, who for a long period  pursued their manner, and diffused it over Italy.    To the improvement of sculpture succeeded that of mosaic, through the  efforts of another Tuscan, belonging to the order of minor friars, named  Fra Jacopo, or Fra Mino da Turrita, from a place in the territory of  Siena. It is not known whether he was instructed in his art by the  Romans or by the Greek workers in mosaic,[36] but it is well ascertained  that he very far surpassed them. On examining what remains of his works  in Santa Maria Maggiore at Rome, one can hardly be persuaded that it is  the production of so rude an age, did not history constrain us to  believe it. It appears probable that he took the ancients for his  models, and deduced his rules from the more chaste specimens of mosaic,  still remaining in several of the Roman churches, the design of which is  less crude, the attitudes less forced, and the composition more skilful,  than were exhibited by the Greeks who ornamented the church of San  Marco, at Venice. Mino surpassed them in every thing. From 1225, when he  executed, however feebly, the mosaic of the tribune of the church of San  Giovanni, at Florence, he was considered at the head of the living  artists in mosaic.[37] He merited this praise much more by his works at  Rome, and it appears that he long maintained his reputation. Vasari has  not been sufficiently just to the fame of Turrita, in noticing him only  casually in the life of Tafi, but the verses he recites, and the  commissions he mentions, demonstrate how greatly Turrita was esteemed by  his contemporaries. It is maintained that he was also a painter, but  this is a mistake which will be cleared up in the Sienese school, and  both there and elsewhere I shall question the authority of any author  who either greatly commends or underrates him.    From a deficiency of _specimens_, like those above recorded, painting  long remained in a more rude state than mosaic, and was very far behind  sculpture. But we must not imagine, that at the birth of Cimabue, in  1240, the race of artists was entirely extinct, as erroneously asserted  by Vasari: this must be deemed an exaggeration, for he himself has  recounted several sculptors, architects, and painters then living; and  the general scope of his less cautious expressions, against which so  many writers have inveighed, and still continue to declaim, favours this  opinion. I shall be constrained to advert, in almost every book, to  their accusations, and to produce the names of the artists who then  lived. I shall commence with those who then flourished in Tuscany. The  city of Pisa, at this time, had not only painters, but a school for each  of the fine arts[38]. The distinguished Signor Morrona, who has  illustrated the Pisan antiquities, deduces its origin immediately from  Greece. The Pisans, already very powerful by sea and land, having  resolved in 1063 to erect the vast fabric of their cathedral, had drawn  thither artists in miniature, and other painters, at the same time with  Buschetto the architect, and these men educated pupils for the city. The  Greeks at that time were but ill qualified to instruct, for they knew  little. Their first pupils in Pisa seem to have been a few anonymous  artists, some of whose miniatures and rude paintings are still in  existence. A parchment, containing the _exultet_, as usually sung on  Sabbato Santo, is in the cathedral, and we may here and there observe,  painted on it, figures in miniature, with plants and animals: it is a  relique of the early part of the twelfth century, yet a specimen of art  not altogether barbarous. There are likewise some other paintings of  that century in the same cathedral, containing figures of our Lady, with  the holy infant on her right arm: they are rude, but the progress of the  same school may be traced from them to the time of Giunta. This artist  lately received a fine eulogium, among other illustrious Pisans, from  Signor Tempesta, and he was fully entitled to it from the more early  historians. His country possesses none of his undoubted pictures, except  a crucifixion with his name, which is believed to be among his earliest  productions, a print from which may be found in the third volume of  _Pisa Illustrata_. He executed better pictures in Assisi, where he was  invited to paint by Frat' Elia di Cortona, superior of the Minori, about  the year 1230. From thence we are furnished with notices of his  education, which is thus described by P. Angeli, the Historian of that  cathedral: \"Juncta Pisanus ruditer a Graecis instructus, primus ex  Italis, artem apprehendit circa An. Sal. 1210.\" In the church of the  Angioli there is a better preserved work of the same master; it is a  crucifixion, painted on a wooden cross; on the lateral edges and upper  surface of which our Lady is represented, with two other half-length  figures, and underneath the remains of an inscription are legible, which  having copied on the spot, I do not hesitate to publish with its  deficiencies now supplied:      _Iv_nTA PISAnUS    _Ivn_TINI ME _Fecit_.    I supply _Juntini_, because Signor da Morrona asserts,[39] that about  this time, a _Giunta da Giuntino_ is mentioned in the records of Pisa,  whom by the aid of the _Assisi_ inscription, I conjecture to be the  painter we have now under notice. The figures are considerably less than  life; the design is dry, the fingers excessively long, but these are  _vitia non hominum sed temporum_; in short, this piece shews a knowledge  of the naked figure, an expression of pain in the heads, and a  disposition of the drapery, greatly superior to the efforts of the  Greeks, his contemporaries. The handling of his colours is strong,  although the flesh inclines to that of bronze; the local tints are  judiciously varied, the chiaroscuro even shews some art, and the whole  is not inferior, except in the proportions, to crucifixions with similar  half figures usually ascribed to Cimabue. He painted at Assisi another  crucifixion, which is now lost, to which may be added, a portrait of  Frat' Elia, with this inscription, \"_F. Helias fecit fieri. Jesu Christe  pie miserere precantis Heliae. Juncta Pisanus me pinxit, An. D. 1236.  Indit. IX._\" The inscription has been preserved by P. Wadingo in his  annals of the Franciscan order for that year, and the historian  describes the crucifixion as _affabre pictum_. The fresco works of  Giunta were executed in the great church of the Franciscans, and  according to Vasari he was there assisted by certain Greeks. Some busts  and history pieces still remain in the gallery and the contiguous  chapels, among which is the crucifixion of San Pietro, noticed in the  _Etruria Pittrice_. Some believe that those paintings have been here and  there injudiciously retouched, and this may serve to excuse the drawing,  which may have been altered in many places, but the feebleness of the  colouring cannot be denied. When they are compared with what Cimabue  executed there about forty years afterwards, it seems that Giunta was  not sufficiently forcible in this species of painting; perhaps he might  have improved, but he is not mentioned after 1235; and it is conjectured  that he died while yet a young man, at a distance from his native  country. I am induced to believe so from observing, that Giunta di  Giuntino is noticed in the records of Pisa, in the early part of that  century, but not afterwards; and that Cimabue was sent for to paint the  altar-piece and portrait of San Francesco of Pisa, about the year 1265,  before he went to Assisi. It is more likely that Giunta would have  executed this, had he returned home from that city, where he had seen  and perhaps painted the portrait of the Holy Father.[40]    From this school the art is believed to have spread in these early times  over all Tuscany, although it must not be forgotten that there were  miniature painters "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34501"],[0,"Wolf and Coyote Trapping: An Up-to-Date Wolf Hunter's Guide (#10)"],[1,"until they have lain so long that they  have become tainted, or ruined by mice and birds, so that both the  bounty and the fur are lost. Anyway that is the conclusion of many of  those who have practiced poisoning.    In many places where wolves and coyotes could be poisoned readily in  early days the method is not a success at present as the animals have  learned by experience to avoid the poisoned food. Strychnine is  usually employed and this very bitter drug has a way of spreading  through the bait, so that the wolf can sometimes detect it as soon as  the bait touches the tongue. In such cases, the drug is never  swallowed, but may be dropped on the spot or as is more often the  case, it may be carried a considerable distance away before it is  dropped. Again if the animal swallows the poisoned bait, it may be  some time before it dissolves in the wolfs stomach and the poison  begins to act, and if the wolf begins to feel the effects of the  drug, it may start off on a run. In either case it is not likely to  be found even if there is snow on the ground as the wind will soon  obliterate the tracks.    In the government pamphlet before mentioned, Mr. Bailey has the  following to say about poisoning:    \"Many wolves are killed by poisoning, and more would be so killed if  the methods followed were less crude. Strychnine is generally used  with nothing to disguise its intense bitterness, the powder being  either inserted in bits of meat or fat or merely spread on a fresh  carcass. In most cases the wolf gets a taste of the bitter drug and  rejects it, and if the dose is swallowed it may be too small to be  fatal or so large as to act as an emetic. An old and experienced wolf  will rarely touch bait poisoned in the ordinary way, but sometimes a  whole family of young may be killed at a carcass. Usually when wolves  are poisoned, they go so far before they die that if found at all it  is not until their skins are spoiled. To encourage poisoning, it must  be possible to secure the skins in good condition, or at least, to  find the animals after they are killed, so that the ranchman may have  the satisfaction of knowing that he has accomplished something toward  the protection of his stock.\"    \"In the use of poison it is of first importance to determine the  amount that will kill with certainty in the shortest possible time.  According to German and French authorities on toxicology, the  smallest dose of strychnine that will kill a 25 pound dog is  approximately one-fourth of a grain. Quadruple this for a 100 pound  wolf and we have 2 grains. Mr. B. R. Ross, of the Hudson's Bay  Company, found that this quantity would kill a wolf quickly.  Experiments by Prof. David E. Lantz, of the Biological Survey, would  indicate the best results from a still larger dose. One grain killed  a 21 pound dog in seventy-five minutes, while 2 grains killed a 40  pound dog in twenty-seven minutes, without acting as an emetic. For a  wolf, therefore, 4 grains of pure sulphate of strychnine would seem  to be a proper dose.\"    \"Tests on 40 pound dogs with 1 and 2 grains of cyanide of potassium  in capsules caused the dogs to vomit in about fourteen minutes, after  which they fully recovered. Other more deadly poisons can not be  safely handled, and strychnine is the only practicable poison that  can be recommended.\"    \"For wolves, place 4 grains of pulverized sulphate of strychnine in a  3 grain gelatin capsule, cap securely, and wipe off every trace of  the bitter drug. The capsules should be inserted in a piece of beef  suet the size of a walnut, and the cavity securely closed to keep out  moisture. The juice of fresh meat will dissolve the gelatin capsule,  hence only fat should be used. The necessary number of these poisoned  baits may be prepared and carried in a tin can or pail, but they  should not be touched with naked hands. Old gloves or forceps should  be used to handle them. The baits may be dropped from horseback along  a scented drag line made by dragging an old bone or piece of hide, or  may be placed on, around, or partly under any carcass on which the  wolves are feeding, or along trails followed by the wolves. Partial  concealment of the bait usually lessens the wolfs suspicion, while  some kind of scent near by or along the trail insures its attention.\"    \"The gelatin capsule will dissolve in about a minute in the juices of  the mouth or stomach. When the strychnine is taken on an empty  stomach it will sometimes kill in a very few minutes after the first  symptoms of poison, and dies five or six minutes later.\"    Although this is the method recommended by the U. S. Department of  Agriculture, it is our opinion that it would not be successful, for  it takes too long for the gelatin capsule to dissolve in the animal's  stomach, anyway that is the verdict of those who have tried the  method. Those who have followed poisoning of foxes and wolves, prefer  to place the poison in a small ball of tallow by making the tallow  cup-shaped when cold, putting the strychnine inside and closing the  opening by pressing the edges over it. None of the poison must be  allowed to touch the outside of the bait.    The most common method of using the poison is to have out a large  bait (the carcass of some animal that the wolves have killed is to be  preferred), and after the animals are visiting it the poisoned baits  are thrown about nearby. Any indications of the presence of man will  make the animals suspicious and they will hesitate to approach the  large bait but are very apt to pick up and swallow the small ones. We  believe that this is the most successful method of using poison, but  there are other methods recommended by woodsmen. Some place the  poison in the large bait but we think this is entirely wrong as the  wolf will taste the poison before it gets enough of the drug to cause  its death. One party in speaking of the conditions in Northern  Ontario, says:    \"I think the wolf-poisoning business is being overdone. How would  your readers like to find poisoned wolf bait within one hundred yards  of their door, and some all round their houses within a radius of 300  yards? This bait consists in many cases of, say, half a deer. I think  it is very wrong to allow strong, able-bodied men to pollute the  country, now in the spring of the year, with large pieces, or in many  cases, whole carcasses of deer. The wolf poisoner never stops to  think what the result will be to his neighbor's dogs or poultry and  cattle from their leaving large pieces of meat in an exposed position  when the snow goes off. In fact, the thing is being carried in this  part so far that neither fur-bearing animals nor fish will be  procurable at any cost in a short time.\"      [Illustration: Method of Preparing Poison Baits.]    \"As it is, the farmer's dogs have been suffering, and are nearly  extinct here. For the last few seasons it has been quite common to  see large quantities of dead fish round the lake after this poisoned  meat goes into the water. I understood that parties laying out poison  had to observe certain regulations, so that no person's property  would be endangered thereby, and if I am rightly informed, it must be  some person's duty to stop the nuisance. No doubt it is a good thing  to get rid of the wolves, but the poisoning ought to be prosecuted  far enough from settlements and from public roads that stock and  poultry will not be endangered by the bait.\"    It is advisable when using poison to leave no human odors on the bait  and to prevent so doing, some people prepare the baits without  touching them with the bare hands. A simpler method is to make up the  baits several days in advance and place them in a clean vessel, out  of reach of all animals, and where they will be exposed to the open  air. In this way, the human odor will pass away, and when they are  placed out for the wolves they should not be touched with the hands.    The poison should not be placed in a capsule as that is too  uncertain. There is very little danger of giving an overdose. The  writer has seen strychnine used in large doses, considerably more  than four grains, and the results were far better than when using  smaller doses.    Strychnine is to be had in crystals or in crushed or powdered form.  Both forms are equally deadly, but some poisoners claim that it will  act more rapidly when crushed. The following article on poisoning is  given by a Wyoming trapper:    \"I have used strychnine and it is a poor idea for a trapper to use it  as it destroys more fur than anything and also makes animals very shy  about taking bait. The best way is to put the strychnine in lard  which has no salt in it. I take some lard and put on my gloves or  mitts and go in the shade or early in the morning where it is almost  at the freezing point, so the lard will stay hard. I pinch it off in  one inch chunks, take it between my hands and roll it in round balls,  take a pocket knife or stick and drill a hole in it. Then fill it  with strychnine and close the opening up by mashing the lard over the  hole. Be careful not to get any strychnine on the outside as it has a  bitter taste and if he tastes it he is almost sure to spit it out.\"    \"Care must be taken not to touch the outside with the bare hands as  the first thing a coyote will do is to smell it and if there is much  human scent on it, he will not take it. I dip it in blood to kill  some of the human scent. I have known a coyote to travel half a mile  with a piece of strychnined meat in his mouth and then feeling it  work on him, drop it and trot on.\"    \"Now to show that it wastes furs and makes them wild, suppose it had  snowed, blowed or covered his track in some way; a skunk in passing  by and finding it, would get poisoned, which would be a loss of one  fur, or suppose it were a mink or something else, it would have been  the same. The chances are that the trapper would not have found it  until it was"]]]
