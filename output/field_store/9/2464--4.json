They raise their banner of a  butterfly's wing, emblazoned with _Vive la Bagatelle_, and march on to  the tournament of wit and beauty. They belong to France; their game is  the gambol of the exuberance of French genius. They are more than  witty, they are _spirituel_; and they have more than talent, they have  taste.    In a day of such rapid and facile printing as ours, this department of  literary labor was a necessity. Every man who has a conceit and can  write, may parade it before the world. In the mass of pleasant  common-place, what is _bizarre_ may supplant the symmetrically  beautiful. To seize therefore what every man saw, and with nimble  fingers to weave a transparent tissue of gorgeous words through which  every man's impressions of what he saw look large and graceful and  piquant--to sum up a vaudeville in a _bon mot_, and a ballet in a  voluptuous trope,--_voila! c'est fait_, you have the recipe of a  successful _feuilletoniste_. Hence, the influence of these writers,  upon _words_, has been remarkable. The French language, long so  precise, is now among the most dissolute of tongues. It reels through  the columns of a _feuilleton_, drunk and dim-eyed with expletives and  exaggerations and beatified adjectives, so that, fascinated with the  casket, you quite forget the jewel. The language of dramatic and  operatic criticism in Paris is now inexplicable to any one but an  _habitue_. If you should tell John Bull, who wishes to go to the  opera, that Alboni's singing is _pyramidale_, he would expect to see  the fair and fat contralto sharpened to a point at top,--but, I grant,  if you should call it \"jolly\" or \"stunning,\" he would entirely  comprehend that you meant to express your admiration in superlatives.    I must not longer gossip as these gay gossips do, these fanciful  _feuilletonistes_, nor seek more deeply to draw the outline of these  rainbow bubbles upon the stream of the time, whether it flow turbid or  transparent. One cannot live upon sugar and nutmeg, or even upon  allspice. But our friends are a literary phenomenon not to be omitted,  and if you love the Muses, you will not omit to snuff the azure  incense offered weekly by the _feuilletonistes_.    Jules Janin shall show us out of this article as he ushered us in. The  Great Mogul of the _Feuilleton_ had purchased a carriage whose luxury,  and taste of appointment, and perfection of footman, was unsurpassed  in the Champs Elysee. But the gods are jealous and the  _feuilletonistes_ have thus the highest authority for jealousy. So, on  one evening when the exquisite equipage awaited its master at the  grand opera, a crowd of lesser critical luminaries gathered around it,  and both reviled and envied the fortunate owner. While they were thus  engaged, the great critic came out of the opera house and saw his  contemporaries engaged in longing and envious remark. Now tact is the  sublimest secret of success--and smilingly Jules Janin advanced  cheerily, greeted his friends cordially, and piled into the carriage  all of them who lived in his neighborhood.    They naturally reserved the seat of honor for the owner, but this  great General seizing the most inimical of all the party who lived in  a quarter of the city farthest from his own home, pushed him into the  vacant seat, ordered his coachman to set him down first, and then  humming the finale of the opera, lighted a cigar and sauntered  leisurely down the street. It was like Jules Janin to make his own  marriage the subject of a _Feuilleton_. In his case the man and the  _feuilletoniste_ are the same.          ODE XX. OF ANACREON.    TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH OF MADAME DACIER FOR THE INTERNATIONAL  MAGAZINE,    BY MARY E. HEWITT.          Niobe, maddened by her woes, of yore.        The gods in pity turned to marble fair;      And wretched Progne, doomed for evermore,        Changed to a swallow wings the upper air.        But ah! would Love, whom I, enslaved, obey,        By his sweet power transform me, I would be      The mirror in thy hand, if thus, alway,        Thy gentle eyes would fondly turn on me.        Or, I would be the perfume that reveals        Its fragrance 'mid the tresses of thy hair;      Or, that soft veil which o'er thy bosom steals,        And jealous, hides the ivory treasure there.        Or I would be the robe that round thee flows,        The zone that circles thee with fond caress;      The rivulet that with thy beauty glows,        And to its breast enclasps thy loveliness.        Or I were blest those envied pearls to be        That closely thus thy swan-white neck entwine;      Or e'en to be the sandal, pressed by thee,        Were, for thy lover, destiny divine.          SWEDISH LANDSCAPES: BY HERR ANDERSEN.      In the last _International_ we gave some characteristic historical  sketches from Hans Christian Andersen's latest and most delightful  book, the _Pictures of Sweden_; but the inspiration of nature is more  powerful with him than that of history, and he is never so felicitous  as when painting the scenery of his native country, though he has  certainly indulged, to a greater extent than a sober taste can  approve, in that passion for the fantastic and visionary, which has  been but too visibly manifested in some of his later and slighter  works. Our readers, however, shall judge for themselves. The forests  of Sweden and its rivers give the most noticeable features to its  landscape. This is how they appeared to Andersen--the forest first:         \"We are a long way over the elv. We have left the       corn-fields behind, and have just come into the forest,       where we halt at that small inn which is ornamented over the       doors and windows with green branches for the midsummer       festival. The whole kitchen is hung round with branches of       birch and the berries of the mountain ash; the oat cakes       hang on long poles under the ceiling; the berries are       suspended above the head of the old woman who is just       scouring her brass kettle bright.         \"The tap-room, where the peasants sit and carouse, is just       as finely hung round with green. Midsummer raises its leafy       arbor every where, yet it is most flush in the forest which       extends for miles around. Our road goes for miles through       that forest, without seeing a house, or the possibility of       meeting travellers, driving, riding, or walking. Come! The       ostler puts fresh horses to the carriage; come with us into       the large woody desert: we have a regular trodden way to       travel, the air is clear, here is summer's warmth and the       fragrance of birch and lime. It is an up-and-downhill road,       always bending, and so, ever changing, but yet always       forest-scenery--the close, thick forest. We pass small       lakes, which lie so still and deep, as if they concealed       night and sleep under their dark, glassy surfaces.         \"We are now on a forest plain, where only charred stumps of       trees are to be seen; this long tract is black, burnt, and       deserted, not a bird flies over it. Tall, hanging birches       now greet us again; a squirrel springs playfully across the       road, and up into the tree; we cast our eyes searchingly       over the wood-grown mountain side, which slopes so far, far       forward, but not a trace of a house is to be seen: nowhere       does that bluish smoke-cloud rise, that shows us, here are       fellow-men. The sun shines warm; the flies dance around the       horses, settle on them, fly off again, and dance as though       it were to qualify themselves for resting and being still.       They perhaps think, 'Nothing is going on without us: there       is no life while we are doing nothing.' They think, as many       persons think, and do not remember that time's horses always       fly onward with us!         \"How solitary is it here! so delightfully solitary! one is       so entirely alone with God and one's self. As the sunlight       streams forth over the earth, and over the extensive       solitary forests, so does God's Spirit stream over and into       mankind; ideas and thoughts unfold themselves--endless,       inexhaustible, as He is--as the magnet which apportions its       powers to the steel, and itself loses nothing thereby. As       our journey through the forest scenery here along the       extended solitary road, so, travelling on the great high       road of thought, ideas pass through our head. Strange, rich       caravans pass by from the works of poets, from the home of       memory, strange and novel; for capricious fancy gives birth       to them at the moment. There comes a procession of pious       children with waving flags and joyous songs; there come       dancing Menades, the blood's wild Bacchantes. The sun pours       down hot in the open forest; it is as if the Southern summer       had laid itself up here to rest in Scandinavian forest       solitude, and sought itself out a glade where it might lie       in the sun's hot beams and sleep; hence this stillness as if       it were night. Not a bird is heard to twitter, not a pine       tree moves. Of what does the Southern summer dream here in       the North, amongst pines and fragrant birches?         \"In the writings of the olden time, from the classic soil of       the South, are sagas of mighty fairies, who, in the skins of       swans, flew towards the North, to the Hyperboreans' land, to       the east of the north winds; up there, in the deep still       lakes, they bathed themselves, and acquired a renewed form.       We are in the forest by these deep lakes; we see swans in       flocks fly over us, and swim upon the rapid elv and on the       still waters....\"         \"Woodland solitude! what images dost thou not present to our       thoughts!

On the fall of the Empire, caused by       the implacable perseverance of coalitions, the nation       remembered that the Hundred Days cost its government a       million an hour, and so long as the deficit was not made up,       their resentment underwent no diminution. But now if you       celebrate his glory before them, they will not display       hostility. You must not, however, touch the till of this       tribe of tradesmen, or they will be your bitter enemies. And       the proof that they are nothing but shopkeepers is that       their first functionary sits in a gilded arm chair on a       wool-sack.\"          THE BEAUTIFUL STREAMLET AND THE UTILITARIAN.      Alphonse Karr's new book, _Travels in my Garden_, is full of social  heresies, but quite as full of wit. We find in _Fraser's Magazine_ for  May translations of some admirable passages, with specimens of his  peculiar speculation. Karr is an ardent lover of Nature; he takes note  of all her caprices, and respects them,--remarks under what shade the  violet loves to dwell, and tells us how certain plants--the volubulis,  the scarlet-runner, and the Westeria, for instance--invariably twine  their spiral tendrils from left to right, whereas hops and  honeysuckles as infallibly twist theirs from right to left. He knows  which are the plants that fold, when evening comes, their leaves in  two, lengthwise,--which are those that close them up like fans, and  which are the careless ones that crumple them up irregularly with  happy impunity, for the next morning's sun smooths them all alike. He  loves Nature in all her details, but with disinterested love, and has  no idea of making her subservient to his pride, or selfishly  monopolizing her; he has evidently no wish to wall in woods and  meadows, and call them a park, or to dam up sparkling, bubbling,  dancing streams, and turn them into cold, spiritless, aristocratic  sheets of water. Indeed, in one of the first chapters of the book,  there is a fanciful bit of sentiment about a happy little stream that  falls into the hands of a pitiless utilitarian, which we are tempted  to quote:--         \"That stream which runs through my garden gushes from the       side of a furze-covered hill; for a long time it was a happy       little stream; it traversed meadows where all sorts of       lovely wild flowers bathed and mirrored themselves in its       waters, then it entered my garden, and there I was ready to       receive it; I had prepared green tanks for it; on its edge       and in its very bed I had planted those flowers which all       over the world love to bloom on the banks and in the bosom       of pure streams; it flowed through my garden, murmuring its       plaintive song; then, fragrant with my flowers, it left the       garden, crossed another meadow, and flung itself into the       sea, over the precipitous sides of the cliff, which it       covered with foam.         \"It was a happy stream; it had literally nothing to do       beyond what I have said,--to flow, to bubble, to look       limpid, to murmur, amidst flowers and sweet perfumes. It led       the life I have chosen, and that I continue to lead, when       people let me alone, and when knaves and fools and wicked       men do not force me--who am at once the most pacific and the       most battling man on earth--to return to the fight. But       heaven and earth are jealous of the happiness of gentle       indolence.         \"One day my brother Eugene, and Savage, the clever engineer,       were talking together on the banks of the stream, and to a       certain degree abusing it.         \"'There,' said my brother, 'is a fine good-for-nothing       stream for you, forsooth, winding and dawdling about,       dancing in the sunshine, and revelling in the grass instead       of working and paying for the place it takes up, as an       honest stream should. Could it not be made to grind coffee       or pepper?'         \"'Or tools?' added Savage.         \"'Or to saw boards?' said my brother.         \"I trembled for the stream, and broke off the conversation,       complaining loudly that its detractors (its would-be       tyrants) were treading down my forget-me-nots. Alas! it was       but against them alone I could protect it. Before long there       came into our neighborhood a man whom I noticed more than       once hanging about the spot where the stream empties itself       into the sea. The fellow I plainly saw was neither seeking       for rhymes, nor indulging in dreams and memories upon its       banks,--he was not lulling thought to rest with the gentle       murmur of its waters. 'My good friend,' he was saying to the       stream, 'there you are, idling and meandering about, singing       to your heart's content, while I am working and wearing       myself out. I don't see why you should not help me a bit;       you know nothing of the work to be done, but I'll soon show       you. You'll soon know how to set about it. You must find it       dull to stay in this way, doing nothing,--it would be a       change for you to make files or grind knives.' Very soon       wheels of all kinds were brought to the poor stream. From       that day forward it has worked and turned a great wheel,       which turns a little wheel, which turns a grindstone; it       still sings, but no longer the same gently-monotonous song       in its peaceful melancholy. Its song is loud and angry       now,--it leaps and froths and works now,--it grinds knives!       It still crosses the meadow, and my garden, and the next       meadow; but there, the man is on the watch for it, to make       it work. I have done the only thing I could do for it. I       have dug a new bed for it in my garden, so that it may idle       longer there, and leave me a little later; but for all that,       it must go at last and grind knives. Poor stream! thou didst       not sufficiently conceal thy happiness in obscurity,--thou       hast murmured too audibly thy gentle music.\"          SIR EMERSON TENNANT ON AMERICAN MISSIONS IN CEYLON.      One of the most respectable persons employed in the English colonial  service, is Sir EMERSON TENNANT, LL. D., K. C. B. &c., who was for  many years connected with the administration in Ceylon, and is now, we  believe, Governor of St. Helena. He has recently published a volume  entitled _Christianity in Ceylon_, in which there are some passages of  especial interest to American readers, displaying in a favorable  light, the services rendered to civilization by the missionaries of  this country. These parts of his work have attracted much  consideration. The _Dublin University Magazine_ remarks:    \"We describe the American Mission, which acts under the direction of  one of the oldest and most remarkable of the existing associations for  the dissemination of Christianity, \"The American Board of  Commissioners for Foreign Missions,\" whose head-quarters are at  Boston, in Massachusetts. The first settlers in Massachusetts, like  those of New England generally, were missionary colonists. Their  charter, given by Charles I., states that one of the objects of the  king and of the planters was the conversion of the natives to the true  faith; and the seal of the company thus incorporated bore the device  of a North American Indian, with the motto \"_Come over and help us_.\"  It may be interesting to add, that the \"pilgrim fathers\" of the New  England States were, indirectly, the cause of the Protestant missions  of the Dutch. They were, as our author states, 'the first pioneers of  the Protestant world, and the first heralds of the Reformed religion  to the heathen of foreign lands. Their mission is more ancient than  the Propaganda of Rome, and it preceded by nearly a century any other  missionary association in Europe. It was encouraged by Cromwell, and  incorporated by Charles II.; and Cotton Mather records that it was the  example of the New England fathers, and their success amongst the  Indians, that first aroused the energy of the Dutch for the conversion  of the natives of Ceylon.'    \"We cannot doubt that amongst the main causes of the prosperity of  North America are, the permanence of religious feeling, and the  blessing attendant on the fact, that the missionary spirit has never  perished. The labors of this great people on their own vast continent  have been conducted with the greatest judgment, and marked by a  success which encouraged their extension in other lands. In the year  1812, they turned their attention to the East, and, under an act of  incorporation from the state of Massachusetts, commenced their  missionary efforts in the Old World. Their first missionaries to India  appeared there in 1812, but were ordered by the Governor-General to  leave Calcutta by the same vessel in which they had arrived. One of  them landing in Ceylon, on his voyage home, was so struck with the  openings which it presented for missionary enterprise, and so much  encouraged by the Governor, Sir Robert Brownrigg, to engage in it,  that, on his representations, the American Board, in 1816, sent out  three clergymen and their wives, who fixed their residence at Jaffina,  which has been ever since the scene of their remarkable labors. These  were reinforced in 1829, and for many years their establishment has  consisted of from seven to eleven ordained ministers, with a  physician, conductors of the press, and other lay assistants; these  are selected from Congregationalists and Presbyterians. It is  gratifying to be enabled to add, that a most cordial good-will and  desire to co-operate has from the beginning prevailed between them and  the other Protestant missionaries in their neighborhood. For thirty  years they have assembled periodically in a \"missionary union,\" to  decide on measures and compare results. \"With all of them education  is,\" as our author says, \"a diurnal"]]]
