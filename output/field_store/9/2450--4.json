As the boy grows, we learn, that \"as he skulks about there, plundering,  pilfering, playing dog's-tricks, with his finger in every mischief, he  already gains character. Shrill housewives of the neighborhood, whose  sausages he has filched, whose weaker sons maltreated, name him Beppo  Maldetto, and indignantly prophecy that he will be hanged--a prediction  which the issue has signally falsified.\" We also may learn, what, in the  treatment of our whole subject it is extremely important to remember,  that, in the \"boy,\" a \"brazen impudence developes itself, the crowning  gift,\" &c. \"To his astonishment,\" though, \"he finds that even here he is  in a conditional world, and if he will employ his capability of eating  (or enjoying) must first, in some measure, work and suffer. Contention  enough hereupon; but now dimly arises, or reproduces itself, the  question. Whether there were not a _shorter_ road--that of stealing!\"    But how he was entered into the convent, and under the convent  apothecary proceeded to learn certain arts and mysteries of the retorts  and alembics (which lucky knowledge, after that, came to use), while he  was learning his other trade of monkery and mass-chanting, we will omit.  It is enough to know, that he would not answer for the convent, and was  again afloat on the wide sea of existence. That he floated is certain;  for \"he has a fair cousin living in the house with him, and she again  has a lover. Beppo stations himself as go-between; delivers letters;  fails not to drop hints that a lady to be won or kept must be generously  treated; that such and such a pair of ear-rings, watch, or sum of money,  would work wonders: which valuables, adds the wooden Roman biographer,  he then appropriated furtively.\" Slowly but certainly he makes his way:  \"tries his hand at forging\" theatre tickets--a will even, \"for the  benefit of a certain religious house;\" and, further on, can tell  fortunes, and show visions in a small way--all these inspirations are  vouchsafed him, or, rather, these things he is permitted to do, and  others not to be mentioned here.    It is well to note, that in all times, and among all peoples, there is a  deep and profound conviction that there _is_ not only a \"short and  certain\" way of getting to heaven, and to know the eternal truths, but  also that these earthly treasures do exist, in untold quantity, in the  elements; and if one could only discover the secret by which the gases  could be condensed into solid gold, or the gnomes be persuaded or  compelled to give them up, ready solidified to hand, it would at least  save time and be satisfactory. It is only curious, as a matter of  speculation, to know what we shall eat when the lucky age arrives, and  spirits will do our bidding in this matter of gold and diamonds. The  \"boy,\" as he grew, discovered this world-wide capacity; and who should  have this power of setting the \"spirits\" to work but he?    \"Walking one day in the fields with a certain ninny of a goldsmith,  named Marano, Beppo begins in his oily voluble way to hint that  treasures often lay hid; that a certain treasure lay hid there (as he  knew by some pricking of his thumbs, divining rod, or other talismanic  monition), which treasure might, by the aid of science, courage,  secrecy, and a small judicious advance of money, be fortunately lifted.  The gudgeon takes--advances, by degrees, to the length of 'sixty gold  ounces'--sees magic circles drawn in the wane or the full of the moon,  blue (phosphorous) flames arise--split twigs auspiciously quiver--and at  length demands, peremptorily, that the treasure be dug!\"    Alas! why is it that the \"spirits\" so often fail us at our sorest need?  Do _they_ deceive us; and, if not, who does? The treasure vanishes, or  does not appear, \"the conditions are imperfect,\" and the \"ninny of a  goldsmith\" being roughly handled by these spiritual visitants,  threatens to stiletto the adept; who, overcome with the ingratitude of  the world, concludes to quit;--at least, in the words of his Inquisition  biographer, \"he fled from Palermo, and overran the whole earth.\"    We may see how he has grown--how, as in ordinary mortals, he advances  step by step--even he, the favorite son of the higher intelligences,  learns as he goes. How is it, then, that we can have no full-grown  inspiration; that we know of no perfection--that we only go on towards  it? Can it be that prophets and priests really do _learn_, and that even  now, men may grow into the future? Might not a more thorough and  scientific seminary for this purpose be established than any we now  have--theologic, thaumaturgic, theosophic, or other variety? It is a  question easier asked than answered.    \"The Beppic Hegira brings us down in European history to somewhere about  the period of the peace of Paris\"--(A.D. ----), supervening upon which  is a portentous time--\"the multitudinous variety of quacks that, along  with Beppo, overran all Europe during that same period--the latter half  of the last century. It was the very age of impostors, cut-purses,  swindlers, double gaugers, enthusiasts, ambiguous persons, quacks  simple, quacks compound, crack-brained or with deceit prepense, quacks  and quackeries of all colors and kinds. How many mesmerists (so speaks  this strange author), magicians, cabalists, Swedenborgians, illuminati,  crucified nuns, and devils of Loudun! To which the Inquisition  biographer adds vampyres, sylphs, rosicrucians, free-masons, and an _et  cetera_. Consider your Schropfers, Cagliostros, Casanovas, Saint  Germains, Dr. Grahams, the Chevalier d'Eon, Psalmanazar, Abbe Paris, and  the Ghost of Cock-lane!--as if Bedlam had broken loose!\"    The great, the inexplicable, the mysterious Beppo, being now fairly  afloat, let us try to comprehend how he has begun to touch upon the edge  of those trade winds, which shall drive him along toward the golden  Indies, Ophir, and the land of promise, for which the men of this world  do so hunger and thirst.    He married a beautiful Seraphina, afterward countess, graceful and  lady-like, once the daughter of a girdle-maker, and named Lorenza  Feliciani. Every one, simple or sedate, knows that it is best to hunt in  couples. What one has not the other may have. So Seraphina had beauty,  lightness, buoyancy, and could float up her count when the demons and  harpies of a certain troublesome devil, called law or justice, seemed  bent upon his swift destruction. Could she not, too, \"enlist the  sympathies of admiring audiences\"--by her sweet smiles and \"artless  ways,\" gain belief, and \"a wish to believe?\" More than that, could she  not turn the heads of young and old? \"noble\" perhaps, perhaps  \"ignoble\"--\"moneyed do-nothings\" (so says this writer), whereof in this  vexed earth there are many, ever lounging about such (?) places--scan  and comment on the foreign coat-of-arms--ogle the fair foreign woman,  who timidly recoils from their gaze, timidly responds to their  reverences, as in halls and passages they obsequiously throw themselves  in her way. Ere long, one moneyed do-nothing (from amid his tags,  tassels, sword-belts, fop-tackle, frizzled hair, without brains beneath  it) is heard speaking to another--\"Seen the countess?--divine creature  that!\" Indeed, one cannot but wonder that any should question the unity  of the race, at least, of those known as \"civilized.\" In a small way, or  in a large way, how this thing ever goes on--on church steps, on  Broadways, in Metropolitan Halls, Congresses, the Palais-Royal, at home  and abroad! And men do yet call _this_ \"reverence for the sex,\" and holy  sentiment; and indulge in hallelujahs to that hoary myth, \"a gentleman  of the old school;\" while women--God help us--women loving it, hate  those who, hating it, hate hollowness and hell. With slight imagination,  then, one may see how important an element this \"divine creature\" must  have become in any conjuration or mystic \"renovation of the universe,\"  which the high mystagogue might be impressed to set on foot. Enough,  that _she_ helped and learned the arts of prophecy and perfection faster  than her master! But we read--alas! alas!--\"As his seraphic countess  gives signs of withering, and one luxuriant branch of industry will die  and drop off, others must be pushed into budding.\" He, the indefatigable  count, is not idle. \"Faded dames of quality (over all Europe, all  creation) have many wants: the count has not studied in the convent  laboratory, or pilgrimed to the Count St. Germain, in Westphalia, to no  purpose. With loftiest condescension he stoops to impart somewhat of his  supernatural secrets--for a _consideration_. Rowland's Kalydor is  valuable; but what to the beautifying water of Count Alessandro! He that  will undertake to smooth wrinkles, and make withered, green parchment  into a fair carnation skin, is he not one whom faded dames of quality  will delight to honor? Or, again, let the beautifying-water succeed or  not, have not such dames (if calumny may in aught be believed) another  want? This want, too, the indefatigable Cagliostro will supply--for a  consideration. For faded gentlemen of quality the count likewise has  help.

The public orders of Governor Phillip have invariably  tended to promote such a behaviour on our side, as was most likely  to produce this much wished-for event. To what cause then are we to  attribute the distance which the accomplishment of it appears at? I  answer, to the fickle, jealous, wavering disposition of the people we  have to deal with, who, like all other savages, are either too indolent,  too indifferent, or too fearful to form an attachment on easy terms,  with those who differ in habits and manners so widely from themselves.  Before I close the subject, I cannot, however, omit to relate the  following ludicrous adventure, which possibly may be of greater use in  effecting what we have so much at heart, than all our endeavours.    Some young gentlemen belonging to the Sirius one day met a native, an  old man, in the woods; he had a beard of considerable length, which his  new acquaintance gave him to understand, by signals, they would rid him  of, if he pleased; stroaking their chins, and shewing him the smoothness  of them at the same time; at length the old Indian consented, and one of  the youngsters taking a penknife from his pocket, and making use of the  best substitute for lather he could find, performed the operation with  great success, and, as it proved, much to the liking of the old man, who  in a few days after reposed a confidence in us, of which we had hitherto  known no example, by paddling along-side the Sirius in his canoe, and  pointing to his beard. Various arts were ineffectually tried to induce  him to enter the ship; but as he continued to decline the invitation,  a barber was sent down into the boat along-side the canoe, from whence,  leaning over the gunnel, he complied with the wish of the old beau, to  his infinite satisfaction. In addition to the consequences which our  sanguine hopes led us to expect from this dawning of cordiality, it  affords proof, that the beard is considered by this people more as an  incumbrance than a mark of dignity.          CHAPTER XII.      The Departure of the French from Botany Bay; and the Return of the  'Supply' from Norfolk Island; with a Discovery made by Lieutenant Ball  on his Passage to it.      About the middle of the month our good friends the French departed from  Botany Bay, in prosecution of their voyage. During their stay in that  port, the officers of the two nations had frequent opportunities of  testifying their mutual regard by visits, and every interchange of  friendship and esteem. These ships sailed from France, by order of  the King, on the 1st of August, 1785, under the command of Monsieur  De Perrouse, an officer whose eminent qualifications, we had reason  to think, entitle him to fill the highest stations. In England,  particularly, he ought long to be remembered with admiration and  gratitude, for the humanity which marked his conduct, when ordered to  destroy our settlement at Hudson's Bay, in the last war. His second  in command was the Chevalier Clonard, an officer also of distinguished  merit.    In the course of the voyage these ships had been so unfortunate as  to lose a boat, with many men and officers in her, off the west of  California; and afterwards met with an accident still more to be  regretted, at an island in the Pacific Ocean, discovered by Monsieur  Bougainville, in the latitude of 14 deg 19 min south, longitude 173 deg  3 min 20 sec east of Paris. Here they had the misfortune to have no less  than thirteen of their crews, among whom was the officer at that time  second in command, cut off by the natives, and many more desperately  wounded. To what cause this cruel event was to be attributed, they knew  not, as they were about to quit the island after having lived with the  Indians in the greatest harmony for several weeks; and exchanged, during  the time, their European commodities for the produce of the place, which  they describe as filled with a race of people remarkable for beauty and  comeliness; and abounding in refreshments of all kinds.    It was no less gratifying to an English ear, than honourable to Monsieur  De Perrouse, to witness the feeling manner in which he always mentioned  the name and talents of Captain Cook. That illustrious circumnavigator  had, he said, left nothing to those who might follow in his track to  describe, or fill up. As I found, in the course of conversation, that  the French ships had touched at the Sandwich Islands, I asked M. De  Perrouse what reception he had met with there. His answer deserves to be  known: \"During the whole of our voyage in the South Seas, the people of  the Sandwich Islands were the only Indians who never gave us cause of  complaint. They furnished us liberally with provisions, and administered  cheerfully to all our wants.\" It may not be improper to remark, that  Owhyee was not one of the islands visited by this gentleman.    In the short stay made by these ships at Botany Bay, an Abbe, one of  the naturalists on board, died, and was buried on the north shore. The  French had hardly departed, when the natives pulled down a small board,  which had been placed over the spot where the corpse was interred, and  defaced everything around. On being informed of it, the Governor sent  a party over with orders to affix a plate of copper on a tree near the  place, with the following inscription on it, which is a copy of what was  written on the board:         Hic jacet L. RECEVEUR,       E.F.F. minnibus Galliae, Sacerdos, Physicus, in       circumnavigatione mundi, Duce De La Perrouse.       Obiit die 17 Februarii, anno 1788.    This mark of respectful attention was more particularly due, from M. De  Perrouse having, when at Kamschatka, paid a similar tribute of gratitude  to the memory of Captain Clarke, whose tomb was found in nearly as  ruinous a state as that of the Abbe.    Like ourselves, the French found it necessary, more than once, to  chastise a spirit of rapine and intrusion which prevailed among the  Indians around the Bay. The menace of pointing a musquet to them was  frequently used; and in one or two instances it was fired off, though  without being attended with fatal consequences. Indeed the French  commandant, both from a regard to the orders of his Court as well as to  our quiet and security, shewed a moderation and forbearance on this head  highly becoming.    On the 20th of March, the 'Supply' arrived from Norfolk Island, after  having safely landed Lieutenant King and his little garrison. The  pine-trees growing there are described to be of a growth and height  superior, perhaps, to any in the world. But the difficulty of bringing  them away will not be easily surmounted, from the badness and danger of  the landing place. After the most exact search not a single plant of the  New Zealand flax could be found, though we had been taught to believe it  abounded there.    Lieutenant Ball, in returning to Port Jackson, touched at a small  island in latitude 31 deg 36 min south, longitude 159 deg 4 min east of  Greenwich, which he had been fortunate enough to discover on his passage  to Norfolk, and to which he gave the name of Lord Howe's Island. It  is entirely without inhabitants, or any traces of any having ever been  there. But it happily abounds in what will be infinitely more important  to the settlers on New South Wales: green turtle of the finest kind  frequent it in the summer season. Of this Mr. Ball gave us some very  handsome and acceptable specimens on his return. Besides turtle, the  island is well stocked with birds, many of them so tame as to be knocked  down by the seamen with sticks. At the distance of four leagues from  Lord Howe Island, and in latitude 31 deg 30 min south, longitude 159 deg  8 min east, stands a remarkable rock, of considerable height, to which  Mr. Ball gave the name of Ball's Pyramid, from the shape it bears.    While the 'Supply' was absent, Governor Phillip made an excursion to  Broken Bay, a few leagues to the northward of Port Jackson, in order to  explore it. As a harbour it almost equals the latter, but the adjacent  country was found so rocky and bare, as to preclude all possibility of  turning it to account. Some rivulets of fresh water fall into the head  of the Bay, forming a very picturesque scene. The Indians who live  on its banks are numerous, and behaved attentively in a variety of  instances while our people remained among them.          CHAPTER XIII.        Transactions at Port Jackson in the Months of April and May.      As winter was fast approaching, it became necessary to secure ourselves  in quarters, which might shield us from the cold we were taught to  expect in this hemisphere, though in so low a latitude. The erection  of barracks for the soldiers was projected, and the private men of  each company undertook to build for themselves two wooden houses, of  sixty-eight feet in length, and twenty-three in breadth. To forward the  design, several saw-pits were immediately set to work, and four ship  carpenters attached to the battalion, for the purpose of directing and  completing this necessary undertaking. In prosecuting it, however,  so many difficulties occurred, that we were fain to circumscribe our  original intention; and, instead of eight houses, content ourselves with  four. And even these, from the badness of the timber, the scarcity of  artificers, and other impediments, are, at the day on which I write, so  little advanced, that it will be well, if at the close of the year 1788,  we shall be established in them. In the meanwhile the married people,  by proceeding on a more contracted scale, were soon under comfortable  shelter. Nor were the convicts forgotten; and as leisure was frequently  afforded them for the purpose, little edifices quickly multiplied on"]]]
