[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25140"],[0,"Indian Story and Song, from North America (#10)"],[1,"   Our difficulty in hearing the music of the Indian is equalled by the  trouble he has with our instruments. His attention is engaged by the  mechanism. He hears the thud of the hammer, \"the drum inside\" the  piano, the twanging of the metal strings, and the abrupt, disconnected  tones. Until he is able to ignore these noises he cannot recognise the  most familiar tune. Even then, if his songs are played as an  unsupported aria, they are unsatisfactory to him. His ear misses  something it heard in the unison singing of his people, and which the  addition of a simple harmonic accompaniment supplies, making the  melody, as he says, \"sound natural.\" The discovery of the Indian's  preference in the rendition of his songs upon the piano led to many  experiments, in which Professor Fillmore took part, and that brought  to light many interesting facts. Among these facts may be mentioned  the complexity of rhythms, one played against the other; the  modulation implied in some of the melodies; the preference for a major  chord in closing a minor song; and the use of certain harmonic  relations which have been deemed peculiar to the modern romantic  school.    As these melodies are the spontaneous utterances of a people without  any theory of music or even a musical notation, they throw light upon  the structure, development, and freedom of natural expression in  music.          THE RELATION OF STORY AND SONG.      The rise of our music and poetry is lost in an irrevocable past; but,  as the operation of psychical laws is universal, it may be that some  of the influences that have been operative in the growth of these arts  can be discovered through the study of native American story and song,  born of a race living in a state of culture antecedent to that in  which our earliest literature and music flourished.    Within a generation diligent search has begun among some of the Indian  tribes, to ascertain, through a sympathetic study of rites,  ceremonies, and customs, what were the red man's ideals, what his  beliefs, and what his actual attainments. Already this labour is  bearing fruit. Scholars are recognising that the aboriginal conditions  on this continent throw light on the slow development of human society  and its institutions; and the time seems not distant when students of  man's culture will turn hither for evidence needed to fill gaps or to  explain phases in the development of art,--art in form, in colour, and  in melody,--for, it has been well said, America is the \"fossil bed\"  where are preserved stages of progress unrecorded in written history.    In Indian story and song we come upon a time where poetry is not yet  differentiated from story and story not yet set free from song. We  note that the song clasps the story as a part of its being, and the  story itself is not fully told without the cadence of the song. Yet in  even the most primitive examples a line of demarcation can be  discerned; and when this line has deepened, and differentiation has  begun, we are able to trace the formative influence exerted by story  upon song and by song upon story, and can observe what appear to be  the beginnings of musical and poetical structure.    The brevity of Indian songs at once arrests attention. They begin  without introduction, almost abruptly, breaking out upon us as though  surcharged. This peculiarity arises from the relation of the song to  the story. The story is always founded upon a dramatic circumstance,  in which at some point the emotion is forced to find a means of  expression beyond the limitation of words alone; and the song is the  result. This dramatic circumstance may be a danger confronted or  averted, a valorous deed achieved or a difficulty surmounted, a  religious experience or an ardent craving for supernatural aid. The  Omaha tribal prayer will serve as an illustration, where the cry to  Wa-ko_n_-da is the climatic voicing of the youth's desire in the midst  of his weary vigil and fasting. His long preparation for the rite, the  solitude of his surroundings, the suffering of mind and body as alone  he faces nature and the supernatural,--all these conditions make the  story, and, to the Indian, form the true setting of the song.    The motive of a song and its distinctive rhythm were determined by the  emotion evoked by the dramatic circumstance. The simplest resultant of  this directive emotion in music is a pulsating rhythm on a single  tone. Such songs are not random shoutings, but have a definite meaning  for those who sing and for those who listen, as in this Navaho ritual  song.    [Music]    From this extremely simple expression the growth of the musical motive  can be traced in these Indian songs through the use of two or more  tones up to the employment of the full complement of the octave.[12]    [Footnote 12: A careful analysis of hundreds of aboriginal songs,  gathered from the arctic seas to the tropics, shows that in every  instance the line taken by these tones is a chord-line where the tones  are harmonically related to each other. Out of these related tones the  untutored savage has built his simple melodies. The demonstration of  the interesting fact that \"the line of least resistance\" in music is a  harmonic line was made by my late associate, Professor John Comfort  Fillmore.]    [Music: A PRAYER FOR RAIN.    _Mexico. Tarahumare._    From DR. CARL LUMHOLTZ.]    [Music: SONG.    _British Columbia. Kwakiutl._    PROF. J.C. FILLMORE.]    The creation of that which we know as musical form seems also to be  due to the influence of story upon song. We have already noted how the  directive emotion started the distinctive rhythm and determined the  order of the related tones, and so constructed the motive or theme.  But neither the rhythm nor the simple motive could express the  _movement_ of the dramatic story: hence we find this expressed by the  repetition, modification, and variation of the motive, the growth of  the phrase, the formation of the clause, and the grouping of clauses  into a period,--in fact, the outline of the form upon which all our  culture music is built. Culture music, however, shows an intellectual  control of emotion, a power of musical thinking, the enlarging and  embellishing of musical form,--a form, nevertheless, which we find  outlined, more or less clearly, in the songs of the untutored red man.  The difference between these spontaneous Indian melodies and the  compositions of the modern masters would seem to be not one of kind,  but one of degree.    As these songs are from a race practically without musical  instruments,--for the drum and rattle were used only to accentuate  rhythm,--they are representative of the period when the human voice  was the sole means of musical expression,--a period which antedated  the invention of instruments by an immeasurable time. They prove,  therefore, that musical form was not developed, as has sometimes been  stated, by the use of instruments, but that it took its rise in a  mental necessity similar to that which gave structure to language.    The influence of song upon story is seen in the attempt to bend prose  to a poetic form.    Many Indian songs have no words at all, vocables only being used to  float the voice. On classifying these wordless songs, we discover that  those which are expressive of the gentle emotions have flowing,  breathing vocables, but, where warlike feelings dominate the song, the  vocables are aspirate and explosive. In this determinate use of  vocables we happen upon what seems to represent the most primitive  attempt yet discovered to give intellectual definition in verbal form  to an emotion voiced in rhythm and melody.    In songs where words are employed, we also find vocables which are in  accord with the spirit of the song, used to make the words conform to  the musical phrase. These vocables are either appended to the word or  else inserted between its syllables, to give length or added euphony.  We also note a desire for rhyming, since vocables similar in sound  frequently occur at the end of each musical phrase.    It would lead into too many details to present the various devices  discernible in this aboriginal material by which the Indian sought  euphony and measure. Nor can it be easily illustrated how words of  many different languages were bent by elisions or stretched by  vocables, that they might conform to the musical phrase. There is  abundant evidence that the ear, accustomed to the pleasure of the  rhythmic cadence of the song, was beginning to demand a corresponding  metrical use of words in expressing the poetic thought involved in the  dramatic story which gave birth to the music.    The art of poetry is here in its infancy, giving even less sign of its  future development than music, which had already acquired the outline  of that form which has since crystallised into the art of music.  Notwithstanding, we find that words were chosen for their descriptive  power, and that they were made rhythmical to fit the melody. Like the  swelling buds on the bare branch, which hint the approach of summer's  wealth, so these little vocables and rhythmic devices whisper the  coming of the poets."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2520"],[0,"The Man (#10)"],[1,"can make up their  minds.  I want to hear both sides, too!  If people are guilty, I want to  know the cause of their guilt.  If they are innocent, I want to know what  the circumstances can be which make innocence look like guilt.  In my own  daily life I may be in the way of just such judgments; and surely it is  only right that judgment should be just!'    Again she paused; there rose before her mind that conversation in the  churchyard when Harold had said that it was difficult for women to be  just.    Miss Rowly reflected too.  She was becoming convinced that in principle  the girl was right.  But the details were repugnant as ever to her;  concentrating her mind on the point where she felt the ground firm under  her, she made her objection:    'But, Stephen dear, there are so many cases that are sordid and painful!'    'The more need to know of sordid things; if sordidness plays so important  a part in the tragedy of their lives!'    'But there are cases which are not within a woman's province.  Cases that  touch sin . . . '    'What kind of sin do you mean?  Surely all wrong-doing is sin!'  The old  lady was embarrassed.  Not by the fact, for she had been for too many  years the mistress of a great household not to know something of the  subject on which she spoke, but that she had to speak of such a matter to  the young girl whom she so loved.    'The sin, my dear, of . . . of woman's wrong-doing . . . as woman . . .  of motherhood, without marriage!'  All Stephen's nature seemed to rise in  revolt.    'Why, Auntie,' she spoke out at once, 'you yourself show the want of the  very experience I look for!'    'How? what?' asked the old lady amazed and bristling.  Stephen took her  hand and held it affectionately as she spoke:    'You speak of a woman's wrong-doing, when surely it is a man's as well.  There does not seem to be blame for him who is the more guilty.  Only for  poor women! . . . And, Auntie dear, it is such poor women that I should  like to help . . . Not when it is too late, but before!  But how can I  help unless I know?  Good girls cannot tell me, and good women won't!  You  yourself, Auntie, didn't want to speak on the subject; even to me!'    'But, my dear child, these are not things for unmarried women.  I never  speak of them myself except with matrons.'  Stephen's answer flashed out  like a sword; and cut like one:    'And yet you are unmarried!  Oh, Auntie dear, I did not and I do not mean  to be offensive, or to hurt you in any way.  I know, dear, your goodness  and your kindness to all.  But you limit yourself to one side!'  The  elder lady interrupted:    'How do you mean? one side! which side?'    'The punishment side.  I want to know the cause of that which brings the  punishment.  There surely is some cross road in a girl's life where the  ways part.  I want to stand there if I can, with warning in one hand and  help in the other.  Oh! Auntie, Auntie, can't you see that my heart is in  this . . . These are our people; Daddy says they are to be my people; and  I want to know their lives right through; to understand their wants, and  their temptations, and their weakness.  Bad and good, whatever it be, I  must know it all; or I shall be working in the dark, and may injure or  crush where I had looked to help and raise.'    As she spoke she looked glorified.  The afternoon autumn sun shone full  through the great window and lighted her up till she looked like a  spirit.  Lighted her white diaphanous dress till it seemed to take shape  as an ethereal robe; lighted her red hair till it looked like a celestial  crown; lighted her great dark eyes till their black beauty became swept  in the tide of glory.    The heart of the old woman who loved her best heaved, and her bosom  swelled with pride.  Instinctively she spoke:    'Oh, you noble, beautiful creature!  Of course you are right, and your  way is God's way!'  With tears that rained down her furrowed cheeks, she  put her arms round the girl and kissed her fondly.  Still holding her in  her arms she gave her the gentle counsel which was the aftermath of her  moment of inspiration.    'But Stephen dear, do be careful!  Knowledge is a two-edged sword, and it  is apt to side with pride.  Remember what was the last temptation of the  serpent to Eve: \"Your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods,  knowing good and evil.\"'    'I shall be very careful,' she said gravely; and then added as if by an  afterthought, 'of course you understand that my motive is the acquisition  of knowledge?'    'Yes?' the answer was given interrogatively.    'Don't you think, dear, that Eve's object was not so much the acquisition  of knowledge as the gratification of curiosity.'    'That may be,' said the elder lady in a doubtful tone; 'but my dear, who  is to enlighten us as to which is which?  We are apt in such matters to  deceive ourselves.  The more we know, the better are we able to deceive  others; and the better we are able to deceive others the better we are  able to deceive ourselves.  As I tell you, dear, knowledge is two-edged  and needs extra carefulness in its use!'    'True!' said Stephen reflectively.  Long after her aunt had gone she sat  thinking.    * * * * *    Once again did Miss Rowly try to restrain Stephen from a project.  This  was when a little later she wished to go for a few days to the University  Mission House in the East end of London.  Ever since her visit to Oxford  she had kept up a correspondence with her mother's old friend.  It was  this lady's habit to spend a part of vacation in the Mission; and Stephen  had had much correspondence with her regarding the work.  At last she  wrote that if she might, she would like to come and see for herself.  The  answer was a cordial invitation, armed with which she asked her father to  allow her to go.  He at once assented.  He had been watching keenly the  development of her character, and had seen with pride and satisfaction  that as time went on she seemed to acquire greater resolution, larger  self-dependence.  She was becoming more and more of his ideal.  Without  losing any of her womanhood, she was beginning to look at things more  from a man's point of view than is usually done by, or possible to,  women.    When she returned at the end of a week she was full of new gravity.  After  a while this so far changed that her old lighter moods began to have  their place, but it seemed that she never lost, and that she never would  lose, the effect of that week of bitter experience amongst the 'submerged  tenth.'    The effect of the mental working was shown by a remark made by Harold  when home on his next college vacation.  He had been entering with her on  a discussion of an episode on the estate:    'Stephen, you are learning to be just!'    At the moment she was chagrined by the remark, though she accepted it in  silence; but later, when she had thought the matter over, she took from  it infinite pleasure.  This was indeed to share man's ideas and to think  with the workings of man's mind.  It encouraged her to further and larger  ideas, and to a greater toleration than she had hitherto dreamed of.    Of all those who loved her, none seemed to understand so fully as  Laetitia Rowly the change in her mental attitude, or rather the  development of it.  Now and again she tried to deflect or modify certain  coming forces, so that the educational process in which she had always  had a part would continue in the right direction.  But she generally  found that the girl had been over the ground so thoroughly that she was  able to defend her position.  Once, when she had ventured to remonstrate  with her regarding her attitude of woman's equality with man, she felt as  if Stephen's barque was indeed entering on dangerous seas.  The occasion  had arisen thus: Stephen had been what her aunt had stigmatised as  'laying down the law' with regard to the position a married woman, and  Miss Rowly, seeing a good argumentative opening, remarked:    'But what if a woman does not get the opportunity of being married?'  Stephen looked at her a moment before saying with conviction:    'It is a woman's fault if she does not get the opportunity!'  The old  lady smiled as she answered:    'Her fault?  My dear, what if no man asks her?'  This seemed to her own  mind a poser.    'Still her own fault!  Why doesn't she ask him?'  Her aunt's lorgnon was  dropped in horrified amazement.    Stephen went on impassively.    'Certainly!  Why shouldn't she?  Marriage is a union.  As it is in the  eye of the law a civil contract, either party to it should be at liberty  to originate the matter.  If a woman is not free to think of a man in all  ways, how is she to judge of the suitability of their union?  And if she  is free in theory, why not free to undertake if necessary the initiative  in a matter so momentous to herself?'  The old lady actually groaned and  wrung her hands; she was horrified at such sentiments.  They were daring  enough to think; but to put them in words! . . .    'Oh, my dear, my dear!' she moaned, 'be careful what you say.  Some one  might hear you who would not understand, as I do, that you are talking  theory.'  Stephen's habit of thought stood to her here.  She saw that her  aunt was distressed, and as she did not wish to pain her unduly, was  willing to divert the immediate channel of her fear.  She took the hand  which lay in her lap and held it firmly whilst she smiled in the loving  old eyes.    'Of course, Auntie dear, it is theory.  But still it is a theory which I  hold very strongly!' . . . Here a thought struck her and she said  suddenly:    'Did you ever . . . How many proposals did you have, Auntie?'  The old  lady smiled; her thoughts were already diverted.    'Several, my dear!  It is so long ago that I don't remember!'    'Oh yes, you do, Auntie!  No woman ever forgets that, no matter what else  she may or may not remember!  Tell me, won't you?'  The old lady"]]]
