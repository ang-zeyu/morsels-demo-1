And must we be deprived of these Charms,  without knowing the Reason why? Oh! I understand you: I ought not to ask  the Masters, but the Audience, those capricious Protectors of the  _Mode_, that cannot endure this; and herein lies my Mistake. Alas! the  _Mode_ and the Multitude flow like Torrents, which, when at their  Height, having spent their Violence, quickly disappear. The Mischief is  in the Spring itself; the Fault is in the Singers. They praise the  _Pathetick_, yet sing the _Allegro_. He must want common Sense that does  not see through them. They know the first to be the most Excellent, but  they lay it aside, knowing it to be the most difficult.    Sec. 22. In former times divers _Airs_ were heard in the Theatre in this  delightful Manner, preceded and accompanied with harmonious and  well-modulated Instruments, that ravished the Senses of those who  comprehended the Contrivance and the Melody; and if sung by one of those  five or six eminent Persons abovementioned, it was then impossible for a  human Soul, not to melt into Tenderness and Tears from the violent  Motion of the Affections. Oh! powerful Proof to confound the idoliz'd  _Mode_! Are there in these Times any, who are moved with Tenderness, or  Sorrow?----No, (say all the Auditors) no; for, the continual singing of  the _Moderns_ in the _Allegro_ Stile, though when in Perfection That  deserves Admiration, yet touches very slightly one that hath a delicate  Ear. The Taste of the _Ancients_ was a Mixture of the _Lively_ and the  _Cantabile_ the Variety of which could not fail giving Delight; but the  _Moderns_ are so pre-possessed with Taste in _Mode_, that, rather than  comply with the former, they are contented to lose the greatest Part of  its Beauty. The Study of the _Pathetick_ was the Darling of the former;  and Application to the most difficult Divisions is the only Drift of the  latter. _Those_ perform'd with more Judgment; and _These_ execute with  greater Boldness. But since I have presum'd to compare the most  celebrated Singers in both Stiles, pardon me if I conclude with saying,  that the _Moderns_ are arrived at the highest Degree of Perfection in  singing to the _Ear_; and that the _Ancients_ are inimitable in singing  to the _Heart_.    Sec. 23. However, it ought not to be denied, but that the best Singers of  these times have in some Particulars refined the preceding Taste, with  some Productions worthy to be imitated; and as an evident Mark of  Esteem, we must publicly own, that if they were but a little more  Friends to the _Pathetick_ and the _Expressive_, and a little less to  the _Divisions_, they might boast of having brought the Art to the  highest Degree of Perfection.    Sec. 24. It may also possibly be, that the extravagant Ideas in the present  Compositions, have deprived the abovementioned Singers of the  Opportunity of shewing their Ability in the _Cantabile_; in as much as  the _Airs_ at present in vogue go Whip and Spur with such violent  Motions, as take away their Breath, far from giving them an Opportunity  of shewing the Exquisiteness of their Taste. But, good God! since there  are so many _modern_ Composers, among whom are some of Genius equal, and  perhaps greater than the best _Ancients_, for what Reason or Motive do  they always exclude from their Compositions, the so-much-longed-for  _Adagio_? Can its gentle Nature ever be guilty of a Crime? If it cannot  gallop with the _Airs_ that are always running Post, why not reserve it  for those that require Repose, or at least for a compassionate one,  which is to assist an unfortunate Hero, when he is to shed Tears, or die  on the Stage?----No, Sir, No; the grand _Mode_ demands that he be quick,  and ready to burst himself in his Lamentations, and weep with  Liveliness. But what can one say? The Resentment of the _modern_ Taste  is not appeased with the Sacrifice of the _Pathetick_ and the _Adagio_  only, two inseparable Friends, but goes so far, as to prescribe those  _Airs_, as Confederates, that have not the _Sharp_ third. Can any thing  be more absurd? _Gentlemen Composers_, (I do not speak to the eminent,  but with all due Respect) Musick in my Time has chang'd its Stile three  times: The first which pleased on the Stage, and in the Chamber, was  that of _Pier. Simone_[69], and of _Stradella_[70]; the second is of  the best that now living[71]; and I leave others to judge whether they  are _Modern_. But of your Stile, which is not quite established yet in  _Italy_, and which has yet gained no Credit at all beyond the _Alps_,  those that come after us will soon give their Opinion; for _Modes_ last  not long. But if the Profession is to continue, and end with the World,  either you yourselves will see your Mistake, or your Successors will  reform it. Wou'd you know how? By banishing the Abuses, and recalling  the first, second, and third _Mood_[72], to relieve the fifth, sixth,  and eighth, which are quite jaded. They will revive the fourth and  seventh now dead to you, and buried in Churches, for the final Closes.  To oblige the Taste of the Singers and the Hearers, the _Allegro_ will  now and then be mixed with the _Pathetick_. The _Airs_ will not always  be drowned with the Indiscretion of the Instruments, that hide the  artful Delicacy of the _Piano_, and the soft Voices, nay, even all  Voices which will not bawl: They will no longer bear being teased with  _Unisons_[73], the Invention of Ignorance, to hide from the Vulgar the  Insufficiency and Inability of many Men and Women Singers: They will  recover the instrumental Harmony now lost: They will compose more for  the Voice than the Instruments: The part for the Voice will no more have  the Mortification to resign its Place to the Violins: The _Soprano's_  and _Contr'Alto's_ will no more sing the _Airs_ in the Manner of the  Bass, in Spight of a thousand _Octaves_: And, finally, their _Airs_ will  be more affecting, and less alike; more studied, and less painful to the  Singer; and so much the more grand, as they are remote from the Vulgar.  But, methinks, I hear it said, that the theatrical Licence is great,  and that the _Mode_ pleases, and that I grow too bold. And may I not  reply, that the Abuse is greater, that the Invention is pernicious, and  that my Opinion is not singular. Am I the only Professor who knows that  the best Compositions are the Cause of singing well, and the worst very  prejudicial? Have we not more than once heard that the Quality of the  Compositions has been capable, with a few Songs, of establishing the  Reputation of a middling Singer, and destroying That of one who had  acquired one by Merit? That Musick, which is composed by one of Judgment  and Taste, instructs the Scholar, perfects the Skilful, and delights the  Hearer. But since we have opened the Ball, let us dance.    Sec. 25. He that first introduced Musick on the Stage, probably thought to  lead her to a Triumph, and raise her to a Throne. But who would ever  have imagined, that in the short Course of a few Years, she should be  reduced to the fatal Circumstance of seeing her own Tragedy? Ye pompous  Fabricks of the Theatres! We should look upon you with Horror, being  raised from the Ruins of Harmony: You are the Origin of the Abuses, and  of the Errors: From You is derived the _modern_ Stile and the Multitude  of Ballad-makers: You are the only Occasion of the Scarcity of judicious  and well-grounded Professors, who justly deserve the Title of  Chapel-Master[74]; since the poor Counterpoint[75] has been condemned,  in this corrupted Age, to beg for a Piece of Bread in Churches, whilst  the Ignorance of many exults on the Stage, the most part of the  Composers have been prompted from Avarice, or Indigence, to abandon in  such Manner the true Study, that one may foresee (if not succoured by  those few, that still gloriously sustain its dearest Precepts) Musick,  after having lost the Name of Science, and a Companion of Philosophy,  will run the Risque of being reputed unworthy to enter into the sacred  Temples, from the Scandal given there, by their Jiggs, Minuets, and  Furlana's[76]; and, in fact, where the Taste is so deprav'd, what would  make the Difference between the Church-Musick, and the Theatrical, if  Money was received at the Church Doors?    Sec. 26. I know that the World honours with just Applause some, tho' few  Masters, intelligent in both Stiles, to whom I direct the Students in  order to their singing well; and if I confine the Masters to so small a  Number, I do beg Pardon of those who should be comprehended therein;  hoping easily to obtain it, because an involuntary Error does not  offend, and an eminent Person knows no other Envy but virtuous  Emulation. As for the Ignorant, who for the most part are not used to  indulge any, but rather despise and hate every thing they do not  comprehend, they will be the Persons from whom I am to expect no  Quarter.    Sec. 27. To my Misfortune, I asked one of this sort, from whom he had  learned the _Counterpoint_? he answered immediately from the Instrument,  (_i.e._, the Harpsichord)--Very well. I asked farther, in what _Tone_  have you composed the Introduction of your Opera?----What _Tone_! what  _Tone_! (breaking in upon me abruptly) with what musty Questions are you  going to disturb my Brains? One may easily perceive from what School  you come. The _Moderns_, if you do not know it, acknowledge no other  _Tone_ but one[77]; they laugh, with Reason, at the silly Opinion of  those who imagine there are two, as well as at those who maintain, that  their being divided into _Authentick_ and _Plagal_, they become Eight,  (and more if there were need) and prudently leave it to everybody's  Pleasure to compose as they like best. The World in your Time was  asleep, and let "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2649"],[0,"Captains of the Civil War: A Chronicle of the Blue and the Gray (#10)"],[1,"were also lacking in the naval North at the time  the war began. But the small regular navy was invincible against  next to none; and it enjoyed many means of expansion denied to  the South.    On the outbreak of hostilities the United States Navy had ninety  ships and about nine thousand men--all ranks and ratings (with  marines) included. The age of steam had come. But fifty vessels  had no steam at all. Of the rest one was on the Lakes, five were  quite unserviceable, and thirty-four were scattered about the world  without the slightest thought of how to mobilize a fleet at home.  The age of ironclads had begun already overseas. But in his report  to Congress on July 4, 1861, Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy,  only made some wholly non-committal observations in ponderous  \"officialese.\" In August he appointed a committee which began its  report in September with the sage remark that \"Opinions differ  amongst naval and scientific men as to the policy of adopting the  iron armament for ships-of-war.\" In December Welles transmitted this  report to Congress with the still sager remark that \"The subject  of iron armature for ships is one of great general interest, not  only to the navy and country, but is engaging the attention of the  civilized world.\" Such was the higher administrative preparation  for the ironclad battle of the following year.    It was the same in everything. The people had taken no interest in  the navy and Congress had faithfully represented them by denying  the service all chance of preparing for war till after war had  broken out. Then there was the usual hurry and horrible waste.  Fortunately for all concerned, Gideon Welles, after vainly groping  about the administrative maze for the first five months, called  Gustavus V. Fox to his assistance. Fox had been a naval officer of  exceptional promise, who had left the service to go into business,  who had a natural turn for administration, and who now made an  almost ideal Assistant Secretary of the Navy. He was, indeed, far  more than this; for, in most essentials, he acted throughout the  war as a regular Chief of Staff.    One of the greatest troubles was the glut of senior officers who  were too old and the alarming dearth of juniors fit for immediate  work afloat. It was only after the disaster at Bull Run that Congress  authorized the formation of a Promotion Board to see what could be  done to clear the active list and make it really a list of officers  fit for active service. Up to this time there had been no system  of retiring men for inefficiency or age. An officer who did not  retire of his own accord simply went on rising automatically till  he died. The president of this board had himself turned sixty.  But he was the thoroughly efficient David Glasgow Farragut, a man  who was to do greater things afloat than even Fox could do ashore.  How badly active officers were wanted may be inferred from the  fact that before the appointment of Farragut's promotion board  the total number of regular officers remaining in the navy was  only 1457. Intensive training was tried at the Naval Academy. Yet  7500 volunteer officers had to be used before the war was over.  These came mostly from the merchant service and were generally  brave, capable, first-rate men. But a nautical is not the same as  a naval training; and the dearth of good professional naval officers  was felt to the end. The number of enlisted seamen authorized by  Congress rose from 7600 to 51,500. But the very greatest difficulty  was found in \"keeping up to strength,\" even with the most lavish  use of bounties.    The number of vessels in the navy kept on growing all through.  Of course not nearly all of them were regular men-of-war or even  fighting craft \"fit to go foreign.\" At the end of the first year  there were 264 in commission; at the end of the second, 427; at  the end of the third, 588; and at the end of the fourth, 671.    Bearing this in mind, and remembering the many other Northern odds,  one might easily imagine that the Southern armies fought only with  the courage of despair. Yet such was not the case. This was no  ordinary war, to be ended by a treaty in which compromise would  play its part. There could be only two alternatives: either the  South would win her independence or the North would have to beat  her into complete submission. Under the circumstances the united  South would win whenever the divided North thought that complete  subjugation would cost more than it was worth. The great aim of  the South was, therefore, not to conquer the North but simply to  sicken the North of trying to conquer her. \"Let us alone and we'll  let you alone\" was her insinuating argument; and this, as she knew  very well, was echoed by many people in the North. Thus, as regards  her own objective, she began with hopes that the Northern peace  party never quite let die.    Then, so far as her patriotic feelings were concerned, the South  was not fighting for any one point at issue--not even for slavery,  because only a small minority held slaves--but for her whole way  of life, which, rightly or wrongly, she wanted to live in her own  Southern way; and she passionately resented the invasion of her  soil. This gave her army a very high morale, which, in its turn,  inclined her soldiers the better to appreciate their real or imagined  advantages over the Northern hosts. First, they and their enemies  both knew that they enjoyed the three real advantages of fighting  at home under magnificent leaders and with interior lines. Robert  Lee and Stonewall Jackson stood head and shoulders above any Northern  leaders till Grant and Sherman rose to greatness during the latter  half of the war. Lee himself was never surpassed; and he, like  Jackson and several more, made the best use of home surroundings  and of interior lines. Anybody can appreciate the prime advantage of  interior lines by imagining two armies of equal strength operating  against each other under perfectly equal conditions except that one  has to move round the circumference of a circle while the other  moves to meet it along the shorter lines inside. The army moving  round the circumference is said to be operating on exterior lines,  while the army moving from point to point of the circumference  by the straighter, and therefore shorter, lines inside is said  to be operating on interior lines. In more homely language the  straight road beats the crooked one. In plain slang, it's best to  have the inside track.    Of course there is a reverse to all this. If the roads, rails,  and waterways are better around the circle than inside it, then  the odds may be turned the other way; and this happens most often  when the forces on the exterior lines are the better provided with  sea-power. Again, if the exterior forces are so much stronger than  the interior forces that these latter dare not leave any strategic  point open in case the enemy breaks through, then it is evident  that the interior forces will suffer all the disadvantages of being  surrounded, divided, worn out, and defeated.    This happened at last to the South, and was one of the four advantages  she lost. Another was the hope of foreign intervention, which died  hard in Southern hearts, but which was already moribund halfway  through the war. A third was the hope of dissension in the North,  a hope which often ran high till Lincoln's reëlection in November,  '64, and one which only died out completely with the surrender of  Lee. The fourth was the unfounded belief that Southerners were  the better fighting men. They certainly had an advantage at first  in having a larger proportion of men accustomed to horses and arms  and inured to life in the open. But, other things being equal, there  was nothing to choose between the two sides, so far as natural  fighting values were concerned.    Practically all the Southern \"military males\" passed into the ranks;  and a military male eventually meant any one who could march to  the front or do non-combatant service with an army, from boys in  their teens to men in their sixties. Conscription came after one  year; and with very few exemptions, such as the clergy, Quakers,  many doctors, newspaper editors, and \"indispensable\" civil servants.  Lee used to express his regret that all the greatest strategists  were tied to their editorial chairs. But sterner feelings were  aroused against that recalcitrant State Governor, Joseph Brown  of Georgia, who declared eight thousand of his civil servants to  be totally exempt. From first to last, conscripts and volunteers,  nearly a million men were enrolled: equaling one-fifth of the entire  war-party white population of the seceding States.    All branches of the service suffered from a constant lack of arms  and munitions. As with the ships for the navy so with munitions  for the army, the South did not exploit the European markets while  her ports were still half open and her credit good, Jefferson Davis  was spotlessly honest, an able bureaucrat, and full of undying zeal.  But, though an old West Pointer, he was neither a foresightful  organizer nor fit to exercise any of the executive power which he  held as the constitutional commander-in-chief by land and sea. He  ordered rifles by the thousand instead of by the hundred thousand;  and he actually told his Cabinet that if he could only take one  wing while Lee took the other they would surely beat the North.  Worse still, he and his politicians kept the commissariat under  civilian orders and full of civilian interference, even at the  front, which, in this respect, was always a house divided against  itself.      The little regular army of '61, only sixteen thousand strong, stood  by the Union almost to a man; though a quarter of the officers  went over to the South. Yet the enlisted man was despised even  by the common loafers who would not fight if they could help it.  \"Why don't you come in?\" asked a"]]]
