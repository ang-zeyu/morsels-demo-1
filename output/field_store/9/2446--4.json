The failure of the adult female to conceive was probably a  result of captivity and handling, although this needs confirmation  through additional studies. Nevertheless, an early winter release might  be favored by deep snows hindering travel. Furthermore, by breeding  season in late February the wolves might already have settled into an  area. Then the entire breeding cycle might take place outside captivity  and stand a better chance of succeeding.                                         CONCLUSIONS      Three principal conclusions can be drawn from the results of this  experiment: (1) It is possible to transplant a pack of wild wolves into  a new range. That new range, however, must be large enough to permit  some initial wandering. The animals cannot be expected to establish a  home range centered on or even including the point of release. (2) The  habitat in Upper Michigan apparently is adequate to support wolves, in  terms of food and cover, for the carcasses of the two experimental  wolves that could be examined intact had maintained or improved their  condition during their 6-to-8-month residence in Michigan. (3) The  reason for the failure of the experimental wolves to re-establish  themselves was direct mortality by human beings, just as Hendrickson et  al. (1975) concluded was the case for the failure of native and  immigrant Michigan wolves to re-establish a population. This mortality  probably is related to two factors, negative human attitudes toward  wolves and accessibility of humans to wolf range.    We are convinced that, ecologically, wolves can be re-established in  Upper Michigan. However, a successful program of re-establishment will  require the following:    1. A survey of public attitudes in Upper Michigan toward re-establishing  wolves,    2. An intensive public relations campaign to promote an understanding of  wolf ecology and the benefits of a wolf population,    3. Suspension or removal of the bounty on coyotes,    4. Releases of additional wolves in larger numbers perhaps over a period  of a few years, if public attitudes appear favorable,    5. A concentrated effort to inform the public of the penalties for  killing wolves,    6. A concerted law enforcement program, and    7. Monitoring of translocated animals through radio-tracking to  determine the results.    [Illustration:]       ___________________________________    |                                   |    |  =F. E.

We must be careful not to mistake cause  and accompaniment in our endeavor to explain differences in structure.    Let us see what we have learned and how to interpret it:--    That the woodpecker's bill is a combination of drill and pick-axe.    That the shape varies with the use to which it is most commonly put.    That the use varies with the food principally eaten; or, what is a step  farther back, that the different kinds of food must be sought in  different places and by different methods, and therefore require  different tools.    Therefore the shape of the woodpecker's bill has a direct relation to  the kind of food he eats. Please notice that we do not assert that it  _causes_ him to eat a certain kind of food nor that a certain diet may  not have affected the shape of the bill, causing it to be what we now  see. Both may be at least partially true, but to prove either or both  would need profound study, and all that we have observed is that the  shape of the woodpecker's bill is _adapted_ to his food and that it  varies with the kind of food he eats, or, to be more exact, with his  ways of procuring it.          XII    THE WOODPECKER'S TOOLS: HIS FOOT      We have studied the woodpecker's bill and have found that it is a very  serviceable tool. We shall find that his feet are equally well adapted  to their work.    Here is the foot of a woodpecker. Observe how it differs from a  chicken's foot, or a sparrow's foot. What is it that especially fits it  for climbing? Perhaps you will notice that the tarsus is short, and you  may be able to explain why it would be a disadvantage for a climbing  bird to have long legs, as well as why it is a help for him to have long  toes. Toes long and legs short is the rule with the woodpeckers.    [Illustration: Foot of Woodpecker.]    I never see a woodpecker's foot without thinking of an iceman's nippers  with their short handles and long, sharp-toothed jaws. They are designed  for similar uses,--to lift heavy weights by laying hold of smooth, flat  surfaces. The iceman sets his nippers into the ice and lifts the block;  but the bird sets his claws into the tree and lifts his own body.    Suppose the nippers had one short jaw and one long one, would they then  take as firm hold as they do with jaws of equal length? In perching  birds the hind toe is much the shortest, but they sit balanced upon a  limb and have merely to hold themselves in position. The woodpecker  climbing a tree-trunk is out of balance; he would fall off unless he had  a firm grip; and he could not get this firm hold if his hind toes were  not long enough to give his foot a nearly equal spread back and forward.  Other birds grasp a limb with the whole under surface of their toes, but  the woodpecker when on a smooth, upright tree-trunk nips it only with  his toenails. Try with your own hand to hold a stick as large and heavy  as you can grasp, and you will see that when you clasp your hand around  it as a perching bird takes hold of a perch, it makes little difference  that the thumb is shorter than the fingers, but when you try to nip it  with your finger tips alone, you must bend your fingers until they are  not much longer than your thumb,--that is, a pair of nippers must be  equal jawed.    This simple illustration shows why the woodpecker's foot reaches as far  backward as forward. But a sensible objection may be raised, namely,  that as there are two hind toes of unequal length, it is by no means  certain which is the more necessary.    [Illustration: Diagram of right foot.]    Scientists tell us that a woodpecker's foot, though it looks so unlike a  chicken's, is really very much the same. When we ask how one of the  front toes disappeared and how the extra hind toe came to be where it  is, they tell us that there has been no addition and no loss, but the  extra hind toe is only a front toe turned backward. They call it a  _reversed fourth toe_. A bird's toes are numbered in order starting with  the hind toe and going around the _inside_ of the foot to the outer or  fourth toe. The hind toe is the thumb, and the others are numbered in  the same order as the fingers of our hands. So we see that the  woodpecker's real hind toe is rather small, like that of most birds. It  looks very much as if it had been found _too_ small and as if another  had turned back to help it do its work. Do you say that a bird cannot  turn his toes about in this way? Most cannot, to be sure, but all of the  owls can do it. An owl will sit either with two toes forward and two  backward, or with three forward and one the other way. The owls have a  reversible outer toe, and perhaps the woodpeckers did also before it  became permanently reversed.    [Illustration: Foot of Three-toed Woodpecker.]    That this is exactly what had happened is curiously confirmed. There are  a few woodpeckers in this country which have but three toes. They are  the only North American land birds with less than four toes (though many  sea and shore birds have but three). Compare this picture with a  four-toed woodpecker's foot. One toe is gone completely, when or how no  one can tell. But in some way the _first_ toe, the _thumb_, the one we  always begin to count from, has disappeared. The one left is the  reversed fourth toe, as we know by the number of joints in it.  Undoubtedly this woodpecker needed a hind toe, but he must have needed a  longer, stronger one than his natural first toe. A toe of the right  length was supplied by turning one of the front toes back, and the short  hind toe in some way disappeared.    This may seem a roundabout way to show that a woodpecker's foot is a  pair of nippers. First we studied nippers till we found out that they  were not good nippers unless they were nearly equal-limbed. Next we  studied the woodpecker's foot to learn about that extra hind toe. Then  it occurred to us that four toes were not necessary, since some of our  best climbers have but three. What was the essential point? Might it not  be a foot equally divided without reference to the number of toes? But  that is the principle of a pair of nippers. Then came the question, is  there any similarity in their use? Yes, the nippers are used to lift  heavy weights, and the woodpecker's foot is used to lift his heavy body  in just the same way, by taking hold of a flat, smooth surface. We  conclude that a wide-spread, equally divided, nipping foot would be the  best device possible for the woodpecker's way of living, and we find by  examination that every woodpecker shows this type of foot.    There is additional evidence that this is the right explanation. Our  only other North American birds that climb on the bark of trees  professionally, as we may say, are the brown creepers and the  nuthatches. In both these the tarsus is short, as we found it in the  woodpeckers, and the hind toe and its claw are fully equal to the middle  toe and claw, making an equally divided foot. On the other hand, the  foot with two toes forward and two toes backward is confined neither to  woodpeckers nor to climbing birds. The parrots, which climb after a  fashion, have it; but so do the cuckoos, which do not climb, some of  which, like our road-runner, or ground cuckoo of the West, are strictly  terrestrial. The \"yoking\" of the toes may occur by the reversion of the  fourth toe, as ordinarily, or of the second toe, as in the trogons; the  arrangement appears to be definitely related to the distribution of the  tendons that control the toes. But though accounting for the structure  may give a clue to its descent, it does not justify its efficiency. The  yoke-toed foot is not exclusively a climbing foot. All our families of  climbers have at least one representative with but one toe behind, and  this clearly proves that the yoke-toed structure is by no means  necessary even though it may be an honorable inheritance among climbers.  The natural conclusion is that the important point in climbing is not  the number nor the arrangement of the toes, but the length of at least  one hind toe so as to give an equally divided foot.    There is an interesting point to notice about the woodpeckers. This  reversed fourth toe is curiously variable in length. In the flickers,  with its claw, it is a little shorter than the middle (third) toe with  its claw; in the red-heads and their friends it a little exceeds the  middle toe and claw; in the downy and the hairy it is much the longest  toe, and in the ivory-billed woodpecker it is abnormally developed. We  at once judge that it is some indication of the bird's manner of life,  and we look for it to be largest in the species that live continually  upon the trunks of trees, obtaining most of their food by drilling. We  expect to see the finest development of drilling bill accompany this  enormously developed toe, and we find them both in the ivory-billed  woodpecker. In imagination we clearly see the use of it. The great bird,  keen in his quest of grubs, sidling hastily round the tree, in an  unsteady balance and unsupported by his tail, throws one long hind toe  downward to steady himself, hooks the other into the bark above him, and  hangs between the two as firmly supported as in his ordinary position.  No doubt he does do this, but does it prove the supposition that the  heaviest and most arboreal woodpeckers have the greatest development of  the fourth toe? Not at all. There is our rare acquaintance the logcock,  or pileated woodpecker, a bird nearly as large as the ivory-billed, one  of the most persistent of our tree-climbers and more than any other  woodpecker I ever observed given to scratching rapidly round and round a  tree-trunk, clinging at ease in almost any position except  head-downward, and drilling incessantly"]]]
