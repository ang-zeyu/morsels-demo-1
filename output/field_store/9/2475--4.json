Many people came to see us, and were  astonished at our appearance and the whiteness of our skins. They asked  whence we came, and we gave them to understand that we came from heaven,  and that we were travelling to see the world, and they believed it. In  this land we put up a font of baptism, and an infinite number of people  were baptised, and they called us, in their language, CARABI, which is  as much as to say, \"men of great wisdom.\"    We departed from this port. The province is called PARIAS,[77] and we  navigated along the coast, _always in sight of land, until we had run  along it a distance of 870 leagues, always towards the_ NORTH-WEST,[78]  making many tacks and treating with many tribes. In many places we  discovered gold, though not in any great quantity, but we did much in  discovering the land, and in ascertaining that there was gold. We had  now been thirteen months on the voyage,[79] and the ships and gear were  much worn, and the men tired. We resolved, after consultation, to beach  the ships and heave them down, as they were making much water, and to  caulk them afresh, before shaping a course for Spain. When we made this  decision we were near _the finest harbour in the world_, which we entered  with our ships. Here we found a great many people, who received us in  a very friendly manner. On shore we made a bastion with our boats, and  with casks and our guns, at which we all rejoiced. Here we lightened[80]  and cleared our ships, and hauled them up, making all the repairs that  were necessary, the people of the country giving us all manner of help,  and regularly supplying us with provisions. For in that port we had  little relish for our own, which we made fun of, for our provisions for  the voyage were running short, and were bad.    We remained here thirty-seven days, and often went to their village,  where they received us with great honour. When we wanted to resume our  voyage, they made a complaint how, at certain times, a very cruel and  hostile tribe came by way of the sea to their land, murdered many of  them, subdued them, and took some prisoners, carrying them off to their  own houses and land. They added that they were scarcely able to defend  themselves, making signs that their enemies were people of an island at  a distance of about 100 leagues out at sea. They said this so earnestly  that we believed them; and we promised to avenge their injuries, which  gave them much pleasure. Many of them offered to go with us, but we  did not wish to take them. We agreed that seven should accompany us,  on condition that they went in their own canoe. For we did not want to  be obliged to take them back to their land; and they were content. So  we took leave of those people, leaving many friends among them.    Our ships having been repaired, we navigated for seven days across the  sea, with the _wind_[81] between north-east and east, and at the end  of the seven days we came upon the islands, which were numerous, some  inhabited and others deserted. We anchored off one of them, where we saw  many people, who called it _Iti_.[82] Having manned our boats with good  men, and placed three rounds of the bombard in each, we pulled to the  shore, where we found 400 men and many women, all naked. They were well  made, and seemed good fighting men, for they were armed with bows and  arrows, and lances. The greater part of them also had square shields,  and they carried them so that they should not impede their using the  bow. As we approached the shore in the boats, at the distance of a  bowshot, they all rushed into the water to shoot their arrows, and to  defend themselves from us they returned to the land. They all had their  bodies painted with different colours, and were adorned with feathers. The  interpreters told us that when they showed themselves plumed and painted,  it is a sign that they intend to fight. They so persevered in defending  the landing that we were obliged to use our artillery. When they heard  the report, and saw some of their own people fall dead, they all retreated  inland. After holding a consultation, we resolved to land forty of our  men, and await their attack. The men landed with their arms, and the  natives came against us, and fought us for nearly an hour,[83] gaining  little advantage, except that our cross-bow men and gunners killed  some of the natives, while they wounded some of our people. They would  not wait for the thrust of our spears or swords, but we pushed on with  such vigour at last that we came within sword-thrust, and as they could  not withstand our arms, they fled to the hills and woods, leaving us  victorious on the field, with many of their dead and wounded. We did not  continue the pursuit that day, because we were very tired. In returning  to the ships, the seven men who came with us showed such delight that  they could not contain themselves.    Next day we saw a great number of the people on shore, still with signs  of war, sounding horns and various other instruments used by them for  defiance, and all plumed and painted, so that it was a very strange thing  to behold them. All the ships, therefore, consulted together, and it  was concluded that these people desired hostility with us. It was then  decided that we should do all in our power to make friends with them,  and if they rejected our friendship we should treat them as enemies,  and that we should make slaves of as many as we could take. Being armed  as well as our means admitted, we returned to the shore. They did not  oppose our landing, I believe from fear of the guns. Forty of our men  landed in four detachments, each with a captain, and attacked them. After  a long battle, many of them being killed, the rest were put to flight.  We followed in pursuit until we came to a village, having taken nearly  250 prisoners.[84] We burnt the village and returned to the ships with  these 250 prisoners, leaving many killed and wounded. On our side  no more than _one was killed, and twenty-two were wounded_, who all  recovered. God be thanked! We prepared to depart, and the seven men,  five of whom were wounded, took a canoe belonging to the island, and  with seven prisoners that we gave them, four women and three men, they  returned to their land with much joy, astonished at our power. We made  sail for Spain with 222 prisoners,[85] our slaves, and arrived in the  port of Cadiz on the 15th of October 1498, where we were well received,  and where we sold our slaves. This is what befell me in this my first  voyage, that was most worthy of note.    THE FIRST VOYAGE ENDS.             *       *       *       *       *          SECOND VOYAGE OF AMERIGO VESPUCCI.      As regards the second voyage, what I saw in it most worthy of mention is  as follows: We left the port of Cadiz, with three ships,[86] on the 16th  of May 1499, and shaped our course direct for the Cape Verde islands,  passing in sight of the island of Grand Canary; and we navigated until  we reached an island which is called the island of FUOCO. Here we got  in our supplies of wood and water, and thence shaped our course to the  south-west. In forty-four days we came in sight of a new land, and we  judged it to be the mainland, continuous with that of which mention has  already been made. This land is within the Torrid Zone, and beyond the  equinoctial line on the south side, over which the Pole rises from the  meridian 5 deg., beyond every climate. It is distant from the said islands  by the S.W. wind[87] 500 leagues. We found the day and night to be equal,  because we arrived on the 27th of June, when the sun is near the tropic  of Cancer. We found this land to be all drowned, and full of very great  rivers. At first we did not see any people. We anchored our ships and  got our boats out, going with them to the land, which, as I have said,  we found to be full of very large rivers, and drowned by these great  rivers. There we tried in many directions to see if we could enter;  and owing to the great waters and rivers, in spite of so much labour,  we could not find a place that was not inundated.    We saw, along the rivers, many signs of the country being inhabited; but  having ascertained that we could not enter from this part, we determined  to return to the ships, and to try another part. We weighed our anchors,  and navigated between the east south-east, coasting along the land,  which trended southwards, and many times we made forty leagues, but  all was time lost. We found on this coast that the current of the sea  had such force that it prevented us from navigating, for it ran from  south to north. The inconvenience was so great for our navigation that,  after a consultation, we decided upon altering the course to north,  and we made good such a distance along the land, that we reached a most  excellent port, formed by a large island, which was at the entrance.[88]  Within, a very large haven was formed.    In sailing along the island to enter it we saw many people, and we steered  our ships so as to bring them up where the people were seen, which  was nearly four leagues more towards the sea. Sailing in this way we  had seen a canoe, which was coming from seaward, with many people on  board. We determined to overhaul her, and we went round with our ships  in her direction, so that we might not lose her. Sailing towards the  canoe with a fresh breeze, we saw that they had stopped with their oars  tossed--I believe, with wonder at the sight of our ships. But when they  saw that we were gaining upon them, they put down their oars, and began  to row towards the land. As our company came in a fast-sailing caravel  of forty-five tons, we got to windward of the canoe, and when it seemed  time to bear down upon her, the sheets were eased off so as to come"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36962"],[0,"My Attainment of the Pole (#10)"],[1," was gathering and sought to hasten to shelter in Godhaven--a name  which speaks eloquently of the dangers of this coast and the precious  value of such a harbor.    As we entered the narrow channel, which turns among low, polished rocks  and opens into the harbor, two Eskimos in kayaks came out to act as  pilots. Taking them aboard, we soon found a snug anchorage, secure from  wind and sea. The launch was lowered, and in it we left the schooner for  a visit to the Governor.    Coming up to a little pier, we were cordially greeted by Governor  Fenker, who escorted us to his home, where his wife, a cultivated young  Danish woman, offered us sincere hospitality.    The little town itself was keenly alive. All the inhabitants, and all  the dogs as well, were jumping about on the rocks, eagerly gazing at our  schooner. The houses of the Governor and the Inspector were the most  important of the town. They were built of wood imported from Denmark,  and were covered with tarred paper. Though quite moderate in size, the  houses seemed too large and out of place in their setting of  ice-polished rocks. Beyond them were twenty Eskimo huts, nearly square  in shape, constructed of wood and stone, the cracks of which were filled  tightly with moss.    We deferred our visit to the native huts, and invited Governor Fenker  and his wife to dine aboard the schooner. The surprise of the evening  for these two guests was the playing of our phonograph, the tunes of  which brought tears of homesickness to the eyes of the Governor's gentle  wife.    Anywhere on the coast of Greenland, the coming of a ship is always one  of the prime events of the season. So uneventful is life in these  out-of-the-way places that such an arrival is the greatest possible  social enlivener. The instant that the approach of our schooner had been  noted, the Eskimo girls--queer little maids in queer little  trousers--decided upon having a dance, and word was brought us that  everyone was invited to take part. The sailors eagerly responded, and  tumbled ashore as soon as they were permitted, leaving merely enough for  a watch on board ship. Then, to the sound of savage music, the dance was  continued until long after midnight. A curious kind of midnight dance it  was, with the sun brightly shining in a night unveiled of glitter and  color glory. The sailors certainly found pleasure in whirling about,  their arms encircling fat and clumsy waists. They did admit, however,  when back on board the schooner, that the smell of the furs within which  the maidens had spent the past winter was less agreeable than the savor  of fish. The name of this scattered settlement of huts, Godhaven, comes,  clearly enough, from its offering fortunate refuge from storms; that the  place is also known as Lively is not in the least to be wondered at, if  one has watched a midnight dance of the little population and their  visitors.    Before hauling in anchor in the harbor of Godhaven, we made some  necessary repairs to the yacht and filled our tanks with water. With a  free wind speeding onward to the west of Disco, we passed the narrow  strait known as the Vaigat early the following morning. As I stood on  deck and viewed the passing of icebergs, glittering in the limpid,  silvery light of morning like monstrous diamonds, there began to grow  within me a feeling--that throbbed in pulsation with the onward movement  of the boat--that every minute, every mile, meant a nearing to that  mysterious center, on the attaining of which I had set my heart, and  which, even now, seemed unlikely, improbable. Yet the thought gave me a  thrill.    Before noon we reached the mouth of Umanak Fiord, into the delightful  waters of which we were tempted to enter. The lure of the farther North  decided us against this, and soon the striking Svarten Huk (Black Hook),  a great rock cliff, loomed upon the horizon. Beyond it, gradually  appeared a long chain of those islands among which lies Upernavik, where  the last traces of civilized or semi-civilized life are found. The wind  increased in force but the horizon remained remarkably clear. Over a  bounding sea we sped rapidly along to the west, into the labyrinth of  islands that are sprinkled along the southern shore of Melville Bay.[3]  Beyond, we were to come into the true boreal wilderness of ice, where  there were only a few savage aborigines, its sole inhabitants.    On the following day, with reduced sail and the help of the auxiliary  engine, we pushed far up into Melville Bay, where we ran into fields of  pack-ice. Here we decided to hunt for game. With this purpose it was  necessary to keep close to land. Here also came our first realistic  experience with the great forces of the North. The pack-ice floated  close around us, young ice cemented the broken masses together, and for  several days we were thus closely imprisoned in frozen seas.    These days of enforced delay were days of great pleasure, for the bears  and seals on the ice afforded considerable sport. The constant danger of  our position, however, required a close watch for the safety of the  schooner. The Devil's Thumb, a high rock shaped like a dark thumb  pointing at the sky, loomed darkly and beckoningly before us. A biting  wind descended from the interior.    The ice groaned; the eiderducks, guillemots and gulls uttered shrill and  disturbing cries, seemingly sensing the coming of a storm.    For three days we were held in the grip of the relentless pack; then the  glimmer of the land ice changed to an ugly gray, the pack around us  began to crack threateningly, and the sky darkened to the southward.    The wind ominously died away. The air thickened rapidly. A general  feeling of anxiety came over us, although my familiarity with storms in  the North made it possible for me to explain that heavy seas are seldom  felt within the zone of a large ice-pack, for the reason that the  icebergs, the flat ice masses, and even the small floating fragments,  ordinarily hold down the swells. Even when the pack begins to break, the  lanes of water between the fragments thicken under the lower temperature  like an oiled surface, and offer an easy sea. Furthermore, a really  severe wind would be sure to release the schooner, and it would then be  possible to trust it to its staunch qualities in free water.    Hardly had we finished dinner when we heard the sound of a brisk wind  rushing through the rigging. Hurrying to the deck, we saw coils of what  looked like smoky vapor rising in the south as if belched from some  great volcano. The gloom on the horizon was rapidly growing deeper. The  sound of the wind changed to a threatening, sinister hiss. In the  piercing steel-gray light we saw the ice heave awesomely, like moving  hills, above the blackening water. The bergs swayed and rocked, and the  massed ice gave forth strange, troublous sounds.    Suddenly a channel began to open through the ice in front of us. The  trisail was quickly set, the other sails being left tightly furled, and  with the engine helping to push us in the desired direction, we drew  deep breaths of relief as we moved out into the free water to the  westward.    We felt a sense of safety now, although, clear of the ice, the sea rose  about us with a sickening suddenness. Black as night, the water seemed  far more dangerous because the waves were everywhere dashing angrily  against walls of ice. Already strong, the wind veered slightly and  increased to a fierce, persistent gale. Like rubber balls, the bergs  bounded and rolled in the sea. The sound of the storm was now a thunder  suggestive of constantly exploding cannons. But, fortunately, we were  snug aboard, and, keeping the westerly course, soon escaped the dangers  of ensnaring ice.    We were still in a heavy storm, and had we not had full confidence in  the ship, built as she was to withstand the storms of the Grand Banks,  we should still have felt anxiety, for the schooner rolled and pitched  and the masts dipped from side to side until they almost touched the  water.    Icy water swept the deck. A rain began to fall, and quickly sheathed the  masts and ropes in ice. Snow followed, giving a surface as of sandpaper  to the slippery, icy decks. The temperature was not low, but the cutting  wind pierced one to the very marrow. Our men were drenched with spray  and heavily coated with ice. Although suffering severely, the sailors  maintained their courage and appeared even abnormally happy. Gradually  we progressed into the open sea. In the course of four hours the storm  began to abate, and, under a double-reefed foresail, at last we  gleefully rode out the finish of the storm in safety.

I  know of nothing on earth so strange, so wonderful, withal so sad.  Pursuing our course through Melville Bay, I felt the fatal magic of it  enthralling my very soul. For hours I stood on deck alone, the midnight  sun, like some monstrous perpetual light to some implacable  frozen-hearted deity, burning blindingly upon the horizon and setting  the sea aflame. The golden colors suffused my mind, and I swam in a sea  of molten glitter.    I was consumed for hours by but one yearning--a yearning that filled and  intoxicated me--to go on, and on, and ever onward, where no man had ever  been. Perhaps it is the human desire to excel others, to prove, because  of the innate egotism of the human unit, that one possesses qualities of  brain and muscle which no other possesses, that has crazed men to  perform this, the most difficult physical"]]]
