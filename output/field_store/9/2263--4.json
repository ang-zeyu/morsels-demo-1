After her wedding she had a  little child who died and was buried under this tree. Since then there  has been neither fruit nor flower on its branches: if the child be  given Christian burial the tree will produce blossom and fruit as in  the past.\"    The Moon was just moving off when Jean begged her to stop and answer  one more question, which was, why the inhabitants of a certain land  were unable to obtain from their well the clear and wholesome water it  had formerly poured forth.    She replied: \"Under the mouth of the well, just where the water should  flow, lies an enormous toad which poisons it continually: the brim of  the well must be broken and the toad killed, then the water will be as  pure and wholesome as formerly.\"    The Moon then resumed her journey, for Jean had no more questions to  ask her.    He joyfully went back to claim his Annette, but forgot not to stop on  coming to the land where they were short of water. The inhabitants ran  out to meet him, anxious to know what he had found out.    [Illustration]    Jean led them to the well and there explained the instructions he had  received from the Moon, at the same time showing them what to do. Sure  enough, right underneath the brim of the well they found a horrible  toad which poisoned everything. When they had killed it, the water  immediately became pure and transparent, and sweet to the taste as  before.    All the people brought Jean presents, and thus laden with riches he  again set out. On arriving at the town where grew the unfruitful  pear-tree, he was warmly welcomed by the prince, who at once asked if  he had forgotten to question the stars about the tree.    \"I never forget a promise once made,\" replied Jean, \"but I doubt  whether it will be agreeable to your majesty to know the cause of the  evil.\"    He then related all the Moon had said, and when his directions had  been carried out they were rewarded by seeing the tree blossom  immediately. Jean was loaded with rich gifts, and the king presented  him with a most valuable horse, by means of which he reached home very  quickly.    Little Annette was wild with joy on hearing of her lover's safe  return, for she had wept and suffered much during his absence. But her  father's feelings were very different; he wished never to see Jean  again, and had, indeed, sent him in search of the Sun with the hope  that he might be burnt up by the heat. True it is that \"Man proposes  and God disposes.\" Our young shepherd returned, not only safe and  sound, but with more knowledge than any of his evil-wishers. For he  had learnt why the Sun neither lights nor warms the earth by night as  in the day; also why the Moon does not give warmth, and only lights up  during the night. Besides all this he had brought with him riches  which far exceeded those of his father-in-law, and a steed full of  fire and vigour.    So Annette's father could find no fault, and the wedding was  celebrated with joy and feasting. Large quantities of roasted crane  were eaten, and glasses overflowing with mead were emptied. So  beautiful, too, was the music, that for long, long after it was heard  to echo among the mountains, and even now its sweet sounds are heard  at times by travellers among those regions.          THE DWARF WITH THE LONG BEARD          [Illustration: THE DWARF.]    THE DWARF WITH THE LONG BEARD      In a far distant land there reigned a king, and he had an only  daughter who was so very beautiful that no one in the whole kingdom  could be compared to her. She was known as Princess Pietnotka, and the  fame of her beauty spread far and wide. There were many princes among  her suitors, but her choice fell upon Prince Dobrotek. She obtained  her father's consent to their marriage, and then, attended by a  numerous suite, set off with her lover for the church, having first,  as was the custom, received her royal parent's blessing. Most of the  princes who had been unsuccessful in their wooing of Pietnotka  returned disappointed to their own kingdoms: but one of them, a dwarf  only seven inches high, with an enormous hump on his back and a beard  seven feet long, who was a powerful prince and magician, was so  enraged that he determined to have his revenge. So he changed himself  into a whirlwind and lay in wait to receive the princess. When the  wedding procession was about to enter the church the air was suddenly  filled with a blinding cloud of dust, and Pietnotka was borne up high  as the highest clouds, and then right down to an underground palace.  There the dwarf, for it was he who had worked this spell, disappeared,  leaving her in a lifeless condition.    When she opened her eyes she found herself in such a magnificent  apartment that she imagined some king must have run away with her. She  got up and began to walk about, when lo! as if by some unseen hand the  table was laden with gold and silver dishes, filled with cakes of  every kind. They looked so tempting, that in spite of her grief she  could not resist tasting, and she continued to eat until she was more  than satisfied. She returned to the sofa and lay down to rest, but  being unable to sleep, she looked first at the door, and then at the  lamp burning on the table, then at the door again, and then back to  the lamp. Suddenly the door opened of itself, giving entrance to four  negroes fully armed, and bearing a golden throne, upon which was  seated the Dwarf with the Long Beard. He came close up to the sofa and  attempted to kiss the princess, but she struck him such a blow in the  face that a thousand stars swam before his eyes, and a thousand bells  rang in his ears; upon which he gave such a shout, that the palace  walls trembled. Yet his love for her was so great that he did his best  not to show his anger, and turned away as if to leave her. But his  feet became entangled in his long beard, and he fell down, dropping a  cap he was carrying in his hand. Now this cap had the power of making  its wearer invisible. The negroes hastened up to their master, and  placing him on his throne bore him out.    Directly the princess found herself alone she jumped off the sofa,  locked the door, and picking up the cap ran to a mirror to try it on  and see how it suited her. Imagine her amazement when looking in the  glass she saw--nothing at all! She took off the cap, and behold, she  was there again as large as life. She soon found out what sort of cap  it was, and rejoicing in the possession of such a marvel, put it on  her head again and began to walk about the room. Soon the door was  burst violently open, and the dwarf entered with his beard tied up.  But he found neither the princess nor the cap, and so came to the  conclusion that she had taken it. In a great rage he began to search  high and low; he looked under all the furniture, behind the curtains,  and even beneath the carpets, but it was all in vain. Meanwhile the  princess, still invisible, had left the palace and run into the  garden, which was very large and beautiful. There she lived at her  ease, eating the delicious fruit, drinking water from the fountain,  and enjoying the helpless fury of the dwarf, who sought her  untiringly. Sometimes she would throw the fruit-stones in his face, or  take off the cap and show herself for an instant: then she would put  it on again, and laugh merrily at his rage.    One day, while playing this game, the cap caught in the branches of a  gooseberry bush. The dwarf seeing this at once ran up, seized the  princess in one hand and the cap in the other, and was about to carry  both off when the sound of a war-trumpet was heard.    The dwarf trembled with rage and muttered a thousand curses. He  breathed on the princess to send her to sleep, covered her with the  invisible cap, and seizing a double-bladed sword, rose up in the air  as high as the clouds, so that he might fall upon his assailant and  kill him at one stroke. We shall now see with whom he had to deal.    After the hurricane had upset the wedding procession and carried off  the princess, there arose a great tumult among those at court. The  king, the princess's attendants, and Prince Dobrotek sought her in  every direction, calling her by name, and making inquiries of every  one they met. At last, the king in despair declared that if Prince  Dobrotek did not bring back his daughter, he would destroy his kingdom  and have him killed. And to the other princes present he promised that  whosoever among them should bring Pietnotka back to him should have  her for his wife and receive half of the kingdom. Whereupon they all  mounted their horses without loss of time and dispersed in every  direction.    Prince Dobrotek, overpowered with grief and dismay, travelled three  days without eating, drinking, or sleeping. On the evening of the  third day he was quite worn-out with fatigue, and stopping his horse  in a field, got down to rest for a short time. Suddenly he heard  cries, as of something in pain, and looking round saw an enormous owl  tearing a hare with its claws. The prince laid hold of the first hard  thing that came to his hand; he imagined it to be a stone, but it was  really a skull, and aiming it at the owl, killed the bird with the  first blow. The rescued hare ran up to him and gratefully licked his  hands, after which it ran away: but the human skull spoke to him and  said, \"Prince Dobrotek, accept my grateful thanks for the good turn  you have done me. I belonged to an unhappy man who took his own life,  and for this crime of suicide I have been condemned to roll in the mud  until I was the means of saving the life of one of God's creatures. I  have been kicked about for seven hundred and seventy years, crumbling  miserably on the earth, and without exciting the compassion of a  single individual. You have been the means of setting me free by  making use of me to save the life of that poor hare.

On a third visit, after a like  interval, it seemed at once and entirely at home. Nevertheless, its  habits while in the country differ very much from those it has in  town. In its original domicile it insists on being about the table at  meal-times. While in the country it does not care to be present; in  fact, it appears to avoid associations with the household. It seems  to me that this cat, after the manner of some men whose brains are  diseased, now lives in two distinct states of consciousness, each  relating to one of its places of abode.    [Illustration:          Hounds Running a Wild Boar                 (Showing the habit of attacking neck of prey.) ]    The differences as regards affection for localities which is shown by  cats and dogs are perhaps to be accounted for by an original and  essential variation in the habits of life in their wild ancestors.  Judging by the kindred of the species which are known to us in their  wild state, we may fairly suppose that the dogs were of old accustomed  to range over a wide field, having no fixed place of abode; the pack  ranging, if the occasion served, for hundreds of miles in any direction.  On the other hand, with the cats, it is characteristic of the species  that they have lairs to which they resort, and a definite hunting ground  in which they seek their food. They are, in a word, animals of very  determined routine. As there has been no effort by breeding to change  this feature, it has remained in all its old ingrained intensity.    As a consequence of the affection which cats have for particular places,  they often return to the wilderness when by chance the homes in which  they have been reared are abandoned. Thus in New England, in those  sections of the district where many farmsteads have of late years been  deserted, the cats have remained about their ancient haunts and have  become entirely wild. In this State they are bred in such numbers that  their presence is now a serious menace to the birds and other weaker  creatures of the country. The behavior of these feralized animals  differs somewhat from that of creatures which have never been tamed.  They have not the same immediate fear of a man, but the least effort to  approach them leads to their hasty flight.    While considering the inelastic quality which is exhibited by cats as  compared with the dog, the naturalist notes with interest the fact that  the former creature belongs to a family which has never been accustomed  to any social life beyond the limits of the family. Moreover, all the  cats have the habit of hunting in a solitary way, each for itself, in  the achievement and in the result. It is otherwise with dogs. They  belong to a group which hunts in packs. For ages they have been used to  a communal life. Their minds have thus become accustomed to social  intercourse; they are used to having their excitements of the chase in  comradeship, and generally they are accustomed to the rough-and-tumble  fraternity which we behold in a pack of wolves. It was long ago remarked  that the really social animals are those which afford the only good  material for subjugation. The difference between the cat and dog seems,  in a way, to warrant this statement.    Although it is likely that many efforts have been made to domesticate  the other larger felines, no distinct success has attended these  experiments. A large Asiatic cat known as the chetah is somewhat used  in hunting for sport, but the species has never been adopted in any  definite way. In fact, with all the larger cats, including the lion,  which is structurally a little apart from the other members of  the group, the size and furious nature of the animal have made it  impossible to begin the process of selection which has been the means  whereby the wilderness motive has been replaced by that of the  household in the case of all other domesticated beasts.

The largest economic problem which primitive people on their way upward  towards civilization had unconsciously to face was that of obtaining  some kind of strength which could be added to the power of their own  weak limbs. For all his eminent capacities of body, man is not a strong  animal, nor is he so built that he can apply the measure of strength  that is in him to good advantage. There are scores if not hundreds  of species with which he came in contact in his effort to dominate  nature that are stronger, swifter, and better provided with natural  weapons. With the first step upward, as in almost all the succeeding  steps, the advance depended on securing more energy than that with  which our kind was directly endowed. It is hardly too much to say  that the progress of mankind beyond the savage state would probably  never have been effected but for the bodily help which has been  rendered by a few domesticated animals.    From the point of view of the student of domesticated animals the races  of men may well be divided into those which have and those which have  not the use of the horse. Although there are half a score of other  animals which have done much for man, which have indeed stamped  themselves upon his history, no other creature has been so inseparably  associated with the great triumphs of our kind, whether won on the  battle-field or in the arts of peace. So far as material comfort, or  even wealth, is concerned, we of the northern realms and present age  could, perhaps, better spare the horse from our present life than  either sheep or horned cattle; but without this creature it is certain  that our civilization would never have developed in anything like its  present form. Lacking the help which the horse gives, it is almost  certain that, even now, it could not be maintained.    We know the ancient natural history of the horse more completely than  that of any other of our domesticated animals. We can trace the steps  by which its singularly strong limbs and feet, on which rests its value  to man, were formed in the great laboratory of geologic time. The story  is so closely related to the interests of man that it will be well  briefly to set it before the reader. In the first stages of the  Tertiary period, in the age when we begin to trace the evolution of the  suck-giving animals above the lowly grade in which the kangaroos and  opossums belong, we find the ancestors of our mammalian series all  characterized by rather weakly organized limbs fitted, as were those of  their remoter kindred the marsupials, for tree climbing rather than for  moving over the surface of the ground. The fact is, that all the  creatures of this great clan acquired their properties of body in  arboreal life, and with such relatively small and light bodies as were  fitted for tree climbing. For this use the feet need to be  loose-jointed, and so the system of five toes, each terminating in a  sharp and strong nail or claw, became fixed in the inheritances. When,  gaining strength and coming to possess a more important place in the  world, these ancient tree-dwellers were able to occupy the ground which  of old had been possessed by the great reptiles, the limbs that had  served well for an arboreal life had to undergo many changes in order  to fit them for progression in the new realm.    If we watch the progress of a bear over the surface of the ground, we  readily perceive how lumbering is its gait and how poor the speed which  it attains. Its slow and shambling movement is due to the fact that it  has the tree-climbing foot, and is not well fitted for motion such as is  required in running. To attain anything like speed in this exercise it  is necessary to support the body on the tips of the toes. Every man who  has gained any skill in this art knows full well how incompetent he is  if he tries to run with rapidity in the flat-footed manner. The bear  cannot essay this method of progression on the toe-tips because its  loose-jointed feet cannot be made to support its heavy body. In this way  arose the necessity of developing a peculiar kind of foot when that part  had to serve for rapid locomotion. The experiments to this end have been  numerous and varied. Thus in the elephants, which retain the originally  numerous toes, the bones of these members are planted in an upright  position and tied together with such strong muscles and sinews, that the  foot parts have something like the solidity and strength of the upper  portions of the legs. In the single-hoofed or horse-like forms, and in  the cloven-footed animals, other series of experiments have been tried  which in the end have proved most successful, giving us animals with the  speediest movements of any animals except the creatures of the air.    [Illustration: A Hunter]    The success which has been attained in our ordinary large herbivora, and  which has made them competent to evade the chase of the beasts of prey,  has been accomplished by reducing the number of the toes, giving the  strength of the aborted parts to increase the power of those remaining.  The result is the formation of two great groups, the double-hoofed  forms, including the pigs, deer, cattle, sheep, and their kindred, and  the single-toed species, of which our horse is the foremost example. In  the reduction of the number of toes, different plans were followed in  each of these"]]]
