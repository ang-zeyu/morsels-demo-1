It seemed as though he  had gone into the water a youth, and come out of it a man full grown.    He knew what there was behind him. A broad stretch of grass, and then a  thicket, and in that Eudena could hide. That was clear in his mind,  though his thinking powers were too feeble to see what should happen  thereafter. Uya stood knee-deep, undecided and unarmed. His heavy mouth  hung open, showing his canine teeth, and he panted heavily. His side was  flushed and bruised under the hair. The other man beside him carried a  sharpened stick. The rest of the hunters came up one by one to the top  of the bank, hairy, long-armed men clutching flints and sticks. Two ran  off along the bank down stream, and then clambered to the water, where  Wau had come to the surface struggling weakly. Before they could reach  him he went under again. Two others threatened Ugh-lomi from the bank.    He answered back, shouts, vague insults, gestures. Then Uya, who had  been hesitating, roared with rage, and whirling his fists plunged into  the water. His followers splashed after him.    Ugh-lomi glanced over his shoulder and found Eudena already vanished  into the thicket. He would perhaps have waited for Uya, but Uya  preferred to spar in the water below him until the others were beside  him. Human tactics in those days, in all serious fighting, were the  tactics of the pack. Prey that turned at bay they gathered around and  rushed. Ugh-lomi felt the rush coming, and hurling the antler at Uya,  turned about and fled.    When he halted to look back from the shadow of the thicket, he found  only three of his pursuers had followed him across the river, and they  were going back again. Uya, with a bleeding mouth, was on the farther  side of the stream again, but lower down, and holding his hand to his  side. The others were in the river dragging something to shore. For a  time at least the chase was intermitted.    Ugh-lomi stood watching for a space, and snarled at the sight of Uya.  Then he turned and plunged into the thicket.    In a minute, Eudena came hastening to join him, and they went on hand in  hand. He dimly perceived the pain she suffered from the cut and bruised  knee, and chose the easier ways. But they went on all that day, mile  after mile, through wood and thicket, until at last they came to the  chalkland, open grass with rare woods of beech, and the birch growing  near water, and they saw the Wealden mountains nearer, and groups of  horses grazing together. They went circumspectly, keeping always near  thicket and cover, for this was a strange region--even its ways were  strange. Steadily the ground rose, until the chestnut forests spread  wide and blue below them, and the Thames marshes shone silvery, high and  far. They saw no men, for in those days men were still only just come  into this part of the world, and were moving but slowly along the  river-ways. Towards evening they came on the river again, but now it ran  in a gorge, between high cliffs of white chalk that sometimes overhung  it. Down the cliffs was a scrub of birches and there were many birds  there. And high up the cliff was a little shelf by a tree, whereon they  clambered to pass the night.    They had had scarcely any food; it was not the time of year for berries,  and they had no time to go aside to snare or waylay. They tramped in a  hungry weary silence, gnawing at twigs and leaves. But over the surface  of the cliffs were a multitude of snails, and in a bush were the freshly  laid eggs of a little bird, and then Ugh-lomi threw at and killed a  squirrel in a beech-tree, so that at last they fed well. Ugh-lomi  watched during the night, his chin on his knees; and he heard young  foxes crying hard by, and the noise of mammoths down the gorge, and the  hyaenas yelling and laughing far away. It was chilly, but they dared not  light a fire. Whenever he dozed, his spirit went abroad, and straightway  met with the spirit of Uya, and they fought. And always Ugh-lomi was  paralysed so that he could not smite nor run, and then he would awake  suddenly. Eudena, too, dreamt evil things of Uya, so that they both  awoke with the fear of him in their hearts, and by the light of the dawn  they saw a woolly rhinoceros go blundering down the valley.    During the day they caressed one another and were glad of the sunshine,  and Eudena's leg was so stiff she sat on the ledge all day. Ugh-lomi  found great flints sticking out of the cliff face, greater than any he  had seen, and he dragged some to the ledge and began chipping, so as to  be armed against Uya when he came again. And at one he laughed heartily,  and Eudena laughed, and they threw it about in derision. It had a hole  in it. They stuck their fingers through it, it was very funny indeed.  Then they peeped at one another through it. Afterwards, Ugh-lomi got  himself a stick, and thrusting by chance at this foolish flint, the  stick went in and stuck there. He had rammed it in too tightly to  withdraw it. That was still stranger--scarcely funny, terrible almost,  and for a time Ugh-lomi did not greatly care to touch the thing. It was  as if the flint had bit and held with its teeth. But then he got  familiar with the odd combination. He swung it about, and perceived that  the stick with the heavy stone on the end struck a better blow than  anything he knew. He went to and fro swinging it, and striking with it;  but later he tired of it and threw it aside. In the afternoon he went  up over the brow of the white cliff, and lay watching by a rabbit-warren  until the rabbits came out to play. There were no men thereabouts, and  the rabbits were heedless. He threw a smiting-stone he had made and got  a kill.    That night they made a fire from flint sparks and bracken fronds, and  talked and caressed by it. And in their sleep Uya's spirit came again,  and suddenly, while Ugh-lomi was trying to fight vainly, the foolish  flint on the stick came into his hand, and he struck Uya with it, and  behold! it killed him. But afterwards came other dreams of Uya--for  spirits take a lot of killing, and he had to be killed again. Then after  that the stone would not keep on the stick. He awoke tired and rather  gloomy, and was sulky all the forenoon, in spite of Eudena's kindliness,  and instead of hunting he sat chipping a sharp edge to the singular  flint, and looking strangely at her. Then he bound the perforated flint  on to the stick with strips of rabbit skin. And afterwards he walked up  and down the ledge, striking with it, and muttering to himself, and  thinking of Uya. It felt very fine and heavy in the hand.    Several days, more than there was any counting in those days, five days,  it may be, or six, did Ugh-lomi and Eudena stay on that shelf in the  gorge of the river, and they lost all fear of men, and their fire burnt  redly of a night. And they were very merry together; there was food  every day, sweet water, and no enemies. Eudena's knee was well in a  couple of days, for those ancient savages had quick-healing flesh.  Indeed, they were very happy.    On one of those days Ugh-lomi dropped a chunk of flint over the cliff.  He saw it fall, and go bounding across the river bank into the river,  and after laughing and thinking it over a little he tried another. This  smashed a bush of hazel in the most interesting way. They spent all the  morning dropping stones from the ledge, and in the afternoon they  discovered this new and interesting pastime was also possible from the  cliffbrow. The next day they had forgotten this delight. Or at least, it  seemed they had forgotten.    But Uya came in dreams to spoil the paradise. Three nights he came  fighting Ugh-lomi. In the morning after these dreams Ugh-lomi would walk  up and down, threatening him and swinging the axe, and at last came the  night after Ugh-lomi brained the otter, and they had feasted. Uya went  too far. Ugh-lomi awoke, scowling under his heavy brows, and he took his  axe, and extending his hand towards Eudena he bade her wait for him  upon the ledge. Then he clambered down the white declivity, glanced up  once from the foot of it and flourished his axe, and without looking  back again went striding along the river bank until the overhanging  cliff at the bend hid him.    Two days and nights did Eudena sit alone by the fire on the ledge  waiting, and in the night the beasts howled over the cliffs and down the  valley, and on the cliff over against her the hunched hyaenas prowled  black against the sky. But no evil thing came near her save fear. Once,  far away, she heard the roaring of a lion, following the horses as they  came northward over the grass lands with the spring. All that time she  waited--the waiting that is pain.    And the third day Ugh-lomi came back, up the river. The plumes of a  raven were in his hair. The first axe was red-stained, and had long dark  hairs upon it, and he carried the necklace that had marked the favourite  of Uya in his hand. He walked in the soft places, giving no heed to his  trail. Save a raw cut below his jaw there was not a wound upon him.  \"Uya!\" cried Ugh-lomi exultant, and Eudena saw it was well. He put the  necklace on Eudena, and they ate and drank together. And after eating he  began to rehearse the whole story from the beginning, when Uya had cast  his eyes on Eudena, and Uya and Ugh-lomi, fighting in the forest, had  been chased by the bear, eking out his scanty words with abundant  pantomime, springing to his feet and whirling the stone axe round when  it came to the fighting. The last fight was a mighty one, stamping and  shouting, and once a blow at the fire that sent a torrent of sparks up  into the night. And Eudena sat red in the light of the fire,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27378"],[0,"The Story of the Heavens (#10)"],[1,"tituents. We are  enabled to do this with scientific accuracy when we employ that  remarkable key to Nature's secrets known as the spectroscope. The beams  of white sunlight consist of innumerable beams of every hue in intimate  association. Every shade of red, of yellow, of blue, and of green, can  be found in a sunbeam. The magician's wand, with which we strike the  sunbeam and sort the tangled skein into perfect order, is the simple  instrument known as the glass prism. We have represented this instrument  in its simplest form in the adjoining figure (Fig. 17). It is a piece of  pure and homogeneous glass in the shape of a wedge. When a ray of light  from the sun or from any source falls upon the prism, it passes through  the transparent glass and emerges on the other side; a remarkable change  is, however, impressed on the ray by the influence of the glass. It is  bent by refraction from the path it originally pursued, and is compelled  to follow a different path. If, however, the prism bent all rays of  light equally, then it would be of no service in the analysis of light;  but it fortunately happens that the prism acts with varying efficiency  on the rays of different hues. A red ray is not refracted so much as a  yellow ray; a yellow ray is not refracted so much as a blue one. It  consequently happens that when the composite beam of sunlight, in which  all the different rays are blended, passes through the prism, they  emerge in the manner shown in the annexed figure (Fig. 18). Here then we  have the source of the analysing power of the prism; it bends the  different hues unequally and consequently the beam of composite  sunlight, after passing through the prism, no longer shows mere white  light, but is expanded into a coloured band of light, with hues like the  rainbow, passing from deep red at one end through every intermediate  grade to the violet.    [Illustration: Fig. 18.--Dispersion of Light by the Prism.]    We have in the prism the means of decomposing the light from the sun, or  the light from any other source, into its component parts. The  examination of the quality of the light when analysed enables us to  learn something of the constitution of the body from which this light  has emanated. Indeed, in some simple cases the mere colour of a light  will be sufficient to indicate the source from which it has come. There  is, for instance, a splendid red light sometimes seen in displays of  fireworks, due to the metal strontium. The eye can identify the element  by the mere colour of the flame. There is also a characteristic yellow  light produced by the flame of common salt burned with spirits of wine.  Sodium is the important constituent of salt, so here we recognise  another substance merely by the colour it emits when burning. We may  also mention a third substance, magnesium, which burns with a brilliant  white light, eminently characteristic of the metal.    [Illustration: PLATE XIII.    SPECTRA OF THE SUN AND STARS.    I. SUN.  II. SIRIUS.  III. ALDEBARAN.  IV. BETELGEUZE.]    The three metals, strontium, sodium, and magnesium, may thus be  identified by the colours they produce when incandescent. In this simple  observation lies the germ of the modern method of research known as  spectrum analysis. We may now examine with the prism the colours of the  sun and the colours of the stars, and from this examination we can learn  something of the materials which enter into their composition. We are  not restricted to the use of merely a single prism, but we may arrange  that the light which it is desired to analyse shall pass through several  prisms in succession in order to increase the _dispersion_ or the  spreading out of the different colours. To enter the spectroscope the  light first passes through a narrow slit, and the rays are then rendered  parallel by passing through a lens; these parallel rays next pass  through one or more prisms, and are finally viewed through a small  telescope, or they may be intercepted by a photographic plate on which a  picture will then be made. If the beam of light passing through the slit  has radiated from an incandescent solid or liquid body, or from a gas  under high pressure, the coloured band or _spectrum_ is found to contain  all the colours indicated on Plate XIII., without any interruption  between the colours. This is known as a continuous spectrum. But if we  examine light from a gas under low pressure, as can be done by placing a  small quantity of the gas in a glass tube and making it glow by an  electric current, we find that it does not emit rays of all colours, but  only rays of certain distinct colours which are different for different  gases. The spectrum of a gas, therefore, consists of a number of  detached luminous lines.    When we study the sunlight through the prism, it is found that the  spectrum does not extend quite continuously from one end to the other,  but is shaded over by a multitude of dark lines, only a few of which are  shown in the adjoining plate. (Plate XIII.) These lines are a permanent  feature in the solar spectrum. They are as characteristic of the  sunlight as the prismatic colours themselves, and are full of interest  and information with regard to the sun. These lines are the characters  in which the history and the nature of the sun are written. Viewed  through an instrument of adequate power, dark lines are to be found  crossing the solar spectrum in hundreds and in thousands. They are of  every variety of strength and faintness; their distribution seems guided  by no simple law. At some parts of the spectrum there are but few lines;  in other regions they are crowded so closely together that it is  difficult to separate them. They are in some places exquisitely fine and  delicate, and they never fail to excite the admiration of every one who  looks at this interesting spectacle in a good instrument.    There can be no better method of expounding the rather difficult subject  of spectrum analysis than by actually following the steps of the  original discovery which first gave a clear demonstration of the  significance of the dark \"Fraunhofer\" lines. Let us concentrate our  attention specially upon that line of the solar spectrum marked D. This,  when seen in the spectroscope, is found to consist of two lines, very  delicately separated by a minute interval, one of these lines being  slightly thicker than the other. Suppose that while the attention is  concentrated on these lines the flame of an ordinary spirit-lamp  coloured by common salt be held in front of the instrument, so that the  ray of direct solar light passes through the flame before entering the  spectroscope. The observer sees at once the two lines known as D flash  out with a greatly increased blackness and vividness, while there is no  other perceptible effect on the spectrum. A few trials show that this  intensification of the D lines is due to the vapour of sodium arising  from the salt burning in the lamp through which the sunlight has passed.    It is quite impossible that this marvellous connection between sodium  and the D lines of the spectrum can be merely casual. Even if there were  only a single line concerned, it would be in the highest degree unlikely  that the coincidence should arise by accident; but when we find the  sodium affecting both of the two close lines which form D, our  conviction that there must be some profound connection between these  lines and sodium rises to absolute certainty. Suppose that the sunlight  be cut off, and that all other light is excluded save that emanating  from the glowing vapour of sodium in the spirit flame. We shall then  find, on looking through the spectroscope, that we no longer obtain all  the colours of the rainbow; the light from the sodium is concentrated  into two bright yellow lines, filling precisely the position which the  dark D lines occupied in the solar spectrum, and the darkness of which  the sodium flame seemed to intensify.    We must here endeavour to remove what may at first sight appear to be a  paradox. How is it, that though the sodium flame produces two _bright_  lines when viewed in the absence of other light, yet it actually appears  to intensify the two _dark_ lines in the sun's spectrum? The explanation  of this leads us at once to the cardinal doctrine of spectrum analysis.  The so-called dark lines in the solar spectrum are only dark _by  contrast_ with the brilliant illumination of the rest of the spectrum. A  good deal of solar light really lies in the dark lines, though not  enough to be seen when the eye is dazzled by the brilliancy around. When  the flame of the spirit-lamp charged with sodium intervenes, it sends  out a certain amount of light, which is entirely localised in these two  lines. So far it would seem that the influence of the sodium flame ought  to be manifested in diminishing the darkness of the lines and rendering  them less conspicuous. As a matter of fact, they are far more  conspicuous with the sodium flame than without it. This arises from the  fact that the sodium flame possesses the remarkable property of cutting  off the sunlight which was on its way to those particular lines; so  that, though the sodium contributes some light to the lines, yet it  intercepts a far greater quantity of the light that would otherwise have  illuminated those lines, and hence they became darker with the sodium  flame than without it.    We are thus conducted to a remarkable principle, which has led to the  interpretation of the dark lines in the spectrum of the sun. We find  that when the sodium vapour is heated, it gives out light of a very  particular type, which, viewed through the prism, is concentrated in two  lines. But the sodium vapour possesses also this property, that light  from the sun can pass through it without any perceptible absorption,  except of those particular rays which are of the same characters as the  two lines in question.
