It is manifestly expressive of their physical condition,  although we can not yet decipher its exact meaning.    The binary 42 Comae Berenicis is too close for ordinary telescopes, but  it is highly interesting as an intermediate between those pairs which  the telescope is able to separate and those--like beta Aurigae--which no  magnifying power can divide, but which reveal the fact that they are  double by the periodical splitting of their spectral lines. The orbit in  42 Comae Berenicis is a very small one, so that even when the components  are at their greatest distance apart they can not be separated by a  five-or six-inch glass. Burnham, using the Lick telescope, in 1890 made  the distance 0.7\"; Hall, using the Washington telescope, in 1891 made it  a trifle more than 0.5\". He had measured it in 1886 as only 0.27\". The  period of revolution is believed to be about twenty-five years.    In Coma Berenices there is an outlying field of the marvelous nebulous  region of Virgo, which we may explore on some future evening. But the  nebulae in Coma are very faint, and, for an amateur, hardly worth the  trouble required to pick them up. The two clusters included in the map,  2752 and 3453, are bright enough to repay inspection with our largest  aperture.    [Illustration: MAP NO. 7.]    Although Hydra is the largest constellation in the heavens, extending  about seven hours, or 105 deg., in right ascension, it contains  comparatively few objects of interest, and most of these are in the head  or western end of the constellation, which we examined during our first  night at the telescope. In the central portion of Hydra, represented on  map No. 7, we find its leading star alpha, sometimes called Alphard, or  Cor Hydrae, a bright second-magnitude star that has been suspected of  variability. It has a decided orange tint, and is accompanied, at a  distance of 281\", p. 153 deg., by a greenish tenth-magnitude star. Bu. 339  is a fine double, magnitudes eight and nine and a half, distance 1.3\",  p. 216 deg.. The planetary nebula 2102 is about 1' in diameter, pale blue in  color, and worth looking at, because it is brighter than most objects of  its class. Tempel and Secchi have given wonderful descriptions of it,  both finding multitudes of stars intermingled with nebulous matter.    For a last glimpse at celestial splendors for the night, let us turn to  the rich cluster 1630, in Argo, just above the place where the stream of  the Milky Way--here bright in mid-channel and shallowing toward the  shores--separates into two or three currents before disappearing behind  the horizon. It is by no means as brilliant as some of the star clusters  we have seen, but it gains in beauty and impressiveness from the  presence of one bright star that seems to captain a host of inferior  luminaries.          CHAPTER IV    VIRGO AND HER NEIGHBORS                         ... \"that region  Where still by night is seen  The Virgin goddess near to bright Booetes.\"--POSTE'S ARATUS.      [Illustration: MAP NO. 8.]    Following the order of right ascension, we come next to the little  constellations Crater and Corvus, which may be described as standing on  the curves of Hydra (map No. 8). Beginning with Crater, let us look  first at alpha, a yellow fourth-magnitude star, near which is a  celebrated red variable R. With a low power we can see both alpha and R  in the same field of view, like a very wide double. There is a third  star of ninth magnitude, and bluish in color, near R on the side toward  alpha. R is variable both in color and light. When reddest, it has been  described as \"scarlet,\" \"crimson,\" and \"blood-colored\"; when palest, it  is a deep orange-red. Its light variation has a period the precise  length of which is not yet known. The cycle of change is included  between the eighth and ninth magnitudes.    While our three-inch telescope suffices to show R, it is better to use  the five-inch, because of the faintness of the star. When the color is  well seen, the contrast with alpha is very pleasing.    There is hardly anything else in Crater to interest us, and we pass over  the border into Corvus, and go at once to its chief attraction, the star  delta. The components of this beautiful double are of magnitudes three  and eight; distance 24\", p. 211 deg.; colors yellow and purple.    The night being dark and clear, we take the five-inch and turn it on the  nebula 3128, which the map shows just under the border of Corvus in the  edge of Hydra. Herschel believed he had resolved this into stars. It is  a faint object and small, not exceeding one eighth of the moon's  diameter.    Farther east in Hydra, as indicated near the left-hand edge of map No.  8, is a somewhat remarkable variable, R Hydrae. This star occasionally  reaches magnitude three and a half, while at minimum it is not much  above the tenth magnitude. Its period is about four hundred and  twenty-five days.    [Illustration: MAP NO. 9.]    While we have been examining these comparatively barren regions, glad to  find one or two colored doubles to relieve the monotony of the search, a  glittering white star has frequently drawn our eyes eastward and upward.  It is Spica, the great gem of Virgo, and, yielding to its attraction, we  now enter the richer constellation over which it presides (map No. 9).  Except for its beauty, which every one must admire, Spica, or alpha  Virginis, has no special claim upon our attention. Some evidence has  been obtained that, like beta Aurigae and Capella, it revolves with an  invisible companion of great mass in an orbit only six million miles in  diameter. Spica's spectrum resembles that of Sirius. The faint star  which our larger apertures show about 6' northeast of Spica is of the  tenth magnitude.    Sweeping westward, we come upon Sigma 1669, a pretty little double with  nearly equal components of about the sixth magnitude, distance 5.6\", p.  124 deg.. But our interest is not fully aroused until we reach gamma, a star  with a history. The components of this celebrated binary are both  nearly of the third magnitude, distance about 5.8\", p. 150 deg.. They  revolve around their common center in something less than two hundred  years. According to some authorities, the period is one hundred and  seventy years, but it is not yet certainly ascertained. It was noticed  about the beginning of the seventeenth century that gamma Virginis was  double. In 1836 the stars were so close together that no telescope then  in existence was able to separate them, although it is said that the  disk into which they had merged was elongated at Pulkowa. In a few years  they became easily separable once more. If the  one-hundred-and-seventy-year period is correct, they should continue to  get farther apart until about 1921. According to Asaph Hall, their  greatest apparent distance is 6.3\", and their least apparent distance  0.5\"; consequently, they will never again close up beyond the separating  power of existing telescopes.    There is a great charm in watching this pair of stars even with a  three-inch telescope--not so much on account of what is seen, although  they are very beautiful, as on account of what we know they are doing.  It is no slight thing to behold two distant stars obeying the law that  makes a stone fall to the ground and compels the earth to swing round  the sun.    In theta we discover a fine triple, magnitudes four and a half, nine,  and ten; distances 7\", p. 345 deg., and 65\", p. 295 deg.. The ninth-magnitude  star has been described as \"violet,\" but such designations of color are  often misleading when the star is very faint. On the other hand it  should not be assumed that a certain color does not exist because the  observer can not perceive it, for experience shows that there is a wide  difference among observers in the power of the eye to distinguish color.  I have known persons who could not perceive the difference of hue in  some of the most beautifully contrasted colored doubles to be found in  the sky. I am acquainted with an astronomer of long experience in the  use of telescopes, whose eye is so deficient in color sense that he  denies that there are any decided colors among the stars. Such persons  miss one of the finest pleasures of the telescope. In examining theta  Virginis we shall do best to use our largest aperture, viz., the  five-inch. Yet Webb records that all three of the stars in this triple  have been seen with a telescope of only three inches aperture. The  amateur must remember in such cases how much depends upon practice as  well as upon the condition of the atmosphere. There are lamentably few  nights in a year when even the best telescope is ideally perfect in  performance, but every night's observation increases the capacity of the  eye, begetting a kind of critical judgment which renders it to some  extent independent of atmospheric vagaries. It will also be found that  the idiosyncrasies of the observer are reflected in his instrument,  which seems to have its fits of excellence, its inspirations so to  speak, while at other times it behaves as if all its wonderful powers  had departed.    Another double that perhaps we had better not try with less than four  inches aperture is 84 Virginis. The magnitudes are six and nine;  distance, 3.5\", p. 233 deg.. Colors yellow and blue. Sigma 1846 is a  fifth-magnitude star with a tenth-magnitude companion, distance only 4\",  p. 108 deg.. Use the five-inch.    And now we approach something that is truly marvelous, the \"Field of the  Nebulae.\" This strange region, lying mostly in the constellation Virgo,  is roughly outlined by the stars beta, eta, gamma, delta, and epsilon,  which form two sides of a square some 15 deg. across. It extends, however,  for some distance into Coma Berenices, while outlying nebulae belonging  to it are also to be found in the eastern part of Leo. Unfortunately  for those who expect only brilliant "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28764"],[0,"Getting Acquainted with the Trees (#10)"],[1," these days of springing life outside!--made a closer inspection  impossible then, but a golden Saturday afternoon found three of us, of  like ideals, hastening to this tree and plant paradise. A mass of soft  yellow drew us from the highway across a field carpeted thickly with  bluet or \"quaker lady,\" to the edge of the stream, where a continuous  hum showed that the bees were also attracted. It was one splendid willow  in full bloom, and I could not and as yet cannot safely say whether it  is the crack willow or the white willow; but I can affirm of a certainty  that it was a delight to the eye, the mind and the nostrils. The extreme  fragility of the smaller twigs, which broke away from the larger limbs  at the lightest shake or jar, gave evidence of one of Nature's ways of  distributing plant life; for it seems that these twigs, as I have  previously said, part company with the parent tree most readily, float  away on the stream, and easily establish themselves on banks and bars,  where their tough, interlacing roots soon form an almost impregnable  barrier to the onslaught of the flood. Only a stone's throw away there  stood a great old black willow, with a sturdy trunk of ebon hue, crowned  with a mass of soft green leafage, lighter where the breeze lifted up  the under side to the sunlight. Many times, doubtless, the winds had  shorn and the sleet had rudely trimmed this old veteran, but there  remained full life and vigor, even more attractive than that of youth.    Most of the willows are shrubs rather than trees, and there are endless  variations, as I have before remarked. Further, the species belonging at  first in the Eastern Hemisphere have spread well over our own side of  the globe, so that it seems odd to regard the white willow and the  weeping willow as foreigners. At Niagara Falls, in the beautiful park on  the American side, on the islands amid the toss of the waters, there are  many willows, and those planted by man are no less beautiful than those  resulting from Nature's gardening. In spring I have had pleasure in some  splendid clumps of a form with lovely golden leaves and a small, furry  catkin, found along the edge of the American rapids. I wonder, by the  way, how many visitors to Niagara take note of the superb collection of  plants and trees there to be seen, and which it is a grateful relief to  consider when the mind is wearied with the majesty and the vastness of  Nature's forces shown in the cataract? The birds are visitors to Goat  Island and the other islets that divide the Niagara River, and they have  brought there the plants of America in wonderful variety.    [Illustration: A white willow in a characteristic position]    There is one willow that has been used by the nurserymen to produce a  so-called weeping form, which, like most of these monstrosities, is not  commendable. The goat willow is a vigorous tree introduced from Europe,  having large and rather broad and coarse leaves, dark green above and  whitish underneath. It is taken as a \"stock,\" upon which, at a  convenient height, the skilled juggler with trees grafts a drooping or  pendulous form known as the Kilmarnock willow, thus changing the habit  of the tree so that it then \"weeps\" to the ground. Fortunately, the  original tree sometimes triumphs, the graft dies, and a lusty goat  willow rears a rather shapely head to the sky.    This Kilmarnock willow is a favorite of the peripatetic tree agent, and  I have enjoyed hugely one notable evidence of his persuasive eloquence  to be seen in a Lebanon Valley town, inhabited by the quaint folk known  as Pennsylvania Germans. All along the line of the railroad traversing  this valley may be seen these distorted willows decorating the prim  front yards, and they are not so offensive when used with other shrubs  and trees. In this one instance, however, the tree agent evidently found  a customer who was persuaded that if one Kilmarnock willow was a good  thing to have, a dozen of them was twelve times better; wherefore his  dooryard is grotesquely adorned with that many flourishing weepers,  giving an aspect that is anything but decorous or solemn. Some time the  vigilance of the citizen will be relaxed, it may be hoped; he will  neglect to cut away the recurring shoots of the parent trees, and they  will escape and destroy the weeping form which provides so much  sarcastic hilarity for the passers-by.    The willow, with its blood relation, the poplar, is often \"pollarded,\"  or trimmed for wood, and its abundant vigor enables it to recover from  this process of violent abbreviation more satisfactorily than do most  trees. The result is usually a disproportionately large stem or bole,  for the lopping off of great branches always tends to a thickening of  the main stem. The abundant leafage of both willow and poplar soon  covers the scars, and there is less cause to mourn than in the case of  maples or other \"hard-wooded\" trees.    If my readers will only add a willow section to their mental observation  outfit, there will be much more to see and appreciate. Look for and  enjoy in the winter the variation in twig color and bark hue; notice how  smoothly lies the covering on one stem, all rugged and marked on  another. In the earliest spring examine the swelling buds, of widely  differing color and character, from which shortly will spring forth the  catkins or aments of bloom, followed by the leaves of varied colors in  the varied species, and with shapes as varied. Vivid green, soft gray,  greenish yellow; dull surface and shining surface above, pale green to  almost pure white beneath; from the long and stringy leaf of the weeping  willow to the comparatively broad and thick leaf of the  pussy-willow--there is variety and interest in the foliage well worth  the attention of the tree-lover. When winter comes, there will be  another set of contrasts to see in the way the various species lose  their leaves and get ready for the rest time during which the buds  mature and ripen, and the winter colors again shine forth.    [Illustration: Clump of young white willows]    These observations may be made anywhere in America, practically, for the  willow is almost indifferent to locality, growing everywhere that its  far-reaching roots can find the moisture which it loves, and which it  rapidly transpires to the thirsty air. As Miss Keeler well remarks, \"The  genus Salix is admirably fitted to go forth and inhabit the earth, for  it is tolerant of all soils and asks only water. It creeps nearer to the  North Pole than any other woody plant except its companion the birch. It  trails upon the ground or rises one hundred feet in the air. In North  America it follows the water-courses to the limit of the temperate zone,  enters the tropics, crosses the equator, and appears in the mountains of  Peru and Chili.... The books record one hundred and sixty species in the  world, and these sport and hybridize to their own content and to the  despair of botanists. Then, too, it comes of an ancient line; for  impressions of leaves in the cretaceous rocks show that it is one of the  oldest of plants.\"    Common it is, and therefore overlooked; but the reader may well resolve  to watch the willow in spring and summer, with its bloom and fruit; to  follow its refreshing color through winter's chill; to observe its cheer  and dignity; and to see the wind toss its slender wands and turn its  graceful leaves.    The poplars and the willows are properly considered together, for  together they form the botanical world family of the _Salicaceae_. Many  characteristics of bloom and growth, of sap and bark, unite the two, and  surely both, though alike common to the world, are common and familiar  trees to the dwellers in North America.    [Illustration: White poplars in spring-time]    One of my earliest tree remembrances has to do with a spreading  light-leaved growth passed under every day on the way to school--and,  like most school-boys, I was not unwilling to stop for anything of  interest that might put off arrival at the seat of learning. This great  tree had large and peculiar winter buds, that always seemed to have  advance information as to the coming of spring, for they would swell out  and become exceedingly shiny at the first touch of warm sun. Soon the  sun-caressing would be responded to by the bursting of the buds, or the  falling away of their ingenious outer protecting scales, which dropped  to the ground, where, sticky and shining, and extraordinarily aromatic  in odor, they were just what a curious school-boy enjoyed investigating.  \"Balm of Gilead\" was the name that inquiry brought for this tree, and  the resinous and sweet-smelling buds which preceded the rather  inconspicuous catkins or aments of bloom seemed to justify the Biblical  designation.    Nearly a world tree is this poplar, which in some one of its variable  forms is called also tacamahac, and balsam poplar as well. Its cheerful  upright habit, really fine leaves and generally pleasing air commend it,  but there is one trouble--it is almost too vigorous and anxious to  spread, which it does by means of shoots or \"suckers,\" upspringing from  its wide area of root-growth, thus starting a little forest of its own  that gives other trees but small chance. But on a street, where the  repression of pavements and sidewalks interferes with this exuberance,  the balsam poplar is well worth planting.    The poplars as a family are pushing and energetic growers, and serve a  great purpose in the reforestation of American acres that have been  carelessly denuded of their tree cover. Here the trembling aspen  particularly, as the commonest form of all is named, comes in to quickly  cover and shade the ground, and give aid to the hard woods and the  conifers that form the value of the forest growth.    This same American aspen, a consideration of the lightly hung leaves of  which has been useful to many poets, is a well-known"]]]
