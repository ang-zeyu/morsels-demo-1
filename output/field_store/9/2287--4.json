Ranges from Nova Scotia and  lower St. Lawrence River, southward, mostly in the coast region to  Delaware, and westward through northern New England and New York to  southern shore of Lake Ontario.    =15. Yellow Birch= (_Betula lutea_) (Gray Birch, Silver Birch). Medium-  to large-sized tree, very common. Heartwood light reddish brown,  sapwood nearly white, close-grained, compact structure, with a satiny  luster. Wood heavy, very strong, hard, tough, susceptible of high  polish, not durable when exposed. Is similar to _Betula lenta_, and  finds a place in practically all kinds of woodenware. A large  percentage of broom handles on the market are made of this species of  wood, though nearly every other birch contributes something. It is  used for veneer plates and dishes made for pies, butter, lard, and  many other commodities. Tubs and pails are sometimes made of yellow  birch provided weight is not objectionable. The wood is twice as heavy  as some of the pines and cedars. Many small handles for such articles  as flatirons, gimlets, augers, screw drivers, chisels, varnish and  paint brushes, butcher and carving knives, etc. It is also widely used  for shipping boxes, baskets, and crates, and it is one of the  stiffest, strongest woods procurable, but on account of its excessive  weight it is sometimes discriminated against. It is excellent for  veneer boxes, and that is probably one of the most important places it  fills. Citrus fruit from northern Africa and the islands and countries  of the Mediterranean is often shipped to market in boxes made of  yellow birch from veneer cut in New England. The better grades are  also used for furniture and cabinet work, and the \"burls\" found on  this species are highly valued for making fancy articles, gavels, etc.  It is extensively used for turnery, buttons, spools, bobbins, wheel  hubs, etc. Maine to Minnesota and southward to Tennessee.    =16. Red Birch= (_Betula rubra_ var. _nigra_) (River Birch). Small to  medium-sized tree, very common. Lighter and less valuable than the  preceding. Heartwood light brown, sapwood pale. Wood light, fairly  strong and close-grained. Red birch is best developed in the middle  South, and usually grows near the banks of rivers. Its bark hangs in  tatters, even worse than that of paper birch, but it is darker. In  Tennessee the slack coopers have found that red birch makes excellent  barrel heads and it is sometimes employed in preference to other  woods. In eastern Maryland the manufacturers of peach baskets draw  their supplies from this wood, and substitute it for white elm in  making the hoops or bands which stiffen the top of the basket, and  provide a fastening for the veneer which forms the sides. Red birch  bends in a very satisfactory manner, which is an important point. This  wood enters pretty generally into the manufacture of woodenware within  its range, but statistics do not mention it by name. It is also used  in the manufacture of veneer picnic plates, pie plates, butter dishes,  washboards, small handles, kitchen and pantry utensils, and ironing  boards. New England to Texas and Missouri.    =17. Canoe Birch= (_Betula paprifera_) (White Birch, Paper Birch). Small  to medium-sized tree, sometimes forming forests, very common.  Heartwood light brown tinged with red, sapwood lighter color. Wood of  good quality, but light, fairly hard and strong, tough, close-grained.  Sap flows freely in spring and by boiling can be made into syrup. Not  as valuable as any of the preceding. Canoe birch is a northern tree,  easily identified by its white trunk and its ragged bark. Large  numbers of small wooden boxes are made by boring out blocks of this  wood, shaping them in lathes, and fitting lids on them. Canoe birch is  one of the best woods for this class of commodities, because it can be  worked very thin, does not split readily, and is of pleasing color.  Such boxes, or two-piece diminutive kegs, are used as containers for  articles shipped and sold in small bulk, such as tacks, small nails,  and brads. Such containers are generally cylindrical and of  considerably greater depth than diameter. Many others of nearly  similar form are made to contain ink bottles, bottles of perfumery,  drugs, liquids, salves, lotions, and powders of many kinds. Many boxes  of this pattern are used by manufacturers of pencils and crayons for  packing and shipping their wares. Such boxes are made in numerous  numbers by automatic machinery. A single machine of the most improved  pattern will turn out 1,400 boxes an hour. After the boring and  turning are done, they are smoothed by placing them into a tumbling  barrel with soapstone. It is also used for one-piece shallow trays or  boxes, without lids, and used as card receivers, pin receptacles,  butter boxes, fruit platters, and contribution plates in churches. It  is also the principal wood used for spools, bobbins, bowls, shoe  lasts, pegs, and turnery, and is also much used in the furniture  trade. All along the northern boundary of the United States and  northward, from the Atlantic to the Pacific.                             BLACK WALNUT (See Walnut)                                    BLUE BEECH    =18. Blue Beech= (_Carpinus Caroliniana_) (Hornbeam, Water Beech,  Ironwood). Small-sized tree. Heartwood light brown, sapwood nearly  white. Wood very hard, heavy, strong, very stiff, of rather fine  texture, not durable in contact with the soil, shrinks and checks  considerably in drying, but works well and stands well, and takes a  fine polish. Used chiefly in turnery, for tool handles, etc. Abroad  much used by mill-and wheelwrights. A small tree, largest in the  Southwest, but found in nearly all parts of the eastern United States.                           BOIS D'ARC (See Osage Orange)                                      BUCKEYE    Wood light, soft, not strong, often quite tough, of fine, uniform  texture and creamy white color. It shrinks considerably in drying, but  works well and stands well. Used for woodenware, artificial limbs,  paper pulp, and locally also for building construction.    =19. Ohio Buckeye= (_AEsculus glabra_) (Horse Chestnut, Fetid Buckeye).  Small-sized tree, scattered, never forming forests. Heartwood white,  sapwood pale brown. Wood light, soft, not strong, often quite tough  and close-grained. Alleghanies, Pennsylvania to Oklahoma.    =20. Sweet Buckeye= (_AEsculus octandra_ var. _flava_) (Horse Chestnut).  Small-sized tree, scattered, never forming forests. Wood in its  quality and uses similar to the preceding. Alleghanies, Pennsylvania  to Texas.                                    BUCKTHORNE    =21. Buckthorne= (_Rhanmus Caroliniana_) (Indian Cherry). Small-sized  tree. Heartwood light brown, sapwood almost white. Wood light, hard,  close-grained. Does not enter the markets to any great extent. Found  along the borders of streams in rich bottom lands. Its northern limits  is Long Island, where it is only a shrub; it becomes a tree only in  southern Arkansas and adjoining regions.                                     BUTTERNUT    =22. Butternut= (_Juglans cinerea_) (White Walnut, White Mahogany,  Walnut). Medium-sized tree, scattered, never forming forests. Wood  very similar to black walnut, but light, quite soft, and not strong.  Heartwood light gray-brown, darkening with exposure; sapwood nearly  white, coarse-grained, compact structure, easily worked, and  susceptible to high polish. Has similar grain to black walnut and when  stained is a very good imitation. Is much used for inside work, and  very durable. Used chiefly for finishing lumber, cabinet work, boat  finish and fixtures, and for furniture. Butternut furniture is often  sold as circassian walnut. Largest and most common in the Ohio basin.  Maine to Minnesota and southward to Georgia and Alabama.                                      CATALPA    The catalpa is a tree which was planted about 25 years ago as a  commercial speculation in Iowa, Kansas, and Nebraska. Its native  habitat was along the rivers Ohio and lower Wabash, and a century ago  it gained a reputation for rapid growth and durability, but did not  grow in large quantities. As a railway tie, experiments have left no  doubt as to its resistance to decay; it stands abrasion as well as the  white oak (_Quercus alba_), and is superior to it in longevity.  Catalpa is a tree singularly free from destructive diseases. Wood cut  from the living tree is one of the most durable timbers known. In  spite of its light porous structure it resists the weathering  influences and the attacks of wood-destroying fungi to a remarkable  degree. No fungus has yet been found which will grow in the dead  timber, and for fence posts this wood has no equal, lasting longer  than almost any other species of timber. The wood is rather soft and  coarse in texture, the tree is of slow growth, and the brown colored  heartwood, even of very young trees, forms nearly three-quarters of  their volume. There is only about one-quarter inch of sapwood in a  9-inch tree.    =23. Catalpa= (_Catalpa speciosa_ var. _bignonioides_) (Indian Bean).  Medium-sized tree. Heartwood light brown, sapwood nearly white. Wood  light, soft, not strong, brittle, very durable in contact with the  soil, of coarse texture. Used chiefly for railway ties, telegraph  poles, and fence posts, but well suited for a great variety of uses.  Lower basin of the Ohio River, locally common. Extensively planted,  and therefore promising to become of some importance.                                      CHERRY    =24. Cherry= (_Prunus serotina_) (Wild Cherry, Black Cherry, Rum  Cherry). Wood heavy, hard, strong, of fine texture. Sapwood yellowish  white, heartwood reddish to brown. The wood shrinks considerably in  drying, works well and stands well, has a fine satin-like luster, and  takes a fine polish which somewhat resembles mahogany,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26600"],[0,"Mother Earth, Vol. 1 No. 1, March 1906 (#10)"],[1,"and in no way disputing the right of one man to exploit  another and leaving untouched the basic principle of Socialism, real  Socialism, the right of labor to the fruits of its toil.    Under conditions such as those described, is it to be wondered at that  many Anarchists are frankly cynical as to the benefits labor will derive  from the labor parties? There will be at least two, that have suddenly  forced the gilded doors of the \"Mother of Parliaments\" and about which  the guilty middle class grew nervous. We know that men like T. Burt, H.  Broadhurst, W. Abraham, F. Madison and a score of others are but  nominal labor men not having worked at their various trades for years  and are middle class by training and income, that others like Keir  Hardie, J. R. MacDonald, John Ward and many more are at best labor  politicians so steeped in political bargaining and compromising that the  net results to labor from them will be very small indeed. It is not  necessary nor would it be just to question the honesty or well-meaning  of many of the forty-three labor members, to prove that a distinct  disappointment awaits those who elected them. Past history foretells the  future clearly enough. We have seen John Burns, hero of the Dock Strike,  who entered Parliament as a Revolutionary Socialist, becoming in a few  short years as docile as a lamb to those above him in power and as  autocratic as a Russian provincial governor to those who needed his  assistance, finally enter a Liberal Cabinet with the \"hero of  Featherstone,\" H. H. Asquith, by whose orders striking miners were shot  down in real American fashion, Sir Edward Grey, and other Jingo  Imperialists--and the end is not yet. There are our other friends (?).  H. Broadhurst, special favorite of the King; W. Abraham, ex-coal miner,  who so endeared himself to the coal operators of Wales in his capacity  as official of the Miners' Union and Scale Committee that when his  daughter was married several years ago she received a cheque for L100  from one of the aforesaid operators, and others whom space forbids  mentioning. Such is the material of which the labor parties now in the  House of Commons is formed, and it requires a violent stretch of  imagination to see any real, lasting benefit can accrue from the  forty-three men now sitting there as representatives of the oppressed  masses. An inability to see this, however, by no means implies a lack of  inherent good in the formation of the Labor Representation Committee and  the Miners' Federation, their fraternization with the Socialists and the  forces which impelled that organization and fraternization. It is the  agitation which preceded it, and we hope will continue, and the growing  desire on the part of the workers for a larger share of the product of  their toil and a part in the management of industry that we see hope.  The form that movement has taken or the beneficial results from the  efforts of the elected are details. It is scarcely five years since the  Labor Representation Committee sprang into existence, and it says much  for the solidarity of labor that over a million trade unionists,  thirteen thousand members of the Independent Labor Party and eight  hundred Fabians could be got together on a political program in so short  a time.    For good or ill the British workingman has gone in for political action  and will have a try at that before he listens to the Anarchists. Slow of  thought and used to compromise, he is a stern taskmaker and will exact a  rigid account of the stewardship entrusted to those who sought his  suffrage. When the disillusionment comes, as it surely will, real  progress may come. The process of disillusionment does not come with  geometrical precision. To some it comes over night, to others it is a  process of years, and to some it is denied altogether. For years the  Anarchists have been scoffed at as impossible dreamers for advocating  the General Strike as the only effective means of overthrowing the  present system. The glorious fight of the Russian people for freedom has  changed all this, and we find even Bebel threatening the German  Government with a general strike if they attempt to withdraw the  franchise; and Hyndman, who opposed it for years, has finally admitted  its effectiveness. The effect has been felt in Great Britain in the  shape of the unemployed agitations and demonstrations, and although  temporarily allayed by the elections, it will blossom forth again.    If the advent of the Liberal party to power, backed by the Home Rule and  Labor parties, causes an undoing of the harm of the Balfour-Chamberlain  government, it will be more than can reasonably be expected. The trade  unions can never be restored to quite the same legal immunity they had  previously. The forty thousand Chinese imported into South Africa to  take the places of white miners will remain even if no more are brought  in. The Education Act, passed with the assistance of the Irish  Archbishops and attacking secular education, will be amended and not  repealed. The endowment of the brewers will continue, and my Lords Bass,  Burton and the rest will merely await future opportunities to plunder  the British public. In short, little constructive legislation, even of  that mild and tentative character one might expect from a Liberal party,  made up of capitalistic units can be expected after the ten years of  corrupt and extravagant rule of this band of modern pirates.    They who advocate the complete reconstruction of society are under no  illusions as to the time and trouble required to overcome the  superstitions of the past. Being imbued, however, with the belief in  what Christians call \"the eternal righteousness of their cause,\" they  meet the future with smiling face; and far from being downcast over the  turn of events in Great Britain, see hope in the formation of the Labor  Parties.    [Illustration]          AND YOU?    BOLTON HALL      \"What would you do,\" asked the Idealist, \"if you were Czar of Russia?\"    \"I would first abolish monopoly of land, for that is fundamental,\" said  the Reformer, \"and then resign. What would you do?\"    \"I would first resign, and then teach the people to abolish monopoly of  land, the same as now,\" answered the Idealist. \"But what would you do,  Teacher?\"    \"I would teach the people from the throne that they were oppressed by  their system of monopoly--and by their Czar.\"          NATIONAL ATAVISM    BY INTERNATIONALIST      The Jewish circles in New York, Boston, Philadelphia and other cities of  America are aroused over the visit of a spectre called Nationalism,  alias Territorialism. Like all spectres, it is doing a lot of mischief  and causing much confusion in the heads of the Jewish population.    The spirit of our ancestor, Abraham, has come to life again. Like  Abraham, when Jehovah commanded him to go in quest of the promised land,  the Jewish Nationalists make themselves and others believe that they  long for the moment, when with wife and child and all possessions, they  will migrate to that spot on earth, which will represent the Jewish  State, where Jewish traits will have a chance to develop in idyllic  peace.    Natural science calls retrogression of species, which shows signs of a  former state already overcome, atavism. The same term may be applied to  the advanced section of the Jewish population, which has listened to the  call of the Nationalists. They have retrogressed from a universal view  of things to a philosophy fenced in by boundary lines; from the glorious  conception that \"the world is my country\" to the conception of  exclusiveness. They have abridged their wide vision and have made it  narrow and superficial.    The Zionism of Max Nordau and his followers never was more than a  sentimental sport for the well-to-do in the ranks of the Jews. The  latter-day Nationalists, however, are bent on reaching those circles of  the Jewish race that have so far followed the banner of Internationalism  and Revolution; and this at a moment when revolutionists of all  nationalities and races are most in need of unity and solidarity.  Nothing could be more injurious to the Russian revolution, nothing prove  a lack of confidence in its success, so much as the present  nationalistic agitation.    The most encouraging and glorious feature of revolutions is that they  purify the atmosphere from the thick, poisonous vapors of prejudices and  superstition.    From time immemorial revolutions have been the only hope and refuge of  all the oppressed from national and social yokes. The radical  nationalistic elements seem to have forgotten that all their enthusiasm,  their faith and hope in the power of a great social change, now falters  before the question: Will it give us our own territory where we can  surround ourselves with walls and watch-towers? Yes, the very people,  who once spoke with a divine fire of the beauty of the solidarity of all  individuals and all peoples, now indulge in the shallow phrases that the  Jew is powerless, that he is nowhere at home, and that he owns no place  on earth, where he can do justice to his nature, and that he must first  obtain national rights, like all nations, ere he can go further.    These lamentations contain more fiction than truth, more sentimentality  than logic.    The Poles have their own territory; still this fact does not hinder  Russia from brutalizing Poland or from flogging and killing her  children; neither does it hinder the Prussian government from  maltreating her Polish subjects and forcibly obliterating the Polish  language. And of what avail is native territory to the small nations of  the Balkans, with Russian, Turkish and Austrian influences keeping them  in a helpless and dependent condition. Various raids and expeditions by  the powerful neighboring states forced on them, have proven what little  protection their territorial independence has given them against brutal"]]]
