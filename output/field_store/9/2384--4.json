This belief presupposes not  only a power opposed to God, and that God is not All-  in-all, as the Scriptures imply Him to be, but that the  capacity to err proceeds from God.    That God is Truth, the Scriptures aver; that Truth [30]  never created error, or such a capacity, is self-evident;    [Page 50.]    that God made all that was made, is again Scriptural; [1]  therefore your answer is, that error is an illusion of  mortals; that God is not its author, and it cannot be  real.    _Does __\"__Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures__\"_ [5]  _explain the entire method of metaphysical healing, or is_  _there a secret back of what is contained in that book, as_  _some say?_    \"Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures\"  is a complete textbook of Christian Science; and its [10]  metaphysical method of healing is as lucid in presenta-  tion as can be possible, under the necessity to express  the metaphysical in physical terms. There is absolutely  no additional secret outside of its teachings, or that gives  one the power to heal; but it is essential that the student [15]  gain the spiritual understanding of the contents of this  book, in order to heal.    _Do you believe in change of heart?_    We do believe, and understand--which is more--  that there must be a change from human affections, de- [20]  sires, and aims, to the divine standard, \"Be ye therefore  perfect;\" also, that there must be a change from the be-  lief that the heart is matter and sustains life, to the  understanding that God is our Life, that we exist in  Mind, live thereby, and have being. This change of [25]  heart would deliver man from heart-disease, and ad-  vance Christianity a hundredfold. The human affections  need to be changed from self to benevolence and love  for God and man; changed to having but _one_ God and  loving Him supremely, and helping our brother man. [30]    [Page 51.]    This change of heart is essential to Christianity, and [1]  will have its effect physically as well as spiritually,  healing disease. Burnt offerings and drugs, God does  not require.    _Is a belief of nervousness, accompanied by great mental_ [5]  _depression, mesmerism?_    All mesmerism is of one of three kinds; namely, the  ignorant, the fraudulent, or the malicious workings of  error or mortal mind. We have not the particulars of  the case to which you may refer, and for this reason can- [10]  not answer your question professionally.    _How can I govern a child metaphysically? Doesn't the_  _use of the rod teach him life in matter?_    The use of the rod is virtually a declaration to the  child's mind that sensation belongs to matter. Motives [15]  govern acts, and Mind governs man. If you make clear  to the child's thought the right motives for action, and  cause him to love them, they will lead him aright: if you  educate him to love God, good, and obey the Golden  Rule, he will love and obey you without your having to [20]  resort to corporeal punishment.          \"\"When from the lips of Truth one mighty breath      Shall, like a whirlwind, scatter in its breeze      The whole dark pile of human mockeries;      Then shall the reign of Mind commence on earth, [25]      And starting fresh, as from a second birth,      Man in the sunshine of the world's new spring,      Shall walk transparent like some holy thing.\"      _Are both prayer and drugs necessary to heal?_    The apostle James said, \"Ye ask, and receive not, [30]  because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your    [Page 52.]    lusts.\" This text may refer to such as seek the material [1]  to aid the spiritual, and take drugs to support God's  power to heal them. It is difficult to say how much  one can do for himself, whose faith is divided be-  tween catnip and Christ; but not so difficult to know [5]  that if he were to serve one master, he could do vastly  more. Whosoever understands the power of Spirit, has  no doubt of God's power,--even the might of Truth,--  to heal, through divine Science, beyond all human means  and methods. [10]    _What do you think of marriage?_    That it is often convenient, sometimes pleasant, and  occasionally a love affair. Marriage is susceptible of  many definitions. It sometimes presents the most  wretched condition of human existence. To be normal, [15]  it must be a union of the affections that tends to lift  mortals higher.    _If this life is a dream not dispelled, but only changed,_  _by death,--if one gets tired of it, why not commit_  _suicide?_ [20]    Man's existence is a problem to be wrought in divine  Science. What progress would a student of science  make, if, when tired of mathematics or failing to dem-  onstrate one rule readily, he should attempt to work  out a rule farther on and more difficult--and this, [25]  because the first rule was not easily demonstrated? In  that case he would be obliged to turn back and work  out the previous example, before solving the advanced  problem. Mortals have the sum of being to work out,  and up, to its spiritual standpoint. They must work [30]    [Page 53.]    out of this dream or false claim of sensation and life [1]  in matter, and up to the spiritual realities of existence,  before this false claim can be wholly dispelled. Com-  mitting suicide to dodge the question is not working  it out. The error of supposed life and intelligence in [5]  matter, is dissolved only as we master error with Truth.  Not through sin or suicide, but by _overcoming_ tempta-  tion and sin, shall we escape the weariness and wicked-  ness of mortal existence, and gain heaven, the harmony  of being. [10]    _Do you sometimes find it advisable to use medicine to_  _assist in producing a cure, when it is difficult to start the_  _patient's recovery?_    You only weaken your power to heal through Mind,  by any compromise with matter; which is virtually ac- [15]  knowledging that under difficulties the former is not equal  to the latter. He that resorts to physics, seeks what is  below instead of above the standard of metaphysics;  showing his ignorance of the meaning of the term and  of Christian Science. [20]    _If Christian Science is the same as Jesus taught, why is_  _it not more simple, so that all can readily understand it?_    The teachings of Jesus were simple; and yet he found  it difficult to make the rulers understand, because of  their great lack of spirituality. Christian Science is [25]  simple, and readily understood by the children; only  the thought educated away from it finds it abstract or  difficult to perceive. Its seeming abstraction is the  mystery of godliness; and godliness is simple to the  godly; but to the unspiritual, the ungodly, it is dark [30]    [Page 54.]    and difficult. The carnal mind cannot discern spiritual [1]  things.    _Has Mrs. Eddy lost her power to heal?_    Has the sun forgotten to shine, and the planets to  revolve around it? Who is it that discovered, dem- [5]  onstrated, and teaches Christian Science? That one,  whoever it be, does understand something of what can-  not be lost. Thousands in the field of metaphysical  healing, whose lives are worthy testimonials, are her  students, and they bear witness to this fact. Instead [10]  of losing her power to heal, she is demonstrating the  power of Christian Science over all obstacles that envy  and malice would fling in her path. The reading of her  book, \"Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,\"  is curing hundreds at this very time; and the sick, un- [15]  asked, are testifying thereto.    _Must I study your Science in order to keep well all my_  _life? I was healed of a chronic trouble after one month's_  _treatment by one of your students._    When once you are healed by Science, there is no rea- [20]  son why you should be liable to a return of the disease  that you were healed of. But not to be subject again to  any disease whatsoever, would require an understanding  of the Science by which you were healed.    _Because none of your students have been able to perform_ [25]  _as great miracles in healing as Jesus and his disciples did,_  _does it not suggest the possibility that they do not heal on_  _the same basis?_    You would not ask the pupil in simple equations to  solve a problem involving logarithms; and then, because [30]    [Page 55.]    he failed to get the right answer, condemn the pupil [1]  and the science of numbers. The simplest problem  in Christian Science is healing the sick, and the least  understanding and demonstration thereof prove all its  possibilities. The ability to demonstrate to the extent [5]  that Jesus did, will come when the student possesses as  much of the divine Spirit as he shared, and utilizes its  power to overcome sin.    Opposite to good, is the universal claim of evil that  seeks the proportions of good. There may be those [10]  who, having learned the power of the unspoken thought,  use it to harm rather than to heal, and who are using  that power against Christian Scientists. This giant sin  is the sin against the Holy Ghost spoken of in Matt.  xii. 31, 32. [15]    _Is Christian Science based on the facts of both Spirit_  _and matter?_    Christian Science is based on the facts of Spirit and  its forms and representations, but these facts are the  direct antipodes of the so-called facts of matter; and [20]  the eternal verities of Spirit assert themselves over their  opposite, or matter, in the final destruction of all that  is unlike Spirit.    Man knows that he can have one God only, when  he regards God as the only Mind, Life, and substance. [25]  If God is Spirit, as the Scriptures declare, and All-in-  all, matter is mythology, and its laws are mortal  beliefs.    If Mind is in matter and beneath a skull bone, it is  in something unlike Him; hence it is either a godless"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31511"],[0,"A History of Witchcraft in England from 1558 to 1718 (#10)"],[1,"her knees and confessed that she had four spirits.\" Two of them she had  used for laming, two for killing. Not only the details of her son's  evidence, but all the earlier charges, she confirmed step by step, first  in private confessions to the judge and then publicly at the court  sessions. The woman's stories tallied with those of all her accusers[13]  and displayed no little play of imagination in the orientation of  details.[14] Not content with thus entangling herself in a fearful web  of crime, she went on to point out other women guilty of similar  witchcrafts. Four of those whom she named were haled before the justice.  Elizabeth Bennett, who spun wool for a cloth-maker, was one of those  most vehemently accused, but she denied knowledge of any kind of  witchcraft. It had been charged against her that she kept some wool  hidden in a pot under some stones in her house. She denied at first the  possession of this potent and malignant charm; but, influenced by the  gentle urgings of Justice Darcy,[15] she gave way, as Ursley Kemp had  done, and, breaking all restraint, poured forth wild stories of devilish  crimes committed through the assistance of her imps.    But why should we trace out the confessions, charges, and  counter-charges that followed? The stories that were poured forth  continued to involve a widening group until sixteen persons were under  accusation of the most awful crimes, committed by demoniacal agency. As  at Chelmsford, they were the dregs of the lower classes, women with  illegitimate children, some of them dependent upon public support. It  will be seen that in some respects the panic bore a likeness to those  that had preceded. The spirits, which took extraordinary and bizarre  forms, were the offspring of the same perverted imaginations, but they  had assumed new shapes. Ursley Kemp kept a white lamb, a little gray  cat, a black cat, and a black toad. There were spirits of every sort,  \"two little thyngs like horses, one white, the other black'\"; six  \"spirits like cowes ... as big as rattles\"; spirits masquerading as  blackbirds. One spirit strangely enough remained invisible. It will be  observed by the reader that the spirits almost fitted into a color  scheme. Very vivid colors were those preferred in their spirits by these  St. Oses women. The reader can see, too, that the confessions showed the  influence of the great cat tradition.    We have seen the readiness with which the deluded women made confession.  Some of the confessions were poured forth as from souls long surcharged  with guilt. But not all of them came in this way. Margerie Sammon, who  had testified against one of her neighbors, was finally herself caught  in the web of accusation in which a sister had also been involved. She  was accused by her sister. \"I defie thee,\" she answered, \"though thou  art my sister.\" But her sister drew her aside and \"whyspered her in the  eare,\" after which, with \"great submission and many teares,\" she made a  voluble confession. One wonders about that whispered consultation. Had  her sister perhaps suggested that the justice was offering mercy to  those who confessed? For Justice Darcy was very liberal with his  promises of mercy and absolutely unscrupulous about breaking them.[16]  It is gratifying to be able to record that there was yet a remnant left  who confessed nothing at all and stood stubborn to the last. One of them  was Margaret Grevel, who denied the accusations against her. She \"saith  that shee herselfe hath lost severall bruings and bakings of bread, and  also swine, but she never did complaine thereof: saying that shee wished  her gere were at a stay and then shee cared not whether shee were hanged  or burnt or what did become of her.\" Annis Herd was another who stuck to  her innocence. She could recall various incidents mentioned by her  accusers; it was true that she had talked to Andrew West about getting a  pig, it was true that she had seen Mr. Harrison at his parsonage  gathering plums and had asked for some and been refused. But she denied  that she had any imps or that she had killed any one.    The use of evidence in this trial would lead one to suppose that in  England no rules of evidence were yet in existence. The testimony of  children ranging in age from six to nine was eagerly received. No  objection indeed was made to the testimony of a neighbor who professed  to have overheard what he deemed an incriminating statement. As a matter  of fact the remark, if made, was harmless enough.[17] Expert evidence  was introduced in a roundabout way by the statement offered in court  that a physician had suspected that a certain case was witchcraft.  Nothing was excluded. The garrulous women had been give free rein to  pile up their silly accusations against one another. Not until the trial  was nearing its end does it seem to have occurred to Brian Darcy to warn  a woman against making false charges.    It will be recalled that in the Chelmsford trials Mother Waterhouse had  been found to have upon her certain marks, yet little emphasis had been  laid upon them. In the trials of 1582 the proof drawn from these marks  was deemed of the first importance and the judge appointed juries of  women to make examination. No artist has yet dared to paint the picture  of the gloating female inquisitors grouped around their naked and  trembling victim, a scene that was to be enacted in many a witch trial.  And it is well, for the scene would be too repellent and brutal for  reproduction. In the use of these specially instituted juries there was  no care to get unbiassed decisions. One of the inquisitors appointed to  examine Cystley Celles had already served as witness against her.    It is hard to refrain from an indictment of the hopelessly prejudiced  justice who gathered the evidence.[18] To entrap the defendants seems to  have been his end. In the account which he wrote[19] he seems to have  feared lest the public should fail to understand how his cleverness  ministered to the conviction of the women.[20]    \"There is a man,\" he wrote, \"of great cunning and knowledge come over  lately unto our Queenes Maiestie, which hath advertised her what a  companie and number of witches be within Englande: whereupon I and other  of her Justices have received commission for the apprehending of as many  as are within these limites.\" No doubt he hoped to attract royal notice  and win favor by his zeal.    The Chelmsford affairs and that at St. Oses were the three remarkable  trials of their kind in the first part of Elizabeth's reign. They  furnish some evidence of the progress of superstition. The procedure in  1582 reveals considerable advance over that of 1566. The theory of  diabolic agency had been elaborated. The testimony offered was gaining  in complexity and in variety. New proofs of guilt were being introduced  as well as new methods of testing the matter. In the second part of  Elizabeth's reign we have but one trial of unusual interest, that at  Warboys in Huntingdonshire. This, we shall see, continued the  elaboration of the witch procedure. It was a case that attracted  probably more notice at the time than any other in the sixteenth  century. The accidental fancy of a child and the pronouncement of a  baffled physician were in this instance the originating causes of the  trouble. One of the children of Sir Robert Throckmorton, head of a  prominent family in Huntingdonshire, was taken ill. It so happened that  a neighbor, by name Alice Samuel, called at the house and the ailing and  nervous child took the notion that the woman was a witch and cried out  against her. \"Did you ever see, sayd the child, one more like a witch  then she is; take off her blacke thrumbd cap, for I cannot abide to  looke on her.\" Her parents apparently thought nothing of this at the  time. When Dr. Barrow, an eminent physician of Cambridge, having treated  the child for two of the diseases of children, and without success,  asked the mother and father if any witchcraft were suspected, he was  answered in the negative. The Throckmortons were by no means quick to  harbor a suspicion. But when two and then three other children in the  family fell ill and began in the same way to designate Mother Samuel as  a witch, the parents were more willing to heed the hint thrown out by  the physician. The suspected woman was forcibly brought by Gilbert  Pickering, an uncle of the children, into their presence. The children  at once fell upon the ground \"strangely tormented,\" and insisted upon  scratching Mother Samuel's hand. Meantime Lady Cromwell[21] visited at  the Throckmorton house, and, after an interview with Alice Samuel,  suffered in her dreams from her till at length she fell ill and died,  something over a year later. This confirmed what had been suspicion. To  detail all the steps taken to prove Mother Samuel guilty is unnecessary.  A degree of caution was used which was remarkable. Henry Pickering, a  relative, and some of his fellow scholars at Cambridge made an  investigation into the case, but decided with the others that the woman  was guilty. Mother Samuel herself laid the whole trouble to the  children's \"wantonness.\" Again and again she was urged by the children  to confess. \"Such were the heavenly and divine speeches of the children  in their fits to this old woman ... as that if a man had heard it he  would not have thought himself better edified at ten sermons.\" The  parents pleaded with her to admit her responsibility for the constantly  recurring sickness of their children, but she denied bitterly that she  was to blame. She was compelled to live at the Throckmorton house and to  be a witness constantly to the strange behavior of the children. The  poor creature was dragged back and forth, watched and experimented upon  in a dozen ways, until it is little wonder that she grew ill and spent  her nights in groaning. She was implored to confess and told that all  might yet"]]]
