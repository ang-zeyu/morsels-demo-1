How did I  get back here, I wonder?\"    Just then the children going along, and seeing him, laughed and hooted  at him, calling out: \"Hullo, Haamdaanee, where have you been? Where  do you come from? We thought you were dead long ago.\"    So the sultan's daughter lived in happiness with her people until the  end, and that beggar-man continued to scratch for grains of millet  in the dust heap until he died.    If this story is good, the goodness belongs to all; if it is bad,  the badness belongs only to him who told it.                VIII.    MKAAAH JEECHONEE, THE BOY HUNTER.      Sultan Maaj'noon had seven sons and a big cat, of all of whom he was  very proud.    Everything went well until one day the cat went and caught a calf. When  they told the sultan he said, \"Well, the cat is mine, and the calf is  mine.\" So they said, \"Oh, all right, master,\" and let the matter drop.    A few days later the cat caught a goat; and when they told the sultan  he said, \"The cat is mine, and the goat is mine;\" and so that settled  it again.    Two days more passed, and the cat caught a cow. They told the sultan,  and he shut them up with \"My cat, and my cow.\"    After another two days the cat caught a donkey; same result.    Next it caught a horse; same result.    The next victim was a camel; and when they told the sultan he said:  \"What's the matter with you folks? It was my cat, and my camel. I  believe you don't like my cat, and want it killed, bringing me tales  about it every day. Let it eat whatever it wants to.\"    In a very short time it caught a child, and then a full-grown man;  but each time the sultan remarked that both the cat and its victim  were his, and thought no more of it.    Meantime the cat grew bolder, and hung around a low, open place  near the town, pouncing on people going for water, or animals out at  pasture, and eating them.    At last some of the people plucked up courage; and, going to the  sultan, said: \"How is this, master? As you are our sultan you are  our protector,--or ought to be,--yet you have allowed this cat to do  as it pleases, and now it lives just out of town there, and kills  everything living that goes that way, while at night it comes into  town and does the same thing. Now, what on earth are we to do?\"    But Maajnoon only replied: \"I really believe you hate my cat. I suppose  you want me to kill it; but I shall do no such thing. Everything it  eats is mine.\"    Of course the folks were astonished at this result of the interview,  and, as no one dared to kill the cat, they all had to remove from  the vicinity where it lived. But this did not mend matters, because,  when it found no one came that way, it shifted its quarters likewise.    So complaints continued to pour in, until at last Sultan Maajnoon  gave orders that if any one came to make accusations against the cat,  he was to be informed that the master could not be seen.    When things got so that people neither let their animals out nor went  out themselves, the cat went farther into the country, killing and  eating cattle, and fowls, and everything that came its way.    One day the sultan said to six of his sons, \"I'm going to look at  the country to-day; come along with me.\"    The seventh son was considered too young to go around anywhere,  and was always left at home with the women folk, being called by his  brothers Mkaa'ah Jeecho'nee, which means Mr. Sit-in-the-kitchen.    Well, they went, and presently came to a thicket. The father was in  front and the six sons following him, when the cat jumped out and  killed three of the latter.    The attendants shouted, \"The cat! the cat!\" and the soldiers asked  permission to search for and kill it, which the sultan readily granted,  saying: \"This is not a cat, it is a noon'dah. It has taken from me  my own sons.\"    Now, nobody had ever seen a noondah, but they all knew it was a  terrible beast that could kill and eat all other living things.    When the sultan began to bemoan the loss of his sons, some of those who  heard him said: \"Ah, master, this noondah does not select his prey. He  doesn't say: 'This is my master's son, I'll leave him alone,' or,  'This is my master's wife, I won't eat her.' When we told you what  the cat had done, you always said it was your cat, and what it ate  was yours, and now it has killed your sons, and we don't believe it  would hesitate to eat even you.\"    And he said, \"I fear you are right.\"    As for the soldiers who tried to get the cat, some were killed and  the remainder ran away, and the sultan and his living sons took the  dead bodies home and buried them.    Now when Mkaaah Jeechonee, the seventh son, heard that his brothers  had been killed by the noondah, he said to his mother, \"I, too, will  go, that it may kill me as well as my brothers, or I will kill it.\"    But his mother said: \"My son, I do not like to have you go. Those  three are already dead; and if you are killed also, will not that be  one wound upon another to my heart?\"    \"Nevertheless,\" said he, \"I can not help going; but do not tell  my father.\"    So his mother made him some cakes, and sent some attendants with  him; and he took a great spear, as sharp as a razor, and a sword,  bade her farewell, and departed.    As he had always been left at home, he had no very clear idea what  he was going to hunt for; so he had not gone far beyond the suburbs,  when, seeing a very large dog, he concluded that this was the animal  he was after; so he killed it, tied a rope to it, and dragged it  home, singing,              \"Oh, mother, I have killed          The noondah, eater of the people.\"      When his mother, who was upstairs, heard him, she looked out of the  window, and, seeing what he had brought, said, \"My son, this is not  the noondah, eater of the people.\"    So he left the carcass outside and went in to talk about it, and his  mother said, \"My dear boy, the noondah is a much larger animal than  that; but if I were you, I'd give the business up and stay at home.\"    \"No, indeed,\" he exclaimed; \"no staying at home for me until I have  met and fought the noondah.\"    So he set out again, and went a great deal farther than he had gone  on the former day. Presently he saw a civet cat, and, believing it  to be the animal he was in search of, he killed it, bound it, and  dragged it home, singing,              \"Oh, mother, I have killed          The noondah, eater of the people.\"      When his mother saw the civet cat, she said, \"My son, this is not  the noondah, eater of the people.\" And he threw it away.    Again his mother entreated him to stay at home, but he would not  listen to her, and started off again.    This time he went away off into the forest, and seeing a bigger  cat than the last one, he killed it, bound it, and dragged it home,  singing,              \"Oh, mother, I have killed          The noondah, eater of the people.\"      But directly his mother saw it, she had to tell him, as before,  \"My son, this is not the noondah, eater of the people.\"    He was, of course, very much troubled at this; and his mother said,  \"Now, where do you expect to find this noondah? You don't know where  it is, and you don't know what it looks like. You'll get sick over  this; you're not looking so well now as you did. Come, stay at home.\"    But he said: \"There are three things, one of which I shall do: I  shall die; I shall find the noondah and kill it; or I shall return  home unsuccessful. In any case, I'm off again.\"    This time he went farther than before, saw a zebra, killed it, bound  it, and dragged it home, singing,              \"Oh, mother, I have killed          The noondah, eater of the people.\"      Of course his mother had to tell him, once again, \"My son, this is  not the noondah, eater of the people.\"    After a good deal of argument, in which his mother's persuasion,  as usual, was of no avail, he went off again, going farther than  ever, when he caught a giraffe; and when he had killed it he said:  \"Well, this time I've been successful. This must be the noondah.\" So  he dragged it home, singing,              \"Oh, mother, I have killed          The noondah, eater of the people.\"      Again his mother had to assure him, \"My son, this is not the noondah,  eater of the people.\" She then pointed out to him that his brothers  were not running about hunting for the noondah, but staying at home  attending to their own business. But, remarking that all brothers were  not alike, he expressed his determination to stick to his task until  it came to a successful termination, and went off again, a still  greater distance than before.    While going through the wilderness he espied a rhinoceros asleep  under a tree, and turning to his attendants he exclaimed, \"At last  I see the noondah.\"    \"Where, master?\" they all cried, eagerly.    \"There, under the tree.\"    \"Oh-h! What shall we do?\" they asked.    And he answered: \"First of all, let us eat our fill, then we will  attack it. We have found it in a good place, though if it kills us,  we can't help it.\"    So they all took out their arrowroot cakes and ate till they were  satisfied.    Then Mkaaah Jeechonee said, \"Each of you take two guns; lay one beside  you and take the other in your hands, and at the proper time let us  all fire at once.\"    And they said, \"All right, master.\"    So they crept cautiously through the bushes and got around to the  other side of the tree, at the back of the rhinoceros; then they  closed up till they were quite near it, and all fired together. The  beast jumped up, ran a little way, and then fell down dead.    They bound it, and dragged it for two whole days, until they reached  the town, when Mkaaah Jeechonee began singing,              \"Oh, mother, I have killed          The noondah, eater of the people.\"      But he received the same answer from his mother: \"My"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3751"],[0,"The Psychology of Beauty (#10)"],[1," the sensations  from my eye muscles that tells me I have passed between the  two; or, to express it otherwise, that it is in me the two  have succeeded each other.  While the self in its widest sense,  therefore, is co-extensive with consciousness, the distinctive  feeling of self as opposed to the elements in consciousness  which represent the outer world is based on those bodily  sensations which are connected with the relations of objects.  My world--the foreground of my consciousness--would fall in on  me and crush me, if I could not hold it off by just this power  to feel it different from my background; and it is felt as  different through the motor sensations involved in the change  of my sense organs in passing from one to the other.  The  condition of the feeling of transition, and hence of the  feeling of personality, is then the presence in consciousness  of at least two possible objects of attention; and the formal  consciousness of self might be schematized as a straight line  connecting two points, in which one point represents the  foreground, and the other the background, of consciousness.    If we now accept this view, and ask under what conditions the  sense of self may be lost, the answer is at once suggested.  It will happen when the \"twoness\" disappears, so that the line  connecting and separating the two objects in our scheme drops  out or is indefinitely decreased.  When background or foreground  tends to disappear or to merge either into the other, or when  background or foreground makes an indissoluble unity or  unbreakable circle, the content of consciousness approaches  absolute unity.  There is no \"relating\" to be done, no  \"transition\" to be made.  The condition, then, for the feeling  of personality is no longer present, and there results a  feeling of complete unity with the object of attention; and if  this object of attention is itself without parts or differences,  there results an empty void, Nirvana.    Suppose that I gaze, motionless, at a single bright light until  all my bodily sensations have faded.  Then one of the \"points\"  in our scheme has dropped out.  In my mind there reigns but one  thought.  The transition feeling goes, for there is nothing to  be \"related.\"  Now \"it is one blaze, about me and within me;\"  I am that light, and myself no longer.  My consciousness is a  unit or a blank, as you please.  If you say that I am self-  hypnotized, I may reply that I have simply ceased to feel  myself different from the content of my consciousness, because  that content has ceased to allow a transition between its terms.    This is, however, not the only possible form of the disappearance  of our \"twoness,\" and the resulting loss of the self-feeling.  When the sequence of objects in consciousness is so rapid that  the feeling of transition, expressed in motor terms, drops below  the threshold of sensation, the feeling of self again fades.  Think, for instance, of the Bacchanal orgies.  The votary of  Dionysus, dancing, shrieking, tearing at his hair and at his  garments, lost in the lightning change of his sensations all  power of relating them.  His mind was ringed in a whirling  circle, every point of which merged into the next without  possibility of differentiation.  And since he could feel no  transition periods, he could feel HIMSELF no longer; he was  one with the content of his consciousness, which consciousness  was no less a unit than our bright light aforesaid, just as a  circle is as truly a unit as a point.  The priest of Dionysus  must have felt himself only a dancing, shouting thing, one  with the world without, \"whirled round in earth's diurnal course  with rocks and stones and trees.\"  And how perfectly the ancient  belief fits our psychophysical analysis!  The Bacchic enthusiast  believed himself possessed with the very ecstasy of the spirit  of nature.  His inspired madness was the presence of the god  who descended upon him,--the god of the vine, of spring; the  rising sap, the rushing stream, the bursting leaf, the rippling  song, all the life of flowing things, they were he!  \"Autika ga  pasa zoreusei,\" was the cry,--\"soon the whole earth will dance  and sing!\"    Yes, this breaking down of barriers, this melting of the  personality into its surroundings, this strange and sweet self-  abandonment must have its source in just the disappearance of  the sensation of adjustment, on which the feeling of personality  is based.  But how can it be, we have to ask, that a principle  so barren of emotional significance should account for the  ecstasy of  religious emotion, of aesthetic delight, of creative  inspiration?  It is not, however, religion or beauty or genius  that is the object of our inquiry at this moment, but simply  the common element in the experience of each of these which  we know as the disappearance of self-feeling.  How the  circumstances peculiar to religious worship, aesthetic appreciation,  and intellectual creation bring about the formal conditions of  the loss of personal feeling must be sought in a more detailed  analysis, and we shall then be able to trace the source of the  intensity of emotion in these experiences.  What, then, first  of all, are the steps by which priest and poet and thinker have  passed into the exaltation of selfless emotion?  Fortunately,  the passionate pilgrims of all three realms of deep experience  have been ever prodigal of their confessions.  The religious  ecstasy, however, embodies the most complete case, and allows  the clearest insight into the nature of the experience; and will  therefore be dealt with at greatest length.    The typical religious enthusiast is the mystic.  From Plotinus  to Buddha, from Meister Eckhart to Emerson, the same doctrine  has brought the same fruits of religious rapture.  There is one  God, and in contemplation of Him the soul becomes of his  essence.  Whether it is held, as by the Neoplatonists, that  Being and Knowledge are one, that the procedure of the world  out of God is a process of self-revelation, and the return of  things into God a process of higher and higher intuition, and  so the mystic experience an apprehension of the highest rather  than a form of worship; or whether it is expressed as by the  humble Beguine, Mechthild,--\"My soul swims in the Being of God  as a fish in water,'--the kernel of the mystic's creed is the  same.  In ecstatic contemplation of God, and, in the higher  states, in ecstatic union with Him, in sinking the individuality  in the divine Being, is the only true life.  Not all, it is  true, who hold the doctrine have had the experience; not all can  say with Eckhart or with Madame Guyon, \"I have seen God in my  own soul,\" or \"I have become one with God.\"  It is from the  narratives and the counsels of perfection of these, the chosen,  the initiate, who have passed beyond the veil, that light may  be thrown on the psychological conditions of mystic ecstasy.    The most illuminating account of her actual mystical experiences  is given by Madame Guyon, the first of the sect or school of the  Quietists.  This gentle Frenchwoman had a gift for psychological  observation, and though her style is neither poetic nor  philosophical, I may be pardoned for quoting at some length her  naive and lucid revelations.  The following passages, beginning  with an early religious experience, are taken almost at random  from the pages of her autobiography:--    \"These sermons made such an impression on my mind, and absorbed  me so strongly in God, that I could not open my eyes nor hear  what was said.\"  \"To hear Thy name, O my God, could put me into  a profound prayer....I could not see any longer the saints nor  the Holy Virgin outside of God; but I saw them all in Him,  scarcely being able to distinguish them from Him....I could  not hear God nor our Lord Jesus Christ spoken of without being,  as it were, outside of myself [hors de moi]....Love seized me  so strongly that I remained absorbed, in a profound silence and  a peace that I cannot describe.  I made ever new efforts, and  I passed my life in beginning my prayers without being able to  carry them through....I could ask nothing for myself nor for  another, nor wish anything but this divine will....I do not  believe that there could be in the world anything more simple  and more unified....It is a state of which one can say nothing  more, because it evades all expression,--a state in which the  creature is lost, engulfed.  All is God, and the soul perceives  only God.  It has to strive no more for perfection, for growth,  for approach to Him, for union.  All is consummated in the unity,  but in a manner so free, so natural, so easy, that the soul  lives from the air which it breathes....The spirit is empty, no  more traversed by thoughts; nothing fills the void, which is no  longer painful, and the soul finds in itself an immense capacity  that nothing can either limit or destroy.\"    Can we fail to trace in these simple words the shadow of all  religious exaltation that is based on faith alone?  Madame Guyon  is strung to a higher key than most of this dull and relaxed  world; but she has struck the eternal note of contemplative  worship.  Such is the sense of union with the divine Spirit.  Such are the thoughts and even the words of Dante, Eckhart, St.  Teresa, the countless mystics of the Middle Age, and of the  followers of Buddhism in its various shades, from the Ganges to  the Charles.  Two characteristics disengage themselves to view:  the insistence on the unity of God--IN whom alone the Holy  Virgin and the saints are seen--from a psychological point of  view only; and the mind's emptiness of thought in a state of  religious ecstasy.  But without further analysis, we may ask,  as the disciples of the mystics have always done, how this  state of blissful union is to be reached.  They have always  been minute in their prescriptions, and it is possible to  derive therefrom what may be called "]]]
