And if you draw it on a tree by the river when you are  fishing, I'll know you want me to walk most most mousy-quiet, so as not  to shake the banks.'    'Perfectly true,' said Tegumai. And there's more in this game than you  think. Taffy, dear, I've a notion that your Daddy's daughter has hit  upon the finest thing that there ever was since the Tribe of Tegumai  took to using shark's teeth instead of flints for their spear-heads. I  believe we've found out the big secret of the world.'    'Why?' said Taffy, and her eyes shone too with incitement.    'I'll show,' said her Daddy. 'What's water in the Tegumai language?'    'Ya, of course, and it means river too--like Wagai-ya--the Wagai river.'    'What is bad water that gives you fever if you drink it--black  water--swamp-water?'    'Yo, of course.'    'Now look,' said her Daddy. 'S'pose you saw this scratched by the side  of a pool in the beaver-swamp?' And he drew this. (8.)    'Carp-tail and round egg. Two noises mixed! Yo, bad water,' said Taffy.  ''Course I wouldn't drink that water because I'd know you said it was  bad.'    'But I needn't be near the water at all. I might be miles away, hunting,  and still--'    'And still it would be just the same as if you stood there and said,  \"G'way, Taffy, or you'll get fever.\" All that in a carp-fish-tail and  a round egg! O Daddy, we must tell Mummy, quick!' and Taffy danced all  round him.    'Not yet,' said Tegumai; 'not till we've gone a little further. Let's  see. Yo is bad water, but So is food cooked on the fire, isn't it?' And  he drew this. (9.)    'Yes. Snake and egg,' said Taffy 'So that means dinner's ready. If you  saw that scratched on a tree you'd know it was time to come to the Cave.  So'd I.'    'My Winkie!' said Tegumai. 'That's true too. But wait a minute. I see  a difficulty. SO means \"come and have dinner,\" but sho means the  drying-poles where we hang our hides.'    'Horrid old drying-poles!' said Taffy. 'I hate helping to hang heavy,  hot, hairy hides on them. If you drew the snake and egg, and I thought  it meant dinner, and I came in from the wood and found that it meant I  was to help Mummy hang the two hides on the drying-poles, what would I  do?'    'You'd be cross. So'd Mummy. We must make a new picture for sho. We must  draw a spotty snake that hisses sh-sh, and we'll play that the plain  snake only hisses ssss.'    'I couldn't be sure how to put in the spots,' said Taffy. 'And p'raps  if you were in a hurry you might leave them out, and I'd think it was  so when it was sho, and then Mummy would catch me just the same. No! I  think we'd better draw a picture of the horrid high drying-poles their  very selves, and make quite sure. I'll put them in just after the  hissy-snake. Look!' And she drew this. (10.)    'P'raps that's safest. It's very like our drying-poles, anyhow,'  said her Daddy, laughing. 'Now I'll make a new noise with a snake and  drying-pole sound in it. I'll say shi. That's Tegumai for spear, Taffy.'  And he laughed.    'Don't make fun of me,' said Taffy, as she thought of her picture-letter  and the mud in the Stranger-man's hair. 'You draw it, Daddy.'    'We won't have beavers or hills this time, eh?' said her Daddy, 'I'll  just draw a straight line for my spear.' and he drew this. (11.)    'Even Mummy couldn't mistake that for me being killed.'    'Please don't, Daddy. It makes me uncomfy. Do some more noises. We're  getting on beautifully.'    'Er-hm!' said Tegumai, looking up. 'We'll say shu. That means sky.'    Taffy drew the snake and the drying-pole. Then she stopped. 'We must  make a new picture for that end sound, mustn't we?'    'Shu-shu-u-u-u!' said her Daddy. 'Why, it's just like the  round-egg-sound made thin.'    'Then s'pose we draw a thin round egg, and pretend it's a frog that  hasn't eaten anything for years.'    'N-no,' said her Daddy. 'If we drew that in a hurry we might mistake it  for the round egg itself. Shu-shu-shu! 'I tell you what we'll do. We'll  open a little hole at the end of the round egg to show how the O-noise  runs out all thin, ooo-oo-oo. Like this.' And he drew this. (12.)    'Oh, that's lovely! Much better than a thin frog. Go on,' said Taffy,  using her shark's tooth. Her Daddy went on drawing, and his hand shook  with incitement. He went on till he had drawn this. (13.)    'Don't look up, Taffy,' he said. 'Try if you can make out what that  means in the Tegumai language. If you can, we've found the Secret.'    'Snake--pole--broken--egg--carp--tail and carp-mouth,' said Taffy.  'Shu-ya. Sky-water (rain).' Just then a drop fell on her hand, for the  day had clouded over. 'Why, Daddy, it's raining. Was that what you meant  to tell me?'    'Of course,' said her Daddy. 'And I told it you without saying a word,  didn't I?'    'Well, I think I would have known it in a minute, but that raindrop made  me quite sure. I'll always remember now. Shu-ya means rain, or \"it is  going to rain.\" Why, Daddy!' She got up and danced round him. 'S'pose  you went out before I was awake, and drawed shu-ya in the smoke on the  wall, I'd know it was going to rain and I'd take my beaver-skin hood.  Wouldn't Mummy be surprised?'    Tegumai got up and danced. (Daddies didn't mind doing those things in  those days.) 'More than that! More than that!' he said. 'S'pose I wanted  to tell you it wasn't going to rain much and you must come down to the  river, what would we draw? Say the words in Tegumai-talk first.'    'Shu-ya-las, ya maru. (Sky-water ending. River come to.) what a lot of  new sounds! I don't see how we can draw them.'    'But I do--but I do!' said Tegumai. 'Just attend a minute, Taffy, and  we won't do any more to-day. We've got shu-ya all right, haven't we? But  this las is a teaser. La-la-la' and he waved his shark-tooth.    'There's the hissy-snake at the end and the carp-mouth before the  snake--as-as-as. We only want la-la,' said Taffy.    'I know it, but we have to make la-la. And we're the first people in all  the world who've ever tried to do it, Taffimai!'    'Well,' said Taffy, yawning, for she was rather tired. 'Las means  breaking or finishing as well as ending, doesn't it?'    'So it does,' said Tegumai. 'To-las means that there's no water in the  tank for Mummy to cook with--just when I'm going hunting, too.'    'And shi-las means that your spear is broken. If I'd only thought of  that instead of drawing silly beaver pictures for the Stranger!'    'La! La! La!' said Tegumai, waiving his stick and frowning. 'Oh bother!'    'I could have drawn shi quite easily,' Taffy went on. 'Then I'd have  drawn your spear all broken--this way!' And she drew. (14.)    'The very thing,' said Tegumai. 'That's la all over. It isn't like any  of the other marks either.' And he drew this. (15.)    'Now for ya. Oh, we've done that before. Now for maru. Mum-mum-mum. Mum  shuts one's mouth up, doesn't it? We'll draw a shut mouth like this.'  And he drew. (16.)    'Then the carp-mouth open. That makes Ma-ma-ma! But what about this  rrrrr-thing, Taffy?'    'It sounds all rough and edgy, like your shark-tooth saw when you're  cutting out a plank for the canoe,' said Taffy.    'You mean all sharp at the edges, like this?' said Tegumai. And he drew.  (17.)    ''Xactly,' said Taffy. 'But we don't want all those teeth: only put  two.'    'I'll only put in one,' said Tegumai. 'If this game of ours is going  to be what I think it will, the easier we make our sound-pictures the  better for everybody.' And he drew. (18.)    'Now, we've got it,' said Tegumai, standing on one leg. 'I'll draw 'em  all in a string like fish.'    'Hadn't we better put a little bit of stick or something between each  word, so's they won't rub up against each other and jostle, same as if  they were carps?'    'Oh, I'll leave a space for that,' said her Daddy. And very incitedly he  drew them all without stopping, on a big new bit of birch-bark. (19.)    'Shu-ya-las ya-maru,' said Taffy, reading it out sound by sound.      'That's enough for to-day,' said Tegumai. 'Besides, you're getting  tired, Taffy. Never mind, dear. We'll finish it all to-morrow, and then  we'll be remembered for years and years after the biggest trees you can  see are all chopped up for firewood.'    So they went home, and all that evening Tegumai sat on one side of the  fire and Taffy on the other, drawing ya's and yo's and shu's and shi's  in the smoke on the wall and giggling together till her Mummy said,  'Really, Tegumai, you're worse than my Taffy.'    'Please don't mind,' said Taffy. 'It's only our secret-s'prise, Mummy  dear, and we'll tell you all about it the very minute it's done; but  please don't ask me what it is now, or else I'll have to tell.'    So her Mummy most carefully didn't; and bright and early next morning  Tegumai went down to the river to think about new sound pictures,  and when Taffy got up she saw Ya-las (water is ending or running out)  chalked on the side of the big stone water-tank, outside the Cave.    'Um,' said Taffy. 'These picture-sounds are rather a bother! Daddy's  just as good as come here himself and told me to get more water for  Mummy to cook with.' She went to the spring at the back of the house and  filled the tank from a bark bucket, and then she ran down to the river  and pulled her Daddy's left ear--the one that belonged to her to pull  when she was good.    'Now come along and we'll draw all the left-over sound-pictures,' said  her Daddy, and they had a most inciting day of it, and a beautiful lunch  in the middle, and two games of romps. When they came to T, Taffy said  that as her name, and her Daddy's, and her Mummy's all began with that  sound, they should draw a sort of family group of themselves holding  hands. That was all very well to draw once or twice; but when it came to  drawing it six or seven times, Taffy and Tegumai drew it scratchier and  scratchier, till at last the T-s"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27827"],[0,"The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana (#10)"],[1,"ire, it is called a \"kiss that  awakens.\" On such an occasion the woman may pretend to be asleep at the  time of her lover's arrival, so that she may know his intention and  obtain respect from him.    When a person kisses the reflection of the person he loves in a mirror,  in water, or on a wall, it is called a \"kiss showing the intention.\"    When a person kisses a child sitting on his lap, or a picture, or an  image, or figure, in the presence of the person beloved by him, it is  called a \"transferred kiss.\"    When at night at a theatre, or in an assembly of caste men, a man coming  up to a woman kisses a finger of her hand if she be standing, or a toe  of her foot if she be sitting, or when a woman is shampooing her lover's  body, places her face on his thigh (as if she was sleepy) so as to  inflame his passion, and kisses his thigh or great toe, it is called a  \"demonstrative kiss.\"    There is also a verse on the subject as follows:--    \"Whatever things may be done by one of the lovers to the other, the same  should be returned by the other, _i.e._, if the woman kisses him he should  kiss her in return, if she strikes him he should also strike her in  return.\"          CHAPTER IV.    ON PRESSING, OR MARKING, OR SCRATCHING WITH THE NAILS.      When love becomes intense, pressing with the nails or scratching the  body with them is practised, and it is done on the following occasions:  On the first visit; at the time of setting out on a journey; on the  return from a journey; at the time when an angry lover is reconciled;  and lastly when the woman is intoxicated.    But pressing with the nails is not an usual thing except with those who  are intensely passionate, _i.e._, full of passion. It is employed together  with biting, by those to whom the practice is agreeable.    Pressing with the nails is of the eight following kinds, according to  the forms of the marks which are produced, viz.:    1. Sounding.    2. Half moon.    3. A circle.    4. A line.    5. A tiger's nail or claw.    6. A peacock's foot.    7. The jump of a hare.    8. The leaf of a blue lotus.    The places that are to be pressed with the nails are as follows: the arm  pit, the throat, the breasts, the lips, the jaghana, or middle parts of  the body, and the thighs. But Suvarnanabha is of opinion that when the  impetuosity of passion is excessive, then the places need not be  considered.    The qualities of good nails are that they should be bright, well set,  clean, entire, convex, soft, and glossy in appearance. Nails are of  three kinds according to their size, viz.:       Small.     Middling.     Large.    Large nails, which give grace to the hands, and attract the hearts of  women from their appearance, are possessed by the Bengalees.    Small nails, which can be used in various ways, and are to be applied  only with the object of giving pleasure, are possessed by the people of  the southern districts.    Middling nails, which contain the properties of both the above kinds,  belong to the people of the Maharashtra.    (1). When a person presses the chin, the breasts, the lower lip, or the  jaghana of another so softly that no scratch or mark is left, but only  the hair on the body becomes erect from the touch of the nails, and the  nails themselves make a sound, it is called a \"sounding or pressing with  the nails.\"    This pressing is used in the case of a young girl when her lover  shampoos her, scratches her head, and wants to trouble or frighten her.    (2). The curved mark with the nails, which is impressed on the neck and  the breasts, is called the \"half moon.\"    (3). When the half moons are impressed opposite to each other, it is  called a \"circle.\" This mark with the nails is generally made on the  navel, the small cavities about the buttocks, and on the joints of the  thigh.    (4). A mark in the form of a small line, and which can be made on any  part of the body, is called a \"line.\"    (5). This same line, when it is curved, and made on the breast, is  called a \"tiger's nail.\"    (6). When a curved mark is made on the breast by means of the five  nails, it is called a \"peacock's foot.\" This mark is made with the  object of being praised, for it requires a great deal of skill to make  it properly.    (7). When five marks with the nails are made close to one another near  the nipple of the breast, it is called \"the jump of a hare.\"    (8). A mark made on the breast or on the hips in the form of a leaf of  the blue lotus, is called the \"leaf of a blue lotus.\"    When a person is going on a journey, and makes a mark on the thighs, or  on the breast, it is called a \"token of remembrance.\" On such an  occasion three or four lines are impressed close to one another with the  nails.    Here ends the marking with the nails. Marks of other kinds than the  above may also be made with the nails, for the ancient authors say,  that as there are innumerable degrees of skill among men (the practice  of this art being known to all), so there are innumerable ways of making  these marks. And as pressing or marking with the nails is independent of  love, no one can say with certainty how many different kinds of marks  with the nails do actually exist. The reason of this is, Vatsyayana  says, that as variety is necessary in love, so love is to be produced by  means of variety. It is on this account that courtezans, who are well  acquainted with various ways and means, become so desirable, for if  variety is sought in all the arts and amusements, such as archery and  others, how much more should it be sought after in the present case.    The marks of the nails should not be made on married women, but  particular kinds of marks may be made on their private parts for the  remembrance and increase of love.    There are also some verses on the subject, as follows:    \"The love of a woman who sees the marks of nails on the private parts of  her body, even though they are old and almost worn out, becomes again  fresh and new. If there be no marks of nails to remind a person of the  passages of love, then love is lessened in the same way as when no union  takes place for a long time.\"    Even when a stranger sees at a distance a young woman with the marks of  nails on her breast,[37] he is filled with love and respect for her.    A man, also, who carries the marks of nails and teeth on some parts of  his body, influences the mind of a woman, even though it be ever so  firm. In short, nothing tends to increase love so much as the effects of  marking with the nails, and biting.    FOOTNOTE:    [Footnote 37: From this it would appear that in ancient times the  breasts of women were not covered, and this is seen in the painting of  the Ajunta and other caves, where we find that the breasts of even royal  ladies and others are exposed.]          CHAPTER V.    ON BITING, AND THE MEANS TO BE EMPLOYED WITH REGARD TO WOMEN OF  DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.      All the places that can be kissed, are also the places that can be  bitten, except the upper lip, the interior of the mouth, and the eyes.    The qualities of good teeth are as follows: They should be equal,  possessed of a pleasing brightness, capable of being coloured, of proper  proportions, unbroken, and with sharp ends.    The defects of teeth on the other hand are, that they are blunt,  protruding from the gums, rough, soft, large, and loosely set.    The following are the different kinds of biting, viz.:       The hidden bite.     The swollen bite.     The point.     The line of points.     The coral and the jewel.     The line of jewels.     The broken cloud.     The biting of the boar.    (1). The biting which is shown only by the excessive redness of the skin  that is bitten, is called the \"hidden bite.\"    (2). When the skin is pressed down on both sides, it is called the  \"swollen bite.\"    (3). When a small portion of the skin is bitten with two teeth only, it  is called the \"point.\"    (4). When such small portions of the skin are bitten with all the teeth,  it is called the \"line of points.\"    (5). The biting which is done by bringing together the teeth and the  lips, is called the \"coral and the jewel.\" The lip is the coral, and the  teeth the jewel.    (6). When biting is done with all the teeth, it is called the \"line of  jewels.\"    (7). The biting which consists of unequal risings in a circle, and which  comes from the space between the teeth, is called the \"broken cloud.\"  This is impressed on the breasts.    (8). The biting which consists of many broad rows of marks near to one  another, and with red intervals, is called the \"biting of a boar.\" This  is impressed on the breasts and the shoulders; and these two last modes  of biting are peculiar to persons of intense passion.    The lower lip is the place on which the \"hidden bite,\" the \"swollen  bite,\" and the \"point\" are made; again the \"swollen bite,\" and the  \"coral and the jewel\" bite are done on the cheek. Kissing, pressing with  the nails, and biting are the ornaments of the left cheek, and when the  word cheek is used it is to be understood as the left cheek.    Both the \"line of points\" and the \"line of jewels\" are to be impressed  on the throat, the arm pit, and the joints of the thighs; but the \"line  of points\" alone is to be impressed on the forehead and the thighs.    The marking with the nails, and the biting of the following things,  viz., an ornament of the forehead, an ear ornament, a bunch of flowers,  a betel leaf, or a tamala leaf, which are worn by, or belong to the  woman that is beloved, are signs of the desire of enjoyment.    Here end the different kinds of biting.           *       *       *       *       *    In the affairs of love a man should do such things as are agreeable to  the women of different countries.    The women of the central countries (_i.e._, between the Ganges and the  Jumna) are noble in their character, not accustomed to disgraceful  practices, and dislike pressing the nails and biting.   "]]]
