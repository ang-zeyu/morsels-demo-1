From time to time he consulted  the compass on the board before him, and changed his course ever so  slightly. Presently he released one hand from the driving wheel, and  scribbling on a little block of paper which was inserted in a pocket at  the side of the seat he passed it back.    John Lexman read:         \"If you cannot swim there is a life belt under your seat.\"    John nodded.    Kara was searching the sea for something, and presently he found it.  Viewed from the height at which they flew it looked no more than a white  speck in a great blue saucer, but presently the machine began to dip,  falling at a terrific rate of speed, which took away the breath of the  man who was hanging on with both hands to the dangerous seat behind.    He was deadly cold, but had hardly noticed the fact. It was all so  incredible, so impossible. He expected to wake up and wondered if the  prison was also part of the dream.    Now he saw the point for which Kara was making.    A white steam yacht, long and narrow of beam, was steaming slowly  westward. He could see the feathery wake in her rear, and as the  aeroplane fell he had time to observe that a boat had been put off. Then  with a jerk the monoplane flattened out and came like a skimming bird to  the surface of the water; her engines stopped.    \"We ought to be able to keep afloat for ten minutes,\" said Kara, \"and by  that time they will pick us up.\"    His voice was high and harsh in the almost painful silence which  followed the stoppage of the engines.    In less than five minutes the boat had come alongside, manned, as Lexman  gathered from a glimpse of the crew, by Greeks. He scrambled aboard  and five minutes later he was standing on the white deck of the yacht,  watching the disappearing tail of the monoplane. Kara was by his side.    \"There goes fifteen hundred pounds,\" said the Greek, with a smile, \"add  that to the two thousand I paid the warder and you have a tidy sum-but  some things are worth all the money in the world!\"            CHAPTER VII      T. X. came from Downing Street at 11 o'clock one night, and his heart  was filled with joy and gratitude.    He swung his stick to the common danger of the public, but the policeman  on point duty at the end of the street, who saw him, recognized and  saluted him, did not think it fit to issue any official warning.    He ran up the stairs to his office, and found Mansus reading the evening  paper.    \"My poor, dumb beast,\" said T. X. \"I am afraid I have kept you waiting  for a very long time, but tomorrow you and I will take a little journey  to Devonshire. It will be good for you, Mansus--where did you get that  ridiculous name, by the way!\"    \"M. or N.,\" replied Mansus, laconically.    \"I repeat that there is the dawn of an intellect in you,\" said T. X.,  offensively.    He became more serious as he took from a pocket inside his waistcoat a  long blue envelope containing the paper which had cost him so much to  secure.    \"Finding the revolver was a master-stroke of yours, Mansus,\" he said,  and he was in earnest as he spoke.    The man coloured with pleasure for the subordinates of T. X. loved him,  and a word of praise was almost equal to promotion. It was on the advice  of Mansus that the road from London to Lewes had been carefully covered  and such streams as passed beneath that road had been searched.    The revolver had been found after the third attempt between Gatwick and  Horsley. Its identification was made easier by the fact that Vassalaro's  name was engraved on the butt. It was rather an ornate affair and in its  earlier days had been silver plated; the handle was of mother-o'-pearl.    \"Obviously the gift of one brigand to another,\" was T. X.'s comment.    Armed with this, his task would have been fairly easy, but when to this  evidence he added a rough draft of the threatening letter which he had  found amongst Vassalaro's belongings, and which had evidently been taken  down at dictation, since some of the words were misspelt and had been  corrected by another hand, the case was complete.    But what clinched the matter was the finding of a wad of that peculiar  chemical paper, a number of sheets of which T. X. had ignited for the  information of the Chief Commissioner and the Home Secretary by simply  exposing them for a few seconds to the light of an electric lamp.    Instantly it had filled the Home Secretary's office with a pungent  and most disagreeable smoke, for which he was heartily cursed by his  superiors. But it had rounded off the argument.    He looked at his watch.    \"I wonder if it is too late to see Mrs. Lexman,\" he said.    \"I don't think any hour would be too late,\" suggested Mansus.    \"You shall come and chaperon me,\" said his superior.    But a disappointment awaited. Mrs. Lexman was not in and neither the  ringing at her electric bell nor vigorous applications to the knocker  brought any response. The hall porter of the flats where she lived  was under the impression that Mrs. Lexman had gone out of town. She  frequently went out on Saturdays and returned on the Monday and, he  thought, occasionally on Tuesdays.    It happened that this particular night was a Monday night and T. X.  was faced with a dilemma. The night porter, who had only the vaguest  information on the subject, thought that the day porter might know more,  and aroused him from his sleep.    Yes, Mrs. Lexman had gone. She went on the Sunday, an unusual day to  pay a week-end visit, and she had taken with her two bags. The porter  ventured the opinion that she was rather excited, but when asked to  define the symptoms relapsed into a chaos of incoherent \"you-knows\" and  \"what-I-means.\"    \"I don't like this,\" said T. X., suddenly. \"Does anybody know that we  have made these discoveries?\"    \"Nobody outside the office,\" said Mansus, \"unless, unless...\"    \"Unless what?\" asked the other, irritably. \"Don't be a jimp, Mansus. Get  it off your mind. What is it?\"    \"I am wondering,\" said Mansus slowly, \"if the landlord at Great James  Street said anything. He knows we have made a search.\"    \"We can easily find that out,\" said T. X.    They hailed a taxi and drove to Great James Street. That respectable  thoroughfare was wrapped in sleep and it was some time before the  landlord could be aroused. Recognizing T. X. he checked his sarcasm,  which he had prepared for a keyless lodger, and led the way into the  drawing room.    \"You didn't tell me not to speak about it, Mr. Meredith,\" he said, in an  aggrieved tone, \"and as a matter of fact I have spoken to nobody except  the gentleman who called the same day.\"    \"What did he want?\" asked T. X.    \"He said he had only just discovered that Mr. Vassalaro had stayed with  me and he wanted to pay whatever rent was due,\" replied the other.    \"What like of man was he?\" asked T. X.    The brief description the man gave sent a cold chill to the  Commissioner's heart.    \"Kara for a ducat!\" he said, and swore long and variously.    \"Cadogan Square,\" he ordered.    His ring was answered promptly. Mr. Kara was out of town, had indeed  been out of town since Saturday. This much the man-servant explained  with a suspicious eye upon his visitors, remembering that his  predecessor had lost his job from a too confiding friendliness with  spurious electric fitters. He did not know when Mr. Kara would return,  perhaps it would be a long time and perhaps a short time. He might come  back that night or he might not.    \"You are wasting your young life,\" said T. X. bitterly. \"You ought to be  a fortune teller.\"    \"This settles the matter,\" he said, in the cab on the way back. \"Find  out the first train for Tavistock in the morning and wire the George  Hotel to have a car waiting.\"    \"Why not go to-night?\" suggested the other. \"There is the midnight  train. It is rather slow, but it will get you there by six or seven in  the morning.\"    \"Too late,\" he said, \"unless you can invent a method of getting from  here to Paddington in about fifty seconds.\"    The morning journey to Devonshire was a dispiriting one despite the  fineness of the day. T. X. had an uncomfortable sense that something  distressing had happened. The run across the moor in the fresh spring  air revived him a little.    As they spun down to the valley of the Dart, Mansus touched his arm.    \"Look at that,\" he said, and pointed to the blue heavens where, a mile  above their heads, a white-winged aeroplane, looking no larger than a  very distant dragon fly, shimmered in the sunlight.    \"By Jove!\" said T. X. \"What an excellent way for a man to escape!\"    \"It's about the only way,\" said Mansus.    The significance of the aeroplane was borne in upon T. X. a few minutes  later when he was held up by an armed guard. A glance at his card was  enough to pass him.    \"What is the matter?\" he asked.    \"A prisoner has escaped,\" said the sentry.    \"Escaped--by aeroplane?\" asked T. X.    \"I don't know anything about aeroplanes, sir. All I know is that one of  the working party got away.\"    The car came to the gates of the prison and T. X. sprang out, followed  by his assistant. He had no difficulty in finding the Governor, a  greatly perturbed man, for an escape is a very serious matter.    The official was inclined to be brusque in his manner, but again the  magic card produced a soothing effect.    \"I am rather rattled,\" said the Governor. \"One of my men has got away. I  suppose you know that?\"    \"And I am afraid another of your men is going away, sir,\" said T. X.,  who had a curious reverence for military authority. He produced his  paper and laid it on the governor's table.    \"This is an order for the release of John Lexman, convicted under  sentence of fifteen years penal servitude.\"    The Governor looked at it.    \"Dated last night,\" he said, and breathed a long sigh of relief. \"Thank  the Lord!--that is the man who escaped!\"          CHAPTER VIII      Two years after the events just"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26908"],[0,"Conversations on Chemistry, V. 1-2 (#10)"],[1,"the difference of  substituting a cold body instead of the hot one, to see whether cold  would not be reflected as well as heat.    MRS. B.    That experiment was proposed to Mr. Pictet by an incredulous philosopher  like yourself, and he immediately tried it by substituting a piece of  ice in the place of the heated bullet.    CAROLINE.    Well, Mrs. B., and what was the result?    MRS. B.    That we shall see; I have procured some ice for the purpose.    EMILY.    The thermometer falls considerably!    CAROLINE.    And does not that prove that cold is not merely a _negative_ quality,  implying simply an inferior degree of heat? The cold must be _positive_,  since it is capable of reflection.    MRS. B.    So it at first appeared to Mr. Pictet; but upon a little consideration  he found that it afforded only an additional proof of the reflection of  heat: this I shall endeavour to explain to you.    According to Mr. Prevost's theory, we suppose that all bodies whatever  radiate caloric; the thermometer used in these experiments therefore  emits calorific rays in the same manner as any other substance. When its  temperature is in equilibrium with that of the surrounding bodies, it  receives as much caloric as it parts with, and no change of temperature  is produced. But when we introduce a body of a lower temperature, such  as a piece of ice, which parts with less caloric than it receives, the  consequence is, that its temperature is raised, whilst that of the  surrounding bodies is proportionally lowered.    EMILY.    If, for instance, I was to bring a large piece of ice into this room,  the ice would in time be melted, by absorbing caloric from the general  radiation which is going on throughout the room; and as it would  contribute very little caloric in return for what is absorbed, the room  would necessarily be cooled by it.    MRS. B.    Just so; and as in consequence of the mirrors, a more considerable  exchange of rays takes place between the ice and the thermometer, than  between these and any of the surrounding bodies, the temperature of the  thermometer must be more lowered than that of any other adjacent object.    CAROLINE.    I confess I do not perfectly understand your explanation.    MRS. B.    This experiment is exactly similar to that made with the heated bullet:  for, if we consider the thermometer as the hot body (which it certainly  is in comparison to the ice), you may then easily understand that it is  by the loss of the calorific rays which the thermometer sends to the  ice, and not by any cold rays received from it, that the fall of the  mercury is occasioned: for the ice, far from emitting rays of cold,  sends forth rays of caloric, which diminish the loss sustained by the  thermometer.    Let us say, for instance, that the radiation of the thermometer towards  the ice is equal to 20, and that of the ice towards the thermometer to  10: the exchange in favour of the ice is as 20 is to 10, or the  thermometer absolutely loses 10, whilst the ice gains 10.    CAROLINE.    But if the ice actually sends rays of caloric to the thermometer, must  not the latter fall still lower when the ice is removed?    MRS. B.    No; for the space that the ice occupied, admits rays from all the  surrounding bodies to pass through it; and those being of the same  temperature as the thermometer, will not affect it, because as much heat  now returns to the thermometer as radiates from it.    CAROLINE.    I must confess that you have explained this in so satisfactory a manner,  that I cannot help being convinced now that cold has no real claim to  the rank of a positive being.    MRS. B.    Before I conclude the subject of radiation I must observe to you that  different bodies, (or rather surfaces,) possess the power of radiating  caloric in very different degrees.    Some very curious experiments have been made by Mr. Leslie on this  subject, and it was for this purpose that he invented the differential  thermometer; with its assistance he ascertained that black surfaces  radiate most, glass next, and polished surfaces the least of all.    EMILY.    Supposing these surfaces, of course, to be all of the same temperature.    MRS. B.    Undoubtedly. I will now show you the very simple and ingenious  apparatus, by means of which he made these experiments. This cubical tin  vessel or canister, has each of its sides externally covered with  different materials; the one is simply blackened; the next is covered  with white paper; the third with a pane of glass, and in the fourth the  polished tin surface remains uncovered. We shall fill this vessel with  hot water, so that there can be no doubt but that all its sides will be  of the same temperature. Now let us place it in the focus of one of the  mirrors, making each of its sides front it in succession. We shall begin  with the black surface.    CAROLINE.    It makes the thermometer which is in the focus of the other mirror rise  considerably. Let us turn the paper surface towards the mirror. The  thermometer falls a little, therefore of course this side cannot emit or  radiate so much caloric as the blackened side.    EMILY.    This is very surprising; for the sides are exactly of the same size, and  must be of the same temperature. But let us try the glass surface.    MRS. B.    The thermometer continues falling, and with the plain surface it falls  still lower; these two surfaces therefore radiate less and less.    CAROLINE.    I think I have found out the reason of this.    MRS. B.    I should be very happy to hear it, for it has not yet (to my knowledge)  been accounted for.    CAROLINE.    The water within the vessel gradually cools, and the thermometer in  consequence gradually falls.    MRS. B.    It is true that the water cools, but certainly in much less proportion  than the thermometer descends, as you will perceive if you now change  the tin surface for the black one.    CAROLINE.    I was mistaken certainly, for the thermometer rises again now that the  black surface fronts the mirror.    MRS. B.    And yet the water in the vessel is still cooling, Caroline.    EMILY.    I am surprised that the tin surface should radiate the least caloric,  for a metallic vessel filled with hot water, a silver teapot, for  instance, feels much hotter to the hand than one of black earthen ware.    MRS. B.    That is owing to the different power which various bodies possess for  _conducting_ caloric, a property which we shall presently examine. Thus,  although a metallic vessel feels warmer to the hand, a vessel of this  kind is known to preserve the heat of the liquid within, better than one  of any other materials; it is for this reason that silver teapots make  better tea than those of earthen ware.    EMILY.    According to these experiments, light-coloured dresses, in cold weather,  should keep us warmer than black clothes, since the latter radiate so  much more than the former.    MRS. B.    And that is actually the case.    EMILY.    This property, of different surfaces to radiate in different degrees,  appears to me to be at variance with the equilibrium of caloric; since  it would imply that those bodies which radiate most, must ultimately  become coldest.    Suppose that we were to vary this experiment, by using two metallic  vessels full of boiling water, the one blackened, the other not; would  not the black one cool the first?    CAROLINE.    True; but when they were both brought down to the temperature of the  room, the interchange of caloric between the canisters and the other  bodies of the room being then equal, their temperatures would remain the  same.    EMILY.    I do not see why that should be the case; for if different surfaces of  the same temperature radiate in different degrees when heated, why  should they not continue to do so when cooled down to the temperature of  the room?    MRS. B.    You have started a difficulty, Emily, which certainly requires  explanation. It is found by experiment that the power of absorption  corresponds with and is proportional to that of radiation; so that under  equal temperatures, bodies compensate for the greater loss they sustain  in consequence of their greater radiation by their greater absorption;  so that if you were to make your experiment in an atmosphere heated like  the canisters, to the temperature of boiling water, though it is true  that the canisters would radiate in different degrees, no change of  temperature would be produced in them, because they would each absorb  caloric in proportion to their respective radiation.    EMILY.    But would not the canisters of boiling water also absorb caloric in  different degrees in a room of the common temperature?    MRS. B.    Undoubtedly they would. But the various bodies in the room would not, at  a lower temperature, furnish either of the canisters with a sufficiency  of caloric to compensate for the loss they undergo; for, suppose the  black canister to absorb 400 rays of caloric, whilst the metallic one  absorbed only 200; yet if the former radiate 800, whilst the latter  radiates only 400, the black canister will be the first cooled down to  the temperature of the room. But from the moment the equilibrium of  temperature has taken place, the black canister, both receiving and  giving out 400 rays, and the metallic one 200, no change of temperature  will take place.    EMILY.    I now understand it extremely well. But what becomes of the surplus of  calorific rays, which good radiators emit and bad radiators refuse to  receive; they must wander about in search of a resting-place?    MRS. B.    They really do so; for they are rejected and sent back, or, in other  words, _reflected_ by the bodies which are bad radiators of caloric; and  they are thus transmitted to other bodies which happen to lie in their  way, by which they are either absorbed or again reflected, according as  the property of reflection, or that of absorption, predominates in these "]]]
