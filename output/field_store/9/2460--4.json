The apparatus is also provided with a condenser,        which affords illumination sufficient for the use of        high power objectives, and with a thermometer indicating        the exact temperature of the centre of the stage, which        may be carried as high as 100 deg.

This little work is furnished with each apparatus.     105. =The Photo-micrographic Apparatus= consists of a        heavy iron foot supporting a stout column in which        another iron support moves vertically. This latter holds        the camera and may be firmly fixed at any height by        means of a thumb-screw. This permits the accurate        adjustment of the camera to microscope stands of various        sizes. The length of the camera is also adjustable by        means of a thumb-screw sliding in the upright support.        Regulation of the field of the camera is accomplished by        a revolving disc diaphragm with openings of five        different sizes situated in the neck of the camera. Two        simple plate-holders for plates 9x12 and 13x18 cm are        supplied with each camera, as are also a ground glass        plate and clear glass plate in the frame of the camera        serve to catch the picture in the plane of the        photographic plate, and a simple lens aids in obtaining        a correct focus of the image. A white glass plate,        mounted on a stand is of use in diffusing direct        sunlight so as to make it available for photographic        purposes, and three discs of yellow, blue and green        glass are provided which may be inserted over the iris-        diaphragm of the condenser when colored light is        required.          It is of great advantage to interpose an illuminating        lens between the source of light and the mirror, thereby        condensing the light-rays, giving a uniform illumination        and preventing the heating up of the entire stand, which        is a disturbing factor in retaining the focus. The        illuminating lens also serves to lessen the time of        exposure.          This photo-micrographic apparatus is also available when        it is desired to photograph gross specimens as, for        example, embryos, insects, etc., by reflected light, as        is represented in the figure on p. 86. The photographic        objective of 64 mm focal distance, is best adapted to        this purpose. It fits in a collar in the neck of the        camera and yields a magnified image of about 3        diameters. The object is brought into proper focus by        means of a small stand, the table of which may be raised        or lowered as required.

A polished wooden base, in which a lime wood drawing        tablet is inlaid, supports a wooden stand which in turn        holds a horizontal metal tube in which are a collecting        lens and a reflecting mirror. The upright also carries,        two arms, by rack and pinion adjustment, the one        supporting the object stage, the other regulating the        length of the camera. On the other side of the upright        is a support for a lamp. The rays of this lamp are        converged by the collecting lens upon the mirror, are        reflected downward to the object and through the        objective to the drawing board below. The various        adjustments permit considerable variation of        magnification with the same objective.

(#10)"],[1,"life it must be      got, it would be by tapping the disintegrated cap, and only so, that      it could be obtained. If Mars be inhabited, therefore, it is precisely      such a curious system we should expect to see, and only by such      explanation does it seem possible to account for the facts.        \"These lines are the so-called canals of Mars. It is not supposed that      what we see is the conduit itself. On the contrary, the behaviour of      these lines indicates that what we are looking at is vegetation. Now,      vegetation can only be induced by a water-supply. What we see      resembles the yearly inundation of the Nile, of which to a spectator      in space the river itself might be too narrow to be seen, and only the      verdured country on its banks be visible. This is what we suppose to      be the case with Mars. However the water be conducted, whether in      covered conduits, which seems probable, or not, science is not able to      state, but the effects of it are so palpable and so exactly in accord      with what such a system of irrigation would show, that we are      compelled to believe that such is indeed its _vera causa_.\"    Beside the bulky _Memoirs_ in which Prof. Lowell has published the  scientific results obtained at his observatory at Flagstaff, and papers  and articles appearing in various scientific journals, he has brought out  three books of a more popular character: \"_Mars_\"; \"_Mars and its  Canals_\"; and \"_Mars as the Abode of Life_.\" In these he shows that to the  assiduity of the astronomer he adds the missionary's zeal and eagerness  for converts as he pleads most skilfully for the acceptance of his chosen  doctrine of the presence of men on Mars. In the last of the three books  mentioned, he deals directly with \"Proofs of Life on Mars.\" The presence  of vegetation may be inferred from seasonal changes of tint, just as an  observer on the Moon might with the naked eye watch effects on the Earth.  But though \"vegetable life could thus reveal itself directly, animal life  could not. Not by its body but by its mind would it be known. Across the  gulf of space it could be recognized only by the imprint it had made on  the face of Mars.\"        \"Confronting the observer are lines and spots that but impress him the      more, as his study goes on, with their non-natural look. So uncommonly      regular are they, and on such a scale as to raise suspicions whether      they can be by nature regularly produced\" (p. 188).        \"... Unnatural regularity, the observations showed, betrays itself in      everything to do with the lines: in their surprising straightness,      their amazing uniformity throughout, their exceeding tenuity, and      their immense length\" (p. 189).        \"As a planet ages, its surface water grows scarce. Its oceans in time      dry up, its rivers cease to flow, its lakes evaporate (p. 203)....      Now, in the struggle for existence, water must be got.... Its      procuring depends on the intelligence of the organisms that stand in      need of it.... As a planet ages, any organisms upon it will share in      its development. They must evolve with it, indeed, or perish. At first      they change only, as environment offers opportunity, in a lowly,      unconscious way. But, as brain develops, they rise superior to such      occasioning.... The last stage in the expression of life upon a      planet's surface must be that just antecedent to its dying of      thirst.... With an intelligent population this inevitable end would be      long foreseen.... Both polar caps would be pressed into service in      order to utilize the whole available supply and also to accommodate      most easily the inhabitants of each hemisphere\" (pp. 204-11).        \"That intelligence should thus mutely communicate its existence to us      across the far reaches of space, itself remaining hid, appeals to all      that is highest and most far-reaching in man himself. More      satisfactory than strange this; for in no other way could the      habitation of the planet have been revealed. It simply shows again the      supremacy of mind.... Thus, not only do the observations we have      scanned lead us to the conclusion that Mars at this moment is      inhabited, but they land us at the further one that these denizens are      of an order whose acquaintance was worth the making\" (p. 215).    For the moment, let us leave Prof. Lowell's argument as he puts it.  Whether we accept it or not, it remains that it is a marvellous  achievement of the optician's skill and the observer's devotion that from  a planet so small and so distant as Mars any evidence should be  forthcoming at all that could bear upon the question of the existence of  intelligent organisms upon its surface. But it is of the utmost  significance to note that the whole question turns upon the presence of  water--of water in the liquid state, of water in a sufficient quantity;  and the final decision, for Mr. Lowell's contention, or against it, must  turn on that one point. The search for Life on Mars is essentially a  search for Water; a search for water, not only in the present state of  Mars, but in its past as well. For, without water in sufficient quantities  in the past, life on Mars could not have passed through the evolutionary  development necessary to its attaining its highest expression,--that where  the material living organism has become the tabernacle and instrument of  the conscious intelligent spirit.          CHAPTER VII    THE CONDITION OF MARS      The planet Mars is the debatable ground between two opinions. Here, the  two opposing views join issue; the controversy comes to a focus. The point  in debate is whether certain markings--some linear, some circular--are  natural or artificial. If, it is argued, some are truly like a line,  without curve or break, as if drawn with pen, ink, and ruler; or others,  so truly circular, without deviation or break, as if drawn with pen, ink,  and compass; if, moreover, when we obtain more powerful telescopes,  erected in better climates for observing, these markings become more truly  lines and circles the better we see them; then they are _artificial_, not  natural structures.    But artificial structures imply artificers. And if the structures are so  designed as to meet the needs of a living organism, it implies that the  living organism that designed them must have a reasonable mind lodged in a  natural body. If, then, the \"lines\" and \"circles\" that Prof. Lowell and  his disciples assert to be artificial canals and oases are really such,  they premise the order of being that we call Man. But these canals and  oases also premise the liquid that we call Water--water that flows and  water utilized in cultivation. In this chapter we will leave out of count  the first premiss--Man--and only deal with what concerns the second  premiss--Water; with water that flows and is utilized in vegetation.
