SUMMATION OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION      The localities from which hitherto unpublished notes on _Rangifer  arcticus arcticus_ are presented in this paper include the following.  Keewatin: Nueltin, Windy, \"Highway\" (at source of Putahow River), and  Ennadai lakes; Little Dubawnt, Kazan, Red, Windy, Little, and Thlewiaza  rivers; between Eskimo Point and Baker Lake. Manitoba: Nueltin (southern  part), Nejanilini, Reindeer, and Split lakes; Seal River; Churchill;  Cape Churchill; \"Little Barrens\" south of Churchill; between Churchill  and Knife Lake; Caribou Creek, 25 miles south of Churchill.  Saskatchewan: small lakes southwest of Reindeer Lake; lakes south of  Lake Athabaska. Details as to occurrence and status in these localities  are supplied on other pages.    The Caribou have been so thoroughly distributed over the approximately  300,000 square miles of the mainland Barren Grounds between Hudson Bay  and the Mackenzie Valley that it is fairly safe to say that there is  scarcely one square mile in this vast territory that has not been trod  by the animals during the past century. See maps by Preble (1908: pl.  19), Seton (1929, +3+: 60), Clarke (1940: figs. 3, 4), Banfield (1949:  479), and Anonymous (1952: 267).      The appended annotated bibliography supplies, in abstract form,    most of the hitherto published information on the geographical    distribution of _Rangifer arcticus arcticus_. In its preparation    I have included records of Caribou from the Arctic islands north    to Lancaster Sound, Barrow Strait, Viscount Melville Sound, and    McClure Strait--all approximately in latitude 74° N. This has    been done as a matter of having a convenient, well-defined    regional boundary, not with any conviction that _arcticus_ has    ranged so far to the north in the more westerly islands,    especially in recent years, when it is said to have become    restricted to the southern fringe of the islands (Clarke, 1940:    98; R. M. Anderson, 1947: 178; Banfield, 1949: fig. 1). The    islands north of latitude 74° are doubtless the exclusive domain    of _Rangifer pearyi_. It is possible that this species may also    occur to some extent on Banks, Victoria, Prince of Wales, and    Somerset islands. The typical _R. a. arcticus_, as currently    recognized, ranges eastward to Baffin, Salisbury, Coats, and    Southampton islands and to the western shore of Hudson Bay. (The    animals of the last three islands may be distinct insular    forms.) The southern limits of the winter range in northwestern    Ontario, central Manitoba, northern Saskatchewan, and    northeastern Alberta have been discussed in preceding pages. On    the west the range extends to the Mackenzie Delta (formerly),    Great Bear and Great Slave lakes, Wood Buffalo Park, and Lake    Claire. The timbered country (Hudsonian and Canadian Zones) is    practically entirely deserted by the Barren Ground Caribou in    mid-summer. At this season, in Keewatin at least, the animals    tend to draw away also from the southernmost portions of the    Barren Grounds.      _References._--Since practically every paper in the entire    bibliography presents some data on geographical distribution,    only a few, containing more than an average amount of new or    summarized information on the subject, have been selected for    inclusion in the following list of references: Hearne, 1795;    Franklin, 1823; Lyon, 1824; Franklin and Richardson, 1828;    Simpson, 1843; Pike, 1917 (1892); Russell, 1898; Preble, 1902;    Hanbury, 1904; Amundsen, 1908; Preble, 1908; R. M.

ECOLOGY      _Habitats_    Within their natural range the Caribou apparently resort to practically  every type of terrestrial and aquatic habitat (other than cliffs and  precipices). On the Barren Grounds proper they frequent the open summits  and slopes of the ridges, the dwarf birch thickets, the sedge bogs, and  the peat bogs. Their trails traverse all the upland spruce and tamarack  tracts, the wooded muskegs, and the willow thickets along the rivers. In  the summer and fall they swim the rivers and the narrower lakes, and  during the winter and spring they cross these on the ice. They do not  avoid rapids; in fact, they seek the shallower ones as fords, and they  swim the deeper ones (_cf._ Clarke, 1940: 88). They also cross the  tundra ponds on the ice, but probably walk around these smaller bodies  of water, as a rule, when they are not frozen. While they may prefer to  approach the river crossings over open slopes, they do not hesitate to  maintain trails through the dense thickets of willow on the banks.    The winter habitat of the major part of the Barren Ground Caribou  population comprises the Hudsonian and upper Canadian Zones. This  forested habitat is characterized by sparser and smaller timber in the  Hudsonian Zone and by denser and taller timber in the Canadian Zone.  Important among the features of this winter habitat are the frozen  surfaces of the lakes and rivers, where the Caribou are wont to  congregate for their daily periods of rest (_cf._ Mallet, 1926: 79;  Ingstad, 1933: 86).      _Trails_    The favorite migratory highways are the long, sinuous ridges that  stretch across the Barren Grounds in a sufficiently approximate  north-south direction to serve the needs of the Caribou. Here their  age-old trails are particularly in evidence and may even be detected  from the air. A single small ridge may bear half a dozen or more such  trails (fig. 1), roughly parallel but anastomosing at frequent  intervals. They probably change but little from generation to  generation. They provide the smoothest courses available, avoiding rocks  and shrubs and traversing intervening bogs at the most suitable points.  The summits of the ridges constitute vantage points from which the  animals may keep a wide lookout for Wolves and human enemies, and on  which they may obtain the maximum benefit from fly-deterring breezes.  Man himself is glad to utilize these trails, whether on the Barrens or  in the timber tracts, wherever they lead in a direction he desires. They  are kept open by the hurrying feet of hundreds or thousands of Caribou  every year.    Along a well-used trail extending through low Barrens near Duck"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33767"],[0,"Campward Ho! A Manual for Girl Scout Camps (#10)"],[1,"plumbing, a stove with a hot water tank  is desirable. If this is impossible a large boiler must be kept filled  with water on the top of the stove.    An army range, set on a concrete base, gives the greatest satisfaction  in a large camp. The ovens are large, an important point, and the top of  the stove large enough to care for all necessary pots and kettles. When  buying a stove for camp use make sure that it is made for the kind of  fuel which will be used in it.    The kitchen sink should be conveniently placed and large enough to hold  a large dish pan. Again if there is no plumbing a long table for dish  pans, draining pans, etc., should be provided.    Other tables, benches, shelves and a wood box are necessary.    Tables and benches are necessary in every camp. The more simple they are  the better. Tables made of pine boards, and tops covered with white oil  cloth are very serviceable, or better, tables with planed tops can be  used. Table tops and rests are feasible also. Benches can be made in  various ways but should be firm and of the right height. Chairs are not  really a camp necessity and on the whole could well be left out of the  list of camp furniture.      Lanterns    Every camp, large or small, needs lanterns. Lamps are not advised as a  general rule. There should be enough to have sufficient light in the  mess hall, in the kitchen, at least one in the wash house, one at each  latrine, and for stormy and very dark nights one for every two tents,  or group of tents. The tent lanterns can be hung on the tent posts  outside of the tents which method will prevent mosquitoes from being  attracted inside. Latrine lights should burn all night and it is  advisable to leave one burning by the mess hall in case of emergency.  Never allow children to bring candles into camp. Flash lights are a  convenience and harmless.    [Illustration: LAND DRILL]    A lantern which is not clean and shining and ready for use is a disgrace  to any camp. Every morning chimneys should be washed and wiped, lanterns  filled, wiped clean, wicks wiped off with a piece of newspaper and  turned down. They do not need to be trimmed every day. Have a place for  the lanterns to hang or stand during the day. The lamp cloths should be  washed, dried in the sun and hung where they will not be caught up and  used for other purposes.      Double Boiler    A very good double boiler can be made by using a large outer boiler in  the bottom of which is placed a pot rest and a small amount of water.  Stand on the rest either one kettle well covered, or if necessary, two  kettles, one on top of the other, both tightly covered and the outer  boiler tightly covered. This arrangement forms a kind of fire-less  cooker which is exceedingly satisfactory, especially for cooking  cereals.      Trash Boxes    Each tent or group of tents should have a conveniently placed trash box.  These can be made of wooden frames covered with screening, can be small  half-barrels or kegs, painted, or small portable incinerators. These  boxes should be emptied every twenty-four hours and the contents burned.      Weighing Scales    Another piece of furniture is a pair of personal scales, for the weight  of each child entering and leaving camp is of interest and value. Do not  use form with springs.      Games    The game equipment must not be forgotten. Basket balls, volley balls,  water polo balls, baseballs and bats, quoits, bows and arrows, and  tennis sets are all valuable.      Linen    If in the general equipment pillows are provided it is well to have a  few pillow cases other than those which the child brings to camp. There  should be sheets and pillow cases for use in the bed making test. Three  sets of dish towels and a set of dish cloths, holders, stove cloths and  kitchen hand towels. Cheese cloth is of great value in camp in the  kitchen and out of it.    [Illustration: THE DIVING LESSON]      Newspapers    Do not throw away any clean whole newspapers; they are of too great  value. Wet shoes stuffed with pieces of newspaper and stood not too near  a fire, will dry in good shape and be soft. The newspapers help to  absorb the moisture out of the leather and keep the shoes in shape.    Newspapers can be used to sit upon if benches or ground are damp.    Nothing is better for cleaning the top of a stove after each meal, than  a newspaper crunched into a wad.    Folded pieces of newspaper make an excellent holder for lifting pots and  kettles. Several thicknesses placed on the end of the kitchen table on  which to set pots and cans, will keep the table clean. Hot water pipes  or a boiler can be covered with several thicknesses of newspapers held  in place by twine, thereby conserving heat. Cover the ice cream freezer  with newspapers after the dasher is removed and while the cream is  getting stiff. They help to keep in the cold. Newspapers laid on a cot  under the blankets help very materially to keep one warm on a cold  night. After sweeping a floor put the dust and dirt from a dust pan in a  newspaper, roll it carefully and burn in the incinerator. The wind  cannot then blow the dirt about.      Flowers    When picking flowers do not pull the plants up by the root. Do not pick  a blossom with too many buds on the stem. Do not pick what you are not  going to use either as a decoration or to press for nature study work.  Do not pick short stems, and do not crowd too many flowers into one  vase. Be sure that the vase is clean and the water fresh. All dead  flowers and leaves should be burned and not thrown out to disfigure the  looks of the camp grounds.    [Illustration: THE TRUE INWARDNESS OF ROWING]    If you do not know poison ivy when you see it get someone to point it  out to you and then keep away from it. It is more apt to poison when the  leaves are wet.      PERSONAL EQUIPMENT      _Clothes_: Scout uniform and Scout hat               Bloomers: dark wool or khaki               Middy blouses, at least 3; plain, strong, white               Coat               Rubber coat or poncho               Sweater               Shoes (stout, low heels, round toes; two pairs if                   possible)               Rubbers               Underwear: Plain and strong. The one-piece                  athletic garment made for women and girls                  is preferable to separate chemise or drawers.                  Woven shirt or union suit of cotton or light                  wool is desirable. No petticoats.                 Stockings: at least four pairs, heavy ribbed                  cotton or wool preferred. No silk.                 Nightgown or pajamas, three, heavy cotton or                  canton flannel.                 Bath wrapper and slippers                 Bathing suit and cap      _Bedding_: Plain woolen blankets, light-weight, for use next body                  Pillow cases, (three)      _Toilet    Accessories_: Bath and face towels, two each                  Face cloths, two                  Comb and brush                  Tooth brush in holder                  Soap and tooth paste                  Soap box                  Small cup                  Scissors                  Nail file or cleaner                  Sanitary napkins and belt      _Desirable    General    Accessories_: Musical Instruments                  Flashlight                  Note book or pad and pencils                  Sewing kit      THE CANTEEN    There have been objections made to the camp canteen or store, but there  seem to be no very good reasons against it. By buying large quantities  and at wholesale and selling at the market price in small quantities  there can be a perfectly legitimate profit on a camp canteen. This helps  to pay camp expenses. It is also possible to make an arrangement with  local stores to supply merchandise, fruit and candy to be sold at the  store price, and receive from the store a ten per cent discount which is  clear profit to the camp. A greater profit, however, can be obtained if  the camp purchases these things for itself from wholesale dealers.    The price of board in the average Scout camp is so low that it is  impossible to supply campers with many of the things which they want and  which they may have. Fresh fruit in some localities is very expensive  and quite beyond the possibility of serving. But most parents make no  objection to their children purchasing the fruit, one or two pieces at a  time, at the canteen counter. The same is true of simple candy such as  sweet chocolate, Hershey Bars, Neccos, etc. One piece a day is not only  perfectly harmless; it is, in fact, beneficial.    Other things that can be sold in the canteen are stationery, stamps,  plain postal cards, picture postal cards, hair pins, pins, shoe laces,  needles and thread, kodak films, bathing caps, soap, and pencils.    The best time for having the canteen open is determined by the rule that  Scouts do not eat between meals. For this reason it is better to sell  fruit and candy either directly after dinner or directly after supper.  For many reasons it is much more convenient and fully as well for the  child to have the canteen open after supper, especially when that meal  is served at half-past five.    The question as to whether Scouts should be allowed to receive packages  of food from home is one which every camp Director has to decide.  Probably nothing causes more unhappiness than the fact that some girls  receive no packages while others have many. The most serious phase is  that boxes often contain food which is not best for the girl. Then, too,  packages have been sent by parcel post so badly wrapped and packed that  when received at the local post office the authorities have complained  to the camp Director. The condition of fruit or other food was such as  to be a menace.    [Illustration: MAKING CAMP ON AN OVERNIGHT HIKE.
