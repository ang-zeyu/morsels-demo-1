He determined to obtain time.    \"No wonder,\" said he, \"that I appear guilty in the eyes of His Highness.  This seal is, certainly mine, I cannot deny it; but the writing is not  that of my secretaries, and the seal must have been obtained and used to  sign these guilty letters in order to ruin me. I pray you to grant me a  few days in order to clear up this iniquitous mystery, which compromises  me in the eyes of my master the sultan and of all good Mahommedans. May  Allah grant me the means of proving my innocence, which is as pure as  the rays of the sun, although everything seems against me!\"    After this conference, Ali, pretending to be engaged in a secret  inquiry, considered how he could legally escape from this predicament.  He spent some days in making plans which were given up as soon as  formed, until his fertile genius at length suggested a means of getting  clear of one of the greatest difficulties in which he had ever found  himself. Sending for a Greek whom he had often employed, he addressed  him thus:    \"Thou knowest I have always shown thee favour, and the day is arrived  when thy fortune shall be made. Henceforth thou shalt be as my son, thy  children shall be as mine, my house shall be thy home, and in return for  my benefits I require one small service. This accursed kapidgi-bachi has  come hither bringing certain papers signed with my seal, intending to  use them to my discredit, and thus to extort money from me. Of money I  have already given too much, and I intend this time to escape without  being plundered except for the sake of a good servant like thee.  Therefore, my son, thou shalt go before the tribunal when I tell thee,  and declare before this kapidgi-bachi and the cadi that thou hast  written these letters attributed to me, and that thou didst seal them  with my seal, in order to give them due weight and importance.\"    The unhappy Greek grew pale and strove to answer.    \"What fearest thou, my son?\" resumed Ali. \"Speak, am I not thy good  master? Thou wilt be sure of my lasting favour, and who is there to  dread when I protect thee? Is it the kapidgi-bachi? he has no authority  here. I have thrown twenty as good as he into the lake! If more is  required to reassure thee, I swear by the Prophet, by my own and my  sons' heads, that no harm shall come to thee from him. Be ready, then,  to do as I tell thee, and beware of mentioning this matter to anyone, in  order that all may be accomplished according to our mutual wishes.\"    More terrified by dread of the pacha, from whose wrath in case of  refusal there was no chance of escape, than tempted by his promises, the  Greek undertook the false swearing required. Ali, delighted, dismissed  him with a thousand assurances of protection, and then requested the  presence of the sultan's envoy, to whom he said, with much emotion:    \"I have at length unravelled the infernal plot laid against me; it is  the work of a man in the pay of the implacable enemies of the Sublime  Porte, and who is a Russian agent. He is in my power, and I have given  him hopes of pardon on condition of full confession. Will you then  summon the cadi, the judges and ecclesiastics of the town, in order that  they may hear the guilty man's deposition, and that the light of truth  may purify their minds?\"    The tribunal was soon assembled, and the trembling Greek appeared in the  midst of a solemn silence. \"Knowest thou this writing?\" demanded the  cadi.--\"It is mine.\"--\"And this seal?\"--\"It is that of my master, Ali  Pacha.\"--\"How does it come to be placed at the foot of these  letters?\"--\"I did this by order of my chief, abusing the confidence of  my master, who occasionally allowed me to use it to sign his  orders.\"--\"It is enough: thou canst withdraw.\"    Uneasy as to the success of his intrigue, Ali was approaching the Hall  of Justice. As he entered the court, the Greek, who had just finished  his examination, threw himself at his feet, assuring him that all had  gone well. \"It is good,\" said Ali; \"thou shalt have thy reward.\" Turning  round, he made a sign to his guards, who had their orders, and who  instantly seized the unhappy Greek, and, drowning his voice with their  shouts, hung him in the courtyard. This execution finished, the pacha  presented himself before the judges and inquired the result of their  investigation. He was answered by a burst of congratulation. \"Well,\"  said he, \"the guilty author of this plot aimed at me is no more; I  ordered him to be hung without waiting to hear your decision. May all  enemies of our glorious sultan perish even as he!\"    A report of what had occurred was immediately drawn up, and, to assist  matters still further, Ali sent the kapidgi-bachi a gift of fifty  purses, which he accepted without difficulty, and also secured the  favour of the Divan by considerable presents. The sultan, yielding to  the advice of his councillors, appeared to have again received him into  favour.    But Ali knew well that this appearance of sunshine was entirely  deceptive, and that Selim only professed to believe in his innocence  until the day should arrive when the sultan could safely punish his  treason. He sought therefore to compass the latter's downfall, and made  common cause with his enemies, both internal and external. A conspiracy,  hatched between the discontented pachas and the English agents, shortly  broke out, and one day, when Ali was presiding at the artillery practice  of some French gunners sent to Albania by the Governor of Illyria, a  Tartar brought him news of the deposition of Selim, who was succeeded by  his nephew Mustapha. Ali sprang up in delight, and publicly thanked  Allah for this great good fortune. He really did profit by this change  of rulers, but he profited yet more by a second revolution which caused  the deaths both of Selim, whom the promoters wished to reestablish on  the throne, and of Mustapha whose downfall they intended. Mahmoud II,  who was next invested with the scimitar of Othman, came to the throne in  troublous times, after much bloodshed, in the midst of great political  upheavals, and had neither the will nor the power to attack one of his  most powerful vassals. He received with evident satisfaction the million  piastres which, at, his installation, Ali hastened to send as a proof of  his devotion, assured the pacha of his favour, and confirmed both him  and his sons in their offices and dignities. This fortunate change in  his position brought Ali's pride and audacity to a climax. Free from  pressing anxiety, he determined to carry out a project which had been  the dream of his life.          CHAPTER V      After taking possession of Argyro-Castron, which he had long coveted,  Ali led his victorious army against the town of Kardiki, whose  inhabitants had formerly joined with those of Kormovo in the outrage  inflicted on his mother and sister. The besieged, knowing they had no  mercy to hope for, defended themselves bravely, but were obliged to  yield to famine. After a month's blockade, the common people, having no  food for themselves or their cattle, began to cry for mercy in the open  streets, and their chiefs, intimidated by the general misery and unable  to stand alone, consented to capitulate. Ali, whose intentions as to the  fate of this unhappy town were irrevocably decided, agreed to all that  they asked. A treaty was signed by both parties, and solemnly sworn to  on the Koran, in virtue of which seventy-two beys, heads of the  principal Albanian families, were to go to Janina as free men, and fully  armed. They were to be received with the honours due to their rank as  free tenants of the sultan, their lives and their families were to be  spared, and also their possessions. The other inhabitants of Kardiki,  being Mohammedans, and therefore brothers of Ali, were to be treated as  friends and retain their lives and property. On these conditions a  quarter of the town; was to be occupied by the victorious troops.    One of the principal chiefs, Saleh Bey, and his wife, foreseeing the  fate which awaited their friends, committed suicide at the moment when,  in pursuance of the treaty, Ali's soldiers took possession of the  quarter assigned to them.    Ali received the seventy-two beys with all marks of friendship when they  arrived at Janina. He lodged them in a palace on the lake, and treated  them magnificently for some days. But soon, having contrived on some  pretext to disarm them, he had them conveyed, loaded with chains, to a  Greek convent on an island in the lake, which was converted into a  prison. The day of vengeance not having fully arrived, he explained this  breach of faith by declaring that the hostages had attempted to escape.    The popular credulity was satisfied by this explanation, and no one  doubted the good faith of the pacha when he announced that he was going  to Kardiki to establish a police and fulfil the promises he had made to  the inhabitants. Even the number of soldiers he took excited no  surprise, as Ali was accustomed to travel with a very numerous suite.    After three days' journey, he stopped at Libokhovo, where his sister had  resided since the death of Aden Bey, her second son, cut off recently by  wickness. What passed in the long interview they had no one knew, but it  was observed that Chainitza's tears, which till then had flowed  incessantly, stopped as if by magic, and her women, who were wearing  mourning, received an order to attire themselves as for a festival.  Feasting and dancing, begun in Ali's honour, did not cease after his  departure.    He spent the night at Chenderia, a castle built on a rock, whence the  town of Kardiki was plainly visible. Next day at daybreak Ali despatched  an usher to summon all the male inhabitants of Kardiki to appear before  Chenderia, in order to receive assurances of the pacha's pardon and  friendship.    The Kardikiotes at once divined that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2754"],[0,"The Countess of Saint Geran (#10)"],[1,"him. The truth shone out with great lustre  through these new facts which gushed from all this fresh information.  The child, exhibited in the presence of a legal commissary to the nurses  and witnesses of Torcy, was identified, as much by the scars left by the  midwife's nails on his head, as by his fair hair and blue eyes. This  ineffaceable vestige of the woman's cruelty was the principal proof; the  witnesses testified that la Pigoreau, when she visited this child with a  man who appeared to be of condition, always asserted that he was the son  of a great nobleman who had been entrusted to her care, and that she  hoped he would make her fortune and that of those who had reared him.    The child's godfather, Paul Marmiou, a common labourer; the grocer  Raguenet, who had charge of the two thousand livres; the servant of la  Pigoreau, who had heard her say that the count was obliged to take this  child; the witnesses who proved that la Pigoreau had told them that the  child was too well born to wear a page's livery, all furnished  convincing proofs; but others were forthcoming.    It was at la Pigoreau's that the Marquis de Saint-Maixent, living then  at the hotel de Saint-Geran, went to see the child, kept in her house as  if it were hers; Prudent Berger, the marquis's page, perfectly well  remembered la Pigoreau, and also the child, whom he had seen at her  house and whose history the marquis had related to him. Finally, many  other witnesses heard in the course of the case, both before the three  chambers of nobles, clergy, and the tiers etat, and before the judges of  Torcy, Cusset, and other local magistrates, made the facts so clear and  conclusive in favour of the legitimacy of the young count, that it was  impossible to avoid impeaching the guilty parties. The count ordered the  summons in person of la Pigoreau, who had not been compromised in the  original preliminary proceedings. This drastic measure threw the  intriguing woman on her beam ends, but she strove hard to right herself.    The widowed Duchess de Ventadour, daughter by her mother's second  marriage of the Countess dowager of Saint-Geran, and half-sister of the  count, and the Countess de Lude, daughter of the Marchioness de Bouille,  from whom the young count carried away the Saint-Geran inheritance, were  very warm in the matter, and spoke of disputing the judgment. La  Pigoreau went to see them, and joined in concert with them.    Then commenced this famous lawsuit, which long occupied all France, and  is parallel in some respects, but not in the time occupied in the  hearing, to the case heard by Solomon, in which one child was claimed by  two mothers.    The Marquis de Saint-Maixent and Madame de Bouille being dead, were  naturally no parties to the suit, which was fought against the  Saint-Geran family by la Pigoreau and Mesdames du Lude and de Ventadour.  These ladies no doubt acted in good faith, at first at any rate, in  refusing to believe the crime; for if they had originally known the  truth it is incredible that they could have fought the case so long aid  so obstinately.    They first of all went to the aid of the midwife, who had fallen sick in  prison; they then consulted together, and resolved as follows:    That the accused should appeal against criminal proceedings;    That la Pigoreau should lodge a civil petition against the judgments  which ordered her arrest and the confronting of witnesses;    That they should appeal against the abuse of obtaining and publishing  monitories, and lodge an interpleader against the sentence of the judge  of first instruction, who had condemned the matron to capital  punishment;    And that finally, to carry the war into the enemy's camp, la Pigoreau  should impugn the maternity of the countess, claiming the child as her  own; and that the ladies should depose that the countess's accouchement  was an imposture invented to cause it to be supposed that she had given  birth to a child.    For more safety and apparent absence of collusion Mesdames du Lude and  de Ventadour pretended to have no communication with la Pigoreau.    About this time the midwife died in prison, from an illness which  vexation and remorse had aggravated. After her death, her son Guillemin  confessed that she had often told him that the countess had given birth  to a son whom Baulieu had carried off, and that the child entrusted to  Baulieu at the chateau Saint-Geran was the same as the one recovered;  the youth added that he had concealed this fact so long as it might  injure his mother, and he further stated that the ladies de Ventadour  and du Lude had helped her in prison with money and advice--another  strong piece of presumptive evidence.    The petitions of the accused and the interpleadings of Mesdames du Lude  and de Ventadour were discussed in seven hearings, before three courts  convened. The suit proceeded with all the languor and chicanery of the  period.    After long and specious arguments, the attorney general Bijnon gave his  decision in favour of the Count and Countess of Saint-Geran, concluding  thus:--    \"The court rejects the civil appeal of la Pigoreau; and all the  opposition and appeals of the appellants and the defendants; condemns  them to fine and in costs; and seeing that the charges against la  Pigoreau were of a serious nature, and that a personal summons had been  decreed against her, orders her committal, recommending her to the  indulgence of the court.\"    By a judgment given in a sitting at the Tournelle by M. de Mesmes, on  the 18th of August 1657, the appellant ladies' and the defendants'  opposition was rejected with fine and costs. La Pigoreau was forbidden  to leave the city and suburbs of Paris under penalty of summary  conviction. The judgment in the case followed the rejection of the  appeal.    This reverse at first extinguished the litigation of Mesdames du Lude  and de Ventadour, but it soon revived more briskly than ever. These  ladies, who had taken la Pigoreau in their coach to all the hearings,  prompted her, in order to procrastinate, to file a fresh petition, in  which she demanded the confrontment of all the witnesses to the  pregnancy, and the confinement. On hearing this petition, the court gave  on the 28th of August 1658 a decree ordering the confrontment, but on  condition that for three days previously la Pigoreau should deliver  herself a prisoner in the Conciergerie.    This judgment, the consequences of which greatly alarmed la Pigoreau,  produced such an effect upon her that, after having weighed the interest  she had in the suit, which she would lose by flight, against the danger  to her life if she ventured her person into the hands of justice, she  abandoned her false plea of maternity, and took refuge abroad. This last  circumstance was a heavy blow to Mesdames du Lude and de Ventadour; but  they were not at the end of their resources and their obstinacy.    Contempt of court being decreed against la Pigoreau, and the case being  got up against the other defendants, the Count de Saint-Geran left for  the Bourbonnais, to put in execution the order to confront the  witnesses. Scarcely had he arrived in the province when he was obliged  to interrupt his work to receive the king and the queen mother, who were  returning from Lyons and passing through Moulins. He presented the Count  de la Palice to their Majesties as his son; they received him as such.  But during the visit of the king and queen the Count de Saint-Geran fell  ill, over fatigued, no doubt, by the trouble he had taken to give them a  suitable reception, over and above the worry of his own affairs.    During his illness, which only lasted a week, he made in his will a new  acknowledgment of his son, naming his executors M. de Barriere,  intendant of the province, and the sieur Vialet, treasurer of France,  desiring them to bring the lawsuit to an end. His last words were for  his wife and child; his only regret that he had not been able to  terminate this affair. He died on the 31st of January 1659.    The maternal tenderness of the countess did not need stimulating by the  injunctions of her husband, and she took up the suit with energy. The  ladies de Ventadour and du Lude obtained by default letters of  administration as heiresses without liability, which were granted out of  the Chatelet. At the same time they appealed against the judgment of the  lieutenant-general of the Bourbonnais, giving the tutelage of the young  count to the countess his mother, and his guardianship to sieur de  Bompre. The countess, on her side, interpleaded an appeal against the  granting of letters of administration without liability, and did all in  her power to bring back the case to the Tournelle. The other ladies  carried their appeal to the high court, pleading that they were not  parties to the lawsuit in the Tournelle.    It would serve no purpose to follow the obscure labyrinth of legal  procedure of that period, and to recite all the marches and  countermarches which legal subtlety suggested to the litigants. At the  end of three years, on the 9th of April 1661, the countess obtained a  judgment by which the king in person:        \"Assuming to his own decision the civil suit pending at the       Tournelle, as well as the appeals pled by both parties, and the       last petition of Mesdames du Lude and de Ventadour, sends back       the whole case to the three assembled chambers of the States       General, to be by them decided on its merits either jointly or       separately, as they may deem fit.\"    The countess thus returned to her first battlefield. Legal science  produced an immense quantity of manuscript, barristers and attorneys  greatly distinguishing themselves in their calling. After an  interminable hearing, and pleadings longer and more complicated than  ever, which however did not bamboozle the court, judgment was pronounced  in Conformity with the summing up of the attorney-general"]]]
