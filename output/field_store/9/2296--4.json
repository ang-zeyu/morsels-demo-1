GRT or gross  register tonnage is a figure obtained by measuring the entire sheltered  volume of a ship available for cargo and passengers and converting it  to tons on the basis of 100 cubic feet per ton; there is no stable  relationship between GRT and DWT.    Ships by type includes a listing of barge carriers, bulk cargo ships,  cargo ships, chemical tankers, combination bulk carriers, combination  ore/oil carriers, container ships, liquefied gas tankers, livestock  carriers, multifunctional large-load carriers, petroleum tankers,  passenger ships, passenger/cargo ships, railcar carriers, refrigerated  cargo ships, roll-on/roll-off cargo ships, short-sea passenger ships,  specialized tankers, and vehicle carriers.    Foreign-owned are ships that fly the flag of one country but belong to  owners in another.    Registered in other countries are ships that belong to owners in one  country but fly the flag of another.      Military:  This category includes the entries dealing with a country's  military structure, manpower, and expenditures.    Military - note:  This entry includes miscellaneous military  information of significance not included elsewhere.    Military branches:  This entry lists the service branches subordinate  to defense ministries or the equivalent (typically ground, naval, air,  and marine forces).    Military expenditures - dollar figure:  This entry gives spending on  defense programs in US dollars for the most recent year available;  dollar figures for military expenditures should be treated with caution  because of different price patterns and accounting methods among  nations, as well as wide variations in the strength of different  currencies.    Military expenditures - percent of GDP:  This entry gives spending on  defense programs for the most recent year available as a percent of  gross domestic product (GDP); the GDP is calculated on an exchange rate  basis, i.e., not in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP).    Military service age and obligation:  This entry gives the required  ages for voluntary or conscript military service and the length of  sevice obligation.    Money figures:  All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US  dollars unless otherwise indicated.    National holiday:  This entry gives the primary national day of  celebration - usually independence day.    Nationality:  This entry provides the identifying terms for citizens -  noun and adjective.    Natural gas - consumption:  This entry is the total natural gas  consumed in cubic meters (cu m). The discrepancy between the amount of  natural gas produced and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or  exported is due to the omission of stock changes and other complicating  factors.    Natural gas - exports:  This entry is the total natural gas exported in  cubic meters (cu m).    Natural gas - imports:  This entry is the total natural gas imported in  cubic meters (cu m).    Natural gas - production:  This entry is the total natural gas produced  in cubic meters (cu m). The discrepancy between the amount of natural  gas produced and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is  due to the omission of stock changes and other complicating factors.    Natural gas - proved reserves:  This entry is the stock of proved  reserves of natural gas in cubic meters (cu m). Proved reserves are  those quantities of natural gas, which, by analysis of geological and  engineering data, can be estimated with a high degree of confidence to  be commercially recoverable from a given date forward, from known  reservoirs and under current economic conditions.    Natural hazards:  This entry lists potential natural disasters.    Natural resources:  This entry lists a country's mineral, petroleum,  hydropower, and other resources of commercial importance.    Net migration rate:  This entry includes the figure for the difference  between the number of persons entering and leaving a country during the  year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear population). An excess of  persons entering the country is referred to as net immigration (e.g.,  3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the  country as net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000 population). The  net migration rate indicates the contribution of migration to the  overall level of population change. High levels of migration can cause  problems such as increasing unemployment and potential ethnic strife  (if people are coming in) or a reduction in the labor force, perhaps in  certain key sectors (if people are leaving).    Oil - consumption:  This entry is the total oil consumed in barrels per  day (bbl/day). The discrepancy between the amount of oil produced  and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is due to the  omission of stock changes, refinery gains, and other complicating  factors.    Oil - exports:  This entry is the total oil exported in barrels per day  (bbl/day), including both crude oil and oil products.    Oil - imports:  This entry is the total oil imported in barrels per day  (bbl/day), including both crude oil and oil products.    Oil - production:  This entry is the total oil produced in barrels per  day (bbl/day). The discrepancy between the amount of oil produced  and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is due to the  omission of stock changes, refinery gains, and other complicating  factors.    Oil - proved reserves:  This entry is the stock of proved reserves of  crude oil in barrels (bbl). Proved reserves are those quantities of  petroleum which, by analysis of geological and engineering data, can be  estimated with a high degree of confidence to be commercially  recoverable from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under  current economic conditions.    People:  This category includes the entries dealing with the  characteristics of the people and their society.    People - note:  This entry includes miscellaneous demographic  information of significance not included elsewhere.    Personal Names - Capitalization:  The Factbook capitalizes the surname  or family name of individuals for the convenience of our users who are  faced with a world of different cultures and naming conventions. The  need for capitalization, bold type, underlining, italics, or some other  indicator of the individual's surname is apparent in the following  examples: MAO Zedong, Fidel CASTRO Ruz, George W. BUSH, and TUNKU  SALAHUDDIN Abdul Aziz Shah ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Hisammuddin Alam Shah.  By knowing the surname, a short form without all capital letters can be  used with confidence as in President Castro, Chairman Mao, President  Bush, or Sultan Tunku Salahuddin. The same system of capitalization is  extended to the names of leaders with surnames that are not commonly  used such as Queen ELIZABETH II. For Vietnamese names, the given name  is capitalized because officials are referred to by their given name  rather than by their surname. For example, the president of Vietnam is  Tran Duc LUONG. His surname is Tran, but he is referred to by his given  name - President LUONG.    Personal Names - Spelling:  The romanization of personal names in the  Factbook normally follows the same transliteration system used by the  US Board on Geographic Names for spelling place names. At times,  however, a foreign leader expressly indicates a preference for, or the  media or official documents regularly use, a romanized spelling that  differs from the transliteration derived from the US Government  standard. In such cases, the Factbook uses the alternative spelling.    Personal Names - Titles:  The Factbook capitalizes any valid title (or  short form of it) immediately preceding a person's name. A title  standing alone is not capitalized. Examples: President PUTIN and  President BUSH are chiefs of state. In Russia, the president is chief  of state and the premier is the head of the government, while in the  US, the president is both chief of state and head of government.    Petroleum:  See entries under Oil.    Petroleum products:  See entries under Oil.    Pipelines:  This entry gives the lengths and types of pipelines for  transporting products like natural gas, crude oil, or petroleum  products.    Political parties and leaders:  This entry includes a listing of  significant political organizations and their leaders.    Political pressure groups and leaders:  This entry includes a listing  of organizations with leaders involved in politics, but not standing  for legislative election.    Population:  This entry gives an estimate from the US Bureau of the  Census based on statistics from population censuses, vital statistics  registration systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past  and on assumptions about future trends. The total population presents  one overall measure of the potential impact of the country on the world  and within its region. Note: starting with the 1993 Factbook,  demographic estimates for some countries (mostly African) have  explicitly taken into account the effects of the growing impact of the  HIV/AIDS epidemic. These countries are currently: The Bahamas, Benin,  Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon,  Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of  the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guyana, Haiti,  Honduras, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda,  South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and  Zimbabwe.    Population below poverty line:  National estimates of the percentage of  the population falling below the poverty line are based on surveys of  sub-groups, with the results weighted by the number of people in each  group. Definitions of poverty vary considerably among nations. For  example, rich nations generally employ more generous standards of  poverty than poor nations.

This morning, however, all was very quiet round the old inn. The birds  were singing, and the bees humming in the pleasant sunshine. The house  looked clean and tidy, and no one was to be seen except three persons  bending over a table, with their heads close together, deeply absorbed  in whatever business they were engaged in. Two of these persons were  Dame Bedard, the sharp landlady of the Crown of France, and her no less  sharp and pretty daughter, Zoe. The third person of the trio was an old,  alert-looking little man, writing at the table as if for very life.  He wore a tattered black robe, shortened at the knees to facilitate  walking, a frizzled wig, looking as if it had been dressed with a  currycomb, a pair of black breeches, well-patched with various colors;  and gamaches of brown leather, such as the habitans wore, completed his  odd attire, and formed the professional costume of Master Pothier  dit Robin, the travelling notary, one of that not unuseful order of  itinerants of the law which flourished under the old regime in New  France.    Upon the table near him stood a black bottle, an empty trencher, and a  thick scatter of crumbs, showing that the old notary had despatched a  hearty breakfast before commencing his present work of the pen.    A hairy knapsack lay open upon the table near his elbow, disclosing some  bundles of dirty papers tied up with red tape, a tattered volume or two  of the \"Coutume de Paris,\" and little more than the covers of an odd  tome of Pothier, his great namesake and prime authority in the law. Some  linen, dirty and ragged as his law papers, was crammed into his knapsack  with them. But that was neither here nor there in the estimation of  the habitans, so long as his law smelt strong in the nostrils of  their opponents in litigation. They rather prided themselves upon the  roughness of their travelling notary.    The reputation of Master Pothier dit Robin was, of course, very great  among the habitans, as he travelled from parish to parish and from  seigniory to seigniory, drawing bills and hypothecations, marriage  contracts and last wills and testaments, for the peasantry, who had  a genuine Norman predilection for law and chicanery, and a respect  amounting to veneration for written documents, red tape, and  sealing-wax. Master Pothier's acuteness in picking holes in the actes of  a rival notary was only surpassed by the elaborate intricacy of his own,  which he boasted, not without reason, would puzzle the Parliament of  Paris, and confound the ingenuity of the sharpest advocates of Rouen.  Master Pothier's actes were as full of embryo disputes as a fig is full  of seeds, and usually kept all parties in hot water and litigation  for the rest of their days. If he did happen now and then to settle a  dispute between neighbors, he made ample amends for it by setting half  the rest of the parish by the ears.    Master Pothier's nose, sharp and fiery as if dipped in red ink, almost  touched the sheet of paper on the table before him, as he wrote down  from the dictation of Dame Bedard the articles of a marriage contract  between her pretty daughter, Zoe, and Antoine La Chance, the son of a  comfortable but keen widow of Beauport.    Dame Bedard had shrewdly availed herself of the presence of Master  Pothier, and in payment of a night's lodging at the Crown of France, to  have him write out the contract of marriage in the absence of Dame  La Chance, the mother of Antoine, who would, of course, object to the  insertion of certain conditions in the contract which Dame Bedard was  quite determined upon as the price of Zoe's hand and fortune.    \"There! Dame Bedard!\" cried Master Pothier, sticking the pen behind his  ear, after a magnificent flourish at the last word, \"there is a marriage  contract fit to espouse King Solomon to the Queen of Sheba! A dowry of  a hundred livres tournoises, two cows, and a feather bed, bedstead, and  chest of linen! A donation entre vifs!\"    \"A what? Master Pothier, now mind! are you sure that is the right word  of the grimoire?\" cried Dame Bedard, instinctively perceiving that here  lay the very point of the contract. \"You know I only give on condition,  Master Pothier.\"    \"Oh, yes! trust me, Dame Bedard. I have made it a donation entre vifs,  revocable pour cause d'ingratitude, if your future son-in-law, Antoine  la Chance, should fail in his duty to you and to Zoe.\"    \"And he won't do his duty to Zoe, unless he does it to me, Master  Pothier. But are you sure it is strong enough? Will it hold Dame La  Chance by the foot, so that she cannot revoke her gifts although I may  revoke mine?\"    \"Hold Dame La Chance by the foot? It will hold her as fast as a  snapping-turtle does a frog. In proof of it, see what Ricard says, page  970; here is the book.\" Master Pothier opened his tattered volume, and  held it up to the dame. She shook her head.    \"Thanks, I have mislaid my glasses. Do you read, please!\"    \"Most cheerfully, good dame! A notary must have eyes for everybody--eyes  like a cat's, to see in the dark, and power to draw them in like a  turtle, so that he may see nothing that he does not want to see.\"    \"Oh, bless the eyes of the notary!\" Dame Bedard grew impatient. \"Tell me  what the book says about gifts revocable--that is what concerns me and  Zoe.\"    \"Well, here it is, dame: 'Donations stipulated revocable at the pleasure  of the donor are null. But this condition does not apply to donations by  contract of marriage.' Bourdon also says--\"    \"A fig for Bourdon, and all such drones! I want my gift made revocable,  and Dame La Chance's not! I know by long experience with my dear feu  Bedard how necessary it is to hold the reins tight over the men.  Antoine is a good boy, but he will be all the better for a careful  mother-in-law's supervision.\"    Master Pothier rubbed the top of his wig with his forefinger.    \"Are you sure, dame, that Antoine La Chance will wear the bridle  easily?\"    \"Assuredly! I should like to see son-in-law of mine who would not!  Besides, Antoine is in the humor just now to refuse nothing for sake of  Zoe. Have you mentioned the children, Master Pothier? I do not intend to  let Dame La Chance control the children any more than Zoe and Antoine.\"    \"I have made you tutrice perpetuelle, as we say in the court, and here  it is,\" said he, placing the tip of his finger on a certain line in the  document.    Zoe looked down and blushed to her finger-ends. She presently rallied,  and said with some spirit,--\"Never mind them, Master Pothier! Don't put  them in the contract! Let Antoine have something to say about them. He  would take me without a dower, I know, and time enough to remind him  about children when they come.\"    \"Take you without dower! Zoe Bedard! you must be mad!\" exclaimed the  dame, in great heat. \"No girl in New France can marry without a dower,  if it be only a pot and a bedstead! You forget, too, that the dower is  given, not so much for you, as to keep up the credit of the family. As  well be married without a ring! Without a dower, indeed!\"    \"Or without a contract written by a notary, signed, sealed, and  delivered!\" chimed in Master Pothier.    \"Yes, Master Pothier, and I have promised Zoe a three-days wedding,  which will make her the envy of all the parish of Charlebourg. The  seigneur has consented to give her away in place of her poor defunct  father; and when he does that he is sure to stand godfather for all the  children, with a present for every one of them! I shall invite you too,  Master Pothier!\"    Zoe affected not to hear her mother's remark, although she knew it all  by heart, for it had been dinned into her ears twenty times a day for  weeks, and sooth to say, she liked to hear it, and fully appreciated the  honors to come from the patronage of the seigneur.    Master Pothier pricked up his ears till they fairly raised his wig, at  the prospect of a three days wedding at the Crown of France. He began  an elaborate reply, when a horse's tramp broke in upon them and Colonel  Philibert wheeled up to the door of the hostelry.    Master Pothier, seeing an officer in the King's uniform, rose on the  instant and saluted him with a profound bow, while Dame Bedard and Zoe,  standing side by side, dropped their lowest courtesy to the handsome  gentleman, as, with woman's glance, they saw in a moment he was.    Philibert returned their salute courteously, as he halted his horse in  front of Dame Bedard. \"Madame!\" said he, \"I thought I knew all roads  about Charlebourg, but I have either forgotten or they have changed the  road through the forest to Beaumanoir. It is surely altered from what it  was.\"    \"Your Honor is right,\" answered Dame Bedard, \"the Intendant has opened  a new road through the forest.\" Zoe took the opportunity, while the  officer looked at her mother, to examine his features, dress, and  equipments, from head to foot, and thought him the handsomest officer  she had ever seen.    \"I thought it must be so,\" replied Philibert; \"you are the landlady of  the Crown of France, I presume?\" Dame Bedard carried it on her face as  plainly marked as the royal emblem on the sign over her head.    \"Yes, your Honor, I am Widow Bedard, at your service, and, I hope, keep  as good a hostelry as your Honor will find in the Colony. Will your  Honor alight and take a cup of wine, such as I keep for guests of  quality?\"    \"Thanks, Madame Bedard, I am in haste: I must find the way to  Beaumanoir. Can you not furnish me a guide, for I like not to lose time  by missing my way?\"    \"A guide, sir! The men are all in the city on the King's corvee; Zoe  could show you the way easily enough.\" Zoe twitched her mother's  arm nervously, as a hint not to say too much. She felt flattered and  fluttered too, at the thought of"]]]
