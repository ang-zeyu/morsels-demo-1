Dengue fever - mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti) viral disease  associated with urban environments; manifests as sudden onset of  fever and severe headache; occasionally produces shock and  hemorrhage leading to death in 5% of cases.  Yellow fever - mosquito-borne viral disease; severity ranges from  influenza-like symptoms to severe hepatitis and hemorrhagic fever;  occurs only in tropical South America and sub-Saharan Africa, where  most cases are reported; fatality rate is less than 20%.  Japanese Encephalitis - mosquito-borne (Culex tritaeniorhynchus)  viral disease associated with rural areas in Asia; acute  encephalitis can progress to paralysis, coma, and death; fatality  rates 30%.  African Trypanosomiasis - caused by the parasitic protozoa  Trypanosoma; transmitted to humans via the bite of bloodsucking  Tsetse flies; infection leads to malaise and irregular fevers and,  in advanced cases when the parasites invade the central nervous  system, coma and death; endemic in 36 countries of sub-Saharan  Africa; cattle and wild animals act as reservoir hosts for the  parasites.  Cutaneous Leishmaniasis - caused by the parasitic protozoa  leishmania; transmitted to humans via the bite of sandflies; results  in skin lesions that may become chronic; endemic in 88 countries;  90% of cases occur in Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Saudi Arabia,  Brazil, and Peru; wild and domesticated animals as well as humans  can act as reservoirs of infection.  Plague - bacterial disease transmitted by fleas normally associated  with rats; person-to-person airborne transmission also possible;  recent plague epidemics occurred in areas of Asia, Africa, and South  America associated with rural areas or small towns and villages;  manifests as fever, headache, and painfully swollen lymph nodes;  disease progresses rapidly and without antibiotic treatment leads to  pneumonic form with a death rate in excess of 50%.  Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever - tick-borne viral disease;  infection may also result from exposure to infected animal blood or  tissue; geographic distribution includes Africa, Asia, the Middle  East, and Eastern Europe; sudden onset of fever, headache, and  muscle aches followed by hemorrhaging in the bowels, urine, nose,  and gums; mortality rate is approximately 30%.  Rift Valley fever - viral disease affecting domesticated animals and  humans; transmission is by mosquito and other biting insects;  infection may also occur through handling of infected meat or  contact with blood; geographic distribution includes eastern and  southern Africa where cattle and sheep are raised; symptoms are  generally mild with fever and some liver abnormalities, but the  disease may progress to hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, or ocular  disease; fatality rates are low at about 1% of cases.  Chikungunya - mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti) viral disease  associated with urban environments, similar to Dengue Fever;  characterized by sudden onset of fever, rash, and severe joint pain  usually lasting 3-7 days, some cases result in persistent arthritis.  water contact diseases acquired through swimming or wading in  freshwater lakes, streams, and rivers:  Leptospirosis - bacterial disease that affects animals and humans;  infection occurs through contact with water, food, or soil  contaminated by animal urine; symptoms include high fever, severe  headache, vomiting, jaundice, and diarrhea; untreated, the disease  can result in kidney damage, liver failure, meningitis, or  respiratory distress; fatality rates are low but left untreated  recovery can take months.  Schistosomiasis - caused by parasitic trematode flatworm  Schistosoma; fresh water snails act as intermediate host and release  larval form of parasite that penetrates the skin of people exposed  to contaminated water; worms mature and reproduce in the blood  vessels, liver, kidneys, and intestines releasing eggs, which become  trapped in tissues triggering an immune response; may manifest as  either urinary or intestinal disease resulting in decreased work or  learning capacity; mortality, while generally low, may occur in  advanced cases usually due to bladder cancer; endemic in 74  developing countries with 80% of infected people living in  sub-Saharan Africa; humans act as the reservoir for this parasite.  aerosolized dust or soil contact disease acquired through inhalation  of aerosols contaminated with rodent urine:  Lassa fever - viral disease carried by rats of the genus Mastomys;  endemic in portions of West Africa; infection occurs through direct  contact with or consumption of food contaminated by rodent urine or  fecal matter containing virus particles; fatality rate can reach 50%  in epidemic outbreaks.  respiratory disease acquired through close contact with an  infectious person:  Meningococcal meningitis - bacterial disease causing an inflammation  of the lining of the brain and spinal cord; one of the most  important bacterial pathogens is Neisseria meningitidis because of  its potential to cause epidemics; symptoms include stiff neck, high  fever, headaches, and vomiting; bacteria are transmitted from person  to person by respiratory droplets and facilitated by close and  prolonged contact resulting from crowded living conditions, often  with a seasonal distribution; death occurs in 5-15% of cases,  typically within 24-48 hours of onset of symptoms; highest burden of  meningococcal disease occurs in the hyperendemic region of  sub-Saharan Africa known as the \"Meningitis Belt\" which stretches  from Senegal east to Ethiopia.  animal contact disease acquired through direct contact with local  animals:  Rabies - viral disease of mammals usually transmitted through the  bite of an infected animal, most commonly dogs; virus affects the  central nervous system causing brain alteration and death; symptoms  initially are non-specific fever and headache progressing to  neurological symptoms; death occurs within days of the onset of  symptoms.

Legal system      This entry provides the description of a country's legal system; it  also includes information on acceptance of International Court of  Justice (ICJ) jurisdiction. The legal systems of nearly all  countries are generally modeled upon elements of five main types:  civil law (including French law, the Napoleonic Code, Roman law,  Roman-Dutch law, and Spanish law); common law (including United  State law); customary law; mixed or pluralistic law; and religious  law (including Islamic law). An additional type of legal system -  international law, which governs the conduct of independent nations  in their relationships with one another - is also addressed below.  The following list describes these legal systems, the countries or  world regions where these systems are enforced, and a brief  statement on the origins and major features of each.  Civil Law - The most widespread type of legal system in the world,  applied in various forms in approximately 150 countries. Also  referred to as European continental law, the civil law system is  derived mainly from the Roman Corpus Juris Civilus, (Body of Civil  Law), a collection of laws and legal interpretations compiled under  the East Roman (Byzantine) Emperor Justinian I between A.D. 528 and  565. The major feature of civil law systems is that the laws are  organized into systematic written codes. In civil law the sources  recognized as authoritative are principally legislation - especially  codifications in constitutions or statutes enacted by governments -  and secondarily, custom. The civil law systems in some countries are  based on more than one code.  Common Law - A type of legal system, often synonymous with \"English  common law,\" which is the system of England and Wales in the UK, and  is also in force in approximately 80 countries formerly part of or  influenced by the former British Empire. English common law reflects  Biblical influences as well as remnants of law systems imposed by  early conquerors including the Romans, Anglo-Saxons, and Normans.  Some legal scholars attribute the formation of the English common  law system to King Henry II (r.1154-1189). Until the time of his  reign, laws customary among England's various manorial and  ecclesiastical (church) jurisdictions were administered locally.  Henry II established the king's court and designated that laws were  \"common\" to the entire English realm. The foundation of English  common law is \"legal precedent\" - referred to as stare decisis,  meaning \"to stand by things decided.\" In the English common law  system, court judges are bound in their decisions in large part by  the rules and other doctrines developed - and supplemented over time  - by the judges of earlier English courts.  Customary Law - A type of legal system that serves as the basis of,  or has influenced, the present-day laws in approximately 40  countries - mostly in Africa, but some in the Pacific islands,  Europe, and the Near East. Customary law is also referred to as  \"primitive law,\" \"unwritten law,\" \"indigenous law,\" and \"folk law.\"  There is no single history of customary law such as that found in  Roman civil law, English common law, Islamic law, or the Napoleonic  Civil Code. The earliest systems of law in human society were  customary, and usually developed in small agrarian and  hunter-gatherer communities. As the term implies, customary law is  based upon the customs of a community. Common attributes of  customary legal systems are that they are seldom written down, they  embody an organized set of rules regulating social relations, and  they are agreed upon by members of the community.
