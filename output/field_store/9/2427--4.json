This shows that when an animal is very  hungry it is not very particular what it eats.    In the early fall while food of all kinds is easy to find, any animal  is harder to entice to bait and at this season bait should be fresh  if the trapper expects to make profitable catches. The trapper should  always carry a gun, pistol or good revolver with which to help kill  game to supply bait for his traps. Steel traps set along the line  will also help to keep the supply of bait up at all times. If you are  successful in securing a great deal of bait, more than will be used  on that round, you will find it an excellent idea to leave some at  certain places where it can be secured on the next round should it be  needed.    Bait may consist of any tough bit of meat, but rabbit is an excellent  bait. Quail or almost any bird is good. Chicken also makes good bait.  Squirrel is all right. For mink, fish is excellent. Mice, frogs and  muskrat can all be used. Remember that the fresher and bloodier the  bait the better--animals will scent it much quicker. They are also  fonder of fresh bait than that which has been killed for days or  weeks as the case may be.    In baiting it is important to see that the bait is on secure. It is a  good idea to tie it on with strong thread or small cord. The amount  of bait to put on a single trap is not so important. Most trappers  use a rabbit in baiting ten traps or less; the head makes bait for  one trap, each foreleg another, the back about three and each hind  leg one, altho each hind leg can be cut to make bait for two traps.    The spindle or trigger is run thru the bait and should be fastened on  trigger near the end as shown in illustration elsewhere. The securing  of bait on the trigger is an important thing. If it is not on  securely and the trap is hard to get off, the animal may devour bait  and the trap not fall. If the trigger is only sticking loosely in the  bait, it is easy for an animal to steal the bait. Usually the  observing trapper knows these things and are on their guard, but for  those who are using deadfalls this season for the first time, more  explicit explanation is necessary.    The bait should extend back into the pen about a foot and the pen  should be so constructed that the bait touches nowhere only on the  trigger. The animal in eating the bait usually stands with its fore  feet upon the under pole, or just over it. In this condition it can  readily be seen, that if its gnawing at the bait twists the trigger  off the upright prop what the consequences will be--the animal will  be caught across the back. An animal standing in the position just  described will naturally pull down somewhat on the bait and in its  eagerness to get the bait pulls and twists the spindle, or trigger,  off the upright prop.    It is a good idea to try the trigger. That is, place the triggers  under the fall just the same as you would if they were baited and you  were going to set the trap. By doing this you will find out about how  you want to set the triggers so that they will work properly. There  is much in being acquainted with the working of traps. Study them  carefully and you will soon learn to be a successful trapper.        CHAPTER XIV.    TRAPS KNOCKED OFF.    If you find that your traps are \"down\" each time you visit them and  the bait gone, the pen is perhaps too large and the animal, if a  small one like a mink, is going inside to devour bait. Animals  usually stand with fore feet upon lower log and reach into pen after  bait, but at times they have been known to go inside. In this case  the animal is not in danger as when the \"fall\" comes down the animal  is not under it. If such is the case, that is, the animal entirely  inside the pen, the trigger will be caught under the fall and the  trapper knows that whatever is molesting his trap is doing so from  the inside. All that the trapper has to do is lessen the size of the  pen. This can be done by placing small stones or chunks on the inside  of the pen or by driving stakes on the inside. By doing this the  outside appearance is not changed.    If, on the other hand, the trigger, that is the long one or spindle,  not the short prop, is pulled out each time and often carried several  feet, the trap is set too hard to \"fall\" and should be set easier. If  the prop, or upright piece, is cut square across the top, take your  knife and round off the edges so that the trigger will slip off  easier. Again the pen may be torn down and the animal takes bait from  the rear. Here is where it pays to build traps substantial. In such  cases rebuild the pen, making it stronger. Should it be torn down on  subsequent visits, the game is perhaps a fox. Of course if the pen  has been torn down by some trapper or passing hunter, you can readily  detect same by the manner in which it has been done. If the trapper  is satisfied that it is an animal that is doing the mischief, he  wants to plan carefully, and if he is an expert trapper, a steel trap  or two will come into good play and the animal will be caught in the  steel trap. The pen will not be torn down again.    When traps are down note carefully the condition that they are in;  see that the \"fall\" fits on the lower pole closely, and by the way,  when building this is an important thing to notice--that the fall  fits snugly on the lower or under pole.    If a snare or spring pole is up but nothing caught, simply reset.  Should many snares be up \"thrown\" and no catches, the trouble should  be located at once. The noose is probably too large or small or made  of limber or too stiff string or wire, or maybe it is too securely  fastened. When resetting, note all these carefully and experience  will sooner or later enable you to set just right to make a catch. If  a certain snare is bothered continually, it will do no harm to set a  steel trap where you think chances best of taking the animal. It  matters but little to the trapper how the animal is caught, as it is  his pelt that is wanted.    In using the trip triggers with or without bait, the trapper should  fasten the bait by either driving a peg through it and into the  ground or tieing.    In most instances the animal will throw the trap before getting to  the bait, but it is well to take this precaution in case, for any  reason, the animal should not step on the trip trigger at first.    Sometimes a small animal may jump over the trip trigger in order to  get the bait and in its endeavor to get bait will strike the trigger.  The animal does not know that the trigger is dangerous, but now and  then either steps or jumps over. Generally they step on the trigger,  for if the trapper is \"onto his job\" the bait and trigger are so  placed that the animal thinks the trip trigger is the place to put  his foot.    In using without bait the trigger is so arranged that the animal rubs  or steps on the trigger when entering or leaving the pen or if at a  trail or runway when passing along.        CHAPTER XV.    SPRING POLE SNARE.    While the deadfall is good for most animals, there is no one trap  that fills all requirements and in all places. Some animals may be  shy of deadfalls that can be taken in spring poles, snares and steel  traps. This trap is easily and cheaply constructed. It should be made  near dens or where animals travel frequently.    If a small bush is not growing handy, cut one. Drive a stake deeply  in the ground, pull it out, stick the larger end of the bush cut into  it. The explanation of this trap is as follows: 1, bait stick; 2,  trigger; 3, noose made of wire or stout cord; 4, stay wire made of  wire or cord; 5, bait; 6, spring pole.    By noting carefully the illustration this trap can be built easily.  The size of the bush or spring pole, of course, depends upon what  sized animals you are trapping. This trap will take small game such  as mink, opossum, skunk, etc., or can be made large and strong enough  to catch mountain lion or black bear.      * * *      [Illustration: SPRING POLE AND SNARE.]    The snare is made by building a round fence in a place where there is  plenty of small trees. Select two about four inches apart for noose  and snare entrance, and another long springy one for spring pole 6 or  7 feet long, bend this down and trim it. Have a noose made of limber  wire or strong string and a cross piece. Having cut notches in the  sides of the trees for the same to fit, have it to spring easy. For  snaring rabbits have the fence quite high.      [Illustration: SMALL GAME SNARE.]    Observe the above description and you can readily make.  No. 1 is the  noose, No. 2 is spring pole, No. 3 fence, No. 4 bait. This snare  already explained can be made any time in the year while the dead  fall can only be constructed when the ground isn't frozen.      * * *    The snares can be either made of twine or wire. Many fox and lynx  snare trappers in the North use small brass wire.      [Illustration: WIRE AND TWINE SNARE.]    Snares work well in cold weather and if properly constructed are  pretty sure catchers.    A--Spring pole.    B--Staple.    C--Two small nails driven in tree. (Three inch nail head, end down,  with snare looped at each end with a foot of slack between. As soon  as the D--three inch nail is pulled down, it will slip past the nail  at top end, when spring pole will instantly take up the slack, also  the fox, to staple and does its work.)    E--Slack line or wire.    F--Loop should be 7 inches in diameter and bottom of loop ten inches  from the ground.    Remarks--The nails should be driven above staple so it will pull  straight down to release the snare fastening.      [Illustration: SNARE LOOP.]    A great many foxes have been caught in this country by the plan of  the drawing outlined, writes J. C. Hunter,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34131"],[0,"Butterflies and Moths (British) (#10)"],[1,"unwary grub from its resting place.    The precautions of the caterpillar, however, do not end merely with the  selection of an under surface. You will find that the bright green  species invariably settle on a leaf or a _green_ stalk, while the darkly  coloured insects often choose a twig covered with a brownish bark. Some  even make for the _trunk_ of the tree on which they feed, and here  remain quite still in a vertical position, so that they look just like a  ridge in the bark, the colour of which is faithfully imitated by their  skin. Further, many of the caterpillars that resort to this stratagem  have bodies that are notched or knotted and spotted in such a manner  that the resemblance to their surroundings is so perfect as to defy any  but the most experienced eye. And even this is not all, for a number of  these mimics of the insect world never venture to feed by day, but take  in their quantum of provisions during the dark hours, and practise their  deceptions throughout the day.    Most of the Geometer caterpillars, of which we have already spoken, are  well trained in the art of deception. You are out on a caterpillar hunt,  and engaged in carefully turning over the twigs of the hazel or some  other shrub, so that you may the more readily examine the under surfaces  of the leaves. At last you lay hold of a small broken twig for this very  purpose. To your astonishment it is very soft, and readily bends between  your fingers. You look more closely at this peculiar piece of stick, and  find, to your surprise, that you have grasped a looper caterpillar that  was standing out at an angle just like a broken twig, supported by its  two pairs of claspers, and coloured and knotted exactly like the little  branch on which it rested.    At other times you meet with little green caterpillars of the same  group, supporting themselves in exactly the same manner on a small twig,  and looking just like a leaf stalk from which the blade had fallen or  been devoured.    What a wonderful power is exhibited in the grasp of the claspers and the  tension of the muscles, enabling the caterpillar to fix itself and  retain its position for so long a time! Imagine an acrobat fixing  himself by his hands on an upright pole, throwing out his body at an  angle, and without any further support retaining his position motionless  for several hours!    Other experiences of the larva hunter are equally interesting and,  perhaps, even more tantalising. He is engaged in very cautiously turning  over the leaves of a certain food plant from which he hopes to obtain  the larva of a much-coveted species. Then, just as his eye catches a  glimpse of the very object of his search, down falls the caterpillar,  rolled up into a little ball, among the herbage below. This latter is  diligently and patiently examined. But no, the anticipated prize is  nowhere to be seen. It is probably a green one, and this adds to the  difficulty of the patient entomologist. Then, as he carefully separates  the low herbs, hoping to find the spot where the larva had fallen, the  insect, rolled up into a compact little ball, only sinks deeper and  deeper into the maze.    Many caterpillars avoid capture in this manner, while others seek to  avoid detection by remaining perfectly motionless, even when roughly  handled. They allow themselves to drop from their resting place on the  slightest sign of danger, and, when the alarm is over and all is quiet  again, they ascend the food plant and resume their position.    Some caterpillars not only rest, but even feed under cover, quite secure  from most, if not all, of their enemies. Several of them feed on roots,  and many a farmer can relate sad experiences of the havoc committed by  these caterpillars on his turnips and other crops. Then there are those  which feed on flowers and buds, completely burying themselves in the  dense mass of food.    [Illustration: FIG. 27.--THE HOMES OF LEAF MINERS AND LEAF ROLLERS.]    We must conclude this brief account of resting and hiding places and  attitudes of caterpillars by a few observations on the leaf miners and  leaf rollers.    The former are very small caterpillars--the larvae of certain small  moths--that eat burrows into leaves without doing any considerable  injury to the outer _epidermis_, and thus prepare a safe resting place  within the substance of their food.    The latter, also mostly of small size, make themselves secure by curling  a leaf or a portion of a leaf into a cylinder, and holding it in  position by means of a number of silken threads.    If you examine a leaf thus curled you will soon be convinced that a  considerable number of the extremely delicate threads must be necessary  to hold it in position; but, if you would like to know how a very small  and feeble caterpillar can manage to roll up a comparatively large and  rigid leaf, you must watch the little creature at its work.    You need have but little difficulty in finding a willing worker, for  such caterpillars are extremely numerous. Take a few out of their  self-made homes, place them on a sprig of the food plant, and you will  soon have the pleasure of seeing one start its extraordinary work.    At first it spins a number of threads stretching from the edge of a leaf  to about the middle of the surface. These threads are not tight by any  means, and the leaf is, as yet, unchanged in position. But now the  little mechanic exhibits a tact that almost seems to prove a knowledge  of the principles of its art. Each thread in turn is pulled _at right  angles_ at its middle, and then fastened by means of the creature's  spinneret. Each time this is done the edge of the leaf is bent round _a  little_; and when at last the cylinder is completed, a number of other  threads are stretched across from the scroll to the flat part of the  leaf to secure it firmly in its place.    Many caterpillars are solitary in their habits: that is, they are always  found singly, whether walking, resting, or feeding. But a large number  of species are gregarious, living in dense clusters either throughout  their larval state or, perhaps, only while young. In many such cases it  is difficult or even impossible to find any reason for this gregarious  tendency--to discover any advantage that the insects may derive from the  habit. Many species, however, are true co-operators in the defence of  their communities. The caterpillars of such live in clusters, sometimes  several scores in each, and all help in the spinning of a complicated  mass of silk fibres, which, with the leaves and twigs they join  together, form a safe home in which they can rest, feed, or change to  the chrysalis state. In early summer hundreds of such caterpillar  'nests' are to be seen in many of our hawthorn and other hedgerows.    Before closing our general account of the caterpillar we must have a  word to say about the breathing apparatus, more especially as in our  future descriptions we shall frequently have to mention the colours and  markings which surround the openings in its body through which the air  supply is admitted.    If you examine the sides of the segments of a caterpillar, using a lens  if the insect is a small one, you will observe some little round holes,  often inclosed in a ring or a patch of some prominent colour. These are  the _spiracles_ or openings of a series of air tubes called _tracheae_.  These latter divide and subdivide within the body of the caterpillar,  the branches of one often uniting with those of another, thus forming a  really complicated arrangement of air pipes by which the supply of  oxygen is distributed.    A microscopic examination of a portion of one of the tracheae will show  that its walls are supported by an elastic spiral of a firm substance.  This arrangement serves to keep the air passages open, and secures for  the caterpillar a free supply of air at times when a contraction of the  segments would otherwise cause the tubes to collapse.    There are nine spiracles on each side of the caterpillar's body, and  never more than one in the side of the same segment. The head, which we  have been regarding as the first segment, has no spiracles. The second  segment has a pair--one on each side. There are none in the third and  fourth; but all the segments, from the fifth to the twelfth inclusive,  have each a pair; the last (thirteenth) segment has none.    We have already observed the general arrangement of the caterpillar's  limbs; but perhaps it may be interesting and even convenient to the  reader to give here a little table that will show at a glance the  disposition of both limbs and spiracles.      First segment--head        Two short antennae, two jaws,                                 and twelve eyes.    Second      \"              Legs and spiracles.    Third       \"              Legs only.    Fourth      \"              Legs only.    Fifth       \"              Spiracles only.    Sixth       \"              Spiracles only.    Seventh     \"              Spiracles, and sometimes                                 claspers.    Eighth      \"              Spiracles, and sometimes                                 claspers.    Ninth       \"              Spiracles, and sometimes                                 claspers.    Tenth       \"              Spiracles, and generally                                 claspers.    Eleventh    \"              Spiracles only.    Twelfth     \"              Spiracles only.    Thirteenth  \"              Claspers only, and these                                 occasionally absent.    We must now watch the caterpillar through its later days, to see how it  prepares for passing into the pupal stage, and to witness the various  interesting changes that take place at this period.    When fully grown, it ceases to eat, and begins to wander about in search  of a convenient spot for the coming event. Its colours fade, and the  body becomes appreciably smaller, especially in length, "]]]
