At every station  where logperch were found, _Notropis umbratilis_ was taken and  _Pimephales notatus_ also occurred at all but three of these stations.      #Percina copelandi# (Jordan): Stations C-4, C-5, C-6, C-8, G-1 (C-131,  C-133, J&J).    Channel darters were collected over bottoms of rubble or gravel, both in  flowing streams and in isolated pools. Although _P. copelandi_ was found  only in Big Caney River and at the lowermost station on Grouse Creek  (G-1) in this survey, this species has been taken previously from Elk  River (K. U. 3463 and K. U. 3197) and from Silver Creek. _Notropis  camurus_ occurred everywhere that _H. copelandi_ was found. In several  instances the two species were taken in the same seine-haul.      #Etheostoma spectabile pulchellum# (Girard): Stations W-4, G-1, G-4,  G-5, C-6, C-9, C-11, C-12, C-13, C-14, C-15, C-16, C-17, C-18, E-1, E-5.  Evermann and Fordice as _Etheostoma coeruleum_ (C-131, C-132).    The habitat preferences of the orangethroat darter seemed similar to  those of _Campostoma anomalum_. There were sixteen stations at which  both species were taken, seven where only _E. spectabile pulchellum_ was  taken and six where only _C. anomalum_ was taken. The largest relative  numbers of both species were found in the same small, clear upland  tributaries of Big Caney River. On May 31, collections from riffles at  station C-15 (upper Otter Creek) consisted almost entirely of these two  species. On September 1 at this station the stream was intermittent, but  even the tiniest pools abounded with young darters and stonerollers.    Gravid females and males in breeding condition were taken in riffles in  Cedar Creek on April 2. During June numerous young and adult  orangethroat darters were taken in Cedar Creek, in partly decayed leaves  which lined the banks. On June 15 in Otter Creek young darters were  abundant in streamside detritus and in clear, shallow, rubble riffles.  At station C-11 a few darters were taken on rubble riffles; however,  large numbers were found inhabiting thick mats of _Potamogeton foliosus_  Raf., which grew in shallow water. Many darters (_Etheostoma spectabile  pulchellum_ and _Percina phoxocephala_) were taken in September along  gravelly banks at stations C-2 and C-3 by disturbing small rocks and  leaf-litter along the shores. Young orangethroat darters seemed to  seek out sheltered areas and in some cases were found in sluggish, even  foul, water (Stations W-4, B-1 and G-12). Moore and Buck (1953:26) note  that the orangethroat darter is able to thrive in Oklahoma in rather  sluggish and even intermittent waters which reach quite high summer  temperatures.    Unlike other darters taken in this survey, the orangethroat darter was  common to abundant at several stations and was found at a great many  more stations than any other darter. The comparatively great tolerance  of this species to varying habitats, suggested by this survey, is also  reflected by its widespread distribution in Kansas.      #Micropterus salmoides salmoides# (Lacepede): Stations B-1, G-4, G-5,  G-7, G-12, C-1, C-3, E-1, E-2, E-3.    Most of the largemouth bass taken were young-of-the-year. In Big Caney  River this species seemed rare, being found at only two downstream  stations compared with eight stations at which _M. punctulatus_ was  taken.    Many ponds in the Flint Hills have been stocked with largemouth bass. At  present largemouth bass are frequently caught by hook and line in Crab  Creek (Station G-12); however, Mr. A. C. Metcalf, who has fished this  stream for approximately 45 years, states that he took no bass in the  creek prior to the building and stocking of large ponds on nearby  ranches.      #Micropterus punctulatus# (Rafinesque): Stations C-4, C-5, C-6, C-7,  C-8, C-10, C-14, C-15, E-2, E-5 (C-133).    The spotted bass was taken only in tributaries of the Verdigris River,  where it seemed more numerous than the preceding species. It has been  reported from other Verdigris tributaries such as Fall River (Elliott,  1947) and is common eastward from the Verdigris Basin. A spotted bass  (K. U. 3467) was taken by Cross on the Little Walnut River in Butler  County on April 5, 1955. This seems to be the only record of this  species from the Walnut River Basin at the present time.      #Pomoxis annularis# (Rafinesque): Stations W-3, W-5, G-1, G-2, G-5,  G-10, G-11, G-12, C-1, C-2, C-4, C-5, C-6, M-1, E-1, E-2, E-4, E-5  (C-136).    White crappie were found in almost all habitats and were taken in all  rivers except the Arkansas. The relative abundance of this species was  greater at downstream than at upstream stations on Grouse Creek, Big  Caney, and Elk River. Schools of young crappie were frequently found and  the factor of chance in taking or failing to take a school of crappie  prevented confident appraisal of abundance. White crappie usually sought  quiet waters. Often they were found in backwaters and many times  schools were taken over bottoms where mud and detritus had been  deposited. It was not uncommon to take _Pomoxis annularis_ and  _Ictalurus melas_ in the same seine-haul in such areas.      #Pomoxis nigromaculatus# (LeSueur): Station C-1.    Black crappie were taken in Otter Creek on May 29 and September 3.  Several ponds in eastern Cowley County are stocked with black crappie,  but none was taken from streams into which these ponds drain.      #Lepomis cyanellus# (Rafinesque): Stations W-3, W-4, W-5, B-1, B-2, B-3,  G-1, G-2, G-3, G-4, G-5, G-8, G-9, G-10, G-12, G-13, G-14, G-15, G-16,  G-17, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5, C-6, C-7, C-8, C-9, C-10, C-11, C-12,  C-13, C-14, C-16, C-17, C-18, E-1, E-4, E-5, E-6, E-7, M-2 (C-131,  C-132, C-133, C-136, E&F).    The green sunfish was taken at 45 of 60 stations, which is the greatest  number recorded for one species. The only stream from which it was not  obtained was the Arkansas River. Green sunfish constituted a minor but  consistent part of the fauna in Big Caney River except for some  intermittent pools on small tributaries, where it was high in relative  abundance. It usually comprised approximately 4 per cent of the fish  taken at stations on Grouse Creek. In some intermittent tributaries of  Grouse Creek and Elk River percentages also were high.    Funk and Campbell (1953:74) observed that _L. cyanellus_ held a definite  but minor place in all collections made on the Black River in Missouri.  This pattern was also observed by the writer in collections made on the  Neosho and Spring Rivers in southeastern Kansas. This seems to indicate  that the Big Caney River populations (exclusive of the upstream stations  in intermittent streams) follow a pattern commonly found in southeastern  Kansas and probably in the Ozark region.      #Lepomis humilis# (Girard): Stations A-3, W-2, W-3, W-4, W-5, G-1, G-2,  G-3, G-4, G-5, G-7, G-8, G-9, G-10, G-11, G-12, G-14, G-15, C-1, C-2,  C-3, C-4, C-5, C-6, C-7, C-8, C-9, C-10, C-11, C-12, C-13, C-16, C-17,  B-2, B-3, E-1, E-2, E-4, E-5, E-6, E-7, M-1. (C-131, C-132, C-133,  C-136, J&J, E&F.)    The orangespotted sunfish was found in every stream surveyed, although  only one specimen was taken from the Arkansas River.    The largest relative number of this species (44.6) was taken at station  G-1. Percentages at other stations on Grouse Creek and its tributaries  progressively declined in an upstream direction.    In Big Caney River representation of _L. humilis_ in collections varied  from 1.56 per cent at station C-1 to 23.47 per cent at station  C-7. This sunfish was usually the dominant species in collections made  from the Elk River, where the relative abundance ranged from 10 to 30  per cent.    The orangespotted sunfish is widespread in Kansas and seems to be a  diagnostic constituent of the Plains Fauna. Moore and Buck (1953:26)  found it \"very common\" in the Chikaskia River in Kansas and Oklahoma.  Cross (1950:140) noted that in Stillwater Creek it seemed to be the most  tolerant and consequently the most abundant of the stream's cent  rarchids. Moore and Paden (1950:91) note that _L. humilis_ is most  common in muddy waters and found in overflow pools, backwaters, and  oxbow lakes. This species is frequently found in farm ponds in the area  surveyed, which further suggests a wide range of habitat tolerance.      #Lepomis megalotis breviceps# (Baird and Girard): Stations W-3, W-4,  W-5, B-1, B-2, G-1, G-4, G-5, G-7, G-8, G-9, G-10, G-11, G-12, G-13 (all  Big Caney River stations except C-18), E-1, E-2, E-3, E-4, E-5, E-6,  M-1, M-2 (C-131, C-132, C-133, J&J, E&F).    In Big Caney River the longear sunfish shared dominance with the redfin  shiner (_Notropis umbratilis_) at almost every station. The average of  its relative abundance at all stations in the Big Caney system was 16.5  per cent. It was also abundant at several stations on Grouse Creek and  made up 43.25 per cent of all fish taken at station G-4.    Cross (1950:140) observed that _L. megalotis breviceps_ increased in  Stillwater Creek probably as a result of clearer water and stabilized  water level.    In collections made west of the area treated here (Moore and Buck,  1953:26; Elliott, 1947) the longear sunfish is less abundant than in Big  Caney River and Grouse Creek.      #Lepomis macrochirus# (Rafinesque): Stations W-3, G-3, G-4, G-5, C-3,  C-5, E-1, E-2 (C-131, C-132, C-133).    The bluegill was, in all cases, a minor constituent in the fish fauna.  No clear pattern of habitat preference can be deduced. In the Verdigris  River at Independence (collection AM-53, August 22, 1956) bluegills were  common in quiet pools and coves below a low-water dam. Moore and Paden  (1950:91) note that _L. macrochirus_ prefers quiet waters and Hubbs and  Lagler (1947:94) state that it is \"generally restricted to the quieter  pools.\"    The bluegill is widely-stocked in impoundments of the area treated  here.      #Aplodinotus grunniens# (Rafinesque): Stations C-4, E-2.

She was white; her  fingers were clenched; her eyes blazed.    Dale appeared startled out of his gravity, and surprised, then pleased.  A smile made his face like a boy's. Helen felt her body all rigid, yet  slightly trembling. Her hands were cold. The horror of this revelation  held her speechless. But in her heart she echoed Bo's exclamation of  admiration and gratitude.    \"So far, then,\" resumed Dale, with a heavy breath of relief. \"No wonder  you're upset. I've a blunt way of talkin'.... Now we've thirty miles to  ride on this Snowdrop road before we can turn off. To-day sometime the  rest of the boys--Roy, John, an' Hal--were to leave Show Down, which's  a town farther on from Snowdrop. They have my horses an' packs besides  their own. Somewhere on the road we'll meet them--to-night, maybe--or  tomorrow. I hope not to-night, because that 'd mean Anson's gang was  ridin' in to Magdalena.\"    Helen wrung her hands helplessly.    \"Oh, have I no courage?\" she whispered.    \"Nell, I'm as scared as you are,\" said Bo, consolingly, embracing her  sister.    \"I reckon that's natural,\" said Dale, as if excusing them. \"But, scared  or not, you both brace up. It's a bad job. But I've done my best. An'  you'll be safer with me an' the Beeman boys than you'd be in Magdalena,  or anywhere else, except your uncle's.\"    \"Mr.--Mr. Dale,\" faltered Helen, with her tears falling, \"don't think me  a coward--or--or ungrateful. I'm neither. It's only I'm so--so shocked.  After all we hoped and expected--this--this--is such a--a terrible  surprise.\"    \"Never mind, Nell dear. Let's take what comes,\" murmured Bo.    \"That's the talk,\" said Dale. \"You see, I've come right out with the  worst. Maybe we'll get through easy. When we meet the boys we'll take to  the horses an' the trails. Can you ride?\"    \"Bo has been used to horses all her life and I ride fairly well,\"  responded Helen. The idea of riding quickened her spirit.    \"Good! We may have some hard ridin' before I get you up to Pine. Hello!  What's that?\"    Above the creaking, rattling, rolling roar of the stage Helen heard a  rapid beat of hoofs. A horse flashed by, galloping hard.    Dale opened the door and peered out. The stage rolled to a halt. He  stepped down and gazed ahead.    \"Joe, who was that?\" he queried.    \"Nary me. An' Bill didn't know him, either,\" replied Joe. \"I seen him  'way back. He was ridin' some. An' he slowed up goin' past us. Now he's  runnin' again.\"    Dale shook his head as if he did not like the circumstances.    \"Milt, he'll never get by Roy on this road,\" said Joe.    \"Maybe he'll get by before Roy strikes in on the road.\"    \"It ain't likely.\"    Helen could not restrain her fears. \"Mr. Dale, you think he was a  messenger--going ahead to post that--that Anson gang?\"    \"He might be,\" replied Dale, simply.    Then the young man called Joe leaned out from the seat above and called:  \"Miss Helen, don't you worry. Thet fellar is more liable to stop lead  than anythin' else.\"    His words, meant to be kind and reassuring, were almost as sinister to  Helen as the menace to her own life. Long had she known how cheap life  was held in the West, but she had only known it abstractly, and she had  never let the fact remain before her consciousness. This cheerful young  man spoke calmly of spilling blood in her behalf. The thought it roused  was tragic--for bloodshed was insupportable to her--and then the thrills  which followed were so new, strange, bold, and tingling that they were  revolting. Helen grew conscious of unplumbed depths, of instincts at  which she was amazed and ashamed.    \"Joe, hand down that basket of grub--the small one with the canteen,\"  said Dale, reaching out a long arm. Presently he placed a cloth-covered  basket inside the stage. \"Girls, eat all you want an' then some.\"    \"We have a basket half full yet,\" replied Helen.    \"You'll need it all before we get to Pine.... Now, I'll ride up on top  with the boys an' eat my supper. It'll be dark, presently, an' we'll  stop often to listen. But don't be scared.\"    With that he took his rifle and, closing the door, clambered up to the  driver's seat. Then the stage lurched again and began to roll along.    Not the least thing to wonder at of this eventful evening was the way Bo  reached for the basket of food. Helen simply stared at her.    \"Bo, you CAN'T EAT!\" she exclaimed.    \"I should smile I can,\" replied that practical young lady. \"And you're  going to if I have to stuff things in your mouth. Where's your wits,  Nell? He said we must eat. That means our strength is going to have some  pretty severe trials.... Gee! it's all great--just like a story! The  unexpected--why, he looks like a prince turned hunter!--long, dark,  stage journey--held up--fight--escape--wild ride on horses--woods  and camps and wild places--pursued--hidden in the forest--more hard  rides--then safe at the ranch. And of course he falls madly in love with  me--no, you, for I'll be true to my Las Vegas lover--\"    \"Hush, silly! Bo, tell me, aren't you SCARED?\"    \"Scared! I'm scared stiff. But if Western girls stand such things, we  can. No Western girl is going to beat ME!\"    That brought Helen to a realization of the brave place she had given  herself in dreams, and she was at once ashamed of herself and wildly  proud of this little sister.    \"Bo, thank Heaven I brought you with me!\" exclaimed Helen, fervently.  \"I'll eat if it chokes me.\"    Whereupon she found herself actually hungry, and while she ate she  glanced out of the stage, first from one side and then from the other.  These windows had no glass and they let the cool night air blow in.  The sun had long since sunk. Out to the west, where a bold, black  horizon-line swept away endlessly, the sky was clear gold, shading  to yellow and blue above. Stars were out, pale and wan, but growing  brighter. The earth appeared bare and heaving, like a calm sea. The wind  bore a fragrance new to Helen, acridly sweet and clean, and it was so  cold it made her fingers numb.    \"I heard some animal yelp,\" said Bo, suddenly, and she listened with  head poised.    But Helen heard nothing save the steady clip-clop of hoofs, the clink of  chains, the creak and rattle of the old stage, and occasionally the low  voices of the men above.    When the girls had satisfied hunger and thirst, night had settled down  black. They pulled the cloaks up over them, and close together leaned  back in a corner of the seat and talked in whispers. Helen did not have  much to say, but Bo was talkative.    \"This beats me!\" she said once, after an interval. \"Where are we, Nell?  Those men up there are Mormons. Maybe they are abducting us!\"    \"Mr. Dale isn't a Mormon,\" replied Helen.    \"How do you know?\"    \"I could tell by the way he spoke of his friends.\"    \"Well, I wish it wasn't so dark. I'm not afraid of men in daylight....  Nell, did you ever see such a wonderful looking fellow? What'd they call  him? Milt--Milt Dale. He said he lived in the woods. If I hadn't fallen  in love with that cowboy who called me--well, I'd be a goner now.\"    After an interval of silence Bo whispered, startlingly, \"Wonder if Harve  Riggs is following us now?\"    \"Of course he is,\" replied Helen, hopelessly.    \"He'd better look out. Why, Nell, he never saw--he never--what did Uncle  Al used to call it?--sav--savvied--that's it. Riggs never savvied that  hunter. But I did, you bet.\"    \"Savvied! What do you mean, Bo?\"    \"I mean that long-haired galoot never saw his real danger. But I felt  it. Something went light inside me. Dale never took him seriously at  all.\"    \"Riggs will turn up at Uncle Al's, sure as I'm born,\" said Helen.    \"Let him turn,\" replied Bo, contemptuously. \"Nell, don't you ever bother  your head again about him. I'll bet they're all men out here. And I  wouldn't be in Harve Riggs's boots for a lot.\"    After that Bo talked of her uncle and his fatal illness, and from that  she drifted back to the loved ones at home, now seemingly at the other  side of the world, and then she broke down and cried, after which she  fell asleep on Helen's shoulder.    But Helen could not have fallen asleep if she had wanted to.    She had always, since she could remember, longed for a moving, active  life; and for want of a better idea she had chosen to dream of gipsies.  And now it struck her grimly that, if these first few hours of her  advent in the West were forecasts of the future, she was destined to  have her longings more than fulfilled.    Presently the stage rolled slower and slower, until it came to a halt.  Then the horses heaved, the harnesses clinked, the men whispered.  Otherwise there was an intense quiet. She looked out, expecting to  find it pitch-dark. It was black, yet a transparent blackness. To her  surprise she could see a long way. A shooting-star electrified her.  The men were listening. She listened, too, but beyond the slight sounds  about the stage she heard nothing. Presently the driver clucked to his  horses, and travel was resumed.    For a while the stage rolled on rapidly, evidently downhill, swaying  from side to side, and rattling as if about to fall to pieces. Then it  slowed on a level, and again it halted for a few moments, and once more  in motion it began a laborsome climb. Helen imagined miles had been  covered. The desert appeared to heave into billows, growing rougher, and  dark, round bushes dimly stood out. The road grew uneven and rocky, and  when the stage began another descent its violent rocking jolted Bo out  of her sleep and in fact almost out of Helen's arms.    \"Where am I?\" asked Bo, dazedly.    \"Bo, you're having your heart's desire, but I can't tell you where you  are,\" replied Helen.    Bo awakened thoroughly, which fact was now no wonder, considering the  jostling of the old stage.    \"Hold on to me, Nell!... Is it a runaway?\"    \"We've come about a thousand miles like this,"]]]
