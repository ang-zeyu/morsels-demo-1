Thou knowest what to say: '_As usual_.'\"    Garabato protested. He must help the _maestro_ undress. The servants of  the hotel would take charge of sending the despatch.    \"No, I wish it to be thou. I will wait. Thou must send another telegram.  Thou already knowest who to--to that lady; to Dona Sol. Also '_As  usual_.'\"          CHAPTER III    BORN FOR THE BULL-RING      When Senora Angustias was bereft of her husband, Senor Juan Gallardo,  the well known cobbler established in a _portal_ in the ward of the  Feria, she wept with the disconsolateness due the event, but at the same  time, in the depths of her soul, she felt the satisfaction of one who  rests after a long journey, freed from an overwhelming burden.    \"Poor fellow, joy of my heart! May God keep him in His glory. So good!  So industrious!\"    During twenty years of life together, he had not caused her greater  sorrows than those the rest of the women of the ward had to bear. Of the  three _pesetas_ he averaged as a result of his labor he handed over one  to Senora Angustias for the support of the house and family, using the  other two for personal entertainment and for keeping up appearances  among his friends. He was obliged to respond to the attentions of his  companions when they invited him to a convivial glass, and the famous  Andalusian wine, since it is the glory of God, costs dear. Also it was  inevitable that he should go to see the bulls, because a man who does  not drink nor attend bull-fights--why is he in the world?    Senora Angustias with her two children, Encarnacion and little Juan, had  to sharpen her wits and develop numerous talents in order to keep the  family together. She worked as a servant in the houses nearest her  ward, sewed for the women of the neighborhood, sold clothing and  trinkets for a certain brokeress, a friend of hers, and made cigarettes  for the gentlemen, recalling her youthful aptitude when Senor Juan, an  enthusiastic and favored lover, used to come and wait for her at the  door of the Tobacco Factory.    Never could she complain of infidelity or ill-treatment on the part of  her husband. On Saturdays when the cobbler used to come home drunk in  the late hours of the night supported by his friends, joy and tenderness  came with him. Senora Angustias had to drag him into the house, for he  was determined to remain outside the door clapping his hands and  intoning, with slobbery voice, tender love songs dedicated to his  corpulent companion. And when the door was at last closed behind him,  depriving the neighbors of a source of entertainment, Senor Juan, in a  state of sentimental drunkenness, insisted on seeing the sleeping  children; he kissed them, wetting their little faces with great  tear-drops, and repeated his verses in honor of Senora Angustias  (Hurrah! the greatest woman in the world!) till finally the good wife  was compelled to cease frowning and to laugh while she undressed him and  managed him as if he were a sick child.    This was his only vice. Poor fellow! There was not a sign of women or of  gambling. His self-esteem which made him go well dressed while the  family went in rags, and his unequal division of the products of his  labor, were both compensated by generous incentives. Senora Angustias  recollected with pride the great feast days when Juan had her put on her  Manila shawl, her wedding _mantilla_, and, with the children walking in  advance, he strode at her side with white Cordovan hat and silver  handled cane, taking a walk along Delicias with the same air as any  shopkeeper's family from Sierpes Street. On cheap bull-fight days he  courted her pompously before going to the plaza, offering her glasses of  wine at La Campana or at a _cafe_ in the New Plaza. This happy time was  now but a faint and pleasant memory in the recollection of the poor  woman.    Senor Juan fell ill of phthisis and for two years the wife had to care  for him, making still greater exertions in her industries to compensate  for the lack of the _peseta_ her husband used to turn over to her. At  last he died in the hospital, resigned to his fate, convinced that  existence was of no value without Andalusian wine and without bulls, and  his last look of love and gratitude was for his wife, as if he would  call out with his eyes: \"Hurrah! the greatest woman in the world!\"    When Senora Angustias was left alone her position did not change for the  worse,--rather for the better. She enjoyed greater liberty in her  movements, freed from the man who for the last two years had weighed  more heavily upon her than the rest of the family. Being an energetic  woman and of prompt decision, she immediately marked out a career for  her children. Encarnacion, who was now sixteen, went to the Tobacco  Factory, where her mother was able to introduce her, thanks to her  relations with certain friends of her youth who had become overseers.  Juanillo, who as a lad had passed his days in the _portal_ of the Feria  watching his father work, should be a shoemaker, according to the will  of Senora Angustias. She took him out of school, where he had learned  to read but poorly, and at twelve he became an apprentice to one of the  best shoemakers in Seville.    And now the martyrdom of the poor woman began.    Ah, that boy! Son of such honorable parents! Almost every day, instead  of going to his master's shop he went to the slaughter-house with  certain rascals who had their meeting place on a bench in the Alameda of  Hercules and who delighted to flaunt a cape under the nose of young  bullocks for the entertainment of herders and butchers, generally  getting upset and trampled upon. Senora Angustias, who often toiled far  into the night, needle in hand, so that the boy might go to the shop  neat, with his clothing clean and mended, met him at the door when he  came home with his pantaloons torn, his jacket dirty, and his face  covered with lumps and scratches, afraid to enter yet without courage to  flee owing to his hunger.    The welts made by his mother's blows and the marks of the broom-handle  were added to the bruises of the treacherous bullocks, but the hero of  the slaughter-house suffered them all, provided he did not lack his  daily rations. \"Beat me, but give me something to eat.\" And with his  appetite awakened by violent exercise, he devoured the hard bread, the  spoiled beans, the stale cod-fish, all the cheap food the diligent woman  sought in the shops in the effort to maintain the family on her scanty  earnings.    Toiling all day scrubbing floors, only now and then did she have an  afternoon in which she could concern herself with her son's welfare and  go to the cobbler's to learn of the progress of the apprentice. When she  returned from the shoe-maker's shop she was puffing and blowing with  anger and resolved upon terrible punishments to correct the vagabond.    Most of the time he failed to present himself at the shop at all. He  spent the morning at the slaughter-house and in the afternoons he formed  one of the group of vagabonds collected at the entrance of Sierpes  Street, admiring at close range the bull-fighters out of work who  gathered in Campana Street, dressed in new clothes, with resplendent  hats but with no more than a _peseta_ in their pockets, though each one  was bragging of his exploits.    Little Juan contemplated them as if they were beings of marvellous  superiority, envying their fine carriage and the boldness with which  they flattered the women. The idea that each of these had at home a suit  of silk embroidered with gold, and that with it on he strode before the  multitude to the sound of music, produced a thrill of respect.    The son of Senora Angustias was known as the Little Cobbler among his  ragged friends, and he showed satisfaction at having a nickname, as have  nearly all the great men who appear in the ring. A foundation must be  laid somewhere. He wore around his neck a red handkerchief which he had  pilfered from his sister, and from beneath his cap his hair fell over  his ears in thick locks which he carefully plastered down. He wore his  plaited blouses of drill tucked into his trousers, which were ancient  relics of his father's wardrobe made over by Senora Angustias; he  insisted these must be high in the waist with the legs wide and the hips  well tightened, and wept with humiliation when his mother would not  yield to these exactions.    A cape! If only he might possess a fighting cape and not have to beg  from other more fortunate boys the loan of the coveted \"rag\" for a few  minutes! In a poor little room at home lay an old forgotten empty  mattress case. Senora Angustias had sold the wool in days of stress. The  Little Cobbler spent a morning locked in the room, taking advantage of  the absence of his mother who was working as a servant in a priest's  house.    With the ingenuity of a shipwrecked mariner on a desert isle who, thrown  upon his own resources, must construct everything necessary to his  existence, he cut a fighting cape from the damp and half-frayed cloth.  Then he boiled in a pot a handful of red aniline bought at a druggist's,  and dipped the ancient cotton in this dye. Little Juan admired his  work--a cape of the most vivid scarlet that would arouse the greatest  envy at the bull-baiting in the surrounding towns! Nothing remained but  to dry it and he hung it in the sun beside the neighbor women's white  clothes. The wind blew the dripping cloth about, bespattering the  nearest pieces, until a chorus of curses and threats, clenched fists,  and mouths that pronounced the ugliest of words against him and his  mother, obliged the Little Cobbler to grasp his mantle of glory and take  to his heels, his hands and face dyed red as though he had just  committed a murder.

BREEDING.--As before stated the mating season comes late in February and  in March and the young animals make their appearance in May. The period  of gestation being about nine weeks.    One male animal will easily serve eight or ten females and he should be  left in their company a number of days. After that he should be removed  and to make certain, another male should be installed for a few days.  Two males should never be allowed with the females at one time or they  will fight and one or both may be seriously injured. This is the plan  which is used by the most successful skunk farmers and is recommended.    Great care should be exercised in the selection of the males for  breeding stock. Only the large and healthy animals of good color should  be used and all others should be killed and their skins marketed while  they are in good condition.    While the animals do not always breed strictly true to color, the white  markings may be greatly reduced and the general stock improved by  selected breeding. One should, each year secure fresh breeding stock  from other localities and related animals should not be allowed to breed  together or in a few years the result will be disastrous. One can not be  too careful in this respect for it is very important.    After the mating season the females should be separated, placing three  or four together in small enclosures and they should be well fed or  otherwise they may kill and eat the young. They should be allowed to  remain in these small enclosures until the young animals are large  enough to take care of themselves, when they should be separated and  the females may again be placed in the large enclosure.    GENERAL INFORMATION.--From the commencement of the breeding season until  late in the fall the animals require a larger amount of food than during  the winter and especially during the breeding season and while the  mother is still nursing the young they will require plenty of nourishing  food. They require fresh drinking water at all times and the enclosures  should be so arranged that each compartment will be supplied.    As before stated one should use care in selecting animals for breeding  purposes as it is in this way that the quality of the fur will be  improved and the business made to be a profitable one. All small and  weak animals and those showing considerable white fur, especially males  should be killed off while the fur is in good condition. If you wish to  increase the number of animals do not be tempted for the sake of the  higher prices realized for the finer skins to kill off animals that  should be kept for breeding.    The animals should never be allowed to become frightened by the  intrusion of dogs into the enclosure--dogs should be kept away at all  times.    The skunk raiser must watch closely at all times to see that the  enclosure fences are in good shape so that the animals do not escape. If  they are found digging holes near the fence, these holes should be  filled up so as to discourage the workers.    Fleas and other parasites are likely to bother the animals and they  should have plenty of room so that they can change dens when the old  habitations become infested with vermin.    On the whole, one should study the habits of the animals on every  opportunity and attend to their wants. If one will give the proper  attention to the animals and take an interest in them there is no reason  why he should not succeed.          CHAPTER VII.    MINK RAISING.      There is only one species of mink found in North America, altho there  are a number of varieties differing in size, color and quality of fur.  Thus we find in Northern Maine and New Brunswick a very small variety  having a fine silky fur of a very dark shade; farther west and south a  somewhat larger variety, paler in color, and thruout the Mississippi  valley and parts of the south, also parts of Western Canada, a very  large mink is found, but running quite pale, and the fur somewhat  coarser than the northeastern varieties.    Again, on parts of the Pacific Coast, a very small and poorer quality  are found, and the mink from the lower Yukon River of Alaska are said to  be of very poor quality. One or more varieties are found in almost every  part of the United States, Canada and Alaska. Wherever there is running  water their tracks may be seen; but they seem to prefer the smaller  streams, as a rule, and they will be found as plentiful in the thickly  settled parts as in the wilderness.    Mink are great travelers, but each individual animal has his regular  route and seldom ventures far out of his course. While they travel  streams and lake shores as much as possible, they do not hesitate to  leave the stream and cut across country in order to reach some other  water-course. During the mating season they also wander away from the  streams more than at other times. While they are always found in the  neighborhood of fresh water, they are not a water animal, and in  following a stream, always run on the bank, but usually as near to the  water as possible.    In the thickly settled districts where the most valuable fur-bearing  animals, such as the silver foxes, otters, etc., are not to be found,  the mink is the most valuable and is eagerly sought by the trappers. The  fur is at its best during the first two months after it becomes prime,  which in the north will be about November 1st, and in the south perhaps  a month later. After the first two months, the fur commences to fade,  especially where the country is open and the animal is exposed to the  bright light, for the mink is not, strictly, a nocturnal animal. The  darkest skins come, as a rule, from the timbered parts of the country.  While the female is smaller than the male, she is also darker, and the  skins have about an equal value.    The food of the mink consists mostly of rabbits, partridges, quail,  squirrels, muskrats, mice, fish, frogs, birds' eggs, etc. While they  will eat stale meat, if hungry, they prefer strictly fresh food.  Occasionally they will pay a visit to the poultry house, for like most  animals of the weasel family, they have a decided liking for the  domesticated birds. They are very fond of fish, and when same may be  secured easily, they will kill large numbers, merely for the sake of  killing.    They are active and hardy little animals, apparently almost tireless, as  they will travel long distances in a night. They are perhaps most active  during the fall months, and in the north they travel very little during  the cold part of winter.    The burrow or den of the mink is usually located in the high bank of  some stream, but they frequently inhabit deserted dens of other animals,  but always near the water. It is in these dens that the female and her  offspring spend the summer months, never straying far from home.    The first two weeks of March is the minks' season for mating, and the  young--from four to six--are born about six weeks later. When confined  in enclosures where the diet, water and temperature are similar with  each animal, there is so little difference in the time of mating and  bearing their young, that five or six litters may make their appearance  within twelve hours of each other.    The young are blind from four to five weeks, but are very active and as  playful as kittens. The mother weans them when they are eight or ten  weeks old. At about four weeks the mother begins to feed them meat, and  they learn to suck at it before they have teeth to eat it. The young are  fed by the mother on frogs, fish, mice, etc., until they are three or  four months old, when she leaves them to shift for themselves. The young  soon separate and do their hunting alone. They do not pair and the male  is a rover and \"free lover.\"    Mink are extremely cleanly and as soon as the den becomes foul, the  mother moves the family to some other nest.    MINK BREEDING.--There are a great many readers of the H-T-T who live in  the city, that long for some way to profitably spend their idle time. I  will give a successful way of breeding mink, according to Mr. Boughton's  Guide:    \"Wild adult mink are almost untamable, but young ones readily submit to  handling and are easily domesticated. The time to secure young mink is  in May or June when they begin to run with their dams. The streams must  be quietly watched for mink trails, and these, if possible, tracked to  the nest. When they leave the hole, the young ones may be secured, or  they may be dug out. Those who own a breeding stock of mink ask very  high prices for them, but if the aforesaid plan is carried out, it is an  easy matter to get the young wild ones.    \"MANAGEMENT OF MINK.--Mink being by nature solitary, wandering animals,  being seldom seen in company except in mating season, it is impossible  to rear them successfully if large numbers are kept together constantly;  therefore, their enclosure should be a large one. The male and the  female should be permitted to be together frequently from the middle of  February until the middle of March. At all other times keep them  entirely separate.    \"About this season the mink should be allowed plenty of fine grass,  which they will carry into their boxes to make their nests out of. A box  3 or 4 feet long and 18 inches wide is the shape they prefer. It should  be placed as far as possible from the water to prevent the mink from  carrying mud and water into it. The young mink, when first born, are  small and delicate, destitute of any kind of fur and much resemble young  rats. If the old mink is tame, the young ones may be taken out of the  nest and handled when they are three weeks old. They will soon learn to  drink milk, and may be fed every day. At three weeks of age they may be  taken from their mother and put into a pen by themselves, and then they  will soon become very playful, are pretty, and make much better mothers "]]]
