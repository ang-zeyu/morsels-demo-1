Writers  have generally spoken of the Court as consisting of seven Judges.  Saltonstall's resignation does not appear to have led to a new  appointment; and, perhaps, Hathorne, who generally acted as an Examining  Magistrate, and signed most of the Commitments of the prisoners, did not  often, if ever, sit as a Judge. In this way, the Court may have been  reduced to seven. Stephen Sewall was appointed Clerk, and George Corwin,  High Sheriff.    Thus established and organized, on the twenty-seventh of May, the Court  sat, on the second of June, for the trial of Bridget Bishop. Her  Death-warrant was signed, on the eighth of June, the very day the  Legislature convened; and she was executed on the tenth. This was,  indeed, \"precipitancy.\" Before the General Court had time, possibly, to  make \"an establishment of Courts of Justice\" in the exercise of the  powers bestowed upon it by the Charter, this Special Court--suddenly  sprung upon the country, against the deliberate first judgment of the  Council itself, and not called for by any emergency of the moment which  the General Court, just coming on the stage, could not legally,  constitutionally, and adequately, have met--dipped its hands in blood;  and an infatuated and appalled people and their representatives allowed  the wheels of the Juggernaut to roll on.    The question, who are responsible for the creation, in such hot haste,  of this Court, and for its instant entrance upon its ruthless work, may  not be fully and specifically answered, with absolute demonstration, but  we may approach a satisfactory solution of it. We know that a word from  either of the Mathers would have stopped it. Their relations to the  Government were, then, controlling. Further, if, at that time, either of  the other leading Ministers--Willard, or Allen--had demanded delay, it  would have been necessary to pause; but none appear to have made open  opposition; and all must share in the responsibility for subsequent  events.    Phips says that the affair at Salem Village was represented to him as  \"much like that of Sweden, about thirty years ago.\" This Swedish case  was Cotton Mather's special topic. In his _Wonders of the Invisible  World_, he says that \"other good people have in this way been harassed,  but none in circumstances more like to ours, than the people of God in  Sweedland.\" He introduces, into the _Wonders_, a separate account of it;  and reproduces it in his _Life of Phips_, incorporated subsequently into  the _Magnalia_. The first point he makes, in presenting this case, is as  follows: \"The inhabitants had earnestly sought God in prayer, and yet  their affliction continued. Whereupon Judges had a Special Commission to  find, and root out the hellish crew; and the rather, because another  County in the Kingdom, which had been so molested, was delivered upon  the execution of the Witches.\"--_The Wonders of the Invisible World._  Edit. London, 1693, p. 48.    The importance attached by Cotton Mather to the affair in Sweden,  especially viewed in connection with the foregoing extract, indicates  that the change, I have conjectured, had come over him, as to the way to  deal with Witches; and that he had reached the conclusion that prayer  would not, and nothing but the gallows could, answer the emergency. In  the Swedish case, was found the precedent for a \"Special Commission of  Oyer and Terminer.\"    Well might the Governor have felt the importance of relieving himself,  as far as possible, from the responsibility of having organized such a  Court, and of throwing it upon his advisers. The tribunal consisted of  the Deputy-governor, as Chief-justice, and eight other persons, all  members of the Council, and each, as has been shown, owing his seat, at  that Board, to the Mathers.    The recent publication of this letter of Governor Phips enables us now  to explain certain circumstances, before hardly intelligible, and to  appreciate the extent of the outrages committed by those who controlled  the administration of the Province, during the Witchcraft trials.    In 1767, Andrew Oliver, then Secretary of the Province, was directed to  search the Records of the Government to ascertain precedents, touching a  point of much interest at that time. From his Report, part of which is  given in Drake's invaluable _History of Boston_, [_p. 728_] it appears  that the Deputy-governor, Stoughton, by the appointment of the Governor,  attended by the Secretary, administered the oaths to the members of the  House of Representatives, convened on the eighth of June, 1692; that, as  Deputy-governor, he sat in Council, generally, during that year, and  was, besides, annually elected to the Council, until his death, in 1701.  All that time, he was sitting, in the double capacity of an _ex-officio_  and an elected member; and for much the greater part of it, in the  absence of Phips, as acting Governor. The Records show that he sat in  Council when Sir William Phips was present, and presided over it, when  he was not present, and ever after Phips's decease, until a new Governor  came over in 1699. His annual election, by the House of Representatives,  as one of the twenty-eight Councillors, while, as Deputy or acting  Governor, he was entitled to a seat, is quite remarkable. It gave him a  distinct legislative character, and a right, as an elected member of the  body, to vote and act, directly, in all cases, without restraint or  embarrassment, in debate and on Committees, in the making, as well as  administering, the law.    In the letter now under consideration, Governor Phips says: \"I was  almost the whole time of the proceeding abroad, in the Service of their  Majesties in the Eastern part of the country.\"    The whole tenor of the letter leaves an impression that, being so much  away from the scene, in frequent and long absences, he was not cognizant  of what was going on. He depended \"upon the judgment of the Court,\" as  to its methods of proceeding; and was surprised when those methods were  brought to his attention. Feeling his own incapacity to handle such a  business, he was willing to leave it to those who ought to have been  more competent. Indeed, he passed the whole matter over to the  Deputy-governor. In a letter, for which I am indebted to Mr. Goodell,  dated the twentieth of February, 1693, to the Earl of Nottingham,  transmitting copies of laws passed by the General Court, Governor Phips  says: \"Not being versed in law, I have depended upon the Lieu^t Gov^r,  who is appointed Judge of the Courts, to see that they be exactly  agreeable to the laws of England, and not repugnant in any part. If  there be any error, I know it will not escape your observation, and  desire a check may be given for what may be amiss.\"    The closing sentence looks somewhat like a want of confidence in the  legal capacity and judgment of Stoughton, owing perhaps, to the bad work  he had made at the Salem trials, the Summer before; but the whole  passage shows that Phips, conscious of his own ignorance of such things,  left them wholly to the Chief-justice.    The Records show that he sat in Council to the close of the Legislature,  on the second of July. But the main business was, evidently, under the  management of Stoughton, who was Chairman of a large Joint Committee,  charged with adjusting the whole body of the laws to the transition of  the Colony, from an independent Government, under the first Charter, to  the condition of a subject Province.    One person had been tried and executed; and the Court was holding its  second Session when the Legislature adjourned. Phips went to the  eastward, immediately after the eighth of July. Again, on the first of  August, he embarked from Boston with a force of four hundred and fifty  men, for the mouth of the Kennebec. In the Archives of Massachusetts,  Secretary's office, State House, Vol. LI., p. 9, is the original  document, signed by Phips, dated on the first of August, 1692, turning  over the Government to Stoughton, during his absence. It appears by  Church's _Eastern Expeditions_, Part II., p. 82, edited by H. M. Dexter,  and published by Wiggin & Lunt, Boston, 1867, that, during a  considerable part of the month of August, the Governor must have been  absent, engaged in important operations on the coast of Maine. About the  middle of September, he went again to the Kennebec, not returning until  a short time before the twelfth of October. In the course of the year,  he also was absent for a while in Rhode Island. Although an energetic  and active man, he had as much on his hands, arising out of questions as  to the extent of his authority over Connecticut and Rhode Island and the  management of affairs at the eastward, as he could well attend to. His  Instructions, too, from the Crown, made it his chief duty to protect the  eastern portions of his Government. The state of things there, in  connection with Indian assaults and outrages upon the outskirt  settlements, under French instigation, was represented as urgently  demanding his attention. Besides all this, his utmost exertions were  needed to protect the sea-coast against buccaneers. In addition to the  public necessities, thus calling him to the eastward, it was,  undoubtedly, more agreeable to his feelings, to revisit his native  region and the home of his early years, where, starting from the  humblest spheres of mechanical labor and maritime adventure, as a  ship-carpenter and sailor, he had acquired the manly energy and  enterprise that had conducted him to fortune, knightly honor, and the  Commission of Governor of New England. All the reminiscences and best  affections of his nature made him prompt to defend the region thus  endeared to him. It was much more congenial to his feelings than to  remain under the ceremonial and puritanic restraints of the seat of  Government, and involved in perplexities with which he had no ability,  and probably no taste, to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26981"],[0,"Pan-Islam (#10)"],[1,"-mark was plainly stamped on it. There had been  widespread organisation against us, and the serpent's eggs of sedition  and revolt had been hatched in centres scattered all over the eastern  hemisphere, but their venomous progeny had been crushed before they  became formidable.    As a world-force this band of pan-Islamism had failed because it had  been invoked by the wrong people for a wrong purpose. Such a movement  should at least have as its driving power some great spiritual crisis:  this Turco-German manifestation of it had its origin in self-interest,  and if successful would have immolated Arabia on the demoniac altar of  _Weltpolitik_. Seyid Muhammed er-Rashid Ridha, a descendant of the  Prophet and one of the greatest Arab theologians living, has voiced the  verdict of Islam on this unscrupulous and self-seeking adventure in a  trenchant article published in September, 1916. He showed up Enver and  his Unionist party as an atheist among atheists who had deprived the  Sultan of his rightful power and Islam of its religious head, and  contrasted their conduct with that of the British, who exempted the  Hejaz from the blockade enforced against the rest of the Ottoman Empire  until it became quite clear that the Turks were benefiting chiefly by  that exemption, and who, out of respect for the holy places of Islam,  refrained from making that country a theatre of war.    True to the Teutonic tradition, the movement had been laboriously  organised, but lacked psychic insight, for the Turk is too much of a  Tartar and too little of a Moslem to appreciate the Arab mind, and the  German ignored it, rooting with eager, guttural grunts among the  carefully cultivated religious prejudices of Islam like a hog hunting  truffles until whacked out of it by the irate cultivators.    The following incident may serve to illustrate their crude tactics. Soon  after the Turks came into the war the mullah of the principal mosque at  Damascus was told to announce _jihad_ against the British from his  pulpit on the following Friday in accordance with an order from the  Grand Mufti at Stamboul. The poor man appears to have jibbed  considerably and sent his family over the Nejd border to be out of reach  of Turkish persecution. Finally he decided to conform, but when he  climbed the steps of his \"minbar\" and scanned his congregation he saw a  group of German officers wearing tarboushes with a look of almost  porcine complacency. His fear fell from him in a gust of rage and he  spoke somewhat as follows: \"I am ordered to proclaim _jihad_. A _jihad_,  as you know, is a Holy War to protect our Holy Places against infidels.  This being so, what are these infidel _pigs_ doing in our mosque?\"    There was a most unseemly scuffle; the Turco-German contingent tried to  seize the mullah; the Arab congregation defended him strenuously from  arrest. In the confusion that worthy man got clear away and joined his  family in Nejd. _Jihad_ is incumbent on all Moslems if against infidel  aggression. We stood on the defensive when the Turks first attacked us  on the Canal, and when we finally overran Palestine and Syria it was in  co-operation with the Arabs, who have more right there than the Turks.    Those who forged the blade of this counterfeit _jihad_ could not temper  it in the flame of religious fervour, and it shattered against the  shield of religious tolerance and good faith: we make mistakes, but can  honestly claim those two virtues.        FOOTNOTES:        [Footnote A: \"The Land of Uz,\" Macmillan.]          CHAPTER III    ITS STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS      To gauge the strength or weakness of pan-Islam as a world-force we may  best compare it with its great militant rival, the Christian Church,  choosing common ground as the only sound basis of comparison, and  remembering that it is pan-Islam we are examining rather than Islam  itself--the tree, not the root; and though we cannot study the one  without considering the other, Islam has already been extensively  discussed by men better qualified than myself to deal with it: the  requirements of this work only call for comparison so far as the  driving-power of pan-Islam is concerned as a material force.    First of all we must discard common factors. I set the great Shiah  schism against the Catholic Church (omitting the word \"Roman\" as a  contradiction in terms) and cancel both for the purposes of comparison.  Catholicism, is not, of course, schismatic, otherwise there are points  of resemblance, such as observances of saints and shrines, which have  permeated the other sects to a certain extent; also the degree of  antagonism is about the same. Therefore we can ignore the Catholic  Church in this chapter, and when we are talking of pan-Islam we should  consider it a Sunnite (or Orthodox) movement, and count the Shiites out,  as they do not even recognise the same centre of pilgrimage.    Perhaps the strongest factor in pan-Islam as a political movement or a  world-wide fellowship is the Meccan pilgrimage. I have already alluded  to its cosmopolitan nature in the previous chapter, but never realised  it so much till after the surrender of Jeddah, when stately Bokhariots,  jabbering Javanese, Malays, Chinese, Russians, American citizens and  South Africans were among those who beset me as stranded pilgrims. This  implies a very wide sphere of influence, against which we can only set  the well-known immorality and greed which pilgrims complain of at Mecca;  a huge influx of cosmopolitan visitors to _any_ centre will generally  cause such abuses. On the feast of Arafat there are normally 100,000  pilgrims in the Meccan area who represent 100 million orthodox Moslems  throughout the world, while the actual population of the city is only  50,000.    The Arabic language is another strong bond of brotherhood in Islam. I do  not mean to say that it is generally \"understanded of the people,\" any  more than Latin is throughout the Catholic world; but it is the language  of most Sunnites and is moderately understood in Somaliland, East  Africa, Java and the Malay peninsula as the language of the Koran; in  fact, it is the only written language in Somaliland, and Turkey uses the  script though not the tongue.    The daily observances of prayer, with their simple but obligatory  ceremonial, and the yearly fast for the month of Ramadhan unite Moslems  with the common ties of duty and hardship, as in the comradeship which  sailors and soldiers have for each other throughout the world.    Then, again, there is no colour-line in Islam; a negro may rise to place  and power (he often does), and usually enjoys the intimate confidence of  his master as not readily amenable to local intrigue. Difference of  nationality is not stressed except by the Young Turks, who have slighted  Semitic Moslems to their own undoing. Contrast this attitude with our  Church and estimate the precise amount of Christian brotherhood between  an Orthodox Greek, a Welsh Wesleyan, an Ethiopian priest, a Scotch  Presbyterian, and an Anglican bishop (since the Kikuyu heresy). Even  within the narrow limits of one sect there is nothing like the  fellowship one finds in secular societies. Which is the stronger appeal,  \"Anglican communicant\" or \"Freemason\"? Is a cross or the quadrant and  compasses the more potent charm?    Arabs credit us Christians with a much stronger bond of sympathy between  co-religionists than is actually the case. It is true that those who  come into any sort of contact with us realise that there is a distinct  difference in form of worship and sentiment between Catholics (whom they  call _Christyan_) and Protestants (or _Nasara_), but I shall not readily  forget the extraordinary conduct of a Hejazi who boarded us off Jeddah  with some of the effects belonging to the murdered Germans mentioned in  the previous chapter. He must have had the firm conviction that we  Christians would avenge the killing of other Christians by Moslems, for  he merely told me that he had in his possession certain property of the  _Allemani_, and I told him that he would be suitably rewarded on  producing it; I found out later that he had boasted to our ship's  interpreter (a Mussulman) that he was one of the slayers, and it  occurred to me that if that were the case he might be able to give me  further information, or perhaps produce papers of theirs which might  appear valueless to him but would be of interest to us. I interviewed  him on deck and suggested this, reminding him of what he had told the  interpreter, but laying no stress on the deed he had confessed, for it  was outside our jurisdiction and no concern of mine.    \"Papers?\" he said. \"By all means, I will go and fetch them,\" and  breaking from my light hold of his sleeve he flickered over the rail and  dropped into the sea some thirty feet below. Two armed marines stepped  to the rail with a clatter of breech-bolts and looked inquiringly at me.  Meanwhile my bold murderer was calling on his God, for he wore a full  bandoleer, which was weighing him down. Out darted a fishing-canoe from  under our quarter and made for him, but its occupants took the hint I  conveyed through a megaphone and confined their efforts to saving him  for the duty-cutter to pick up.    He was brought before me dripping wet, with the fear of death in his  eyes. I thought this was due to the foolish risk he had taken, and spoke  in gentle reproof of his conduct, pointing out that if any boat had been  alongside where he leaped he would have met with a bad accident. To my  surprise he fell at my feet and scrabbled at my clean white shoes,  imploring me to spare his life. I put him down as somewhat mad, and  asked \"Number One\" to put a sentry over him to see that he did not  repeat his attempt to avoid our acquaintance. He clung to me like a  limpet and had to be removed by force, with despairing entreaties for  mercy, disregarding my still puzzled assurances as to his personal  safety. I"]]]
