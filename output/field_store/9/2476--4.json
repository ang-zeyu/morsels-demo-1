A silent tarn lies  shimmering in a green hollow beneath, and over its marge constantly flit  a pair of summer snipe. The bellowing of red deer comes from a  neighbouring corrie, and a herd of roe are browsing on the confines of  the scrub. The sun mounts the Eastern air, drives the mists away and  beyond the lichen patches loved by the ptarmigan--and it is day.    A glorious bird is the red grouse! Listen to his warning \"kok, kok,  kok,\" as he eyes the invader of his moorland haunts. Now that it is day  his mate joins him on the \"knowe.\" The sun warms up his rufus plumage,  and the crescent-shaped patch of vermilion over the eye glows in the  strong light. It is these sights and sounds that warm me to my work,  and dearly I love the moor-game. Years ago I had sown grain along the  fell-side so as to entice the grouse within range of an old flint-lock  which I used with deadly effect from behind a stone wall. Then snares  were set on the barley sheaves and corn stooks, by which a brace of  birds were occasionally bagged. In after years an unforseen grouse  harvest came in quite an unexpected manner. With the enclosure of the  Commons hundreds of miles of wire fencing was erected, and in this way,  before the birds had become accustomed to it, numbers were killed by  flying against the fences. The casualties mostly occurred during  \"thick\" weather, or when the mists had clung to the hills for days. At  such times grouse fly low, and strike before seeing the obstacle. I  never failed to note the mist-caps hanging to the fell-tops, and then,  bag in hand, walked parallel to miles and miles of flimsy fence.  Sometimes a dozen brace of birds were picked up in a morning; and, on  the lower grounds, an occasional partridge, woodcock, or snipe.    [Illustration]    Grouse are the only game that ever tempted me to poach during close  time, and then I only erred by a few days. Birds sold in London on the  morning of the \"Twelfth\" bring the biggest prices of the season, and to  supply the demand was a temptation I could never resist. Many a  \"Squire,\" many a Country Justice has been tempted as I was, and fell as  I fell. It is not too much to say that every one of the three thousand  birds sold in London on the opening day has been poached during the  \"fence\" time. In the north, country station-masters find hampers dropped  on their platforms addressed to London dealers, but, as to who brought  them, or how they came there, none ever knows.    The only true prophet of the grouse-moors is the poacher. Months before  the \"squire\" and keeper he knows whether disease will assert itself or  no. By reason of his out-door life he has accuracy of eye and judgment  sufficient to interpret what he sees aright. He is abroad in all  weathers, and through every hour of the day and night. His clothes have  taken on them the duns and browns of the moorlands; and he owns the  subtle influence which attracts wild creatures to him. He has watched  grouse \"at home\" since the beginning of the year. On the first spring  day the sun shines brightly at noon. The birds bask on the brae, and  spread their wings to the warmth. As the sun gains in power, and spring  comes slowly up the way, the red grouse give out gurgling notes, and  indulge in much strutting. The fell \"becks\" sparkles in the sun; the  merlin screams over the heather, and the grouse packs break up. The  birds are now seen singly or in pairs, and brae answers brae from dawn  till dark. The cock grouse takes his stand on some grey rock, and erects  or depresses at pleasure his vermilion eye-streak. Pairing is not long  continued, and the two find out a depression in the heather which they  line with bents and mountain grasses. About eight eggs are laid, and the  cock grouse takes his stand upon the \"knowe\" to guard the nest from  predaceous carrion and hooded crows. If hatching is successful the young  birds are quickly on their legs, and through spring and summer follow  the brooding birds. They grow larger and plumper each day, until it is  difficult to detect them from the adult. Meanwhile August has come, and  soon devastating death is dealt out to them. The sport, so far as the  poacher is concerned, begins at the first rolling away of the morning  mists; and then he often makes the best bag of the year. It was rarely  that I was abroad later than two in the morning, and my first business  was to wade out thigh-deep into the purple heather. From such a  position it is not difficult to locate the crowing of the moorbirds as  they answer each other across the heather. When this was done I would  gain a rough stone wall, and then, by imitating the gurgling call-notes  of cock or hen I could bring up every grouse within hearing. Sometimes a  dozen would be about me at one time. Then the birds were picked off as  they flew over the knolls and braes, or as they boldly stood on any  eminence near. If this method is deadly in early August, it is  infinitely more so during pairing time. Then, if time and leisure be  allowed, and the poacher is a good \"caller,\" almost every bird on a moor  may be bagged.    The greatest number of grouse, and consequently the best poaching, is to  be had on moors on which the heather is regularly burned. Grouse love  the shoots of ling which spring up after burning, and the birds which  feed upon this invariably have the brightest plumage. On a well-burnt  moor the best poaching method is by using a silk net. By watching for  traces during the day it is not difficult to detect where the birds  roost, and once this is discovered the rest is easy. The net is trailed  along the ground by two men, and dropped instantly on the whirr of  wings. The springing of the birds is the only guide in the darkness,  though the method skilfully carried out is most destructive, and  sometimes a whole covey is bagged at one sweep. Silk nets have three  good qualities for night work, those made of any other material being  cumbersome and nearly useless. They are light, strong, and are easily  carried. It is well to have about eighteen inches of glazed material  along the bottom of the net, or it is apt to catch in dragging. Where  poaching is practised, keepers often place in the likeliest places a  number of strong stakes armed with protruding nails. These, however, may  be removed and replanted after the night's work; or, just at dusk a  bunch of white feathers may be tied to point the position of each.    [Illustration]    The planting of grain patches along the moor-side has been mentioned,  and on these in late autumn great numbers of birds are bagged. Grouse  are exceedingly fond of oats, and in the early morning the stooks are  sometimes almost black with them. A pot shot here from behind a wall or  fence is generally a profitable one, as the heavy charge of shot is sent  straight at the \"brown.\" Black-game are as keen as red grouse on oats,  and a few sheaves thrown about always attracts them. Although the  blackcock is a noble bird in appearance, he is dull and heavy, and is  easily bagged. Early in the season the birds lie until almost trod upon,  and of all game are the easiest to net. They roost on the ground, and  usually seek out some sheltered brae-side on which to sleep. If closely  watched at evening, it is not difficult to clap a silk net over them  upon the first favourable night, when both mother and grown young are  bagged together. That there are gentlemen poachers as well as casuals  and amateurs, the following incident relating to black-game shows: \"On a  dull misty day they are easily got at: they will sit on the thorn bushes  and alders, and let the shooter pick them off one by one. I remember  once, on such a day, taking a noble sportsman who was very keen to shoot  a blackcock, up to some black game sitting on a thorn hedge. When he got  within about twenty-five yards he fired his first barrel (after taking a  very deliberate aim) at an old grey hen. She took no notice, only  shaking her feathers a little, and hopping a short distance further on.  The same result with the second barrel. He loaded again and fired. This  time the old hen turned round, and looked to see where the noise and  unpleasant tickling sensation came from, and grew uneasy; the next  attempt made her fly on to where her companions were sitting, and our  friend then gave up his weapon to me in despair. Black game grow very  stupid also when on stubbles; they will let a man fire at them, and if  they do not see him, will fly round the field and settle again, or pitch  on a wall quite near to him. Grouse will do the same thing. There is not  much 'sport' in such shooting as this, but when out alone, and wanting  to make a bag, it is a sure and quick way to do so. It may be called  'poaching'--all I can say is, there would be many more gentlemen  poachers if they could obtain such chances, and could not get game in  any other way.\"    Both grouse and black game may frequently be brought within range by  placing a dead or stuffed bird on a rock or a stone wall. A small forked  stick is made to support the head and neck of the decoy \"dummy,\" which,  if there are birds in the vicinity, soon attracts them. As a rule the  lure is not long successful, but sufficiently so as to enable the  poacher to make a big bag. Upon one occasion I made a remarkable  addition to our fur and feather. In the darkness a movement was heard  among the dense branches of a Scotch fir, when, looking up, a large bird  which seemed as big as a turkey commenced to flutter off. It was stopped  before it had flown many yards, and proved to be a handsome cock  Capercailzie in splendid plumage. Had I been certain as to what it was I  certainly should not have fired.    Grouse stalking is fascinating sport, and by this method I usually made  my greatest achievements. The stalking was mainly done from behind an  old moorland horse, with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36974"],[0,"Old Trails on the Niagara Frontier (#10)"],[1,"us  the greatest joy. He lay for many weeks at the very verge of the grave,  and it was marvelous to all to see his skin, which had been so empurpled  and full of malignant humors, come wholesome and fair again. I have  often remarked, in this hard country, that of all Europeans the Fathers  of the Holy Orders may be brought nearest to death, and yet regain their  wonted health. They have the same prejudice for life that the wildest  savage has. But as for the rest of us, who are neither savage nor holy,  it is by a slim chance that we live at all.    Now the Father, and two or three of the others who had the strength to  risk it, set out with a part of Michitonka's people to Cataracouy[9] and  Montreal, to carry the news of our extremity. And on a soft April day as  we looked over lake, we saw a sail; and we knew that we had kept the  fort until the relief company was sent as had been commanded. But it had  been a great pinch.    Now I am come to that which after all I chiefly set out to write down;  for I have ever held that great woes should be passed over with few  words, but it is meet to dwell upon the hour of gladness. And this hour  was now arrived, when we saw approach the new commandant, the Sieur  Desbergeres, captain of one of the companies of the Detachment of the  Marine, and with him the Father Milet, of the Society of Jesus. There  was a goodly company, whose names are well writ on the history of this  New France: the Sieurs De la Mothe, La Rabelle, Demuratre de Clerin and  de Gemerais, and others, besides a host of fine fellows of the common  rank; with fresh food that meant life to us.    Of all who came that April day, it was the Father Milet who did the  most. The very morning that he landed, we knelt about him at mass; and  scarce had he rested in his cabin than he marked a spot in the midst of  the square, where a cross should stand, and bade as many as could, get  about the hewing of it; and although I was yet feeble and might rest as  I liked, I chose to share in the work, for so I found my pleasure. A  fair straight oak was felled and well hewn, and with infinite toil the  timber was taken within the palisades and further dressed; and while the  carpenters toiled to mortise the cross-piece and fasten it with pins,  Father Milet himself traced upon the arms the symbols for the legend:      Regnat, Vincit, Imperat Christus.    And these letters were well cut into the wood, in the midst of them  being the sign of the Sacred Heart. We had it well made, and a place dug  for it, on a Thursday; and on the next morning, which was Good Friday,  the reverend Father placed his little portable altar in the midst of the  square, where we all, officers and men, and even some of the Miamis who  were yet with us, assembled for the mass. Then we raised the great cross  and planted it firmly in the midst of the little square. The service of  the blessing of it lay hold of my mind mightily, for my fancy was that  this great sign of victory had sprung from the midst of the graves where  De Troyes and four score of my comrades lay; and being in this tender  mood (for I was still weak in body) the words which the Father read from  his breviary seemed to rest the more clearly in my mind.    \"_Adjutorium nostrum in nomine Domini._\" Father Milet had a good voice,  with a sort of tenderness in it, so that we were every one disposed to  such silence and attention, that I could even hear the little waves  lapping the shore below the fort. And when he began with the  \"_Oramus_\"--\"_Rogamus te Domine sancte Pater omnipotens_,\"--I was that  moved, by the joy of it, and my own memories, that I wept--and I a  soldier!    It may be believed that the Sunday which followed, which was the  Paschal, was kept by us with such worship and rejoicing as had never yet  been known in those remote parts. Holy men had been on that river  before, it is true; but none had abode there for long, nor had any set  up so great a cross, nor had there ever such new life come to men as we  knew at Fort Denonville that Easter.    For a space, all things went well. What with the season (for spring ever  inspires men to new undertakings) and the bitter lessons learned in the  great pinch of the past winter, we were no more an idle set, but kept  all at work, and well. Yet the Iroquois pestered us vastly, being set on  thereto by the English, who claimed this spot. And in September there  came that pilot Maheut, bringing his bark La General over the shoal at  the river's mouth all unexpected; and she was scarce anchored in the  little roadstead than Desbergeres knew he was to abandon all. It was  cause of chagrin to the great Marquis, I make no doubt, thus to drop the  prize he had so tried to hold; but some of us in the fort had no stomach  for another winter on the Niagara, and we made haste to execute the  orders which the Marquis de Denonville had sent. We put the guns on  board La General. We set the gate open, and tore down the rows of pales  on the south and east sides of the square. Indeed the wind had long ago  begun this work, so that towards the lake the pales (being but little  set in the earth) had fallen or leaned over, so they could readily have  been scaled, or broken through. But as the order was, we left the cabins  and quarters standing, with doors ajar, to welcome who might come,  Iroquois or wolf, for there was naught within. But Father Milet took  down from above the door of his cabin the little sun dial. \"The shadow  of the great cross falls divers ways,\" was his saying.    Early the next morning, being the 15th of September, of the year 1688,  being ready for the embarkation, Father Milet summoned us to the last  mass he might say in the place. It was a sad morning, for the clouds  hung heavy; the lake was of a somber and forbidding cast, and the very  touch in the air forebode autumnal gales. As we knelt around the cross  for the last time, the ensign brought the standards which Desbergeres  had kept, and holding the staves, knelt also. Certain Miamis, too, who  were about to make the Niagara portage, stayed to see what the priest  might do. And at the end of the office Father Milet did an uncommon  thing, for he was mightily moved. He turned from us toward the cross,  and throwing wide his arms spoke the last word--\"Amen.\"    There were both gladness and sorrow in our hearts as we embarked. Lake  and sky took on the hue of lead, foreboding storm. We durst carry but  little sail, and at the sunset hour were scarce a league off shore. As  it chanced, Father Milet and I stood together on the deck and gazed  through the gloom toward that dark coast. While we thus stood, there  came a rift betwixt the banked clouds to the west, so that the sun, just  as it slipped from sight, lighted those Niagara shores, and we saw but  for an instant, above the blackness and the desolation, the great cross  as in fire or blood gleam red.

One pleasant September day in 1897 it was my good fortune, under expert  guidance, to follow for a little the one solitary trail made by the  American patriots in Western New York during the Revolutionary War, the  one expedition of our colonial forces approaching this region during  that period. This was the famous \"raid\" led by Gen. John Sullivan in the  summer of 1779. Our quest took us up the long hill slope west of Conesus  Lake, in what is now the town of Groveland, Livingston Co., to a  spot--among the most memorable in the annals of Western New York, yet  unmarked and known to but a few--where a detachment of Sullivan's army,  under Lieut. Boyd, were waylaid and massacred by the Indians. It was on  the 13th of September that this tragedy occurred. Two days later Gen.  Sullivan, having accomplished the main purpose of his raid--the  destruction of Indian villages and crops--turned back towards  Pennsylvania, returning to Easton, whence the expedition had started. He  had come within about eighty miles of the Niagara. \"Though I had it not  in command,\" wrote Gen. Sullivan in his report to the Secretary of War,  \"I should have ventured to have paid [Fort] Niagara a visit, had I been  supplied with fifteen days' provisions in addition to what I had, which  I am persuaded from the bravery and ardor of our troops would have  fallen into our hands.\"[10] This was the nearest approach to any attempt  made by the Americans to enter this region during that war.    The events of Sullivan's expedition are well known. Few episodes of the  Revolution are more fully recorded. But what is the reverse of the  picture? What lay at the other side of this Western New York wilderness  which Sullivan failed to penetrate? What was going on, up and down the  Niagara, and on Buffalo Creek, during those momentous years? We know  that the region was British, that old Fort Niagara was its garrison, the  principal rendezvous of the Indians and the base from which scalping  parties set out to harry the frontier settlements. The most dreadful  frontier tragedies of the war--Wyoming, Cherry Valley, and others--were  planned here and carried out with British cooeperation. But who were the  men and what were the incidents of the time, upon our Niagara frontier?  So far as I am aware, that period is for the most part a blank in our  histories. One may search the books in vain for any adequate  narrative--indeed for any but the most meager data--of the history of  the Niagara region during the Revolution. The materials are not lacking,  they are in fact abundant. In this paper I undertake only to give an  inkling of the character of events in this region during that grave  period in our nation's history.[11]    In 1778, Colonel Haldimand, afterward Sir Frederick, succeeded Gen. Guy  Carleton in the command of the British forces in Canada. He was  Commander in Chief, and Governor of Canada, until his recall in 1784.  Lord North was England's Prime"]]]
