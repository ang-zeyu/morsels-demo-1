Then the black hull rising above them,  had seemed a tower of strength, built to defy the utmost violence of  wind and wave; now it was but a slip of wood floating--on an unknown  depth of black, fathomless water. The blue light, which, at its first  flashing over the ocean, had made the very stars pale their lustre, and  lighted up with ghastly radiance the enormous vault of heaven, was now  only a point, brilliant and distinct it is true, but which by its very  brilliance dwarfed the ship into insignificance. The Malabar lay on  the water like a glow-worm on a floating leaf, and the glare of the  signal-fire made no more impression on the darkness than the candle  carried by a solitary miner would have made on the abyss of a coal-pit.    And yet the Malabar held two hundred creatures like themselves!    The water over which the boats glided was black and smooth, rising into  huge foamless billows, the more terrible because they were silent. When  the sea hisses, it speaks, and speech breaks the spell of terror; when  it is inert, heaving noiselessly, it is dumb, and seems to brood over  mischief. The ocean in a calm is like a sulky giant; one dreads that it  may be meditating evil. Moreover, an angry sea looks less vast in extent  than a calm one. Its mounting waves bring the horizon nearer, and  one does not discern how for many leagues the pitiless billows repeat  themselves. To appreciate the hideous vastness of the ocean one must see  it when it sleeps.    The great sky uprose from this silent sea without a cloud. The stars  hung low in its expanse, burning in a violent mist of lower ether. The  heavens were emptied of sound, and each dip of the oars was re-echoed in  space by a succession of subtle harmonies. As the blades struck the  dark water, it flashed fire, and the tracks of the boats resembled  two sea-snakes writhing with silent undulations through a lake of  quicksilver.    It had been a sort of race hitherto, and the rowers, with set teeth and  compressed lips, had pulled stroke for stroke. At last the foremost  boat came to a sudden pause. Best gave a cheery shout and passed her,  steering straight into the broad track of crimson that already reeked on  the sea ahead.    \"What is it?\" he cried.    But he heard only a smothered curse from Frere, and then his consort  pulled hard to overtake him.    It was, in fact, nothing of consequence--only a prisoner \"giving in\".    \"Curse it!\" says Frere, \"What's the matter with you? Oh, you, is  it?--Dawes! Of course, Dawes. I never expected anything better from such  a skulking hound. Come, this sort of nonsense won't do with me. It isn't  as nice as lolloping about the hatchways, I dare say, but you'll have to  go on, my fine fellow.\"    \"He seems sick, sir,\" said (with) compassionate bow.    \"Sick! Not he. Shamming. Come, give way now! Put your backs into it!\"  and the convict having picked up his oar, the boat shot forward again.    But, for all Mr. Frere's urging, he could not recover the way he had  lost, and Best was the first to run in under the black cloud that hung  over the crimsoned water.    At his signal, the second boat came alongside.    \"Keep wide,\" he said. \"If there are many fellows yet aboard, they'll  swamp us; and I think there must be, as we haven't met the boats,\" and  then raising his voice, as the exhausted crew lay on their oars, he  hailed the burning ship.    She was a huge, clumsily-built vessel, with great breadth of beam, and  a lofty poop-deck. Strangely enough, though they had so lately seen the  fire, she was already a wreck, and appeared to be completely deserted.  The chief hold of the fire was amidships, and the lower deck was one  mass of flame. Here and there were great charred rifts and gaps in her  sides, and the red-hot fire glowed through these as through the bars of  a grate. The main-mast had fallen on the starboard side, and trailed a  blackened wreck in the water, causing the unwieldy vessel to lean  over heavily. The fire roared like a cataract, and huge volumes of  flame-flecked smoke poured up out of the hold, and rolled away in a  low-lying black cloud over the sea.    As Frere's boat pulled slowly round her stern, he hailed the deck again  and again.    Still there was no answer, and though the flood of light that dyed the  water blood-red struck out every rope and spar distinct and clear, his  straining eyes could see no living soul aboard. As they came nearer,  they could distinguish the gilded letters of her name.    \"What is it, men?\" cried Frere, his voice almost drowned amid the roar  of the flames. \"Can you see?\"    Rufus Dawes, impelled, it would seem, by some strong impulse of  curiosity, stood erect, and shaded his eyes with his hand.    \"Well--can't you speak? What is it?\"    \"The Hydaspes!\"    Frere gasped.    The Hydaspes! The ship in which his cousin Richard Devine had sailed!  The ship for which those in England might now look in vain! The Hydaspes  which--something he had heard during the speculations as to this missing  cousin flashed across him.    \"Back water, men! Round with her! Pull for your lives!\"    Best's boat glided alongside.    \"Can you see her name?\"    Frere, white with terror, shouted a reply.    \"The Hydaspes! I know her. She is bound for Calcutta, and she has five  tons of powder aboard!\"    There was no need for more words. The single sentence explained the  whole mystery of her desertion. The crew had taken to the boats on the  first alarm, and had left their death-fraught vessel to her fate. They  were miles off by this time, and unluckily for themselves, perhaps, had  steered away from the side where rescue lay.    The boats tore through the water. Eager as the men had been to come,  they were more eager to depart. The flames had even now reached the  poop; in a few minutes it would be too late. For ten minutes or more not  a word was spoken. With straining arms and labouring chests, the  rowers tugged at the oars, their eyes fixed on the lurid mass they were  leaving. Frere and Best, with their faces turned back to the terror  they fled from, urged the men to greater efforts. Already the flames had  lapped the flag, already the outlines of the stern carvings were blurred  by the fire.    Another moment, and all would be over. Ah! it had come at last. A dull  rumbling sound; the burning ship parted asunder; a pillar of fire,  flecked with black masses that were beams and planks, rose up out of  the ocean; there was a terrific crash, as though sea and sky were coming  together; and then a mighty mountain of water rose, advanced, caught,  and passed them, and they were alone--deafened, stunned, and breathless,  in a sudden horror of thickest darkness, and a silence like that of the  tomb.    The splashing of the falling fragments awoke them from their stupor, and  then the blue light of the Malabar struck out a bright pathway across  the sea, and they knew that they were safe.                *          *          *          *          *      On board the Malabar two men paced the deck, waiting for dawn.    It came at last. The sky lightened, the mist melted away, and then a  long, low, far-off streak of pale yellow light floated on the eastern  horizon. By and by the water sparkled, and the sea changed colour,  turning from black to yellow, and from yellow to lucid green. The man at  the masthead hailed the deck. The boats were in sight, and as they came  towards the ship, the bright water flashing from the labouring oars, a  crowd of spectators hanging over the bulwarks cheered and waved their  hats.    \"Not a soul!\" cried Blunt. \"No one but themselves. Well, I'm glad  they're safe anyway.\"    The boats drew alongside, and in a few seconds Frere was upon deck.    \"Well, Mr. Frere?\"    \"No use,\" cried Frere, shivering. \"We only just had time to get away.  The nearest thing in the world, sir.\"    \"Didn't you see anyone?\"    \"Not a soul. They must have taken to the boats.\"    \"Then they can't be far off,\" cried Blunt, sweeping the horizon with his  glass. \"They must have pulled all the way, for there hasn't been enough  wind to fill a hollow tooth with.\" \"Perhaps they pulled in the wrong  direction,\" said Frere. \"They had a good four hours' start of us, you  know.\"    Then Best came up, and told the story to a crowd of eager listeners. The  sailors having hoisted and secured the boats, were hurried off to the  forecastle, there to eat, and relate their experience between mouthfuls,  and the four convicts were taken in charge and locked below again.    \"You had better go and turn in, Frere,\" said Pine gruffly. \"It's no use  whistling for a wind here all day.\"    Frere laughed--in his heartiest manner. \"I think I will,\" he said. \"I'm  dog tired, and as sleepy as an owl,\" and he descended the poop ladder.  Pine took a couple of turns up and down the deck, and then catching  Blunt's eye, stopped in front of Vickers.    \"You may think it a hard thing to say, Captain Vickers, but it's just  as well if we don't find these poor devils. We have quite enough on our  hands as it is.\"    \"What do you mean, Mr. Pine?\" says Vickers, his humane feelings getting  the better of his pomposity. \"You would not surely leave the unhappy men  to their fate.\"    \"Perhaps,\" returned the other, \"they would not thank us for taking them  aboard.\"    \"I don't understand you.\"    \"The fever has broken out.\"    Vickers raised his brows. He had no experience of such things; and  though the intelligence was startling, the crowded condition of the  prison rendered it easy to be understood, and he apprehended no danger  to himself.    \"It is a great misfortune; but, of course, you will take such steps--\"    \"It is only in the prison, as yet,\" says Pine, with a grim emphasis on  the word; \"but there is no saying how long it may stop there. I have got  three men down as it is.\" \"Well, sir, all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34259"],[0,"Hunting Dogs (#10)"],[1," well  furnished thighs.    Dogs with straight hind legs cannot run and jump over logs and fences  with the same ease as those having a marked bend. These dogs can  buckle and unbuckle with more quickness and power, such as is  required in the gallop than dogs having a round barrel shaped chest,  with both the front and hind legs straight. Dogs having a nearly  round chest cannot stand any length of hard running, such as those  having a narrow chest because a dog with a moderate deep and narrow  chest has better wind as he is able to alter the cubic contents of  his chest more rapidly and thus inhale and expire a larger volume of  air. Therefore, a dog with a deep or flat chest will always have a  greater speed than one with a round one. This is a well known fact in  all animals remarkable for their speed, such as deer, wolf and  greyhound.    I like dogs with good muscular thighs with a fine long tapering and  graceful wavering stern, ears to be well set and not too long and not  thick and slabby, neck to be long and well set between the shoulders,  the head and muzzle, this is only a matter of taste. Those I prefer  are those having a long and narrow forehead and a fairly square  muzzle, ears from 7 to 9 inches long, lips loose but not hanging low,  throat loose and roomy in the skin and a good coat of hair so they  can stand cold and water, and with a good loud tongue and keen nose.  The color has nothing to do, the main point is the staying quality,  the speed, scent and endurance; the intelligence and the particular  style of ranging or beating the ground for trail as well as to run it  once found, with great speed.    Some say a fine looking hound should be a good hunter. Well, any  hunter of experience in the handling of hounds is fully aware that it  is not always the dog which carries the prizes at the shows that is  the best dog in the field. The same thing exists with the horse. Some  people claim that it all depends on the breeding, others on the  training. The fact is that both are required as well as the right  shape the dog should have to be able to stand hard work day after  day.      * * *    The most essential thing to the value and working capabilities of fox  hounds is purity of blood, declares another. Too much care,  therefore, cannot be taken in selecting and breeding fox hounds.  Hounds for running the red fox should be selected from the best  possible blood that can be obtained. I like a hound with a long clear  voice--one that can be heard at least two miles away on an ordinary  calm day--and one that gives tongue freely when running and trailing  but not one that gives tongue when he has run over the trail and lost  scent.      * * *    In selecting a night hunting dog I prefer one that is three-quarters  or at least one-half fox hound. The reason is, the fox hound has a  good nose, also a good voice and speed. While I do not condemn a dog  that is bred in any other way, I prefer one bred as I have stated for  the reasons given above.    Some prefer a dog that is part beagle, but if any reader of this book  has ever tried to train a dog with good beagle blood in his veins to  hunt coon, he has been up against the real thing. The trouble is, the  beagle has it bred right in him to run rabbits, and blood will tell.  The only point in favor of the beagle is his nose. With the exception  of the bird dog the beagle has the finest scent of the whole dog  family. I know this to be true by observation. A fox gives off more  scent than a rabbit, so does a coon and all the other animals.    During the \"nesting season\" birds give scarcely any. This is a wise  provision of Nature to protect them from their enemies during this  important period.    One day I saw a fine English setter almost step on a grouse that was  sitting on her nest. He never scented her until she went whirling out  the ridge right in front of his nose. That dog's actions told more  plainly than words could have done, how deeply he regretted the  incident. I have also seen a beagle run a rabbit after a heavy rain,  the rabbit, to my knowledge, having run before the rain fell.      * * *    Many writers say that a dog's pedigree and his being registered, does  not amount to the paper it is written on. Now I do not wish to  criticize any of my brother sportsmen, but I think it is the only way  to know if one's dog is well bred, and to have a well bred dog means  much less trouble in training him. Do not get discouraged if your dog  does not train as easily as he should, and always remember that much  depends upon you. Stay with your dog if you want him to be a good  sticker. Many a dog has been spoiled by leaving him to run for  nothing.    In selecting a dog to hunt all kinds of game, get a good bred hound.  I have no use for mongrels or curs. They are dear at any price. Get a  thick, hard, round-footed, long ears coming out of head low down,  well developed chest, shortish tail, large at root or next to body,  long from hip to gamble joint, with broad strong back, wide nostrils  and long pendant lip. Now this is my idea of a good all around  hunting dog. I don't expect you to find all of these qualifications  in any one dog.      * * *    Have decided that for my use, a full blooded hound. That is a good,  fast and reliable trailer, one that will stay with the trail, cold or  hot, and never think of giving up until asked to. One that will bark  treed on a cold trail just the same as if he had run him up a sight  chase. One that should he in cold trailing run across a hot trail and  tree, will after catching go and take up cold trail again and tree.      * * *    When it comes to large hounds for coon, fox, etc., a cross of the  right kind of American fox hounds and the right kind of blood hounds  fills the bill to perfection. The blood hound has the keenest scent  of any dog living. The American fox hound has the speed. If a man has  a combination of the two he is starting on the right trail. I prefer  a fox hound bitch bred to bloodhound dog. How many ever saw a  thoroughbred bloodhound? They are a heavy built hound, medium size  heavy head, long ears, square deep muzzle, with heavy rolls of  wrinkles on head just over the eyes, which gives him a surly look. I  have seen what were called and sold for bloodhounds to a sheriff to  trail man. They would trail fairly well, but they came a long ways  from being thoroughbred bloodhounds. Any hound trained when young can  be taught to trail man or beast.    Hunters differ as to the kind of dog to use for coon hunting. The  best coon dog I ever had (and I've had a good many) was a half Scotch  terrier and I don't know what the other half was. He was black and  white spotted with curly hair and weighed but thirty-two pounds.    Some hunters prefer the shepherd dog and again some would hunt with  nothing else but a hound. I don't know as it makes much difference  what kind of a dog one uses, just so it is one of the hunting kind, a  good trailer and thoroughly well trained. Of course, not every dog,  even of the hunting kind, will make a good coon dog; about the only  way to tell is to try.      * * *    As to picking a pup for a coon hound, it is very hard to do, but I  want a full bloodhound, one that tongues on trail and a free barker  at tree. I want the old style hound, as the modern fox hounds are too  nervous for good coon hounds, although you may get one once in a  while that will work a cold trail very well.    A cross between the old style, long eared hound and the fast trailing  hound with large, heavy shoulders, deep chest, a large fore leg,  large broad head, long ears, rather short coupled back, slightly  roached back, with a good square nose, rather large neck, set well  down in the shoulders. While this is my kind of hound for coon, do  not understand me to say that I want an extra slow trailer, for I do  not, but I want him to be steady, and when he has a trail he can work  it fast. This is my kind of a dog for coon, but he would not be in it  with an up to date fox hound on a fox chase, but running fox and coon  are different, and I want a different kind of a hound.      * * *    We have made a success in raising bear hounds, and find the only way  to get a good pup with the hunting habit, is to have it bred in them  first, says a California Brother. One has to have good parent hounds,  and while the mother dog is carrying the pups she must be worked on  whatever you want your pups to run. For instance, we have a black and  tan long eared bitch, bred her to a good hound, one quarter stag.  Before she had these puppies we caught three bears with others,  letting her get in and fight hard.    These puppies when a month old would crawl on a bear hide rug, chew  and shake at it, and when three months old, would track, bark and  fight. Now they are five months old and know considerable about it.  We treed an old bear, and these pups kept right on and treed two  cubs, and barked up and stayed until we found them after we had the  old one skinned and cut up. They have the instinct in them, and are  beauties with just enough stag in them to have a good crop of  whiskers.      [Illustration: Embryo Trailers.]        CHAPTER XII.    CARE AND BREEDING.    As we must raise the dog before concerning ourselves with his  culture, let us begin with the pup.    I commence to care for the pups by giving the bitch plenty of  exercise before they are born. Then as soon as they are born, put  them in a clean, dry place, where they will be comfortable,--if in  winter, where cold winds cannot reach them; if in summer, in a cool  place out of the hot sun. Feed the bitch well on good food of  different varieties; do not chain her, but rather shut her up in a  park of something of the kind, where she can exercise but not get out  to run, for if she should run she gets hot and you may loose some if  not all of your puppies.    By the time the pups are three weeks old, you will need to"]]]
