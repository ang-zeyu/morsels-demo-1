This formidable apparition we  afterwards discovered to have been a bat, and the bats here must be  acknowledged to have a frightful appearance, for they are nearly black,  and full as large as a partridge; they have indeed no horns, but the  fancy of a man who thought he saw the devil might easily supply that  defect.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Having seen some of the very curious fox-bats alive, and given some  condensed information about them in Dr Hamilton's series of volumes  called \"Excelsior,\" the writer may extract the account, with some slight  additions, especially as the article is illustrated with a truly  admirable figure of a fox-bat, from a living specimen by Mr Wolf. In Sir  Emerson Tennent's \"Sketches of the Natural History of Ceylon,\" p. 14, Mr  Wolf has represented a whole colony of the \"flying-foxes,\" as they are  called.    [Illustration: Flying Fox. (Pteropus ruficollis.)]      FOX-BATS (_Pteropus_).    In this country that bat is deemed a large one whose wings, when  measured from tip to tip, exceed twelve inches, or whose body is above  that of a small mouse in bulk. In some parts of the world, however,  there are members of this well-marked family, the wings of which, when  stretched and measured from one extremity to the other, are five feet  and upwards in extent, and their bodies large in proportion. These are  the fox-bats, a pair of which were lately procured for the Zoological  Gardens. It is from one of this pair that the very characteristic figure  of Mr Wolf has been derived.[24] There is something very odd in the  appearance of such an animal, suspended as it is during the day head  downwards, in a position the very sight of which suggests to the  looker-on ideas of nightmare and apoplexy. As the head peers out from  the membrane, contracted about the body and investing it as in a bag,  and the strange creature chews a piece of apple presented by its keeper,  the least curious observer must be struck with the peculiarity of the  position, and cannot fail to admire the velvety softness and great  elasticity of the membrane which forms its wings. It must have been from  an exaggerated account of the fox-bats of the Eastern Islands that the  ancients derived their ideas of the dreaded Harpies, those fabulous  winged monsters sent out by the relentless Juno, and whose names are  synonymous with rapine and cruelty.    Some of these bats, before they were thoroughly known, frightened  British sailors not a little when they met with them. We have given an  anecdote, illustrative of this, in a preceding page.    Dr Forster, who accompanied Captain Cook on the voyage round the world  from 1772 to 1775, observed fox-bats at the Friendly Islands, where they  were seen in large groups of hundreds. Our traveller even notices that  some of them flew about the whole day, doubtless from being disturbed by  the wandering crews of the British discovery ships. He saw a Casuarina  tree of large size, the branches of which were festooned with at least  five hundred of these pendent Cheiroptera in various attitudes of ease,  according to the habits and notions of the bat tribes, who can hang  either by the hind or by the fore-feet. He noticed that they skimmed  over the water with wonderful facility, and he saw one in the act of  swimming, though he cannot say that it did so with either ease or  expertness; they are known, however, to frequent the water in order to  wash themselves from any impurities on their fur and wings, as well as  to get rid of the vermin which may be infesting them.    Captain Lort Stokes found the red-necked species to be very abundant,  during his survey of the north coast of Australia in H.M.S. _Beagle_. As  the boats were engaged in the survey, flights of these bats kept  hovering over them, uttering a disagreeable screeching noise and filling  the air with a faint mildewy odour, far from agreeable to the smell. The  sailors gave these bats the name of \"monkey-birds,\" without being aware  that naturalists in their system consider them as following closely the  order which contains these four-handed lovers of trees. Captain Stokes  observes that the leathern wings have a singular heavy flap, and that a  flight of bats would suddenly alight on a bamboo and bend it to the  ground with their weight. Each individual struggles on alighting to  settle on the same spot, and like rooks or men in similar circumstances,  they do not succeed in fixing themselves without making a great deal of  noise. When first they clung to the bamboo, they did so by means of the  claw on the outer edge of the flying membrane, and then they gradually  settled.    Among the wild and varied scenery of those groups of islands called the  Friendly Islands, the Feejees, and the Navigators, species of fox-bat  form one of the characteristics of the place to the observant eye;  while, if the traveller should happen to be blind, their presence among  the otherwise fragrant forests would be readily perceived from the  strong odour which taints the atmosphere, and which, says the Naturalist  of the United States Exploring Expedition, \"will always be remembered by  persons who have visited the regions inhabited by these animals.\" Mr  Titian Peale mentions that a specimen of the fox-bat was kept in  Philadelphia for several years; and like most creatures, winged as well  as wingless, was amiable to those persons who were constantly near it,  while it showed clearly and unmistakably its dislike to strangers.    On its voyage, this strange passenger was fed on boiled rice, sweetened  with sugar; while at the Museum, it was solaced and fed during its  captivity chiefly on fruit, and now and then appeared to enjoy the  picking from the bones of a boiled fowl. The fox-bat is but seldom  brought alive to this country. The late Mr Cross of the Surrey  Zoological Gardens kept one for a short time, and deemed it one of his  greatest rarities; and, till the arrival lately of the pair alluded to  at the Gardens in the Regent's Park, we have not heard of other  specimens having been exhibited in this country. They are difficult to  keep, and seem to feel very sensibly the changes of our climate, while  it is a hard thing to get for them the food on which they live when in a  state of liberty.    Mr Macgillivray discovered a new species of fox-bat on Fitzroy Island,  off the coast of Australia, when he was naturalist of H.M.S.  _Rattlesnake_.[25] He fell in with this large fruit-eating bat  (_Pteropus conspicillatus_) on the wooded slope of a hill. They were in  prodigious numbers, and presented the appearance, as they flew along in  the bright sunshine, of a large flock of rooks. As they were approached,  a strong musky odour became apparent, and a loud incessant chattering  was heard. He describes the branches of some of the trees as bending  beneath the loads of bats which clung to them. Some of these were in a  state of inactivity, sleeping or composing themselves to sleep, while  many specimens scrambled along among the boughs and took to flight on  being disturbed. He shot several specimens, three or four at a time, as  they hung in clusters. Unless they were killed outright, they continued  suspended for some time; when wounded they are difficult to handle, as  they bite severely, and at such times their cry resembles somewhat the  squalling of a child. The flesh of these bats is described to be  excellent, and no wonder, when they feed on the sweetest fruits; the  natives regard it as nutritious food, and travellers in Australia, like  the adventurous Leichhardt on his journey to Port Essington, sometimes  are furnished with a welcome meal from the fruit-eating fox-bats which  fall in their way. Even the polished French, in the Isle of Bourbon, as  they used to call the Mauritius, sometimes stewed a Pteropus, in their  _bouillon_ or broth to give it a relish.    Travellers observe that in a state of nature the fox-bats only eat the  ripest and the best fruit, and in their search for it they climb with  great facility along the under side of the branches. In Java, as Dr  Horsfield observes, these creatures, from their numbers and fruit-eating  propensities, occasion incalculable mischief, as they attack every kind  that grows there, from the cocoa-nut to the rarer and more delicate  productions, which are cultivated with care in the gardens of princes  and persons of rank. The doctor observes, that \"delicate fruits, as they  approach to maturity, are ingeniously secured by means of a loose net or  basket, skilfully constructed of split bamboo. Without this precaution  little valuable fruit would escape the ravages of the kalong.\"    We have mentioned that the fox-bats are occasionally eaten in Australia.  Colonel Sykes alludes to the native Portuguese in Western India eating  the flesh of another species of Pteropus; and it would seem that but for  prejudice, their flesh, like that of the young of the South American  monkeys, is extremely delicate; the colonel says, writing of the  _Pteropus medius_, a species found in India, \"I can personally testify  that their flesh is delicate and without disagreeable flavour.\"    The Javanese fox-bat occasionally affords amusement to the colonists as  well as natives, who chase it, according to Dr Horsfield, \"during the  moonlight nights, which, in the latitude of Java, are uncommonly serene.  He is watched in his descent to the fruit-trees, and a discharge of  small shot readily brings him to the ground. By this means I frequently  obtained four or five individuals in the course of an hour.\" The natives  of New Caledonia, according to Dr Forster, use the hair of these great  bats in ropes, and in the tassels to their clubs, while they interweave  the hair among the threads of the _Cyperus squarrosus_, a grassy-looking  plant"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25973"],[0,"Birds of the Rockies (#10)"],[1,"lakes, but are more  disposed to take up their residence in inland and comparatively dry  regions. There are several varieties, all bearing a very close  resemblance, so close, indeed, that only an expert ornithologist can  distinguish them, even with the birds in hand. The common horned lark is  well known in the eastern part of the United States as a winter  resident, while in the middle West, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, etc.,  are to be found the prairie horned larks, which, as their name  indicates, choose the open prairie for their home. The desert horned  larks are tenants exclusively of the arid plains, mesas, and mountain  parks of the West. There is still another variety, called the pallid  horned lark, which spends the winter in Colorado, then hies himself  farther north in summer to rear his brood.    As I pursued my walk, one of these birds suddenly assumed an alert  attitude, then darted into the air, mounting up, up, up, in a series of  swift leaps, like \"an embodied joy whose race has just begun.\" Up he  soared until he could no longer be seen with the naked eye, and even  through my field-glass he was a mere speck against the blue canopy, and  yet, high as he had gone, his ditty filtered down to me through the  still, rarefied atmosphere, like a sifting of fine sand. His descent was  a grand plunge, made with the swiftness of an Indian's arrow, his head  bent downward, his wings partly folded, and his tail perked upward at  precisely the proper angle to make a rudder, all the various organs so  finely adjusted as to convert him into a perfectly dirigible parachute.  Swift as his descent was, he alighted on the ground as lightly as a tuft  of down. It was the poetry of motion. One or two writers have insisted  that the horned lark's empyrean song compares favorably with that of  the European skylark; but, loyal and patriotic an American as we are,  honesty compels us to concede that our bird's voice is much feebler and  less musical than that of his celebrated relative across the sea. It  sounds like the unmelodious clicking of pebbles, while the song of the  skylark is loud, clear, and ringing.    Our birds of the plain find insects to their taste in the short grass  which carpets the land with greenish or olive gray. The following  morning a mother lark was seen gathering insects and holding them in her  bill--a sure sign of fledglings in the near neighborhood. I decided to  watch her, and, if possible, find her bantlings. It required not a  little patience, for she was wary and the sun poured down a flood of  almost blistering heat. This way and that she scurried over the ground,  now picking up an insect and adding it to the store already in her bill,  and now standing almost erect to eye me narrowly and with some  suspicion. At length she seemed to settle down for a moment upon a  particular spot, and when I looked again with my glass, her beak was  empty. I examined every inch of ground, as I thought, in the  neighborhood of the place where she had stopped, but could find neither  nest nor nestlings.    Again I turned my attention to the mother bird, which meanwhile had  gathered another bunch of insects and was hopping about with them  through the croppy grass, now and then adding to her accumulation until  her mouth was full. For a long time she zigzagged about, going by  provoking fits and starts. At length fortune favored me, for through my  levelled glass I suddenly caught sight of a small, grayish-looking ball  hopping and tumbling from a cactus clump toward the mother bird, who  jabbed the contents of her bill into a small, open mouth. I followed a  bee-line to the spot, and actually had to scan the ground sharply for a  few moments before I could distinguish the youngster from its  surroundings, for it had squatted flat, its gray and white plumage  harmonizing perfectly with the grayish desert grass.    [Illustration: _Lark_    \"_It was a dear little thing_\"]    It was a dear little thing, and did not try to escape, although I took  it up in my hand and stroked its downy back again and again. Sometimes  it closed its eyes as if it were sleepy. When I placed it on the ground,  it hopped away a few inches, and by accident punctured the fleshy corner  of its mouth with a sharp cactus thorn, and had to jerk itself loose,  bringing the blood from the lacerated part. Meanwhile the mother lark  went calmly about her household duties, merely keeping a watchful eye  on the human meddler, and making no outcry when she saw her infant in my  possession. I may have been _persona non grata_, but, if so, she did not  express her feeling. This was the youngest horned lark seen by me in my  rambles on the plains.    Perhaps the reader will care to know something about the winter habits  of these birds. They do not spend the season of cold and storm in the  mountains, not even those that breed there, for the snow is very deep  and the tempests especially fierce. Many of them, however, remain in the  foothills and on the mesas and plains, where they find plenty of seeds  and berries for their sustenance, unless the weather chances to be  unusually severe. One winter, not long ago, the snow continued to lie  much longer than usual, cutting off the natural food supply of the  larks. What regimen did they adopt in that exigency? They simply went to  town. Many of the kindly disposed citizens of Colorado Springs scattered  crumbs and millet seeds on the streets and lawns, and of this supply the  little visitors ate greedily, becoming quite tame. As soon, however, as  the snow disappeared they took their departure, not even stopping to say  thanks or adieu; although we may take it for granted that they felt  grateful for favors bestowed.    Besides the horned larks, many other birds were found on the plain. Next  in abundance were the western meadow-larks. Persons who live in the  East and are familiar with the songs of the common meadow-lark, should  hear the vocal performances of the westerners. The first time I heard  one of them, the minstrelsy was so strange to my ear, so different from  anything I had ever heard, I was thrown into an ecstasy of delight, and  could not imagine from what kind of bird larynx so quaint a medley could  emanate. The song opened with a loud, fine, piercing whistle, and ended  with an abrupt staccato gurgle much lower in the musical staff, sounding  precisely as if the soloist's performance had been suddenly choked off  by the rising of water in the windpipe. It was something after the order  of the purple martin's melodious sputter, only the tones were richer and  fuller and the music better defined, as became a genuine oscine. His  sudden and emphatic cessation seemed to indicate that he was in a  petulant mood, perhaps impatient with the intruder, or angry with a  rival songster.    Afterwards I heard him--or, rather, one of his brothers--sing arias so  surpassingly sweet that I voted him the master minstrel of the western  plains, prairies, and meadows. One evening as I was returning to  Colorado Springs from a long tramp through one of the canyons of the  mountains, a western meadow-lark sat on a small tree and sang six  different tunes within the space of a few minutes. Two of them were so  exquisite and unique that I involuntarily sprang to my feet with a cry  of delight. There he sat in the lengthening shadows of Cheyenne  Mountain, the champion phrase-fluter of the irrigated meadow in which he  and a number of his comrades had found a summer home.    On the plain, at the time of my visit, the meadow-larks were not quite  so tuneful, for here the seasons are somewhat earlier than in the  proximity of the mountains, and the time of courtship and incubation was  over. Still, they sang enough to prove themselves members of a gifted  musical family. Observers in the East will remember the sputtering call  of the eastern larks when they are alarmed or their suspicions are  aroused. The western larks do not utter alarums of that kind, but a  harsh \"chack\" instead, very similar to the call of the grackles. The  nesting habits of the eastern and western species are the same, their  domiciles being placed on the ground amid the grass, often prettily  arched over in the rear and made snug and neat.    It must not be thought, because my monograph on the western larks is  included in this chapter, that they dwell exclusively on the arid plain.  No; they revel likewise in the areas of verdure bordering the streams,  in the irrigated fields and meadows, and in the watered portions of the  upper mountain parks.    An interesting question is the following: Are the eastern and western  meadow-larks distinct species, or only varieties somewhat specialized by  differences of locality and environment? It is a problem over which the  scientific professors have had not a little disputation. My own opinion  is that they are distinct species and do not cohabit, and the conviction  is based on some special investigations, though not of the kind that are  made with the birds in hand. It has been my privilege to study both  forms in the field. In the first place, their vocal exhibitions are very  different, so much so as to indicate a marked diversity in the organic  structure of their larynxes. Much as I have listened to their  minstrelsy, I have never known one kind to borrow from the musical  repertory of the other. True, there are strains in the arias of the  westerners that closely resemble the clear, liquid whistle of the  eastern larks, but they occur right in the midst of the song and are  part and parcel of it, and therefore afford no evidence of mimicry or  amalgamation. Even the trills of the grassfinch and the song-sparrow  have points of similarity; does that prove that they borrow from each  other, or that espousals sometimes occur between the two species?    The habiliments of the two forms of larks are more divergent than would  appear at first blush. Above, the coloration "]]]
