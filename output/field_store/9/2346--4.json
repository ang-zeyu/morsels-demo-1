That all his Majesties Subjects in a matter so important; as is  the publik Confession of Faith, so solemnely sworn and subscribed, may be  of one minde, and one heart, and have full satisfaction to all their  doubts, and that the posteritie afterward may be fully perswaded of the  true meaning thereof, after earnest calling upon the name of God, so  religiously attested in the said Confession; have entered into a diligent  search of the registers of the Kirk, and books of the generall Assembly,  which the greatest part of the Assembly had not seen before; and which by  the speciall providence of God were preserved, brought to their hands, and  publicly acknowledged to bee authentick, and have found that in the latter  confession of the Kirk of _Scotland_: We profess, _that we deteste all  traditions brought into the Kirk without, or against the word of God, and  doctrine of this reformed Kirk_: Next, _we abhorre and deteste all  contrarie religion and doctrine_, but chiefly, _All kinds of papistry in  generall & particular heads, as they were then damned & confuted by the  word of God, and Kirk of_ Scotland, _when the said Confession was sworn  and subscribed_, An. 1580. _and_ 1581, 1590, _and_ 1591. Thirdly, _that we  deteste the Romane Antichrist, his worldly monarchie, and wicked  hierarchie_: Fourthly, _that we joyn our selves to this reformed Kirk in  doctrine, Faith, Religion, & discipline, promising and swearing by the  great name of_ GOD, _that we shall continue in the Doctrine and Discipline  of this Kirk, and defend the same according to our vocation and power all  the dayes of our life_.    But so it is that Episcopall government is abhorred and detested, and the  government by Ministers and Elders, in Assemblies generall and  provinciall, and Presbyteries was sworn to, and subscribed in subscribing  that Confession, and ought to be holden by us, if we adhere to the meaning  of the Kirk, when that Confession was framed, sworn to, and subscribed;  unto which we are obliged by the nationall oath and subscription of this  Kirk, as is evident by the acts of generall Assemblies, agreed upon both  before, at, and after the swearing and subscribing of the said Confession,  in the years above-mentioned, and the book of policie agreed upon in the  Assembly which was holden at _Edinburgh_ the twentie foure of _April_, and  twentie foure of _October_, _Anno_ 1578. Insert in the register of the  Kirk, by ordinance of the Assembly holden at _Glasgow_ 1581 and to be  subscribed by all Ministers, that then did bear, or thereafter were to  bear office in this Kirk, by ordinance of the Assembly holden the fourth  of _August_ at _Edinburgh_ 1590. And at _Edinburgh_ the second of _July_  1591. but specially in the 2. 3. 4. 6. 7. and 11, chapters of the said  book.    The Bishops being tollerat from the year 1572, till the Assembly holden in  _August_ 1575. And all this time the Assembly being wearied with  complaints made against them, did enter in search of the office it selfe,  and did agree in this that the name of a Bishop is common to every one of  them that hath a particular flock, over which he hath a particular charge,  as well to preach the word, as to minister the Sacraments.    At the next Assembly which was holden in _April_ 1576. Such Bishops were  censured as had not taken them to a particular flock. In the generall  Assembly conveened in _April_ the year of God 1578. Sess. 4. Intimation  was made as followeth.    _For so much as the heads of the policie being concluded and agreed upon  in the last Assembly, by the most part of the brethren: certain of the  brethren had some difficultie in the head_ de diaconatu, _whereupon  farther reasoning was reserved to this Assembly: It is therefore required,  if any of the brethren have any reasonable doubt or argument to propone,  that he be ready the morow, and then shall be heard and resolved_. In the  6. Sess. _April_ 26. According to the ordinance made the day before; all  persons that had any doubt or argument to propone, were required to  propone the same; but none offered to propone any argument on the  contrare.    In the Assembly holden at _Edinburgh_, in _October_ 1578. It was showen by  the Moderatour thereof to the noble-men, who were present, viz. _My Lord  Chancelour_, the Earle of _Montrose_, my Lord _Seaton_, and my Lord  _Lindsay_, _What care and study the Assembly had taken to entertain and  keep the puritie of the sincere word of God, unmixed with the inventions  of their own heads, and to preserve it to the posteritie hereafter, and  seeing that the true Religion is not able to continue nor endure long  without a good __ Discipline and policie, in that part also have they  imployed their wit and studie, and drawen forth out of the pure fountain  of Gods word, to bee a Discipline as is meet to remain in the Kirk_.    In the same Assembly, the speciall corruptions were set down, which they  craved such of the Bishops as would submit themselves to the Assembly to  remove, with promise, that if the generall Assembly, hereafter shall finde  further corruptions in the said estate, then hitherto are expressed that  they be content to be reformed by the said Assembly according to the word  of God, when they shall be required thereto. First, _That they be content  to bee Pastours and Ministers of one flock: That they usurpe no criminall  jurisdiction, that they vote not in Parliament in name of the Kirk,  without Commission from the Kirk: That they take not up for the  maintenance of their ambition and rictousnesse, the emoluments of the  Kirk, which may sustain many Pastours, the Schools, and the poore; but be  content with reasonable livings according to their office: That they  claime not to themselves the titles of Lords temporall, neither usurpe  temporall jurisdictions, whereby they are abstracted from their office:  That they empyre not above the particular Elderships, but be subject to  the same: That they usurpe not the power of the Presbyteries._    The question being proponed by the Synod at _Loutbian_ in the Assembly  holden in _July_ 1579. anent a generall order to be taken for erecting of  Presbyteries in places where publick exercise is used, untill the time the  policie of the Kirk be established by a law: It is answered, _The exercise  may be judged to be a Presbyterie._ In the Assembly holden at _Dundie_ in  _July_ 1580. Sess. 4, The office of a Bishop was abolished by a particular  act; as appeareth by the tennour of the act following.          _For so much as the office of a Bishop, as it is now used and      commonly taken withen this Realme, hath no sure warrand      authoritie, nor good ground in the Scriptures, but is brought in      by the foly and corruption of mans inventions, to the great      overthrow of the Kirk of God, the whole Assembly of the Kirk in      one voice after libertie given to all men to reason in the matter,      none opponing himself in defending the said pretended office,      findeth and declareth the said pretended office, used and termed,      as is above said, unlawfull in the selfe, as having neither      foundament, ground, nor warrand in the word of God, and ordaineth      that all such persons, __ as brook or shall brook hereafter the      said office, shall be charged simply to dimit, quite, and leave      off the same, as an office whereunto they are not called of God:      and suchlike, to desist and cease from all preaching, ministration      of the Sacraments, or using any way the office of pastours, while      they receive_ de novo, _admission from the generall Assembly,      under the pain of excommunication to be used against them, wherein      if they be found disobedient, or contradict this act in any point,      the sentence of excommunication, after due admonition, to be      execute against them._      In the same Assembly holden _Anno_ 1580. Sess. 10. This article was  appointed to be proponed to the King and Councel, that the book of policie  might be established by an act of privie Councel, _while a Parliament be  holden, at which it might be confirmed by a law_.    The extent of the act made at _Dundie_, was interpreted and explained in  the Assembly, holden at _Glasgow_, in _April_, 1581. Sess. 6. as  followeth.          _Anent the Act made in the Assembly holden at_ Dundie _against      Bishops, because some difficultie appeareth to some brethren to      arise out of the word_ (office) _contained in the said act, what      should be meaned thereby, The Assembly consisting for the most      part of such as voted, and were present in the Assembly at_      Dundie, _to take away the said difficultie, resolving upon the      true meaning and understanding of the said act, declare that they      meaned wholly to condemne the whole estate of Bishops, as they are      now in_ Scotland, _and that the same was the determination and      conclusion of the Assembly at this time, because some brethren      doubted, whether the former act was to be understood of the_      spiritual function _only, and others alledged, that the_ whole      office of a Bishop _as it was used, was damnable, and that by the      said act, the Bishops should be charged to dimit the same: This      Assembly declareth that they meaned wholly to condemne the whole      estate of Bishops, as they were then in_ Scotland, _and that this      was the meaning of the Assembly, at that time_.      The Kings _Commissioner_ presented to this Assembly the Confession of  Faith, subscribed by the King, and his houshold, not long before, together  with a plot of the Presbyteries to be erected, which is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2897"],[0,"The Sequel of Appomattox: A Chronicle of the Reunion of the States (#10)"],[1,"in running the Government!\" To which Johnson  replied: \"Treason is a crime and crime must be punished. Treason must  be made infamous and traitors must be impoverished.\" These words are  an index to the speeches of Johnson during 1863-65. Even his radical  friends feared that he would be too vindictive. For a few weeks he was  much inclined to the radical plans, and some of the leaders certainly  understood that he was in favor of Negro suffrage, the supreme test  of radicalism. But when the excitement caused by the assassination of  Lincoln and the break-up of the Confederacy had moderated somewhat,  Johnson saw before him a task so great that his desire for violent  measures was chilled. He must disband the great armies and bring all war  work to an end; he must restore intercourse with the South, which had  been blockaded for years; he must for a time police the country, look  after the Negroes, and set up a temporary civil government; and finally  he must work out a restoration of the Union. Sobered by responsibility  and by the influence of moderate advisers, he rather quickly adopted  Lincoln's policy. Johnson at first set his face against the movements  toward reconstruction by the state governments already organized and  by those people who wished to organize new governments on Lincoln's ten  percent plan. As soon as possible the War Department notified the Union  commanders to stop all attempts at reconstruction and to pursue and  arrest all Confederate governors and other prominent civil leaders. The  President was even anxious to arrest the military leaders who had been  paroled but was checked in this desire by General Grant's firm protest.  His cabinet advisers supported Johnson in refusing to recognize the  Southern state governments; but three of them--Seward, Welles, and  McCulloch--were influential in moderating his zeal for inflicting  punishments. Nevertheless, he soon had in prison the most prominent of  the Confederate civilians and several general officers. The soldiers,  however, were sent home, trade with the South was permitted, and the  Freedmen's Bureau was rapidly extended.    Previous to this Johnson had brought himself to recognize, early in  May, the Lincoln \"ten percent\" governments of Louisiana, Tennessee, and  Arkansas, and the reconstructed Alexandria government of Virginia. Thus  only seven states were left without legal governments, and to bring  those states back into the Union, Johnson inaugurated on May 29, 1865,  a plan which was like that of Lincoln but not quite so liberal. In his  Amnesty Proclamation, Johnson made a longer list of exceptions aimed  especially at the once wealthy slave owners. On the same day he  proclaimed the restoration of North Carolina. A provisional governor, W.  W. Holden, was appointed and directed to reorganize the civil government  and to call a constitutional convention elected by those who had taken  the amnesty oath. This convention was to make necessary amendments  to the constitution and to \"restore said State to its constitutional  relations to the Federal Government.\" It is to be noted that Johnson  fixed the qualifications of delegates and of those who elected them,  but, this stage once passed, the convention or the legislature would  \"prescribe the qualifications of electors... a power the people of the  several States composing the Federal Union have rightfully exercised  from the origin of the government to the present time.\" The President  also directed the various cabinet officers to extend the work of their  departments over the Confederate States and ordered the army officers  to assist the civil authorities. During the next six weeks, similar  measures were undertaken for the remaining six states of the  Confederacy.    To set up the new order, army officers were first sent into every county  to administer the amnesty oath and thus to secure a \"loyal\" electorate.  In each state the provisional governor organized out of the remains of  the Confederate local regime a new civil government. Confederate local  officials who could and would take the amnesty oath were directed to  resume office until relieved; the laws of 1861, except those relating to  slavery, were declared to be in force; the courts were directed to  use special efforts to crush lawlessness; and the old jury lists were  destroyed and new ones were drawn up containing only the names of those  who had taken the amnesty oath. Since there was no money in any state  treasury, small sums were now raised by license taxes. A full staff  of department heads was appointed, and by July 1865, the provisional  governments were in fair working order.    To the constitutional conventions, which met in the fall, it was made  clear, through the governors, that the President would insist upon three  conditions: the formal abolition of slavery, the repudiation of the  ordinance of secession, and the repudiation of the Confederate war debt.  To Governor Holden he telegraphed: \"Every dollar of the debt created to  aid the rebellion against the United States should be repudiated finally  and forever. The great mass of the people should not be taxed to pay a  debt to aid in carrying on a rebellion which they in fact, if left to  themselves, were opposed to. Let those who had given their means for the  obligations of the state look to that power they tried to establish in  violation of law, constitution, and will of the people. They must meet  their fate.\" With little opposition these conditions were fulfilled,  though there was a strong feeling against the repudiation of the debt,  much discussion as to whether the ordinance of secession should  be \"repealed\" or declared \"now and always null and void,\" and some  quibbling as to whether slavery was being destroyed by state action or  had already been destroyed by war.    In the old state constitutions, very slight changes were made. Of  these the chief were concerned with the abolition of slavery and the  arrangement of representation and direct taxation on the basis of white  population. Little effort was made to settle any of the Negro problems,  and in all states the conventions left it to the legislatures to make  laws for the freedmen. There was no discussion of Negro, suffrage in the  conventions, but President Johnson sent what was for him a remarkable  communication to Governor Sharkey of Mississippi:    \"If you could extend the elective franchise to all persons of color  who can read the Constitution of the United States in English and write  their names, and to all persons of color who own real estate valued at  not less than two hundred and fifty dollars and pay taxes thereon,  you would completely disarm the adversary and set an example the other  states will follow. This you can do with perfect safety, and you would  thus place Southern States in reference to free persons of color  upon the same basis with the free states.... And as a consequence the  radicals, who are wild upon Negro franchise, will be completely foiled  in their attempts to keep the Southern states from renewing  their relations to the Union by not accepting their senators and  representatives.\"    In deciding upon a basis of representation, it was clear that the  majority of delegates desired to lessen the influence of the Black Belt  and place the control of the government with the \"up country.\" In the  Alabama convention Robert M. Patton, then a delegate and later governor,  frankly avowed this object, and in South Carolina, Governor Perry urged  the convention to give no consideration to Negro suffrage, \"because this  is a white man's government,\" and if the Negroes should vote they would  be controlled by a few whites. A kindly disposition toward the Negroes  was general except on the part of extreme Unionists, who opposed any  favors to the race. \"This is a white man's country\" was a doctrine to  which all the conventions subscribed.    The conventions held brief sessions, completed their work, and  adjourned, after directing that elections be held for state and local  officers and for members of Congress. Before December the appointed  local officials had been succeeded by elected officers; members of  Congress were on their way to Washington; the state legislatures were  assembling or already in session; and the elected governors were  ready to take office. It was understood that as soon as enough state  legislatures ratified the Thirteenth Amendment to make it a part of the  Constitution, the President would permit the transfer of authority to  the new governors. The legislature of Mississippi alone was recalcitrant  about the amendment, and before January 1866, the elected officials were  everywhere installed except in Texas, where the work was not completed  until March. When Congress met in December 1865, the President reported  that all former Confederate States except Texas were ready to be  readmitted. Congress, however, refused to admit their senators and  representatives, and thus began the struggle which ended over a year  later with the victory of the radicals and the undoing of the work of  the two Presidents.    The plan of the Presidents was at best only imperfectly realized. It was  found impossible to reorganize the Federal Administration in the South  with men who could subscribe to the \"ironclad oath,\" for nearly all who  were competent to hold office had favored or aided the Confederacy.  It was two years before more than a third of the post offices could be  opened. The other Federal departments were in similar difficulties, and  at last women and \"carpetbaggers\" were appointed. The Freedmen's  Bureau, which had been established coincidently with the provisional  governments, assumed jurisdiction over the Negroes, while the army  authorities very early took the position that any man who claimed to be  a Unionist should not be tried in the local courts but must be given a  better chance in a provost court.
