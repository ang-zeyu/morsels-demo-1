This page was last updated on 23 October, 2003        =====================================================================        A Brief History of Basic Intelligence and The World Factbook      The Intelligence Cycle is the process by which information is acquired,  converted into intelligence, and made available to policymakers.  Information is raw data from any source, data that may be fragmentary,  contradictory, unreliable, ambiguous, deceptive, or wrong.  Intelligence is information that has been collected, integrated,  evaluated, analyzed, and interpreted. Finished intelligence is the  final product of the Intelligence Cycle ready to be delivered to the  policymaker.    The three types of finished intelligence are: basic, current, and  estimative. Basic intelligence provides the fundamental and factual  reference material on a country or issue. Current intelligence reports  on new developments. Estimative intelligence judges probable outcomes.  The three are mutually supportive: basic intelligence is the foundation  on which the other two are constructed; current intelligence  continually updates the  inventory of knowledge; and estimative  intelligence revises overall interpretations of country and issue  prospects for guidance of basic and  current intelligence. The World  Factbook, The President's Daily Brief, and the National Intelligence  Estimates are examples of the three types of finished intelligence.    The United States has carried on foreign intelligence activities  since the days of George Washington but only since World War II have  they been coordinated on a government-wide basis. Three programs have  highlighted the development of coordinated basic intelligence since  that time: (1) the Joint Army Navy Intelligence Studies (JANIS), (2)  the National Intelligence Survey (NIS), and (3) The World Factbook.    During World War II, intelligence consumers realized that the  production of basic intelligence by different components of the US  Government resulted in a great duplication of effort and conflicting  information. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought home  to leaders in Congress and the executive branch the need for  integrating departmental reports to national policymakers. Detailed and  coordinated information was needed not only on such major powers as  Germany and Japan, but also on places of little previous interest. In  the Pacific Theater, for example, the Navy and Marines had to launch  amphibious operations against many islands about which information was  unconfirmed or nonexistent. Intelligence authorities resolved that the  United States should never again be caught unprepared.    In 1943, Gen. George B. Strong (G-2), Adm. H. C. Train (Office of  Naval Intelligence - ONI), and Gen. William J. Donovan (Director of the  Office of Strategic Services - OSS) decided that a joint effort should  be initiated. A steering committee was appointed on 27 April 1943 that  recommended the formation of a Joint Intelligence Study Publishing  Board to assemble, edit, coordinate, and publish the Joint Army Navy  Intelligence Studies (JANIS). JANIS was the first interdepartmental  basic intelligence program to fulfill the needs of the US Government  for an authoritative and coordinated appraisal of strategic basic  intelligence. Between April 1943 and July 1947, the board published 34  JANIS studies. JANIS performed well in the war effort, and numerous  letters of commendation were received, including a statement from Adm.  Forrest Sherman, Chief of Staff, Pacific Ocean Areas, which said,  \"JANIS has become the indispensable reference work for the shore-based  planners.\"    The need for more comprehensive basic intelligence in the postwar  world was well expressed in 1946 by George S. Pettee, a noted author on  national security. He wrote in The Future of American Secret  Intelligence (Infantry Journal Press, 1946, page 46) that world  leadership in peace requires even more elaborate intelligence than in  war. \"The conduct of peace involves all countries, all human activities  - not just the enemy and his war production.\"    The Central Intelligence Agency was established on 26 July 1947  and officially began operating on 18 September 1947. Effective 1  October 1947, the Director of Central Intelligence assumed operational  responsibility for JANIS. On 13 January 1948, the National Security  Council issued Intelligence Directive (NSCID) No. 3, which authorized  the National Intelligence Survey (NIS) program as a peacetime  replacement for the wartime JANIS program. Before adequate NIS country  sections could be produced, government agencies had to develop more  comprehensive gazetteers and better maps. The US Board on Geographic  Names (BGN) compiled the names; the Department of the Interior produced  the gazetteers; and CIA produced the maps.    The Hoover Commission's Clark Committee, set up in 1954 to study  the structure and administration of the CIA, reported to Congress in  1955 that: \"The National Intelligence Survey is an invaluable  publication which provides the essential elements of basic intelligence  on all areas of the world. There will always be a continuing  requirement for keeping the Survey up-to-date.\" The Factbook was  created as an annual summary and update to the encyclopedic NIS  studies. The first classified Factbook was published in August 1962,  and the first unclassified version was published in June 1971. The NIS  program was terminated in 1973 except for the Factbook, map, and  gazetteer components. The 1975 Factbook was the first to be made  available to the public with sales through the US Government Printing  Office (GPO). The Factbook was first made available on the Internet in  June 1997. The year 2003 marks the 56th anniversary of the  establishment of the Central Intelligence Agency and the 60th year of  continuous basic intelligence support to the US Government by The World  Factbook and its two predecessor programs.

Telephones - mobile cellular  This entry gives the total number of mobile cellular telephones in use.    Television - broadcast stations  This entry gives the total number of separate broadcast stations plus  any repeater stations.    Terminology  Due to the highly structured nature of the Factbook database, some  collective generic terms have to be used. For example, the word Country  in the Country name entry refers to a wide variety of dependencies,  areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and other entities  in addition to the traditional countries or independent states.  Military is also used as an umbrella term for various civil defense,  security, and defense activities in many entries. The Independence  entry includes the usual colonial independence dates and former ruling  states as well as other significant nationhood dates such as the  traditional founding date or the date of unification, federation,  confederation, establishment, or state succession that are not strictly  independence dates. Dependent areas have the nature of their dependency  status noted in this same entry.    Terrain  This entry contains a brief description of the topography.    Total fertility rate  This entry gives a figure for the average number of children that would  be born per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing  years and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each  age. The total fertility rate is a more direct measure of the level of  fertility than the crude birth rate, since it refers to births per  woman. This indicator shows the potential for population growth in the  country. High rates will also place some limits on the labor force  participation rates for women. Large numbers of children born to women  indicate large family sizes that might limit the ability of the  families to feed and educate their children.    Transnational Issues  This category includes only two entries at the present time - Disputes  - international and Illicit drugs - that deal with current issues going  beyond national boundaries.    Transportation  This category includes the entries dealing with the means for movement  of people and goods.    Transportation - note  This entry includes miscellaneous transportation information of  significance not included elsewhere.    Unemployment rate  This entry contains the percent of the labor force that is without  jobs. Substantial underemployment might be noted.    Waterways  This entry gives the total length of navigable rivers, canals, and  other inland bodies of water.    Years  All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless indicated as  fiscal year (FY). The"]]]
