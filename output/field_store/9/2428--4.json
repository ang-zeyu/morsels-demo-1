These Herefords are among the very best which  England can produce, and come up fully to the description of the  choicest of the breed. Mr. Sotham, after an experience of several years,  is satisfied with the cows for the dairy; and he has given very  favorable published statements of the results of their milking  qualities, from which it may be properly inferred, that Youatt drew his  estimates from some herds which were quite indifferent in this property.  They are peculiarly the grazier's animal, as they improve rapidly and  mature early on medium feed. They are excelled for the yoke, if at all,  only by the Devons, which, in some features, they strongly resemble.  Both are probably divergent branches of the same original stock.      The Ayrshire    Is a breed that has been much sought after of late years, from their  reputation for fine dairy qualities. The milk is good both in quantity  and quality, yielding, according to a recent statement of Mr. Tennant,  of Scotland, who owns a large herd, fifteen quarts per day during the  best of the season, twelve of which made a pound of butter. The product  of the latter averages about 170 pounds per annum to each cow. Another  authority says, on the best low-land pasture, a good cow yields nearly  4000 quarts per year. This is a large quantity, and implies good cows  and extra feed.    Mr. Cushing, of Massachusetts, who imported several select animals,  without regard to their cost, informed us, after three or four years'  trial, that he did not perceive any superiority in them, over the good  native cows of that state, for dairy purposes. A large number have been  imported in detached parcels, and scattered through the country. They  are good animals, but seem to combine no valuable properties in a higher  degree than are to be found in our own good cattle, and especially such  as are produced from a cross of the Short Horn bull of a good milking  family, on our native cows. They are evidently a recent breed, and do  not therefore possess that uniformity of appearance and quality, which  attaches to one of long cultivation.    Mr. Aiton, of Scotland, gives the following account of them. \"The dairy  breed of Scotland have been formed chiefly by skilful management, within  the last 50 years; and they are still improving and extending to other  countries. Till after 1770, the cows in Cunningham were small, ill-fed,  ill-shaped, and gave but little milk. Some cows of a larger breed and of  a brown and white color, were about that time brought to Ayrshire from  Teeswater, and from Holland, by some of the patriotic noblemen of  Ayrshire; and these being put on good pasture, yielded more milk than  the native breed, and their calves were much sought after by the  farmers.\"    We may fairly infer from the foregoing, which is deemed indisputable  authority; from the locality of their origin, in the neighborhood of the  Short Horns; and from their general resemblance, both externally and in  their general characteristics to the grade animals, that they owe their  principal excellence to this long-established breed.      MANAGEMENT OF CALVES.    The safest and least troublesome manner of raising calves, is at the  udder of the dam; and whenever the milk is converted into butter and  cheese, we believe this to be the most economical. The milk of one good  cow is sufficient, with a run of fresh, sweet pasture, to the feeding of  two calves at the same time; and if we allow the calves to arrive at  three or four months of age before weaning, we may safely estimate, that  one good cow will yield a quantity of milk in one season, fully  equivalent to bringing up four calves to a weaning age.    By keeping the calf on the fresh milk, whether he take it directly from  the udder, or warm from the pail, all risk of disordered bowels is  avoided. The milk is precisely adapted to the perfect health and thrift  of the young, and whenever we substitute for it any other food, we must  watch carefully that not the slightest mismanagement produces disorder,  lest more is lost by disease or want of improvement, than is gained by  the milk of which they are robbed.    The first milk of the cow after calving, is slightly purgative, which is  essential to cleanse the stomach of the calf. It is, moreover, perfectly  worthless for two or three days, for any other purpose except for swine.  The calf will seldom take all the milk at first, and whatever is left in  the bag should be thoroughly removed by the hand. If the calf is  destined for the butcher, he must have all the milk he wants for at  least six weeks, and eight or ten is better; and if the cow does not  furnish enough, he ought to be fed gruel or linseed tea. He must be  closely confined in a snug, but clean and airy stable, and the darker  this is, and the more quiet he is kept, the more readily he will fatten.    If designed to be reared, the safest and least troublesome method, is to  keep the calf on new milk. If saving the milk be an object, it is still  doubtful whether it is not better that he should have a part of it fresh  from the cow, and depend for his remaining food on a good grass or  clover pasture, meal, or roots.    Some farmers never allow the calf to approach the dam, but take it when  first dropped, and put a handful of salt in its mouth, which is daily  repeated till he is put to grass. This has a purgative effect, similar  to the first milk. Flaxseed is then prepared, by boiling a pint in four  to six quarts of water, and diluted with hay tea till it is rather  thicker than milk, and fed at blood heat.    _Hay tea_ is made, by boiling a pound of sweet, well-cured clover, in  one and a half gallons of clean water.    As the calf becomes older, oat, barley, rye, or Indian meal may be  scalded and added to the flaxseed.    When the skim-milk is of little consequence, a better way is to withdraw  him from the cow after three or four days, then scald the milk, adding a  little oat meal, and cool to the natural temperature of the milk, and  feed it. Oats, either crushed or ground, is the best and safest grain  for all young stock. The milk should not stand more than half a day  before feeding to young calves. As they advance in age, it may be fed  rather older, but should never be allowed to become sour; nor should it  ever be fed cold. Connected with this feed, should be a good range of  short, sweet pasture, and shelter against both sun and storms. If  expedient, at about 10 weeks old, he may be safely weaned, but four  months' nursing is better for the calf.    If allowed too much milk for several months, it is injurious to the  future development of the young. It does not distend the stomach  properly, nor call into use its ruminating habits. Calves thus brought  up, have often proved light-bellied, indifferent feeders, and decidedly  inferior animals. When the calf is removed from the cow, they should be  effectually separated from sight and hearing, as recognition creates  uneasiness, and is an impediment to thrift in both.    If there be any deficiency of suitable pasture for the calf, a small  rack and trough should be placed under the shed in his range, and fine  hay put in the former, and wheat bran or oat meal with a little salt in  the latter.      Diseases and Remedies.    For _disordered bowels_, mix 2 dr. rhubarb, 2 oz. castor oil, and 1/2 dr.  ginger, with a little warm milk or gruel; or give 2 oz. castor oil  alone; or 3 oz. of Epsom salts.    For _scours_ and _diarrh[oe]a_, a homely remedy is, to administer half a  pint of cider, with an equal quantity of blood drawn from the calf's  neck.    Or, add a little rennet to its food.    A good remedy is, 1 oz. powdered canella bark; 1 oz. laudanum; 4 oz.  prepared chalk; and one pint water. Mix together, and give a wine-glass  full or more, according to the size of the calf, three times a day.    _Costiveness_ is removed by giving pork broth.    Or, give 3 to 4 oz. Epsom salts, dissolved in 3 pints of water, injected  into the stomach; and repeat part of this dose every 3 or 4 hours, till  the desired effect is produced.    Calves, like all young stock, should be allowed to change their feed  gradually, from new milk to skimmed, or from the latter to other food.  Their stomachs are delicate, and need gentle, moderate changes, when  necessary to make them at all. Much depends on the care and attention  they receive. It is well to have a little resin within its reach.    A comfortable shelter, with a dry, warm bed, suitable food, regularly  given three times a day, at blood heat, and keeping the stomach in  proper order, will do much to bring them forward rapidly, and with a  small expenditure of food.    The calf requires to be supplied through the winter with an abundance of  fine, sweet hay and roots, the latter either chopped or mashed by a  roller, with the addition of a trifle of meal or oats, and a full supply  of salt and pure water.    When there are larger animals on the premises, the calves ought to be  kept by themselves. They should be sustained on their winter feed  through the following spring, until the grass furnishes a good bite on a  well-compacted sod. The change from hay to grass must be gradual, unless  the latter is considerably matured. The extreme relaxation of the bowels  from the sudden change, frequently produces excessive purging. A slight  and temporary relax from the early spring grass, is not objectionable.      Breeding.    The young animals should never be put to breeding under 15 months old,  so as to bring their first calf at two years old nor then, unless they  have large size and good feed. Much depends on the progress towards  maturity, and the supply of food in selecting the proper time for  breeding. Some are as ready for this at a year and a half as others are  at three. Early breeding gives delicacy and symmetry to the form of the  heifer, but it checks its growth; and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3421"],[0,"Bramble-Bees and Others (#10)"],[1,"next cell. Then the same method is repeated, that is to  say, in front of the just completed ceiling a second partition is built,  again with a side-passage, which is stouter, owing to its distance from  the centre, and better able to withstand the numerous comings and goings  of the housewife than a central orifice, deprived of the direct support  of the wall, could hope to be. When this partition is ready, the  provisioning of the second cell is effected; and so on until the wide  cylinder is completely stocked.    The building of this preliminary party-wall, with a narrow, round  dog-hole, for a chamber to which the victuals will not be brought until  later is not restricted to the Three-horned Osmia; it is also frequently  found in the case of the Horned Osmia and of Latreille's Osmia. Nothing  could be prettier than the work of the last-named, who goes to the  plants for her material and fashions a delicate sheet in which she cuts  a graceful arch. The Chinaman partitions his house with paper screens;  Latreille's Osmia divides hers with disks of thin green cardboard  perforated with a serving-hatch which remains until the room is  completely furnished. When we have no glass houses at our disposal,  we can see these little architectural refinements in the reeds of the  hurdles, if we open them at the right season.    By splitting the bramble-stumps in the course of July, we perceive  also that the Three-pronged Osmia, notwithstanding her narrow gallery,  follows the same practice as Latreille's Osmia, with a difference. She  does not build a party-wall, which the diameter of the cylinder would  not permit; she confines herself to putting up a frail circular pad of  green putty, as though to limit, before any attempt at harvesting,  the space to be occupied by the Bee-bread, whose depth could not be  calculated afterwards if the insect did not first mark out its confines.  Can there really be an act of measuring? That would be superlatively  clever. Let us consult the Three-horned Osmia in her glass tubes.    The Osmia is working at her big partition, with her body outside the  cell which she is preparing. From time to time, with a pellet of mortar  in her mandibles, she goes in and touches the previous ceiling with  her forehead, while the tip of her abdomen quivers and feels the pad in  course of construction. One might well say that she is using the length  of her body as a measure, in order to fix the next ceiling at the  proper distance. Then she resumes her work. Perhaps the measure was  not correctly taken; perhaps her memory, a few seconds old, has already  become muddled. The Bee once more ceases laying her plaster and again  goes and touches the front wall with her forehead and the back wall with  the tip of her abdomen. Looking at that body trembling with eagerness,  extended to its full length to touch the two ends of the room, how can  we fail to grasp the architect's grave problem? The Osmia is measuring;  and her measure is her body. Has she quite done, this time? Oh dear  no! Ten times, twenty times, at every moment, for the least particle of  mortar which she lays, she repeats her mensuration, never being quite  certain that her trowel is going just where it should.    Meanwhile, amid these frequent interruptions, the work progresses and  the partition gains in width. The worker is bent into a hook, with her  mandibles on the inner surface of the wall and the tip of her abdomen  on the outer surface. The soft masonry stands between the two points of  purchase. The insect thus forms a sort of rolling-press, in which the  mud wall is flattened and shaped. The mandibles tap and furnish mortar;  the end of the abdomen also pats and gives brisk trowel-touches. This  anal extremity is a builder's tool; I see it facing the mandibles on  the other side of the partition, kneading and smoothing it all over,  flattening the little lump of clay. It is a singular implement, which  I should never have expected to see used for this purpose. It takes an  insect to conceive such an original idea, to do mason's work with its  behind! During this curious performance, the only function of the legs  is to keep the worker steady by spreading out and clinging to the walls  of the tunnel.    The partition with the hole in it is finished. Let us go back to the  measuring of which the Osmia was so lavish. What a magnificent argument  in favour of the reasoning-power of animals! To find geometry, the  surveyor's art, in an Osmia's tiny brain! An insect that begins by  taking the measurements of the room to be constructed, just as any  master-builder might do! Why, it's splendid, it's enough to cover with  confusion those horrible sceptics who persist in refusing to admit the  animal's 'continuous little flashes of atoms of reason!'    O common-sense, veil your face! It is with this gibberish about  continuous flashes of atoms of reason that men pretend to build up  science to-day! Very well, my masters; the magnificent argument with  which I am supplying you lacks but one little detail, the merest trifle:  truth! Not that I have not seen and plainly seen all that I am relating;  but measuring has nothing to do with the case. And I can prove it by  facts.    If, in order to see the Osmia's nest as a whole, we split a reed  lengthwise, taking care not to disturb its contents; or, better still,  if we select for examination the string of cells built in a glass tube,  we are forthwith struck by one detail, namely, the uneven distances  between the partitions, which are placed almost at right angles to the  axis of the cylinder. It is these distances which fix the size of  the chambers, which, with a similar base, have different heights and  consequently unequal holding-capacities. The bottom partitions, the  oldest, are farther apart; those of the front part, near the orifice,  are closer together. Moreover, the provisions are plentiful in the  loftier cells, whereas they are niggardly and reduced to one-half or  even one-third in the cells of lesser height.    Here are a few examples of these inequalities. A glass tube with a  diameter of 12 millimetres (.468 inch.--Translator's Note.), inside  measurement, contains ten cells. The five lower ones, beginning with the  bottom-most, have as the respective distances between their partitions,  in millimetres:    11, 12, 16, 13, 11. (.429,.468,.624,.507,.429 inch.--Translator's Note.)    The five upper ones measure between their partitions:    7, 7, 5, 6, 7. (.273,.273,.195,.234,.273 inch.--Translator's Note.)    A reed-stump 11 millimetres (.429 inch.--Translator's Note.) across the  inside contains fifteen cells; and the respective distances between the  partitions of those cells, starting from the bottom, are:    13, 12, 12, 9, 9, 11, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 7. (.507,.468,.468,  .351,.351,.429,.312,.312,.273,.273,.273,.234,.234,.234, .273  inch.--Translator's Note.)    When the diameter of the tunnel is less, the partitions can be still  further apart, though they retain the general characteristic of being  closer to one another the nearer they are to the orifice. A reed of five  millimetres (.195 inch.--Translator's Note.) in diameter, gives me the  following distances, always starting from the bottom:    22, 22, 20, 20, 12, 14. (.858,.858,.78,.78,.468,.546 inch.--Translator's  Note.)    Another, of 9 millimetres (.351 inch.--Translator's Note.), gives me:    15, 14, 11, 10, 10, 9, 10. (.585,.546,.429,.39,.39,.351,.39  inch.--Translator's Note.)    A glass tube of 8 millimetres (.312 inch.--Translator's Note.) yields:    15, 14, 20, 10, 10, 10. (.585,.546,.78,.39,.39,.39 inch.--Translator's  Note.).    I could fill pages and pages with such figures, if I cared to print all  my notes. Do they prove that the Osmia is a geometrician, employing a  strict measure based on the length of her body? Certainly not, because  many of those figures exceed the length of the insect; because sometimes  a higher number follows suddenly upon a lower; because the same string  contains a figure of one value and another figure of but half that  value. They prove only one thing: the marked tendency of the insect to  shorten the distance between the party-walls as the work proceeds. We  shall see later that the large cells are destined for the females and  the small ones for the males.    Is there not at least a measuring adapted to each sex? Again, not so;  for in the first series, where the females are housed, instead of the  interval of 11 millimetres, which occurs at the beginning and the end,  we find, in the middle of the series, an interval of 16 millimetres,  while in the second series, reserved for the males, instead of the  interval of 7 millimetres at the beginning and the end, we have an  interval of 5 millimetres in the middle. It is the same with the other  series, each of which shows a striking discrepancy in its figures. If  the Osmia really studied the dimensions of her chambers and measured  them with the compasses of her body, how could she, with her delicate  mechanism, fail to notice mistakes of 5 millimetres, almost half her own  length?    Besides, all idea of geometry vanishes if we consider the work in a tube  of moderate width. Here, the Osmia does not fix the front partition in  advance; she does not even lay its foundation. Without any boundary-pad,  with no guiding mark for the capacity of the cell, she busies herself  straightway with the provisioning. When the heap of Bee-bread is judged  sufficient, that is, I imagine, when her tired body tells her that she  has done enough harvesting, she closes up the chamber. In this case,  there is no measuring; and yet the capacity of the cell and the quantity  of the victuals fulfil the regular requirements of one or the other sex.    Then what does the Osmia do when she repeatedly stops to touch the  front partition with her forehead and the back partition, the one in the  course of building, with the tip of her"]]]
