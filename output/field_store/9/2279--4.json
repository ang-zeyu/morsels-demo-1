Fine Bread              3 small potatoes            1 tablespoon lard            2 handfuls salt            1 handful sugar    Soak the magic yeast cake in a little luke warm water. Add a little  flour to this, and let it stand an hour. Boil the potatoes in 2 quarts  water: when soft put through sieve and then set aside to cool in the  potato water. Add to this the lard, salt and sugar.    About 4 in the afternoon put the liquid in large bread riser. Add about  3 quarts of flour, beat thoroughly for at least 10 minutes; now add  dissolved yeast to it; let sponge rise until going to bed and then  stiffen. Knead until dough does not stick to the hands about 20 to 25  minutes. It will double in size. In morning put in bread pans and let  rise one hour or more. Bake in moderately hot oven one hour.    Many persons prefer stiffening the bread in the morning. In this case  set the sponge later in the evening and allow it to rise all night,  stiffening with the flour in the morning instead of the evening. Of  course this allows the baking to be rather late in the day.                                                  MRS. MEDILL MCCORMICK.    [Illustration]      Excellent Nut Bread    Two cupfuls of white flour (sifted), two cupfuls of graham or entire  wheat flour (sifted if one chooses), one-half cup of New Orleans  molasses, little salt, two cupfuls of milk or water, one cupful of  walnut meats (cut up fine), one teaspoonful of soda dissolved in milk,  about two tablespoons melted butter. Let raise 20 minutes. Bake about  one hour in moderate oven.      Virginia Batter Bread              2 cups milk            Salt to taste            1 tablespoon butter            1/2 cup of cream            1/2 cup white corn meal            2 to 5 well beaten eggs    Put in double boiler 2 cups of milk and 1/2 cup of cream. When this  reaches boiling point salt to taste. While stirring constantly sift in  1/2 cup of white corn meal (this is best). Boil 5 minutes still  stirring, then add 1 tablespoon of butter and from 2 to 5 well beaten  eggs (beaten separately) 1 for each person is a good rule.    Pour into a greased baking dish and bake in a quick oven until brown  like a custard. It must be eaten hot with butter and is a good breakfast  dish.                                                    MRS. K. W. BARRETT.      Bran Bread              4 cups sterilized bran            2 cups buttermilk            raisins if desired            2 cups white flour            1/2 teaspoon soda    Bake until thoroughly done.    [Illustration]                Editress Suffrage Cook Book:              I take pleasure in sending you a portrait and also            my favorite recipe for food, which I hope will be            of some use to you and help the cause along.              Mush should be made only of the whole meal flour            of the grain and well cleaned before grinding.            Whole wheat flour, whole Indian Corn Meal, whole            wheat and whole barley meal are examples of the            raw materials.              Take one pint (pound) of meal, 1/2 teaspoon of            salt, four pints (pounds) of water. Add the salt            to the water and after boiling stir in slowly, so            as to avoid making lumps, the meal until all is            used. Break up any lumps that may form with the            ladle until the mass is homogeneous.              Cover the vessel and boil slowly over a low fire            so as not to burn the contents, for an hour. Or            better after bringing to a boil in a closed vessel            place in a fireless cooker over night.              This is the best breakfast food that can be had            and the quantity above mentioned is sufficient for            from four to six persons. The cost of the raw            material based on the farmer's price is not over            1 1/2 cents.              Variation: Mush may also be made with cold water            by careful and continuous stirring. There is some            advantage of stirring the meal in cold water as            there is no danger of lumping but without very            vigorous stirring especially at the bottom, the            meal may scorch during the heating of the water.              The food above described is useful especially for            growing children as the whole meal or flour            produce the elements which nourish all the tissues            of the body.                                           Respectfully,                                            DR. HARVEY W. WILEY.    Dr. Wiley urges house wives to grind their own wheat flour and corn  meal, using the coffee grinder for the work. The degree of fineness of  flour is regulated by frequent grindings.    The improvement in flavor and freshness of cakes, breads and mush made  from home ground wheat and corn will absolutely prove a revelation.    [Illustration]      Polenta--Corn Meal    Take an iron kettle, put in two quarts water with one tablespoon salt.  Heat and before boiling, slowly pour in your corn meal, stirring  continuously until you have it very stiff. Put on lid and let boil for  an hour or more. Turn out in a pan and keep warm. Later this is turned  out on a platter for the table.    Cut it in pieces of about an inch wide for each plate and on this the  following sauce is added with a teaspoon Parmesan cheese added to each  piece.    Brown a good sized onion in two tablespoons butter, add 1/2 clove of  garlic, about 5 pieces of dried mushroom, being well soaked in water  (use the water also) dissolve a little extract of beef, pouring that  into this with a little more water, salt and some paprika--a pinch of  sugar and 1/3 teaspoon vinegar.    A little flour to make a nice gravy. This makes it very palatable.    It takes about ten minutes to cook.    Serve in gravy bowl--a spoonful on each piece of Polenta. Added to that  the grated cheese, is all that is needed for a whole meal. Apple sauce  should be served with this dish.

STATE OF ARIZONA                              EXECUTIVE MANSION              Since equal suffrage became effective in Arizona            in December, 1912, the many critics of the            innovation have been quite effectually silenced by            the advantageous manner in which enfranchisement            of women has operated. Not only have the women of            this state evinced an intelligent and active            interest in governmental issues, but in several            instances important offices have been conferred            upon that element of the electorate which recently            acquired the elective franchise. Kindly assure            your co-workers in Pennsylvania of my best wishes            for their success.                                                  W. P. HUNT.                                   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2634"],[0,"The Evolution of Theology: an Anthropological Study (#10)"],[1,"olatry,_ the ethical  code, often of a very high order, comes into closer relation with the  theological creed. Morality is taken under the patronage of the god or  gods, who reward all morally good conduct and punish all morally evil  conduct in this world or the next. At the same time, however, they  are conceived to be thoroughly human, and they visit any shadow of  disrespect to themselves, shown by disobedience to their commands, or by  delay, or carelessness, in carrying them out, as severely as any breach  of the moral laws. Piety means minute attention to the due performance  of all sacred rites, and covers any number of lapses in morality, just  as cruelty, treachery, murder, and adultery did not bar David's claim to  the title of the man after God's own heart among the Israelites; crimes  against men may be expiated, but blasphemy against the gods is an  unpardonable sin. Men forgive all injuries but those which touch their  self-esteem; and they make their gods after their own likeness, in their  own image make they them.    It is in the category of monolatry that I conceive the theology of the  old Israelites must be ranged. They were polytheists, in so far as they  admitted the existence of other Elohim of divine rank beside Jahveh;  they differed from ordinary polytheists, in so far as they believed  that Jahveh was the supreme god and the one proper object of their own  national worship. But it will doubtless be objected that I have been  building up a fictitious Israelitic theology on the foundation of the  recorded habits and customs of the people, when they had lapsed from  the ordinances of their great lawgiver and prophet Moses, and that my  conclusions may be good for the perverts to Canaanitish theology, but  not for the true observers of the Sinaitic legislation. The answer to  the objection is that--so far as I can form a judgment of that which is  well ascertained in the history of Israel--there is very little ground  for believing that we know much, either about the theological and social  value of the influence of Moses, or about what happened during the  wanderings in the Desert.    The account of the Exodus and of the occurrences in the Sinaitic  peninsula; in fact, all the history of Israel before the invasion of  Canaan, is full of wonderful stories, which may be true, in so far as  they are conceivable occurrences, but which are certainly not probable,  and which I, for one, decline to accept until evidence, which deserves  that name, is offered of their historical truth. Up to this time I know  of none. [28] Furthermore, I see no answer to the argument that one  has no right to pick out of an obviously unhistorical statement the  assertions which happen to be probable and to discard the rest. But it  is also certain that a primitively veracious tradition may be smothered  under subsequent mythical additions, and that one has no right to cast  away the former along with the latter. Thus, perhaps the fairest way of  stating the case may be as follows.    There can be no _a priori_ objection to the supposition that the  Israelites were delivered from their Egyptian bondage by a leader called  Moses, and that he exerted a great influence over their subsequent  organisation in the Desert. There is no reason to doubt that, during  their residence in the land of Goshen, the Israelites knew nothing  of Jahveh; but, as their own prophets declare (see Ezek. xx.), were  polytheistic idolaters, sharing in the worst practices of their  neighbours. As to their conduct in other respects, nothing is known. But  it may fairly be suspected that their ethics were not of a higher order  than those of Jacob, their progenitor, in which case they might derive  great profit from contact with Egyptian society, which held honesty and  truthfulness in the highest esteem. Thanks to the Egyptologers, we now  know, with all requisite certainty, the moral standard of that society  in the time, and long before the time, of Moses. It can be determined  from the scrolls buried with the mummified dead and from the  inscriptions on the tombs and memorial statues of that age. For,  though the lying of epitaphs is proverbial, so far as their subject is  concerned, they gave an unmistakable insight into that which the writers  and the readers of them think praiseworthy.    In the famous tombs at Beni Hassan there is a record of the life of  Prince Nakht, who served Osertasen II., a Pharaoh of the twelfth dynasty  as governor of a province. The inscription speaks in his name: \"I was  a benevolent and kindly governor who loved his country.... Never was  a little child distressed nor a widow ill-treated by me. I have never  repelled a workman nor hindered a shepherd. I gave alike to the widow  and to the married woman, and have not preferred the great to the small  in my gifts.\" And we have the high authority of the late Dr. Samuel  Birch for the statement that the inscriptions of the twelfth dynasty  abound in injunctions of a high ethical character. \"To feed the hungry,  give drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked, bury the dead, loyally  serve the king, formed the first duty of a pious man and faithful  subject.\" [29] The people for whom these inscriptions embodied their  ideal of praiseworthiness assuredly had no imperfect conception of  either justice or mercy. But there is a document which gives still  better evidence of the moral standard of the Egyptians. It is the \"Book  of the Dead,\" a sort of \"Guide to Spiritland,\" the whole, or a part,  of which was buried with the mummy of every well-to-do Egyptian, while  extracts from it are found in innumerable inscriptions. Portions of this  work are of extreme antiquity, evidence of their existence occurring  as far back as the fifth and sixth dynasties; while the 120th chapter,  which constitutes a sort of book by itself, and is known as the \"Book of  Redemption in the Hall of the two Truths,\" is frequently inscribed upon  coffins and other monuments of the nineteenth dynasty (that under which,  there is some reason to believe, the Israelites were oppressed and the  Exodus took place), and it occurs, more than once, in the famous tombs  of the kings of this and the preceding dynasty at Thebes. [30] This  \"Book of Redemption\" is chiefly occupied by the so-called \"negative  confession\" made to the forty-two Divine Judges, in which the soul of  the dead denies that he has committed faults of various kinds. It  is, therefore, obvious that the Egyptians conceived that their gods  commanded them not to do the deeds which are here denied. The \"Book  of Redemption,\" in fact, implies the existence in the mind of the  Egyptians, if not in a formal writing, of a series of ordinances,  couched, like the majority of the ten commandments, in negative terms.  And it is easy to prove the implied existence of a series which  nearly answers to the \"ten words.\" Of course a polytheistic and  image-worshipping people, who observed a great many holy days, but no  Sabbaths, could have nothing analogous to the first or the second and  the fourth commandments of the Decalogue; but answering to the third, is  \"I have not blasphemed;\" to the fifth, \"I have not reviled the face  of the king or my father;\" to the sixth, \"I have not murdered;\" to the  seventh, \"I have not committed adultery;\" to the eighth, \"I have not  stolen,\" \"I have not done fraud to man;\" to the ninth, \"I have not  told falsehoods in the tribunal of truth,\" and, further, \"I have not  calumniated the slave to his master.\" I find nothing exactly similar to  the tenth commandment; but that the inward disposition of mind was held  to be of no less importance than the outward act is to be gathered from  the praises of kindliness already cited and the cry of \"I am pure,\"  which is repeated by the soul on trial. Moreover, there is a minuteness  of detail in the confession which shows no little delicacy of moral  appreciation--\"I have not privily done evil against mankind,\" \"I  have not afflicted men,\" \"I have not withheld milk from the mouths of  sucklings,\" \"I have not been idle,\" \"I have not played the hypocrite,\"  \"I have not told falsehoods,\" \"I have not corrupted woman or man,\" \"I  have not caused fear,\" \"I have not multiplied words in speaking.\"    Would that the moral sense of the nineteenth century A.D. were as far  advanced as that of the Egyptians in the nineteenth century B.C. in this  last particular! What incalculable benefit to mankind would flow from  strict observance of the commandment, \"Thou shalt not multiply words  in speaking!\" Nothing is more remarkable than the stress which the  old Egyptians, here and elsewhere, lay upon this and other kinds of  truthfulness, as compared with the absence of any such requirement in  the Israelitic Decalogue, in which only a specific kind of untruthfulnes  is forbidden.    If, as the story runs, Moses was adopted by a princess of the royal  house, and was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, it is  surely incredible that he should not have been familiar from his youth  up, with the high moral code implied in the \"Book of Redemption.\" It  is surely impossible that he should have been less familiar with the  complete legal system, and with the method of administration of justice,  which, even in his time, had enabled the Egyptian people to hold  together, as a complex social organisation, for a period far longer than  the duration of old Roman society, from the building of the city to  the death of the last Caesar. Nor need we look to Moses alone for the  influence of Egypt upon Israel. It is true that the Hebrew nomads who  came into contact with the Egyptians of Osertasen, or of Ramses, stood  in much the same relation to them, in point of culture, as a Germanic  tribe did to the Romans of Tiberius, or of Marcus Antoninus; or as  Captain Cook's Omai did to the English of George the Third. But, at the  same time, any difficulty of communication which might have"]]]
