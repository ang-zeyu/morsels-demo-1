However, perhaps year-round inclusion of  insects in its diet (Martin et al., 1951; Taylor, 1954; Wood, 1954;  Toweill and Teer, 1977; Trapp, 1978), plus water- and energy-conserving  advantages of a low metabolic rate, each exert a stronger selective  influence on [.H]_{b} than do vertebrates in its diet.    SUMMARY.--The basal metabolic rate of these procyonids does appear to  be influenced by diet. But, it is apparent from this family's  evolutionary history and tropical origins that climate also has had a  profound influence on its member's metabolism. The history of the  family and the data presented here (Table 7) suggest that lower than  predicted [.H]_{b} is a feature that evolved very early as the primary  metabolic adjustment to a tropical climate. From this perspective, it  could be argued that climate would have been the major selective force  determining [.H]_{b}, whereas food habits would have had a secondary  influence.      _Basal Metabolism and Intrinsic Rate of Natural Increase_    BACKGROUND.--McNab (1980a) suggested that if food is not restricted  during an animal's reproductive period, the factor that will limit  growth and reproduction will be the rate at which energy can be used  in growth and development. Under these conditions, an increase in  [.H]_{b} would actually increase r_{max} because it would provide a  higher rate of biosynthesis, a faster growth rate, and a shorter  generation time. Hennemann (1983) tested McNab's (1980a) premise and  found a significant correlation between r_{max} and metabolic rate,  independent of body size, for 44 mammal species. A low correlation  coefficient for this relationship, however, indicated to him  (Hennemann, 1983) that factors such as (1) food supply, (2) thermal  characteristics of the environment, and (3) brain size also contribute  toward shaping a species' reproductive potential, particularly when  these factors strongly influence rates of biosynthesis or growth or  for some reason alter generation time. Results of our estimates of  r_{max} for procyonids are presented in Table 10.    _Procyon lotor._--This species had the highest [.H]_{b} and D_{d}, and  also had the highest r_{max} (1.34; Table 10). Such a high r_{max} may  infer that this trait evolved under conditions where food and  temperature were not limiting to reproduction. Under these conditions  selection could have favored those reproductive characteristics  sensitive to a higher [.H]_{b} (biosynthesis, growth, and generation  time; McNab, 1980a). _Procyon lotor_'s high reproductive potential is  due to its early age of first female reproduction and its large litter  size, characteristics that may reflect metabolically driven increases  in both biosynthesis and growth.    _Bassariscus astutus._--This species has a low [.H]_{b} but an r_{max}  that was 124% of expected (Table 10). This suggests that r_{max}  evolved under conditions where food and temperature were not  limiting to reproduction. Reduced litter size should restrict this  species' reproductive potential and may be a reflection of its low  [.H]_{b}. The factor that is responsible for increasing its  reproductive potential, however, is its early age of first female  reproduction. _Bassariscus astutus_ is the smallest of these  procyonids, and even though it has a low [.H]_{b}, its small mass  may contribute to its ability to reach adult size and sexual maturity  in its first year. The high quality of its diet (a high proportion of  small vertebrates; Table 9) also may be a factor that is permissive to  early female reproduction. Thus, small body size and diet may be  factors that have allowed this species to evolve a higher than expected  reproductive potential in spite of its low [.H]_{b}.    _Nasua narica._--This species is one of the largest procyonids  (Table 7), and it possesses characteristics that should limit its  reproductive potential: lower than predicted [.H]_{b} (Table 7), a  relatively low-quality diet (Kaufmann, 1962:182-198; Table 9), and  delayed time of first reproduction (Table 10). In spite of this,  _Nasua narica_ has a higher than expected r_{max} (111% of predicted;  Table 10). The life history feature that enhances _Nasua narica_'s  reproductive potential, and increases r_{max} beyond expected, is its  large litter size. In this species females live in bands. Each year  just before their young are born these bands break up, and each female  seeks out a den for herself and her litter. Once the young are able to  leave the den (approximately five weeks), bands reform. In this  situation, females not only care for their own young but also for those  of other females in the band (Kaufmann, 1962:157-159, 1982, 1987;  Russell, 1983). This social structure may contribute to this species'  ability to produce large litters and in this way increase its  reproductive potential.

[c] Estimate based on females reproducing in their first (a = 0.83) or        second (a = 1.75) year.      _Nasua nasua._--Unfortunately, there is not enough reproductive data  to allow calculation of r_{max} for _Nasua nasua_ (Table 10), therefore,  it is not possible to compare the reproductive potential of this South  American coati with its North American relative, _Nasua narica_. Given  its low [.H]_{b} and relatively low-quality diet of fruit and  terrestrial invertebrates (Table 9), however, r_{max} of _Nasua nasua_  may be very similar to that of _Nasua narica_.    _Procyon cancrivorus._--The age of first female reproduction for  _Procyon cancrivorus_ has not been reported. However, if one assumes  females can reproduce in their first year, r_{max} for _Procyon  cancrivorus_ would be 1.02 (132% of expected; Table 10). If, on the  other hand, first female reproduction is delayed until the second year,  r_{max} would be 0.65 (84% of predicted; Table 10). _Procyon  cancrivorus_ has a low [.H]_{b}, reduced litter size, and small body  mass. Its low [.H]_{b} may limit litter size, but as with _Bassariscus  astutus_, the quality of its diet (a high percentage of small  vertebrates; Table 9) and its small body size may make it possible for  females to reproduce in their first year and thus increase the species'  reproductive potential. This reasoning would argue that _Procyon  cancrivorus_ probably enjoys higher, rather than lower, than expected  r_{max}.    _Potos"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36069"],[0,"Explorers and Travellers (#10)"],[1,"ues, met the English vessel, and  setting forth to the captain that France was in possession of all the  surrounding country, succeeded either by argument or cajolery in  persuading the captain to withdraw from the Mississippi.    Iberville was not long delayed by the delights and pleasures of the  French court, but speedily returned to Biloxi, where he arrived on the  eve of Twelfth Night with supplies, and more important of all, with  sixty hardy and energetic Canadians, with whom he established a fort a  short distance below the present site of New Orleans. The winter proved  a very cold one, the drinking-water freezing in the cups, but it did not  delay the rapid progress of the new fort. In the midst of this work  Chevalier de Tonti arrived with twenty Canadians from their former  settlement in Illinois.    Thus for the first time, with intercommunication established between the  permanent settlement in Illinois, Tonti's fort on the Arkansas, and the  new colony at the mouth of the Mississippi, Iberville felt that France  had indeed entered into actual possession of its great province of  Louisiana. He realized, however, the necessity of permanently connecting  these settlements, many hundred miles apart, and of facilitating  intercommunication through the establishment of intermediate posts.    Iberville contemplated an exploration of the Red River, thinking it  might afford access to the gold and silver mines of New Spain, but  abandoned the project owing to the representations of the Indians that  the river was unnavigable from the interlaced drift-wood, later known as  rafts. He turned his attention to the main river, the Mississippi, and  visited the Natchez, a brave and powerful tribe of Indians, whose  country delighted his heart as resembling France, and where he planned a  city to be called Rosalie (now Natchez), which, however, it was not his  fate to ever see take definite form, as it was only built long after his  death, in 1714, by his brother Bienville. It was at this time that Le  Sueur, sent up the Mississippi by Iberville, discovered the St. Peter  River, in Minnesota, and attempting mining operations, later brought  back a worthless cargo of green earth. To Iberville's credit, it may be  said, he viewed this and many other similar schemes of development with  a sceptical and practical eye.    Later he sent his brother Bienville across country to explore the Red  River, which was done with good success. His priest Montigny was also  active in extending the faith, both among the Natchez Indians and in the  basin of the Tensas River. Indeed, every effort was made under  Iberville's sagacious direction to obtain a knowledge of the  possibilities of the country, so that its resources might be properly  developed.    Iberville returned to France ill with fever, but despite his disease, he  displayed extraordinary energy in personally advancing the practical  affairs of his new colony. Moreover, he prepared a memoir urging the  cession of Pensacola by Spain to France, which nation was to establish  forts and arm the Indians along the Mississippi River, whereby the  interior of America from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada would be under  French domination, save the narrow strip along the Atlantic coast  already occupied by England. It was a sagacious scheme which if it had  been properly supported by France would have entirely changed the future  of America. It received, however, but a perfunctory support, and only  resulted in exciting the jealousy of Spain.    Iberville's last voyage to Louisiana was made in 1701, when his health,  undermined by the climate, was impaired by the formation of an abscess  which confined him to his bed for two months. His mind worked  incessantly, and his activity through other hands was wonderful. He  planned the royal magazines on Dauphine Island, located the new post on  Mobile River, told off the relief of workmen for the various  enterprises, planned flat-boats for lighters, extended relief to the  Spaniards at Vera Cruz, and sent Tonti as an agent to make peace with  the Choctaws and Chickasaws and secure them as allies. His sailor's eye  was particularly pleased with the magnificent forests of Mobile Bay,  where the oaks and pines presented the finest timber for ship-building  he had ever seen.    With Mobile commenced, the royal storehouses erected, and the alliance  of the Choctaws and Chickasaws secured, Iberville felt that the colony  of Louisiana was on a secure foundation, and on March 31st he sailed  from Dauphine Island, then the headquarters of that colony for which he  had done so much, and which he was destined never again to see.    The domain of Louisiana, obtained by so much heroic endeavor and  individual suffering on the part of Joliet, Marquette, La Salle, Tonti,  Iberville, and their associates, passed at once, by an edict of Louis  XIV., into a monopoly and under the control of a courtier, Anton Crozat,  for trading purposes, by the decree of September 14, 1712. In this  decree the limits of Louisiana were for the first time defined,  including \"all the territories by us (France) possessed, and bounded by  New Mexico and by those of the English in Carolina.... The river St.  Louis, formerly called the Mississippi, from the sea-shore to the  Illinois, together with the rivers St. Phillipe, formerly called the  Missouries, and the St. Jerome, formerly called the Wabash (the Ohio),  with all the countries, territories, lakes in the land, and the rivers  emptying directly or indirectly into that part of the river St. Louis.  All the said territories, countries, rivers, streams, and islands we  will to be and remain comprised under the name of the government of  Louisiana.\"    There was another and blacker page to the decree, whereby Crozat was  further authorized to introduce African slavery: \"If the aforesaid Sieur  Crozat considers it advisable to have negroes in the said country of  Louisiana, for agriculture or other use on plantations, he can send a  ship each year to trade directly with the Guinea coast, ... and is  further authorized to sell negroes to the settlers of Louisiana.\"    But prior to this condition of affairs the great Canadian naval  commander had passed to his final reward, having died of yellow fever at  Havana, July 9, 1706. The last leaf in his history was, however, an  effort, through his personal bravery and skill, to secure French  domination in America by driving out of the Antilles the determined  English seamen whose successful raids so often militated against the  interests of France. Despite his health, undermined by fevers, Iberville  left France with a fleet with which he hoped to carry out this great  plan. Intending to make a descent upon Barbadoes, he learned that the  English, warned of his plans, were prepared for him. He therefore seized  on the islands of Nevis and St. Christopher, where his fleet captured an  enormous amount of booty of all kinds. He decided next to ravage the  English colonies in the Carolinas, but stopping at Havana for  reinforcements he lost his own life by the epidemic which destroyed  eight hundred others of his fleet.    Among the qualities of this great Canadian all must admire his  intrepidity in war, his skill as a navigator, and his capacity as an  explorer; but beyond these were the astonishing administrative ability  and political sagacity which he displayed in such an eminent degree in  the planning, founding, and fostering of the great province of  Louisiana.    [Illustration: New Orleans in 1719.]          III.    JONATHAN CARVER,    THE EXPLORER OF MINNESOTA.      Throughout the bloody series of French and Indian wars which ravaged the  frontier settlements of America during the first half of the eighteenth  century, France maintained secure possession of the regions of the great  lakes and the basin of the upper Mississippi. The successful campaign of  the gallant Wolfe against the no less gallant Montcalm ultimately  resulted in the termination of French supremacy in these sections, and  under the treaty of Paris, in 1763, Canada with all other dominions of  France east of the Mississippi passed under the control of Great  Britain.    To this time the English colonists had confined their operations almost  entirely to the region of the Atlantic Coast, so when Great Britain  acquired her immense war-inheritance the country to the west of the  Appalachian Mountain range was practically an unknown region to its new  masters. The extension of English settlements toward the interior of the  continent was determined on by the English Government, and the more  accessible of the French trading-posts in the northwest were immediately  occupied. Maps were few and inaccurate, information as to the Indians  vague and exaggerated, while nothing was known as to the resources of  the country except that furs were obtainable in large numbers.    Scarcely were the terms of the treaty promulgated than the enterprising  pioneers moved westward and gradually pressed back the Indians nearest  the English settlements. A few other men, however, undertook to  penetrate the valley of the Mississippi to the very frontier of  Louisiana, which remained a French possession.    Among these hardy and adventurous Americans the most enterprising was  Captain Jonathan Carver, who was born in Stillwater, N. Y., in 1732. He  was the grandson of William Joseph Carver, one of the earliest of the  royal appointments in Connecticut, and his first public service was at  the age of eighteen, when he secured an ensigncy in a Connecticut  regiment. In 1757, when Colonel Oliver Partridge raised a battalion of  infantry in Massachusetts to serve against Canada, Carver was made a  lieutenant therein. Later he served as captain under Colonel Whitcomb,  in 1760, and under Colonel Saltonstall, in 1762, and participated in the  taking of Crown Point and other operations in northern New York.
