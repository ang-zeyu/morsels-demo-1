Ah! did they but know it.    Verily, for the God-fearing are gardens of delight in the presence of their  Lord.    Shall we then deal with those who have surrendered themselves to God, as with  those who offend him?    What hath befallen you that ye thus judge?    Have ye a Scripture wherein ye can search out    That ye shall have the things ye choose?    Or have ye received oaths which shall bind Us even until the day of the  resurrection, that ye shall have what yourselves judge right?    Ask them which of them will guarantee this?    Or is it that they have joined gods with God? let them produce those  associate-gods of theirs, if they speak truth.    On the day when men's legs shall be bared,6 and they shall be called upon to  bow in adoration, they shall not be able:    Their looks shall be downcast: shame shall cover them: because, while yet in  safety, they were invited to bow in worship, but would not obey.    Leave me alone therefore with him who chargeth this revelation with  imposture. We will lead them by degrees to their ruin; by ways which they  know not;    Yet will I bear long with them; for my plan is sure.    Askest thou any recompense from them? But they are burdened with debt.    Are the secret things within their ken? Do they copy them from the Book of  God?    Patiently then await the judgment of thy Lord, and be not like him who was in  the fish,7 when in deep distress he cried to God.    Had not favour from his Lord reached him, cast forth would he have been on  the naked shore, overwhelmed with shame:    But his Lord chose him and made him of the just.    Almost would the infidels strike thee down with their very looks when they  hear the warning of the Koran. And they say, \"He is certainly possessed.\"    Yet is it nothing less than a warning for all creatures.      _______________________    1 It has been conjectured that as the word Nun means fish, there may be a  reference to the fish which swallowed Jonas (v. 48). The fact, however, is  that the meaning of this and of the similar symbols, throughout the Koran,  was unknown to the Muhammadans themselves even in the first century. Possibly  the letters Ha, Mim, which are prefixed to numerous successive Suras were  private marks, or initial letters, attached by their proprietor to the copies  furnished to Said when effecting his recension of the text under Othman. In  the same way, the letters prefixed to other Suras may be monograms, or  abbreviations, or initial letters of the names of the persons to whom the  copies of the respective Suras belonged.    addenda: The symbol nun may possibly refer to this letter as forming the  Rhyme in most of the verses of this Sura.    2 This Sura has been supposed by ancient Muslim authorities to be, if not the  oldest, the second revelation, and to have followed Sura xcvi. But this  opinion probably originated from the expression in v. 1 compared with Sura  xcvi. 4. Verses 17-33 read like a later addition, and this passage, as well  as verse 48-50, has been classed with the Medina revelations. In the absence  of any reliable criterion for fixing the date, I have placed this Sura with  those which detail the opposition encountered by the Prophet at Mecca.    3 By djinn. Comp.

It is to ransom the captive,3    Or to feed in the day of famine,    The orphan who is near of kin, or the poor that lieth in the dust;    Beside this, to be of those who believe, and enjoin stedfastness on each  other, and enjoin compassion on each other.

And he sent against them birds in flocks (ababils),    Claystones did they hurl down upon them,    And he made them like stubble eaten down!      _______________________    1 This Sura is probably Muhammad's appeal to the Meccans, intended at the  same time for his own encouragement, on the ground of their deliverance from  the army of Abraha, the Christian King of Abyssinia and Arabia Felix, said to  have been lost in the year of Muhammad's birth in an expedition against Mecca  for the purpose of destroying the Caaba. This army was cut off by small-pox  (Wakidi; Hishami), and there is no doubt, as the Arabic word for small-pox  also means \"small stones,\" in reference to the hard gravelly feeling of the  pustules, what is the true interpretation of the fourth line of this Sura,  which, like many other poetical passages in the Koran, has formed the  starting point for the most puerile and extravagant legends.

I swear by the heaven which accomplisheth its cycle,    And by the earth which openeth her bosom,    That this Koran is a discriminating discourse,    And that it is not frivolous.    They plot a plot against thee,    And I will plot a plot against them.    Deal calmly therefore with the infidels; leave them awhile alone.

SURA LXXX.HE FROWNED [XXIV.]    MECCA.42 Verses    In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful    HE FROWNED, and he turned his back,1    Because the blind man came to him!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34353"],[0,"The Forest Habitat of the University of Kansas Natural History Reservation (#10)"],[1," Its favorite site is along hilltop  limestone outcrops, especially where there is south exposure. There  are few on hilltops away from the outcrops. Hackberries are scattered  in small numbers over the wooded slopes. There are a few of unusually  large size, along edges of the bottomlands. Hackberries are  slow-growing. Counts of annual rings for four indicated an average of  7.1 rings per inch of trunk diameter. Young hackberries of all sizes  are numerous throughout the woodland. Therefore it seems likely that  this species is in process of spreading and probably has already  extended beyond the situations which it originally occupied.    The fruits of hackberry provide a fall and winter food supply for  various animals. Opossums are especially fond of them. Red-bellied  woodpeckers have been seen storing them. Migrating flocks of robins  may utilize them as a major food source temporarily. White-footed mice  and woodrats store them and eat them.      #Morus rubra.#--Red mulberry is moderately common in certain heavily  wooded areas, especially the lower parts of north slopes. A few are  present on wooded hilltops. Most of the trees are between ten and  twenty feet tall, and generally die before growing larger. Red  mulberry is present in most woodlands of eastern Kansas and is  seemingly distributed by birds. It is never an important component of  woodlands in the area. Catbirds (_Dumetella carolinensis_) and wood  thrushes (_Hylocichla mustelina_) especially have been noted  frequenting the vicinity of mulberry trees in fruit. Probably many  other kinds of birds utilize the fruits to some extent.      #Maclura pomifera.#--Osage orange was not a member of the original  flora, but early settlers in Kansas valued it for windbreaks and fence  posts, and they made extensive plantings. Presumably it was introduced  onto the area of the present study in the eighteen sixties. At the  present time it occurs throughout the woodland, with scattered mature  trees and many young trees on the former pastures. This aggressive  invader spread despite frequent cutting, and now plays an important  part in the ecology of the area. Most of the larger trees have been  cut one or more times, but have regenerated from stump sprouts with  multiple stems and spreading habit. The tough and durable wood is  useful for fence posts. The growth rate is slow, similar to that of  oaks and elms.    Osage orange is intolerant of fire and is easily killed by scorching.  It is damaged by browsing, and cannot grow in deep shade. It is  drought resistant. Mortality was light during the drought period of  1952-1954, although many of the trees were growing on poor soil in the  hotter and drier sites.    Where there are stands of mixed hardwoods, osage orange is relatively  scarce and tends to be on or near the edges of the stands. The osage  orange trees growing in competition with oaks, elms and hickories may  have tall, slender trunks and narrow crowns, in contrast with the  spreading habit of those growing in more open sites. In the woodlands  small and medium-sized trees are scarce and there is hardly any  reproduction. Obviously the osage orange, like honey locust became  established in the forests when the stands were more open, probably  after cutting of the large trees. In contrast to the meager  reproduction in shaded sites is the abundant crop of young saplings  along edges of fields adjacent to woods or about isolated osage orange  trees. Evidently the tree does not become established readily on  bluestem prairie. On a hillside adjoining the northwest corner of the  Reservation, long subjected to heavy grazing, osage orange dominates,  but just across the fence on the Reservation side, it is almost  absent. This area had been maintained as bluestem prairie until about  1934 by occasional burning and since then had partly grown up into  thickets in which dogwood, and saplings of elm and hackberry were  abundant.    The dense thorny branches provide shelter and nesting sites for many  kinds of animals. On this area the cardinal utilizes it for nesting  sites more frequently than any other kind of tree. Some nests were so  well protected by the thorns that they could scarcely be reached.  Indigo buntings, field sparrows, and yellow-billed cuckoos also use  these trees or young saplings for nesting sites.    In the forties, when the woodrat was common on the area, its local  distribution seemed to be determined mainly by the osage orange. Many  houses of the woodrat were built around old stumps at the bases of  large, spreading osage orange trees. Frequently the houses were in the  main crotch of a tree two to eight feet from the ground.  Characteristically the rats used horizontal or gently inclined, low  branches of the tree as runways to and from the house. In summer and  early autumn these rats stored foliage of the osage orange in large  quantities in chambers adjacent to the nest. The seeds also provided  an important food source. During the period 1948 to 1951 the woodrat  population steadily decreased, and one by one the houses in osage  orange trees were deserted, until the small surviving population of  woodrats was limited to hilltop rock outcrops not associated with  osage orange trees.    The seeds are well liked by other rodents also. In late fall and  winter after the \"hedge balls\" have fallen, fox squirrels visit the  trees and shred the fruits to gain access to the seeds. Over periods  of weeks heaps of the shredded refuse accumulate at the base of the  tree trunk. The seeds probably constitute the one most important  winter food of the fox squirrel. The tufted titmouse also relies to a  large extent on the seeds for its winter food. Being unable to shred  the bulky hedge balls itself, it depends almost entirely on the seeds  in fruits torn open by the squirrel but not fully utilized by it. At  times when the ground and trees are snow-covered, making unavailable  most other food sources, the osage orange seeds gleaned from refuse  heaps in the sheltered feeding places of the squirrels are probably of  critical importance to the titmouse.    The cottontail and white-footed mouse also eat the seeds.      #Platanus occidentalis.#--Sycamores are few and scattered on the area,  but those present seem to be holding their own if not gaining in  numbers. They include some of the largest trees on the Reservation.  The most typical habitat is along rocky ravines on wooded slopes.  Occasional trees are scattered through the woods away from ravines on  slopes of north, east, or west exposures, or on hilltop edges,  providing strong evidence that these areas were more open at the time  the sycamore seedlings became established. Cutting of the mature trees  in the original forest and subsequent grazing might have created the  conditions favorable for their establishment. Many saplings have  sprung up in the fallow hilltop fields that were formerly cultivated.    Many of the larger sycamores have cavities and these are inhabited by  various animals. A large sycamore in a ravine below a pond had a  cavity in its base within which a raccoon reared its litter of young  one summer. At other times this same cavity was inhabited by woodrats  and by fox squirrels. Seemingly this cavity was the habitat of a  certain chigger which was found on both the squirrels and the woodrat.  Red-bellied woodpeckers excavated a cavity high on this same tree  trunk, in which they reared their brood.    Several large sycamores died as a result of the cumulative effect of  drought in the summers of 1952, 1953 and 1954, but many others  survived.      #Prunus americana.#--Wild plum is a small tree, usually not more than  three inches in trunk diameter, nor more than twelve feet high. It  tends to grow in dense thickets which are spotty in distribution.  Several of these thickets are in edges of former pastures at the  woodland edge. Other extensive thickets are in the following  situations: along hilltop rock ledges and encroaching into adjacent  prairie on upper south-facing slope maintained as bluestem prairie by  mowing and burning, until 1934; along a ravine in formerly cultivated  hilltop fields; along tops of steep creek banks at edge of old corn  field. In a few situations within the woodland there are dead and  dying thickets of wild plum, shaded out by the closing in of the tree  canopy, as fast-growing trees such as elm, honey locust, and cherry  sprang up in former clearings.    The woodrat lived in several plum thickets that provided the type of  shelter from predators that it requires. The bark, fruit and foliage  are used as food. In autumn the plums sometimes are the chief food of  the opossum. Plum thickets provide the preferred habitat for the Bell  vireo (_Vireo bellii_). The white-eyed vireo, field sparrow, tree  sparrow, Harris sparrow, and white-throated sparrow (_Zonotrichia  albicollis_) also frequently use these thickets.      #Prunus serotina.#--Isolated trees of black cherry six to fifteen  inches in trunk diameter, have been noted on various parts of the  Reservation at widely scattered points. On a flat hilltop at the  southeastern corner of the Reservation there are many large trees of  black cherry, which make up a major portion of the stand, and trunks  of some are as much as 21 inches in diameter. Other trees in the  vicinity are mostly elms and honey locusts, and seemingly the area was  more open or perhaps entirely treeless in the recent past. The  presence of black cherry in forest often can be interpreted as  indicating more open conditions at the time the seedling became  established. Black cherry prefers a rich soil and an open habitat;  hence it is generally not common in woodlands of northeastern Kansas.    The fruits of black cherry are a favorite food of the opossum, and the  seeds have often been noticed in the scats of this animal.  White-footed mice store and eat the seeds.
