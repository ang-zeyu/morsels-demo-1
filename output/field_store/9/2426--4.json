The young man took good aim and fired.  The enemy threw up both hands and fell forward on his face. The other  one on the hill, seeing his friend killed, hastily mounted his horse  and leading his friend's horse, made rapidly off down the butte in the  direction from whence he had come. Waiting for some time to be sure the  one who was alive did not come up and take a shot at him, he finally  advanced upon the fallen enemy and securing his gun, ammunition and  scalp, went to his horse and drove the herd on through the woods and  crossing a long flat prairie, ascended a long chain of hills and sat  looking back along his trail in search of any of the enemy who might  continue to follow him.    Thus he sat until the long shadows of the hills reminded him that it  would soon be sunset, and as he must get some sleep, he wanted to find  some creek bend where he could drive the bunch of ponies and feel safe  as to their not straying off during the night. He found a good place for  the herd, and catching a fresh horse, he picketed him close to where he  was going to sleep, and wrapping himself in his blanket, was soon fast  asleep. So tired and sleepy was he that a heavy rain which had come up,  during the night, soaked him through and through, but he never awakened  until the sun was high in the east.    He awoke and going to the place where he had left the herd, he was  glad to find them all there. He mounted his horse and started his herd  homeward again. For two days he drove them, and on the evening of the  second day he came in sight of the village.    The older warriors, hearing of the young man going on this trip alone  and unarmed, told the parents to go in mourning for their son, as he  would never come back alive. When the people of the village saw this  large drove of horses advancing towards them, they at first thought  it was a war party of the enemy, and so the head men called the young  warriors together and fully prepared for a great battle. They advanced  upon the supposed enemy. When they got close enough to discern a lone  horseman driving this large herd, they surrounded the horses and lone  warrior, and brought him triumphantly into camp. On arriving in the camp  (or village) the horses were counted and the number counted up to one  hundred and ten head.    The chief and his criers (or heralds) announced through the whole  village that there would be a great war dance given in honor of the Lone  Warrior.    The whole village turned out and had a great war dance that was kept  up three days and three nights. The two scalps which the young man had  taken were tied to a pole which was placed in the center of the dance  circle. At this dance, the Lone Warrior gave to each poor family five  head of horses.    Being considered eligible now to pay his respects to any girl who took  his fancy, he at once went to the camp of the beautiful girl of the  tribe, and as he was always her choice, she at once consented to marry  him.    The news spread through the village that Lone Warrior had won the belle  of the nation for his bride, and this with the great feat which he had  accomplished alone in killing two enemies and bringing home a great herd  of horses, raised him to the rank of chief, which he faithfully filled  to the end of his days. And many times he had to tell his grandchildren  the story of how he got the name of the Lone Warrior.              THE SIOUX WHO MARRIED THE CROW CHIEF'S DAUGHTER    A war party of seven young men, seeing a lone tepee standing on the edge  of a heavy belt of timber, stopped and waited for darkness, in order to  send one of their scouts ahead to ascertain whether the camp which they  had seen was the camp of friend or enemy.    When darkness had settled down on them, and they felt secure in not  being detected, they chose one of their scouts to go on alone and find  out what would be the best direction for them to advance upon the camp,  should it prove to be an enemy.    Among the scouts was one who was noted for his bravery, and many were  the brave acts he had performed. His name was Big Eagle. This man they  selected to go to the lone camp and obtain the information for which  they were waiting.    Big Eagle was told to look carefully over the ground and select the best  direction from which they should make the attack. The other six would  await his return. He started on his mission, being careful not to make  any noise. He stealthily approached the camp. As he drew near to the  tent he was surprised to note the absence of any dogs, as these animals  are always kept by the Sioux to notify the owners by their barking of  the approach of anyone. He crawled up to the tepee door, and peeping  through a small aperture, he saw three persons sitting inside. An  elderly man and woman were sitting at the right of the fireplace, and a  young woman at the seat of honor, opposite the door.    Big Eagle had been married and his wife had died five winters previous  to the time of this episode. He had never thought of marrying again, but  when he looked upon this young woman he thought he was looking upon the  face of his dead wife. He removed his cartridge belts and knife, and  placing them, along with his rifle, at the side of the tent, he at once  boldly stepped inside the tepee, and going over to the man, extended his  hand and shook first the man's hand, then the old woman's, and lastly  the young woman's. Then he seated himself by the side of the girl, and  thus they sat, no one speaking.    Finally, Big Eagle made signs to the man, explaining as well as possible  by signs, that his wife had died long ago, and when he saw the girl she  so strongly resembled his dead wife that he wished to marry her, and  he would go back to the enemy's camp and live with them, if they would  consent to the marriage of their daughter.    The old man seemed to understand, and Big Eagle again made signs to him  that a party were lying in wait just a short distance from his camp.  Noiselessly they brought in the horses, and taking down the tent, they  at once moved off in the direction from whence they had come. The war  party waited all night, and when the first rays of dawn disclosed to  them the absence of the tepee, they at once concluded that Big Eagle had  been discovered and killed, so they hurriedly started on their trail for  home.    In the meantime, the hunting party, for this it was that Big Eagle  had joined, made very good time in putting a good distance between  themselves and the war party. All day they traveled, and when evening  came they ascended a high hill, looking down into the valley on the  other side. There stretched for two miles, along the banks of a small  stream, an immense camp. The old man made signs for Big Eagle to remain  with the two women where he was, until he could go to the camp and  prepare them to receive an enemy into their village.    The old man rode through the camp and drew up at the largest tepee in  the village. Soon Big Eagle could see men gathering around the tepee.  The crowd grew larger and larger, until the whole village had assembled  at the large tepee. Finally they dispersed, and catching their horses,  mounted and advanced to the hill on which Big Eagle and the two women  were waiting. They formed a circle around them and slowly they returned  to the village, singing and riding in a circle around them.    When they arrived at the village they advanced to the large tepee, and  motioned Big Eagle to the seat of honor in the tepee. In the village was  a man who understood and spoke the Sioux language. He was sent for, and  through him the oath of allegiance to the Crow tribe was taken by Big  Eagle. This done he was presented with the girl to wife, and also with  many spotted ponies.    Big Eagle lived with his wife among her people for two years, and during  this time he joined in four different battles between his own people  (the Sioux) and the Crow people, to whom his wife belonged.    In no battle with his own people would he carry any weapons, only a long  willow coup-stick, with which he struck the fallen Sioux.    At the expiration of two years he concluded to pay a visit to his own  tribe, and his father-in-law, being a chief of high standing, at once  had it heralded through the village that his son-in-law would visit his  own people, and for them to show their good will and respect for him by  bringing ponies for his son-in-law to take back to his people.    Hearing this, the herds were all driven in and all day long horses were  brought to the tent of Big Eagle, and when he was ready to start on his  homeward trip, twenty young men were elected to accompany him to within  a safe distance of his village. The twenty young men drove the gift  horses, amounting to two hundred and twenty head, to within one day's  journey of the village of Big Eagle, and fearing for their safety from  his people, Big Eagle sent them back to their own village.    On his arrival at his home village, they received him as one returned  from the dead, as they were sure he had been killed the night he had  been sent to reconnoiter the lone camp. There was great feasting and  dancing in honor of his return, and the horses were distributed among  the needy ones of the village.    Remaining at his home village for a year, he one day made up his mind  to return to his wife's people. A great many fancy robes, dresses, war  bonnets, moccasins, and a great drove of horses were given him, and his  wife, and he bade farewell to his people for good, saying, \"I will never  return to you again, as I have decided to live the remainder of my days  with my wife's people.\"    On his arrival at the village of the Crows, he found his father-in-law  at the point of death. A few days later the old man died, and Big Eagle  was appointed to fill the vacancy of chief made by the death of his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3410"],[0,"The American Spirit in Literature: A Chronicle of Great Interpreters (#10)"],[1,", the year of Thomas Paine's  death. \"The Crisis,\" a series of thirteen pamphlets, of which the first  was issued in December, 1776, seemed to justify the contemporary opinion  that the \"American cause owed as much to the pen of Paine as to the  sword of Washington.\" Paine, who was now serving in the army, might have  heard his own words, \"These are the times that try men's souls,\" read  aloud, by Washington's orders, to the ragged troops just before they  crossed the Delaware to win the victory of Trenton. The best known  productions of Paine's subsequent career, \"The Rights of Man\" and \"The  Age of Reason,\" were written in Europe, but they were read throughout  America. The reputation of the \"rebellious Staymaker\" has suffered from  certain grimy habits and from the ridiculous charge of atheism. He was  no more an atheist than Franklin or Jefferson. In no sense an original  thinker, he could impart to outworn shreds of deistic controversy and  to shallow generalizations about democracy a personal fervor which  transformed them and made his pages gay and bold and clear as a trumpet.    Clear and bold and gay was Alexander Hamilton likewise; and his literary  services to the Revolution are less likely to be underestimated than  Thomas Paine's. They began with that boyish speech in \"the Fields\" of  New York City in 1774 and with \"The Farmer Refuted,\" a reply to Samuel  Seabury's \"Westchester Farmer.\" They were continued in extraordinary  letters, written during Hamilton's military career, upon the defects of  the Articles of Confederation and of the finances of the Confederation.  Hamilton contributed but little to the actual structure of the new  Constitution, but as a debater he fought magnificently and triumphantly  for its adoption by the Convention of the State of New York in 1788.  Together with Jay and Madison he defended the fundamental principles  of the Federal Union in the remarkable series of papers known as the  \"Federalist.\" These eighty-five papers, appearing over the signature  \"Publius\" in two New York newspapers between October, 1787, and April,  1788, owed their conception largely to Hamilton, who wrote more than  half of them himself. In manner they are not unlike the substantial  Whig literature of England, and in political theory they have little in  common with the Revolutionary literature which we have been considering.  The reasoning is close, the style vigorous but neither warmed by passion  nor colored by the individual emotions of the author. The \"Federalist\"  remains a classic example of the civic quality of our post-Revolutionary  American political writing, broadly social in its outlook, well informed  as to the past, confident--but not reckless--of the future. Many  Americans still read it who would be shocked by Tom Paine and bored  with Edmund Burke. It has none of the literary genius of either of those  writers, but its formative influence upon successive generations of  political thinking has been steadying and sound.    In fact, our citizen literature cannot be understood aright if one fails  to observe that its effect has often turned, not upon mere verbal skill,  but upon the weight of character behind the words. Thus the grave and  reserved George Washington says of the Constitution of 1787: \"Let us  raise a standard to which the wise and the honest can repair; the event  is in the hand of God.\" The whole personality of the great Virginian is  back of that simple, perfect sentence. It brings us to our feet, like a  national anthem.    One American, no doubt our most gifted man of letters of that century,  passed most of the Revolutionary period abroad, in the service of his  country. Benjamin Franklin was fifty-nine in the year of the Stamp Act.  When he returned from France in 1785 he was seventy-nine, but he was  still writing as admirably as ever when he died at eighty-four. We  cannot dismiss this singular, varied, and fascinating American better  than by quoting the letter which George Washington wrote to him in  September, 1789. It has the dignity and formality of the eighteenth  century, but it is warm with tested friendship and it glows with deep  human feeling: \"If to be venerated for benevolence, if to be admired  for talents, if to be esteemed for patriotism, if to be beloved for  philanthropy, can gratify the human mind, you must have the pleasing  consolation to know that you have not lived in vain. And I flatter  myself that it will not be ranked among the least grateful occurrences  of your life to be assured, that, so long as I retain my memory, you  will be recollected with respect, veneration, and affection by your  sincere friend, George Washington.\"    There remains another Virginian, the symbol of the Revolutionary age,  the author of words more widely known around the globe than any other  words penned by an American. \"Thomas Jefferson,\" writes the latest of  his successors in the Presidency, \"was not a man of the people, but he  was a man of such singular insight that he saw that all the roots of  generous power come from the people.\" On his father's side Jefferson  came from sound yeoman stock, in which Welsh blood ran. His mother was  a Virginia Randolph. Born in Albemarle County, near the \"little  mountain\"--Monticello--where he built a mansion for his bride and where  he lies buried, the tall, strong, red-haired, gray-eyed, gifted boy was  reputed the best shot, the best rider, the best fiddle-player in the  county. He studied hard at William and Mary over his Greek, Latin,  French, Italian, and Spanish, but he also frequented the best society of  the little capital. He learned to call himself a Deist and to theorize  about ideal commonwealths. There was already in him that latent  radicalism which made him strike down, as soon as he had the power, two  of the fundamental principles of the society into which he was born, the  principle of entailed property and that of church establishment.    Such was the youth of twenty-two who was thrilled in 1765 by the Stamp  Act. In the ten years of passionate discussion which followed, two  things became clear: first, that there had long existed among the  colonists very radical theoretical notions of political freedom; and  second, that there was everywhere a spirit of practical conservatism.  Jefferson illustrates the union of these two tendencies.    He took his seat in the Continental Congress in June, 1775. He was  only thirty-two, but he had already written, in the summer of 1774, \"A  Summary View of the Rights of British America\" which had been published  in England by Burke, himself a judge of good writing and sound politics.  Jefferson had also prepared in 1775 the \"Address of the Virginia House  of Burgesses.\" For these reasons he was placed at the head of the  Committee for drafting the Declaration of Independence. We need not  linger over the familiar circumstances of its composition. Everybody  knows how Franklin and Adams made a few verbal alterations in the first  draft, how the committee of five then reported it to the Congress, which  proceeded to cut out about one-fourth of the matter, while Franklin  tried to comfort the writhing author with his cheerful story about the  sign of John Thompson the hatter. Forty-seven years afterwards, in reply  to the charge of lack of originality brought against the Declaration by  Timothy Pickering and John Adams--charges which have been repeated at  intervals ever since--Jefferson replied philosophically: \"Whether I  gathered my ideas from reading or reflection I do not know. I know only  that I turned neither to book nor pamphlet while writing it. I did not  consider it as any part of my charge to invent new ideas altogether  and to offer no sentiment which had ever been expressed before.\" O wise  young man, and fundamentally Anglo-Saxon young man, to turn his back,  in that crisis, to the devil of mere cleverness, and stick to recognized  facts and accepted sentiments! But his pen retains its cunning in spite  of him; and the drop of hot Welsh blood tells; and the cosmopolitan  reading and thinking tell; and they transform what Pickering called a  \"commonplace compilation, its sentiments hackneyed in Congress for two  years before,\" into an immortal manifesto to mankind.    Its method is the simplest. The preamble is philosophical, dealing with  \"self-evident\" truths. Today the men who dislike or doubt these truths  dismiss the preamble as \"theoretical,\" or, to use another term of  derogation favored by reactionaries, \"French.\" But if the preamble be  French and philosophical, the specific charges against the King are very  English and practical. Here are certain facts, presented no doubt with  consummate rhetorical skill, but facts, undeniably. The Anglo-Saxon in  Jefferson is basal, racial; the turn for academic philosophizing after  the French fashion is personal, acquired; but the range and sweep and  enduring vitality of this matchless state paper lie in its illumination  of stubborn facts by general principles, its decent respect to the  opinions of mankind, its stately and noble utterance of national  sentiments and national reasons to a \"candid world.\"    It has long been the fashion, among a certain school of half-hearted  Americans--and unless I am mistaken, the teaching has increased during  the last decades--to minimize the value of Jefferson's \"self-evident  truths.\" Rufus Choate, himself a consummate rhetorician, sneered at  those \"glittering generalities,\" and countless college-bred men, some of  them occupying the highest positions, have echoed the sneer. The essence  of the objection to Jefferson's platform lies of course in his  phrase, \"all men are created equal,\" with the subsidiary phrase  about governments \"deriving their just powers from the consent of the  governed.\" Editors and congressmen and even college professors  have proclaimed themselves unable to assent to these phrases of the  Declaration, and unable even to"]]]
