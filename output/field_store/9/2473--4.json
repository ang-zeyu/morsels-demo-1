It was very sad work. Luckily we had  no man hit. I don't know what we should have done if we had. I suppose  we should have remained there and taken the inevitable consequences, as  we would not have left them. We left at 8 P.M., and arrived at Tuli at 1  P.M. next day, only two halts, one and a half in the night for sleep,  and another of half-an-hour for breakfast, which for me and most of us  consisted of water. I had nothing to eat except one small cookie from 8  A.M. the morning of the fight to 2 P.M. the next day.    \"Altogether, we marched forty miles through awful country, for a long  way through brushwood called the 'wait-a-bit' thorn, and in the night,  too; it tore our clothes, hands, arms, and faces to bits; then through  sand, over kopjes covered with thick brush. Altogether it was equal to  sixty miles of English roads, and we went pretty fast when the way  allowed. We had one pleasant surprise; one of our officers left us and  rode on to Tuli when we were about ten miles off, and reported that we  were only a few miles out, pretty dead-beat, as we were. Until Captain  Glynne arrived, they believed we were all cut up, and one of the  squadrons rode out to us and lent us their horses, for which we were  very grateful. They met us about three miles out, and I'm blowed if I  know how we could have crawled in without them; we were absolutely  dead-beat. I was never so glad of a ride in my life. When we got into  camp, we found that three or four of the men of E squadron, who had been  left behind at Tuli sick, or had come in riding with dispatches, had  prepared food for us, which was also very grateful, for we wanted it. We  had left most of our kit behind at Tuli, so we were able to have a  change of clothes and a wash, both very much needed, and then I must say  I did enjoy myself. It was simply delightful to lie down and loaf about  and do nothing but smoke cigarettes. All the bitterness of the defeat  and the loss of our horses seemed to disappear, and I thoroughly enjoyed  myself that afternoon.    \"At Tuli every one believed we were cut up. A party from there,  twenty-five in number, when escorting some waggons to us, were attacked  by a much superior force at Brice's Store and badly defeated. They had  to take to the bush and abandon the waggons. They brought four men  wounded back, while seven were missing, including the parson, who was  coming to see us--he was wounded in the leg. According to the men who  were there, he was taking a distinctly active part in the fight. A  squadron of some of the police, about 120 in all, were sent out to try  and relieve us, but near the store were met by some of the boys who had  bolted from us, and who reported that we were already wiped out, every  man killed; so they returned without trying to force their way through  to us. In Tuli they were much relieved to hear of our safe arrival. It  was certainly a very narrow squeak for us; it is still a wonder to me  how we managed to escape without losing a man. Certainly we had very  good cover, and took advantage of it; it was the only thing we could do.  We managed to silence their rifle-fire once or twice, but could do  nothing against their long-range shell-fire. Since then we have had very  little to do, but expect to have some more fighting before long, when we  hope to get a bit of our own back. One thing I think I may say without  boasting--we all behaved very well. There was not a sign of funk, and  every one took it coolly. As a matter of fact, more than half of E  squadron had been under fire before, either in Rhodesia or elsewhere.\"    To understand the effect of war upon Rhodesia at this time, we must read  the following extracts from a letter written by a \"Son of the Manse\" in  business near Buluwayo, dated 11th November 1899:--\"We have been cut off  from the south for more than five weeks, and are very badly off for  news. Such news as we get comes by Beira, and as there is no cable  between Delagoa Bay and Beira, this makes things worse. We have heard  nothing from Mafeking since its investment by the Boers except a couple  of messages sent out by a native runner to the nearest telegraph office  still in touch with Buluwayo. A number of men from here are on the  southern frontier keeping the Boers in check, so as to prevent them  making a raid in this direction. They have had several skirmishes, but  the Boers are not in any great force, as they appear to have  concentrated their men on the Natal border, where most of the fighting  will probably take place. Business is so slow here that numbers can get  leave from their offices for the asking, and there were lots of fellows  in town doing nothing who were only too glad of the chance of earning  10s. a day, which the Government are paying the Volunteers. The local  newspaper here is of little use at present, as it has not funds to get  direct news from Natal, and the only reliable information we get is  published by the authorities. The _Chronicle_ here came out with a  special edition yesterday, describing a serious reverse to the British  (two thousand men and forty-six officers captured), but it turned out to  be taken from a German paper published in Zanzibar and sent to Beira,  and I trust it may prove false. We won't get any newspapers, I fear, as  long as the mails come _via_ Beira, owing to the cost of bringing them  from Salisbury by coach, but we hope there will be a change for the  better soon. When the newspapers come they will be interesting  reading.... The stoppage of the railway has had a serious effect in  Buluwayo, as it has caused a tremendous rise in the prices of  everything, and if most of the merchants had not laid in immense stocks  in anticipation of what was coming, things would be very much worse.  Some articles are very scarce. Potatoes are about L5 a sack, and of very  inferior quality. Sugar is 9d. to 1s. per lb.; and a 200-lb. sack of  flour costs 50s. to 60s., cheaper than most things, as there was an  enormous stock stored. Everything is likely to go up still higher before  supplies can reach the town, and fresh meal will soon be practically  unattainable, and every one will have to depend on tinned meat. There  are no colonial eggs coming up, so we are getting about 5s. a dozen for  ours, and the price will probably rise, as with everything else. Some of  the restaurants and hotels have had to close their dining-room, as so  many men have gone to the front. The demand for eggs and fuel (wood) is,  therefore, somewhat decreased. Several storekeepers talk of getting  things from Salisbury, and if prices rise very much perhaps it would  pay. The average rate per waggon to Salisbury lately was nearly 25s. per  100 lbs. weight. The mines are still working fairly, and may be kept on.  The Kaffirs round here seem to take little interest in the war, and the  most of them have not the remotest idea where Natal is, although the  Matabele came from there less than seventy years ago. Of course they all  know the Boers, and thoroughly detest them, as they have very good  reason to do. We have only had a few showers of rain here so far, and  the grass is very poor. We can work our donkeys much at present on that  account, as I want to have them in good order, as transport will be very  high when communications are again established.\"    In Southern Rhodesia the Boers were kept in check by the activities of  Colonel Holdsworth. In order to reconnoitre, and, if possible, attack  the Boer laager at Sekwani, he started on the 23rd of November with  seventy-five mounted men and ten cyclists on a night march over sandy  roads in a region where water was extremely scarce. At daybreak they  reached the Dutch laager and caught the Boers napping. Lieutenant  Llewellyn wished them an energetic \"Good morning\" by means of a Maxim  gun at 1000 to 1200 yards range, with the result that the enemy, about  eighty strong, were routed from their position among the kopjes. The  Boers retired to other kopjes, and from thence offered resistance, but  as storming them would have entailed considerable loss, the British  force returned to camp. They, however, burned a large store of  ammunition and captured some rifles. Therefore their hundred-mile march,  accomplished in twenty-three hours, was not profitless.      MAFEKING, NOVEMBER    Poor Mafeking! The inevitable hung like a ghost over  everything--bodiless, formless, but always there at the elbows of the  gallant band that so long had held out against the foe. He was now  coming closer--closer, continuing to sap and approach by parallels, till  before long not only shells but rifle-fire would render streets  impassable, shelters useless, and fortified positions dangerous. Colonel  Baden-Powell's brilliant wits were hard pressed to keep the enemy from  carrying the town by storm, and all who valued their lives lived  underground, burrowing like rabbits, or in bomb-proof shelters, from  which occasionally they were routed, not by fire but by water.    Still the word surrender was unspelt. None dared breathe it aloud. A  battery of seven field-guns blazing their hot fire and doing their fell  work made no effect--the besieged remained firm. Mauser bullets whizzed  past their ears; shells long as coal-scuttles and nearly as thick  crashed into buildings, now into the hospital, now the convent, or  sometimes into the women's laager, leaving not seldom a track of  mourning and blood; but the Boer could not plume himself on victory. Not  so far off his white tents reflected the sunlight, and closer still the  grim music of his rifles was eternally to be heard; but inside the  little town were men who were developing from mere men of commerce into  toughened warriors, and assisting Colonel Baden-Powell and his  diminutive force to maintain the majesty of Great Britain, with a  chivalry that might have done honour "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3689"],[0,"Letters of Franz Liszt -- Volume 1 (#10)"],[1,"dear Mr.  Hartel, how much I am put out by this precipitate publication.  Independently of the material wrong it does me (for before  sending them to you these Melodies were sold in London and  Paris), I am thus unable to keep my word to Beale and Richault,  who expected to publish them simultaneously with you.    The evil being irremediable I have only thought how to get a  prompt vengeance out of it. You will tell me later on if you  think it was really a Christian vengeance.    The matter is this: I have just added a tremendous cadenza, three  pages long, in small notes, and anentire Coda, almost as long, to  Beethoven's \"Adelaide\". I played it all without being hissed at  the concert given at the Paris Conservatoire for the Beethoven  Monument, and I intend to play it in London, and in Germany and  Russia. Schlesinger has printed all this medley, such as it is.  Will you do the same? In that case, as I care chiefly for your  edition, I will beg you to have the last Coda printed in small  notes as an Ossia, without taking away anything from the present  edition, so that the purists can play the integral text only, if  the commentary is displeasing to them.    It was certainly a very delicate matter to touch \"Adelaide\", and  yet it seemed to me necessary to venture. Have I done it with  propriety and taste? Competent judges will decide.    In any case I beg you not to let any one but Mr. Schumann look  over your edition.    In conclusion allow me to remind you that I was rather badly paid  for \"Adelaide\" formerly, and if you should think proper to send  me a draft on a London bank, fair towards you and myself, I shall  always receive it with a \"new pleasure\"--to quote the favorite  words of His Majesty the King of the French.    With kind regards, believe me, my dear sir, yours most sincerely,    F. Liszt    Be so kind as to remember me very affectionately to Mendelssohn.  As for Schumann, I shall write to him direct very shortly.        32. To Simon Lowy In Vienna    [Autograph in the possession of Madame Emilie Dore in Vienna.]    London, May 20th, 1841    I am still writing to you from England, my dear friend. Since my  last letter (end of December, I think) I have completed my tour  of the three kingdoms (by which I lose, by the way, 1000 pounds  sterling net, on 1500 pounds which my engagement brought me!),  have ploughed my way through Belgium, with which I have every  reason to be satisfied, and have sauntered about in Paris for six  weeks. This latter, I don't hide it from you, has been a real  satisfaction to my self-love. On arriving there I compared myself  (pretty reasonably, it seems to me) to a man playing ecarte for  the fifth point. Well, I have had king and vole,--seven points  rather than five! [The \"fifth\" is the highest in this game, so  Liszt means that he won.]    My two concerts alone, and especially the third, at the  Conservatoire, for the Beethoven Monument, are concerts out of  the ordinary run, such as I only can give in Europe at the  present moment.    The accounts in the papers can only have given you a very  incomplete idea. Without self-conceit or any illusion, I think I  may say that never has so striking an effect, so complete and so  irresistible, been produced by an instrumentalist in Paris.    A propos of newspapers, I am sending you, following this, the  article which Fetis (formerly my most redoubtable antagonist) has  just published in the \"Gazette Musicale\". It is written very  cleverly, and summarises the question well. If Fischhof [A  musician, a Professor at the Vienna Conservatorium.] translated  it for Bauerle [Editor of the Theater-Zeitung (Theatrical  Times).] it would make a good effect, I fancy. However, do what  you like with it.    I shall certainly be on the Rhine towards the end of July, and  shall remain in that neighborhood till September. If Fischhof  came there I should be delighted to see him and have a talk with  him. Till then give him my most affectionate compliments, and  tell him to write me a few lines before he starts.    In November I shall start for Berlin, and shall pass the whole of  next winter in Russia.    Haslinger's behaviour to me is more than inexcusable. The dear  man is doing a stupidity of which he will repent soon. Never  mind; I will not forget how devoted he was to me during my first  stay in Vienna.    Would you believe that he has not sent me a word in reply to four  consecutive letters I have written to him? If you pass by Graben  will you be so kind as to tell him that I shall not write to him  any more, but that I expect from him, as an honest man of  business, if not as a friend, a line to tell me the fate of two  manuscripts (\"Hongroises,\" and \"Canzone Veneziane\") which I sent  him.    I have just discovered a new mine of \"Fantaisies\"--and I am  working it hard. \"Norma,\" \"Don Juan,\" \"Sonnambula,\" \"Maometto,\"  and \"Moise\" heaped one on the top of the other, and \"Freischutz\"  and \"Robert le Diable\" are pieces of 96, and even of 200, like  the old canons of the Republic of Geneva, I think. When I have  positively finished my European tour I shall come and play them  to you in Vienna, and however tired they may be there of having  applauded me so much, I still feel the power to move this public,  so intelligent and so thoroughly appreciative,--a public which I  have always considered as the born judge of a pianist.    Adieu, my dear Lowy--write soon, and address, till June 15th, at  18, Great Marlborough Street, and after that Paris.    Yours most sincerely,    F. Liszt    Is the Ungher [Caroline Ungher, afterwards Ungher-Sabatier, a  celebrated singer.] at Vienna? Will you kindly give or send to  her the letter which follows?    Have you, yes or no, sent off the two amber pieces which I gave  you at the time of my departure? I have been to fetch them from  the Embassy, but they were not there. Let me have two words in  reply about this.        33. To Franz von Schober    Truly, dear friend, I should like pages, days, years, to answer  your dear letter. Seldom has anything touched me so deeply. Take  heart for heart, and soul for soul,--and let us be for ever  friends.    You know how I am daily getting more concise; therefore nothing  further about myself, nothing further about Berlin. Tomorrow,  Thursday, at 2 o'clock, I start for Petersburg.    I have spoken to A. It is impossible on both sides. When we meet  and you are perfectly calm, we will go into details. I still hope  to meet you next autumn, either in Florence or on the Rhine.    Leo [Count Festetics] has written to me again. Write to me at  once to Konigsberg, to tell me where to address my next letter to  you. But write directly-simply your address.    I have sent all the proofs of your pamphlet to Brockhaus. Be so  good as to give him direct your final orders in regard to this  publication. I shall be so pleased to have some copies of it  while I am in  Petersburg. The subject is very congenial to  me; I thank you once more most warmly for it.    One more shake of the hand in Germany, dearest friend, and in  heartfelt love yours ever,    F. Liszt    Remember me kindly to Sabatier, [The husband of Caroline Ungher,  the celebrated singer previously mentioned.] and don't quarrel  with him about me. To Caroline always the same friendship and  devotion.    Berlin, March 3rd, 1842.        34. To the faculty of philosophy at the university of Konigsberg.    [Printed in L. Ramann's \"Franz Liszt,\" vol. ii., I.]    Much Esteemed and Learned Gentlemen,    It is in vain for me to attempt to express to you the deep and  heartfelt emotion you have aroused in me by your rare mark of  honor. The dignity of Doctor, granted by a Faculty in which, as  in yours, men of European celebrity assemble, makes me happy, and  would make me proud, were I not also convinced of the sense in  which it is granted to me.    I repeat that, with the honorable name of Teacher of Music (and I  refer to music in its grand, complete, and ancient  signification), by which you, esteemed gentlemen, dignify me, I  am well aware that I have undertaken the duty of unceasing  learning and untiring labour.    In the constant fulfillment of this duty-to maintain the dignity  of Doctor in a right and worthy manner, by propagating in word  and deed the little portion of knowledge and technical skill  which I can call my own, as a form of, and a means to, the True  [\"The beautiful is the glory of the true, Art is the radiancy of  thought.\" (Author's note.)] and the Divine--    In the constant fulfillment of this duty, and in any results  which are granted to me, the remembrance of your good wishes, and  of the touching manner in which a distinguished member of your  Faculty [Professors Rosenkranz and Jacobi invested Liszt with the  Doctor's Diploma.] has informed me of them, will be a living  support to me.    Accept, gentlemen, the expression of my highest esteem and  respect.    F. Liszt    Mittau, March 18th, 1842        35. To Court-Marshal Freiherr von Spiegel at Weimar    [Given by L. Ramann, \"Franz Liszt,\" vol. ii., 1.]    Monsieur le Baron,    It is very difficult to reply to so gracefully flattering a  letter as your Excellency has been good enough to write to me.    I must nevertheless say that I wish with all my heart and in all  ways that I could answer it. I shall reach Weimar, bag and  baggage, towards the middle of October, and if I succeed in  communicating to others a little of the satisfaction I cannot  fail to find there, thanks to the gracious kindness of their  Highnesses and the friendly readiness of your Excellency, I shall  be only too glad.    Meanwhile I beg to remain, Monsieur le Baron, with respectful  compliments,    Yours obediently,    Cologne; September 12th, 1862. F. Liszt        36. To Carl Filitsch.
