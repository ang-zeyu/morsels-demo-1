Just then I saw Bob turn his horse, and race straight toward me;  and when I looked in the direction he was going, I saw more cattle.  I went for them with a clear start of a hundred yards, and would have won easy,  only that I saw they were station cattle; and at the same time  I caught sight of another little lot in a hollow to the left,  and Bat travelling for them.  I slewed round, and gave him a gallop for it,  but he won by fifty yards.  However, there was only five of our lot  in the little mob.  There was thirteen wanted still; and Bob had possession  of them among the station cattle.  So they got eighteen altogether,  and we only got sixteen, after running the legs off our horses.\"    \"Port Phillip,\" observed Cooper pointedly.    \"Another time, going on for three years ago,\" continued Thompson,  \"Bob had me as cheap as dirt for the whole twenty, while Bat snapped  Potter's horses the same night.  That was on Wo-Winya again--shortly before  M'Gregor sold the station to Stoddart, and just before the two of them  were sent out to the Diamantina\"----    \"M'Gregor and Stoddart, of course?\" I gently suggested.    \"Yes, Tom; I thought I made that clear.\"    \"So you did, Steve.  I beg pardon.\"    \"Don't mention it, Tom.\"    True friendship lay underneath this severity, for when Thompson got started  on his reminiscences, he was apt to continue indefinitely,  to the ruin of his own dignity.    \"But why this solicitude and panic over being detected in trifling trespass?\"  asked Willoughby.  \"Like most things in this country, it appears to be  purely a matter of Â£ s. d.  Now, I have taken the liberty of totting up,  in my own mind, some of your earnings.  Will Thompson permit me to take  his case as an illustration?  I find, Thompson, that the tariff of your wool  is exactly sevenpence half-penny per ton per mile.  You have eight tons  on your wagon at the present time.  This will give you five shillings  for each mile you travel.  You have travelled ten miles to-day\"----    \"Sabbath day's journey,\" sighed Thompson.    ----\"that is two pounds ten.  Now,--all things considered--an occasional  penalty of, say, one pound, appears to me by no means ruinous.  It is not to be mentioned in comparison with other losses which you have been  unfortunate enough to sustain, yet it appears to be your chief grievance.\"    \"Yes; that's one way of looking at it,\" muttered Thompson, after a pause.  The other fellows were silently and futilely wrestling with  the apparent anomaly.  A metaphysical question keeps slipping away  from the grasp of the bullock driver's mind like a wet melon-seed.    [Yet the solution is simple.  The up-country man is decidedly openhanded;  he will submit to crushing losses with cheerfulness, tempered, of course,  by humility in those cases where he recognises the operation  of an overhanging curse; he will subscribe to any good or bad cause  with a liberality excelled only by the digger; he will pay gambling debts  with the easy, careless grace which makes every P. of W.  so popular  in English sporting circles--in a word, the smallest of his many sins  is parsimony.  But the penal suggestiveness of trespass--  penalty touches the sullen dignity of his nature; and the vague,  but well-grounded fear of a law made and administered solely by  his natural enemies makes him feel about as apprehensive as John Bunyan,  though certainly more dangerous.  Of course, Willoughby, born and bred  a member of the governing class, could n't easily conceive the dismay  with which these outlaws regarded legal seizure for trespass--  or possibly prosecution in courts dominated by squatters.]    \"I knows wun respectable man with two teams wot's seed the time  he'd emp'y a double-barr'll gun on them two fellers jis' same's if they was  wild dogs,\" remarked Price ominously.  \"I happen ter mind me o' wun time  this man hed ter fetch hees las' wool right on ter Deniliquin,  f'm Hay, f'r two-five hextry, 'count o' there bein' no river that season.  An' that man 'e war shaddered hevery day acrost Wo-Winyar,  an' hees bullicks collared hevery night with Bob or Bat; an' them bullicks  har'ly fit ter crawl with fair poverty.  Dirty!  W'y, Chows ain't in it  with them varmin f'r dirtiness.\"  Here followed a steady torrent  of red vituperation, showing that Price took a strong personal interest  in the respectable man with the two teams.    \"To my (adj.) knowledge, they dummied land for ole M'Gregor,  an' never got a cent for it,\" remarked Dixon.  \"Same time, I got nothin' to say  agen 'em, for they never got a slant to snavel my lot.  Brothers--ain't they?\"    \"No (adj.) fear,\" replied Mosey.  \"You never seen brothers hangin' together  like them chaps.  I know some drovers that's been prayin'  for theyre (adj.) souls every night for years, on account o' the way  they used to rush travellin' stock across M'Gregor's runs.  Whenever there was dirty work to be did, them two blokes was on hand to do it.  An' I got it on good authority that they chanced three years chokey  for perjury, when they was dummyin' for M'Gregor; an' all they got for it  was the fright hangin' over them.  A man should n't make a dog of his self  without he's well paid for it.  That's my (adj.) religion.\"    \"So far as dummying is concerned.\" said I; \"no one except their Maker  and M'Gregor knows how the thing was worked.  But if they had owned  all the land they secured for M'Gregor, by perjury, and personation,  and straightforward dummyism, they would have been little squatters themselves.  At the same time, they were true-hearted, kindly, unselfish men,  according to their uncertain light; and in all probability  they're gone to heaven.  Such is life, boys.\"    \"Anyhow, they ain't goin' to trouble us no furder,\" rejoined Mosey  complacently.  \"Theyre toes is turned up.  Lis'n!--that's the sound  I like to hear!\" The sound was the deep, heavy sough of a contented bullock,  as he lay down with a couple of days' rations in his capacious first stomach.    \"Grass is generally a burning question with you teamsters,\"  observed Willoughby.    \"I never make no insinuations, myself,\" replied Dixon coldly.    \"Good!\" interjected Mosey.  \"If you was inclined that road,  you might say the carrier's got as much interest in the grass as a squatter.  It's the traveller as don't give a (compound expletive) if the whole country's  as black as Ole Nick's soot-brush.\"    \"Well, I s'pose that's about a fair thing for to-night,\" remarked Cooper;  and he pulled off his boots, preparatory to wrapping himself in his blanket.  \"Time to vong tong cooshey, as the Frenchman says.  Must n't oversleep  in the mornin', if the place is ever so safe.\"    Then I disposed my possum rug and saddle, took off my boots, spread my coat  for Pup to sleep on, lit my pipe, and lay down for the night.  Thompson, Mosey, and Willoughby arranged themselves here and there,  according to taste.  Dixon and Methuselah retired to hammocks  under the rear of their respective wagons.  Bum simply lay where he was.  I would do my companions what honour I can, but the stern code  of the chronicler permits no quibbling with the fact that Mosey and Bum  wound up the evening with a series of gestes and apothegms,  such as must not tarnish these pages--Willoughby occasionally taking part,  rather, I think, through courtesy than sympathy, and ably closing the service  with a fescennine anecdote, beginning, 'It is related that, on one occasion,  the late Marquis of Waterford'----    Willoughby had selected a smooth place near my own lair.  Here he spent  five minutes in spreading his exceptionally dirty blanket,  and another five in tidily folding his ragged coat for a pillow.  Then he removed his unmatched boots, and, unlapping from his feet  the inexpensive substitute for socks known as 'prince-alberts,'  he artistically spread the redolent swaths across his boots to receive  the needed benefit of the night air; performing all these little offices  with an unconscious elegance amusing to notice--an elegance  which not another member of our party could have achieved,  any more than Willoughby could have acquired the practical effectiveness  of a good rough average vulgarian.    Poor shadow of departed exclusiveness!--lying there, with none so poor  to do him reverence!  He was a type--and, by reason of his happy temperament,  an exceedingly favourable type--of the 'gentleman,' shifting for himself  under normal conditions of back-country life.  Urbane address,  faultless syntax, even that good part which shall not be taken away,  namely, the calm consciousness of inherent superiority, are of little use here.  And yet your Australian novelist finds no inconsistency in placing  the bookish student, or the city dandy, many degrees above the bushman,  or the digger, or the pioneer, in vocations which have been the life-work  of the latter.  O, the wearisome nonsense of this kind which is  remorselessly thrust upon a docile public!  And what an opportunity  for some novelist, in his rabid pursuit of originality, to merely reverse  the incongruity--picturing a semi-barbarian, lassoed full-grown,  and launched into polished society, there to excel the fastidious idlers  of drawing-room and tennis-court in their own line! This miracle  would be more reasonable than its antithesis.  Without doubt,  it is easier to acquire gentlemanly deportment than axe-man's muscle;  easier to criticise an opera than to identify a beast seen casually  twelve months before; easier to dress becomingly than to make a bee-line,  straight as the sighting of a theodolite, across strange country  in foggy weather; easier to recognise the various costly vintages  than to live contentedly on the smell of an oil rag.  When you take  this back elevation of the question, the inconsistency becomes apparent.  And the longa of Art,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34736"],[0,"True Christianity (#10)"],[1,"must live in accordance with our new birth. In a word, Adam  must die, and Christ must live, in us. It is not sufficient to acquire a  knowledge of the word of God; it is also our duty to obey it practically,  with life and power.    2. There are many who suppose that Theology is merely a science, or an art  of words, whereas it is a living experience and practical exercise.--Every  one now aims at acquiring eminence and distinction in the world; but no  one is willing to learn how to be devout. Every one now seeks out men of  great learning, who can teach arts, languages, and wisdom; but no one is  willing to learn from our only Teacher, Jesus Christ, how to become meek  and sincerely humble; and yet His holy and living example is the true rule  for our life and conduct, and, indeed, constitutes the highest wisdom and  knowledge; so that we can with truth declare, \"The pure life of Christ  opens all knowledge to us.\"    3. Every one is very willing to be a servant of Christ; but no one will  consent to be His follower. And yet He says: \"If any man serve me, let him  follow me.\" John 12:26. Hence, he who truly serves and loves Christ, will  also follow him; and he who loves Christ, will also love the example of  His holy life, His humility, meekness, patience, as well as the cross,  shame, and contempt which He endured, although the flesh may thereby  suffer pain. And although we cannot, in our present weakness, perfectly  imitate the holy and exalted life of Christ (which, indeed, is not  intended in my Book), nevertheless, we ought to love it, and long to  imitate it more fully; for thus we live in Christ, and Christ lives in us,  according to the words of St. John: \"He that saith he abideth in him ought  himself also so to walk, even as he walked.\" 1 John 2:6. It is now the  disposition of the world to acquire a knowledge of all things; but that  which is better than all other knowledge, namely, \"to know the love of  Christ\" (Eph. 3:19), no one desires to acquire. But no man can love  Christ, who does not imitate his holy life. There are many--a majority,  indeed, of men in this world--who are ashamed of the holy example of  Christ, namely, of his humility and lowly condition; that is, they are  ashamed of the Lord Jesus Christ; of them he says: \"Whosoever shall be  ashamed of me and of my words, in this adulterous and sinful generation,  of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed,\" etc. Mark 8:38. Christians  now desire a Christ of imposing appearance, who is magnificent, rich, and  conformed to the world; but no one desires to receive, to confess, and to  follow the poor, meek, despised, and lowly Christ. He will, therefore,  hereafter say: \"I never knew you\" (Matt. 7:23); ye were not willing to  know me in my humility, and therefore I do not know you in your pride.    4. Not only, however, is ungodliness, in all its forms, at variance with  Christ and true Christianity, but it is also the cause of the daily  accumulation of the displeasure of God, and of the penalties which he  inflicts; insomuch that he fits all creatures to be avengers, and that  heaven and earth, fire and water, are made to contend against us; so that  all nature is thereby sorely distressed, and well-nigh overwhelmed. Hence,  a season of affliction must be expected; war, famine, and pestilence; yea,  the last plagues are coming in with such violence, that we are exposed to  the assaults of nearly every creature. For even as the terrible plagues of  the Egyptians overtook them before the redemption and departure of the  children of Israel from Egypt, so, too, before the redemption of the  children of God occurs, dreadful and unheard-of plagues will overtake the  ungodly and impenitent. It is therefore high time to repent, to begin  another course of life, to turn from the world to Christ, to believe truly  in him, and to lead a Christian life in him, so that we may securely  \"dwell in the secret place of the Most High, and abide under the shadow of  the Almighty.\" Ps. 91:1. Such is also the exhortation of the Lord: \"Watch  ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape  all these things.\" Luke 21:36. The same is also testified in Ps. 112:7.    5. Now, to this end, my Christian reader, this book may, to a certain  extent, serve thee as a guide, showing thee not only how thou mayest,  through faith in Christ, obtain the remission of thy sins, but also how  thou mayest avail thyself of the grace of God, in order to lead a holy  life; and how thou mayest demonstrate and adorn thy faith by a Christian  walk and conversation. For true Christianity consists, not in words, nor  in any external show, but in a living faith, from which proceed fruits  meet for repentance, and all manner of Christian virtues, as from Christ  himself. For as faith is hidden from human view, and is invisible, it must  be manifested by its fruits; inasmuch as faith derives from Christ all  that is good, righteous, and blessed.    6. Now, when faith waits for the blessings which are promised to it, the  offspring of this faith is _hope_. For what else is hope but a constant  and persevering expectation, in faith, of the blessings which are  promised? But when faith communicates to a neighbor the blessings which it  has itself received, _love_ is the offspring of such a faith, imparting to  the neighbor that which it has itself received from God; and when faith  endures the trial of the cross, and submits to the will of God, it brings  forth _patience_. But when it sighs under the burden of the cross, or  offers thanks to God for mercies which it has received, it gives birth to  _prayer_. When it compares the power of God, on the one hand, with the  misery of man, on the other, and submits unresistingly to the will of God,  _humility_ is the fruit. And when this faith diligently labors that it may  not lose the grace of God, or, as St. Paul says: \"worketh out salvation  with fear and trembling\" (Phil. 2:12), then the _fear of God_ is the  result.    7. Thus thou seest that all the Christian virtues are the offspring of  faith, proceed from faith, and cannot be separated from faith, their  common source, if they are indeed genuine, living, and Christian virtues,  proceeding ultimately from God, from Christ, and from the Holy Spirit.  Hence no work can be acceptable to God without faith in Christ. For how  can true hope, sincere love, persevering patience, earnest prayer,  Christian humility, and a childlike fear of God, exist without faith? All  must be drawn from Christ, the well of salvation (Isa. 12:3), through  faith, as well righteousness, as all the fruits of righteousness. But take  great care, my reader, that thou do not connect thy works, the virtues  which thou hast commenced to practise, or the gifts of the new life, with  thy justification before God. For in this matter, man's works, merit,  gifts, and virtue, however lovely these may appear to be, have no  efficacy; our justification depends solely on the exalted and perfect  merit of Jesus Christ, apprehended by faith, even as it is set forth in  chap. V, XIX, XXXIV, and XLI, of this book, and in the first three  chapters of Book II. Take great care, therefore, not to confound the  righteousness of faith, on the one hand, and the righteousness of a  Christian life, on the other; but rather to make a clear distinction  between them; for here the whole foundation of our Christian religion is  involved. Still, thy repentance must be the great concern of thy life, for  otherwise thou hast no true faith, such as daily purifies, changes, and  amends the heart. Thou must, moreover, know that the consolations of the  Gospel cannot be effectually applied, unless they have been preceded by a  genuine godly sorrow, the result of which is a bruised and contrite heart;  for we read that \"to the poor the gospel is preached.\" Luke 7:22. How,  indeed, can faith give life to the heart, unless that heart has been  previously put to death by sincere sorrow and a thorough knowledge of sin?  Do not, therefore, imagine that repentance is a slight and easy work.  Remember the solemn and severe language of the Apostle Paul, when he  commands us to mortify and crucify the flesh, with the affections and  lusts, to offer the body as a sacrifice, to die unto sin, to be crucified  unto the world. Col. 3:5; Rom. 6:6; 12:1; 1 Pet. 2:24; Gal. 5:24; 6:14.  Truly, none of these things can result, when we gratify the flesh. Nor do  the holy prophets employ cheerful terms when they call for a contrite and  broken heart, and say: \"Rend your heart--weep and lament.\" Joel 2:13, 17;  Jer. 4:8. But where is such repentance now exhibited? The Lord Jesus  Christ, when alluding to it, demands that we should deny ourselves, and  renounce all that we have, if we desire to be his disciples. Luke 9:23;  Matt. 16:24. Verily, all this can never proceed from a gay, trifling, and  light mind; of this the evidence may be found in the seven Penitential  Psalms of David. The Scriptures abound in illustrations of the jealousy of  God, who demands both repentance and its fruits, without which eternal  salvation cannot be obtained. But afterwards the consolations of the  Gospel manifest their power. And both such repentance, and such  consolation, are solely the work of the Spirit of God, through the Word.    8. Now this Book which I have written, specially treats of such sincere  and earnest repentance of the heart, of the exhibition of faith in the  life and conduct, and of the spirit of love which should animate all the  acts of the Christian; for that which proceeds from Christian love, is, at  the same time, the fruit of faith. It is true that I have referred to some  earlier writers, such as Tauler, Thomas a Kempis, and others, who may seem  to ascribe more than is due to human ability and works; but my whole Book  is designed to counteract such an error. I would, therefore, kindly  request the Christian reader to remember"]]]
