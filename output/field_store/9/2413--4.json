By this means I used to form an oblong Image (such  as is _pt_) [in _Fig._ 23, and 24.] of Circular Images of the Hole,  (such as are _ag_, _bh_, _ci_, &c.) and by using a greater or less Hole  in the Window-shut, I made the Circular Images _ag_, _bh_, _ci_, &c. of  which it was formed, to become greater or less at pleasure, and thereby  the Mixture of the Rays in the Image _pt_ to be as much, or as little as  I desired.    [Illustration: FIG. 24.]    _Illustration._ In the twenty-fourth Figure, F represents the Circular  Hole in the Window-shut, MN the Lens, whereby the Image or Species of  that Hole is cast distinctly upon a Paper at J, ABC the Prism, whereby  the Rays are at their emerging out of the Lens refracted from J towards  another Paper at _pt_, and the round Image at J is turned into an oblong  Image _pt_ falling on that other Paper. This Image _pt_ consists of  Circles placed one after another in a Rectilinear Order, as was  sufficiently explained in the fifth Experiment; and these Circles are  equal to the Circle J, and consequently answer in magnitude to the Hole  F; and therefore by diminishing that Hole they may be at pleasure  diminished, whilst their Centers remain in their Places. By this means I  made the Breadth of the Image _pt_ to be forty times, and sometimes  sixty or seventy times less than its Length. As for instance, if the  Breadth of the Hole F be one tenth of an Inch, and MF the distance of  the Lens from the Hole be 12 Feet; and if _p_B or _p_M the distance of  the Image _pt_ from the Prism or Lens be 10 Feet, and the refracting  Angle of the Prism be 62 Degrees, the Breadth of the Image _pt_ will be  one twelfth of an Inch, and the Length about six Inches, and therefore  the Length to the Breadth as 72 to 1, and by consequence the Light of  this Image 71 times less compound than the Sun's direct Light. And Light  thus far simple and homogeneal, is sufficient for trying all the  Experiments in this Book about simple Light. For the Composition of  heterogeneal Rays is in this Light so little, that it is scarce to be  discovered and perceiv'd by Sense, except perhaps in the indigo and  violet. For these being dark Colours do easily suffer a sensible Allay  by that little scattering Light which uses to be refracted irregularly  by the Inequalities of the Prism.    Yet instead of the Circular Hole F, 'tis better to substitute an oblong  Hole shaped like a long Parallelogram with its Length parallel to the  Prism ABC. For if this Hole be an Inch or two long, and but a tenth or  twentieth Part of an Inch broad, or narrower; the Light of the Image  _pt_ will be as simple as before, or simpler, and the Image will become  much broader, and therefore more fit to have Experiments try'd in its  Light than before.    Instead of this Parallelogram Hole may be substituted a triangular one  of equal Sides, whose Base, for instance, is about the tenth Part of an  Inch, and its Height an Inch or more. For by this means, if the Axis of  the Prism be parallel to the Perpendicular of the Triangle, the Image  _pt_ [in _Fig._ 25.] will now be form'd of equicrural Triangles _ag_,  _bh_, _ci_, _dk_, _el_, _fm_, &c. and innumerable other intermediate  ones answering to the triangular Hole in Shape and Bigness, and lying  one after another in a continual Series between two Parallel Lines _af_  and _gm_. These Triangles are a little intermingled at their Bases, but  not at their Vertices; and therefore the Light on the brighter Side _af_  of the Image, where the Bases of the Triangles are, is a little  compounded, but on the darker Side _gm_ is altogether uncompounded, and  in all Places between the Sides the Composition is proportional to the  distances of the Places from that obscurer Side _gm_. And having a  Spectrum _pt_ of such a Composition, we may try Experiments either in  its stronger and less simple Light near the Side _af_, or in its weaker  and simpler Light near the other Side _gm_, as it shall seem most  convenient.    [Illustration: FIG. 25.]    But in making Experiments of this kind, the Chamber ought to be made as  dark as can be, lest any Foreign Light mingle it self with the Light of  the Spectrum _pt_, and render it compound; especially if we would try  Experiments in the more simple Light next the Side _gm_ of the Spectrum;  which being fainter, will have a less proportion to the Foreign Light;  and so by the mixture of that Light be more troubled, and made more  compound. The Lens also ought to be good, such as may serve for optical  Uses, and the Prism ought to have a large Angle, suppose of 65 or 70  Degrees, and to be well wrought, being made of Glass free from Bubbles  and Veins, with its Sides not a little convex or concave, as usually  happens, but truly plane, and its Polish elaborate, as in working  Optick-glasses, and not such as is usually wrought with Putty, whereby  the edges of the Sand-holes being worn away, there are left all over the  Glass a numberless Company of very little convex polite Risings like  Waves. The edges also of the Prism and Lens, so far as they may make any  irregular Refraction, must be covered with a black Paper glewed on. And  all the Light of the Sun's Beam let into the Chamber, which is useless  and unprofitable to the Experiment, ought to be intercepted with black  Paper, or other black Obstacles. For otherwise the useless Light being  reflected every way in the Chamber, will mix with the oblong Spectrum,  and help to disturb it. In trying these Things, so much diligence is not  altogether necessary, but it will promote the Success of the  Experiments, and by a very scrupulous Examiner of Things deserves to be  apply'd. It's difficult to get Glass Prisms fit for this Purpose, and  therefore I used sometimes prismatick Vessels made with pieces of broken  Looking-glasses, and filled with Rain Water. And to increase the  Refraction, I sometimes impregnated the Water strongly with _Saccharum  Saturni_.      _PROP._ V. THEOR. IV.    _Homogeneal Light is refracted regularly without any Dilatation  splitting or shattering of the Rays, and the confused Vision of Objects  seen through refracting Bodies by heterogeneal Light arises from the  different Refrangibility of several sorts of Rays._    The first Part of this Proposition has been already sufficiently proved  in the fifth Experiment, and will farther appear by the Experiments  which follow.    _Exper._ 12. In the middle of a black Paper I made a round Hole about a  fifth or sixth Part of an Inch in diameter. Upon this Paper I caused the  Spectrum of homogeneal Light described in the former Proposition, so to  fall, that some part of the Light might pass through the Hole of the  Paper. This transmitted part of the Light I refracted with a Prism  placed behind the Paper, and letting this refracted Light fall  perpendicularly upon a white Paper two or three Feet distant from the  Prism, I found that the Spectrum formed on the Paper by this Light was  not oblong, as when 'tis made (in the third Experiment) by refracting  the Sun's compound Light, but was (so far as I could judge by my Eye)  perfectly circular, the Length being no greater than the Breadth. Which  shews, that this Light is refracted regularly without any Dilatation of  the Rays.    _Exper._ 13. In the homogeneal Light I placed a Paper Circle of a  quarter of an Inch in diameter, and in the Sun's unrefracted  heterogeneal white Light I placed another Paper Circle of the same  Bigness. And going from the Papers to the distance of some Feet, I  viewed both Circles through a Prism. The Circle illuminated by the Sun's  heterogeneal Light appeared very oblong, as in the fourth Experiment,  the Length being many times greater than the Breadth; but the other  Circle, illuminated with homogeneal Light, appeared circular and  distinctly defined, as when 'tis view'd with the naked Eye. Which proves  the whole Proposition.    _Exper._ 14. In the homogeneal Light I placed Flies, and such-like  minute Objects, and viewing them through a Prism, I saw their Parts as  distinctly defined, as if I had viewed them with the naked Eye. The same  Objects placed in the Sun's unrefracted heterogeneal Light, which was  white, I viewed also through a Prism, and saw them most confusedly  defined, so that I could not distinguish their smaller Parts from one  another. I placed also the Letters of a small print, one while in the  homogeneal Light, and then in the heterogeneal, and viewing them through  a Prism, they appeared in the latter Case so confused and indistinct,  that I could not read them; but in the former they appeared so distinct,  that I could read readily, and thought I saw them as distinct, as when I  view'd them with my naked Eye. In both Cases I view'd the same Objects,  through the same Prism at the same distance from me, and in the same  Situation. There was no difference, but in the Light by which the  Objects were illuminated, and which in one Case was simple, and in the  other compound; and therefore, the distinct Vision in the former Case,  and confused in the latter, could arise from nothing else than from that  difference of the Lights. Which proves the whole Proposition.    And in these three Experiments it is farther very remarkable, that the  Colour of homogeneal Light was never changed by the Refraction.      _PROP._ VI. THEOR. V.    _The Sine of Incidence of every Ray considered apart, is to its Sine of  Refraction in a given Ratio._    That every Ray consider'd apart, is constant to it self in some degree  of Refrangibility, is sufficiently manifest out of what has been said.  Those Rays, which in the first Refraction, are at equal Incidences most  refracted, are also in the following Refractions at equal Incidences "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33527"],[0,"Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoises of the Western North Atlantic (#10)"],[1,"Tall (to 20 feet [6.1 m]);          Similar shape but smaller--rarely    inverted cone (point down)          taller than 10-15 feet    or elongated ellipse.

Distribution    Fin whales are probably the most numerous and widely distributed large  whale species in the western North Atlantic.    Fin whales summer from below the latitude of Cape Cod, Mass., north to  the Arctic Circle. (They are frequently seen between New York and  Bermuda this time of year.) Within this zone they may sometimes be seen  very close to shore and appear to be concentrated between shore and the  1,000-fathom curve from at least lat. 41 deg.20' to 57 deg.00' N. In recent  years they have been reported in relatively large numbers in the Gulf of  Maine from March through June, off Newfoundland as early as June but  increasing to August, and entering Davis Straits and beyond in  substantial numbers in midsummer to late summer. There is some evidence  that the animals venturing farthest north are the largest individuals of  the species. Movements of the population(s) southward have usually begun  by October, though some fin whales sometimes remain in the northern seas  sufficiently long to become trapped in the ice and killed.    During winter the range of fin whales spreads out from the advancing ice  southward, reaching at least to the coast of Florida, into the Gulf of  Mexico, and to the Greater Antilles, though fin whales are not at all  common in tropical waters. During the winter many fin whales move into  offshore waters. Northward migrations probably begin in midspring.    Fin whales may be found in Cape Cod waters all year long.    There may be two or possibly three separate stocks of fin whales in the  western North Atlantic, one more northern cold-adapted stock and another  more southern stock. The ranges of the two stocks appear to overlap,  such that the winter range of the northern stock probably becomes the  spring and summer range of the more southern stock. The third stock may  consist of an isolated population in the northern Gulf of Mexico.      Stranded Specimens    Stranded fin whales may be most readily identified by 1) the  yellowish-white coloration of the right front baleen and the right white  lower lip; 2) the numerous baleen plates (262-473 in number); 3) the  numerous ventral grooves (56-100 in number) extending to the navel and  beyond (Table 2); and 4) the broad, flat sharply pointed head with only  a single head ridge.    [Illustration: Figure 15.--The heads of fin whales surfacing to breathe  off Japan and in the northern North Atlantic (inset). When they can be  approached from the right side, fin whales can be positively  distinguished from the other large balaenopterine species by the white  coloration of the right lower lip and the flat, narrow head.

Description    Sei (pronounced \"say\") whales have been reported to reach 62 feet (19  m).    The snout is less acutely pointed than that of the fin whale but when  viewed from the side appears slightly arched. In general, the head is  intermediate in shape between that of the blue whale and that of the fin  whale. The dorsal fin, which is from 10 to 24 inches (25.4 to 61 cm)  tall and strongly falcate in adult animals, is located about two-thirds  of the way back on the back, farther forward than that of the blue or  fin whales. Sei whales are dark steel gray on the back and sides, and on  the posterior portion of the ventral surface. The body often has a  galvanized appearance due to scars possibly resulting from lamprey bites  inflicted during migrations into warmer waters. These scars may be dark  gray to almost white in color. On the belly there is a region of grayish  white that is confined to the area of the ventral grooves. Neither the  flippers nor the tail flukes are white underneath. The right lower lip  and the mouth cavity, unlike those of the fin whale, are uniformly gray.  The baleen plates are uniformly grayish black with fine grayish-white  fringes. (A small number of sei whales have been noted to have a few  half-white plates near the front of the mouth, a feature which might  result in their confusion with fin whales.)      Natural History Notes    The blow of sei whales is an inverted cone rarely taller than 15 feet  (4.6 m).    Sei whales are generally skimmer feeders and do not usually dive very  deeply. For that reason they usually surface at a shallower angle than  fin whales. The head rarely emerges at a steep angle (except when the  whales are chased). Instead, the blowholes and a major portion of the  back, including the dorsal fin, become visible almost simultaneously and  remain visible for relatively long periods of time. In this species it  can be generally stated that the amount of the back in the area of the  dorsal fin which is exposed above the surface as the animal sounds is  approximately the same height as the dorsal fin. When they begin another  dive, sei whales do not arch the tail stock or flukes high. Instead,  they normally submerge by slipping quietly below the surface, often  remaining in view only a few feet down and leaving a series of tracks or  swirls on the surface as they move their tail flukes. When they are  feeding in this manner, sei whales may exhibit a highly regular blowing  and diving pattern over long periods of time.    Sei whales usually travel in groups of from two to five individuals,  though they may concentrate in large numbers on the feeding grounds.    In the northern portion of their range, sei whales feed on copepods.  Throughout the remainder of the range, however, their food is more  varied and also includes krill and a variety of small schooling fishes.  The species derived its common name, in fact, from its frequent  occurrence with or near sei fish.      May Be Confused With    The sei whale's smaller size and decidedly taller, more falcate dorsal  fin located well more than one-third forward"]]]
