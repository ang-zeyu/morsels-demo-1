It is  they who ground  down the nation and enriched themselves with the spoil. It is not  the nobles who dirtied their hands with money wrung from the poor.  By all means let the middle class have a share in the government;  but it is not a share they desire. The clergy are to have no voice;  the nobility are to have no voice; the king himself is to be a  cipher. All power is to be placed in the hands of these men, the  chosen of the scum of the great towns, the mere mouthpieces of the  ignorant mob. It is not order that these gentry are organizing, it  is disorder.\"    Such were the opinions of the marquis, but he was tolerant of other  views, and at the gatherings at the chateau Harry heard opinions  of all kinds expressed.    During his rambles alone he entered as much as he could into  conversation with the peasants, with woodcutters, foresters, and  villagers. He found that the distress which prevailed everywhere  was terrible. The people scarcely kept life together, and many  had died of absolute starvation. He found a feeling of despair  everywhere, and a dull hatred of all who were above them in the  world. Harry had difficulty in making them talk, and at first could  obtain only sullen monosyllables. His dress and appearance showed  him to belong to the hated classes, and set them against him at  once; but when he said that he was English, and that in England  people were watching with great interest what was passing in France,  they had no hesitation in speaking.    Harry's motives in endeavouring to find out what were the feelings  of the people at large, were not those of mere curiosity. He was  now much attached to the marquis and his family; and the reports  which came from all parts of France, as well as from Paris, together  with the talk among the visitors at the chateau, convinced him that  the state of affairs was more serious than the marquis was inclined  to admit. The capture of the Bastille and the slaughter of its  defenders--the massacres of persons obnoxious to the mob, not only  in the streets of Paris but in those of other great towns, proved  that the lower class, if they once obtained the upper hand, were  ready to go all lengths; while the number of the nobility who were  flocking across the frontier showed that among this body there  existed grievous apprehensions as to the future.    Harry had read in a book in the library of the chateau an account  of the frightful excesses perpetrated by the Jacquerie. That dreadful  insurrection had been crushed out by the armour-clad knights of  France; but who was to undertake the task should such a flame again  burst out? The nobles no longer wore armour, they had no armed  retainers; they would be a mere handful among a multitude. The  army had already shown its sympathy with the popular movement, and  could not be relied upon. That the marquis himself should face out  any danger which might come seemed to Harry right and natural; but  he thought that he was wrong not to send his wife and daughters, and  at any rate Jules, across the Rhine until the dangers were passed.    But the marquis had no fears. Some one had mentioned the Jacquerie  in one of their conversations, but the marquis had put it aside as  being altogether apart from the question.    \"The Jacquerie took place,\" he said, \"hundreds of years ago.  The  people then were serfs and little more than savages. Can we imagine  it possible that at this day the people would be capable of such  excesses?\"    The answer of the gentleman he addressed had weighed little with  the marquis, but Harry thought over it seriously.    \"Civilization has increased, marquis, since the days of the Jacquerie,  but the condition of the people has improved but little.  Even now  the feudal usages are scarce extinct. The lower class have been  regarded as animals rather than men; and the increase of civilization  which you speak of, and from which they have received no benefit,  makes them hate even more bitterly than of old those in position  above them.    \"I am a reformer; I desire to see sweeping changes; I want a good,  wise, and honest government; and I desire these things because  I fear that, if they do not come peacefully they will come in a  tempest of lawlessness and vengeance.\"    \"Well, they are getting all they want,\" the marquis said peevishly.  \"They are passing every law, however absurd, that comes into their  hands. No one is opposing them. They have got the reins in their  own hands. What on earth can they want more? There might have been  an excuse for rebellion and riot two years since--there can be  none now. What say you, abbe?\"    The abbe seldom took part in conversations on politics, but, being  now appealed to, he said mildly:    \"We must allow for human nature, monsieur. The slave who finds  himself free, with arms in his hands, is not likely to settle down  at once into a peaceful citizen. Men's heads are turned with the  changes the last two years have brought about. They are drunk with  their own success, and who can say where they will stop? So far  they find no benefit from the changes. Bread is as dear as ever,  men's pockets are as empty. They thought to gain everything--they  find they have got nothing; and so they will cry for more and more  change, their fury will run higher and higher with each  disappointment,  and who can say to what lengths they will go? They have already  confiscated the property of the church, next will come that of the  laity.\"    \"I had no idea you were such a prophet of evil, abbe,\" the marquis  said with an uneasy laugh, while feelings of gloom and anxiety fell  over the others who heard the abbe's words.    \"God forbid that I should be a prophet!\" the old man said gravely.  \"I hope and trust that I am mistaken, and that He has not reserved  this terrible punishment for France. But you asked me for my opinion,  marquis, and I have given it to you.\"    Despite these forebodings the winter of 1790 passed without  disturbance at the chateau.    In the spring came news of disorder, pillage, and acts of ruffianism  in various parts. Chateaux and convents were burned and destroyed,  and people refused to pay either their taxes or rents to their  landlords. In the south the popular excitement was greater than in  other parts. In Burgundy there was for the most part tranquility;  and the marquis, who had always been regarded as an indulgent  seigneur by the people of his estate, still maintained that these  troubles only occurred where the proprietors had abused their  privileges and ground down the people.          CHAPTER IV    The Clouds Gather      Occasionally and at considerable intervals Harry received letters  from his father. The latter said that there was great excitement  in England over the events which had taken place in France, and  that his mother was rendered extremely anxious by the news of the  attacks upon chateaux, and the state of tumult and lawlessness  which prevailed. They thought he had better resign his situation  and return home.    Harry in his replies made light of the danger, and said that after  having been treated so kindly it would be most ungrateful of him  to break the engagement he had made for three years, and leave his  friends at the present moment. Indeed, he, like all around him,  was filled with the excitement of the time. In spite of the almost  universal confusion and disorder, life went on quietly and calmly  at the chateau.  The establishment was greatly reduced, for few of  the tenants paid their rents; but the absence of ceremonial brought  the family closer together, and the marquis and his wife agreed that  they had never spent a happier time than the spring and summer of  1791.    The news of the failure of the king's attempt at flight on the  20th of June was a great shock to the marquis. \"A king should never  fly,\" he said; \"above all, he should never make an abortive attempt  at flight. It is lamentable that he should be so ill-advised.\"    At the end of September the elections to the Legislative Assembly as  it was now to be called, resulted in the return of men even more  extreme and violent than those whom they succeeded.    \"We must go to Paris,\" the marquis said one day towards the end of  October. \"The place for a French nobleman now is beside the king.\"    \"And that of his wife beside the queen,\" the marquise said quietly.    \"I cannot say no,\" the marquis replied. \"I wish you could have stayed  with the children, but they need fear no trouble here.  Ernest is  nearly seventeen, and may well begin, in my absence, to represent  me. I think we can leave the chateau without anxiety, but even were  it not so it would still be our duty to go.\"    \"There is another thing I want to speak to you about before we  start,\" the marquise said. \"Jeanne is no longer a child, although  we still regard her as one; she is fifteen, and she is graver  and more earnest than most girls of her age. It seems ridiculous  to think of such a thing, but it is clear that she has made this  English lad her hero. Do you not think it better that he should  go? It would be unfortunate in the extreme that she should get to  have any serious feelings for him.\"    \"I have noticed it too, Julie,\" the marquis said, \"and have smiled  to myself to see how the girl listens gravely to all he says, but  I am not disposed to send him away. In the first place, he has done  a great deal of good to the boys, more even than I had hoped for.  Ernest now thinks and speaks for himself, his ideas are broader, his  views wider. He was fitted before for the regime that has passed;  he is rapidly becoming fit to take his part in that which is to  come.    \"In the next place, my dear, you must remember the times have  changed. Mademoiselle Jeanne de St. Caux, daughter of a peer and  noble of France, was infinitely removed from the son of an English  doctor; but we seem to be approaching the end of all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37856"],[0,"The Determined Angler and the Brook Trout (#10)"],[1,"  shallow, and there had been no rain for ten days.    This was the occasion of learning more about striking the Eastern  brook trout than I had ever before enjoyed. The old rule is to strike  on the second of the rise, and, while I do not think this electric  quickness should be practiced in all cases and under all conditions. I  found it was the rule this day, especially in the one deep pool I  found. In other places--one in particular, where I saw six of my catch  make every move in taking the flies--I found it necessary to depart  from the old rule and strike not upon the second of the rise. I very  often gave wrist too quickly. It all goes to prove that rules are not  to be exercised at all times and under all conditions. We must make  allowances. I came upon one quiet piece of water that was as clear and  still as glass; I could see every detail of the pebbles at the bottom.  Eight pretty trout were in this bed of silent water, resting without a  perceptible movement--not even that delicate wave of the tail so  common with the trout in his balancing in running water. They did not  see me; a bush hid my form. When my slender rod tip moved over the  water and the leader with the flies went down gently upon the surface,  the trout thought (all animals think) the wind had stirred the frail  branch of an adjacent tree and swept into the water upon a cobweb  three insects for their feeding. Four rushed for the deceit and two  were hooked quietly and quickly. I landed them and went away to return  to the same spot a half-hour later. Seven trout were there this time.  I flailed gently over them, but received no rushing rise; one little  fellow came up deliberately, broke water two inches behind the little  dun, and then returned to his old position. Then two others did  precisely the same as their companion had done, excepting one that  chose the oak fly for his inspection. Then they sank themselves, and a  fourth gamester spurted up to the dun and took it in his mouth much as  a sunfish would suck in a bit of worm. I struck him, and he made a  splash that nearly drove a near-by-perched catbird into hysterics, and  sent the other trout up, down, and across the stream like so many  black streaks of lightning. Now, had I cast at these fish from above  or below and not just over them, where I saw every move they made, I  should have given them wrist on the second of their rise--as I did in  the case of the first two that made the first rush--and lost any  chance of success.    No, I say, we must not always follow rules regardless of conditions.  We must not judge all trout alike, even if they be of one species.  Men, though of one race, are not all alike in their habits any more  than they are in their sizes and colors.    I found in some parts of the stream that as long as I changed the  flies I had rises; in other parts no trout took the fly, no matter how  I worked it. Perhaps there were no fish hereabout; perhaps they saw  me; perhaps they were not hungry, and perhaps there were hundreds and  thousands of other reasons why they were not to be taken in these  certain places.    No man can strictly follow rules in all cases and take trout upon  every occasion of his trials. Conditions govern, and must be  studied--conditions, conditions.          CHAPTER VIII    THE ANGLER'S PRAYER--SAVE THE WOODS AND WATERS    \"Perpetual devotion to what a man calls his business is only to be  sustained by perpetual neglect of other things. And it is not by any  means certain that a man's business is the most important thing he has  to do.\"        ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.      Commerce or civilization or whatever you like to call modern man's  accumulation of money wealth at the sacrifice of nature is perpetrated  with no greater force than in the wanton waste of our forests--the  trees given by God to the people and stolen from the people by  individuals. It seems all right for man to prudently use our forests  in the making of homes and other practical things of actual necessity,  but it is a downright shame that the people allow greedy men to  destroy the trees for the mere sake of adding dollars to the  destroyers' already well-filled purses. And these selfish men even  deprive the people of their breathing-air, drinking-water, and fish  food. Springs, ponds, and brooks are dried up by the loss of  sheltering foliage. Lakes and rivers are ruined by the commercial  gentry's waste acid, dye, oil, gas, etc., and the very air we breathe  is poisoned by the fumes of the money-makers' chimneys.    The railroads cut down the people's trees to make ties, and they burn  the old ties instead of consuming them for steam power or giving them  back to the people for fuel or fence posts, etc. The mill owner burns  as rubbish the sawdust and slabs instead of burying the sawdust and  allowing it to turn into loam that would enrich the soil and thereby  propagate vegetable food matter and the very tree life the millman  wastes. He is not only destroying the material on hand but he is doing  his best to prevent the growth of future material. Slabs should not be  burned as waste matter; they are good fuel and good material for the  farmer, _et al._    Nothing should be burned as waste matter; nature tells us to bury, not  burn. Fire destroys not alone the valuable ingredient it consumes to  make itself, but burns up the earth's vital moisture--the life-giving  oxygen we breathe, without which no animate thing could survive.    Before fresh timber is cut for market-cornering purposes, the millmen  should be compelled to use up the vast rafts of trees they have  allowed to float upon river banks, there to rot while the choppers  continue their attack on new trees, half of which will go to waste  with the lumberman's already-decaying market-cornering mess in the  flooded valley.    Anyone may personally witness this wanton waste if so inclined: Take a  ride on the railroad between Portland, Oregon, and Tacoma, Washington,  and note the conditions _en route_; or glance out of the car window as  you ride through the timberland district in the Southern  states--Alabama, Georgia, etc.    Oregon and Washington are bragging about what the native biped  conceitedly calls enterprise, western spirit, progress, prosperity,  etc. Poor fools! They imagine the so-called prosperity is due to the  enterprise or spirit of themselves, while any nature student could  tell them that the business success of any territory is directly due  to that territory's material that is marketed, and that as soon as the  marketable material is used up the so-called enterprise, energy,  spirit, etc., of the ego-marketman go up with it.    In Michigan (Bay City) thirty-five years ago the wasters used to boast  that Bay City was going to outrival New York City in size, intellect,  money wealth, social standing, etc., in a few years. All this on a  little timber they were cutting and selling. It was remarked by a  nature student that the success of their ambition depended upon the  pine trees they were gradually consuming--ruthlessly cutting down to  extermination--and a practical man suggested that they plant and  propagate as well as cut and consume. Also it was hinted that the  lumber they made out of the trees was the only thing they had to make  possible the social downfall of New York.    \"Oh, by no means,\" they said; \"we have enterprise and spirit; that's  what counts.\"    But, the count was a failure--the trees giving out. Northern Michigan  was turned into a sugar-beet farm, and most of the unfortunates who  counted on making Bay City outrival New York are now of the very dust  that nurtures the present-day material that their offspring exists  upon.    The Michigan enterprise, spirit, etc., is now transferred to the few  other timberland States, and the natives of to-day, the early day of  plenty, are just like the old conceited Michiganders--they foolishly  imagine the financial success of their territory is due to so-called  personal energy, pride, enterprise, progress, etc., on the part of  themselves, when any naturalist knows that their prosperity is  directly due to God's bountifulness--the abundance of marketable  material--not man's effort or egotism.    When Oregon and Washington have lumbered all their timber the  \"enterprising\" natives will not have rivaled New York socially or  financially any more than the Michigander has accomplished this end;  Oregon and Washington, without timber, like Michigan, will stay just  where they are--if lucky enough not to go lower down in the social and  financial standard--when their marketable material is exhausted.    Climate is a mere matter of pure air. What's the good in climate if  it's smoked and burned? Any clean climate, hot or cold, is better than  any soiled climate, hot or cold.    Marketable material, pure air, and pure water are the three big  concerns of life; man isn't worthy of being included in the list of  important things because he destroys these three mighty essentials.  Material makes man more than man makes material.    Man's energy and egotism couldn't get a footing without marketable  material. What the world needs is less of vain man and more plain  market stuff.    Save the woods and waters.          CHAPTER IX    TROUT AND TROUTING        \"A day with not too bright a beam;        A warm, but not a scorching, sun.\"                 --CHARLES COTTON.      Where can I enjoy trout fishing amid good scenery and good cheer  without its necessitating a lengthy absence from the city? That is a  question which frequently rises in the mind of the toilers in the busy  centers of the East, and it is one becoming daily more difficult to  answer. Yet there are still nearby trout streams where a creel of from  fifteen to fifty, or even more, in favorable weather, might be made.  One such locality, which for years local sportsmen have proven, lies  within a four hours' ride of either Philadelphia or New York. All"]]]
