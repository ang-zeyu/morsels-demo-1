In fact, I recollect (when some years ago I  visited the Isle of Wight on a collecting expedition) seeing two men  with ropes and an iron bar going to the top of the \"Bench\" (a famous  place for sea fowl), and while one man was let down over the edge of  the cliff his fellow remained at the top to answer the pull of the  \"bird-line\" and look after the safety of the \"man-rope\" and iron bar.  So fascinating did this appear to me that, having been \"between heaven  and earth\" once or twice before, I volunteered to \"go below;\" but I  found that the fowlers did not care for the risk, or the loss of time,  and booty, involved in letting an amateur down.    It was, indeed, a wonderful sight. I crept as closely as I dared, and  lying on my breast looked over the cliff. Hundreds of feet down, the  sea, lashed into breakers by the breeze, crept up the steep black rock  walls, or tumbled over the half-hidden crags; and yet, though you  could see the white war of waters, but the faintest murmur of this  battle between land and sea could be heard--below and halfway up, the  puffins and guillemots were sitting in rows, or flying off in droves  as little black specks on the white foam.    Here I learned that they often baited fish-hooks with offal or pieces  of fish, for the purpose of catching the gulls, and this brought to my  mind the quantities of robins, thrushes, and such birds I had seen  caught by fish-hooks baited with worms and pegged down in the olive  groves of the Ionian Sea.    I notice that Pennant mentions that the lapwing is decoyed into nets  by the twirling of looking glass. I have seen exactly the same thing  myself on the Continent applied to the taking of larks. A cylinder of  wood, inlaid with pieces of looking-glass, is fixed 'between two  uprights, and made to revolve by means of a small crank and wheel, to  which a line is attached. The netsman, retiring to some little  distance, keeps the cylinder in constant motion by pulling the line,  at the same time keeping up a soft whistling noise with his mouth. The  larks flutter over the twirler, and seemingly dazzled, descend on the  ground between the nets which are then pulled over in the usual  manner.    Steel traps are of many shapes and sizes, and are best procured ready  made from a good firm, though I have known a few country blacksmiths  who could turn them out decently. As everyone knows this, the ordinary  \"gin,\" or tooth trap, used for capturing rats or other animals and  birds, no description is, I think necessary, further than to say that  the springs should be highly tempered, and that the teeth should not  be too long. These traps can be set in various places with or without  baits--in the water, on the ground, up a tree, or on a post; but  post-traps proper, which are chiefly useful, when set unbaited, for  catching hawks, are made with an arm and spring at right angles to the  plate, so that they may be fastened to the post which supports them.  In setting these traps great care and skill are necessary; and in  giving directions how to do this properly, I cannot do better than  quote \"Stonehenge,\" who says:    \"First lay the trap on the ground, then mark the outline of it,  allowing half an inch clear all round; out away the turf to this  pattern, and in the centre dig a hole deep enough to receive a strong  peg and the chain which fastens the trap to it, which will thus be  entirely concealed; drive in the peg, arrange the chain neatly upon  this and in the channel for the spring, and then set the trap in its  place, temporarily propping up the plate by a piece of twig, which can  finally be withdrawn by a string; take care so to out away the turf  that the jaws are only just below the level of the ground. Having done  this, cut a very thin slice of the turf which was removed to make way  for the trap, leaving little more than the grass itself with a ragged  edge, and lay this gently on the plate, and withdraw the prop. Then  cover the spring in the same way; and, lastly, put some more shreds of  grass or leaves over the jaws themselves, but in such a way that the  former will not be caught between the teeth when the trap is sprung.  When the keeper can do all this so neatly that the trap cannot be  discovered by the eye at two or three yards distance, and yet will be  sprung by half an ounce weight being placed upon the plate over and  above what it has already, and without leaving anything between the  jaws, he may be considered a master of his craft. All this should be  done with strong leather gloves on the hands, and with as little  breathing over the trap as possible. The object of these precautions  is to avoid leaving any scent behind, which might alarm the vermin,  who are always suspicions of any place where they have reason to  believe man has been at work.\"    Daniel, in his \"Rural Sports,\" says:      Otters are taken in an unbaited trap, for they reject every kind of  bait, This trap must be placed near his landing place, which will be  found by carefully examining the edges of rivers or ponds, either by  his spraints, his seal, or the remains of fish (for in whatever place  he eats his plunder he always leaves the tail or hinder parts of the  fish undevoured). The trap must be set in and covered with mud to  prevent his seeing it; the instant the trap \"strikes,\" the otter  plunges into the water with it, when its weight, preventing his rising  to the surface, soon destroys him. The trap will seldom be drawn more  than twenty yards from the spot, and with a grappling iron is soon  recovered. If the place where he comes out of the water cannot be  discovered, upon the ground where the remains of fish are left, out a  hole near the edge of the water, and place a trap or two upon a level  with the ground and cover it over carefully with moss.      This aqueous method of trapping, is also recommended for taking all  birds of the crow tribe. The bait in this case is an egg, so secured  that on the bird walking along a prepared pathway to seize the  delicacy he springs a concealed trap, and fluttering into deep water  drowns by the weight of the attachment.    Another method of setting the trap on land for the taking of some  animals, which, says Daniel, speaking of the marten (now a rare animal  in most parts of England), is a sure way of catching this destructive  little animal in a park or covert which is railed in, is to cut a  groove in some of the posts or gate posts, in which set an unbaited  steel trap, and as they constantly run along the posts and pales early  in the morning to dry themselves, in leaping up from the ground upon  the place where the trap is set, they are sure to be captured.    Fish is recommended as bait for weasels, polecats, etc, although I  think the best way of trapping such animals is to form an enclosure of  brushwood, etc, in which peg down some live bird, leading two narrow  pathways from it from each end and exactly opposite each other, in  each of which place an ordinary steel trap, unbaited, concealed in as  skilful a manner as possible. The animal running along one of these  pathways, to seize his prey, is inevitably trapped. Be sure and have  two openings, or this plan will not succeed. Cats may be trapped in  this manner.    St. John, in his \"Highland Sports,\" mentions that if a wild cat, or  fox, can be killed, and the body placed in the usual haunts of its  kind, well surrounded with traps, curiosity or some such feeling will  impel them to visit the \"dear departed,\" and in walking round they  often succeed in springing the traps, and remaining as mourners in a  fashion they did not intend.    Hawks may be trapped by first capturing their young, and pegging one  or more to the ground, and surrounding it or them by concealed traps.  This cruel but highly effective way succeeds by reason of the old  birds seeing or hearing their young, and attempting to release them.    If part of a bird or animal killed by a hawk can be found, a good plan  is to allow it to remain, surrounding it also with concealed traps, as  they usually return to finish their meal, and that sometimes after the  lapse of days.    The \"box trap\" is used for catching many animals for which the  ordinary gin is used; but the advantage which it possesses over the  latter is that it captures all animals alive, which, in the case of a  hare or a rabbit accidentally getting in, is of consequence, as it may  be released unhurt, whereas the ordinary steel trap, if accidentally  sprung by them, would have killed or maimed them to a certainty. These  box traps can be bought ready-made at many places; but, for those who  wish to make one themselves, I must refer them for plans and  description to Col. Hawker, or \"Stonehenge.\" Almost anything does to  bait a gin or box trap with--bits of flesh, fish, offal, half-cooked  red herrings, etc.--and it is a generally understood thing that if  half-putrid flesh or entrails of any animal are rubbed over traps or  the thorns or bushes placed as entrances to traps, hares and the like  will seldom go near.    Of course, a very small trap must be used for small birds, and baited  either with seeds, bread, worms, or a small piece of fat meat, which  latter is a most tempting bait for the birds of the genus Parus  (titmice).    There are several other made traps, such as the trap cage; the best of  which has a bird as a decoy partitioned off from the actual trap. This  is a useful little trap in some seasons, and is well known, being  easily procurable at any of the bird fanciers'.    Mr. James Hiam, well known in Worcestershire for his \"Notes on Natural  History,\" sends me the following description of his method of trapping  bullfinches:    \"I find the best way to trap bullfinches is to procure a caged bird,  also what is known as a trap-cage, putting the tame bird in the lower  part,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26030"],[0,"The Automobilist Abroad (#10)"],[1,"room off of rare viands and  drink expensive wines, but this is his common conception of the  automobile tourist. One fights up or down through the scale of hotel  servants, and does his best to allay any false ideas they may have,  including those of the hostler, who has done nothing for you, and  expects his tip, too. It's an up-hill process, and the idea that  every automobilist is a millionaire is everywhere dying hard.    The traveller demands not so much elegance as comfort, and, above  all, fit accommodation for his automobile. Some sort of a light,  airy, and clean closed garage is his right to demand, and the hotel  that supplies this, as contrasted with the one that does not, gets  the business, even if other things be _not_ equal.    The requirements of an automobile _en tour_ are almost as numerous  and varied as those of its owner. Hence the hotel proprietor must, if  he values this clientele, provide something a great deal better than  a mere outhouse, an old untidy stable-yard, or a lean-to.    Small concern is it to mine host of the local inn, who is somewhat  off the beaten track of motorcars, as to what really constitutes a  garage. He usually does not even know what the word means. Any  roofed-over shed or shack, with doors or not, is what one generally  has to put up with to-day, for housing his resplendent brassy and  varnishy automobile.    Once the writer remembers being turned into an old stable (in  England), the floor of which was strewn with the broken bottles of a  defunct local mineral water industry, and again into another, used as  a carpenter's shop, the floor strewn with the paraphernalia and tools  of the trade.    If the English hotel-keeper (again they do things better on the  Continent) only would discriminate to the extent of believing that  there is nothing harmful or indecent about an automobile, and let it  live in the coach-house like a respectable dog-cart or the orthodox  brougham, all would be well, and we should save our tempers and a  vast lot of gray matter in attempting to show a conservative landlord  how far he is behind the times.    One other very important demand the automobilist makes of the hotel,  and that is the possibility of being supplied with his coffee at any  time after five in the morning. The automobile tourist, not of the  butterfly order, is almost invariably an early bird.    Without question the Continental hotel of all ranks is vastly  superior to similar establishments in Britain. The inferiority of the  British inns may be due to tardiness and slothfulness on the part of  the landlords, or long suffering and non-complaining on the part of  their guests. It is either one or the other, or both, of these  reasons, but the fact is the hotel-keeper, and his establishment as  well, are each far inferior to those of Continental Europe.    Perhaps the real reason of the conservatism of the British  hotel-keeper is yet to be fathomed, but it probably starts from the  fact that he does not travel to learn. The young Swiss serves his  apprenticeship, and learns French, as a waiter at Nice, just as he  learns Italian at San Remo. Ten years later you may find him as the  manager of a big hotel at home. He has learned his business by hard,  disagreeable work. How many English hotel-keepers have imitated him?  Another cause of backwardness in England is the \"license\" system,  with its artificial augmentation of the value of all premises where  alcoholic refreshment is provided. This tends to make the landlord  look upon it as his chief, if not his sole, source of profit. Even if  he serves meals at a fair price, he looks to the accompanying, or  casual, drinks to pay him best. This results in indifferent and  slovenly food-catering. The public bar, with its foul-mouthed  loafers,--there seems to be an idea that one can talk in an English  tavern as one would not in an English street,--is often within  ear-shot of the dining-room. This is one of the great defects of the  English hotel system, in all but the largest towns, and even there it  is not wholly absent.    This is how the facts strike a foreigner, the Frenchman, the  Dutchman, the Belgian, and the German, whose hotels and restaurants  are, first of all, for quiet, ordinary guests, and only secondarily  as places where liquid refreshment--alcoholic or otherwise--is served  with equal alacrity, but without invidious distinction.    The old-time inns of England, and their very names, have a peculiar  fascination for the stranger. Some of us who know them intimately,  and who how what discomfort and inefficient catering may lurk behind  such a picturesque nomenclature as the \"Rose and Crown\" or the  \"Hawthorne Inn,\" have a certain disregard for the romance of it all.  If one is an automobilist he has all the more reason to take  cognizance of their deficiencies.    All the same the mere mention of the old-time posting-houses of the  \"Bath Road,\" the \"Great North Road\" (particularly that portion  between London and Cambridge along which Dick Turpin took his famous  ride) have a glamour for us that even the automobile will not wholly  extinguish. According to story it was at one of the many inns along  the \"Great North Road\" that Turpin procured a bottle of wine, which  once having passed down the throat of his famous \"Black Bess\" enabled  the rascal to escape his pursuers. The automobilist will be fortunate  if he can find gasoline along here to-day as easily as he can that  peculiarly vile brand of beer known as \"bitter.\"    Buntingford on the \"North Road\" has an inn, which, in a way, is  trying to cope with the new conditions. The landlord of the \"George  and the Dragon\" has come to a full realization that the motor-car has  well-nigh suppressed all other forms of road traffic for pleasure,  and, more or less incompletely, he is catering for the wants of  motorists, as did his predecessors for the traveller by  posting-carriage or stage-coach. This particular landlord, though he  looks like one of the old school, should be congratulated on a  perspicuity which few of his confreres in England possess.    There are two other inns which travellers on the \"North Road\" will  recognize as they fly past in their automobiles, or stop for tea or a  bite to eat, for, in spite of their devotion to the traffic in beer,  these \"North Road\" inns, within a radius of seventy-five or a hundred  miles of London, seem more willing to furnish solid or non-alcoholic  refreshment than most of their brethren elsewhere. The \"Bell Inn\" and  the \"Red, White, and Blue\" (and the George and the Dragon) of the  North Road in England deserve to linger in the memory of the  automobilist, almost to the exclusion of any other English inns of  their class.    With regard to hotel charges for all classes of travellers, as well  in England as on the Continent, there is an undoubted upward tendency  which the automobile has done absolutely nothing to allay. One good  is coming to pass, however, and that is uniformity of price for the  class of accommodation offered, and (in France and most other  Continental countries) the absolute abolition of the charge for  \"lights and service,\" an abominable and outrageous practice which  still lingers in England--and for that matter Scotland and Ireland.    The discussion of the subject has been worn threadbare, and it is  useless to enter further into it here, save to remark that since the  automobile is bringing about so many reforms and improvements perhaps  the abolition of this species of swindling on the part of the British  hotel-keeper will disappear along with antiquated sanitary  arrangements and uncomfortable closed-in beds.    In France--thanks again to the indefatigable Touring Club de  France--they have eliminated this charge for service and lights  entirely, and one generally finds hanging behind the door the little  card advocated by the Touring Club, stating clearly the charge for  that particular room and the price of the various things offered in  the way of accommodation. This ought to be demanded, by law, of every  hotel-keeper. Not every hotel in France has fallen in line, but those  that have are reaping the benefit. The automobilist is a good  advertiser of what he finds _en route_ that pleases him, and scores  pitilessly--to other automobilists--everything in the nature of a  swindle that he meets with, and they are not few, for in many places  the automobilist is still considered fair game for robbery.    As to the fare offered in English inns, as compared with that of the  Continental hotel, the least said the better; the subject has been  gone over again and again, so it shall not be reiterated here, save  to quote Pierre Loti on what one eats for an English dinner.    \"We were assembled round a horrible bill of fare, which would not be  good enough for one of our humblest cook-shops. But the English are  extraordinary folk. When I saw the reappearance, for the fourth time,  of the fatal dish of three compartments, for badly boiled potatoes,  for peas looking poisonously green, and for cauliflower drenched with  a glue-like substance, I declined, and sighed for Poledor, who  nourished my studious youth on a dainty repast at a shilling per  day.\"    The modern tourist, and especially the tourist by automobile, has  done more for the improved conduct of the wayside hotel, and even  those of the large towns, than whole generations of travellers of a  former day.    Once the hotel drew its income from the hiring-out of posting-horses,  and the sale of a little food and much wine. As the old saying goes:  \"Four horses and four bottles of port went together in the account of  every gentleman.\" Travellers of those days, if comparatively few,  were presumably wealthy. To-day no one, save the vulgar few, ever  cares that the innkeeper, or the servants, should suspect him of  being wealthy.    It's a failing of the Anglo-Saxon race, however, to want to be taken  for"]]]
