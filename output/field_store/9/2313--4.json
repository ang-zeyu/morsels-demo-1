But believe me, I have ceased to think of the  infinite wrong which you tried to do to me.\"    \"But I failed,\" he insisted, \"and I meant no harm to YOU.\"    \"To those I care for, Monsieur Chauvelin.\"    \"I had to serve my country as best I could. I meant no harm to your  brother. He is safe in England now. And the Scarlet Pimpernel was  nothing to you.\"    She tried to read his face, tried to discover in those inscrutable eyes  of his, some hidden meaning to his words. Instinct had warned her of  course that this man could be nothing but an enemy, always and at all  times. But he seemed so broken, so abject now, that contempt for his  dejected attitude, and for the defeat which had been inflicted on him,  chased the last remnant of fear from her heart.    \"I did not even succeed in harming that enigmatical personage,\"  continued Chauvelin with the same self-abasement. \"Sir Percy Blakeney,  you remember, threw himself across my plans, quite innocently of course.  I failed where you succeeded. Luck has deserted me. Our government  offered me a humble post, away from France. I look after the interests  of French subjects settled in England. My days of power are over. My  failure is complete. I do not complain, for I failed in a combat of  wits... but I failed... I failed... I failed... I am almost a fugitive  and I am quite disgraced. That is my present history, Lady Blakeney,\" he  concluded, taking once more a step towards her, \"and you will understand  that it would be a solace if you extended your hand to me just once  more, and let me feel that although you would never willingly look upon  my face again, you have enough womanly tenderness in you to force your  heart to forgiveness and mayhap to pity.\"    Marguerite hesitated. He held out his hand and her warm, impulsive  nature prompted her to be kind. But instinct would not be gainsaid: a  curious instinct to which she refused to respond. What had she to fear  from this miserable and cringing little worm who had not even in him  the pride of defeat? What harm could he do to her, or to those whom she  loved? Her brother was in England! Her husband! Bah! not the enmity of  the entire world could make her fear for him!    Nay! That instinct, which caused her to draw away from Chauvelin, as  she would from a venomous asp, was certainly not fear. It was hate! She  hated this man! Hated him for all that she had suffered because of  him; for that terrible night on the cliffs of Calais! The peril to  her husband who had become so infinitely dear! The humiliations and  self-reproaches which he had endured.    Yes! it was hate! and hate was of all emotions the one she most  despised.    Hate? Does one hate a slimy but harmless toad or a stinging fly?  It seemed ridiculous, contemptible and pitiable to think of hate in  connection with the melancholy figure of this discomfited intriguer,  this fallen leader of revolutionary France.    He was holding out his hand to her. If she placed even the tips of  her fingers upon it, she would be making the compact of mercy and  forgiveness which he was asking of her. The woman Desiree Candeille  roused within her the last lingering vestige of her slumbering wrath.  False, theatrical and stagy--as Marguerite had originally suspected--she  appeared to have been in league with Chauvelin to bring about this  undesirable meeting.    Lady Blakeney turned from one to another, trying to conceal her contempt  beneath a mask of passionless indifference. Candeille was standing close  by, looking obviously distressed and not a little puzzled. An instant's  reflection was sufficient to convince Marguerite that the whilom actress  of the Varietes Theatre was obviously ignorant of the events to  which Chauvelin had been alluding: she was, therefore, of no serious  consequence, a mere tool, mayhap, in the ex-ambassador's hands. At the  present moment she looked like a silly child who does not understand the  conversation of the \"grown-ups.\"    Marguerite had promised her help and protection, had invited her to her  house, and offered her a munificent gift in aid of a deserving cause.  She was too proud to go back now on that promise, to rescind the  contract because of an unexplainable fear. With regard to Chauvelin,  the matter stood differently: she had made him no direct offer of  hospitality: she had agreed to receive in her house the official  chaperone of an unprotected girl, but she was not called upon to show  cordiality to her own and her husband's most deadly enemy.    She was ready to dismiss him out of her life with a cursory word of  pardon and a half-expressed promise of oblivion: on that understanding  and that only she was ready to let her hand rest for the space of one  second in his.    She had looked upon her fallen enemy, seen his discomfiture and his  humiliation! Very well! Now let him pass out of her life, all the  more easily, since the last vision of him would be one of such utter  abjection as would even be unworthy of hate.    All these thoughts, feelings and struggles passed through her mind  with great rapidity. Her hesitation had lasted less than five seconds:  Chauvelin still wore the look of doubting entreaty with which he had  first begged permission to take her hand in his. With an impulsive toss  of the head, she had turned straight towards him, ready with the phrase  with which she meant to dismiss him from her sight now and forever, when  suddenly a well-known laugh broke in upon her ear, and a lazy, drawly  voice said pleasantly:    \"La! I vow the air is fit to poison you! Your Royal Highness, I entreat,  let us turn our backs upon these gates of Inferno, where lost souls  would feel more at home than doth your humble servant.\"    The next moment His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales had entered the  tent, closely followed by Sir Percy Blakeney.          Chapter VIII: The Invitation        It was in truth a strange situation, this chance meeting between Percy  Blakeney and ex-Ambassador Chauvelin.    Marguerite looked up at her husband. She saw him shrug his broad  shoulders as he first caught sight of Chauvelin, and glance down in his  usual lazy, good-humoured manner at the shrunken figure of the silent  Frenchman. The words she meant to say never crossed her lips; she was  waiting to hear what the two men would say to one another.    The instinct of the grande dame in her, the fashionable lady accustomed  to the exigencies of society, just gave her sufficient presence of mind  to make the requisite low curtsey before His Royal Highness. But the  Prince, forgetting his accustomed gallantry, was also absorbed in the  little scene before him. He, too, was looking from the sable-clad figure  of Chauvelin to that of gorgeously arrayed Sir Percy. He, too, like  Marguerite, was wondering what was passing behind the low, smooth  forehead of that inimitable dandy, what behind the inscrutably  good-humoured expression of those sleepy eyes.    Of the five persons thus present in the dark and stuffy booth, certainly  Sir Percy Blakeney seemed the least perturbed. He had paused just long  enough to allow Chauvelin to become fully conscious of a feeling  of supreme irritation and annoyance, then he strolled up to the  ex-ambassador, with hand outstretched and the most engaging of smiles.    \"Ha!\" he said, with his usual half-shy, half-pleasant-tempered smile,  \"my engaging friend from France! I hope, sir, that our demmed climate  doth find you well and hearty to-day.\"    The cheerful voice seemed to ease the tension. Marguerite sighed a sigh  of relief. After all, what was more natural than that Percy with his  amazing fund of pleasant irresponsibility should thus greet the man  who had once vowed to bring him to the guillotine? Chauvelin, himself,  accustomed by now to the audacious coolness of his enemy, was scarcely  taken by surprise. He bowed low to His Highness, who, vastly amused at  Blakeney's sally, was inclined to be gracious to everyone, even though  the personality of Chauvelin as a well-known leader of the regicide  government was inherently distasteful to him. But the Prince saw in  the wizened little figure before him an obvious butt for his friend  Blakeney's impertinent shafts, and although historians have been unable  to assert positively whether or no George Prince of Wales knew aught of  Sir Percy's dual life, yet there is no doubt that he was always ready  to enjoy a situation which brought about the discomfiture of any of the  Scarlet Pimpernel's avowed enemies.    \"I, too, have not met M. Chauvelin for many a long month,\" said His  Royal Highness with an obvious show of irony. \"And I mistake not, sir,  you left my father's court somewhat abruptly last year.\"    \"Nay, your Royal Highness,\" said Percy gaily, \"my friend Monsieur...  er... Chaubertin and I had serious business to discuss, which could only  be dealt with in France.... Am I not right, Monsieur?\"    \"Quite right, Sir Percy,\" replied Chauvelin curtly.    \"We had to discuss abominable soup in Calais, had we not?\" continued  Blakeney in the same tone of easy banter, \"and wine that I vowed  was vinegar. Monsieur... er... Chaubertin... no, no, I beg pardon...  Chauvelin... Monsieur Chauvelin and I quite agreed upon that point.  The only matter on which we were not quite at one was the question of  snuff.\"    \"Snuff?\" laughed His Royal Highness, who seemed vastly amused.    \"Yes, your Royal Highness... snuff... Monsieur Chauvelin here had--if I  may be allowed to say so--so vitiated a taste in snuff that he prefers  it with an admixture of pepper... Is that not so, Monsieur... er...  Chaubertin?\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27867"],[0,"Scientific American magazine, Vol. 2 Issue 1 (#10)"],[1,"fifteen dollars a  month; but if the girl herself has acquired property by inheritance,  or is able to improve her condition by marriage or otherwise,  independent of her parents, she is suffered to leave the house without  any payment; and, in the event of her marriage to the satisfaction of  the junta, a little dowry is provided for her, amounting to $500, from  a fund created from prizes in the lottery, the produce of tickets  presented to the institution.

Hence  arises most of the complaints, grumbling and murmurings, about the  times, the weather, the government, the people, &c. To one who  possesses, or is possessed of a malignant, peevish disposition himself,  most of the conduct of others, and the times and circumstances in  general, will to him appear _wrong side up_, and he will not  infrequently find his own calculations _up side down_. Could we at  once, view each circumstance in all its different bearings, we should  generally see some things that would paliate others, and thus render  the whole at least tolerable: and most of the jarring and clashing in  the world would thus be avoided. But by far the better way is to take  of each and every thing a view the most favorable. This course is  evidently peaceable, else politicians and sectarians could not so  uniformly applaud every act of their favorite sect or party, and as  uniformly oppose and deprecate those of their opponents. Every man who  habituates himself to viewing things in the most favourable light,  will find this course the most conducive to his own happiness, while  it contributes much to that of his neighbors and associates. Look at  the bright side of every thing, and hold every picture _right side  up_.           *       *       *       *       *          IMPORTANCE OF HUMILITY.      Dr. Franklin once received a very useful lesson from the excellent Dr.  Cotton Mather, which he thus relates in a letter to his son:--\"The  last time I saw your father was in 1724. On taking my leave, he showed  me a shorter way out of the house, by a narrow passage, which was  crossed by a beam over head. We were still talking, and as I withdrew,  he accompanying me behind, and I turning towards him, he said hastily,  \"Stoop, stoop!\" I did not understand him till I felt my head hit  against the beam. He was a man who never missed an opportunity of  giving instruction; and upon this he said to me: 'You are young and  have the world before you. _Learn to stoop_ as you go through it, and  you will miss many hard thumps.' This advice, thus beat into my head,  has frequently been of use to me.    And I often think of it when I see pride mortified, and misfortune  brought upon people by their carrying their heads too high.\"           *       *       *       *       *      \"An ambassador\" is defined as a man sent abroad to lie for the good of  his country. To compensate them for the wear and tear of conscience,  the country allows him a larger salary than any other subordinate they  employ.           *       *       *       *       *    _Communicated_          THE EUREKA: OR JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL  ASSOCIATION OF INVENTORS.      (We had not intended to say any thing on the subject of the \"Eureka\"  in this number, nor until the second number of the work should have  been issued: but finding that a great degree of dissatisfaction exists  in the minds even of those who are represented in that paper to be the  supporters and conductors thereof; and having received an implied  request for the insertion of the following communication, we would not  refuse it, although we doubt whether the Eureka will ever reach its  third number, whether its contents are subjected to public criticism  or not.)    _Mr. Editor:_ I had a little curiosity to hear what the press said of  this periodical; but as yet I have not seen any notice, except the  brief one in your columns. As a general rule, it is inexpedient for an  association to publish a periodical. Instead of being an expression of  the society, it almost unavoidably becomes the organ of a clique, and  renders the patronage of an otherwise liberal organization subservient  to private interest. In the columns of the \"N. York Farmer\" was first  advocated the formation of the N. Y. State Agricultural Society. Among  the first acts of this society was the issuing of an agricultural  paper at _twenty-five cents_ per annum. This was scattered over the  whole country to the injury of those who had been pioneers in  publishing agricultural papers. The Society could not sustain it  without loss. It was sold to an individual on condition that he would  publish the proceedings of the Society. The price was quadrupled. It  was soon found that a periodical having a general circulation, could  not devote much space to a local society, however noble and  prosperous. Necessity led to the columns of the daily press, and to  the issuing of a yearly volume of Transactions. This will be the  result of every prosperous association. If the proceedings are worth  publishing, the press will spread them over the whole face of the  civilized world. A collection of the most important and well-digested  papers in a yearly volume, is more in accordance with the dignity and  usefulness of a national association. Besides the injustice done to  other periodicals previously in existence, the association adds  nothing to its reputation by the undertaking. There are three or four  individuals at the American Institute who have a hankering for the  control of a paper. It is very easy to see that the publishing of a  weekly paper by the Institute would be a suicidal act. All the  Institute has to do is to make its proceedings interesting, and the  widest publicity will be given as a matter of course.    It was natural to suppose that with such an array of editors,  editorial committee, and of associate professors, the \"Eureka\" would  have done credit to the age, and claimed a rank, in point of  literature, with other monthlies. But candor leads me to say, I do not  recollect of having read a select journal with so many violations of  correct writing. With the exception of two or"]]]
