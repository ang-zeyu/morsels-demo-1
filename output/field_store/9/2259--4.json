This was pressed on vigorously. At the commencement the routine provided  for reveille at 4.30 a.m. and parades to be held from 6 to 9 a.m. and  4.30 to 7 p.m. Indoor (_i.e._, in huts) instruction was carried out  between 10.30 a.m. and 1 p.m. These hours were fixed in order to meet  climatic conditions, but they rendered satisfactory arrangements for  meals difficult. Three hours' work on an empty stomach in the early  morning did not induce enthusiasm or vigour in practising attack  formations and movements. Nor was the long interval between 1 o'clock  dinner and 7 o'clock tea conducive to contentment with other work of an  exhausting nature. A little was done to meet the situation by providing  an early morning cup of coffee and biscuit, but the poor quality of the  rations and the limited regimental funds prevented an entirely effective  solution. Nevertheless the discomforts were submitted to cheerfully and  the presence of the other battalions of the Brigade gradually gave rise  to a spirit of emulation, resulting in keenness and genuine progress.    The training was continued on from the stage reached at Blackboy Camp  and practical application was given to the principles inculcated in some  of the lectures of the voyage over. Bayonet fighting was assiduously  practised and knowledge obtained of recent changes born of the  experience of the war. Early in August a musketry course was fired by  the whole unit. Attention was then given to the more advanced forms of  exercise in attack and defence, combined with the construction and use  of earthworks. Here began that intimate knowledge of the shovel and pick  which, during the war, was acquired by every infantryman. All fighting  soldiers loathed these implements, but, at the same time, recognised  their utility and appreciated the protection they made it possible to  provide. Occasionally the Brigadier assembled the four battalions and,  after a little close-order work, would lead them on a five to ten mile  night march. Apart from the purpose already referred to, these night  marches had great value as steadying influences. Battalions vied with  each other in displaying good form. To see them marching to attention  with no sound audible but the tramp of thousands of feet, or, again, to  hear units, when \"at ease,\" singing some stirring song with 800  full-throated voices as one, was indeed inspiring to the bystander.    Now and then night work took the form of occupying and entrenching a  position, or of moving over unknown desert guided only by compass. There  were times when the dust nearly choked one, or when the lights and  shadows made it impossible to ascertain whether one was likely to fall  down a slope or stumble on to the side of a hill. Notwithstanding these  difficulties, the 28th never once lost its way or failed to reach its  objective to time. On one occasion a move was made for some miles along  the Suez Road and a bivouac, protected by outposts, established in the  Wadi-esh-Shem. The remainder of the Brigade represented a hostile force  based on Cairo. During the night an attempt was made to penetrate the  28th outpost line. The attempt was unsuccessful. Early the following  morning, the West Australians advanced westwards in attack formation and  succeeded in driving one of the opposing units off a line of hills  commanding the road to Cairo. This was the most elaborate setpiece  during the training period and, whilst the execution was defective in  several respects, the general form shown placed the \"Gropers\" an easy  first in the Brigade in point of efficiency. Nor had the specialists  been neglected. In addition to the original Machine Gun Section, a first  reserve section was trained and a commencement made with the second.  These gunners acquired a highly technical knowledge and were  subsequently utilised for the examination and repair of the armament of  the other sections of the Brigade. The formation of trained reserves for  the Signallers was also undertaken and due attention paid to other  requirements.    All training was supervised by the Brigadier and his Staff, but the  latter had not that experience likely to be of assistance either to its  chief or to commanding officers. General Spens lent one or two officers  and non-commissioned officers who had served in the first campaign in  France and whose experience should have been of value to the new troops.  The N.C.Os., genuine \"Contemptibles,\" were really useful and of a fine  stamp--able to impress the young Australian and communicate many useful  lessons. On the other hand, the officers were not, apparently, selected  with any regard to their capacity as instructors but merely for the sake  of giving them something to do. They lectured frequently in a didactic  manner--playing fast and loose with the training manuals, and advocating  experiments for which they could give no sound reason. When pressed on  these matters it seemed to them sufficient to say that they \"thought  they were good ideas.\" This engendered much vexation amongst the  Australian officers, more especially as the Brigadier very often did not  see his way clear to withstand the innovations. The immediate result  was to humbug officers and men and negative many of the sound lessons  already taught.    [Illustration: BRIG.-GENERAL JAMES BURSTON, V.D.  Who commanded the 7th Brigade in 1915.  _Photo. lent by Mrs. Burston._]    [Illustration: LIEUT.-COLONEL C. R. DAVIES, O.B.E, SECOND-IN-COMMAND,  1915-16.]    A further drawback in training was the large number of men which had to  be supplied for duties outside the Brigade. At times these amounted to  over 200 on the one day and comprised town picquets, guards on  hospitals, etc. The absence of these men broke up platoons and also  disrupted the continuity of instruction. There was no way out, but it  was thought that the \"dizzy limit\" had been reached when a request was  received for church orderlies, billiard markers and barmen--all for a  British formation. The Brigadier ventured a protest, but for his pains  was treated to a severe official snub.    One factor, however, which was a distinct aid to acquiring a knowledge  of warfare, was a School of Instruction held at Zeitun and commanded by  a distinguished officer of the Guards. A considerable number of the  junior officers and N.C.Os. attended, together with a proportion of the  machine gunners and signallers. Each course lasted three weeks. At the  examination held at the termination of the course the 28th men did  exceedingly well--the officers averaging 89 per cent. of marks and the  N.C.Os. 92 per cent., in their respective classes. The Commandant of the  School subsequently despatched the following note to Colonel  Collett--\"The results of the four classes attending this School from  your Battalion, viz., officers, N.C.Os., signallers and machine gunners,  are most satisfactory. I would especially draw your attention to the  roll of gunners; there is not a second class gunner among the whole  section, which is most gratifying to myself and the instructors.\" A  feature of this School was an officer of its staff who was not  favourably disposed towards Dominion troops. He was known to commence  one of his lectures somehow like this--\"Discipline is a subject of which  the Australians know nothing.\" It is understood that subsequent events,  together with an interview with Sir John Maxwell, caused him, if not to  change his view, at least to modify his tone.    An important development, which had a beneficial effect on the unit, was  the constitution, early in August, of the 2nd Australian Division. The  three new brigades of infantry which had recently arrived in Egypt led  General Birdwood, with the approval of the Australian Government, to  group them in a major formation. The command he allotted to  Major-General J. G. Legge, C.M.G., who had succeeded the late Sir  William Bridges with the 1st Division. By the 4th August General Legge  had arrived at Heliopolis, where he established his headquarters, and on  that date the troops passed from the immediate control of General  Spens. The divisional commander brought with him a staff of experienced  officers, and these immediately set about the higher organisation of the  brigades and the formation of the divisional troops. The 13th Light  Horse became the divisional mounted force, but the signallers and  engineers had to be completed by the transfer of suitable men from the  infantry. Many good men were in this way lost to the Battalion.    Mention has already been made of the poor quality of the rations in  Egypt. The system provided for a daily issue, by the Army Service Corps,  of meat and bread; in addition there was an allowance of 8-1/2d. per man  for the purpose of purchasing groceries and extras. On paper the scheme  looked excellent but in practice was execrable. In the first place the  A.S.C. procured their supplies from the local Supply Depot. Although the  meat was passable, the bread--heavy, sodden, and often mildewy--was a  source of daily and indignant protest. Complaint after complaint was  lodged with the Supply people but improvement was almost despaired of,  especially after verbal intimation had been received through  semi-official channels that if the West Australians wanted better bread  they would have to pay for it. Eventually, however, a change took place  and the article became more palatable. The groceries were purchased from  the Army canteens, which at this time were farmed out to contractors.  Here the trouble was in the rising price of staple articles, the want of  variety, and the scarcity of supplies. Tea and coffee were ample, but  the sugar ration was hardly sufficient for these let alone any surplus  being available for puddings, etc. Of the side-lines, such as tinned  fish, rice, prunes, oatmeal, etc., what there was of these did not go"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25428"],[0,"Anecdotes of Animals (#10)"],[1,"on]          LXXIV    A TALKING PARROT      During the time that Prince Maurice was ruling in Brazil, he heard of an  old parrot that was much celebrated for answering like a human being,  many of the common questions put to it. It was at a great distance; but  so much had been said about it that the prince's curiosity was roused,  and he directed it to be sent for.    When the parrot was brought into the room where the prince was sitting,  in company with several Dutchmen, it at once cried out in the Brazilian  language, \"What a company of white men are here!\" They asked it, \"Who is  that man?\" (pointing to the prince). The parrot answered, \"Some general  or other.\" When the attendants carried it up to him, he asked it,  through the aid of an interpreter (for he did not understand its  language), \"Whence do you come?\" The parrot answered, \"From Marignan.\"    The prince asked, \"To whom do you belong?\" It answered, \"To a  Portuguese.\" He asked again, \"What do you there?\" The parrot answered,  \"I look after chickens.\" The prince laughing, exclaimed, \"You look after  chickens!\" The parrot in reply said, \"Yes, I do; and I know well how to  do it;\" clucking at the same time in imitation of the noise made by the  hen to call her little chicks together.    [Illustration]    The prince afterward said that although the parrot spoke in a language  he did not understand, yet he could not be deceived, for he had in the  room at the time both a Dutchman who spoke Brazilian, and a Brazilian  who spoke Dutch; that he asked them separately and privately, and both  agreed exactly in their account of the parrot's conversation.          LXXV    A CHARITABLE CANARY      A pair of goldfinches who had had the misfortune to be captured with  their nest and six young ones, were placed in a double cage, with a pair  of canaries, which had a brood of little ones also; there being a  partition of wire netting between the cages.    At first the goldfinches seemed careless about their young ones. The  father canary, attracted by the cries of the baby goldfinches, forced  himself through a flaw in the wire, and began to feed them. This it did  regularly, until the goldfinches undertook the work themselves, and  rendered the kindness of the canary no longer necessary.    [Illustration]          LXXVI    CHOOSING THE LEAST OF TWO EVILS      A french dog was taught by his master to run many different errands,  among others to bring him his meals from a restaurant. The dog carried  the food in a basket, and one evening, when the dog was returning to his  master with his dinner, two other dogs, attracted by the savory smell  coming from the basket, made up their minds to attack him. The dog put  his basket on the ground and set himself courageously against the first  one that advanced against him; but while he was fighting with one, the  other ran to the basket, and began to help himself. At length, seeing  that there was no chance of beating both dogs, and saving his master's  dinner, he threw himself between his two opponents, and without further  ceremony, quickly ate up the rest of the food himself, and then returned  to his master with the empty basket.    [Illustration]          LXXVII    GOING TO MARKET      A butcher and cattle dealer had a dog which he usually took with him  when he drove cattle to market at a town some nine miles distant from  his home, to be sold. The dog was very clever at managing the cattle.    At last, so sure was the master of the wisdom and faithfulness of his  dog, that he made a wager that he would trust him with a certain number  of sheep and oxen, and let him drive them to the market all by himself.  It was agreed that no person should be within sight or hearing--at least  no one who had any control over the dog; nor was anybody to interfere or  be within a quarter of a mile.    On the day of the trial, the dog went about his business in the most  skilful and knowing manner; and although he had often to drive his  charge through the herds that were grazing, yet he never lost one, but  conducting them into the very yard to which he was wont to drive them  when with his master, he delivered them up to the person appointed to  receive them.    What more particularly marked the dog's sagacity was, that, when the  path the herd travelled lay through a spot where others were grazing, he  would run forward, stop his own drove, and then driving the others  from each side of the path, collect his scattered charge and then go on  again. He was several times afterward sent thus alone for the amusement  of the curious or the convenience of his master, and always did his work  in the same adroit and intelligent manner.    [Illustration]          LXXVIII    THE CATCHER CAUGHT      During a sudden flood in the Rhine, a hare, unable to find a way of  escape through the water to higher land, climbed up a tree. One of the  boatmen rowing about to assist the unfortunate people, seeing her, rowed  up to the tree, and, eager for the game, climbed it, without properly  fastening his boat.    The frightened hare, as its pursuer came near, sprang from the tree into  the boat, which thus set in motion, floated away, leaving its owner in  the tree in dread of being washed away by the current. After several  hours' anxiety, he was seen, and taken off by some of his companions.    [Illustration]          LXXIX    SNAKE DESTROYERS      The Indian ichneumon, a small creature, looking like both the weasel and  the mongoose, is of great use to the natives because of its great hatred  of snakes, which would otherwise make every footstep of the traveller  most dangerous. This little creature, on seeing a snake, no matter how  large, will instantly dart on it, and seize it by the throat, if he  finds himself in an open place, where he has a chance of running to a  certain herb, which he some way knows to be an antidote against the  poison of the bite, if he should happen to receive one. A gentleman  visiting the island of Ceylon saw the experiment tried in a closed room,  where the ichneumon, instead of attacking his enemy, did all in his  power to avoid him. On being carried out of the house, however, and put  near his antagonist in the field, he at once darted at the snake, and  soon killed it. It then suddenly disappeared for a few minutes, and  again returned as soon as it had found and eaten the herb it knew was an  antidote.    [Illustration]          LXXX    MUSICAL MICE      \"One rainy winter evening, as I was alone in my room,\" says an American  gentleman, \"I took up my flute and began to play. In a few minutes my  attention was directed to a mouse that I saw creeping from a hole, and  coming toward the chair in which I was sitting. I stopped playing, and  it ran quickly back to its hole. I began again shortly afterward, and  was much surprised to see it reappear, and take its old position. The  actions of the little animal were truly amusing. It lay down on the  floor, shut its eyes, and seemed delighted, but the minute I stopped my  playing, it instantly disappeared again. This experiment I often  repeated with the same result. I also noted that the mouse was  differently affected, as the music varied from the slow and sad to the  brisk or lively. It finally went away, and all my art could not coax it  to return.\"    [Illustration]          LXXXI    A CARRIER'S DOG      A carrier on his way to a market town had to stop at some houses by the  roadside, in the way of his business, leaving his cart and horse upon  the public road, under the protection of a passenger and a trusty dog.  Upon his return he missed one of the women passengers, and likewise a  led horse which was owned by a gentleman of the neighborhood. The horse  he was taking along, tied to the end of the cart. On inquiry he found  out that during his absence, the woman, who had been anxious to try the  mettle of the pony, had mounted it, and the animal had set off at full  speed. The carrier expressed much anxiety for the safety of the young  woman, casting at the same time an expressive look at his dog. Oscar  observed his master's eye, and aware of its meaning, instantly set off  in pursuit of the pony. Coming up with it soon after, he made a sudden  spring, seized the bridle, and held the animal fast. Several people,  having seen his actions, and the dangerous situation of the girl,  hastened to her aid. Oscar, however, notwithstanding their repeated  endeavors, would not let go his hold, and the pony was actually led into  the stable with the dog still clinging to it. When the carrier entered  the stable, Oscar wagged his tail in token of his satisfaction, and at  once gave up the bridle to his master.    [Illustration: A Carrier's Dog.--Page 160]    [Illustration]          LXXXII    A TAME COLONY      A well-known traveller, in describing the Island of Tristan d'Acunha,  states that the animals found on this lonely spot were so tame, that it  was necessary to clear a path right through the mass of birds which were  sitting on the rocks, and this was done by simply kicking them aside.  One kind of seal did not move at all when struck or pelted, and at last  some of the company amused themselves by mounting them, and riding them  into the sea.          LXXXIII    THE BEAR CUBS      A mother bear, with two cubs, came too near a whaler, and was shot. The  cubs not trying to escape, were taken alive. The little creatures,  though at first seeming quite unhappy, at length became in some measure  reconciled to their fate, and being quite tame, were allowed sometimes  to go at large about the deck.    While the ship was moored to a floe a few days after they were taken,  one of them having a rope fastened round his neck, was thrown overboard.  It at once swam to the ice, got upon it, and tried to escape. Finding  itself, however, held by the rope, it tried to free itself in the  following clever way.    Near the edge of the floe was a crack in the ice. It was of"]]]
