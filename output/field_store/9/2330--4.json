For Gomer founded those whom the  Greeks now call Galatians, [Galls,] but were then called Gomerites.  Magog founded those that from him were named Magogites, but who are by  the Greeks called Scythians. Now as to Javan and Madai, the sons of  Japhet; from Madai came the Madeans, who are called Medes, by the  Greeks; but from Javan, Ionia, and all the Grecians, are derived. Thobel  founded the Thobelites, who are now called Iberes; and the Mosocheni  were founded by Mosoch; now they are Cappadocians. There is also a mark  of their ancient denomination still to be shown; for there is even now  among them a city called Mazaca, which may inform those that are able to  understand, that so was the entire nation once called. Thiras also  called those whom he ruled over Thirasians; but the Greeks changed the  name into Thracians. And so many were the countries that had the  children of Japhet for their inhabitants. Of the three sons of Gomer,  Aschanax founded the Aschanaxians, who are now called by the Greeks  Rheginians. So did Riphath found the Ripheans, now called Paphlagonians;  and Thrugramma the Thrugrammeans, who, as the Greeks resolved, were  named Phrygians. Of the three sons of Javan also, the son of Japhet,  Elisa gave name to the Eliseans, who were his subjects; they are now the  Aeolians. Tharsus to the Tharsians, for so was Cilicia of old called;  the sign of which is this, that the noblest city they have, and a  metropolis also, is Tarsus, the tau being by change put for the theta.  Cethimus possessed the island Cethima: it is now called Cyprus; and from  that it is that all islands, and the greatest part of the sea-coasts,  are named Cethim by the Hebrews: and one city there is in Cyprus that  has been able to preserve its denomination; it has been called Citius by  those who use the language of the Greeks, and has not, by the use of  that dialect, escaped the name of Cethim. And so many nations have the  children and grandchildren of Japhet possessed. Now when I have premised  somewhat, which perhaps the Greeks do not know, I will return and  explain what I have omitted; for such names are pronounced here after  the manner of the Greeks, to please my readers; for our own country  language does not so pronounce them: but the names in all cases are of  one and the same ending; for the name we here pronounce Noeas, is there  Noah, and in every case retains the same termination.    2. The children of Ham possessed the land from Syria and Amanus, and the  mountains of Libanus; seizing upon all that was on its sea-coasts, and  as far as the ocean, and keeping it as their own. Some indeed of its  names are utterly vanished away; others of them being changed, and  another sound given them, are hardly to be discovered; yet a few there  are which have kept their denominations entire. For of the four sons of  Ham, time has not at all hurt the name of Chus; for the Ethiopians, over  whom he reigned, are even at this day, both by themselves and by all men  in Asia, called Chusites. The memory also of the Mesraites is preserved  in their name; for all we who inhabit this country [of Judea] called  Egypt Mestre, and the Egyptians Mestreans. Phut also was the founder of  Libya, and called the inhabitants Phutites, from himself: there is also  a river in the country of Moors which bears that name; whence it is that  we may see the greatest part of the Grecian historiographers mention  that river and the adjoining country by the appellation of Phut: but the  name it has now has been by change given it from one of the sons of  Mesraim, who was called Lybyos. We will inform you presently what has  been the occasion why it has been called Africa also. Canaan, the fourth  son of Ham, inhabited the country now called Judea, and called it from  his own name Canaan. The children of these [four] were these: Sabas, who  founded the Sabeans; Evilas, who founded the Evileans, who are called  Getuli; Sabathes founded the Sabathens, they are now called by the  Greeks Astaborans; Sabactas settled the Sabactens; and Ragmus the  Ragmeans; and he had two sons, the one of whom, Judadas, settled the  Judadeans, a nation of the western Ethiopians, and left them his name;  as did Sabas to the Sabeans: but Nimrod, the son of Chus, staid and  tyrannized at Babylon, as we have already informed you. Now all the  children of Mesraim, being eight in number, possessed the country from  Gaza to Egypt, though it retained the name of one only, the Philistim;  for the Greeks call part of that country Palestine. As for the rest,  Ludieim, and Enemim, and Labim, who alone inhabited in Libya, and called  the country from himself, Nedim, and Phethrosim, and Chesloim, and  Cephthorim, we know nothing of them besides their names; for the  Ethiopic war17 which we shall describe hereafter, was the cause that  those cities were overthrown. The sons of Canaan were these: Sidonius,  who also built a city of the same name; it is called by the Greeks Sidon  Amathus inhabited in Amathine, which is even now called Amathe by the  inhabitants, although the Macedonians named it Epiphania, from one of  his posterity: Arudeus possessed the island Aradus: Arucas possessed  Arce, which is in Libanus. But for the seven others, [Eueus,] Chetteus,  Jebuseus, Amorreus, Gergesus, Eudeus, Sineus, Samareus, we have nothing  in the sacred books but their names, for the Hebrews overthrew their  cities; and their calamities came upon them on the occasion following.    3. Noah, when, after the deluge, the earth was resettled in its former  condition, set about its cultivation; and when he had planted it with  vines, and when the fruit was ripe, and he had gathered the grapes in  their season, and the wine was ready for use, he offered sacrifice, and  feasted, and, being drunk, he fell asleep, and lay naked in an unseemly  manner. When his youngest son saw this, he came laughing, and showed him  to his brethren; but they covered their father's nakedness. And when  Noah was made sensible of what had been done, he prayed for prosperity  to his other sons; but for Ham, he did not curse him, by reason of his  nearness in blood, but cursed his prosperity: and when the rest of them  escaped that curse, God inflicted it on the children of Canaan. But as  to these matters, we shall speak more hereafter.    4. Shem, the third son of Noah, had five sons, who inhabited the land  that began at Euphrates, and reached to the Indian Ocean. For Elam left  behind him the Elamites, the ancestors of the Persians. Ashur lived at  the city Nineve; and named his subjects Assyrians, who became the most  fortunate nation, beyond others. Arphaxad named the Arphaxadites, who  are now called Chaldeans. Aram had the Aramites, which the Greeks called  Syrians; as Laud founded the Laudites, which are now called Lydians. Of  the four sons of Aram, Uz founded Trachonitis and Damascus: this country  lies between Palestine and Celesyria. Ul founded Armenia; and Gather the  Bactrians; and Mesa the Mesaneans; it is now called Charax Spasini. Sala  was the son of Arphaxad; and his son was Heber, from whom they  originally called the Jews Hebrews. 18 Heber begat Joetan and Phaleg: he  was called Phaleg, because he was born at the dispersion of the nations  to their several countries; for Phaleg among the Hebrews signifies  division. Now Joctan, one of the sons of Heber, had these sons, Elmodad,  Saleph, Asermoth, Jera, Adoram, Aizel, Decla, Ebal, Abimael, Sabeus,  Ophir, Euilat, and Jobab. These inhabited from Cophen, an Indian river,  and in part of Asia adjoining to it. And this shall suffice concerning  the sons of Shem.    5. I will now treat of the Hebrews. The son of Phaleg, whose father Was  Heber, was Ragau; whose son was Serug, to whom was born Nahor; his son  was Terah, who was the father of Abraham, who accordingly was the tenth  from Noah, and was born in the two hundred and ninety-second year after  the deluge; for Terah begat Abram in his seventieth year. Nahor begat  Haran when he was one hundred and twenty years old; Nahor was born to  Serug in his hundred and thirty-second year; Ragau had Serug at one  hundred and thirty; at the same age also Phaleg had Ragau; Heber begat  Phaleg in his hundred and thirty-fourth year; he himself being begotten  by Sala when he was a hundred and thirty years old, whom Arphaxad had  for his son at the hundred and thirty-fifth year of his age. Arphaxad  was the son of Shem, and born twelve years after the deluge. Now Abram  had two brethren, Nahor and Haran: of these Haran left a son, Lot; as  also Sarai and Milcha his daughters; and died among the Chaldeans, in a  city of the Chaldeans, called Ur; and his monument is shown to this day.  These married their nieces. Nabor married Milcha, and Abram married  Sarai. Now Terah hating Chaldea, on account of his mourning for Ilaran,  they all removed to Haran of Mesopotamia, where Terah died, and was  buried, when he had lived to be two hundred and five years old; for the  life of man was already, by degrees, diminished, and became shorter than  before, till the birth of Moses; after whom the term of human life was  one hundred and twenty years, God determining it to the length that  Moses happened to live. Now Nahor had eight sons by Milcha; Uz and Buz,  Kemuel, Chesed, Azau, Pheldas, Jadelph, and Bethuel. These were all the  genuine sons of Nahor; for Teba, and Gaam, and Tachas, and Maaca, were  born of Reuma his concubine: but Bethuel had a daughter, Rebecca, and a  son, Laban.              CHAPTER 7. How Abram Our Forefather Went Out Of The Land Of The  Chaldeans, And Lived In The Land Then Called Canaan But Now Judea.    1. Now Abram, having no son of his own, adopted Lot, his brother Haran's  son, and his wife Sarai's brother; "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2849"],[0,"Against Apion (#10)"],[1,"invited from another  place for so doing, when the natural Egyptians themselves had done the  same things before their coming, and had taken oaths so to do. However,  \"Amenophis, some time afterward, came upon them, and conquered them  in battle, and slew his enemies, and drove them before him as far as  Syria.\" As if Egypt were so easily taken by people that came from any  place whatsoever, and as if those that had conquered it by war, when  they were informed that Amenophis was alive, did neither fortify the  avenues out of Ethiopia into it, although they had great advantages for  doing it, nor did get their other forces ready for their defense! but  that he followed them over the sandy desert, and slew them as far as  Syria; while yet it is rot an easy thing for an army to pass over that  country, even without fighting.    30. Our nation, therefore, according to Manetho, was not derived from  Egypt, nor were any of the Egyptians mingled with us. For it is to be  supposed that many of the leprous and distempered people were dead  in the mines, since they had been there a long time, and in so ill  a condition; many others must be dead in the battles that happened  afterward, and more still in the last battle and flight after it.    31. It now remains that I debate with Manetho about Moses. Now the  Egyptians acknowledge him to have been a wonderful and a divine person;  nay, they would willingly lay claim to him themselves, though after  a most abusive and incredible manner, and pretend that he was of  Heliopolis, and one of the priests of that place, and was ejected out  of it among the rest, on account of his leprosy; although it had  been demonstrated out of their records that he lived five hundred and  eighteen years earlier, and then brought our forefathers out of Egypt  into the country that is now inhabited by us. But now that he was  not subject in his body to any such calamity, is evident from what he  himself tells us; for he forbade those that had the leprosy either to  continue in a city, or to inhabit in a village, but commanded that they  should go about by themselves with their clothes rent; and declares that  such as either touch them, or live under the same roof with them, should  be esteemed unclean; nay, more, if any one of their disease be healed,  and he recover his natural constitution again, he appointed them certain  purifications, and washings with spring water, and the shaving off all  their hair, and enjoins that they shall offer many sacrifices, and those  of several kinds, and then at length to be admitted into the holy city;  although it were to be expected that, on the contrary, if he had been  under the same calamity, he should have taken care of such persons  beforehand, and have had them treated after a kinder manner, as affected  with a concern for those that were to be under the like misfortunes with  himself. Nor was it only those leprous people for whose sake he made  these laws, but also for such as should be maimed in the smallest part  of their body, who yet are not permitted by him to officiate as priests;  nay, although any priest, already initiated, should have such a calamity  fall upon him afterward, he ordered him to be deprived of his honor of  officiating. How can it then be supposed that Moses should ordain such  laws against himself, to his own reproach and damage who so ordained  them? Nor indeed is that other notion of Manetho at all probable,  wherein he relates the change of his name, and says that \"he was  formerly called Osarsiph;\" and this a name no way agreeable to the  other, while his true name was Mosses, and signifies a person who is  preserved out of the water, for the Egyptians call water Moil. I think,  therefore, I have made it sufficiently evident that Manetho, while he  followed his ancient records, did not much mistake the truth of the  history; but that when he had recourse to fabulous stories, without any  certain author, he either forged them himself, without any probability,  or else gave credit to some men who spake so out of their ill-will to  us.    32. And now I have done with Manetho, I will inquire into what Cheremon  says. For he also, when he pretended to write the Egyptian history, sets  down the same name for this king that Manetho did, Amenophis, as also of  his son Ramesses, and then goes on thus: \"The goddess Isis appeared  to Amenophis in his sleep, and blamed him that her temple had been  demolished in the war. But that Phritiphantes, the sacred scribe, said  to him, that in case he would purge Egypt of the men that had pollutions  upon them, he should be no longer troubled with such frightful  apparitions. That Amenophis accordingly chose out two hundred and fifty  thousand of those that were thus diseased, and cast them out of the  country: that Moses and Joseph were scribes, and Joseph was a sacred  scribe; that their names were Egyptian originally; that of Moses had  been Tisithen, and that of Joseph, Peteseph: that these two came to  Pelusium, and lighted upon three hundred and eighty thousand that had  been left there by Amenophis, he not being willing to carry them into  Egypt; that these scribes made a league of friendship with them, and  made with them an expedition against Egypt: that Amenophis could not  sustain their attacks, but fled into Ethiopia, and left his wife with  child behind him, who lay concealed in certain caverns, and there  brought forth a son, whose name was Messene, and who, when he was grown  up to man's estate, pursued the Jews into Syria, being about two hundred  thousand, and then received his father Amenophis out of Ethiopia.\"    33. This is the account Cheremon gives us. Now I take it for granted  that what I have said already hath plainly proved the falsity of both  these narrations; for had there been any real truth at the bottom, it  was impossible they should so greatly disagree about the particulars.  But for those that invent lies, what they write will easily give us very  different accounts, while they forge what they please out of their own  heads. Now Manetho says that the king's desire of seeing the gods was  the origin of the ejection of the polluted people; but Cheremon feigns  that it was a dream of his own, sent upon him by Isis, that was the  occasion of it. Manetho says that the person who foreshowed this  purgation of Egypt to the king was Amenophis; but this man says it was  Phritiphantes. As to the numbers of the multitude that were expelled,  they agree exceedingly well [24] the former reckoning them eighty  thousand, and the latter about two hundred and fifty thousand! Now, for  Manetho, he describes those polluted persons as sent first to work in  the quarries, and says that the city Avaris was given them for their  habitation. As also he relates that it was not till after they had made  war with the rest of the Egyptians, that they invited the people of  Jerusalem to come to their assistance; while Cheremon says only that  they were gone out of Egypt, and lighted upon three hundred and eighty  thousand men about Pelusium, who had been left there by Amenophis, and  so they invaded Egypt with them again; that thereupon Amenophis fled  into Ethiopia. But then this Cheremon commits a most ridiculous blunder  in not informing us who this army of so many ten thousands were, or  whence they came; whether they were native Egyptians, or whether they  came from a foreign country. Nor indeed has this man, who forged a dream  from Isis about the leprous people, assigned the reason why the king  would not bring them into Egypt. Moreover, Cheremon sets down Joseph as  driven away at the same time with Moses, who yet died four generations  [25] before Moses, which four generations make almost one hundred and  seventy years. Besides all this, Ramesses, the son of Amenophis, by  Manetho's account, was a young man, and assisted his father in his war,  and left the country at the same time with him, and fled into Ethiopia.  But Cheremon makes him to have been born in a certain cave, after his  father was dead, and that he then overcame the Jews in battle, and  drove them into Syria, being in number about two hundred thousand. O the  levity of the man! for he had neither told us who these three hundred  and eighty thousand were, nor how the four hundred and thirty thousand  perished; whether they fell in war, or went over to Ramesses. And, what  is the strangest of all, it is not possible to learn out of him who they  were whom he calls Jews, or to which of these two parties he applies  that denomination, whether to the two hundred and fifty thousand leprous  people, or to the three hundred and eighty thousand that were about  Pelusium. But perhaps it will be looked upon as a silly thing in me  to make any larger confutation of such writers as sufficiently confute  themselves; for had they been only confuted by other men, it had been  more tolerable.    34. I shall now add to these accounts about Manethoand Cheremon somewhat  about Lysimachus, who hath taken the same topic of falsehood with those  forementioned, but hath gone far beyond them in the incredible nature of  his forgeries; which plainly demonstrates that he contrived them out of  his virulent hatred of our nation. His words are these: \"The people of  the Jews being leprous and scabby, and subject to certain other kinds  of distempers, in the days of Bocchoris, king of Egypt, they fled to the  temples, and got their food there by begging: and as the numbers were  very great that were fallen under these diseases, there arose a scarcity  in Egypt. Hereupon Bocehoris, the king of Egypt, sent some to consult  the oracle of [Jupiter] Hammon about his scarcity. The god's answer  was this, that he must purge his temples of impure and impious men, by  expelling them out of those temples into desert places; but as to the  scabby and leprous people, he must drown them, and purge his temples,  the sun having an indignation at"]]]
