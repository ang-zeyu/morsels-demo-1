[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30000"],[0,"The Bird Book (#10)"],[1," of California. This species breeds in large numbers on the island  from which it takes its name. The birds are white with the exception of  the back, wings and tail, which are black. The birds, having been little  molested in their remote island, are exceedingly tame, and it is  possible to go among the sitting birds without disturbing them. Mr.  Walter K. Fisher has contributed an admirable report on this species in  the 1913 Bulletin of the Fish Commission, the report being illustrated  with numerous illustrations of the birds from photos by the author.  Their single white eggs are laid on the bare ground.    83. YELLOW-NOSED ALBATROSS. _Thalassogeron culminatus._    This is a species which inhabits the South Pacific and Indian Oceans,  and is said to rarely occur on the California coast. They breed during  our winter on some of the small islands and during our summer are ocean  wanderers. An egg in the collection of Col. John E. Thayer was taken on  Gough Island, South Atlantic Ocean; Sept. 1st, 1888. The nest was a  mound of mud and grass about two feet in height. The single white egg  measured 3.75 x 2.25. It was collected by George Comer.      84. SOOTY ALBATROSS. _Phoebetria-palpebrata._    Range.--Southern seas, north in our summer along the Pacific coast of  the United States.    This species is entirely sooty brown except the white eyelids. It is  similar to the Black-footed Albatross from which species it can be  distinguished in all plumages by the narrow base of the bill, while the  bill of the former species is broad and rounded. They breed commonly on  isolated islands in many quarters of the southern hemisphere. Sometimes  this species constructs a mound of mud on which to deposit its single  white egg, and also often lays it on the bare ground or rock. A specimen  in Mr. Thayer's collection, taken by Geo. Comer on So. Georgia Is. in  the South Atlantic ocean, was laid in a hollow among loose stones on the  ledge of an overhanging cliff. Size 4.10 x 2.75.    [Illustration 062: Laysan Albatross. Yellow-nosed Albatross. Sooty  Albatross.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 61    FULMARS, SHEARWATERS and PETRELS Family PROCELLARIDAE    Fulmars, Shearwaters and Petrels are Gull-like birds with two nostril  tubes located side by side, in a single tube, on the top of the bill at  its base.    The Fulmars are mostly northern birds while the majority of the  Shearwaters nest in the extreme south during our winter, and appear off  our coasts during the summer. Their food consists of fish or offal which  they get from the surface of the water; large flocks of them hover about  fishermen, watching their chance to get any food which falls, or is  thrown, overboard.    [Illustration 063: EGG OF SOOTY ALBATROSS--White.]  [Illustration: deco.]  [Illustration: right hand border.]    Page 62    85. GIANT FULMAR. _Macronectes gigantea._    Range.--This Petrel is a native of the southern seas and is only  casually met with off the Pacific coast.    It is the largest of the family, being about three feet in length, and  is normally a uniform sooty color, although it has light phases of  plumage. They nest in December on many of the islands south of Africa  and South America, laying their single white egg on the bare rocks.      86. FULMAR. _Fulmarus glacialis glacialis._    Range.--North Atlantic coasts from New England northward, breeding from  Hudson Bay and southern Greenland northward.    This bird which is 19 inches in length, in the light phase has a plumage  very similar to that of the larger Gulls. They nest by thousands on  rocky islands of the north, often in company with Murres and Gulls.  Owing to the filthy habits of the Fulmars, these breeding grounds always  have a nauseating odor, which is also imparted to, and retained by the  egg shell. Their single white eggs are laid on the bare rocks, in  crevices of the cliffs, often hundreds of feet above the water. Size  2.90 x 2.00. Data.--St. Kilda, off Scotland. June 5, 1897. Single egg  laid on rock on side of sea cliff. Collector, Angus Gillies.    [Illustration 062: Fulmar.]  [Illustration: egg.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 63    86b. PACIFIC FULMAR. _Fulmarus glacialis glupischa._    This sub-species of the preceding, has a darker mantle than the common  Fulmar; it is found on the northern Pacific coasts where it breeds on  the high rocky cliffs, the same as its eastern relative. They nest in  large colonies, every crevice in the rocks having its tenant. Their  flight is graceful like that of the Gulls, which they closely resemble.  They lay but a single white egg, the average dimensions of which are  slightly smaller than those of the common Fulmar. Data.--Copper Is.,  Alaska. May 14, 1889. Egg laid in a crevice among the cliffs.      86.1. RODGER'S FULMAR. _Fulmarus rodgers._    Range.--North Pacific, breeding in large numbers on some of the islands  in Bering Sea; south to California in winter. Very similar to the two  preceding species except that the back is mixed with whitish, it is not  believed to have a dark phase. Their breeding habits and eggs do not  differ from the common Fulmar. The eggs are laid on the rocky cliffs  during June.      87. SLENDER-BILLED FULMAR. _Priocella glacialoides._    Range.--Southern seas, appearing on the Pacific coast of the United  States in the summer. This species has a paler mantle than the others of  the family, and the primaries are black. The make-up and plumage of the  whole bird is more like that of the Gulls than any of the others. They  probably breed in the far south during our winter, although we have no  definite data relative to their nesting habits.    [Illustration 065: Pacific Fulmar. Slender-billed Fulmar.]  [Illustration: deco.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 64    88. CORY'S SHEARWATER. _Puffinus borealis._    This species probably breeds in the far south. It has been found only  off the coast of Massachusetts and Long Island. This is the largest of  our Shearwaters, and can be distinguished from the next species by its  wholly white underparts, its light mantle and yellowish bill. We have no  data relative to its nesting habits.      89. GREATER SHEARWATER. _Puffinus gravis._    Range.--The whole of the Atlantic Ocean.    Thousands of them spend the latter part of the summer off the New  England coast, where they are known to the fishermen as Haglets. Their  upper parts are brownish gray, darker on the wings; bill and feet dark;  underparts white, with the middle of the belly and the under tail covers  dusky. Length about 20 inches. Little is known concerning their nesting  quarters, although they are said to breed in Greenland. From the fact of  their early appearance off the New England coast it is probable that the  greater part of them nest in the far south.      90. MANX SHEARWATER. _Puffinus puffinus._    This species inhabits the North Atlantic ocean chiefly on the European  side, being abundant in the Mediterranean and in the British Isles.  These birds deposit their single pure white eggs in crevices among the  cliffs, on the ground or in burrows dug by themselves. Size of egg 2.35  x 1.60. Data.--Isle of Hay, North Scotland. June 1, 1893. Single egg  laid at the end of a three foot burrow.    [Illustration 066: Cory Shearwater. Greater Shearwater.]  [Illustration: Egg of Audubon's Shearwater--White.]  [Illustration: Audubon's Shearwater.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 65    91. PINK-FOOTED SHEARWATER. _Puffinus creatopus._    Range.--Pacific Ocean, north on American side to California in summer.    This species, whose breeding habits are little known, is similar in size  and color to the Greater Shearwater, differing chiefly in the yellowish  bill and pinkish colored feet.      92. AUDUBON'S SHEARWATER. _Puffinus lherminieri._    Range.--Middle Atlantic, ranging north in late summer to Long Island.    This bird, having a length of but twelve inches, is the smallest of the  Shearwaters found along our coasts. Large colonies of them breed on some  of the small islands and keys of the West Indies and Bahamas, and not so  commonly in the Bermudas. Their eggs, which are pure white, are  deposited at the end of burrows dug by the birds. Size of egg 2.00 x  1.35. Their nesting season commences about the latter part of March and  continues through April and May. After the young are able to fly, like  other members of the family, the birds become ocean wanderers and stray  north to southern New England. Data.--Bahamas, April 13, 1891. Single  egg laid at the end of a burrow about two feet in length. Collector, D.  P. Ingraham.      92.1. ALLIED SHEARWATER. _Puffinus assimilis._    This is an Australian and New Zealand species that has accidentally  strayed to the shores of Nova Scotia.      93. BLACK-VENTED SHEARWATER. _Puffinus opisthomelas._    Range.--Middle Pacific coast of the Americas, north in late summer along  the coast of California. This species breeds commonly on the islands off  the coast of Lower California, especially on the Gulf side. Their single  egg is white, size 2.00 x 1.30, and is located at the end of a burrow.  Data.--Natividad Is., Lower California, April 10, 1897. Single egg laid  on the sand at the end of a burrow six feet in length. Collector, A. W.  Anthony.      93.1. TOWNSEND'S SHEARWATER. _Puffinus auricularis._    This bird ranges from Cape St. Lucas, south along the Pacific coast of  Mexico, breeding on the Revillagigedo Islands off the Mexican coast.    [Illustration 067: Pink-footed Shearwater. Black-vented Shearwater.  Townsend's Shearwater.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 66    94. SOOTY SHEARWATER. _Puffins fuliginosus._    Range.--A common species off the Atlantic coast in summer; breeds along  our northern coasts, and it is also supposed that many of them nest in  southern seas and reach our coasts early in the summer.

Tradition of escapement clocks continues      and degenerates into simple time-keepers  ------------------------------------------------------------------------    There is therefore reasonable grounds for supporting the medieval  European tradition that the magnetic compass had first come from China,  though one cannot well admit that the first news of it was brought, as  the legend states, by Marco Polo, when he returned home in 1260. There  might well have been another wave of interest, giving the impetus to  Peter Peregrinus at this time, but an earlier transmission, perhaps  along the silk road or by travelers in crusades, must be postulated to  account for the evidence in Europe, _ca._ 1200. The earlier influx does  not play any great part in our main story; it arrived in Europe before  the transmission of astronomy from Islam had got under way sufficiently  to make protoclocks a subject of interest. For a second transmission, we  have already seen how the relevant texts seem to cluster, in France  _ca._ 1270, around a complex in which the protoclocks seem combined with  the ideas of perpetual motion wheels and with new information about the  magnetic compass.    The point of this paper is that such a complex exists, cutting across  the histories of the clock, the various types of astronomical machines,  and the magnetic compass, and including the origin of \"self-moving  wheels.\" It seems to trace a path extending from China, through India  and through Eastern and Western Islam, ending in Europe in the Middle  Ages. This path is not a simple one, for the various elements make their  appearances in different combinations from place to place, sometimes one  may be dominant, sometimes another may be absent. Only by treating it as  a whole has it been possible to produce the threads of continuity which  will, I hope, make further research possible, circumventing the blind  alleys found in the past and leading eventually to a complete  understanding of the first complicated scientific machines.        FOOTNOTES:      [1] This traditional view is expressed by almost every history    of horology. An ultimate source for many of these has been the    following two classic treatments: J. Beckmann, _A history of    inventions and discoveries_, 4th ed., London, 1846, vol. 1, pp.    340 ff. A. P. Usher, _A history of mechanical inventions_, 2nd    ed., Harvard University Press. 1954, pp. 191 ff., 304 ff.      [2] There is a considerable literature dealing with the later    evolution of perpetual motion devices. The most comprehensive    treatment is H. Dircks, _Perpetuum mobile_, London, 1861; 2nd    ser., London, 1870. So far as I know there has not previously    been much discussion of the history of such devices before the    renaissance.      [3] For the early history of gearing in the West see C.    Matschoss, _Geschichte des Zahnrades_, Berlin, 1940. Also F. M.    Feldhaus, _Die geschichtliche Entwicklung des Zahnrades in    Theorie und Praxis_, Berlin, 1911.      [4] A general account of these important archaeological objects    will be published by J. Needham, _Science and civilisation in    China_, Cambridge, 1959(?), vol. 4. The original publications    (in Chinese) are as follows: Wang Chen-to, \"Investigations and    reproduction in model form of the south-pointing carriage and    hodometer,\" _National Peiping Academy Historical Journal_,    1937, vol. 3, p. 1. Liu Hsien-chou, \"Chinese inventions in    horological engineering,\" _Ch'ing-Hua University Engineering    Journal_, 1956, vol. 4, p. 1.      [5] For illustrations of intermeshing worms in Indian cotton    mills, see Matschoss, _op. cit._ (footnote 3), figs. 5, 6, 7,    p. 7.      [6] It is interesting to note that the Chinese hodometer was    contemporary with that of Hero and Vitruvius and very similar    in design. There is no evidence whatsoever upon which to decide    whether there may have been a specific transmission of this    invention or even a \"stimulus diffusion.\"      [7] A summary of the content of the manuscript sources,    illustrated by the original drawings, has been published by H.    Alan Lloyd, _Giovanni de Dondi's horological masterpiece,    1364_, without date or imprint (?Lausanne, 1955), 23 pp. It    should be remarked that de Dondi declines to describe the    workings of his crown and foliot escapement (though it is well    illustrated) saying that this is of the \"common\" variety and if    the reader does not understand such simple things he need not    hope to comprehend the complexities of this mighty clock. But    this may be bravado to quite a large degree.      [8] See, for example, the chronological tables of the 14th    century and the later mentions of clocks in E. Zinner, _Aus der    Fruehzeit der Raederuhr_, Munich, 1954, p. 29 ff. Unfortunately    this very complete treatment tends to confuse the factual and    legendary sources prior to the clock of de Dondi; it also    accepts the very doubtful evidence of the \"escapement\" drawn by    Villard of Honnecourt (see p. 107). An excellent and fully    illustrated account of monumental astronomical clocks    throughout the world is given by Alfred Ungerer, _Les horloges    astronomiques_, Strasbourg, 1931, 514 pp. Available accounts of    the development of the planetarium since the middle ages are    very brief and especially weak on the early history: Helmut    Werner, _From the Aratus globe to the Zeiss planetarium_,    Stuttgart, 1957; C. A. Crommelin, \"Planetaria, a historical    survey,\" _Antiquarian Horology_, 1955, vol. 1, pp. 70-75.      [9] Derek J.
