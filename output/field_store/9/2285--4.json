The origin of the Afrikander Bond is to be found in the articles  written by the Rev. S. J. du Toit, a Dutch predikant, in _De Patriot_,  a newspaper published at the Paarl, of which he was the editor. Mr. du  Toit's political standpoint is sufficiently revealed by the fact that  in 1881 he claimed that _De Patriot_ had done more than any other  single agency to secure the successful revolt of the Boers from  British authority accomplished in that year. The inspiration which  drove his pen to advocate the founding of a political organisation,  that should serve to prepare the way for a more general and complete  \"war of independence,\" was the defeat of the British troops by the  Transvaal burghers.         \"This is now our time,\" he wrote, in the same year, \"to establish       the Bond, while a national consciousness has been awakened       through the Transvaal War. And the Bond must be our preparation       for the future confederation of all the States and Colonies of       South Africa. The English Government keeps talking of a       confederation under the British flag. That will never happen. We       can assure them of that. We have often said it: there is just one       hindrance to confederation, and that is the English flag. Let       them take that away, and the confederation under the free       Afrikander flag would be established. But so long as the English       flag remains here the Afrikander Bond must be our confederation.       And the British will, after a while, realise that Froude's advice       is the best for them: they must just have Simon's Bay as a naval       and military station on the road to India, and give over all the       rest of South Africa to the Afrikanders.\"[21]             [Footnote 21: Reprint of a pamphlet (found with the first           leaf torn) containing an English translation of _De           Transvaalse Oorlog_, p. 8.]    This general statement of the purpose of the Bond was supported by  reiterated appeals to racial passion:         \"The little respect which the Afrikander had for British troops       and cannons [up to the Majuba defeat],\" he writes, \"is utterly       done away. And England has learnt so much respect for us       Afrikanders that she will take care not to be so ready to make       war with us again.... The Englishman has made himself hated,       language and all. And this is well.\"    [Sidenote: The objects of the Bond.]    When, by the use of these and even more violent expressions, the mind  of the Dutch population had been sufficiently aroused, Du Toit  proceeded to unfold his plan of campaign. His _modus operandi_ is  similar to that of Borckenhagen in its main features. The Bond, says  _De Patriot_, must boycott all English traders, except only those who  are ready to adopt its principles. English signboards, advertisements,  shops and book-keepers, must be abolished. The English banks must be  replaced by a National Bank. No land must be sold to Englishmen. The  Republics must \"make their own ammunition, and be well supplied with  cannon, and provide a regiment of artillery to work them.\" And he  cheerfully notices that \"at Heidelberg there are already 4,000  cartridges made daily, and a few skilful Afrikanders have begun to  make shells, too. This is right: so must we become a nation.\" For the  Cape Colony, however, \"such preparations are not so especially  necessary.\" But, most of all, Du Toit insists upon the need of  combating the growing use of the English language. \"English  education,\" he laments, \"has done more mischief to our country and  nation than we can express.\" And, therefore, he urges \"war\" against  the English language. In the schools, in the Church, and \"in our  family life above all,\" it must be considered a \"disgrace to speak  English.... Who will join the war? All true Afrikanders, we hope.\"    Thus was the Bond, the child of Majuba, quickened into conscious being  by the fiery pen of the predikant, Du Toit. Poor Du Toit! His after  life was a strange commentary upon this early triumph of his brain,  won in the drowsy solitudes of the Paarl. Summoned to be Director of  Education in the Transvaal, he was quickly disillusioned of his love  of his Dutch mother-country by actual intercourse with the  contemptuous Hollanders whom Krueger had invited to serve the Republic.  Later, again, he was rejected by the Bond which he had himself  created, and driven to find comfort in the broad freedom of allegiance  to an Empire-state.    The object of the Bond, as stated by Du Toit in _De Transvaalse  Oorlog_, was the \"creation of a South African nationality ... through  the establishment of this Bond in all states and colonies of South  Africa.\" Its organisation was to consist of a central governing body  (_bestuur_), with provincial, district, and ward _besturen_. The  central _bestuur_ was to be composed of five members, two for the Cape  Colony, and one each for the Transvaal, Natal, and Free State, who  were \"to meet yearly in one or other of the chief towns of the  component states.\" The provincial _besturen_, consisting of one  representative from each of the district _besturen_, were to meet  every six months at their respective colonial or state capitals.[22]             [Footnote 22: _De Transvaalse Oorlog_, pp. 7 and 8.]    The first Congress of the Afrikander Bond was held at Graaf Reinet in  1882. In the draft constitution then drawn up for the approval of its  members, the relationship of the Bond to the British Government in  South Africa was defined with commendable frankness. In the \"Programme  of Principles\" was the article:         In itself acknowledging no single form of government as the only       suitable form, and whilst acknowledging the form of government       existing at present, [the Bond] means that the aim of our       national development must be a united South Africa under its own       flag.    [Sidenote: Hofmeyr's influence.]    And it was upon the basis of this \"Programme of Principles\" that the  earliest Bond organisations were formed in the Transvaal, the Free  State, and the Cape Colony. In the year following the Graaf Reinet  Congress, however, the \"Farmers' Protection Association\" was  amalgamated with the Bond in the Cape Colony, and the influence of Mr.  J. H. Hofmeyr led the joint organisation to adopt a modified  \"programme.\" Mr. Hofmeyr, who was destined afterwards to assume the  undisputed headship of the Bond, was an economist as well as a  nationalist. He was intensely interested in the development of the  country districts, and he saw that the conditions of agriculture could  hardly be improved without the co-operation of the British and more  progressive section of the farming class. He also knew that an  organisation, professing to forward aims of avowed disloyalty, would  rapidly find itself in collision with the Cape Government. With the  growth of Mr. Hofmeyr's influence the policy, though not the aims, of  the Bond was changed. All declarations, such as the clause \"under its  own flag,\" inconsistent with allegiance to the British Crown were  omitted from the official constitution, and its individual members  were exhorted to avoid any behaviour or expressions likely to prevent  Englishmen from joining the organisation. As early as 1884 the Bond  secured the return of twenty-five members to the Cape Parliament, and  it was their support that enabled the Upington Ministry to maintain  itself in office against an opposition which consisted of the main  body of the representatives elected by the British population; and  from this date onwards it was the recognised aim of Mr. Hofmeyr to  control the Legislature of the Colony by making it impossible for any  ministry to dispense with the support of the Bond members, although he  refrained from putting a ministry of Bondsmen into office. To have  done this latter might have united the British population and their  representatives in a solid phalanx, and endangered the success of the  effort to separate the British settlers in the country districts from  the more recent arrivals from England--mostly townsmen--which remained  a fruitful source of Afrikander influence up to the time of the  Jameson Raid. By representing the new British population, which  followed in the wake of the mineral discoveries, as \"fortune-seekers\"  and adventurers and not genuine colonists, the Bond endeavoured, not  merely to widen the natural line of cleavage between the townsman and  the countryman, but actually to detach the older British settlers from  sympathy with the mother country, and, by drawing them within the  sphere of Afrikander nationalist aspirations, to make them share its  own antagonism to British supremacy.    [Sidenote: Merriman and the Bond.]    But, in spite of the change of policy due to Mr. Hofmeyr, the old  leaven of stalwart Bondsmen remained sufficiently in evidence to draw  from Mr. J. X. Merriman--then a strong Imperialist in close  association with Mr. J. W. Leonard--a striking rebuke. The speech in  question was made, fittingly enough, at Grahamstown, the most  \"English\" town in South Africa, in 1885. It was reprinted with  complete appropriateness, in _The Cape Times_ of July 10th, 1899. The  struggle which Mr. Merriman had foreseen fourteen years before was  then near at hand; while Mr."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26500"],[0,"Anecdotes of Dogs (#10)"],[1,"be killed and  eaten by the dog; but his intentions were of a more benevolent nature.  After guarding the entrance of the kennel for some time, he trotted  down the yard into the street, looked about to the right and left, and  seeing that the coast was clear, he went back again, and once more  returning with his _protege_ in his mouth, safely deposited him in the  street, and then walked quietly away. How few human beings would have  acted as this dog had done!    Here is another curious anecdote from Mr. Davy's work. He says that  the cook in the house of a friend of his, a lady on whose accuracy he  could rely, and from whom he had the anecdote, missed a marrow-bone.  Suspicion fell on a well-behaved dog--a great favourite, and up to  that time distinguished for his honesty. He was charged with the  theft; he hung down his tail, and for a day or two was altered in his  manner, having become shy, sullen, and sheepish, to use these  expressions for want of better. In this mood he continued, till, to  the amusement of the cook, he brought back the bone and laid it at her  feet. Then, with the restoration of her stolen property, he resumed  his cheerful manner. How can we interpret this conduct of the dog,  better than by supposing that he was aware he had done amiss, and that  the evil doing preyed on him till he had made restitution? Was not  this a kind of moral sense?    If a dog finds a bone while he is accompanying his master in a walk,  he does not stay behind to gnaw it, but runs some distance in  advance, attacks the bone, waits till his master comes up, and then  proceeds forward again with it. By acting in this manner, he never  loses sight of his master.    A dog has been known to convey food to another of his species who was  tied up and pining for want of it. A dog has frequently been seen to  plunge voluntarily into a rapid stream, to rescue another that was in  danger of drowning. He has defended helpless curs from the attacks of  other dogs, and learns to apportion punishment according to the  provocation received, frequently disdaining to exercise his power and  strength on a weaker adversary. Repeated provocation will, however,  excite and revenge. For instance, a Newfoundland dog was quietly  eating his mess of broth and broken scraps. While so employed, a  turkey endeavoured to share the meal with him. The dog growled, and  displayed his teeth. The intruder retired for a moment, but quickly  returned to the charge, and was again \"warned off,\" with a like  result. After three or four attempts of the same kind, the dog became  provoked, gave a sudden ferocious growl, bit off the delinquent's  head, and then quietly finished his meal, without bestowing any  further attention on his victim.    The celebrated Leibnitz related to the French Academy an account of a  dog he had seen which was taught to speak, and could call in an  intelligible manner for tea, coffee, chocolate, &c.    The dog was of a middling size, and the property of a peasant in  Saxony. A little boy, the peasant's son, imagined that he perceived in  the dog's voice an indistinct resemblance to certain words, and was,  therefore, determined to teach him to speak distinctly. For this  purpose he spared neither time nor pains with his pupil, who was about  three years old when his learned education commenced; and at length he  made such progress in language, as to be able to articulate no less  than thirty words. It appears, however, that he was somewhat of a  truant, and did not very willingly exert his talents, being rather  pressed into the service of literature, and it was necessary that the  words should be first pronounced to him each time before he spoke. The  French Academicians who mention this anecdote, add, that unless they  had received the testimony of so great a man as Leibnitz, they should  scarcely have dared to relate the circumstance.    An invalid gentleman, who resided for some years on Ham Common, in  Surrey, had a dog which distinctly pronounced John, William, and two  or three other words. A medical friend of mine, who attended this  gentleman, has frequently heard the animal utter these words; and a  female relative of his, who was often on a visit at his house, assures  me of the fact. Indeed it need not be doubted.    These are the only two instances I have met with of talking dogs, but  my brother had a beautiful little spaniel, named Doll, who was an  indefatigable hunter after woodcocks and snipes. Doll would come home  in the evening after a hard day's sport, wet, tired and dirty, and  then deposit herself on the rug before the fire. Happening one day to  pull her ear gently when in this state, she expressed her dislike to  be disturbed by a sort of singing noise. By repeating this from day to  day, and saying \"Sing, Doll,\" she would utter notes of a somewhat  musical tone, and continue for some time after I had ceased to touch  her ear, to the amusement and surprise of those who heard her. Poor  Doll! I shall never see your like again, either for beauty or  intelligence. If she was affronted she would come to me, at a distance  of four miles, remain some time, and then return to her master.    A small cur, blind of one eye, lame, ugly, old, and somewhat selfish,  yet possessed of great shrewdness, was usually fed with three large  dogs. Watching his opportunity, he generally contrived to seize the  best bit of offal or bone, with which he retreated into a recess, the  opening to which was so small that he knew the other dogs could not  follow him into it, and where he enjoyed his repast without the fear  of molestation.    Early habits predominate strongly in dogs, and indeed in other  animals. At the house of a gentleman in Wexford, out of four dogs kept  to guard the premises, three of them would always wag their tails, and  express what might be called civility, on the approach of any  well-dressed visitors; manifesting, on the other hand, no very  friendly feelings towards vagrants or ill-dressed people. The  fourth,--a sort of fox-hound,--which, as a puppy, had belonged to a  poor man, always seemed to recognise beggars and ill-dressed  passengers as old familiar friends, growling at well-attired  strangers, barking vehemently at gigs, and becoming almost frantic  with rage at a four-wheeled carriage.    The olfactory nerves of a dog are quite extraordinary, and it is said  that, making allowance for difference of corporeal bulk, they are  about four times larger than those of a man. Some dogs, however, seem  to excel in acuteness of hearing, and others in peculiar powers of  vision.    We quote the following from the \"Percy Anecdotes:\"--    \"One day, when Dumont, a tradesman of the Rue St. Denis, was walking  in the Boulevard St. Antoine with a friend, he offered to lay a wager  with the latter, that if he were to hide a six-livre piece in the  dust, his dog would discover and bring it to him. The wager was  accepted, and the piece of money secreted, after being carefully  marked. When the two had proceeded some distance from the spot, M.  Dumont called to his dog that he had lost something, and ordered him  to seek it. Caniche immediately turned back, and his master and his  companion pursued their walk to the Rue St. Denis. Meanwhile a  traveller, who happened to be just then returning in a small chaise  from Vincennes, perceived the piece of money, which his horse had  kicked from its hiding-place; he alighted, took it up, and drove to  his inn, in the Rue Pont-aux-Choux. Caniche had just reached the spot  in search of the lost piece when the stranger picked it up. He  followed the chaise, went into the inn, and stuck close to the  traveller. Having scented out the coin which he had been ordered to  bring back in the pocket of the latter, he leaped up incessantly at  and about him. The traveller, supposing him to be some dog that had  been lost or left behind by his master, regarded his different  movements as marks of fondness; and as the animal was handsome, he  determined to keep him. He gave him a good supper, and on retiring to  bed took him with him to his chamber. No sooner had he pulled off his  breeches, than they were seized by the dog; the owner conceiving that  he wanted to play with them, took them away again. The animal began to  bark at the door, which the traveller opened, under the idea that the  dog wanted to go out. Caniche snatched up the breeches, and away he  flew. The traveller posted after him with his night-cap on, and  literally _sans culottes_. Anxiety for the fate of a purse full of  gold Napoleons, of forty francs each, which was in one of the pockets,  gave redoubled velocity to his steps. Caniche ran full speed to his  master's house, where the stranger arrived a moment afterwards,  breathless and enraged. He accused the dog of robbing him. 'Sir,' said  the master, 'my dog is a very faithful creature; and if he has run  away with your breeches, it is because you have in them money which  does not belong to you.' The traveller became still more exasperated.  'Compose yourself, sir,' rejoined the other, smiling; 'without doubt  there is in your purse a six-livre piece, with such and such marks,  which you have picked up in the Boulevard St. Antoine, and which I  threw down there with the firm conviction that my dog would bring it  back again. This is the cause of the robbery which he has committed  upon you.' The stranger's rage now yielded to astonishment; he  delivered the six-livre piece to the owner, and could not forbear  caressing the dog which had given him so much uneasiness, and such an  unpleasant chase.\"    A gentleman in Cornwall possessed a dog, which seemed to set a value  on white and shining pebble stones, of which he had made a large  collection in a hole under an old tree. A dog in Regent Street is said  to have barked with joy on hearing the wheels of his master's carriage  driven to the door, when he could not by any possibility see the"]]]
