It was partly, indeed, to hasten settlement that the Ordinance  of 1785 for the survey and sale of the public lands was passed.**            * Jacob Piat Dunn, Jr., \"Indiana: A Redemption from Slavery,\"  1888.            ** Although the machinery was set in motion, by the appointment  of men and the beginning of work, it was not until 1789 that the survey  of the first seven ranges of townships was completed and the land  offered for sale.      In the meantime efforts were being made by Congress to improve the  unsatisfactory ordinance for the government of the West. Committees were  appointed, reports were made, and at intervals of weeks or months the  subject was considered. Some amendments were actually adopted, but  Congress, notoriously inefficient, hesitated to undertake a fundamental  revision of the ordinance. Then, suddenly, in July, 1787, after a brief  period of adjournment, Congress took up this subject and within a week  adopted the now famous Ordinance of 1787.    The stimulus which aroused Congress to activity seems to have come from  the Ohio Company. From the very beginning of the public domain there  was a strong sentiment in favor of using western land for settlement by  Revolutionary soldiers. Some of these lands had been offered as bounties  to encourage enlistment, and after the war the project of soldiers'  settlement in the West was vigorously agitated. The Ohio Company of  Associates was made up of veterans of the Revolution, who were looking  for homes in the West, and of other persons who were willing to support  a worthy cause by a subscription which might turn out to be a good  investment. The company wished to buy land in the West, and Congress had  land which it wished to sell. Under such circumstances it was easy to  strike a bargain. The land, as we have seen, was roughly estimated at  one dollar an acre; but, as the company wished to purchase a million  acres, it demanded and obtained wholesale rates of two-thirds of the  usual price. It also obtained the privilege of paying at least a portion  in certificates of Revolutionary indebtedness, some of which were worth  about twelve and a half cents on the dollar. Only a little calculation  is required to show that a large quantity of land was therefore sold at  about eight or nine cents an acre. It was in connection with this land  sale that the Ordinance of 1787 was adopted.    The promoter of this enterprise undertaken by the Ohio Company was  Manasseh Cutler of Ipswich, Massachusetts, a clergyman by profession who  had served as a chaplain in the Revolutionary War. But his interests and  activities extended far beyond the bounds of his profession. When the  people of his parish were without proper medical advice he applied  himself to the study and practice of medicine. At about the same time  he took up the study of botany, and because of his describing several  hundred species of plants he is regarded as the pioneer botanist of New  England. His next interest seems to have grown out of his Revolutionary  associations, for it centered in this project for settlement of the  West, and he was appointed the agent of the Ohio Company. It was in this  capacity that he had come to New York and made the bargain with Congress  which has just been described. Cutler must have been a good lobbyist,  for Congress was not an efficient body, and unremitting labor, as well  as diplomacy, was required for so large and important a matter. Two  things indicate his method of procedure. In the first place he found  it politic to drop his own candidate for the governorship of the new  territory and to endorse General Arthur St. Clair, then President of  Congress. And in the next place he accepted the suggestion of Colonel  William Duer for the formation of another company, known as the Scioto  Associates, to purchase five million acres of land on similar terms,  \"but that it should be kept a profound secret.\" It was not an accident  that Colonel Duer was Secretary of the Board of the Treasury through  whom these purchases were made, nor that associated with him in this  speculation were \"a number of the principal characters in the city.\"  These land deals were completed afterwards, but there is little doubt  that there was a direct connection between them and the adoption of the  ordinance of government.    The Ordinance of 1787 was so successful in its working and its renown  became so great that claims of authorship, even for separate articles,  have been filed in the name of almost every person who had the slightest  excuse for being considered. Thousands of pages have been written in  eulogy and in dispute, to the helpful clearing up of some points and to  the obscuring of others. But the authorship of this or of that clause is  of much less importance than the scope of the document as a working plan  of government. As such the Ordinance of 1787 owes much to Jefferson's  Ordinance of 1784. Under the new ordinance a governor and three judges  were to be appointed who, along with their other functions, were to  select such laws as they thought best from the statute books of all the  States. The second stage in self-government would be reached when the  population contained five thousand free men of age; then the people were  to have a representative legislature with the usual privilege of  making their own laws. Provision was made for dividing the whole region  northwest of the Ohio River into three or four or five districts and the  final stage of government was reached when any one of these districts  had sixty thousand free inhabitants, for it might then establish its own  constitution and government and be admitted into the Union on an equal  footing with the original States.    The last-named provision for admission into the Union, being in the  nature of a promise for the future, was not included in the body of  the document providing for the government, but was contained in certain  \"articles of compact, between the original States and the people and  States in the said territory, [which should] forever remain unalterable,  unless by common consent.\" These articles of compact were in general  similar to the bills of rights in State Constitutions; but one of them  found no parallel in any State Constitution. Article VI reads:  \"There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said  territory, otherwise than in the punishment of crimes, whereof the party  shall have been duly convicted.\" This has been hailed as a farsighted,  humanitarian measure, and it is quite true that many of the leading men,  in the South as well as in the North, were looking forward to the time  when slavery would be abolished. But the motives predominating at the  time were probably more nearly represented by Grayson, who wrote to  James Monroe, three weeks after the ordinance was passed: \"The clause  respecting slavery was agreed to by the southern members for the purpose  of preventing tobacco and indigo from being made on the northwest side  of the Ohio, as well as for several other political reasons.\"    It is over one hundred and forty years since the Ordinance of 1787 was  adopted, during which period more than thirty territories of the United  States have been organized, and there has never been a time when one or  more territories were not under Congressional supervision, so that the  process of legislative control has been continuous. Changes have been  made from time to time in order to adapt the territorial government to  changed conditions, but for fifty years the Ordinance of 1787 actually  remained in operation, and even twenty years later it was specifically  referred to by statute. The principles of territorial government today  are identical with those of 1787, and those principles comprise the  largest measure of local self-government compatible with national  control, a gradual extension of self-government to the people of a  territory, and finally complete statehood and admission into the Union  on a footing of equality with the other States.    In 1825, when the military occupation of Oregon was suggested in  Congress, Senator Dickerson of New Jersey objected, saying, \"We have not  adopted a system of colonization and it is to be hoped we never shall.\"  Yet that is just what America has always had. Not only were the first  settlers on the Atlantic coast colonists from Europe; but the men who  went to the frontier were also colonists from the Atlantic seaboard. And  the men who settled the States in the West were colonists from the older  communities. The Americans had so recently asserted their independence  that they regarded the name of colony as not merely indicating  dependence but as implying something of inferiority and even of  reproach. And when the American colonial system was being formulated in  1783-87 the word \"Colony\" was not used. The country under consideration  was the region west of the Alleghany Mountains and in particular the  territory north and west of the Ohio River and, being so referred to in  the documents, the word \"Territory\" became the term applied to all the  colonies.    The Northwest Territory increased so rapidly in population that in 1800  it was divided into two districts, and in 1802 the eastern part was  admitted into the Union as the State of Ohio. The rest of the territory  was divided in 1805 and again in 1809; Indiana was admitted as a State  in 1816 and Illinois in 1818. So the process has gone on. There were  thirteen original States and six more have become members of the Union  without having been through the status of territories, making nineteen  in all; while twenty-nine States have developed from the colonial  stage. The incorporation of the colonies into the Union is not merely a  political fact; the inhabitants of the colonies become an integral part  of the parent nation and in turn become the progenitors of new colonies.  If such a process be long continued, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3034"],[0,"The Anti-Slavery Crusade: A Chronicle of the Gathering Storm (#10)"],[1," Congress might authorize and enforce the  circulation of abolition literature through the mails in all the States.  The States should themselves severally decide what in their judgment is  incendiary, and then it would become the duty of the general Government  to give effect to such state laws. The bill recommended was in harmony  with this view. It was made illegal for any deputy postmaster \"to  deliver to any person whatsoever, any pamphlet, newspaper, handbill, or  other printed paper, or pictorial representation touching the subject  of slavery, where by the laws of the said State, territory, or district  their circulation is prohibited.\" The bill was defeated in the Senate by  a small margin. Altogether there was an enlightening debate on the whole  subject. The exposure of the abuse of tampering with the mail created a  general reaction, which enabled the abolitionists to win a spectacular  victory. Instead of a law forbidding the circulation of anti-slavery  publications, Congress enacted a law requiring postal officials under  heavy penalties to deliver without discrimination all matter committed  to their charge. This act was signed by President Jackson, and Calhoun  himself was induced to admit that the purposes of the abolitionists were  not violent and revolutionary. Henceforth abolitionists enjoyed their  full privileges in the use of the United States mail. An even more  dramatic victory was thrust upon the abolitionists by the inordinate  violence of their opponents in their attack upon the right of petition.  John Quincy Adams, who became their distinguished champion, was not  himself an abolitionist. When, as a member of the lower House of  Congress in 1831, he presented petitions from certain citizens of  Pennsylvania, presumably Quakers, requesting Congress to abolish  slavery and the slave-trade in the District of Columbia, he refused to  countenance their prayer, and expressed the wish that the memorial  might be referred without debate. At the very time when a New England  ex-President was thus advising abolitionists to desist from sending  petitions to Congress, the Virginia Legislature was engaged in the  memorable debate upon a similar petition from Virginia Quakers, in which  most radical abolition sentiment was expressed by actual slaveowners.  Adams continued to present anti-slavery memorials and at the same time  to express his opposition to the demands of the petitioners. When  in 1835 there arose a decided opposition to the reception of such  documents, Adams, still in apparent sympathy with the pro-slavery South  on the main issue, gave wise counsel on the method of dealing with  petitions. They should be received, said he, and referred to a  committee; because the right of petition is sacred. This, he maintained,  was the best way to avoid disturbing debate on the subject of slavery.  He quoted his own previous experience; he had made known his opposition  to the purposes of the petitioners; their memorials were duly referred  to a committee and there they slept the sleep of death. At that time  only one voice had been raised in the House in support of the abolition  petitioners, that of John Dickson of New York, who had delivered a  speech of two hours in length advocating their cause; but not a voice  was raised in reply. Mr. Adams mentioned this incident with approval.  The way to forestall disturbing debate in Congress, he said, was  scrupulously to concede all constitutional rights and then simply to  refrain from speaking on the subject.    This sound advice was not followed. For several months a considerable  part of the time of the House was occupied with the question of handling  abolition petitions. And finally, in May, 1836, the following resolution  passed the House: \"Resolved, That all petitions, memorials, resolutions,  propositions, or papers relating in any way or to any extent whatever to  the subject of slavery or the abolition of slavery, shall, without being  either printed or referred, be laid on the table, and that no further  action whatever shall be had thereon.\" This is commonly known as the  \"gag resolution.\" During four successive years it was reenacted in one  form or another and was not repealed by direct vote until 1844.    When the name of Mr. Adams was called in the vote upon the passage of  the above resolution, instead of answering in the ordinary way, he said:  \"I hold the resolution to be a direct violation of the Constitution of  the United States, of the rules of this House, and of the rights of my  constituents.\" This was the beginning of the duel between the \"old man  eloquent\" and a determined majority in the House of Representatives.  Adams developed undreamed-of resources as a debater and parliamentarian.  He made it his special business to break down the barrier against the  right of petition. Abolitionists cooperated with zeal in the effort.  Their champion was abundantly supplied with petitions. The gag  resolution was designed to prevent all debate on the subject of slavery.  Its effect in the hands of the shrewd parliamentarian was to foment  debate. On one occasion, with great apparent innocence, after presenting  the usual abolition petitions, Adams called the attention of the Speaker  to one which purported to be signed by twenty-two slaves and asked  whether such a petition should be presented to the House, since he was  himself in doubt as to the rules applicable in such a case. This led to  a furious outbreak in the House which lasted for three days. Adams was  threatened with censure at the bar of the House, with expulsion, with  the grand jury, with the penitentiary; and it is believed that only his  great age and national repute shielded him from personal violence. After  numerous passionate speeches had been delivered, Adams injected a few  important corrections into the debate. He reminded the House that he  had not presented a petition purporting to emanate from slaves; on the  contrary, he had expressly declined to present it until the Speaker  had decided whether a petition from slaves was covered by the rule.  Moreover, the petition was not against slavery but in favor of slavery.  He was then charged with the crime of trifling with the sensibilities  of the House; and finally the champion of the right of petition took  the floor in his own defense. His language cut to the quick. His  calumniators were made to feel the force of his biting sarcasm. They  were convicted of injustice, and all their resolutions of censure were  withdrawn. The victory was complete.    After the year 1838 John Quincy Adams had the effective support of  Joshua R. Giddings from the Western Reserve, Ohio--who also fought a  pitched battle of his own which illustrates another phase of the crusade  against liberty. The ship Creole had sailed from Baltimore to New  Orleans in 1841 with a cargo of slaves. The negroes mutinied on the high  seas, slew one man, gained possession of the vessel, sailed to Nassau,  and were there set free by the British Government. Prolonged diplomatic  negotiations followed in which our Government held that, as slaves were  property in the United States, they continued to be such on the high  seas. In the midst of the controversy, Giddings introduced a resolution  into the House, declaring that slavery, being an abridgment of liberty,  could exist only under local rules, and that on the high seas there can  be no slavery. For this act Giddings was arraigned and censured by  the House. He at once resigned, but was reelected with instructions to  continue the fight for freedom of debate in the House.    In the campaign against the rights of freemen mob violence was first  employed, but in the South the weapon of repressive legislation was  soon substituted, and this was powerfully supplemented by social and  religious ostracism. Except in a few districts in the border States,  these measures were successful. Public profession of abolitionism was  suppressed. The violence of the mob was of much longer duration in the  North and reached its height in the years 1834 and 1835. But Northern  mobs only quickened the zeal of the abolitionists and made converts to  their cause. The attempt to substitute repressive state legislation had  the same effect, and the use of church authority for making an end of  the agitation for human liberty was only temporarily influential.    As early as 1838 the Presbyterian Church was divided over questions of  doctrine into Old School and New School Presbyterians. This served to  forestall the impending division on the slavery question. The Old School  in the South became pro-slavery and the New School in the North became  anti-slavery. At the same time the Methodist Church of the entire  country was beset by a division on the main question. In 1844 Southern  Methodist Episcopalian conferences resolved upon separation and  committed themselves to the defense of slavery. The division in the  Methodist Church was completed in 1846. A corresponding division took  place in the Baptist Church in 1845. The controversy was dividing the  country into a free North and an enslaved South, and Southern white men  as well as negroes were threatened with subjection to the demands of the  dominant institution.        CHAPTER VI. THE SLAVERY ISSUE IN POLITICS    Some who opposed mob violence became active abolitionists; others were  led to defend the rights of abolitionists because to do otherwise would  encourage anarchy and general disorder. The same was true of those who  defended the right of petition and the free use of the mails and the  entire list of the fundamental rights of freemen which were threatened  by the crusade against abolitionists. Birney's contention that unless  the slave is freed no one can be free was thus vindicated: the issue  involved vastly more than the mere emancipation of slaves.    The attack made in defense of slavery upon the rights of freemen was  early recognized as"]]]
