Beowulf, in fact, became an ideal king, as he was  an ideal warrior and hero, and he closed his life by an ideal act of  self-sacrifice for the good of his people.      Beowulf and the Fire-Dragon    In the fiftieth year of Beowulf's reign a great terror fell upon the  land: terror of a monstrous fire-dragon, who flew forth by night from  his den in the rocks, lighting up the blackness with his blazing  breath, and burning houses and homesteads, men and cattle, with the  flames from his mouth. The glare from his fiery scales was like the  dawn-glow in the sky, but his passage left behind it every night a  trail of black, charred desolation to confront the rising sun. Yet the  dragon's wrath was in some way justified, since he had been robbed,  and could not trace the thief. Centuries before Beowulf's lifetime a  mighty family of heroes had gathered together, by feats of arms, and  by long inheritance, an immense treasure of cups and goblets, of  necklaces and rings, of swords and helmets and armour, cunningly  wrought by magic spells; they had joyed in their cherished hoard for  long years, until all had died but one, and he survived solitary,  miserable, brooding over the fate of the dearly loved treasure. At  last he caused his servants to make a strong fastness in the rocks,  with cunningly devised entrances, known only to himself, and thither,  with great toil and labour of aged limbs, he carried and hid the  precious treasure. As he sadly regarded it, and thought of its future  fate, he cried aloud:        \"Hold thou now fast, O earth,    now men no longer can,      The treasure of mighty earls.    From thee brave men won it      In days that are long gone by,    but slaughter seized on them,      Death fiercely vanquished them,    each of my warriors,      Each one of my people,    who closed their life-days here      After the joy of earth.    None have I sword to wield      Or bring me the goblet,    the richly wrought vessel.      All the true heroes have    elsewhere departed!      Now must the gilded helm    lose its adornments,      For those who polished it    sleep in the gloomy grave,      Those who made ready erst    war-gear of warriors.      Likewise the battle-sark    which in the fight endured      Bites of the keen-edged blades    midst the loud crash of shields      Rusts, with its wearer dead.    Nor may the woven mail      After the chieftain's death    wide with a champion rove.      Gone is the joy of harp,    gone is the music's mirth.      Now the hawk goodly-winged    hovers not through the hall,      Nor the swift-footed mare    tramples the castle court:      Baleful death far has sent    all living tribes of men.\"    When this solitary survivor of the ancient race died his hoard  remained alone, unknown, untouched, until at length the fiery dragon,  seeking a shelter among the rocks, found the hidden way to the cave,  and, creeping within, discovered the lofty inner chamber and the  wondrous hoard. For three hundred winters he brooded over it  unchallenged, and then one day a hunted fugitive, fleeing from the  fury of an avenging chieftain, in like manner found the cave, and the  dragon sleeping on his gold. Terrified almost to death, the fugitive  eagerly seized a marvellously wrought chalice and bore it stealthily  away, feeling sure that such an offering would appease his lord's  wrath and atone for his offence. But when the dragon awoke he  discovered that he had been robbed, and his keen scent assured him  that some one of mankind was the thief. As he could not at once see  the robber, he crept around the outside of the barrow snuffing eagerly  to find traces of the spoiler, but it was in vain; then, growing more  wrathful, he flew over the inhabited country, shedding fiery death  from his glowing scales and flaming breath, while no man dared to face  this flying horror of the night.    The news came to Beowulf that his folk were suffering and dying, and  that no warrior dared to risk his life in an effort to deliver the  land from this deadly devastation; and although he was now an aged man  he decided to attack the fire-drake. Beowulf knew that he would not be  able to come to hand-grips with this foe as he had done with Grendel  and his mother: the fiery breath of this dragon was far too deadly,  and he must trust to armour for protection. He commanded men to make  a shield entirely of iron, for he knew that the usual shield of  linden-wood would be instantly burnt up in the dragon's flaming  breath. He then chose with care eleven warriors, picked men of his own  bodyguard, to accompany him in this dangerous quest. They compelled  the unhappy fugitive whose theft had begun the trouble to act as their  guide, and thus they marched to the lonely spot where the dragon's  barrow stood close to the sea-shore. The guide went unwillingly, but  was forced thereto by his lord, because he alone knew the way.      Beowulf Faces Death    When the little party reached the place they halted for a time, and  Beowulf sat down meditating sadly on his past life, and on the chances  of this great conflict which he was about to begin. When he had  striven with Grendel, when he had fought against the Hetware, he had  been confident of victory and full of joyous self-reliance, but now  things were changed. Beowulf was an old man, and there hung over him a  sad foreboding that this would be his last fight, and that he would  rid the land of no more monsters. Wyrd seemed to threaten him, and a  sense of coming woe lay heavy on his heart as he spoke to his little  troop: \"Many great fights I had in my youth. How well I remember them  all! I was only seven years old when King Hrethel took me to bring up,  and loved me as dearly as his own sons, Herebeald, Hathcyn, or my own  dear lord Hygelac. Great was our grief when Hathcyn, hunting in the  forest, slew all unwittingly his elder brother: greater than ordinary  sorrow, because we could not avenge him on the murderer! It would have  given no joy to Hrethel to see his second son killed disgracefully as  a murderer! So we endured the pain till King Hrethel died, borne down  by his bitter loss, and I wept for my protector, my kinsman. Then  Hathcyn died also, slain by the Swedes, and my dear lord Hygelac came  to the throne: he was gracious to me, a giver of weapons, a generous  distributor of treasure, and I repaid him as much as I could in battle  against his foes. Daghrefn, the Frankish warrior who slew my king, I  sent to his doom with my deadly hand-grip: he, at least, should not  show my lord's armour as trophy of his prowess. But this fight is  different: here I must use both point and edge, as I was not wont in  my youth: but here too will I, old though I be, work deeds of valour.  I will not give way the space of one foot, but will meet him here in  his own abode and make all my boasting good. Abide ye here, ye  warriors, for this is not your expedition, nor the work of any man but  me alone; wait till ye know which is triumphant, for I will win the  gold and save my people, or death shall take me.\" So saying he raised  his great shield, and, unaccompanied, set his face to the dark  entrance, where a stream, boiling with strange heat, flowed forth from  the cave; so hot was the air that he stood, unable to advance far for  the suffocating steam and smoke. Angered by his impotence, Beowulf  raised his voice and shouted a furious defiance to the awesome  guardian of the barrow. Thus aroused, the dragon sprang up, roaring  hideously and flapping his glowing wings together; out from the  recesses of the barrow came his fiery breath, and then followed the  terrible beast himself. Coiling and writhing he came, with head  raised, and scales of burnished blue and green, glowing with inner  heat; from his nostrils rushed two streams of fiery breath, and his  flaming eyes shot flashes of consuming fire. He half flew, half sprang  at Beowulf. But the hero did not retreat one step. His bright sword  flashed in the air as he wounded the beast, but not mortally, striking  a mighty blow on his scaly head. The guardian of the hoard writhed and  was stunned for a moment, and then sprang at Beowulf, sending forth so  dense a cloud of flaming breath that the hero stood in a mist of fire.  So terrible was the heat that the iron shield glowed red-hot and the  ring-mail on the hero's limbs seared him as a furnace, and his breast  swelled with the keen pain: so terrible was the fiery cloud that the  Geats, seated some distance away, turned and fled, seeking the cool  shelter of the neighbouring woods, and left their heroic lord to  suffer and die alone.      Beowulf's Death    Among the cowardly Geats, however, there was one who thought it  shameful to flee--Wiglaf, the son of Weohstan. He was young, but a  brave warrior, to whom Beowulf had shown honour, and on whom he had  showered gifts, for he was a kinsman, and had proved himself worthy.  Now he showed that Beowulf's favour had been justified, for he seized  his shield, of yellow linden-wood, took his ancient sword in hand, and  prepared to rush to Beowulf's aid. With bitter words he reproached his  cowardly comrades, saying: \"I remember how we boasted, as we sat in  the mead hall and drank the foaming ale, as we took gladly the gold  and jewels which our king lavished upon us, that we would repay him  for all his gifts, if ever such need there were! Now is the need come  upon him, and we are here! Beowulf chose us from all his bodyguard to  help him in this mighty struggle, and we have betrayed and deserted  him, and left him alone against a terrible foe. Now the day has come  when our lord should see our valour, and we flee from his side! Up,  let us go and aid him, even while the grim battle-flame flares around  him. God knows that I would rather risk my body in the fiery cloud  than stay here while my king fights and dies! Not such disloyalty has  Beowulf deserved"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25550"],[0,"The Defiant Agents (#10)"],[1,"ble, a portion  of it fall away.    Travis sped on, his moccasins making no sound on the ground. One of the  coyotes gave tongue for the second time, the eerie wailing rising to a  yapping which echoed from the rocks about them. Travis poised for a  dive.    Another section of those artfully heaped branches had given way and a  horse reared, its upflung head plainly marked against the sky. A blurred  figure weaved back and forth before it, trying to control the mount. The  stranger had his hands full, certainly no weapon drawn--this was it!    Travis leaped. His hands found their mark, the shoulders of the  stranger. There was a shrill cry from the other as he tried to turn in  the Apache's hold, to face his attacker. But Travis bore them both on,  rolling almost under the feet of the horse, sliding downhill, the  unknown's writhing body pinned down by the Apache's weight and his  clasp, tight as an iron grip, about the other's chest and upper arms.    He felt his opponent go limp, but was suspicious enough not to release  that hold, for the heavy breathing of the stranger was not that of an  unconscious man. They lay so, the unknown still tight in Travis' hold  but no longer fighting. The Apache could hear Tsoay soothing the horse  with the purring words of a practiced horseman.    Still the stranger did not resume the struggle. They could not lie in  this position all night, Travis thought with a wry twist of amusement.  He shifted his hold, and got the lightning-quick response he had  expected. But it was not quite quick enough, for Travis had the other's  hands behind his back, cupping slender, almost delicate wrists together.    \"Throw me a cord!\" he called to Tsoay.    The younger man ran up with an extra bow cord, and in a moment they had  bonds on the struggling captive. Travis rolled their catch over,  reaching down for a fistful of hair to pull the head into a patch of  clearer light.    In his grasp that hair came loose, a braid unwinding. He grunted as he  looked down into the stranger's face. Dust marks were streaked now with  tear runnels, but the gray eyes which turned fiercely on him said that  their owner cried more in rage than fear.    His captive might be wearing long trousers tucked into curved, toed  boots, and a loose overblouse, but she was certainly not only a woman,  but a very young and attractive one. Also, at the present moment, an  exceedingly angry one. And behind that anger was fear, the fear of one  fighting hopelessly against insurmountable odds. But as she eyed Travis  now her expression changed.    He felt she had expected another captor altogether and was astounded at  the sight of him. Her tongue touched her lips, moistening them, and now  the fear in her was another kind--the wary fear of one facing a totally  new and perhaps dangerous thing.    \"Who are you?\" Travis spoke in English, for he had no doubts that she  was Terran.    Now she sucked in her breath with a gasp of pure astonishment.    \"Who are _you_?\" she parroted his question in a marked accent. English  was not her native tongue, he was sure.    Travis reached out, and again his hands closed on her shoulders. She  started to twist and then realized he was merely pulling her up to a  sitting position. Some of the fear had left her eyes, an intent interest  taking its place.    \"You are not Sons of the Blue Wolf,\" she stated in her heavily accented  speech.    Travis smiled. \"I am the Fox, not the Wolf,\" he returned. \"And the  Coyote is my brother.\" He snapped his fingers at the shadows, and the  two animals came noiselessly into sight. Her gaze widened even more at  Naginlta and Nalik'ideyu, and she deduced the bond which must exist  between her captor and the beasts.    \"This woman is also of our world.\" Tsoay spoke in Apache, looking over  their prisoner with frank interest. \"Only she is not of the People.\"    Sons of the Blue Wolf? Travis thought again of the embroidery designs on  the jacket. Who had called themselves by that picturesque  title--where--and when in time?    \"What do you fear, Daughter of the Blue Wolf?\" he asked.    And with that question he seemed to touch some button activating terror.  She flung back her head so that she could see the darkening sky.    \"The flyer!\" Her voice was muted as if more than a whisper would carry  to the stars just coming into brilliance above them. \"They will come ...  tracking. I did not reach the inner mountains in time.\"    There was a despairing note in that which cut through to Travis, who  found that he, too, was searching the sky, not knowing what he looked  for or what kind of menace it promised, only that it was real danger.          6      \"The night comes,\" Tsoay spoke slowly in English. \"Do these you fear  hunt in the dark?\"    She shook her head to free her forehead from a coil of braid, pulled  loose in her struggle with Travis.    \"They do not need eyes or such noses as those four-footed hunters of  yours. They have a machine to track--\"    \"Then what purpose is this brush pile of yours?\" Travis raised his chin  at the disturbed hiding place.    \"They do not constantly use the machine, and one can hope. But at night  they can ride on its beam. We are not far enough into the hills to lose  them. Bahatur went lame, and so I was slowed....\"    \"And what lies in these mountains that those you fear dare not invade  them?\" Travis continued.    \"I do not know, save if one can climb far enough inside, one is safe  from pursuit.\"    \"I ask it again: Who are you?\" The Apache leaned forward, his face in  the fast-fading light now only inches away from hers. She did not shrink  from his close scrutiny but met him eye to eye. This was a woman of  proud independence, truly a chief's daughter, Travis decided.    \"I am of the People of the Blue Wolf. We were brought across the star  lanes to make this world safe for ... for ... the....\" She hesitated,  and now there was a shade of puzzlement on her face. \"There is a  reason--a dream. No, there is the dream and there is reality. I am  Kaydessa of the Golden Horde, but sometimes I remember other  things--like this speech of strange words I am mouthing now----\"    \"The Golden Horde!\" Travis knew now. The embroidery, Sons of the Blue  Wolf, all fitted into a special pattern. But what a pattern! Scythian  art, the ornament that the warriors of Genghis Khan bore so proudly.  Tatars, Mongols--the barbarians who had swept from the fastness of the  steppes to change the course of history, not only in Asia but across the  plains of middle Europe. The men of the Emperor Khans who had ridden  behind the yak-tailed standards of Genghis Khan, Kublai Khan,  Tamerlane--!    \"The Golden Horde,\" Travis repeated once again. \"That lies far back in  the history of another world, Wolf Daughter.\"    She stared at him, a queer, lost expression on her dust-grimed face.    \"I know.\" Her voice was so muted he could hardly distinguish the words.  \"My people live in two times, and many do not realize that.\"    Tsoay had crouched down beside them to listen. Now he put out his hand,  touching Travis' shoulder.    \"Redax?\"    \"Or its like.\" For Travis was sure of one point. The project, which had  been training three teams for space colonization--one of Eskimos, one of  Pacific Islanders, and one of his own Apaches--had no reason or chance  to select Mongols from the wild past of the raiding Hordes. There was  only one nation on Terra which could have picked such colonists.    \"You are Russian.\" He studied her carefully, intent on noting the effect  of his words.    But she did not lose that lost look. \"Russian ... Russian ...\" she  repeated, as if the very word was strange.    Travis was alarmed. Any Russian colony planted here could well possess  technicians with machines capable of tracking a fugitive, and if  mountain heights were protection against such a hunt, he intended to  gain them, even by night traveling. He said this to Tsoay, and the other  emphatically agreed.    \"The horse is too lame to go on,\" the younger man reported.    Travis hesitated for a long second. Since the time they had stolen their  first mounts from the encroaching Spanish, horses had always been wealth  to his people. To leave an animal which could well serve the clan was  not right. But they dared not waste time with a lame beast.    \"Leave it here, free,\" he ordered.    \"And the woman?\"    \"She goes with us. We must learn all we can of these people and what  they do here. Listen, Wolf Daughter,\" again Travis leaned close to make  sure she was listening to him as he spoke with emphasis--\"you will  travel with us into these high places, and there will be no trouble from  you.\" He drew his knife and held the blade warningly before her eyes.    \"It was already in my mind to go to the mountains,\" she told him evenly.  \"Untie my hands, brave warrior, you have surely nothing to fear from a  woman.\"    His hand made a swift sweep and plucked a knife as long and keen as his  from the folds of the sash beneath her loose outer garment.    \"Not now, Wolf Daughter, since I have drawn your fangs.\"    He helped her to her feet and slashed the cord about her wrists with her  knife, which he then fastened to his own belt. Alerting the coyotes, he  dispatched them ahead; and the three started on, the Mongol girl between  the two Apaches. The abandoned horse nickered lonesomely and then began  to graze on tufts of grass, moving slowly to favor his foot.    The two moons rode the sky as the hours advanced, their beams fighting  the shadows. Travis felt reasonably safe from any attack at ground  level, depending upon the coyotes for warning. But he held them all to a  steady pace. And he did not question the girl again until all three of  them hunkered down at a small mountain spring, to dash icy water over  their faces and drink from cupped hands.    \"Why do you flee your own people, Wolf Daughter?\"    \"My name is Kaydessa,\" she corrected him.    He chuckled with laughter at the "]]]
