Except for these informal alliances obtaining between neighbouring  villages of the people of any one stock, each village forms an  independent community, ruled by its chief, making war and peace  and alliances, and selecting patches of land for cultivation at its  own pleasure. No village community remains on the same spot for any  long period; but after fifteen, ten, or even fewer years, a new site  is sought, often at a considerable distance, and a new village is  built. The principal reasons for this habit of frequent migration,  which has produced the intimate mingling throughout large areas of the  peoples of different stocks, are two: first, the necessity of finding  virgin soil for cultivation; secondly, the occurrence of epidemics  or other calamities; these lead them to believe that the place of  their abode supplies in insufficient degree the favouring spiritual  influences which they regard as essential to their welfare. For among  all these peoples animistic beliefs abound; they hold themselves to be  surrounded on every hand by spiritual forces both good and bad, some  of which are embodied in the wild creatures, especially the birds,  while some are manifested in such natural processes as the growth of  the corn, the rising of the river in flood, the rolling of thunder,  the incidence of disease. And they are constantly concerned to keep  at a distance, by the observance of many rigidly prescribed customs,  the evil influences, and, to a less degree, to secure by propitiatory  acts the protection and the friendly warnings of the beneficent powers.    One of the most peculiar features of the people of Borneo is the great  diversity of language obtaining among them. The migratory habits of  the people and the consequent mingling of communities of different  stocks within the same areas, far from having resulted in the genesis  by fusion of a common language, have resulted in the formation of  a great number of very distinct dialects; so that in following the  course of a river, one may sometimes find in a day's journey of a  score of miles half a dozen or more villages, the people of each of  which speak a dialect almost, or in some cases quite, unintelligible  to their neighbours. A necessary consequence of this state of affairs  is that, with the exception of the Sea Dayaks, almost all adults  speak or at least understand two or more dialects or languages,  while most of the chiefs and leading men speak several dialects  fluently and partially understand a larger number. The language most  widely understood by those to whom it is not native is the Kayan;  but since the recent spread of trade through large areas under the  protection of the European governments, a simplified form of the Malay  language has been rapidly establishing itself as the LINGUA FRANCA of  the whole country. In Sarawak, where, during the last fifty years,  the Sea Dayaks have spread from the Batang Lupar district and have  established villages on all the principal rivers, their language,  which seems to be a bastard and very simple branch of the Malay tongue,  is very widely understood and is largely used as a common medium.    Note on the use of the term KLEMANTAN. The Malay name for Borneo is  Pulu Klemantan, and we have adopted this name to denote the large  group of allied tribes which in our opinion have the best claim to  be regarded as representing the indigenous population of the island.        CHAPTER 4    Material Conditions of the Pagan Tribes of Borneo    With few exceptions, the main features of the dress, adornment,  and weapons of all the peoples are similar, showing only minor  differences from tribe to tribe and from place to place. The essential  and universal article of male attire is the waist-cloth, a strip of  cloth about one yard wide and four to eight yards in length (see  Frontispiece). Formerly this was made of bark-cloth; but now the  cotton-cloth obtained from the Chinese and Malay traders has largely  superseded the native bark-cloth, except in the remoter regions; and  here and there a well-to-do man may be seen wearing a cloth of more  expensive stuff, sometimes even of silk. One end of such a cloth is  passed between the legs from behind forwards, about eighteen inches  being left dependent; the rest of it is then passed several times round  the waist, over the end brought up on to the belly, and the other end  is tucked in at the back. The man wears in addition when out of doors  a coat of bark-cloth or white cotton stuff,[30] and a wide sun-hat  of palm leaves, in shape like a mushroom-top or an inverted and very  shallow basin, which shelters him from both sun and rain; many wear  also a small oblong mat plaited of rattan-strips hanging behind from  a cord passed round the waist, and serving as a seat when the wearer  sits down. At home the man wears nothing more than the waist-cloth,  save some narrow plaited bands of palm fibre below the knee, and, in  most cases, some adornment in the ears or about the neck and on the  arms.[31] The man's hair is allowed to grow long on the crown of the  scalp, and to hang freely over the back of the neck, in some cases  reaching as far as the middle of the back. This long hair is never  plaited, but is sometimes screwed up in a knot on the top of the head  and fastened with a skewer. The latter mode of wearing the hair is  the rule among the Muruts, who use elaborately carved and decorated  hairpins of bone (the shin bone of the deer, Fig. 1). That part of  the hair of the crown which naturally falls forwards is cut to form  a straight fringe across the forehead. All the rest of the head is  kept shaven, except at times of mourning for the death of relatives.    When in the house the man commonly wears on his head a band of plaited  rattan, which varies from a mere band around the brows to a completed  skull-cap. The free ends of the rattan strips are generally allowed to  project, forming a dependent tassel or fringe (Pl. 21). A well-to-do  Kayan man usually wears a necklace consisting of a single string of  beads, which in many cases are old and of considerable value (Pls. 19  and 28). Every Kayan has the shell of the ear perforated, and when  fully dressed wears, thrust forward through the hole in each shell,  the big upper canine tooth of the tiger-cat; but he is not entitled  to wear these until he has been on the warpath. Those who have taken  a head or otherwise distinguished themselves in war may wear, instead  of the teeth, pieces of similar shape carved from the solid beak of  the helmeted hornbill. The youths who have not qualified themselves  for these adornments, and warriors during mourning, usually wear a  disc of wood or wax in their places (Pls. 19 and 21).    The lobe of the ear is perforated and distended to a loop some two  inches in length, in which a brass ring is worn. Just above this loop  a small hole through the shell is usually made, and from this a small  skein of beads depends. Similar ear ornaments are worn by Kenyahs and  some of the Klemantans, but not by Muruts, and by few individuals  only among Punans and Sea Dayaks. Many of the latter wear a row of  small brass rings inserted round the margin of the shell of each ear  (Fig. 2).    Many of the men wear also bracelets of shell or hard wood.    Although the dress of the men is so uniform in essentials throughout  the country, it gives considerable scope for the display of personal  tastes, and the Sea Dayak especially delights in winding many yards  of brilliantly coloured cloth about his waist, in brilliant coats  and gorgeous turbans[32] and feathers, and other ornaments; by means  of these he manages to make himself appear as a very dressy person  in comparison with the sober Kayan and with most of the people of  the remoter inland regions, who have little but scanty strips of  bark-cloth about the loins.    The universal weapons of the country are sword and spear, and  no man travels far from home without these and his oblong wooden  shield. Some of the peoples are expert in the use of the blowpipe  and poisoned dart. The blow-pipe and the recently introduced firearms  are the only missile weapons; the bow is unknown save as a plaything  for children,[33] and possibly in a few localities in the extreme  north.[34]    The dress of the women is less uniform than that of the men. The Sea  Dayak woman (Pls. 29 and 30) wears a short skirt of cotton thread  woven in curious patterns of several colours, reaching from the waist  almost to the knee; a long-sleeved jacket of the same material, and a  corset consisting of many rings of rattan built up one above another  to enclose the body from breast to thigh. Each rattan ring is sheathed  in small rings of beaten brass. The corset is made to open partially  or completely down the front, but is often worn continuously for long  periods. She wears her hair tied in a knot at the back of her head.    The principal garment of the women of all the other peoples is a  skirt of bark or cotton cloth, which is tied by a string a little  below the level of the crest of the hip bone; it reaches almost to  the ankle, but is open at the left side along its whole depth. It is  thus a large apron rather than a skirt. When the woman is at work in  the house or elsewhere, she tucks up the apron by drawing the front  flap backwards between her legs, and tucking it tightly into the band  behind, thus reducing it to the proportions and appearance of a small  pair of bathing-drawers. Each woman possesses also a long-sleeved,  long-bodied jacket of white cotton similar to that worn by the men;  this coat is generally worn by both sexes when"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3310"],[0,"A Forgotten Empire (Vijayanagar): A Contribution to the History of India (#10)"],[1,"ons, and on May  21, A.D. 1378,[71] after a reign of only one month, the murderer  was himself assassinated while at prayer in the great mosque of the  capital. Meanwhile Bukka Raya overrun the Doab, advanced as far as  the river Krishna, and invested the fortress of Raichur.    Daud was succeeded by Ala-ud-din's youngest son Mahmud I,[72] Mujahid's  sister Ruh Parvar Agah having blinded Daud's son, then a boy of eight  years, in order to prevent dissension. Mahmud was apparently welcome  to all parties, for even the Raya raised the siege of Raichur and  agreed to pay him the tribute exacted by Muhammad Shah; so at least  says Firishtah. And during the whole of his reign of nearly twenty  years there was peace and tranquillity at home and abroad. He died  on the 20th April A.D. 1397.[73]    The decease of Bukka I. of Vijayanagar must apparently, for reasons  shown, be placed at about A.D. 1379.        CHAPTER 4    Growth of the Empire (A.D. 1379 to 1406)    Harihara II. -- Firuz Shah of Kulbarga -- Fresh wars -- Assassination  of a prince in 1399 A.D. -- Bukka II.    Bukka I. was succeeded by Harihara II., his son by his wife  Gauri. Nuniz calls the new king \"Pureoyre Deorao,\" and \"Pureoyre\"  seems to be a rough Portuguese version of the name Harihara;  H and P representing the same sound in the Kanarese and Telugu  languages. According to the inscriptions,[74] Harihara II. reigned  at least twenty years, and he was the first king who gave himself  imperial titles under the style of MAHARAJADHIRAJA. He gave many  grants to the temples, and consolidated the supremacy of his dynasty  over all Southern India. Sayana, brother of Madhavacharya, appears  to have been his chief minister, as he was to King Samgama II.[75]  Mudda is mentioned in two inscriptions of A.D. 1379 and 1382 as the  king's general. Another of his generals was called Iruga. He was  son of Chaicha, minister of Bukka II. His name appears on a pillar  in a Jain temple near Kamalapura at Vijayanagar in an inscription  bearing date A.D. 1385; which proves that the king was tolerant in  religious matters. There seems also to have been a general named  Gunda living in his reign, but his date is uncertain.[76] According  to another inscription,[77] King Harihara early in his reign expelled  the Muhammadans from Goa; and the last inscription of his reign at  present discovered[78] mentions that one Bachanna Udaiyar was then  governor of that place.    The king's wife, or one of his principal wives, was Malladevi, or  Mallambika. The extent of his domination is shown by the fact that  inscriptions of his reign are found in Mysore, Dharwar, Conjeeveram,  Chingleput, and Trichinopoly.[79] He was a worshipper of Siva under  the form Virupaksha, but appears to have been singularly tolerant  of other religions. The latest actual date of the reign afforded by  inscriptions is October 15, A.D. 1399.[80]    Ghias-ud-din, a boy of seventeen, eldest son of the late Sultan Mahmud,  had succeeded his father on the throne of Kulbarga; but on June 14,  1397,[81] he was treacherously blinded during an entertainment by an  ambitious slave, after a reign of only one month and twenty days. His  younger brother, Shams-ud-din, was then placed on the throne, but after  a reign of five months was blinded and deposed by his cousin Firuz,  second son of the late Sultan Daud. Firuz was by birth undoubtedly of  the elder branch, and he became one of the most celebrated monarchs  of his line, ascending the throne on November 15, A.D. 1397.[82] He  must have then been well advanced in years, as Firishtah says he was  \"old\" in A.D. 1419.    The date of the last inscription of Harihara II. as yet brought to  light is, as before stated, October 15, A.D. 1399. There are two  inscriptions extant of Bukka II., his eldest son, both dated in  A.D. 1406,[83] and several of the latter's successor, the younger  brother of Bukka II., whose name was Devaraya I., and whose reign  lasted till at least A.D. 1412.    It will be remembered that the first king of Vijayanagar, Harihara I.,  was an old man (Nuniz says \"very old\"), and reigned seven years. His  successor, Bukka, his brother, reigned thirty-seven years according to  Nuniz, and perhaps, therefore, it would be best not to assume too great  an age for Harihara I. However this may be, it would appear that when  the peaceful monarch Harihara II., son of Bukka I., came to the throne,  his father must have died at a very advanced age, and he himself  must have been by no means young. He reigned at least twenty years,  as before stated, and we are therefore justified in assuming that at  the close of his reign (in A.D. 1399) he was quite an old man. With  this in our minds, let us turn to Firishtah's narrative of the reign of  Firuz Shah Bahmani, beginning with his accession in November A.D. 1397.    He tells us that in the Hijra year 801 (13th September 1398 to 3rd  September 1399), month not given --    \"Dewal Roy of Beejanuggur, with thirty thousand horse and a vast  army of foot, invaded the royal territories between the rivers,  with a design to reduce the forts of Mudkul and Roijore\" (Raichur).    And in a later passage we are told that the campaign was at an end  a few months before the end of Hijra 801; I.E. a few months before  the end of August A.D. 1399. The first movement of the Hindu army  must therefore have taken place at the beginning of the cold season  of A.D. 1398, probably not earlier than December in that year, when  the great cotton plains across which the troops had to march were  passable. It can hardly be supposed that King Harihara II., then  quite old and always a lover of peace, would without motive have  waged this sudden war and himself led his armies into the field,  and it seems more likely that the invasion was a bold dash made by  his son with the king's permission. The Muhammadan historians admit  an unbroken peace of twenty years previous to this date.    It seems, therefore, that the chronicles of Nuniz, the writings of  Firishtah, and the extant inscriptions all agree together, and that  we must place the death of Harihara II. at the close of the year  A.D. 1399. Little more can be said about the events of his reign.    The new king, his eldest son, Bukka II., must have been a man of  middle age, as he had a son old enough to take the field with him  before he himself came to the throne.    \"This king ('Pureoyre'),\" says Nuniz, \"had a son, who by his  death inherited the kingdom, who was called Ajarao; and he reigned  forty-three years, in which time he was always at war with the Moors.\"    I can give no explanation as to why Nuniz calls the successor of  Harihara II \"Ajarao,\" nor as to his estimate of forty-three years  for his reign. The names and lengths of reigns given to \"Ajarao's\"  successors by our chronicler prove that by \"Ajarao\" he means two kings,  Bukka II. and his successor, Deva Raya I.; and the period covered by  their combined reigns was only fourteen years, not forty-three.    Nuniz states that the successor of Harihara II. greatly improved the  city of Vijayanagar, raising fresh walls and towers, increasing its  extent, and building further lines of fortification. But his great  work was the construction of a huge dam in the Tungabhadra river,  and the formation of an aqueduct fifteen miles long from the river  into the city. If this be the same channel that to the present day  supplies the fields which occupy so much of the site of the old city,  it is a most extraordinary work. For several miles this channel is  cut out of the solid rock at the base of the hills, and is one of the  most remarkable irrigation works to be seen in India. No details are  given of the wars he engaged in, except that, besides his campaigns  against the Moors, he took \"Goa, Chaul, and Dabull,\" and reduced the  Choromandel side of the peninsula to loyalty and obedience to his rule.    We learn a great deal more about the doings of Bukka II. and Deva  Raya I. from Firishtah than from Nuniz, and I make no apology for  quoting copiously from the former author, whose writings throw much  light on the period.    Bukka's first war began with the invasion already alluded to. It took  place during his father Harihara's reign, apparently about the month  of December A.D. 1398 (rather later than earlier). The wide cotton  plains of that tract are only passable during prolonged dry weather,  and the prince would certainly not have risked an advance while there  was any likelihood of rain falling. Bukka's son accompanied his father,  and the objective was the country of the Doab, and particularly the  fortresses of Mudkal and Raichur, then in the hands of the Bahmani  Sultan. Sultan Firuz moved to meet him, slaughtering on the way a  Hindu chief or zamindar and seven or eight thousand of his followers,  \"who had always been very troublesome and refractory.\" The Raya  had advanced to the northern frontier of the debatable land and was  encamped on the river Krishna, then in full flood, having large bodies  of troops posted to oppose the passage of the Muhammadans.    \"Sultan Feroze Shaw,[84] on his arrival near the river, held a council  of war with his chief officers, but received no advice that to him  appeared satisfactory.    \"While the sultan was debating in his own mind how to act, Cauzi  Serauje, seeing his concern, offered, if the sultan would permit him,  to cross the river with a few of his friends, whom he would select  for that purpose, to assassinate Dewal Roy or his son, as he found  most convenient....    \"The sultan approving the measure, some hundreds of hurdles covered  with leather[85] were prepared expeditiously for the troops to  cross. Cauzi Serauje, with seven of his friends disguised as holy  mendicants, proceeded to the roy's camp, and repaired to the quarter  where the dancing-girls resided.[86] Here the cauzi pretended to be  enraptured with a courtesan, and was guilty of a thousand extravagances  "]]]
