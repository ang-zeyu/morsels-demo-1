The thermal-junction measurements are made by a semicircular switch  S_{7}. The various points, I, II, III, IV, etc., are connected with the  different thermal-junction systems. Thus, by following the wiring  diagram, it can be seen that the connections with I run to the different  binding-posts of the switch S_{10}, which as a matter of fact is placed  beneath the table. This switch S_{10} has three rows of binding-posts.  The center row connects directly with the apparatus on the observer's  table, the outer rows connect with either the chair calorimeter or the  bed calorimeter. The points marked _a_, _b_, _d_, _e_, _f_, etc.,  connect with the bed calorimeter and A, B, D, etc., connect with the  chair calorimeter. Thus, by connecting the points _g_ and _i_ with the  two binding-posts opposite them on the switch S_{10}, it can be seen  that this connection leads directly to the point I on the switch S_{7},  and as a matter of fact this gives direct connection with the  galvanometer through the key on S_{7}, thus connecting the  thermal-junction system on one section of the bed calorimeter between  _g_ and _i_ directly with the galvanometer. Similar connections from the  other points can readily be followed from the diagram. The points on the  switch S_{7} indicated as I, II, III, IV, correspond respectively to the  thermal-junction systems on the top, rear, front, and bottom of the  chair calorimeter.    By following the wiring diagram of the point V, it will be seen that  this will include the connections with the thermal junctions connected  in series and thus give a sum total of the electromotive forces in the  thermal junctions. The point VI is connected with the thermal-junction  system in the air system, indicating the differences in temperature  between the ingoing and outgoing air. It will be noted that there are  four sections in the chair calorimeter, while in the bed calorimeter  there are but three, and hence a special switch S_{3} is installed to  insure proper connections when the bed calorimeter is in use.    This system of connecting the thermal junctions in different sections to  the galvanometer makes possible a more accurate control of the  temperatures in the various parts, and while the algebraic sum of the  temperature differences of the parts may equal zero, it is conceivable  that there may be a condition in the calorimeter when there is a  considerable amount of heat passing out through the top, for example,  compensated exactly by the heat which passes in at the bottom, and while  with the top section there would be a large plus deflection on the  galvanometer, thus indicating that the air around the zinc wall was too  cold and that heat was passing out, there would be a corresponding minus  deflection on the bottom section, indicating the reverse conditions. The  two may exactly balance each other, but it has been found advantageous  to consider each section as a unit by itself and to attempt delicate  temperature control of each individual unit. This has been made possible  by the electrical connections, as shown on the diagram.      RHEOSTAT FOR HEATING.    The rheostat for heating the air-spaces and the returning air-current  about the zinc wall is placed on the observer's table and is indicated  in the diagram as R_{2}. There are five different sets of  contact-points, marked 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. One end of the rheostat is  connected directly with the 110-volt circuit through the main switch  S_{5}. The other side of the switch S_{5} connects directly with the  point on the middle of switch S_{10}, and when this middle point is  joined with either _f_ and F, direct connection is insured between all  the various heating-circuits on the calorimeter in use. The various  numbered points on the rheostat R_{2}, are connected with the binding  posts on S_{10}, and each can in turn be connected with _a_ or A, _b_ or  B, etc. The heating of the top of the chair calorimeter is controlled by  the point 5 on the rheostat R_{2}, the rear by the point 4, the front by  the point 3, and the bottom by the point 2. Point 1 is used for heating  the air entering the calorimeter by means of an electric lamp placed in  the air-pipe, as shown in fig. 25.    The warming of the electrical reheater placed in the water-circuit just  before the water enters the calorimeter is done by an electrical current  controlled by the resistance R_{1}. This R_{1} is connected on one end  directly with the 110-volt circuit and the current leaving it passes  through the resistance inside the heater in the water-current. The two  heaters, one for each calorimeter, are indicated on the diagram above  and below the switch S_{9}. The disposition of the switches is such as  to make it possible to use alternately the reheaters on either the bed  or the chair calorimeter, and the main resistance R_{1} suffices for  both.      WHEATSTONE BRIDGES.    For use in measuring the temperature of the air and of the copper wall  of the calorimeters, as well as the rectal temperature of the subject, a  series of resistance thermometers is employed. These are so connected  on the observer's table that they may be brought into connection with  two Wheatstone bridges, W_{1} and W_{2}. Bridge W_{1} is used for the  resistance thermometers indicating the temperature of the wall and the  air. Bridge W_{2} is for the rectal thermometer. Since similar  thermometers are inserted in both calorimeters, it is necessary to  introduce some switch to connect either set at will and hence the  double-throw switches S_{1}, S_{2}, and S_{3} allow the use of either  the wall, air, or rectal thermometer on either the bed or chair  calorimeter at will. Since the bridge W_{1} is used for measuring the  temperature of both the wall and the air, a fourth double-pole switch,  S_{4}, is used to connect the air and wall thermometers alternately. The  double-contact key, K_{1}, is connected with the bridge W_{1} and is so  arranged that the battery circuit is first made and subsequently the  galvanometer circuit. A similar arrangement in K_{2} controls the  connections for the bridge W_{2}.      GALVANOMETER.    The galvanometer is of the Deprez-d'Arsonval type and is extremely  sensitive. The sensitiveness is so great that it is desirable to  introduce a resistance of some 500 ohms into the thermal-junction  circuits. This is indicated at the top of the diagram near the  galvanometer. The maximum sensitiveness of the galvanometer is retained  when the connection is made with the Wheatstone bridges. The  galvanometer is suspended from the ceiling of the calorimeter laboratory  and is free from vibration.      RESISTANCE FOR HEATING COILS.    To vary the current passing through the manganin heating coils in the  air-spaces next the zinc wall, a series of resistances is installed  connected directly with the rheostat R_{2} in fig. 17. The details of  these resistances and their connection with the rheostat are shown in  fig. 18. The rheostat, which is in the right part of the figure, has  five sliding contacts, each of which can be connected with ten different  points. One end of the rheostat is connected directly with the 110-volt  circuit. Beneath the observer's table are fastened the five resistances,  which consist of four lamps, each having approximately 200 ohms  resistance and then a series of resistance-coils wound on a long strip  of asbestos lumber, each section having approximately 15 ohms between  the binding-posts. A fuse-wire is inserted in each circuit to protect  the chamber from excessive current. Of these resistances, No. 1 is used  to heat the lamp in the air-current shown in fig. 25, and consequently  it has been found advisable to place permanently a second lamp in series  with the first, but outside of the air-pipe, so as to avoid burning out  the lamp inside of the air-pipe. The other four resistances, 2, 3, 4,  and 5, are connected with the different sections on the two  calorimeters. No. 5 corresponds to the top of both calorimeters. No. 4  corresponds to the rear section of the chair calorimeter and to the  sides of the bed calorimeter. No. 3 corresponds to the front of the  chair calorimeter and is without communication with the bed calorimeter.  No. 2 connects with the bottom of both calorimeters.    It will be seen from the diagrams that each of these resistances can be  connected at will with either the bed or the chair calorimeter and at  such points as are indicated by the lettering below the numbers. Thus,  section 1 can be connected with either the point A or point _a_ on fig.  17 and thus directly control the amount of current passing through the  corresponding resistance in series with the lamp in the air-current. The  sliding contacts at present in use are ill adapted to long-continued  usage and will therefore shortly be substituted by a more substantial  instrument. The form of resistance using small lamps and the resistance  wires wound on asbestos lumber has proven very satisfactory and very  compact in form.    [Illustration: FIG. 18.--Diagram of rheostat and resistances in series  with it. At the right are shown the sliding contacts, and in the center  places for lamps used as resistances, and to left the sections of wire  resistances.]      TEMPERATURE RECORDER.    The numerous electrical, thermometric, and chemical measurements  necessary in the full conduct of an experiment with the respiration  calorimeter has often raised the question of the desirability of making  at least a portion of these observations more or less automatic. This  seems particularly feasible with the observations ordinarily recorded by  the physical observer.
