SEEKING INDIVIDUAL EXPRESSION    \"At the time of which I speak, my greatest difficulty was naturally to  give a constant and definite direction to my work and in my efforts to  obtain a suitable muscular training which should enable me to produce  expressive sounds, while I neglected no opportunity of closely observing  the work of pianoforte teachers and students around me. I found that  most of the technical work which was being done with infinite pains and  a vast expenditure of time was not only non-productive of expressive  sounds, but actually harmful and misleading as regards the development  of the musical sense. I could see no object in practicing evenness in  scales, considering that a perfectly even scale is essentially devoid of  emotional (musical) significance. I could see no reason for limiting  tone production to a certain kind of sound that was called 'a good  tone,' since the expression of feeling necessarily demands in many cases  the use of relatively harsh sounds. Moreover, I could see no reason for  trying to overcome what are generally called natural defects, such as  the comparative weakness of the fourth finger for example, as it seemed  to me rather a good thing than otherwise that each finger should  naturally and normally possess a characteristic motion of its own.    \"It is _differences_ that count in art, not similarities. Every  individual expression is a form of art; why not, then, make an artist of  each finger by cultivating its special aptitudes instead of adapting a  system of training deliberately calculated to destroy these individual  characteristics in bringing _all_ the fingers to a common level of  lifeless machines?    \"These and similar reflections, I discovered, were carrying me  continually farther away from the ideals of most of the pianists,  students and teachers with whom I was in contact, and it was not long  before I definitely abandoned all hope of obtaining, by any of the means  I found in use, the results for which I was striving. Consequently,  from that time to the present my work has necessarily been more or less  independent and empirical in its nature, and, while I trust I am neither  prejudiced nor intolerant in my attitude towards pianoforte education in  its general aspect, I cannot help feeling that a great deal of natural  taste is stifled and a great deal of mediocrity created by the  persistent and unintelligent study of such things as an 'even scale' or  a 'good tone.'    \"Lastly, it is quite incomprehensible to me why any one method of  technic should be superior to any other, considering that as far as I  was able to judge, no teacher or pupil ever claimed more for any  technical system than that it gave more technical ability than some  other technical system. I have never been able to convince myself, as a  matter of fact, that one system does give more ability than another; but  even if there were one infinitely superior to all the rest, it would  still fail to satisfy me unless its whole aim and object were to  facilitate musical expression.    \"Naturally, studying in this way required my powers of concentration to  be trained to the very highest point. This matter of concentration is  far more important than most teachers imagine, and the perusal of some  standard work on psychology will reveal things which should help the  student greatly. Many pupils make the mistake of thinking that only a  certain kind of music demands concentration, whereas it is quite as  necessary to concentrate the mind upon the playing of a simple scale as  for the study of a Beethoven sonata.      THE RESISTANCE OF THE MEDIUM    \"In every form of art the medium that is employed offers a certain  resistance to perfect freedom of expression, and the nature of this  resistance must be fully understood before it can be overcome. The poet,  the painter, the sculptor and the musician each has his own problem to  solve, and the pianist in particular is frequently brought to the verge  of despair through the fact that the instrument, in requiring the  expenditure of physical and nervous energy, absorbs, so to speak, a  large proportion of the intensity which the music demands.    \"With many students the piano is only a barrier--a wall between them and  music. Their thoughts never seem to penetrate farther than the keys.  They plod along for years apparently striving to make piano-playing  machines of themselves, and in the end result in becoming something  rather inferior.    \"Conditions are doubtless better now than in former years. Teachers give  studies with some musical value, and the months, even years, of keyboard  grind without the least suggestion of anything musical or gratifying to  the natural sense of the beautiful are very probably a thing of the  past. But here again I fear the teachers in many cases make a perverted  use of studies and pieces for technical purposes. If we practice a piece  of real music with no other idea than that of developing some technical  point it often ceases to become a piece of music and results in being a  kind of technical machinery. Once a piece is mechanical it is difficult  to make it otherwise. All the cogs, wheels, bolts and screws which an  overzealous ambition to become perfect technically has built up are made  so evident that only the most patient and enduring kind of an audience  can tolerate them.      THE PERVERSION OF STUDIES    \"People talk about 'using the music of Bach' to accomplish some  technical purpose in a perfectly heart-breaking manner. They never seem  to think of interpreting Bach, but, rather, make of him a kind of  technical elevator by means of which they hope to reach some marvelous  musical heights. We even hear of the studies of Chopin being perverted  in a similarly vicious manner, but Bach, the master of masters, is the  greatest sufferer.    \"It has become a truism to say that technic is only a means to an end,  but I very much doubt if this assertion should be accepted without  question, suggesting as it does the advisability of studying something  that is not music and which is believed at some future time to be  capable of being marvelously transformed into an artistic expression.  Properly understood, _technic is art_, and must be studied as such.  There should be no technic in music which is not music _in itself_.      THE UNIT OF MUSICAL EXPRESSION    \"The piano is, of all instruments, the least expressive naturally, and  it is of the greatest importance that the student should realize the  nature of its resistance. The action of a piano is purely a piece of  machinery where the individual note has no meaning. When the key is once  struck and the note sounded there is a completed action and the note  cannot then be modified nor changed in the least. The only thing over  which the pianist has any control is the length of the tone, and this  again may not last any longer than the natural vibrations of the  strings, although it may be shortened by relinquishing the keys. It  makes no difference whether the individual note is struck by a child or  by Paderewski--it has in itself no expressive value. In the case of the  violin, the voice and all other instruments except the organ, the  individual note may be modified after it is emitted or struck, and in  this modification is contained the possibility of a whole world of  emotional expression.    \"Our sole means of expression, then, in piano playing lies in the  relation of one note to the other notes in a series or in a chord.  Herein lies the difficulty, the resistance to perfect freedom of which I  have spoken before, the principal subject for intelligence and careful  study, and yet so few students appear to understand it. Their great  effort seems to be to make all the noise in a given series as much alike  as coins from a mint. They come to the piano as their only instrument,  and never seek to take a lesson from the voice or from the other  instruments which have expressive resources infinitely superior to those  possessed by the piano. The principal charm of the piano lies in the  command which the player has over many voices singing together. But  until the pianist has a regard for the individual voice in its relation  to the ensemble he has no means with which to make his work really  beautiful.    \"There is a great need for more breadth in music study. This, as I know,  has been said very often, but it does not hurt to say it again. The more  a man knows, the more he has experienced, the wider his mental vision in  all branches of human information, the more he will have to say. We need  men in music with big minds, wide grasp and definite aims. Musicians are  far too prone to become overspecialized. They seem to have an  unquenchable thirst to master the jargon and the infinite variety of  methods which are thrust upon us in these days rather than a genuine  desire to develop their musical aims. Music is acquiring a technology as  confusing and as extensive as bacteriology. There seems to be no end to  the new kinds of methods in the minds of furtive and fertile inventors.  Each new method in turn seems to breed another, and so on _ad nauseam_.    \"Among other things I would suggest the advisability for pianists to  cultivate some knowledge of the construction of their instrument.  Strange as it may seem, it is nevertheless a fact that the average  pianist knows practically nothing of a piano, being in many cases  entirely unaware of such simple things as how the tone is produced. The  function of the pedals is as unknown to them as geology is to the coal  heaver. This ignorance leads frequently to the employment of motions and  methods that can only be characterized as ridiculous in the extreme.

C., _March 11, 1865._         _To the Commissioner of the Freedman's Bureau_:         SIR:--I take pleasure in giving my influence to this application       for a place at the head of freedmen's affairs in the District of       Columbia for Mrs. Josephine S. Griffing, believing her to be       eminently qualified to develop the resources of the freed people       in this District, most of whom are women and children--secure the       national interest, and give satisfaction to the country. Mrs.       Griffing has given successful public and private efforts in       behalf of the colored race for many years, and has devoted the       entire time of the last year to an investigation of the condition       and best method of giving relief to the multitudes of freed       people in and around the National Capital. Finding many thousands       of women with families without employment or the means of       self-support, she has conferred with the President and Governors       of the Northwestern States upon the practicability of encouraging       their emigration. To meet the destitution of these people in this       city during the past winter, Mrs. Griffing has disbursed from the       Government about $25,000 in wood and blankets and rations, and       $5,000 in clothing and money from the public charity. I believe       the appointment of Mrs. J. S. Griffing to a chief clerkship or       general agency for the District in this Bureau will be creditable       to the Government and satisfactory to the freed people.                                                 Z. CHANDLER.           I fully concur with my colleague. Mrs. Griffing is both worthy       and capable, and I trust her services will be secured.                                                 J. M. HOWARD.           If I had this appointment to make, I would make Mrs. Griffing       Commissioner.                                                 J. M. ASHLEY.           I know Mrs. Griffing to be capable and humane, and very devoted       to the colored race. I hope that her services may be secured.

She is the       best qualified of any person within my knowledge; her whole heart       is in the work.                                                 B. F.

I fully concur in all that is said within in behalf of Mrs.       Griffing, and earnestly commend her to the favor sought.                                                 GEO. W. JULIAN.                                         WASHINGTON, _July 9, 1869_.         Mrs. Griffing has for several years devoted herself with great       industry, intelligence, and success to the freed people in the       District of Columbia, and in this service she has accomplished       more good than any other one individual within my acquaintance.       When the War Department was in my charge, she rendered very       efficient aid of a humane character to relieve the wants and       sufferings of destitute freed people, and was untiring in her       benevolent exertions. Property for distribution was often placed       in her hands, or under her directions, and she was uniformly       trustworthy and skillful in its management and administration. In       my judgment, she is entitled to the most full confidence and       trust.                                                 EDWIN M. STANTON.                                         JEFFERSON, OHIO, _Nov. 12, 1869_.         MY DEAR MRS. GRIFFING:--On my return from Washington I found your       kind letter of the 28th, ult. I regret much that I did not meet       with you at Washington. I know your merits. I know that no person       in America has done so much for the cause of humanity for the       last four years as you have. Your disinterested labors have saved       hundreds of poor human beings not only the greatest destitution       and misery, but from actual starvation and death. I also know       that in doing this you have not only devoted your whole time, but       all the property you have. And I know, too, that your labors are       just as necessary now as they ever have been. Others know all       this as well as I do. Secretary Stanton can vouch for it all, and       I can not doubt that Congress will not only pay you for what you       have done, but give you a position where this necessary work may       be done by you effectually. This is the very thing that ought to       be done at once. Since the Bureau has been abolished it will be       impossible to get along with the great influx of imbecility and       destitution which gathers and centers in Washington every       winter, without some one being appointed to see to it, and       certainly everybody knows that there is no one so competent for       this work as yourself. To this end I will do whatever I can, but       you know that I am now out of place, and have no influence at       Court, but whatever I can do to effect so desirable an object       will be done.                                                 Truly yours,  B. F. WADE.                                         SENATE CHAMBER, _April 2_.         DEAR MADAM:--I have your note of the 31st, and am very sorry to       hear that there is so much distress in the city. I shall endeavor       to bring the charter up as soon as I have an opportunity; but       while this trial is pending,[30] it is improbable that any       legislative business will be done. I am as anxious as you are to       secure its adoption.                                            Yours truly,    CHARLES SUMNER.         MRS. J. S. GRIFFING, Washington.                                         BOSTON, _27th July, 1869_.         DEAR MADAM:--The statement or memorial which you placed in my       hands was never printed. It is, probably, now on the files of the       Senate. I wish I could help your effort with the Secretary of       War. You must persevere. If Gen. Rawlins understands the case, he       will do all that you desire. Accept my best wishes, and believe       me, faithfully yours,                                                 CHARLES SUMNER.           Will Mrs. Griffing let Mr. Sumner know what institution or person       should disburse the money appropriated?         SENATE CHAMBER,                   Tuesday.           LETTERS ON THE FREEDMAN'S RELIEF ASSOCIATION.                                       WASHINGTON, _April 8, '71_.         _To the Mayor and Board of Common Council, City of Washington,       District of Columbia_:         MESSRS.:--I have the honor to state that the aged, sick,       crippled, and blind persons, for whom the National Freedman's       Relief Association of this District partially provides, are at       this time in very great destitution, many of them in extreme       suffering for want of food and fuel. The Association has provided       clothing. It is now twelve weeks since the Government       appropriation for their temporary support for the last year was       exhausted. This Association has by soliciting contributions, up       to this time, relieved the most extreme cases, that otherwise       must have died; but the want of food is so great among at least a       thousand of these, not one of whom is able _to labor_ for a       support, that it is impossible to provide the absolute relief       they must have, by further contributions from the charitable and       the humane.         I would therefore most earnestly appeal in their behalf, that the       Hon. Council and Mayor will appropriate from the market fund for       their temporary relief one thousand dollars, to be disbursed by       the above-named association, which sum will enable these       destitute persons to subsist until, as is hoped and believed,       Congress will make the usual special appropriation for their       partial temporary support. This Association to report the use of       such money to the Mayor and Common Council of the City of       Washington, D. C.              Very respectfully,                      J. S. GRIFFING,                             _General Agent N. F. R. Association, D. C._                               TRIBUNE OFFICE, NEW YORK, _Sept. 7, 1870_.         MRS. GRIFFING:--In my judgment you and others who wish to       befriend the blacks crowded into Washington, do them great       injury. Had they been told years ago, \"You _must_ find work; go       out and seek it,\" they would have been spared much misery. They       are an easy, worthless race, taking no thought for the morrow,       and liking to lean on those who befriend them. Your course       aggravates their weaknesses, when you should raise their ambition       and stimulate them to self-reliance. Unless you change your       course speedily and signally, the swarming of blacks to the       District will increase, and the argument that Slavery is their       natural condition will be immeasurably strengthened. So long as       they look to others to calculate and provide for them, they are       not truly free.
