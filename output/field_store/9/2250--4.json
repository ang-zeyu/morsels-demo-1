It was a sad blow to me, and the kind womanly letter that  Mrs. Lincoln wrote to me when she heard of my bereavement was full of  golden words of comfort.    Nathaniel Parker Willis, the genial poet, now sleeping in his grave,  wrote this beautiful sketch of Willie Lincoln, after the sad death of  the bright-eyed boy:    \"This little fellow had his acquaintances among his father's friends,  and I chanced to be one of them. He never failed to seek me out in the  crowd, shake hands, and make some pleasant remark; and this, in a boy of  ten years of age, was, to say the least, endearing to a stranger. But he  had more than mere affectionateness. His self-possession--_aplomb_, as  the French call it--was extraordinary. I was one day passing the White  House, when he was outside with a play-fellow on the side-walk. Mr.  Seward drove in, with Prince Napoleon and two of his suite in the  carriage; and, in a mock-heroic way--terms of intimacy evidently  existing between the boy and the Secretary--the official gentleman took  off his hat, and the Napoleon did the same, all making the young Prince  President a ceremonious salute. Not a bit staggered with the homage,  Willie drew himself up to his full height, took off his little cap with  graceful self-possession, and bowed down formally to the ground, like a  little ambassador. They drove past, and he went on unconcernedly with  his play: the impromptu readiness and good judgment being clearly a  part of his nature. His genial and open expression of countenance was  none the less ingenuous and fearless for a certain tincture of fun; and  it was in this mingling of qualities that he so faithfully resembled his  father.    \"With all the splendor that was around this little fellow in his new  home, he was so bravely and beautifully _himself_--and that only. A wild  flower transplanted from the prairie to the hot-house, he retained his  prairie habits, unalterably pure and simple, till he died. His leading  trait seemed to be a fearless and kindly frankness, willing that  everything should be as different as it pleased, but resting unmoved in  his own conscious single-heartedness. I found I was studying him  irresistibly, as one of the sweet problems of childhood that the world  is blessed with in rare places; and the news of his death (I was absent  from Washington, on a visit to my own children, at the time) came to me  like a knell heard unexpectedly at a merry-making.    \"On the day of the funeral I went before the hour, to take a near  farewell look at the dear boy; for they had embalmed him to send home to  the West--to sleep under the sod of his own valley--and the coffin-lid  was to be closed before the service. The family had just taken their  leave of him, and the servants and nurses were seeing him for the last  time--and with tears and sobs wholly unrestrained, for he was loved like  an idol by every one of them. He lay with eyes closed--his brown hair  parted as we had known it--pale in the slumber of death; but otherwise  unchanged, for he was dressed as if for the evening, and held in one of  his hands, crossed upon his breast, a bunch of exquisite flowers--a  message coming from his mother, while we were looking upon him, that  those flowers might be preserved for her. She was lying sick in her bed,  worn out with grief and over-watching.    \"The funeral was very touching. Of the entertainments in the East Room  the boy had been--for those who now assembled more especially--a most  life-giving variation. With his bright face, and his apt greetings and  replies, he was remembered in every part of that crimson-curtained hall,  built only for pleasure--of all the crowds, each night, certainly the  one least likely to be death's first mark. He was his father's  favorite. They were intimates--often seen hand in hand. And there sat  the man, with a burden on his brain at which the world marvels--bent now  with the load at both heart and brain--staggering under a blow like the  taking from him of his child! His men of power sat around  him--McClellan, with a moist eye when he bowed to the prayer, as I could  see from where I stood; and Chase and Seward, with their austere  features at work; and senators, and ambassadors, and soldiers, all  struggling with their tears--great hearts sorrowing with the President  as a stricken man and a brother. That God may give him strength for all  his burdens is, I am sure, at present the prayer of a nation.\"    This sketch was very much admired by Mrs. Lincoln. I copy it from the  scrap-book in which she pasted it, with many tears, with her own hands.          CHAPTER VII    WASHINGTON IN 1862-3      In the summer of 1862, freedmen began to flock into Washington from  Maryland and Virginia. They came with a great hope in their hearts, and  with all their worldly goods on their backs. Fresh from the bonds of  slavery, fresh from the benighted regions of the plantation, they came  to the Capital looking for liberty, and many of them not knowing it when  they found it. Many good friends reached forth kind hands, but the North  is not warm and impulsive. For one kind word spoken, two harsh ones were  uttered; there was something repelling in the atmosphere, and the bright  joyous dreams of freedom to the slave faded--were sadly altered, in the  presence of that stern, practical mother, reality. Instead of flowery  paths, days of perpetual sunshine, and bowers hanging with golden fruit,  the road was rugged and full of thorns, the sunshine was eclipsed by  shadows, and the mute appeals for help too often were answered by cold  neglect. Poor dusky children of slavery, men and women of my own  race--the transition from slavery to freedom was too sudden for you! The  bright dreams were too rudely dispelled; you were not prepared for the  new life that opened before you, and the great masses of the North  learned to look upon your helplessness with indifference--learned to  speak of you as an idle, dependent race. Reason should have prompted  kinder thoughts. Charity is ever kind.    One fair summer evening I was walking the streets of Washington,  accompanied by a friend, when a band of music was heard in the distance.  We wondered what it could mean, and curiosity prompted us to find out  its meaning. We quickened our steps, and discovered that it came from  the house of Mrs. Farnham. The yard was brilliantly lighted, ladies and  gentlemen were moving about, and the band was playing some of its  sweetest airs. We approached the sentinel on duty at the gate, and asked  what was going on. He told us that it was a festival given for the  benefit of the sick and wounded soldiers in the city. This suggested an  idea to me. If the white people can give festivals to raise funds for  the relief of suffering soldiers, why should not the well-to-do colored  people go to work to do something for the benefit of the suffering  blacks? I could not rest. The thought was ever present with me, and the  next Sunday I made a suggestion in the colored church, that a society of  colored people be formed to labor for the benefit of the unfortunate  freedmen. The idea proved popular, and in two weeks \"the Contraband  Relief Association\" was organized, with forty working members.    In September of 1862, Mrs. Lincoln left Washington for New York, and  requested me to follow her in a few days, and join her at the  Metropolitan Hotel. I was glad of the opportunity to do so, for I  thought that in New York I would be able to do something in the  interests of our society. Armed with credentials, I took the train for  New York, and went to the Metropolitan, where Mrs. Lincoln had secured  accommodations for me. The next morning I told Mrs. Lincoln of my  project; and she immediately headed my list with a subscription of $200.  I circulated among the colored people, and got them thoroughly  interested in the subject, when I was called to Boston by Mrs. Lincoln,  who wished to visit her son Robert, attending college in that city. I  met Mr. Wendell Phillips, and other Boston philanthropists, who gave me  all the assistance in their power. We held a mass meeting at the Colored  Baptist Church, Rev. Mr. Grimes, in Boston, raised a sum of money, and  organized there a branch society. The society was organized by Mrs.  Grimes, wife of the pastor, assisted by Mrs. Martin, wife of Rev. Stella  Martin. This branch of the main society, during the war, was able to  send us over eighty large boxes of goods, contributed exclusively by the  colored people of Boston. Returning to New York, we held a successful  meeting at the Shiloh Church, Rev. Henry Highland Garnet, pastor. The  Metropolitan Hotel, at that time as now, employed colored help. I  suggested the object of my mission to Robert Thompson, Steward of the  Hotel, who immediately raised quite a sum of money among the dining-room  waiters. Mr. Frederick Douglass contributed $200, besides lecturing for  us. Other prominent colored men sent in liberal contributions. From  England[B] a large quantity of stores was received. Mrs. Lincoln made  frequent contributions, as also did the President. In 1863 I was  re-elected President of the Association, which office I continue to  hold.    For two years after Willie's death the White House was the scene of no  fashionable display. The memory of the dead boy was duly respected. In  some things Mrs. Lincoln was an altered woman. Sometimes, when in her  room, with no one present but myself, the mere mention of Willie's name  would excite her emotion, and any trifling memento that recalled him  would move her to tears. She could not bear to look upon his picture;  and after his death she never crossed the threshold of the Guest's Room  in which he died, or the Green Room in which he was embalmed. There was  something supernatural in her dread of these things, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24989"],[0,"A Short Method Of Prayer (#10)"],[1,"those things which  are before; I press toward the mark\" (Phil. iii. 13, 14).    Should we not consider a person destitute of reason who, after  undertaking a journey, stopped at the first inn, because he was assured  that several had passed it, that a few had lodged there, and that the  landlord lived there? What the soul is required to do, then, is _to  advance towards its end_, to take the shortest road, not to stop at the  first point, and, following the advice of St Paul, to suffer itself to  be \"led by the Spirit of God\" (Rom. viii. 14), who will lead it to the  end for which it was created, which is the enjoyment of God.    It is well known that the sovereign good is God; that essential  blessedness consists in union with God, and that this union cannot be  the result of our own efforts, since God only communicates Himself to  the soul according to its capacity. We cannot be united to God without  passivity and simplicity; and this union being bliss, the way which  leads to it must be the best, and there can be no risk in walking in it.    This way is not _dangerous_. If it were, Christ would not have  represented it as the most perfect and necessary of all ways. All can  walk in it; and as all are called to blessedness, all are called to the  enjoyment of God, both in this life and in that which is to come, since  the enjoyment of God is blessedness. I say the enjoyment of God Himself,  not of His gifts, which can never impart essential blessedness, not  being able fully to satisfy the soul, which is so constituted that even  the richest gifts of God cannot thoroughly content it. The desire of God  is to give Himself to us, according to the capacity with which He has  endowed us; and yet we fear to leave ourselves to God! We fear to  possess Him, and to be prepared for divine union!    You say, _we must not bring ourselves to this condition_. I agree to  that; but I say too, that no one ever could bring himself to it, since  no man could ever unite himself to God by his own efforts, and God  Himself must do the work.    You say that some pretend to have attained it. I say that this state  cannot be feigned, any more than a man dying of hunger can for any  length of time pretend to be satisfied. It will soon be known whether or  no men have attained this end.    Since, then, none can arrive at the end unless he be brought there, it  is not a question of introducing people to it, but of showing them the  way which leads to it, and begging them not to rest in those practices  which must be relinquished at God's command.    Would it not be cruelty to show a fountain to a thirsty man, and then  hold him bound, and prevent his going to it, leaving him to die of  thirst? That is what is being done now. Let us all be agreed both as to  the way and the end. The way has its commencement, its progress, and  its terminus. The more we advance towards the terminus, the farther we  go from the commencement; and it is impossible to reach the terminus but  by constantly going farther from the starting-point, being unable to go  from one place to another without passing through all that comes between  them: this is incontestable.    Oh, how blind are the majority of men, who pride themselves upon their  learning and talent!    O Lord! how true it is that Thou hast hidden Thy secrets from the wise  and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes!"]]]
