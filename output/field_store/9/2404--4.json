Here the language of the Constitution is addressed  especially to the courts. It prescribes, directly for them, a rule of  evidence not to be departed from. If the legislature should change that  rule, and declare one witness, or a confession out of court, sufficient  for conviction, must the constitutional principle yield to the  legislative act?...    \"It is also not entirely unworthy of observation, that in declaring what  shall be the supreme law of the land, the Constitution itself is first  mentioned; and not the laws of the United States generally, but those  only which shall be made in pursuance of the Constitution, have that  rank.    \"Thus, the particular phraseology of the Constitution of the United  States confirms and strengthens the principle, supposed to be essential  to all written constitutions, that a law repugnant to the Constitution  is void; and that courts, as well as other departments are bound by that  instrument.\"    There is not a false step in Marshall's argument. It is, for instance,  not contended that the language of the Constitution establishes judicial  review but only that it \"confirms and strengthens the principle.\"  Granting the finality of judicial decisions and that they may not be  validly disturbed by legislative enactment, the argument is logically  conclusive, whatever practical difficulties it may ignore.    Turning back to the case itself, we ought finally to note how Marshall  utilized this opportunity to make manifest the newly found solidarity  of the Court. For the first time in its history the Court was one voice,  speaking through its Chief Justice the ineluctable decrees of the law.  Ordinarily even Marshall would not have found this achievement an easy  task, for there were difficult personalities among his associates. He  had in Adams's Cabinet demonstrated his faculty \"of putting his ideas  into the minds of others, unconsciously to them,\" and of this power  he now made use, as well as of the advantage to be obtained from the  impending common danger.    The case of Marbury vs. Madison was decided on February 24, 1803, and  therefore fell between two other events which were immediately of almost  as great importance in the struggle now waxing over the judiciary.  The first of these was the impeachment of Judge Pickering of the New  Hampshire District Court, which was suggested by the President on the  3d of February and voted by the House on the 18th of February; the  other was an address which Justice Chase delivered on the 2d of May to  a Baltimore grand jury, assailing the repeal of the Judiciary Act and  universal suffrage and predicting the deterioration of \"our republican  Constitution... into a mobocracy, the worst of all possible governments.\"  * Considering the fact that the President was still smarting from the  Chief Justice's lash and also that Chase himself was more heartily  detested by the Republicans than any other member of the Supreme Bench,  nothing could have been more untimely than this fresh judicial excursion  into the field of \"manners and morals,\" and partisan malice was  naturally alert to interpret it as something even more offensive. The  report soon came from Baltimore that Chase had deliberately assailed the  Administration as \"weak, pusillanimous, relaxed,\" and governed by the  sole desire of continuing \"in unfairly acquired power.\" But even before  this intelligence arrived, Jefferson had decided that the opportunity  afforded by Chase's outburst was too good a one to be neglected. Writing  on the 13th of May to Nicholson of Maryland, who already had Pickering's  impeachment in charge, the President inquired: \"Ought this seditious  and official attack on the principles of our Constitution and the  proceedings of a State go unpunished?\" But he straightway added: \"The  question is for your consideration; for myself it is better I should not  interfere.\"       * The account here given of Chase's trial is based on Charles  Evans's shorthand \"Report\" (Baltimore, 1805), supplemented by J.Q.  Adams's \"Memoirs\".      Pickering's trial began on March 2, 1804, and had a bearing on Chase's  fate which at once became clear. The evidence against the New Hampshire  judge showed intoxication and profanity on the bench and entire  unfitness for office, but further evidence introduced in his behalf  proved the defendant's insanity; and so the question at once arose  whether an insane man can be guilty of \"high crimes and misdemeanors?\"  Greatly troubled by this new aspect of the case, the Senate none the  less voted Pickering guilty \"as charged,\" by the required two-thirds  majority, though eight members refused to vote at all. But the exponents  of \"judge-breaking\" saw only the action of the Senate and were blind to  its hesitation. On the same day on which the Senate gave its verdict  on Dickering, the House by a strictly partisan vote decreed Chase's  impeachment.    The charges against Chase were finally elaborated in eight articles. The  substance of the first six was that he had been guilty of \"oppressive  conduct\" at the trials of John Fries and James Thompson Callender.  The seventh charged him with having attempted at some time in 1800 to  dragoon a grand jury at Newcastle, Delaware, into bringing forward  an accusation of sedition against a local paper. These seven articles  related therefore to transactions already four or five years old. The  eighth article alone was based on the address at Baltimore, which it  characterized as \"an intemperate and inflammatory political harangue,\"  delivered \"with intent to excite the fears and resentment... of the  good people of Maryland against their State Government and  Constitution,... and against the Government of the United States.\"    But the charges framed against Chase revealed only imperfectly the  animus which was now coming more and more to control the impeachers.  Fortunately, however, there was one man among the President's advisers  who was ready to carry the whole antijudicial program as far as  possible. This uncompromising opponent was William Branch Giles, Senator  from Virginia, whose views on the subject of impeachment were taken down  by John Quincy Adams just as Chase's trial was about to open. Giles,  according to this record, \"treated with the utmost contempt the idea  of an INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY--said there was not a word about their  independence in the Constitution.... The power of impeachment was given  without limitation to the House of Representatives; the power of trying  impeachment was given equally without limitation to the Senate; and  if the Judges of the Supreme Court should dare, as they had done, to  declare an act of Congress unconstitutional, or to send a mandamus to  the Secretary of State, as they had done, it was the unreserved right of  the House of Representatives to impeach them, and that of the Senate to  remove them, for giving such opinions, however, honest or sincere they  may have been in entertaining them.\" For \"impeachment was not a criminal  prosecution, it was no prosecution at all.\" It only signified that the  impeached officer held dangerous opinions and that his office ought to  be in better hands. \"I perceive,\" adds Adams, on his own account, \"that  the impeachment system is to be pursued, and the whole bench of the  Supreme Court to be swept away, because THEIR OFFICES are wanted. And  in the present state of things I am convinced it is as easy for Mr. John  Randolph and Mr. Giles to do this as to say it.\"    The trial formally opened on January 2, 1805, though the taking of  testimony did not begin until the 9th of February. A contemporary  description of the Senate chamber shows that the apostles of Republican  simplicity, with the pomp of the Warren Hastings trial still fresh  in mind, were not at all averse to making the scene as impressive as  possible by the use of several different colors of cloth: \"On the right  and left of the President of the Senate, and in a right line with his  chair, there are two rows of benches with desks in front, and the whole  front and seats covered with crimson cloth.... A temporary semi-circular  gallery, which consists of three ranges of benches, is elevated on  pillars and the whole front and seats thereof covered with green  cloth.... In this gallery ladies are accommodated.... On the right and  left hand of the President ... are two boxes of two rows of seats... that  facing the President's right is occupied by the managers... that on the  other side of the bar for the accused and his counsel... these boxes are  covered with blue cloth.\" To preside over this scene of somewhat dubious  splendor came Aaron Burr, Vice-President of the United States, straight  from the dueling ground at Weehawken.    The occasion brought forward one of the most extraordinary men of the  day, Luther Martin, Chase's friend and the leader of his counsel. Born  at New Brunswick, New Jersey, in 1744, Martin graduated from Princeton  in 1766, the first of a class of thirty-five, among whom was Oliver  Ellsworth. Five years later he began to practice law on the Eastern  Shore of Maryland and in the adjoining counties of Virginia, where he  won an immediate success, especially in criminal cases. At a single  term of court, out of thirty defendants he procured the acquittal of  twenty-nine, while the thirtieth, indicted for murder, was convicted of  manslaughter. In 1805 Martin was the acknowledged head of the  American Bar, but at the same time he was undoubtedly a drunkard and a  spendthrift. With an income of $10,000 a year, he was always in need.  His mediocre stature, thinning locks, and undistinguished features  created an impression which was confirmed by his slovenly attire  and ungrammatical speech, which seemed \"shackled by a preternatural  secretion of saliva.\" Here, indeed, for ugliness and caustic tongue was  \"the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32934"],[0,"The Young Colonists: A Story of the Zulu and Boer Wars (#10)"],[1,"1st battalion of the 1st Native Regiment, four  companies of the 1st battalion of the 24th, and 300 of the irregular  horse started on a reconnaissance towards the kraal of Sirayo, the chief  whose sons had been the greatest offenders in the raids into Natal.  The  cavalry were thrown out in skirmishing order, and after marching nine  miles they descended into the slope of the valley in which Sirayo's  kraals were situated.  The enemy were heard singing their war-songs in  one of the ravines, and the 3rd Native Regiment advanced against them  with the 24th in reserve.  The Zulus opened fire as they approached, and  so heavy was this that many of our natives turned and ran; they were  rallied, however, and with a rush carried the caves in which the Zulus  were lurking.    In the meantime the 24th's men had moved round to the head of the  ravine, and cut off the enemy's retreat.  There was a skirmish between  the cavalry and some mounted Zulus, and six of these, including a son of  Sirayo, were killed.  Thirty horses and 400 head of cattle were  captured.    The next day was spent in cleaning up arms and accoutrements, after the  heavy rain which had fallen the preceding week, and several days were  spent in making the roads passable for the waggons.    On the 20th the force moved forward, leaving one company of the 2nd  battalion of the 24th, under Lieutenant Bromhead, with some engineers  and a few natives to guard the ford and look after the platoons, and  garrison the store and hospital.  The column camped at Isandula, or, as  it is more properly called, Isandwhlana, ten miles distant from Rorke's  Drift.  A portion of the road was extremely rough, and the waggons had  the greatest difficulty in making their way forward.    The spot selected for a camping-ground was a wide flat valley, with  hills on the left and undulating ground on the right; almost in the  centre rose an isolated hill, perpendicular on three sides, and very  steep and difficult on the fourth.  The camp was pitched in front of  this hill, looking down the valley, with a mile of open country between  it and the hills on the left.    The camp was formed in the following order: on the left were the two  battalions of the 3rd Native Regiment; the Royal Artillery were in the  centre; next to these was the 2nd battalion of the 24th.  The line was  then taken up by the cavalry, with the 1st battalion of the 24th on the  right of the whole.  The waggons were all placed between the camp and  the hill at the back.    By a strange and criminal neglect no attempt was made to intrench this  position, although it was known that the column might at any moment be  attacked by the Zulus.    It was determined that the greater part of the force should advance the  next morning towards a stronghold, ten miles distant from the camp,  straight down the valley.  News had come that a large number of Zulus  were at this spot, and it was supposed that these would fight.  The  column consisted of eight companies of each of the battalions of the 3rd  Native Regiment, with the greater part of the cavalry.    The force started early and marched for three hours down the valley.  Here they came on much cultivated ground, but the kraals had been  deserted by the enemy.  At four o'clock, as the cavalry were skirmishing  at a distance on both flanks, they came upon a body of Zulus about 2000  strong.  The horse fell back upon the infantry, but, as it was now late,  Major Dartnell decided to encamp for the night, and to attack in the  morning.  A messenger was despatched into camp with a report of the  day's proceedings, and some provisions and blankets were sent out, with  news that the general would join the troops with reinforcements in the  morning.    At daybreak he left the camp at Isandula with seven companies of the 2nd  battalion of the 24th, and orders were sent to Colonel Durnford, at  Rorke's Drift, to bring up 200 mounted men and his rocket-battery, which  had reached that spot.    The Zulus were seen in all directions, and a good deal of skirmishing  took place.  By a gross neglect, equal to that which was manifested in  the omission to fortify the camp, no steps whatever were taken to keep  up communication between the column, which now consisted of the greater  part of the troops, and those who remained at the camp at Isandula.  No  signallers were placed on the hills, no mounted videttes were posted,  and the column marched on, absorbed in its own skirmishes with the  enemy, as if the general in command had forgotten the very existence of  the force at Isandula.  Even in the middle of the day, when the firing  of cannon told that the camp was attacked, no steps were taken to  ascertain whether reinforcements were needed there, and it was not until  hours after all was over that a party was despatched to ascertain what  had taken place at the camp.    Upon the day on which the two native regiments advanced, the two boys  felt the time hang heavy on their hands; they would have liked to take  their guns and go out to shoot some game for their dinners, but all  shooting had been strictly forbidden, as the sound of a gun might cause  a false alarm.  After hanging about the camp for an hour or two, Dick  proposed that they should climb the hill which rose so steeply behind  them.    \"If the columns have any fighting,\" he said, \"we should be sure to see  it from the top.\"    Borrowing a telescope from one of the officers of the volunteer cavalry,  they skirted round to the back of the hill, and there began their climb.  It was very steep, but after some hard work they reached the summit,  and then crossed to the front and sat down in a comfortable niche in the  rock, whence they could command a view far down the valley.  They could  see the two battalions of infantry marching steadily along, and the  cavalry moving among the hills and undulations on both flanks.  They had  taken some biscuits and a bottle of beer up with them, and spent the  whole day on the look-out.  The view which they gained was a very  extensive one, as the hill was far higher than those on either side, and  in many places they could see small bodies of the enemy moving about.  At sunset they descended.    \"I vote we go up again,\" Tom said the next morning.  \"The general has  gone forward with most of the white troops, and there is sure to be  fighting to-day.  We shall have nothing to do, and may as well go up  there as anywhere else.\"    After the general's departure there remained in camp five companies of  the 1st battalion of the 24th, and one of the 2nd battalion, two  field-pieces with their artillery men, and some mounted men.    Just as the boys were starting at eight in the morning, there was a  report in the camp that the Zulus were gathering in force to the north  of the camp.  This quickened the boys' movements and half an hour later  they gained the top of the hill, and from their old position looked down  upon the camp lying many hundred feet below them.  There was  considerable bustle going on, and the Kaffir drivers were hastily  collecting the cattle which were grazing round, and were driving them  into camp.    \"There is going to be a fight!\"  Dick exclaimed, as they gained their  look-out; \"there are crowds of Zulus out there on the plains.\"    Could the boys have looked over the hills a mile away to their right,  they would have seen that the number of Zulus down in the valley in  front was but a small proportion of those gathering for the attack; for  15,000 men had moved up during the night, and were lying quietly behind  those hills, 3000 or 4000 more were taking the road to Rorke's Drift, to  cut off any who might escape from the camp, while as many more were  showing down the valley.  Altogether some 24,000 of the enemy had  gathered round the little body in the camp.  To the boys, however, only  the party down the valley was visible.    At eleven o'clock Colonel Durnford came into camp with his 350 mounted  men from Rorke's Drift, and advanced with them to meet the enemy  threatening the left flank, while two companies of the 1st battalion of  the 24th moved out to attack their right.  The Zulus, now reinforced  from behind the hills, moved forward steadily, and Colonel Durnford with  his cavalry could do little to arrest them.  For an hour the infantry  stood their ground, and the two field-pieces swept lines through the  thick ranks of the enemy.  The Zulus advanced in the form of a great  crescent.    \"Things look very bad, Dick,\" Tom said; \"what do you think we had better  do?\"    \"I think we had better stay where we are, Tom, and wait and see what  occurs; we have a splendid view of the fight, and if our fellows meet  them we shall see it all; but if--oh, look there, Tom!\"    Over the hills on the left thousands of Zulus were seen pouring down.    \"This is terrible, Tom.  Look here, I will crawl along over the crest,  so as not to be seen, and look behind to see if it is clear there.  If  it is, I vote we make a bolt.  It is of no use our thinking of going  down for a couple of horses; the Zulus will be in the camp long before  we could get there.\"    Five minutes later he again joined his friend.    \"They are coming up behind too, Tom.  They have really surrounded us.  Look, they are close to the camp!\"    It was a scene of frightful confusion.  Nothing could be seen of the  companies of the 24th, which had gone out to meet the Zulus.  The great  wave of the advancing army had swept over them.  Below, the panic was  complete and terrible, and soldiers, native drivers, and camp-followers  were running wildly in all directions.    One party of the 24th's men, about sixty strong, had gathered together  and stood like a little island.  The incessant fire of their rifles  covered them with white smoke, while a dense mass of Zulus pressed upon  them.  Many of the soldiers were flying for their lives; others again,  when they found that their retreat was cut off,"]]]
