It was once upon a time thought to belong to the moon, and to be perhaps  a lunar atmosphere illuminated by the sunlight shining through it from  behind. But the suddenness with which the moon always blots out stars  when occulting them, has amply proved that she possesses no atmosphere  worth speaking about. It is now, however, satisfactorily determined that  the corona belongs to the sun, for during the short time that it remains  in view the black body of the moon can be seen creeping across it.    All the time that the _total phase_ (as it is called) lasts, the corona  glows with its pale unearthly light, shedding upon the earth's surface  an illumination somewhat akin to full moonlight. Usually the planet  Venus and a few stars shine out the while in the darkened heaven.  Meantime around the observer animal and plant life behave as at  nightfall. Birds go to roost, bats fly out, worms come to the surface of  the ground, flowers close up. In the Norwegian eclipse of 1896 fish were  seen rising to the surface of the water. When the total phase at length  is over, and the moon in her progress across the sky has allowed the  brilliant disc of the sun to spring into view once more at the other  side, the corona disappears.    There is another famous accompaniment of the sun which partly reveals  itself during total solar eclipses. This is a layer of red flame which  closely envelops the body of the sun and lies between it and the corona.  This layer is known by the name of the _Chromosphere_. Just as at  ordinary times we cannot see the corona on account of the blaze of  sunlight, so are we likewise unable to see the chromosphere because of  the dazzling white light which shines through from the body of the sun  underneath and completely overpowers it. When, however, during a solar  eclipse, the lunar disc has entirely hidden the brilliant face of the  sun, we are still able for a few moments to see an edgewise portion of  the chromosphere in the form of a narrow red strip, fringing the  advancing border of the moon. Later on, just before the moon begins to  uncover the face of the sun from the other side, we may again get a view  of a strip of chromosphere.    The outer surface of the chromosphere is not by any means even. It is  rough and billowy, like the surface of a storm-tossed sea. Portions of  it, indeed, rise at times to such heights that they may be seen standing  out like blood-red points around the black disc of the moon, and remain  thus during a good part of the total phase. These projections are known  as the _Solar Prominences_. In the same way as the corona, the  chromosphere and prominences were for a time supposed to belong to the  moon. This, however, was soon found not to be the case, for the lunar  disc was noticed to creep slowly across them also.    The total phase, or \"totality,\" as it is also called, lasts for  different lengths of time in different eclipses. It is usually of about  two or three minutes' duration, and at the utmost it can never last  longer than about eight minutes.    When totality is over and the corona has faded away, the moon's disc  creeps little by little from the face of the sun, light and heat returns  once more to the earth, and nature recovers gradually from the gloom in  which she has been plunged. About an hour after totality, the last  remnant of moon draws away from the solar disc, and the eclipse is  entirely at an end.    The corona, the chromosphere, and the prominences are the most important  of these accompaniments of the sun which a total eclipse reveals to us.  Our further consideration of them must, however, be reserved for a  subsequent chapter, in which the sun will be treated of at length.    Every one who has had the good fortune to see a total eclipse of the sun  will, the writer feels sure, agree with the verdict of Sir Norman  Lockyer that it is at once one of the \"grandest and most awe-inspiring  sights\" which man can witness. Needless to say, such an occurrence used  to cause great consternation in less civilised ages; and that it has not  in modern times quite parted with its terrors for some persons, is shown  by the fact that in Iowa, in the United States, a woman died from fright  during the eclipse of 1869.    To the serious observer of a total solar eclipse every instant is  extremely precious. Many distinct observations have to be crowded into a  time all too limited, and this in an eclipse-party necessitates constant  rehearsals in order that not a moment may be wasted when the longed-for  totality arrives. Such preparation is very necessary; for the rarity and  uncommon nature of a total eclipse of the sun, coupled with its  exceeding short duration, tends to flurry the mind, and to render it  slow to seize upon salient points of detail. And, even after every  precaution has been taken, weather possibilities remain to be reckoned  with, so that success is rather a lottery.    Above all things, therefore, a total solar eclipse is an occurrence for  the proper utilisation of which personal experience is of absolute  necessity. It was manifestly out of the question that such experience  could be gained by any individual in early times, as the imperfection  of astronomical theory and geographical knowledge rendered the  predicting of the exact position of the track of totality well-nigh  impossible. Thus chance alone would have enabled one in those days to  witness a total phase, and the probabilities, of course, were much  against a second such experience in the span of a life-time. And even in  more modern times, when the celestial motions had come to be better  understood, the difficulties of foreign travel still were in the way;  for it is, indeed, a notable fact that during many years following the  invention of the telescope the tracks were placed for the most part in  far-off regions of the earth, and Europe was visited by singularly few  total solar eclipses. Thus it came to pass that the building up of a  body of organised knowledge upon this subject was greatly delayed.    Nothing perhaps better shows the soundness of modern astronomical theory  than the almost exact agreement of the time predicted for an eclipse  with its actual occurrence. Similarly, by calculating backwards,  astronomers have discovered the times and seasons at which many ancient  eclipses took place, and valuable opportunities have thus arisen for  checking certain disputed dates in history.    It should not be omitted here that the ancients were actually able, _in  a rough way_, to predict eclipses. The Chaldean astronomers had indeed  noticed very early a curious circumstance, _i.e._ that eclipses tend to  repeat themselves after a lapse of slightly more than eighteen years.    In this connection it must, however, be pointed out, in the first  instance, that the eclipses which occur in any particular year are in  no way associated with those which occurred in the previous year. In  other words, the mere fact that an eclipse takes place upon a certain  day this year will not bring about a repetition of it at the same time  next year. However, the nicely balanced behaviour of the solar system,  an equilibrium resulting from aeons of orbital ebb and flow, naturally  tends to make the members which compose that family repeat their ancient  combinations again and again; so that after definite lapses of time the  same order of things will _almost exactly_ recur. Thus, as a consequence  of their beautifully poised motions, the sun, the moon, and the earth  tend, after a period of 18 years and 10-1/3 days,[5] to occupy very  nearly the same positions with regard to each other. The result of this  is that, during each recurring period, the eclipses comprised within it  will be repeated in their order.    To give examples:--    The total solar eclipse of August 30, 1905, was a repetition of that of  August 19, 1887.    The partial solar eclipse of February 23, 1906, corresponded to that  which took place on February 11, 1888.    The annular eclipse of July 10, 1907, was a recurrence of that of June  28, 1889.    In this way we can go on until the eighteen year cycle has run out, and  we come upon a total solar eclipse predicted for September 10, 1923,  which will repeat the above-mentioned ones of 1905 and 1887; and so on  too with the others.    From mere observation alone, extending no doubt over many ages, those  time-honoured watchers of the sky, the early Chaldeans, had arrived at  this remarkable generalisation; and they used it for the rough  prediction of eclipses. To the period of recurrence they give the name  of \"Saros.\"    And here we find ourselves led into one of the most interesting and  fascinating by-paths in astronomy, to which writers, as a rule, pay all  too little heed.    In order not to complicate matters unduly, the recurrence of solar  eclipses alone will first be dealt with. This limitation will, however,  not affect the arguments in the slightest, and it will be all the more  easy in consequence to show their application to the case of eclipses of  the moon.    The reader will perhaps have noticed that, with regard to the repetition  of an eclipse, it has been stated that the conditions which bring it on  at each recurrence are reproduced _almost exactly_. Here, then, lies the  _crux_ of the situation. For it is quite evident that were the  conditions _exactly_ reproduced, the recurrences of each eclipse would  go on for an indefinite period. For instance, if the lapse of a saros  period found the sun, moon, and earth again in the precise relative  situations which they had previously occupied, the recurrences of a  solar eclipse would tend to duplicate its forerunner with regard to the  position of the shadow upon the terrestrial surface. But the conditions  _not_ being exactly reproduced, the shadow-track does not pass across  the earth in quite the same regions.

One of the main reasons I came on this hunt was  to take the trip for _you_, and to tell you things that you would most  enjoy. So I will spend this snowy day in writing to you.    On the night of September 30, there was the most awful thunderstorm  I ever witnessed,--flash after flash of the most blinding lightning,  followed by deafening peals of thunder; and as it echoed from mountain  to mountain the uproar was terrifying. I have always loved a storm;  the beat of hail and rain, and the roar of wind always appeal to me;  but there was neither wind nor rain,--just flash and roar. Before the  echo died away among the hills another booming report would seem to  shiver the atmosphere and set all our tinware jangling. We are camped  so near the great pines that I will confess I was powerfully afraid.  Had the lightning struck one of the big pines there would not have  been one of us left. I could hear Mrs. O'Shaughnessy murmuring her  prayers when there was a lull. We had gone to bed, but I couldn't  remain there; so I sat on the wagon-seat with Jerrine beside me.  Something struck the guy ropes of the tent, and I was so frightened  I was too weak to cry out. I thought the big tree must have fallen.  In the lulls of the storm I could hear the men's voices, high and  excited. They, too, were up. It seemed to me that the storm lasted  for hours; but at last it moved off up the valley, the flashes grew to  be a mere glimmer, and the thunder mere rumbling. The pines began to  moan, and soon a little breeze whistled by. So we lay down again. Next  morning the horses could not be found; the storm had frightened them,  and they had tried to go home. The men had to find them, and as it  took most of the day, we had to put off our hunt.    We were up and about next morning in the first faint gray light. While  the men fed grain to the horses and saddled them, we prepared a hasty  breakfast. We were off before it was more than light enough for us to  see the trail.    Dawn in the mountains--how I wish I could describe it to you! If I  could only make you feel the keen, bracing air, the exhilarating  climb; if I could only paint its beauties, what a picture you should  have! Here the colors are very different from those of the desert. I  suppose the forest makes it so. The shadows are mellow, like the  colors in an old picture--greenish amber light and a blue-gray sky.  Far ahead of us we could see the red rim rock of a mountain above  timber line. The first rays of the sun turned the jagged peaks into  golden points of a crown. In Oklahoma, at that hour of the day, the  woods would be alive with song-birds, even at this season; but here  there are no song-birds, and only the snapping of twigs, as our horses  climbed the frosty trail, broke the silence. We had been cautioned not  to talk, but neither Mrs. O'Shaughnessy nor I wanted to. Afterwards,  when we compared notes, we found that we both had the same thought: we  both felt ashamed to be out to deal death to one of the Maker's  beautiful creatures, and we were planning how we might avoid it.    The sun was well up when we reached the little park where we picketed  our horses. Then came a long, hard climb. It is hard climbing at the  best, and when there is a big gun to carry, it is _very_ hard. Then  too, we had to keep up with the men, and we didn't find that easy to  do. At last we reached the top and sat down on some boulders to rest a  few minutes before we started down to the hunting ground, which lay in  a cuplike valley far below us.    We could hear the roar of the Gros Ventre as it tumbled grumblingly  over its rocky bed. To our right rose mile after mile of red cliffs.  As the last of the quaking asp leaves have fallen, there were no  golden groves. In their places stood silvery patches against the red  background of the cliffs. High overhead a triangle of wild geese  harrowed the blue sky.    I was plumb out of breath, but men who are most gallant elsewhere are  absolutely heartless on a hunt. I was scarcely through panting before  we began to descend. We received instructions as to how we should move  so as to keep out of range of each other's guns; then Mr. Haynes and  myself started one way, and Mr. Struble and Mrs. O'Shaughnessy the  other. We were to meet where the valley terminated in a broad pass. We  felt sure we could get a chance at what elk there might be in the  valley. We were following fresh tracks, and a little of the hunter's  enthusiasm seized me.    We had not followed them far when three cows and a \"spike\" came  running out of the pines a little ahead of us. Instantly Mr. Haynes's  gun flew to his shoulder and a deafening report jarred our ears. He  ran forward, but I stood still, fascinated by what I saw. Our side of  the valley was bounded by a rim of rock. Over the rim was a sheer wall  of rock for two hundred feet, to where the Gros Ventre was angrily  roaring below; on the other side of the stream rose the red cliffs  with their jagged crags. At the report of the gun two huge blocks of  stone almost as large as a house detached themselves and fell. At the  same instant one of the quaking asp groves began to move slowly. I  couldn't believe my eyes. I shut them a moment, but when I looked the  grove was moving faster. It slid swiftly, and I could plainly hear the  rattle of stones falling against stones, until with a muffled roar the  whole hillside fell into the stream.    Mr. Haynes came running back. \"What is the matter? Are you hurt? Why  didn't you shoot?\" he asked.    I waved my hand weakly toward where the great mound of tangled  trees and earth blocked the water. \"Why,\" he said, \"that is only a  landslide, not an earthquake. You are as white as a ghost. Come on up  here and see my fine elk.\"    I sat on a log watching him dress his elk. We have found it best not  to remove the skin, but the elk have to be quartered so as to load  them on to a horse. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy and Mr. Struble came out of the  woods just then. They had seen a big bunch of elk headed by a splendid  bull, but got no shot, and the elk went out of the pass. They had  heard our shot, and came across to see what luck.    \"What iver is the matter with ye?\" asked Mrs. O'Shaughnessy. Mr.  Haynes told her. They had heard the noise, but had thought it thunder.  Mr. Haynes told me that if I would \"chirk up\" he would give me his elk  teeth. Though I don't admire them, they are considered valuable;  however, his elk was a cow, and they don't have as nice teeth as do  bulls.    We had lunch, and the men covered the elk with pine boughs to keep the  camp robbers from pecking it full of holes. Next day the men would  come with the horses and pack it in to camp. We all felt refreshed; so  we started on the trail of those that got away.    For a while walking was easy and we made pretty good time; then we had  a rocky hill to get over. We had to use care when we got into the  timber; there were marshy places which tried us sorely, and windfall  so thick that we could hardly get through. We were obliged to pick our  way carefully to avoid noise, and we were all together, not having  come to a place where it seemed better to separate. We had about  resolved to go to our horses when we heard a volley of shots.    \"That is somebody bunch-shooting,\" said Mr. Struble. \"They are in  Brewster Lake Park, by the sound. That means that the elk will pass  here in a short time and we may get a shot. The elk will be here long  before the men, since the men have no horses; so let's hurry and get  placed along the only place they can get out. We'll get our limit.\"    We hastily secreted ourselves along the narrow gorge through which the  elk must pass. We were all on one side, and Mr. Haynes said to me,  \"Rest your gun on that rock and aim at the first rib back of the  shoulder. If you shoot haphazard you may cripple an elk and let it get  away to die in misery. So make sure when you fire.\"    It didn't seem a minute before we heard the beat of their hoofs and a  queer panting noise that I can't describe. First came a beautiful  thing with his head held high; his great antlers seemed to lie half  his length on his back; his eyes were startled, and his shining black  mane seemed to bristle. I heard the report of guns, and he tumbled in  a confused heap. He tried to rise, but others coming leaped over him  and knocked him down. Some more shots, and those behind turned and  went back the way they had come.    Mr. Haynes shouted to me, \"Shoot, shoot; why _don't_ you shoot!\"    So I fired my Krag, but next I found myself picking myself up and  wondering who had struck me and for what. I was so dizzy I could  scarcely move, but I got down to where the others were excitedly  admiring the two dead elk that they said were the victims of Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy's gun. She was as excited and delighted as if she had  never declared she would not kill anything. \"Sure, it's many a meal  they'll make for little hungry mouths,\" she said. She was rubbing her  shoulder ruefully. \"I don't want to fire any more big guns. I thought  old Goliar had hit me a biff with a blackthorn shilaley,\" she  remarked.    Mr. Haynes turned to me and said, \"You are a dandy hunter! you didn't  shoot at all until after the elk were gone, and the way you held your  gun it is a wonder it didn't knock your head off, instead of just  smashing your jaw.\"    The men worked as fast as they could at the elk, and we helped as much  as we could, but it was dark before we reached camp. Supper was ready,  but I went to bed at once. They all thought it was because I was so  disappointed, but it was because I was so stiff and sore I could  hardly move, and so tired I couldn't sleep. Next morning my jaw and  neck were so swollen that I hated any one to see me, and my head ached  for two days. It has been snowing for a long time, but Clyde says he  will take me hunting when it stops. I don't want to"]]]
