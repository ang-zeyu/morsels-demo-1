The contributions of food and clothing had been sent to Beaufort, and  were in the warehouses of the perplexed committee of its leading  citizens. This had naturally drawn all the inhabitants of the scores of  desolated islands for fifty miles to Beaufort, until, it is safe to say,  that fifteen to twenty thousand refugees had gathered there, living in  its streets and waiting to be fed from day to day.    As the food was there they could not be induced to return to the  islands. Indeed, there was more often nothing on the islands to return  to. The description given by the heads of families and owners, for they  had largely owned their homes, gotten on the old-time plantations \"'fo  de wah,\" was this: If all had been swept out to sea and nothing  remained, it was described as, \"done gone.\" But if thrown down and parts  of the wreck still remained, it was described as \"ractified.\"    A few of the churches, being larger and more strongly built, still  remained standing. During the first ten days of our stay it would have  been impossible to drive through the principal streets of Beaufort. They  were a solid moving mass, crowding as near to the storehouses as  possible to get, in spite of the policeman, who kindly held them back.    We sat daily in counsel with the local committee, until seeing that only  systematic measures and a decided change could relieve the conditions  and render the city safe. We then, on the first of October, decided to  accede to the request of the Governor made at first, and take sole  charge of the relief.    Our first order was to close every storehouse, both of food and  clothing, and inform the people that all distributions would hereafter  be made from the islands. It is impossible to convey to the mind of the  reader the difficulty of getting into a few intelligent sentences the  idea of the means adopted to produce these changes and inaugurate a  system that was to restore to active habits of life a body of utterly  homeless, demoralized, and ignorant people, equal in numbers to a small  new State.    If these little covers would admit the scores of pages of admirably  written reports of the officers and helpers on that field, every line  replete with interest, that lie here at my hand, it would be an easy and  a welcome task to reproduce them entire, and no more than deserved for  their faithful and gratuitous labor.    Dr. Egan's report has this passage:    \"October 2d came my marching orders. Take charge of the warehouse and  stores, make an inventory of them, disperse these men, and rid the city  of the demoralizing influence of idle people. The doors are closed and  the inventory begun.\"    The local committee had kindly pointed out the most suitable man to take  charge of each community, and to him would be consigned the rations to  be distributed to each family and person within his charge, for which  receipt and distribution he became as responsible as a merchant.    The goods and rations were at once shipped across the bay to them, or  taken on their own boats, if so fortunate as to have one left from the  storm. It is needless to say that the multitude followed the food.    In three days there were not people enough left in Beaufort, besides its  own, to be hired for a \"job of work.\" Then followed the necessity for  material to rebuild the \"done gone,\" and to repair the \"ractified\"  homes.    A million feet of pine lumber was purchased of a leading lumber dealer,  shipped down the Combahee River, and delivered at the landings on the  islands most convenient of access to the points needed. Each man  received his lumber by order and receipt, and was under obligation to  build his own house. The work was all performed by themselves. A garden  was insisted upon. At first this proposition was resisted as  impracticable.    \"No use, Mistah--no use--'cause de pig eat it all up.\"    It was suggested that a fence might be made enclosing at least a quarter  of an acre about the house to keep \"de pig\" out, as we should later  send, for planting, the best seed to be obtained in the country.    To this moment our thanks go out to the Agricultural Department at  Washington, and the great seed houses of all the North, for the generous  donations that served to bring once more into self-sustaining relations  this destitute and well-disposed people.    The fact that the building of the fence, and its subsequent keeping in  strict repair, had some bearing on the weekly issuance of rations, was  evidently not without its influence. There were no poor fences and \"de  pig\" did no damage. But there were such gardens, and of such varieties,  as those islands had never before seen.    The earliest crop to strive for, beside the gardens, was the Irish  potato, which they had never raised. Nine hundred bushels were purchased  from Savannah for planting in February. The difficulty of distributing  the potatoes lay in the fact that they would be more likely to find  their way into the dinner pot than into the ground. To avoid this the  court-yard inside our headquarters was appropriated for the purpose of  preparing the potatoes for planting.    Some forty women were hired to come over from the islands and cut  potatoes for seed--every \"eye\" of the potato making a sprout--these  distributed to them by the peck, like other seed.    I recall a fine, bright morning in May, when I was told that a woman who  had come over from St. Helena in the night, waited at the door to see  me. I went to the door to find a tall, bright-looking woman in a clean  dress, with a basket on her head, which, after salutation, she lowered  and held out to me. There was something over a peck of Early Rose  potatoes in the basket--in size from a pigeon's to a pullet's egg. The  grateful woman could wait no longer for the potatoes to grow larger,  but had dug these, and had come ten miles over the sea, in the night, to  bring them to me as a first offering of food of her own raising.    If the tears fell on the little gift as I looked and remembered, no one  will wonder or criticise. The potatoes were cooked for breakfast, and  \"Susie Jane\" was invited to partake.    The shores of the mainland had not been exempt from the ravages of the  storm and in many instances had suffered like the islands. Some thirty  miles above Beaufort was a kind of plantation, with a community of sixty  or seventy families of colored people. The property was owned by two  elderly white ladies who had not returned since driven away by the  storm.    This village was reported to us as in need and demoralized, with no  head, scant of food, and its \"ractified\" houses scarcely affording a  shelter.    A representative mulatto man came to tell us. An inspection was made and  resulted in this man being put in charge to build up the community.  Lumber and food were provided and the people set to work under his  charge. From time to time word came to us, and after some months the  tall representative came again. He had been asked by the people to come  and bring their thanks to the Red Cross for \"de home, de gard'n, de pig,  and de chick'n dey all has now.\"    The thanks they had emphasized and proved by the heavy basket that  Jackson had carefully brought all the forty miles. It contained  seventy-one fresh eggs--the gift of seventy-one families--being a  contribution of one egg from each family, from the day or two previous  to his leaving on his mission.    Domestic gardens were a new feature among these islanders, whose whole  attention had been always given to the raising of the renowned \"Sea  Island Cotton,\" the pride of the market, and a just distinction to  themselves and the worthy planter. The result of this innovation was  that, when we left in July, it was nearly as difficult for a pedestrian  to make his way on the narrow sidewalks of Beaufort because of piled-up  vegetables for sale from the islands, as it had been in October to pass  through the streets because of hungry, idle men and women.    Nothing better illustrates the native good heart of these people than  their kindly interest in and for each other. Often the young men,  without families, would club together and put up a house for some lone  old \"auntie,\" who had neither family nor home, and occasionally there  seemed to develop among them an active philanthropist. Of this type was  Jack Owens, who rebuilt his own \"done gone\" premises. One day as the  field agent was driving out on some inspection he met Jack walking into  town.    His decrepit neighbor's house had burned a few weeks before, and Jack  had gotten lumber and rebuilt the house himself. In describing the utter  devastation, Jack explained that \"all de house and de well was  burned\"--and he had built another house and was coming in on foot \"for  funituh to funish it.\" Jack had lost his ox, \"a big ox,\" he said, in the  storm, and now he \"hadn't any nuther\" to plow his ground. He pleaded for  another--if it was only \"a lil' critter it would grow big\"--and it would  help him so much.    The appeal was not to be resisted. Dr. Hubbell treasures to this day the  satisfaction he felt in procuring something better than the \"lil'  critter\" as reward and encouragement for Jack's active philanthropy.    If any practical woman reading this should try to comprehend what it  would be to undertake to clothe and keep clothed thirty thousand human  beings for a year, and to do this from the charitable gifts of the  people, which gifts had all done more or less service before--often  pretty thoroughly \"ractified\"--this woman will not wonder that sewing  societies suggested themselves to us at headquarters.    The women were called together and this suggestion made to them, with  the result that an old time \"sewing circle\" was instituted in every  community.

If the whole idea were not too preposterous for  even a half-witted child to believe, one might ask, What in the name  of anything and everything but the \"Modern School of Nature Study\" do  orioles know about strings fraying in the wind and the use of knots to  prevent it? They have never had occasion to know; they have had no  experience with strings that hang loose and unravel in the wind. They  often use strings, to be sure, in building their nests, but they use  them in a sort of haphazard way, weaving them awkwardly into the  structure, and leaving no loose ends that would suffer by fraying in  the wind. Sometimes they use strings in attaching the nest to the  limb, but they never knot or tie them; they simply wind them round and  round as a child might. It is possible that a bird might be taught to  tie a knot with its foot and beak, though I should have to see it done  to be convinced. But the orioles in question not only tied knots; they  tied them with a \"reversed double hitch, the kind that a man uses in  cinching his saddle\"! More wonderful still, not finding in a New  England elm-embowered town a suitable branch from which to suspend  their nest, the birds went down upon the ground and tied three twigs  together in the form of \"a perfectly measured triangle\" (no doubt  working from a plan drawn to a scale). They attached to the three  sides of this framework four strings of equal length (eight or ten  inches), all carefully doubled, tied them to a heavier string, carried  the whole ingenious contrivance to a tree, and tied it fast to a limb  in precisely the way you or I would have done it! From this framework  they suspended their nest, the whole structure being about two feet  long, and having the effect of a small hanging basket. Still more  astonishing, when the genuineness of the nest is questioned, a man is  found who makes affidavit that he saw the orioles build it! After such  a proceeding, how long will it be before the water-birds are building  little rush cradles for their young, or rush boats to be driven about  the ponds and lakes by means of leaf sails, or before Jenny Wren will  be living in a log cabin of her own construction? How long will it be  before some one makes affidavit that the sparrow with his bow and  arrow has actually been seen to kill Cock Robin, and the beetle with  his thread and needle engaged in making the shroud? Birds show the  taste and skill of their kind in building their nests, but rarely any  individual ingenuity and inventiveness. The nest referred to is on a  plane entirely outside of Nature and her processes. It belongs to a  different order of things, the order of mechanical contrivances, and  was of course \"made up,\" probably from a real oriole's nest, and the  writer who vouches for its genuineness has been the victim of a clever  practical joke--a willing victim, no doubt, since he is looking in  Nature for just this kind of thing, and since he believes there is  \"absolutely no limit to the variety and adaptiveness of Nature even in  a single species.\" If there is no such limit, then I suppose we need  not be surprised to meet a winged horse, or a centaur, or a mermaid at  any time.    It is as plain as anything can be that the animals share our emotional  nature in vastly greater measure than they do our intellectual or our  moral nature; and because they do this, because they show fear, love,  joy, anger, sympathy, jealousy, because they suffer and are glad,  because they form friendships and local attachments and have the home  and paternal instincts, in short, because their lives run parallel to  our own in so many particulars, we come, if we are not careful, to  ascribe to them the whole human psychology. But it is equally plain  that of what we mean by mind, intellect, they show only a trace now  and then. They do not accumulate a store of knowledge any more than  they do a store of riches. A store of knowledge is impossible without  language. Man began to emerge from the lower orders when he invented a  language of some sort. As the language of animals is little more than  various cries expressive of pleasure or pain, or fear or suspicion,  they do not think in any proper sense, because they have no terms in  which to think--no language. I shall have more to say upon this point  in another chapter. One trait they do show which is the first step  toward knowledge--curiosity. Nearly all the animals show at times  varying degrees of curiosity, but here again an instinctive feeling of  possible danger probably lies back of it. They even seem to show at  times a kind of altruistic feeling. A correspondent writes me that she  possessed a canary which lived to so great an age that it finally  became so feeble it could not crack the seeds she gave it, when the  other birds, its own progeny, it is true, fed it; and Darwin cites  cases of blind birds, in a state of nature, being fed by their  fellows. Probably it would be hasty to conclude that such acts show  anything more than instinct. I should be slow to ascribe to the  animals any notion of the uses of punishment as we practice it, though  the cat will box her kittens when they play too long with her tail,  and the mother hen will separate her chickens when they get into a  fight, and sometimes peck one or both of them on the head, as much as  to say, \"There, don't you do that again.\" The rooster will in the same  way separate two hens when they are fighting. On the surface this  seems like a very human act, but can we say that it is punishment or  discipline in the human sense, as having for its aim a betterment of  the manners of the kittens or of the chickens? The cat aims to get rid  of an annoyance, and the rooster and the mother hen interfere to  prevent an injury to members of their family; they exhibit the  paternal and maternal instinct of protection. More than that would  imply ethical considerations, of which the lower animals are not  capable. The act of the baboon, mentioned by Darwin, I believe, that  examined the paws of the cat that had scratched it, and then  deliberately bit off the nails, belongs to a different and to a  higher order of conduct.    A complete statement of the factors that shape the lives of the lower  orders would include three terms--instinct, imitation (though,  doubtless, this is instinctive), and experience. Instinct is, of  course, the main factor, and by this term we mean that which prompts  an animal or a man to act spontaneously, without instruction or  experience. All creatures are imitative, and man himself not the least  so. I had a visit the other day from a woman who had spent the last  two years in London, and her speech betrayed the fact; she had quite  unconsciously caught certain of the English mannerisms of speech. A  few years in the South will give the New Englander the Southern  accent, and vice versa. The young are, of course, more imitative than  the old. Children imitate their parents; the young writer imitates his  favorite author.    Animals of different species closely associated will imitate each  other. A lady writes me that she has a rabbit that lives in a cage  with a monkey, and that it has caught many of the monkey's ways. I can  well believe it. Dogs reared with cats have been known to acquire the  cat habit of licking the paws and then washing the ears and face.  Wolves reared with dogs learn to bark, and who has not seen a dog draw  its face as if trying to laugh as its master does? When a cat has been  taught to sit up for its food, its kittens have been known to imitate  the mother. Darwin tells of a cat that used to put its paw into the  mouth of a narrow milk-jug and then lick it off, and that its kittens  soon learned the same trick. In all such cases, hasty observers say  the mother taught its young. Certainly the young learned, but there  was no effort to teach on the part of the parent. Unconscious  imitation did it all. Our \"Modern School of Nature Study\" would say  that the old sow teaches her pigs to root when they follow her afield,  rooting in their little ways as she does. But would she not root if  she had no pigs, and would not the pigs root if they had no mother?  All acts necessary to an animal's life and to the continuance of the  species are instinctive; the creature does not have to be taught them,  nor are they acquired by imitation. The bird does not have to be  taught to build its nest or to fly, nor the beaver to build its dam or  its house, nor the otter or the seal to swim, nor the young of mammals  to suckle, nor the spider to spin its web, nor the grub to weave its  cocoon. Nature does not trust these things to chance; they are too  vital. The things that an animal acquires by imitation are of  secondary importance in its life. As soon as the calf, or the lamb, or  the colt can get upon its feet, its first impulse is to find the udder  of its dam. It requires no instruction or experience to take this  important step.    How far the different species of song-birds acquire each their  peculiar songs by imitation is a question that has not yet been fully  settled. That imitation has much to do with it admits of little doubt.  The song of a bird is of secondary importance in its life. Birds  reared in captivity, where they have never heard the songs of their  kind, sing at the proper age, but not always the songs of their  parents. Mr. Scott of Princeton proved this with his orioles. They  sang at the proper age, but not the regular oriole song. I am told  that there is a well-authenticated case of an English sparrow brought  up with canaries that learned to sing like a canary. \"The Hon. Daines  Barrington placed three young linnets with three different  foster-parents, the skylark, the woodlark, and the titlark or  meadow-pipit, and each adopted, through imitation, the song of its  foster-parent.\" I have myself heard goldfinches"]]]
