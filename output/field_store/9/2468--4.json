ARTS AMONG THE AZTECS AND INDIANS.    WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE    BY THOMAS EWBANK    _United States Commissioner of Patents, author of \"Treatise on Hydraulics\",  &c._      To the antiquary and student of ethnology on this continent there are few  subjects more interesting than those early industrial arts, which, better  than any thing else, illustrate the civilization of the Aztecs, and their  rude neighbors, the aborigines of the more northern parts of the country.  An attempt is made in the following pages to define, in certain respects,  the extent, and justly to represent the character, of those efforts, made  before the Discovery, and repeated, with more or less uniformity, by  portions of the American races until the present time. I have copied from  the great work of Lord Kingsborough on Mexican Antiquities, four uncouth  figures, of which the originals are native drawings sent to Spain by  Antonio de Mendoza, the successor of Cortes, and first viceroy of New  Spain. It will be confessed that few things could give us a more correct  impression of the condition and character of the peoples subdued by Cortes  and Pizarro than we may derive from these pictures.    [Illustration: Aztec Goldsmith at work. From Mendoza's Collection.]    In this drawing the artist has represented a workman in the act of  soldering or annealing a piece of plate. Except the rude style in which the  native limners portrayed the human figure, the cut is a fac-simile of  Pharaonic profiles of the same class of workmen, and of modern goldsmiths  of Africa, Hindustan, Java, Sumatra, Ceylon, and Asia generally. The small  portable furnace, the blowpipe, the position of the operator, the  scantiness of his apparel, and the absence of any bench, are common to all;  the only observable difference is in the apron (suspended by long  shoulder-straps) of the American, who, in this respect, seems to have  advanced beyond his brethren of the other hemisphere. Had the draughtsman  possessed the skill of a modern artist, and painted the tools and processes  used, in fusing the metal, in spreading it out into plates, working it into  shape, and chasing in the ornaments, in drawing wire, and fabricating the  famous old Panama chains, &c., many other problems of Aztec economy and art  would have been solved. The smiths of Mexico, Central America, and Peru,  were expert in the use of the blowpipe; and this is not to be wondered at,  if, as early Spanish writers report, the bellows was unknown among them. In  specimens of their industry which are extant the soldering rivals any thing  executed in modern workshops, and seams often challenge and sometimes defy  the keenest scrutiny to detect them. Native smiths still use the pipe.    Every enlightened worker in metals must feel interested in thus beholding  an ancient red man in the actual use of the blowpipe, to say nothing of the  illustration the figure affords of the state of the arts in ante-Columbian  epochs, and of ancient life in this part of the world. The use of the  blowpipe has been inferred from metalline remains discovered in sepulchral  tumuli of the Mississippi valley. In Caleb Atwater's _Antiquities of the  West_, (Columbus, 1833, pages 92-3,) mention is made of sixty copper beads,  found in one of the mounds at Grave Creek, near Wheeling. \"They were made  of a coarse wire, which appeared to have been hammered out, not drawn, and  were cut off at unequal lengths; _they were soldered together_ in an  awkward manner, the centres of some of them uniting with the edges of  others; they were incrusted with verdigris, but the inside of them was pure  copper; which fact shows that the ancient inhabitants were not wholly  unacquainted with the use of metals.\" As it is admitted that _brass_ was  not known to the mound-builders, an analysis of the alloy that constituted  the brazen solder here alluded to would be a positive addition to the  little knowledge we have gleaned of these early native workers and of their  arts.    No matter how far man is separated from his fellows, either on the earth's  surface or by time, the general uniformity of his nature is stamped on all  his normal devices. Primitive inventions are universally similar. Under  agreeing circumstances and conditions, the same means are hit upon to  produce the same ends. Kindred trains of thought, of resources and results,  characterize the origin and early progress of the arts every where. They  begin in the same wants, and suggest the same ideas, which are carried out  in substantially the same ways. Still, when a primitive people is found  shut from communion with others--isolated from the rest of the world and  deriving no suggestions from it--some shades of difference, more or less  strongly defined, often mark means they discover, in common with others,  and this whether occupiers of small islands or of widespread continents.  But after all, this is only what may be called a variety of _expression_,  the same general idea being differently brought out, just as in speech the  same thoughts are displayed in various idioms. All arts and all machines  are but dialects of one language--reasonings and conclusions in tangible  forms and figures--a universal speech, understood by all men.    Of the diverse exhibitions of a primitive and common suggestion, a more  interesting example cannot well be adduced than the processes for the  fabrication of thread, which have been disclosed on this half of the globe.  They appear so different from others, and so remarkable, if not unique,  that it may safely be said, if the first spinsters were foreigners, their  mode of spinning was indigenous, however difficult, if not impossible, it  may be to reconcile one suggestion with the other.    Spinning lies at the threshold of human culture. It was the first or among  the first born of the arts, and was doubtless the offspring of woman's  ingenuity. Through all the past ages it was within the peculiar province of  the sex. In it queens and even goddesses sought to excel; one of the  earliest of useful efforts, it was one of the best; till it was introduced,  man was a houseless wanderer, and where it is unknown, he is still a  vagabond, roaming the forest. Home and its softening and soothing  influences had no existence, till woman began to twirl the spindle. Till  then the fount of the arts was unopened, unthought of, undreamt of. A  universal acquirement, it is one in which little variation in details could  be looked for among uncultivated tribes. It is, however, singular, that the  thread-making idea has been less skilfully developed by the red race than  perhaps any other of their mechanical conceptions. This is a striking fact,  in peoples so far advanced as were the Mexicans, Peruvians, and others.    The distaff has been identified with spinning in the eastern world from the  earliest times. It dates far behind historic and was a common thing in  heroic epochs. It pervades the most ancient legends, and plays a part in  the remotest myths. No other instrument of domestic economy is seen through  the semi-historic clouds that are about the infancy of human progress; few  others could be named as belonging to lower strata of time. Common in the  other hemisphere through unknown periods, it was utterly a stranger in  this.    Of the offices assigned to the fates, that of Clotho was to hold the  distaff, while Lachesis twirled the spindle, and Atropos determined the  length of the thread. Then there was Hercules, who was playfully rapped  over the head by Omphale, for his awkwardness in this service.  Sardanapalus, too, endeavored to rival the son of Jupiter, by spinning  among his maids. Ancient Egyptian spindles and distaffs have been recovered  from the tombs; and how common they both were among the Hebrews appears in  Solomon's portrait of a virtuous woman: \"She seeketh wool and flax--she  layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.\" Both  spindle and distaff were frequently dedicated to Minerva, the patroness of  spinning and of the arts connected with it. The goddess was herself rudely  sculptured with them in the Trojan Palladium.    A glance at these classic implements, before introducing the primitive  American apparatus, will better enable us to perceive the differences  existing between them, more correctly to appreciate both, and to judge how  far one is allied to or could have been derived from the other.    [Illustration: Distaff and Spindle--Ancient Greek and Roman.]    This figure is from a series of bas-reliefs representing the arts of  Minerva, upon a frieze of the Forum Palladium at Rome. It exhibits the  process of spinning, at the moment when the spinner has drawn out a  sufficient length of thread from the distaff, and just previous to the act  of taking it out of the slit on the top of the spindle, to wind it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3657"],[0,"Wild Beasts and Their Ways, Reminiscences of Europe, Asia, Africa and America — (#10)"],[1," meantime Moota Gutche  coolly advanced at a moderate pace. The shock of the encounter was  tremendous. The spear flew out of the rider's hands with the collision,  but Moota Gutche was a trained fighter, and having lowered his head,  which had for the moment exposed his mahout, he quickly caught his  opponent under the throat with its neck between his tusks, and then  bearing upwards, he forced the head of his adversary high in the air;  now driving forwards with all his strength, he hurled the other  backwards, and with a dexterous twist he threw it upon its side and  pinned it to the ground. In an instant Mr. Sanderson slipped off and  secured the hind legs with a strong rope. The two females quickly  arrived, and within a few minutes the late terror of the neighbourhood  was helplessly fettered, and was led captive between the females towards  the camp from which it had escaped, assisted, when obstreperous, by the  tusks of Moota Gutche applied behind.    This elephant completely recovered from its temporary madness, and  became a useful animal, affording a striking example of the passing  insanity of the male passion, and the power of careful management in  subduing a brute of such stupendous force.    After this incident Moota Gutche, with about forty of the keddah  elephants, was kindly lent to me by Mr. Sanderson during a shooting  excursion of twenty-five days upon the \"churs\" or islands of the  Brahmaputra river south of Dhubri. In India the tiger is so commonly  associated with the elephant that in describing one it is impossible to  avoid a connection with the other.    Moota Gutche was a peculiar character, not altogether amiable, but it  was as well to have him upon your own side. During the trip my friend  Sanderson was ill with fever, and could not accompany me. I was  therefore at the disadvantage of being the only gun in a long line of  elephants, which would on ordinary occasions have been manned by at  least four guns. At first I imagined that my trip would be a failure, as  I knew a mere nothing of the language, and the elephants and their  mahouts were alike strangers to me, but I soon discovered that their  excellent training as keddah servants constantly employed in the capture  of wild elephants under their indefatigable superintendent, Mr.  Sanderson, rendered them capable almost instinctively of understanding  all my ways, and we became excellent friends, both man and beast.    I arranged my long line of elephants according to their paces and  dispositions, and each day they preserved the same positions, so that  every mahout knew his place, and the elephants were accustomed to the  animals upon the right and left. In the centre were the slowest, and  upon either flank were the fastest elephants, while two exceedingly  speedy animals, with intelligent mahouts, invariably acted as scouts,  generally a quarter of a mile ahead on either flank.    My own elephant was accompanied on one side by Moota Gutche, on the  other by a rough but dependable character whose name I have forgotten. I  kept these always with me, as they were useful in the event of a tiger  that would not bolt from the dense wild-rose thickets, in which case our  three elephants could push him out.    This arrangement was perfect, and after a few days' experience our line  worked with the precision of well-drilled cavalry; sometimes, with extra  elephants, I had as many as fifty in the field. The result of this  discipline was that no tiger or leopard ever escaped if once on foot;  although hunted in some instances for hours, the animal was invariably  killed. A remarkable instance of this occurred at the large island of  Bargh Chur, which includes several thousand acres, the greater portion  being covered with enormous grass and dense thickets of tamarisk, which,  in the hot season, is the cool and loved resort of tigers. There were  also extensive jungles in swampy portions of the island, so intermixed  with reeds and marsh grass of twelve or fourteen feet high, that it was  difficult to penetrate, even upon an elephant.    I was out at the usual early hour, shortly after sunrise, the shikaris  having returned to camp with the news that none of the bullocks tied up  for baits during the preceding night had been killed; it therefore  remained to try our fortune by simply beating the high grass jungle in  line, on speculation, and in the same manner to drive the occasional  dense coverts of feathery tamarisk.    We had proceeded with a line of about five-and-thirty elephants, well  extended ten yards apart, and in this manner we had advanced about a  mile, when our attention was attracted by a native calling to us from a  large ant-hill which enabled him to be distinguished above the grass. We  immediately rode towards him, and were informed that a tiger had killed  his cow the night before, and had dragged the body into jungle so dense  that he had been afraid to follow. This was good news; we therefore took  the man upon an elephant as our guide towards the reported spot.    The elephants continued to advance in line, occasionally disturbing wild  pigs and hog deer, which existed in great numbers, but could hardly have  been shot even had I wished, as the grass was so thick and long that the  animals could not be seen; there were only signs of their disturbance by  the sudden rush and the waving of the grass just in front of the  advancing elephants, who were thus kept in continual excitement.    In about twenty minutes we emerged from the high grass upon a great  extent of highly cultivated land, where the sandy loam had been reduced  to the fine surface of a well-kept garden. Bordering upon this open  country was an extensive jungle composed of trees averaging about a foot  in diameter, but completely wedged together among impenetrable reeds  fully eighteen feet in length, and nearly an inch in thickness, in  addition to a network of various tough creepers, resulting from a rich  soil that was a morass during the rainy season. Although the reeds  appeared tolerably dry, they would not burn, as there were signs among  some half-scorched places where attempts had been recently made to fire  the jungle.    Our guide soon pointed to the spot where his cow had been dragged by the  tiger into this formidable covert. There was no mistake about the marks,  and the immense tracks in the soft ground proved the size and sex of the  destroyer.    Nobody questioned the fact of the tiger being at home, and the only  question was \"how to beat him out.\" The jungle was quite a mile in  length without a break in its terrible density; it was about half a mile  in width, bounded upon one side by the cleared level ground in  cultivation, and on the other by the high grass jungle we had left, but  this had been partially scorched along the edge in the attempts to burn.    A good look-out would have spied any animal at a hundred and fifty yards  had it attempted to leave the jungle.    As the country was a dead level, it was difficult to forecast the  retreat of a tiger when driven from such a thicket, and it was a serious  question whether it would be possible to dislodge him.    Whenever you commence a drive, the first consideration should be, \"If  the animal is there, where did it come from?\"---as it will in all  probability attempt to retreat to that same locality. There was no  possibility of guessing the truth in such a country of dense grass, and  with numerous islands of the same character throughout this portion of  the Brahmaputra, but there was one advantage in the fact that one side  was secure, as the tiger would never break covert upon the cultivated  land; there remained the opposite side, which would require strict  watching, as he would probably endeavour to slink away through the high  grass to some distant and favourite retreat.    I therefore determined to take my stand at the end of the thick jungle  which we had passed upon arrival, at the corner where it joined the  parched grass that had been fire-scorched, and near the spot where the  cow had been dragged in. I accordingly sent the elephants round to  commence the drive about two hundred yards distant, entering from the  cultivated side and driving towards me, as I concluded the tiger in such  massive jungle would not be far from the dead body. At the same time, I  sent two scouting elephants to occupy positions outside the jungle on  the high grass side, within sight of myself; I being posted on my  elephant at the corner, so that I commanded two views---the end, and the  grass side.    My signal, a loud whistle, having been given, the line of elephants  advanced towards my position. The crashing of so many huge beasts  through the dense crisp herbage sounded in the distance like a strong  wind, varied now and then by the tearing crunch as some opposing  branches were torn down to clear the way.    I was mounted upon a female elephant, a good creature named Nielmonne,  who was reputed to be staunch, but as the line of beaters approached  nearer, and the varied sounds increased in intensity, she became very  nervous and restless, starting should a small deer dart out of the  jungle, and evidently expecting momentarily the appearance of the enemy.  There are very few elephants that will remain unmoved when awaiting the  advance of a line of beaters, whether they may be of their own species  or human beings. On this occasion the rushing sound of the yielding  jungle, which was so thick as to test the elephants' powers in clearing  a passage through it, was presently varied by a sharp trumpet, then by a  low growl, followed by that peculiar noise emitted by elephants when  excited, resembling blows upon a tambourine or kettle-drum. This is a  sound that invariably is heard whenever an elephant detects the fresh  scent of a tiger; and Nielmonne, instead of standing quiet, became  doubly excited, as she evidently understood that the dreaded game was on  foot, and"]]]
