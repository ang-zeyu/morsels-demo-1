The latter, though he takes a share in the     conversation, does not say much. 'Le Souper de Beaucaire' is given     at full length in the French edition of these Memoirs, tome i. pp.     319-347; and by Iung, tome ii. p. 354, with the following remarks:     \"The first edition of 'Le Souper de Beaucaire' was issued at the     cost of the Public Treasury, in August 1798. Sabin Tournal, its     editor, also then edited the 'Courrier d'Avignon'. The second     edition only appeared twenty-eight years afterwards, in 1821,     preceded by an introduction by Frederick Royou (Paris: Brasseur     Aine, printer, Terrey, publisher, in octavo). This pamphlet did not     make any sensation at the time it appeared. It was only when     Napoleon became Commandant of the Army of Italy that M. Loubet,     secretary and corrector of the press for M. Tournal, attached some     value to the manuscript, and showed it to several persona. Louis     Bonaparte, later, ordered several copies from M. Aurel. The     pamphlet, dated 29th duly 1793, is in the form of a dialogue between     an officer of the army, a citizen of Nismes, a manufacturer of     Montpellier, and a citizen of Marseilles. Marseilles was then in a     state of insurrection against the Convention. Its forces had seized     Avignon, but had been driven out by the army of Cartesna, which was     about to attack Marseilles itself.\" In the dialogue the officer     gives most excellent military advice to the representative of     Marseilles on the impossibility of their resisting the old soldiers     of Carteaux. The Marseilles citizen argues but feebly, and is     alarmed at the officer's representations; while his threat to call     in the Spaniards turns the other speakers against him. Even Colonel     Iung says, tome ii. p. 372, \"In these concise judgments is felt the     decision of the master and of the man of war..... These marvellous     qualities consequently struck the members of the Convention, who     made much of Bonaparte, authorised him to have it published at the     public expense, and made him many promises.\" Lanfrey, vol. i. pp.     201, says of this pamphlets \"Common enough ideas, expressed in a     style only remarkable for its 'Italianisms,' but becoming singularly     firm and precise every time the author expresses his military views.     Under an apparent roughness, we find in it a rare circumspection,     leaving no hold on the writer, even if events change.\"]--    It may be remarked, that in all that has come to us from St. Helena, not  a word is said of this youthful production. Its character sufficiently  explains this silence. In all Bonaparte's writings posterity will  probably trace the profound politician rather than the enthusiastic  revolutionist.    Some documents relative to Bonaparte's suspension and arrest, by order  of the representatives Albitte and Salicetti, serve to place in their  true light circumstances which have hitherto been misrepresented. I  shall enter into some details of this event, because I have seen it  stated that this circumstance of Bonaparte's life has been perverted and  misrepresented by every person who has hitherto written about him;  and the writer who makes this remark, himself describes the affair  incorrectly and vaguely. Others have attributed Bonaparte's misfortune  to a military discussion on war, and his connection with Robespierre the  younger.         --[It will presently be seen that all this is erroneous, and that     Sir Walter commits another mistake when he says that Bonaparte's     connection with Robespierre was attended with fatal consequences to     him, and that his justification consisted in acknowledging that his     friends were very different from what he had supposed them to be.     --Bourrienne.]--    It has, moreover, been said that Albitte and Salicetti explained to  the Committee of Public Safety the impossibility of their resuming the  military operations unaided by the talents of General Bonaparte. This is  mere flattery. The facts are these:    On the 13th of July 1794 (25th Messidor, year II), the representatives  of the people with the army of Italy ordered that General Bonaparte  should proceed to Genoa, there, conjointly with the French 'charge  d'affaires', to confer on certain subjects with the Genoese Government.  This mission, together with a list of secret instructions, directing him  to examine the fortresses of Genoa and the neighbouring country, show  the confidence which Bonaparte, who was then only twenty-five, inspired  in men who were deeply interested in making a prudent choice of their  agents.    Bonaparte set off for Genoa, and fulfilled his mission. The 9th  Thermidor arrived, and the deputies, called Terrorists, were superseded  by Albitte and Salicetti. In the disorder which then prevailed they were  either ignorant of the orders given to General Bonaparte, or persons  envious of the rising glory of the young general of artillery inspired  Albitte and Salicetti with suspicions prejudicial to him. Be this as it  may, the two representatives drew up a resolution, ordering that General  Bonaparte should be arrested, suspended from his rank, and arraigned  before the Committee of Public Safety; and, extraordinary as it may  appear, this resolution was founded in that very journey to Genoa  which Bonaparte executed by the direction of the representatives of the  people.         --[Madame Junot throws some light on this Persecution of Bonaparte     by Salicetti. \"One motive (I do not mean to say the only one),\"     remarks this lady, \"of the animosity shown by Salicetti to     Bonaparte, in the affair of Loano, was that they were at one time     suitors to the same lady. I am not sure whether it was in Corsica     or in Paris, but I know for a fact that Bonaparte, in spite of his     youth, or perhaps I should rather say on account of his youth, was     the favoured lover. It was the opinion of my brother, who was     secretary to Salicetti, that Bonaparte owed his life to a     circumstance which is not very well known. The fact is, that     Salicetti received a letter from Bonaparte, the contents of which     appeared to make a deep impression on him. Bonaparte's papers had     been delivered into Salicetti's hands, who, after an attentive     perusal of them, laid them aside with evident dissatisfaction. He     then took them up again, and read them a second time. Salicetti     declined my brother's assistance is the examination of the papers,     and after a second examination, which was probably as unsatisfactory     as the first, he seated himself with a very abstracted air. It     would appear that he had seen among the papers some document which     concerned himself. Another curious fact is, that the man who had     the care of the papers after they were sealed up was an inferior     clerk entirely under the control of Salicetti; and my brother, whose     business it was to have charge of the papers, was directed not to     touch them. He has often spoken to me of this circumstance, and I     mention it here as one of importance to the history of the time.     Nothing that relates to a man like Napoleon can be considered     useless or trivial.       \"What, after all, was the result of this strange business which     might have cost Bonaparte his head?--for, had he been taken to Paris     and tried by the Committee of Public Safety, there is little doubt     that the friend of Robespierre the younger would have been condemned     by Billaud-Varennes and Collot d'Herbois. The result was the     acquittal of the accused. This result is the more extraordinary,     since it would appear that at that time Salicetti stood in fear of     the young general. A compliment is even paid to Bonaparte in the     decree, by which he was provisionally restored to liberty. That     liberation was said to be granted on the consideration that General     Bonaparte might be useful to the Republic. This was foresight; but     subsequently when measures were taken which rendered Bonaparte no     longer an object of fear, his name was erased from the list of     general officers, and it is a curious fact that Cambacérès, who was     destined to be his colleague in the Consulate, was one of the     persons who signed the act of erasure\" (Memoirs of the Duchesse     d'Abrantes, vol. i, p. 69, edit. 1843).]--    Bonaparte said at St. Helena that he was a short time imprisoned by  order of the representative Laporte; but the order for his arrest was  signed by Albitte, Salicetti, and Laporte.         --[Albitte and Laporte were the representatives sent from the     Convention to the army of the Alps, and Salicetti to the army of     Italy.]--    Laporte was not probably the most influential of the three, for  Bonaparte did not address his remonstrance to him. He was a fortnight  under arrest.    Had the circumstance occurred three weeks earlier, and had Bonaparte  been arraigned before the Committee of Public Safety previous to the 9th  Thermidor, there is every probability that his career would have been  at an end; and we should have seen perish on the scaffold, at the age of  twenty-five, the man who, during the twenty-five succeeding years, was  destined to astonish the world by his vast conceptions, his gigantic  projects, his great military genius, his extraordinary good fortune, his  faults, reverses, and final misfortunes.    It is worth while to remark that in the post-Thermidorian resolution  just alluded to no mention is made of Bonaparte's association with  Robespierre the younger. The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35744"],[0,"The gradual acceptance of the Copernican theory of the universe (#10)"],[1," others are said to be either violent or voluntary.       Therefore, since he claims the earth is agitated by four       motions, one only can be its own, the others must be       confessedly violent; yet nothing violent in nature can       endure continuously. Furthermore the earth is not moved by       water, much less by the motion of air or fire in the way we       have stated the heavens are moved by the revolutions of the       enveloping heavens. Copernicus further does not claim that       all the heavens are immobile but that some are moved, that       is, the moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. But       why such diversity? No one in his senses, or imbued with the       slightest knowledge of physics, will ever think that the       earth, heavy and unwieldy from its own weight and mass,       staggers up and down around its own center and that of the       sun; for at the slightest jar of the earth, we would see       cities and fortresses, towns and mountains thrown down. A       certain courtier Aulicus, when some astrologer in court was       upholding Copernicus's idea before Duke Albert of Prussia,       turning to the servant who was pouring the Falernian, said:       \"Take care that the flagon is not spilled.\"[201] For if the       earth were to be moved, neither an arrow shot straight up,       nor a stone dropped from the top of a tower would fall       perpendicularly, but either ahead or behind. With this       argument Ptolemy refuted Eudoxus. But if we search into the       secrets of the Hebrews and penetrate their sacred       sanctuaries, all these arguments can easily be confirmed;       for when the Lord of Wisdom said the sun swept in its swift       course from the eastern shore to the west, he added this:       Terra vero stat aeternam. Lastly, all things on finding       places suitable to their natures, remain there, as Aristotle       writes. Since therefore the earth has been alloted a place       fitting its nature, it cannot be whirled around by other       motion than its own.         \"THE.: I certainly agree to all the rest with you, but       Aristotle's law I think involves a paralogism, for by this       argument the heavens should be immobile since they are in a       place fitting their nature.         \"MYS.: You argue subtly indeed, but in truth this argument       does not seem necessary to me; for what Aristotle admitted,       that, while forsooth all the parts of the firmament changed       their places, the firmament as a whole did not, is       exceedingly absurd. For either the whole heaven is at rest       or the whole heaven is moved. The senses themselves disprove       that it is at rest; therefore it is moved. For it does not       follow that if a body is not moved away from its place, it       is not moved in that place. Furthermore, since we have the       most certain proof of the movement of trepidation, not only       all the parts of the firmament, but also the eight spheres,       must necessarily leave their places and move up and down,       forward and back.\"[202]    [Footnote 198: Montaigne: _Essays_: Bk. II, c. 2: _An Apologie of  Raymonde Sebonde_ (II, 352).]    [Footnote 199: This book, published at Frankfort in 1597, was  translated into French by M. Fougerolles and printed in Lyons that  same year. It has become extremely rare since its \"atheistic  atmosphere\" (Peignot: _Dictionnaire_) caused the Roman Church to place  it upon the Index by decree of 1628, where it has remained to this  day.]    [Footnote 200: Cromer in History of Poland.]    [Footnote 201: Cromer in History of Poland.[A]]    [Footnote A: I could not find this reference in either of Martin  Kromer's books; _De Origine et Rebus Gestis Polonorum, ad 1511_, or in  his _Res Publicae sive Status Regni Poloniae_.]    [Footnote 202: Bodin: _Univ. Nat. Theatrum_: Bk. V, sec. 2 (end).]    This was the opinion of a profound thinker and experienced man of  affairs living when Tycho Brahe and Bruno were still alive and Kepler  and Galileo were beginning their astronomical investigations. But he  was not alone in his views, as we shall see; for at the close of the  sixteenth century, the Copernican doctrine had few avowed supporters.  The Roman Church was still indifferent; the Protestants clinging to  the literal interpretation of the Bible were openly antagonistic; the  professors as a whole were too Aristotelian to accept or pay much  attention to this novelty, except Kepler and his teacher Maestlin  (though the latter refused to uphold it in his textbook);[203] while  astronomers and mathematicians who realized the insuperable objections  to the Ptolemaic conception, welcomed the Tychonic system as a _via  media_; and the common folk, if they heard of it at all, must have  ridiculed it because it was so plainly opposed to what they saw in the  heavens every day. In the same way their intellectual superiors  exclaimed at the \"delirium\" of those supporting such a notion.[204]  One thinker, however was to see far more in the doctrine than  Copernicus himself had conceived, and by Giordano Bruno the Roman  Church was to be aroused.    [Footnote 203: Delambre: _Astr. Mod._: I, 663.]    [Footnote 204: Justus-Lipsius: _Physiologiae Stoicorum_: Bk. II,  dissert. 19 (Dedication 1604, Louvain), (IV, 947); \"Vides deliria,  quomodo aliter appellent?\"]          CHAPTER II.    BRUNO AND GALILEO.      When the Roman Catholic authorities awoke to the dangers of the new  teaching, they struck with force. The first to suffer was the famous  monk-philosopher, Giordano Bruno, whose trial by the Holy Office was  premonitory of trouble to come for Galileo.[205]    [Footnote 205: Berti: 285.]    After an elementary education at Naples near his birth-place,  Nola,[206] Filippo Bruno[207] entered the Dominican monastery in 1562  or 1563 when about fourteen years old, assuming the name Giordano at  that time. Before 1572, when he entered the priesthood, he had fully  accepted the Copernican theory which later became the basis of all his  philosophical thought. Bruno soon showed he was not made for the  monastic life. Various processes were started against him, and fleeing  to Rome he abandoned his monk's garments and entered upon the sixteen  years of wandering over Europe, a peripatetic teacher of the  philosophy of an infinite universe as deduced from the Copernican  doctrine and thus in a way its herald.[208] He reached Geneva in 1579  (where he did not accept Calvinism as was formerly thought),[209] but  decided before many months had passed that it was wise to depart  elsewhere because of the unpleasant position in which he found himself  there. He had been brought before the Council for printing invectives  against one of the professors, pointing out some twenty of his  errors. The Council sent him to the Consistory, the governing body of  the church, where a formal sentence of excommunication was passed  against him. When he apologized it was withdrawn. Probably a certain  stigma remained, and he left Geneva soon thereafter with a warm  dislike for Calvinism. After lecturing at the University of Toulouse  he appeared in Paris in 1581, where he held an extraordinary  readership. Two years later he was in England, for he lectured at  Oxford during the spring months and defended the Copernican theory  before the Polish prince Alasco during the latter's visit there in  June.[210]    [Footnote 206: McIntyre: 3-15.]    [Footnote 207: Four lives of Bruno have been written within the last  seventy-five years. The first is _Jordano Bruno_ by Christian  Bartholmess (2 vol., Paris 1846). The next, _Vita di Giordano Bruno da  Nola_ by Domenico Berti (1868, Turin), quotes in full the official  documents of his trial. Frith's _Life of Giordano Bruno_ (London,  1887), has been rendered out of date by J.L. McIntyre's _Giordano  Bruno_ (London, 1903), which includes a critical bibliography. In  addition, W.R. Thayer's _Throne Makers_ (New York, 1899), gives  translations of Bruno's confessions to the Venetian Inquisition.  Bruno's Latin works (_Opera Latina Conscripta_), have been republished  by Fiorentino (3 vol., Naples, 1879), and the _Opere Italiane_ by  Gentile (3 vol., Naples, 1907).]    [Footnote 208: Bartholmess: I, 134.]    [Footnote 209: Libri: IV, 144.]    [Footnote 210: McIntyre: 16-40.]    To Bruno belongs the glory of the first public proclamation in England  of the new doctrine,[211] though only Gilbert[212] and possibly Wright  seem to have accepted it at the time. Upon Bruno's return to London,  he entered the home of the French ambassador as a kind of secretary,  and there spent the happiest years of his life till the ambassador's  recall in October, 1585. It was during this period that he wrote some  of his most famous books. In _La Cena de la Ceneri_ he defended the  Copernican theory, incidentally criticising the Oxford dons most  severely,[213] for which he apologized in _De la Causa, Principio et  Uno_. He developed his philosophy of an infinite universe in _De  l'Infinito e Mondi_, and in the _Spaccio de la Bestia Trionphante_  \"attacked all religions of mere credulity as opposed to religions of  truth and deeds.\"[214] This last book was at once thought to be a  biting attack upon the Roman Church and later became one of the  grounds of the Inquisition's charges against him. During this time in  London also, he came to know Sir Philip Sydney intimately, and Fulk  Greville as well as others of that brilliant period. He may have known  Bacon;[215] but it is highly improbable that he and Shakespeare  met,[216] or that Shakespeare ever was influenced by the other's  philosophy.[217]    [Footnote 211: Bartholmess: I, 134.]    [Footnote 212: Gilbert: _De Magnete_ (London, 1600).]    [Footnote 213: Berti: 369, Doc.
