Then I turned and fled    If it was I indeed that feared and fled    Down the long glades, and through the tangled brakes,    Where scarce the sunlight pierced; fled on and on,    And panted, self-pursued.  But evermore    The dissonant music which I knew so sweet,    When by the windy hills, the echoing vales    And whispering pines it rang; now far, now near    As from my rushing steed I leant and cheered    With voice and horn the chase; this brought to me    Fear of I knew not what, which bade me fly,    Fly always, fly; but when my heart stood still,    And all my limbs were stiffened as I fled,    Just as the white moon ghost-like climbed the sky,    Nearer they came and nearer, baying loud,    With bloodshot eyes and red jaws dripping foam;    And when I strove to check their savagery,    Speaking with words; no voice articulate came,    Only a dumb, low bleat.  Then all the throng    Leapt swift upon me and tore me as I lay,    And left me man again.\"    In Shelley's poem Adonais is the following allusion to the story  of Actaeon:--      \"Midst others of less note came one frail form,    A phantom among men; companionless    As the last cloud of an expiring storm,    Whose thunder is its knell; he, as I guess,    Had gazed on Nature's naked loveliness,    Actaeon-like, and now he fled astray    With feeble steps o'er the world's wilderness;    And his own Thoughts, along that rugged way,    Pursued like raging hounds their father and their prey.\"    Adonais, stanza 31.    The allusion is probably to Shelley himself.        LATONA AND THE RUSTICS    Some thought the goddess in this instance more severe than was  just, while others praised her conduct as strictly consistent  with her virgin dignity.  As usual, the recent event brought  older ones to mind, and one of the bystanders told this story.  \"Some countrymen of Lycia once insulted the goddess Latona, but  not with impunity.  When I was young, my father, who had grown  too old for active labors, sent me to Lycia to drive thence some  choice oxen, and there I saw the very pond and marsh where the  wonder happened.  Near by stood an ancient altar, black with the  smoke of sacrifice and almost buried among the reeds.  I inquired  whose altar it might be, whether of Faunus or the Naiads or some  god of the neighboring mountain, and one of the country people  replied, 'No mountain or river god possesses this altar, but she  whom royal Juno in her jealousy drove from land to land, denying  her any spot of earth whereon to rear her twins.  Bearing in her  arms the infant deities, Latona reached this land, weary with her  burden and parched with thirst.  By chance she espied in the  bottom of the valley this pond of clear water, where the country  people were at work gathering willows and osiers.  The goddess  approached, and kneeling on the bank would have slaked her thirst  in the cool stream, but the rustics forbade her.  'Why do you  refuse me water?' said she; 'water is free to all.  Nature allows  no one to claim as property the sunshine, the air, or the water.  I come to take my share of the common blessing.  Yet I ask it of  you as a favor.  I have no intention of washing my limbs in it,  weary though they be, but only to quench my thirst.  My mouth is  so dry that I can hardly speak.  A draught of water would be  nectar to me; it would revive me, and I would own myself indebted  to you for life itself.  Let these infants move your pity, who  stretch out their little arms as if to plead for me'; and the  children, as it happened, were stretching out their arms.    \"Who would not have been moved with these gentle words of the  goddess?  But these clowns persisted in their rudeness; they even  added jeers and threats of violence if she did not leave the  place.  Nor was this all.  They waded into the pond and stirred  up the mud with their feet, so as to make the water unfit to  drink.  Latona was so angry that she ceased to feel her thirst.  She no longer supplicated the clowns, but lifting her hands to  heaven exclaimed, 'May they never quit that pool, but pass their  lives there!'  And it came to pass accordingly.  They now live in  the water, sometimes totally submerged, then raising their heads  above the surface, or swimming upon it.  Sometimes they come out  upon the bank, but soon leap back again into the water.  They  still use their base voices in railing, and though they have the  water all to themselves, are not ashamed to croak in the midst of  it.  Their voices are harsh, their throats bloated, their mouths  have become stretched by constant railing, their necks have  shrunk up and disappeared, and their heads are joined to their  bodies.  Their backs are green, their disproportioned bellies  white, and in short they are now frogs, and dwell in the slimy  pool.\"    This story explains the allusion in one of Milton's sonnets, \"On  the detraction which followed upon his writing certain  treatises.\"      \"I did but prompt the age to quit their clogs    By the known laws of ancient liberty,.    When straight a barbarous noise environs me    Of owls and cuckoos, asses, apes and dogs.    As when those hinds that were transformed to frogs    Railed at Latona's twin-born progeny,    Which after held the sun and moon in fee.\"    The persecution which Latona experienced from Juno is alluded to  in the story.  The tradition was that the future mother of Apollo  and Diana, flying from the wrath of Juno, besought all the  islands of the Aegean to afford her a place of rest, but all  feared too much the potent queen of heaven to assist her rival.  Delos alone consented to become the birthplace of the future  deities.  Delos was then a floating island; but when Latona  arrived there, Jupiter fastened it with adamantine chains to the  bottom of the sea, that it might be a secure resting place for  his beloved.  Byron alludes to Delos in his Don Juan:--      \"The isles of Greece!  The isles of Greece!    Where burning Sappho loved and sung,    Where grew the arts of war and peace,    Where Delos rose and Phoebus sprung!\"        PHAETON    Epaphus was the son of Jupiter and Io.  Phaeton, child of the  Sun, was one day boasting to him of his high descent and of his  father Phoebus.  Epaphus could not bear it.  \"Foolish fellow,\"  said he \"you believe your mother in all things, and you are  puffed up by your pride in a false father.\"  Phaeton went in rage  and shame and reported this to his mother, Clymene.  \"If,\" said  he, \"I am indeed of heavenly birth, give me, mother, some proof  of it, and establish my claim to the honor.\"  Clymene stretched  forth her hands towards the skies, and said, \"I call to witness  the Sun which looks down upon us, that I have told you the truth.  If I speak falsely, let this be the last time I behold his light.  But it needs not much labor to go and inquire for yourself; the  land whence the sun rises lies next to ours.  Go and demand of  him whether he will own you as a son\" Phaeton heard with delight.  He travelled to India, which lies directly in the regions of  sunrise; and, full of hope and pride, approached the goal whence  the Sun begins his course.    The palace of the Sun stood reared aloft on columns, glittering  with gold and precious stones, while polished ivory formed the  ceilings, and silver the doors.  The workmanship surpassed the  material; for upon the walls Vulcan had represented earth, sea  and skies, with their inhabitants.  In the sea were the nymphs,  some sporting in the waves, some riding on the backs of fishes,  while others sat upon the rocks and dried their sea-green hair.  Their faces were not all alike, nor yet unlike,   but such as  sisters' ought to be.  The earth had its towns and forests and  rivers and rustic divinities.  Over all was carved the likeness  of the glorious heaven; and on the silver doors the twelve signs  of the zodiac, six on each side.    Clymene's son advanced up the steep ascent, and entered the halls  of his disputed father.  He approached the paternal presence, but  stopped at a distance, for the light was more than he could bear.  Phoebus, arrayed in a purple vesture, sat on a throne which  glittered as with diamonds.  On his right hand and his left stood  the Day, the Month, and the Year, and, at regular intervals, the  Hours.  Spring stood with her head crowned with flowers, and  Summer, with garment cast aside, and a garland formed of spears  of ripened grain, and Autumn, with his feet stained with grape  juice, and icy Winter, with his hair stiffened with hoar frost.  Surrounded by these attendants, the Sun, with the eye that sees  every thing, beheld the youth dazzled with the novelty and  splendor of the scene, and inquired the purpose of his errand.  The youth replied, \"Oh, light of the boundless world, Phoebus, my  father,   if you permit me to use that name,   give me some  proof, I beseech you, by which I may be known as yours.\"  He  ceased; and his father, laying aside the beams that shone all  around his head, bade him approach, and embracing him, said, \"My  son, you deserve not to be disowned, and I confirm what your  mother has told you.  To put an end to your doubts, ask what you  will, the gift"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33407"],[0,"Bee and Butterfly: A Tale of Two Cousins (#10)"],[1,"my words also,\" said the scientist,  stirring uneasily. \"The letters first caused me to think of returning.\"    \"But you would not have come if you had not believed that the beautiful  picture was of your daughter,\" persisted Bee. \"I want the truth,  father.\"    \"I am accustomed to speaking nothing else,\" answered Doctor Raymond  sternly. \"All this is aside from the question.\"    \"Is it?\" asked the girl with some scorn. \"I think not; but you needn't  answer, father. Explain your treatment of me after you found out your  mistake. What effort have you made to find out what kind of a daughter  you have? You hardly come near me. You were away for years, and now that  you are home at last you are further from me than ever because I did  have your letters; now I have nothing. I may be as brilliant as a  diamond, or as simple as a daisy, but you don't care to take the trouble  to find out.\"    \"Well, I have been exceedingly busy,\" replied he lamely. \"And you have  not----You see--\" He did not wish to say that she had not presented a  very inviting side of her character to him. Beatrice did not know this,  so she did not wait for him to finish.    \"Yes, I see, father,\" she said wearily. She was beginning to feel very  tired. The reaction of the unusual emotion was having its effect. \"You  are just like everybody else. You talk of mind and disposition easily  enough, but you succumb to beauty at first sight. At school it was the  same. All of us were made to toe the mark except Adele. Nothing was ever  expected of her but to be beautiful. I did not care until you came, and  were disappointed in me. Then I tried protective mimicry, but it wasn't  successful.\"    Doctor Raymond glanced up quickly.    \"What do you know about protective mimicry?\" he asked.    \"It's where one animal puts on the form of another animal to protect  itself from enemies,\" answered Bee. \"I thought that if I could make  myself like Adele you would come to care for me.\"    \"And was that what caused you to bleach your hair, and change your  complexion?\"    \"Yes, father. You would not notice me, so I just had to do something.  And now it's no use.\"    \"I am not so sure about that.\" Doctor Raymond began to laugh. \"You have  worked upon the principle held by some great men, Beatrice. Henry Ward  Beecher used to say: 'If you can't make people love you, make them hate  you. Anything is better than indifference.'\"    \"Oh, father!\" cried the unhappy girl, bursting into tears. \"Have I made  you hate me?\"    \"Nonsense! Of course not. I only meant--\"    \"A gen'man to see you, sah,\" announced Aunt Fanny at this inopportune  moment, and the entomologist was obliged to leave the room.          Chapter VIII    A Rift in the Clouds                            \"Through the open door      A drowsy smell of flowers--gray heliotrope,      And sweet white clover, and shy mignonette--Comes      faintly in, and the silent chorus lends      To the pervading symphony of peace.\"        --_Among the Hills. Whittier._      Doctor Raymond's visitor proved to be a fellow naturalist who became so  interested in his host's rare specimens that he spent the entire day  examining them. Beatrice passed the time in her own room, loath to  subject herself to curious eyes.    Aunt Fanny came up after a time with a second lot of jimpson leaves  which she proceeded to make into a poultice despite the girl's  protestations.    \"Yer mus', honey,\" insisted the negress. \"I'se done been down ter Miss  Browne's, an' she say hit air de onliest thing ter do. She say hats  turn yaller 'fore deys bleached, an' hit's de same wid yer skin. Dis'll  be de las' time.\"    \"It doesn't matter now, Aunt Fanny,\" said Bee miserably. \"I was silly to  do anything, but I thought, I thought!--\"    \"Nebber min' what yer thunk, chile,\" consoled the old woman. \"Hit am  jest like a gal: allers a wantin' sumpin' like sum udder gal. Now jest  put on dis, an' you-all will kum out all right.\"    Beatrice was too tired to expostulate further, and submitted once more  to the martyrdom of the poultice with little care as to the result. Her  heart was too heavy to take any further interest in such efforts; for  she believed that she had completely alienated her father, and she cared  for nothing else. The day came to an end at last, and night brought  surcease of sorrow, for she slept.    As Aunt Fanny had predicted, she found that her complexion had indeed  bleached out to its natural color by the next morning. Cheered in spite  of herself by this fact she went down to breakfast with lighter heart.  Doctor Raymond's pleased look showed that he marked the improvement in  her appearance, but he made no comment. Neither did he refer to the  conversation of the day before until the close of the meal. Then he  said:    \"Beatrice, yesterday you said that I shut you out from me; that I did  not know you because I did not try to. I have not meant to be guilty of  such a thing, but there was enough of truth in your remarks to make me  feel that perhaps I have been somewhat negligent of you. You shall have  no further cause to accuse me of this; so, if you are willing, we will  drop all unpleasant things and make a new start. Part of each day I  shall be obliged to devote to my forthcoming book, and those hours I  must be alone. All the rest of the time, however, you may spend with  me.\"    \"Oh, father!\" cried Bee in surprise. \"Do you mean that I am really to be  with you? Even when you are in the study arranging your specimens?\"    \"Just that, Beatrice. We will learn to know each other, and it may be  that we shall find that companionship to which, it seems, we both looked  forward. There is but one thing that I would ask of you: don't try to  be like any one else. Let me see you as you are.\"    \"I can promise that easily,\" answered Beatrice cheerfully, her spirits  rising at the knowledge that she was in very truth to have his  companionship. \"I really don't want to be like any one else. I'd rather  be just myself. And I don't like this yellow hair. I didn't know that it  wasn't refined to bleach it. One of the girls at school did it, and  while the rest of us laughed about it, we thought it looked nice. I  would rather have my own colored hair even though it is dark; but this  won't last, father. Miss Harris said that it would have to be touched up  every once in a while. Of course the ends will always be yellow, but  just as soon as it grows long enough I'll cut it off, and have my own  dark locks again.\"    \"I am glad that it will not be permanent,\" remarked her father. \"Let us  say no more about it. It does not look so bad as it might, and the mere  fact that you did not bleach it through vanity makes me more tolerant of  it. Now, my child, I am going for a walk over the grounds, and would  like your company.\"    Beatrice ran joyfully for her hat.    \"He's giving me a chance,\" she whispered, scarcely able to control her  emotion. \"I am glad, glad! I won't think a thing about Adele. I won't  mind my looks a bit, but just be so good that maybe, maybe--\" She did  not finish her sentence, but squeezed her hands together rapturously.    \"I have been too busy since my return to go over the place,\" said the  naturalist as they set forth. \"Beginning with this morning we will go  over a portion of it daily until the entire place has been inspected.  Will it be too much of a walk for you to take the gardens and the  orchard today?\"    \"Why, no;\" answered Bee quickly. \"I am used to walking, father. We  always walked into town from Uncle Henry's, and to school too. Aunt  Annie thought it was good for us. Then I run about the fields quite a  little.\"    \"Annie has followed my idea exactly,\" he commented approvingly. \"There  is nothing so conducive to good health as outdoor exercise. Ah! here we  are at the gardens. They have been well kept; but, but--\" He glanced  around the mass of blossom and vines knitting his brows in perplexity.  \"The rose?\" he said. \"The one your mother planted. Can this be it?\"    He stopped beside a large moss rose bush as he spoke. It was of sturdy  growth, completely covered with buds and blossoms of satiny white deeply  embowered in a soft greenery of moss.    \"Yes; this is it, father,\" spoke Beatrice softly. \"Uncle Henry had it  tended carefully because he knew that you would wish it. Is it not  beautiful? I think I love it best of all the roses.\" She bent over a  cluster to inhale its fragrance as she finished speaking.    \"It has grown,\" he said musingly. \"It was so small. I should not have  known it. I did not think to find so large a bush.\"    \"You have been gone for years,\" she reminded him. \"Have you forgotten,  father? A small plant would have time to become a large shrub.\"    \"True;\" he said. \"True.\" He broke a half blown bud from the bush and  held it for a moment against his lips. \"It was her favorite rose,\" he  said, putting it in the buttonhole of his coat.    The gravity of his face softened into tenderness, and his eyes were  misty as he leaned over the rose bush. Bee gazed at him longingly. The  impulse of her heart was to go to him, slip her hand in his, or to  nestle against him caressingly. Had she done so father and daughter must  have drawn very close to each other, but something--perhaps delicacy,  perhaps shyness, perhaps a certain awe in which she held him--restrained  her. Presently he straightened up, turned away from the bush with a  sigh, and walked on. Beatrice followed him silently, and the golden  opportunity was gone.    \"I am hatching the larvae of the Thecla titus Fabricus from the eggs,\" he  said as they left the garden a little later, \"I wish to get the proper  plants for them to feed upon.\"    \"Then we must go to the woodland instead of the orchard,\" said Bee  quickly. \"You will need the leaves of the wild cherry, or the wild plum.  I believe that the caterpillars of the Coral Hair-Streaks feed upon  them.\"    \"How do you know?\" questioned her father in astonishment.    \"I "]]]
