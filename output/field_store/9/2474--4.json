Some internal ciliary  action, quite distinct from the hairs, and which has never been  precisely understood, caused gentle currents to flow towards the mouth  in the middle of the lobes, and from the motion of the gizzard,  imperfectly seen through the integument, and from the rapid filling of  the stomach with particles of all hues, it was plain that captivity had  not destroyed the Floscule's appetite, and that the drop of water in the  live-box contained a good supply of food.    Sometimes the particles swallowed were too small to be discerned,  although their aggregate effect was visible; but often a monad or larger  object was ingulfed, but without any ciliary action being visible to  account for the journey they were evidently compelled to perform. The  long hairs took no part whatever in the foraging process, and as they do  not either provide victuals or minister to locomotion, they are clearly  not, as was supposed by early observers, representatives of the  \"wheels,\" which the ordinary Rotifers present. Neither can the  cylindrical jar or bottle be justly deemed to occupy the position of the  lorica, or carapace which we have before described. The general  structure of the creature and the nature of its gizzard distinctly  marked it out as a member of the family we call \"Rotifers,\" but the  absence of anything like \"wheels\" proves that those organs are not  essential characteristics of this class.    Noticeable currents are not always produced when the mouth of this  Floscule is fully expanded. On one occasion, one having five lobes was  discovered standing at such an angle in a glass trough that the aperture  could be looked down into. The position rendered it impossible to use a  higher power than about two hundred linear, but with this, and the  employment of carmine, nothing like a vortex was seen during a whole  evening, although a less power was sufficient to show the ciliary  whirlpools made by small specimens of _Epistylis_ and _Vaginicola_,  which were in the small vessel. The density of the integument was  unfavorable to viewing the action of the gizzard, but it could be  indistinctly perceived. The contractions and subsequent expansions of  the cup, formed by the upper part of the creature, may be one way in  which its food is drawn in, but there is no doubt it can produce  currents when it thinks proper. Sometimes animalcules in the vicinity of  Floscules whirl about as if under the influence of such currents. Some  may be seen to enter the space between the lobes, swim about inside, and  then get out again, while every now and then one will be sucked in too  far for retreat.    Above the gizzard in the Horned Floscule,[10] I have seen an appearance  as if a membrane or curtain was waving to and fro, while another was  kept in a fixed perpendicular position. Mr. Gosse, speaking of this  genus, observes \"that the whole of the upper part of the body is lined  with a sensitive, contractile, partially opaque membrane, which a little  below the disk recedes from the walls of the body, and forms a  diaphragm, with a highly contractile and versatile central orifice. At  some distance lower down another diaphragm occurs, and the ample chamber  thus enclosed forms a kind of _crop_, or receptacle for the captured  prey.\"    [10] The Horned Floscules (_F. cornuta_) which I have found, and which  bred in a glass jar, were not so large as those described by Mr. Dobie,  as quoted in 'Pritchard's Infusoria.' Mr. Dobie's specimens were 1--40\"  when extended; mine about half that size, five-lobed, and with a long  slender proboscis, standing in a wavy line outside one lobe. Mr. Dobie  also describes an _F. campanulata_, with five flattened lobes. The  'Micrographic Dictionary' pronounces these two species \"doubtfully  distinct.\" I have three or four times met with a variety of _F. ornata_,  in which one lobe was much enlarged and flattened, but they had no  proboscis. In what I take for _F. cornuta_, the horn or proboscis has  sometimes been a conspicuous object, and at others so fine and  transparent as to be only visible in certain lights.    \"From the ventral side of the ample crop that precedes the stomach,  there springs in _F. ornata_ a perpendicular membrane or veil, partly  extending across the cavity. This is free, except at the vertical edge,  by which it is attached to the side of the chamber, and being ample and  of great delicacy, it continually floats and waves from side to side. At  the bottom of this _veil_, but on the dorsal side, are placed the jaws,  consisting of a pair of curved, unjointed, but free _mallei_, with a  membranous process beneath each.\"    The Beautiful Floscule could always be made to repeat the process of  retreating into her den, and coming out again to spread her elegant  plumes before our eyes, by giving the table a smart knock, and her  colours and structure were well exhibited by the dark-ground  illumination, which has been explained in a previous page.    An object like this should be watched at intervals for hours and even  days, especially if the eggs are nearly ready to give up their infantile  contents. This was the case with the specimen described, and after a few  hours a young Floscule escaped, looking very much like a clumsy little  grub. After a few awkward wriggles the new-born baby became more quiet,  and on looking at it again at the expiration of seventeen hours, it had  developed into the shape of a miniature plum-pudding, with five or six  tiny lobes expanding their tufts of slender hair. Unfortunately its  further proceedings were not seen, or it would have been interesting to  note the growth of the foot, and the formation of the gelatinous tube,  which is probably thrown off in rings.    To view the details of the structure of a Floscule, it must be placed in  a live-box or compressorium, and if specimens are scarce, they should  not be allowed to remain in the limited quantity of water those  contrivances hold, after the observations are concluded, but should be  carefully removed, and placed in a little vial, such as homoeopathists  use for their medicine. By such means an individual may be kept alive  for many days. It is also interesting to place a little branch of the  plant occupied by Floscules or similar creatures, in a glass trough,  where they may be made quite at home, and their proceedings agreeably  watched by a one-inch or two-thirds power. These troughs,[11] which can  be obtained of the optician, should be of plate glass, about three  inches long, nearly the same height, and about half an inch wide. If  narrower, or much taller, they will not stand, which is a great  inconvenience. The pieces of glass are stuck together with marine glue,  and a very simple contrivance enables the plants or other objects to be  pressed near the front, and thus brought into better view. A strip of  glass, rather narrower than the width of the trough, is dropped into it,  and allowed to fall to the bottom. Then a piece of glass rather shorter  than the trough, and rather higher than its front side, is placed so as  to slope from the front of the bottom towards the back at the top. The  piece of glass first dropped in keeps it in the right position, and the  trough is thus made into a V-shaped vessel, wide at the top and  gradually narrowing. Any object then placed in it will fall till it fits  some part of the V, where it will remain for observation. A small wedge  of cork enables the moveable piece of glass to be thrown forwards, until  it assumes any angle, or is brought parallel to the front of the trough.    [11] The shallow cells with thin sliding covers devised by Mr. Curteis  (of Baker's), are still more convenient when no pressure is required,  and the objects are small. When not under the microscope they can be  kept full of water by immersion in a tumbler.    A power of five or six hundred diameters generally enables a movement of  small globules to be seen at the extremity of the lobes of the Floscule,  and the gizzard may be made plain by dissolving the rest of the creature  in a drop of solution of caustic potash. It also becomes more visible as  the supply of food falls short. Mr. Gosse describes the body as \"lined  with a yellowish vascular membrane,\" and young specimens exhibit two red  eyes, which may or may not be found in adults. When these eyes of  Rotifers are not readily conspicuous, they must be sought for by opaque  illumination, or by the dark-ground method which, especially with the  parabola, is successful in bringing them out.    Naturalists, and possibly the specimens also, do not always agree in  the number of lobes assigned to the \"Beautiful Floscule,\" and although  it is easy enough to count them in _some_ positions, the observer may  have to exercise a good deal of patience before he is certain whether  they are five or six. For a long evening only five could be discerned in  the specimen now described, but the next night six were apparent without  difficulty or doubt. The hairs also will not appear anything like their  true length or number, unless the object-glass is good, and great care  is taken not to obscure them by a blaze of ill-directed light.    [Illustration: Chaetonotus larus (swimming).]    After the Floscules had been sufficiently admired and put aside, for  observations to be repeated on future occasions, a Rotifer attracted  attention by his merry-andrew pranks, throwing himself in all directions  by means of two long and extremely mobile toes attached to his  tail-foot. Then came a creature swimming like an otter, thrusting his  head about on all sides, and looking much more intelligent than most of  his compeers of the pond. Looked at vertically, he was somewhat  slipper-shaped, the rounded heel forming his head, then narrowing to a  waist, and expanding towards the other end, which projected in a fork.  All"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36922"],[0,"Antarctic Penguins: A Study of Their Social Habits (#10)"],[1," am quite convinced, and Campbell  agreed with me that there was no doubt of it. All the nests round about  had eggs under incubation, and the pair in question must have been  newcomers.\"      [Illustration: Fig. 41. AN ADELIE LEAPING FROM THE WATER (Page 82)]    On returning home I was glad to find that Mr. Bernacchi, who landed at  Cape Adare with the \"Southern Cross\" expedition, says in his account (p.  131) that he also saw penguins interfering and trying to stop others  from fighting.    Owing to our having several snowfalls without wind, and to the action of  the sun on the black rock, which I have mentioned already, the rookery  became a mass of slush in many places, and in some of the lower-lying  parts actually flooded. In some of these low-lying situations penguins  had unwarily made their nests, and there was one particular little  colony near our hut which was threatened with total extinction from the  accumulation of thaw water. As this trickled down from the higher ground  around them, the occupants of the flooded ground exerted all their  energies to avert this calamity, and from each nest one of its tenants  could be seen making journey after journey for pebbles, which it brought  to the one sitting on the nest, who placed stone after stone in  position, so that as the water rose the little castle grew higher and  higher and kept the eggs dry. One nest in particular I noticed which was  as yet a foot or so clear of the water and on dry ground; but whilst the  hen sat on this, the cock was working most energetically in anticipation  of what was going to happen, and for hours journeyed to and from the  nest, each time wading across the little lake to the other side, where  he was getting the stones.    This scene, which I photographed, is depicted on Fig. 33. In the  right-hand corner of the picture the cock is seen in the act of  delivering another stone to the hen who is waiting to receive it, whilst  some of the nests are actually surrounded by water. Fig. 34 shows  another nest, rising like a little island from a thaw pool, the eggs  being only just above water.      [Illustration: Fig. 42. ADELIE LEAPING FROM THE WATER    (THIS BIRD JUMPED 4 FEET HIGH AND 10 FEET LONG)    (Page 82)]    Some time ago I mentioned that there were penguins of weak individuality  who allowed others to rob them of their stones, and this was in some  cases very noticeable on the flooded ground, and there were one or two  nests here which had been almost entirely removed by thieving  neighbours.    To quote again from my notes.    \"November 10. This evening I saw a hen penguin trying to sit on a nest  with two eggs. The nest had no stones, and was scooped deeply in the  ground in a slush of melting snow, so that the eggs were nearly covered  with water. The poor hen stood in the water and kept trying to squat  down on the eggs, but each time she did so, sat in the water and had to  get up again. She was shivering with cold and all bedraggled.    \"I took the two eggs out of the nest, and Browning and I collected a  heap of stones (partly from her richer neighbours!) and built the nest  well up above the water. Then I replaced the eggs, and the hen at once  gladly sat on them, put them in position, and was busily engaged in  arranging the new stones round her when we left.\"    One day, when the season was well advanced, I saw a violent altercation  taking place between two penguins, one of which was in possession of a  nest in a somewhat isolated position. The other evidently was doing his  utmost to capture the nest, as whenever he got the other off, he stood  on it. There were scarcely any stones in the nest, which contained one  egg. I think from the way they fought that both were cocks.    For two reasons I make special mention of the occurrence, first, because  of all the fights I ever saw this was the longest and most relentless,  and, secondly, because the nest being in such an isolated position it  seemed curious that there could be any mistake about its ownership.  Such, however, seemed to be the case, and hour after hour, during the  whole day, they fought again and again.    After each bout of a few minutes both birds became so exhausted that  they sank panting to the ground, evidently suffering from thirst and at  the limit of their endurance. Sometimes one captured the nest, sometimes  the other, but after several hours of this, one of them began to show  signs of outlasting the other, and kept possession. For long after this,  however, the other returned repeatedly to the attack.      [Illustration: Fig. 43. JUMPING FROM THE WATER ON TO SLIPPERY ICE    (Page 82)]    I fetched my camera and photographed the birds as they fought (Fig. 36).  As time went on, the weaker bird took longer and longer intervals to  recover between his attacks, lying on his breast, with his head on the  snow and eyes half closed, so that I thought he was going to die. Each  time he got to his feet and staggered at his enemy, the latter rose from  the nest and met him, only to drive him back again. When I saw them at  about 10 P.M. (it was perpetual daylight now) both were lying down, the  victor on the nest, the vanquished about five yards off. The next day  one bird remained on the nest and the other had gone, and I do not know  what happened to him.    In the course of a walk through the rookery considerable diversity in  the choice of nesting sites was to be noticed. The general tendency is  for the penguins to build their nests close together (within a foot or  two of one another) on the tops of the rounded knolls, the lower levels  being left untenanted.    The most thickly populated districts were to be found on the screes  immediately below the cliffs. These screes having been formed in the  first instance by the falling of fragments due to weathering of the  cliff, their substance is still added to, little by little, as time goes  on, and therefore many are killed annually by falling rocks, as is  mentioned elsewhere, but weighing against this danger is the advantage  the cliff offers as a shelter from the E.S.E. gales. The same applies to  the nesting sites up the cliff, but I am convinced that only the love of  climbing can account for the extraordinary positions chosen by some of  the birds. Some of the nests are so difficult of access that their  occupants, on their way to them, may be seen sliding backwards down the  little glazed snow-slopes several times before they accomplish the  ascent, whilst in other places they have to jump from one foothold to  another along the almost perpendicular cliff.    Even up these heights a tendency to grouping is seen, though there are a  fair number of individuals who, seeming to seek seclusion, make their  nests at some distance from the others. I noticed this in some places  along the shore, too, where solitary nests were to be seen on isolated  patches of shingle.    When I visited Cape Royds in 1911 I found a couple nesting alone in a  cove known as \"Black Sand Beach,\" some half mile from the rookery there.  Such isolation as this, however, is very unusual, and was quite a  departure from the regular custom of the species.      [Illustration: Fig. 44. \"WHEN THEY SUCCEEDED IN PUSHING ONE OF THEIR    NUMBER OVER, ALL WOULD CRANE THEIR NECKS OVER THE EDGE\" (Page 83)]    In some places at Cape Adare, large rocks some two or three feet in  height stood about the rookery. Whenever the summit of one of these was  accessible, a pair built their nest upon it,(4) though how they managed  to keep up there during the gales was a matter for wonder, but the proud  possessors of the castle evidently had a delight in their lofty  position. One nest had been made on an old packing-case left by the  expedition which wintered there in 1894, and several nested among the  weathering bones of the seals that had died on the beach.      (4) Fig. 37.    Although the greatest care had been taken by nearly all in the choice of  sites that would be on dry ground when the thaw came later in the  season, yet a few hens had gone to the other extreme, and with greatest  stupidity chosen their site right down in the hollows where they were  absolutely certain to be flooded later on. These stupid ones are thus  prevented from rearing their young, and so selection keeps the wiser for  future generations, and eliminates the less intelligent from the  community, though perhaps some of these learn by experience, and next  year use more discrimination in choosing their nesting place.    Some of the colonies--in fact, most of them--were orderly and well  arranged, and later in the season distinctly peaceful. Others, however,  presented a less respectable appearance. There was one in particular,  close to our hut, which could only be described as a slum of the meanest  description. All through the season there was more fighting in this  colony than anywhere else, and so remarkable was this, that we  christened the locality \"Casey's Court\" and the name stuck for the rest  of the year.    The nests had fewer stones than elsewhere, and were more untidily made,  and when the eggs came, owing to the constant fighting that went on,  most of them got spilt from the nests or broken, and very few chicks  were hatched in consequence, the mortality among them also being so  great that of the whole colony of some hundred nests, I do not think  more than forty or fifty chicks at most reached maturity. The  explanation of this state of things lay, I believe, in the fact that our  hut and its curtilage deflected the stream of penguins on their way past  the spot from the water to the back of the rookery, so that a constant  stream of them passed through \"Casey's Court,\" upsetting the tempers of  the inhabitants so that they became disorderly. In addition to this,  there was a fairly big thaw pool and much miry ground near by, so that  the inhabitants were generally covered with mud and very disreputable to  look at.      [Illustra"]]]
