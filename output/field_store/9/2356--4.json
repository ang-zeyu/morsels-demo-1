Camp. This is an art that  is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29728"],[0,"Cookery and Dining in Imperial Rome (#10)"],[1,"liver  of the fish.    Some \"modern\" preparations are astonishingly ancient, and _vice  versa_. Our anchovy sauce is used freely to season fish, to mix with  butter, to be made into solid anchovy or fish paste. There are sardine  pastes, lobster pastes, fish forcemeats found in the larder of every  good kitchen--preparations of Apician character. A real platter of  _hors d'oeuvres_, an _antipasto_ is not complete unless made according  to certain Apician precepts.    _Muria_ is salt water, brine, yet it may stand for a fluid in which  fish or meat, fruits or vegetables have been pickled.    The difficulties of the translator of Apicius who takes him literally,  are unconsciously but neatly demonstrated by the work of Danneil. Even  he, seasoned practitioner, condemns _garum_, _muria_, _asa  f{oe}tida_, because professors before him have done so, because he  forgets that these very materials still form a vital part of some of  his own sauces only in a different shape, form or under a different  name. Danneil calls some Apician recipes \"incredibly absurd,\"  \"fabulous,\" \"exaggerated,\" but he thinks nothing of the serving of  similar combinations in his own establishment every day in the year.    Danneil would take pride in serving a Veal Cutlet a la Holstein. (What  have we learned of Apicius in the Northern countries?). The ancient  Holsteiner was not satisfied unless his piece of veal was covered with  a nice fat herring. That \"barbarity\" had to be modified by us moderns  into a veal cutlet, turned in milk and flour, eggs and bread crumbs,  fried, covered with fried eggs, garnished with anchovies or bits of  herring, red beets, capers, and lemon in order to qualify for a  restaurant favorite and \"best seller.\" Apicius hardly has a dish more  characteristic and more bewildering.    What of combinations of fish and meat?    _De gustibus non est disputandum._ It all goes into the same stomach.  May it be a sturdy one, and let its owner beware. What of our turkey  and oyster dressing? Of our broiled fish and bacon? Of our clam  chowder, our divine _Bouillabaisse_? If the ingredients and component  parts of such dishes were enumerated in the laconic and careless  Apician style, if they were stated without explicit instructions and  details (supposed to be known to any good practitioner) we would have  recipes just as mysterious as any of the Apician formulae.    Danneil, like ever so many interpreters, plainly shared the  traditional belief, the egregious errors of popular history. People  still are under the spell of the fantastic and fanciful descriptions  of Roman conviviality and gastronomic eccentricities. Indeed, we  rather believe in the insanity of these descriptions than in the  insane conduct of the average Roman gourmet. It is absurd of course to  assume and to make the world believe that a Roman patrician made a  meal of _garum_, _laserpitium_, and the like. They used these  condiments judiciously; any other use thereof is physically  impossible. They economized their spices which have caused so much  comment, too. As a matter of fact, they used condiments niggardly and  sparingly as is plainly described in some formulae, if only for the one  good and sufficient reason that spices and condiments which often came  from Asia and Africa were extremely expensive. This very reason,  perhaps, caused much of the popular outcry against their use, which,  by the way, is merely another form of political propaganda, in which,  as we shall see, the mob guided by the rabble of politicians excelled.    We moderns are just as \"extravagant\" (if not more) in the use of  sauces and condiments--Apician sauces, too! Our Worcestershire,  catsup, chili, chutney, walnut catsup, A I, Harvey's, Punch, Soyer's,  Escoffier's, Oscar's (every culinary coryphee endeavors to create  one)--our mustards and condiments in their different forms, if not  actually dating back to Apicius, are, at least lineal descendants from  ancient prototypes.    To readers little experienced in kitchen practice such phrases (often  repeated by Apicius) as, \"crush pepper, lovage, marjoram,\" etc.,  etc., may appear stereotyped and monotonous. They have not survived in  modern kitchen parlance, because the practice of using spices, flavors  and aromas has changed. There are now in the market compounds,  extracts, mixtures not used in the old days. Many modern spices come  to us ready ground or mixed, or compounded ready for kitchen use. This  has the disadvantage in that volatile properties deteriorate more  rapidly and that the goods may be easily adulterated. The Bavarians,  under Duke Albrecht, in 1553 prohibited the grinding of spices for  that very reason! Ground spices are time and labor savers, however.  Modern kitchen methods have put the old mortar practically out of  existence, at the expense of quality of the finished product.      THE \"LABOR ITEM\"    The enviable Apicius cared naught for either time or labor. He gave  these two important factors in modern life not a single thought. His  culinary procedures required a prodigious amount of labor and effort  on the part of the cooks and their helpers. The labor item never  worried any ancient employer. It was either very cheap or entirely  free of charge.    The selfish gourmet (which gourmet is not selfish?) almost wonders  whether the abolition of slavery was a well-advised measure in modern  social and economic life. Few people appreciate the labor cost in  excellent cookery and few have any conception of the cost of good food  service today. Yet all demand both, when \"dining out,\" at least. Who,  on the other hand, but a brute would care to dine well, \"taking it out  of the hide of others?\"    Hence we moderns with a craving for _gourmandise_ but minus  appropriations for skilled labor would do well to follow the example  of Alexandre Dumas who cheerfully and successfully attended to his own  cuisine. Despite an extensive fiction practice he found time to edit  \"Le Grand Dictionnaire de Cuisine\" and was not above writing mustard  advertisements, either.      SUMPTUARY LAWS    The appetite of the ancients was at times successfully curbed by  sumptuary laws, cropping out at fairly regular intervals. These laws,  usually given under the pretext of safeguarding the morals of the  people and accompanied by similar euphonious phrases were, like modern  prohibitions, vicious and virulent effusions of the predatory instinct  in mankind. We cannot give a chronological list of them here, and are  citing them merely to illustrate the difficulty confronting the  prospective ancient host.    During the reign of Caesar and Augustus severe laws were passed, fixing  the sums to be spent for public and private dinners and specifying the  edibles to be consumed. These laws classified gastronomic functions  with an ingenious eye for system, professing all the time to protect  the public's morals and health; but they were primarily designed to  replenish the ever-vanishing contents of the Imperial exchequer and  to provide soft jobs for hordes of enforcers. The amounts allowed to  be spent for various social functions were so ridiculously small in  our own modern estimation that we may well wonder how a Roman host  could have ever made a decent showing at a banquet. However, he and  the cooks managed somehow. Imperial spies and informers were  omnipresent. The market places were policed, the purchases by  prospective hosts carefully noted, dealers selling supplies and cooks  (the more skillful kind usually) hired for the occasion were bribed to  reveal the \"menu.\" Dining room windows had to be located conveniently  to allow free inspection from the street of the dainties served; the  passing Imperial food inspector did not like to intrude upon the  sanctity of the host's home. The pitiable host of those days, his  unenviable guests and the bewildered cooks, however, contrived and  conspired somehow to get up a banquet that was a trifle better than a  Chicago quick lunch.    How did they do it?    In the light of modern experience gained by modern governments  dillydallying with sumptuary legislation that has been discarded as a  bad job some two thousand years ago, the question seems superfluous.    _Difficile est satyram non scribere!_ To make a long story short: The  Roman host just broke the law, that's all. Indeed, those who made the  laws were first to break them. The minions, appointed to uphold the  law, were easily accounted for. Any food inspector too arduous in the  pursuit of his duty was disposed of by dispatching him to the rear  entrance of the festive hall, and was delivered to the tender care of  the chief cook.    Such was the case during the times of Apicius. Indeed, the Roman idea  of good cheer during earlier epochs was provincial enough. It was  simply barbaric before the Greeks showed the Romans a thing or two in  cookery. The methods of fattening fowl introduced from Greece was  something unheard-of! It was outrageous, sacrilegious! Senators,  orators and other self-appointed saviors of humanity thundered against  the vile methods of tickling the human palate, deftly employing all  the picturesque tam-tam and _elan_ still the stock in trade of ever so  many modern colleagues in any civilized parliament. The speeches, to  be sure, passed into oblivion, the fat capons, however, stayed in the  barnyards until they had acquired the saturation point of tender  luscious calories to be enjoyed by those who could afford them. How  the capon was \"invented\" is told in a note on the subject.    Many other so-called luxuries, sausage from Epirus, cherries from the  Pontus, oysters from England, were greeted with a studied hostility by  those who profited from the business of making laws and public  opinion.    Evidently, the time and the place was not very propitious for  gastronomic over-indulgence. Only when the ice was broken, when the  disregard for law and order had become general through the "]]]
