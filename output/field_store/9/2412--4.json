So I made the  best of my way back again, though dreadfully bruised by the  hail-stones, and at last a very heavy one struck me such a blow on the  top of my head, that I was quite stunned; and I can remember nothing  more, till I found myself in the hands of your papa's stable-boy, Tom.  He had picked me up, when looking for mushrooms in the meadow, and  thought perhaps that I should make a nice breakfast for his kitten. But  when he found me come to life again, he said he would tame me, and make  me draw a little pasteboard cart to amuse his sister Jenny. You cannot  think how cruelly he used me, and how he made my lips bleed by forcing  an iron bit into my mouth. And then he almost killed me by trying to  make me swallow raw meat, which is a sort of food none of our species  can abide. Truly, I should never have lived to have related this  history, if you had not come into the stable-yard to see the young  rabbits. Most fortunately for me, you were singing your favourite song.  I remembered the words and the sweet clear voice instantly, and I said  to myself, \"Perhaps the young lady that was so kind to the little  gleaner, may have compassion on a poor harvest-mouse.\" You know the  rest: I squeaked with all my might; you heard me, and soon persuaded  Tom to give up his prize in exchange for a dozen fine apples from your  own little tree.    And now, my dear kind mistress, will you not fulfil your promise, and  give me my liberty? I have been very happy with you, but I long  exceedingly to return to the beautiful green bank again, and to see  dear mamma, who must be dreadfully anxious about me, for it is now six  days since I left the nest. Hold me up to your face, and let me read my  fate in your beautiful eyes, which I declare are almost as bright and  dark as my mother's. Bring me closer, quite close, for I am rather  near-sighted. That will do. Oh joy! I see by those sweet sparklers,  that my petition is granted, and that I shall sleep to-night by my  mother's side in the downy nest on the thistle.                     *       *       *       *       *    When this history was finished, Leatherwing said, that the little girl  pressed her captive to her lips, and then, putting on her straw hat,  she immediately walked out into the fields, with Minimus perched upon  her hand.          CHAPTER VII.      It was now the season for collecting nuts, acorns, and beech-mast; and  it was time that the squirrels attended to the important business of  filling their several storehouses with a supply of provisions for the  winter.    Now their own oak would furnish acorns for hundreds of squirrels, and  some beech-trees, laden with mast, were close at hand; but in order to  procure hazle-nuts, their favourite food, it was necessary to go rather  further from home. The nearest spot where the business of nutting could  be carried on with much success, was a large hazel-copse, on the side  of a hill, at the upper end of the valley. But the great difficulty  was, how to obtain these nuts without risking their lives. For since  the appearance of the wild-cat in the neighbourhood the squirrels had  always avoided the thick bushes and underwood, knowing that she could  more easily surprise them there, than among the open branches of large  trees. Even in the trees they were very careful to look well about  them, as they fully believed that the enemy was still in the  neighbourhood, for Leatherwing, who had promised to give them early  information, could hear no account of her having been killed. Indeed,  he had very lately overheard a farmer complaining to a neighbour, that  the night before, he had had three fine lambs killed, and several  others sadly mangled by this destructive wild beast.    But to pass the tedious winter without a supply of nuts appeared as  great a hardship to the squirrels as it would be to us to live for  several months upon bread and water. Therefore, after several  consultations on the subject, it was at length agreed, that _nuts  they would have_, at all hazards; for said Brush, \"Better to be eaten  up by the wild-cat than starved.\" So one fine morning the whole party  set off to the hazel-copse.    Now this reminds me of the happy hours I have myself passed in the  woods, when I have joined a merry party of my young friends on one of  those most joyful occasions, a _nutting expedition_. How can a day be  passed more pleasantly? Oh! the delight of gathering the lovely brown  clusters of five or six, or even sometimes seven or eight together!  Then the dinner by the side of the clear stream, whose pure waters  furnish not the least grateful part of the repast! and the notes of  unrestrained merriment and joy, filling the woods with the echoes of  sweet young voices! Even the torn frocks, and scratched hands and arms,  are disregarded; and they are such common attendants upon these joyous  expeditions, that to return from them with perfectly whole garments and  _skins_, would imply that the bag of nuts might have been heavier, if  the party had been less fearful of the brambles and thorns. Now for the  squirrels again.    The nuts were exactly in that state in which I like to find them--quite  full and brown, and _almost_ ready to fall out of their husks. But not  _quite_ ripe enough to do this, for then a great many are shaken out  upon the ground, and lost. But the nuts were in perfection, and our  party were employed the whole day in journeying backwards and forwards,  between the hazel-copse and their storehouses in the old oak. No  wild-cat or other enemy appeared, and the young squirrels began to  think that their parents' continual cautions to be on the look out for  this animal were unnecessary.    The next day the party were again hard at work, and even the old  squirrels were so busily employed in filling their own mouths, and in  teaching their children how to select the ripest and soundest nuts,  that they seemed almost to have forgotten that they had a single enemy  in the world. They had already made several journeys, and were now  eagerly engaged in some large old hazel-trees, close to a wide pathway,  which had been cut through the wood for the convenience of the  sportsmen. Suddenly Brush perceived, partly concealed among the thick  underwood, a dark, fearful-looking object, which--_could_ it be the  dreaded foe, or was it only the brown trunk of a tree? He was not long  in doubt, for now the head of the monster appeared from among the  leaves, and then those savage eyes! having once seen them how could he  possibly mistake their terrible glances? Brush was so frightened, that  he absolutely allowed three remarkably fine nuts to fall out of his  mouth upon the ground, and at last he gave the note of alarm. \"Fly all  of you,\" cried he, \"the enemy is close at hand!\" Then he recovered  sufficient presence of mind to remember how he had himself escaped from  his pursuer in the oak, and he desired his family to retreat to the  small outer branches of the trees, where they would but just support  their weight, for he knew that the young ones were too small and weak  to make their escape by flight.    But this clever plan did not succeed so well in these low nut-trees as  among the lofty branches of the oak, where a tumble to the ground would  most likely have broken some of the adversary's bones. The cunning  beast appeared to understand the difference between the two situations,  but for a minute or two she remained motionless, as if she were  planning the best way of making her attack. At last, with a single  bound she was in the tree. She fearlessly dashed at one of the young  squirrels, who sat trembling at the farther end of a branch,  overhanging the pathway; it gave way beneath her weight, and both  animals fell to the ground below. But while the poor little squirrel  was so shaken by the fall that he could only crawl slowly away, the  cat, like all animals of her kind, pitched unhurt upon her feet,[10]  and was just upon the point of seizing her prey in her terrible hooked  claws, when bang!--the report of a gun from the adjoining thicket.          [10] It is well known that cats have the power of turning        themselves over in the air, so as to bring their legs undermost,        when they fall, or are thrown, from a height; but how this        desirable change of position is brought about or maintained, it        is not very easy to explain. One would have supposed that the        centre of gravity would have brought the _back_ undermost. To        prove that these animals _do_ possess the power of turning over        in the air, take a cat, or a kitten, and hold her by her four        feet, two in each of your hands, with her back downwards, at        about the height of the table from the ground. Now if you open        both your hands suddenly, your assistant in the experiment will        change her position almost as quickly as a shuttlecock turns        round when struck by the battledore, and will alight safely on        her feet. But if you hold her at a _very short_ distance from the        ground, poor puss will not have time to execute her clever feat,        and will fall on her back. Therefore, for her sake, practise this        experiment _over a bed_.    Here I must inform you, that Harvey, the gamekeeper, who had long been  looking out for the destroyer, had this morning been informed by some  boys who were nutting in the copse, that they had seen her running  across an open space, with a fine cock pheasant in her mouth. Now the  keeper had found, from his experience on two former occasions, that it  was useless to fire small shot at an animal who had such a defence in  her thick close fur, and who was too wary to allow him to approach very  near.
