And the  only thought with which he could fill his mind, the one forlorn ghost of  a hope that he could cling to, was that of an island, a volcanic peak  that rose from dark waters to point upward toward the heights.    The guard of four was clustered about; the figures were waiting now in  the gathering dark--waiting, while the one in scarlet listened and spoke  alternately into a jeweled instrument that hung by a slender chain about  his neck. He raised one lean hand to motion the stirring guards to  silence, listened again intently into the instrument, then pointed that  hand toward the cloud-filled sky, while he craned his thin neck to look  above him.    The men's eyes followed the pointing hand to see only the sullen black  of unlit clouds. The last distant aircraft had vanished from the skies;  not a ship was in the air--only the enveloping blanket of high-flung  vapor that blocked out all traces of the heavens. And then!--    The cloud banks high in the skies flashed suddenly to dazzling, rolling  flame. The ground under their feet was shaken as by a distant  earthquake, while, above, the terrible fire spread, a swift, flashing  conflagration that ate up the masses of clouds.    \"What in thunder--\" McGuire began; then stopped as he caught, in the  light from above, the reflection of fierce exultation in the eyes of the  scarlet one. The evil, gloating message of those eyes needed no words to  explain its meaning. That this cataclysm was self-made by these beings,  McGuire knew, and he knew that in some way it meant menace to him and  his.    Yet he groped in thought for some definite meaning. No menace could this  be to himself personally, for he and Sykes stood there safe in the  company of the councilor himself. Then the threat of this flaming blast  must be directed toward the earth!           *       *       *       *       *    The fire vanished, and once more, as Professor Sykes had seen on that  night so long ago, the blanket of clouds was broken. McGuire followed  the gaze of the scientist whose keen eyes were probing in these brief  moments into the depths of star-lit space.    \"There--there!\" Sykes exclaimed in awe-struck tones. His hand was  pointing outward through the space where flames had cleared the sky. A  star was shining in the heavens with a glory that surpassed all others.  It outshone all neighboring stars, and it sent its light down through  the vast empty reaches of space, a silent message to two humans,  despondent and heartsick, who stared with aching eyes.    Lieutenant McGuire did not hear his friend's whispered words. No need to  name that distant world--it was Earth! Earth!... And it was calling to  its own....    There was a flying-field--so plain before his mental eyes; men in khaki  and leather who moved and talked and spoke of familiar things ... and  the thunder of motors ... and roaring planes....    Some far recess within his deeper self responded strangely. What now of  threats and these brute-things that threatened?--he was one with this  picture he had visioned. He was himself; he was a man of that distant  world of men; they would show these vile things how men could meet  menace--or death.... His shoulders were back and unconsciously he stood  erect.    The scarlet figure was close beside them in the dusk, his voice vibrant  with a quality which should have struck fear to his captives' hearts as  he ordered them on. But the look in his crafty eyes changed to one of  puzzled wonder at sight of the men.    Hands on each other's shoulders, they stood there in the gathering dark,  where grotesque trees arched twistingly overhead. Their moment of  depression had passed; Earth had called, and they had heard it, each  after his own fashion. But to each the call had been one of clear  courage. No longer cast off and forlorn, they were one with their own  world.    \"Down,\" said Professor Sykes with a whimsical smile; \"down, but not  out!\" And the lieutenant responded in kind.    \"Are we down-hearted?\" he demanded loudly. And the two turned as one man  to grin at the scarlet one as they thundered. \"N-o-o!\"      CHAPTER X    Two men grinned in derision at the horrible, man-shaped thing that held  their destinies in his lean, inhuman hands!--but they turned abruptly  away to look again above them where that bright star still shone through  an opening in the clouds.    \"The earth! Home!\" It seemed as if they could never tear their eyes away  from the sight.    Their captor whistled an order, and the guard of four tugged vainly at  the two, who resisted that they might gaze upon their own world until  the closing clouds should blot it from sight. A cry from one of the red  guards roused them.    The dark was closing in fast, and their surroundings were dim. Vaguely,  McGuire felt more than saw one of the red figures whirled into the air.  He sensed a movement in the jungle darkness where were groves of weird  trees and the tangle of huge vegetable growths. What it was he could not  say, but he felt the guard who clutched at him quiver in terror.    Their leader snatched at the instrument that hung about his neck and put  it to his lips; he whistled an order, sharp and shrill. Blazing light  that seemed to flame in the air was the response; the air was aglow with  an all-pervading brilliance like that in the car that had whirled them  from the landing field. The light was everywhere, and the building  before them was surrounded by a dazzling envelope of luminosity.    Whatever of motion or menace there had been ceased abruptly. Their  guard, three now in number instead of four, seized them roughly and  hustled them toward an open door. No time, as they passed, for more than  fleeting impressions: a hall of warm, glowing light--a passage that  branched off--and, at the end, a room into which they were thrown, while  a metal door clanged behind them.           *       *       *       *       *    These were no gentle hands that hurled the men staggering through the  doorway, and Professor Sykes fell headlong upon the glassy floor. He  sprang to his feet, his face aflame with anger. \"The miserable beasts!\"  he shouted.    \"Take it easy,\" admonished the flyer. \"We're in the hoose-gow; no use of  getting all fussed up if they don't behave like perfect gentlemen.    \"There's a bunk in the corner,\" he said, and pointed to a woven hammock  that was covered with soft cloths; \"and here's another that I can sling.  Twin beds! What more do you want?\"    He opened a door and the splash of falling water came to them. A  fountain cascaded to the ceiling to fall splashing upon a floor of  inlaid, glassy tile. McGuire whistled.    \"Room and bath,\" he said. \"And you complained of the service!\"    \"I have an idea,\" he told the scientist, \"that our scarlet friend who  owns this place intends to treat us decently, even though his helpers  are a bit rough. My hunch is that he wants to get some information out  of us. That old bird back there in the council chamber told me as plain  as day that they think they are going to conquer the earth. Maybe that's  why we are here--as exhibits A and B, for them to study and learn how to  lick us.\"    \"You are talking what I would have termed nonsense a month ago,\"  replied Sykes, \"but now--well, I am afraid you are right. And,\" he said  slowly, \"I fear that they are equally correct. They have conquered  space; they have ships propelled by some unknown power; they have gas  weapons, as you and I have reason to know. And they have all the  beastly ferocity to carry such a plan through to success. But I wonder  what that sky-splitting blast meant.\"    \"Bombardment,\" the flyer told him; \"bombardment of the earth as sure as  you're alive.\"    \"More nonsense,\" said Sykes; \"and probably correct.... Well, what are we  to do?--sit tight and give them as little information as we can? or--\"  His question ended unfinished; the alternative, it seemed, was not plain  to him.    \"There's only one answer,\" said McGuire. \"We must get away; escape  somehow.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Professor Sykes' eyes showed his appreciation of a spirit that could  still dare to hope, but he asked dejectedly: \"Escape? Good idea. But  where to?\"    \"I have an idea,\" the flyer said slowly. \"An idea about an island.\" He  told the professor what he had observed--the fact that there was one  spot of land on this globe from which the traffic of these monsters of  Venus steered clear. This, he explained, must have some significance.    \"Whatever is there, God only knows,\" he admitted, \"but it is something  these devils don't like a little bit. It might be interesting to learn  more. We'll make a break for it; find a boat. No, we probably can't do  it, but we can make a try. Now what is our first step, I wonder.\"    \"Our first step,\" said Professor Sykes, measuring his words as if he  might be working out some astronomical calculation, \"is into the  inverted shower-bath, if you feel as hot as I do. And our next step,  when all is quiet for the night, is through the window I see beyond. I  can see the branches of one of those undernourished trees from here.\"    \"Last one in is a lop-eared Venusian!\" said McGuire, throwing off his  jacket. And in that strange room in a strange world, under the shadow of  death and of tortures unknown, the two men stripped with all the  care-free abandon of a couple of schoolboys racing to be first in the  old swimming hole.           *       *       *       *       *    It was some time later when the door opened and a long red hand pushed a  tray of food into the room. The tray was of unbreakable crystal--he  rattled it heedlessly upon the floor--and it held crystal dishes of  unknown foods.    They were sampling them all when Sykes remarked plaintively, \"I would  like to know what under heaven I am eating.\"    \"I've wished to know that in lots of restaurants,\" McGuire replied. \"I  remember a place down on-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/307"],[0,"Three Elephant Power, and Other Stories (#10)"],[1,"a passion for horses and flowers. When he \"had a big  win\", as he occasionally did, it was his custom to have movable wooden  stables, built on skids, put up in the yard, and to have tons of the  best soil that money could buy carted into the garden of the premises  which he was occupying.    Then he would keep splendid horses, and grow rare roses and show-bench  chrysanthemums. His landlord passing by would see the garden in a  blaze of colour, and promise himself to raise the bookmaker's rent next  quarter day.    However, when the bookmaker \"took the knock\", as he invariably did at  least twice a year, it was his pleasing custom to move without giving  notice. He would hitch two cart-horses to the stables, and haul them  right away at night. He would not only dig up the roses, trees, and  chrysanthemums he had planted, but would also cart away the soil he  had brought in; in fact, he used to shift the garden bodily. He had one  garden that he shifted to nearly every suburb in Sydney; and he always  argued that the change of air was invaluable for chrysanthemums.    Being determined, then, to go in for gardening on common-sense  principles, and having decided on the shrubs you mean to grow, the next  consideration is your chance of growing them.    If your neighbour keeps game fowls, it may be taken for granted that  before long they will pay you a visit, and you will see the rooster  scratching your pot plants out by the roots as if they were so much  straw, just to make a nice place to lie down and fluff the dust over  himself. Goats will also stray in from the street, and bite the young  shoots off, selecting the most valuable plants with a discrimination  that would do credit to a professional gardener.    It is therefore useless to think of growing delicate or squeamish  plants. Most amateur gardeners maintain a lifelong struggle against the  devices of Nature; but when the forces of man and the forces of Nature  come into conflict Nature wins every time. Nature has decreed that  certain plants shall be hardy, and therefore suitable to suburban  amateur gardeners; the suburban amateur gardener persists in trying to  grow quite other plants, and in despising those marked out by Nature for  his use. It is to correct this tendency that this article is written.    The greatest standby to the amateur gardener should undoubtedly be the  blue-flowered shrub known as \"plumbago\". This homely but hardy plant  will grow anywhere. It naturally prefers a good soil, and a sufficient  rainfall, but if need be it will worry along without either. Fowls  cannot scratch it up, and even the goat turns away dismayed from its  hard-featured branches. The flower is not strikingly beautiful nor  ravishingly scented, but it flowers nine months out of the year;  smothered with street dust and scorched by the summer sun, you will find  that faithful old plumbago plugging along undismayed. A plant like  this should be encouraged--but the misguided amateur gardener as a rule  despises it.    The plant known as the churchyard geranium is also one marked out by  Providence for the amateur; so is Cosmea, which comes up year after year  where once planted. In creepers, bignonia and lantana will hold their  own under difficulties perhaps as well as any that can be found. In  trees the Port Jackson fig is a patriotic one to grow. It is a fine  plant to provide exercise, as it sheds its leaves unsparingly, and  requires the whole garden to be swept up every day.    Your aim as a student of Nature should be to encourage the survival  of the fittest. There is a grass called nut grass, and another called  Parramatta grass, either of which holds its own against anything living  or dead. The average gardening manual gives you recipes for destroying  these. Why should you destroy them in favour of a sickly plant that  needs constant attention? No. The Parramatta grass is the selected of  Nature, and who are you to interfere with Nature?    Having decided to go in for strong, simple plants that will hold their  own, and a bit over, you must get your implements of husbandry.    The spade is the first thing, but the average ironmonger will show you  an unwieldy weapon only meant to be used by navvies. Don't buy it. Get a  small spade, about half-size--it is nice and light and doesn't tire the  wrist, and with it you can make a good display of enthusiasm, and earn  the hypocritical admiration of your wife. After digging for half-an-hour  or so, get her to rub your back with any of the backache cures. From  that moment you will have no further need for the spade.    A barrow is about the only other thing needed; anyhow, it is almost a  necessity for wheeling cases of whisky up to the house. A rake is useful  when your terrier dog has bailed up a cat, and will not attack it until  the cat is made to run.    Talking of terrier dogs, an acquaintance of ours has a dog that does all  his gardening. The dog is a small elderly terrier with a failing memory.  As soon as the terrier has planted a bone in the garden the owner slips  over, digs it up and takes it away. When that terrier goes back and  finds the bone gone, he distrusts his memory, and begins to think that  perhaps he has made a mistake, and has dug in the wrong place; so he  sets to work, and digs patiently all over the garden, turning over acres  of soil in the course of his search. This saves his master a lot of  backache.    The sensible amateur gardener, then, will not attempt to fight with  Nature but will fall in with her views. What more pleasant than to get  out of bed at 11.30 on a Sunday morning; to look out of your window at  a lawn waving with the feathery plumes of Parramatta grass, and to see  beyond it the churchyard geranium flourishing side by side with the  plumbago and the Port Jackson fig?    The garden gate blows open, and the local commando of goats, headed by  an aged and fragrant patriarch, locally known as De Wet, rushes in; but  their teeth will barely bite through the wiry stalks of the Parramatta  grass, and the plumbago and the figtree fail to attract them, and  before long they stand on one another's shoulders, scale the fence, and  disappear into the next-door garden, where a fanatic is trying to grow  show roses.    After the last goat has scaled your neighbour's fence, and only De Wet  is left, your little dog discovers him. De Wet beats a hurried retreat,  apparently at full speed, with the dog exactly one foot behind him in  frantic pursuit. We say apparently at full speed, because experience has  taught that De Wet can run as fast as a greyhound when he likes; but  he never exerts himself to go faster than is necessary to keep just in  front of whatever dog is after him.    Hearing the scrimmage, your neighbour comes on to his verandah, and sees  the chase going down the street.    \"Ha! that wretched old De Wet again!\" he says. \"Small hope your dog has  of catching him! Why don't you get a garden gate like mine, so that he  won't get in?\"    \"No; he can't get in at your gate,\" is the reply; \"but I think his  commando are in your back garden now.\"    Then follows a frantic rush. Your neighbour falls downstairs in his  haste, and the commando, after stopping to bite some priceless pot  plants of your neighbour's as they come out, skips easily back over the  fence and through your gate into the street again.    If a horse gets in his hoofs make no impression on the firm turf of the  Parramatta grass, and you get quite a hearty laugh by dropping a chair  on him from the first-floor window.    The game fowls of your other neighbour come fluttering into your garden,  and scratch and chuckle and fluff themselves under your plumbago bush;  but you don't worry. Why should you? They can't hurt it; and, besides,  you know that the small black hen and the big yellow one, who have  disappeared from the throng, are even now laying their daily egg for you  behind the thickest bush.    Your little dog rushes frantically up and down the front bed of your  garden, barking and racing, and tearing up the ground, because his rival  little dog, who lives down the street, is going past with his master,  and each pretends that he wants to be at the other--as they have  pretended every day for the past three years. The performance he is  going through doesn't disturb you. Why should it? By following the  directions in this article you have selected plants he cannot hurt.    After breakfasting at noon, you stroll out, and, perhaps, smooth with  your foot, or with your spade, the inequalities made by the hens; you  gather up casually the eggs they have laid; you whistle to your little  dog, and go out for a stroll with a light heart.          THIRSTY ISLAND      Travellers approaching a bush township are sure to find some distance  from the town a lonely public-house waiting by the roadside to give  them welcome. Thirsty (miscalled Thursday) Island is the outlying pub of  Australia.    When the China and British-India steamers arrive from the North the  first place they come to is Thirsty Island, the sentinel at the gate of  Torres Straits. New chums on the steamers see a fleet of white-sailed  pearling luggers, a long pier clustered with a hybrid crowd of every  colour, caste and creed under Heaven, and at the back of it all a little  galvanized-iron town shining in the sun.    For nine months of the year a crisp, cool south-east wind blows, the  snow-white beach is splashed with spray and dotted with the picturesque  figures of Japanese divers and South Sea Island boatmen. Coco-nut palms  line the roads by the beach, and back of the town are the barracks and a  fort nestling among the trees on the hillside. Thirsty Island is a nice  place--to look at.    When a vessel makes fast the Thirsty Islanders come down to greet  the new-comers and give them welcome to Australia. The new-chums are  inclined to patronise these simple, outlying people.
