Great slaughter was made among them, but a  hundred and fifty Spaniards were killed; nearly all the rest were  wounded, and, worn down with fatigue, the survivors retreated to the  fortifications. The Indians did not follow them, or, worn out as they  were, they would have perished miserably to a man. At night the  Spaniards escaped. From the meager and unsatisfactory notices of these  events that have come down to us, it is not known with accuracy by what  route they reached the coast; but the next that we hear of them is at  Campeachy.    The fortunes of Davila were no better. Arrived at the province of Ba  Khalal, he sent a message to the Lord of Chemecal to inquire about  gold, and requesting a supply of provisions; the fierce answer of the  cacique was, that he would send fowls on spears, and Indian corn on  arrows. With forty men and five horses left, Davila struggled back to  the coast, and, two years after their unfortunate separation, he joined  the adelantado in Campeachy.    Their courage was still unbroken. Roused by the arrival of Davila, the  adelantado determined to make another attempt to penetrate the country.  For this purpose he again sent off Davila with fifty men, himself  remaining in Campeachy with but forty soldiers and ten horsemen. As  soon as the Indians discovered his small force, an immense multitude  gathered round the camp. Hearing a tumult, the adelantado went out on  horseback, and, riding toward a group assembled on a little hill, cried  out, endeavouring to pacify them; but the Indians, turning in the  direction of the voice, and recognising the adelantado, surrounded him,  laid hands upon the reins of his horse, and tried to wrest from him his  lance. The adelantado spurred his horse, and extricated himself for a  moment, but so many Indians came up that they held his horse fast by  the feet, took away his lance, and endeavoured to carry him off alive,  intending, as they afterward said, to sacrifice him to their gods. Blas  Gonzales was the only soldier near him, who, seeing his danger, threw  himself on horseback, cleared a way through the Indians with his lance,  and, with others who came up at the moment, rescued the adelantado.  Both himself and the brave Gonzales were severely wounded, and the  horse of the latter died of his wounds.    About this time the fame of the discovery of Peru reached these unlucky  conquerors, and, taking advantage of the opportunity afforded by their  proximity to the coast, many of the soldiers deserted. To follow up the  conquest of Yucatan, it was indispensable to recruit his forces, and  for this purpose the adelantado determined on going to New Spain.    He had previously sent information to the king of his misfortunes, and  the king had despatched a royal parchment to the audiencia of Mexico,  setting forth the services of the adelantado, the labours and losses he  had sustained, and charging them to give him assistance in all that  related to the conquest of Yucatan. With this favour and his rents in  New Spain, he got together some soldiers, and bought vessels, arms, and  other munitions of war, to prosecute his conquest. Unluckily, as  Tobasco belonged to his government, and the Indians of that province,  who had been subdued by Cortez, had revolted, he considered it  advisable first to reduce them. The vessels sailed from Vera Cruz, and,  stopping at Tobasco with a portion of his recruits, he sent on the  vessels with the rest, under the command of his son, to prosecute the  conquest in Yucatan.    But the adelantado found it much more difficult than he expected to  reduce the Indians of Tobasco; and while he was engaged in it, the  Spaniards in Campeachy, instead of being able to penetrate into the  country, were undergoing great sufferings. The Indians cut off their  supplies of provisions, and, being short of sustenance, nearly all  became ill. They were obliged to make constant sorties to procure food,  and it was necessary to let the horses go loose, though at the risk of  their being killed. They were reduced so low that but five soldiers  remained to watch over and provide for the rest. Finding it impossible  to hold out any longer, they determined to abandon the place. Gonzales  Nieto, who first planted the royal standard on the shores of Yucatan,  was the last to leave it, and in the year 1535 not a single Spaniard  remained in the country.    It was now notorious that the adelantado had not fulfilled the order to  carry with him priests, and, by many of the daring but devout spirits  of that day, his want of success in Yucatan was ascribed to this cause.  The viceroy of Mexico, in the exercise of the discretion allowed under  a rescript from the queen, determined forthwith to send priests, who  should conquer the country by converting the Indians to Christianity.    The venerable Franciscan friar, Jacobo de Festera, although superior  and prelate of the rich province of Mexico, zealous, says the  historian, for the conversion of souls, and desirous to reduce the  whole world to the knowledge of the true God, offered himself for this  spiritual conquest, expecting many hardships, and doubtful of the  result. Four persons of the same order were assigned as his companions;  and, attended by some friendly Mexicans who had been converted to  Christianity, on the eighth of March they arrived at Champoton, famed  for the \"mala pelea,\" or bad fight, of the Spaniards.    The Mexicans went before them to give notice of their coming, and to  say that they came in the spirit of peace, few in number, and without  arms, caring only for the salvation of souls, and to make known to the  people the true God, whom they ought to worship. The lords of Champoton  received the Mexican messengers amicably, and, satisfied that they  could run but little risk, allowed the missionaries to enter their  country. Regardless of the concerns of this world, says the historian,  and irreproachable in their lives, they prevailed upon the Indians to  listen to their preaching, and in a few days enjoyed the fruit of their  labours. This fruit, he adds, \"was not so great as if they had had  interpreters familiar with the idiom; but the divine grace and the  earnestness of these ministers were so powerful that, after forty days'  communication, the lords brought voluntarily all their idols, and  delivered them to the priests to be burned;\" and, as the best proof of  their sincerity, they brought their children, whom, says the Bishop Las  Casas, they cherished more than the light of their eyes, to be  indoctrinated and taught. Every day they became more attached to the  padres, built them houses to live in, and a temple for worship; and one  thing occurred which had never happened before. Twelve or fifteen  lords, with great territories and many vassals, with the consent of  their people, voluntarily acknowledged the dominion of the King of  Castile. This agreement, under their signs and attested by the monks,  the bishop says he had in his possession.    At this time, when, from such great beginnings, the conversion of the  whole kingdom of Yucatan seemed almost certain, there happened (to use,  as near as possible, the language of the historian) the greatest  disaster that the devil, greedy of souls, could desire. Eighteen  horsemen and twelve foot-soldiers, fugitives from New Spain, entered  the country from some quarter, bringing with them loads of idols, which  they had carried off from other provinces. The captain called to him a  lord of that part of the country by which he entered, and told him to  take the idols and distribute them throughout the country, selling each  one for an Indian man or woman to serve as a slave, and adding, that if  the lord refused to do so, he would immediately make war upon them. The  lord commanded his vassals to take these idols and worship them, and in  return to give him Indian men and women to be delivered to the  Spaniards. The Indians, from fear and respect to the command of their  lord, obeyed. Whoever had two children gave one, and whoever had three  gave two.    In the mean time, seeing that, after they had given up their gods to be  burned, these Spaniards brought others to sell, the whole country broke  out in indignation against the monks, whom they accused of deceiving  them. The monks endeavoured to appease them, and, seeking out the  thirty Spaniards, represented to them the great evil they were doing,  and required them to leave the country; but the Spaniards refused, and  consummated their wickedness by telling the Indians that the priests  themselves had induced them to come into the country. The Indians were  now roused beyond all forbearance, and determined to murder the  priests, who, having notice of this intention, escaped at night. Very  soon, however, the Indians repented, and, remembering the purity of  their lives, and satisfied of their innocence, they sent after the  monks fifty leagues, and begged them to return. The monks, zealous only  for their souls, forgave them and returned; but, finding that the  Spaniards would not leave the country, and that they were constantly  aggrieving the Indians, and especially that they could not preach in  peace, nor without continual dread, they determined to leave the  country and return to Mexico. Thus Yucatan remained without the light  and help of the doctrine, and the miserable Indians, in the darkness of  ignorance.    Such is the account of the mission of these monks given by the old  Spanish historians, but the cautious reader of the present day will  hardly credit that these good priests, \"ignorant of the language, and  without interpreters who understood the idiom,\" could in forty days  bring the Indians to throw their idols at their feet; and still less,  that this warlike people, who had made such fierce resistance to  Cordova, Grijalva, Cortez, and the adelantado, would all at "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3317"],[0,"Now It Can Be Told (#10)"],[1,"any form is  repulsive. His sense of humor was developed upon lines of irony and  he had a sly twinkle in his eyes before telling one of his innumerable  anecdotes. They were good stories, and I remember one of them, which had  to do with the retreat from Mons. It was not, to tell the truth, that  \"orderly\" retreat which is described in second-hand accounts. There were  times when it was a wild stampede from the tightening loop of a German  advance, with lorries and motor-cycles and transport wagons going  helter-skelter among civilian refugees and mixed battalions and  stragglers from every unit walking, footsore, in small groups. Even  General Headquarters was flurried at times, far in advance of this  procession backward. One night Sir Neville Macready, with the judge  advocate and an officer named Colonel Childs (a hot-headed fellow!),  took up their quarters in a French chateau somewhere, I think, in the  neighborhood of Creil. The Commander-in-Chief was in another chateau  some distance away. Other branches of G. H. Q. were billeted in private  houses, widely scattered about a straggling village.    Colonel Childs was writing opposite the adjutant-general, who was  working silently. Presently Childs looked up, listened, and said:    \"It's rather quiet, sir, outside.\"    \"So much the better,\" growled General Macready. \"Get on with your job.\"    A quarter of an hour passed. No rumble of traffic passed by the windows.  No gun-wagons were jolting over French pave.    Colonel Childs looked up again and listened.    \"It's damned quiet outside, sir.\"    \"Well, don't go making a noise,\" said the general, \"Can't you see I'm  busy?\"    \"I think I'll just take a turn round,\" said Colonel Childs.    He felt uneasy. Something in the silence of the village scared him. He  went out into the roadway and walked toward Sir John French's quarters.  There was no challenge from a sentry. The British Expeditionary Force  seemed to be sleeping. They needed sleep--poor beggars!--but the Germans  did not let them take much.    Colonel Childs went into the Commander-in-Chief's chateau and found a  soldier in the front hall, licking out a jam-pot.    \"Where's the Commander-in-Chief?\" asked the officer.    \"Gone hours ago, sir,\" said the soldier. \"I was left behind for lack  of transport. From what I hear the Germans ought to be here by now. I  rather fancy I heard some shots pretty close awhile ago.\"    Colonel Childs walked back to his own quarters quickly. He made no  apology for interrupting the work of the adjutant-general.    \"General, the whole box of tricks has gone. We've been left behind.  Forgotten!\"    \"The dirty dogs!\" said General Macready.    There was not much time for packing up, and only one motor-car, and only  one rifle. The general said he would look after the rifle, but Colonel  Childs said if that were so he would rather stay behind and take  his chance of being captured. It would be safer for him. So the  adjutant-general, the judge advocate, the deputy assistant judge  advocate (Colonel Childs), and an orderly or two packed into the car and  set out to find G.H.Q. Before they found it they had to run the gantlet  of Germans, and were sniped all the way through a wood, and took flying  shots at moving figures. Then, miles away, they found G.H.Q.    \"And weren't they sorry to see me again!\" said General Macready, who  told me the tale. \"They thought they had lost me forever.\"    The day's casualty list was brought into the adjutant--general one  evening when I was dining in his mess. The orderly put it down by the  side of his plate, and he interrupted a funny story to glance down the  columns of names.    \"Du Maurier has been killed... I'm sorry.\"    He put down the paper beside his plate again and continued his story,  and we all laughed heartily at the end of the anecdote. It was the only  way, and the soldier's way. There was no hugging of grief when our best  friend fell. A sigh, another ghost in one's life, and then, \"Carry on!\"          XVIII      Scores of times, hundreds of times, during the battles of the Somme,  I passed the headquarters of Gen. Sir Henry Rawlinson, commanding  the Fourth Army, and several times I met the army commander there  and elsewhere. One of my first meetings with him was extraordinarily  embarrassing to me for a moment or two. While he was organizing his  army, which was to be called, with unconscious irony, \"The Army  of Pursuit\"--the battles of the Somme were a siege rather than a  pursuit--he desired to take over the chateau at Tilques, in which the  war correspondents were then quartered. As we were paying for it  and liked it, we put up an opposition which was most annoying to his  A.D.C.'s, especially to one young gentleman of enormous wealth, haughty  manners, and a boyish intolerance of other people's interests, who had  looked over our rooms without troubling to knock at the doors, and then  said, \"This will suit us down to the ground.\" On my way back from the  salient one evening I walked up the drive in the flickering light of  summer eve, and saw two officers coming in my direction, one of whom I  thought I recognized as an old friend.    \"Hullo!\" I said, cheerily. \"You here again?\"    Then I saw that I was face to face with Sir Henry Rawlinson. He must  have been surprised, but dug me in the ribs in a genial way, and said,  \"Hullo, young feller!\"    He made no further attempt to \"pinch\" our quarters, but my familiar  method of address could not have produced that result.    His headquarters at Querrieux were in another old chateau on the  Amiens-Albert road, surrounded by pleasant fields through which a stream  wound its way. Everywhere the sign-boards were red, and a military  policeman, authorized to secure obedience to the rules thereon, slowed  down every motor-car on its way through the village, as though Sir Henry  Rawlinson lay sick of a fever, so anxious were his gestures and his  expression of \"Hush! do be careful!\"    The army commander seemed to me to have a roguish eye. He seemed to be  thinking to himself, \"This war is a rare old joke!\" He spoke habitually  of the enemy as \"the old Hun\" or \"old Fritz,\" in an affectionate,  contemptuous way, as a fellow who was trying his best but getting the  worst of it every time. Before the battles of the Somme I had a talk  with him among his maps, and found that I had been to many places in his  line which he did not seem to know. He could not find there very quickly  on his large-sized maps, or pretended not to, though I concluded that  this was \"camouflage,\" in case I might tell \"old Fritz\" that such  places existed. Like most of our generals, he had amazing, overweening  optimism. He had always got the enemy \"nearly beat,\" and he arranged  attacks during the Somme fighting with the jovial sense of striking  another blow which would lead this time to stupendous results. In the  early days, in command of the 7th Division, he had done well, and he was  a gallant soldier, with initiative and courage of decision and a quick  intelligence in open warfare. His trouble on the Somme was that  the enemy did not permit open warfare, but made a siege of it, with  defensive lines all the way back to Bapaume, and every hillock a  machine-gun fortress and every wood a death-trap. We were always  preparing for a \"break-through\" for cavalry pursuit, and the cavalry  were always being massed behind the lines and then turned back again,  after futile waiting, encumbering the roads. \"The bloodbath of the  Somme,\" as the Germans called it, was ours as well as theirs, and scores  of times when I saw the dead bodies of our men lying strewn over those  dreadful fields, after desperate and, in the end, successful attacks  through the woods of death--Mametz Wood, Delville Wood, Trones Wood,  Bernafay Wood, High Wood, and over the Pozieres ridge to Courcellette  and Martinpuich--I thought of Rawlinson in his chateau in Querrieux,  scheming out the battles and ordering up new masses of troops to the  great assault over the bodies of their dead... Well, it is not for  generals to sit down with their heads in their hands, bemoaning  slaughter, or to shed tears over their maps when directing battle. It  is their job to be cheerful, to harden their hearts against the casualty  lists, to keep out of the danger-zone unless their presence is strictly  necessary. But it is inevitable that the men who risk death daily, the  fighting-men who carry out the plans of the High Command and see no  sense in them, should be savage in their irony when they pass a peaceful  house where their doom is being planned, and green-eyed when they see  an army general taking a stroll in buttercup fields, with a jaunty young  A.D.C. slashing the flowers with his cane and telling the latest joke  from London to his laughing chief. As onlookers of sacrifice some of  us--I, for one--adopted the point of view of the men who were to die,  finding some reason in their hatred of the staffs, though they were  doing their job with a sense of duty, and with as much intelligence  as God had given them. Gen. Sir Henry Rawlinson was one of our best  generals, as may be seen by the ribbons on his breast, and in the last  phase commanded a real \"Army of Pursuit,\" which had the enemy on the  run, and broke through to Victory. It was in that last phase of open  warfare that Rawlinson showed his qualities of generalship and once  again that driving purpose which was his in the Somme battles, but  achieved only by prodigious cost of life.          XIX      Of General Allenby, commanding the Third Army before he was succeeded by  Gen. Sir Julian Byng and went to his triumph in Palestine, I knew very  little except by hearsay. He went by the name of \"The Bull,\" because  of his burly size and deep voice. The costly fighting that followed  the battle of Arras on April 9th along the glacis of the Scarpe did  not reveal high generalship. There were many young officers--and some"]]]
