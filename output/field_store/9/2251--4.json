Administration is carried out  through consultative member meetings--the last meeting was held in Madrid  (Spain) in April 1991.          Consultative (voting) members include seven nations that claim  portions of Antarctica as national territory (some claims overlap) and  nonclaimant nations. The US and other nations have made no claims, but  have reserved the right to claim territory. The US does not recognize the  claims of others. The year in parentheses indicates when an acceding  nation was voted to full consultative (voting) status, while no date  indicates an original 1959 treaty signatory. Claimant nations  are--Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and the  UK. Nonclaimant consultative nations are--Belgium, Brazil (1983),  China (1985), Ecuador (1990), Finland (1989), Germany (1981), India  (1983), Italy (1987), Japan, South Korea (1989), Netherlands (1990), Peru  (1989), Poland (1977), South Africa, Spain (1988), Sweden (1988), Uruguay  (1985), the US, and the USSR.          Acceding (nonvoting) members, with year of accession in parenthesis,  are--Austria (1987), Bulgaria (1978), Canada (1988), Colombia (1988),  Cuba (1984), Czechoslovakia (1962), Denmark (1965), Greece (1987),  Hungary (1984), North Korea (1987), Papua New Guinea (1981), Romania  (1971), and Switzerland (1990).          Antarctic Treaty Summary:    Article 1--area to be used for peaceful purposes only; military  activity, such as weapons testing, is prohibited, but military personnel  and equipment may be used for peaceful scientific and logistics purposes;    Article 2--freedom of scientific investigation and cooperation  shall continue;    Article 3--free exchange of information and personnel in  cooperation with the UN and other international agencies;    Article 4--does not recognize, dispute, or establish territorial  claims and no new claims shall be asserted while the treaty is in force;    Article 5--prohibits nuclear explosions or disposal of radioactive  wastes;    Article 6--includes under the treaty all land and ice shelves  south of 60o 00%19 south, but that the water areas be covered by  international law;    Article 7--treaty-state observers have free access, including  aerial observation, to any area and may inspect all stations,  installations, and equipment; advance notice of all activities  and the introduction of military personnel must be given;    Article 8--allows for jurisdiction over observers and scientists  by their own states;    Article 9--frequent consultative meetings take place among  member nations;    Article 10--treaty states will discourage activities by any  country in Antarctica that are contrary to the treaty;    Article 11--disputes to be settled peacefully by the parties  concerned or, ultimately, by the ICJ;    Articles 12, 13, 14--deal with upholding, interpreting, and  amending the treaty among involved nations.          Other agreements: more than 150 recommendations adopted at  treaty consultative meetings and ratified by governments  include--Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and  Flora (1964); Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (1972);  Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources  (1980); a mineral resources agreement was signed in 1988 but was  subsequently rejected by some signatories and is likely to be replaced in  1991 by a comprehensive environmental protection agreement that defers  minerals development for a long period.      _*_Economy  _#_Overview: No economic activity at present except for fishing off  the coast and small-scale tourism, both based abroad.

The subtlety with which  beauty and disease are united here, reaches such a height, that it casts  so to speak a shadow upon all Wagner's earlier achievements: it seems too  bright, too healthy. Do ye understand this? Health and brightness acting  like a shadow? Almost like an objection?{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} To this extent are we already  pure fools.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Never was there a greater Master in heavy hieratic  perfumes--Never on earth has there been such a connoisseur of paltry  infinities, of all that thrills, of extravagant excesses, of all the  feminism from out the vocabulary of happiness! My friends, do but drink  the philtres of this art! Nowhere will ye find a more pleasant method of  enervating your spirit, of forgetting your manliness in the shade of a  rosebush.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Ah, this old magician, mightiest of Klingsors; how he wages war  against us with his art, against us free spirits! How he appeals to every  form of cowardice of the modern soul with his charming girlish notes!  There never was such a _mortal hatred_ of knowledge! One must be a very  cynic in order to resist seduction here. One must be able to bite in order  to resist worshipping at this shrine. Very well, old seducer! The cynic  cautions you--_cave canem_.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}    One pays dearly for having been a follower of Wagner. I contemplate the  youthlets who have long been exposed to his infection. The first  relatively innocuous effect of it is the corruption of their taste. Wagner  acts like chronic recourse to the bottle. He stultifies, he befouls the  stomach. His specific effect: degeneration of the feeling for rhythm. What  the Wagnerite calls rhythmical is what I call, to use a Greek metaphor,  \"stirring a swamp.\" Much more dangerous than all this, however, is the  corruption of ideas. The youthlet becomes a moon-calf, an \"idealist\". He  stands above science, and in this respect he has reached the master's  heights. On the other hand, he assumes the airs of a philosopher, he  writes for the _Bayreuth Journal_; he solves all problems in the name of  the Father, the Son, and the Holy Master. But the most ghastly thing of  all is the deterioration of the nerves. Let any one wander through a large  city at night, in all directions he will hear people doing violence to  instruments with solemn rage and fury, a wild uproar breaks out at  intervals. What is happening? It is the disciples of Wagner in the act of  worshipping him.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Bayreuth is another word for a Hydro. A typical telegram  from Bayreuth would read _bereits bereut_ (I already repent). Wagner is  bad for young men; he is fatal for women. What medically speaking is a  female Wagnerite? It seems to me that a doctor could not be too serious in  putting this alternative of conscience to young women; either one thing or  the other. But they have already made their choice. You cannot serve two  Masters when one of these is Wagner. Wagner redeemed woman; and in return  woman built Bayreuth for him. Every sacrifice, every surrender: there was  nothing that they were not prepared to give him. Woman impoverishes  herself in favour of the Master, she becomes quite touching, she stands  naked before him. The female Wagnerite, the most attractive equivocality  that exists to-day: she is the incarnation of Wagner's cause: his cause  triumphs with her as its symbol.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Ah, this old robber! He robs our young  men: he even robs our women as well, and drags them to his cell.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Ah, this  old Minotaur! What has he not already cost us? Every year processions of  the finest young men and maidens are led into his labyrinth that he may  swallow them up, every year the whole of Europe cries out \"Away to Crete!  Away to Crete!\".{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}          Second Postscript      It seems to me that my letter is open to some misunderstanding. On certain  faces I see the expression of gratitude; I even hear modest but merry  laughter. I prefer to be understood here as in other things. But since a  certain animal, _the worm_ of Empire, the famous _Rhinoxera_, has become  lodged in the vineyards of the German spirit, nobody any longer  understands a word I say. The _Kreus-Zeitung_ has brought this home to me,  not to speak of the _Litterarisches Centralblatt_. I have given the  Germans the deepest books that they have ever possessed--a sufficient  reason for their not having understood a word of them.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} If in this essay I  declare war against Wagner--and incidentally against a certain form of  German taste, if I seem to use strong language about the cretinism of  Bayreuth, it must not be supposed that I am in the least anxious to  glorify any other musician. Other musicians are not to be considered by  the side of Wagner. Things are generally bad. Decay is universal. Disease  lies at the very root of things. If Wagner's name represents the ruin of  music, just as Bernini's stands for the ruin of sculpture, he is not on  that account its cause. All he did was to accelerate the fall,--though we  are quite prepared to admit that he did it in a way which makes one recoil  with horror from this almost instantaneous decline and fall to the depths.  He possessed the ingenuousness of decadence: this constituted his  superiority. He believed in it. He did not halt before any of its logical  consequences. The others hesitated--that is their distinction. They have no  other. What is common to both Wagner and \"the others\" consists in this:  the decline of all organising power, the abuse of traditional means,  without the capacity or the aim that would justify this. The counterfeit  imitation of grand forms, for which nobody nowadays is strong, proud,  self-reliant and healthy enough, excessive vitality in small details;  passion at all costs; refinement as an expression of impoverished life,  ever more nerves in the place of muscle. I know only one musician who  to-day would be able to compose an overture as an organic whole: and  nobody else knows him.(13) He who is famous now, does not write better  music than Wagner, but only less characteristic, less definite music:--less  definite, because half measures, even in decadence, cannot stand by the  side of completeness. But Wagner was complete, Wagner represented thorough  corruption, Wagner has had the courage, the will, and the conviction for  corruption. What does Johannes Brahms matter?{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} It was his good fortune to  be misunderstood by Germany; he was taken to be an antagonist of  Wagner--people required an antagonist!--But he did not write necessary  music, above all he wrote too much music!--When one is not rich one should  at least have enough pride to be poor!{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} The sympathy which here and there  was meted out to Brahms, apart from party interests and party  misunderstandings, was for a long time a riddle to me, until one day  through an accident, almost, I discovered that he affected a particular  type of man. He has the melancholy of impotence. His creations are not the  result of plenitude, he thirsts after abundance. Apart from what he  plagiarises, from what he borrows from ancient or exotically modern  styles--he is a master in the art of copying,--there remains as his most  individual quality a _longing_.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} And this is what the dissatisfied of all  kinds, and all those who yearn, divine in him. He is much too little of a  personality, too little of a central figure.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} The \"impersonal,\" those who  are not self-centred, love him for this. He is especially the musician of  a species of dissatisfied women. Fifty steps further on, and we find the  female Wagnerite--just as we find Wagner himself fifty paces ahead of  Brahms.--The female Wagnerite is a more definite, a more interesting, and  above all, a more attractive type. Brahms is touching so long as he dreams  or mourns over himself in private--in this respect he is modern;--he becomes  cold, we no longer feel at one with him when he poses as the child of the  classics.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} People like to call Brahms Beethoven's heir: I know of no more  cautious euphemism--All that which to-day makes a claim to being the grand  style in music is on precisely that account either false to us or false to  itself. This alternative is suspicious enough: in itself it contains a  casuistic question concerning the value of the two cases. The instinct of  the majority protests against the alternative; \"false to us\"--they do not  wish to be cheated;--and I myself would certainly always prefer this type  to the other (\"False to itself\"). This is _my_ taste.--Expressed more  clearly for the sake of the \"poor in spirit\" it amounts to this: Brahms  _or_ Wagner.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Brahms is _not_ an actor.--A very great part of other  musicians may be summed up in the concept Brahms--I do not wish to say  anything about the clever apes of Wagner, as for instance Goldmark: when  one has \"The Queen of Sheba\" to one's name, one belongs to a  menagerie,--one ought to put oneself on show.--Nowadays all things that can  be done well and even with a master hand are small. In this department  alone is honesty still possible. Nothing, however, can cure music as a  whole of its chief fault, of its fate, which is to be the expression of  general physiological contradiction,--which is, in fact, to be modern.    The best instruction, the most conscientious schooling, the most thorough  familiarity, yea, and even isolation, with the Old Masters,--all this only  acts as a palliative, or, more strictly speaking, has but an illusory  effect, because the first condition of the right thing is no longer in our  bodies; whether this first condition be the strong race of a Handel or the  overflowing animal spirits of a Rossini. Not everyone has the right to  every teacher: and this"]]]
