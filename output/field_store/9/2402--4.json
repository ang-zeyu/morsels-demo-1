And they couldn't either.  A couple more like that and I'll be a Grand Champion myself. But they're  digging holes for the crosses and there's the horn that the feast is  ready. This show is going to be really good.\"    They ate, hugely and with unmarred appetite, of the heaped food which  Nero had provided. They returned to their assigned places to see  crosses, standing as close together as they could be placed and each  bearing a suffering Christian, filling the whole vast expanse of the  arena.    And, if the truth must be told, those two men enjoyed thoroughly every  moment of that long and sickeningly horrible afternoon. They were the  hardest products of the hardest school the world has ever known: trained  rigorously to deal out death mercilessly at command; to accept death  unflinchingly at need. They should not and can not be judged by the  higher, finer standards of a softer, gentler day.    The afternoon passed; evening approached. All the gladiators then in  Rome assembled in the Claudian Grove, around tables creaking under their  loads of food and wine. Women, too, were there in profusion; women for  the taking and yearning to be taken; and the tide of revelry ran open,  wide, and high. Although all ate and apparently drank with abandon, most  of the wine was in fact wasted. And as the sky darkened, most of the  gladiators, one by one, began to get rid of their female companions upon  one pretext or another and to drift toward the road which separated the  festivities from the cloaked and curious throng of lookers-on.    At full dark, a red glare flared into the sky from Caesar's garden and  the gladiators, deployed now along the highway, dashed across it and  seemed to wrestle briefly with cloaked figures. Then armed,  more-or-less-armored men ran back to the scene of their reveling.  Swords, daggers, and gladii thrust, stabbed, and cut. Tables and benches  ran red; ground and grass grew slippery with blood.    The conspirators turned then and rushed toward the Emperor's brilliantly  torch-lit garden. Patroclus, however, was not in the van. He had had  trouble in finding a cuirass big enough for him to get into. He had been  delayed further by the fact that he had had to kill three strange  lanistae before he could get at his owner, the man he really wanted to  slay. He was therefore some little distance behind the other gladiators  when Petronius rushed up to him and seized him by the arm.    White and trembling, the noble was not now the exquisite Arbiter  Elegantiae; nor the imperturbable Augustian.    \"Patroclus! In the name of Bacchus, Patroclus, why do the men go there  now? No signal was given--I could not get to Nero!\"    \"What?\" the Thracian blazed. \"Vulcan and his fiends! It _was_ given--I  heard it myself! What went wrong?\"    \"Everything.\" Petronius licked his lips. \"I was standing right beside  him. No one else was near enough to interfere. It was--should have  been--easy. But after I got my knife out I couldn't move. It was his  _eyes_, Patroclus--I swear it, by the white breasts of Venus! He has the  evil eye--I couldn't move a muscle, I tell you! Then, although I didn't  want to, I turned and ran!\"    \"How did you find _me_ so quick?\"    \"I--I--I--don't know,\" the frantic Arbiter stuttered. \"I ran and ran,  and there you were. But what are we--you--going to do?\"    Patroclus' mind raced. He believed implicitly that Jupiter guarded him  personally. He believed in the other gods and goddesses of Rome. He more  than half believed in the multitudinous deities of Greece, of Egypt, and  even of Babylon. The other world was real and close; the evil eye only  one of the many inexplicable facts of every-day life. Nevertheless, in  spite of his credulity--or perhaps in part because of it--he also  believed firmly in himself; in his own powers. Wherefore he soon came to  a decision.    \"Jupiter, ward from me Ahenobarbus' evil eye!\" he called aloud, and  turned.    \"Where are you going?\" Petronius, still shaking, demanded.    \"To do the job _you_ swore to do, of course--to kill that bloated toad.  And then to give Tigellinus what I have owed him so long.\"    At full run, he soon overtook his fellows, and waded resistlessly into  the fray. He was Grand Champion Patroclus, working at his trade; the  hard-learned trade which he knew so well. No Praetorian or ordinary  soldier could stand before him save momentarily. He did not have all of  his Thracian armor, but he had enough. Man after man faced him, and man  after man died.    And Nero, sitting at ease with a beautiful boy at his right and a  beautiful harlot at his left, gazed appreciatively through his emerald  lens at the flaming torches; the while, with a very small fraction of  his Eddorian mind, he mused upon the matter of Patroclus and Tigellinus.    Should he let the Thracian kill the Commander of his Guard? Or not? It  didn't really matter, one way or the other. In fact, nothing about this  whole foul planet--this ultra-microscopic, if offensive, speck of cosmic  dust in the Eddorian Scheme of Things--really mattered at all. It would  be mildly amusing to watch the gladiator consummate his vengeance by  carving the Roman to bits. But, on the other hand, there was such a  thing as pride of workmanship. Viewed in that light, the Thracian could  not kill Tigellinus, because that bit of corruption had a few more jobs  to do. He must descend lower and lower into unspeakable depravity,  finally to cut his own throat with a razor. Although Patroclus would not  know it--it was better technique not to let him know it--the Thracian's  proposed vengeance would have been futility itself compared with that  which the luckless Roman was to wreak on himself.    Wherefore a shrewdly-placed blow knocked the helmet from Patroclus' head  and a mace crashed down, spattering his brains abroad.           *       *       *       *       *    Thus ended the last significant attempt to save the civilization of  Rome; in a fiasco so complete that even such meticulous historians as  Tacitus and Suetonius mention it merely as a minor disturbance of Nero's  garden party.           *       *       *       *       *    _The planet Tellus circled its sun some twenty hundred times. Sixty-odd  generations of men were born and died, but that was not enough. The  Arisian program of genetics required more. Therefore the Elders, after  due deliberation, agreed that that Civilization, too, must be allowed to  fall. And Gharlane of Eddore, recalled to duty from the middle of a  much-too-short vacation, found things in very bad shape indeed and went  busily to work setting them to rights. He had slain one fellow-member of  the Innermost Circle, but there might very well have been more than one  Master involved._          BOOK TWO    THE WORLD WAR          CHAPTER 4    1918      Sobbing furiously, Captain Ralph Kinnison wrenched at his stick--with  half of his control surfaces shot away the crate was hellishly logy. He  could step out, of course, the while saluting the victorious Jerries,  but he wasn't on fire--yet--and hadn't been hit--yet. He ducked and  flinched sidewise as another burst of bullets stitched another seam  along his riddled fuselage and whanged against his dead engine. Afire?  Not yet--good! Maybe he could land the heap, after all!    Slowly--oh, _so_ sluggishly--the Spad began to level off, toward the  edge of the wheatfield and that friendly, inviting ditch. If the krauts  didn't get him with their next pass....    He heard a chattering beneath him--Brownings, by God!--and the expected  burst did not come. He knew that he had been just about over the front  when they conked his engine; it was a toss-up whether he would come down  in enemy territory or not. But now, for the first time in ages, it  seemed, there were machine-guns going that were not aimed at him!    His landing-gear swished against stubble and he fought with all his  strength of body and of will to keep the Spad's tail down. He almost  succeeded; his speed was almost spent when he began to nose over. He  leaped, then, and as he struck ground he curled up and rolled--he had  been a motorcycle racer for years--feeling as he did so a wash of heat:  a tracer had found his gas-tank at last! Bullets were thudding into the  ground; one shrieked past his head as, stooping over, folded into the  smallest possible target, he galloped awkwardly toward the ditch.    The Brownings still yammered, filling the sky with cupro-nickeled lead;  and while Kinnison was flinging himself full length into the protecting  water and mud, he heard a tremendous crash. One of those Huns had been  too intent on murder; had stayed a few seconds too long; had come a few  meters too close.    The clamor of the guns stopped abruptly.    \"We got one! We got one!\" a yell of exultation.    \"Stay down! Keep low, you boneheads!\" roared a voice of authority, quite  evidently a sergeant's. \"Wanna get your blocks shot off? Take down them  guns; we gotta get to hell out of here. Hey, you flyer! Are you O.K., or  wounded, or maybe dead?\"    Kinnison spat out mud until he could talk. \"O.K.!\" he shouted, and  started to lift an eye above the low bank. He stopped, however, as  whistling metal, sheeting in from the north, told him that such action  would be decidedly unsafe. \"But I ain't leaving this ditch right  now--sounds mighty hot out there!\"    \"You said it, brother. It's hotter than the hinges of hell, from behind  that ridge over there. But ooze down that ditch a piece, around the  first bend. It's pretty well in the clear there, and besides, you'll  find a ledge of rocks running straight across the flat. Cross over there  and climb the hill--join us by that dead snag up there.

When Arabs--and they are the only class of people who would do such  a deed--found a European going into the very middle of their secret  trading-places, where such large profits were to be obtained, they would  never suppose that the scientific Maizan went for any other purpose than  to pry into their ivory stores, bring others into the field after him,  and destroy their monopoly. The Sultan of Zanzibar, in those days, was  our old ally Said Said, commonly called the Emam of Muscat; and our  Consul, Colonel Hamerton, had been M. Maizan's host as long as he lived  upon the coast. Both the Emam and Consul were desirous of seeing the  country surveyed, and did everything in their power to assist Maizan,  the former even appointing the Indian Musa to conduct him safely as  far as Unyamuezi; but their power was not found sufficient to damp the  raging fire of jealousy in the ivory-trader's heart. Musa commenced the  journey with Maizan, and they travelled together a march or two,  when one of Maizan's domestic establishment fell sick and stopped his  progress. Musa remained with him eight or ten days, to his own loss in  trade and expense in keeping up a large establishment, and then they  parted by mutual consent, Maizan thinking himself quite strong enough  to take care of himself. This separation was, I believe, poor Maizan's  death-blow. His power, on the Emam's side, went with Musa's going, and  left the Arabs free to carry out their wicked wills.    The presents I had to give here were one sahari and eight yards merikani  to Hembe, and the same to Darunga, for which they gave a return in  grain. Still following close to the river--which, unfortunately, is so  enshrouded with thick bush that we could seldom see it--a few of the  last villages in Uzaramo were passed. Here antelopes reappear amongst  the tall mimosa, but we let them alone in prosecution of the survey, and  finally encamped opposite the little hill of Kidunda, which lying on the  left bank of the Kingani, stretches north, a little east, into Uzegura.  The hill crops out through pisolitic limestone, in which marine fossils  were observable. It would be interesting to ascertain whether this lime  formation extends down the east coast of Africa from the Somali country,  where also, on my first expedition, I found marine shells in the  limestone, especially as a vast continuous band of limestone is known  to extend from the Tagus, through Egypt and the Somali country, to the  Burrumputra. To obtain food it was necessary here to ferry the river and  purchase from the Wazaramo, who, from fear of the passing caravans,  had left their own bank and formed a settlement immediately under this  pretty little hill--rendered all the more enchanting to our eyes, as it  was the first we had met since leaving the sea-coast. The Diwan, or head  man, was a very civil creature; he presented us freely with two fine  goats--a thing at that time we were very much in want of--and took, in  return, without any comments, one dubani and eight yards merikani.    The next day, as we had no further need of our Beluch escort, a halt  was made to enable me to draw up a \"Progress Report,\" and pack all  the specimens of natural history collected on the way, for the Royal  Geographical Society. Captain Grant, taking advantage of the spare time,  killed for the larder two buck antelopes, and the Tots brought in, in  high excited triumph, a famous pig.    This march, which declines from the Kingani a little, leads through  rolling, jungly ground, full of game, to the tributary stream Mgeta. It  is fordable in the dry season, but has to be bridged by throwing a tree  across it in the wet one. Rising in the Usagara hills to the west of the  hog-backed Mkambaku, this branch intersects the province of Ukhutu in  the centre, and circles round until it unites with the Kingani about  four miles north of the ford. Where the Kingani itself rises, I never  could find out; though I have heard that its sources lies in a gurgling  spring on the eastern face of the Mkambaku, by which account the Mgeta  is made the longer branch of the two.          Chapter III. Usagara    Nature of the Country--Resumption of the March--A Hunt--Bombay  and Baraka--The Slave-Hunters--The Ivory-Merchants--Collection of  Natural-History Specimens--A Frightened Village--Tracking a Mule.    Under U-Sagara, or, as it might be interpreted, U-sa-Gara--country of  Gara--is included all the country lying between the bifurcation of  the Kingani and Mgeta rivers east, and Ugogo, the first country on the  interior plateau west,--a distance of a hundred miles. On the north it  is bounded by the Mukondokua, or upper course of the Wami river and on  the south by the Ruaha, or northern great branch of the Lufiji river. It  forms a link of the great East Coast Range; but though it is generally  comprehended under the single name Usagara, many sub-tribes occupy and  apply their own names to portions of it; as, for instance, the people  on whose ground we now stood at the foot of the hills, are Wa-Khutu,  and their possessions consequently are U-Khutu, which is by far the best  producing land hitherto alluded to since leaving the sea-coast line. Our  ascent by the river, though quite imperceptible to the eye, has been 500  feet. From this level the range before us rises in some places to 5000  to 6000 feet, not as one grand mountain, but in two detached lines,  lying at an angle of 45 degrees from N.E. to S.W., and separated one  from the other by elevated valleys, tables, and crab-claw spurs of hill  which incline towards the flanking rivers. The whole having been thrown  up by volcanic action, is based on a strong foundation of granite and  other igneous rocks, which are exposed in many places in the shape of  massive blocks; otherwise the hill-range is covered in the upper part  with sandstone, and in the bottoms with alluvial clay. This is the  superficial configuration of the land as it strikes the eye; but,  knowing the elevation of the interior plateau to be only 2500 feet above  the sea immediately on the western flank of these hills, whilst the  breath of the chain is 100 miles, the mean slope of incline of the basal  surface must be on a gradual rise of twenty feet per mile. The hill tops  and sides, where not cultivated, are well covered with bush and small  trees, amongst which the bamboo is conspicuous; whilst the bottoms,  having a soil deeper and richer, produce fine large fig-trees of  exceeding beauty, the huge calabash, and a variety of other trees. Here,  in certain places where water is obtainable throughout the year, and  wars, or slave-hunts more properly speaking, do not disturb the industry  of the people, cultivation thrives surprisingly; but such a boon is  rarely granted them. It is in consequence of these constantly-recurring  troubles that the majority of the Wasagara villages are built on  hill-spurs, where the people can the better resist attack, or, failing,  disperse and hide effectually. The normal habitation is the small  conical hut of grass. These compose villages, varying in number  according to the influence of their head men. There are, however, a few  mud villages on the table-lands, each built in a large irregular square  of chambers with a hollow yard in the centre, known as tembe.    As to the people of these uplands, poor, meagre-looking wretches, they  contrast unfavourably with the lowlanders on both sides of them. Dingy  in colour, spiritless, shy, and timid, they invite attack in a country  where every human being has a market value, and are little seen by the  passing caravan. In habits they are semi-pastoral agriculturalists, and  would be useful members of society were they left alone to cultivate  their own possessions, rich and beautiful by nature, but poor and  desolate by force of circumstance. Some of the men can afford a cloth,  but the greater part wear an article which I can only describe as a  grass kilt. In one or two places throughout the passage of these hills  a caravan may be taxed, but if so, only to a small amount; the villagers  more frequently fly to the hill-tops as soon as the noise of the  advancing caravan is heard, and no persuasions will bring them down  again, so much ground have they, from previous experience, to fear  treachery. It is such sad sights, and the obvious want of peace and  prosperity, that weary the traveller, and make him every think of  pushing on to his journey's end from the instant he enters Africa until  he quits the country.    Knowing by old experience that the beautiful green park in the fork of  these rivers abounded in game of great variety and in vast herds, where  no men are ever seen except some savage hunters sitting in the trees  with poisoned arrows, or watching their snares and pitfalls, I had all  along determined on a hunt myself, to feed and cheer the men, and also  to collect some specimens for the home museums. In the first object we  succeeded well, as \"the bags\" we made counted two brindled gnu, four  water-boc, one pallah-boc, and one pig,--enough to feed abundantly the  whole camp round. The feast was all the better relished as the men knew  well that no Arab master would have given them what he could sell; for  if a slave shot game, the animals would be the master's, to be sold bit  by bit among the porters, and compensated from the proceeds of their  pay. In the variety and number of our game we were disappointed, partly  because so many wounded got away, and partly because we could not find  what we knew the park to contain, in addition to what we killed--namely,  elephants, rhinoceros, giraffes, buffaloes, zebra, and many varieties of  antelopes, besides lions and hyenas. In fact, \"the park,\" as well as all  the adjacent land at the foot of the hills, "]]]
