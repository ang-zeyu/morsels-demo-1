[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28897"],[0,"The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication, Volume II (of 2) (#10)"],[1," No careful      description has been given of the feral goat. Dogs which have run wild      in various countries have hardly anywhere assumed a uniform character;      but they are probably descended from several domestic races, and      aboriginally from several distinct species. Feral cats, both in Europe      and La Plata, are regularly striped; in some cases they have grown to      an unusually large size, but do not differ from the domestic animal in      any other character. When variously-coloured tame rabbits are turned      out in Europe, they generally reacquire the colouring of the wild      animal; there can be no doubt that this does really occur, but we      should remember that oddly-coloured and conspicuous animals would      suffer much from beasts of prey and from being easily shot; this at      least was the opinion of a gentleman who tried to stock his woods with      a nearly white variety; and when thus destroyed, they would in truth be      supplanted by, instead of being transformed into, the common rabbit. We      have seen that the feral rabbits of Jamaica, and especially of Porto      Santo, have assumed new colours and other new characters. The best      known case of reversion, and that on which the widely-spread belief in      its universality apparently rests, is that of pigs. These animals have      run wild in the West Indies, South America, and the Falkland Islands,      and have everywhere acquired the dark colour, the thick bristles, and      great tusks of the wild boar; and the young have reacquired      longitudinal stripes. But even in the case of the pig, Roulin describes      the half-wild animals in different parts of South America as differing      in several respects. In Louisiana the pig[76] has run wild, and is said      to differ a little in form, and much in colour, from the domestic      animal, yet does not closely resemble the wild boar of Europe. With      pigeons and fowls,[77] it is not known what variety was first turned      out, nor what character the feral birds have assumed. The guinea-fowl      in the West Indies, when feral, seems to vary more than in the      domesticated state.        With respect to plants run wild, Dr. Hooker[78] has strongly insisted      on what slight evidence the common belief in their power of reversion      rests. Godron[79] describes wild turnips, carrots, and celery; but      these plants in their cultivated state hardly differ from their wild      prototypes, except in the {34} succulency and enlargement of certain      parts,--characters which would be surely lost by plants growing in a      poor soil and struggling with other plants. No cultivated plant has run      wild on so enormous a scale as the cardoon (_Cynara cardunculus_) in La      Plata. Every botanist who has seen it growing there, in vast beds, as      high as a horse's back, has been struck with its peculiar appearance;      but whether it differs in any important point from the cultivated      Spanish form, which is said not to be prickly like its American      descendant, or whether it differs from he wild Mediterranean species,      which is said not to be social, I do not know.           *       *       *       *       *    _Reversion to Characters derived from a Cross, in the case of  Sub-varieties, Races, and Species._--When an individual having some  recognizable peculiarity unites with another of the same sub-variety, not  having the peculiarity in question, it often reappears in the descendants  after an interval of several generations. Every one must have noticed, or  heard from old people of children closely resembling in appearance or  mental disposition, or in so small and complex a character as expression,  one of their grandparents, or some more distant collateral relation. Very  many anomalies of structure and diseases,[80] of which instances have been  given in the last chapter, have come into a family from one parent, and  have reappeared in the progeny after passing over two or three generations.  The following case has been communicated to me on good authority, and may,  I believe, be fully trusted: a pointer-bitch produced seven puppies; four  were marked with blue and white, which is so unusual a colour with pointers  that she was thought to have played false with one of the greyhounds, and  the whole litter was condemned; but the gamekeeper was permitted to save  one as a curiosity. Two years afterwards a friend of the owner saw the  young dog, and declared that he was the image of his old pointer-bitch  Sappho, the only blue and white pointer of pure descent which he had ever  seen. This led to close inquiry, and it was proved that he was the  great-great-grandson of Sappho; so that, according to the common  expression, he had only 1-16th of her blood in his veins. Here it can  hardly be doubted that a character derived from a cross with an individual  of the same variety reappeared after passing over three generations.    {35}    When two distinct races are crossed, it is notorious that the tendency in  the offspring to revert to one or both parent-forms is strong, and endures  for many generations. I have myself seen the clearest evidence of this in  crossed pigeons and with various plants. Mr. Sidney[81] states that, in a  litter of Essex pigs, two young ones appeared which were the image of the  Berkshire boar that had been used twenty-eight years before in giving size  and constitution to the breed. I observed in the farmyard at Betley Hall  some fowls showing a strong likeness to the Malay breed, and was told by  Mr. Tollet that he had forty years before crossed his birds with Malays;  and that, though he had at first attempted to get rid of this strain, he  had subsequently given up the attempt in despair, as the Malay character  would reappear.    This strong tendency in crossed breeds to revert has given rise to endless  discussions in how many generations after a single cross, either with a  distinct breed or merely with an inferior animal, the breed may be  considered as pure, and free from all danger of reversion. No one supposes  that less than three generations suffices, and most breeders think that  six, seven, or eight are necessary, and some go to still greater  lengths.[82] But neither in the case of a breed which has been contaminated  by a single cross, nor when, in the attempt to form an intermediate breed,  half-bred animals have been matched together during many generations, can  any rule be laid down how soon the tendency to reversion will be  obliterated. It depends on the difference in the strength or prepotency of  transmission in the two parent-forms, on their actual amount of difference,  and on the nature of the conditions of life to which the crossed offspring  are exposed. But we must be careful not to confound these cases of  reversion to characters gained from a cross, with those given under the  first class, in which characters originally common to _both_ parents, but  lost at some former period, reappear; for such characters may recur after  an almost indefinite number of generations.    {36}    The law of reversion is equally powerful with hybrids, when they are  sufficiently fertile to breed together, or when they are repeatedly crossed  with either pure parent-form, as with mongrels. It is not necessary to give  instances, for in the case of plants almost every one who has worked on  this subject from the time of Koelreuter to the present day has insisted on  this tendency. Gaertner has recorded some good instances; but no one has  given more striking cases than Naudin.[83] The tendency differs in degree  or strength in different groups, and partly depends, as we shall presently  see, on the fact of the parent-plants having been long cultivated. Although  the tendency to reversion is extremely general with nearly all mongrels and  hybrids, it cannot be considered as invariably characteristic of them;  there is, also, reason to believe that it may be mastered by long-continued  selection; but these subjects will more properly be discussed in a future  chapter on Crossing. From what we see of the power and scope of reversion,  both in pure races and when varieties or species are crossed, we may infer  that characters of almost every kind are capable of reappearance after  having been lost for a great length of time. But it does not follow from  this that in each particular case certain characters will reappear: for  instance, this will not occur when a race is crossed with another endowed  with prepotency of transmission. In some few cases the power of reversion  wholly fails, without our being able to assign any cause for the failure:  thus it has been stated that in a French family in which 85 out of above  600 members, during six generations, had been subject to night-blindness,  \"there has not been a single example of this affection in the children of  parents who were themselves free from it.\"[84]           *       *       *       *       *    _Reversion through Bud-propagation--Partial Reversion, by segments in the  same flower or fruit, or in different parts of the {37} body in the same  individual animal._--In the eleventh chapter, many cases of reversion by  buds, independently of seminal generation, were given--as when a leaf-bud  on a variegated, curled, or laciniated variety suddenly reassumes its  proper character; or as when a Provence-rose appears on a moss-rose, or a  peach on a nectarine-tree. In some of these cases only half the flower or  fruit, or a smaller segment, or mere stripes, reassumed their former  character; and here we have with buds reversion by segments. Vilmorin[85]  has also recorded several cases with plants derived from seed, of flowers  reverting by stripes or blotches to their primitive colours: he states that  in all such cases a white or pale-coloured variety must first be formed,  and, when this is propagated for a length of time by seed, striped"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2892"],[0,"Irish Fairy Tales (#10)"],[1," who were present bound themselves to the fulfilment of the  bargain.    Fionn marched from the banqueting hall, and as he went, all who were  present of nobles and retainers and servants acclaimed him and wished  him luck. But in their hearts they were bidding him good-bye, for all  were assured that the lad was marching to a death so unescapeable that  he might already be counted as a dead man.    It is likely that Fionn looked for help to the people of the Shi'  themselves, for, through his mother, he belonged to the tribes of Dana,  although, on the father's side, his blood was well compounded with  mortal clay. It may be, too, that he knew how events would turn, for he  had eaten the Salmon of Knowledge. Yet it is not recorded that on this  occasion he invoked any magical art as he did on other adventures.    Fionn's way of discovering whatever was happening and hidden was always  the same and is many times referred to. A shallow, oblong dish of pure,  pale gold was brought to him. This dish was filled with clear water.  Then Fionn would bend his head and stare into the water, and as he  stared he would place his thumb in his mouth under his \"Tooth of  Knowledge,\" his \"wisdom tooth.\"    Knowledge, may it be said, is higher than magic and is more to be  sought. It is quite possible to see what is happening and yet not know  what is forward, for while seeing is believing it does not follow that  either seeing or believing is knowing. Many a person can see a thing and  believe a thing and know just as little about it as the person who does  neither. But Fionn would see and know, or he would under-stand a decent  ratio of his visions. That he was versed in magic is true, for he was  ever known as the Knowledgeable man, and later he had two magicians  in his household named Dirim and mac-Reith to do the rough work of  knowledge for their busy master.    It was not from the Shi', however, that assistance came to Fionn.        CHAPTER XIII    He marched through the successive fortifications until he came to the  outer, great wall, the boundary of the city, and when he had passed this  he was on the wide plain of Tara.    Other than himself no person was abroad, for on the night of the Feast  of Samhain none but a madman would quit the shelter of a house even if  it were on fire; for whatever disasters might be within a house would be  as nothing to the calamities without it.    The noise of the banquet was not now audible to Fionn--it is possible,  however, that there was a shamefaced silence in the great hall--and the  lights of the city were hidden by the successive great ramparts. The sky  was over him; the earth under him; and than these there was nothing, or  there was but the darkness and the wind.    But darkness was not a thing to terrify him, bred in the nightness of  a wood and the very fosterling of gloom; nor could the wind afflict his  ear or his heart. There was no note in its orchestra that he had not  brooded on and become, which becoming is magic. The long-drawn moan of  it; the thrilling whisper and hush; the shrill, sweet whistle, so thin  it can scarcely be heard, and is taken more by the nerves than by the  ear; the screech, sudden as a devil's yell and loud as ten thunders; the  cry as of one who flies with backward look to the shelter of leaves and  darkness; and the sob as of one stricken with an age-long misery, only  at times remembered, but remembered then with what a pang! His ear  knew by what successions they arrived, and by what stages they grew and  diminished. Listening in the dark to the bundle of noises which make a  noise he could disentangle them and assign a place and a reason to each  gradation of sound that formed the chorus: there was the patter of a  rabbit, and there the scurrying of a hare; a bush rustled yonder,  but that brief rustle was a bird; that pressure was a wolf, and this  hesitation a fox; the scraping yonder was but a rough leaf against bark,  and the scratching beyond it was a ferret's claw.    Fear cannot be where knowledge is, and Fionn was not fearful.    His mind, quietly busy on all sides, picked up one sound and dwelt on  it. \"A man,\" said Fionn, and he listened in that direction, back towards  the city.    A man it was, almost as skilled in darkness as Fionn himself \"This is no  enemy,\" Fionn thought; \"his walking is open.\"    \"Who comes?\" he called.    \"A friend,\" said the newcomer.    \"Give a friend's name,\" said Fionn.    \"Fiacuil mac Cona,\" was the answer.    \"Ah, my pulse and heart!\" cried Fionn, and he strode a few paces to meet  the great robber who had fostered him among the marshes.    \"So you are not afraid,\" he said joyfully.    \"I am afraid in good truth,\" Fiacuil whispered, \"and the minute my  business with you is finished I will trot back as quick as legs will  carry me. May the gods protect my going as they protected my coming,\"  said the robber piously.    \"Amen,\" said Fionn, \"and now, tell me what you have come for?\"    \"Have you any plan against this lord of the Shl?\" Fiacuil whispered.    \"I will attack him,\" said Fionn.    \"That is not a plan,\" the other groaned, \"we do not plan to deliver an  attack but to win a victory.\"    \"Is this a very terrible person?\" Fionn asked.    \"Terrible indeed. No one can get near him or away from him. He comes out  of the Shi' playing sweet, low music on a timpan and a pipe, and all who  hear this music fall asleep.\"    \"I will not fall asleep,\" said Fionn.    \"You will indeed, for everybody does.\"    \"What happens then?\" Fionn asked.    \"When all are asleep Aillen mac Midna blows a dart of fire out of his  mouth, and everything that is touched by that fire is destroyed, and he  can blow his fire to an incredible distance and to any direction.\"    \"You are very brave to come to help me,\" Fionn murmured, \"especially  when you are not able to help me at all.\"    \"I can help,\" Fiacuil replied, \"but I must be paid.\"    \"What payment?\"    \"A third of all you earn and a seat at your council.\"    \"I grant that,\" said Fionn, \"and now, tell me your plan?\"    \"You remember my spear with the thirty rivets of Arabian gold in its  socket?\"    \"The one,\" Fionn queried, \"that had its head wrapped in a blanket and  was stuck in a bucket of water and was chained to a wall as well--the  venomous Birgha?\" \"That one,\" Fiacuil replied.    \"It is Aillen mac Midna's own spear,\" he continued, \"and it was taken  out of his Shi' by your father.\"    \"Well?\" said Fionn, wondering nevertheless where Fiacuil got the spear,  but too generous to ask.    \"When you hear the great man of the Shi' coming, take the wrappings off  the head of the spear and bend your face over it; the heat of the spear,  the stench of it, all its pernicious and acrid qualities will prevent  you from going to sleep.\"    \"Are you sure of that?\" said Fionn.    \"You couldn't go to sleep close to that stench; nobody could,\" Fiacuil  replied decidedly.    He continued: \"Aillen mac Midna will be off his guard when he stops  playing and begins to blow his fire; he will think everybody is asleep;  then you can deliver the attack you were speaking of, and all good luck  go with it.\"    \"I will give him back his spear,\" said Fionn.    \"Here it is,\" said Fiacuil, taking the Birgha from under his cloak. \"But  be as careful of it, my pulse, be as frightened of it as you are of the  man of Dana.\"    \"I will be frightened of nothing,\" said Fionn, \"and the only person I  will be sorry for is that Aillen mac Midna, who is going to get his own  spear back.\"    \"I will go away now,\" his companion whispered, \"for it is growing darker  where you would have thought there was no more room for darkness, and  there is an eerie feeling abroad which I do not like. That man from the  Shi' may come any minute, and if I catch one sound of his music I am  done for.\"    The robber went away and again Fionn was alone.        CHAPTER XIV    He listened to the retreating footsteps until they could be heard no  more, and the one sound that came to his tense ears was the beating of  his own heart.    Even the wind had ceased, and there seemed to be nothing in the world  but the darkness and himself. In that gigantic blackness, in that unseen  quietude and vacancy, the mind could cease to be personal to itself. It  could be overwhelmed and merged in space, so that consciousness would  be transferred or dissipated, and one might sleep standing; for the mind  fears loneliness more than all else, and will escape to the moon rather  than be driven inwards on its own being.    But Fionn was not lonely, and he was not afraid when the son of Midna  came.    A long stretch of the silent night had gone by, minute following minute  in a slow sequence, wherein as there was no change there was no time;  wherein there was no past and no future, but a stupefying, endless  present which is almost the annihilation of consciousness. A change  came then, for the clouds had also been moving and the moon at last was  sensed behind them--not as a radiance, but as a percolation of light,  a gleam that was strained through matter after matter and was less than  the very wraith or remembrance of itself; a thing seen so narrowly,  so sparsely, that the eye could doubt if it was or was not seeing, and  might conceive that its own memory was re-creating that which was still  absent.    But Fionn's eye was the eye of a wild creature that spies on darkness  and moves there wittingly. He saw, then, not a thing but a movement;  something that was darker than the darkness it loomed on; not a being  but a presence, and, as it were, impending pressure. And in a little he  heard the deliberate pace of that great being.    Fionn bent to his spear and unloosed its coverings.    Then from the darkness there came another sound; a low, sweet sound;  thrillingly joyous, thrillingly low; so low the ear could scarcely note  it, so sweet the ear wished to catch nothing else and would strive to  hear it rather than all sounds that"]]]
