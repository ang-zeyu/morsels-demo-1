Lord Lansdowne had heard from Lord Cromer, who favored  the sending of a small commission to the Sinai Peninsula to report on  conditions and prospects, but Lord Cromer feared that no sanguine  hopes of success should be entertained, but if the report of the  Commission turned out favorable, the Egyptian Government would  certainly offer liberal terms for Jewish colonization.    On the other hand, however, the Zionists should understand that they  would be expected to meet the cost of a defense corps and to guarantee  the administration. In Lord Cromer's opinion, the most important  question was that of the rights which Herzl expected for the projected  settlement. He wrote: \"In your letter of the 12th ult. you remark that  you will become great and promising by the granting of this right of  colonization. Your letter does not make clear what is to be understood  by these words, and what kind of rights the colonists will expect.\"    Lord Lansdowne also touched on the question of the new citizenship of  the settlers. Herzl had believed that he would have only Englishmen to  deal with, since England had become more and more the master of Egypt.  It was apparent, however, that the Egyptian Government also played an  important part in the discussions.    Lord Cromer confirmed that the Egyptian Government would make it an  essential condition that the new settlers become Turkish subjects  bound by Egyptian law, but while the British occupation continued the  settlers would always be certain of fair treatment.    Herzl was satisfied with this letter and described it as a historic  document. The British Government had recognized Herzl as the Zionist  leader, and the movement represented by him as a negotiating party. He  already saw the \"Egyptian province of Judea\" under a Jewish Governor,  with its own defense corps under Anglo-Egyptian officers.    As a result of the English negotiations, Lord Rothschild seemed to be  won over by Herzl. The old banker, who had refused two years before to  meet the Zionist leader, now visited him in his hotel. The next task  before Herzl was the organization of the Commission. The Commission  was composed of the South African engineer, Kessler; the Chief  Inspector of the Egyptian Survey Department, Humphreys; Col. Goldsmith  was to report on the land; and Dr. Soskin was to study agricultural  possibilities. Oscar Marmorek was to investigate building and housing  problems and act as General Secretary. Dr. Hillel Jaffe of the Jaffe  Hospital was to deal with the problems of climate and hygiene.    The Commission met with great difficulties. There was opposition by  the Turks. There was misunderstandings between Herzl and Greenberg.  Herzl himself went to Egypt in order to bring the negotiations to a  conclusion and to straighten out difficulties. His intervention in no  way improved the situation. Lord Cromer had become very cool toward  him. He received the general report of the Commission, which observed  that \"under existing conditions the land is quite unsuitable for  settlers from European countries, but if sufficient irrigation were  introduced, the agricultural, hygienic and climatic conditions are  such that part of the land, which is at present wilderness, could  support a considerable population.\"    An application for the concession was made by Herzl on the advice of  Lord Cromer, having as his legal representative a Belgian lawyer of  high standing. The Egyptian Government did not receive with favor the  outline of the concession. Herzl was received on April 23rd by  Chamberlain, who had just returned from his African journey.  Chamberlain listened to the report given by Herzl on the work of the  Commission. Both regarded the report as unfavorable. Then Chamberlain  made this remark:    \"On my travels I saw a country for you, Uganda. On the coast it is  hot, but in the interior the climate is excellent for Europeans. You  can plant cotton and sugar. I thought to myself, that is just the  country for Dr. Herzl. But _he_ must have Palestine, and will move  only into its vicinity.\"    This was the first reference to Uganda which became the center of  attention in Zionist circles.    Herzl was told that the Egyptian Government would reject the plan. It  was found that the area would require five times as much water as had  been first estimated. The Egyptian Government could not permit the  diversion of such a quantity of water from the Nile.    An attempt to have Chamberlain intervene with Egypt was not  successful. \"That being the case,\" said Chamberlain, \"What about  Uganda?\" Self-administration would be accorded. The Governor could  definitely be a Jew. Although the matter belonged to the Foreign  Office, he would have it transferred under his jurisdiction in the  colonial office. The territory would be the permanent property of a  colonization company created for the purpose. After five years, the  settlers would be given complete autonomy. The name of the settlement  was to be \"New Palestine.\"    Herzl pressed for a reply from the government in order that the  project might be presented to the Zionist Congress on August 14, 1903.  The official proposal came from Sir Clement Hill, permanent head of  the Foreign Office. In this letter it was stated that Lord Landsdowne  had studied the question with the interest which His Majesty's  Government always felt bound to take in every serious plan destined to  better the condition of the Jewish race. The time had been too short  for a closer examination of the plan and for its submission to the  British representative for the East African (Uganda) Protectorate.  \"Lord Landsdowne assumes,\" the letter continues, \"that the Bank  desires to send a number of gentlemen to the East African Protectorate  to establish whether there is in that territory land suitable for the  purpose in view; should this prove to be the case, he will be happy to  give them every assistance in bringing them together with His  Majesty's Congress, the conditions under which the settlement could be  carried out. Should an area be found which the bank and His Majesty's  representative consider suitable, and His Majesty's government  consider desirable, Lord Lansdowne will be glad to consider favorably  proposals for the creation of a Jewish colony or settlement under such  conditions as will seem to the members to guarantee the retention of  their national customs....\"    The document went on with an offer--subject to the consent of the  relevant officials--of a Jewish governorship and internal autonomy.    This was the first official proposal in connection with the Zionist  movement which Herzl was able to submit to a Zionist Congress. When  the letter of Sir Clement Hill was submitted to the Sixth Zionist  Congress in 1903, it split the Zionist movement wide open. It arrayed  the overwhelming majority of Zionists in Russia against Herzl and he  was called upon to defend himself against a general attack which  preceded the convening of the Congress. When the Congress was convened  in an atmosphere of great excitement and partisan controversy, the  Uganda project was submitted in the form of an official resolution  calling for the appointment of a commission of nine to be sent to  investigate conditions in East Africa. The final decision on the  report of the investigating committee was to be left to a special  Congress. Although the vote showed a majority in favor of the official  resolution--the tally was 295 for, 177 against, and 100 absentees--the  debate on the resolution revealed an overwhelming opposition to the  project. It was regarded as an abandonment of Palestine in favor of a  diversion. After the vote, the Russian delegates left the Congress in  a body. All the opposition delegates left with them and met in  conference to discuss the situation. When Herzl heard of the deep  feeling that prevailed in the conference, he asked for the privilege  of speaking to the opposition. He gave them his solemn assurance that  the Basle Program would be unaffected by the resolution. He swore  fealty to the Basle Program, to Zion and Jerusalem. His speech  revealed the great transformation that had taken place in Herzl's  organic relation to the Zionist movement. The opposition delegates  felt that in spite of Herzl's seeking alternately one or another  substitute for Palestine, his heart responded without reserve to the  appeal of Zion. The opposition reappeared in the Congress the  following day. They exacted assurances that the funds of the Jewish  Colonial Trust, of the Jewish National Fund and the Shekel Income,  should not be used for the commission investigating East Africa, and  that the commission should report to the Greater Actions Committee  before it appeared to submit its report to the Congress.    Herzl's experience at what is called the \"Uganda Congress\" drew him  nearer to the older Zionists. He realized now that the ultimate goal  could not be reached within the near future, that Uganda was merely a  compromise achievement, providing the field of preparation for a  second attempt to reach Zion. The Congress of 1903 was the climax of  Herzl's career. It was, in effect, the end of his quest.    Later, the East African project became a matter of lesser importance  in the eyes of the English. The English colonists in East Africa  declared their opposition to a Jewish settlement. A Zionist opposition  was organized, led by Menahem Ussishkin, who was not present at the  Uganda Congress. The Charkov Conference of Russian Zionists was  called. Herzl was charged with having violated the Basle Program. The  Charkov Conference disclaimed responsibility for all actions in the  direction of East Africa. It appointed a committee of three to  communicate their demands to Herzl. They asked that he promise that he  would not place before the Congress any territorial projects other  than those connected with Palestine or Syria, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2529"],[0,"The Analysis of Mind (#10)"],[1,"chapter of Dr. Drever's book there are some interesting  examples of the mistakes made by instinct. I will quote one as a sample:    \"The larva of the Lomechusa beetle eats the young of the ants, in whose  nest it is reared. Nevertheless, the ants tend the Lomechusa larvae  with the same care they bestow on their own young. Not only so, but they  apparently discover that the methods of feeding, which suit their own  larvae, would prove fatal to the guests, and accordingly they change  their whole system of nursing\" (loc. cit., p. 106).    Semon (\"Die Mneme,\" pp. 207-9) gives a good illustration of an instinct  growing wiser through experience. He relates how hunters attract stags  by imitating the sounds of other members of their species, male or  female, but find that the older a stag becomes the more difficult it  is to deceive him, and the more accurate the imitation has to be. The  literature of instinct is vast, and illustrations might be multiplied  indefinitely. The main points as regards instinct, which need to be  emphasized as against the popular conceptions of it, are:    (1) That instinct requires no prevision of the biological end which it  serves;    (2) That instinct is only adapted to achieve this end in the usual  circumstances of the animal in question, and has no more precision than  is necessary for success AS A RULE;    (3) That processes initiated by instinct often come to be performed  better after experience;    (4) That instinct supplies the impulses to experimental movements which  are required for the process of learning;    (5) That instincts in their nascent stages are easily modifiable, and  capable of being attached to various sorts of objects.    All the above characteristics of instinct can be established by purely  external observation, except the fact that instinct does not require  prevision. This, though not strictly capable of being PROVED by  observation, is irresistibly suggested by the most obvious phenomena.  Who can believe, for example, that a new-born baby is aware of the  necessity of food for preserving life? Or that insects, in laying eggs,  are concerned for the preservation of their species? The essence of  instinct, one might say, is that it provides a mechanism for  acting without foresight in a manner which is usually advantageous  biologically. It is partly for this reason that it is so important to  understand the fundamental position of instinct in prompting both animal  and human behaviour.          LECTURE III. DESIRE AND FEELING    Desire is a subject upon which, if I am not mistaken, true views can  only be arrived at by an almost complete reversal of the ordinary  unreflecting opinion. It is natural to regard desire as in its essence  an attitude towards something which is imagined, not actual; this  something is called the END or OBJECT of the desire, and is said to be  the PURPOSE of any action resulting from the desire. We think of the  content of the desire as being just like the content of a belief, while  the attitude taken up towards the content is different. According to  this theory, when we say: \"I hope it will rain,\" or \"I expect it will  rain,\" we express, in the first case, a desire, and in the second, a  belief, with an identical content, namely, the image of rain. It would  be easy to say that, just as belief is one kind of feeling in relation  to this content, so desire is another kind. According to this view, what  comes first in desire is something imagined, with a specific feeling  related to it, namely, that specific feeling which we call \"desiring\"  it. The discomfort associated with unsatisfied desire, and the actions  which aim at satisfying desire, are, in this view, both of them effects  of the desire. I think it is fair to say that this is a view against  which common sense would not rebel; nevertheless, I believe it to be  radically mistaken. It cannot be refuted logically, but various facts  can be adduced which make it gradually less simple and plausible, until  at last it turns out to be easier to abandon it wholly and look at the  matter in a totally different way.    The first set of facts to be adduced against the common sense view of  desire are those studied by psycho-analysis. In all human beings, but  most markedly in those suffering from hysteria and certain forms of  insanity, we find what are called \"unconscious\" desires, which are  commonly regarded as showing self-deception. Most psycho-analysts  pay little attention to the analysis of desire, being interested in  discovering by observation what it is that people desire, rather than in  discovering what actually constitutes desire. I think the strangeness of  what they report would be greatly diminished if it were expressed in the  language of a behaviourist theory of desire, rather than in the language  of every-day beliefs. The general description of the sort of phenomena  that bear on our present question is as follows: A person states that  his desires are so-and-so, and that it is these desires that inspire his  actions; but the outside observer perceives that his actions are such  as to realize quite different ends from those which he avows, and  that these different ends are such as he might be expected to desire.  Generally they are less virtuous than his professed desires, and are  therefore less agreeable to profess than these are. It is accordingly  supposed that they really exist as desires for ends, but in a  subconscious part of the mind, which the patient refuses to admit into  consciousness for fear of having to think ill of himself. There are  no doubt many cases to which such a supposition is applicable without  obvious artificiality. But the deeper the Freudians delve into the  underground regions of instinct, the further they travel from anything  resembling conscious desire, and the less possible it becomes to believe  that only positive self-deception conceals from us that we really wish  for things which are abhorrent to our explicit life.    In the cases in question we have a conflict between the outside observer  and the patient's consciousness. The whole tendency of psycho-analysis  is to trust the outside observer rather than the testimony of  introspection. I believe this tendency to be entirely right, but to  demand a re-statement of what constitutes desire, exhibiting it as a  causal law of our actions, not as something actually existing in our  minds.    But let us first get a clearer statement of the essential characteristic  of the phenomena.    A person, we find, states that he desires a certain end A, and that he  is acting with a view to achieving it. We observe, however, that his  actions are such as are likely to achieve a quite different end B, and  that B is the sort of end that often seems to be aimed at by animals and  savages, though civilized people are supposed to have discarded it. We  sometimes find also a whole set of false beliefs, of such a kind as to  persuade the patient that his actions are really a means to A, when in  fact they are a means to B. For example, we have an impulse to inflict  pain upon those whom we hate; we therefore believe that they are wicked,  and that punishment will reform them. This belief enables us to act upon  the impulse to inflict pain, while believing that we are acting upon  the desire to lead sinners to repentance. It is for this reason that the  criminal law has been in all ages more severe than it would have been if  the impulse to ameliorate the criminal had been what really inspired  it. It seems simple to explain such a state of affairs as due to  \"self-deception,\" but this explanation is often mythical. Most people,  in thinking about punishment, have had no more need to hide their  vindictive impulses from themselves than they have had to hide  the exponential theorem. Our impulses are not patent to a casual  observation, but are only to be discovered by a scientific study of our  actions, in the course of which we must regard ourselves as objectively  as we should the motions of the planets or the chemical reactions of a  new element.    The study of animals reinforces this conclusion, and is in many ways  the best preparation for the analysis of desire. In animals we are  not troubled by the disturbing influence of ethical considerations. In  dealing with human beings, we are perpetually distracted by being told  that such-and-such a view is gloomy or cynical or pessimistic: ages of  human conceit have built up such a vast myth as to our wisdom and virtue  that any intrusion of the mere scientific desire to know the facts is  instantly resented by those who cling to comfortable illusions. But no  one cares whether animals are virtuous or not, and no one is under the  delusion that they are rational. Moreover, we do not expect them to be  so \"conscious,\" and are prepared to admit that their instincts prompt  useful actions without any prevision of the ends which they achieve. For  all these reasons, there is much in the analysis of mind which is more  easily discovered by the study of animals than by the observation of  human beings.    We all think that, by watching the behaviour of animals, we can discover  more or less what they desire. If this is the case--and I fully agree  that it is--desire must be capable of being exhibited in actions, for it  is only the actions of animals that we can observe. They MAY have minds  in which all sorts of things take place, but we can know nothing about  their minds except by means of inferences from their actions; and the  more such inferences are examined, the more dubious they appear. It  would seem, therefore, that actions alone must be the test of the  desires of animals. From this it is an easy step to the conclusion that  an animal's desire is nothing but a characteristic of a certain series  of actions, namely, those which would be commonly regarded as inspired  by the desire in question. And when it has been shown"]]]
