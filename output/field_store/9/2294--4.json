This elaboration of new social forms can only be  made by the collective work of the masses. To satisfy the immense  variety of conditions and needs which will spring up as soon as private  property shall be abolished, it is necessary to have the collective  suppleness of mind of the whole people. Any authority external to it  will only be an obstacle, only a trammel on the organic labor which must  be accomplished, and beside that a source of discord and hatred.                                                              Kropotkine.    [Illustration]          A SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY.--POLICE PROTECTION.      Chicago's pride are the stockyards, the Standard Oil University, and  Miss Jane Addams. It is, therefore, perfectly natural that the  sensibility of such a city would suffer as soon as it became known that  an obscure person, by the common name of E. G. Smith, was none other  than the awful Emma Goldman, and that she had not even presented herself  to Mayor Dunne, the platonic lover of Municipal Ownership. However, not  much harm came of it.    The Chicago newspapers, who cherish the truth like a costly jewel, made  the discovery that the shrewd Miss Smith compromised a number of  Chicago's aristocracy and excellencies, among others also Baron von  Schlippenbach, consul of the Russian Empire. We consider it our duty to  defend this gentleman against such an awful accusation. Miss Smith never  visited the house of the Baron, nor did she attend any of his banquets.  We know her well and feel confident that she never would put her foot on  the threshold of a representative of a government that crushes every  free breath, every free word; that sends her very best and noblest sons  and daughters to prison or the gallows; that has the children of the  soil, the peasants, publicly flogged; and that is responsible for the  barbarous slaughter of thousands of Jews.    Miss Jane Addams, too, is quite safe from Miss Smith. True, she invited  her to be present at a reception, but, knowing the weak knees of the  soup kitchen philanthropy from past experience, Miss Smith called her up  on the 'phone and told her that E. G. S. was the dreaded Emma Goldman.  It must have been quite a shock to the lady; after all, one cannot  afford to hurt the sensibilities of society, so long as one has  political and public aspirations. Miss E. G. Smith, being a strong  believer in the prevention of cruelty, preferred to leave the purity of  the Hull House untouched. After her return to New York, E. G. Smith sent  Smith about its business, and started on a lecture tour in her own  right, as Emma Goldman.    CLEVELAND. Dear old friends and co-workers: The work you accomplished  was splendid, also the comradely spirit of the young. But why spoil it  by bad example of applying for protection from the city authorities? It  does not behoove us, who neither believe in their right to prohibit free  assembly, nor to permit it, to appeal to them. If the authorities choose  to do either, they merely prove their autocracy. Those who love freedom  must understand that it is even more distasteful to speak under police  protection than it is to suffer under their persecution. However, the  meetings were very encouraging and the feeling of solidarity sweet and  refreshing.    BUFFALO. The shadow of September 6 still haunts the police of that city.  Their only vision of an Anarchist is one who is forever lying in wait  for human life, which is, of course, very stupid; but stupidity and  authority always join forces. Capt. Ward, who, with a squad of police,  came to save the innocent citizens of Buffalo, asked if we knew the law,  and was quite surprised that that was not our trade; that we had not  been employed to disentangle the chaos of the law,--that it was his  affair to know the law. However, the Captain showed himself absolutely  ignorant of the provisions of the American Constitution. Of course, his  superiors knew what they were about when they set the Constitution  aside, as old and antiquated, and, instead, enacted a law which gives  the average officer a right to invade the head and heart of a man, as to  what he thinks and feels. Capt. Ward added an amendment to the  anti-Anarchist law. He declared any other language than English a  felony, and, since Max Baginski could only avail himself of the German  language, he was not permitted to speak. How is that for our law-abiding  citizens? A man is brutally prevented from speaking, because he does not  know the refined English language of the police force.    Emma Goldman delivered her address in English. It is not likely that  Capt. Ward understood enough of that language. However, the audience  did, and if the police of this country were not so barefaced, the  saviour of Buffalo would have wished himself anywhere rather than to  stand exposed as a clown before a large gathering of men and women.    The meeting the following evening was forcibly dispersed before the  speakers had arrived. Ignorance is always brutal when it is backed by  power.    TORONTO. King Edward Hotel, Queen Victoria Manicuring Parlor. It was  only when we read these signs that we realized that we were on the soil  of the British Empire.    However, the monarchical authorities of Canada were more hospitable and  much freer than those of our free Republic. Not a sign of an officer at  any of the meetings.    The city? A gray sky, rain, storms. Altogether one was reminded of one  of Heine's witty, drastic criticisms in reference to a well-known German  university town. \"Dogs on the street,\" Heine writes, \"implore strangers  to kick them, so that they may have some change from the awful monotony  and dulness.\"    ROCHESTER. The neighborly influence of the Buffalo police seems to have  had a bad effect upon the mental development of the Rochester  authorities. The hall was packed with officers at both meetings. The  government of Rochester, however, was not saved--the police kept  themselves in good order. Some of them seem to have benefited by the  lectures. That accounts for the familiarity of one of Rochester's  \"finest,\" who wanted to shake Emma Goldman's hand. E. G. had to decline.  Baron von Schlippenbach or an American representative of law and  disorder,--where is the difference?    SYRACUSE. The city where the trains run through the streets. With  Tolstoy, one feels that civilization is a crime and a mistake, when one  sees nerve-wrecking machines running through the streets, poisoning the  atmosphere with soft coal smoke.    What! Anarchists within the walls of Syracuse? O horror! The newspapers  reported of special session at City Hall, how to meet the terrible  calamity.    Well, Syracuse still stands on its old site. The second meeting,  attended largely by \"genuine\" Americans, brought by curiosity perhaps,  was very successful. We were assured that the lecture made a splendid  impression, which led us to think that we probably were guilty of some  foolishness, as the Greek philosopher, when his lectures were applauded,  would turn to his hearers and ask, \"Gentlemen, have I committed some  folly?\"    Au revoir.

This is  not exactly a moral strength, but it is a very human weakness; and that  is the most that can be said for it. All other talk, about Celtic frenzy  or Catholic superstition, is cant invented to deceive himself or to  deceive the world. But the vital point to realise is that it is cant  that cannot possibly deceive the American world. In the matter of the  Irishman the American is not to be deceived. It is not merely true to  say that he knows better. It is equally true to say that he knows worse.  He knows vices and evils in the Irishman that are entirely hidden in the  hazy vision of the Englishman. He knows that our unreal slanders are  inconsistent even with the real sins. To us Ireland is a shadowy Isle of  Sunset, like Atlantis, about which we can make up legends. To him it is  a positive ward or parish in the heart of his huge cities, like  Whitechapel; about which even we cannot make legends but only lies. And,  as I have said, there are some lies we do not tell even about  Whitechapel. We do not say it is inhabited by Jews too stupid to count  or know the value of a coin.    The first thing for any honest Englishman to send across the sea is  this; that the English have not the shadow of a notion of what they are  up against in America. They have never even heard of the batteries of  almost brutal energy, of which I had thus touched a live wire even  before I landed. People talk about the hypocrisy of England in dealing  with a small nationality. What strikes me is the stupidity of England in  supposing that she is dealing with a small nationality; when she is  really dealing with a very large nationality. She is dealing with a  nationality that often threatens, even numerically, to dominate all the  other nationalities of the United States. The Irish are not decaying;  they are not unpractical; they are scarcely even scattered; they are not  even poor. They are the most powerful and practical world-combination  with whom we can decide to be friends or foes; and that is why I thought  first of that still and solid brown house in Buckinghamshire, standing  back in the shadow of the trees.    Among my impressions of America I have deliberately put first the figure  of the Irish-American interviewer, standing on the shore more symbolic  than the statue of Liberty. The Irish interviewer's importance for the  English lay in the fact of his being an Irishman, but there was also  considerable interest in the circumstance of his being an interviewer.  And as certain wild birds sometimes wing their way far out to sea and  are the first signal of the shore, so the first Americans the traveller  meets are often American interviewers; and they are generally birds of a  feather, and they certainly flock together. In this respect, there is a  slight difference in the etiquette of the craft in the two countries,  which I was delighted to discuss with my fellow craftsmen. If I could at  that moment have flown back to Fleet Street I am happy to reflect that  nobody in the world would in the least wish to interview me. I should  attract no more attention than the stone griffin opposite the Law  Courts; both monsters being grotesque but also familiar. But supposing  for the sake of argument that anybody did want to interview me, it is  fairly certain that the fact of one paper publishing such an interview  would rather prevent the other papers from doing so. The repetition of  the same views of the same individual in two places would be considered  rather bad journalism; it would have an air of stolen thunder, not to  say stage thunder.    But in America the fact of my landing and lecturing was evidently  regarded in the same light as a murder or a great fire, or any other  terrible but incurable catastrophe, a matter of interest to all pressmen  concerned with practical events. One of the first questions I was asked  was how I should be disposed to explain the wave of crime in New York.  Naturally I replied that it might possibly be due to the number of  English lecturers who had recently landed. In the mood of the moment it  seemed possible that, if they had all been interviewed, regrettable  incidents might possibly have taken place. But this was only the mood of  the moment, and even as a mood did not last more than a moment. And  since it has reference to a rather common and a rather unjust conception  of American journalism, I think it well to take it first as a fallacy to  be refuted, though the refutation may require a rather longer approach.    I have generally found that the traveller fails to understand a foreign  country, through treating it as a tendency and not as a balance. But if  a thing were always tending in one direction it would soon tend to  destruction. Everything that merely progresses finally perishes. Every  nation, like every family, exists upon a compromise, and commonly a  rather eccentric compromise; using the word 'eccentric' in the sense of  something that is somehow at once crazy and healthy. Now the foreigner  commonly sees some feature that he thinks fantastic without seeing the  feature that balances it. The ordinary examples are obvious enough. An  Englishman dining inside a hotel on the boulevards thinks the French  eccentric in refusing to open a window. But he does not think the  English eccentric in refusing to carry their chairs and tables out on to  the pavement in Ludgate Circus. An Englishman will go poking about in  little Swiss or Italian villages, in wild mountains or in remote  islands, demanding tea; and never reflects that he is like a Chinaman  who should enter all the wayside public-houses in Kent and Sussex and  demand opium. But the point is not merely that he demands what he cannot  expect to enjoy; it is that he ignores even what he does enjoy. He does  not realise the sublime and starry paradox of the phrase, _vin  ordinaire_, which to him should be a glorious jest like the phrase  'common gold' or 'daily diamonds.' These are the simple and self-evident  cases; but there are many more subtle cases of the same thing; of the  tendency to see that the nation fills up its own gap with its own  substitute; or corrects its own extravagance with its own precaution.  The national antidote generally grows wild in the woods side by side  with the national poison. If it did not, all the natives would be dead.  For it is so, as I have said, that nations necessarily die of the  undiluted poison called progress.    It is so in this much-abused and over-abused example of the American  journalist. The American interviewers really have exceedingly good  manners for the purposes of their trade, granted that it is necessary to  pursue their trade. And even what is called their hustling method can  truly be said to cut both ways, or hustle both ways; for if they hustle  in, they also hustle out. It may not at first sight seem the very  warmest compliment to a gentleman to congratulate him on the fact that  he soon goes away. But it really is a tribute to his perfection in a  very delicate social art; and I am quite serious when I say that in this  respect the interviewers are artists. It might be more difficult for an  Englishman to come to the point, particularly the sort of point which  American journalists are supposed, with some exaggeration, to aim at. It  might be more difficult for an Englishman to ask a total stranger on the  spur of the moment for the exact inscription on his mother's grave; but  I really think that if an Englishman once got so far as that he would go  very much farther, and certainly go on very much longer. The Englishman  would approach the churchyard by a rather more wandering woodland path;  but if once he had got to the grave I think he would have much more  disposition, so to speak, to sit down on it. Our own national  temperament would find it decidedly more difficult to disconnect when  connections had really been established. Possibly that is the reason why  our national temperament does not establish them. I suspect that the  real reason that an Englishman does not talk is that he cannot leave off  talking. I suspect that my solitary countrymen, hiding in separate  railway compartments, are not so much retiring as a race of Trappists as  escaping from a race of talkers.    However this may be, there is obviously something of practical advantage  in the ease with which the American butterfly flits from flower to  flower. He may in a sense force his acquaintance on us, but he does not  force himself on us. Even when, to our prejudices, he seems to insist on  knowing us, at least he does not insist on our knowing him. It may be,  to some sensibilities, a bad thing that a total stranger should talk as  if he were a friend, but it might possibly be worse if he insisted on  being a friend before he would talk like one. To a great deal of the  interviewing, indeed much the greater part of it, even this criticism  does not apply; there is nothing which even an Englishman of extreme  sensibility could regard as particularly private; the questions involved  are generally entirely public, and treated with not a little public  spirit. But my only reason for saying here what can be said even for the  worst exceptions is to point out this general and neglected principle;  that the very thing that we complain of in a foreigner generally carries  with it its own foreign cure. American interviewing is generally very  reasonable, and it is always very rapid. And even those to whom talking  to an intelligent fellow creature is as horrible as having a tooth out  may still admit that American interviewing has many of the qualities of  American dentistry.    Another effect that has given rise to this fallacy, this exaggeration of  the vulgarity and curiosity of the press, is the distinction between the  articles and the headlines; or rather the tendency to ignore that"]]]
