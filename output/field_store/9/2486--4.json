The prayer ended, the men arose, and full of happy courage turned  to their work.  Every one took part with right good will.  Some brought  earth, some cut logs; there was not a man who had not a shovel or  hatchet or some tool in his hand.  The work went on merrily, and  soon above the banks of the river the fort rose, secure and strong,  fenced and entrenched on every side.  In honour of their King Charles  these new colonists called their fort Caroline, just as Ribaut had  called his Charlesfort.    But as the native Chief Satouriona watched the fort grow he began  to be uneasy.  He wondered what these pale-faced strangers were  about, and he feared lest they should mean evil towards him.  So he  gathered his warriors together, and one day the Frenchmen looked  up from their labours to see the heights above them thick with  savages in their war paint.    At once the Frenchmen dropped their tools and prepared to defend  themselves.  But Satouriona, making signs of peace, and leaving most  of his warriors behind him, came down into the camp followed by a  band of twenty musicians who blew ear-piercing blasts upon discordant  pipes.    Having reached the camp Satouriona squatted on his haunches, showing  that he wanted to take counsel with the Frenchmen.  Then with many  signs and gestures he told the Frenchmen that his great enemies the  Thimagoes were near, and that if the Frenchmen wished to continue  in friendship with him they must promise to help him against these  powerful and hated foes.    Laudonnière feared to lose Satouriona's friendship.  And thereupon  with signs, helped out now and again with a word or two, a, treaty  was made between the Indians and the Frenchmen, Laudonnière promising  to help Satouriona against his enemies, the Thimagoes.  With this  treaty Satouriona was delighted, and he commanded his warriors to  help the Frenchmen in building their fort, which they very readily  did.    Then, mindful of his promise, as soon as the fort was finished,  Laudonnière sent off some of his followers under one of his officers  to find out who the Thimagoes really were of whom Satouriona spoke  with such hate.  Guided by some Indians, this officer soon came upon  the Thimagoes.  But instead of fighting with them he made friends  with them, which greatly disgusted his Indian guides.    Meanwhile Satouriona, delighted at the idea of being able to crush  his enemies with the Frenchmen's help, had gathered all his braves  together and made ready for war.    Ten chiefs and five hundred warriors, fearful in war paint and  feathers, gathered at the call.  Then seeing that Laudonnière was  not making any preparations for war, he sent messengers to him.    \"Our chief has sent us,\" they said, \"and he would know whether you  will stand by your promise to show yourself a friend of his friends,  an enemy of his enemies and go with him to war.\"    \"Tell your chief, replied Laudonnière, \" that I am not willing to  purchase his friendship with the enmity of another.  Notwithstanding  I will go with him.  But first I must gather food for my garrison,  neither are my ships ready.  An enterprise such as this needs time.  Let your chief abide two months, then if he hold himself ready I  will fulfil my promise to him.\"    The Indian carried this answer to the Chief who, when he heard it,  was filled with wrath.  He was not, however, to be stayed from war,  and he determined to go alone.    With great ceremony he prepared to set out.  In an open space near  the river a huge fire was lit.  In a wide circle round this the  warriors gathered.  Their faces were fearful with paint, and their  hair was decorated with feathers, or the heads of wolves and bears  and other fierce animals.  Beside the fire was placed a large bowl  of water, and near it Satouriona stood erect, while his braves  squatted at his feet.  Standing thus he turned his face, distorted  with wrath and hatred, towards the enemy's country.  First he  muttered to himself, then he cried aloud to his god the Sun.  And  when he had done this for half an hour he put his hand into the bowl  of water, and sprinkled the heads of his braves.  Then suddenly, as  if in anger, he cast the rest of the water into the fire, putting  it out.  As he did so he cried aloud:    \"So may the blood of our enemies be poured out and their lives  extinguished.\"    In reply a hoarse yell went up from the savage host, and all the  woods resounded with the fiendish noise.    Thus Satouriona and his braves set forth for battle.  In a few days  they returned singing praises to the Sun, and bringing with them  twenty-four prisoners and many scalps.    And now Laudonnière made Satouriona more angry than ever with him.  For he demanded two of these prisoners.  Laudonnière wanted them  so that he might send them back to the chief of the Thimagoes as a  proof that he at least was still friendly, for he already regretted  his unwise treaty.  But when Satouriona heard Laudonnière's request  he was very angry and treated it with scorn.    \"Tell your chief,\" he said, \"that he has broken his oath, and I  will not give him any of my prisoners.\"    When Laudonnière heard this answer he in his turn was very angry,  and he resolved to frighten Satouriona into obeying him.  So taking  twenty soldiers with him he went to the chief's village.  Leaving  some of the soldiers at the gate, and charging them to let no  Indians go in or out, he went into Satouriona's hut with the others.  In perfect silence he came in, in perfect silence he sat down and  remained so for a long time which, says Laudonnèire, put the chief  \"deeply in the dumps.\"    At length when he thought that Satouriona was completely frightened,  Laudonnière spoke.    \"Where are your prisoners?\" he said. \"I command them to be brought  before me.\" Thereupon the chief, \"angry at the heart and astonied  wonderfully,\" stood a long time without making any answer.  But when  at last he spoke it was boldly and without fear.    \"I cannot give you my prisoners,\" he said. \"For seeing you coming  in such warlike guise they were afraid and fled to the woods.  And  not knowing what way they went we could not by any means find them  again.\"    Laudonnière, however, pretended that he did not understand what  the chief said, and again he asked for the prisoners.    The chief then commanded his son to go in search of them, and in  about an hour he returned bringing them with him.  As soon as they  were brought before Laudonnière the prisoners greeted him humbly.  They lifted up their hands to heaven, and then threw themselves at  his feet.  But Laudonnière raised them at once, and led them away  to the fort, leaving Satouriona very angry.    Laudonnière now sent the prisoners back to the Thimagoes' chief,  who was greatly delighted at the return of his braves.  He was still  more delighted when the Frenchmen marched with him against another  tribe who were his enemies, and defeated them.    But while Laudonnière was thus making both friends and enemies  among the Indians all was not peace in the colony itself.  Many of  the adventurers had grown tired of the loneliness and sameness of  the life.  The food was bad, the work was hard, and there seemed  little hope that things would ever be better.  And for all their  hardships it seemed to them the Governor was to blame.  So they  began to murmur and be discontented, gathering together in groups,  whispering that it would be a good deed to put an end to Laudonnière  and choose another captain.    And now when the discontent was at its height Laudonnière fell  ill.  Then one of the ringleaders of the discontent urged the doctor  to put poison in his medicine.  But the doctor refused.  Next they  formed a plot to hide a barrel of gunpowder under his bed and blow  him up.  But Laudonnière discovered that plot, and the ringleader  fled to the forest.    About this time a ship arrived from France bringing food for the  colony, so that for a time things went a little better.  And when  the ship sailed again for home Laudonnière sent the worst of the  mutineers back in it.  In their place the captain left behind some  of his sailors.  But this proved a bad exchange.  For these sailors  were little better than pirates, and very soon they became the  ringleaders in revolt.  They persuaded some of the older colonists  to join them.  And one day they stole a little ship belonging to the  colony, and set off on a plundering expedition to the West Indies.    On the seas they led a wild and lawless life, taking and plundering  Spanish ships.  But after a time they ran short of food, and found  themselves forced to put into a Spanish port.  Here in order to make  peace with the Spaniards they told all they knew about the French  colony.    Thus it was that for the first time the Spaniards learned that the  heretic Frenchmen had settled in their land, and speedily the news  was sent home to Spain.    Meanwhile Laudonnière was greatly grieved for the loss of his  ship.  And as days passed, and there was no sign of the mutineers'  return, he set his men to work to build two new ships.    For a time the work went well.  But soon many of the men grew tired  of it and they began to grumble.  Why should men of noble birth,  they asked, slave like carpenters? And day by day the discontent  increased.    At last one Sunday morning the men sent a message to Laudonnière  asking him to come out to the parade ground to meet them.  Laudonnière  went, and he found all the colony waiting for him with gloomy  faces.  At once one of them stepped forward, and asked leave to read  a paper in the name of all the others.  Laudonnière gave permission.  The paper was read.  It was full of complaints about the hard work,  the want of food, and other grievances.  It ended with a request  that the men should be allowed to take the two ships which were  being built and sail to Spanish possessions in search of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37742"],[0,"Fishes of the Big Blue River Basin, Kansas (#10)"],[1,"s,           pp. 325-377.      ----, and CROSS, F.
