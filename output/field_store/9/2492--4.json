Perplexed and distressed, the Dean had no other  resource than to leave events to their own development. He trusted that  time would mitigate and show the hopelessness of Vanessa's passion, and  in the meanwhile he sought, by occasional communication with her, to  prevent any catastrophe that might result from actual despair. But his  thoughts for Vanessa's safety were inimical to Stella's repose. She  pined and gradually sunk under the alteration that had taken place in  Swift's deportment toward her since his acquaintance with Vanessa.  Swift, really anxious for the safety of his ward, requested a friend to  ascertain the cause of her malady. It was not difficult to ascertain it.  His indifference and public scandal, which spoke freely of their  unaccountable connection, were alone to blame for her sufferings. It was  enough for Swift. He had passed the age at which he had resolved to  marry, but he was ready to wed Stella provided the marriage were kept  secret and she was content to live apart. Poor Stella was more than  content, but she overestimated her strength. The marriage took place,  and immediately afterward the husband withdrew himself in a fit of  madness, which threw him into gloom and misery for days. What the  motives may have been for the inexplicable stipulations of this wayward  man it is impossible to ascertain. That they were the motives of a  diseased, and at times utterly irresponsible, judgment, we think cannot  be questioned. Of love, as a tender passion, Swift had no conception.  His writings prove it. The coarseness that pervades his compositions has  nothing in common with the susceptibility that shrinks from disgusting  and loathsome images in which Swift reveled. In all his prose and  poetical addresses to his mistresses there is not one expression to  prove the weakness of his heart. He writes as a guardian--he writes as a  friend--he writes as a father, but not a syllable escapes him that can  be attributed to the pangs and delights of the lover.    Married to Stella, Swift proved himself more eager than ever to give to  his intercourse with Vanessa the character of mere friendship. He went  so far as to endeavor to engage her affections for another man, but his  attempts were rejected with indignation and scorn. In the August of the  year 1717 Vanessa retired from Dublin to her house and property near  Cellbridge. Swift exhorted her to leave Ireland altogether, but she was  not to be persuaded. In 1720 it would appear that the Dean frequently  visited the recluse in her retirement, and upon such occasions Vanessa  would plant a laurel or two in honor of her guest, who passed his time  with the lady reading and writing verses in a rural bower built in a  sequestered part of her garden. Some of the verses composed by Vanessa  have been preserved. They breathe the fond ardor of the suffering maid,  and testify to the imperturbable coldness of the man. Of the innocence  of their intercourse there cannot be a doubt. In 1720 Vanessa lost her  last remaining relative--her sister died in her arms. Thrown back upon  herself by this bereavement, the intensity of her love for the Dean  became insupportable. Jealous and suspicious, and eager to put an end to  a terror that possessed her, she resolved to address herself to Stella,  and to ascertain from her own lips the exact nature of her relations  with her so-called guardian. The momentous question was asked in a  letter, to which Stella calmly replied by informing her interrogator  that she was the Dean's wife. Vanessa's letter was forwarded by Stella  to Swift himself, and it roused him to fury. He rode off at once to  Cellbridge, he entered the apartment in which Vanessa was seated, and  glared upon her like a tiger. The trembling creature asked her visitor  to sit down. He answered the invitation by flinging a packet on the  table, and riding instantly away. The packet was opened; it contained  nothing but Vanessa's letter to Stella. Her doom was pronounced. The  fond heart snapped. In a few weeks the hopeless, desolate Vanessa was in  her grave.    Swift, agonized, rushed from the world. For two months subsequently to  the death of Vanessa his place of abode was unknown. But at the end of  that period he returned to Dublin calmer for the conflict he had  undergone. He devoted himself industriously again to affairs of State.  His pen had now a nobler office than to sustain unworthy men in  unmerited power. We can but indicate the course of his labors. Ireland,  the country not of his love, but of his birth and adoption, treated as a  conquered province, owed her rescue from absolute thraldom to Swift's  great and unconquerable exertions on her behalf. He resisted the English  Government with his single hand, and overcame them in the fight. His  popularity in Ireland was unparalleled even in that excited and  generous-hearted land. Rewards were offered to betray him, but a million  lives would have been sacrificed in his place before one would have  profited by the patriot's downfall. He was worshiped, and every hair of  his head was precious and sacred to the people who adored him.    In 1726 Swift revisited England, for the first time since the death of  Queen Anne, and published, anonymously as usual, the famous satire of  _Gulliver's Travels_. Its immediate success heralded the universal fame  that masterly and singular work has since achieved. Swift mingled once  more with his literary friends, and lived almost entirely with Pope.  Yet courted on all sides he was doomed again to bitter sorrow. News  reached him that Stella was ill. Alarmed and full of self-reproaches, he  hastened home to be received by the people of Ireland in triumph, and to  meet--and he was grateful for the sight--the improved and welcoming  looks of the woman for whose dissolution he had been prepared. In March,  1727, Stella being sufficiently recovered, the Dean ventured once more  to England, but soon to be resummoned to the hapless couch of his  exhausted and most miserable wife. Afflicted in body and soul, Swift  suddenly quitted Pope, with whom he was residing at Twickenham, and  reaching his home, was doomed to find his Stella upon the verge of the  grave. Till the last moment he continued at her bedside, evincing the  tenderest consideration, and performing what consolatory tasks he might  in the sick chamber. Shortly before her death part of a conversation  between the melancholy pair was overheard. \"Well, my dear,\" said the  Dean, \"if you wish it, it shall be owned.\" Stella's reply was given in  fewer words. \"_It is too late._\" \"On the 28th of January,\" writes one of  the biographers of Swift, \"Mrs. Johnson closed her weary pilgrimage, and  passed to that land where they neither marry nor are given in marriage,\"  the second victim of one and the same hopeless and consuming passion.    Swift stood alone in the world, and for his punishment was doomed to  endure the crushing solitude for the space of seventeen years. The  interval was gloomy indeed. From his youth the Dean had been subject to  painful fits of giddiness and deafness. From 1736 these fits became more  frequent and severe. In 1740 he went raving mad, and frenzy ceased only  to leave him a more pitiable idiot. During the space of three years the  poor creature was unconscious of all that passed around him, and spoke  but twice. Upon the 19th of October, 1745, God mercifully removed the  terrible spectacle from the sight of man, and released the sufferer from  his misery, degradation, and shame.    The volumes, whose title is found below,[1] and which have given  occasion to these remarks, are a singular comment upon a singular  history. It is the work of a Frenchman who has ventured to deduce a  theory from the _data_ we have submitted to the reader's notice. With  that theory we cannot agree: it may be reconcilable to the romance which  M. de Wailly has invented, but it is altogether opposed to veritable  records that cannot be impugned. M. de Wailly would have it that Swift's  marriage with Stella was a deliberate and rational sacrifice of love to  principle, and that Swift compensated his sacrificed love by granting  his principle no human indulgences; that his love for Vanessa, in fact,  was sincere and ardent, and that his duty to Stella alone prevented a  union with Vanessa. To prove his case M. de Wailly widely departs from  history, and makes his hypothesis of no value whatever, except to the  novel reader. As a romance, written by a Frenchman, _Stella and Vanessa_  is worthy of great commendation. It indicates a familiar knowledge of  English manners and character, and never betrays, except here and there  in the construction of the plot, the hand of a foreigner. It is quite  free from exaggeration, and inasmuch as it exhibits no glaring  anachronism or absurd caricature, is a literary curiosity. We accept it  as such, though bound to reject its higher claims. The mystery of  Swift's amours has yet to be cleared up. We explain his otherwise  unaccountable behavior by attributing his cruelty to prevailing  insanity. The career of Swift was brilliant, but not less wild than  dazzling. The sickly hue of a distempered brain gave a color to his acts  in all the relations of life. The storm was brewing from his childhood;  it burst forth terribly in his age, and only a moment before all was  wreck and devastation, the half-distracted man sat down and made a will,  by which he left the whole of his worldly possessions for the foundation  of a lunatic asylum.

We find in the _Deutsche Zeitung aus Boehmen_, an account of a visit to  the great German satirist and poet Henry Heine, who lives at Paris,  where, as is known, he has long been confined to his bed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3788"],[0,"Haydn (#10)"],[1," Dittersdorf shrewdly replied by asking the emperor in his turn to draw a  parallel between Gellert and Klopstock; whereupon Joseph made answer by  saying that both were great poets, but that Klopstock's works required  attentive study, while Gellert's beauties were open to the first glance.  The analogy, Dittersdorf tells us, \"pleased the emperor very much.\" Its  point is, however, not very clear--that is to say, it is not very clear  whether the emperor meant to compare Klopstock with Haydn and Gellert  with Mozart or vice versa, and whether, again, he regarded it as more of  a merit that the poet and the composer should require study or be \"open  to the first glance.\" Joseph was certainly friendly towards Mozart, but  by all accounts he had no great love for Haydn, to whose \"tricks and  nonsense\" he made frequent sneering reference.    The first noteworthy event of 1766 was the death of Werner, which took  place on March 5. It made no real difference to Haydn, who, as we have  seen, had been from the first, in effect, if not in name, chief of  the musical establishment; but it at least freed him from sundry petty  annoyances, and left him absolutely master of the musical situation.  Shortly after Werner's death, the entire musical establishment at  Eisenstadt was removed to the prince's new palace of Esterhaz, with  which Haydn was now to be connected for practically the whole of his  remaining professional career.    Esterhaz    A great deal has been written about Esterhaz, but it is not necessary  that we should occupy much space with a description of the castle and  its surroundings. The palace probably owed its inception to the prince's  visit to Paris in 1764. At any rate, it is in the French Renaissance  style, and there is some significance in the fact that a French  traveller who saw it about 1782 described it as having no place but  Versailles to compare with it for magnificence. The situation--about  three and a half miles from Eisenstadt--was anything but suitable for an  erection of the kind, being in an unhealthy marsh and \"quite out of the  world.\" But Prince Nicolaus had set his heart upon the scheme, as Scott  set his heart upon Abbotsford; and just as \"Clarty Hole\" came in time to  be \"parked about and gated grandly,\" so Esterhaz, after something  like 11,000,000 gulden had been spent upon it, emerged a veritable  Versailles, with groves and grottoes, hermitages and temples,  summer-houses and hot-houses, and deer parks and flower gardens.  There were two theatres in the grounds: one for operas and dramatic  performances generally; the other \"brilliantly ornamented and furnished  with large artistic marionettes, excellent scenery and appliances.\"    A Puppet Theatre    It is upon the entertainments connected with the latter house that the  French traveller just mentioned chiefly dwells. \"The prince,\" he says,  \"has a puppet theatre which is certainly unique in character. Here the  grandest operas are produced. One knows not whether to be amazed or to  laugh at seeing 'Alceste,' 'Alcides,' etc., put on the stage with all  due solemnity, and played by puppets. His orchestra is one of the best  I ever heard, and the great Haydn is his court and theatre composer.  He employs a poet for his singular theatre, whose humour and skill  in suiting the grandest subjects for the stage, and in parodying the  gravest effects, are often exceedingly happy. He often engages a troupe  of wandering players for a month at a time, and he himself and his  retinue form the entire audience. They are allowed to come on the stage  uncombed, drunk, their parts not half learned, and half-dressed. The  prince is not for the serious and tragic, and he enjoys it when the  players, like Sancho Panza, give loose reins to their humour.\"    Prince Nicolaus became so much attached to this superb creation of his  own, that he seldom cared to leave it. A small portion of the Capelle  remained at Eisenstadt to carry on the church service there, but the  prince seldom went to Eisenstadt, and more seldom still to Vienna. Most  of the Hungarian grandees liked nothing better than to display their  wealth in the Imperial city during the winter season; but to Haydn's  employer there was literally \"no place like home.\" When he did go to  Vienna, he would often cut short his visits in the most abrupt manner,  to the great confusion of his musicians and other dependants.  These eccentricities must have given some annoyance to Haydn, who,  notwithstanding his love of quiet and seclusion, often longed for  the change and variety of city life. It is said that he was specially  anxious to make a tour in Italy about this time, but that ambition had,  of necessity, to be abandoned.    A Busy Life    There was certainly plenty for him to do at Esterhaz--more than he  had ever been required to do at Eisenstadt. Royalties, nobles and  aristocrats were constantly at the palace; and music was one of the  chief diversions provided for them. The prince was very proud of his  musical establishment, and desired to have it considered the best of its  kind in Europe. The orchestra of the opera was formed of members of the  Capelle; \"the singers were Italian for the most part, engaged for one,  two, or more years, and the books of the words were printed. Numerous  strolling companies were engaged for shorter terms; travelling virtuosi  often played with the members of the band. Special days and hours were  fixed for chamber music, and for orchestral works; and in the interval  the singers, musicians and actors met at the cafe, and formed, so to  speak, one family.\" Something more than creative genius was obviously  required to direct the music of an establishment of this kind. A talent  for organization, an eye for detail, tact in the management of players  and singers--these qualities were all indispensable for the performance  of duties such as Haydn had undertaken. That he possessed them we may  fairly assume from more than one circumstance. In the first place,  his employer was satisfied with him. He raised his salary, listened  attentively to all his suggestions, and did everything that he could  to retain his services. In the second place, his band and singers  were sincerely attached to him. They saw that he had their interests,  personal and professional, at heart, and they \"loved him like a father.\"  The prince paid them well, and several of them were sufficiently capable  to receive appointments afterwards in the Imperial Chapel. Pohl gives a  list of the names about this time, but, with one or two exceptions, they  are quite unfamiliar. J. B. Krumpholtz, the harpist, was engaged from  1773 to 1776, and Andreas Lidl, who played in London soon after leaving  the band, was in the service of the prince from 1769 to 1774.    The sum paid to Haydn at this date was not large as we should now  consider it, but it was sufficient to free him from financial worry had  it not been for the extravagance and bad management of his wife. The  prince gave him about 78 pounds, in addition to which he had certain  allowances in kind, and, as we have already said, free quarters for  himself and his wife when she thought fit to stay with him. Probably,  too, he was now making something substantial by his compositions.  Griesinger declares that he had saved about 200 pounds before 1790, the  year when he started for London. If that be true, he must have been very  economical. His wife, we must remember, was making constant calls upon  him for money, and in addition he had to meet the pressing demands of  various poor relations. His correspondence certainly does not tend to  show that he was saving, and we know that when he set out for London he  had not only to draw upon the generosity of his prince for the costs of  the journey, but had to sell his house to provide for his wife until his  return.    Opera at Esterhaz    It is time, however, to speak of some of Haydn's compositions during  this period. At Esterhaz he \"wrote nearly all his operas, most of his  arias and songs, the music for the marionette theatre--of which he was  particularly fond--and the greater part of his orchestral and chamber  works.\" The dramatic works bulk rather largely during the earlier  part of the period. In 1769, for example, when the whole musical  establishment of Esterhaz visited Vienna, a performance of his opera,  \"Lo Speciale,\" was given at the house of Freiherr von Sommerau, and  was repeated in the form of a concert. Other works of the kind were  performed at intervals, particularly on festival occasions, but as  most of them have perished, and all of them are essentially pieces  d'occasion, it is unnecessary even to recall their names. In 1771 Haydn  wrote a \"Stabat Mater\" and a \"Salve Regina,\" and in 1773 followed the  Symphony in C which bears the name of the Empress Maria Theresa, having  been written for the empress's visit to Esterhaz in September of that  year. In the course of the visit Haydn was naturally introduced to Her  Majesty, when, as we have stated, he took occasion to remind her of the  \"good hiding\" she had ordered him to have at Schonbrunn during the old  chorister days at St Stephen's. \"Well, you see, my dear Haydn,\" was the  reply, \"the hiding has borne good fruit.\"    First Oratorio    In 1775 came his first oratorio, \"Il Ritorno di Tobia.\" This is an  exceedingly interesting work. It was first performed under Haydn's  direction by the Tonkunstler Societat, with solo singers from Esterbaz,  at Vienna, on April 2, 1775. In 1784 Haydn added two choruses, one a  \"Storm Chorus,\" which is sometimes confused with the \"Storm Chorus\" (in  the same key, but in triple time) composed during his sojourn in London.  It is from \"Il Ritorno di Tobia\" that the so-called motet, \"Insanae et  Vanae Curae,\" is adapted, and the \"Storm Chorus\" immediately follows  a fine soprano air in F minor and major, sung by Anna in the original  work, a portion of which forms the"]]]
