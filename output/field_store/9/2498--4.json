Once fairly started in life, these huge sharks spread themselves  throughout the warm seas of the world, for there was none might stand  before them and say nay. They swarmed along our southern coast, from  Maryland to Texas; they swarmed everywhere that the water was  sufficiently warm, for their teeth occur in Tertiary strata in many  parts of the world, and the deep-sea dredges of the Challenger and  Albatross have brought up their teeth by scores. And then--they  perished, perished as utterly as did the hosts of Sennacherib. Why? We  do not know. Did they devour everything large enough to be eaten  throughout their habitat, and then fall to eating one another? Again, we  do not know. But perish they did, while the smaller white shark, which  came into being at the same time, still lives, as if to emphasize the  fact that it is best not to overdo things, and that in the long run the  victory is not _always_ to the largest.      _REFERENCES_    _The finest Mosasaur skeleton ever discovered, an almost complete  skeleton of Tylosaurus dyspelor, 29 feet in length, may be seen at the  head of the staircase leading to the Hall of Paleontology, in the  American Museum of Natural History, New York. Another good specimen may  be seen in the Yale University Museum, which probably has the largest  collection of Mosasaurs in existence. Another fine collection is in the  Museum of the State University of Kansas, at Lawrence._    _The best Zeuglodon, the first to show the vestigial hind legs and to  make clear other portions of the structure, is in the United States  National Museum._    _The great sharks are known in this country by their teeth only, and, as  these are common in the phosphate beds, specimens may be seen in  almost any collection. In the United States National Museum, the jaws of  a twelve-foot blue shark are shown for comparison. The largest tooth in  that collection is 5-3/4 inches high and 5 inches across the base. It  takes five teeth of the blue shark to fill the same number of inches._    _The Mosasaurs are described in detail by Professor S. W. Williston, in  Vol. IV. of the \"University Geological Survey of Kansas.\" There is a  technical--and, consequently, uninteresting--account of Zeuglodon in  Vol. XXIII. of the \"Proceedings of the United States National Museum,\"  page 327._    [Illustration: Fig. 12.--A Tooth of Zeuglodon, one of the \"Yoke Teeth,\"  from which it derives the name.]          V    BIRDS OF OLD        \"_With head, hands, wings, or feet, pursues his way,      And swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies._\"      When we come to discuss the topic of the earliest bird--not the one in  the proverb--our choice of subjects is indeed limited, being restricted  to the famous and oft-described Archaeopteryx from the quarries of  Solenhofen, which at present forms the starting-point in the history of  the feathered race. Bird-like, or at least feathered, creatures, must  have existed before this, as it is improbable that feathers and flight  were acquired at one bound, and this lends probability to the view that  at least some of the tracks in the Connecticut Valley are really the  footprints of birds. Not birds as we now know them, but still creatures  wearing feathers, these being the distinctive badge and livery of the  order. For we may well speak of the feathered race, the exclusive  prerogative of the bird being not flight but feathers; no bird is  without them, no other creature wears them, so that birds may be exactly  defined in two words, feathered animals. Reptiles, and even mammals, may  go quite naked or cover themselves with a defensive armor of bony plates  or horny scales; but under the blaze of the tropical sun or in the chill  waters of arctic seas birds wear feathers only, although in the penguins  the feathers have become so changed that their identity is almost lost.    [Illustration: Fig. 13.--Archaeopteryx, the Earliest Known Bird. _From  the specimen in the Berlin Museum._]    So far as flight goes, there is one entire order of mammals, whose  members, the bats, are quite as much at home in the air as the birds  themselves, and in bygone days the empire of the air belonged to the  pterodactyls; even frogs and fishes have tried to fly, and some of the  latter have nearly succeeded in the attempt. As for wings, it may be  said that they are made on very different patterns in such animals as  the pterodactyl, bat, and bird, and that while the end to be achieved is  the same, it is reached by very different methods. The wing membrane of  a bat is spread between his out-stretched fingers, the thumb alone  being left free, while in the pterodactyl the thumb is wanting and the  membrane supported only by what in us is the little finger, a term that  is a decided misnomer in the case of the pterodactyl. In birds the  fingers have lost their individuality, and are modified for the  attachment or support of the wing feathers, but in Archaeopteryx the hand  had not reached this stage, for the fingers were partly free and tipped  with claws.    [Illustration: Fig. 14.--Nature's Four Methods of Making a Wing. Bat,  Pterodactyl, Archaeopteryx, and Modern Bird.]    We get some side lights on the structure of primitive birds by studying  the young and the earlier stages of living species, for in a very  general way it may be said that the development of the individual is a  sort of rough sketch or hasty outline of the development of the class of  which it is a member; thus the transitory stages through which the chick  passes before hatching give us some idea of the structure of the adult  birds or bird-like creatures of long ago. Now, in embryonic birds the  wing ends in a sort of paw and the fingers are separate, quite different  from what they become a little later on, and not unlike their condition  in Archaeopteryx, and even more like what is found in the wing of an  ostrich.    Then, too, there are a few birds still left, such as the ostrich, that  have not kept pace with the others, and are a trifle more like reptiles  than the vast majority of their relatives, and these help a little in  explaining the structure of early birds. Among these is a queer bird  with a queer name, Hoactzin, found in South America, which when young  uses its little wings much like legs, just as we may suppose was done by  birds of old, to climb about the branches. Mr. Quelch, who has studied  these curious birds in their native wilds of British Guiana, tells us  that soon after hatching, the nestlings begin to crawl about by means of  their legs and wings, the well-developed claws on the thumb and finger  being constantly in use for hooking to surrounding objects. If they are  drawn from the nest by means of their legs, they hold on firmly to the  twigs, both with their bill and wings; and if the nest be upset they  hold on to all objects with which they come in contact by bill, feet,  and wings, making considerable use of the bill, with the help of the  clawed wings, to raise themselves to a higher level.    [Illustration: Fig. 15.--Young Hoactzins.]    Thus, by putting these various facts together we obtain some pretty good  ideas regarding the appearance and habits of the first birds. The  immediate ancestors of birds, their exact point of departure from other  vertebrates, is yet to be discovered; at one time it was considered that  they were the direct descendants of Dinosaurs, or that at least both  were derived from the same parent forms, and while that view was almost  abandoned, it is again being brought forward with much to support it. It  has also been thought that birds and those flying reptiles, the  pterodactyls, have had a common ancestry, and the possibility of this is  still entertained. Be that as it may, it is safe to consider that back  in the past, earlier than the Jurassic, were creatures neither bird nor  reptile, but possessing rudimentary feathers and having the promise of a  wing in the structure of their fore legs, and some time one of these  animals may come to light; until then Archaeopteryx remains the earliest  known bird.    In the Jurassic, then, when the Dinosaurs were the lords of the earth  and small mammals just beginning to appear, we come upon traces of  full-fledged birds. The first intimation of their presence was the  imprint of a single feather found in that ancient treasure-house, the  Solenhofen quarries; but as Hercules was revealed by his foot, so the  bird was made evident by the feather whose discovery was announced  August 15, 1861. And a little later, in September of the same year, the  bird itself turned up, and in 1877 a second specimen was found, the two  representing two species, if not two distinct genera. These were very  different from any birds now living--so different, indeed, and bearing  such evident traces of their reptilian ancestry, that it is necessary to  place them apart from other animals in a separate division of the class  birds.    Archaeopteryx was considerably smaller than a crow, with a stout little  head armed with sharp teeth (as scarce as hens' teeth was no joke in  that distant period), while as he fluttered through the air he trailed  after him a tail longer than his body, beset with feathers on either  side. Everyone knows that nowadays the feathers of a bird's tail are  arranged like the sticks of a fan, and that the tail opens and shuts  like a fan. But in Archaeopteryx the feathers were arranged in pairs, a  feather on each side of every joint of the tail, so that on a small  scale the tail was something like that of a kite; and because of this  long, lizard-like tail this bird and his immediate kith and kin are  placed in a group dubbed Saururae, or lizard tailed.    Because impressions of feathers are not found all around these specimens  some have thought that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3803"],[0,"File No. 113 (#10)"],[1,", he was not hungry now! Now that he was alone, he fed upon his own  bitter thoughts. He sank from a state of frenzy into one of stupefying  despair, and vainly did he endeavor to clear his confused mind, and  account for the dark cloud gathering about him; no loop-hole for escape  did he discover.    The night was long and terrible, and for the first time he had nothing  to count the hours by, as they slowly dragged on, but the measured tread  of the patrol who came to relieve the sentinels. He was wretched.    At dawn he dropped into a sleep, a heavy, oppressive sleep, which was  more wearisome than refreshing; from which he was startled by the rough  voice of the jailer.    \"Come, monsieur,\" he said, \"it is time for you to appear before the  judge of instruction.\"    He jumped up at once, and, without stopping to repair his disordered  toilet, said:    \"Come on, quick!\"    The constable remarked, as they walked along:    \"You are very fortunate in having your case brought before an honest  man.\"    He was right.    Endowed with remarkable penetration, firm, unbiased, equally free from  false pity and excessive severity, M. Patrigent possessed in an eminent  degree all the qualities necessary for the delicate and difficult office  of judge of instruction.    Perhaps he was wanting in the feverish activity which is sometimes  necessary for coming to a quick and just decision; but he possessed  unwearying patience, which nothing could discourage. He would cheerfully  devote years to the examination of a case; he was even now engaged on a  case of Belgian bank-notes, of which he did not collect all the threads,  and solve the mystery, until after four years' investigation.    Thus it was always to his office that they brought the endless lawsuits,  half-finished inquests, and tangled cases.    This was the man before whom they were taking Prosper; and they were  taking him by a difficult road.    He was escorted along a corridor, through a room full of policemen, down  a narrow flight of steps, across a kind of cellar, and then up a steep  staircase which seemed to have no terminus.    Finally he reached a long narrow galley, upon which opened many doors,  bearing different numbers.    The custodian of the unhappy cashier stopped before one of these doors,  and said:    \"Here we are; here your fate will be decided.\"    At this remark, uttered in a tone of deep commiseration, Prosper could  not refrain from shuddering.    It was only too true, that on the other side of this door was a man upon  whose decision his freedom depended.    Summoning all his courage, he turned the door-knob, and was about to  enter when the constable stopped him.    \"Don't be in such haste,\" he said; \"you must sit down here, and wait  till your turn comes; then you will be called.\"    The wretched man obeyed, and his keeper took a seat beside him.    Nothing is more terrible and lugubrious than this gallery of the judges  of instruction.    Stretching the whole length of the wall is a wooden bench blackened by  constant use. This bench has for the last ten years been daily occupied  by all the murderers, thieves, and suspicious characters of the  Department of the Seine.    Sooner or later, fatally, as filth rushes to a sewer, does crime  reach this gallery, this dreadful gallery with one door opening on the  galleys, the other on the scaffold. This place was vulgarly and pithily  denominated by a certain magistrate as the great public wash-house of  all the dirty linen in Paris.    When Prosper reached the gallery it was full of people. The bench was  almost entirely occupied. Beside him, so close as to touch his shoulder,  sat a man with a sinister countenance, dressed in rags.    Before each door, which belonged to a judge of instruction, stood groups  of witnesses talking in an undertone.    Policemen were constantly coming and going with prisoners. Sometimes,  above the noise of their heavy boots, tramping along the flagstones,  could be heard a woman's stifled sobs, and looking around you would  see some poor mother or wife with her face buried in her handkerchief,  weeping bitterly.    At short intervals a door would open and shut, and a bailiff call out a  name or number.    This stifling atmosphere, and the sight of so much misery, made the  cashier ill and faint; he was feeling as if another five minutes' stay  among these wretched creatures would make him deathly sick, when a  little old man dressed in black, wearing the insignia of his office, a  steel chain, cried out:    \"Prosper Bertomy!\"    The unhappy man arose, and, without knowing how, found himself in the  office of the judge of instruction.    For a moment he was blinded. He had come out of a dark room; and the one  in which he now found himself had a window directly opposite the door,  so that a flood of light fell suddenly upon him.    This office, like all those on the gallery, was of a very ordinary  appearance, small and dingy.    The wall was covered with cheap dark green paper, and on the floor was a  hideous brown carpet, very much worn.    Opposite the door was a large desk, filled with bundles of law-papers,  behind which was seated the judge, facing those who entered, so that his  face remained in the shade, while that of the prisoner or witness whom  he questioned was in a glare of light.    At the right, before a little table, sat a clerk writing, the  indispensable auxiliary of the judge.    But Prosper observed none of these details: his whole attention was  concentrated upon the arbiter of his fate, and as he closely examined  his face he was convinced that the jailer was right in calling him an  honorable man.    M. Patrigent's homely face, with its irregular outline and short red  whiskers, lit up by a pair of bright, intelligent eyes, and a kindly  expression, was calculated to impress one favorably at first sight.    \"Take a seat,\" he said to Prosper.    This little attention was gratefully welcomed by the prisoner, for he  had expected to be treated with harsh contempt. He looked upon it as a  good sign, and his mind felt a slight relief.    M. Patrigent turned toward the clerk, and said:    \"We will begin now, Sigault; pay attention.\"    \"What is your name?\" he then asked, looking at Prosper.    \"Auguste Prosper Bertomy.\"    \"How old are you?\"    \"I shall be thirty the 5th of next May.\"    \"What is your profession?\"    \"I am--that is, I was--cashier in M. Andre Fauvel's bank.\"    The judge stopped to consult a little memorandum lying on his desk.  Prosper, who followed attentively his every movement, began to be  hopeful, saying to himself that never would a man so unprejudiced have  the cruelty to send him to prison again.    After finding what he looked for, M. Patrigent resumed the examination.    \"Where do you live?\"    \"At No. 39, Rue Chaptal, for the last four years. Before that time I  lived at No. 7, Boulevard des Batignolles.\"    \"Where were you born?\"    \"At Beaucaire in the Department of the Gard.\"    \"Are your parents living?\"    \"My mother died two years ago; my father is still living.\"    \"Does he live in Paris?\"    \"No, monsieur: he lives at Beaucaire with my sister, who married one of  the engineers of the Southern Canal.\"    It was in broken tones that Prosper answered these last questions.  There are moments in the life of a man when home memories encourage  and console him; there are also moments when he would be thankful to be  without a single tie, and bitterly regrets that he is not alone in the  world.    M. Patrigent observed the prisoner's emotion, when he spoke of his  parents.    \"What is your father's calling?\" he continued.    \"He was formerly superintendent of the bridges and canals; then he  was employed on the Southern Canal, with my brother-in-law; now he has  retired from business.\"    There was a moment's silence. The judge had turned his chair around, so  that, although his head was apparently averted, he had a good view of  the workings of Prosper's face.    \"Well,\" he said, abruptly, \"you are accused of having robbed M. Fauvel  of three hundred and fifty thousand francs.\"    During the last twenty-four hours the wretched young man had had time to  familiarize himself with the terrible idea of this accusation; and yet,  uttered as it was in this formal, brief tone, it seemed to strike him  with a horror which rendered him incapable of opening his lips.    \"What have you to answer?\" asked the judge.    \"That I am innocent, monsieur; I swear that I am innocent!\"    \"I hope you are,\" said M. Patrigent, \"and you may count upon me to  assist you to the extent of my ability in proving your innocence. You  must have defence, some facts to state; have you not?\"    \"Ah, monsieur, what can I say, when I cannot understand this dreadful  business myself? I can only refer you to my past life.\"    The judge interrupted him:    \"Let us be specific; the robbery was committed under circumstances that  prevent suspicion from falling upon anyone but M. Fauvel and yourself.  Do you suspect anyone else?\"    \"No, monsieur.\"    \"You declare yourself to be innocent, therefore the guilty party must be  M. Fauvel.\"    Prosper remained silent.    \"Have you,\" persisted the judge, \"any cause for believing that M. Fauvel  robbed himself?\"    The prisoner preserved a rigid silence.    \"I see, monsieur,\" said the judge, \"that you need time for reflection.  Listen to the reading of your examination, and after signing it you will  return to prison.\"    The unhappy man was overcome. The last ray of hope was gone. He heard  nothing of what Sigault read, and he signed the paper without looking at  it.    He tottered as he left the judge's office, so that the keeper was forced  to support him.    \"I fear your case looks dark, monsieur,\" said the man, \"but don't be  disheartened; keep up your courage.\"    Courage! Prosper had not a spark of it when he returned to his cell; but  his heart was filled with anger and resentment.    He had"]]]
