The Kookies having observed the Gyalls to  have once tasted their balls, prepare a sufficient supply of them to  answer the intended purpose; and as the Gyalls lick them up, they throw  down more; and it is to prevent their being so readily destroyed that  the cotton is mixed with the earth and the salt. This process generally  goes on for three changes of the moon, or for a month and a half, during  which time the tame and the wild Gyalls are always together, licking the  decoy balls; and the Kookie, after the first day or two of their being  so, makes his appearance, at such a distance as not to alarm the wild  ones. By degrees he approaches nearer and nearer, until at length the  sight of him has become so familiar that he can advance to stroke his  tame Gyalls on the back and neck, without frightening away the wild  ones. He next extends his hand to them, and caresses them also, at the  same time giving them plenty of his decoy balls to lick. Thus, in the  short space of time mentioned, he is able to drive them, along with the  tame ones, to his parrah, or village, without the least exertion of  force; and so attached do the Gyalls become to the parrah, that when the  Kookies migrate from one place to another, they always find it necessary  to set fire to the huts they are about to abandon, lest the Gyalls  should return to them from the new grounds.    It is worthy of remark that the new and full moon are the periods at  which the Kookies in general commence their operations of catching the  wild Gyalls, from having observed that at these changes the two sexes  are most inclined to associate. The same observation has been made with  respect to Elephants.          THE GAYAL.      About four years after the publication of Mr. Macrae's account of the  Gyall (namely in 1808,) there appeared, in the Eighth volume of 'Asiatic  Researches,' a description of a species of Ox, named Gayal, communicated  by H. T. Colebrooke.    He commences by observing, that \"the Gayal was mentioned in an early  volume of the 'Researches of the Asiatic Society,' (vol. ii, p. 188,  1790,) by its Indian name, which was explained by the phrase \"Cattle of  the mountains.\" It had been obscurely noticed (if indeed the same  species of Ox be meant) by Knox, in his historical relation of Ceylon  (p. 21), and it has been imperfectly described by Captain Turner, in  his journey through Bootan, ('Embassy to Tibet,' p. 160).    \"Herds of this species of cattle have been long kept by many gentlemen  in the eastern districts of Bengal, and also in other parts of this  province; but no detailed account of the animal and of its habits has  been yet published in India. To remedy this deficiency, Dr. Roxburgh  undertook, at my solicitation, to describe the Gayal, from those seen by  him in a herd belonging to the Governor-General. Dr. Buchanan has also  obligingly communicated his observations on the same cattle; with  information obtained from several gentlemen at Tipura, Sylhet, and  Chatgaon, relative to the habits of the animal. The original drawing  from which the plate has been taken was drawn by a native artist.\"    [Illustration: Reduced copy of the Plate just referred to.]    This representation does not appear to have been taken from a specimen  of the animals here described: it bears a much stronger resemblance to  our figure of the Gaur, which was taken from the stuffed specimen in the  British Museum (see p. 97), than it does to the Gyall (_Bos frontalis_  of Lambert, see p. 51), or to the Gayal, which died in the Zoological  Gardens in 1846, from which our figure was taken, which is given on p.  68.    Dr. Roxburgh, who undertook, at the solicitation of Mr. Colebrooke, to  describe the Gayal, appears to have done so by the very simple method of  copying Mr. Macrae's description of the Gyall, which appeared in the  'Linnean Transactions,' in 1804, to which he has added, that the dewlap  is deep and pendant; and this, according to every other account, is not  the fact.    With respect to the account given by Dr. Buchanan, I have thought it  best to quote it in full; because (although it repeats several of the  characteristics already given,) it appears to flow from the pen of one  who really observed what he describes.    He says: \"The Gayal generally carries its head with the mouth projecting  forward, like that of a Buffalo. The head, at the upper part, is very  broad and flat, and is contracted suddenly towards the nose, which is  naked, like that of the common cow. From the upper angle of the forehead  proceed two thick, short, horizontal processes of bone, which are  covered with hair; on these are placed the horns, which are smooth,  shorter than the head, and lie nearly in the plane of the forehead. They  diverge outward, and turn upward with a gentle curve. At the bases they  are very thick, and are slightly compressed, the flat side being toward  the front and the tail. The edge next the ear is rather the thinnest, so  that a transverse section would be somewhat ovate. Toward their tips  the horns are rounded, and end in a sharp point. The eyes resemble those  of the common Ox; the ears are much longer, broader, and blunter than  those of that animal.    \"The neck is very slender near the head, at some distance from which a  dewlap commences, but this is not so deep, nor so much undulated as in  the Zebu or Indian Ox. The dewlap is covered with strong longish hairs,  so as to form a kind of mane on the lower part of the neck; but this is  not very conspicuous, especially when the animal is young.    \"In place of the hump (which is situated between the shoulders of the  Zebu) the Gayal has a sharp ridge, which commences on the hinder part of  the neck, slopes gradually up till it comes over the shoulder-joint,  then runs horizontally almost a third part of the length of the back,  where it terminates with a very sudden slope. The height of this ridge  makes the neck appear much depressed, and also adds greatly to the  clumsiness of the chest, which, although narrow, is very deep. The  sternum is covered by a continuation of the dewlap. The rump, or os  sacrum, has a more considerable declivity than that of the European Ox,  but less than that of the Zebu.    \"The tail is covered with short hair, except near the end, where it has  a tuft like that of the common Ox; but in the Gayal the tail descends no  lower than the extremity of the tibia.    \"The legs, especially the fore ones, are thick and clumsy. The false  hoofs are much larger than those of the Zebu. The hinder parts are  weaker in proportion than the fore; and, owing to the contraction of the  belly, the hinder legs, although in fact the shortest, appear to be the  longest.    \"The whole body is covered with a thick coat of short hair, which is  lengthened out into a mane on the dewlap, and into a pencil-like tuft on  the end of the tail. From the summit of the head there diverges, with a  whirl, a bunch of rather long coarse hair, which lies flat, is usually  lighter-coloured than that which is adjacent, and extends towards the  horns and over the forehead. The general colour of the animal is brown,  in various shades, which very often approaches to black, but sometimes  is rather light. Some parts, especially about the legs and belly, are  usually white; but in different individuals these are very differently  disposed.\"    The following is the measurement of a full-grown cow:--                                          Ft.

It is a kind of lowing,  but shriller, and not near so loud as that of the European Ox. To this,  however, the Gayal approaches much nearer than it does to the Buffalo.\"    Mr. Macrae, who furnished the account in 1804, is again consulted; and  from his second account, the following additional particulars have been  gleaned. [Now, however, as the reader will observe, the name is Gayal,  and not Gyall; although, according to Mr. Macrae's own derivation of the  word, it would appear to be more correctly Gyall.]    \"The Gayal is found wild in the range of mountains that form the eastern  boundary of the provinces of Aracan, Chittagong (Chatgaon), Tipura, and  Sylhet.    \"The Cucis, or Lunclas, a race of people inhabiting the hills  immediately to the eastward of Chatgaon, have herds of the Gayal in a  domesticated state. By them he is called Shial, from which, most  probably, his name of Gayal [Gyall] is derived; as he is never seen on  the plains, except when he is brought there.

C. H. Eden, `My Wife and I in Queensland,' p. 83:    \"In every milking yard is an apparatus for confining a cow's  head called a `bail.'  This consists of an upright standiron,  five feet in height, let into a framework, and about six inches  from it another fixed at the heel, the upper part working  freely in a slit, in which are holes for a peg, so that when  the peg is out and the movable standiron is thrown back, there  is abundance of room for a cow's head and horns, but when  closed, at which time the two standirons are parallel to each  other and six inches apart, though her neck can work freely up  and down, it is impossible for her to withdraw her head . . .\"    1874.  W. M. B., `Narrative of Edward Crewe,' p. 225:    \"The former bovine female was a brute to manage, whom it would  have been impossible to milk without a `bail.'  To what man or  country the honour of this invention belongs, who can tell?

(1) To secure the head of a cow in a  bail for milking.    (2) By transference, to stop travellers in the bush, used of  bushrangers.  The quotation, 1888, shows the method of  transference.  It then means generally, to stop.  Like the  similar verb, <i>to stick up</i> (q.v.), it is often used  humorously of a demand for subscriptions, etc.    1844.  Mrs. Chas.

Aileen smiled something like her old  self for a minute, and said, `That comes natural to you now,  Dick, doesn't it ?'  I stared for a bit and then burst out  laughing.It was a rum go, wasn't it?  The same talk for cows  and Christians.  That's how things get stuck into the talk in a  new country.  Some old hand like father, as had been assigned  to a dairy settler, and spent all his mornings in the cow-yard,  had taken to the bush and tried his hand at sticking up people.  When they came near enough of course he'd pop out from behind a  tree, with his old musket or pair of pistols, and when he  wanted `em to stop, `Bail up, d-- yer,' would come a deal  quicker and more natural-like to his tongue than `Stand.'  So  `bail up' it was from that day to this, and there'll have to be  a deal of change in the ways of the colonies, and them as come  from `em before anything else takes its place between the man  that's got the arms and the man that's got the money.\"    <hw>Bailing-up Pen</hw>, <i>n</i>. place for fastening up cattle.    1889.

It  is the only species of the genus, and is regarded as the most  closely allied of all living marsupials to the extinct  marsupials of the Mesozoic Age in Europe.  It receives its name  banded from the presence along the back of a well-marked series  of dark transverse bands.    1871.  G. Krefft, `Mammals of Australia':    \"The <i>Myrmecobius</i> is common on the West Coast and in the  interior of New South Wales and South Australia: the  Murrumbidgee River may be taken as its most eastern boundary.\"    1893.

They are rather mixed feeders; but insects,  worms, roots and bulbs, constitute their ordinary diet.\"  (`Encyclopaedia Britannica,' 9th edit., vol. xv. p. 381.)  The  name comes from India, being a corruption of Telugu  <i>pandi-kokku</i>, literally \"pig-dog,\" used of a large rat  called by naturalists <i>Mus malabaricus</i>, Shaw, <i>Mus  giganteus</i>, Hardwicke; <i>Mus bandis coota</i>, Bechstein.  The name has spread all over India.  The Indian animal is very  different from the Australian, and no record is preserved to  show how the Anglo-Indian word came to be used in Australia.  The Bandicoots are divided into three genera--the <i>True  Bandicoots</i> (genus <i>Perameles</i>, q.v.), the <i>Rabbit  Bandicoots</i> (genus <i>Peragale</i>, q.v.), and the  <i>Pig-footed Bandicoots</i> (q.v.)
