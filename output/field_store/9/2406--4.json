In the  hall, dining and drawing rooms, are rich plaster ceilings of a half  century later. The moat, which still encircles the castle grounds, is  spanned by a modern bridge with a turretted gatehouse of early 15th  century work. The outbuildings on the east side of the gatehouse are of  contemporaneous date. The embattled wall on the west side is part of the  original castle, and belongs to an early part of the 14th century. In the  hall are portraits of Charles I. and Cromwell, by Dobson, and in other  parts of the building works by Westall, Dorcy, and Gainsborough. A large  historical painting of Lord Saye before Jack Cade (Shakespeare's King  Henry VI., pt. 2, sc. 7) formerly hung at the end of the drawing room.  After the Edge Hill fight, Banbury surrendered to the Royalists, who  attacked Broughton on the following day. The Castle, with wool-sacked  windows, stood siege for a day, and then it is said to have been taken by  Prince Rupert. There is little or no evidence to show the phases of the  fight, but when it is remembered that the Fiennes' in the vale of the Red  Horse were within an hour's ride, and that Ramsay and some of his troops  found a way to Banbury on the Sunday, it would point to the probability of  fierce defence. Bretch Cave, on the Banbury Road, has the common repute  of being a secret passage to the Castle, and perhaps some sally port of  the kind may have a tale to tell.      [Illustration: BROUGHTON CASTLE.]      The two paper mills on the borders of the Broughton estate, the Woad Mill  and the Fulling Mill, together with the settlements of the plush and other  weavers near by, point to surroundings of industry connected, it must be  believed, with the old house.    BROUGHTON CHURCH (ST. MARY'S) is a beautiful church of good Early English  work with a broach spire. The nave is on the north side of the church; the  south aisle appears to end as a chapelry. As a place of sepulture of so  many of the Fiennes' family, it is enriched by their tombs and those of  others of the house. The tomb of John de Broughton (circa 1306) is in a  richly decorated and canopied niche in the south wall. The high corner  tomb is that of Edward Fiennes (1528) and that near by with the effigy of  the Knight is believed to be of the father, Richard Fiennes (1501). In the  chancel are the rich alabaster effigies of Sir Thomas Wykham and wife  (circa 1441), and also plain tombs of Wm. Viscount Saye and Sele and wife  (dated 1642-1648).[7] The stone chancel screen with incised diaper  ornament, and the exceedingly well proportioned windows, place the good  work of the church amongst the typical gothic of the country side:  especially to be noticed are the geometrical tracery of the east window of  the south aisle; the south window with later perpendicular shafting; the  south chancel window and the square-headed early English windows of the  south wall. There is a finely crocketed ogee west door and plain south  porch.    WROXTON ABBEY or PRIORY, 3 miles north-west of Banbury, was founded by  Michael Belet; it passed into the hands of Sir Thos. Pope after the  troubles of the Reformation time, and thence by marriage to the Earls  Guildford and North. It is the seat of Lord North, and is famed for its  beautifully terraced gardens and park. The chapel, which is supposed to  date from the time of King John, contains a window in the Decorated style,  with old glass, and the carved woodwork is of the best in the  neighbourhood. The other part of the mansion was re-built in 1618,  excepting a wing which has been added within the last few years. On the  west front is a good porch, in the Italian style, of the time of James I.  The principal features of the hall are the carved woodwork of the gallery,  the fireplace, and the stag's head brackets and pendants. The ceiling of  the dining-room is a beautiful specimen of the classical work of the  Stuart period. Amongst the paintings are some portraits by Vandyke,  Holbein, Jansen and Kneller, and landscapes by Wouvermans, Hobbema, and  others. The famous \"Garden Party,\" by Watteau, is one of the collection.  King James and King Charles I. visited Wroxton, the latter at the time of  the meeting of the King and Queen at Kineton in the year following the  battle of Edge Hill. A medal was struck to commemorate the meeting.  Pleasant paths to Banbury and Broughton lead across the fields.    ALL SAINTS' CHURCH, WROXTON, is of plain Gothic style. The chief points of  interest are a good decorated font, two sedilia, and a tomb with effigies  of Sir W. and Lady Pope, erected about the middle of the 17th century.    ADDERBURY.--Altitudes: high town 342, low town 300; population, 1132;  3-1/4 miles south of Banbury. It retains its old mansions and homesteads  and the wide margin of its ways to a fuller degree than other villages in  the north of the shire. The old rectory house, the manor house, formerly  Lord Rochester's home, and others on the south side of the green, are good  buildings. Nothing remains of the Cross once standing on the green, and of  Sir Thos. Cobb's famous house there remain but the gateways and kitchen.  The village during the time of the Great Rebellion was held as a Royalist  outpost in the Banbury area. Mr. Wilmot, afterwards Lord Rochester, with  his local troops of horse fought on the left wing of the Royalists' Army  at Edge Hill. A cavalry fight took place during the war near Bodicot, on  the Banbury road, when Fiennes had some success.    ST. MARY'S CHURCH is remarkable for its elegant chancel, built by William  of Wykeham. The chancel windows are in the early style of perpendicular  architecture, and are fine illustrations of the architect's skill. His  arms are to be seen above the exterior of the east window. The north door  is in the decorated style, and is rich in mouldings and crocketed  canopies. A good example of perpendicular work is to be seen in the  square-headed vestry door. The spire dates from the 14th century, and is  massive and imposing. The frieze under the cornice of the north wall is  filled with grotesque sculpture. In the interior, the timber roof of the  nave, the clustered columns, and the sedilia and piscina are excellent  specimens of work of the decorated period.    HANWELL.--Altitudes: 476-416; population, 176; 3 miles north-west of  Banbury. The village winds in one long street down-hill. It rests on the  ferruginous red rock of the Middle Lias. Midway in the village an old oak  tree covered the village stocks and the outflow of an aquaduct, probably  the Saint Ann's Well of past time. Pleasant footways follow the hill side  on the north to Shotteswell and on the south to Banbury. When King Charles  took the Castle after the battle of Edge Hill it would seem that it was  not without a fight. An old rhyme runs:      Hornton in the hollow,    Long Horley on the hill,    Frowsty little Drayton,    Bloody Hanwell hill.    HANWELL CASTLE during its tenure as a farm house lost much of its old work  in successive alterations. Two massive octagonal turrets and the facing of  the west front remain of the old building. The right-handed stairway, a  flight of eighty steps in the north turret, is of very thorough Hornton  stone work, but the turrets and front are of the good flat red brick in  use in Tudor time, with stone quoins. It would appear that the right hand  stairway lent itself better to defensive uses; the upper rooms are entered  from the turret stair. In the angle of the south turret a small room shows  some old oak panelling, and in an adjoining room a hearth and chimney  piece of local stone are in the south-east angle. The once \"gallant  house of Hanwell,\" and, according to Dr. Plot, the home of Sir Anthony  Cope, the most eminent artist and naturalist, may be seen figured as in  its original state by Skelton in his \"Antiquities of Oxfordshire,\" who  says the mansion was quadrangular with two towers at each angle. The  stonework of the doorways of the room adjoining the south entrance and  most of the masonry of the west side has been preserved. The Copes came  into early possession of the Hanwell estate, and John Cope, cofferer to  King Henry VIII., built the house which was so well spoken of by Leland.  In Tudor and Stuart times they were busy politicians, and James I. and his  Queen are said to have visited the Castle. The Copes were with the people  in the time of the Great Rebellion, and after Edge Hill the Castle was  taken by the Royalists. Subsequently Sir Anthony Cope found residence for  the eminent Puritan pastors Harris and Dod, who, with Whateley of Banbury,  ministered to enlarge the religious zeal of the neighbourhood. The pool  and plantation lie to the east of the grounds, and the plantation below is  worth mention from the number of rare plants found therein, amongst them  the Bistort, Lungwort, Green Hellebore, and Saracen's Woundwort.      [Illustration: HANWELL CASTLE.]      BLOXHAM.--Altitudes: high town 400, low town 310; population, 1340; 3  miles south-west of Banbury. The village stands on the red rock of the  middle Lias which bears a capping of clay on the high lands: the lower  levels are of the usual marls. Field ways from Banbury run from the end of  West Bar, and by a less direct but pretty route across the farm field on  the Oxford Road. The buildings of All Saint's School, founded about half a  century since, are at the entrance of the village. The school has earned  good place by the excellence of its tuition. The brook cutting through the  town from west to east and the many side streets and jetways add a  pleasant appearance to the many good homesteads and gardens.    BLOXHAM CHURCH (ST. MARY'S) is one of the most perfect specimens of Gothic"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3296"],[0,"The Confessions of St. Augustine (#10)"],[1,"ts; openly, by sciences which they call liberal;  secretly, with a false-named religion; here proud, there superstitious,  every where vain. Here, hunting after the emptiness of popular praise,  down even to theatrical applauses, and poetic prizes, and strifes for  grassy garlands, and the follies of shows, and the intemperance of  desires. There, desiring to be cleansed from these defilements, by  carrying food to those who were called \"elect\" and \"holy,\" out of which,  in the workhouse of their stomachs, they should forge for us Angels  and Gods, by whom we might be cleansed. These things did I follow, and  practise with my friends, deceived by me, and with me. Let the arrogant  mock me, and such as have not been, to their soul's health, stricken and  cast down by Thee, O my God; but I would still confess to Thee mine own  shame in Thy praise. Suffer me, I beseech Thee, and give me grace to go  over in my present remembrance the wanderings of my forepassed time,  and to offer unto Thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving. For what am I to  myself without Thee, but a guide to mine own downfall? or what am I even  at the best, but an infant sucking the milk Thou givest, and feeding  upon Thee, the food that perisheth not? But what sort of man is any man,  seeing he is but a man? Let now the strong and the mighty laugh at us,  but let us poor and needy confess unto Thee.    In those years I taught rhetoric, and, overcome by cupidity, made sale  of a loquacity to overcome by. Yet I preferred (Lord, Thou knowest)  honest scholars (as they are accounted), and these I, without artifice,  taught artifices, not to be practised against the life of the guiltless,  though sometimes for the life of the guilty. And Thou, O God, from afar  perceivedst me stumbling in that slippery course, and amid much smoke  sending out some sparks of faithfulness, which I showed in that my  guidance of such as loved vanity, and sought after leasing, myself their  companion. In those years I had one,--not in that which is called  lawful marriage, but whom I had found out in a wayward passion, void of  understanding; yet but one, remaining faithful even to her; in whom I  in my own case experienced what difference there is betwixt the  self-restraint of the marriage-covenant, for the sake of issue, and  the bargain of a lustful love, where children are born against their  parents' will, although, once born, they constrain love.    I remember also, that when I had settled to enter the lists for a  theatrical prize, some wizard asked me what I would give him to win; but  I, detesting and abhorring such foul mysteries, answered, \"Though the  garland were of imperishable gold, I would not suffer a fly to be  killed to gain me it.\" For he was to kill some living creatures in his  sacrifices, and by those honours to invite the devils to favour me. But  this ill also I rejected, not out of a pure love for Thee, O God of my  heart; for I knew not how to love Thee, who knew not how to conceive  aught beyond a material brightness. And doth not a soul, sighing after  such fictions, commit fornication against Thee, trust in things unreal,  and feed the wind? Still I would not forsooth have sacrifices offered  to devils for me, to whom I was sacrificing myself by that superstition.  For what else is it to feed the wind, but to feed them, that is by going  astray to become their pleasure and derision?    Those impostors then, whom they style Mathematicians, I consulted  without scruple; because they seemed to use no sacrifice, nor to pray to  any spirit for their divinations: which art, however, Christian and  true piety consistently rejects and condemns. For, it is a good thing to  confess unto Thee, and to say, Have mercy upon me, heal my soul, for I  have sinned against Thee; and not to abuse Thy mercy for a licence to  sin, but to remember the Lord's words, Behold, thou art made whole, sin  no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee. All which wholesome advice  they labour to destroy, saying, \"The cause of thy sin is inevitably  determined in heaven\"; and \"This did Venus, or Saturn, or Mars\":  that man, forsooth, flesh and blood, and proud corruption, might be  blameless; while the Creator and Ordainer of heaven and the stars is  to bear the blame. And who is He but our God? the very sweetness and  well-spring of righteousness, who renderest to every man according to  his works: and a broken and contrite heart wilt Thou not despise.    There was in those days a wise man, very skilful in physic, and renowned  therein, who had with his own proconsular hand put the Agonistic garland  upon my distempered head, but not as a physician: for this disease Thou  only curest, who resistest the proud, and givest grace to the humble.  But didst Thou fail me even by that old man, or forbear to heal my soul?  For having become more acquainted with him, and hanging assiduously and  fixedly on his speech (for though in simple terms, it was vivid, lively,  and earnest), when he had gathered by my discourse that I was given to  the books of nativity-casters, he kindly and fatherly advised me to cast  them away, and not fruitlessly bestow a care and diligence, necessary  for useful things, upon these vanities; saying, that he had in his  earliest years studied that art, so as to make it the profession whereby  he should live, and that, understanding Hippocrates, he could soon have  understood such a study as this; and yet he had given it over, and taken  to physic, for no other reason but that he found it utterly false;  and he, a grave man, would not get his living by deluding people. \"But  thou,\" saith he, \"hast rhetoric to maintain thyself by, so that thou  followest this of free choice, not of necessity: the more then oughtest  thou to give me credit herein, who laboured to acquire it so perfectly  as to get my living by it alone.\" Of whom when I had demanded, how then  could many true things be foretold by it, he answered me (as he could)  \"that the force of chance, diffused throughout the whole order of  things, brought this about. For if when a man by haphazard opens the  pages of some poet, who sang and thought of something wholly different,  a verse oftentimes fell out, wondrously agreeable to the present  business: it were not to be wondered at, if out of the soul of man,  unconscious what takes place in it, by some higher instinct an answer  should be given, by hap, not by art, corresponding to the business and  actions of the demander.\"    And thus much, either from or through him, Thou conveyedst to me, and  tracedst in my memory, what I might hereafter examine for myself. But at  that time neither he, nor my dearest Nebridius, a youth singularly good  and of a holy fear, who derided the whole body of divination, could  persuade me to cast it aside, the authority of the authors swaying me  yet more, and as yet I had found no certain proof (such as I sought)  whereby it might without all doubt appear, that what had been truly  foretold by those consulted was the result of haphazard, not of the art  of the star-gazers.    In those years when I first began to teach rhetoric in my native town,  I had made one my friend, but too dear to me, from a community of  pursuits, of mine own age, and, as myself, in the first opening flower  of youth. He had grown up of a child with me, and we had been both  school-fellows and play-fellows. But he was not yet my friend as  afterwards, nor even then, as true friendship is; for true it cannot be,  unless in such as Thou cementest together, cleaving unto Thee, by that  love which is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is  given unto us. Yet was it but too sweet, ripened by the warmth of  kindred studies: for, from the true faith (which he as a youth had  not soundly and thoroughly imbibed), I had warped him also to those  superstitious and pernicious fables, for which my mother bewailed me.  With me he now erred in mind, nor could my soul be without him. But  behold Thou wert close on the steps of Thy fugitives, at once God of  vengeance, and Fountain of mercies, turning us to Thyself by wonderful  means; Thou tookest that man out of this life, when he had scarce filled  up one whole year of my friendship, sweet to me above all sweetness of  that my life.    Who can recount all Thy praises, which he hath felt in his one self?  What diddest Thou then, my God, and how unsearchable is the abyss of  Thy judgments? For long, sore sick of a fever, he lay senseless in  a death-sweat; and his recovery being despaired of, he was baptised,  unknowing; myself meanwhile little regarding, and presuming that his  soul would retain rather what it had received of me, not what was  wrought on his unconscious body. But it proved far otherwise: for he was  refreshed, and restored. Forthwith, as soon as I could speak with him  (and I could, so soon as he was able, for I never left him, and we hung  but too much upon each other), I essayed to jest with him, as though he  would jest with me at that baptism which he had received, when utterly  absent in mind and feeling, but had now understood that he had received.  But he so shrunk from me, as from an enemy; and with a wonderful and  sudden freedom bade me, as I would continue his friend, forbear such  language to him. I, all astonished and amazed, suppressed all my  emotions till he should grow well, and his health were strong enough for  me to deal with him as I would. But he was taken away from my frenzy,  that with Thee he might be preserved for my comfort; a few days after in  my absence, he was attacked again by the fever, and so departed.    At this grief my heart was utterly darkened; and whatever I beheld was  death. My native country was a torment to me, and my father's house a  strange unhappiness; and whatever I had shared with him, wanting him,  became a distracting torture. Mine eyes sought him every where, but he  was not granted them; and I hated all places, for that"]]]
