In the former is a contrivance for regulating the petrol  supply. A float--a cork, or air-tight metal box--is arranged to move  freely up and down the stem of a needle-valve, which closes the inlet  from the tank. At the bottom of the chamber are two pivoted levers, W W,  which, when the float rests on them, tip up and lift the valve. Petrol  flows in and raises the float. This allows the valve to sink and cut off  the supply. If the valve is a good fit and the float is of the correct  weight, the petrol will never rise higher than the tip of the jet G.    [Illustration: FIG. 44.--Section of a carburetter.]    The suction of the engine makes petrol spirt through the jet (which has  a very small hole in its end) and atomize itself against a  spraying-cone, A. It then passes to the engine inlet pipe through a  number of openings, after mixing with air entering from below. An extra  air inlet, controllable by the driver, is generally added, unless the  carburetter be of a type which automatically maintains constant  proportions of air and vapour. The jet chamber is often surrounded by a  jacket, through which part of the hot exhaust gases circulate. In cold  weather especially this is a valuable aid to vaporization.    [Illustration: FIG. 45.--Sketch of the electrical ignition arrangements  on a motor car.]      IGNITION OF THE CHARGE.    All petrol-cars now use electrical ignition. There are two main  systems--(1) by an accumulator and induction coil; (2) _magneto  ignition_, by means of a small dynamo driven by the engine. A general  arrangement of the first is shown in Fig. 45. A disc, D, of some  insulating material--fibre or vulcanite--is mounted on the cam, or  half-speed, shaft. Into the circumference is let a piece of brass,  called the contact-piece, through which a screw passes to the cam shaft.  A movable plate, M P, which can be rotated concentrically with D through  part of a circle, carries a \"wipe\" block at the end of a spring, which  presses it against D. The spring itself is attached to an insulated  plate. When the revolution of D brings the wipe and contact together,  current flows from the accumulator through switch S to the wipe; through  the contact-piece to C; from C to M P and the induction coil; and back  to the accumulator. This is the _primary, or low-tension, circuit_. A  _high-tension_ current is induced by the coil in the _secondary_  circuit, indicated by dotted lines.[10] In this circuit is the  sparking-plug (see Fig. 46), having a central insulated rod in  connection with one terminal of the secondary coil. Between it and a  bent wire projecting from the iron casing of the plug (in contact with  the other terminal of the secondary coil through the metal of the  engine, to which one wire of the circuit is attached) is a small gap,  across which the secondary current leaps when the primary current is  broken by the wipe and contact parting company. The spark is intensely  hot, and suffices to ignite the compressed charge in the cylinder.    [Illustration: FIG. 46.--Section of a sparking-plug.]      ADVANCING THE SPARK.    We will assume that the position of W (in Fig. 45) is such that the  contact touches W at the moment when the piston has just completed the  compression stroke. Now, the actual combustion of the charge occupies  an appreciable time, and with the engine running at high speed the  piston would have travelled some way down the cylinder before the full  force of the explosion was developed. But by raising lever L, the  position of W may be so altered that contact is made slightly _before_  the compression stroke is complete, so that the charge is fairly alight  by the time the piston has altered its direction. This is called  _advancing_ the spark.      GOVERNING THE ENGINE.    There are several methods of controlling the speed of  internal-combustion engines. The operating mechanism in most cases is a  centrifugal ball-governor. When the speed has reached the fixed limit it  either (1) raises the exhaust valve, so that no fresh charges are drawn  in; (2) prevents the opening of the inlet valve; or (3) throttles the  gas supply. The last is now most commonly used on motor cars, in  conjunction with some device for putting it out of action when the  driver wishes to exceed the highest speed that it normally permits.    [Illustration: FIG. 47.--One form of governor used on motor cars.]    A sketch of a neat governor, with regulating attachment, is given in  Fig. 47. The governor shaft is driven from the engine. As the balls, B  B, increase their velocity, they fly away from the shaft and move the  arms, A A, and a sliding tube, C, towards the right. This rocks the  lever R, and allows the valves in the inlet pipe to close and reduce the  supply of air and gas. A wedge, W, which can be raised or lowered by  lever L, intervenes between the end of R and the valve stem. If this  lever be lifted to its highest position, the governing commences at a  lower speed, as the valve then has but a short distance to travel before  closing completely. For high speeds the driver depresses L, forces the  wedge down, and so minimizes the effect of the governor.      THE CLUTCH.    The engine shaft has on its rear end the fly-wheel, which has a broad  and heavy rim, turned to a conical shape inside. Close to this,  revolving loosely on the shaft, is the clutch plate, a heavy disc with a  broad edge so shaped as to fit the inside of a fly-wheel. It is  generally faced with leather. A very strong spring presses the plate  into the fly-wheel, and the resulting friction is sufficient to prevent  any slip. Projections on the rear of the clutch engage with the gear-box  shaft. The driver throws out the clutch by depressing a lever with his  foot. Some clutches dispense with the leather lining. These are termed  _metal to metal_ clutches.      THE GEAR-BOX.    We now come to a very interesting detail of the motor car, the gear-box.  The steam-engine has its speed increased by admitting more steam to the  cylinders. But an explosion engine must be run at a high speed to  develop its full power, and when heavier work has to be done on a hill  it becomes necessary to alter the speed ratio of engine to  driving-wheels. Our illustration (Fig. 48) gives a section of a  gear-box, which will serve as a typical example. It provides three  forward speeds and one reverse. To understand how it works, we must  study the illustration carefully. Pinion 1 is mounted on a hollow shaft  turned by the clutch. Into the hollow shaft projects the end of another  shaft carrying pinions 6 and 4. Pinion 6 slides up and down this shaft,  which is square at this point, but round inside the _loose_ pinion 4.  Pinions 2 and 3 are keyed to a square secondary shaft, and are  respectively always in gear with 1 and 4; but 5 can be slid backwards  and forwards so as to engage or disengage with 6. In the illustration no  gear is \"in.\" If the engine is working, 1 revolves 2, 2 turns 3, and 3  revolves 4 idly on its shaft.    [Illustration: FIG. 48.--The gear-box of a motor car.]    To get the lowest, or \"first,\" speed the driver moves his lever and  slides 5 into gear with 6. The transmission then is: 1 turns 2, 2 turns  5, 5 turns 6, 6 turns the propeller shaft through the universal joint.  For the second speed, 5 and 6 are disengaged, and 6 is moved up the  page, as it were, till projections on it interlock with slots in 4; thus  driving 1, 2, 3, 4, shaft. For the third, or \"solid,\" speed, 6 is pulled  down into connection with 1, and couples the engine shaft direct to the  propeller shaft.    The \"reverse\" is accomplished by raising a long pinion, 7, which lies in  the gear-box under 5 and 6. The drive then is 1, 2, 5, 7, 6. There being  an odd number of pinions now engaged, the propeller shaft turns in the  reverse direction to that of the engine shaft.    [Illustration: FIG. 49.]      THE COMPENSATING GEAR.    Every axle of a railway train carries a wheel at each end, rigidly  attached to it. When rounding a corner the outside wheel has further to  travel than the other, and consequently one or both wheels must slip.  The curves are made so gentle, however, that the amount of slip is very  small. But with a traction-engine, motor car, or tricycle the case is  different, for all have to describe circles of very small diameter in  proportion to the length of the vehicle. Therefore in every case a  _compensating gear_ is fitted, to allow the wheels to turn at different  speeds, while permitting them both to drive. Fig. 49 is an exaggerated  sketch of the gear. The axles of the moving wheels turn inside tubes  attached to the springs and a central casing (not shown), and terminate  in large bevel-wheels, C and D. Between these are small bevels mounted  on a shaft supported by the driving drum. If the latter be rotated, the  bevels would turn C and D at equal speeds, assuming that both axles  revolve without friction in their bearings. We will suppose that the  drum is turned 50 times a minute. Now, if one wheel be held, the other  will revolve 100 times a minute; or, if one be slowed, the other will  increase its speed by a corresponding amount. The _average_ speed  remains 50. It should be mentioned that drum A has incorporated with it  on the outside a bevel-wheel (not shown) rotated by a smaller bevel on  the end of the propeller shaft.      THE SILENCER.    The petrol-engine, as now used, emits the products of combustion at a  high pressure. If unchecked, they expand violently, and cause a partial  vacuum in the exhaust pipe, into which the air rushes back with such  violence as to cause a loud noise. Devices called _silencers_ are  therefore fitted, to render the escape more gradual, and split it up  among a number of small apertures. The simplest form of silencer is a  cylindrical box, with a number of finely "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28569"],[0,"Makers of Many Things (#10)"],[1,"be tolerated in any watch factory.  Of late even Switzerland has been importing American machinery in order  to compete with the United States. These machines do such careful,  minute, intricate work that, as you stand and watch them, you feel  as if they must know what they are about. One of them takes the  frame,--that is, the plates to which the wheels are fastened,--makes  it of the proper thinness, cuts the necessary holes in it, and passes  it over to the next machine, which is reaching out for it. The feeder  gives the first machine another plate; and so the work goes on down  a whole line of machines. At length the plate is taken in hand by a  machine, or rather a group of machines, which can do almost anything.  Before they let it go, they actually perform one hundred and forty-two  different operations, each bringing it nearer completion. These  machines are automatic, but nevertheless they must be constantly  watched by expert machinists to keep them in order and make sure of  their turning out perfect work.    While one line of machines has been perfecting the plate, others have  been at work on screws and wheels and springs. As many of these as are  needed for one watch are put into a little division of a tray and  carried to another room for its jewels and the rest of its outfit.  The jewels, which are pieces of rubies, sapphires, garnets, or even  diamonds, are very valuable to a watch. When you know that the little  wheels are in constant motion, and that the balance wheel, for  instance, vibrates eighteen thousand times an hour, it is plain that  a vast amount of wear comes upon the spot where the pivots of these  wheels rest. No metal can be made smooth enough to prevent friction,  and there is no metal hard enough to prevent wear. The \"jewels\" are  smoother and harder. They are sawed into slabs so thin that fifty of  them piled up would measure only an inch. These are stuck to blocks  to be polished, cut into disks flat on one side but with a little  depression on the other to receive oil, bored through the center,  and placed wherever the wear is greatest--provided the purchaser is  willing to pay for them. A \"full-jeweled\" watch contains twenty-three  jewels; that is, in twenty-three of the places where the most severe  wear comes, or where friction might prevent the watch from going with  perfect smoothness, there will be practically no wear and no friction.  A low-priced watch contains only seven jewels, but if you want a watch  to last, it pays to buy one that is full-jeweled.    And now these plates and wheels and screws are to be put together, or  \"assembled,\" as this work is called. This is a simple matter just as  soon as one has learned where the different parts belong, for they are  made by machinery and are sure to fit. After the assembling comes the  adjusting of the balance wheel and the hair spring. There is nothing  simple about this work, for the tiny screws with the large heads must  be put into the rim of the balance wheel with the utmost care, or  else all the other work will be useless, and the watch will not be  a perfect time keeper; that is, one that neither loses nor gains more  than thirty seconds a month.    It is said that the earliest watches made in Europe cost fifteen  hundred dollars and took a year to make. There has always been a  demand for a cheap pocket timepiece, and of late this demand has been  satisfied by the manufacture of the \"dollar watch.\" Properly speaking,  this is not a watch at all, but a small spring clock. It has no  jewels, and its parts are stamped out of sheets of brass or steel by  machinery. The hair springs are made in coils of eight and then  broken apart; and the main springs are made by the mile. Twenty holes  are drilled at a time, and the factory in which \"dollar watches\" were  first manufactured is now able to turn out fifteen thousand a day.          IX    THE MAKING OF SHOES      Did you ever stop to think how many different qualities you expect  in a shoe? You want the sole to be hard and firm so as to protect  your feet in rough walking; and also soft and yielding so as to  feel springy and not board-like. You want the upper leather to  keep the cold air from coming in; and also porous enough to let the  perspiration out. Your feet are not exactly like those of any one  else; and yet you expect to find at any shoe store a comfortable shoe  ready-made. You expect that shoe to come close to your foot, and yet  allow you to move it with perfect freedom. You expect all these good  qualities, and what is more remarkable, it does not seem difficult for  most people to get them. There is an old saying, \"To him who wears  shoes, the whole earth is covered with leather\"; and although many  different materials have been tried in shoemaking, leather is the only  one that has proved satisfactory, for the sole of the shoe at least.  Of late, however, rubber and rubber combinations and felts and felt  combinations have been used.    Most hides of which soles are made come from the large beef  packing-houses or from South America. Goatskins come from Africa and  India. The greater part of a hide is made up of a sort of gelatine.  This easily spoils, and therefore it has to be \"tanned\"; that is,  soaked in tannin and water. When a man set out to build a tannery, he  used to go into the woods where he could be sure of enough oak trees  to supply him for many years with the bark from which tannin is made;  but it has been found that the bark of several other kinds of trees,  such as larch, chestnut, spruce, pine, and hemlock, will tan as well  as that of oak. Tannin is now prepared in the forest and brought to  the tanners, who put their tanneries where they please, usually near  some large city. The hides are first soaked in water, and every  particle of flesh is scraped away. They are laid in heaps for a while,  then hung in a warm room till the hair loosens and can be easily  removed, then soaked in tannic extract and water. The tannin unites  with the gelatine; and thus the hide becomes leather. This process  requires several months. Hides are also tanned by the use of  chemicals, in what is called \"chrome\" tanning. This process requires  only a few hours, but it is expensive.    In earlier times the shoemaker used to go from house to house with his  lapstone, waxed end, awl, and other tools. The farmer provided the  leather, which he had tanned from the hides of his own cattle. Now,  however, manufacturers can buy the soles of one merchant, the heels of  another, the box toe and stiffenings of another, and so on. In the  United States there are many factories which do nothing but cut soles,  or rather stamp them out with dies, a hundred or more in a minute.  These soles and also the less heavy inner soles go through machines  that make all parts of them of a uniform thickness. The traveling  shoemaker always hammered his sole leather to make it wear better; but  now a moment between very heavy rollers answers the same purpose.  Another machine splits the inner sole for perhaps a quarter of an inch  all the way around, and thus makes a little lip to which to sew the  welt. A number of layers or \"lifts\" of leather are cemented together  for the heel, and are put under heavy pressure.    The upper parts of a shoe, the \"uppers,\" as they are called, are the  vamp or front of the shoe, the top, the tip, and (in a laced shoe)  the tongue. Nearly all the upper leather that shows when a shoe is  on is made from the hides of cattle, calves, goats, and sheep; but  besides the parts that show there are stiffeners for the box toe  and the counters to support the quarters over the heel; there are  linings, and many other necessary \"findings,\" forty-four parts in all  in an ordinary shoe. Much experimenting and more thinking have gone  into every one of these forty-four parts; and much remembering that  shoes have harder wear than anything else in one's wardrobe. The  cotton linings, for instance, must be woven in a special way in order  to make them last and not \"rub up\" when they are wet with water or  perspiration. They are bleached with the utmost care not to weaken  them, and they are singed between red-hot copper plates to remove  all the nap.    Then, too, a good deal of metal is used in making a shoe, not only the  ornamental buckles on dress shoes and the heavy, useful buckles on  storm boots, but various pieces that help to make the shoe strong and  enduring. There are nails, shanks to strengthen the arch of the shoe,  metal shanks to the buttons, and eyelets. Not many years ago, eyelets  soon wore brassy, and then the shoe looked old and cheap. They are now  enameled, or the top of them is made of celluloid in a color to match  the shoe. The tags on lacings and the hooks for holding lacings are  also enameled. A \"box-toe gum\" is used to support the box-toe  stiffening. Cement covers the stitches; and many sorts of blacking  are used in finishing the work. It is by no means a simple operation  to make a pair of shoes.    At a busy shoe factory it is always \"tag day,\" for when an order is  received, the first step in filling it is to make out a tag or form  stating how the shoe is to be made up and when it is to be finished.  These records are preserved, and if a customer writes, \"Send me 100  pairs of shoes like those ordered October 10, 1910,\" the manufacturer  has only to read the record in order to know exactly what is wanted.    [Illustration: _Courtesy United Shoe Mchy. Co._    THE GOODYEAR PULLING-OVER MACHINE    This machine cost $1,500,000 and five years of experiment to perfect.  It shapes the forepart of the upper of a shoe over a wooden last.]    Next, the leather is selected, first grade or second grade, according  to the price to be paid. The patterns for the uppers are now brought  into play--and, by the way, it is no small matter to prepare the  hundreds of patterns needed for a new line of shoes in all the  different"]]]
