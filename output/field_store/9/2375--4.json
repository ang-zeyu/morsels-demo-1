I found the  work simpler than I had hoped; the reasonable things ranged themselves  in the order I required, and the foolish things fell aside, and took  themselves away so soon as they were looked in the face. I had then,  with respect to Venetian architecture, the choice, either to establish  each division of law in a separate form, as I came to the features with  which it was concerned, or else to ask the reader's patience, while I  followed out the general inquiry first, and determined with him a code  of right and wrong, to which we might together make retrospective  appeal. I thought this the best, though perhaps the dullest way; and in  these first following pages I have therefore endeavored to arrange those  foundations of criticism, on which I shall rest in my account of  Venetian architecture, in a form clear and simple enough to be  intelligible even to those who never thought of architecture before. To  those who have, much of what is stated in them will be well known or  self-evident; but they must not be indignant at a simplicity on which  the whole argument depends for its usefulness. From that which appears a  mere truism when first stated, they will find very singular consequences  sometimes following,--consequences altogether unexpected, and of  considerable importance; I will not pause here to dwell on their  importance, nor on that of the thing itself to be done; for I believe  most readers will at once admit the value of a criterion of right and  wrong in so practical and costly an art as architecture, and will be apt  rather to doubt the possibility of its attainment than dispute its  usefulness if attained. I invite them, therefore, to a fair trial, being  certain that even if I should fail in my main purpose, and be unable to  induce in my reader the confidence of judgment I desire, I shall at  least receive his thanks for the suggestion of consistent reasons, which  may determine hesitating choice, or justify involuntary preference. And  if I should succeed, as I hope, in making the Stones of Venice  touchstones, and detecting, by the mouldering of her marble, poison more  subtle than ever was betrayed by the rending of her crystal; and if thus  I am enabled to show the baseness of the schools of architecture and  nearly every other art, which have for three centuries been predominant  in Europe, I believe the result of the inquiry may be serviceable for  proof of a more vital truth than any at which I have hitherto hinted.  For observe: I said the Protestant had despised the arts, and the  Rationalist corrupted them. But what has the Romanist done meanwhile? He  boasts that it was the papacy which raised the arts; why could it not  support them when it was left to its own strength? How came it to yield  to Classicalism which was based on infidelity, and to oppose no barrier  to innovations, which have reduced the once faithfully conceived imagery  of its worship to stage decoration? Shall we not rather find that  Romanism, instead of being a promoter of the arts, has never shown  itself capable of a single great conception since the separation of  Protestantism from its side?[27] So long as, corrupt though it might be,  no clear witness had been borne against it, so that it still included in  its ranks a vast number of faithful Christians, so long its arts were  noble. But the witness was borne--the error made apparent; and Rome,  refusing to hear the testimony or forsake the falsehood, has been struck  from that instant with an intellectual palsy, which has not only  incapacitated her from any further use of the arts which once were her  ministers, but has made her worship the shame of its own shrines, and  her worshippers their destroyers. Come, then, if truths such as these  are worth our thoughts; come, and let us know, before we enter the  streets of the Sea city, whether we are indeed to submit ourselves to  their undistinguished enchantment, and to look upon the last changes  which were wrought on the lifted forms of her palaces, as we should on  the capricious towering of summer clouds in the sunset, ere they sank  into the deep of night; or whether, rather, we shall not behold in the  brightness of their accumulated marble, pages on which the sentence of  her luxury was to be written until the waves should efface it, as they  fulfilled--\"God has numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.\"      FOOTNOTES:      [1] Appendix 1, \"Foundation of Venice.\"      [2] Appendix 2, \"Power of the Doges.\"      [3] Sismondi, Hist. des Rep.

THE VIRTUES OF ARCHITECTURE.      Sec. I. We address ourselves, then, first to the task of determining some  law of right which we may apply to the architecture of all the world and  of all time; and by help of which, and judgment according to which, we  may easily pronounce whether a building is good or noble, as, by  applying a plumb-line, whether it be perpendicular.    The first question will of course be: What are the possible Virtues of  architecture?    In the main, we require from buildings, as from men, two kinds of  goodness: first, the doing their practical duty well: then that they be  graceful and pleasing in doing it; which last is itself another form of  duty.    Then the practical duty divides itself into two branches,--acting and  talking:--acting, as to defend us from weather or violence; talking, as  the duty of monuments or tombs, to record facts and express feelings; or  of churches, temples, public edifices, treated as books of history, to  tell such history clearly and forcibly.    We have thus, altogether, three great branches of architectural virtue,  and we require of any building,--    1. That it act well, and do the things it was intended to do in the best      way.    2. That it speak well, and say the things it was intended to say in the      best words.    3. That it look well, and please us by its presence, whatever it has to      do or say.[28]    Sec. II. Now, as regards the second of these virtues, it is evident that  we can establish no general laws. First, because it is not a virtue  required in all buildings; there are some which are only for covert or  defence, and from which we ask no conversation. Secondly, because there  are countless methods of expression, some conventional, some natural:  each conventional mode has its own alphabet, which evidently can be no  subject of general laws. Every natural mode is instinctively employed  and instinctively understood, wherever there is true feeling; and this  instinct is above law. The choice of conventional methods depends on  circumstances out of calculation, and that of natural methods on  sensations out of control; so that we can only say that the choice is  right, when we feel that the means are effective; and we cannot always  say that it is wrong when they are not so.    A building which recorded the Bible history by means of a series of  sculptural pictures, would be perfectly useless to a person unacquainted  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30755"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 2 (of 3), (#10)"],[1,"and chequering of color in marble, by real tints in the print;  and have been content, therefore, to give them in line engraving. The  different triangles are, altogether, of ten kinds:      a. Pure white marble with sculptured surface (as the third and fifth         in the upper series of Plate III.).      b. Cast triangle of red brick with a sculptured round-headed piece of         white marble inlaid (as the first and seventh of the upper         series, Plate III.).      c. A plain triangle of greenish black marble, now perhaps         considerably paler in color than when first employed (as the         second and sixth of the upper series of Plate III.).      d. Cast red brick triangle, with a diamond inlaid of the         above-mentioned black marble (as the fourth in the upper series         of Plate III.).      e. Cast white brick, with an inlaid round-headed piece of marble,         variegated with black and yellow, or white and violet (not seen         in the plate).      f. Occurs only once, a green-veined marble, forming the upper part of         the triangle, with a white piece below.      g. Occurs only once. A brecciated marble of intense black and pure         white, the centre of the lower range in Plate III.      h. Sculptured white marble with a triangle of veined purple marble         inserted (as the first, third, fifth, and seventh of the lower         range in Plate III.).      i. Yellow or white marble veined with purple (as the second and sixth         of the lower range in Plate III.).      k. Pure purple marble, not seen in this plate.    [Illustration: Plate III.                 INLAID BANDS OF MURANO.]    Sec. XXI. The band, then, composed of these triangles, set close to each  other in varied but not irregular relations, is thrown, like a necklace  of precious stones, round the apse and along the ends of the aisles;  each side of the apse taking, of course, as many triangles as its width  permits. If the reader will look back to the measures of the sides of  the apse, given before, p. 42, he will see that the first and seventh of  the series, being much narrower than the rest, cannot take so many  triangles in their band. Accordingly, they have only six each, while the  other five sides have seven. Of these groups of seven triangles each,  that used for the third and fifth sides of the apse is the uppermost in  Plate III.; and that used for the centre of the apse, and of the whole  series, is the lowermost in the same plate; _the piece of black and  white marble being used to emphasize the centre of the chain_, exactly  as a painter would use a dark touch for a similar purpose.    Sec. XXII. And now, with a little trouble, we can set before the reader,  at a glance, the arrangement of the groups along the entire extremity of  the church.    There are thirteen recesses, indicative of thirteen arches, seen in the  ground plan, fig. 2, Plate I. Of these, the second and twelfth arches  rise higher than the rest; so high as to break the decorated band; and  the groups of triangles we have to enumerate are, therefore, only eleven  in number; one above each of the eleven low arches. And of these eleven,  the first and second, tenth and eleventh, are at the ends of the aisles;  while the third to the ninth, inclusive, go round the apse. Thus, in the  following table, the numerals indicate the place of each entire group  (counting from the south to the north side of the church, or from left  to right), and the letters indicate the species of triangle of which it  is composed, as described in the list given above.                            6. h. i. h. g. h. i. h.           5. b. c. a. d. a. c. b.       7. b. c. a. d. a. c. b.        4. b. a. b. c. a. e. a.             8. a. e. a. c. b. a. b.      3. b. a. b. e. b. a.                       9. a. b. e. b. a. b.    2. a. b. c.                                     10. a. b. c. b.    1. a. b. c. b. a.                               11. b. a. c. f. a. a.    The central group is put first, that it may be seen how the series on  the two sides of the apse answer each other. It was a very curious freak  to insert the triangle e, in the outermost place _but one_ of both the  fourth and eighth sides of the apse, and in the outermost _but two_ in  the third and ninth; in neither case having any balance to it in its own  group, and the real balance being only effected on the other side of the  apse, which it is impossible that any one should see at the same time.  This is one of the curious pieces of system which so often occur in  mediaeval work, of which the key is now lost. The groups at the ends of  the transepts correspond neither in number nor arrangement; we shall  presently see why, but must first examine more closely the treatment of  the triangles themselves, and the nature of the floral sculpture  employed upon them.    [Illustration: Plate IV.                 SCULPTURES OF MURANO.]    Sec. XXIII. As the scale of Plate III. is necessarily small, I have  given three of the sculptured triangles on a larger scale in Plate IV.  opposite. Fig. 3 is one of the four in the lower series of Plate IV.,  and figs. 4 and 5 from another group. The forms of the trefoils are here  seen more clearly; they, and all the other portions of the design, are  thrown out in low and flat relief, the intermediate spaces being cut out  to the depth of about a quarter of an inch. I believe these vacant  spaces were originally filled with a black composition, which is used in  similar sculptures at St. Mark's, and of which I found some remains in  an archivolt moulding here, though not in the triangles. The surface of  the whole would then be perfectly smooth, and the ornamental form  relieved by a ground of dark grey; but, even though this ground is lost,  the simplicity of the method insures the visibility of all its parts at  the necessary distance (17 or 18 feet), and the quaint trefoils have a  crispness and freshness of effect which I found it almost impossible to  render in a drawing. Nor let us fail to note in passing how strangely  delightful to the human mind the trefoil always is. We have it here  repeated five or six hundred times in the space of a few yards, and yet  are never weary of it. In fact, there are two mystical feelings at the  root of our enjoyment of this decoration: the one is the love of  trinity in unity, the other that of the sense of fulness with order; of  every place being instantly filled, and yet filled with propriety and  ease; the leaves do not push each other, nor put themselves out of their  own way, and yet whenever there is a vacant space, a leaf is always  ready to step in and occupy it.    Sec. XXIV. I said the trefoil was five or six hundred times repeated. It  is so, but observe, it is hardly ever twice of the same size; and this  law is studiously and resolutely observed. In the carvings _a_ and _b_ of  the upper series, Plate III., the diminution of the leaves might indeed  seem merely representative of the growth of the plant. But look at the  lower: the triangles of inlaid purple marble are made much more nearly  equilateral than those of white marble, into whose centres they are set,  so that the leaves may continually diminish in size as the ornament  descends at the sides. The reader may perhaps doubt the accuracy of the  drawing on the smaller scale, but in that given larger, fig. 3, Plate  IV., the angles are all measured, and the _purposeful_ variation of  width in the border therefore admits of no dispute.[14] Remember how  absolutely this principle is that of nature; the same leaf continually  repeated, but never twice of the same size. Look at the clover under  your feet, and then you will see what this Murano builder meant, and  that he was not altogether a barbarian.    Sec. XXV. Another point I wish the reader to observe is, the importance  attached to _color_ in the mind of the designer. Note especially--for it  is of the highest importance to see how the great principles of art are  carried out through the whole building--that, as only the white capitals  are sculptured below, only the white triangles are sculptured above. No  colored triangle is touched with sculpture; note also, that in the two  principal groups of the apse, given in Plate III., the centre of the  group is color, not sculpture, and the eye is evidently intended to be  drawn as much to the chequers of the stone, as to the intricacies of the  chiselling. It will be noticed also how much more precious the lower  series, which is central in the apse, is rendered, than the one above it  in the plate, which flanks it: there is no brick in the lower one, and  three kinds of variegated marble are used in it, whereas the upper is  composed of brick, with black and white marble only; and lastly--for  this is especially delightful--see how the workman made his chiselling  finer where it was to go with the variegated marbles, and used a bolder  pattern with the coarser brick and dark stone. The subtlety and  perfection of artistical feeling in all this are so redundant, that in  the building itself the eye can rest upon this colored chain with the  same kind of delight that it has in a piece of the embroidery of Paul  Veronese.    [Illustration: Fig. II.]    Sec. XXVI. Such being the construction of the lower band, that of the  upper is remarkable only for the curious change in its proportions. The  two are separated, as seen in the little woodcut here at the side, by  a string-course composed of two layers of red bricks, of which the  uppermost projects as a cornice, and is sustained by an intermediate  course of irregular brackets, obtained by setting the thick yellow  bricks edgeways, in the manner common to this day. But the wall above is  carried up perpendicularly from this projection, so that the whole upper  band is advanced to the thickness of a brick over the lower one. The  result of this is, of course, that each side of the apse is four or "]]]
