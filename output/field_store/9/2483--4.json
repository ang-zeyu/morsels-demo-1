Skull    In studying the osteology of the genus _Conophis_, I have examined  two complete skeletons (one _C. vittatus_ and one _C. lineatus_); two  additional skulls of _C. vittatus_ and _C. lineatus_; and 24 sets of  dentigerous bones, representing all of the species. Terminology  of the skeletal elements is that of Duellman (1958), Parker (1878),  Radovanovic (1937) and Szunyoghy (1932). The drawing of  the right side of the skull of a specimen of _Tomodon lineatus_ that  appears in Jan and Sordelli (1881:liv. 50, pl. 2, fig. 34) is of little  value due to its small size and lack of detail.    The skull of _Conophis_ is typical of a relatively unspecialized  colubrid snake. Skulls of _Conophis lineatus concolor_ and _C. vittatus_  closely resemble each other. The following description is based  primarily on the skull of _C. lineatus concolor_ (UMMZ S-778).    The elements are discussed in the following order: nasal region,  cranium and associated elements, maxillo-palatal-pterygoid arch,  mandible, dentition, and vertebrae.       [Illustration: FIG. 6. The skull, lacking dentigerous bones, of        _Conophis lineatus concolor_ (UMMZ S-788) showing (A) dorsal,        (B) lateral, and (C) ventral views. x 3.]    _Nasal region._--The premaxillary is relatively heavy and has a  concavity posteroventrally. The lateral processes slope downward, but  remain fairly thick, and do not project far laterally. This shape  (fig. 6) tends to strengthen the nasal region; this anterior  strengthening may be a reflection of the fossorial habits of these  snakes. There are no posterior processes of the premaxillary; thus the  line of fusion with the nasals and septo-maxillaries is broad. The  nasal plate is more than twice as long as wide. The nasals are  relatively flat above, although each curves slightly downward medially  and fuses into the medial nasal septum; laterally each nasal is  narrower and deflected downward, forming a small dorsal shield over  the nasal cavity. The septo-maxillaries are closely associated with  the vomers and form the cavity in which the organ of Jacobson is  situated. The broad medial part of the septo-maxillary forms the roof  and anterior border of the cavity, whereas the anterior part of the  vomer contains the main part of the capsule and forms the posterior  and most of the lateral borders of the cavity. The vomer has a thin  anterior ridge that gradually disappears before it reaches the border  of the premaxillary. The vomer is approximately U-shaped, when viewed  from below. It has no posterior process and does not articulate with  the parasphenoid; there is a sizeable gap between the two bones. The  septo-maxillary has a lateral process that terminally is directed  slightly anteriorly.    _Cranium and associated elements._--The frontal is almost three times  as long as it is wide; it is flat above with an emarginate  dorsolateral margin that forms the upper limit of the optic capsule.  Ventrally the frontal is concave and forms the median limits of the  optic cavity. Farther ventrally the frontal joins with the  parasphenoid, which at this place forms the ventral extent of the  skull, and together with the basisphenoid forms the ventral part of  the posterior three-fourths of the skull. In ventral aspect, the  parasphenoid is a long, thin bone, slightly expanded anteriorly. It  forms the anterior floor of the optic foramen; whereas the frontal  forms the anterior roof of the same opening. The frontal and its  septo-maxillary process surround the olfactory fenestra. The  prefrontal articulates with the anterolateral process of the frontal.  The posterior surface of the prefrontal forms the anterior wall of the  orbit of the eye. The articulating surface upon which the median  process of the maxillary bone rests is situated ventrally. The  anterior dorsal surface of the prefrontal, together with the  anterolateral edge of the frontal, extends slightly over the nasal  cavity, affording some degree of protection for the contained organs  and forming the posterior border of the cavity. A small nasal process  also extends anteriorly from the ventrolateral surface of the  prefrontal. The orbital-nasalis foramen is located in the anterior  surface of the prefrontal. The parietals are fused into one large bone  that forms the roof and sides of the middle part of the cranial  cavity. From its suture with the frontal, the dorsal surface of the  parietal is relatively flat in the area bounded laterally by the  parietal crests, which extend posteromedially from the anterolateral  corners of the bone and converge medially at a point near its  posterior margin. A slight posterior extension of the parietal crests  forms the supratemporal crest, which is present on the posterior part  of the parietal and on the anterior part of the supraoccipital. The  postfrontals are attached to the anterolateral processes of the  parietal. Together the anterior surfaces of these two bones form the  posterior rim of the orbit of the eye. The postfrontal extends  laterally and ventrally and has a terminal extension that projects  anterolaterally. In an articulated skull the trans-palatine articulates  with the ventrolateral articulating surface of the postfrontal.  Anteromedially, the parietal forms the roof and posterior margin of  the optic foramen. The basisphenoid, which is fused with the  parasphenoid, also forms a small part of the posteroventral margin of  the optic foramen. The basisphenoid forms the floor of the middle part  of the cranial cavity and the ventromedial down-pouching that  contains the pituitary body. Posterolateral to the parietal and dorsal  to the posterior part of the basisphenoid is the prootic. Laterally  this bone is deeply emarginate; posteriorly it forms a large part of  the otic notch, through which the columella passes. The columella is a  long, thin bony rod that terminates posteriorly in cartilage. It is  the cartilagenous part of the columella that connects with the  external sound detecting mechanism. There are several foramina on the  lateral surface of the prootic. On the anterolateral surface of the  prootic, branches of the trigeminal nerve pass through three foramina  whereas the facial nerve passes through the single posterior foramen  near the otic notch. The squamosal is attached dorsoventrally to the  posterior part of the parietal and to the lateral part of the prootic.  At this place of attachment there is on the prootic a relatively heavy  crest that forms a rather broad articulating base. The squamosal is  long, flat, and curves slightly in a dorsal direction throughout its  length; it becomes thinner and narrower posteriorly. The posterior  third of the squamosal forms a broad base by means of which the  squamosal articulates with the quadrate. The columella and the  squamosal extend posteriorly beyond the limits of the braincase.  Posteriorly the skull consists of four bones: an unpaired median  dorsal supraoccipital, an unpaired median ventral basioccipital and  two lateral exoccipitals. The basioccipital does not have noticeable  pterygoid processes, but is rather smooth ventrally and only slightly  emarginate on its posterolateral margins. Posteriorly, this bone forms  the ventral part of the occipital condyle. The rest of the condyle, on  each side, is formed by the exoccipitals. The exoccipitals also form  part of the base to which the squamosal is attached. The exoccipitals  extend around the sides of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3754"],[0,"The Wonders of Instinct: Chapters in the Psychology of Insects (#10)"],[1,"of the  joys of the sun, of the festivals of light. He wants to get out. What  does he find before him? A heap of filings easily dispersed with his  claws; next, a stone lid which he need not even break into fragments:  it comes undone in one piece; it is removed from its frame with a few  pushes of the forehead, a few tugs of the claws. In fact, I find the  lid intact on the threshold of the abandoned cells. Last comes a second  mass of woody remnants, as easy to disperse as the first. The road is  now free: the Cerambyx has but to follow the spacious vestibule, which  will lead him, without the possibility of mistake, to the exit. Should  the window not be open, all that he has to do is to gnaw through a thin  screen: an easy task; and behold him outside, his long antennae aquiver  with excitement.    What have we learnt from him? Nothing, from him; much from his grub.  This grub, so poor in sensory organs, gives us no little food for  reflection with its prescience. It knows that the coming Beetle will  not be able to cut himself a road through the oak and it bethinks  itself of opening one for him at its own risk and peril. It knows that  the Cerambyx, in his stiff armour, will never be able to turn and make  for the orifice of the cell; and it takes care to fall into its nymphal  sleep with its head to the door. It knows how soft the pupa's flesh  will be and upholsters the bedroom with velvet. It knows that the enemy  is likely to break in during the slow work of the transformation and,  to set a bulwark against his attacks, it stores a calcium pap inside  its stomach. It knows the future with a clear vision, or, to be  accurate, behaves as though it knew it. Whence did it derive the  motives of its actions? Certainly not from the experience of the  senses. What does it know of the outside world? Let us repeat, as much  as a bit of an intestine can know. And this senseless creature fills us  with amazement! I regret that the clever logician, instead of  conceiving a statue smelling a rose, did not imagine it gifted with  some instinct. How quickly he would have recognized that, quite apart  from sense-impressions, the animal, including man, possesses certain  psychological resources, certain inspirations that are innate and not  acquired!        CHAPTER 5. THE BURYING-BEETLES: THE BURIAL.    Beside the footpath in April lies the Mole, disembowelled by the  peasant's spade; at the foot of the hedge the pitiless urchin has  stoned to death the Lizard, who was about to don his green,  pearl-embellished costume. The passer-by has thought it a meritorious  deed to crush beneath his heel the chance-met Adder; and a gust of wind  has thrown a tiny unfeathered bird from its nest. What will become of  these little bodies and of so many other pitiful remnants of life? They  will not long offend our sense of sight and smell. The sanitary  officers of the fields are legion.    An eager freebooter, ready for any task, the Ant is the first to come  hastening and begin, particle by particle, to dissect the corpse. Soon  the odour of the corpse attracts the Fly, the genitrix of the odious  maggot. At the same time, the flattened Silpha, the glistening,  slow-trotting Horn-beetle, the Dermestes, powdered with snow upon the  abdomen, and the slender Staphylinus, all, whence coming no one knows,  hurry hither in squads, with never-wearied zeal, investigating, probing  and draining the infection.    What a spectacle, in the spring, beneath a dead Mole! The horror of  this laboratory is a beautiful sight for one who is able to observe and  to meditate. Let us overcome our disgust; let us turn over the unclean  refuse with our foot. What a swarming there is beneath it, what a  tumult of busy workers! The Silphae, with wing-cases wide and dark, as  though in mourning, fly distraught, hiding in the cracks in the soil;  the Saprini, of polished ebony which mirrors the sunlight, jog hastily  off, deserting their workshop; the Dermestes, of whom one wears a  fawn-coloured tippet, spotted with white, seek to fly away, but, tipsy  with their putrid nectar, tumble over and reveal the immaculate  whiteness of their bellies, which forms a violent contrast with the  gloom of the rest of their attire.    What were they doing there, all these feverish workers? They were  making a clearance of death on behalf of life. Transcendent alchemists,  they were transforming that horrible putridity into a living and  inoffensive product. They were draining the dangerous corpse to the  point of rendering it as dry and sonorous as the remains of an old  slipper hardened on the refuse-heap by the frosts of winter and the  heats of summer. They were working their hardest to render the carrion  innocuous.    Others will soon put in their appearance, smaller creatures and more  patient, who will take over the relic and exploit it ligament by  ligament, bone by bone, hair by hair, until the whole has been resumed  by the treasury of life. All honour to these purifiers! Let us put back  the Mole and go our way.    Some other victim of the agricultural labours of spring--a Shrew-mouse,  Field-mouse, Mole, Frog, Adder, or Lizard--will provide us with the  most vigorous and famous of these expurgators of the soil. This is the  Burying-beetle, the Necrophorus, so different from the cadaveric mob in  dress and habits. In honour of his exalted functions he exhales an  odour of musk; he bears a red tuft at the tip of his antennae; his  breast is covered with nankeen; and across his wing-cases he wears a  double, scalloped scarf of vermilion. An elegant, almost sumptuous  costume, very superior to that of the others, but yet lugubrious, as  befits your undertaker's man.    He is no anatomical dissector, cutting his subject open, carving its  flesh with the scalpel of his mandibles; he is literally a gravedigger,  a sexton. While the others--Silphae, Dermestes, Horn-beetles--gorge  themselves with the exploited flesh, without, of course, forgetting the  interests of the family, he, a frugal eater, hardly touches his booty  on his own account. He buries it entire, on the spot, in a cellar where  the thing, duly ripened, will form the diet of his larvae. He buries it  in order to establish his progeny therein.    This hoarder of dead bodies, with his stiff and almost heavy movements,  is astonishingly quick at storing away wreckage. In a shift of a few  hours, a comparatively enormous animal--a Mole, for  example--disappears, engulfed by the earth. The others leave the dried,  emptied carcass to the air, the sport of the winds for months on end;  he, treating it as a whole, makes a clean job of things at once. No  visible trace of his work remains but a tiny hillock, a burial-mound, a  tumulus.    With his expeditious method, the Necrophorus is the first of the little  purifiers of the fields. He is also one of the most celebrated of  insects in respect of his psychical capacities. This undertaker is  endowed, they say, with intellectual faculties approaching to reason,  such as are not possessed by the most gifted of the Bees and Wasps, the  collectors of honey or game. He is honoured by the two following  anecdotes, which I quote from Lacordaire's \"Introduction to  Entomology,\" the only general treatise at my disposal:    \"Clairville,\" says the author, \"records that he saw a Necrophorus  vespillo, who, wishing to bury a dead Mouse and finding the soil on  which the body lay too hard, proceeded to dig a hole at some distance  in soil more easily displaced. This operation completed, he attempted  to bury the Mouse in this cavity, but, not succeeding, he flew away,  returning a few moments later accompanied by four of his fellows, who  assisted him to move the Mouse and bury it.\"    In such actions, Lacordaire adds, we cannot refuse to admit the  intervention of reason.    \"The following case,\" he continues, \"recorded by Gledditsch, has also  every indication of the intervention of reason. One of his friends,  wishing to desiccate a Frog, placed it on the top of a stick thrust  into the ground, in order to make sure that the Necrophori should not  come and carry it off. But this precaution was of no effect; the  insects, being unable to reach the Frog, dug under the stick and,  having caused it to fall, buried it as well as the body.\" (\"Suites a  Buffon. Introduction a l'entomologie\" volume 2 pages 460-61.--Author's  Note.)    To grant, in the intellect of the insect, a lucid understanding of the  relations between cause and effect, between the end and the means, is  an affirmation of serious import. I know of scarcely any better adapted  to the philosophical brutalities of my time. But are these two little  stories really true? Do they involve the consequences deduced from  them? Are not those who accept them as reliable testimony a little  over-simple?    To be sure, simplicity is needed in entomology. Without a good dose of  this quality, a mental defect in the eyes of practical folk, who would  busy himself with the lesser creatures? Yes, let us be simple, without  being childishly credulous. Before making insects reason, let us reason  a little ourselves; let us, above all, consult the experimental test. A  fact gathered at hazard, without criticism, cannot establish a law.    I do not propose, O valiant grave-diggers, to belittle your merits;  such is far from being my intention. I have that in my notes, on the  other hand, which will do you more honour than the case of the gibbet  and the Frog; I have gleaned, for your benefit, examples of prowess  which will shed a new lustre upon your reputation.    No, my intention is not to lessen your renown. However, it is not the  business of impartial history to maintain a given thesis; it follows  whither the facts lead it. I wish simply to question you upon the power  of logic attributed to you. Do you or do you not enjoy gleams of  reason? Have you within you the humble germ of human thought? That is  the"]]]
