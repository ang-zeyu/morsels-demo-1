In the first case, we  see evidence of exanthematic diseases, which present only the lightest  forms of detersive disorders, such as measles, scarlatina, or that more  serious one, from its pustulous form, the small-pox. In the second case,  the elimination takes place from the intestinal canal, and then we see  produced in animals, as well as in men, the typhous diseases: that is to  say, the typhoid fever--a pustulous and ulcerous malady of the  intestines--or the common typhus of the hospitals, prisons, and  campaigning armies; and again, in animals, there is also the typhus of  the steppes, of the marshes, &c.    The Eastern pestilence, the plague of Rome in the age of Antoninus and  the plague of Athens, which might have given to Hippocrates the right  of treating with Artaxerxes as one potentate treats with another, ought  perhaps to be classed among those typhuses not subject to recurrence.    As for the _cholera_, it seems to be a contagious and epidemic disorder,  of a distinct and particular kind. We are ignorant of its essential  cause, its nature, and its mode of treatment; and although it has  prevailed in every age, and even frequently of late years, it will  always, by reason of the strange formation of our medical institutions,  find us as weak and defenceless to resist its attack as we have ever  been.    If we have been properly understood, typhous diseases are, above all,  general febrile affections. At one time the _materies morbi_, or  discharge, affects the skin; at another, the digestive mucous membrane.  When it acts upon the skin, as clinical observation shows, there is  sometimes a sort of hesitation in the eruptive process; people wonder  what disease is coming forth; the eruption wavers in the form it will  assume, till at length its real character is determined. The same  uncertainty prevails when the intestines are affected. Sometimes the  exanthema is merely the equivalent of simple measles or scarlatina of  the intestinal mucous membrane, and many typhoid fevers of short  continuance are nothing else in their nature. The same occurs in common  typhuses. Sometimes the local affection proceeds as far as pustulous  eruption, sometimes only to exanthematic rubefaction; hence the various  alterations which we have witnessed in the intestines of cattle killed  in our presence at the slaughter-houses of the Metropolitan Market, and  which we ourselves dissected. The experienced Professor Bouley, from the  Ecole Veterinaire of Alfort, near Paris, whose visit must have been  beneficial to England, clearly recognised in an ox which was slaughtered  and dissected at the Metropolitan Market, the genuine pustule of typhoid  fever. But in most cases, as we shall show, it is the other forms which  prevail.    We make these observations in order to anticipate the objections of  those reasoners who, being more influenced and guided by the local facts  and by the symptoms, than by the general phenomena of comparative  pathology, might argue that such or such fact is opposed to our  doctrine.    In a word, then, typhous diseases have their types; but the living being  is subjected to so many different influences, hereditary, idiosyncratic,  climataic, hygienic, &c., that by the side of one subject going through  the course of morbid phenomena with fatal regularity, another may be  seen in which such or such functional derangement is readily  distinguished. Thus in some animals, predisposed thereto by prior  disorders, the morbid action originally propelled towards the channels  of respiration will continue to be most salient; and after dissection  the lungs will be congested and emphysematous, and the intestines  relatively but scarcely altered. The animal, indeed, though bordering on  typhus, will sink under the effect of functional derangement in the  breathing passages. In others, by the influence of some particular  predisposing cause, disorders of the nervous centres will be signalized;  a cerebral and spinal pains will be intolerable, delirium will quickly  ensue, and the asphyxiated patient, if a man, will succumb in the course  of a few days; or if an ox, he will be wild and ungovernable, and then  fall as if thunderstruck, fastened to his stall. Finally, in other  cases, these first two phases of the distemper will not prove fatal, the  intestinal injuries will pursue their course, and the affected animals  will not die until the third period.    As we have seen, the morbid phenomena may be different, although the  affection continues the same; the typhoid fever or the typhus being  nevertheless the essential disease which prevails.    These generalities, to some readers, may appear irrelevant, but let them  not be mistaken; they have a claim to our notice, and are really  important. They show, indeed, that independent of the preventive  treatment, which is an absolute rule in the case of virulent,  contagious, and non-recurring diseases, the treatment of the disease  itself, when it has declared itself, and when it pursues its course,  cannot be the same for every patient; and that, moreover, this treatment  must vary in the different phases of the disease, as physicians and  veterinarians are well aware.    These generalities, likewise, explain the various diseases--viz., those  in which the animals blend together the typhous and exanthematic  diseases. The measles and the scarlet fever, affecting the external or  internal membranes, are like the first steps of these maladies; they are  generally slight, and we have but to watch over the progress of the  symptoms, and to assist nature, which, with few exceptions, brings all  things to a favourable issue.    These disorders, which are relatively slight and do not provoke in the  economy any of those changes which in some sort transform the  constitution, are not absolutely proof against relapse. They lead us  rationally and by degrees to the more infectious and contagious  diseases, to the common typhus; therefore it is unnecessary to apply the  preventive treatment to them, that being exclusively reserved for the  latter.    Let it then be well understood, that the typhus of the ox, the study of  which we are about to enter upon, may vary in its symptoms and  post-mortem appearances, without losing thereby the characteristic mark  which renders it a thoroughly distinct, and, in the present day, a  thoroughly well known distemper.    Now that the reader possesses these general notions of the Contagious  Typhus, we shall be able to speak to him in a language which he will  understand, and give a definition which he will be able to judge and  appreciate.    The typhus of the ox, then, is a _virulent, contagious, febrile, and  non-recurring disease, with stupor and derangement of the nervous,  respiratory, and digestive functions; leaving various changes in the  respective organs of these functions, and chiefly in the intestines_.    This new definition seems to us to be more faithful and just than those  hitherto given; and this, if needed, we could demonstrate.    I do not disguise from myself that some of the opinions expressed in  these generalities may, at first sight, appear strange and liable to  objection. Thus, it may be argued that inoculation as a preventive  treatment of typhous maladies is far from being a general law,  applicable to every case; since in Russia, for instance, where this  inoculation is practised every day, it completely fails in certain  foreign herds, and they die of the consequences of the operation; and  that this, therefore, might happen in England.    To these objections we would reply, first, as regards the novelty of  opinions expressed, that we have taken up the pen, because we had to  write something different from what has already been published in known  works, otherwise it would have been our duty to remain silent; and  secondly, as regards the inefficacy of inoculation, that organic and  vital phenomena have their principles and their laws, which are fixed  and invincible, from which it is reasonable to deduce consequences and  positive rules of conduct, which cannot yield to superannuated opinions  or imperfectly executed experiments. To institute experiments indeed  under the rigorous conditions of a logical and irrefutable  demonstration, is not so easy a matter as may generally be thought.    For our part, the principles deduced from strict observation are the  basis on which we build, and if it so chance that we are baffled in our  experiments we vary them indefinitely; and if still we are deceived in  our hopes, we ascribe the miscarriage to our impotence, to inadequate  means, and to the defective instruments which the physical and chemical  sciences, still in their cradle as regards organic matter, supply for  our use. Above all, we wish it to be remembered--\"_Scribo nec ficta, nec  picta, sed quae ratio, sensus, et experientia docent._\"          CHAPTER II.    _The Origin and Causes of the Ox Typhus._      I.    I have drawn my conclusions as to the preventive treatment of typhus in  the ox, from the knowledge I had acquired of its morbid phenomena, its  nature, and its non-recurrence; and it is a logical deduction quite as  accurate as could be the result of a syllogism. The study of the origin  of this typhus, and of the causes by which it is generated and spread  abroad, will supply us with additional arguments to sustain this  deduction, as well as those signs and indications which are the very  foundation of curative treatment. The description of the disease will  contribute to the same result; for the rational treatment of a distemper  can be derived only from a knowledge of all the phenomena which occasion  it, of the functional derangements, and of the alterations observed in  bodies after death.    I wish particularly to say at once, in entering upon the subject of  etiology, that the special works which treat of it contain precise"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36504"],[0,"Freshwater Sponges, Hydroids & Polyzoa (#10)"],[1," spines. Sometimes spicules of the same type form a  more or less irregular transverse network at the base or on the surface  of the sponge.    [Illustration: Fig. 4.--Part of an oscular collar of _Spongilla  lacustris_ subsp. _reticulata_, showing arrangement of microscleres in  the derma (magnified).]    From the systematist's point of view, the structure of the free spicules  found scattered in the substance and membrane of the sponge, and  especially of those that form the armature of the gemmules, is of more  importance than that of the skeleton-spicules. Free spicules are absent  in many species; when present they are usually needle-like and pointed  at the tips. In a few species, however, they are of variable or  irregular form, or consist of several or many shafts meeting in a common  central nodule. In one genus (_Corvospongilla_) they resemble a double  grappling-iron in form, having a circle of strongly recurved hooks at  both ends. The free microscleres, or flesh-spicules as they are often  called, are either smooth, granular, or spiny.    Gemmule-spicules, which form a characteristic feature of the  Spongillidae, are very seldom absent when the gemmules are mature. They  are of the greatest importance in distinguishing the genera. In their  simplest form they closely resemble the free microscleres, but in  several genera they bear, either at or near one end or at or near both  ends, transverse disks which are either smooth or indented round the  edge. In one genus (_Pectispongilla_) they are provided at both ends not  with disks but with vertically parallel rows of spines resembling combs  in appearance.    The simpler spicules of the Spongillidae are formed in single cells (see  fig. 2 E), but those of more complicated shape are produced by several  cells acting in concert. Each spicule, although it is formed mainly of  hydrated silica (opal), contains a slender organic filament running  along its main axis inside the silica. This filament, or rather the tube  in which it is contained, is often quite conspicuous, and in some  species (e. g., _Spongilla crassissima_) its termination is marked at  both ends of the megasclere by a minute conical protuberance in the  silica.    Unless sponges are alchemists and can transmute one element into  another, the material of which the spicules are made must ultimately  come from the water in which the sponges live, or the rocks or other  bodies to or near which they are attached. The amount of water that must  pass through a large specimen of such a sponge as _Spongilla carteri_ in  order that it may obtain materials for its skeleton must be enormous,  for silica is an insoluble substance. I have noticed, however, that this  sponge is particularly abundant and grows with special luxuriance in  ponds in which clothes are washed with soap, and my friend Mr. G. H.  Tipper has suggested to me that possibly the alkali contained in the  soap-suds may assist the sponge in dissolving out the silica contained  in the mud at the bottom of the ponds. The question of how the mineral  matter of the skeleton is obtained is, however, one about which we know  nothing definite.    The spongin that binds the skeleton-spicules together takes the form of  a colourless or yellowish transparent membrane, which is often  practically invisible. When very abundant it sometimes extends across  the nodes of the skeleton as a delicate veil. In some sponges it also  forms a basal membrane in contact with the object to which the sponge is  attached, and in some such cases the spongin of the radiating fibres is  in direct continuity with that of the basal membrane.      COLOUR AND ODOUR.    Most freshwater sponges have a bad odour, which is more marked in some  species than in others. This odour is not peculiar to the Spongillidae,  for it is practically identical with that given out by the common marine  sponge _Halichondria panicea_. Its function is probably protective, but  how it is produced we do not know.    The coloration of freshwater sponges is usually dull and uniform, but  _Pectispongilla aurea_ is of the brilliant yellow indicated by its name,  while many species are of the bright green shade characteristic of  chlorophyll, the colouring matter of the leaves of plants. Many species  are brown or grey, and some are almost white.    These colours are due to one of three causes, or to a combination of  more than one of them, viz.:--(1) the inhalation of solid inorganic  particles, which are engulfed by the cells; (2) the presence in the  cells of coloured substances, solid or liquid, produced by the vital  activities of the sponge; and (3) the presence in the cells of peculiar  organized living bodies known as \"green corpuscles.\"    Sponges living in muddy water are often nearly black. This is because  the cells of their parenchyma are gorged with very minute solid  particles of silt. If a sponge of the kind is kept in clean water for a  few days, it often becomes almost white. An interesting experiment is  easily performed to illustrate the absorption and final elimination of  solid colouring matter by placing a living sponge (small specimens of  _Spongilla carteri_ are suitable) in a glass of clean water, and  sprinkling finely powdered carmine in the water. In a few hours the  sponge will be of a bright pink colour, but if only a little carmine is  used at first and no more added, it will regain its normal greyish hue  in a few days.    The colouring matter produced by the sponge itself is of two  kinds--pigment, which is probably a waste product, and the substances  produced directly by the ingestion of food or in the process of its  digestion. When pigment is produced it takes the form of minute granules  lying in the cells of the parenchyma, the dermal membrane being as a  rule colourless. Very little is known about the pigments of freshwater  sponges, and even less about the direct products of metabolism. It is  apparently the latter, however, that give many otherwise colourless  sponges a slight pinkish or yellowish tinge directly due to the presence  in cells of the parenchyma of minute liquid globules. In one form of  _Spongilla carteri_ these globules turn of a dark brown colour if  treated with alcohol. The brilliant colour of _Pectispongilla aurea_ is  due not to solid granules but to a liquid or semi-liquid substance  contained in the cells.    The green corpuscles of the Spongillidae are not present in all species.  There is every reason to think that they represent a stage in the  life-history of an alga, and that they enter the sponge in an active  condition (see p. 49).    A fourth cause for the coloration of freshwater sponges may be noted  briefly. It is not a normal one, but occurs commonly in certain forms  (e. g., _Spongilla alba_ var. _bengalensis_). This cause is the growth  in the canals and substance of the sponge of parasitic algaae, which turn  the whole organism of a dull green colour. They do not do so, however,  until they have reduced it to a dying state. The commonest parasite of  the kind is a filamentous species particularly common in brackish water  in the Ganges delta.      EXTERNAL FORM AND CONSISTENCY.    [Illustration: Fig. 5.--Part of a type-specimen of _Spongilla lacustris_  subsp. _reticulata_ (nat. size).]    The external form of sponges is very variable, but each species,  subspecies, or variety of the Spongillidae has normally a characteristic  appearance. The European race of _Spongilla lacustris_, for example,  consists in favourable circumstances of a flattened basal part from  which long cylindrical branches grow out; while in the Indian race of  the species these branches are flattened instead of being cylindrical,  and anastomose freely. The structure of the branches is identical with  that of the basal part. Many other species (for instance, _Spongilla  bombayensis_ and _S. ultima_) never produce branches but always consist  of lichenoid or cushion-shaped masses. The appearance of _Spongilla  crateriformis_, when it is growing on a flattened surface which allows  it to develop its natural form, is very characteristic, for it consists  of little flattened masses that seem to be running out towards one  another, just as though the sponge had been dropped, spoonful by  spoonful, in a viscous condition from a teaspoon. Some species, such as  _Trochospongilla phillottiana_, cover large areas with a thin film of  uniform thickness, while others (e. g., _Spongilla alba_ and _Ephydatia  meyeni_) consist of irregular masses, the surface of which bears  numerous irregular ridges or conical, subquadrate, or digitate  processes. In a few forms (e. g., _Corvospongilla burmanica_) the  surface is covered with small turret-like projections of considerable  regularity, and some (e. g., _Spongilla crassissima_) naturally assume a  spherical or oval shape with an absolutely smooth surface.    The production of long branches is apparently rare in tropical  freshwater sponges.    The form of the oscula is characteristic in many cases. No other Indian  species has them so large, or with such well-defined margins as  _Spongilla carteri_ (Pl. II, fig. 1). In many species (Pl. II, fig. 3)  they have a stellate appearance owing to the fact that grooves in the  substance of the sponge radiate round them beneath the external  membrane. In other species they are quite inconspicuous and very small.    [Illustration: Fig. 6.--Radial section through part of a dried sponge of  _Spongilla crassissima_ (from Calcutta), x 5.]    Spongillidae differ greatly in consistency. _Spongilla crassissima_ and  _Corvospongilla lapidosa_ are almost stony, although the former is  extremely light, more like pumice than true stone. Other species (e. g.,  _Trochospongilla latouchiana_) are hard but brittle, while others again  are soft and easily compressed, as _Spongilla lacustris_, the variety  _mollis_ of _S. carteri_, and _S. crateriformis_.
