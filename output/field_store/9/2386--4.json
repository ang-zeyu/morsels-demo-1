You make me so nervous I don't  know what I'm doing.) This is Mr. Lemuel Goodridge. He is a minister.\"    DAN:--\"You ought to see his mouth. Uncle Roger says the drawing string  has fell out of it. It just hangs loose--so fashion.\"    Dan, whose own mouth was far from being beautiful, here gave an  imitation of the Rev. Lemuel's, to the utter undoing of Peter, Felix,  and myself. Our wild guffaws of laughter penetrated even Great-aunt  Eliza's deafness, and she glanced up with a startled face. What we would  have done I do not know had not Felicity at that moment appeared in the  doorway with panic-stricken eyes and exclaimed,    \"Cecily, come here for a moment.\"    Cecily, glad of even a temporary respite, fled to the kitchen and we  heard her demanding what was the matter.    \"Matter!\" exclaimed Felicity, tragically. \"Matter enough! Some of you  left a soup plate with molasses in it on the pantry table and Pat got  into it and what do you think? He went into the spare room and walked  all over Aunt Eliza's things on the bed. You can see his tracks plain as  plain. What in the world can we do? She'll be simply furious.\"    I looked apprehensively at Great-aunt Eliza; but she was gazing  intently at a picture of Aunt Janet's sister's twins, a most stolid,  uninteresting pair; but evidently Great-aunt Eliza found them amusing  for she was smiling widely over them.    \"Let us take a little clean water and a soft bit of cotton,\" came  Cecily's clear voice from the kitchen, \"and see if we can't clean the  molasses off. The coat and hat are both cloth, and molasses isn't like  grease.\"    \"Well, we can try, but I wish the Story Girl would keep her cat home,\"  grumbled Felicity.    The Story Girl here flew out to defend her pet, and we four boys sat on,  miserably conscious of Great-aunt Eliza, who never said a word to us,  despite her previously expressed desire to become acquainted with us.  She kept on looking at the photographs and seemed quite oblivious of our  presence.    Presently the girls returned, having, as transpired later, been so  successful in removing the traces of Paddy's mischief that it was not  deemed necessary to worry Great-aunt Eliza with any account of it.  Felicity announced tea and, while Cecily conveyed Great-aunt Eliza out  to the dining-room, lingered behind to consult with us for a moment.    \"Ought we to ask her to say grace?\" she wanted to know.    \"I know a story,\" said the Story Girl, \"about Uncle Roger when he was  just a young man. He went to the house of a very deaf old lady and when  they sat down to the table she asked him to say grace. Uncle Roger had  never done such a thing in his life and he turned as red as a beet  and looked down and muttered, 'E-r-r, please excuse me--I--I'm not  accustomed to doing that.' Then he looked up and the old lady said  'Amen,' loudly and cheerfully. She thought Uncle Roger was saying grace  all the time.\"    \"I don't think it's right to tell funny stories about such things,\" said  Felicity coldly. \"And I asked for your opinion, not for a story.\"    \"If we don't ask her, Felix must say it, for he's the only one who can,  and we must have it, or she'd be shocked.\"    \"Oh, ask her--ask her,\" advised Felix hastily.    She was asked accordingly and said grace without any hesitation, after  which she proceeded to eat heartily of the excellent supper Felicity had  provided. The rusks were especially good and Great-aunt Eliza ate three  of them and praised them. Apart from that she said little and during the  first part of the meal we sat in embarrassed silence. Towards the last,  however, our tongues were loosened, and the Story Girl told us a tragic  tale of old Charlottetown and a governor's wife who had died of a broken  heart in the early days of the colony.    \"They say that story isn't true,\" said Felicity. \"They say what she  really died of was indigestion. The Governor's wife who lives there now  is a relation of our own. She is a second cousin of father's but we've  never seen her. Her name was Agnes Clark. And mind you, when father was  a young man he was dead in love with her and so was she with him.\"    \"Who ever told you that?\" exclaimed Dan.    \"Aunt Olivia. And I've heard ma teasing father about it, too. Of course,  it was before father got acquainted with mother.\"    \"Why didn't your father marry her?\" I asked.    \"Well, she just simply wouldn't marry him in the end. She got over being  in love with him. I guess she was pretty fickle. Aunt Olivia said father  felt awful about it for awhile, but he got over it when he met ma.  Ma was twice as good-looking as Agnes Clark. Agnes was a sight for  freckles, so Aunt Olivia says. But she and father remained real good  friends. Just think, if she had married him we would have been the  children of the Governor's wife.\"    \"But she wouldn't have been the Governor's wife then,\" said Dan.    \"I guess it's just as good being father's wife,\" declared Cecily  loyally.    \"You might think so if you saw the Governor,\" chuckled Dan. \"Uncle Roger  says it would be no harm to worship him because he doesn't look like  anything in the heavens above or on the earth beneath or the waters  under the earth.\"    \"Oh, Uncle Roger just says that because he's on the opposite side of  politics,\" said Cecily. \"The Governor isn't really so very ugly. I saw  him at the Markdale picnic two years ago. He's very fat and bald and  red-faced, but I've seen far worse looking men.\"    \"I'm afraid your seat is too near the stove, Aunt Eliza,\" shouted  Felicity.    Our guest, whose face was certainly very much flushed, shook her head.    \"Oh, no, I'm very comfortable,\" she said. But her voice had the effect  of making us uncomfortable. There was a queer, uncertain little sound  in it. Was Great-aunt Eliza laughing at us? We looked at her sharply  but her face was very solemn. Only her eyes had a suspicious appearance.  Somehow, we did not talk much more the rest of the meal.    When it was over Great-aunt Eliza said she was very sorry but she must  really go. Felicity politely urged her to stay, but was much relieved  when Great-aunt Eliza adhered to her intention of going. When Felicity  took her to the spare room Cecily slipped upstairs and presently came  back with a little parcel in her hand.    \"What have you got there?\" demanded Felicity suspiciously.    \"A--a little bag of rose-leaves,\" faltered Cecily. \"I thought I'd give  them to Aunt Eliza.\"    \"The idea! Don't you do such a thing,\" said Felicity contemptuously.  \"She'd think you were crazy.\"    \"She was awfully nice when I asked her for her name for the quilt,\"  protested Cecily, \"and she took a ten-cent section after all. So I'd  like to give her the rose-leaves--and I'm going to, too, Miss Felicity.\"    Great-aunt Eliza accepted the little gift quite graciously, bade us  all good-bye, said she had enjoyed herself very much, left messages for  father and mother, and finally betook herself away. We watched her cross  the yard, tall, stately, erect, and disappear down the lane. Then,  as often aforetime, we gathered together in the cheer of the red  hearth-flame, while outside the wind of a winter twilight sang through  fair white valleys brimmed with a reddening sunset, and a faint, serene,  silver-cold star glimmered over the willow at the gate.    \"Well,\" said Felicity, drawing a relieved breath, \"I'm glad she's gone.  She certainly is queer, just as mother said.\"    \"It's a different kind of queerness from what I expected, though,\" said  the Story Girl meditatively. \"There's something I can't quite make out  about Aunt Eliza. I don't think I altogether like her.\"    \"I'm precious sure I don't,\" said Dan.    \"Oh, well, never mind. She's gone now and that's the last of it,\" said  Cecily comfortingly.    But it wasn't the last of it--not by any manner of means was it! When  our grown-ups returned almost the first words Aunt Janet said were,    \"And so you had the Governor's wife to tea?\"    We all stared at her.    \"I don't know what you mean,\" said Felicity. \"We had nobody to tea  except Great-aunt Eliza. She came this afternoon and--\"    \"Great-aunt Eliza? Nonsense,\" said Aunt Janet. \"Aunt Eliza was in town  today. She had tea with us at Aunt Louisa's. But wasn't Mrs. Governor  Lesley here? We met her on her way back to Charlottetown and she told  us she was. She said she was visiting a friend in Carlisle and thought  she'd call to see father for old acquaintance sake. What in the world  are all you children staring like that for? Your eyes are like saucers.\"    \"There was a lady here to tea,\" said Felicity miserably, \"but we thought  it was Great-aunt Eliza--she never SAID she wasn't--I thought she acted  queer--and we all yelled at her as if she was deaf--and said things to  each other about her nose--and Pat running over her clothes--\"    \"She must have heard all you said while I was showing her the  photographs, Dan,\" cried Cecily.    \"And about the Governor at tea time,\" chuckled unrepentant Dan.    \"I want to know what all this means,\" said Aunt Janet sternly.    She knew in due time, after she had pieced the story together from  our disjointed accounts. She was horrified, and Uncle Alec was mildly  disturbed, but Uncle Roger roared with laughter and Aunt Olivia echoed  it.    \"To think you should have so little sense!\" said Aunt Janet in a  disgusted tone.    \"I think it was real mean of her to pretend she was deaf,\" said  Felicity, almost on the verge of tears.    \"That was Agnes Clark all over,\" chuckled Uncle Roger. \"How she must  have enjoyed this afternoon!\"    She had enjoyed it, as we learned the next day, when a letter came from  her.    \"Dear Cecily and all the rest of you,\" wrote the Governor's wife, \"I  want to ask you to forgive me for pretending to be Aunt Eliza. I  suspect it was a little horrid of me, but really I couldn't "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31619"],[0,"The Planet Savers (#10)"],[1," off, and Kendricks  crowded up beside us to examine the wound.    \"A clean cut,\" he said, but I didn't hear. Something had turned over  inside me, like a hand stirring up my brain, and....           *       *       *       *       *    Jay Allison looked around with a gasp of sudden vertigo. He was not in  Forth's office, but standing precariously near the edge of a cliff. He  shut his eyes briefly, wondering if he were having one of his worst  nightmares, and opened them on a familiar face.    Buck Kendricks was bone-white, his mouth widening as he said hoarsely,  \"Jay! Doctor Allison--for God's sake--\"    A doctor's training creates reactions that are almost reflexes; Jay  Allison recovered some degree of sanity as he became aware that someone  was stretched out in front of him, half-naked, and bleeding profusely.  He motioned away the crowding strangers and said in his bad Darkovan,  \"Let her alone, this is my work.\" He didn't know enough words to curse  them away, so he switched to Terran, speaking to Kendricks:    \"Buck, get these people away, give the patient some air. Where's my  surgical case?\" He bent and probed briefly, realizing only now that the  injured was a woman, and young.    The wound was only a superficial laceration; whatever sharp instrument  had inflicted it, had turned on the costal bone without penetrating lung  tissue. It could have been sutured, but Kendricks handed him only a  badly-filled first-aid kit; so Dr. Allison covered it tightly with a  plastic clip-shield which would seal it from further bleeding, and let  it alone. By the time he had finished, the strange girl had begun to  stir. She said haltingly, \"Jason--?\"    \"Dr. Allison,\" he corrected tersely, surprised in a minor way--the major  surprise had blurred lesser ones--that she knew his name. Kendricks  spoke swiftly to the girl, in one of the Darkovan languages Jay didn't  understand, and then drew Jay aside, out of earshot. He said in a shaken  voice, \"Jay, I didn't know--I wouldn't have believed--you're _Doctor  Allison_? Good Lord--Jason!\"    And then he moved fast. \"What's the matter? Oh, hell, Jay, don't faint  on me!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Jay was aware that he didn't come out of it too bravely, but anyone who  blamed him (he thought resentfully) should try it on for size; going to  sleep in a comfortably closed-in office and waking up on a cliff at the  outer edges of nowhere. His hand hurt; he saw that it was bleeding and  flexed it experimentally, trying to determine that no tendons had been  injured. He rapped, \"How did this happen?\"    \"Sir, keep your voice down--or speak Darkovan!\"    Jay blinked again. Kendricks was still the only familiar thing in a  strangely vertiginous universe. The Spaceforce man said huskily. \"Before  heaven, Jay, I hadn't any idea--and I've known you how long? Eight, nine  years?\"    Jay said, \"That idiot Forth!\" and swore, the colorless profanity of an  indoor man.    Somebody shouted, \"Jason!\" in an imperative voice, and Kendricks said  shakily, \"Jay, if they see you--you literally are not the same man!\"    \"Obviously not.\" Jay looked at the tent, one pole still unpitched.  \"Anyone in there?\"    \"Not yet.\" Kendricks almost shoved him inside. \"I'll tell them--I'll  tell them something.\" He took a radiant from his pocket, set it down and  stared at Allison in the flickering light, and said something profane.  \"You'll--you'll be all right here?\"    Jay nodded. It was all he could manage. He was keeping a tight hold on  his nerve; if it went, he'd start to rave like a madman. A little time  passed, there were strange noises outside, and then there was a polite  cough and a man walked into the tent.    He was obviously a Darkovan aristocrat and looked vaguely familiar,  though Jay had no conscious memory of seeing him before. Tall and  slender, he possessed that perfect and exquisite masculine beauty  sometimes seen among Darkovans, and he spoke to Jay familiarly but with  surprising courtesy:    \"I have told them you are not to be disturbed for a moment, that your  hand is worse than we believed. A surgeon's hands are delicate things,  Doctor Allison, and I hope that yours are not badly injured. Will you  let me look?\"    Jay Allison drew back his hand automatically, then, conscious of the  churlishness of the gesture, let the stranger take it in his and look at  the fingers. The man said, \"It does not seem serious. I was sure it was  something more than that.\" He raised grave eyes. \"You don't even  remember my name, do you, Dr. Allison?\"    \"You know who I am?\"    \"Dr. Forth didn't tell me. But we Hasturs are partly telepathic,  Jason--forgive me--Doctor Allison. I have known from the first that you  were possessed by a god or daemon.\"    \"Superstitious rubbish,\" Jay snapped. \"Typical of a Darkovan!\"    \"It is a convenient manner of speaking, no more,\" said the young Hastur,  overlooking the rudeness. \"I suppose I could learn your terminology, if  I considered it worth the effort. I have had psi training, and I can  tell the difference when half of a man's soul has driven out the other  half. Perhaps I can restore you to yourself--\"    \"If you think I'd have some Darkovan freak meddling with my mind--\" Jay  began hotly, then stopped. Under Regis' grave eyes, he felt a surge of  unfamiliar humility. This crew of men needed their leader, and obviously  he, Jay Allison, wasn't the leader they needed. He covered his eyes with  one hand.    Regis bent and put a hand on his shoulder, compassionately, but Jay  twitched it off, and his voice, when he found it, was bitter and  defensive and cold.    \"All right. The work's the thing. I can't do it, Jason can. You're a  parapsych. If you can switch me off--go right ahead!\"           *       *       *       *       *    I stared at Regis, passing a hand across my forehead. \"What happened?\" I  demanded, and in even swifter apprehension, \"Where's Kyla? She was  hurt--\"    \"Kyla's all right,\" Regis said, but I got up quickly to make sure. Kyla  was outside, lying quite comfortably on a roll of blankets. She was  propped on her elbow drinking something hot, and there was a good smell  of hot food in the air. I stared at Regis and demanded, \"I didn't conk  out, did I, from a little scratch like this?\" I looked carelessly at my  gashed hand.    \"Wait--\" Regis held me back, \"don't go out just yet. Do you remember  what happened, Doctor Allison?\"    I stared in growing horror, my worst fear confirmed. Regis said quietly,  \"You--changed. Probably from the shock of seeing--\" he stopped in  mid-sentence, and I said, \"The last thing I remember is seeing that Kyla  was bleeding, when we got her clothes off. But--good Gods, a little  blood wouldn't scare _me_, and Jay Allison's a surgeon, would it bring  him roaring up like that?\"    \"I couldn't say.\" Regis looked as if he knew more than he was telling.  \"I don't believe that Dr. Allison--he's not much like you--was very  concerned with Kyla. Are you?\"    \"Damn right I am. I want to make sure she's all right--\" I stopped  abruptly. \"Regis--did they all see it?\"    \"Only Kendricks and I,\" Regis said, \"and we will not speak of it.\"    I said, \"Thanks,\" and felt his reassuring hand-clasp. Damn it, demigod  or prince, I _liked_ Regis.    I went out and accepted some food from the kettle and sat down between  Kyla and Kendricks to eat. I was shaken, weak with reaction.  Furthermore, I realized that we couldn't stay here. It was too  vulnerable to attack. So, in our present condition, were we. If we could  push on hard enough to get near Dammerung pass tonight, then tomorrow we  could cross it early, before the sun warmed the snow and we had  snowslides and slush to deal with. Beyond Dammerung, I knew the  tribesmen and could speak their language.    I mentioned this, and Kendricks looked doubtfully at Kyla. \"Can she  climb?\"    \"Can she stay here?\" I countered. But I went and sat beside her anyhow.    \"How badly are you hurt? Do you think you can travel?\"    She said fiercely, \"Of course I can climb! I tell you, I'm no weak girl,  I'm a free Amazon!\" She flung off the blanket somebody had tucked around  her legs. Her lips looked a little pinched, but the long stride was  steady as she walked to the fire and demanded more soup.    We struck the camp in minutes. The trailmen band of raiding females had  snatched up almost everything portable, and there was no sense in  striking and caching the tent; they'd return and hunt it out. If we came  back with a trailmen escort, we wouldn't need it anyway. I ordered them  to leave everything but the lightest gear, and examined each remaining  rucksack. Rations for the night we would spend in the pass, our few  remaining blankets, ropes, sunglasses. Everything else I ruthlessly  ordered left behind.    It was harder going now. For one thing, the sun was lowering, and the  evening wind was icy. Nearly everyone of us had some hurt, slight in  itself, which hindered us in climbing. Kyla was white and rigid, but did  not spare herself; Kendricks was suffering severely from mountain  sickness at this altitude, and I gave him all the help I could, but with  my stiffening slashed hand I wasn't having too easy a time myself.    There was one expanse that was sheer rock-climbing, flattened like bugs  against a wall, scrabbling for hand-holds and footholds. I felt it a  point of pride to lead, and I led; but by the time we had climbed the  thirty-foot wall, and scrambled along a ledge to where we could pick up  the trail again, I was ready to give over. Crowding together on the  ledge, I changed places with the veteran Lerrys, who was better than  most professional climbers.    He muttered, \"I thought you said this was a _trail_!\"    I stretched my mouth in what was supposed to be a grin and didn't quite  make it. \"For the trailmen, this is a superhighway. And no one else ever  comes this way.\"    Now we climbed slowly over snow; once or twice we had to"]]]
