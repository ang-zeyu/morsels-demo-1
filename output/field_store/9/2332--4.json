However, Sextus  Caesar was in fear for the young man, lest he should be taken by  his enemies, and brought to punishment; so he sent some to denounce  expressly to Hyrcanus that he should acquit Herod of the capital charge  against him; who acquitted him accordingly, as being otherwise inclined  also so to do, for he loved Herod.    8. But Herod, supposing that he had escaped punishment without the  consent of the king, retired to Sextus, to Damascus, and got every thing  ready, in order not to obey him if he should summon him again; whereupon  those that were evil-disposed irritated Hyrcanus, and told him that  Herod was gone away in anger, and was prepared to make war upon him; and  as the king believed what they said, he knew not what to do, since he  saw his antagonist was stronger than he was himself. And now, since  Herod was made general of Coelesyria and Samaria by Sextus Caesar, he  was formidable, not only from the good-will which the nation bore him,  but by the power he himself had; insomuch that Hyrcanus fell into the  utmost degree of terror, and expected he would presently march against  him with his army.    9. Nor was he mistaken in the conjecture he made; for Herod got his army  together, out of the anger he bare him for his threatening him with the  accusation in a public court, and led it to Jerusalem, in order to throw  Hyrcanus down from his kingdom; and this he had soon done, unless his  father and brother had gone out together and broken the force of his  fury, and this by exhorting him to carry his revenge no further than to  threatening and affrighting, but to spare the king, under whom he had  been advanced to such a degree of power; and that he ought not to be so  much provoked at his being tried, as to forget to be thankful that  he was acquitted; nor so long to think upon what was of a melancholy  nature, as to be ungrateful for his deliverance; and if we ought to  reckon that God is the arbitrator of success in war, an unjust cause  is of more disadvantage than an army can be of advantage; and that  therefore he ought not to be entirely confident of success in a case  where he is to fight against his king, his supporter, and one that had  often been his benefactor, and that had never been severe to him, any  otherwise than as he had hearkened to evil counselors, and this no  further than by bringing a shadow of injustice upon him. So Herod was  prevailed upon by these arguments, and supposed that what he had already  done was sufficient for his future hopes, and that he had enough shown  his power to the nation.    10. In the mean time, there was a disturbance among the Romans about  Apamia, and a civil war occasioned by the treacherous slaughter of  Sextus Caesar, by Cecilius Bassus, which he perpetrated out of his  good-will to Pompey; he also took the authority over his forces; but as  the rest of Caesar's commanders attacked Bassus with their whole army,  in order to punish him for the murder of Caesar, Antipater also sent  them assistance by his sons, both on account of him that was murdered,  and on account of that Caesar who was still alive, both of which were  their friends; and as this war grew to be of a considerable length,  Marcus came out of Italy as successor to Sextus.              CHAPTER 11.           Herod Is Made Procurator Of All Syria; Malichus Is Afraid Of       Him, And Takes Antipater Off By Poison; Whereupon The       Tribunes Of The Soldiers Are Prevailed With To Kill Him.    1. There, was at this time a mighty war raised among the Romans upon the  sudden and treacherous slaughter of Caesar by Cassius and Brutus, after  he had held the government for three years and seven months. 14 Upon  this murder there were very great agitations, and the great men were  mightily at difference one with another, and every one betook himself to  that party where they had the greatest hopes of their own, of advancing  themselves. Accordingly, Cassius came into Syria, in order to receive  the forces that were at Apamia, where he procured a reconciliation  between Bassus and Marcus, and the legions which were at difference with  him; so he raised the siege of Apamia, and took upon him the command of  the army, and went about exacting tribute of the cities, and demanding  their money to such a degree as they were not able to bear.    2. So he gave command that the Jews should bring in seven hundred  talents; whereupon Antipater, out of his dread of Cassius's threats,  parted the raising of this sum among his sons, and among others of his  acquaintance, and to be done immediately; and among them he required  one Malichus, who was at enmity with him, to do his part also, which  necessity forced him to do. Now Herod, in the first place, mitigated the  passion of Cassius, by bringing his share out of Galilee, which was a  hundred talents, on which account he was in the highest favor with him;  and when he reproached the rest for being tardy, he was angry at the  cities themselves; so he made slaves of Gophna and Emmaus, and two  others of less note; nay, he proceeded as if he would kill Malichus,  because he had not made greater haste in exacting his tribute; but  Antipater prevented the ruin of this man, and of the other cities, and  got into Cassius's favor by bringing in a hundred talents immediately.  15    3. However, when Cassius was gone Malichus forgot the kindness that  Antipater had done him, and laid frequent plots against him that  had saved him, as making haste to get him out of the way, who was an  obstacle to his wicked practices; but Antipater was so much afraid of  the power and cunning of the man, that he went beyond Jordan, in order  to get an army to guard himself against his treacherous designs; but  when Malichus was caught in his plot, he put upon Antipater's sons by  his impudence, for he thoroughly deluded Phasaelus, who was the guardian  of Jerusalem, and Herod who was intrusted with the weapons of war, and  this by a great many excuses and oaths, and persuaded them to procure  his reconciliation to his father. Thus was he preserved again by  Antipater, who dissuaded Marcus, the then president of Syria, from  his resolution of killing Malichus, on account of his attempts for  innovation.    4. Upon the war between Cassius and Brutus on one side, against the  younger Caesar [Augustus] and Antony on the other, Cassius and Marcus  got together an army out of Syria; and because Herod was likely to have  a great share in providing necessaries, they then made him procurator of  all Syria, and gave him an army of foot and horse. Cassius promised him  also, that after the war was over, he would make him king of Judea. But  it so happened that the power and hopes of his son became the cause of  his perdition; for as Malichus was afraid of this, he corrupted one  of the king's cup-bearers with money to give a poisoned potion to  Antipater; so he became a sacrifice to Malichus's wickedness, and died  at a feast. He was a man in other respects active in the management  of affairs, and one that recovered the government to Hyrcanus, and  preserved it in his hands.    5. However, Malichus, when he was suspected of poisoning Antipater, and  when the multitude was angry with him for it, denied it, and made the  people believe he was not guilty. He also prepared to make a greater  figure, and raised soldiers; for he did not suppose that Herod would  be quiet, who indeed came upon him with an army presently, in order to  revenge his father's death; but, upon hearing the advice of his brother  Phasaelus, not to punish him in an open manner, lest the multitude  should fall into a sedition, he admitted of Malichus's apology, and  professed that he cleared him of that suspicion; he also made a pompous  funeral for his father.    6. So Herod went to Samaria, which was then in a tumult, and settled the  city in peace; after which at the [Pentecost] festival, he returned  to Jerusalem, having his armed men with him: hereupon Hyrcanus, at the  request of Malichus, who feared his reproach, forbade them to introduce  foreigners to mix themselves with the people of the country while they  were purifying themselves; but Herod despised the pretense, and him that  gave that command, and came in by night. Upon which Malithus came to  him, and bewailed Antipater; Herod also made him believe [he admitted  of his lamentations as real], although he had much ado to restrain his  passion at him; however, he did himself bewail the murder of his father  in his letters to Cassius, who, on other accounts, also hated Malichus.  Cassius sent him word back that he should avenge his father's death upon  him, and privately gave order to the tribunes that were under him, that  they should assist Herod in a righteous action he was about.    7. And because, upon the taking of Laodicea by Cassius, the men of power  were gotten together from all quarters, with presents and crowns in  their hands, Herod allotted this time for the punishment of Malichus.  When Malichus suspected that, and was at Tyre, he resolved to withdraw  his son privately from among the Tyrians, who was a hostage there, while  he got ready to fly away into Judea; the despair he was in of escaping  excited him to think of greater things; for he hoped that he should  raise the nation to a revolt from the Romans, while Cassius was busy  about the war against Antony, and that he should easily depose Hyrcanus,  and get the crown for himself.    8. But fate laughed at the hopes he had; for Herod foresaw what he  was so zealous about, and invited both Hyrcanus and him to supper; but  calling one of the principal servants that stood by him to him, he  sent him out, as though it were to get things ready for supper, but in  reality to give notice beforehand"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2853"],[0,"Quo Vadis: A Narrative of the Time of Nero (#10)"],[1,"of long standing can inspire  thee.\"    \"Petronius and I,\" answered Seneca, \"are men of two opposite camps; I  know of no method against him, he yields to no man's influence. Perhaps  with all his corruption he is worthier than those scoundrels with whom  Nero surrounds himself at present. But to show him that he has done an  evil deed is to lose time simply. Petronius has lost long since that  faculty which distinguishes good from evil. Show him that his act is  ugly, he will be ashamed of it. When I see him, I will say, 'Thy act is  worthy of a freedman.' If that will not help thee, nothing can.\"    \"Thanks for that, even,\" answered the general.    Then he gave command to carry him to the house of Vinicius, whom he  found at sword practice with his domestic trainer. Aulus was borne away  by terrible anger at sight of the young man occupied calmly with fencing  during the attack on Lygia; and barely had the curtain dropped  behind the trainer when this anger burst forth in a torrent of bitter  reproaches and injuries. But Vinicius, when he learned that Lygia had  been carried away, grew so terribly pale that Aulus could not for even  an instant suspect him of sharing in the deed. The young man's forehead  was covered with sweat; the blood, which had rushed to his heart for a  moment, returned to his face in a burning wave; his eyes began to shoot  sparks, his mouth to hurl disconnected questions. Jealousy and rage  tossed him in turn, like a tempest. It seemed to him that Lygia,  once she had crossed the threshold of Caesar's house, was lost to him  absolutely. When Aulus pronounced the name of Petronius, suspicion flew  like a lightning flash through the young soldier's mind, that Petronius  had made sport of him, and either wanted to win new favor from Nero by  the gift of Lygia, or keep her for himself. That any one who had seen  Lygia would not desire her at once, did not find a place in his head.  Impetuousness, inherited in his family, carried him away like a wild  horse, and took from him presence of mind.    \"General,\" said he, with a broken voice, \"return home and wait for me.  Know that if Petronius were my own father, I would avenge on him the  wrong done to Lygia. Return home and wait for me. Neither Petronius nor  Caesar will have her.\"    Then he went with clinched fists to the waxed masks standing clothed in  the atrium, and burst out,--\"By those mortal masks! I would rather kill  her and myself.\" When he had said this, he sent another \"Wait for me\"  after Aulus, then ran forth like a madman from the atrium, and flew to  Petronius's house, thrusting pedestrians aside on the way.    Aulus returned home with a certain encouragement. He judged that if  Petronius had persuaded Caesar to take Lygia to give her to Vinicius,  Vinicius would bring her to their house. Finally, the thought was no  little consolation to him, that should Lygia not be rescued she would be  avenged and protected by death from disgrace. He believed that Vinicius  would do everything that he had promised. He had seen his rage, and he  knew the excitability innate in the whole family. He himself, though he  loved Lygia as her own father, would rather kill her than give her  to Caesar; and had he not regarded his son, the last descendant of his  stock, he would doubtless have done so. Aulus was a soldier; he had  hardly heard of the Stoics, but in character he was not far from their  ideas,--death was more acceptable to his pride than disgrace.    When he returned home, he pacified Pomponia, gave her the consolation  that he had, and both began to await news from Vinicius. At moments when  the steps of some of the slaves were heard in the atrium, they thought  that perhaps Vinicius was bringing their beloved child to them, and  they were ready in the depth of their souls to bless both. Time passed,  however, and no news came. Only in the evening was the hammer heard on  the gate.    After a while a slave entered and handed Aulus a letter. The old  general, though he liked to show command over himself, took it with a  somewhat trembling hand, and began to read as hastily as if it were a  question of his whole house.    All at once his face darkened, as if a shadow from a passing cloud had  fallen on it.    \"Read,\" said he, turning to Pomponia.    Pomponia took the letter and read as follows:--    \"Marcus Vinicius to Aulus Plautius greeting. What has happened, has  happened by the will of Caesar, before which incline your heads, as I and  Petronius incline ours.\"    A long silence followed.          Chapter VI      PETRONIUS was at home. The doorkeeper did not dare to stop Vinicius, who  burst into the atrium like a storm, and, learning that the master of  the house was in the library, he rushed into the library with the same  impetus. Finding Petronius writing, he snatched the reed from his hand,  broke it, trampled the reed on the floor, then fixed his fingers into  his shoulder, and, approaching his face to that of his uncle, asked,  with a hoarse voice,--\"What hast thou done with her? Where is she?\"    Suddenly an amazing thing happened. That slender and effeminate  Petronius seized the hand of the youthful athlete, which was grasping  his shoulder, then seized the other, and, holding them both in his one  hand with the grip of an iron vice, he said,--\"I am incapable only in  the morning; in the evening I regain my former strength. Try to  escape. A weaver must have taught thee gymnastics, and a blacksmith thy  manners.\"    On his face not even anger was evident, but in his eyes there was a  certain pale reflection of energy and daring. After a while he let  the hands of Vinicius drop. Vinicius stood before him shamefaced and  enraged.    \"Thou hast a steel hand,\" said he; \"but if thou hast betrayed me, I  swear, by all the infernal gods, that I will thrust a knife into thy  body, though thou be in the chambers of Caesar.\"    \"Let us talk calmly,\" said Petronius. \"Steel is stronger, as thou seest,  than iron; hence, though out of one of thy arms two as large as mine  might be made, I have no need to fear thee. On the contrary, I grieve  over thy rudeness, and if the ingratitude of men could astonish me yet,  I should be astonished at thy ingratitude.\"    \"Where is Lygia?\"    \"In a brothel,--that is, in the house of Caesar.\"    \"Petronius!\"    \"Calm thyself, and be seated. I asked Caesar for two things, which he  promised me,--first, to take Lygia from the house of Aulus, and second  to give her to thee. Hast thou not a knife there under the folds of thy  toga? Perhaps thou wilt stab me! But I advise thee to wait a couple of  days, for thou wouldst be taken to prison, and meanwhile Lygia would be  wearied in thy house.\"    Silence followed. Vinicius looked for some time with astonished eyes on  Petronius; then he said,--\"Pardon me; I love her, and love is disturbing  my faculties.\"    \"Look at me, Marcus. The day before yesterday I spoke to Caesar as  follows: 'My sister's son, Vinicius, has so fallen in love with a lean  little girl who is being reared with the Auluses that his house is  turned into a steambath from sighs. Neither thou, O Caesar, nor I--we who  know, each of us, what true beauty is--would give a thousand sesterces  for her; but that lad has ever been as dull as a tripod, and now he has  lost all the wit that was in him.'\"    \"Petronius!\"    \"If thou understand not that I said this to insure Lygia's safety, I am  ready to believe that I told the truth. I persuaded Bronzebeard that a  man of his aesthetic nature could not consider such a girl beautiful; and  Nero, who so far has not dared to look otherwise than through my eyes,  will not find in her beauty, and, not finding it, will not desire her.  It was necessary to insure ourselves against the monkey and take him  on a rope. Not he, but Poppaea, will value Lygia now; and Poppaea will  strive, of course, to send the girl out of the palace at the earliest.  I said further to Bronzebeard, in passing: 'Take Lygia and give her to  Vinicius! Thou hast the right to do so, for she is a hostage; and if  thou take her, thou wilt inflict pain on Aulus.' He agreed; he had not  the least reason not to agree, all the more since I gave him a chance  to annoy decent people. They will make thee official guardian of the  hostage, and give into thy hands that Lygian treasure; thou, as a friend  of the valiant Lygians, and also a faithful servant of Caesar, wilt not  waste any of the treasure, but wilt strive to increase it. Caesar, to  preserve appearances, will keep her a few days in his house, and then  send her to thy insula. Lucky man!\"    \"Is this true? Does nothing threaten her there in Caesar's house?\"    \"If she had to live there permanently, Poppaea would talk about her to  Locusta, but for a few days there is no danger. Ten thousand people  live in it. Nero will not see her, perhaps, all the more since he left  everything to me, to the degree that just now the centurion was here  with information that he had conducted the maiden to the palace and  committed her to Acte. She is a good soul, that Acte; hence I gave  command to deliver Lygia to her. Clearly Pomponia Graecina is of that  opinion too, for she wrote to Acte. To-morrow there is a feast at  Nero's. I have requested a place for thee at the side of Lygia.\"    \"Pardon me, Caius, my hastiness. I judged that thou hadst given command  to take her for thyself or for Caesar.\"    \"I can forgive thy hastiness; but it is more difficult to forgive rude  gestures, vulgar shouts, and a voice reminding one of players at mora. I  do not like that style, Marcus, and do thou guard against it. Know that  Tigellinus is Caesar's pander; but know also that if I wanted the  girl for myself now, looking thee straight in the eyes, I would say,  'Vinicius! I take Lygia from thee and I will keep her till I am tired of  her.\"    Thus speaking, he began to look with his hazel eyes straight into the  eyes of Vinicius with a cold and"]]]
