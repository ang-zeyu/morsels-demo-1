We have passed quickly over the interval between the first meeting of  Monsieur de Lamotte and Derues, and the moment when the victims fell  into the trap: we might easily have invented long conversations, and  episodes which would have brought Derues' profound hypocrisy into  greater relief; but the reader now knows all that we care to show him.  We have purposely lingered in our narration in the endeavour to explain  the perversities of this mysterious organisation; we have over-loaded it  with all the facts which seem to throw any light upon this sombre  character. But now, after these long preparations, the drama opens, the  scenes become rapid and lifelike; events, long impeded, accumulate and  pass quickly before us, the action is connected and hastens to an end.  We shall see Derues like an unwearied Proteus, changing names, costumes,  language, multiplying himself in many forms, scattering deceptions and  lies from one end of France to the other; and finally, after so many  efforts, such prodigies of calculation and activity, end by wrecking  himself against a corpse.    The letter written at Buisson-Souef arrived at Paris the morning of the  14th of December. In the course of the day an unknown man presented  himself at the hotel where Madame de Lamotte and her son had stayed  before, and inquired what rooms were vacant. There were four, and he  engaged them for a certain Dumoulin, who had arrived that morning from  Bordeaux, and who had passed through Paris in order to meet, at some  little distance, relations who would return with him. A part of the rent  was paid in advance, and it was expressly stipulated that until his  return the rooms should not be let to anyone, as the aforesaid Dumoulin  might return with his family and require them at any moment. The same  person went to other hotels in the neighbourhood and engaged vacant  rooms, sometimes for a stranger he expected, sometimes for friends whom  he could not accommodate himself.    At about three o'clock, the Place de Greve was full of people, thousands  of heads crowded the windows of the surrounding houses. A parricide was  to pay the penalty of his crime--a crime committed under atrocious  circumstances, with an unheard-of refinement of barbarity. The  punishment corresponded to the crime: the wretched man was broken on the  wheel. The most complete and terrible silence prevailed in the multitude  eager for ghastly emotions. Three times already had been heard the heavy  thud of the instrument which broke the victim's limbs, and a loud cry  escaped the sufferer which made all who heard it shudder with horror,  One man only, who, in spite of all his efforts, could not get through  the crowd and cross the square, remained unmoved, and looking  contemptuously towards the criminal, muttered, \"Idiot! he was unable to  deceive anyone!\"    A few moments later the flames began to rise from the funeral pile, the  crowd began to move, and the than was able to make his way through and  reach one of the streets leading out of the square.    The sky was overcast, and the grey daylight hardly penetrated the narrow  lane, hideous and gloomy as the name it bore, and which; only a few  years ago, still wound like a long serpent through the mire of this  quarter. Just then it was deserted, owing to the attraction of the  execution close by. The man who had just left the square proceeded  slowly, attentively reading all the inscriptions on the doors. He  stopped at Number 75, where on the threshold of a shop sat a stout woman  busily knitting, over whom one read in big yellow letters, \"Widow  Masson.\" He saluted the woman, and asked--    \"Is there not a cellar to let in this house?\"    \"There is, master,\" answered the widow.    \"Can I speak to the owner?\"    \"And that is myself, by your leave.\"    \"Will you show me the cellar? I am a provincial wine merchant, my  business often brings me to Paris, and I want a cellar where I could  deposit wine which I sell on commission.\"    They went down together. After examining the place, and ascertaining  that it was not too damp for the expensive wine which he wished to leave  there, the man agreed about the rent, paid the first term in advance,  and was entered on the widow Masson's books under the name of Ducoudray.  It is hardly necessary to remark that it should have been Derues.    When he returned home in the evening, his wife told him that a large box  had arrived.    \"It is all right,\" he said, \"the carpenter from whom I ordered it is a  man of his word.\" Then he supped, and caressed his children. The next  day being Sunday, he received the communion, to the great edification of  the devout people of the neighbourhood.    On Monday the 16th Madame de Lamotte and Edouard, descending from the  Montereau stagecoach, were met by Derues and his wife.    \"Did my husband write to you, Monsieur Derues?\" inquired Madame de  Lamotte.    \"Yes, madame, two days ago; and I have arranged our dwelling for your  reception.\"    \"What! but did not Monsieur de Lamotte ask you to engage the rooms I  have had before at the Hotel de France?\"    \"He did not say so, and if that was your idea I trust you will change  it. Do not deprive me of the pleasure of offering you the hospitality  which for so long I have accepted from you. Your room is quite ready,  also one for this dear boy,\" and so saying he took Edouard's hand; \"and  I am sure if you ask his opinion, he will say you had better be content  to stay with me.\"    \"Undoubtedly,\" said the boy; \"and I do not see why there need be any  hesitation between friends.\"    Whether by accident, or secret presentiment, or because she foresaw a  possibility of business discussions between them, Madame de Lamotte  objected to this arrangement. Derues having a business appointment which  he was bound to keep, desired his wife to accompany the Lamottes to the  Hotel de France, and in case of their not being able to find rooms  there, mentioned three others as the only ones in the quarter where they  could be comfortably accommodated. Two hours later Madame de Lamotte and  her son returned to his house in the rue Beaubourg.    The house which Derues occupied stood opposite the rue des Menoriers,  and was pulled down quite lately to make way for the rue Rambuteau. In  1776 it was one of the finest houses of the rue Beaubourg, and it  required a certain income to be able to live there, the rents being  tolerably high. A large arched doorway gave admittance to a passage,  lighted at the other end by a small court, on the far side of which was  the shop into which Madame de Lamotte had been taken on the occasion of  the accident. The house staircase was to the right of the passage; and  the Derues' dwelling on the entresol. The first room, lighted by a  window looking into the court, was used as a dining room, and led into a  simply furnished sitting-room, such as was generally found among the  bourgeois and tradespeople of this period. To the right of the  sitting-room was a large closet, which could serve as a small study or  could hold a bed; to the left was a door opening into the Derues'  bedroom, which had been prepared for Madame de Lamotte. Madame Derues  would occupy one of the two beds which stood in the alcove. Derues had a  bed made up in the sitting-room, and Edouard was accommodated in the  little study.    Nothing particular happened during the first few days which followed the  Lamottes' arrival. They had not come to Paris only on account of the  Buisson-Souef affairs. Edouard was nearly sixteen, and after much  hesitation his parents had decided on placing him in some school where  his hitherto neglected education might receive more attention. Derues  undertook to find a capable tutor, in whose house the boy would be  brought up in the religious feeling which the cure of Buisson and his  own exhortations had already tended to develop. These proceedings, added  to Madame de Lamotte's endeavours to collect various sums due to her  husband, took some time. Perhaps, when on the point of executing a  terrible crime, Derues tried to postpone the fatal moment, although,  considering his character, this seems unlikely, for one cannot do him  the honour of crediting him with a single moment of remorse, doubt, or  pity. Far from it, it appears from all the information which can be  gathered, that Derues, faithful to his own traditions, was simply  experimenting on his unfortunate guests, for no sooner were they in his  house than both began to complain of constant nausea, which they had  never suffered from before. While he thus ascertained the strength of  their constitution, he was able, knowing the cause of the malady, to  give them relief, so that Madame de Lamotte, although she grew daily  weaker, had so much confidence in him as to think it unnecessary to call  in a doctor. Fearing to alarm her husband, she never mentioned her  sufferings, and her letters only spoke of the care and kind attention  which she received.    On the 15th of January, 1777, Edouard was placed in a school in the rue  de l'Homme Arme. His mother never saw him again. She went out once more  to place her husband's power of attorney with a lawyer in the rue de  Paon. On her return she felt so weak and broken-down that she was  obliged to go to bed and remain there for several days. On January 29th  the unfortunate lady had risen, and was sitting near the window which  overlooked the deserted rue des Menetriers, where clouds of snow were  drifting before the wind. Who can guess the sad thoughts which may have  possessed her?--all around dark, cold, and silent, tending to produce  painful depression and involuntary dread. To escape the gloomy ideas  which besieged her, her mind went back to the smiling times of her youth  and marriage. She recalled the time when, alone at Buisson during her  husband's enforced absences, she wandered with her child in the cool and  shaded walks of the park, and "]]]
