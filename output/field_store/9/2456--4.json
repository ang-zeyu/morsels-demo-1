Fascinated, he extended his stay to a  fortnight, seeing many dreadful sights, for Torrington had established a  sort of amateur clinic, and a hundred cases a day came to him for  treatment.    \"And it comes from the bite of a tsetse fly?\" said Cuthbert. \"Show me a  tsetse.\"    Torrington obliged him, and when the other saw the little black insect  he went white to the lips.    \"My God!\" he whispered, \"I've been bitten by that!\"    \"It doesn't follow----\" began Torrington; but Cuthbert was blundering  and stumbling in wild fear to his carriers' camp.    \"Get your loads!\" he yelled. \"Out of this cursed country we get as quick  as we can!\"    Torrington, with philosophical calm, endeavoured to reassure him, but he  was not to be appeased.    He left Etebi that night and camped in the forest. Three days later he  reached a mission station, where he complained of headaches and pains in  the neck (he had not attended Torrington's clinics in vain). The  missionary, judging from the man's haggard appearance and general  incoherence that he had an attack of malaria, advised him to rest for a  few days; but Cuthbert was all a-fret to reach the coast. Twenty miles  from the mission, Cuthbert sent his carriers back, and said he would  cover the last hundred miles of the journey alone.    To this extraordinary proposition the natives agree--from that day  Cuthbert disappeared from the sight of man.           *     *     *     *     *    Sanders was taking a short cut through the forest to avoid the  interminable twists and bends of the river, when he came suddenly upon a  village of death--four sad little huts, built hastily amidst a tangle of  underwood. He called, but nobody answered him. He was too wary to enter  any of the crazy habitations.    He knew these little villages in the forest. It was the native custom to  take the aged and the dying--especially those who died sleepily--to  far-away places, beyond the reach of man, and leave them there with a  week's food and a fire, to die in decent solitude.    He called again, but only the forest answered him. The chattering, noisy  forest, all a-crackle with the movements of hidden things. Yet there was  a fire burning which told of life.    Sanders resumed his journey, first causing a quantity of food to be laid  in a conspicuous place for the man who made the fire.    He was on his way to take evidence concerning the disappearance of  Cuthbert. It was the fourth journey of its kind he had attempted. There  had been palavers innumerable.    Bosambo, chief of the Ochori, had sorrowfully disgorged the presents he  had received, and admitted his fault.    \"Lord!\" he confessed, \"when I was with the white man on the coast I  learnt the trick of writing--it is a cursed gift--else all this trouble  would not have come about. For, desiring to show my people how great a  man I was, I wrote a letter in the English fashion, and sent it by  messenger to the coast and thence to friends in Sierra Leone, telling  them of my fortune. Thus the people in London came to know of the  treasure of this land.\"    Sanders, in a few illuminative sentences, conveyed his impression of  Bosambo's genius.    \"You slave and son of a slave,\" he said, \"whom I took from a prison to  rule the Ochori, why did you deceive this white man, selling him lands  that were not yours?\"    \"Lord!\" said Bosambo simply, \"there was nothing else I could sell.\"    But there was no clue here as to Cuthbert's whereabouts, nor at the  mission station, nor amongst the carriers detained on suspicion. One man  might have thrown light upon the situation, but Torrington was at home  fulfilling the post of assistant examiner in mechanics at South  Kensington (more in his element there) and filling in his spare time  with lecturing on \"The Migration of the Bantu Races.\"    So that the end of Sanders' fourth quest was no more successful than the  third, or the second, or the first, and he retraced his steps to  headquarters, feeling somewhat depressed.    He took the path he had previously traversed, and came upon the Death  Camp late in the afternoon. The fire still burnt, but the food he had  placed had disappeared. He hailed the hut in the native tongue, but no  one answered him. He waited for a little while, and then gave orders for  more food to be placed on the ground.    \"Poor devil!\" said Sanders, and gave the order to march. He himself had  taken half a dozen steps, when he stopped. At his feet something  glittered in the fading light. He stooped and picked it up. It was an  exploded cartridge. He examined it carefully, smelt it--it had been  recently fired. Then he found another. They were Lee-Metford, and bore  the mark \"'07,\" which meant that they were less than a year old.    He was still standing with the little brass cylinders in his hand, when  Abiboo came to him.    \"Master,\" said the Houssa, \"who ties monkeys to trees with ropes?\"    \"Is that a riddle?\" asked Sanders testily, for his mind was busy on this  matter of cartridges.    Abiboo for answer beckoned him.    Fifty yards from the hut was a tree, at the foot of which, whimpering  and chattering and in a condition of abject terror, were two small black  monkeys tethered by ropes.    They spat and grinned ferociously as Sanders approached them. He looked  from the cartridges to the monkeys and back to the cartridges again,  then he began searching the grass. He found two more empty shells and a  rusting lancet, such as may be found in the pocket-case of any explorer.      Then he walked back to the hut before which the fire burnt, and called  softly--    \"Mr. Cuthbert!\"    There was no answer, and Sanders called again--    \"Mr. Cuthbert!\"    From the interior of the hut came a groan.    \"Leave me alone. I have come here to die!\" said a muffled voice.    \"Come out and be civil,\" said Sanders coolly; \"you can die afterwards.\"    After a few moments' delay there issued from the door of the hut the  wreck of a man, with long hair and a month-old beard, who stood sulkily  before the Commissioner.    \"Might I ask,\" said Sanders, \"what your little game is?\"    The other shook his head wearily. He was a pitiable sight. His clothes  were in tatters; he was unwashed and grimy.    \"Sleeping sickness,\" he said wearily. \"Felt it coming on--seen what  horrible thing it was--didn't want to be a burden. Oh, my God! What a  fool I've been to come to this filthy country!\"    \"That's very likely,\" said Sanders. \"But who told you that you had  sleeping sickness?\"    \"Know it--know it,\" said the listless man.    \"Sit down,\" said Sanders. The other obeyed, and Sanders applied the  superficial tests.    \"If you've got sleeping sickness,\" said Sanders, after the examination,  \"I'm suffering from religious mania--man, you're crazy!\"    Yet there was something in Cuthbert's expression that was puzzling. He  was dull, heavy, and stupid. His movements were slow and lethargic.    Sanders watched him as he pulled a black wooden pipe from his ragged  pocket, and with painful slowness charged it from a skin pouch.    \"It's got me, I tell you,\" muttered Cuthbert, and lit the pipe with a  blazing twig from the fire. \"I knew it (puff) as soon as that fellow  Torrington (puff) described the symptoms (puff);--felt dull and  sleepy--got a couple of monkeys and injected my blood (puff)--_they_  went drowsy, too--sure sign----\"    \"Where did you get that tobacco from?\" demanded Sanders quickly.    Cuthbert took time to consider his answer.    \"Fellow gave it me--chief fellow, Bosambo. Native tobacco, but not  bad--he gave me a devil of a lot.\"    \"So I should say,\" said Sanders, and reaching over took the pouch and  put it in his pocket.           *     *     *     *     *    When Sanders had seen Mr. Cuthbert safe on board a homeward-bound  steamer, he took his twenty Houssas to the Ochori country to arrest  Bosambo, and expected Bosambo would fly; but the imperturbable chief  awaited his coming, and offered him the customary honours.    \"I admit I gave the white man the hemp,\" he said. \"I myself smoke it,  suffering no ill. How was I to know that it would make him sleep?\"    \"Why did you give it to him?\" demanded Sanders.    Bosambo looked the Commissioner full in the face.    \"Last moon you came, lord, asking why I gave him the Isisi country and  the rights of the little river, because these were not mine to give. Now  you come to me saying why did I give the white man native tobacco--Lord,  that was the only thing I gave him that was mine.\"            CHAPTER V.      THE SPECIAL COMMISSIONER.      The Hon. George Tackle had the good fortune to be the son of his father;  otherwise I am free to confess he had no claim to distinction. But his  father, being the proprietor of the _Courier and Echo_ (with which are  incorporated I don't know how many dead and gone stars of the Fleet  Street firmament), George had a \"pull\" which no amount of competitive  merit could hope to contend with, and when the stories of atrocities in  the district of Lukati began to leak out and questions were asked in  Parliament, George opened his expensively-bound Gazetteer, discovered  that the district of Lukati was in British territory, and instantly  demanded that he should be sent out to investigate these crimes, which  were a blot upon our boasted civilisation.    His father agreed, having altogether a false appreciation of his son's  genius, and suggested that George should go to the office and \"get all  the facts\" regarding the atrocities. George, with a good-natured smile  of amusement at the bare thought of anybody instructing him in a subject  on which he was so thoroughly conversant, promised; but the _Courier and  Echo_ office did not see him, and the librarian of the newspaper, who  had prepared a really valuable dossier of newspaper cuttings, pamphlets,  maps, and health hints for the young man's guidance,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35554"],[0,"A Voice of Warning (#10)"],[1," forward. And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into  captivity for their iniquity; because they trespassed against me,  therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of  their enemies; so fell they all by the sword. According to their  uncleanness, and according to their transgressions, have I done unto  them, and hid myself from them. Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Now  will I bring again the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the  whole house of Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name: after  that they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses whereby  they have trespassed against me, when they dwelt safely in their own  land, and none made them afraid. When I have brought them again from  the people, and gathered them out of their enemy's lands, and am  sanctified in them in the sight of many nations; then shall they know  that I am the Lord their God, which caused them to be led into  captivity among the heathen; but I have gathered them into their own  land, and have left none of them any more there. Neither will I hide  my face any more from them; for I have poured out my Spirit upon the  house of Israel, saith the Lord God.\"    In the foregoing, we discover that the heathen are to know that the  house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity, and are  gathered again by the hand of God, after having borne their shame for  all their trespasses: and the house of Israel will know that it was  the Lord their God who caused them to be led into captivity among the  heathen, and that He it was that gathered and defended them, and He  will hide His face no more from them, but will pour out His Spirit  upon them.    O ye blind, ye stiffnecked, ye hardhearted generation, with the Bible  circulated among all nations, will whole nations be so blind as to  fulfil this prophecy, and not know it until it brings destruction upon  their own heads? Why all this blindness? Alas! it is because of false  teachers, who will tell them the Bible must be spiritualized. Others  declare that these prophecies can never be understood until they are  fulfilled. If this be the case, then we can never escape the judgments  predicted in them, but must continue the children of darkness, until  they come upon us unawares and sweep us from the earth. Then, where  will be the consolation of looking back and seeing them fulfilled? But  blessed be God, He has told us by the mouth of Daniel that many shall  run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased, and that the wise  shall understand, but none of the wicked shall understand. And now, I  would ask, who are more wicked than the wilfully blind leaders of the  blind, who tell us we cannot understand the Scriptures?    Zachariah, in his fourteenth chapter, has told us much concerning the  great battle and overthrow of the nations who fight against Jerusalem;  and he has said, in plain words, that the Lord shall come at the very  time of the overthrow of that army; yes, in fact, even while they are  in the act of taking Jerusalem, and have already succeeded in taking  one half the city, and spoiling their houses, and ravishing their  women. Then, behold their long expected Messiah, suddenly appearing,  shall stand upon the Mount of Olives, a little east of Jerusalem, to  fight against those nations and deliver the Jews. Zachariah says, The  Mount of Olives shall cleave in twain, from east to west, and one half  of the mountain shall remove to the north, while the other half falls  off to the south, suddenly forming a very great valley, into which the  Jews shall flee for protection from their enemies, as they fled from  the earthquake in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah; while the Lord  cometh and all the saints with him. Then will the Jews behold that  long, long expected Messiah, coming in power to their deliverance, as  they always looked for Him. He will destroy their enemies, and deliver  them from trouble at the very time they are in the utmost  consternation, and about to be swallowed up by their enemies.    But what will be their astonishment, when they are about to fall at  the feet of their Deliverer, and acknowledge him their Messiah! They  discover the wounds which were once made in his hands, feet, and side;  and, on inquiry, at once recognize Jesus of Nazareth, the king of the  Jews, the man so long rejected. Well did the Prophet say, they should  mourn and weep, every family apart, and their wives apart. But, thank  heaven, there will be an end to their mourning; for He will forgive  their iniquities, and cleanse them from all uncleanness. Jerusalem  shall be a holy city from that time forth, and all the land shall be  turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon, and she shall be lifted up and  inhabited in her place, and men shall dwell there, and there shall be  no more utter destruction of Jerusalem; \"and in that day there shall  be one Lord, and His name one, and He shall be King over all the  earth.\"    John, in his eleventh chapter of Revelations, gives us many more  particulars concerning this same event. He informs us that, after the  city and temple are rebuilt by the Jews, the Gentiles will tread it  underfoot forty and two months, during which time there will be two  Prophets continually prophesying and working mighty miracles. And it  seems that the Gentile army shall be hindered from utterly destroying  and overthrowing the city, while these two Prophets continue. But,  after a struggle of three years and a half, they at length succeed in  destroying these two Prophets, and then overrunning much of the city;  they send gifts to each other because of the death of the two  Prophets, and in the mean time will not allow their dead bodies to be  put in graves, but suffer them to lie in the streets of Jerusalem  three days and a half; during which the armies of the Gentiles,  consisting of many kindreds, tongues, and nations, passing through the  city, plundering the Jews, see their dead bodies lying in the street.  But, after three days and a half, on a sudden, the spirit of life from  God enters them, and they will arise and stand upon their feet, and  great fear will fall upon them that see them. And then they shall hear  a voice from heaven, saying, \"Come up hither,\" and they will ascend up  to heaven in a cloud, their enemies beholding them. And, having  described all these things, then come the shaking, spoken of by  Ezekiel, and the rending of the Mount of Olives, spoken of by  Zachariah. John says: \"The same hour there was a great earthquake, and  the tenth part of the city fell; and in the earthquake were slain of  men seven thousand.\" And then one of the next scenes that follow is  the sound of voices, saying: \"The kingdoms of this world are become  the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever  and ever.\"    Now, having summed up the description of these great events spoken of  by these Prophets, I would just remark, there is no difficulty in  understanding them all to be perfectly plain and literal in their  fulfilment.    Suffice it to say, the Jews gather home, and rebuild Jerusalem. The  nations gather against them to battle. Their armies encompass the  city, and have more or less power over it for three years and a half.  A couple of Jewish Prophets, by their mighty miracles, keep them from  utterly overcoming the Jews; until at length they are slain, and the  city is left in a great measure to the mercy of their enemies for  three days and a half; the two Prophets rise from the dead and ascend  up into heaven. The Messiah comes, convulses the earth, overthrows the  army of the Gentiles, delivers the Jews, cleanses Jerusalem, cuts off  all wickedness from the earth, raises the saints from the dead, brings  them with Him, and commences His reign for a thousand years; during  which time His Spirit will be poured out upon all flesh; men and  beasts, birds and serpents, will be perfectly harmless, and peace and  the knowledge and glory of God shall cover the earth as the waters  cover the sea; and the kingdom, and the greatness of the kingdom under  the whole heaven, shall be given to the saints of the Most High.    During this thousand years, Satan will be bound, and have no power to  tempt the children of men. And the earth itself will be delivered from  the curse, which came by reason of the Fall. The rough places will  become smooth, the barren deserts fruitful; the mountains leveled; the  valleys exalted; the thorn and thistle shall no more be found, but all  the earth shall yield her increase in abundance to the saints of God.  But, after the thousand years are ended, then shall Satan be loosed,  and shall go out to deceive the nations which dwell in the four  quarters of the earth, to gather them to battle, and to bring them up  to battle against the camp of the saints. Then the great and last  struggle shall take place between God and Satan, for the empire of the  earth. Satan and his army shall be overthrown. And after these great  things, come the end of the earth, the resurrection of the wicked, and  the last judgment. And there shall be a new earth and a new heaven,  for the former earth and the former heaven shall have passed away,  that is, they will be changed from temporal to eternal, and made fit  for the abode of immortals. Then cometh Jerusalem down from God, out  of heaven, having been renewed as well as the heavens and the earth.  \"For,\" says He, \"behold, I make all things new.\"    This new city, placed upon the new earth, with the Lord God and the  Lamb in the midst, seems to be man's eternal abode, insomuch that,  after all our longings for a place beyond the bounds of time and  space, as saith the poet, we are at last brought to our proper senses,  and given to understand that man is destined forever to inherit this  selfsame planet, upon which he was first created, which shall be  redeemed, sanctified, renewed, purified, and prepared as an eternal "]]]
