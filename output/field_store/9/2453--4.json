The nose  should be white, the eyes orange, and the whole colouring rich and  varied without the least _Tabbyness_, either brown or gray or an  approach to it, such being highly detrimental to its beauty.    I have received a welcome letter from Mr. Herbert Young, of James  Street, Harrogate, informing me of the existence of what is said to be  a tortoiseshell tom or he-cat somewhere in Yorkshire, and the price is  fifty guineas; but he, unfortunately, has forgotten the exact address.  He also kindly favours me with the further information of a  tortoiseshell-and-white he-cat. He describes it as \"splendid,\" and  \"extra good in colour,\" and it is at present in the vicinity of  Harrogate. And still further, Mr. Herbert Young says, \"I am breeding  from a dark colour cat and two tortoiseshell females,\" and he hopes,  by careful selection, to succeed in \"breeding the other colour out.\"  This, I deem, is by no means an unlikely thing to happen, and, by  careful management, may not take very long to accomplish; but much  depends on the ancestry, or rather the pedigree of both sides. I for  one most heartily wish Mr. Herbert Young success, and it will be most  gratifying should he arrive at the height of his expectations. Failing  the producing of the desired colour in the he-cats by the legitimate  method of tortoiseshell with tortoiseshell, I would advise the trial  of some _whole_ colours, such as solid black and white. This _may_  prove a better way than the other, as we pigeon fanciers go an  apparently roundabout way often to obtain what we want to attain in  colour, and yet there is almost a certainty in the method.    As regards the tortoiseshell cat, there is a distinct variety known to  us cat fanciers as the tortoiseshell-tabby. This must not be  confounded with the true variety, as it consists only of a variegation  in colour of the yellow, the red, and the dark tabby, and is more in  lines than patches, or patches of lines or spots. These are by no  means ugly, and a well-marked, richly-coloured specimen is really very  handsome. They may also be intermixed with white, and should be marked  the same as the true tortoiseshell; but in competition with the _real_  tortoiseshell they would stand _no chance_ whatever, and ought in my  opinion to be disqualified as being wrong class, and be put in that  for \"any other colour.\"    [Illustration: MRS. VYVYAN'S ROYAL CAT OF SIAM.]      [Illustration: BROWN TABBY--BARS THE RIGHT WIDTH.]          THE BROWN TABBY CAT.      The tabby cat is doubtless one of, if not the most common of colours,  and numbers many almost endless varieties of both tint and markings. Of  these those with very broad bands of black, or narrow bands of black, on  nearly a black ground, are usually called black tabby, and if the bands  are divided into spots instead of being in continuous lines, then it is  a spotted black tabby; but I purpose in this paper to deal mostly with  the brown tabby--that is to say, a tabby, whose ground colour is of a  very rich, orangey, dark brown ground, without any white, and that is  evenly, proportionably, and not too broadly but elegantly marked on the  face, head, breast, sides, back, belly, legs, and tail with bands of  solid, deep, shining black. The front part of the head or face and legs,  breast, and belly should have a more rich red orange tint than the back,  but which should be nearly if not equal in depth of colour, though  somewhat browner; the markings should be graceful in curve, sharply,  well, and clearly defined, with fine deep black edges, so that the brown  and black are clear and distinct the one from the other, not blurred in  any way. The banded tabby should not be spotted in any way, excepting  those few that nearly always occur on the face and sometimes on the  fore-legs. The clearer, redder, and brighter the brown the better. The  nose should be deep red, bordered with black; the eyes an orange colour,  slightly diffused with green; in form the head should not be large, nor  too wide, being rather longer than broad, so as not to give too round or  clumsy an appearance; ears not large nor small, but of moderate size,  and of good form; legs medium length, rather long than short, so as not  to lose grace of action; body long, narrow, and deep towards the fore  part. Tail long, and gradually tapering towards the point; feet round,  with black claws, and black pads; yellowish-white around the black lips  and brown whiskers are allowable, but orange-tinted are far preferable,  and pure white should disqualify. A cat of this description is now  somewhat rare. What are generally shown as _brown_ tabbies are not  sufficiently _orange-brown_, but mostly of a dark, brownish-gray. This  is simply the ordinary tabby, and not the _brown_ tabby proper.    [Illustration: BROWN TABBY--MARKINGS MUCH TOO WIDE.]    As I stated in my notes on the Tortoiseshell cat, the best parents to  obtain a good brown tabby from is to have a strongly marked, not too  broad-banded tabby he-cat and a tortoiseshell she-cat with little black,  or red tabby she-cat, the produce being, when tabby, generally of a rich  brown, or sometimes what is termed black tabby, and also red tabby. The  picture illustrating these notes is from one so bred, and is a  particularly handsome specimen. There were two he-cats in the litter,  one the dark-brown tabby just mentioned, which I named Aaron, and the  other, a very fine red tabby, Moses. This last was even a finer animal  than Aaron, being very beautiful in colour and very large in size; but  he, alas! like many others, was caught in wires set by poachers, and was  found dead. His handsome brother still survives, though no longer my  property. The banded red tabby should be marked precisely the same as  the brown tabby, only the bands should be of deep red on an orange  ground, the deeper in colour the better; almost a chocolate on orange is  very fine. The nose deep pink, as also the pads of the feet. The  ordinary dark tabby the same way as the brown, and so also the blue or  silver, only the ground colour should be of a pale, soft, _blue_  colour--not the slightest tint of brown in it. The clearer, the  _lighter_, and brighter the blue the better, bearing in mind always that  the bands should be of a _jet black_, sharply and _very clearly  defined_.    [Illustration: WELL-MARKED PRIZE SILVER TABBY.]    The word tabby was derived from a kind of taffeta, or ribbed silk, which  when calendered or what is now termed \"watered,\" is by that process  covered with wavy lines. This stuff, in bygone times, was often called  \"tabby:\" hence the cat with lines or markings on its fur was called a  \"tabby\" cat. But it might also, one would suppose, with as much justice,  be called a taffety cat, unless the calendering of \"taffety\" caused it  to become \"tabby.\" Certain it is that the word tabby only referred to  the marking or stripes, not to the absolute colour, for in \"Wit and  Drollery\" (1682), p. 343, is the following:--        \"Her petticoat of satin,      Her gown of crimson tabby.\"    Be that as it may, I think there is little doubt that the foregoing was  the origin of the term. Yet it was also called the brinded cat, or the  brindled cat, also tiger cat, with some the gray cat, graymalkin; but I  was rather unprepared to learn that in Norfolk and Suffolk it is called  a Cyprus cat. \"Why Cyprus cat?\" quoth I. \"I do not know,\" said my  informant. \"All I know is, that such is the case.\"    So I referred to my Bailey's Dictionary of 1730, and there, \"sure  enough,\" was the elucidation; for I found that Cyprus was a kind of  cloth made of silk and hair, showing wavy lines on it, and coming from  Cyprus; therefore this somewhat strengthens the argument in favour of  \"taffeta,\" or \"tabby,\" but it is still curious that the Norfolk and  Suffolk people should have adopted a kind of cloth as that representing  the markings and colour of the cat, and that of a different name from  that in use for the cat--one or more counties calling it a \"tabby cat,\"  as regards colour, and the other naming the same as \"Cyprus.\" I take  this to be exceedingly interesting. How or when such naming took place  I am at present unable to get the least clue, though I think from what I  gather from one of the Crystal Palace Cat Show catalogues, that it must  have been after 1597, as the excerpt shows that at that time the shape  and colour was like a leopard's, which, of course, is spotted, and is  always called the spotted leopard. (Since this I have learned that the  domestic cat is said to have been brought from Cyprus by merchants, as  also was the tortoiseshell. Cyprus is a colour, a sort of  reddish-yellow, something like citron; so a Cyprus cat may mean a red or  yellow tabby.)    However, I find Holloway, in his \"Dictionary of Provincialisms\" (1839),  gives the following:--    \"Calimanco Cat, s. (_calimanco_, a _glossy stuff_), a tortoiseshell cat,  Norfolk.\"    Salmon, in \"The Compleat English Physician,\" 1693, p. 326, writing of  the cat, says: \"It is a neat and cleanly creature, often licking itself  to keep it fair and clean, and washing its face with its fore feet; the  best are such as of a fair and large kind and of an exquisite tabby  color called _Cyprus_ cats.\"    [Illustration:]    [Illustration: SPOTTED TABBY CAT.]    I have thought it best to give two illustrations of the peculiar  markings of the _spotted_ tabby, or leopard cat of some, as showing its  distinctness from the ordinary and banded Tabby, one of my reasons  being that I have, when judging at cat shows, often found excellent  specimens of both entered in the \"wrong class,\" thereby losing all  chance of a prize, though, if rightly entered, either might very  possibly have taken honours. I therefore wish to direct particular  attention to the _spotted_"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35470"],[0,"Key to the Science of Theology (#10)"],[1,"intelligences some were more noble, that is to say, more  intelligent than others.    _And God said, these will I make rulers in my kingdoms_.[A] Upon this  principle was manifested the election, before the foundation of the  world, of certain individuals to certain offices, as written in the  Scriptures.    [Footnote A: See Book of Abraham, translated from Papyrus, lately  taken from the Catacombs of Thebes in Egypt.]    In other words, certain individuals, more intelligent than the others,  were chosen by the Head, to teach, instruct, edify, improve, govern,  and minister truth and salvation to others; and to hold the delegated  powers or keys of government, in the several spheres of progressive  being.    These were not only chosen, but set apart, by a holy ordinance in the  eternal worlds, as Embassadors, Foreign Ministers, Priests, Kings,  Apostles, &c., to fill the various stations in the vast empire of the  Sovereign of all.    Jesus Christ, being the first Apostle thus commissioned, and the  President of all the powers thus delegated, is Lord of lords, and King  of kings, in the heavens and on the earth. Hence this Priesthood is  called the Priesthood after the order of the Son of God. It holds the  keys of all the true principles of government in all worlds, being  without beginning of days or end of life. It was held by Adam, Seth,  Enoch, Noah, Shem, Melchisedec, and others. Abraham obtained this  Priesthood, and an election of the same in his seed after him to all  generations. The decree went forth in an everlasting covenant, that in  Abraham and his seed, all the nations and kindreds of the earth should  be blessed.    Of this lineage according to the flesh were the Prophets, John the  Baptist, Jesus Christ, and the Jewish Apostles. Since the covenant and  election thus manifested, the keys of revelation, government and  miraculous powers on earth have been held exclusively by the literal  descendants of this noble and royal house.    The Gentiles could partake of a portion of the same blessings, but  this could only be done through their ministry, and by adoption into  the same family.    This election or covenant with the house of Israel will continue for  ever. In the great restoration of all things, this lineage will hold  the keys of Priesthood, salvation and government, for all nations. As  saith the Prophet Isaiah--\"_The nation and kingdom that will not serve  thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted_.\"    And again--\"_Ye shall be the priests of the Lord; men shall call you  the ministers of our God: but strangers shall build your walls, and  the sons of the alien shall be your ploughmen and your vine  dressers_.\"    This Priesthood, including that of the Aaronic, holds the keys of  revelation of the oracles of God to man upon the earth; the power and  right to give laws and commandments to individuals, churches, rulers,  nations and the world; to appoint, ordain, and establish constitutions  and kingdoms; to appoint kings, presidents, governors or judges, and  to ordain or anoint them to their several holy callings, also to  instruct, warn, or reprove them by the word of the Lord.    It also holds the keys of the administration of ordinances for the  remission of sins, and for the gift of the Holy Spirit; to heal the  sick, cast out demons, or work miracles in the name of the Lord; in  fine, to bind or loose on earth and in heaven. For the exercise of all  which powers the student of Theology will find abundant precedents in  the sacred Scriptures.    Man holding the keys of the Priesthood and Apostleship after the order  of the Son of God, are his representatives, or embassadors, to  mankind. To receive them, to obey their instructions, to feed, clothe,  or aid them, is counted the same, in the final judgment, as if all had  been done to the Son of God in person. On the other hand, to reject  them, or their testimony or message, or the word of God through them,  in any matter, is counted the same as if done to Jesus Christ, in his  own person. Indeed, such embassadors will be the final judges of the  persons, rulers, cities or nations to whom they are sent.    Although the chosen instruments to hold the keys of this Priesthood  must be the literal lineage of Israel, yet that lineage are not all  thus commissioned, nor indeed are any of them Priests merely because  they are of the chosen seed. Such an instrument must be revealed, and  his ordination which he had before the world began, be renewed and  confirmed upon his fleshly tabernacle, or he cannot be a Priest on  earth.    One who already holds the authority, or keys of Priesthood, can  reveal, by the word of the Lord, and ordain and anoint others to  similar callings, and through these ordinances fill them with the Holy  Spirit, as a qualification for their holy calling. By this means  Joshua succeeded Moses, Elisha succeeded Elijah, &c. And by this means  the great Apostle of the Father chose and ordained the Twelve Apostles  of the Jews, and gave the keys or presidency of the kingdom to Peter.    There have, however, been times when, by a general martyrdom or  apostacy, the keys of this power have been taken from the earth, (see  chapters 2, 3, 4.) In such case there would be no longer visions,  revelations or miraculous gifts from the Lord, manifested among men,  because the Priesthood is the channel, and the ordinances are the  means, through which such blessings are enjoyed by man. In the absence  of these offices and powers, darkness, ignorance, superstition,  priestcraft and kingcraft, idolatry, and every species of abuse, would  fill the earth, and usurp the place of the true government of the  kingdom of God.    The most remarkable and long continued instance of this kind, which  perhaps ever transpired in our world, commenced with the destruction  of the Apostles and Saints who immediately succeeded the Lord Jesus  Christ, and continued until the present century, producing in its  consequences all the human butcheries, wars, oppressions, misrule,  ignorance, superstitions, kingcraft, priestcraft, and misery, which  have visited the world in the false name of Christianity.    On the Western Hemisphere, the Apostleship, oracles, miracles, and  gifts of the Spirit, ceased from among the people in the fourth  century.    The precise time of the discontinuance of these powers on the eastern  continents, or in the Roman world, is not known. Suffice it to say,  the last of the Twelve Apostles predicted, in his vision on the Isle  of Patmos, the reign of a certain power which should make war with the  Saints, overcome them, be drunken with their blood, and hear rule over  all nations. \"And by thy sorceries,\" said he, \"were all nations  deceived.\" If these predictions have had their fulfilment, then it is  the height of inconsistency for any one to contend, that Rome or any  nation has perpetuated the Priesthood, Apostleship, or Church. This  would be the same as to say, the Saints were destroyed, and yet  perpetuated; all nations were deceived, and yet had the truth.    Could a universal or catholic power at once destroy the Saints, and  perpetuate them? Could the same power, at the same time, be the  conservator and promulgator of a system of universal salvation, and of  universal deception?    But leaving the prediction, and the reasoning on this subject, what  are the facts which present themselves for our own inspection, clearly  visible to all men?    Do we not find the world, for many ages, and up to the present time,  destitute of those manifestations, visions, powers, and keys of  knowledge and government, which would enlighten, purify and exalt the  race, and establish permanent righteousness and peace? In short, have  the powers of the eternal Priesthood, as described and exemplified in  the Holy Scriptures, and in this work, been manifested for the  government of the Catholic, or Protestant world, or any nation  thereof, since the destruction of the ancient Saints and Apostles?    If we answer this last question in the negative, then, we verify the  truth of the prediction by the last of the Twelve; if in the  affirmative, we deny both the truth of the prediction, and the facts  which clearly present themselves in the past history and present  circumstances of the world called \"_Christian_.\"    When there is no longer a commissioned Priesthood perpetuated on the  earth, it becomes necessary, in order to restore the government of  God, for the man or men last holding the keys of such power, to return  to the earth as ministering angels, and to select, by the word of the  Lord, and ordain, certain individuals of the royal lineage of Israel,  to hold the keys of such Priesthood, and to ordain others, and thus  restore and re-organize the government of God, or His kingdom upon the  earth.    After the destruction of the Apostles and Saints, who succeeded Jesus  Christ, there is but one dispensation or restoration predicted by the  Prophets.    That dispensation will fulfil the times of the Gentiles, complete  their fulness, restore the kingdom to Israel, gather home their twelve  tribes, organize them into a theocratic government, that is, a  government founded and guided by Prophets, Priesthood, visions and  revelations. It will, in fact, not only restore to them the  ministration of angels, but receive its final consummation, by the  resurrection of the ancient Saints, and their return to the earth,  accompanied by the Son of God, in his own proper person. To this  dispensation, all nations must submit.    All merely human religious or political institutions, all republics,  states, kingdoms, empires, must be dissolved, the dross of ignorance  and falsehood be separated, and the golden principles of unalloyed  truth be preserved, and blended for ever in the one consolidated,  universal, eternal government of the Saints of the Most High, and all  nations shall serve and obey Him."]]]
