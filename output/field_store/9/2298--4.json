The king at once sent M. Julien in answer to the petition.  Thus it was no longer simple governors of towns nor even chiefs of  provinces who were engaged in the struggle; royalty itself had come to  the rescue.    M de Julien, born a Protestant, was a, member of the nobility of Orange,  and in his youth had served against France and borne arms in England and  Ireland when William of Orange succeeded James II as King of England,  Julien was one of his pages, and received as a reward for his fidelity  in the famous campaign of 1688 the command of a regiment which was sent  to the aid of the Duke of Savoy, who had begged both England and Holland  to help him. He bore himself so gallantly that it was in great part due  to him that the French were forced to raise the siege of Cony.    Whether it was that he expected too much from this success, or that the  Duke of Savoy did not recognise his services at their worth, he withdrew  to Geneva, where Louis XIV hearing of his discontent, caused overtures  to be made to him with a view to drawing him into the French service. He  was offered the same rank in the French army as he had held in the  English, with a pension of 3000 livres.    M de Julien accepted, and feeling that his religious belief would be in  the way of his advancement, when he changed his master he changed his  Church. He was given the command of the valley of Barcelonnette, whence  he made many excursions against the Barbets; then he was transferred to  the command of the Avennes, of the principality of Orange, in order to  guard the passes, so that the French Protestants could not pass over the  frontier for the purpose of worshipping with their Dutch Protestant  brethren; and after having tried this for a year, he went to Versailles  to report himself to the king. While he was there, it chanced that the  envoy from Gevaudan arrived, and the king being satisfied with de  Julien's conduct since he had entered his service, made him  major-general, chevalier of the military order of St. Louis; and  commander-in-chief in the Vivarais and the Cevennes.    M de Julien from the first felt that the situation was very grave, and  saw that his predecessors had felt such great contempt for the heretics  that they had not realised the danger of the revolt. He immediately  proceeded to inspect in person the different points where M. de Broglie  had placed detachments of the Tournon and Marsily regiments. It is true  that he arrived by the light of thirty burning village churches.    M de Broglie, M. de Baville, M. de Julien, and Captain Poul met together  to consult as to the best means of putting an end to these disorders. It  was agreed that the royal troops should be divided into two bodies, one  under the command of M. de Julien to advance on Alais, where it was  reported large meetings of the rebels were taking place, and the other  under M. de Brogue, to march about in the neighbourhood of Nimes.    Consequently, the two chiefs separated. M. le Comte de Broglie at the  head of sixty-two dragoons and some companies of foot, and having under  him Captain Poul and M. de Dourville, set out from Cavayrac on the 12th  of January at 2 a. m., and having searched without finding anything the  vineyards of Nimes and La Garrigue de Milhau, took the road to the  bridge of Lunel. There he was informed that those he was in search of  had been seen at the chateau of Caudiac the day before; he therefore at  once set out for the forest which lies around it, not doubting to find  the fanatics entrenched there; but, contrary to his expectations, it was  vacant. He then pushed on to Vauvert, from Vauvert to Beauvoisin, from  Beauvoisin to Generac, where he learned that a troop of rebels had  passed the night there, and in the morning had left for Aubore. Resolved  to give them no rest, M. de Broglie set out at once for this village.    When half-way there, a member of his staff thought he could distinguish  a crowd of men near a house about half a league distant; M. de Broglie  instantly ordered Sieur de Gibertin, Captain Paul's lieutenant, who was  riding close by, at the head of his company, to take eight dragoons and  make a reconnaissance, in order to ascertain who these men were, while  the rest of the troops would make a halt.    This little band, led by its officer, crossed a clearing in the wood,  and advanced towards the farmhouse, which was called the Mas de Gafarel,  and which now seemed deserted. But when they were within half a gun-shot  of the wall the charge was sounded behind it, and a band of rebels  rushed towards them, while from a neighbouring house a second troop  emerged, and looking round, he perceived a third lying on their faces in  a small wood. These latter suddenly stood up and approached him, singing  psalms. As it was impossible for M. de Gibertin to hold his ground  against so large a force, he ordered two shots to be fired as a warning  to de Brogue to advance to meet him, and fell back on his comrades.  Indeed, the rebels had only pursued him till they had reached a  favourable position, on which they took their stand.    M de Brogue having surveyed the whole position with the aid of a  telescope, held a council of war, and it was decided that an attack  should be made forthwith. They therefore advanced on the rebels in line:  Captain Poul on the right, M. de Dourville on the left, and Count  Broglie in the centre.    As they got near they could see that the rebels had chosen their ground  with an amount of strategical sagacity they had never till then  displayed. This skill in making their dispositions was evidently due to  their having found a new leader whom no one knew, not even Captain Poul,  although they could see him at the head of his men, carbine in hand.    However, these scientific preparations did not stop M. de Brogue: he  gave the order to charge, and adding example to precept, urged his horse  to a gallop. The rebels in the first rank knelt on one knee, so that the  rank behind could take aim, and the distance between the two bodies of  troops disappeared rapidly, thanks to the impetuosity of the dragoons;  but suddenly, when within thirty paces of the enemy, the royals found  themselves on the edge of a deep ravine which separated them from the  enemy like a moat. Some were able to check their horses in time, but  others, despite desperate efforts, pressed upon by those behind, were  pushed into the ravine, and rolled helplessly to the bottom. At the same  moment the order to fire was given in a sonorous voice, there was a  rattle of musketry, and several dragoons near M. de Broglie fell.    \"Forward!\" cried Captain Poul, \"forward!\" and putting his horse at a  part of the ravine where the sides were less steep, he was soon  struggling up the opposite side, followed by a few dragoons.    \"Death to the son of Belial!\" cried the same voice which had given the  order to fire. At that moment a single shot rang out, Captain Poul threw  up his hands, letting his sabre go, and fell from his horse, which  instead of running away, touched his master with its smoking nostrils,  then lifting its head, neighed long and low. The dragoons retreated.    \"So perish all the persecutors of Israel!\" cried the leader, brandishing  his carbine. He then dashed down into the ravine, picked up Captain  Poul's sabre and jumped upon his horse. The animal, faithful to its old  master, showed some signs of resistance, but soon felt by the pressure  of its rider's knees that it had to do with one whom it could not  readily unseat. Nevertheless, it reared and bounded, but the horseman  kept his seat, and as if recognising that it had met its match, the  noble animal tossed its head, neighed once more, and gave in. While this  was going on, a party of Camisards [Name given to the insurgent  Calvinists after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes.--Translator's  Note.] and one of the dragoons had got down into the ravine, which had  in consequence been turned into a battlefield; while those who remained  above on either side took advantage of their position to fire down at  their enemies. M. de Dourville, in command of the dragoons, fought among  the others like a simple soldier, and received a serious wound in the  head; his men beginning to lose ground, M. de Brogue tried to rally  them, but without avail, and while he was thus occupied his own troop  ran away; so seeing there was no prospect of winning the battle, he and  a few valiant men who had remained near him dashed forward to extricate  M. Dourville, who, taking advantage of the opening thus made, retreated,  his wound bleeding profusely. On the other hand, the Camisards  perceiving at some distance bodies of infantry coming up to reinforce  the royals, instead of pursuing their foes, contented themselves with  keeping up a thick and well-directed musketry-fire from the position in  which they had won such a quick and easy victory.    As soon as the royal forces were out of reach of their weapons, the  rebel chief knelt down and chanted the song the Israelites sang when,  having crossed the Red Sea in safety, they saw the army of Pharaoh  swallowed up in the waters, so that although no longer within reach of  bullets the defeated troops were still pursued by songs of victory.  Their thanksgivings ended, the Calvinists withdrew into the forest, led  by their new chief, who had at his first assay shown the great extent of  his knowledge, coolness, and courage.    This new chief, whose superiors were soon to become his lieutenants, was  the famous Jean Cavalier.    Jean Cavalier was then a young man of twenty-three, of less than medium  height, but of great strength. His face was oval, with regular features,  his eyes sparkling and beautiful; he had long chestnut hair falling on  his shoulders, and an expression of remarkable sweetness.

Bothwell was no longer young,  Bothwell was not handsome, and yet Mary sacrificed for him a young  husband, who was considered one of the handsomest men of his century. It  was like a kind of enchantment. Darnley, the sole obstacle to the union,  had been already condemned for a long time, if not by Mary, at least by  Bothwell; then, as his strong constitution had conquered the poison,  another kind of death was sought for.    The queen, as she announces in her letter to Bothwell, had refused to  bring back Darnley with her, and had returned alone to Edinburgh.  Arrived there, she gave orders for the king to be moved, in his turn, in  a litter; but instead of taking him to Stirling or Holyrood, she decided  to lodge him in the abbey of the Kirk of Field. The king made some  objections when he knew of this arrangement; however, as he had no power  to oppose it, he contented himself with complaining of the solitude of  the dwelling assigned him; but the queen made answer that she could not  receive him at that moment, either at Holyrood or at Stirling, for fear,  if his illness were infectious, lest he might give it to his son:  Darnley was then obliged to make the best of the abode allotted him.    It was an isolated abbey, and little calculated by its position to  dissipate the fears that the king entertained; for it was situated  between two ruined churches and two cemeteries: the only house, which  was distant about a shot from a cross-bow, belonged to the Hamiltons,  and as they were Darnley's mortal enemies the neighbourhood was none the  more reassuring: further, towards the north, rose some wretched huts,  called the \"Thieves' cross-roads\". In going round his new residence,  Darnley noticed that three holes, each large enough for a man to get  through, had been made in the walls; he asked that these holes, through  which ill-meaning persons could get in, should be stopped up: it was  promised that masons should be sent; but nothing was done, and the holes  remained open.    The day after his arrival at Kirk of Field, the king saw a light in that  house near his which he believed deserted; next day he asked Alexander  Durham whence it came, and he heard that the Archbishop of St. Andrew's  had left his palace in Edinburgh and had housed there since the  preceding evening, one didn't know why: this news still further  increased the king's uneasiness; the Archbishop of St. Andrew's was one  of his most declared enemies.    The king, little by little abandoned by all his servants lived on the  first floor of an isolated pavilion, having about him only this same  Alexander Durham, whom we have mentioned already, and who was his valet.  Darnley, who had quite a special friendship for him, and who besides, as  we have said, feared some attack on his life at every moment, had made  him move his bed into his own apartment, so that both were sleeping in  the same room.    On the night of the 8th February, Darnley awoke Durham: he thought he  heard footsteps in the apartment beneath him. Durham rose, took a sword  in one hand, a taper in the other, and went down to the ground floor;  but although Darnley was quite certain he had not been deceived, Durham  came up again a moment after, saying he had seen no one.    The morning of the next day passed without bringing anything fresh. The  queen was marrying one of her servants named Sebastian: he was an  Auvergnat whom she had brought with her from France, and whom she liked  very much. However, as the king sent word that he had not seen her for  two days, she left the wedding towards six o'clock in the evening, and  came to pay him a visit, accompanied by the Countess of Argyll and the  Countess of Huntly. While she was there, Durham, in preparing his bed,  set fire to his palliasse, which was burned as well as a part of the  mattress; so that, having thrown them out of the window all in flames,  for fear lest the fire should reach the rest of the furniture, he found  himself without a bed, and asked permission to return to the town to  sleep; but Darnley, who remembered his terror the night before, and who  was surprised at the promptness that had made Durham throw all his  bedding out of the window, begged him not to go away, offering him one  of his mattresses, or even to take him into his own bed. However, in  spite of this offer, Durham insisted, saying that he felt unwell, and  that he should like to see a doctor the same evening. So the queen  interceded for Durham, and promised Darnley to send him another valet to  spend the night with him: Darnley was then obliged to yield, and, making  Mary repeat that she would send him someone, he gave Durham leave for  that evening. At that moment Paris; of whom the queen speaks in her  letters, came in: he was a young Frenchman who had been in Scotland for  some years, and who, after having served with Bothwell and Seyton, was  at present with the queen. Seeing him, she got up, and as Darnley still  wished to keep her--    \"Indeed, my lord, it is impossible,\" said she, \"to come and see you. I  have left this poor Sebastian's wedding, and I must return to it; for I  promised to came masked to his ball.\"    The king dared not insist; he only reminded her of the promise that she  had made to send him a servant: Mary renewed it yet once again, and went  away with her attendants. As for Durham, he had set out the moment he  received permission.    It was nine o'clock in the evening. Darnley, left alone, carefully shut  the doors within, and retired to rest, though in readiness to rise to  let in the servant who should come to spend the night with him. Scarcely  was he in bed than the same noise that he had heard the night before  recommenced; this time Darnley listened with all the attention fear  gives, and soon he had no longer any doubt but that several men were  walking about beneath him. It was useless to call, it was dangerous to  go out; to wait was the only course that remained to the king. He made  sure again that the doors were well fastened, put his sword under his  pillow, extinguished his lamp for fear the light might betray him, and  awaited in silence for his servant's arrival; but the hours passed away,  and the servant did not come. At one o'clock in the morning, Bothwell,  after having talked some while with the queen, in the presence of the  captain of the guard, returned home to change his dress; after some  minutes, he came out wrapped up in the large cloak of a German hussar,  went through the guard-house, and had the castle gate opened. Once  outside, he took his way with all speed to Kirk of Field, which he  entered by the opening in the wall: scarcely had he made a step in the  garden than he met James Balfour, governor of the castle.    \"Well,\" he said to him, \"how far have we got?    \"Everything is ready,\" replied Balfour, \"and we were waiting for you to  set fire to the fuse\". \"That is well,\" Bothwell answered--\"but first I  want to make sure that he is in his room.\"    At these words, Bothwell opened the pavilion door with a false key, and,  having groped his way up the stairs; he went to listen at Darnley's  door. Darnley, hearing no further noise, had ended by going to sleep;  but he slept with a jerky breathing which pointed to his agitation.  Little mattered it to Bothwell what kind of sleep it was, provided that  he was really in his room. He went down again in silence, then, as he  had come up, and taking a lantern from one of the conspirators, he went  himself into the lower room to see if everything was in order: this room  was full of barrels of powder, and a fuse ready prepared wanted but a  spark to set the whole on fire. Bothwell withdrew, then, to the end of  the garden with Balfour, David, Chambers, and three or four others,  leaving one man to ignite the fuse. In a moment this man rejoined them.    There ensued some minutes of anxiety, during which the five men looked  at one another in silence and as if afraid of themselves; then, seeing  that nothing exploded, Bothwell impatiently turned round to the  engineer, reproaching him for having, no doubt through fear, done his  work badly. He assured his master that he was certain everything was all  right, and as Bothwell, impatient, wanted to return to the house  himself, to make sure, he offered to go back and see how things stood.  In fact, he went back to the pavilion, and, putting his head through a  kind of air-hole, he saw the fuse, which was still burning. Some seconds  afterwards, Bothwell saw him come running back, making a sign that all  was going well; at the same moment a frightful report was heard, the  pavilion was blown to pieces, the town and the firth were lit up with a  clearness exceeding the brightest daylight; then everything fell back  into night, and the silence was broken only by the fall of stones and  joists, which came down as fast as hail in a hurricane.    Next day the body of the king was found in a garden in the  neighbourhood: it had been saved from the action of the fire by the  mattresses on which he was lying, and as, doubtless, in his terror he  had merely thrown himself on his bed wrapped in his dressing-gown and in  his slippers, and as he was found thus, without his slippers, which were  flung some paces away, it was believed that he had been first strangled,  then carried there; but the most probable version was that the murderers  simply relied upon powder--an auxiliary sufficiently powerful in itself  for them to have no fear it would fail them.    Was the queen an accomplice or not? No one has ever known save herself,  Bothwell, and God; but, yes or no, her conduct, imprudent this time as  always, gave the charge her enemies brought against her, if not  substance, at least an appearance of truth. Scarcely had she heard the  news than she gave"]]]
