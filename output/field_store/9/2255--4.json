Newton had to master the multiplication table,  then the four rules of arithmetic, then the rudiments of algebra, before  he came to the binomial theorem. At each point, there was attention,  concentration, insight; until these were attained, no progress to the  next point was possible. So with Darwin. He had to learn the form and  use of leaf and flower, of bone and muscle; the characteristics of  genera and species; the distribution of plants and animals, before he  had in mind that nexus of knowledge on which the light of his great  idea was at last able to shine. So is it with all knowledge. So is it  with spiritual knowledge. Take the matter this way: The first subject  for the exercise of my spiritual insight is my day, with its  circumstances, its hindrances, its opportunities, its duties. I do what  I can to solve it, to fulfil its duties, to learn its lessons. I try to  live my day with aspiration and faith. That is the first step. By doing  this, I gather a harvest for the evening, I gain a deeper insight into  life, in virtue of which I begin the next day with a certain advantage,  a certain spiritual advance and attainment. So with all successive  days. In faith and aspiration, we pass from day to day, in growing  knowledge and power, with never more than one day to solve at a time,  until all life becomes radiant and transparent.    7. This threefold power, of Attention, Meditation, Contemplation, is  more interior than the means of growth previously described.    Very naturally so; because the means of growth previously described  were concerned with the extrication of the spiritual man from psychic  bondages and veils; while this threefold power is to be exercised by  the spiritual man thus extricated and standing on his feet, viewing life  with open eyes.    8. But this triad is still exterior to the soul vision which is  unconditioned, free from the seed of mental analyses.    The reason is this: The threefold power we have been considering, the  triad of Attention, Contemplation, Meditation is, so far as we have yet  considered it, the focussing of the beam of perceiving consciousness  upon some form of manifesting being, with a view of understanding  it completely. There is a higher stage, where the beam of  consciousness is turned back upon itself, and the individual  consciousness enters into, and knows, the All consciousness. This is  a being, a being in immortality, rather than a knowing; it is free from  mental analysis or mental forms. It is not an activity of the higher  mind, even the mind of the spiritual man. It is an activity of the soul.  Had Newton risen to this higher stage, he would have known, not the  laws of motion, but that high Being, from whose Life comes eternal  motion. Had Darwin risen to this, he would have seen the Soul, whose  graduated thought and being all evolution expresses. There are,  therefore, these two perceptions: that of living things, and that of the  Life; that of the Soul's works, and that of the Soul itself.    9. One of the ascending degrees is the development of Control. First  there is the overcoming of the mind-impress of excitation. Then comes  the manifestation of the mind-impress of Control. Then the perceiving  consciousness follows after the moment of Control.    This is the development of Control. The meaning seems to be this:  Some object enters the field of observation, and at first violently  excites the mind, stirring up curiosity, fear, wonder; then the  consciousness returns upon itself, as it were, and takes the perception  firmly in hand, steadying itself, and viewing the matter calmly from  above. This steadying effort of the will upon the perceiving  consciousness is Control, and immediately upon it follows perception,  understanding, insight.     Take a trite example. Supposing one is walking in an Indian forest. A  charging elephant suddenly appears. The man is excited by  astonishment, and, perhaps, terror. But he exercises an effort of will,  perceives the situation in its true bearings, and recognizes that a  certain thing must be done; in this case, probably, that he must get out  of the way as quickly as possible.    Or a comet, unheralded, appears in the sky like a flaming sword. The  beholder is at first astonished, perhaps terror-stricken; but he takes  himself in hand, controls his thoughts, views the apparition calmly,  and finally calculates its orbit and its relation to meteor showers.    These are extreme illustrations; but with all knowledge the order of  perception is the same: first, the excitation of the mind by the new  object impressed on it; then the control of the mind from within; upon  which follows the perception of the nature of the object. Where the  eyes of the spiritual man are open, this will be a true and penetrating  spiritual perception. In some such way do our living experiences come  to us; first, with a shock of pain; then the Soul steadies itself and  controls the pain; then the spirit perceives the lesson of the event, and  its bearing upon the progressive revelation of life.    10. Through frequent repetition of this process, the mind becomes  habituated to it, and there arises an equable flow of perceiving  consciousness.    Control of the mind by the Soul, like control of the muscles by the  mind, comes by practice, and constant voluntary repetition.    As an example of control of the muscles by the mind, take the  ceaseless practice by which a musician gains mastery over his  instrument, or a fencer gains skill with a rapier. Innumerable small  efforts of attention will make a result which seems well-nigh  miraculous; which, for the novice, is really miraculous. Then consider  that far more wonderful instrument, the perceiving mind, played on by  that fine musician, the Soul. Here again, innumerable small efforts of  attention will accumulate into mastery, and a mastery worth winning.  For a concrete example, take the gradual conquest of each day, the  effort to live that day for the Soul. To him that is faithful unto death,  the Master gives the crown of life.    11. The gradual conquest of the mind's tendency to flit from one  object to another, and the power of one-pointedness, make the  development of Contemplation.    As an illustration of the mind's tendency to flit from one object to  another, take a small boy, learning arithmetic. He begins: two ones are  two; three ones are three-and then he thinks of three coins in his  pocket, which will purchase so much candy, in the store down the  street, next to the toy-shop, where are base-balls, marbles and so  on,--and then he comes back with a jerk, to four ones are four. So with  us also. We are seeking the meaning of our task, but the mind takes  advantage of a moment of slackened attention, and flits off from one  frivolous detail to another, till we suddenly come back to  consciousness after traversing leagues of space. We must learn to  conquer this, and to go back within ourselves into the beam of  perceiving consciousness itself, which is a beam of the Oversoul. This  is the true onepointedness, the bringing of our consciousness to a  focus in the Soul.     12. When, following this, the controlled manifold tendency and the  aroused one-pointedness are equally balanced parts of the perceiving  consciousness, his the development of one-pointedness.    This would seem to mean that the insight which is called  one-pointedness has two sides, equally balanced. There is, first, the  manifold aspect of any object, the sum of all its characteristics and  properties. This is to be held firmly in the mind. Then there is the  perception of the object as a unity, as a whole, the perception of its  essence. First, the details must be clearly perceived; then the essence  must be comprehended. When the two processes are equally balanced,  the true onepointedness is attained. Everything has these two sides,  the side of difference and the side of unity; there is the individual and  there is the genus; the pole of matter and diversity, and the pole of  oneness and spirit. To see the object truly, we must see both.    13. Through this, the inherent character, distinctive marks and  conditions of being and powers, according to their development, are  made clear.    By the power defined in the preceding sutra, the inherent character,  distinctive marks and conditions of beings and powers are made clear.  For through this power, as defined, we get a twofold view of each  object, seeing at once all its individual characteristics and its essential  character, species and genus; we see it in relation to itself, and in  relation to the Eternal. Thus we see a rose as that particular flower,  with its colour and scent, its peculiar fold of each petal; but we also  see in it the species, the family to which it belongs, with its relation to  all plants, to all life, to Life itself. So in any day, we see events and  circumstances; we also see in it the lesson set for the soul by the  Eternal.    14. Every object has its characteristics which are already quiescent,  those which are active, and those which are not yet definable.    Every object has characteristics belonging to its past, its present and  its future. In a fir tree, for example, there are the stumps or scars of  dead branches, which once represented its foremost growth; there are  the branches with their needles spread out to the air; there are the  buds at the end of each branch and twig, which carry the still closely  packed needles which are the promise of the future. In like manner,  the chrysalis has, as its past, the caterpillar; as its future, the  butterfly. The man has, in his past, the animal; in his future, the  angel. Both are visible even now in his face. So with all things, for  all things change and grow.    15. Difference in stage is the cause of difference in development.    This but amplifies what has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25266"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Saint Paul (#10)"],[1,"four western windows to be lancets; and there is no  explanation for the uniformity. The East End contained a great window  some thirty-seven feet in height, of seven lights and trefoiled at the  head; and above this the circular rose window, the four angles of the  square stage filled in with an arrangement of smaller circles. There  were eastern aisle windows on either side of the main window, and four  crypt lights below.    When we add that the buttresses were crowned with pinnacles to  strengthen them in their resistance to the flying-buttresses of the  clerestory and to the aisle walls beneath, and that these pinnacles  contained niches for statues and were terminated with crockets and  finials, so far as we can judge the exterior of the choir was in every  respect a fitting completion of the exterior of Old St. Paul's.    We have already said sufficient of Inigo Jones, how he flagged [_i.e._  cased] the outside of the nave and transept, says Wren, \"with new  stone of larger size than before.\"[42] Owing to this, the plates are  silent as to the window mouldings and other details. Let us pass on to  the      INTERIOR.    =The Nave= was of eleven bays (not twelve), with triforium and  clerestory, and aisles in addition. The outer coating only of the  pillars was of good stone. Wren says, \"They are only cased without,  and that with small stones, not one greater than a Man's Burden, but  within is nothing but a Core of small Rubbishstone, and much Mortar,  which easily crushes and yields to the Weight.\" Even the outer casing,  he adds, \"is much torn with age, and the Neglect of the Roof.\"[43]  Double engaged shafts reached to the clerestory, and supported the  springers. The actual arcading sprang from these shorter engaged  shafts, which had cushioned capitals; and the arcading of the  triforium was similar. The mouldings of the arches of arcading and  triforium look like the lozenge. The vaulting, too heavy for its  supports, was quadripartite, with cross springers intervening, and the  longitudinal rib unbroken. The =Transepts= were each of four bays, and  in their details similar to the nave. Their north aisles were shut off  by blank walls which displayed here and there the architecture of the  rest; and each aisle of four bays was further divided into two equal  parts of two bays each, making four compartments altogether. In one or  other of these four the Consistory Court, according to Wren, was held.  To the arcading of nave and transepts, Wren says that in later years  four new and stronger piers were added in the common centre under the  tower for the purpose of strengthening it. As these are not shown in  Dugdale's plates, we can only conjecture their date to have been after  the fire of 1445. By the plan they were far more massive than the  others, and we can well understand Wren's complaint that they broke in  upon the perspective.       [Illustration: THE NAVE OF OLD ST. PAUL'S.     _After Hollar._]    The dates of the nave and transepts have already been suggested. After  the fire of 1087, Bishop Maurice and his successor built everything  afresh on a larger scale. The fire of 1136 did great damage, and  restoration on a considerable scale was effected. Mr. E.A. Freeman, by  a happy coincidence, touches on restorations at Wells of this time,  and contrasts our two dates.[44] After the fire of 1136 the  restoration would be in a style \"somewhat less massive, somewhat more  highly enriched.\" I have already pointed out Freeman's statement that  the custom towards the middle of the eleventh century was to throw a  coating of the more refined Romanesque of the day over earlier Norman  work, and this agrees with the statements both of Wren and Pepys.    We may, then, assume that while the former ground-plan and general  outline remained the same, after 1136 the pillars were encased and  more elaborate mouldings added. By another statement of the same  authority[45] it would seem that \"the vaulting shafts run up from the  ground\" belong to the second restoration, when the vaulting itself was  completed, and the date of this is indicated in Bishop Basset's letter  of 1255.    Hence the nave and transepts were restored after the transitional  Norman style, and vaulting shafts added in the fully developed Early  English style, while the window tracery and other details of the  isolated north aisles of the transepts were Geometrical. The four  piers supporting the central tower were of a later date; but surely  there must have been others, though less massive, before, otherwise it  is difficult to understand how the tower and spire were supported.    Dugdale gives only two monuments in the nave. Thomas Kemp, who died  bishop, reposed under the penultimate arch in the north side, in a  chapel enclosed by a screen and railings. The second was that of Sir  John Beauchamp, who died in 1358, and whose monument was under the  eastern arch on the south side. Somehow the populace entertained the  idea that this latter was the burial place of Duke Humphrey of  Gloucester, uncle to Henry VI., who was murdered in 1447 and buried at  St. Alban's. The adjacent part of the south aisle was called Duke  Humphrey's Walk: and the tomb seems to have been a sanctuary. At  dinner-time, needy people who lacked both the means to purchase a meal  and friends to provide them with one, and who chanced to loiter about  this sanctuary, were said _to dine with Duke Humphrey_, and the phrase  was equivalent to having no dinner at all.       [Illustration: THE CHOIR, LOOKING EAST.     _After Hollar._]    =The Choir.=--As our ancestors looked eastward from under the central  tower, both aisles of the choir were completely hidden from view by  the height of the blank wall. The choir screen in the centre was of  less altitude, had four niches for statues on either side, and a fine  Pointed doorway in the centre of three orders of arches. The plates  are of a date too late to show any rood. Entering through this door  was the choir of twelve bays. Stephen Wren implies that the whole of  this magnificent member was completed by 1240;[46] but much of the  architecture belonged to a somewhat later date, and the prints are  corroborated by numerous documents.[47] The extension eastward on the  site of Old St. Faith's must have almost amounted to a rebuilding.  Where did this extension begin, and where did the choir of 1240 end?  Wren noticed that the intercolumnar spacing was less irregular to the  east. Mr. Longman points out that the clustered pillars towards the  west differed from the others, as did their capitals and the triforium  arcading, while the fifth arch-space was greater than all the rest.  Here we have the original east end.    Westward, the square fronts of the pillars were left bare; eastward  they were covered with clustered shafts, and the springers which  supported the vaulting were continued to the ground. Westward,  moreover, the triforium arcading differed from that to the east, and  was occasionally even left blank.    There remains, however, this peculiarity, that according to the prints  the main aisle windows were uniform throughout, and with Geometrical  tracery. The vaulting differed from the nave in this, that the  diagonals, where they met the longitudinal rib, had bosses, and three  single cross ribs alternated instead of one. The longitudinal rib was  again unbroken throughout.    That part of the Choir devoted to public worship was limited to the  first seven bays, of which the three to the east were on a higher  level. The stalls of the dignitaries extended four bays, and shut out  the aisles. On the north side the organ occupied the third bay, and on  the south the bishop's cathedral throne, as now, was at the end. The  Chapel of St. Mary, or Lady Chapel, was east of the presbytery at the  extreme end, with St. George's to the north and St. Dunstan's south;  and the whole of the space outside the presbytery--north, south,  east--was taken up by some of those monuments which contributed so  much to the beauty and interest of the interior, and they even  encroached inside. Dugdale gives some seventy to eighty. Between the  altar and the Lady Chapel was St. Erkenwald's noted and richly  decorated shrine, and the tombs of Bishop Braybroke and Dean Nowell.  Hard by in the north aisle slept John of Gaunt under his magnificent  canopy; and supporter of Wycliffe though he was, his tomb was rifled  and defiled during the Commonwealth. Near at hand was the monument of  Sebba, King of the East Saxons--a convert of Erkenwald, from whom he  received the cowl. In the disgraceful chaos after the Fire, the body  of Sebba, says Dugdale \"was found curiously enbalmed in sweet odours  and clothed in rich robes.\" Here also could be read the unflattering  epitaph over the monument of Ethelred the Unready; and hard by the  tomb of John of Gaunt, in December, 1641, the corpse of another  Fleming by birth was interred. Sir Anthony Van Dyck had spent the last  nine years of his life in England at the invitation of Charles, and  this great pupil of Rubens was probably the last buried in the choir  before the Civil War. The Lady Chapel contained a wooden tablet to Sir  Philip Sidney, with the inscription:        \"England, Netherlands, the Heavens and the Arts,      The Souldiers and the World, have made six parts      Of noble Sidney; for none will suppose      That a small heap of stones can Sidney enclose.        His body hath England, for she it bred;      Netherlands his blood, in her defence shed;      The Heavens have his soule, the Arts his fame,      All Souldiers the grief, the World his good name.\"    Another wooden tablet in the north aisle was to the memory of his  father-in-law, the statesman Walsingham; and numerous other statesmen,  nobles, divines, and lawyers were buried, or at least remembered. We  can but regret that these are now things of the past, and gone, with  the exception of the effigy of Dean Donne--as"]]]
