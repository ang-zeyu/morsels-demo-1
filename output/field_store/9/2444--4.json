My eyes  were misty with tears as I saw them, standing in line, holding the  simple banners which my daughter Sylvia had decorated, waiting for the  word of command. Of course our procession attracted a large crowd of  intensely amused spectators. The police, however, made no attempt to  disperse our ranks, but merely ordered us to furl our banners. There  was no reason why we should not have carried banners but the fact that  we were women, and therefore could be bullied. So, bannerless, the  procession entered Caxton Hall. To my amazement it was filled with  women, most of whom I had never seen at any suffrage gathering before.    Our meeting was most enthusiastic, and while Annie Kenney was speaking,  to frequent applause, the news came to me that the King's speech (which  is not the King's at all, but the formally announced Government  programme for the session) had been read, and that there was in it no  mention of the women's suffrage question. As Annie took her seat I arose  and made this announcement, and I moved a resolution that the meeting  should at once proceed to the House of Commons to urge the members to  introduce a suffrage measure. The resolution was carried, and we rushed  out in a body and hurried toward the Strangers' Entrance. It was pouring  rain and bitterly cold, yet no one turned back, even when we learned at  the entrance that for the first time in memory the doors of the House of  Commons were barred to women. We sent in our cards to members who were  personal friends, and some of them came out and urged our admittance.  The police, however, were obdurate. They had their orders. The Liberal  government, advocates of the people's rights, had given orders that  women should no longer set foot in their stronghold.    Pressure from members proved too great, and the government relented to  the extent of allowing twenty women at a time to enter the lobby.  Through all the rain and cold those hundreds of women waited for hours  their turn to enter. Some never got in, and for those of us who did  there was small satisfaction. Not a member could be persuaded to take up  our cause.    Out of the disappointment and dejection of that experience I yet reaped  a richer harvest of happiness than I had ever known before. Those women  had followed me to the House of Commons. They had defied the police.  They were awake at last. They were prepared to do something that women  had never done before--fight for themselves. Women had always fought for  men, and for their children. Now they were ready to fight for their own  human rights. Our militant movement was established.          CHAPTER IV      To account for the phenomenal growth of the Women's Social and Political  Union after it was established in London, to explain why it made such an  instant appeal to women hitherto indifferent, I shall have to point out  exactly wherein our society differs from all other suffrage  associations. In the first place, our members are absolutely single  minded; they concentrate all their forces on one object, political  equality with men. No member of the W. S. P. U. divides her attention  between suffrage and other social reforms. We hold that both reason and  justice dictate that women shall have a share in reforming the evils  that afflict society, especially those evils bearing directly on women  themselves. Therefore, we demand, before any other legislation whatever,  the elementary justice of votes for women.    There is not the slightest doubt that the women of Great Britain would  have been enfranchised years ago had all the suffragists adopted this  simple principle. They never did, and even to-day many English women  refuse to adopt it. They are party members first and suffragists  afterward; or they are suffragists part of the time and social theorists  the rest of the time. We further differ from other suffrage  associations, or from others existing in 1906, in that we clearly  perceived the political situation that solidly interposed between us and  our enfranchisement.    For seven years we had had a majority in the House of Commons pledged to  vote favourably on a suffrage bill. The year before, they had voted  favourably on one, yet that bill did not become law. Why? Because even  an overwhelming majority of private members are powerless to enact law  in the face of a hostile Government of eleven cabinet ministers. The  private member of Parliament was once possessed of individual power and  responsibility, but Parliamentary usage and a changed conception of  statesmanship have gradually lessened the functions of members. At the  present time their powers, for all practical purposes, are limited to  helping to enact such measures as the Government introduces or, in rare  instances, private measures approved by the Government. It is true that  the House can revolt, can, by voting a lack of confidence in the  Government, force them to resign. But that almost never happens, and it  is less likely now than formerly to happen. Figureheads don't revolt.    This, then, was our situation: the Government all-powerful and  consistently hostile; the rank and file of legislators impotent; the  country apathetic; the women divided in their interests. The Women's  Social and Political Union was established to meet this situation, and  to overcome it. Moreover we had a policy which, if persisted in long  enough, could not possibly fail to overcome it. Do you wonder that we  gained new members at every meeting we held?    There was little formality about joining the Union. Any woman could  become a member by paying a shilling, but at the same time she was  required to sign a declaration of loyal adherence to our policy and a  pledge not to work for any political party until the women's vote was  won. This is still our inflexible custom. Moreover, if at any time a  member, or a group of members, loses faith in our policy; if any one  begins to suggest, that some other policy ought to be substituted, or if  she tries to confuse the issue by adding other policies, she ceases at  once to be a member. Autocratic? Quite so. But, you may object, a  suffrage organisation ought to be democratic. Well the members of the  W. S. P. U. do not agree with you. We do not believe in the  effectiveness of the ordinary suffrage organisation. The W. S. P. U. is  not hampered by a complexity of rules. We have no constitution and  by-laws; nothing to be amended or tinkered with or quarrelled over at an  annual meeting. In fact, we have no annual meeting, no business  sessions, no elections of officers. The W. S. P. U. is simply a suffrage  army in the field. It is purely a volunteer army, and no one is obliged  to remain in it. Indeed we don't want anybody to remain in it who does  not ardently believe in the policy of the army.    The foundation of our policy is opposition to a Government who refuse  votes to women. To support by word or deed a Government hostile to woman  suffrage is simply to invite them to go on being hostile. We oppose the  Liberal party because it is in power. We would oppose a Unionist  government if it were in power and were opposed to woman suffrage. We  say to women that as long as they remain in the ranks of the Liberal  party they give their tacit approval to the Government's anti-suffrage  policy. We say to members of Parliament that as long as they support any  of the Government's policies they give their tacit approval to the  anti-suffrage policy. We call upon all sincere suffragists to leave the  Liberal party until women are given votes on equal terms with men. We  call upon all voters to vote against Liberal candidates until the  Liberal Government does justice to women.    We did not invent this policy. It was most successfully pursued by Mr.  Parnell in his Home Rule struggle more than thirty-five years ago. Any  one who is old enough to remember the stirring days of Parnell may  recall how, in 1885, the Home Rulers, by persistently voting against the  Government in the House of Commons, forced the resignation of Mr.  Gladstone and his Cabinet. In the general election which followed, the  Liberal party was again returned to power, but by the slender majority  of eighty-four, the Home Rulers having fought every Liberal candidate,  even those, who, like my husband, were enthusiastic believers in Home  Rule. In order to control the House and keep his leadership, Mr.  Gladstone was obliged to bring in a Government Home Rule Bill. The  downfall, through private intrigue, and the subsequent death of Parnell  prevented the bill from becoming law. For many years afterward the Irish  Nationalists had no leader strong enough to carry on Parnell's  anti-government policy, but within late years it was resumed by Mr.  James Redmond, with the result that the Commons passed a Home Rule  Bill.    The contention of the old-fashioned suffragists, and of the politicians  as well, has always been that an educated public opinion will ultimately  give votes to women without any great force being exerted in behalf of  the reform. We agree that public opinion must be educated, but we  contend that even an educated public opinion is useless unless it is  vigorously utilised. The keenest weapon is powerless unless it is  courageously wielded. In the year 1906 there was an immensely large  public opinion in favour of woman suffrage. But what good did that do  the cause? We called upon the public for a great deal more than  sympathy. We called upon it to demand of the Government to yield to  public opinion and give women votes. And we declared that we would wage  war, not only on all anti-suffrage forces, but on all neutral and  non-active forces. Every man with a vote was considered a foe to woman  suffrage unless he was prepared to be actively a friend.    Not that we believed that the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34901"],[0,"On Liberty (#10)"],[1,"own. The Vaudois were put down. The Lollards were put down. The  Hussites were put down. Even after the era of Luther, wherever  persecution was persisted in, it was successful. In Spain, Italy,  Flanders, the Austrian empire, Protestantism was rooted out; and, most  likely, would have been so in England, had Queen Mary lived, or Queen  Elizabeth died. Persecution has always succeeded, save where the  heretics were too strong a party to be effectually persecuted. No  reasonable person can doubt that Christianity might have been extirpated  in the Roman Empire. It spread, and became predominant, because the  persecutions were only occasional, lasting but a short time, and  separated by long intervals of almost undisturbed propagandism. It is a  piece of idle sentimentality that truth, merely as truth, has any  inherent power denied to error, of prevailing against the dungeon and  the stake. Men are not more zealous for truth than they often are for  error, and a sufficient application of legal or even of social penalties  will generally succeed in stopping the propagation of either. The real  advantage which truth has, consists in this, that when an opinion is  true, it may be extinguished once, twice, or many times, but in the  course of ages there will generally be found persons to rediscover it,  until some one of its reappearances falls on a time when from favourable  circumstances it escapes persecution until it has made such head as to  withstand all subsequent attempts to suppress it.    It will be said, that we do not now put to death the introducers of new  opinions: we are not like our fathers who slew the prophets, we even  build sepulchres to them. It is true we no longer put heretics to death;  and the amount of penal infliction which modern feeling would probably  tolerate, even against the most obnoxious opinions, is not sufficient to  extirpate them. But let us not flatter ourselves that we are yet free  from the stain even of legal persecution. Penalties for opinion, or at  least for its expression, still exist by law; and their enforcement is  not, even in these times, so unexampled as to make it at all incredible  that they may some day be revived in full force. In the year 1857, at  the summer assizes of the county of Cornwall, an unfortunate man,[7]  said to be of unexceptionable conduct in all relations of life, was  sentenced to twenty-one months' imprisonment, for uttering, and writing  on a gate, some offensive words concerning Christianity. Within a month  of the same time, at the Old Bailey, two persons, on two separate  occasions,[8] were rejected as jurymen, and one of them grossly insulted  by the judge and by one of the counsel, because they honestly declared  that they had no theological belief; and a third, a foreigner,[9] for  the same reason, was denied justice against a thief. This refusal of  redress took place in virtue of the legal doctrine, that no person can  be allowed to give evidence in a court of justice, who does not profess  belief in a God (any god is sufficient) and in a future state; which is  equivalent to declaring such persons to be outlaws, excluded from the  protection of the tribunals; who may not only be robbed or assaulted  with impunity, if no one but themselves, or persons of similar opinions,  be present, but any one else may be robbed or assaulted with impunity,  if the proof of the fact depends on their evidence. The assumption on  which this is grounded, is that the oath is worthless, of a person who  does not believe in a future state; a proposition which betokens much  ignorance of history in those who assent to it (since it is historically  true that a large proportion of infidels in all ages have been persons  of distinguished integrity and honour); and would be maintained by no  one who had the smallest conception how many of the persons in greatest  repute with the world, both for virtues and for attainments, are well  known, at least to their intimates, to be unbelievers. The rule,  besides, is suicidal, and cuts away its own foundation. Under pretence  that atheists must be liars, it admits the testimony of all atheists who  are willing to lie, and rejects only those who brave the obloquy of  publicly confessing a detested creed rather than affirm a falsehood. A  rule thus self-convicted of absurdity so far as regards its professed  purpose, can be kept in force only as a badge of hatred, a relic of  persecution; a persecution, too, having the peculiarity, that the  qualification for undergoing it, is the being clearly proved not to  deserve it. The rule, and the theory it implies, are hardly less  insulting to believers than to infidels. For if he who does not believe  in a future state, necessarily lies, it follows that they who do believe  are only prevented from lying, if prevented they are, by the fear of  hell. We will not do the authors and abettors of the rule the injury of  supposing, that the conception which they have formed of Christian  virtue is drawn from their own consciousness.    These, indeed, are but rags and remnants of persecution, and may be  thought to be not so much an indication of the wish to persecute, as an  example of that very frequent infirmity of English minds, which makes  them take a preposterous pleasure in the assertion of a bad principle,  when they are no longer bad enough to desire to carry it really into  practice. But unhappily there is no security in the state of the public  mind, that the suspension of worse forms of legal persecution, which has  lasted for about the space of a generation, will continue. In this age  the quiet surface of routine is as often ruffled by attempts to  resuscitate past evils, as to introduce new benefits. What is boasted of  at the present time as the revival of religion, is always, in narrow  and uncultivated minds, at least as much the revival of bigotry; and  where there is the strong permanent leaven of intolerance in the  feelings of a people, which at all times abides in the middle classes of  this country, it needs but little to provoke them into actively  persecuting those whom they have never ceased to think proper objects of  persecution.[10] For it is this--it is the opinions men entertain, and  the feelings they cherish, respecting those who disown the beliefs they  deem important, which makes this country not a place of mental freedom.  For a long time past, the chief mischief of the legal penalties is that  they strengthen the social stigma. It is that stigma which is really  effective, and so effective is it that the profession of opinions which  are under the ban of society is much less common in England, than is, in  many other countries, the avowal of those which incur risk of judicial  punishment. In respect to all persons but those whose pecuniary  circumstances make them independent of the good will of other people,  opinion, on this subject, is as efficacious as law; men might as well be  imprisoned, as excluded from the means of earning their bread. Those  whose bread is already secured, and who desire no favours from men in  power, or from bodies of men, or from the public, have nothing to fear  from the open avowal of any opinions, but to be ill-thought of and  ill-spoken of, and this it ought not to require a very heroic mould to  enable them to bear. There is no room for any appeal _ad misericordiam_  in behalf of such persons. But though we do not now inflict so much evil  on those who think differently from us, as it was formerly our custom to  do, it may be that we do ourselves as much evil as ever by our treatment  of them. Socrates was put to death, but the Socratic philosophy rose  like the sun in heaven, and spread its illumination over the whole  intellectual firmament. Christians were cast to the lions, but the  Christian church grew up a stately and spreading tree, overtopping the  older and less vigorous growths, and stifling them by its shade. Our  merely social intolerance kills no one, roots out no opinions, but  induces men to disguise them, or to abstain from any active effort for  their diffusion. With us, heretical opinions do not perceptibly gain, or  even lose, ground in each decade or generation; they never blaze out far  and wide, but continue to smoulder in the narrow circles of thinking and  studious persons among whom they originate, without ever lighting up the  general affairs of mankind with either a true or a deceptive light. And  thus is kept up a state of things very satisfactory to some minds,  because, without the unpleasant process of fining or imprisoning  anybody, it maintains all prevailing opinions outwardly undisturbed,  while it does not absolutely interdict the exercise of reason by  dissentients afflicted with the malady of thought. A convenient plan for  having peace in the intellectual world, and keeping all things going on  therein very much as they do already. But the price paid for this sort  of intellectual pacification, is the sacrifice of the entire moral  courage of the human mind. A state of things in which a large portion of  the most active and inquiring intellects find it advisable to keep the  genuine principles and grounds of their convictions within their own  breasts, and attempt, in what they address to the public, to fit as much  as they can of their own conclusions to premises which they have  internally renounced, cannot send forth the open, fearless characters,  and logical, consistent intellects who once adorned the thinking world.  The sort of men who can be looked for under it, are either mere  conformers to commonplace, or time-servers for truth, whose arguments on  all great subjects are meant for their hearers, and are not those which  have convinced themselves. Those who avoid this alternative, do so by  narrowing their thoughts and interest to things which can be spoken of  without venturing within the region of principles, that is, to small  practical matters, which"]]]
