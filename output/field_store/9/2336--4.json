LECTURE III    KEPLER AND THE LAWS OF PLANETARY MOTION      It is difficult to imagine a stronger contrast between two men engaged  in the same branch of science than exists between Tycho Brahe, the  subject of last lecture, and Kepler, our subject on the present  occasion.    The one, rich, noble, vigorous, passionate, strong in mechanical  ingenuity and experimental skill, but not above the average in  theoretical and mathematical power.    The other, poor, sickly, devoid of experimental gifts, and unfitted by  nature for accurate observation, but strong almost beyond competition in  speculative subtlety and innate mathematical perception.    The one is the complement of the other; and from the fact of their  following each other so closely arose the most surprising benefits to  science.    The outward life of Kepler is to a large extent a mere record of poverty  and misfortune. I shall only sketch in its broad features, so that we  may have more time to attend to his work.    He was born (so his biographer assures us) in longitude 29 deg. 7', latitude  48 deg. 54', on the 21st of December, 1571. His parents seem to have been of  fair condition, but by reason, it is said, of his becoming surety for a  friend, the father lost all his slender income, and was reduced to  keeping a tavern. Young John Kepler was thereupon taken from school,  and employed as pot-boy between the ages of nine and twelve. He was a  sickly lad, subject to violent illnesses from the cradle, so that his  life was frequently despaired of. Ultimately he was sent to a monastic  school and thence to the University of Tuebingen, where he graduated  second on the list. Meanwhile home affairs had gone to rack and ruin.  His father abandoned the home, and later died abroad. The mother  quarrelled with all her relations, including her son John; who was  therefore glad to get away as soon as possible.    All his connection with astronomy up to this time had been the hearing  the Copernican theory expounded in University lectures, and defending it  in a college debating society.    An astronomical lectureship at Graz happening to offer itself, he was  urged to take it, and agreed to do so, though stipulating that it should  not debar him from some more brilliant profession when there was a  chance.    For astronomy in those days seems to have ranked as a minor science,  like mineralogy or meteorology now. It had little of the special dignity  with which the labours of Kepler himself were destined so greatly to aid  in endowing it.    Well, he speedily became a thorough Copernican, and as he had a most  singularly restless and inquisitive mind, full of appreciation of  everything relating to number and magnitude--was a born speculator and  thinker just as Mozart was a born musician, or Bidder a born  calculator--he was agitated by questions such as these: Why are there  exactly six planets? Is there any connection between their orbital  distances, or between their orbits and the times of describing them?  These things tormented him, and he thought about them day and night. It  is characteristic of the spirit of the times--this questioning why there  should be six planets. Nowadays, we should simply record the fact and  look out for a seventh. Then, some occult property of the number six was  groped for, such as that it was equal to 1 + 2 + 3 and likewise equal to  1 x 2 x 3, and so on. Many fine reasons had been given for the seven  planets of the Ptolemaic system (see, for instance, p. 106), but for  the six planets of the Copernican system the reasons were not so cogent.    Again, with respect to their successive distances from the sun, some law  would seem to regulate their distance, but it was not known.  (Parenthetically I may remark that it is not known even now: a crude  empirical statement known as Bode's law--see page 294--is all that has  been discovered.)    Once more, the further the planet the slower it moved; there seemed to  be some law connecting speed and distance. This also Kepler made  continual attempts to discover.    [Illustration: FIG. 26.--Orbits of some of the planets drawn to scale:  showing the gap between Mars and Jupiter.]    One of his ideas concerning the law of the successive distances was  based on the inscription of a triangle in a circle. If you inscribe in a  circle a large number of equilateral triangles, they envelop another  circle bearing a definite ratio to the first: these might do for the  orbits of two planets (see Fig. 27). Then try inscribing and  circumscribing squares, hexagons, and other figures, and see if the  circles thus defined would correspond to the several planetary orbits.  But they would not give any satisfactory result. Brooding over this  disappointment, the idea of trying solid figures suddenly strikes him.  \"What have plane figures to do with the celestial orbits?\" he cries out;  \"inscribe the regular solids.\" And then--brilliant idea--he remembers  that there are but five. Euclid had shown that there could be only five  regular solids.[4] The number evidently corresponds to the gaps between  the six planets. The reason of there being only six seems to be  attained. This coincidence assures him he is on the right track, and  with great enthusiasm and hope he \"represents the earth's orbit by a  sphere as the norm and measure of all\"; round it he circumscribes a  dodecahedron, and puts another sphere round that, which is approximately  the orbit of Mars; round that, again, a tetrahedron, the corners of  which mark the sphere of the orbit of Jupiter; round that sphere, again,  he places a cube, which roughly gives the orbit of Saturn.    [Illustration: FIG. 27.--Many-sided polygon or approximate circle  enveloped by straight lines, as for instance by a number of equilateral  triangles.]    On the other hand, he inscribes in the sphere of the earth's orbit an  icosahedron; and inside the sphere determined by that, an octahedron;  which figures he takes to inclose the spheres of Venus and of Mercury  respectively.    The imagined discovery is purely fictitious and accidental. First of  all, eight planets are now known; and secondly, their real distances  agree only very approximately with Kepler's hypothesis.    [Illustration: FIG. 28.--Frameworks with inscribed and circumscribed  spheres, representing the five regular solids distributed as Kepler  supposed them to be among the planetary orbits. (See \"Summary\" at  beginning of this lecture, p. 57.)]    Nevertheless, the idea gave him great delight. He says:--\"The intense  pleasure I have received from this discovery can never be told in words.  I regretted no more the time wasted; I tired of no labour; I shunned no  toil of reckoning, days and nights spent in calculation, until I could  see whether my hypothesis would agree with the orbits of Copernicus, or  whether my joy was to vanish into air.\"    He then went on to speculate as to the cause of the planets' motion.  The old idea was that they were carried round by angels or celestial  intelligences. Kepler tried to establish some propelling force emanating  from the sun, like the spokes of a windmill.    This first book of his brought him into notice, and served as an  introduction to Tycho and to Galileo.    Tycho Brahe was at this time at Prague under the patronage of the  Emperor Rudolph; and as he was known to have by far the best planetary  observations of any man living, Kepler wrote to him to know if he might  come and examine them so as to perfect his theory.    Tycho immediately replied, \"Come, not as a stranger, but as a very  welcome friend; come and share in my observations with such instruments  as I have with me, and as a dearly beloved associate.\" After this visit,  Tycho wrote again, offering him the post of mathematical assistant,  which after hesitation was accepted. Part of the hesitation Kepler  expresses by saying that \"for observations his sight was dull, and for  mechanical operations his hand was awkward. He suffered much from weak  eyes, and dare not expose himself to night air.\" In all this he was, of  course, the antipodes of Tycho, but in mathematical skill he was greatly  his superior.    On his way to Prague he was seized with one of his periodical illnesses,  and all his means were exhausted by the time he could set forward again,  so that he had to apply for help to Tycho.    It is clear, indeed, that for some time now he subsisted entirely on the  bounty of Tycho, and he expresses himself most deeply grateful for all  the kindness he received from that noble and distinguished man, the head  of the scientific world at that date.    To illustrate Tycho's kindness and generosity, I must read you a letter  written to him by Kepler. It seems that Kepler, on one of his absences  from Prague, driven half mad with poverty and trouble, fell foul of  Tycho, whom he thought to be behaving badly in money matters to him and  his family, and wrote him a violent letter full of reproaches and  insults. Tycho's secretary replied quietly enough, pointing out the  groundlessness and ingratitude of the accusation.    Kepler repents instantly, and replies:--         \"MOST NOBLE TYCHO,\" (these are the words of his letter), \"how shall       I enumerate or rightly estimate your benefits conferred on me? For       two months you have liberally and gratuitously maintained me, and       my whole family; you have provided"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28617"],[0,"Astounding Stories of Super-Science February 1930 (#10)"],[1," from the car. Yet he  faltered with a revulsion that was almost a nausea. His gun was gripped  in his hand as he ran toward the monster.    \"Come back!\" shouted MacGregor. \"Come back! Have you gone mad?\" He was  jerking at the door of the car.    Beyond the white funnel of their lights a yellow thing was moving. It  twisted and flowed with incredible speed a hundred feet back to the base  of the cliff. It drew itself together in a quivering heap.    An out-thrusting rock threw a sheltering shadow; the moon was low in the  west. In the blackness a phosphorescence was apparent. It rippled and  rose in the dark with the pulsing beat of the jellylike mass. And  through it were showing two discs. Gray at first, they formed to black,  staring eyes.    Thurston had followed. His gun was raised as he neared it. Then out of  the mass shot a serpentine arm. It whipped about him, soft, sticky,  viscid--utterly loathsome. He screamed once when it clung to his face,  then tore savagely and in silence at the encircling folds.           *       *       *       *       *    The gun! He ripped a blinding mass from his face and emptied the  automatic in a stream of shots straight toward the eyes. And he knew as  he fired that the effort was useless; to have shot at the milky surf  would have been as vain.    The thing was pulling him irresistibly; he sank to his knees; it dragged  him over the sand. He clutched at a rock. A vision was before him: the  carcass of a steer, half absorbed and still bleeding on the sand of an  Arizona desert....    To be drawn to the smothering embrace of that glutinous mass ... for  that monstrous appetite.... He tore afresh at the unyielding folds, then  knew MacGregor was beside him.    In the man's hand was a flashlight. The scientist risked his life on a  guess. He thrust the powerful light into the clinging serpent. It was  like the touch of hot iron to human flesh. The arm struggled and flailed  in a paroxysm of pain.    Thurston was free. He lay gasping on the sand. But MacGregor!... He  looked up to see him vanish in the clinging ooze. Another thick tentacle  had been projected from the main mass to sweep like a whip about the  man. It hissed as it whirled about him in the still air.    The flashlight was gone; Thurston's hand touched it in the sand. He  sprang to his feet and pressed the switch. No light responded; the  flashlight was out--broken.    A thick arm slashed and wrapped about him.... It beat him to the ground.  The sand was moving beneath him; he was being dragged swiftly,  helplessly, toward what waited in the shadow. He was smothering.... A  blinding glare filled his eyes....           *       *       *       *       *    The flares were still burning when he dared look about. MacGregor was  pulling frantically at his arm. \"Quick--quick!\" he was shouting.  Thurston scrambled to his feet.    One glimpse he caught of a heaving yellow mass in the white light; it  twisted in horrible convulsions. They ran stumblingly--drunkenly--toward  the car.    Riley was half out of the machine. He had tried to drag himself to their  assistance. \"I couldn't make it,\" he said: \"then I thought of the  flares.\"    \"Thank Heaven,\" said MacGregor with emphasis, \"it was your legs that  were paralyzed, Riley, not your brain.\"    Thurston found his voice. \"Let me have that Very pistol. If light hurts  that damn thing, I am going to put a blaze of magnesium into the middle  of it if I die for it.\"    \"They're all gone,\" said Riley.    \"Then let's get out of here. I've had enough. We can come back later  on.\"    He got back of the wheel and slammed the door of the sedan. The  moonlight was gone. The darkness was velvet just tinged with the gray  that precedes the dawn. Back in the deeper blackness at the cliff-base a  phosphorescent something wavered and glowed. The light rippled and  flowed in all directions over the mass. Thurston felt, vaguely, its  mystery--the bulk was a vast, naked brain; its quiverings were like  visible thought waves....           *       *       *       *       *    The phosphorescence grew brighter. The thing was approaching. Thurston  let in his clutch, but the scientist checked him.    \"Wait,\" he implored, \"wait! I wouldn't miss this for the world.\" He  waved toward the east, where far distant ranges were etched in palest  rose.    \"We know less than nothing of these creatures, in what part  of the universe they are spawned, how they live, where they  live--Saturn!--Mars!--the Moon! But--we shall soon know how one dies!\"    The thing was coming from the cliff. In the dim grayness it seemed less  yellow, less fluid. A membrane enclosed it. It was close to the car. Was  it hunger that drove it, or cold rage for these puny opponents? The  hollow eyes were glaring; a thick arm formed quickly to dart out toward  the car. A cloud, high above, caught the color of approaching day....    Before their eyes the vile mass pulsed visibly; it quivered and beat.  Then, sensing its danger, it darted like some headless serpent for its  machine.    It massed itself about the shattered top to heave convulsively. The top  was lifted, carried toward the rest of the great metal egg. The sun's  first rays made golden arrows through the distant peaks.    The struggling mass released its burden to stretch its vile length  toward the dark caves under the cliffs. The last sheltering fog-veil  parted. The thing was halfway to the high bank when the first bright  shaft of direct sunlight shot through.    Incredible in the concealment of night, the vast protoplasmic pod was  doubly so in the glare of day. But it was there before them, not a  hundred feet distant. And it boiled in vast tortured convulsions. The  clean sunshine struck it, and the mass heaved itself into the air in a  nauseous eruption, then fell limply to the earth.           *       *       *       *       *    The yellow membrane turned paler. Once more the staring black eyes  formed to turn hopelessly toward the sheltering globe. Then the bulk  flattened out on the sand. It was a jellylike mound, through which  trembled endless quivering palpitations.    The sun struck hot, and before the eyes of the watching, speechless men  was a sickening, horrible sight--a festering mass of corruption.    The sickening yellow was liquid. It seethed and bubbled with liberated  gases; it decomposed to purplish fluid streams. A breath of wind blew in  their direction. The stench from the hideous pool was overpowering,  unbearable. Their heads swam in the evil breath.... Thurston ripped the  gears into reverse, nor stopped until they were far away on the clean  sand.    The tide was coming in when they returned. Gone was the vile  putrescence. The waves were lapping at the base of the gleaming machine.    \"We'll have to work fast,\" said MacGregor. \"I must know, I must learn.\"  He drew himself up and into the shattered shell.    It was of metal, some forty feet across, its framework a maze of  latticed struts. The central part was clear. Here in a wide, shallow pan  the monster had rested. Below this was tubing, intricate coils, massive,  heavy and strong. MacGregor lowered himself upon it, Thurston was  beside him. They went down into the dim bowels of the deadly instrument.    \"Hydrogen,\" the physicist was stating. \"Hydrogen--there's our starting  point. A generator, obviously, forming the gas--from what? They couldn't  compress it! They couldn't carry it or make it, not the volume that they  evolved. But they did it, they did it!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Close to the coils a dim light was glowing. It was a pin-point of  radiance in the half-darkness about them. The two men bent closer.    \"See,\" directed MacGregor, \"it strikes on this mirror--bright metal and  parabolic. It disperses the light, doesn't concentrate it! Ah! Here is  another, and another. This one is bent--broken. They are adjustable. Hm!  Micrometer accuracy for reducing the light. The last one could reflect  through this slot. It's light that does it, Thurston, it's light that  does it!\"    \"Does what?\" Thurston had followed the other's analysis of the diffusion  process. \"The light that would finally reach that slot would be hardly  perceptible.\"    \"It's the agent,\" said MacGregor, \"the activator--the catalyst! What  does it strike upon? I must know--I must!\"    The waves were splashing outside the shell. Thurston turned in a  feverish search of the unexplored depths. There was a surprising  simplicity, an absence of complicated mechanism. The generator, with its  tremendous braces to carry its thrust to the framework itself, filled  most of the space. Some of the ribs were thicker, he noticed. Solid  metal, as if they might carry great weights. Resting upon them were  ranged numbers of objects. They were like eggs, slender, and inches in  length. On some were propellers. They worked through the shells on long  slender rods. Each was threaded finely--an adjustable arm engaged the  thread. Thurston called excitedly to the other.    \"Here they are,\" he said. \"Look! Here are the shells. Here's what blew  us up!\"           *       *       *       *       *    He pointed to the slim shafts with their little propellerlike fans.  \"Adjustable, see? Unwind in their fall ... set 'em for any length of  travel ... fires the charge in the air. That's how they wiped out our  air fleet.\"    There were others without the propellers; they had fins to hold them  nose downward. On each nose was a small rounded cap.    \"Detonators of some sort,\" said MacGregor. \"We've got to have one. We  must get it out quick; the tide's coming in.\" He laid his hands upon one  of the slim, egg-shaped things. He lifted, then strained mightily. But  the object did not rise; it only rolled sluggishly.    The scientist stared at it amazed. \"Specific gravity,\" he exclaimed,  \"beyond anything known! There's nothing on earth ... there is no such  substance ... no form of matter....\" His eyes were"]]]
