She had told me not to play with them because they  were not good company for me. She said that she wanted to raise me to be  good and truthful, and that the jailer's little white children told lies  and talked bad.\"    Esther remembers well the mobilization of gray-uniformed troops at the  courthouse which stood only a block from the King residence. \"The town  was filled with soldiers for several days,\" she said. \"They assembled  about the courthouse and had speakings. One day I passed there with my  papa and saw Abraham Lincoln hanging from a noose in the courthouse  square. Of course, it was only an effigy of Abraham Lincoln which was  used to show what the soldiers thought of him. Papa told me that the  soldiers shot the effigy full of bullet holes before they left town.    \"Before Captain King left he brought a man with him from the courthouse  to value his property. The slaves were valued, too. I remember Captain  King lifting me high above his head and saying to the man: 'I wouldn't  take a thousand dollars for this little gem.'\"    She paused a moment. The light in her eyes showed that she was reliving  the thrill of that childhood incident.    \"Then Captain King left with the other soldiers. Papa stayed and took  care of the 'white lady' and the house. After a while my brother ran  away and joined the troops to fight for Captain King. He came back after  the war, but Captain King did not. Several years later I saw a man down  in south Georgia who told me that he belonged to Captain King's troops.  He said that he was standing near him when he was killed.    [Illustration: _Esther King Casey, Birmingham, Alabama_]    \"After the proclamation the slaves were free. Most of them leased out to  plantation owners. I stayed with mamma and the 'white lady.'\"    Mrs. King had taught the little slave girl to read and write, and when  schools were opened for the freed slaves she told the child's mother to  send her to school. Fees of fifty cents a month were charged, which Mrs.  King paid as long as the child remained with her. At eighteen years of  age the girl had acquired sufficient education to qualify to teach in  the public schools for Negroes. After three years of teaching she  married Jim Casey, an ex-slave, who took her to his \"three-plow\" farm in  south Georgia.    \"No man ever lived who was finer than Jim,\" said the old woman. \"My  daughter used to say that I loved him more than God, and that God was  jealous and took him away from me.\"    After her only daughter's death in 1919, Esther was brought to  Birmingham by her grandson who has kept her comfortably ever since. Her  hair is just turning gray, though she was born in 1856. The little briar  pipe, which she endeavors to conceal from strangers, is the only outward  evidence that she has anything in common with others of her generation.          Amy Chapman          *Interview with Amy Chapman*      --_Ruby F. Tartt, Livingston, Alabama_    _DE MASTERS GOOD, BUT OVERSEERS MEAN_    Aunt Amy paused as she worked among the small plants in her garden,  removing a weed here and there. She pushed back the sunbonnet that  shaded her eyes and began:    \"I was bawn on Governor Reuben Chapman's place five miles north of  Livingston on May 14, 1843. My name is Amy Chapman.

I saw him hangin' on a tree      In agony an' blood      He fixed his languid eyes on me      As near his cross I stood.        Sho' never till my latter breath      Kin I forgit dat look      He seemed to change me wid his death      Yit not a word he spoke.

Poole_    Living in a small room in the rear of a house at 361 Augusta Street,  Mobile, Alabama, the writer located an interesting ex-slave, Emma  Chapman, who when first approached was somewhat reticent. I soon learned  I had arrived just as she was ready to have her breakfast, which  consisted of bread and coffee, and insisted she eat first and talk  afterwards, as she had made just about enough fire in the open fireplace  to boil the coffee.    While she followed my suggestion I glanced about the room and found it  very neat and tidy and an unusually comfortable looking double bed, a  mirrored door chifferobe and two trunks, one rocking chair and a couple  of straight chairs, a table containing all cooking utensils and food  containers. The walls were covered with sheets of manilla wrapping  paper, tacked on, and part of the ceiling patched with odds and ends of  corrugated paper. Emma is small in stature, of light complexion with  greying hair arranged in neat braids around her head, very clean in  appearance.    Emma said she was about 13 years of age at the time of the surrender,  and that she was born on the plantation of Rev. Mr. Montgomery Curry of  Charleston, S.C. When she was about 3 years of age Mr. Curry moved to  Pickens County, Alabama, about 5 miles from Carrollton and 8 miles from  Pickenville. When I asked why they moved to Alabama, Emma laughed, and  said they expected to find money growing on trees in Alabama, and that  she as a child came near being \"snake bit\" many a time, digging around  the roots of old trees, trying to find money.    Rev. Montgomery Curry, said Emma, was married to Ann Haynie, whose  parents were Aaron and Francis Hudson Haynie, and Emma's grandmother was  Lucy Linier, who was born in Virginia and was sold to Mr. Haynie to pay  a debt. Lucy Linier was nurse for his daughter Ann and when she married  Mr. Curry, she brought Lucy with her to her new home.

I's sure  glad dat you come, for it'll show Sam dat dat chicken never told a lie.    \"Set down dere and let me fetch you a plate of boil peanuts, which I  just is set off de fire. You lak them? Glad you do, honey. Most white  folks love them dat way, 'stead of parched. How you been? You sure is  growed since de last day I clap my eyes on you. How's I been? Poorly.

I 'members  well, dat de twins was born on a Wednesday and I walk to Red Hill Church  de very nex' Sunday. Rev. Richard Cook was de preacher. Him didn't see  me a settin' in de church and he pray for me by name, as bein' in de  perils of childbirth.

It was a moonlight  Tuesday night. Brother Stevenson and Brother Moore was a helpin' Brother  Richard Cook carry on de meetin'. It was de last day of August, in '86.  Brother Moore had preached, de choir had sung a hymn, and Brother  Stevenson was in de middle of a prayer. Him said sumpin' 'bout de devil  goin' 'round lak a roarin' lion a seekin' folks for to devour. Then de  roarin' was heard. De church commence to crack and shake and rock. Then  all de folks holler: 'Oh Lordy.' They run out dat church and some took  up de big road to de depot at Woodward. Some fell down in de moonlight  and cry and pray. Brother Cook say de Bible says: 'Bow down, or kneel or  fall on your face befo' de Lord'. Then he say: 'Let us all fall on our  faces dis time.' Us did and each one of them preachers pray.

I was too little to learn to read and write, but dey  never learned any slaved to do dat. Dey never paid us any money wages,  just give us eats and a place to sleep, and a little clothes. I worked  in de field when I got bigger. Never had school in de place, and never  had a church, either.    \"Us children played lots of games, like rolly-hole. There are two holes  and you try to roll a ball in one hole. The white folks had  corn-shuckings, lots of them, as they raised lots of corn on de farms.  Dey had cotton pickings, too, and carding and spinning bees, quilting  bees. I used to feed de shippers when women folks spin de yarn, when I  was a small boy. We raised plenty corn, cotton, and other things. We had  a big garden, too.    \"When freedom come all of us left and went off. I went back to get  something to eat.
