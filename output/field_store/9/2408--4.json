[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33029"],[0,"Ducks and Geese (#10)"],[1,"Lights._ Most duck farms at the present time are located where  electric lighting is available. It is desirable and in fact almost  necessary to have the various houses wired so that lights can be turned  on when desired. In addition, lights are usually provided in the yards  for fattening ducks and are used at night and especially during storms  to keep the ducks from stampeding.    _Water Supply._ An adequate water supply is essential. This will consist  of a well or spring furnishing an ample amount of water, a power pump  and a water supply tank. From the tank, the water must be piped to the  incubator cellar, the brooder houses, the killing house, the feed house  and to any of the yards where the ducks do not have access to a natural  supply of good water. In addition, of course, the water from the same  tank is usually used to supply the residence.    _Fences._ Not a great deal of investment is necessary in fences since  the yards are rather small and the fences are low. Two-foot fences of  two-inch mesh wire are used for the yard ducks while for the little  ducks 18-inch wire of one-inch mesh is used. The biggest items of  expense connected with the fences are the cost of the stakes or posts  used in their construction and the labor used in this work. The portion  of the yards extending into the water are the most troublesome and most  expensive to build. In some cases, rather elaborate wooden picket fences  are used in the water yards. These are more permanent but are more  expensive to build.    _Labor._ For a plant of the size indicated there would be required in  addition to an active working proprietor three other men. One man would  be needed to operate the incubators, one man would devote his time to  the brooder houses, one man would feed the yard ducks and the fattening  pens, and one man would do the killing and packing, take care of the  feathers, clean the yards, etc. Of course, there would be periods when  these men would not have their entire time taken up with their  particular duties and this would permit them to turn in and help with  the miscellaneous work on the plant.    In addition to the regular men employed, additional labor would be  necessary to do the picking. For this purpose pickers are usually  brought in and work by the piece. During the spring of 1920 these  pickers received six cents per duck and they will average about 75 ducks  a day, beginning work at 6 in the morning and finishing by noon or a  little later. Some pickers will average as high as 100 ducks a day. In  the busy season from 800 to 1200 ducks will be marketed per week and the  usual practice is to kill and pick not over three days a week, usually  during the first part of the week.    _Invested Capital._ Investment in the business exclusive of working  capital, that is to say, the money in the land and buildings and other  equipment would require under present conditions about $1,000 for each  thousand ducks marketed. In other words, in a plant of this size, close  to $30,000 would be invested. The amount of invested capital depends to  some extent upon location and upon the elaborateness of the buildings  and other equipment but with a well laid out economical plant an  investment of the size indicated should be sufficient.    _Working Capital._ In addition to the capital invested in the plant  there would be required a considerable amount of working capital. From  the first of November to the beginning of the marketing of the ducks  there would be required from $6,000 to $8,000 with which to purchase  feed, meet the pay roll, and for other running expenses. Even after the  marketing begins there would be a period of from a month to six weeks  when the expenses will continue to be greater than the receipts so that  some additional capital might be necessary. However, returns would begin  to come in which could be used to take care of the more pressing current  obligations so that additional working capital which might be needed  over that indicated would not be large.    _Profits._ The profits in commercial duck raising vary widely, as must  be expected, depending upon the management, upon the season and upon  prices received. After deducting all overhead charges and interest on  the investment, the net return per duck should be at least 10 cents per  duckling marketed. In fact the return should be 15 cents to provide much  inducement to engage in the business. Some seasons the returns will run  greater than this but on the other hand, there is always the chance of  occasional big losses.          CHAPTER IV    Commercial Duck Farming--Management of the Breeding Stock      _Age of Breeders._ On most large commercial duck plants the entire  breeding stock is renewed each year. In other words, the breeders are  kept only through their first laying season. This makes it necessary to  select from the young stock reared and save for breeders as many head as  it is desired to carry for the coming year. This practice is used for  the reason that ducks lay best during their first year. Therefore, since  it is desired to keep up the maximum egg production in order to raise as  many market ducks as possible, young breeders are considered better.  Some raisers, however, keep a part of their breeding ducks for two years  and occasionally for 3 or even 4 years but this is not the usual  practice. Recent comparison made between young and two year old ducks as  breeders would seem to indicate that ducklings hatched from the eggs of  the latter live a little better.    _Distinguishing Young from Old Ducks._ In this connection it is of  interest to know how young ducks can be readily distinguished from the  older birds. The young ducks have bright yellow legs and bills while  the old ducks after a period of laying, lose a considerable amount of  the yellow from these sections. In addition, soon after the ducks begin  to lay, their bills as a rule will begin to be streaked with black.  Young ducks can also be told from the old ducks by feeling of the end of  the breast bone which runs to a point at the abdomen. In the older ducks  this is hard while in the young ducks it is gristly and bends easily.  The windpipe of an old duck is hard and rather difficult to compress or  dent while in the young duck it is softer and easily dented.    _Selection of Breeding Ducks._ The breeders are usually selected from  the ducklings which reach market age from the last week in June through  July. As these lots become ready for market and are driven into the pens  to be slaughtered each duck is handled and any especially good birds  which the proprietor thinks will make good breeders are thrown out at  this time.    In making selection of breeders those are chosen which are healthy and  thrifty and which have good wide, long and deep bodies. Ducks with  crooked wings, crooked tails, hump backs or paddle legs are rejected for  this purpose. After the young ducks for breeders are selected they are  put in a yard or fattening pen until the number which the owner expects  to keep is complete. These young breeders generally begin to moult soon  after they are selected and from this time on they are fed whole corn  and plenty of green feed until it is time to begin feeding the laying  ration. Some of the breeding ducks will usually begin to lay about  December 1 although they will not lay heavily at that time. The laying  ration described later should be begun about that time or a couple of  weeks earlier.    _Number of Females to a Drake._ As a rule on commercial duck farms the  birds are mated in the proportion of about one drake to seven ducks.  This proportion will vary to some extent under different methods of  management and weather conditions and may run all the way from 1 to 5 to  1 to 8. The smaller number of drakes should be used late in the season  while the larger number will give better fertility early in the breeding  season.    Since the drakes do not fight seriously, flock matings can be made.  Better results will be obtained from smaller flocks than from large  flocks and there will also be less cracked eggs and less very dirty eggs  from the smaller flocks. Before the ducks are let out in the morning  there is a tendency for them to run back and forth through the pens, and  in this way they tramp over many of the eggs which are laid anywhere  about the floor. The larger the flock the more cracked and dirty eggs  will result. While the drakes do not fight each other they do at times  injure and kill the ducks to some extent when three or four drakes may  chase one duck. In this way they may injure the ducks' backs and often  pick their eyes and necks. Whenever a duck is found which is injured she  should be removed from the flock. Difficulty of this sort is most  prevalent about the 1st of March. If the trouble gets very bad it can be  stopped to some extent by cutting back the upper bills of the drakes  about one-fourth of an inch with a tinsnip or by reducing the proportion  of drakes.    _Securing Breeding Drakes._ It is common practice on duck plants to  avoid inbreeding by securing drakes from some other flock each year.  This is usually accomplished by buying the drakes outright from some  neighboring duck farmer. It may also be accomplished by purchasing a few  eggs for hatching in order to secure new blood. In any particular  community there is a tendency for the duck farmers to trade breeding  drakes among themselves for a period of years with the result that they  all have much the same blood and not a great deal of benefit is obtained  from securing the drakes from some neighbor's flock. It is undoubtedly  good practice to go farther afield occasionally for a supply of breeding  drakes. In purchasing stock for new blood be sure that it is as good as  the home stock and better if it can be found. It will do no good to  purchase and use inferior stock and may do much harm.

The testes of specimen MCT 2807 were probably regressing       since it was beginning the molt.    _=Meiglyptes tristis micropternus=_ Hesse: Fulvous-rumped Barred  Woodpecker.--_Specimens_, 2: Cocoa Research Station: [Female], 31.7 gm.,  July 7, 1962, MCT 2607; [Male], May 28, 1963, ADG 115.         Compared with _M. tukki_, this species was comparatively rare. I       saw two on July 7 working in a living tree some 15 feet above the       ground. The tree was only 20 feet high and had dense foliage. The       birds gave a rattling call note of about two seconds duration; it       sounded like a typical woodpecker call. The single call note can be       rendered _cheet_. They were also heard drumming, but only softly.       The stomachs contained ants, which probably are what the two       woodpeckers were feeding on in the green tree.    _=Meiglyptes tukki tukki=_ (Lesson): Buff-necked Barred  Woodpecker.--_Specimens_, 13: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] testis 2 x  1 mm., heavy molt, July 10, 1962, MCT 2614; [Female], 53.3 gm., July 28,  1962, MCT 2677; [Male], 51.5 gm., July 28, 1962, MCT 2679; [Female],  48.7 gm., July 28, 1962, MCT 2678; [Male], December 2, 1962, MCT 3423;  [Female], December 2, 1962, MCT 3424; [Female], December 2, 1962, MCT  3425. 12 mi.

Pintasan Agriculture Station:  [Female], October 17, 1963, ADG 313.         This was the most common woodpecker at the Cocoa Research Station.       A flock of four was seen on July 28, 1962, and on December 2, 1962,       I took three simultaneously in one mist net. The species has       flocking tendencies. Calls heard were a typical woodpecker rattle.    _=Dinopium rafflesi dulitense=_ Delacour: Olive-backed Three-toed  Woodpecker.--_Specimens_, 4: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] testis 11 x  7 mm., July 12, 1962, MCT 2620; [Male], September 6, 1962, MCT 2879. 12  mi. N Kalabakan: [Male], October 20, 1962, MCT 3097. Oil Palm Research  Station: [Male], August 12, 1963, ADG 227.         The species was taken in both primary and secondary forest. The       specimen collected at the Cocoa Research Station on July 12       suggests that the species breeds there.    _=Dryocopus javensis javensis=_ (Horsfield): Great Black  Woodpecker.--_Specimens_, 4: Cocoa Research Station: [Female] old brood  patch, 284.7 gm., light body and tail molt, July 6, 1962, MCT 2601;  [Male] by plumage, July 19, 1962, MCT 2625; [Female], June 25, 1963, ADG  162; [Male], May 26, 1963, ADG 112.         This species was common at the Cocoa Research Station. On June 30,       1962, a flock of six was moving through secondary forest. On July       6, 1962, I saw four in dead trees in one of the cocoa fields.    _=Mulleripicus pulverulentus pulverulentus=_ (Temminck): Great Slaty  Woodpecker.--_Specimen_, 1: Tiger Estate: [Male], November 25, 1962, MCT  3326.         I saw this species once at the Cocoa Research Station, where a       flock of four was feeding 30 feet up in secondary forest about 100       feet high on October 4, 1962.    _=Blythipicus rubiginosus parvus=_ Chasen and Kloss: Maroon  Woodpecker.--_Specimens_, 2: Cocoa Research Station: [Male], September  28, 1962, MCT 2975. 12 mi. N Kalabakan: [Male] imm., October 17, 1962,  MCT 3062.         I saw this bird sporadically while I was on the east coast. It       seemed to prefer secondary forest that had some undergrowth and was       invariably flushed from the understory.    _=Chrysocolaptes validus xanthopygius=_ Finsch: Orange-backed  Woodpecker.--_Specimens_, 4: Cocoa Research Station: [Male], light body  and wing molt, July 2, 1962, MCT 2575; [Male] testis 5 x 3 mm., 168.5  gm., July 23, 1962, MCT 2640; [Female], 176.1 gm., July 23, 1962, MCT  2641; [Male], September 28, 1962, MCT 2976.         This was one of the more common woodpeckers at the Cocoa Research       Station. I saw it throughout the period I was there, in secondary       forest and dead trees in the cocoa fields.    _=Calyptomena viridis gloriosa=_ Deignan: Green Broadbill.--_Specimens_,  10: Cocoa Research Station: [Female], 67.4 gm., August 1, 1962, MCT  2698; [Female], 53.2 gm., September 16, 1962, MCT 2927; [Female], May 6,  1963, ADG 106; [Male], June 18, 1963, ADG 148; [Female] by plumage, June  26, 1963, ADG 164. 12 mi.

Pintasan: [Male], October 16, 1963, ADG 310.         Sight records of this species are evidently a poor indication of       its abundance, because I saw but one in the field at the Cocoa       Research Station, a male sitting in the top of cocoa tree about       eight feet up. All the specimens were netted, and the number so       taken indicates not only that the species is common but also that       it frequents the lower levels of the forest as well as the tops of       tall trees (as noted by Smythies, 1960:339).    _=Cymbirhynchus macrorhynchus macrorhynchus=_ (Gmelin): Black-and-Red  Broadbill.--_Specimens_, 2: Kalabakan: [Male], November 16, 1962, MCT  3296. Tiger Estate: [Male], November 25, 1962, MCT 3321.         This species was seen only at Kalabakan, where I caught two in one       net in dense secondary forest.    _=Eurylaimus ochromalus ochromalus=_ Raffles: Black-and-Yellow  Broadbill.--_Specimens_, 9: Cocoa Research Station: [Male], 32.0 gm.,  July 28, 1962, MCT 2682; [Male], 32.0 gm., August 1, 1962, MCT 2747;  [Male], 33.8 gm., August 10, 1962, MCT 2753; [Female], 34.0 gm.,  September 11, 1962, MCT 2892; [Male], 34.7 gm., September 14, 1962, MCT  2926; [Female], September 26, 1962, MCT 2968; [Male], April 27, 1963,  ADG 71. Agricultural Station Gum-Gum: [Female], September 26, 1963, ADG  284. Pintasan Agriculture Station: [Female], October 16, 1963, ADG 311.         This broadbill was common at the Cocoa Research Station in cocoa       fields and adjacent secondary forest; it was never seen in primary       forest. On September 4, 1962, I saw 10 to 15 in the cocoa, moving       in a loose flock. The birds uttered call notes and at the same time       bowed their heads sharply, as if to emphasize the call. Frequent       supplanting, attacks, and other aggressive interactions were seen.       The species was heard and observed also at a place 12 miles north       of Kalabakan, at the edge of, but never in, primary forest.    _=Eurylaimus javanicus brookei=_ Robinson and Kloss: Banded  Broadbill.--_Specimen_, 1: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] testis 7 x 4  mm., 81.8 gm., July 25, 1962, MCT 2660.         This broadbill was seen only on two occasions at the Cocoa Research       Station, both times at the edge of the primary forest.    _=Pitta baudi=_ Muller and Schlegel: Blue-headed Pitta.--_Specimens_, 6:  12 mi. N Kalabakan: [Female], October 17, 1962, MCT 3067; [Female],  October 23, 1962, MCT 3131; [Male], October 30, 1962, MCT 3182;  [Female], October 30, 1962, MCT 3185; [Female], November 5, 1962, MCT  3212; [Male] testis 4 x 3 mm., November 6, 1962, MCT 3213.         The Blue-headed Pitta was abundant at the Kalabakan collecting       locality, in primary forest. It was seen only once at the Cocoa       Research Station.         The voice of this bird was a one-note whistle with a terminal       inflection. It reminded me of a small child crying. When one       called, it was usually in chorus with several others.    _=Pitta guajana schwaneri=_ Bonaparte: Banded Pitta.--_Specimens_, 4:  Cocoa Research Station: [Female] imm, 63.4 gm., July 24, 1962, MCT 2651;  [Male] testis 6 x 3 mm., 81.5 gm., August 4, 1962, MCT 2723; [Female]  imm., 71.8 gm., August 4, 1962, MCT 2724; [Male], June 15, 1963, ADG  145.         The specimens were taken in primary forest. This pitta was       exceedingly tame, often moving along only 20 feet ahead of the       observer. The one adult male taken hopped along the forest floor,       occasionally jumping up on a log or plant to look back. It finally       flushed and flew about 30 feet ahead of me to a log; there it gave       a call which can be rendered as _shewo_, repeated at 10- to       15-second intervals. The call was much like that of _Pitta       sordida_.    _=Pitta brachyura moluccensis=_ (P. L. S. Mueller): Blue-winged  Pitta.--_Specimen_, 1: Tenom: [Female] oviduct slightly enlarged,  edematized brood patch, December 31, 1962, MCT 3544.         The specimen was taken in a net stretched across a dry stream near       the Padas River in a relatively open area near a coconut grove with       some bamboo and elephant ears nearby.    _=Pitta sordida mulleri=_ Bonaparte: Green-breasted Pitta.--_Specimens_,  2: Cocoa Research Station: [Female], May 1, 1963, ADG 96; [Female],  July 15, 1963, ADG 203.         The discovery of this bird by Garcia was a surprise. I was familiar       with its habits and calls in the Philippines, and in four months I       never heard or observed it at the Cocoa Research Station. Perhaps       the specimens were migrants.    _=Hirundo tahitica abbotti=_ Oberholser: Pacific Swallow.--_Specimen_,  1: Cocoa Research Station: [Male], April 26, 1963, ADG 58.         This species was common at most localities on the east coast. On       June 25, 1962, a pair was building a nest under the Cocoa Research       Station laboratory. On July 21 young were observed leaving the       nest, at the research station rest house.    _=Hirundo rustica gutturalis=_ Scopoli: Common Swallow.--_Specimens_, 9:  12 mi.
