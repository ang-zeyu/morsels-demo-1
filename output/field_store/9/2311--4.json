Troubles from such sources  could be entirely obviated by feeding limited quantities of such  material immediately after milking. Under such conditions the taint  produced is usually eliminated before the next milking. The milk of  swill-fed cows is said to possess a peculiar taste, and the urine of  animals fed on this food is said to be abnormally acid. Brewers' grains  and distillery slops when fed in excess also induce a similar condition  in the milk.    Milk may also acquire other than volatile substances directly from the  animal, as in cases where drugs, as belladonna, castor oil, sulfur,  turpentine, jalap, croton oil, and many others have been used as  medicine. Such mineral poisons as arsenic have been known to appear  eight hours after ingestion, and persist for a period of three weeks  before being eliminated.    ~Absorption of odors after milking.~ If milk is brought in contact with  strong odors after being drawn from the animal, it will absorb them  readily, as in the barn, where frequently it is exposed to the odor of  manure and other fermenting organic matter.    It has long been a popular belief that milk evolves odors and cannot  absorb them so long as it is warmer than the surrounding air, but from  experimental evidence, the writer[47] has definitely shown that the  direct absorption of odors takes place much more rapidly when the milk  is warm than when cold, although under either condition, it absorbs  volatile substances with considerable avidity. In this test fresh milk  was exposed to an atmosphere impregnated with odors of various essential  oils and other odor-bearing substances. Under these conditions, the  cooler milk was tainted very much less than the milk at body temperature  even where the period of exposure was brief. It is therefore evident  that an exposure in the cow barn where the volatile emanations from the  animals themselves and their excreta taint the air will often result in  the absorption of these odors by the milk to such an extent as to  seriously affect the flavor.    The custom of straining the milk in the barn has long been deprecated as  inconsistent with proper dairy practice, and in the light of the above  experiments, an additional reason is evident why this should not be  done.    Even after milk is thoroughly cooled, it may absorb odors as seen where  the same is stored in a refrigerator with certain fruits, meats, fish,  etc.    ~Distinguishing bacterial from non-bacterial taints.~ In perfectly fresh  milk, it is relatively easy to distinguish between taints caused by the  growth of bacteria and those attributable to direct absorption.    If the taint is evident at time of milking, it is in all probability due  to character of feed consumed, or possibly to medicines. If, however,  the intensity of the taint grows more pronounced as the milk becomes  older, then it is probably due to living organisms, which require a  certain period of incubation before their fermentative properties are  most evident.    Moreover, if the difficulty is of bacterial origin, it can be frequently  transferred to another lot of milk (heated or sterilized is preferable)  by inoculating same with some of the original milk. Not all abnormal  fermentations are able though to compete with the lactic acid bacteria,  and hence outbreaks of this sort soon die out by the re-establishment of  more normal conditions.    ~Treatment of directly absorbed taints.~ Much can be done to overcome  taints of this nature by exercising greater care in regard to the feed  of animals, and especially as to the time of feeding and milking. But  with milk already tainted, it is often possible to materially improve  its condition. Thorough aeration has been frequently recommended, but  most satisfactory results have been obtained where a combined process of  aeration and pasteurization was resorted to. Where the milk is used in  making butter, the difficulty has been successfully met by washing the  cream with twice its volume of hot water in which a little saltpeter has  been dissolved (one teaspoonful per gallon), and then separating it  again.[48]    The treatment of abnormal conditions due to bacteria has been given  already under the respective sources of infection, and is also still  further amplified in following chapter.    ~Aeration.~ It is a common belief that aeration is of great aid in  improving the quality of milk, yet, when closely studied, no material  improvement can be determined, either where the milk is made into butter  or sold as milk. Dean in Canada and Storch in Denmark have both  experimented on the influence of aeration in butter making, but with  negative results. Marshall and Doane failed to observe any material  improvement in keeping quality, but it is true that odors are eliminated  from the milk during aeration. The infection of the milk during aeration  often more than counterbalances the reputed advantage. Especially is  this so if the aeration is carried out in an atmosphere that is not  perfectly clean and pure.    In practice aeration differs greatly. In some cases, air is forced into  the milk; in others, the milk is allowed to distribute itself in a thin  sheet over a broad surface and fall some distance so that it is brought  intimately in contact with the air. This latter process is certainly  much more effective if carried out under conditions which preclude  infection. It must be remembered that aeration is frequently combined  with cooling, in which case the reputed advantages may not be entirely  attributable to the process of aeration.    ~Infection of milk in the factory.~ The problem of proper handling of milk  is not entirely solved when the milk is delivered to the factory or  creamery, although it might be said that the danger of infection is much  greater while the milk is on the farm.    In the factory, infection can be minimized because effective measures of  cleanliness can be more easily applied. Steam is available in most  cases, so that all vats, cans, churns and pails can be thoroughly  scalded. Special emphasis should be given to the matter of cleaning  pumps and pipes. The difficulty of keeping these utensils clean often  leads to neglect and subsequent infection. In Swiss cheese factories,  the custom of using home-made rennet solutions is responsible for  considerable factory infection. Natural rennets are soaked in whey which  is kept warm in order to extract the rennet ferment. This solution when  used for curdling the milk often adds undesirable yeasts and other  gas-generating organisms, which are later the cause of abnormal ferment  action in the cheese (See page 186).    The influence of the air on the germ content of the milk is, as a rule,  overestimated. If the air is quiet, and free from dust, the amount of  germ life in the same is not relatively large. In a creamery or factory,  infection from this source ought to be much reduced, for the reason that  the floors and wall are, as a rule, quite damp, and hence germ life  cannot easily be dislodged. The majority of organisms found under such  conditions come from the person of the operators and attendants. Any  infection can easily be prevented by having the ripening cream-vats  covered with a canvas cloth. The clothing of the operator should be  different from the ordinary wearing-apparel. If made of white duck, the  presence of dirt is more quickly recognized, and greater care will  therefore be taken than if ordinary clothes are worn.    The surroundings of the factory have much to do with the danger of germ  infection. Many factories are poorly constructed and the drainage is  poor, so that filth and slime collect about and especially under the  factory. The emanations from these give the peculiar \"factory odor\" that  indicates fermenting matter. Not only are these odors absorbed  directly, but germ life from the same is apt to find its way into the  milk. Connell[49] has recently reported a serious defect in cheese that  was traced to germ infection from defective factory drains.    The water supply of a factory is also a question of prime importance.  When taken from a shallow well, especially if surface drainage from the  factory is possible, the water may be contaminated to such an extent as  to introduce undesirable bacteria in such numbers that the normal course  of fermentation may be changed. The quality of the water, aside from  flavor, can be best determined by making a curd test (p. 76) which is  done by adding some of the water to boiled milk and incubating the same.  If \"gassy\" fermentations occur, it signifies an abnormal condition. In  deep wells, pumped as thoroughly as is generally the case with factory  wells, the germ content should be very low, ranging from a few score to  a few hundred bacteria per cc. at most.    Harrison[50] has recently traced an off-flavor in cheese in a Canadian  factory to an infection arising from the water-supply. He found the same  germ in both water and cheese and by inoculating a culture into  pasteurized milk succeeded in producing the undesirable flavor. The  danger from ice is much less, for the reason that good dairy practice  does not sanction using ice directly in contact with milk or cream.  Then, too, ice is largely purified in the process of freezing, although  if secured from a polluted source, reliance should not be placed in the  method of purification; for even freezing does not destroy all  vegetating bacteria.

He could no more sympathize with her petty aims,  than she with the high views and ambitions; and conjugal sympathy was  far more necessary to her than to him. His studious friends and clever  children afforded him an abundance of human fellowship; his public cares  and intellectual pursuits gave him constant diversion. He stood in such  small need of her, that if some benevolent fairy had suddenly endowed  her with grace, wisdom, and understanding, the sum of his satisfaction  would not have been perceptibly altered. But apart from him she had no  sufficient enjoyments. His genuine companionship was requisite for her  happiness; but for this society nature had endowed her with no fitness.  In the case of an unhappy marriage, where the unhappiness is not caused  by actual misconduct, but is solely due to incongruity of tastes and  capacities, it is cruel to assume that the superior person of the  ill-assorted couple has the stronger claim to sympathy.    Finding his wife less tractable than he wished, More withheld his  confidence from her, taking the most important steps of his life,  without either asking for her advice, or even announcing the course  which he was about to take. His resignation of the seals was announced  to her on the day _after_ his retirement from office, and in a manner  which, notwithstanding its drollery, would greatly pain any woman of  ordinary sensibility. The day following the date of his resignation was  a holiday; and in accordance with his usage the ex-Chancellor, together  with his household, attended service in Chelsea Church. On her way to  church, Lady More returned the greetings of her friends with a  stateliness not unseemly at that ceremonious time in one who was the  lady of the Lord High Chancellor. At the conclusion of service, ere she  left her pew, the intelligence was broken to her in a jest that she had  lost her cherished dignity. \"And whereas upon the holidays during his  High Chancellorship one of his gentlemen, when the service of the church  was done, ordinarily used to come to my lady his wife's pew-door, and  say unto her '_Madam, my lord is gone_,' he came into my lady his wife's  pew himself, and making a low courtesy, said unto her, 'Madam, my lord  is gone,' which she, imagining to be but one of his jests, as he used  many unto her, he sadly affirmed unto her that it was true. This was the  way he thought fittest to break the matter unto his wife, who was full  of sorrow to hear it.\"    Equally humorous and pathetic was that memorable interview between More  and his wife in the Tower, when she, regarding his position by the  lights with which nature had endowed her, counseled him to yield even at  that late moment to the king. \"What the goodyear, Mr. More!\" she cried,  bustling up to the tranquil and courageous man. \"I marvel that you, who  have been hitherto always taken for a wise man, will now so play the  fool as to lie here in this close, filthy prison, and be content to be  shut up thus with mice and rats, when you might be abroad at your  liberty, with the favor and good-will both of the king and his council,  if you would but do as the bishops and best learned of his realm have  done; and, seeing you have at Chelsea a right fair house, your library,  your books, your gallery, and all other necessaries so handsome about  you, where you might, in company with me, your wife, your children, and  household, be merry, I muse what, in God's name, you mean, here thus  fondly to tarry.\" Having heard her out--preserving his good-humor, he  said to her, with a cheerful countenance, \"I pray thee, good Mrs.  Alice, tell me one thing!\" \"What is it?\" saith she, \"Is not this house  as near heaven as my own?\"    Sir Thomas More was looking towards heaven.    Mistress Alice had her eye upon the 'right fair house' at Chelsea.          CHAPTER VII.    GOOD QUEEN BESS.      Amongst the eminent men who are frequently mentioned as notorious  suitors for the personal affection of Queen Elizabeth, a conspicuous  place is awarded to Hatton, by the scandalous memoirs of his time and  the romantic traditions of later ages. Historians of the present  generation have accepted without suspicion the story that Hatton was  Elizabeth's amorous courtier, that the fanciful letters of 'Lydds' were  fervent solicitations for response to his passion; that he won her favor  and his successive promotions by timely exhibition of personal grace and  steady perseverance in flattery. Campbell speaks of the queen and her  chancellor as 'lovers;' and the view of the historian has been upheld by  novelists and dramatic writers.    The writer of this page ventures to reject a story which is not  consistent with truth, and casts a dark suspicion on her who was not  more powerful as a queen than virtuous as a woman.    For illustrations of lovers' pranks amongst the Elizabethan lawyers, the  reader must pass to two great judges, the inferior of whom was a far  greater man than Christopher Hatton. Rivals in law and politics, Bacon  and Coke were also rivals in love. Having wooed the same proud, lovely,  capricious, violent woman, the one was blessed with failure, and the  other was cursed with success.    Until a revolution in the popular estimate of Bacon was effected by Mr.  Hepworth Dixon's vindication of that great man, it was generally  believed that love was no appreciable element in his nature. Delight in  vain display occupied in his affections the place which should have been  held by devotion to womanly beauty and goodness; he had sneered at love  in an essay, and his cold heart never rebelled against the doctrine of  his clever brain; he wooed his notorious cousin for the sake of power,  and then married Alice Barnham for money. Such was the theory, the most  solid foundation of which was a humorous treatise,[4] misread and  misapplied.    The lady's wealth, rank, and personal attractions were in truth the only  facts countenancing the suggestion that Francis Bacon proffered suit to  his fair cousin from interested motives. Notwithstanding her defects of  temper, no one denies that she was a woman qualified by nature to rouse  the passion of man. A wit and beauty, she was mistress of the arts which  heighten the powers of feminine tact and loveliness. The daughter of Sir  Thomas Cecil, the grandchild of Lord Burleigh, she was Francis Bacon's  near relation; and though the Cecils were not inclined to help him to  fortune, he was nevertheless one of their connection, and consequently  often found himself in familiar conversation with the bright and  fascinating woman. Doubtless she played with him, persuading herself  that she merely treated him with cousinly cordiality, when she was  designedly making him her lover. The marvel was that she did not give  him her hand; that he sought it is no occasion for surprise--or for  insinuations that he coveted her wealth. Biography is by turns  mischievously communicative and vexatiously silent. That Bacon loved Sir  William Hatton's widow, and induced Essex to support his suit, and that  rejecting him she gave herself to his enemy, we know; but history tells  us nothing of the secret struggle which preceded the lady's resolution  to become the wife of an unalluring, ungracious, peevish, middle-aged  widower. She must have felt some tenderness for her cousin, whose  comeliness spoke to every eye, whose wit was extolled by every lip.  Perhaps she, like many others, had misread the essay 'Of Love,' and felt  herself bound in honor to bring the philosopher to his knees at her  feet. It is credible that from the outset of their sentimental  intercourse, she intended to win and then to flout him. But coquetry  cannot conquer the first laws of human feeling. To be a good flirt, a  woman must have nerve and a sympathetic nature; and doubtless the flirt  in this instance paid for her triumph with the smart of a lasting wound.  Is it fanciful to argue that her subsequent violence and misconduct, her  impatience of control and scandalous disrespect for her aged husband,  may have been in some part due to the sacrifice of personal inclination  which she made in accepting Coke at the entreaty of prudent and selfish  relations--and to the contrast, perpetually haunting her, between what  she was as Sir Edward's termagant partner, and what she might have been  as Francis Bacon's wife?    She consented to a marriage with Edward Coke, but was so ashamed of her  choice, that she insisted on a private celebration of their union,  although Archbishop Whitgift had recently raised his voice against the  scandal of clandestine weddings, and had actually forbidden them. In the  face of the primate's edict the ill-assorted couple were united in  wedlock, without license or publication of banns, by a country parson,  who braved the displeasure of Whitgift, in order that he might secure  the favor of a secular patron. The wedding-day was November 24, 1598,  the bridegroom's first wife having been buried on the 24th of the  previous July.[5] On learning the violation of his orders, the  archbishop was so incensed that he resolved to excommunicate the  offenders, and actually instituted for that purpose legal proceedings,  which were not dropped until bride and bridegroom humbly sued for  pardon, pleading ignorance of law in excuse of their misbehavior.    The scandalous consequences of that marriage are known to every reader  who has laughed over the more pungent and comic scenes of English  history. Whilst Lady Hatton gave masques and balls in the superb palace  which came into her possession through marriage with Sir Christopher  Hatton's nephew, Coke lived in his chambers, working at cases and  writing the books which are still carefully studied by every young man  who wishes to make himself a master of our law. In private they had  perpetual squabbles, and they quarrelled with equal virulence and  indecency before the world. The"]]]
