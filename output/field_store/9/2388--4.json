[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3165"],[0,"Rashi (#10)"],[1,"rre, the scholar Solomon of  Tours, whom Rashi calls his dear friend, his kinsman Eleazar,  and R. Aaron the Elder.  His correspondence on learned questions  was so large that sometimes, as when he was ill, for instance, he  would have his disciples or relatives help him out with it.[22]    About 1070 Rashi founded a school at Troyes, which soon became  the centre [center sic] of instruction in the Talmud for the  whole region.  As we have seen, Gershom trained a number of  disciples who directed schools, each of which pursued a  particular course.  Rashi united these various tendencies, as,  later, his work put an end to the activity of the commentators  of the Talmud.  An explanation is thus afforded of the legend  repeated by Basnage in these words: \"He made a collection of the  difficulties he had heard decided during his travels.  On his  return to Europe he went to all the academies and disputed with  the professors about the questions which they were discussing;  then he threw to the floor a page of his collections, which gave  a solution of the problem, and so ended the controversy, without,  however, mentioning the name of the author of the decision.  It  is alleged that these leaves scattered in thousands of places  were gathered together, and that from them was composed the  commentary on the Talmud.\"  The legend attests Rashi's great  reputation.  While he was still quite young, his renown had  rapidly spread.    When in Lorraine, he had from time to time paid a visit to  Troyes, and so, later, when definitely established in Champagne,  he maintained relations with his masters, especially with Isaac  ha-Levi, whom he visited and with whom he corresponded in the  interim of his visits.  Isaac ha-Levi was no less fond of his  favorite pupil, and he inquired of travellers [travelers sic]  about him.  He addressed Responsa to Rashi on questions of  Talmudic jurisprudence.  In fact, Rashi continued to solicit  advice from his teachers and keep himself informed of everything  concerning schools and Talmudic instruction.  In this way he once  learned that a Talmudic scholar of Rome, R. Kalonymos (ben  Sabbatai, born before 1030) had come after the death of Jacob ben  Yakar to establish himself at Worms, where he died, probably a  martyr's death, during the First Crusade.  Kalonymos, who enjoyed  a great reputation, wrote Talmudic commentaries and liturgical  poems.  His was a personality rare in that period.    Rashi's masters, in turn, often applied to their pupil for  advice, choosing him as arbiter and consulting him with a  deference more fitting toward a colleague than a disciple.  Isaac  ha-Levi wrote the following words, in which one detects real  esteem and admiration underlying epistolary emphasis and the  usual exaggeration of a compliment: \"Blessed be the Lord who  willed that this century should not be orphaned, who has steadied  our tottering generation by eminent teachers, such as my dear and  respected friend, my kinsman R. Solomon.  May Israel boast many  another such as he!\" Equally sincere seems the salutation of a  letter written to Rashi by Isaac ben Judali: \"To him who is  beloved in heaven and honored on earth, who possesses the  treasures of the Law, who knows how to resolve the most subtle  and profound questions, whose knowledge moves mountains and  shatters rocks, etc.\"    After the death of Rashi's teachers (about 1075) his school  'assumed even more importance.  It eclipsed the academies of  Lorraine, and from all the neighboring countries it attracted  pupils, who later went forth and spread the teachings of their  master abroad.  Rashi came to be considered almost the regenerator  of Talmudic studies, and in the following generation Eliezer ben  Xathan said with pious admiration: \"His lips were the seat of  wisdom, and thanks to him the Law, which he examined and  interpreted, has come to life again.\"    In this school, justly renowned as the centre [center sic] of  Jewish science, master and pupil were animated by equal love for  their work.  Entire days were spent there in study, and often,  especially in winter, entire nights as well.  The studies were  regulated by a judicious method.  The teacher began to explain a  treatise of the Talmud on the first of the month, in order that  the students might take their measures accordingly, and not delay  coming until after the treatise had been begun.  The pupils took  notes dictated by the teacher, and thus composed manuscripts  which are still of great value.  In so doing they fixed all the  minutiae of a detailed process of argumentation.  On the other  hand, books were rare, and students poor.  The master himself, in  order to facilitate his task, wrote explanations during the  lesson, and these served as textbooks, which, like the students'  notebooks, became treasure houses for later generations.    Rashi not only imparted knowledge to his pupils, but received  knowledge from them in turn.  He set great store by their  observations.  His grandson Samuel ben Meir once drew his  attention to a certain form of Biblical parallelism, in which the  second hemistich completes the first, as in the following verse  from Psalm xciii:       \"The floods have lifted up, O Lord,      The floods have lifted up their voice.\"    After this, each time Rashi came across a similarly constructed  verse, he would say with mock gravity: \"Here's a verse for my  Samuel.\"    The Jewish student led a pure, regulated existence, with only  wholesome distractions, such as the little celebrations when the  study of a Talmudic treatise had been completed.  His greatest  pleasure he found in the swordplay of mind against mind, in the  love of knowledge and religion.    Rashi did not content himself with giving instruction only to  students under his immediate influence.  He desired that his  teachings should not be lost to men unknown to him and to unborn  generations.  He realized that everything so far accomplished in  the field of Talmudic and even Biblical exegesis was inadequate,  and he therefore undertook the works that were to occupy him the  rest of his life.  His school was, so to speak, the laboratory of  which his Biblical and Talmudic commentaries were the products.  They involved a vast amount of toil, and though death overtook  him before his task was accomplished, he doubtless began the work  early in life.[23] A legend goes that he was forbidden to write  commentaries on the Bible before he was a hundred years old.  Rashi with all his ardor for learning could not curb himself and  postpone his activity for so long a time, and he turned the  prohibition in his own favor by explaining that the sum of the  Hebrew letters forming the word \"hundred\" amounted to forty-six.    Rashi's disciples were in very truth his sons, for no sons were  born to the illustrious rabbi.  But he had three daughters, who  each married a Talmudist, so that Rashi's descendants, no less  than himself, were the bearers of rabbinic learning in France.  Rashi did not limit his association with his pupils to the  school-house, but invited them to enter his family circle.  Indeed, this was the highest honor to which they could aspire.  It has always been the greatest piece of good fortune for a Jew  to marry the daughter of a learned and pious man, and the suitors  most desired by and for young girls were scholars.  In this way  arose veritable dynasties of rabbis, who cherished learning as a  heritage, a family treasure, and the Rashi \"dynasty\" was one of  the greatest and most renowned among them.    Tradition has delighted in representing Rashi's daughters as  highly endowed.  Unfortunately, it seems that the education of  women among the Jews of the middle ages was greatly neglected,  though they were taught the principles of religion and the  ordinances which it was their special duty to fulfil [fulfill  sic].  They possessed the domestic virtues, and above all modesty  and charity.  They helped their husbands in business, thus  enabling them to devote themselves more freely to study, and  though the women themselves lacked learning, they concerned  themselves with the learning of their men-folk, and were eager  to contribute to the support of schools and pupils.  They were  extremely pious, often scrupulously so.  The women in a family of  scholars had sufficient knowledge to be called upon in ritual  questions, as, for instance, Bellette, sister of Isaac ben  Menahem the Great, of Orleans, a contemporary of Rashi, who  appealed to her authority.  Other cases of the same kind are  mentioned, some occurring in Rashi's own family, his  granddaughter Miriam having been asked to adjudicate a doubtful  case.  One of Rashi's daughters, also called Miriam, married  the scholar Judah ben Nathan.  Rachel, another daughter, given  a French epithet, Bellassez,[24] also seems to have been learned.  Her union with a certain Eliezer, or Jocelyn, was unhappy.  Not  so the marriage of the third daughter of Rashi, Jochebed, whose  husband was the scholar Meir, son of Samuel, of Rameru, a little  village near Troyes.  She had four sons, named Samuel, Jacob,  Isaac, and Solomon.  The three first, and in a less degree the  fourth, too, continued in glorious wise the traditions of their  grandfather.  I shall have occasion again to mention them,  their life, and their work.    The renown of his posterity, far from dimming Rashi's brilliance,  only added fresh lustre [luster sic] to the name of him who was  both father and revered master.  Even in his life-time Rashi  could reap the harvest of his efforts, and though death  intervened before his work was completed, he saw at his side  collaborators ready to continue what he had begun.    A marriage among the Jews of France of that epoch must have been  a charming and touching ceremony, to judge from a picturesque  description, given by an author of the fourteenth century, of a  wedding at Mayence, a city in which the community had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31671"],[0,"Plain Talks on Avoided Subjects (#10)"],[1,"book will go about in all classes of society confirming and  strengthening the pure in heart in their purity and enlightening the  ignorant who will joyfully hail the good news; all will join hands in  one popular cry against indecencies and indulgences of an impure nature;  and the vilest man even will be taught to fear and respect the combined  world of chaste female influence. So it must be and eventually will be;  but woman, naturally pure and lovely woman! the greatest part of this  work must be done by you.          CHAPTER VI.    Marriage.    The Husband.      \"And JEHOVAH GOD said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I  will make him a help meet for him. * * * * And JEHOVAH GOD brought the  woman unto the man. And the man said, This is now bone of my bones and  flesh of my flesh. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his  mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one  flesh.\"--Gen. ii. 18, 22-24.    \"The marriage of one man with one woman is therefore designed in our  very creation by Him who made us. The love which brings them together  and binds them together, flows into their minds from the Divine Love,  from the love which has operated hitherto, and which now operates, in  creating and forming a Heaven of human beings.\"    All young men, on arriving at the age of twenty-five, other  circumstances being favorable, should conform to the laws of Divine  order and marry. \"Whom shall we marry? Young ladies now-a-days require  such an outfit and it costs so much to support a wife in the style she  wishes to live, or has been accustomed to, that, to say nothing of the  extra expense of children, we cannot afford to marry.\" This is a wrong  view to take, because pomp, style and show _are not the true objects of  marriage_! The married state is a duty and a great privilege, while its  uses are of the highest possible order physically, mentally and  spiritually. The love which brings the two together and which should  bind them together, requires only a comfortable home of respectable  appearance. Young married people should begin like young married people;  it is more orderly and more conducive to the welfare and true happiness  of each that, as time passes on, they build up their fortunes together,  each helping the other--thus affording new charms that no other course  will or can yield.    In the choice of a wife, a man should especially seek _congeniality_. He  should make the acquaintance of a young lady living and moving in the  same sphere of life as his own, such as is congenial to his tastes; he  should see her in company with other young people and observe how she  treats them; and particularly notice how she acts towards her father  and mother, brothers and sisters: for a good daughter and sister always  makes a good wife. Study closely her character, her mental discipline,  her tastes in reading and her mode of life generally. Above all, note  her disposition as to selfishness, whether she be determined and bent  upon having her own way in everything, or whether she is yielding and  thoughtful of the comfort and happiness of her associates. Remember that  in the married state there must be a mutual yielding to each other,  though not the sinking of the wife's identity, so that the combined life  of the two may become one harmonious whole. Observe what she thinks of  children and get her opinion as to how they should be brought up and  educated. Be sure that she is one who can be loved most tenderly, one  for whom a man can make any sacrifice in reason for her sake--for whom  one can deny himself any comfort, any and every passion, brave any  danger, and conquer every difficulty in his power, to make her life  happy and useful. One quality: Is she strictly virtuous? Is she chastity  itself in thought, word and deed? If you, young man, have been the same,  if you have held yourself in by \"bit and bridle,\" as it were,--then, if  she reciprocates your love, you are at liberty to propose marriage to  her.    Before marriage, a young man takes great pains to make himself  attractive, is very attentive and polite, keeps up a genteel appearance  and is civility itself, that he may woo and win the young lady most  nearly approaching his ideal of feminine perfection, and the one most  nearly suited to his tastes and congeniality. After marriage he feels  that she is his, that she has pledged herself to this effect; and the  law has so decided; she is his, as he is hers, irrevocably. Now, young  man, do you mean to be loyal, to be her real husband until death  dissolves the allegiance? Then let nothing cool your ardor. Be as  watchful as when you were her wooer and even more so. Let nothing induce  you to swerve from your duty, to violate your vow or to betray your  trust. But ever be faithful and true. So may you be accounted worthy of  her choice as a husband and worthy to be enrolled among the respected  and honored fathers in our land. Heavier responsibilities rest upon you  now than before marriage. Your wife must be protected, supported and  cared for in every possible way, and you need to be even more careful to  retain her love than you were to win it. You are under heavy  responsibilities to your relatives and the community in which you live,  that your united lives bear such fruit as will be to all a delight.  Together, in your unity, you form as it were a tree; your united lives  throw out branches and leaves, buds and blossoms, and finally fruit in  its season; and every tree is known by its fruit. Bearing in mind the  high duties to which as a husband and a father you are called, seek not  to live for carnal pleasures. You have struggled manfully with yourself  and the world and have come up to this stage of your life pure and  uncontaminated; and that love which brought you two together, now flows  into your united lives from the Divine Love. Let that love continually  operate through you unitedly in creating new human beings who shall  ultimately serve to swell the grand army of the Angelic hosts in Heaven.    Some well-meaning and otherwise apparently good husbands, but not true,  form habits of staying from their homes during their leisure hours,  particularly in the evenings. They visit club houses, billiard rooms or  other places of amusement, leaving their wives at home. Such absences  distress a wife greatly, though her love often restrains any expression  of disapproval. These habits increase, she suffers more and more, loses  sleep on his account and her health fails. The husband's dissipations  grow upon him--all such desertions are dissipations when they become  habitual--until he loses all relish for the company of his faithful wife  and for the caresses of his young and lovely children, until finally to  stay at home a single evening is a restraint and unhappiness to him.  Where now is the plighted faith! Where now is the tree, its branches and  leaves with their buds and blossoms, and what is the fruit? Where now is  that pure love which he promised when they became united and which  should forever bind them together, and who has almost severed that love?  Has not the little that remains become merely carnal, on his part at  least? Where is that union of mind and communion of soul that lifts one  above sensualism; and without which, sensualism is the only link and  quality left to keep the two together, until death dissolves the union?          CHAPTER VII.    Marriage [continued].    The Wife.      Young ladies, why do you marry? Through infancy, childhood and  adolescence you have been watched over most tenderly and cared for most  lovingly; you have been protected and educated, and have been made as  happy under the paternal roof as circumstances would allow; and this  very book has been written largely on _your_ account. It has been the  custom from time immemorial, as it always will be, for girls to complete  their education and then to marry. But alas! how very few seem to  realize what married life really is and what will be expected in it;  what its duties and responsibilities are, or even what leads to  marriage. But to the question why do you even think of getting married?  The answer is, \"Because it is inherent in the mind of every true female  character. It was ordained of God in her creation, spiritually,  mentally, and physically--from her inmost being to her complete  ultimation. It was in the very design of her creation that she should  love and be loved, that she should be sought after by the male sex, and  that she should become a wife and mother.\"    First, let us understand what \"marriage\" signifies. The word itself  has the same meaning as the Latin word _conjugium_ and represents  a conjunction or union together. Carried out to its higher or more  interior meaning, marriage signifies the joining of good and truth--the  \"good\" being represented by the woman and \"truth\" being represented by  the man. Hence it denotes the spiritual conjunction of minds, and thence  of bodies, in contradistinction to the merely natural conjunction or  joining together of bodies only. So, to secure a real marriage, there  must be a spiritual conjunction of minds; and the conjunction of bodies  in wedlock is simply the ultimation, or manifestation of spiritual  principles in marriage.    The true reason why girls marry is because they have an innate principle  of love for the male sex; and this love is drawn from the Lord above.  Consequently, it is pure, chaste, and when fully developed, very  powerful. In connection with this principle comes the desire to be  sought after and loved by a man of congenial character for whose dear  sake a woman is induced to leave father and mother, brothers and  sisters, to become the wife of him whom she can claim as her own dear  husband. This Heaven-born principle is what leads and induces the female  to assent to the marriage relation. For her own sake, for his sake as  well as for the sake of all parties"]]]
