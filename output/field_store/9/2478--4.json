A  relation may have three terms, or four, or any number. Relations of two  terms, being the simplest, have received more attention than the others,  and have generally been alone considered by philosophers, both those who  accepted and those who denied the reality of relations. But other  relations have their importance, and are indispensable in the solution  of certain problems. Jealousy, for example, is a relation between three  people. Professor Royce mentions the relation \"giving\": when A gives B  to C, that is a relation of three terms.[15] When a man says to his  wife: \"My dear, I wish you could induce Angelina to accept Edwin,\" his  wish constitutes a relation between four people, himself, his wife,  Angelina, and Edwin. Thus such relations are by no means recondite or  rare. But in order to explain exactly how they differ from relations of  two terms, we must embark upon a classification of the logical forms of  facts, which is the first business of logic, and the business in which  the traditional logic has been most deficient.      [15] _Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences_, vol. i. p. 97.    The existing world consists of many things with many qualities and  relations. A complete description of the existing world would require  not only a catalogue of the things, but also a mention of all their  qualities and relations. We should have to know not only this, that, and  the other thing, but also which was red, which yellow, which was earlier  than which, which was between which two others, and so on. When I speak  of a \"fact,\" I do not mean one of the simple things in the world; I mean  that a certain thing has a certain quality, or that certain things have  a certain relation. Thus, for example, I should not call Napoleon a  fact, but I should call it a fact that he was ambitious, or that he  married Josephine. Now a fact, in this sense, is never simple, but  always has two or more constituents. When it simply assigns a quality to  a thing, it has only two constituents, the thing and the quality. When  it consists of a relation between two things, it has three constituents,  the things and the relation. When it consists of a relation between  three things, it has four constituents, and so on. The constituents of  facts, in the sense in which we are using the word \"fact,\" are not other  facts, but are things and qualities or relations. When we say that there  are relations of more than two terms, we mean that there are single  facts consisting of a single relation and more than two things. I do not  mean that one relation of two terms may hold between A and B, and also  between A and C, as, for example, a man is the son of his father and  also the son of his mother. This constitutes two distinct facts: if we  choose to treat it as one fact, it is a fact which has facts for its  constituents. But the facts I am speaking of have no facts among their  constituents, but only things and relations. For example, when A is  jealous of B on account of C, there is only one fact, involving three  people; there are not two instances of jealousy, but only one. It is in  such cases that I speak of a relation of three terms, where the simplest  possible fact in which the relation occurs is one involving three things  in addition to the relation. And the same applies to relations of four  terms or five or any other number. All such relations must be admitted  in our inventory of the logical forms of facts: two facts involving the  same number of things have the same form, and two which involve  different numbers of things have different forms.    Given any fact, there is an assertion which expresses the fact. The fact  itself is objective, and independent of our thought or opinion about it;  but the assertion is something which involves thought, and may be either  true or false. An assertion may be positive or negative: we may assert  that Charles I. was executed, or that he did _not_ die in his bed. A  negative assertion may be said to be a _denial_. Given a form of words  which must be either true or false, such as \"Charles I. died in his  bed,\" we may either assert or deny this form of words: in the one case  we have a positive assertion, in the other a negative one. A form of  words which must be either true or false I shall call a _proposition_.  Thus a proposition is the same as what may be significantly asserted or  denied. A proposition which expresses what we have called a fact, _i.e._  which, when asserted, asserts that a certain thing has a certain  quality, or that certain things have a certain relation, will be called  an atomic proposition, because, as we shall see immediately, there are  other propositions into which atomic propositions enter in a way  analogous to that in which atoms enter into molecules. Atomic  propositions, although, like facts, they may have any one of an infinite  number of forms, are only one kind of propositions. All other kinds are  more complicated. In order to preserve the parallelism in language as  regards facts and propositions, we shall give the name \"atomic facts\" to  the facts we have hitherto been considering. Thus atomic facts are what  determine whether atomic propositions are to be asserted or denied.    Whether an atomic proposition, such as \"this is red,\" or \"this is before  that,\" is to be asserted or denied can only be known empirically.  Perhaps one atomic fact may sometimes be capable of being inferred from  another, though this seems very doubtful; but in any case it cannot be  inferred from premisses no one of which is an atomic fact. It follows  that, if atomic facts are to be known at all, some at least must be  known without inference. The atomic facts which we come to know in this  way are the facts of sense-perception; at any rate, the facts of  sense-perception are those which we most obviously and certainly come to  know in this way. If we knew all atomic facts, and also knew that there  were none except those we knew, we should, theoretically, be able to  infer all truths of whatever form.[16] Thus logic would then supply us  with the whole of the apparatus required. But in the first acquisition  of knowledge concerning atomic facts, logic is useless. In pure logic,  no atomic fact is ever mentioned: we confine ourselves wholly to forms,  without asking ourselves what objects can fill the forms. Thus pure  logic is independent of atomic facts; but conversely, they are, in a  sense, independent of logic. Pure logic and atomic facts are the two  poles, the wholly _a priori_ and the wholly empirical. But between the  two lies a vast intermediate region, which we must now briefly explore.      [16] This perhaps requires modification in order to include such facts    as beliefs and wishes, since such facts apparently contain    propositions as components. Such facts, though not strictly atomic,    must be supposed included if the statement in the text is to be true.    \"Molecular\" propositions are such as contain conjunctions--_if_, _or_,  _and_, _unless_, etc.--and such words are the marks of a molecular  proposition. Consider such an assertion as, \"If it rains, I shall bring  my umbrella.\" This assertion is just as capable of truth or falsehood as  the assertion of an atomic proposition, but it is obvious that either  the corresponding fact, or the nature of the correspondence with fact,  must be quite different from what it is in the case of an atomic  proposition. Whether it rains, and whether I bring my umbrella, are each  severally matters of atomic fact, ascertainable by observation. But the  connection of the two involved in saying that _if_ the one happens,  _then_ the other will happen, is something radically different from  either of the two separately. It does not require for its truth that it  should actually rain, or that I should actually bring my umbrella; even  if the weather is cloudless, it may still be true that I should have  brought my umbrella if the weather had been different. Thus we have here  a connection of two propositions, which does not depend upon whether  they are to be asserted or denied, but only upon the second being  inferable from the first. Such propositions, therefore, have a form  which is different from that of any atomic proposition.    Such propositions are important to logic, because all inference depends  upon them. If I have told you that if it rains I shall bring my  umbrella, and if you see that there is a steady downpour, you can infer  that I shall bring my umbrella. There can be no inference except where  propositions are connected in some such way, so that from the truth or  falsehood of the one something follows as to the truth or falsehood of  the other. It seems to be the case that we can sometimes know molecular  propositions, as in the above instance of the umbrella, when we do not  know whether the component atomic propositions are true or false. The  _practical_ utility of inference rests upon this fact.    The next kind of propositions we have to consider are _general_  propositions, such as \"all men are mortal,\" \"all equilateral triangles  are equiangular.\" And with these belong propositions in which the word  \"some\" occurs, such as \"some men are philosophers\" or \"some philosophers  are not wise.\" These are the denials of general propositions, namely (in  the above instances), of \"all men are non-philosophers\" and \"all  philosophers are wise.\" We will call propositions containing the word  \"some\" _negative_ general propositions, and those containing the word  \"all\" _positive_ general propositions. These propositions, it will be  seen, begin to have the appearance of the propositions in logical  text-books. But their peculiarity and complexity are not known to the  text-books, and the problems which they raise are only discussed in the  most superficial manner.    When we were discussing atomic facts, we saw that we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37122"],[0,"Hunting in Many Lands: The Book of the Boone and Crockett Club (#10)"],[1," spikes in shreds with his  tough fingers and knotted the fragments into a strong, pliable cord.    In two days we were again in the Trinidad Valley, and in two days  more--one of them passed in facing a cold, driving storm, of great  violence--we had reached our old friend, Don Manuel Murillo, at El Rayo.  Here we lay over a day to rest the animals, and Don Manuel again played  the part of a good angel in letting us have some hay.    I tried a shot at a duck on a little pond. The shot was a costly  success. The duck died, but I had to wade for his remains through many  yards of frozen mud and dirty water. The duck, though lean, was tender.  My last hunt was for deer at El Rayo, with a boy of Don Manuel's for  guide. Toward noon I saw two deer and shot them. I do not at present  know just how to class them. The tail is that of the ordinary mule-deer,  or blacktail, of Colorado and Montana, but there is no white patch on  the rump.    The most of the deer in Lower, as well as in Southern, California have  little white on their rumps, as in these specimens, but the upper  surface of the tail is generally dark. The majority of the animals also  are smaller than the typical mule-deer of our Northern States, but  whether the differences between the two are great enough and constant  enough to form a defined variety, some more competent naturalist must  decide. Pending authoritative decision, I will submit, as a working  theory of a purely amateur kind, this suggestion: that the Mexicans are  right in saying that the northern zone of their country contains two  varieties of deer--one a large animal, called \"buro,\" identical with our  Northern mule-deer; the other called \"venado,\" a mule-deer too, but only  a cousin of the \"buro,\" much smaller, and with the white parts of the  mask, throat, rump and tail either absent or much diminished in extent.    Our journey home was accomplished in the worst weather. Snow, cold rain,  gales of surprising fury, made life a struggle; but we jumped at every  chance for progress, and finally crossed the line twenty-five days after  we had left it--tired, ragged, dirty, but with our mules alive and our  hearts contented.    Our experience of the peninsula indicated that there were few  inhabitants of any kind, brute or human. We saw hardly a dozen rabbits  on the trip. There were some quail and many ducks, but the latter were  visitors only. Deer were very scarce, and there were but a few half-wild  cattle visible.    As for human beings, there was not an inhabited house on our road from  Alvarez Place, in the Trinidad Valley, to El Rayo, a distance of  fifty-five miles; nor from El Rayo to Juarez, twenty-five miles more.  Indeed, except for the few hovels at Tecate, the houses for the rest of  the way were hardly more numerous. And yet we had a strong impression  that the country had nearly all the population it could support. Given a  moderately dry year, and the part of Lower California which we visited  can be thought fit only for bogus land companies and goose-egg mines;  or, yes, it might be an ideal spot for a health resort or a penal  colony.    _George H. Gould._          A Canadian Moose Hunt      In October, 1893, I made an extended trip with my brother into the  country around the head waters of the Ottawa. Our original plan, to push  northward toward the \"Height of Land\" after caribou, was frustrated by  high winds, which made travel on the large lakes slow and dangerous. The  crossing of a ten-mile lake, which could be accomplished in a morning if  calm, would consume several days with a high wind blowing, necessitating  a tedious coasting on the windward shore. After much delay from this  cause and from heavy rains, which made hunting difficult in the extreme,  we at length abandoned the hope of caribou on this trip, and turned  southward from Birch Lake into Lake Kwingwishe--the Indian name for meat  bird. This was about the northern limit of moose, although a few are  found beyond it.    Our repeated failures to see this great deer would not form interesting  reading, although, if recorded, they would, no doubt, bring to the  mind of many a moose hunter memories of times when the hunt was hard and  the result--a blank. It is my purpose in this article to merely sketch  one or two instances of this sort, which, in contrast to days of  unrewarded watching, were red-lettered with excitement. I only give the  episodes because too often we relate our victories alone, and missed  shots and barren tramps are consigned to ill-merited oblivion, however  real they were.    [Illustration: A MOOSE OF THE UPPER OTTAWA.]    After hunting the country around Lake Kwingwishe, we at length camped on  a small pond near the east shore. Here we watched and called every night  and morning; then we visited neighboring swamps and ponds, carrying a  canoe through the forest by compass. It was always the same--wet and  hungry, tired out with tramping through tamarack swamps, we would call  half the night, sometimes startled with false alarms from hoot owl or  loon, and then lie down in a rain-soaked tent without a fire, for smoke  always scares a moose. The first streaks of dawn came, and again we were  up and anxiously watching the shore for the appearance of the monster we  were after. There were his tracks a few hours old but we could never  catch him making them. It was too early in the season to trail them  down, as the bulls were traveling continuously in impenetrable swamps,  and our best chance was to run across them on the waterways.    One morning, on a pond we had named \"Little Trout Pond,\" because it  looked as though it should have trout in it, but did not; we awoke,  after some specially exhausting and disappointing \"back pond\"  expeditions, and found Chabot, one of our two Indian guides, gone. Late  in the afternoon he returned. He had been seeing the country, and had  found a swamp about three miles off full of fresh tracks, \"so big  moose,\" and he described tracks such as must have belonged to the Irish  elk. Soon after sunrise on the following day we were there. Cold lunch,  no dinner and lots of beautiful fresh tracks, one the largest I ever  saw.    We watched motionless all day, saw the sun cross the zenith and sink out  of sight, saw the twilight fade away and the moon come up. About  midnight we went back to camp, through the woods. Night travel in a  forest that you can scarcely get through in the daytime is beyond  description.    \"So good swamp,\" said Chabot sadly that night as he crawled into his  tent.    The next day we pitched a rough camp on a hogback between two barren  plains, about five miles from our main camp. It rained hard as soon as  we got the tent up, and we watched a runway at the foot of the hill  until dark and then turned in.    The next morning it rained so heavily that we lay in our tent, four of  us, until about 11 A. M., when it slacked up a little. My diary says,  \"No fire and little breakfast.\" Before this \"little breakfast\" was  finished we heard a moose call close by. Seizing our rifles, we started  with Chabot to stalk him. The brevity of a diary is sometimes eloquent.  Mine says, \"Walked from 12 M. to 4.30 P. M. through the bush. Didn't  hear that moose again.\"    The latter hour found us back in camp to get breakfast, when our other  guide, Jocko, who had gone to the main camp for food, came back in great  excitement, having found some fresh signs close at hand. Breakfast was  dropped and again we started. We got back just after dark from that trip  and ate--for the first time that day--some cold partridge and pork.    This was a fair sample of our hunting day, but did not equal the  following one. It rained all that night, and the tent, not having been  properly stretched, leaked. We were awakened by the crackling of a fire  the guides had made. It was direct disobedience of orders, and contrary  to the most elementary rules of moose hunting; but, cold and faint for  want of food, we yielded to the innate perversity of the Indian. We made  a wild-eyed, starved group, warming our fingers around the little blaze  as it snapped up through the still, wet morning air. The teapot was just  beginning to boil, the pork was just sizzling, when we sprang to our  feet. A crash of antlers, as though two bulls were fighting, sounded not  a hundred yards away. The noise was perfectly clear, having a metallic  ring to it, and was caused by moose horns striking a hard substance.    Again. Without a word, we seized our rifles, and left our breakfast and  fire, and I never saw that spot afterward. Again came the sound, still  distinct, but further off, this time like a birch canoe dragged through  alders. The animal had been on the runway which crossed at the foot of  the hill we were camped on when he scented the fresh-lit fire. Well, to  make a long story short, we followed that trail three weary hours of  running and creeping through frightful swamps and thickets, hearing  every few minutes the sound just ahead of us, but with never a sight of  the game. His huge tracks, which we crossed now and again, showed he was  not even trotting. Nearly exhausted, we kept following the sound  directly, and so cutting across and gaining on him. Once he seemed just  ahead, and we expected to see him each second; but we had to pay for the  luxury of that fire, as for other good things in life, so we never saw a  hair of him. When, at last, completely used up, we burst out on a lake  and saw the muddy tracks and the water still \"riled up\" where he had  crossed, Jocko swore he heard him crash up the opposite bank; but we  were at the end of our strength and could go no further. A man must eat  sometimes, even on a moose hunt.    Now comes the really tragical part of this episode; our canoe was not  twenty feet from where this perverse animal had entered the water, and  we were on the little pond where our permanent camp stood. Still we felt  encouraged, for, as"]]]
