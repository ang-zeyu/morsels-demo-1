Economic considerations have played second fiddle to  political and military upheavals during two decades of war,  including the nearly 10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended  15 February 1989). During that conflict one-third of the population  fled the country, with Pakistan and Iran sheltering a combined peak  of more than 6 million refugees. In early 2000, 2 million Afghan  refugees remained in Pakistan and about 1.4 million in Iran. Gross  domestic product has fallen substantially over the past 20 years  because of the loss of labor and capital and the disruption of trade  and transport; severe drought added to the nation's difficulties in  1998-2000. The majority of the population continues to suffer from  insufficient food, clothing, housing, and medical care. Inflation  remains a serious problem throughout the country. International aid  can deal with only a fraction of the humanitarian problem, let alone  promote economic development. In 1999-2000, internal civil strife  continued, hampering both domestic economic policies and  international aid efforts. Numerical data are likely to be either  unavailable or unreliable. Afghanistan was by far the largest  producer of opium poppies in 2000, and narcotics trafficking is a  major source of revenue.    GDP: purchasing power parity - $21 billion (2000 est.)

Administration is    carried out through consultative member meetings - the 18th    Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting was in Japan in April 1993.    Currently, there are 42 treaty member nations: 26 consultative and    16 acceding. Consultative (voting) members include the seven nations    that claim portions of Antarctica as national territory (some claims    overlap) and 19 nonclaimant nations. The US and some other nations    that have made no claims have reserved the right to do so. The US    does not recognize the claims of others. The year in parentheses    indicates when an acceding nation was voted to full consultative    (voting) status, while no date indicates the country was an original    1959 treaty signatory. Claimant nations are - Argentina, Australia,    Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and the UK. Nonclaimant    consultative nations are - Belgium, Brazil (1983), China (1985),    Ecuador (1990), Finland (1989), Germany (1981), India (1983), Italy    (1987), Japan, South Korea (1989), Netherlands (1990), Peru (1989),    Poland (1977), South Africa, Spain (1988), Sweden (1988), Uruguay    (1985), the US, and Russia.

Some US laws directly apply to    Antarctica. For example, the Antarctic Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C.    section 2401 et seq., provides civil and criminal penalties for the    following activities, unless authorized by regulation of statute:    The taking of native mammals or birds; the introduction of    nonindigenous plants and animals; entry into specially protected or    scientific areas; the discharge or disposal of pollutants; and the    importation into the US of certain items from Antarctica. Violation    of the Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to $10,000    in fines and 1 year in prison. The Departments of Treasury,    Commerce, Transportation, and Interior share enforcement    responsibilities. Public Law 95-541, the US Antarctic Conservation    Act of 1978, requires expeditions from the US to Antarctica to    notify, in advance, the Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs, Room    5801, Department of State, Washington, DC 20520, which reports such    plans to other nations as required by the Antarctic Treaty.
