It is with such warmth of feeling  that I cherished Lucius Paulus, Marcus Cato, Galus Gallus, Publius  Nasica, Tiberius Gracchus, my dear Scipio's father-in-law. It shines  with even greater warmth when men are of the same age, as in the case of  Scipio and Lucius Furius, Publius Rupilius, Spurius Mummius, and myself.  _En revanche_, in my old age I find comfort in the affection of young  men, as in the case of yourselves and Quintus Tubero: nay more, I  delight in the intimacy of such a very young man as Publius Rutilius and  Aulus Verginius. And since the law of our nature and of our life is that  a new generation is for ever springing up, the most desirable thing is  that along with your contemporaries, with whom you started in the  race, you may also teach what is to us the goal. But in view of  the instability and perishableness of mortal things, we should be  continually on the look-out for some to love and by whom to be loved;  for if we lose affection and kindliness from our life, we lose all that  gives it charm. For me, indeed, though torn away by a sudden stroke,  Scipio still lives and ever wilt live. For it was the virtue of the man  that I loved, and that has not suffered death. And it is not my eyes  only, because I had all my life a personal experience of it, that never  lose sight of it: it will shine to posterity also with undimmed glory.  No one will ever cherish a nobler ambition or a loftier hope without  thinking his memory and his image the best to put before his eyes. I  declare that of all the blessings which either fortune or nature has  bestowed upon me I know none to compare with Scipio's friendship. In  it I found sympathy in public, counsel in private business; in it too a  means of spending my leisure with unalloyed delight. Never, to the best  of my knowledge, did I offend him even in the most trivial point; never  did I hear a word from him I could have wished unsaid. We had one house,  one table, one style of living; and not only were we together on foreign  service, but in our tours also and country sojourns. Why speak of  our eagerness to be ever gaining some knowledge, to be ever learning  something, on which we spent all our leisure hours far from the gaze of  the world? If the recollection and memory of these things had perished  with the man, I could not possibly have endured the regret for one so  closely united with me in life and affection. But these things have not  perished; they are rather fed and strengthened by reflexion and memory.  Even supposing me to have been entirely bereft of them, still my time  of life of itself brings me no small consolation: for I cannot have much  longer now to bear this regret; and everything that is brief ought to be  endurable, however severe.    This is all I had to say on friendship. One piece of advice on parting.  Make up your minds to this. Virtue (without which friendship is  impossible) is first; but next to it, and to it alone, the greatest of  all things is Friendship.          ON OLD AGE           1. And should my service, Titus, ease the weight       Of care that wrings your heart, and draw the sting       Which rankles there, what guerdon shall there be?    FOR I may address you, Atticus, in the lines in which Flamininus was  addressed by the man,         who, poor in wealth, was rich in honour's gold,    though I am well assured that you are not, as Flamininus was,         kept on the rack of care by night and day.    For I know how well ordered and equable your mind is, and am fully aware  that it was not a surname alone which you brought home with you from  Athens, but its culture and good sense. And yet I have an idea that you  are at times stirred to the heart by the same circumstances as myself.  To console you for these is a more serious matter, and must be put off  to another time. For the present I have resolved to dedicate to you an  essay on Old Age. For from the burden of impending or at least advancing  age, common to us both, I would do something to relieve us both though  as to yourself I am fully aware that you support and will support it,  as you do everything else, with calmness and philosophy. But directly I  resolved to write on old age, you at once occurred to me as deserving  a gift of which both of us might take advantage. To myself, indeed, the  composition of this book has been so delightful, that it has not only  wiped away all the disagreeables of old age, but has even made it  luxurious and delightful too. Never, therefore, can philosophy be  praised as highly as it deserves considering that its faithful disciple  is able to spend every period of his life with unruffled feelings.  However, on other subjects I have spoken at large, and shall often speak  again: this book which I herewith send you is on Old Age. I have put the  whole discourse not, as Alisto of Cos did, in the mouth of Tithonus--for  a mere fable would have lacked conviction--but in that of Marcus Cato  when he was an old man, to give my essay greater weight. I represent  Laelius and Scipio at his house expressing surprise at his carrying  his years so lightly, and Cato answering them. If he shall seem to shew  somewhat more learning in this discourse than he generally did in his  own books, put it down to the Greek literature of which it is known that  he became an eager student in his old age. But what need of more? Cato's  own words will at once explain all I feel about old age.      M. Cato. Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus (the younger). Gaius  Laelius.    2. _Scipio_. Many a time have I in conversation with my friend Gaius  Laelius here expressed my admiration, Marcus Cato, of the eminent,  nay perfect, wisdom displayed by you indeed at all points, but above  everything because I have noticed that old age never seemed a burden to  you, while to most old men it is so hateful that they declare themselves  under a weight heavier than Aetna.    _Cato_. Your admiration is easily excited, it seems, my dear Scipio  and Laelius. Men, of course, who have no resources in themselves for  securing a good and happy life find every age burdensome. But those who  look for all happiness from within can never think anything bad which  nature makes inevitable. In that category before anything else comes  old age, to which all wish to attain, and at which all grumble when  attained. Such is Folly's inconsistency and unreasonableness! They say  that it is stealing upon them faster than they expected. In the first  place, who compelled them to hug an illusion? For in what respect did  old age steal upon manhood faster than manhood upon childhood? In the  next place, in what way would old age have been less disagreeable to  them if they were in their eight-hundredth year than in their eightieth?  For their past, however long, when once it was past, would have no  consolation for a stupid old age. Wherefore, if it is your wont to  admire my wisdom--and I would that it were worthy of your good opinion  and of my own surname of Sapiens--it really consists in the fact that I  follow Nature, the best of guides, as I would a god, and am loyal to  her commands. It is not likely, if she has written the rest of the play  well, that she has been careless about the last act like some idle poet.  But after all some \"last\" was inevitable, just as to the berries of a  tree and the fruits of the earth there comes in the fulness of time a  period of decay and fall. A wise man will not make a grievance of this.  To rebel against nature--is not that to fight like the giants with the  gods?    _Laelius_. And yet, Cato, you will do us a very great favour (I venture  to speak for Scipio as for myself) if--since we all hope, or at least  wish, to become old men--you would allow us to learn from you in good  time before it arrives, by what methods we may most easily acquire the  strength to support the burden of advancing age.    _Cato_. I will do so without doubt, Laelius, especially if, as you say,  it will be agreeable to you both.    _Laelius_ We do wish very much, Cato, if it is no trouble to you, to  be allowed to see the nature of the bourne which you have reached after  completing a long journey, as it were, upon which we too are bound to  embark.    3. _Cato_. I will do the best I can, Laelius. It has often been my  fortune to bear the complaints of my contemporaries--like will to like,  you know, according to the old proverb--complaints to which men like C.  Salinator and Sp. Albinus, who were of consular rank and about my time,  used to give vent. They were, first, that they had lost the pleasures of  the senses, without which they did not regard life as life at all; and,  secondly, that they were neglected by those from whom they had been used  to receive attentions. Such men appear to me to lay the blame on the  wrong thing. For if it had been the fault of old age, then these same  misfortunes would have befallen me and all other men of advanced years.  But I have known many of them who never said a word of complaint against  old age; for they were only too glad to be freed from the bondage of  passion, and were not at all looked down upon by their friends. The fact  is that the blame for all complaints of that kind is to be charged  to character, not to a particular time of life. For old men who are  reasonable and neither cross-grained nor churlish find old age tolerable  enough: whereas unreason and churlishness cause uneasiness at every time  of life.    _Laelius_ It is as you say, Cato. But perhaps some one may suggest that  it is your large means, wealth, and high position that make you think  old age tolerable: whereas such good fortune only falls to few.    _Cato_. There is something in that, Laelius, but by no means all. For  instance, the story is told of the answer of Themistocles in a wrangle  with a certain Seriphian, who asserted"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28198"],[0,"A Budget of Christmas Tales (#10)"],[1,"at the work upon the table, and praised the industry and speed  of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls. They would be done long before Sunday,  he said.    \"Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?\" said his wife.    \"Yes, my dear,\" returned Bob. \"I wish you could have gone. It would  have done you good to see how green a place it is. But you'll see it  often. I promised him that I would walk there on a Sunday. My little,  little child!\" cried Bob. \"My little child!\"    He broke down all at once. He couldn't help it. If he could have helped  it, he and his child would have been farther apart perhaps than they  were.    \"Spectre,\" said Scrooge, \"something informs me that our parting moment  is at hand. I know it, but I know not how. Tell me what man that was  whom we saw lying dead?\"    The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come conveyed him as before into the  resorts of business men, but showed him not himself. Indeed, the Spirit  did not stay for anything, but went straight on, as to the end just now  desired, until besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment.    \"This court,\" said Scrooge, \"through which we hurry now, is where my  place of occupation is, and has been for a length of time. I see the  house. Let me behold what I shall be, in days to come.\"    The Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere.    \"The house is yonder\" Scrooge exclaimed. \"Why do you point away?\"    The inexorable finger underwent no change.    Scrooge hastened to the window of his office, and looked in. It was an  office still, but not his. The furniture was not the same, and the  figure in the chair was not himself. The Phantom pointed as before.    He joined it once again, and wondering why and whither he had gone,  accompanied it until they reached an iron gate. He paused to look round  before entering.    A churchyard. Here, then, the wretched man whose name he had now to  learn, lay underneath the ground. It was a worthy place. Walled in by  houses; overrun by grass and weeds, the growth of vegetation's death,  not life; choked up with too much burying; fat with repleted appetite. A  worthy place!    The Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to one. He advanced  toward it trembling. The Phantom was exactly as it had been, but he  dreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape.    \"Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,\" said Scrooge,  \"answer me one question. Are these the shadows of the things that will  be, or are they shadows of the things that may be, only?\"    Still the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood.    \"Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if persevered in,  they must lead,\" said Scrooge, \"But if the courses be departed from, the  ends will change. Say it is thus with what you show me!\"    The Spirit was immovable as ever.    Scrooge crept toward it, trembling as he went; and following the finger,  read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name, EBENEZER  SCROOGE.    \"Am _I_ that man who lay upon the bed?\" he cried, upon his knees.    The finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.    \"No, Spirit! Oh, no, no!\"    The finger still was there.    Holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed, he saw  an alteration in the Phantom's hood and dress. It shrunk, collapsed, and  dwindled down into a bedpost.      STAVE FIVE.    THE END OF IT.      Yes! and the bedpost was his own. The bed was his own, and the room was  his own. Best and happiest of all, the time before him was his own, to  make amends in!    He was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions, that his  broken voice would scarcely answer to his call. He had been sobbing  violently in his conflict with the Spirit, and his face was wet with  tears.    \"They are not torn down,\" cried Scrooge, folding one of his bed curtains  in his arms, \"they are not torn down, rings and all. They are here--I am  here--the shadows of the things that would have been, may be dispelled.  They will be. I know they will!\"    He had frisked into the sitting-room, and was now standing there:  perfectly winded.    \"There's the saucepan that the gruel was in!\" cried Scrooge, starting  off again, and going round the fire-place. \"There's the door by which  the Ghost of Jacob Marley entered! There's the corner where the Ghost of  Christmas Present sat! There's the window where I saw the wandering  Spirits! It's all right, it's all true, it all happened. Ha, ha, ha!\"    Really, for a man who had been out of practice for so many years, it was  a splendid laugh, a most illustrious laugh. The father of a long, long  line of brilliant laughs!    \"I don't know what day of the month it is,\" said Scrooge. \"I don't know  how long I have been among the Spirits. I don't know anything. I'm quite  a baby. Never mind. I don't care. I'd rather be a baby. Hallo! Whoop!  Hallo here!\"    He was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the  lustiest peals he had ever heard. Clash, clash, hammer; ding, dong,  bell. Bell, dong, ding; hammer, clang, clash! Oh, glorious, glorious!    Running to the window, he opened it and put out his head.    \"What's to-day?\" cried Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in Sunday  clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him.    \"Eh?\" returned the boy, with all his might of wonder.    \"What's to-day, my fine fellow?\" said Scrooge.    \"To-day!\" replied the boy. \"Why, CHRISTMAS DAY.\"    \"It's Christmas Day!\" said Scrooge to himself. \"I haven't missed it. The  Spirits have done it all in one night. Hallo, my fine fellow!\"    \"Hallo!\" returned the boy.    \"Do you know the Poulterer's, in the next street but one, at the  corner?\" Scrooge inquired.    \"I should hope I did,\" replied the lad.    \"An intelligent boy!\" said Scrooge. \"A remarkable boy! Do you know  whether they've sold the prize turkey that was hanging up there?\"    \"It's hanging there now,\" replied the boy.    \"Is it?\" said Scrooge. \"Go and buy it.\"    \"Walk-ER!\" exclaimed the boy.    \"No, no,\" said Scrooge, \"I am in earnest. Go and buy it, and tell 'em to  bring it here, that I may give them the directions where to take it.  Come back with the man, and I'll give you a shilling.\"    The boy was off like a shot.    \"I'll send it to Bob Cratchit's,\" whispered Scrooge, rubbing his hands,  and splitting with a laugh. \"He shan't know who sends it. It's twice the  size of Tiny Tim.\"    The hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady one; but write  it he did, somehow, and went down-stairs to open the street door, ready  for the coming of the poulterer's man.    The chuckle with which he paid for the Turkey, and the chuckle with  which he recompensed the boy, were only to be exceeded by the chuckle  with which he sat down breathless in his chair again, and chuckled till  he cried.    He dressed himself \"all in his best,\" and got out into the streets. The  people were by this time pouring forth, as he had seen them with the  Ghost of Christmas Present; and walking with his hands behind him,  Scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile. He looked so  irresistibly pleasant, in a word, that three or four good-humored  fellows said \"Good morning, sir! A Merry Christmas to you!\" And Scrooge  said often afterward, that of all the blithe sounds he ever heard, those  were the blithest in his ears.    He had not gone far, when coming on toward him he beheld the portly  gentleman, who had walked into his counting-house the day before, and  said \"Scrooge and Marley's, I believe?\" It sent a pang across his heart  to think how this old gentleman would look upon him when they met; but  he knew what path lay straight before him, and he took it.    \"My dear sir,\" said Scrooge, quickening his pace, and taking the old  gentleman by both his hands, \"how do you do? I hope you succeeded  yesterday. It was very kind of you. A Merry Christmas to you, sir!\"    \"Mr. Scrooge?\"    \"Yes,\" said Scrooge. \"That is my name, and I fear it may not be pleasant  to you. Allow me to ask your pardon. And will you have the  goodness\"--here Scrooge whispered in his ear.    \"Lord bless me!\" cried the gentleman, as if his breath were taken away.  \"My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you serious?\"    \"If you please,\" said Scrooge. \"Not a farthing less. A great many back  payments are included in it, I assure you. Will you do me that favor?\"    \"My dear sir,\" said the other, shaking hands with him, \"I don't know  what to say to such munifi--\"    \"Don't say anything, please,\" retorted Scrooge. \"Come and see me. Will  you come and see me?\"    \"I will!\" cried the old gentleman. And it was clear he meant to do it.    \"Thank'ee,\" said Scrooge. \"I am much obliged to you. I thank you fifty  times. Bless you!\"    He went to church, and walked about the streets and watched the people  hurrying to and fro, and patted the children on the head, and looked  down into the kitchens of houses, and up to the windows; and found  everything could yield him pleasure. He had never dreamed that any  walk--that any thing--could give him so much happiness. In the  afternoon, he turned his steps toward his nephew's house.    He passed the door a dozen times, before he had the courage to go up and  knock. But he made a dash, and did it.    \"Is your master at home, my dear?\" said Scrooge to the girl. Nice girl!  Very.    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Where is he?\" said Scrooge.    \"He's in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress. I'll show you  up-stairs, if you please.\"    \"Thank'ee. He knows me,\" said Scrooge, with his hand already on the  dining-room lock. \"I'll go in here, my dear.\"    He turned it gently, and sidled his face in, round the door. They were  looking at the table (which was spread out in great array); for these  young housekeepers are always nervous on such points, and like to see  that everything is right.    \"Fred!\" said Scrooge.    \"Why, bless my soul!\" cried Fred, \"who's that?\"    \"It's I. Your Uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner. Will you let me in,  Fred?\"    Let"]]]
