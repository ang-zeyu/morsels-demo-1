For the sleeve:    1. Fasten wool where you started the underarm chain, make the required  number of stars (not widening) across shoulder, and 9 stars on the chain  under the arm.    2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Same as 1st row, making star over star  of previous row, and joining underneath the arm.    12. With color, work the cuff in star-stitch, only omit taking the  stitch under the back loop of star in last row, and take a loop through  each of 2 eyes of stars instead, thus drawing in the sleeve, and making  only 12 stars in the round.    13. With the color, make star in star.    14. Using white wool, make 2 trebles in eye of each star.    15, 16, 17. Same as 28th, 29th and 30th rows of border.    This makes a dainty, soft little garment. If one likes, treble stitch  may be alternated with star-stitch, on the return rows; that is, after  making a row of stars, instead of breaking the wool, turn, chain 3, and  make trebles across, or the trebles may be crossed to give a more fancy  effect, making a treble in 2d stitch, then a treble back in preceding  stitch.    Run ribbon matching the colored wool, or cord and tassels made of both  white and color, in the spaces around the neck.          Girl's Jacket      [Illustration: Girl's jacket]    Materials required are 12 skeins of gray Germantown yarn and 1 skein of  blue. Make a chain of 52 stitches.    1. A double in 8th stitch of chain, * chain 3, miss 3, 1 double in next;  repeat from * 10 times, making 12 loops in all, turn.    2. Chain 4, 3 trebles in 1st loop, * chain 1, 3 trebles in next loop;  repeat from * across the row, ending with 4 trebles, turn.    3. Chain 4, a double under 1 chain, * chain 3, a double under next;  repeat to end of row.    Repeat 2d and 3d rows 23 times, making 24 rows of blocks in all,  alternating with rows of loops. Divide the width into three parts, 4  blocks for back of neck and 4 for each front. Work same as 3d row until  you have made 4 blocks, the last block of 4 trebles, turn and work back  same as 3d row. Repeat these 2 rows twice more; in next row, to widen,  make 6 trebles under 4th loop, chain 4, turn, miss 3 of 6 trebles, a  double between next 2, chain 3, fasten under 1 chain, and continue  across. The next row will consist of 5 blocks, and there are 20 rows of  5 blocks each, in all, making the same length of back. Make the other  front in exactly the same way.    For the border:    1. Fasten in at corner of neck (at end of 1st row of 5 blocks), work in  blocks down the front, across the bottom, putting 3 extra trebles at  each corner to turn smoothly, up over shoulder and down back, and so on  around to opposite corner, omitting the stitch between blocks.    2. Fasten blue yarn at right front and work a row of loops as described,  fastening the chains between groups of 3 trebles.    Make 3 more rows of blocks, same color as body of jacket, with always  the 3 extra trebles (6 in all) at corners to turn, and following the 2d  and 3d rows with the row of loops in blue.    For the sleeve: Fold the jacket evenly and fasten yarn at the back of  jacket, at the desired width for sleeve--9 blocks from top of shoulder,  in the model; chain 9, fasten to front, work around armhole with a row  of loops (gray), making 21 loops in all, 3 under arm, chain 3, 2 trebles  under 1st loop, chain 1, 3 trebles under next loop; repeat around, join,  and repeat the rows of loops and blocks to required length; the model  has 25 rows of blocks, ending with the row of loops.    For the cuff: Leave 7 blocks on top of sleeve, fasten in 8th loop (the  3d from center loop at top of sleeve), work around as usual to 3d loop  from center on other side, turn, make a row of loops, then a row of  blocks. Fasten the blue yarn to sleeve, and work around cuff with loops;  make a row of blocks with 6 trebles at corners to turn, and continue to  match border of jacket, making 4 rows of blocks and 3 of blue  chain-loops.    For the collar: Fasten yarn at corner of neck, in 1st block made in  border, and make 3 trebles in the same place, make a block in the side  of each 3 following blocks, along the neck toward the back, putting  chain 1 between, 2 blocks in side of next, to widen, 6 blocks, widen, 3  blocks. Follow with a row of loops, and continue same as for cuffs,  widening as directed and twice putting 6 trebles under each of 2  consecutive loops in outer row. Join at beginning and end of each row to  upper edge of jacket-border.    Finish with a border of loops, as follows: A double between blocks,  (chain 3, a double in same place) twice. Crochet a chain of the blue  yarn and use this to lace under the arms, finishing the ends with loops  as for the edge, and tying in a bow. Make a shorter chain for each cuff,  lace together and tie in a little bow to the sleeve. A similar chain is  used to draw in the neck.    Any preferred colors may, of course, be used. The jacket can be easily  made large enough for an adult, and is beautiful in blue-and-white  Saxony for a baby.          Babies' Jacket      [Illustration: Babies' Jacket]    Materials required are three skeins of Saxony yarn, one spool  silk-finished crochet-cotton or crochet-silk, and two and one-half yards  of No. 1 ribbon. Use a hook which will carry the yarn easily.    Make a chain of 100 stitches, turn.    1. Miss 1st 4 stitches, make a treble in each of 96 stitches, drawing  up to about five-eighths of an inch. Break and fasten wool (this so the  work will be done on the right side; one may turn, if preferred, but the  effect is not so good).    2. Fasten in where you began, pull up, make 2 trebles in top of 3d  treble and 1 treble back to where you fastened in, which makes a cross;  repeat, making 32 crosses in all; break thread and again join in at the  end where you began.    3. Make 21 trebles over 7 crosses, (12 trebles over next 2, 18 trebles  over 6 crosses) twice, 12 over 2, and again 21 over 7, which brings you  to end of row. The 12 trebles over 2 are to widen; the others are made 2  on each cross and 1 between.    4. Same as 2d row, 38 crosses.    5. Make 21 trebles plain (that is, 3 over each cross). 24 over 4  crosses, 21 plain, 12 over 2 crosses, 21 plain, 24 over next 4, 21  plain.    6. Forty-eight crosses.    7. Make 21 plain, 12 over next 2 crosses, 12 plain, (12 over next 2, 24  plain) twice, 12 over next 2, 12 plain, 12 over next 2, 21 plain.    8. Fifty-eight crosses.    9. Make 24 plain, miss 12 crosses, 24 plain, 12 over next 2, 24 plain,  miss 12 crosses, 24 plain.    10. Thirty-six crosses.    11. Plain, with 3 extra trebles under each arm, and 6 extra over the 6  crosses at center of back.    12. Forty crosses.    13. Plain, with 6 extra in back.    14. Forty-two crosses.    15. Like 13th row.    16. Forty-four crosses.    17. Like 13th row.    18. Forty-six crosses.    19. Plain, without widening in the back.    Around the neck make spaces for the ribbon by fastening in at end of  foundation-chain, chain 5, miss 2, a treble in next, * chain 2, miss 2,  1 treble, and repeat. Now make a row of crosses entirely around the  jacket, putting extra crosses at corners to keep the work flat, follow  this with a row of trebles, widening by making extra trebles at corners  to turn them nicely, finish with a row of shells of 8 trebles in a  stitch, miss 3, fasten, miss 3; repeat, and edge with the crochet-silk,  making a double between 1st 2 trebles of shell, (chain 2, a double  between next 2) 6 times, chain 2, double in double between shells, chain  2, and repeat.    For the sleeves:    1. Make 6 trebles on trebles under the arm, and 36 over the 12 crosses.    2. Fourteen crosses.    3. Plain, with 3 extra trebles under arm, 45 in all.    4. Fifteen crosses.    5. Same as 3d row, making 48 trebles.    6. Sixteen crosses.    7. Same as 3d row, making 51 trebles.    8. Seventeen crosses.    9. Same as 3d row, making 54 trebles.    Finish with shells and chain-loops, as described for the body of jacket.  Run one and one-fourth yards of ribbon in the neck, and divide the  remainder, running it in the 7th row of sleeve and making a pretty bow  on top.          Baby's Shoes in Crochet      [Illustration: Baby's Shoes in Crochet]    These little shoes may be made of crochet-cotton, or silk, white or  delicate color, or of wool. They are very firm and neat, and shaped to  the foot. The sample pair was made of No. 15 crochet-cotton; finer or  coarser material will result in a smaller or larger shoe, by the same  directions.    Commence at bottom of the sole with a chain of 33 stitches.    1. Miss 1st stitch, a double in each of 31 stitches, 3 in end stitch, 1  in each of 31 stitches down other side and 3 in last, join.    2. A double in 1st stitch, 2 in next, 1 in each double down the side to  within 2 stitches of middle of toe, 2 in next, 1 in next, 3 in middle  stitch, 1 in next, 2 in next, 1 in each down side, ending with 2 in 3d  stitch from middle of heel, 1 in next, and 3 in next, join.    3. Chain 1, a double in each of 2 stitches, 2 in next, 1 in each down  the side to within 4 of the end, 2 in next, 1 in each of 3, 3 in middle  stitch, 1 in each of 3, 2 in next, 1 in each down side, 2 in 4th stitch  from the end, 1 in each of 3, 2 in middle stitch of heel, join.    4. Same as 3d row, making an extra stitch between widenings.    5. Chain 4, miss 1, a treble in next, chain 1; repeat, making 2 trebles  with 1 chain between in each of the widenings of the toe, and 3 trebles,  with 1 chain between, at back of heel.    6. Chain 1, a double in each stitch all around, making 2 doubles in the  widening spaces at side of toe and in the middle of heel.    7. Chain 1, a double in each stitch around, widening as usual on each  side of toe and in the middle, also in middle of heel; join.    8. Same as 7th row.    9. Chain 4, * miss 1, a treble in next, chain 1; repeat around, join to  3d of 4"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26117"],[0,"Sketches of the Fair Sex, in All Parts of the World. (#10)"],[1,"head did honor to her nation and to her sex; although,  on some occasions, the virtues of her heart have been much suspected.  The sex, in general, are protected from insult, by many salutary laws;  and, except among the peasants, are exempted from every kind of toil and  slavery. Upon the whole, they seem to be approaching fast to the  enjoyment of that consequence, to which they have already arrived in  several parts of Europe.      THE IDEA OF FEMALE INFERIORITY.    It is an opinion pretty well established, that in strength of mind, as  well as of body, men are greatly superior to women.    Men are endowed with boldness and courage, women are not. The reason is  plain, these are beauties in our character; in theirs they would be  blemishes. Our genius often leads to the great and the arduous; theirs  to the soft and the pleasing; we bend our thoughts to make life  convenient; they turn theirs to make it easy and agreeable. If the  endowments allotted to us by nature could not be easily acquired by  women, it would be as difficult for us to acquire those peculiarly  allotted to them. Are we superior to them in what belongs to the male  character? They are no less so to us, in what belongs to the female  character.    Would it not appear rather ludicrous to say, that a man was endowed only  with inferior abilities, because he was not expert in the nursing of  children, and practising the various effeminacies which we reckon lovely  in a woman? Would it be reasonable to condemn him on these accounts?  Just as reasonable, as it is to reckon women inferior to men, because  their talents are in general not adapted to tread the horrid path of  war, nor trace the mazes and intricacies of science.    The idea of the inferiority of female nature has drawn after it several  others the most absurd, unreasonable, and humiliating to the sex. Such  is the pride of man, that in some countries he has considered  immortality as a distinction too glorious for women. Thus degrading the  fair partners of his nature, he places them on a level with the beasts  that perish.    As the Asiatics have, time immemorial, considered women as little better  than slaves, this opinion probably originated among them. The  Mahometans, both in Asia and Europe, are said, by a great variety of  writers, to entertain this opinion.    Lady Montague, in her letters, has opposed this general assertion of the  writers concerning the Mahometans; and says that they do not absolutely  deny the existence of female souls, but only hold them to be of a  nature inferior to those of men; and that they enter not into the same,  but into an inferior paradise, prepared for them on purpose. Lady  Montague, and the writers whom she has contradicted, may perhaps be both  right. The former might be the opinion which the Turks brought with them  from Asia; and the latter, as a refinement upon it they may have adopted  by their intercourse with the Europeans.    This opinion, however, has had but few votaries in Europe: though some  have even here maintained it, and assigned various reasons for so doing.  Among these, the following laughable reason is not the least  particular--\"In the Revelations of St. John the divine,\" said one, whose  wife was a descendant of the famous Xantippe,[1] \"you will find this  passage: _And there was silence in heaven for about the space of half an  hour_. Now, I appeal to any one, whether that could possibly have  happened, had there been any women there? And, since there are none  there, charity forbids us to imagine that they are all in a worse place;  therefore it follows that they have no immortal part: and happy is it  for them, as they are thereby exempted from being accountable for all  the noise and disturbance they have raised in this world.\"    In a very ancient treatise, called the Wisdom of all Times, ascribed to  Hushang, one of the earliest kings of Persia, are the following  remarkable words: \"The passions of men may, by long acquaintance, be  thoroughly known; but the passions of women are inscrutable; therefore  they ought to be separated from men, lest the mutability of their  tempers should infect others.\"    Ideas of a similar nature seem to have been at this time, generally  diffused over the East. For we find Solomon, almost every where in his  writings, exclaiming against women; and, in the Apocrypha, the author of  Ecclesiasticus is still more illiberal in his reflections.    Both these authors, it is true, join in the most enraptured manner to  praise a virtuous woman; but take care at the same time to let us know,  that she is so great a rarity as to be very seldom met with.    Nor have the Asiatics alone been addicted to this illiberality of  thinking concerning the sex. Satirists of all ages and countries, while  they flattered them to their faces, have from their closets scattered  their spleen and ill-nature against them. Of this the Greek and Roman  poets afford a variety of instances; but they must nevertheless yield  the palm to some of our moderns. In the following lines, Pope has  outdone every one of them:      \"Men some to pleasure, some to business take;    But every woman is at heart--a rake.\"    Swift and Dr Young have hardly been behind this celebrated splenetic in  illiberality. They perhaps were not favorites of the fair, and in  revenge vented all their envy and spleen against them. But a more modern  and accomplished writer who by his rank in life, by his natural and  acquired _graces_, was undoubtedly a favorite, has repaid their kindness  by taking every opportunity of exhibiting them in the most contemptible  light. \"Almost every man,\" says he, \"may be gained some way, almost  every woman any way, can any thing exhibit a stronger caution to the  sex?\" It is fraught with information; and it is to be hoped they will  use it accordingly.        [1] Xantippe, was the wife of Socrates, and the most famous scold          of antiquity.      FEMALE SIMPLICITY.    Would we conceive properly of that simplicity which is the sweetest  expression of a well-informed and well-meaning mind, which every where  diffuses tenderness and delicacy, sweetens the relations of life, and  gives a zest to the minutest duties of humanity, let us contemplate  every perceptible operation of nature, the twilight of the evening, the  pearly dew-drops of the early morning, and all that various growth which  indicates the genial return of spring. The same principle from which all  that is soft and pleasing, amiable or exquisite, to the eye or to the  ear, in the exterior frame of nature, produces that taste for true  simplicity, which is one of the most useful, as well as the most elegant  lessons, that _ladies_ can learn.    Infancy, is perhaps, the finest and most perfect illustration of  simplicity. It is a state of genuine nature throughout. The feelings of  children are under no kind of restraint, but pure as the fire, free as  the winds, honest and open as the face of heaven. Their joys incessantly  flow in the thickest succession, and their griefs only seem fleeting and  evanescent. To the calls of nature they are only attentive. They know no  voice but hers. Their obedience to all her commands is prompt and  implicit. They never anticipate her bounties, nor relinquish her  pleasures. This situation renders them independent of artifice.  Influenced only by nature, their manners, like the principle that  produces them, are always the same.    Genuine simplicity is that peculiar quality of the mind, by which some  happy characters are enabled to avoid the most distant approaches to any  thing like affectation, inconstancy, or design, in their intercourse  with the world. It is much more easily understood, however than defined;  and consists not in a specific tone of the voice, movement of the body,  or mode imposed by custom, but is the natural and permanent effect of  real modesty and good sense on the whole behavior.    This has been considered in all ages, as one of the first and most  captivating ornaments of the sex. The savage, the plebeian, the man of  the world, and the courtier, are agreed in stamping it with a preference  to every other female excellence.    Nature only is lovely, and nothing unnatural can ever be amiable. The  genuine expressions of truth and nature are happily calculated to  impress the heart with pleasure. No woman, whatever her other qualities  may be, was ever eminently agreeable, but in proportion as  distinguished by these. The world is good-natured enough to give a lady  credit for all the merit she can possess or acquire, without  affectation. But the least shade or coloring of this odious foible  brings certain and indelible obloquy on the most elegant  accomplishments. The blackest suspicion inevitably rests on every thing  assumed. She who is only an ape of others, or prefers formality in all  its gigantic and preposterous shapes, to that plain, unembarassed  conduct which nature unavoidably produces, will assuredly provoke an  abundance of ridicule, but never can be an object either of love or  esteem.    The various artifices of the sex discover themselves at a very early  period. A passion for expense and show is one of the first they exhibit.  This gives them a taste for refinement, which divests their young hearts  of almost every other feeling, renders their tempers desultory and  capricious, regulates their dress only by the most fantastic models of  finery and fashion, and makes their company rather tiresome and awkward,  than pleasing or elegant.    No one perhaps can form a more ludicrous contrast to every thing just  and graceful in nature, than the woman whose sole object in life is to  pass for a _fine lady_. The attentions she every where and uniformly  pays, expects, and even exacts, are tedious and fatiguing. Her various  movements and attitudes are all adjusted and exhibited by rule. By a  happy fluency of the most eloquent language, she has the art of"]]]
