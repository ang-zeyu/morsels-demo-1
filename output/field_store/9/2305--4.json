So the doctor was very glad to find that between Sunday and Thursday her  feelings had changed so much.    \"Yes,\" said she, \"the more I reflect the more I feel that one day would  not be enough to prepare myself for God's tribunal, to be judged by Him  after men have judged me.\"    \"Madame,\" replied the doctor, \"I do not know what or when your sentence  will be; but should it be death, and given to-day, I may venture to  promise you that it will not be carried out before to-morrow. But  although death is as yet uncertain, I think it well that you should be  prepared for any event.\"    \"Oh, my death is quite certain,\" said she, \"and I must not give way to  useless hopes. I must repose in you the great secrets of my whole life;  but, father, before this opening of my heart, let me hear from your lips  the opinion you have formed of me, and what you think in my present  state I ought to do.\"    \"You perceive my plan,\" said the doctor, \"and you anticipate what I was  about to say. Before entering into the secrets of your conscience,  before opening the discussion of your affairs with God, I am ready,  madame, to give you certain definite rules. I do not yet know whether  you are guilty at all, and I suspend my judgment as to all the crimes  you are accused of, since of them I can learn nothing except through  your confession. Thus it is my duty still to doubt your guilt. But I  cannot be ignorant of what you are accused of: this is a public matter,  and has reached my ears; for, as you may imagine, madame, your affairs  have made a great stir, and there are few people who know nothing about  them.\"    \"Yes,\" she said, smiling, \"I know there has been a great deal of talk,  and I am in every man's mouth.\"    \"Then,\" replied the doctor, \"the crime you are accused of is poisoning.  If you are guilty, as is believed, you cannot hope that God will pardon  you unless you make known to your judges what the poison is, what is its  composition and what its antidote, also the names of your accomplices.  Madame, we must lay hands on all these evil-doers without exception; for  if you spared them, they would be able to make use of your poison, and  you would then be guilty of all the murders committed by them after your  death, because you did not give them over to the judges during your  life; thus one might say you survive yourself, for your crime survives  you. You know, madame, that a sin in the moment of death is never  pardoned, and that to get remission for your crimes, if crimes you have,  they must die when you die: for if you slay them not, be very sure they  will slay you.\"    \"Yes, I am sure of that,\" replied the marquise, after a moment of silent  thought; \"and though I will not admit that I am guilty, I promise, if I  am guilty, to weigh your words. But one question, sir, and pray take  heed that an answer is necessary. Is there not crime in this world that  is beyond pardon? Are not some people guilty of sins so terrible and so  numerous that the Church dares not pardon them, and if God, in His  justice, takes account of them, He cannot for all His mercy pardon them?  See, I begin with this question, because, if I am to have no hope, it is  needless for me to confess.\"    \"I wish to think, madame,\" replied the doctor, in spite of himself half  frightened at the marquise, \"that this your first question is only put  by way of a general thesis, and has nothing to do with your own state. I  shall answer the question without any personal application. No, madame,  in this life there are no unpardonable sinners, terrible and numerous  howsoever their sins may be. This is an article of faith, and without  holding it you could not die a good Catholic. Some doctors, it is true,  have before now maintained the contrary, but they have been condemned as  heretics. Only despair and final impenitence are unpardonable, and they  are not sins of our life but in our death.\"    \"Sir,\" replied the marquise, \"God has given me grace to be convinced by  what you say, and I believe He will pardon all sins--that He has often  exercised this power. Now all my trouble is that He may not deign to  grant all His goodness to one so wretched as I am, a creature so  unworthy of the favours already bestowed on her.\"    The doctor reassured her as best he could, and began to examine her  attentively as they conversed together. \"She was,\" he said, \"a woman  naturally courageous and fearless; naturally gentle and good; not easily  excited; clever and penetrating, seeing things very clearly in her mind,  and expressing herself well and in few but careful words; easily finding  a way out of a difficulty, and choosing her line of conduct in the most  embarrassing circumstances; light-minded and fickle; unstable, paying no  attention if the same thing were said several times over. For this  reason,\" continued the doctor, \"I was obliged to alter what I had to say  from time to time, keeping her but a short time to one subject, to  which, however, I would return later, giving the matter a new appearance  and disguising it a little. She spoke little and well, with no sign of  learning and no affectation, always, mistress of herself, always  composed and saying just what she intended to say. No one would have  supposed from her face or from her conversation that she was so wicked  as she must have been, judging by her public avowal of the parricide. It  is surprising, therefore--and one must bow down before the judgment of  God when He leaves mankind to himself--that a mind evidently of some  grandeur, professing fearlessness in the most untoward and unexpected  events, an immovable firmness and a resolution to await and to endure  death if so it must be, should yet be so criminal as she was proved to  be by the parricide to which she confessed before her judges. She had  nothing in her face that would indicate such evil. She had very abundant  chestnut hair, a rounded, well-shaped face, blue eyes very pretty and  gentle, extraordinarily white skin, good nose, and no disagreeable  feature. Still, there was nothing unusually attractive in the face:  already she was a little wrinkled, and looked older than her age.  Something made me ask at our first interview how old she was.  'Monsieur,' she said, 'if I were to live till Sainte-Madeleine's day I  should be forty-six. On her day I came into the world, and I bear her  name. I was christened Marie-Madeleine. But near to the day as we now  are, I shall not live so long: I must end to-day, or at latest  to-morrow, and it will be a favour to give me the one day. For this  kindness I rely on your word.' Anyone would have thought she was quite  forty-eight. Though her face as a rule looked so gentle, whenever an  unhappy thought crossed her mind she showed it by a contortion that  frightened one at first, and from time to time I saw her face twitching  with anger, scorn, or ill-will. I forgot to say that she was very little  and thin. Such is, roughly given, a description of her body and mind,  which I very soon came to know, taking pains from the first to observe  her, so as to lose no time in acting on what I discovered.\"    As she was giving a first brief sketch of her life to her confessor, the  marquise remembered that he had not yet said mass, and reminded him  herself that it was time to do so, pointing out to him the chapel of the  Conciergerie. She begged him to say a mass for her and in honour of Our  Lady, so that she might gain the intercession of the Virgin at the  throne of God. The Virgin she had always taken for her patron saint, and  in the midst of her crimes and disorderly life had never ceased in her  peculiar devotion. As she could not go with the priest, she promised to  be with him at least in the spirit. He left her at half-past ten in the  morning, and after four hours spent alone together, she had been induced  by his piety and gentleness to make confessions that could not be wrung  from her by the threats of the judges or the fear of the question. The  holy and devout priest said his mass, praying the Lord's help for  confessor and penitent alike. After mass, as he returned, he learned  from a librarian called Seney, at the porter's lodge, as he was taking a  glass of wine, that judgment had been given, and that Madame de  Brinvilliers was to have her hand cut off. This severity--as a fact,  there was a mitigation of the sentence--made him feel yet more interest  in his penitent, and he hastened back to her side.    As soon as she saw the door open, she advanced calmly towards him, and  asked if he had truly prayed for her; and when he assured her of this,  she said, \"Father, shall I have the consolation of receiving the  viaticum before I die?\"    \"Madame,\" replied the doctor, \"if you are condemned to death, you must  die without that sacrament, and I should be deceiving you if I let you  hope for it. We have heard of the death of the constable of Saint-Paul  without his obtaining this grace, in spite of all his entreaties. He was  executed in sight of the towers of Notre-Dame. He offered his own  prayer, as you may offer yours, if you suffer the same fate. But that is  all: God, in His goodness, allows it to suffice.\"    \"But,\" replied the marquise, \"I believe M. de Cinq-Mars and M. de Thou  communicated before their death.\"    \"I think not, madame,\" said the doctor; \"for it is not so said in the  pages of Montresor or any other book that describes their execution.\"    \"But M. de Montmorency?\" said she.    \"But M. de Marillac?\" replied the doctor.    In truth, if the favour had been granted to the first, it had been  refused to the second, and the marquise was specially struck thereby,  for M. de Marillac was of her own family,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27560"],[0,"The 2005 CIA World Factbook (#10)"],[1,", President Bush, or Sultan Tunku  Salahuddin. The same system of capitalization is extended to the names  of leaders with surnames that are not commonly used such as Queen  ELIZABETH II.    Personal Names - Spelling  The romanization of personal names in the Factbook normally follows the  same transliteration system used by the US Board on Geographic Names  for spelling place names. At times, however, a foreign leader expressly  indicates a preference for, or the media or official documents  regularly use, a romanized spelling that differs from the  transliteration derived from the US Government standard. In such cases,  the Factbook uses the alternative spelling.    Personal Names - Titles  The Factbook capitalizes any valid title (or short form of it)  immediately preceding a person's name. A title standing alone is not  capitalized. Examples: President PUTIN and President BUSH are chiefs of  state. In Russia, the president is chief of state and the premier is  the head of the government, while in the US, the president is both  chief of state and head of government.    Petroleum  See entry for \"oil.\"    Petroleum products  See entry for \"oil.\"    Pipelines  This entry gives the lengths and types of pipelines for transporting  products like natural gas, crude oil, or petroleum products.    Political parties and leaders  This entry includes a listing of significant political organizations  and their leaders.    Political pressure groups and leaders  This entry includes a listing of organizations with leaders involved in  politics, but not standing for legislative election.    Population  This entry gives an estimate from the US Bureau of the Census based on  statistics from population censuses, vital statistics registration  systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past and on  assumptions about future trends. The total population presents one  overall measure of the potential impact of the country on the world and  within its region. Note: starting with the 1993 Factbook, demographic  estimates for some countries (mostly African) have explicitly taken  into account the effects of the growing impact of the HIV/AIDS  epidemic. These countries are currently: The Bahamas, Benin, Botswana,  Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central  African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the  Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras,  Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South  Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and  Zimbabwe.    Population below poverty line  National estimates of the percentage of the population falling below  the poverty line are based on surveys of sub-groups, with the results  weighted by the number of people in each group. Definitions of poverty  vary considerably among nations. For example, rich nations generally  employ more generous standards of poverty than poor nations.    Population growth rate  The average annual percent change in the population, resulting from a  surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance of migrants  entering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or negative.  The growth rate is a factor in determining how great a burden would be  imposed on a country by the changing needs of its people for  infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, housing, roads), resources  (e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapid population growth can  be seen as threatening by neighboring countries.    Ports and harbors  This entry lists the major ports and harbors selected on the basis of  overall importance to each country. This is determined by evaluating a  number of factors (e.g., dollar value of goods handled, gross tonnage,  facilities, military significance).    Public debt  This entry records the cumulatiive total of all government borrowings  less repayments that are denominated in a country's home currency.  Public debt should not be confused with external debt, which reflects  the foreign currency liabilities of both the private and public sector  and must be financed out of foreign exchange earnings.    Radio broadcast stations  This entry includes the total number of AM, FM, and shortwave broadcast  stations.    Railways  This entry states the total route length of the railway network and of  its component parts by gauge: broad, standard, narrow, and dual. Other  gauges are listed under note.    Reference maps  This section includes world and regional maps.    Refugees and internally displaced persons  This entry includes those persons residing in a country as refugees or  internally displaced persons (IDPs). The definition of a refugee  according to a United Nations Convention is \"a person who is outside  his/her country of nationality or habitual residence; has a well-  founded fear of persecution because of his/her race, religion,  nationality, membership in a particular social group or political  opinion; and is unable or unwilling to avail himself/herself of the  protection of that country, or to return there, for fear of  persecution.\" The UN established the Office of the UN High Commissioner  for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1950 to handle refugee matters worldwide. The  UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East  (UNRWA) has a different, operational definition for a Palestinian  refugee: \"a person whose normal place of residence was Palestine during  the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948 and who lost both home and means  of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict.\" However, UNHCR also  assists some 400,000 Palestinian refugees not covered under the UNRWA  definition. The term \"internally displaced person\" is not specifically  covered in the UN Convention; it is used to describe people who have  fled their homes for reasons similar to refugees, but who remain within  their own national territory and are subject to the laws of that state.    Religions  This entry is an ordered listing of religions by adherents starting  with the largest group and sometimes includes the percent of total  population.    Reserves of foreign exchange and gold  This entry gives the dollar value for the stock of all financial assets  that are available to the central monetary authority for use in meeting  a country's balance of payments needs as of the end-date of the period  specified. This category includes not only foreign currency and gold,  but also a country's holdings of Special Drawing Rights in the  International Monetary Fund, and its reserve position in the Fund.    Sex ratio  This entry includes the number of males for each female in five age  groups - at birth, under 15 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over, and  for the total population. Sex ratio at birth has recently emerged as an  indicator of certain kinds of sex discrimination in some countries. For  instance, high sex ratios at birth in some Asian countries are now  attributed to sex-selective abortion and infanticide due to a strong  preference for sons. This will affect future marriage patterns and  fertility patterns. Eventually, it could cause unrest among young adult  males who are unable to find partners.    Suffrage  This entry gives the age at enfranchisement and whether the right to  vote is universal or restricted.    Telephone numbers  All telephone numbers in the Factbook consist of the country code in  brackets, the city or area code (where required) in parentheses, and  the local number. The one component that is not presented is the  international access code, which varies from country to country. For  example, an international direct dial telephone call placed from the US  to Madrid, Spain, would be as follows: 011 [34] (1) 577-xxxx, where 011  is the international access code for station-to-station calls; 01 is  for calls other than station-to-station calls, [34] is the country code  for Spain, (1) is the city code for Madrid, 577 is the local exchange,  and xxxx is the local telephone number. An international direct dial  telephone call placed from another country to the US would be as  follows: international access code + [1] (202) 939-xxxx, where [ 1] is  the country code for the US, (202) is the area code for Washington, DC,  939 is the local exchange, and xxxx is the local telephone number.    Telephone system  This entry includes a brief general assessment of the system with  details on the domestic and international components. The following  terms and abbreviations are used throughout the entry:  Africa ONE - a fiber-optic submarine cable link encircling the  continent of Africa.  Arabsat - Arab Satellite Communications Organization (Riyadh, Saudi  Arabia).  Autodin - Automatic Digital Network (US Department of Defense).  CB - citizen's band mobile radio communications.  cellular telephone system - the telephones in this system are radio  transceivers, with each instrument having its own private radio  frequency and sufficient radiated power to reach the booster station in  its area (cell), from which the telephone signal is fed to a telephone  exchange.  Central American Microwave System - a trunk microwave radio relay  system that links the countries of Central America and Mexico with each  other.  coaxial cable - a multichannel communication cable consisting of a  central conducting wire, surrounded by and insulated from a cylindrical  conducting shell; a large number of telephone channels can be made  available within the insulated space by the use of a large number of  carrier frequencies.  Comsat - Communications Satellite Corporation (US).  DSN - Defense Switched Network (formerly Automatic Voice Network or  Autovon); basic general-purpose, switched voice network of the Defense  Communications System (US Department of Defense).  Eutelsat - European Telecommunications Satellite Organization (Paris).  fiber-optic cable - a multichannel communications cable using a thread  of optical glass fibers as a transmission medium"]]]
