There is considerable variation in coloration. None has a distinct  cream-colored, crescent-shaped mark bordered posteriorly by a dark  brown bar or triangle, as in the other species in the _Ptychohyla  euthysanota_ group. Most specimens have a rather indistinct crescent;  some have no crescent. In a few specimens there is a weakly outlined  dark mark posterior to the crescent. Some specimens in a series of  tadpoles from 32 kilometers north of Morazan, Baja Verapaz, Guatemala,  have faint dorsal blotches on the dorsal musculature, much like those  in tadpoles of _Ptychohyla leonhardschultzei_.    _Comparisons._--_Ptychohyla spinipollex_ differs from all other  species in the genus by having moderate-sized, instead of small,  pointed nuptial spines; also it has fewer spines than the other  species (see discussion of this character in Analysis of Data). The  nearly equal interorbital breadth and width of the upper eyelid also  is diagnostic of this species.    Other hylids sympatric with _Ptychohyla spinipollex_ include three  species of _Plectrohyla_, each of which has a bony prepollex, heavy  body, and rugose skin on the dorsum. The only other sympatric hylid  that could be confused with _Ptychohyla spinipollex_ is _Hyla  bromeliacea_, which has a round snout and yellowish tan dorsum not  marked with dark brown.    _Life History._--At Finca Los Alpes, Guatemala, in July, 1960, and in  August, 1961, calling males were found on bushes and trees along  cascading mountain streams. The breeding call consists of a soft  \"wraack,\" repeated at intervals of 45 seconds to four minutes. Each  note has a duration of about .46 of a second and a rate of 147 pulses  per second. The dominant frequency is 4300 cycles per second (Pl. 11A).    Tadpoles have been found in cascading mountain streams. Two  metamorphosed young have snout-vent lengths of 15.0 and 15.5 mm.    _Remarks._--There is little doubt that all of the specimens herein  referred to _Ptychohyla spinipollex_ are conspecific. However, the  three specimens from Honduras, including the type of _Ptychohyla  spinipollex_, differ from Guatemalan specimens in lacking all dark  spotting on the venter. Additional specimens from Honduras and eastern  Guatemala may show that two subspecies are recognizable, in which case  the nominal subspecies will be the population in Honduras.    _Distribution._--This species lives in cloud forests at elevations of  800 to 1700 meters on the Atlantic side of the Guatemalan Highlands  from the Sierra de Cuchumatanes in western Guatemala eastward to  central Honduras.    _Specimens examined._--GUATEMALA: _Alta Verapaz_: Finca Chichen, UMMZ  90876 (tadpoles); Finca Los Alpes, KU 58052-60, 59939 (skeleton),  60053 (tadpoles), 64122-41, 68562, 68563 (tadpoles), 68631-2  (skeletons), MCZ 35000-1, UMMZ 90873, 90874 (3), 90875 (tadpoles); La  Primavera, UMMZ 90877 (tadpoles); Panzamala, UMMZ 90878 (tadpoles).  _Baja Verapaz_: 32 km.
