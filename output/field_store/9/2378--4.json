It should be allowed  to remain in the night air; when thoroughly dried it is rolled in  coarse mats.    Black: Black straw, a warm dark gray, is prepared from the red  material. Buds of bananas, leaves of kabling, talisay, camagon, and the  castor plant are pounded in a mortar and are mixed with fine particles  of black clay such as can be obtained from rice paddies. Sappan water,  made by boiling sappan chips, is then added to the mixture and the  entire mass is placed in a large receptacle for a day. Red straw  is put into this mixture and allowed to remain for two days. It is  removed on the third day and again returned to the mixture on the  fourth day. On the fifth day the straw is finally removed and placed  in the sun, being kept in the air at night.    Coal tar dyes are used in the production of green and purple  straws. These are purchased from the Chinese stores. The prepared gray  fiber is also employed with these dyes. The usual method of boiling  in a tin can until the desired shade is obtained, is followed. The  straw is dried in the sun and kept in the night air. Colors produced  are not so uniform or so satisfactory as the others described and  are seldom used.    Weaving the mats.--Before weaving the mat the worker runs the straw  over the ruler-like piece of bamboo as already explained, and removes  the uncut base to which it has been attached during the various  processes of preparation, bleaching, and dyeing. One side of the mat  is first woven the entire length, and is finished by having the edges  turned in. This edge is then placed in a slit made in a narrow stick  of wood and is tied in place with strips of sabutan straw running  around the stick and through the mat. The mat is allowed to remain  attached to this stick until it has been completely woven. As weaving  proceeds, the finished part is rolled up on the stick, thus being  out of the way of the weaver. This arrangement also serves to keep  the mat in position during weaving and prevents it from getting out  of shape. Single straws are used and consequently the mat has a right  and a wrong side. [16] The most expensive mats, which are seldom made,  are double and of very fine material.    The extension and cultivation of sabutan.--For a number of years  there has been an increasing interest throughout the Philippines in  the propagation of sabutan. Teachers in various places have procured  suckers from the towns along the east coast of Laguna de Bay, and  have planted them out with the idea of having their own industrial  material close at hand. Many of these attempts have been failures,  since not enough information had been obtained concerning the soil and  moisture conditions necessary for the cultivation of the plant. The  Bureau of Education has therefore gathered as much information as  possible on the cultivation of sabutan, based upon the experience of  various persons who have attempted planting it.    It has been found that, in those regions having a dry season, the  suckers should be planted early in the rainy season so that they may  become well rooted before the rains stop, or else water should be  provided through irrigation ditches. In nearly all cases it has been  reported that the loss of plants resulted from lack of water at the  planting period.    It is reported that difficulty is found in making the suckers live if  planted in the sun, but that, when well established, those so planted  grow and produce suckers better. As has been previously noted, no  special attempt is made to set the plants out in either the sun or  shade in the towns around Laguna de Bay, but all weavers state that  leaves grown in the shade are the best for industrial purposes.    Sabutan plants need a moist but well drained soil. They should be  set out about a meter apart each way (that is, the rows one meter  apart and plants one meter apart in the row), since they spread out  considerably when they become older. Where sufficient moisture does  not exist, irrigation should be provided. If it is decided to shade  the suckers, plants such as the papaya, having long roots rather than  surface roots, are best. No sabutan plants should be planted within  6 feet of the papaya.    It is probable that with cultivation the plants will yield leaves  suitable for straw in from one and one-half to two years, the time  to mature depending upon the conditions noted in the preceding  paragraphs. [17]    Sabutan types.--In several places in the Philippines there are  pandans which yield leaves similar to those of sabutan. It is probable  that none of these are the true sabutan. The most important one is  that growing along the northeastern shore of Tayabas Province. Mats  are made at both Casiguran and Baler, and enter to a small extent,  the interprovincial trade with neighboring provinces. It is stated,  however, that these regions abound in the species of pandan from  which the mats are made. Sabutan type mats are also reported made at  Palanan in Isabela Province, and a trade is carried on in them with  neighboring towns.    Other pandans reported under the name of sabutan and resembling it  more or less have no commercial importance.        Sarakat.    Sarakat is a distinctive pandan of the Bangui Peninsula of Ilocos  Norte. The climate of this region differs from the rest of Ilocos Norte  in that it has rainfall practically throughout the year, receiving as  it does the benefit of the northeast monsoon which is cut off from  the country to the south. It has not as yet been determined whether  sarakat is to be described as a new variety of P. tectorius or is to  be designated as an entirely new species.    From mats submitted to this office, it is to be judged that sarakat  straw is as fine as sabutan. In fact, the material is so thin that  even though the mats are woven of double straws they are no thicker,  and are a good deal more pliable than all other commercial pandan mats,  sabutan excepted, produced in the Philippines. The upper surface of  pandan straw is glossy, and the under surface is rough. In making  the double straw, the two rough surfaces are placed together so as  to expose both glossy ones. Hence, unlike the sabutan, both sides  of sarakat mats are similar in appearance. The material, however,  is not so strong as sabutan. [18]    The mats are not decorated either by weaving in colored straws or by  embroidered or border designs. In price they vary from about P1 to P2.    Mr. Petronilo Castro, formerly Supervising Teacher of Bangui, has  stated that that town supplies most of the mats used by the people  of Ilocos Norte. Some buri mats and a few \"pandan\" mats (probably  from the common seashore variety) are made. The sarakat mats exceed  those of pandan in numbers and in commercial importance and are more  beautiful and stronger. The demand for the mats is great and many  people are engaged exclusively in their fabrication.        The Pandan of Majayjay. [19]    This pandan (P. utilissimus) is known in most places where it  grows as \"pandan\" or \"pandan totoo,\" the true or tame pandan. It  is extensively used in Laguna and Tayabas and is remarkable for its  very large leaves and its heavy fruit. The tree occurs in groups in  dry ground but thrives best in half shade near streams. It attains a  height of from 4 to 8 meters. The trunk branches toward the top and  is supported by a few short and thick prop roots.    The leaves are often 5 meters long and 2 decimeters wide. The lower  part of the older leaves stands up straight, while the upper half  droops. The younger leaves are erect with only their tips bent  down. The leaf spines are short, blunt, and conical.    The fruits look like the jackfruit and are very large and heavy, being  often 6 decimeters long and 2 decimeters in diameter and weighing at  times 25 or more kilograms. The drupes ripen slowly and gradually;  they are red in color when fully mature and possess a peculiar faint  odor. It takes some time before all the drupes are shed, and in a  grove of fruiting trees they can be found in all stages of maturity  during the month of May.    P. utilissimus is found growing wild throughout the plateau region  of Majayjay, Luisiana, and Cavinti in Laguna Province, and extending  into Tayabas Province. It is only the leaves from those plants which  have been set out in plots, however, that are utilized in the making  of mats, hats and telescope baskets. Like sabutan, this pandan grows  best in the half-shade near streams, and leaves grown in the sun  are considered inferior. Nevertheless, no attempt seems to be made to  select a locality for their propagation, and plots are planted wherever  land is available. This pandan will not live in stagnant water and  is particularly adapted to hill-sides where there is a constant flow.    The most satisfactory statistics on the propagation of P. utilissimus  are obtained from Cavinti, where the plant has been introduced  within recent years and suckers are still being brought in from other  towns. It is stated that suckers one-half meter in height mature in  about three years, while suckers one meter in height or over will  produce suitable leaves in one year or less. The most satisfactory  results are obtained by transplanting the mature plants, since leaves  are obtainable in a few months and in half a year suckers large  enough for transplanting are produced. It is stated that in setting  the plants out, the undergrowth is cleared away and the suckers are  placed in the ground about 1 1/2 meters apart. Some attention is  given to the young plants such as loosening the earth around them;  but as soon as they obtain a good foothold no cultivation is attempted.    Usually weavers own their patch of pandan from which the leaves are  obtained for making the straw. Several workers sometimes have a patch  in common and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30889"],[0,"The Mechanism of the Human Voice (#10)"],[1,"are, afterwards, considerable differences noticeable, not only  with regard to size, but also with regard to shape. This seems, indeed,  sufficiently obvious, and any one can see it by simply comparing the  outside of the throat of a man with that of a woman.         Nevertheless we are told by Mr. Lunn[L] that \"Anatomy teaches us       that there is no difference between the male and female larynx save       in size;\" and by Dr. Garrett (on page 13 of the book quoted before)       that \"The male larynx does not differ anatomically in the least       from that of the female, except in size.\"         My readers may judge for themselves whether these statements are       borne out by facts or not.    It must further be observed that the whole upper part of the shield in  the female voicebox is less developed than in the male. The upper horns  are short, so that the voicebox is more closely attached to the  tongue-bone, and its position in the throat is altogether higher in  woman than in man. To show more clearly still the difference in the  proportions of the male and the female voicebox, I give below some  average measurements (taken from Luschka's great work on the Larynx)  which I have, for the convenience of English readers, reduced, as nearly  as possible, from centimetres and millimetres to inches.

According to this eminent anatomist, therefore, the differences between  male and female larynges are as follows: In height, 9/10; in width, 1/5;  in depth, 1/5; in the length of the vocal chink, 2/5 of an inch. As it  is plain that if there were \"no difference between the male and the  female larynx save in size,\" all their proportions would be alike, I  think I may safely assume that I have proved my point, which is a rather  important one, as the reader will see when the registers in the male and  female voice come up for discussion.    We will now consider the question how the various classes of  voice--_i.e._, Sopranos, Contraltos, Tenors, and Basses--are to be  accounted for by corresponding differences in the voicebox. We know that  tone is produced by the vibrations of the vocal ligaments. It is clear,  therefore, that a voice will be high or low according to the number of  vibrations which the ligaments are capable of producing, or in other  words, according to their dimensions and their tension. This difference  is easily seen by comparing the voicebox of a soprano with that of a  bass, because there the proportions are so manifestly smaller in the one  than in the other. There are similar distinctions between soprano and  contralto on the one hand, and between tenor and bass on the other, but  they are not so striking. Neither can they, for various reasons, be  demonstrated with the laryngoscope; but they exist nevertheless.    It is true that the vocal ligaments of a soprano are sometimes longer  than those of a contralto, just as the ligaments of a tenor are  occasionally longer than those of a bass. But I maintain that the longer  ligaments of sopranos and tenors are correspondingly thinner, and that  their tension is greater, owing to the ring-shield or stretching muscles  being more powerful than their opponents--the shield-pyramid muscles.  Where this is the case the ligaments are more slanting than they would  be otherwise, and the consequence of this is that less power of blast is  required to make them speak. With this mechanism the higher registers  are very readily united with the lower ones, and the voices so produced  are of a light and flexible kind. Where, on the contrary, the vocal  ligaments of contraltos and basses are comparatively short, they are  also thick in proportion, and the shield-pyramid muscles are more  powerful than the opposing ring-shield muscles, so that there is less  tension. I shall be asked how I can prove this tension theory, and my  reply is this: The diameter of the vocal ligaments depends in a large  measure on the magnitude of the shield-pyramid muscles. If, therefore,  the ligaments are exceptionally thick, the muscles just named must of  necessity be very powerful, and can easily resist the pulling of the  ring-shield muscles. If, on the contrary, the ligaments are  exceptionally thin, it is equally certain that the shield-pyramid  muscles are weak in proportion, and then the stretching muscles can  easily overcome their resistance.           *       *       *       *       *    I may add that I came to the above conclusions about the various classes  of voices years ago, when commencing the study of this subject. Not only  have I never since seen any reason to alter my views--although I have  not failed to notice and carefully examine the theories of others  denying my doctrine--but I am more than ever convinced that my  explanations are correct. I have now the gratification of seeing my  theory confirmed by so great an authority as Dr. Merkel, of Leipzig, who  most elaborately explains the subject in his latest work on the larynx,  to which I have already alluded in these pages.           *       *       *       *       *    Besides the factors enumerated above, there are, no doubt, others which  are also of consequence in determining the particular kind of voice to  be produced by this vocal apparatus or by that; as, for instance, the  windpipe, or the resonator, or both. The capacity of the chest--nay, the  structure of the whole body, may have a more or less direct influence  upon it. But there are absolutely no statistics to proceed upon, and in  the absence of these it is vain to indulge in any speculations on the  subject.          MOVEMENTS OF THE VOICEBOX, OR LARYNX, WHICH CAN BE SEEN OR FELT.      The voicebox in a man is situated almost exactly in the middle of the  throat; in woman its position is, for reasons partly explained on page  64, considerably higher. It moves downwards in inspiration, and upwards  in expiration; and the more vigorously we breathe, the more marked are  these movements. In the act of swallowing the voicebox rises quickly,  and in yawning it goes down so completely that the whole windpipe may  vanish into the chest, and even the part of the ring cartilage may  disappear.    When singing in what is called chest-voice the voicebox rises gradually  with each higher tone. Changing the mode of tone production, and  singing--say an octave higher--in falsetto, the voicebox makes quite a  leap upwards, and then again rises gradually with each higher tone,  just as in chest-voice, but in a lesser degree. The voicebox, however,  does not stand so high for the lowest falsetto as for the highest chest  tones.         It is possible, of course, to limit these movements to a minimum,       but a teacher who insists upon his pupils keeping their voice-boxes       perfectly still commits a serious mistake, because it is always       injurious to do violence to nature. It is one thing to keep the       voicebox steady, thereby facilitating the working of some of those       muscles which act immediately upon the vocal ligaments; it is quite       another thing, as will be seen below, to attempt to prevent       movements which have to serve a great purpose.    In _whispering_, the voicebox occupies a different position in the  throat for each vowel. I invite the reader to try the following curious  experiment. Let him take the larynx gently between the thumb and the  first finger, and then _whisper_ OO (as in \"food,\") OH, AH, A (as in  \"name,\") and E (as in \"bee\"). He will find that the voicebox rises with  every succeeding vowel until at last it has completely slipped away from  between the finger and thumb. Each one of these _whispered_ vowels has,  as first ascertained by Helmholtz, its exact pitch, whether uttered by a  little child or by an old man, and the effect of the rising of the  voicebox is to shorten the resonator, whereby the raising of the pitch  is produced.    I stated on page 41 that the vocal ligaments were capable of being  stretched by the ring-shield muscles, and that the pitch of the tones  produced by their vibrations depended mainly on their tension. As we  are now taking note of such movements of the voicebox as may be either  seen or felt in the throat, we will take the opportunity of trying  whether my statement can be verified. Let the reader, therefore, do as  follows:--(1) Place the finger on the shield cartilage, and press it  vigorously backward. (2) Sing loudly any high tone that is well within  your compass. Hold this tone steadily, and _be quite sure you do not  alter its pitch_. (3) Now suddenly remove your finger, continuing to  sing as before. What is the result? Your tone is raised by a third, or  even more, according to the amount of pressure you exercised on the  shield. And how did this result come about? In this way: By pressing the  shield backwards you elongated the ring-shield muscles, thereby  counteracting their stretching influence, and at the same time  slackening the vocal ligaments. The tone you sang while doing this was,  we will say C'. By releasing the shield you enabled the ring-shield  muscles to contract again, thereby putting the vocal ligaments on the  stretch as they were at first. That changed your C' to E', or higher  still. Have I proved my assertion?    Now one more test, if you"]]]
