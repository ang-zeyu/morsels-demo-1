But you must know, that my father left me a  fortune, of which I dedicated the greater part to God; and since then for my  own support and the relief of Christ's poor I have done a little trading,  whereof I have desired to make gain; and all that I have gotten I have  shared with God's poor, reserving one half for my own needs and giving the  other half to them; and so well has my Maker prospered me, that I have ever  managed my affairs to better and better account.\" \"Well, done,\" said the  friar, \"but how? hast thou often given way to anger?\" \"Often indeed, I  assure you,\" said Ser Ciappelletto. \"And who could refrain therefrom, seeing  men doing frowardly all day long, breaking the commandments of God and  recking nought of His judgments? Many a time in the course of a single day I  had rather be dead than alive, to see the young men going after vanity,  swearing and forswearing themselves, haunting taverns, avoiding the  churches, and in short walking in the way of the world rather than in God's  way.\" \"My son,\" said the friar, \"this is a righteous wrath; nor could I find  occasion therein to lay a penance upon thee. But did anger ever by any  chance betray thee into taking human life, or affronting or otherwise  wronging any?\" \"Alas,\" replied Ser Ciappelletto, \"alas, sir, man of God  though you seem to me, how come you to speak after this manner? If I had had  so much as the least thought of doing any of the things of which you speak,  should I believe, think you, that I had been thus supported of God? These  are the deeds of robbers and such like evil men, to whom I have ever said,  when any I saw:--'Go, God change your heart.'\" Said then the friar:--\"Now,  my son, as thou hopest to be blest of God, tell me, hast thou never borne  false witness against any, or spoken evil of another, or taken the goods of  another without his leave?\" \"Yes, master friar,\" answered Ser Ciappelletto,  \"most true it is that I have spoken evil of another; for I had once a  neighbour who without the least excuse in the world was ever beating his  wife, and so great was my pity of the poor creature, whom, when he was in  his cups, he would thrash as God alone knows how, that once I spoke evil of  him to his wife's kinsfolk.\" \"Well, well,\" said the friar, \"thou tellest me  thou hast been a merchant; hast thou ever cheated any, as merchants use to  do?\" \"I'faith, yes, master friar,\" said Ser Ciappelletto; \"but I know not  who he was; only that he brought me some money which he owed me for some  cloth that I had sold him, and I put it in a box without counting it, where  a month afterwards I found four farthings more than there should have been,  which I kept for a year to return to him, but not seeing him again, I  bestowed them in alms for the love of God.\" \"This,\" said the friar, \"was a  small matter; and thou didst well to bestow them as thou didst.\" The holy  friar went on to ask him many other questions, to which he made answer in  each case in this sort. Then, as the friar was about to give him absolution,  Ser Ciappelletto interposed:--\"Sir, I have yet a sin to confess.\" \"What?\"  asked the friar. \"I remember,\" he said, \"that I once caused my servant to  sweep my house on a Saturday after none; and that my observance of Sunday  was less devout than it should have been.\" \"O, my son,\" said the friar,  \"this is a light matter.\" \"No,\" said Ser Ciappelletto, \"say not a light  matter; for Sunday is the more to be had in honour because on that day our  Lord rose from the dead.\" Then said the holy friar:--\"Now is there aught  else that thou hast done?\" \"Yes, master friar,\" replied Ser Ciappelletto,  \"once by inadvertence I spat in the church of God.\" At this the friar began  to smile, and said:--\"My son, this is not a matter to trouble about; we, who  are religious, spit there all day long.\" \"And great impiety it is when you  so do,\" replied Ser Ciappelletto, \"for there is nothing that is so worthy to  be kept from all impurity as the holy temple in which sacrifice is offered  to God.\" More he said in the same strain, which I pass over; and then at  last he began to sigh, and by and by to weep bitterly, as he was well able  to do when he chose. And the friar demanding:--\"My son, why weepest thou?\"  \"Alas, master friar\" answered Ser Ciappelletto, \"a sin yet remains, which I  have never confessed, such shame were it to me to tell it; and as often as I  call it to mind, I weep as you now see me weep, being well assured that God  will never forgive me this sin.\" Then said the holy friar:--\"Come, come,  son, what is this that thou sayst? If all the sins of all the men, that ever  were or ever shall be, as long as the world shall endure, were concentrated  in one man, so great is the goodness of God that He would freely pardon them  all, were he but penitent and contrite as I see thou art, and confessed  them: wherefore tell me thy sin with a good courage.\" Then said Ser  Ciappelletto, still weeping bitterly:--\"Alas, my father, mine is too great a  sin, and scarce can I believe, if your prayers do not co-operate, that God  will ever grant me His pardon thereof.\" \"Tell it with a good courage,\" said  the friar; \"I promise thee to pray God for thee.\" Ser Ciappelletto, however,  continued to weep, and would not speak, for all the friar's encouragement.  When he had kept him for a good while in suspense, he heaved a mighty sigh,  and said:--\"My father, as you promise me to pray God for me, I will tell it  you. Know, then, that once, when I was a little child, I cursed my mother;\"  and having so said he began again to weep bitterly. \"O, my son,\" said the  friar, \"does this seem to thee so great a sin? Men curse God all day long,  and he pardons them freely, if they repent them of having so done; and  thinkest thou he will not pardon thee this? Weep not, be comforted, for  truly, hadst thou been one of them that set Him on the Cross, with the  contrition that I see in thee, thou wouldst not fail of His pardon.\" \"Alas!  my father,\" rejoined Ser Ciappelletto, \"what is this you say? To curse my  sweet mother that carried me in her womb for nine months day and night, and  afterwards on her shoulder more than a hundred times! Heinous indeed was my  offence; 'tis too great a sin; nor will it be pardoned, unless you pray God  for me.\"    The friar now perceiving that Ser Ciappelletto had nothing more to say, gave  him absolution and his blessing, reputing him for a most holy man, fully  believing that all that he had said was true. And who would not have so  believed, hearing him so speak at the point of death? Then, when all was  done, he said:--\"Ser Ciappelletto, if God so will, you will soon be well;  but should it so come to pass that God call your blessed soul to Himself in  this state of grace, is it well pleasing to you that your body be buried in  our convent?\" \"Yea, verily, master friar,\" replied Ser Ciappelletto; \"there  would I be, and nowhere else, since you have promised to pray God for me;  besides which I have ever had a special devotion to your order. Wherefore I  pray you, that, on your return to your convent, you cause to be sent me that  very Body of Christ, which you consecrate in the morning on the altar;  because (unworthy though I be) I purpose with your leave to take it, and  afterwards the holy and extreme unction, that, though I have lived as a  sinner, I may die at any rate as a Christian.\" The holy man said that he was  greatly delighted, that it was well said of Ser Ciappelletto, and that he  would cause the Host to be forthwith brought to him; and so it was.    The two brothers, who much misdoubted Ser Ciappelletto's power to deceive  the friar, had taken their stand on the other side of a wooden partition  which divided the room in which Ser Ciappelletto lay from another, and  hearkening there they readily heard and understood what Ser Ciappelletto  said to the friar; and at times could scarce refrain their laughter as they  followed his confession; and now and again they said one to another:--\"What  manner of man is this, whom neither age nor sickness, nor fear of death, on  the threshold of which he now stands, nor yet of God, before whose  judgment-seat he must soon appear, has been able to turn from his wicked  ways, that he die not even as he has lived?\" But seeing that his confession  had secured the interment of his body in church, they troubled themselves no  further. Ser Ciappelletto soon afterwards communicated, and growing  immensely worse, received the extreme unction, and died shortly after  vespers on the same day on which he had made his good confession. So the two  brothers, having from his own moneys provided the wherewith to procure him  honourable sepulture, and sent word to the friars to come at even to observe  the usual vigil, and in the morning to fetch the corpse, set all things in  order accordingly. The holy friar who had confessed him, hearing that he was  dead, had audience of the prior of the friary; a chapter was convened and  the assembled brothers heard from the confessor's own mouth how Ser  Ciappelletto had been a holy man, as had appeared by his confession, and  were exhorted to receive the body with the utmost veneration and pious care,  as one by which there was good hope that God would work many miracles. To  this the prior and the rest of the credulous confraternity assenting, they  went in a body in the evening to the place where the corpse of Ser  Ciappelletto lay, and kept a great and solemn vigil over it; and in the  morning they made a procession habited in their surplices and copes with  books in their hands and crosses in front; and chanting as they went, they  fetched the corpse and brought it back to their church with the utmost pomp  and solemnity, being followed by almost all the folk of the city, men and  women alike. So it was laid in the church, and then the holy friar who had  heard the confession got up in the pulpit and began to preach"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37329"],[0,"The Domestic Cat (#10)"],[1," a succession of fits--something ought to be  done to prevent their recurrence.  If too fat, you must reduce her by  lowering her diet, and giving a little sheep's liver and milt two or  three times a week.  If too thin, tonics and raw meat must be given, and  cod-liver oil every morning.  If, in spite of this, the fits recur, you  must have recourse to such an alterative as the following, which has  done good in many such cases:--R Bromid. potass., gr. xv.; Iod. potass.,  Zinci sulph., aa., gr. v.  Mix with moist breadcrumb, and make twenty  boluses, of which the dose is one night and morning.    _Jaundice_.--Called also the yellows.  The disease can hardly be  mistaken.  It is characterised by general feverishness, loss of  appetite, a disposition to \"lie about,\" and by vomiting of a bright  yellow or green fluid, covered with froth.    The skin, eyes, and lips are also tinged with yellow.  It is often fatal  if not attended to in time.    I give, to begin with, a very small teaspoonful of Glauber salts,  diluted with plenty of water.  It acts as a purgative or emetic, I don't  care which.  If the vomiting continues, try a few grains of white  bismuth placed on the tongue, or take three drops of creosote, and five  of aromatic powder, and form into ten pills, with breadcrumb.  _Dose_,  one three times a day.  For four or five nights running give one grain  of calomel on the tongue.  But watch the symptoms, and omit for a night  or two, if it causes too much purging.  If not, you can give a small  dose of castor-oil in the morning.    As she gets well, strengthen her, and encourage her appetite with  quinine first--no wine--and, after a week or two, with raw meat and  cod-liver oil.    _Milk Fever_.--Only cat-fanciers will believe that poor pussy suffers,  at times, the most cruel tortures, from the thoughtless practice of  depriving her of her kittens all at once.  Either this or cold usually  produces milk fever.  I need not describe it; it being synchronous with  the suckling season will be sufficient to enable even a tyro to diagnose  it.  If the cat is very much excited, and partially or wholly delirious,  bleeding must be resorted to, and afterwards give a castor-oil  purgative, with three or four drops of the compound tincture of camphor,  and keep her in a quiet room.  At the same time, the swollen and painful  teats must be frequently fomented with warm water.    Never take a cat's kittens away all at once, but always leave one at  least.  If she has five, and you mean to drown four, drown two one day  and two the next, so that the first milk may be well drawn off.    I have not mentioned half the ills that feline flesh is heir to, but I  think I have said sufficient to indicate the _general plan of treatment_  of cat diseases.  Let me only just repeat that if you use your pussy  well in the matter of housing, food, and drink--bar accidents--you will  never have her ill at all.    CHAPTER ELEVEN.    TRICKS AND TRAINING.    Before going on to speak of the training of youthful pussy, there is one  subject which deserves a word or two at least--namely, the humane  destruction of cats, when such destruction becomes necessary.    Kittens, at least, people have often to get rid of, or the whole world  would be peopled with cats, and that would hardly do.  Although I am no  advocate for the rash and hasty condemnation of the sickest cat that  ever is, still, I must confess that, at times, to destroy a cat is to be  merciful to it.    Never give kittens poison, it is cruel in the extreme; you might  chloroform them to death, but one doesn't like to waste much time in  taking life, if merely a kitten's; the pail is always handy, and the  poor wee things don't really suffer much if you do it properly.  Always  sink them, and keep the pail for three hours, after which bury them at  once.  I'll give you an example of the wrong way of doing things.  Miss  M--n, who lived not a stone's throw from where I now write, and who is  an old maid (and may a merciful Providence keep her so!), was changing  her residence last month, and at the last moment thought she couldn't be  bothered with more than one of her kittens--little Persian beauties,  whom she had let live a whole month--so one was snatched from its  mother's arms, and pitched carelessly into a pail of water.  She never  heeded its cries, nor the mother's piteous appeal to save her offspring;  so presently kitty was dead, to all appearance, and the bucket was  emptied over the wall into an adjoining field.  This was at eleven  o'clock in the morning, and late that evening some boys, in passing,  were attracted to the spot by plaintive mews, and there they found the  kitten crawling in the grass, with sadly swollen body and inflamed  mouth.  The boys drowned and buried it, being more humane than old maid  M--n.    If necessity, then, compels you to part by death with an old cat, and  probably an old friend and favourite, I do not advise you to have her  drowned.  It is cruel in many ways; there is the catching of her, the  putting of her into the sack with the stone, and the march to the  waterside, the cat knowing all the while what is to happen, and that her  mistress ordered her death.  Do not drown her.  If there is any one you  can really trust, that you are sure knows the difference between a gun  and a washing-stick, by all means have her shot.  It is over in a  moment.  The next best plan is to administer morphia.  Don't grudge her  a good dose--five or even ten grains.  Cats are wonderfully tenacious of  life, but they can't stand that.  Make the morphia into a pill, with a  little of the extract of liquorice, and force it down the throat.  Pussy  will sleep the sleep that knows no waking, and you will have the  satisfaction of knowing she did not suffer.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    Apart from teaching a cat tricks, which tend to amuse children or older  folks, there is a training which every pussy needs when young--viz, to  be cleanly and honest.  For some weeks after the kitten has been taken  from its mother, and gone to its new abode, a flower-pot saucer filled  with sand, or, what is better, a small box of garden mould, must be  placed in a particular corner of the room, and the kitten taught to go  there; two or three lessons are usually sufficient.  By degrees wean her  from the box, and teach her to go out of doors.    As to teaching her the difference between _meum_ and _tuum_, I maintain,  with all cat-fanciers, that cats are honest by nature, although they  may, at times, be tempted to steal a herring, or take a slight liberty  with the canary.  The great secret is to feed pussy well, and be kind to  her; you may then let her sit on the table, or even extend to her the  liberty of the press.  Depend upon it she will never do anything to  deserve disfranchisement.    If ever you catch pussy tripping, chastise her; but don't forget this,  you must do so only very moderately, or in the fright she will forget  what she is being whipped for.  A little bit of whalebone is the best  thing to use, but take care you do not hit her about the head.  I have  often known cats severely chastised for what they were quite innocent  of.  One pussy, I remember, used to be thrashed every day for a whole  week for a certain act of impropriety, and it turned out, after all,  that Charley, the black-and-tan, was the real culprit.  She took it out  of Charley, however.  She whipped him upstairs, and she whipped him  down, and finally she whipped him over the window, which was two storeys  high.  Poor Charley was much hurt, and didn't turn up again for a  fortnight.    Would you have your cat a good mouser?  Then _feed her regularly_ and  liberally; I assure you, madam, that is the whole secret.    Cats, when young, can be taught a whole host of amusing tricks.    The most graceful of these is, perhaps, leaping heights.  A cat that has  had constant exercise at this sort of thing will spring almost  incredible distances.  The best plan to train her to this is to attach a  hare's foot to the end of a rod and set it in motion for her.  You can  every day place it a little higher, and she will soon take to it  naturally.  Cats thus trained will climb the tallest trees, and leap  from branch to branch like squirrels.    By holding your arms in front of pussy you will soon teach her to leap  backwards and forwards over them.  As she gets older, increase the  distance of your arms from the ground, until at last you place them  right over your head, and pussy will go over and through like any old  steeple-chaser.    You may teach her to go through a hoop, or hoops, held at any elevation,  and in all conceivable positions.  Remember always to speak kindly to  her when teaching her anything.  Never chastise her; and when she has  performed her little feat to your satisfaction, make much of her, and  give her a morsel of fish, or any favourite food.    Cats are easily taught to fish in this manner: take them when young to a  shallow stream, on a clear day, where the minnows are plentiful, and  throw in a dead one or two, and encourage the cat to catch them.  She  will soon be after the living ones.    I had a cat that I taught to retrieve like a dog, and to fetch and  carry.  The same cat had for its constant companion my cheeky little  starling, who used to hop about and on her, pick her teeth, and open her  claws, but she never attempted to molest him.    You can teach your cat to follow you like a dog, and take long walks  with you, and to come to you whenever you call her by whistling.    I have told you how to make your cat a good mouser, now I'll give you  another wrinkle--how to make her a good trickster--_love her_ and take  an interest in all her little performances, and you will be surprised at  the amount of tricks she will learn.
