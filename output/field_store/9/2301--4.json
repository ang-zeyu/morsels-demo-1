The bravest man turns pale when he finds himself face to  face with sudden inevitable death, and he who threatened seemed to be  one who would, without hesitation, carry out his threats. There was  nothing for it but obedience, or a ball through them as they stood.    \"What do you want with us, sir?\" asked Jeannin.    Quennebert, without changing his attitude, replied--    \"Commander de Jars, and you, Messire Jeannin de Castille, king's  treasurer,--you see, my gentles, that besides the advantage of arms  which strike swiftly and surely, I have the further advantage of knowing  who you are, whilst I am myself unknown,--you will carry the wounded man  into this house, into which I will not enter, for I have nothing to do  within; but I shall remain here; to await your return. After you have  handed over the patient to the doctor, you will procure paper and  write---now pay great attention--that on November 20th, 1658, about  midnight, you, aided by an unknown man, carried to this house, the  address of which you will give, a young man whom you call the Chevalier  de Moranges, and pass off as your nephew--\"    \"As he really is.\"    \"Very well.\"    \"But who told you--?\"    \"Let me go on: who had been wounded in a fight with swords on the same  night behind the church of Saint-Andre-des-Arts by the Duc de Vitry.\"    \"The Duc de Vitry!--How do you know that?\"    \"No matter how, I know it for a fact. Having made this declaration, you  will add that the said Chevalier de Moranges is no other than  Josephine-Charlotte Boullenois, whom you, commander, abducted four  months ago from the convent of La Raquette, whom you have made your  mistress, and whom you conceal disguised as a man; then you will add  your signature. Is my information correct?\"    De Jars and Jeannin were speechless with surprise for a few instants;  then the former stammered--    \"Will you tell us who you are?\"    \"The devil in person, if you like. Well, will you do as I order?  Supposing that I am awkward enough not to kill you at two paces, do you  want me to ask you in broad daylight and aloud what I now ask at night  and in a whisper? And don't think to put me off with a false  declaration, relying on my not being able to read it by the light of the  moon; don't think either that you can take me by surprise when you hand  it me: you will bring it to me with your swords sheathed as now. If this  condition is not observed, I shall fire, and the noise will bring a  crowd about us. To-morrow I shall speak differently from to-day: I shall  proclaim the truth at all the street corners, in the squares, and under  the windows of the Louvre. It is hard, I know, for men of spirit to  yield to threats, but recollect that you are in my power and that there  is no disgrace in paying a ransom for a life that one cannot defend.  What do you say?\"    In spite of his natural courage, Jeannin, who found himself involved in  an affair from which he had nothing to gain, and who was not at all  desirous of being suspected of having helped in an abduction, whispered  to the commander--    \"Faith! I think our wisest course is to consent.\"    De Jars, however, before replying, wished to try if he could by any  chance throw his enemy off his guard for an instant, so as to take him  unawares. His hand still rested on the hilt of his sword, motionless,  but ready to draw.    \"There is someone coming over yonder,\" he cried,--\"do you hear?\"    \"You can't catch me in that way,\" said Quennebert. \"Even were there  anyone coming, I should not look round, and if you move your hand all is  over with you.\"    \"Well,\" said Jeannin, \"I surrender at discretion--not on my own account,  but out of regard for my friend and this woman. However, we are entitle  to some pledge of your silence. This statement that you demand, once  written,--you can ruin us tomorrow by its means.\"    \"I don't yet know what use I shall make of it, gentlemen. Make up your  minds, or you will have nothing but a dead body to place--in the  doctor's hands. There is no escape for you.\"    For the first time the wounded man faintly groaned.    \"I must save her!\" cried de Jars,--\"I yield.\"    \"And I swear upon my honour that I will never try to get this woman out  of your hands, and that I will never interfere with your conquest.  Knock, gentlemen, and remain as long as may be necessary. I am patient.  Pray to God, if you will, that she may recover; my one desire is that  she may die.\"    They entered the house, and Quennebert, wrapping himself once more in  his mantle, walked up and down before it, stopping to listen from time  to time. In about two hours the commander and the treasurer came out  again, and handed him a written paper in the manner agreed on.    \"I greatly fear that it will be a certificate of death,\" said de Jars.    \"Heaven grant it, commander! Adieu, messieurs.\"    He then withdrew, walking backwards, keeping the two friends covered  with his pistols until he had placed a sufficient distance between  himself and them to be out of danger of an attack.    The two gentlemen on their part walked rapidly away, looking round from  time to time, and keeping their ears open. They were very much mortified  at having been forced to let a mere boor dictate to them, and anxious,  especially de Jars, as to the result of the wound.          CHAPTER VII      On the day following this extraordinary series of adventures,  explanations between those who were mixed up in them, whether as actors  or spectators, were the order of the day. It was not till Maitre  Quennebert reached the house of the friend who had offered to put him up  for the night that it first dawned on him, that the interest which the  Chevalier de Moranges had awakened in his mind had made him utterly  forget the bag containing the twelve hundred livres which he owed to the  generosity of the widow. This money being necessary to him, he went back  to her early next morning. He found her hardly recovered from her  terrible fright. Her swoon had lasted far beyond the time when the  notary had left the house; and as Angelique, not daring to enter the  bewitched room, had taken refuge in the most distant corner of her  apartments, the feeble call of the widow was heard by no one. Receiving  no answer, Madame Rapally groped her way into the next room, and finding  that empty, buried herself beneath the bedclothes, and passed the rest  of the night dreaming of drawn swords, duels, and murders. As soon as it  was light she ventured into the mysterious room once more; without  calling her servants, and found the bag of crowns lying open on the  floor, with the coins scattered all around, the partition broken, and  the tapestry hanging from it in shreds. The widow was near fainting  again: she imagined at first she saw stains of blood everywhere, but a  closer inspection having somewhat reassured her, she began to pick up  the coins that had rolled to right and left, and was agreeably surprised  to find the tale complete. But how and why had Maitre Quennebert  abandoned them? What had become of him? She had got lost in the most  absurd suppositions and conjectures when the notary appeared.  Discovering from the first words she uttered that she was in complete  ignorance of all that had taken place, he explained to her that when the  interview between the chevalier and Mademoiselle de Guerchi had just at  the most interesting moment been so unceremoniously interrupted by the  arrival of the duke, he had become so absorbed in watching them that he  had not noticed that the partition was bending before the pressure of  his body, and that just as the duke drew his sword it suddenly gave way,  and he, Quennebert, being thus left without support, tumbled head  foremost into the next room, among a perfect chaos of overturned  furniture and lamps; that almost before he could rise he was forced to  draw in self-defence, and had to make his escape, defending himself  against both the duke and the chevalier; that they had pursued him so  hotly, that when he found himself free he was too far from the house and  the hour was too advanced to admit of his returning, Quennebert added  innumerable protestations of friendship, devotion, and gratitude, and,  furnished with his twelve hundred crowns, went away, leaving the widow  reassured as to his safety, but still shaken from her fright.    While the notary was thus soothing the widow, Angelique was exhausting  all the expedients her trade had taught her in the attempt to remove the  duke's suspicions. She asserted she was the victim of an unforeseen  attack which nothing in her conduct had ever authorised. The young  Chevalier de Moranges had, gained admittance, she declared, under the  pretext that he brought her news from the duke, the one man who occupied  her thoughts, the sole object of her love. The chevalier had seen her  lover, he said, a few days before, and by cleverly appealing to things  back, he had led her to fear that the duke had grown tired of her, and  that a new conquest was the cause of his absence. She had not believed  these insinuations, although his long silence would have justified the  most mortifying suppositions, the most cruel doubts. At length the  chevalier had grown bolder, and had declared his passion for her;  whereupon she had risen and ordered him to leave her. Just at that  moment the duke had entered, and had taken the natural agitation and  confusion of the chevalier as signs of her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2750"],[0,"Joan of Naples (#10)"],[1,"solemn engagement in the prince's name, an  engagement to withdraw those laws that had caused coldness between the  pope and Robert; who was in general so devoted to the Church, I knew  very well that my offer would never be rejected, and this argument of  mine I kept back for the last. See, madam, my calculations are correct;  your enemies are put to shame and your son is triumphant.\"    Then turning to Andre, who was just corning in and stood dumbfounded at  the threshold on hearing the last words, he added--    \"Come, my son, our prayers are at last fulfilled: you are king.\"    \"King!\" repeated Andre, transfixed with joy, doubt, and amazement.    \"King of Sicily and Jerusalem: yes, my lord; there is no need for you to  read this document that brings the joyful, unexpected news. You can see  it in your mother's tears; she holds out her arms to press you to her  bosom; you can see it in the happiness of your old teacher; he falls on  his knees at your feet to salute you by this title, which he would have  paid for with his own blood had it been denied to you much longer.\"    \"And yet,\" said Elizabeth, after a moment's mournful reflection, \"if I  obey my presentiments, your news will make no difference to our plans  for departure.\"    \"Nay, mother,\" said Andre firmly, \"you would not force me to quit the  country to the detriment of my honour. If I have made you feel some of  the bitterness and sorrow that have spoiled my own young days because of  my cowardly enemies, it is not from a poor spirit, but because I was  powerless, and knew it, to take any sort of striking vengeance for their  secret insults, their crafty injuries, their underhand intrigues. It was  not because my arm wanted strength, but because my head wanted a crown.  I might have put an end to some of these wretched beings, the least  dangerous maybe; but it would have been striking in the dark; the  ringleaders would have escaped, and I should never have really got to  the bottom of their infernal plots. So I have silently eaten out my own  heart in shame and indignation. Now that my sacred rights are recognised  by the Church, you will see, my mother, how these terrible barons, the  queen's counsellors, the governors of the kingdom, will lower their  heads in the dust: for they are threatened with no sword and no  struggle; no peer of their own is he who speaks, but the king; it is by  him they are accused, by the law they shall be condemned, and shall  suffer on the scaffold.\"    \"O my beloved son,\" cried the queen in tears, \"I never doubted your  noble feelings or the justice of your claims; but when your life is in  danger, to what voice can I listen but the voice of fear? what can move  my counsels but the promptings of love?\"    \"Mother, believe me, if the hands and hearts alike of these cowards had  not trembled, you would have lost your son long ago.\"    \"It is not violence that I fear, my son, it is treachery.\"    \"My life, like every man's, belongs to God, and the lowest of sbirri may  take it as I turn the corner of the street; but a king owes something to  his people.\"    The poor mother long tried to bend the resolution of Andre by reason and  entreaties; but when she had spoken her last word and shed her last  tear, she summoned Bertram de Baux, chief-justice of the kingdom, and  Marie, Duchess of Durazzo. Trusting in the old man's wisdom and the  girl's innocence, she commended her son to them in the tenderest and  most affecting words; then drawing from her own hand a ring richly  wrought, and taking the prince aside, she slipped it upon his finger,  saying in a voice that trembled with emotion as she pressed him to her  heart--    \"My son, as you refuse to come with me, here is a wonderful talisman,  which I would not use before the last extremity. So long as you wear  this ring on your finger, neither sword nor poison will have power  against you.\"    \"You see then, mother,\" said the prince, smiling, \"with this protection  there is no reason at all to fear for my life.\"    \"There are other dangers than sword or poison,\" sighed the queen.    \"Be calm, mother: the best of all talismans is your prayer to God for  me: it is the tender thought of you that will keep me for ever in the  path of duty and justice; your maternal love will watch over me from  afar, and cover me like the wings of a guardian angel.\"    Elizabeth sobbed as she embraced her son, and when she left him she felt  her heart was breaking. At last she made up her mind to go, and was  escorted by the whole court, who had never changed towards her for a  moment in their chivalrous and respectful devotion. The poor mother,  pale, trembling, and faint, leaned heavily upon Andre's arm, lest she  should fall. On the ship that was to take her for ever from her son, she  cast her arms for the last time about his neck, and there hung a long  time, speechless, tearless, and motionless; when the signal for  departure was given, her women took her in their arms half swooning.  Andre stood on the shore with the feeling of death at his heart: his  eyes were fixed upon the sail that carried ever farther from him the  only being he loved in the world. Suddenly he fancied he beheld  something white moving a long way off: his mother had recovered her  senses by a great effort, and had dragged herself up to the bridge to  give a last signal of farewell: the unhappy lady knew too well that she  would never see her son again.    At almost the same moment that Andre's mother left the kingdom, the  former queen of Naples, Robert's widow, Dona Sancha, breathed her last  sigh. She was buried in the convent of Santa Maria delta Croce, under  the name of Clara, which she had assumed on taking her vows as a nun, as  her epitaph tells us, as follows:    \"Here lies, an example of great humility, the body of the sainted sister  Clara, of illustrious memory, otherwise Sancha, Queen of Sicily and  Jerusalem, widow of the most serene Robert, King of Jerusalem and  Sicily, who, after the death of the king her husband, when she had  completed a year of widowhood, exchanged goods temporary for goods  eternal. Adopting for the love of God a voluntary poverty, and  distributing her goods to the poor, she took upon her the rule of  obedience in this celebrated convent of Santa Croce, the work of her own  hands, in the year 1344, on the gist of January of the twelfth  indiction, where, living a life of holiness under the rule of the  blessed Francis, father of the poor, she ended her days religiously in  the year of our Lord 1345, on the 28th of July of the thirteenth  indiction. On the day following she was buried in this tomb.\"    The death of Dona Sancha served to hasten on the catastrophe which was  to stain the throne of Naples with blood: one might almost fancy that  God wished to spare this angel of love and resignation the sight of so  terrible a spectacle, that she offered herself as a propitiatory  sacrifice to redeem the crimes of her family.          CHAPTER IV      Eight days after the funeral of the old queen, Bertrand of Artois came  to Joan, distraught, dishevelled, in a state of agitation and confusion  impossible to describe.    Joan went quickly up to her lover, asking him with a look of fear to  explain the cause of his distress.    \"I told you, madam,\" cried the young baron excitedly, \"you will end by  ruining us all, as you will never take any advice from me.\"    \"For God's sake, Bertrand, speak plainly: what has happened? What advice  have I neglected?\"    \"Madam, your noble husband, Andre of Hungary, has just been made King of  Jerusalem and Sicily, and acknowledged by the court of Avignon, so  henceforth you will be no better than his slave.\"    \"Count of Artois, you are dreaming.\"    \"No, madam, I am not dreaming: I have this fact to prove the truth of my  words, that the pope's ambassadors are arrived at Capua with the bull  for his coronation, and if they do not enter Castel Nuovo this very  evening, the delay is only to give the new king time to make his  preparations.\"    The queen bent her head as if a thunderbolt had fallen at her feet.    \"When I told you before,\" said the count, with growing fury, \"that we  ought to use force to make a stand against him, that we ought to break  the yoke of this infamous tyranny and get rid of the man before he had  the means of hurting you, you always drew back in childish fear, with a  woman's cowardly hesitation.\"    Joan turned a tearful look upon her lover.    \"God, my God!\" she cried, clasping her hands in desperation, \"am I to  hear for ever this awful cry of death! You too, Bertrand, you too say  the word, like Robert of Cabane, like Charles of Duras? Wretched man,  why would you raise this bloody spectre between us, to check with icy  hand our adulterous kisses? Enough of such crimes; if his wretched  ambition makes him long to reign, let him be king: what matters his  power to me, if he leaves me with your love?\"    \"It is not so sure that our love will last much longer.\"    \"What is this, Bertrand? You rejoice in this merciless torture.\"    \"I tell you, madam, that the King of Naples has a black flag ready, and  on the day of his coronation it will be carried before him.\"    \"And you believe,\" said Joan, pale as a corpse in its shroud, \"--you  believe that this flag is a threat?\"    \"Ay, and the threat begins to be put in execution.\"    The queen staggered, and leaned against a table to save herself from  falling.    \"Tell me all,\" she cried in a choking voice; \"fear not to shock me; see,  I am not trembling. O Bertrand, I entreat you!\"    \"The traitors have begun with the man you most esteemed, the wisest  counsellor of the crown, the best of magistrates, the noblest-hearted,  most rigidly virtuous----\"    \"Andrea of Isernia!\"    \"Madam, he is no more.\"    Joan uttered a cry, as though the noble old man had been slain before  her eyes: she respected him as a father; then, sinking back, she  remained profoundly silent.    \""]]]
