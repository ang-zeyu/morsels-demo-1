One of the same company wished to go in his stead; Bunyan  consented to exchange with him, and this volunteer substitute, standing  sentinel one day at the siege, was shot through the head with a  musket-ball. \"This risk,\" Sir Walter Scott observes, \"was one somewhat  resembling the escape of Sir Roger de Coverley, in an action at Worcester,  who was saved from the slaughter of that action, by having been absent  from the field.\"--_Southey._           *       *       *       *       *      DROLLERY SPONTANEOUS.    More drolleries are uttered unintentionally than by premeditation. There  is no such thing as being \"droll to order.\" One evening a lady said to a  small wit, \"Come, Mr. ----, tell us a lively anecdote;\" and the poor  fellow was mute the rest of the evening.    \"Favour me with your company on Wednesday evening--you are such a lion,\"  said a weak party-giver to a young _litterateur_. \"I thank you,\" replied  the wit, \"but, on that evening I am engaged to eat fire at the Countess  of ----, and stand upon my head at Mrs. ----.\"           *       *       *       *       *      ORIGIN OF COWPER'S \"JOHN GILPIN.\"    It happened one afternoon, in those years when Cowper's accomplished  friend, Lady Austen, made a part of his little evening circle, that she  observed him sinking into increased dejection; it was her custom, on  these occasions, to try all the resources of her sprightly powers for  his immediate relief. She told him the story of John Gilpin, (which had  been treasured in her memory from her childhood), to dissipate the gloom  of the passing hour. Its effects on the fancy of Cowper had the air  of enchantment. He informed her the next morning that convulsions of  laughter, brought on by his recollection of her story, had kept him  waking during the greatest part of the night! and that he had turned  it into a ballad. So arose the pleasant poem of John Gilpin. To Lady  Austen's suggestion, also, we are indebted for the poem of \"the Task.\"           *       *       *       *       *      HARD FATE OF AUTHORS.    Sir E. B. (now Lord) Lytton, in the memoir which he  prefixed to the collected works of Laman Blanchard,  draws the following affecting picture of that author's  position, after he had parted from an engagement upon  a popular newspaper:--       \"For the author there is nothing but his pen, till that and life      are worn to the stump: and then, with good fortune, perhaps on his      death-bed he receives a pension--and equals, it may be, for a few      months, the income of a retired butler! And, so on the sudden loss      of the situation in which he had frittered away his higher and      more delicate genius, in all the drudgery that a party exacts from      its defender of the press, Laman Blanchard was thrown again upon      the world, to shift as he might and subsist as he could. His      practice in periodical writing was now considerable; his      versatility was extreme. He was marked by publishers and editors      as a useful contributor, and so his livelihood was secure. From      a variety of sources thus he contrived, by constant waste of      intellect and strength, to eke out his income, and insinuate      rather than force his place among his contemporary penmen. And      uncomplainingly, and with patient industry, he toiled on, seeming      farther and farther off from the happy leisure, in which 'the      something to verify promise was to be completed.' No time had      he for profound reading, for lengthened works, for the mature      development of the conceptions of a charming fancy. He had given      hostages to fortune. He had a wife and four children, and no      income but that which he made from week to week. The grist must      be ground, and the wheel revolve. All the struggle, all the      toils, all the weariness of brain, nerve, and head, which      a man undergoes in his career, are imperceptible even to his      friends--almost to himself; he has no time to be ill, to be      fatigued; his spirit has no holiday; it is all school-work. And      thus, generally, we find in such men that the break up of the      constitution seems sudden and unlooked-for. The causes of disease      and decay have been long laid; but they are smothered beneath the      lively appearances of constrained industry and forced excitement.\"           *       *       *       *       *      JAMES SMITH, ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF \"REJECTED ADDRESSES.\"    A writer in the _Law Quarterly Magazine_ says:--To the best of our  information, James's _coup d'essai_ in literature was a hoax in  the shape of a series of letters to the editor of the _Gentleman's  Magazine_, detailing some extraordinary antiquarian discoveries and  facts in natural history, which the worthy Sylvanus Urban inserted  without the least suspicion. In 1803, he became a constant contributor  to the _Pic-Nic_ and _Cabinet_ weekly journals, in conjunction with Mr.  Cumberland, Sir James Bland Burgess, Mr. Horatio Smith, and others. The  principal caterer for these publications was Colonel Greville, on whom  Lord Byron has conferred a not very enviable immortality--     \"Or hail at once the patron and the pile    Of vice and folly, Greville and Argyle.\"    One of James Smith's favourite anecdotes related to him. The Colonel  requested his young ally to call at his lodgings, and in the course  of their first interview related the particulars of the most curious  circumstance in his life. He was taken prisoner during the American  war, along with three other officers of the same rank; one evening they  were summoned into the presence of Washington, who announced to them  that the conduct of their Government, in condemning one of his officers  to death as a rebel, compelled him to make reprisals; and that, much to  his regret, he was under the necessity of requiring them to cast lots,  without delay, to decide which of them should be hanged. They were then  bowed out, and returned to their quarters. Four slips of paper were put  into a hat, and the shortest was drawn by Captain Asgill, who exclaimed,  \"I knew how it would be; I never won so much as a hit of backgammon in  my life.\" As Greville told the story, he was selected to sit up with  Captain Asgill, under the pretext of companionship, but, in reality, to  prevent him from escaping, and leaving the honour amongst the remaining  three. \"And what,\" inquired Smith, \"did you say to comfort him?\" \"Why, I  remember saying to him, when they left us, _D---- it, old fellow, never  mind_;\" but it may be doubted (added Smith) whether he drew much comfort  from the exhortation. Lady Asgill persuaded the French minister to  interpose, and the captain was permitted to escape.    Both James and Horatio Smith were also contributors to the _Monthly  Mirror_, then the property of Mr. Thomas Hill, a gentleman who had  the good fortune to live familiarly with three or four generations of  authors; the same, in short, with whom the subject of this memoir thus  playfully remonstrated: \"Hill, you take an unfair advantage of an  accident; the register of your birth was burnt in the great fire of  London, and you now give yourself out for younger than you are.\"    The fame of the Smiths, however, was confined to a limited circle until  the publication of the _Rejected Addresses_, which rose at once into  almost unprecedented celebrity.    James Smith used to dwell with much pleasure on the criticism of a  Leicestershire clergyman: \"I do not see why they (the _Addresses_)  should have been rejected: I think some of them very good.\" This, he  would add, is almost as good as the avowal of the Irish bishop, that  there were some things in _Gulliver's Travels_ which he could not  believe.    Though never guilty of intemperance, James was a martyr to the gout;  and, independently of the difficulty he experienced in locomotion, he  partook largely of the feeling avowed by his old friend Jekyll, who used  to say that, if compelled to live in the country, he would have the  drive before his house paved like the streets of London, and hire a  hackney-coach to drive up and down all day long.    He used to tell, with great glee, a story showing the general conviction  of his dislike to ruralities. He was sitting in the library at a  country-house, when a gentleman proposed a quiet stroll into the  pleasure-grounds:--        \"'Stroll! why, don't you see my gouty shoe?'        \"'Yes, I see that plain enough, and I wish I'd brought one too,        but they're all out now.'        \"'Well, and what then?'        \"'What then? Why, my dear fellow, you don't mean to say that you        have really got the gout? I thought you had only put on that shoe        to get off being shown over the improvements.'\"      His bachelorship is thus attested in his niece's album:     \"Should I seek Hymen's tie,    As a poet I die,      Ye Benedicts mourn my distresses:    For what little fame    Is annexed to my name,      Is derived from _Rejected Addresses_.\"    The two following are amongst the best of his good things. A gentleman  with the same Christian and surname took lodgings in the same house. The  consequence was, eternal confusion of calls and letters. Indeed, the  postman had no alternative but to share the letters equally between the  two. \"This is intolerable, sir,\" said our friend, \"and you must quit.\"  \"Why am I to quit more than you?\" \"Because you are James the Second--and  must _abdicate_.\"    Mr. Bentley proposed to establish a periodical publication, to be called  _The Wit's Miscellany_. Smith objected that the title promised too much.  Shortly afterwards, the publisher came to tell him that he had profited  by the hint, and resolved on calling it _Bentley's Miscellany_. \"Isn't  that going a little too far the other way?\" was the remark.

Hooray!  Hooray!'           .    .    .    .    .      The day wound up with booze and blow     And fights till all were well content,    But of the new-chum, all I know     Is shown by this advertisement --    'For Sale, the well-known racehorse Trap,    He won Wargeilah Handicap!'          Any Other Time          All of us play our very best game --     Any other time.    Golf or billiards, it's all the same --     Any other time.    Lose a match and you always say,    'Just my luck!  I was 'off' to-day!    I could have beaten him quite half-way --     Any other time!'      After a fiver you ought to go --     Any other time.    Every man that you ask says 'Oh,     Any OTHER time.    Lend you a fiver!  I'd lend you two,    But I'm overdrawn and my bills are due,    Wish you'd ask me -- now, mind you do --     Any other time!'      Fellows will ask you out to dine --     Any other time.

Most of us mean to be better men --     Any other time:    Regular upright characters then --     Any other time.    Yet somehow as the years go by    Still we gamble and drink and lie,    When it comes to the last we'll want to die --     Any other time!          The Last Trump          'You led the trump,' the old man said     With fury in his eye,    'And yet you hope my girl to wed!    Young man! your hopes of love are fled,     'Twere better she should die!      'My sweet young daughter sitting there,     So innocent and plump!    You don't suppose that she would care    To wed an outlawed man who'd dare     To lead the thirteenth trump!      'If you had drawn their leading spade     It meant a certain win!    But no!  By Pembroke's mighty shade    The thirteenth trump you went and played     And let their diamonds in!      'My girl!  Return at my command     His presents in a lump!    Return his ring!  For understand    No man is fit to hold your hand     Who leads a thirteenth trump!      'But hold!  Give every man his due     And every dog his day.    Speak up and say what made you do    This dreadful thing -- that is, if you     Have anything to say!'      He spoke.  'I meant at first,' said he,     'To give their spades a bump:    Or lead the hearts, but then you see    I thought against us there might be,     Perhaps, a fourteenth trump!'           .    .    .    .    .      They buried him at dawn of day     Beside a ruined stump:    And there he sleeps the hours away    And waits for Gabriel to play     The last -- the fourteenth -- trump.          Tar and Feathers              Oh! the circus swooped down        On the Narrabri town,    For the Narrabri populace moneyed are;        And the showman he smiled        At the folk he beguiled    To come all the distance from Gunnedah.          But a juvenile smart,        Who objected to 'part',    Went in 'on the nod', and to do it he        Crawled in through a crack        In the tent at the back,    For the boy had no slight ingenuity.          And says he with a grin,        'That's the way to get in;    But I reckon I'd better be quiet or        They'll spiflicate me,'        And he chuckled, for he    Had the loan of the circus proprietor.          But the showman astute        On that wily galoot    Soon dropped, and you'll say that he leathered him --        Not he; with a grim        Sort of humorous whim,    He took him and tarred him and feathered him.          Says he, 'You can go        Round the world with a show,    And knock every Injun and Arab wry;        With your name and your trade,        On the posters displayed,    The feathered what-is-it from Narrabri.'          Next day for his freak,        By a Narrabri beak,    He was jawed with a deal of verbosity;        For his only appeal        Was 'professional zeal' --    He wanted another monstrosity.          Said his worship, 'Begob!        You are fined forty bob,    And six shillin's costs to the clurk!' he says.        And the Narrabri joy,        Half bird and half boy,    Has a 'down' on himself and on circuses.          It's Grand          It's grand to be a squatter     And sit upon a post,    And watch your little ewes and lambs     A-giving up the ghost.      It's grand to be a 'cockie'     With wife and kids to keep,    And find an all-wise Providence     Has mustered all your sheep.      It's grand to be a Western man,     With shovel in your hand,    To dig your little homestead out     From underneath the sand.      It's grand to be a shearer,     Along the Darling side,    And pluck the wool from stinking sheep     That some days since have died.      It's grand to be a rabbit     And breed till all is blue,    And then to die in heaps because     There's nothing left to chew.      It's grand to be a Minister     And travel like a swell,    And tell the Central District folk     To go to -- Inverell.      It's grand to be a Socialist     And lead the bold array    That marches to prosperity     At seven bob a day.      It's grand to be an unemployed     And lie in the Domain,    And wake up every second day     And go to sleep again.      It's grand to borrow English tin     To pay for wharves and Rocks,    And then to find it isn't in     The little money-box.      It's grand to be a democrat     And toady to the mob,    For fear that if you told the truth     They'd hunt you from your job.      It's grand to be a lot of things     In this fair Southern land,    But if the Lord would send us rain,     That would, indeed, be grand!          Out of Sight          They held a polo meeting at a little country town,    And all the local sportsmen came to win themselves renown.    There came two strangers with a horse, and I am much afraid    They both belonged to what is called 'the take-you-down brigade'.      They said their horse could jump like fun, and asked an amateur    To ride him in the steeplechase, and told him they were sure,    The last time round, he'd sail away with such a swallow's flight    The rest would never see him go -- he'd finish out of sight.      So out he went; and, when folk saw the amateur was up,    Some local genius called the race 'the dude-in-danger cup'.    The horse was known as 'Who's Afraid', by Panic from 'The Fright'.    But still his owners told the jock he'd finish out of sight.      And so he did; for 'Who's Afraid', without the least pretence,    Disposed of him by rushing through the very second fence;    And when they ran the last time round the prophecy was right --    For he was in the ambulance, and safely 'out of sight'.          The Road to Old Man's Town          The fields of youth are filled with flowers,    The wine of youth is strong:    What need have we to count the hours?    The summer days are long.      But soon we find to our dismay    That we are drifting down    The barren slopes that fall away    Towards the foothills grim and grey    That lead to Old Man's Town.      And marching with us on the track    Full many friends we find:    We see them looking sadly back    For those that dropped behind.      But God forbid a fate so dread --    ALONE to travel down    The dreary road we all must tread,    With faltering steps and whitening head,    The road to Old Man's Town!          The Old Timer's Steeplechase          The sheep were shorn and the wool went down     At the time of our local racing:    And I'd earned a spell -- I was burnt and brown --    So I rolled my swag for a trip to town     And a look at the steeplechasing.      'Twas rough and ready -- an uncleared course     As rough as the blacks had found it;    With barbed-wire fences, topped with gorse,    And a water-jump that would drown a horse,     And the steeple three times round it.      There was never a fence the tracks to guard, --     Some straggling posts defined 'em:    And the day was hot, and the drinking hard,    Till none of the stewards could see a yard     Before nor yet behind 'em!      But the bell was rung and the nags were out,     Excepting an old outsider    Whose trainer started an awful rout,    For his boy had gone on a drinking bout     And left him without a rider.      'Is there not one man in the crowd,' he cried,     'In the whole of the crowd so clever,    Is there not one man that will take a ride    On the old white horse from the Northern side     That was bred on the Mooki River?'      'Twas an old white horse that they called The Cow,     And a cow would look well beside him;    But I was pluckier then than now    (And I wanted excitement anyhow),     So at last I agreed to ride him.      And the trainer said, 'Well, he's dreadful slow,     And he hasn't a chance whatever;    But I'm stony broke, so it's time to show    A trick or two that the trainers know     Who train by the Mooki River.      'The first time round at the further side,     With the trees and the scrub about you,    Just pull behind them and run out wide    And then dodge into the scrub and hide,     And let them go round without you.      'At the third time round, for the final spin     With the pace, and the dust to blind 'em,    They'll never notice if you chip in    For the last half-mile -- you'll be sure to win,     And they'll think you raced behind 'em.      'At the water-jump you may have to swim --     He hasn't a hope to clear it --    Unless he skims like the swallows"]]]
