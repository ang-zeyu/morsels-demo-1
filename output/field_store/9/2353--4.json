Where the topography  will not permit a long radius curve and the view is obstructed by an  embankment or by growing crops or other growth, it is desirable to  separate the tracks around the curve to eliminate the possibility of  accidents on the curve. This is readily accomplished if the road is  surfaced, but if it is not surfaced, the same end is accomplished by  making the earth road of ample width at the curve.    Relocations should be resorted to whenever they shorten distances or  reduce grades sufficiently to compensate for the cost.    =Intersections.=--At road intersections, it is always difficult to  design a curve that entirely meets the requirements of safety because  there is not enough room in the right-of-way, and enough additional  right-of-way must be secured to permit the proper design. It is not  necessary to provide an intersection that is adapted to high speed  traffic, where main roads cross, but, on the contrary, a design that  automatically causes traffic to slow up has distinct advantages.    Where a main route, improved with a hard surface, crosses secondary  roads, it is satisfactory to continue the paved surface across the  intersecting road at normal width and make no provision for the  intersecting road traffic other than a properly graded approach at the  intersection.    =Superelevation.=--On all curved sections of road, other than  intersections, account is taken of the tendency of motor cars to skid  toward the outside of the curve. This tendency is counteracted by  designing the cross section with superelevation.    [Illustration: Fig. 6]    In Fig. 6, _F_ represents the tangential force that tends to cause  skidding. _W_ represents the weight of the vehicle in pounds, THETA  = the angle of superelevated surface _c-d_, with the horizontal _c-a_.  _R_ represents the radius of the curve upon which the vehicle is  moving. _w_ is the component of the weight parallel to the surface  _c-d_, _v_ = velocity of the vehicle in feet per second. _m_ = mass  of vehicle = _W/g  THETA_                        _w_ = _W_ tan _THETA_                     _mv^2_     _wv^2_         _F_ =  -------  =  ------                  _R_        _gR_    If _F_ = _w_ there will be no tendency to skid; hence the rate of  superelevation necessary in any case is as follows:                               _Wv^2_        _W_ tan _THETA_ = -------                            _gR_                                _v^2_            tan _THETA_ = -------                            _gR_      The amount of superelevation required, therefore, varies as the square  of the velocity and inversely as the radius of the curve.    Theoretically, the amount of the superelevation should increase with a  decrease in the radius of the curve and should also increase as the  square of the speed of the vehicle. On account of the variation in  speeds of the vehicles, the superelevation for curves on a highway can  only be designed to suit the average speed. At turns approaching  ninety degrees, the curve is likely to be of such short radius that it  is impossible to maintain the ordinary road speed around the curve,  even with the maximum superelevation permissible. It is good practice  to provide the theoretical superelevation on all curves having radii  greater than 300 feet for vehicle speeds of the maximum allowed by  law, which is generally about 25 miles per hour. Where the radii are  less than 300 feet, the theoretical superelevation for the maximum  vehicle speeds gives a superelevation too great for motor trucks and  horse drawn vehicles and generally no charge is made in superelevation  for radii less than 300 feet, but all such curves are constructed with  the same superelevation as the curve with 300 foot radius.    The diagram in Fig. 7 shows the theoretical superelevation for various  curve radii.    [Illustration: Fig. 7. Curves showing Theoretical Superelevation for  Various Degrees of Curve for Various Speeds of Vehicle]    At the intersection of important highways, the problem is complicated  by the necessity for providing for through traffic in both directions  and for traffic which may turn in either direction and the engineer  must provide safe roadways for each class of traffic.    =Tractive Resistance.=--The adoption of a policy regarding the grades  on a road involves an understanding of the effect of variation in the  character of the surface and in rate of grade upon the energy required  to transport a load over the highway. The forces that oppose the  movement of a horse drawn vehicle are fairly well understood and their  magnitude has been measured by several observers, but comparatively  little is known about the forces opposing translation of rubber tired  self-propelled vehicles.    The resistance to translation of a vehicle is made up of three  elements: resistance of the road surface to the rolling wheel,  resistance of the air to the movement of the vehicle and internal  friction in the vehicle itself.    =Rolling Resistance.=--When the wheel of a vehicle rolls over a road  surface, both the wheel and the surface are distorted. If the wheel  has steel tires and the road surface is plastic, there will be  considerable distortion of the road surface and very little of the  wheel. A soft rubber tire will be distorted considerably by a brick  road surface. Between these extremes there are innumerable  combinations of tire and road surface encountered, but there is always  a certain amount of distortion of either road surface or wheel, or of  both, which has the same effect upon the force necessary for  translation as a slight upward grade. When both the tire and the road  surface strongly resist distortion (as steel tires on vitrified brick  paving), the resistance to translation is low but the factor of impact  is likely to be introduced. Where impact is present, energy is used up  in the pounding and grinding of the wheels on the surface, and this  factor increases as the speed of translation, and may be a  considerable item. Impact is especially significant on rough roads  with motor vehicles, particularly trucks, traveling at high speed.  These two factors (impact and rolling resistance) combined constitute  the major part of the resistance to translation for horse drawn  vehicles.    =Internal Resistance.=--For horse drawn vehicles, the internal  resistance consists of axle friction, which is small in amount. For  self-propelled vehicles, the internal resistance consists of axle  friction and friction in the driving mechanism, of which gear  friction and the churning of oil in the gear boxes is a large item.  Internal friction is of significance in all self-propelled vehicles  and especially so at high speeds.    =Air Resistance.=--At slow speeds, the resistance of still air to  translation is small, but as the speed increases, the air resistance  increases rapidly and at the usual speed of the passenger automobile  on the road becomes a very considerable part of the total resistance  to translation. This factor has no significance in connection with  horse drawn vehicles, but is to be taken into account when dealing  with self-propelled vehicles at speeds in excess of five miles per  hour.    Many determinations of tractive resistance with horse drawn vehicles  have been made from time to time and these show values that are fairly  consistent when the inevitable variations in surfaces of the same type  are taken into account.

So with the molecules of matter. In  large masses they appear to be inert, and to do nothing, and to be  capable of doing nothing. That is only due to the fact that their energy  is undirected, not that they can do nothing. The inference that if  quiescent bodies do not act in particular ways they are inert, and  cannot act in any kind of a way, is a wrong inference. An illustration  may perhaps make this point plainer. A lump of coal will be still as  long as anything if it be undisturbed. Indeed, it has thus lain in a  coal-bed for millions of years probably, but if coal be placed where it  can combine with oxygen, it forthwith does so, and during the process  yields a large amount of energy in the shape of heat. One pound of coal  in this way gives out 14,000 heat units, which is the equivalent of  11,000,000 foot-pounds of work, and if it could be all utilized would  furnish a horse-power for five and a half hours. Can any inert body  weighing a pound furnish a horse-power for half a day? And can a body  give out what it has not got? Are gunpowder and nitro-glycerine inert?  Are bread and butter and foods in general inert because they will not  push and pull as a man or a horse may? All have energy, which is  available in certain ways and not in others, and whatever possesses  energy available in any way is not an ideally inert body. Lastly, how  many inert bodies together will it take to make an active body? If the  question be absurd, then all the phenomena witnessed in bodies, large or  small, are due to the fact that the atoms are not inert, but are  immensely energetic, and their inertia is the measure of their rates of  exchanging energy.      THE ETHER IS CONDITIONALLY POSSESSED OF INERTIA.    A moving mass of matter is brought to rest by friction, because it  imparts its motion at some rate to the body it is in contact with.  Generally the energy is transformed into heat, but sometimes it appears  as electrification. Friction is only possible because one or both of the  bodies possess inertia. That a body may move in the ether for an  indefinite time without losing its velocity has been stated as a reason  for believing the ether to be frictionless. If it be frictionless, then  it is without inertia, else the energy of the earth and of a ray of  light would be frittered away. A ray of light can only be transformed  when it falls upon molecules which may be heated by it. As the ether  cannot be heated and cannot transform translational energy, it is  without inertia for _such_ a form of motion and its embodied energy.    It is not thus with other forms of energy than the translational. Atomic  and molecular vibrations are so related to the ether that they are  transformed into waves, which are conducted away at a definite rate.  This shows that such property of inertia as is possessed by the ether is  selective and not like that of matter, which is equally \"inertiative\"  under all conditions. Similarly with electric and magnetic phenomena, it  is capable of transforming the energy which may reside as stress in the  ether, and other bodies moving in the space so affected meet with  frictional resistance, for they become heated if the motion be  maintained. On the other hand, there is no evidence that the body which  produced the electric or magnetic stress suffers any degree of friction  on moving in precisely the same space. A bar magnet rotating on its  longitudinal axis does not disturb its own field, but a piece of iron  revolving near the magnet will not only become heated, but will heat the  stationary magnet. Much experimental work has been done to discover, if  possible, the relation of a magnet to its ether field. As the latter is  not disturbed by the rotation of the magnet, it has been concluded that  the field does not rotate; but as every molecule in the magnet has its  own field independent of all the rest, it is mechanically probable that  each such field does vary in the rotation, but among the thousands of  millions of such fields the average strength of the field does not vary  within measurable limits. Another consideration is that the magnetic  field itself, when moved in space, suffers no frictional resistance.  There is no magnetic energy wasted through ether inertia. These  phenomena show that whether the ether exhibits the quality called  inertia depends upon the kind of motion it has.      18. MATTER IS MAGNETIC.    The ordinary phenomenon of magnetism is shown by bringing a piece of  iron into the neighbourhood of a so-called magnet, where it is attracted  by the latter, and if free to move will go to and cling to the magnet. A  delicately suspended magnetic needle will be affected appreciably by a  strong magnet at the distance of several hundred feet. As the strength  of such action varies inversely as the square of the distance from the  magnet, it is evident there can be no absolute boundary to it. At a  distance from an ordinary magnet it becomes too weak to be detected by  our methods, not that there is a limit to it. It is customary to think  of iron as being peculiarly endowed with magnetic quality, but all kinds  of matter possess it in some degree. Wood, stone, paper, oats, sulphur,  and all the rest, are attracted by a magnet, and will stick to it if the  magnet be a strong one. Whether a piece of iron itself exhibits the  property depends upon its temperature, for near 700 degrees it becomes  as magnetically indifferent as a piece of copper at ordinary  temperature. Oxygen, too, at 200 degrees below the zero of Centigrade  adheres to a magnet like iron.    In this as in so many other particulars, how a piece of matter behaves  depends upon its temperature, not that the essential qualities are  modified in any degree, but temperature interferes with atomic  arrangement and aggregation, and so disguises their phenomena.    As every kind of matter is thus affected by a magnet, the manifestations  differing but in degree, it follows that all kinds of atoms--all the  elements--are magnetic. An inherent property in them, as much so as  gravitation or inertia; apparently a quality depending upon the  structure of the atoms themselves, in the same sense as gravitation is  thus dependent, as it is not a quality of the ether.    An atom must, then, be thought of as having polarity, different  qualities on the two sides, and possessing a magnetic field as extensive  as space itself. The magnetic field is the stress or pressure in the  ether produced by the magnetic body. This ether pressure produced by a  magnet may be as great as a ton per square inch. It is this pressure  that holds an armature to the magnet. As heat is a molecular condition  of vibration, and radiant energy the result of it, so is magnetism a  property of molecules, and the magnetic field the temporary condition in  the ether, which depends upon the presence of a magnetic body. We no  longer speak of the wave-motion in the ether which results from heat, as  heat, but call it radiation, or ether waves, and for a like reason the  magnetic field ought not to be called magnetism.      THE ETHER IS NON-MAGNETIC.    A magnetic field manifests itself in a way that implies that the ether  structure, if it may be said to have any, is deformed--deformed in such  a sense that another magnet in it tends to set itself in the plane of  the stress; that is, the magnet is twisted into a new position to  accommodate itself to the condition of the medium about it. The new  position is the result of the reaction of the ether upon the magnet and  ether pressure acting at right angles to the body that produced the  stress. Such an action is so anomalous as to suggest the propriety of  modifying the so-called third law of motion, viz., action and reaction  are equal and opposite, adding that sometimes action and reaction are at  right angles.    There is no condition or property exhibited by the ether itself which  shows it to have any such characteristic as attraction, repulsion, or  differences in stress, except where its condition is modified by the  activities of matter in some way. The ether itself is not attracted or  repelled by a magnet; that is, it is not a magnetic body in any such  sense as matter in any of its forms is, and therefore cannot properly be  called magnetic.    It has been a mechanical puzzle to understand how the vibratory motions  called heat could set up light waves in the ether seeing that there is  an absence of friction in the latter. In the endeavour to conceive it,  the origin of sound-waves has been in mind, where longitudinal air-waves  are produced by the vibrations of a sounding body, and molecular impact  is the antecedent of the waves. The analogy does not apply. The  following exposition may be helpful in grasping the idea of such  transformation and change of energy from matter to the ether.    Consider a straight bar permanent magnet to be held in the hand. It has  its north and south poles and its field, the latter extending in every  direction to an indefinite distance. The field is to be considered as  ether stress of such a sort as to tend to set other magnets in it in new  positions. If at a distance of ten feet there were a delicately-poised  magnet needle, every change in the position of the magnet held in the  hand would bring about a change in the position of the needle. If the  position of the hand magnet were completely reversed, so the south pole  faced where the north pole faced before, the field would have been  completely reversed, and the poised needle would have been pushed by the  field into an opposite position. If the needle were a hundred feet away,  the change would have been the same except in amount. The same might be  said if the two were a mile apart, or the distance of the moon or any  other distance, for there is no limit to an ether"]]]
