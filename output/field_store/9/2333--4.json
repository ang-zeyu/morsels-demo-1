One other cloud fact--their dissipation as the sun rises high in the  heavens--is noticed in one of the most tender and pathetic passages in  all the prophetic Scriptures. The Lord, by the mouth of Hosea, is  mourning over the instability of His people. \"O Ephraim, what shall I do  unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? For your goodness is as a  morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.\"    The winds of heaven were considered as four in number, corresponding to  our own four \"cardinal points.\" Thus the great horn of Daniel's he-goat  was broken and succeeded by four notable horns toward the four winds of  heaven; as the empire of Alexander the Great was divided amongst his  four generals. In Ezekiel's vision of the dry bones the prophet prays,  \"Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain;\" and  Jeremiah foretells that \"the four winds from the four quarters of  heaven\" shall be brought upon Elam, and scatter its outcasts into every  nation.    The circulation of the winds is clearly set forth by the Preacher in the  Book of Ecclesiastes.         \"The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the       north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth       again according to his circuits.\"    Of the four quarters, the Hebrews reckoned the east as first. It was to  the east that they supposed themselves always looking. The chief word  for east, therefore, _kedem_, means \"that which is before,\" \"the front\";  and the word next in use is, naturally, _mizrach_, the rising of the  sun. The west is, as naturally, _meb[=o] hasshemesh_, the going down of  the sun; but as the Mediterranean Sea lay to the westward of Palestine  \"the sea\" (_yam_) is frequently put instead of that point of the  compass. With the east in front, the south becomes the right, and the  north the left. The south also was _negeb_, the desert, since the desert  shut in Palestine to the south, as the sea to the west. In opposition to  _tsaphon_, the dark or hidden north, the south is _darom_, the bright  and sunny region.    The phrase \"four corners of the earth\" does not imply that the Hebrews  thought of the earth as square. Several expressions on the contrary show  that they thought of it as circular. The Lord \"sitteth upon the circle  of the earth,\" and in another passage the same form is applied to the  ocean. \"He set a compass (_margin_ circle) upon the face of the depth.\"  This circle is no doubt the circle of the visible horizon, within which  earth and sea are spread out apparently as a plain; above it \"the vault  of heaven\" (Job xxii. 14; R.V. _margin_) is arched. There does not  appear to be allusion, anywhere in Scripture, to the spherical form of  the earth.    The Hebrew knowledge of the extent of the terrestrial plain was of  course very limited, but it would seem that, like many other nations of  antiquity, they supposed that the ocean occupied the outer part of the  circle surrounding the land which was in the centre. This may be  inferred from Job's statement--         \"He hath described a boundary upon the face of the waters,        Unto the confines of light and darkness.\"    The boundary of the world is represented as being \"described,\" or more  properly \"circumscribed,\" drawn as a circle, upon the ocean. This ocean  is considered as essentially one, exactly as by actual exploration we  now know it to be;--\"Let the waters under the heaven be gathered  together unto one place;\"--all the oceans and seas communicate.    Beneath the earth there are the waters. The Lord hath founded the world  \"upon the seas, and established it upon the floods,\" and (Psalm cxxxvi.  6) \"stretched out the earth above the waters.\" This for the most part  means simply that the water surface lies lower than the land surface.  But there are waters,--other than those of the ocean,--which are, in a  strict sense, beneath the earth; the subterranean waters, which though  in the very substance of the earth, and existing there in an altogether  different way from the great masses of water we see upon the surface,  form a water system, which may legitimately be termed a kind of ocean  underground. From these subterranean waters our springs issue forth, and  it is these waters we tap in our wells. Of the cedar in Lebanon Ezekiel  spoke: \"The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her  rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers  (_margin_, conduits) unto all the trees of the field.\" The \"deep,\"  _teh[=o]m_, applies therefore, not merely to the restless waters of the  ocean, but to these unseen waters as well; and means, not merely  \"surging waters,\" but depths of any kind. When in the great Deluge the  floodgates of heaven were opened, these \"fountains of the great deep  were broken up\" as well. And later both fountains and windows were  \"stopped.\" So the Lord asks Job, \"Hast thou entered into the springs of  the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?\" and in  Proverbs it is said of the Lord, \"By His knowledge the depths are broken  up, and the clouds drop down the dew.\"    The tides upon the sea-coast of Palestine are very slight, but some have  seen a reference to them in Jer. v. 22 where the Lord says, I \"have  placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it  cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can  they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it.\" More  probably the idea to be conveyed is merely that of the restraint of the  sea to its proper basin, as in the passage where the Lord asks Job, \"Who  shut up the sea with doors when it brake forth, as if it had issued out  of the womb?\" And the writer of Proverbs sums all up:--         \"When He prepared the heavens I [Wisdom] was there: when He       set a compass upon the face of the depth: when He established       the clouds above: when He strengthened the fountains of the       deep: when He gave to the sea His decree, that the waters       should not pass His commandment: when He appointed the       foundations of the earth.\"      FOOTNOTES:    [41:1] _Astronomy in the Old Testament_, p. 33 note.

CHAPTER V    THE ORDINANCES OF THE HEAVENS      As has been already pointed out, the astronomical references in  Scripture are not numerous, and probably give but an inadequate idea of  the actual degree of progress attained by the Hebrews in astronomical  science. Yet it is clear, even from the record which we have, that there  was one great astronomical fact which they had observed, and that it had  made a deep impression upon them.    That fact was the sublime Order of the heavenly movements. First amongst  these was the order of the daily progress of the sun; rising in the east  and moving slowly, majestically, and resistlessly upward to the  meridian,--the \"midst\" or \"bisection\" of heaven, of Josh. x. 13,--and  then passing downwards as smoothly and unfalteringly to his setting in  the west.    This motion of the sun inspires the simile employed by the Psalmist in  the astronomical psalm, the nineteenth. He sings--         \"The heavens declare the glory of God.               *       *       *       *       *          In them hath He set a tabernacle for the sun,        Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,        And rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course.        His going forth is from the end of the heaven,        And his circuit unto the ends of it:        And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.\"    The night revealed another Order, in its way more majestic still. As the  twilight faded away the bright and silent watchers of the heavens  mustered each in his place. And each, like the sun during the day, was  moving, slowly, majestically, resistlessly, \"without haste, without  rest.\" Each had its appointed place, its appointed path. Some moved in  small circles in the north; some rose in the east, and swept in long  curves over towards their setting in the west, some scarcely lifted  themselves above the southern horizon. But each one kept its own place.  None jostled another, or hurried in advance, or lagged behind. It is no  wonder that as the multitude of the stars was observed, and the unbroken  order of their going, that the simile suggested itself of an army on the  march--\"the host of heaven.\" And the sight of the unbroken order of  these bright celestial orbs suggested a comparison with the unseen army  of exalted beings, the angels; the army or host of heaven in another  sense, marshalled, like the stars, in perfect obedience to the Divine  will. So in the vision of Micaiah, the son of Imlah, the \"host of  heaven\" are the thousands of attendant spirits waiting around the throne  of God to fulfil His bidding.         \"I saw the Lord sitting on His throne, and all the host of       heaven standing by him on His right hand and on His left.\"    But more frequently it is the starry, not the angelic, army to which  reference is made.    So Jeremiah prophesies--         \"As the host of heaven cannot be numbered,        Neither the sand of the sea measured:        So will I multiply the seed of David My servant,        And the Levites that minister unto Me.\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28540"],[0,"Bibliomania; or Book-Madness (#10)"],[1,"'s       Tewrkdrancs_, 1527, _Brandt's Stultifera Navis_, 1498, and       the _Aldine Petrarch_ of 1501, ALL UPON VELLUM. The large       paper _Olivet's Cicero_ was purchased by Dr. Askew for L14       14_s._ and was sold again at his sale for L36 15_s._ The       King of France bought the editio princeps of _Pliny Senr._       for L11 11_s._; and Mr. Willock, a bookseller, bought the       magnificently illuminated _Pliny by Jenson_ of 1472, for L18       18_s._: of which Maittaire has said so many fine things. The       _French_ books, and all the works upon the _Fine Arts_, were       of the first rarity, and value, and bound in a sumptuous       manner. Winstanley's _Prospects of Audley End_ brought L50.       An amusing account of some of the pictures will be found in       Mr. Beloe's \"_Anecdotes of Literature and Scarce Books_,\"       vol. i. 166. 71. But consult also _Nichol's Anecdotes of       Bowyer_, p. 225, &c. Of the catalogue of Dr. Mead's books       there were only six copies printed on LARGE PAPER. See Bibl.       Lort, no. 1149.]    The years 1755-6 were singularly remarkable for the mortality excited  by the BIBLIOMANIA; and the well known names of Folkes,[39] and  Rawlinson,[40] might have supplied a modern Holbein a hint for the  introduction of a new subject in the \"_Dance of Death_.\" The close of  George the Second's reign witnessed another instance of the fatality  of this disease. Henley[41] \"bawled till he was hoarse\" against the  cruelty of its attack; while his library has informed posterity how  severely and how mortally he suffered from it.         [Footnote 39: \"A Catalogue of the entire and valuable       library of MARTIN FOLKES, ESQ., President of the Royal       Society, and member of the Royal Academy of Sciences at       Paris, lately deceased; which will be sold by auction by       Samuel Baker, at his house, in York Street, Covent Garden.

Catalogues to be       had at most of the considerable places in Europe, and all       the booksellers of Great Britain and Ireland, Price       Sixpence.\"         This collection was an exceedingly fine one; enriched with       many books of the choicest description, which Mr. Folkes had       acquired in his travels in Italy and Germany. The works on       natural history, coins, medals, and inscriptions, and on the       fine arts in general, formed the most valuable       department--those in the Greek, Latin and English classics,       were comparatively of inferior importance. It is a great       pity the catalogue was not better digested; or the books       classed according to the nature of their contents.         The following prices, for some of the more rare and       interesting articles, will amuse a bibliographer of the       present day. The chronicles of Fabian, Hall, and Grafton,       did not altogether bring quite L2: though the copies are       described as perfect and fair. There seems to have been a       fine set of Sir Wm. Dugdale's Works (Nos. 3074-81) in 13       vols. which, collectively, produced about 30 guineas.         In _Spanish literature_, the history of South America, By       Don Juan and Ant. di Ulloa, Madr. fol. in 5 vols., was sold       for L5: a fine large paper copy of the description of the       Monastery of St. Lorenzo, and the Escorial, Madr. 1657,       brought L1 2_s._: de Lastanosa's Spanish Medals, Huesca,       fol. 1645, L2 2_s._         In _English_, the first edition of Shakespeare, 1623, which       is now what a French bibliographer would say \"presque       introuvable,\" produced the sum of L3 3_s._; and Fuller's       Worthies, 18_s._!         _Fine Arts, Antiquities, and Voyages._ Sandrart's works, in       9 folio volumes (of which a fine perfect copy is now rarely       to be met with, and of very great value) were sold for L13       13_s._ only: Desgodetz Roman edifices, Paris, 1682, L4       10_s._: Galleria Giustiniano, 2 vols., fol. L13 13_s._ Le       Brun's Voyages in Muscovy, &c., in large paper, L4 4_s._ De       Rossi's Raccolta de Statue, &c. Rom. 1704, L6 10_s._       Medailles du Regne de Louis le Grand, de l'imp. Roy. 1. p.       fol. 1702, L5 15_s._ 6_d._         The works on _Natural History_ brought still higher prices;       but the whole, from the present depreciation of specie, and       increased rarity of the articles, would now bring thrice the       sums then given.         Of the _Greek and Latin Classics_, the Pliny of 1469 and       1472 were sold to Dr. Askew for L11 11_s._ and L7 17_s._       6_d._ At the Doctor's sale they brought L43 and L23:       although the first was lately sold (A.D. 1805) among some       duplicates of books belonging to the British Museum, at a       much lower price: the copy was, in fact, neither large nor       beautiful. Those in the Hunter and Cracherode collections       are greatly superior, and would each bring more than double       the price.         From a priced copy of the sale catalogue, in my possession,       I find that the amount of the sale, consisting of 5126       articles, was L3091 5_s._         The _Prints and Drawings_ of Mr. Folkes occupied a sale of 8       days; and his _pictures_, _gems_, _coins_, and _mathematical       instruments_, of five days.         Mr. MARTIN FOLKES may justly be ranked among the most       useful, as well as splendid, literary characters of which       this country can boast. He appears to have imbibed, at a       very early age, an extreme passion for science and       literature; and to have distinguished himself so much at the       University of Cambridge, under the able tuition of Dr.       Laughton, that, in his 23rd year, he was admitted a Fellow       of the Royal Society. About two years afterwards he was       chosen one of the council, and rose, in gradual succession,       to the chair of the presidentship, which he filled with a       credit and celebrity that has since never been surpassed. On       this occasion he was told by Dr. Jurin, the Secretary, who       dedicated to him the 34th vol. of the Transactions, that       \"the greatest man that ever lived (Sir Isaac Newton) singled       him out to fill the chair, and to preside in the society,       when he himself was so frequently prevented by       indisposition: and that it was sufficient to say of him that       he was _Sir Isaac's friend_.\"         Within a few years after this, he was elected President of       the Society of Antiquaries. Two situations, the filling of       which may be considered as the _ne plus ultra_ of literary       distinction. Mr. Folkes travelled abroad, with his family,       about two years and a half, visiting the cities of Rome,       Florence, and Venice--where he was noticed by almost every       person of rank and reputation, and whence he brought away       many a valuable article to enrich his own collection. He was       born in the year 1690, and died of a second stroke of the       palsy, under which he languished for three years, in 1754.       Dr. Birch has drawn a very just and interesting character of       this eminent man, which may be found in Nichol's _Anecdotes       of Bowyer_, 562. 7. Mr. Edwards, the late ornithologist, has       described him in a simple, but appropriate, manner. \"He       seemed,\" says he, \"to have attained to universal knowledge;       for, in the many opportunities I have had of being in his       company, almost every part of science has happened to be the       subject of discourse, all of which he handled as an adept.       He was a man of great politeness in his manners, free from       all pedantry and pride, and, in every respect, the real       unaffected fine gentleman.\"]         [Footnote 40: \"BIBLIOTHECA RAWLINSONIANA, sive Catalogus       Librorum Richardi Rawlinson, LL.D.

On       examining a priced catalogue of it, which now lies before       me, I have not found any higher sum offered for a work than       L4 1_s._ for a collection of fine prints, by Aldegrave (No.       9405). The Greek and Latin classics, of which there were few       _Editiones Principes_, or on _large paper_, brought the       usual sums given at that period. The old English       black-lettered books, which were pretty thickly scattered       throughout the collection, were sold for exceedingly low       prices--if the copies were perfect.
