The delicate nerves of  sight felt a sharp pain, and begged to have the pupils made as small as  possible and the eyelid curtains put down.    But the foolish boys said \"No.\" They were trying to see which would bear  it the longest. Great harm was done to the brains as well as eyes of  both these boys. The one who looked longest at the sun died in  consequence of his foolish act.    The second story is about a little boy who tried to turn his eyes to  imitate a schoolmate who was cross-eyed. He turned them; but he could  not turn them back again. Although he is now a gentleman more than fifty  years old and has had much painful work done upon his eyes, the doctors  have never been able to set them quite right.    You see from the first story, that you must be careful not to give your  eyes too much light. But you must also be sure to give them light  enough.    When one tries to read in the twilight, the little nerve of sight says:  \"Give me more light; I am hurt, by trying to see in the dark.\"    If you should kill these delicate nerves, no others would ever grow in  place of them, and you would never be able to see again.      THE EARS.    What you call your ears are only pieces of gristle, so curved as to  catch the sounds and pass them along to the true ears. These are deeper  in the head, where the nerve of hearing is waiting to send an account  of each sound to the brain.      CARE OF THE EARS.    The ear nerve is in less danger than that of the eye. Careless children  sometimes put pins into their ears and so break the \"drum.\" That is a  very bad thing to do. Use only a soft towel in washing your ears. You  should never put any thing hard or sharp into them.    I must tell you a short ear story, about my father, when he was a small  boy.    One day, when playing on the floor, he laid his ear to the crack of the  door, to feel the wind blow into it. He was so young that he did not  know it was wrong; but the next day he had the earache severely.  Although he lived to be an old man, he often had the earache. He thought  it began from the time when the wind blew into his ear from under that  door.      ALCOHOL AND THE SENSES.    All this fine work of touching, tasting, seeing, smelling, and hearing,  is nerve work.    The man who is in the habit of using alcoholic drinks can not touch,  taste, see, smell, or hear so well as he ought. His hands tremble, his  speech is sometimes thick, and often he can not walk straight.  Sometimes, he thinks he sees things when he does not, because his poor  nerves are so confused by alcohol that they can not do their work.    Answer now for your taste, smell, and touch, and also for your sight and  hearing; should their beautiful work be spoiled by alcohol?      REVIEW QUESTIONS.              1.

WHAT MAKES US WARM?    \"[Illustration: M]Y thick, warm clothes make me warm,\" says some child.    No! Your thick, warm clothes keep you warm. They do not make you warm.    Take a brisk run, and your blood will flow faster and you will be warm  very quickly.    On a cold day, the teamster claps his hands and swings his arms to make  his blood flow quickly and warm him.    Every child knows that he is warm inside; for if his fingers are cold,  he puts them into his mouth to warm them.    If you should put a little thermometer into your mouth, or under your  tongue, the mercury (m[~e]r'ku r[)y]) would rise as high as it does out  of doors on a hot, summer day.    This would be the same in summer or winter, in a warm country or a cold  one, if you were well and the work of your body was going on steadily.      WHERE DOES THIS HEAT COME FROM?    Some of the work which is all the time going on inside your body, makes  this heat.    The blood is thus warmed, and then it carries the heat to every part of  the body. The faster the blood flows, the more heat it brings, and the  warmer we feel.    In children, the heart pumps from eighty to ninety times a minute.    This is faster than it works in old people, and this is one reason why  children are generally much warmer than old people.    But we are losing heat all the time.    You may breathe in cold air; but that which you breathe out is warm. A  great deal of heat from your warm body is all the time passing off  through your skin, into the cooler air about you. For this reason, a  room full of people is much warmer than the same room when empty.      CLOTHING.    We put on clothes to keep in the heat which we already have, and to  prevent the cold air from reaching our skins and carrying off too much  heat in that way.    Most of you children are too young to choose what clothes you will wear.  Others decide for you. You know, however, that woolen under-garments  keep you warm in winter, and that thick boots and stockings should be  worn in cold weather. Thin dresses or boots may look pretty; but they  are not safe for winter wear, even at a party.    A healthy, happy child, dressed in clothes which are suitable for the  season, is pleasanter to look at than one whose dress, though rich and  handsome, is not warm enough for health or comfort.    When you feel cold, take exercise, if possible. This will make the hot  blood flow all through your body and warm it. If you can not, you should  put on more clothes, go to a warm room, in some way get warm and keep  warm, or the cold will make you sick.      TAKING COLD.    If your skin is chilled, the tiny mouths of the perspiration tubes are  sometimes closed and can not throw out the waste matter. Then, if one  part fails to do its work, other parts must suffer. Perhaps the inside  skin becomes inflamed, or the throat and lungs, and you have a cold, or  a cough.      ALCOHOL AND COLD.    People used to think that nothing would warm one so well on a cold day,  as a glass of whiskey, or other alcoholic drink.    It is true that, if a person drinks a little alcohol, he will feel a  burning in the throat, and presently a glowing heat on the skin.    The alcohol has made the hot blood rush into the tiny tubes near the  skin, and he thinks it has warmed him.    But if all this heat comes to the skin, the cold air has a chance to  carry away more than usual. In a very little time, the drinker will be  colder than before. Perhaps he will not know it; for the cheating  alcohol will have deadened his nerves so that they send no message to  the brain. Then he may not have sense enough to put on more clothing and  may freeze. He may even, if it is very cold, freeze to death.    People, who have not been drinking alcohol are sometimes frozen; but  they would have frozen much quicker if they had drunk it.    Horse-car drivers and omnibus drivers have a hard time on a cold winter  day. They are often cheated into thinking that alcohol will keep them  warm; but doctors have learned that it is the water-drinkers who hold  out best against the cold. Alcohol can not really keep a person warm.    All children are interested in stories about Arctic explorers, whose  ships get frozen into great ice-fields, who travel on sledges drawn by  dogs, and sometimes live in Esquimau huts, and drink oil, and eat walrus  meat.    These men tell us that alcohol will not keep them warm, and you know  why.    The hunters and trappers in the snowy regions of the Rocky Mountains say  the same thing. Alcohol not only can not keep them warm; but it lessens  their power to resist cold.    [Illustration: _Scene in the Arctic regions._]    Many of you have heard about the Greely party who were brought home from  the Arctic seas, after they had been starving and freezing for many  months.    There were twenty-six men in all. Of these, nineteen died. Seven were  found alive by their rescuers; one of these died soon afterward. The  first man who died, was the only one of the party who had ever been a  drunkard.    Of the nineteen who died, all but one used tobacco. Of the six now  living,--four never used tobacco at all; and the other two, very seldom.    The tobacco was no real help to them in time of trouble. It had probably  weakened their stomachs, so that they could not make the best use of  such poor food as they had.      REVIEW QUESTIONS.              1.

Beside it he had built a snug log-barn, stored with hay from  the wild meadow. The hay he had made that August, being smitten with a  desire for some touch of the civilization to which as a whole he could  not reconcile himself. Then, with a still enthusiasm, he had built his  barn, chinking its crevices scrupulously with moss and mud. He had  resolved to have a cow. The dream that gave new zest to all his waking  hours was the fashioning of a little farm in this sunny, sheltered  space about his cabin. He had grown somewhat weary of living by trap  and snare and gun, hunting down the wild creatures whom he had come to  regard, through lapse of the long, solitary years by the Quah-Davic,  as in some sense comrade and kin to him.    It was late autumn, and the asters fading out like smoke along the  river edges, when the barn was finished and the hay safe stored  therein. Then the old woodsman journeyed out to the settlement to buy  his cow. He found one exactly to his whimsical liking,--a small, dark  red, long-horned scrub, with a look in her big, liquid eyes that made  him feel she would know how to take care of herself in the perilous  wilds. He equipped her with the most sonorous and far-sounding bell he  could find in all the settlement. Then proudly he led her away to her  new domain in the wilderness.    When the long-horned little cow had been salted and foddered in the  new barn, and when her liquid eyes had taken in the surroundings of  the sunny little meadow and cabin by the lonely Quah-Davic, she was  well enough content, and the mellow _tunk-a-tonk, tank tonk_ of her  bell was sounded never out of ear-shot from the cabin. The meadow and  the nearest fringes of the woods were range enough for her. Of the  perils that might lurk in the further depths she had a wary  apprehension. And the old woodsman, busy grubbing out a narrow cellar  under his cabin, was happy in his purchase. The _tunk-a-tonk_ of the  mellow bell was sweetest music in his ears as he worked.    Now it chanced that that autumn was one of unusual drought. In the  channel of the Quah-Davic rocks appeared which the old woodsman had  never seen before. The leaves fell early, before half their wonted  gamut of colour was run through. They wore a livery of pallid  tones--rusty-reds, cloudy light violets, grayish thin golds, ethereal  russets--under a dry, pale sky. The only solid, substantial colouring  was that of the enduring hemlocks and the sombre, serried firs. Then  there came a mistiness in the air, making the noonday sun red and  unradiant And the woodsman knew that there were forest fires somewhere  up the wind.    A little anxious, he studied the signs minutely, and concluded that,  the wind being light, the fires were too far distant to endanger the  Quah-Davic region. Thereupon he decided to make a hurried trip to the  settlement for a sack of middlings and other supplies, planning to  return by night, making the round trip within the twenty-four hours in  order that the little red cow should not miss more than one milking.    On the afternoon of the woodsman's going, however, the wind freshened  into a gale, and the fires which had been eating leisurely way through  the forest were blown into sudden fury. That same evening a hurricane  of flame swept down upon the lonely cabin and the little wild meadow,  cutting a mile-wide swath through the woods, jumping the Quah-Davic,  and roaring on to the north. It was days before the woodsman could get  back along the smoking, smouldering trail, through black, fallen  trunks and dead roots which still held the persistent fire in their  hearts. Of cabin and barn, of course, there was nothing left at all,  save the half-dug cellar and the half-crumbled chimney. Sick at heart  and very lonely, he returned to the settlement, and took up his new  abode on a half-reclaimed farm on the outskirts, just where the tilth  and the wilderness held each other at bay.    The red cow, meanwhile, being shrewd and alert, had escaped the  conflagration. She had taken alarm early, having seen a fire in the  woods once before and conceived an appreciation of its powers. Instead  of flying straight before it, and being inevitably overtaken, she ran  at once to the river and galloped madly down the shallow margin.  Before the flames were actually upon her, she was beyond the zone of  their fury. But she felt the withering blast of them, and their  appalling roar was in her ears. With starting eyes and wide,  palpitating nostrils, she ran on and on, and stopped only when she  sank exhausted in a rude cove. There she lay with panting sides and  watched far behind her the wide red arc of terror drawn across the  sky.    The next day she wandered some miles farther down the Quah-Davic, till  she came to a neighbourhood where the water-meadows were strung  thickly along the stream and where the pasturage, though now dry and  untasty, was abundant. Back from the water-meadows was a region of low  hills covered with a second growth of young birches and poplars. Among  the hills were ravines thick with hemlock and spruce. Here she  established herself, and at night, either because she missed the  narrow quarters of her stable, or because some wild instinct within  her led her to adapt herself quickly to the ways of the wild kindred,  she would make her lair in the deepest and most sheltered of the  ravines, where a peculiarly dense hemlock veiled the front of an  overhanging rock. This retreat was almost as snug as her old stable;  and, lying down with her long horns toward the opening, she felt  comparatively secure. As a matter of fact, though all these woods of  the Quah-Davic were populous with the furtive folk, the little red cow  saw few signs of life. She was surrounded, wherever she moved, by a  wide ring of resentful solitude. The inexplicable _tunk-a-tonk,  tunk, tonk_ of her deep-throated bell was disquieting to all the  forest kindred; and the least move of her head at night was enough to  keep the most interested prowler at a distance from the lair behind  the hemlock. There was not a bear, a wolf, or a panther on the  Quah-Davic (there was but a single pair of panthers, indeed, within a  radius of fifty miles!) that cared to investigate the fighting  qualities of this keen-horned red creature with the inexplicable  voice.    Till the snow fell deep, covering the dry grass on the meadows, the  little cow throve well enough. But when the northern winter had fairly  settled in, and the great white stillness lay like sleep upon the  ancient wood, and the fir-trees, with their cloaking of snow, were so  many spires and domes and pinnacles of glittering marble under the icy  sunlight, then the wanderer would have starved if she had not chanced  to be both resourceful and indomitable. From her lair under the  hemlock, which was sheltered from all winds, her deeply trodden trail  led both to the meadows and the birchen hill-slopes. She could paw her  way down to the deep-buried grasses; but it took so much digging to  uncover a few poor and unsatisfying mouthfuls that she could never  have kept herself alive in this fashion. Being adaptable, however, she  soon accustomed herself to browsing on the slimmest of the birch and  poplar twigs, and so, having proved herself one of the fittest, she  survived. When the late, reluctant spring brought the first green of  sprouting grasses to the meadows of the Quah-Davic, it found the red  cow a mere bag of bones, indeed, but still alive, and still presenting  an undaunted pair of horns to a still distrusted world.    Into this unfriendly world, when the painted trilliums and the purple  wake-robins were dotting every half-exposed glade, was born a sturdy  bull-calf. His sire was a handsome black half-breed Durham which had  been brought into the settlement the previous summer for the  improvement of the scrubby backwoods stock. The calf was jet-black in  colour. As he grew, he soon began to show hints of his sire's broad  forehead and massive fore-quarters. He had his mother's large,  half-wild, discriminating eyes; and his legs, soon throwing off the  straddling awkwardness of calfhood, developed his mother's almost  deer-like activity.    The summer passed uneventfully for the pair of aliens in the  wilderness. With abundant pasturage on the Quah-Davic water-meadows,  they had no occasion to wander into the perils of the deep wood; and  the little red cow had none of that prevision of wild mothers, which  leads them to instruct their young in the two great vital points of  woodcraft,--the procuring of food and the avoiding of enemies. She  herself knew little woodcraft save what she and the calf were  absorbing together, unconsciously, day by day. For the time they  needed none, their food being all about them, their enemies kept at  bay by the ceaseless _tunk-a-tonk_ of the mellow bell. Thus it came  about that to the black bull-calf the wilderness seemed almost empty  of life, save for the birds, the insects, the squirrels, and the fish  leaping in the pool. To all these the bell was a matter of  indifference.    Once only, late in the autumn, did he get a glimpse of the old  Quah-Davic panther. He and his mother were lying in the sun by the  meadow's edge, comfortably chewing the cud, when the long, tawny  beast, following their trail with more curiosity than hunger, came  upon them suddenly, and stopped short about twenty paces distant. The  little red cow, recognizing the most dangerous of all her possible  enemies, had sprung to her feet with a bellow and lowered her defiant  horns. Thereupon, the panther had slunk off with a whipped look and a  drooping tail; and the little black bull conceived a poor opinion of  panthers. But it was the sudden _tonk-tonking_ of the bell, not the  challenge of his redoubtable mother, that had put the fierce-eyed  prowler to flight.    It was much the same with the bears, who were"]]]
