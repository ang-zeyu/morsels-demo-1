JULES GAILHABAUD is now producing at  Paris a work of high value to the architect and antiquary. Many years  spent in travels and special studies, and an extensive collection of  interesting documents, qualify him beyond all contemporaries for such an  undertaking. He treats not merely the architecture of the middle ages,  but sculpture, mural painting, painting on glass, mosaic work, bronzes,  iron work, the furniture of churches, &c. The book is to be published in  fifteen parts, quarto, with engravings on steel, or colored lithographs.  Eight parts are already published, containing remarkable specimens of  the Carlovingian, Roman, and _Renaissance_ architecture, a Templars'  church, Moorish buildings, &c. The whole, when finished, will cost, at  Paris, from sixty to one hundred dollars, according to the kind of paper  on which the engravings are printed.           *       *       *       *       *    AMONG the periodical publications of Italy, the _Rivista Italiana_, a  monthly review issued at Turin, occupies a high place. Its list of  writers includes Mancini, Balbo, d'Ayala, Carracciolo, Farini, &c.  Subjects of the first importance are treated with marked ability in its  pages. Its political tendencies are toward constitutional monarchy.           *       *       *       *       *    A correspondent of the _Athenaeum_ says that an extraordinary and  valuable collection of letters illustrative of the life, writings and  character of the poet Pope has just \"turned unexpectedly up,\"--and has  been secured by Mr. John Wilson Croker for his new edition of the poet's  works. The collection consists of a series of letters addressed by Pope  to his coadjutor Broome--of copies of Broome's replies--and of many  original letters from Fenton (Pope's other coadjutor in the Odyssey),  also addressed to Broome.           *       *       *       *       *    LORD BROUGHAM gave notice some six months ago, of his intention to visit  the United States, during the present month of February, but if it is  true, as stated in the Liverpool _Albion_, that he has lost his sight  (partly in consequence of some painful bodily infirmity with which he  has some time been afflicted), he of course will not come.           *       *       *       *       *    OF ALICE CAREY'S ballad entitled \"Jessie Carol,\" printed in the last  number of the _International_, J. G. Whittier says, in the _Era_, that  \"it has the rich tone and coloring and heart-reaching pathos and  tenderness of the fine old ballads of the early days of English  literature.\" Miss Carey is passing the winter in New-York, where a poem  by her is in press, which one of the most eminent and time-honored  literary men in America has declared to be, in all the best elements of  poetry, decidedly superior to any work yet published from the hand of a  woman.           *       *       *       *       *    MRS. THERESE ADOLPHINE LOUISE ROBINSON, the wife of the distinguished  Professor and traveller, is best known in the literary world under the  name of _Talvi_, and is indisputably one of the most prominent of the  few profoundly learned and intellectual women of the age. She is the  daughter of the German savan, L. H. Jacob, who was long a Professor at  Halle, where she was born on the 26th of January, 1797. In 1806, her  father was called to a professorship at the Russian University of  Charkow. Here the family remained for five years, and the daughter,  though deprived of the advantages of a regular education, laid the  foundation of that acquaintance with the Slavonic languages and  literature, which she has since so profitably and honorably cultivated.  During this time she wrote her first poems, songs full of the girl's  longing for her German home, which the strange half Asiatic environment  of Southern Russia rendered by contrast only dearer and more attractive.  In 1811 her father was transferred to St. Petersburg, and there her  studies were necessarily confined to the modern languages. But her own  industry was intense and incessant; she devoted a great deal of time to  historical reading, and privately cultivated her poetic talent. Her mind  pursued the same direction, when, in 1816, her father returned to Halle,  where she first made herself mistress of the Latin. Though her friends  beset her to give some of her productions to the public, she long  resisted. Meanwhile she wrote several tales, which were published at  Halle in 1825, under the title of _Psyche_, with Talvi as the name of  the author. This pseudonym is composed of the initials of Mrs.  Robinson's maiden name. In 1822, she translated Walter Scott's  _Covenanters_ and _Black Dwarf_, under the name of Ernst Berthold. About  this time there fell into her hands a review, by Jacob Grimm, of the  collection of Servian popular songs, published by Mark Stephanowich.  This increased her interest in that literature to such a degree, that  she determined to learn the Servian language. Hence arose the  translation of _Popular Songs of the Servians_, which, with the aid of  some Servian friends, she brought out at Halle, in 1825-6, in two  volumes. In 1828, she became the wife of Professor Robinson, and after a  long journey with him in different parts of the old world, came to  America. Here she was for some time engaged in the study of the  aboriginal languages, and prepared a translation into German of  Pickering's Work on the Indian tongues of North America, which was  published at Leipzic, in 1834. At the same time, she wrote in English a  work entitled _Historical View of the Slavic Languages_, which was  published in this country, in 1834, and translated into German, by Karl  von Olberg, in 1837. This work gives evidence of most remarkable  literary attainments. In 1837 she again visited Europe with her husband  and children, and remained in Germany till 1840. During this time she  wrote and published at Leipzic, in German, an _Attempt at a Historical  Characterization of the Popular Songs of the Germanic Nations, with a  Review of the Songs of the extra-European Races_. This is a work of a  most comprehensive character, and fills up a deficiency which was  constantly becoming more apparent, in the direction opened by Herder. It  evinces an unprejudiced and catholic mind, a just, poetic, sensible,  clear and secure understanding, as well as the most extensive and  thorough acquirements. Before her return to America she also published,  in German, a small work on _The Falseness of the Songs of Ossian_. An  article from her pen, entitled _From the History of the First  Settlements in the United States_, published in 1845 in Rumei's  _Historiches Taschenbuch_, is also worthy of notice. In 1847 she brought  out at Leipzic, a historical work on the _Colonization of New England_,  which has received the deserved applause of all the German critics, and  which abundantly merits a translation into English. An elaborate  reviewal of it appeared lately in the \"Bibliotheca Sacra,\" in which  justice was rendered to its character for research and judicious  handling. In 1849 she published in New-York, with a preface by Dr.  Robinson, a _Historical Review of the Languages and Literature of the  Slavic Nations; with a Sketch of their Popular Poetry_. It is in one  volume, from the press of Mr. Putnam, and it has been generally admitted  that there is not in any language so complete and attractive an epitome  of the literature and various idioms of the great Sclavonic Nations,  north and south. Last year Mrs. Robinson gave to the world (through the  Appletons) a novel, entitled _Heloise_, in which there are admirable  pictures of social life in one of the minor capitals of Germany, and a  very able one of the administration of the Russian government in the  Caucasian provinces, and of the nature of Caucasian warfare. The last  work (just published by the same house), is _Life's Discipline, a Tale  of the Civil Wars of Hungary_. As a tale it is to us more interesting  than _Heloise_, and it has no less freshness of incident, scenery and  character. Though Mrs. Robinson's distinction is for scholarship and  judgment, rather than for invention, these works entitle her to a very  high rank among the female novel writers.           *       *       *       *       *    MRS. H. C. KNIGHT (we believe of Portsmouth in New-Hampshire) has just  given to the public a very interesting \"New Memoir of Hannah More, or  Life in Hall and Cottage.\" It is a book of genuine merit, displaying in  a pleasing style the most striking scenes in the history of one of the  noblest of the women of England.

HACKETT, of the Trenton Theological Institution, has in  press a \"Philological and Exegetical Commentary on the Acts of the  Apostles,\" which will be published in the spring. It will embrace  various critical discussions in an appendix.           *       *       *       *       *    MADAME ANITA GEORGE, the authoress of the very clever books entitled  \"Memoirs of the Queens of Spain\" (recently published by Baker &  Scribner), is not, as some suppose, an American, though she began and  has thus far advanced upon her literary life in this country. She is a  native of Spain, and is the daughter of a French gentleman--an officer  of the Empire--who married there. Her early life was passed in Cuba,  where her father settled when she was about three years of age. In her  seventeenth year she was married to Mr. George, who is an Englishman.    When Mr. FENIMORE COOPER published his Life of Commodore Perry, which  the sober second thought of the people endorses as entirely candid and  just, we remember that it was urged by the Philadelphia critics (who  constitute a class, as much as the Philadelphia lawyers do), that even  if every thing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26198"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 2 (of 8) (#10)"],[1,"Scott Chisholme and the Imperial Light Horse, the  Natal Volunteer Artillery with six guns, supported by half a battalion  of the Manchesters, with railway and telegraph construction companies,  started in the direction occupied by the enemy on the preceding day.  General French's orders were simple and explicit, namely, to clear the  neighbourhood of Elandslaagte of the enemy and to cover the construction  of the railway and telegraph lines. The troops slowly proceeded along a  low tableland which terminated in a cliff. On a plain below this cliff  lay the station and village of Elandslaagte, and round and about this  settlement mounted Boers were swarming. These no sooner espied the  British than they made off as fast as their nimble steeds could carry  them, ascending in the direction of a high kopje some 5000 yards away.  Those who remained in the station were fired on by our Volunteer  Battery, while a squadron under Major Sampson moved round to the north  of them.    [Illustration: POSITION OF FORCES BEFORE THE BATTLE OF ELANDSLAAGTE,  NOON]    The first two shells caused considerable consternation among the  Dutchmen, but they were soon returned with interest. Though the enemy  used smokeless explosives, their battery was revealed by the yellow  flash of the guns in the purple shadow of the hill. These guns were  worked with marvellous accuracy, but, fortunately, many of the  shells--fired with percussion fuses--dug deep into the sand before  bursting. The Volunteer Battery found their own guns so inferior to  those of the enemy that there was little chance of silencing them, and  General French, seeing there was no question of occupying Elandslaagte  with the small force at his disposal, moved his guns back towards his  armoured train, telephoned to Sir George White, and withdrew in the  direction of Modder's Spruit. There he awaited reinforcements from  Ladysmith. These at 11 o'clock began to appear: One squadron of the 5th  Dragoon Guards, one squadron of the 5th Lancers under Colonel King, and  two batteries of artillery, the latter having come out at a gallop with  double teams. Then the infantry arrived under Colonel Ian Hamilton, the  second half-battalion of the Manchester Regiment, a battalion of the  Devonshire Regiment under Major Park, and five companies of the Gordon  Highlanders under Lieutenant-Colonel Dick-Cunyngham, V.C.    At 3.30 P.M. General White arrived on the scene, but the executive  command of the troops engaged remained in the hands of General French.  The Boers were discovered to be magnificently posted on a  horseshoe-shaped ridge about 800 feet above the level of the railway to  north of the Ladysmith-Dundee road, standing almost at a right angle  from the permanent way, though some 2000 yards removed from it. On the  side nearing the railroad the ridge was crowned with a peaked kopje,  which hill was connected by a nek with another eminence of the same  kind. These hills were held by the enemy, while their laager was  situated on the connecting ridge. The position was strewn on both flanks  by very rough boulders which afforded excellent cover. On the main hill  were three big guns strongly posted at three different points so as to  command a wide expanse of country and leave a retreat open over the  hills in the direction of Wessel's Nek. Facing the ridge was a wide  expanse of veldt rising upwards in the direction of Ladysmith.    At four--an unusually late hour for the commencement of hostilities--the  first gun boomed out; the range was 4400 yards. A few moments of furious  cannonading, then the enemy's guns ceased to reply. The silence enabled  the artillerymen to turn their attention on a party of the foe who were  annoying them with a persistent rifle-fire on the right flank at a range  of 2000 yards. It was an admirable corrective, and the Boer  sharpshooters retired discomfited. Meanwhile the infantry had been  brought up in preparatory battle formation of small columns covered by  scouts. The position of the infantry was then as follows:--    The first battalion Devonshire Regiment, with a frontage of 500 yards  and a depth of 1300 yards, was halted on the western extremity of a  horseshoe-shaped ridge. The opposite end of this ridge, which was  extremely rugged and broken, was held by the enemy in force. The first  battalion Manchester Regiment had struck the ridge fully 1000 yards to  the south-east, just at the point where it begins to bend round  northwards. The second battalion Gordon Highlanders were one mile in  rear.    [Illustration: LIEUT.-GENERAL J. D. P. FRENCH.    Photo by Lambert Weston & Son, Folkestone.]    Now, no sooner had the Devonshire Regiment commenced to move forward  than they attracted the shell of the enemy, but owing to the loose  formation adopted, the loss at this time was slight. In spite of the  furious fire, the regiment still pushed on to within 900 yards of the  position, and then opening fire, held the enemy in front of them till 6  P.M. The batteries also advanced and took up a position on a ridge  between the Devonshire and Manchester Regiments, about 3200 yards from  the enemy. Then began an animated artillery duel, the roar of guns  mingling with the thunder of heaven, which at this juncture seemed to  have attuned itself to suit the stormy state of the human tempest that  was raging below. At this period considerable damage was done. Captain  Campbell, R.A., was wounded, an ammunition waggon overturned, and many  men and horses were killed or injured. For some time the interchange of  deadly projectiles was pursued with vigour, then the 42nd Field Battery  came into action. The Imperial Light Horse now moved left of the enemy's  position; some mounted Boers at once pushed out and engaged them. Soon  after this the guns from above ceasing firing, our gunners turned their  attention to the mounted Boers, who rapidly fell back. Then, as the sun  was setting and dark clouds were rolling over the heavens and screening  the little light that remained, the infantry pressed forward. The plan  was that while the Devonshire Regiment made a frontal attack, the  Manchester Regiment, supported by the Gordons with the Imperial Light  Horse on the right, were to advance along the sloping ridge, turn the  enemy's flank and force him back on his main position. This movement was  to be supported by the artillery, which was to close in as the attack  developed.    The Devons, under Major Park, marched out, as said, leading the way  across the plateau and into the valley coolly and deliberately, though  under a terrific fire from above. The Boer guns, which were served with  great courage, invariably gave tongue on the smallest provocation, and  the ground was ploughed up in every direction with bursting shell. But  fortunately few of the gallant Devons were hit. Later on they drew  nearer the position, and the regiment, halted under cover of convenient  ant-hills, and opened fire. The rifles of the enemy were not slow to  reply. Their Mauser bullets whirred like swarms of bees around the heads  of the plucky fellows, who, heedless of them, dauntlessly advanced to  within some 350 yards of the summit of the hill. There they awaited the  development of the flank attack.    Meanwhile the Manchesters, with the Imperial Light Horse and the  Gordons, were winding round the lower steeps, the Gordons bearing to the  right through a cutting in the hills. Here, ascending, they came under  the artillery fire of the enemy, the Boers having moved their guns.  Shells, and not only shells but huge boulders, dropped among the  advancing troops, crushing and mutilating, and leaving behind a streak  of mangled bodies. But though the ordeal was terrible, and the sound and  sight of wounded and bleeding were enough to paralyse the stoutest  heart, the ever \"gay\" Gordons plodded on, passing higher and higher,  while their officers leading, cheered and roared them up the precipitous  ascent. Thus they clambered and plodded, with men dropping dead at their  elbows, with torn and fainting comrades by their sides. A storm of rain  from the gathering thunderclouds drenched them through to the skin, but  they heeded it not. A storm of bullets from the Boers sensibly  diminished their numbers, but they never swerved. Then their gallant  commander fell. Colonel Dick-Cunyngham, the honoured and beloved, was  shot in two places. Several other dashing Scottish officers were  wounded, but many still heroically stumbled and reeled over the  boulders, some even waving their helmets to pretend they were unhurt,  and to encourage their companions to the great, the final move....    At last the signal for the charge was sounded. The bugle blared out and  was echoed and re-echoed. Then came flash of bayonet and sound of  cheering throats, the rush of Devons, Manchesters, Gordons, and  dismounted Imperials--a wild, shouting mass making straight for the  enemy's position.    To account for the presence of the Devons in the grand melee it is  necessary to go back somewhat, as the great assault was not accomplished  in a moment.    Our men were advancing in short rushes of about fifty yards, the Boers  all the while lying under cover and shooting till the troops were within  some twenty or thirty yards of them. Then the Dutchmen, as suited their  convenience, either bolted or surrendered.    When the end ridge was gained and the guns captured, the enemy's laager  was close in sight. A white flag was shown from the centre of the camps.  At this Colonel Hamilton gave an order. The \"Cease fire\" was sounded.  There was a lull in the action, some of our men commencing to walk  slowly down-hill towards the camp. Suddenly, without warning, the  crackle of musketry was heard, and a deadly fire poured from a small  sugar-loaf shaped kopje to east of the camp. For one short moment our  men, staggered by the dastardly action and the fierce suddenness of the  attack, fell back, and during"]]]
