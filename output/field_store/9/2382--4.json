[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31162"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 5, No. 3, March, 1852 (#10)"],[1," and last       volume contains the legal arguments and addresses to the jury,       the diplomatic papers, and letters addressed to various persons       on important political questions.         \"The collection does not embrace the entire series of Mr.       Webster's writings. Such a series would have required a larger       number of volumes than was deemed advisable with reference to       the general circulation of the work. A few juvenile       performances have accordingly been omitted, as not of       sufficient importance or maturity to be included in the       collection. Of the earlier speeches in Congress, some were       either not reported at all, or in a manner too imperfect to be       preserved without doing injustice to the author. No attempt has       been made to collect from the cotemporaneous newspapers or       Congressional registers, the short conversational speeches and       remarks made by Mr. Webster, as by other members of Congress,       in the progress of debate, and sometimes exercising greater       influence on the result than the set speeches. Of the addresses       to public meetings it has been found impossible to embrace more       than a selection, without swelling the work to an unreasonable       size. It is believed, however, that the contents of these       volumes furnish a fair specimen of Mr. Webster's opinions and       sentiments on all the subjects treated, and of his manner of       discussing them. The responsibility of deciding what should be       omitted and what included, has been left by Mr. Webster to the       friends having the charge of the publication, and his own       opinion on details of this kind has rarely been taken.\"    This incompleteness, we think, will be regretted by all the parties most  deeply interested, as well as by the public generally. Mr. Webster does  not often repeat himself, and no man who has said or written so much has  said or written so little that is undeserving a place in literature or  in history. The next paragraph introduces us to Mr. Webster's  birthplace, and to his father:         \"The interval between the peace of 1763 and the breaking out of       the war of the Revolution, was one of excitement and anxiety       throughout the Colonies. The great political questions of the       day were not only discussed in the towns and cities, but in the       villages and hamlets. Captain Webster took a deep interest in       those discussions. Like so many of the officers and soldiers of       the former war, he obeyed the first call to arms in the new       struggle. He commanded a company chiefly composed of his own       townspeople, friends, and kindred, who followed him through the       greater portion of the war. He was at the battle of White       Plains, and was at West Point when the treason of Arnold was       discovered. He acted as a Major under Stark at Bennington, and       contributed his share to the success of that eventful day. In       the last year of the Revolutionary war on the 18th of January,       1782, Daniel Webster was born, in the home which his father had       established on the outskirts of civilization. If the character       and situation of the place, and the circumstances under which       he passed the first year of his life, might seem adverse to the       early cultivation of his extraordinary talent, it still cannot       be doubted that they possessed influences favorable to       elevation and strength of character. The hardships of an infant       settlement and border life, the traditions of a long series of       Indian wars, and of two mighty national contests, in which an       honored parent had borne his part, the anecdotes of Fort       William Henry, of Quebec, of Bennington, of West Point, of       Wolfe, and Stark, and Washington, the great Iliad and Odyssey       of American Independence,--this was the fireside entertainment       of the long winter evenings of the secluded village home.       Abroad, the uninviting landscape, the harsh and craggy outlines       of the hills broken and relieved only by the funereal hemlock       and the 'cloud-seeking' pine, the lowlands traversed in every       direction by unbridged streams, the tall, charred trunks in the       cornfields, that told how stern had been the struggle with the       boundless woods, and, at the close of the year, the dismal       scene which presents itself in high latitudes in a thinly       settled region, when             'The snows descend; and, foul and fierce,           All winter drives along the darkened air'--         these are circumstances to leave an abiding impression on the       mind of a thoughtful child, and induce an early maturity of       character.\"    Of his early professional life, and of some of his contemporaries, Mr.  Everett says:         \"Immediately on his admission to the bar, Mr. Webster went to       Amherst, in New Hampshire, where his father's court was in       session; from that place he went home with his father. He had       intended to establish himself at Portsmouth, which, as the       largest town and the seat of the foreign commerce of the State,       opened the widest field for practice. But filial duty kept him       nearer home. His father was now infirm from the advance of       years, and had no other son at home. Under these circumstances       Mr. Webster opened an office at Boscawen not far from his       father's residence, and commenced the practice of the law in       this retired spot. Judge Webster lived but a year after his       son's entrance upon the practice of his profession; long       enough, however, to hear his first argument in court, and to be       gratified with the confident predictions of his future success.         \"In May, 1807, Mr. Webster was admitted an attorney and       counsellor of the Superior Court in New Hampshire, and in       September of that year, relinquishing his office in Boscawen to       his Brother Ezekiel, he removed to Portsmouth, in conformity       with his original intention. Here he remained in the practice       of his profession for nine successive years. They were years of       assiduous labor, and of unremitted devotion to the study and       practice of the law. He was associated with several persons of       great eminence, citizens of New Hampshire or of Massachusetts,       occasionally practising at the Portsmouth bar. Among the latter       were Samuel Dexter and Joseph Storey; of the residents of New       Hampshire, Jeremiah Mason was the most distinguished.         \"During the greater part of Mr. Webster's practice of the law       in New Hampshire, Jeremiah Smith was Chief Justice of the       state, a learned and excellent judge, whose biography has been       written by the Rev. John H. Morrison, and will well repay       perusal. Judge Smith was an early and warm friend of Judge       Webster, and this friendship descended to the son, and glowed       in his breast with fervor till he went to his grave. Although       dividing with Mr. Mason the best of the business of Portsmouth,       and indeed of all the eastern portion of the State, Mr.       Webster's practice was mostly on the circuit. He followed the       Superior Court through the principal counties of the state, and       was retained in nearly every important cause. It is mentioned       by Mr. March, as a somewhat singular fact in his professional       life, that, with the exception of the occasions on which he has       been associated with the Attorney-General of the United States       for the time being, he has hardly appeared ten times as junior       counsel. Within the sphere in which he was placed, he may be       said to have risen at once to the head of his profession; not,       however, like Erskine and some other celebrated British       lawyers, by one and the same bound, at once to fame and       fortune. The American bar holds forth no such golden prizes,       certainly not in the smaller states. Mr. Webster's practice in       New Hampshire, though probably as good as that of any of his       contemporaries, was never lucrative. Clients were not very       rich, nor the concerns litigated such as would carry heavy       fees. Although exclusively devoted to his profession, it       afforded him no more than a bare livelihood. But the time for       which he practised at the New Hampshire bar was probably not       lost with reference to his future professional and political       eminence. His own standard of legal attainment was high. He was       associated with professional brethren fully competent to put       his powers to their best proof, and to prevent him from       settling down in early life into an easy routine of ordinary       professional practice. It was no disadvantage under these       circumstances (except in reference to immediate pecuniary       benefit), to enjoy some portion of that leisure for general       reading, which is almost wholly denied to the lawyer of       commanding talents, who steps immediately into full practice in       a large city.\"    The memoir, which extends through nine chapters, comprising a survey of  the intellectual and political life of Mr. Webster, down to the last  year, ends as follows:         \"Such, in a brief and imperfect narrative, is the public life       of Mr. Webster, extending over a period of forty years, marked       by the occurrence of events of great importance. It has been       the aim of the writer to prevent the pen of the biographer from       being too much influenced by the partiality of the friend.       Should he seem to the candid not wholly to have escaped that       error, (which, however, he trusts will not be the case,) he       ventures to hope that it will be forgiven to an intimacy which       commenced in the youth of one of the parties and the boyhood of       the other, and which has subsisted for nearly half a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31219"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#10)"],[1,"ntley, to teach the school. He came from Anderson's Creek  in the lower part of Harnett County. We learned very little, as the  nigger read, and let us repeat it after him. He would hold the book,  and spell and let us repeat the words after him without lettin' us see  in the book. He stayed there two months, then a man by the name of  Matthews, Haywood Matthews, son of Henderson Matthews came. They were  white folks, but went for negroes. Haywood teached there. He got the  children started and most of 'em learned to read and write.    \"I saw the Yankees come through. Also Wheeler's Cavalry. The Yankees  took chickens and things, and they gave us some things, but Wheeler's  Cavalry gave us nothin'. They took what they wanted and went on.  Marster hid his horses and things in the Pecosin.    \"When the Yankees came Marster was hid. They rode up to my mother and  asked her where he was. She said, 'I do not know.' They then asked her  where was de silver, his money, an' de brandy, an' wine. They got one  demijohn full o' brandy. They went into the house, tore up things got  his china pipe, fixed for four people to smoke at one time. You could  turn a piece and shett off all de holes but one, when one man wanted to  smoke. They threw away his old beaver hat, but before they left they  got it and left it in the house. Wheeler's Cavalry stomped things and  broke up more den de Yankees.    \"Daddy hid marster's money, a lot of it, in the jam o' de fence. He  covered it with sand that he threw out of a ditch that ran along near  the fence. The Yankees stopped and sat on the sand to eat their dinner  and never found the money.    \"I have never seen a slave sold, and none never ran away from marster's  plantation. When any of his men went to visit their wives he let them  ride the stock, and give them rations to carry. There was a jail for  slaves at Summerville. I saw it.    \"We went to the white folks church at Neill's Creek. Mother used herbs  to give us when we were sick. Dr. Turner, Dr. John Turner, looked after  us. We were bled every year in the spring and in the fall. He had a  little lance. He corded your arm and popped it in, and the blood would  fly. He took nearly a quart of blood from grandma. He bled according to  size and age.    \"We ought to think a lot o' Abraham Lincoln and the other great men  such as Booker T. Washington. Lincoln set us free.

Andrews          FRANK MAGWOOD      \"I was born in Fairfield County, South Carolina, near the town of  Ridgeway. Ridgeway was on the Southern Railroad from Charlotte, N.C. to  Columbia, South Carolina. I was born Oct. 10, 1864. I belonged to Nora  Rines whose wife was named Emma. He had four girls Frances, Ann,  Cynthia, and Emma and one son named George. There was about one  thousand acres of land inside the fences with about two hundred acres  cleared. There were about seventy slaves on the place. My mother and  father told me these things. Father belonged to a man by the name of  John Gosey and mother belonged to ole man Rines. My father was named  Lisbon Magwood and my mother was named Margaret Magwood. They were sold  and resold on the slave auction block at Charleston, South Carolina,  but the families to whom they belonged did not change their names until  mother's name was changed when she married father in 1862.    \"There were twelve children in the family, three boys and nine girls.  Only two boys of this family are living, Walter and myself.    \"Mother and father said at the beginning of the war that the white  folks said it would not last long and that in the first years of the  war they said one southern soldier could whup three Yankee soldiers,  but after awhile they quit their braggin. Most everything to eat and  wear got scarce. Sometimes you couldn't git salt to go in the  vegetables and meat that was cooked. People dug up the salty earth  under their smoke houses, put water with it, drained it off and used it  to salt rations.    \"There came stories that the Yankees had taken this place and that they  were marching through Georgia into South Carolina. They burned  Columbia, the Capitol of South Carolina, and had both whites and black  scared, they were so rough. The Yankees stole, burned, and plundered.  Mother said they hated South Carolina cause they started the war there.  They burned a lot of the farm houses. The army, so my father and mother  said, was stretched out over a distance of sixty-two miles. Jest think  of a scope of country sixty two miles wide with most of the buildings  burned, the stock killed, and nothing to eat. The southern army and the  northern army had marched back and forth through the territory until  there was nothing much left. Where Sherman's army stopped and ate and  fed their horses the Negroes went and picked up the grains of corn they  strowed there and parched and ate them. People also parched and ate  acorns in South Carolina.    \"Father and mother got together after the war and they moved to a  widow lady's place by the name of Ann Hunter, near Ridgeway. She was  good to us and we stayed there sixteen years. Ann Hunter had three  sons, Abraham, George and Henry. Abraham went to South America on a  rambling trip. He decided to stay there. He was a young man then and he  married a Spaniard. When he came home to see his mother it was the year  of the earthquake in 1886. He was a grown man then and he brought his  wife and children with him. He had three children, all of them spoke  Spanish and could not understand their grandmother's talk to them. His  wife was a beautiful woman, dark with black hair and blue eyes. She  just worshipped her husband. They stayed over a month and then returned  to South America. I have never seen 'em since or had any straight news  of them.    \"Mother and father lived on the farm until they died, with first one  ex-slave owner and another. They said they had nothing when the war  ended and that there was nothing to do.    \"I stayed with my mother and father near Ridgeway until I was 21 years  of age. I left the farm then and went to work on the railroad. I  thought I was the only man then. I was so strong. I worked on the  railroad one year then I went to the Stone mountain Rock Quarry in  Georgia.    \"I got my hand injured with a dynamite cap after I had worked there a  year and I came home again. I went back to working on the farm as a day  hand. I worked this way for one year then I began share croppin'.    \"I farmed ever since I came to Wake County 15 years ago. I farmed on  Mr. Simpkins place one year then Mr. Dillon bought the place and I  stayed there nine more years then I became so near blind I could not  farm. I came to Raleigh to this house four years ago. I have been  totally blind since the fifteenth of last December.    \"I married Alice Praylor near Ridgeway when I was 23 years of age. We  had nine children.    \"My last marriage was to Mamie Williams. I married her in South  Carolina. We had four children. They are all living, grown and married  off. My chief worry over being blind is the fact that it makes me  unable to farm anymore.\"    LE          N.C. District:        No. 2  Worker:               T.

De son an' one daughter live  in N.C. an de other daughter lives in Richmond, Va.    \"I belonged to Col. Bun Eden. His plantation wus in Warren County an'  he owned 'bout fifty slaves or more. Dere wus so many of 'em dere he  did not know all his own slaves. We got mighty bad treatment an' I jest  wants to tell you a nigger didn't stan' as much show dere as a dog did.

He  did not do any work but drank a lot of whiskey, went dressed up all de  time an had niggers to wash his feet an comb his hair. He made me  scratch his head when he lay down so he could go to sleep. When he got  to sleep I would slip out. If he waked up when I started to leave I  would have to go back an' scratch his head till he went to sleep agin.  Sometimes I had to fan de flies way from him while he slept. No  prayer-meetings wus allowed, but we sometimes went to de white folks  church. Dey tole us to obey our marsters an be obedient at all times.  When bad storms come dey let us rest but dey kept us in de fields so  long sometimes dat de storm caught us 'fore we could git to de cabins.  Niggers watched de wedder in slavery "]]]
