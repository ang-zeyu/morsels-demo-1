The missionaries were not exposed to this awful carnage, but their  position can only be described as terrible. The Mokoia expedition  brought back (it was said) no less than 2,000 prisoners. Several of  these were slaughtered in cold blood at the very doors of the station at  Kerikeri. The Maoris were inflamed with the lust for blood; they gloated  over the sufferings of their enemies. They surrounded the mission  premises with poles, upon which were stuck the heads of the slain, while  the remains of the cooked flesh lay rotting on the ground. The unhappy  missionaries could do but little. They rescued a few children from among  the prisoners, but for the rest they had to bear as best they might the  intolerable humiliation of feeling that they owed their very safety to  the protection of Hongi. The Kerikeri settlers were reduced to the  further degradation of making cartridge boxes for the troops, while  their forge was used for the manufacture of ammunition. How much is  contained in these few lines from the schoolmaster's diary: \"The natives  have been casting balls all day in Mr. Kemp's shop. They come in when  they please, and do what they please, and take away what they please,  and it is vain to resist them.\"    Marsden and the Home authorities were powerless to help. Of course  Kendall was dismissed. So was another of the settlers. Others left of  their own accord, and the Society at Home thought of abandoning the  mission. The one bright spot was Rangihoua or Te Puna, where the two  original catechists, King and Hall, kept quietly on, thus showing the  value of Marsden's training during the years of waiting in Sydney. Their  settlement was gradually improving, and at least they kept the flag  flying. As for Marsden himself, there was even one more drop of  bitterness to be added to his cup. Ever since the beginning of the  mission he had kept up a seminary for New Zealanders at Parramatta. The  chiefs were eager to send their sons to be educated under his care, and  in the beginning of 1820 he had no less than twenty-five in residence.  But in the following year a time of mortality set in; several of the  young men died, and for a time the seminary was closed.    Marsden had inaugurated the mission in 1814 with the message of peace  and goodwill to men. Now, as he thought of the charred villages and  whitening bones which marked the face of the country after seven years  of Gospel preaching, he must surely have felt bound to take other words  as the burden of his cry: \"I came not to send peace, but a sword.\"          CHAPTER IV.    THE NEW BEGINNING.    (1823-1830).      And he spake to me, \"O Maeldune, let be this purpose of thine!    Remember the words of the Lord when he told us, 'Vengeance is mine.'      His fathers have slain thy fathers in war or in single strife.      Thy fathers have slain his fathers, each taken a life for a life.        Thy father had slain his father: how long shall the murder last?        Go back to the island of Finn, and suffer the past to be past.\"      --_Legend of Maeldune._      \"When I reflect upon the evils which have crept in among the  missionaries, I am astonished that the mission has not been completely  annihilated. That it should continue to exist under such difficulties  affords a proof, in my judgment, that God will still carry on the work.\"  Such was Marsden's reflection in 1823--the year which saw a beginning of  better things. Out of the midst of the failure and the shame this man of  faith was able to gather hope for the future.    The great need of the mission was a higher class of workers. This need  was now to be supplied--in fact, the preparation for its supply had been  quietly going on concurrently with the mission itself, though in a  different quarter of the globe.    One of the last actions of the great war which was coming to an end when  Marsden proclaimed his message of peace in 1814 was the capture of an  American frigate in the West Indies. The prize was being towed to a  British port when a terrific gale sprang up, and in the midst of the  confusion the prisoners attempted to retake the ship. The danger of the  situation drove one of the officers to serious thoughts, and on the  conclusion of peace he resigned his commission and resolved to enter the  service of a higher monarch. For some years he lived quietly in England  on his half-pay allowance, but his thoughts were drawn towards New  Zealand, a part of the mission field which seemed to offer the greatest  peril and the greatest need. The news that the C.M.S. were about to  equip a ship for their station in that country seemed to him a call to a  post where his nautical skill would be of service. He volunteered to  take command of this vessel without pay. His offer could not be  accepted, because the project of the ship had already been abandoned,  but the Society accepted the lieutenant as one of their missionaries.  All arrangements were made for his setting out, when news arrived from  the Antipodes that the settlers would probably soon be driven out of the  country. This was no time to be sending out fresh workers. But the  candidate was not cast down. He studied surgery, and bided his time. The  Society was now coming to the conclusion that lay catechists were  undesirable, and it ordered the lieutenant to stay for two years longer  in England, and to prepare for Holy Orders. He was now a married man,  and could not go up to a university, but he studied at home under the  direction of a clerical brother-in-law who had first turned his  attention to foreign missions. In 1822 he was once more ready, and had  received the orders both of deacon and priest when tidings came of  Hongi's first raid. The Committee offered to send him to some quieter  part of the world, but he earnestly pleaded to be allowed to adhere to  his original purpose. Thus it was that Henry Williams reached New  Zealand, at the age of thirty-one years, arriving just in time to save  the mission and to give it a new beginning.    The character of the man thus providentially trained and guided is a  factor of the utmost moment in our history. He brought to the mission  just those qualities of leadership and power in which it had hitherto  been deficient, and he was joined somewhat later by a brother whose  milder and more intellectual nature supplied what was wanting in his  own. Drawn from the professional class, the brothers Williams of course  stood for a higher culture and a wider knowledge than could be expected  of the settlers who were hitherto in the field. These advantages were by  no means unappreciated by the Maoris, but the quality which impressed  them most immediately was the personal force and dauntless spirit of the  elder man. \"He is a _tangata riri_\" (i.e., angry man), said a hostile  Maori; \"he shuts his tent door upon us, and does not sit by our sides  and talk; he has the _Atua_ upon his lips, and we are afraid of his  anger.\" He could hold at arm's length two powerful men who were  struggling to fly at one another's throats. He soon won the name of \"the  man with the iron thumb,\" from the fact that on one occasion, while he  held in his hand the key of his study door, he felled to the earth the  leader of a gang of bullies who were bent on doing him bodily injury. On  another occasion a number of angry natives crowded in upon himself and a  companion as they were building a boat. After standing their  interference for some time, the builders seized, one a broken oar and  the other a stout stake, and after a sharp fray, in which the arm of the  carpenter was broken in two places, the intruders were driven from the  spot.    Nor was it only the men who felt the power of his arm. A story is told  of an encounter with some shameless women who had crossed from  Kororareka to taunt his school-girls at Paihia. The missionaries were  busy at a translation meeting, and at first sent some peaceful  messengers to bid the \"ship-girls\" depart. The messengers came back  discomfited, and the behaviour grew more wanton and defiant. At last,  Henry Williams came forth, umbrella in hand and spectacles on nose. The  whole school came out to watch the encounter. The leader of the band--a  great lady of the place--came on with outstretched tongue and insulting  cries, when \"old four eyes,\" as she called him, gave her a sounding  thwack with his umbrella. Startled by this indignity she turned and  fled. \"Duck them,\" cried the missionary; and before the saucy damsels  could regain their canoe they were thoroughly soused in the water, and  went back (as the narrator says) wetter, if not better, than they came.    No wonder that \"Te Wiremu\" soon obtained an ascendancy over a people who  idolised physical prowess. But it would be a great mistake to suppose  that he brought to the mission nothing more than the authoritative tone  of the quarter-deck. His piety was deep and self-sacrificing. It was in  order that he might exercise his ministry on shipboard that he had  chosen to come out in a female convict ship, where he had been untiring  in his attempts to uplift the unhappy creatures with which it was  crowded. During his stay at Parramatta he had thrown himself into  Marsden's work among the convicts of the other sex. There was sweetness  as well as strength in the straight glance of the well-opened eye, and  in the fine lines of the compressed lips.    In one respect Williams differed both from Marsden, who preceded, and  from Selwyn, who followed him. He was not an idealist; he dreamed no  dreams and he saw no visions. He fixed his attention upon the work  immediately in front, and to it he gave his undivided energy. The old  naval instinct of unquestioning obedience was strong in him to the last.  Writing to the C.M.S. before his departure from England, he assured them  that he should always regard their orders as rigidly as he ever did  those of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31425"],[0,"Report of the Decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, and the (#10)"],[1,"for want of jurisdiction here--for that would leave the erroneous  judgment in full force, and the injured party without remedy. And the  appellate court therefore exercises the power for which alone  appellate courts are constituted, by reversing the judgment of the  court below for this error. It exercises its proper and appropriate  jurisdiction over the judgment and proceedings of the Circuit Court,  as they appear upon the record brought up by the writ of error.    The correction of one error in the court below does not deprive the  appellate court of the power of examining further into the record, and  correcting any other material errors which may have been committed by  the inferior court. There is certainly no rule of law--nor any  practice--nor any decision of a court--which even questions this  power in the appellate tribunal. On the contrary, it is the daily  practice of this court, and of all appellate courts where they reverse  the judgment of an inferior court for error, to correct by its  opinions whatever errors may appear on the record material to the  case; and they have always held it to be their duty to do so where the  silence of the court might lead to misconstruction or future  controversy, and the point has been relied on by either side, and  argued before the court.    In the case before us, we have already decided that the Circuit Court  erred in deciding that it had jurisdiction upon the facts admitted by  the pleadings. And it appears that, in the further progress of the  case, it acted upon the erroneous principle it had decided on the  pleadings, and gave judgment for the defendant, where, upon the facts  admitted in the exception, it had no jurisdiction.    We are at a loss to understand upon what principle of law, applicable  to appellate jurisdiction, it can be supposed that this court has not  judicial authority to correct the last-mentioned error, because they  had before corrected the former; or by what process of reasoning it  can be made out, that the error of an inferior court in actually  pronouncing judgment for one of the parties, in a case in which it had  no jurisdiction, cannot be looked into or corrected by this court,  because we have decided a similar question presented in the pleadings.  The last point is distinctly presented by the facts contained in the  plaintiff's own bill of exceptions, which he himself brings here by  this writ of error. It was the point which chiefly occupied the  attention of the counsel on both sides in the argument--and the  judgment which this court must render upon both errors is precisely  the same. It must, in each of them, exercise jurisdiction over the  judgment, and reverse it for the errors committed by the court below;  and issue a mandate to the Circuit Court to conform its judgment to  the opinion pronounced by this court, by dismissing the case for want  of jurisdiction in the Circuit Court. This is the constant and  invariable practice of this court, where it reverses a judgment for  want of jurisdiction in the Circuit Court.    It can scarcely be necessary to pursue such a question further. The  want of jurisdiction in the court below may appear on the record  without any plea in abatement. This is familiarly the case where a  court of chancery has exercised jurisdiction in a case where the  plaintiff had a plain and adequate remedy at law, and it so appears by  the transcript when brought here by appeal. So also where it appears  that a court of admiralty has exercised jurisdiction in a case  belonging exclusively to a court of common law. In these cases there  is no plea in abatement. And for the same reason, and upon the same  principles, where the defect of jurisdiction is patent on the record,  this court is bound to reverse the judgment, although the defendant  has not pleaded in abatement to the jurisdiction of the inferior  court.    The cases of Jackson _v._ Ashton and of Capron _v._ Van Noorden, to  which we have referred in a previous part of this opinion, are  directly in point. In the last-mentioned case, Capron brought an  action against Van Noorden in a Circuit Court of the United States,  without showing, by the usual averments of citizenship, that the court  had jurisdiction. There was no plea in abatement put in, and the  parties went to trial upon the merits. The court gave judgment in  favor of the defendant with costs. The plaintiff thereupon brought his  writ of error, and this court reversed the judgment given in favor of  the defendant, and remanded the case with directions to dismiss it,  because it did not appear by the transcript that the Circuit Court had  jurisdiction.    The case before us still more strongly imposes upon this court the  duty of examining whether the court below has not committed an error,  in taking jurisdiction and giving a judgment for costs in favor of the  defendant; for in Capron _v._ Van Noorden the judgment was reversed,  because it did _not appear_ that the parties were citizens of  different States. They might or might not be. But in this case it  _does appear_ that the plaintiff was born a slave; and if the facts  upon which he relies have not made him free, then it appears  affirmatively on the record that he is not a citizen, and consequently  his suit against Sandford was not a suit between citizens of different  States, and the court had no authority to pass any judgment between  the parties. The suit ought, in this view of it, to have been  dismissed by the Circuit Court, and its judgment in favor of Sandford  is erroneous, and must be reversed.    It is true that the result either way, by dismissal or by a judgment  for the defendant, makes very little, if any, difference in a  pecuniary or personal point of view to either party. But the fact that  the result would be very nearly the same to the parties in either form  of judgment would not justify this court in sanctioning an error in  the judgment which is patent on the record, and which, if sanctioned,  might be drawn into precedent, and lead to serious mischief and  injustice in some future suit.    We proceed, therefore, to inquire whether the facts relied on by the  plaintiff entitled him to his freedom.    The case, as he himself states it, on the record brought here by his  writ of error, is this:    The plaintiff was a negro slave, belonging to Dr. Emerson, who was a  surgeon in the army of the United States. In the year 1834, he took  the plaintiff from the State of Missouri to the military post at Rock  Island, in the State of Illinois, and held him there as a slave until  the month of April or May, 1836. At the time last mentioned, said Dr.  Emerson removed the plaintiff from said military post at Rock Island  to the military post at Fort Snelling, situate on the west bank of the  Mississippi river, in the Territory known as Upper Louisiana, acquired  by the United States of France, and situate north of the latitude of  thirty-six degrees thirty minutes north, and north of the State of  Missouri. Said Dr. Emerson held the plaintiff in slavery at said Fort  Snelling, from said last-mentioned date until the year 1838.    In the year 1835, Harriet, who is named in the second count of the  plaintiff's declaration, was the negro slave of Major Taliaferro, who  belonged to the army of the United States. In that year, 1835, said  Major Taliaferro took said Harriet to said Fort Snelling, a military  post, situated as hereinbefore stated, and kept her there as a slave  until the year 1836, and then sold and delivered her as a slave, at  said Fort Snelling, unto the said Dr. Emerson hereinbefore named. Said  Dr. Emerson held said Harriet in slavery at said Fort Snelling until  the year 1838.    In the year 1836, the plaintiff and Harriet intermarried, at Fort  Snelling, with the consent of Dr. Emerson, who then claimed to be  their master and owner. Eliza and Lizzie, named in the third count of  the plaintiff's declaration, are the fruit of that marriage. Eliza is  about fourteen years old, and was born on board the steamboat Gipsey,  north of the north line of the State of Missouri, and upon the river  Mississippi. Lizzie is about seven years old, and was born in the  State of Missouri, at the military post called Jefferson Barracks.    In the year 1838, said Dr. Emerson removed the plaintiff and said  Harriet, and their said daughter Eliza, from said Fort Snelling to the  State of Missouri, where they have ever since resided.    Before the commencement of this suit, said Dr. Emerson sold and  conveyed the plaintiff, and Harriet, Eliza, and Lizzie, to the  defendant, as slaves, and the defendant has ever since claimed to hold  them, and each of them, as slaves.    In considering this part of the controversy, two questions arise: 1.  Was he, together with his family, free in Missouri by reason of the  stay in the territory of the United States hereinbefore mentioned?  And 2. If they were not, is Scott himself free by reason of his  removal to Rock Island, in the State of Illinois, as stated in the  above admissions?    We proceed to examine the first question.    The act of Congress, upon which the plaintiff relies, declares that  slavery and involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime,  shall be forever prohibited in all that part of the territory ceded by  France, under the name of Louisiana, which lies north of thirty-six  degrees thirty minutes north latitude, and not included within the  limits of Missouri. And the difficulty which meets us at the threshold  of this part of the inquiry is, whether Congress was authorized to  pass this law under any of the powers granted to it by the  Constitution; for if the authority is not given by that instrument, it  is the duty of this court to declare it void and inoperative, and  incapable of conferring freedom upon any one who is held as a slave  under the laws of any one of the States.    The counsel for the plaintiff has laid much stress"]]]
