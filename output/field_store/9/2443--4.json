It occurred on the  sandy ground of desert washes, the gravelly soil of the juniper-clad  benches, and the mixed sandy and rocky ground of washes in canyons. A  preference is shown by _panamintinus_ for fairly level ground. Rough  terrain or steep slopes are generally avoided, whereas rather large  colonies of these kangaroo rats are found in small flats of the desert  foothills.    Below about 4500 elevation on the interior slope this species was the  most numerous rodent, and seemed to reach maximum abundance in the  Joshua tree association. About 500 trap-nights in the juniper belt near  Graham Canyon yielded 31 specimens, whereas about 300 trap-nights in  Joshua tree flats took 34 individuals.    The cheek pouches of many specimens taken in early winter contained  green shoots of grass and little dry material. On many occasions rat  traps set next to wood rat nests beneath large junipers produced  _panamintinus_, and many of these animals had their cheek pouches  crammed full of juniper berries.    In December, 1948, _panamintinus_ was trapped consistently on nights  when the temperature dropped to below 20 deg. F. On December 27, 1948, after  a three inch snowfall, tracks of this species were noted in the snow at  the mouth of Mescal Canyon.    Parts of the skulls of this species were found in many coyote feces from  the desert slope.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 11, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: Mescal Wash, 4000 ft., 8 (6 PC); 2 mi. E      Valyermo, 4600 ft., 3.      =Dipodomys merriami merriami= Mearns    Merriam Kangaroo Rat    This kangaroo rat barely enters the area under consideration and is  almost restricted to the Joshua tree association, for only a few  individuals were taken at the lower edge of the juniper benches. This  species inhabits the Joshua tree belt all along the desert base of the  San Gabriels.    As mentioned in the description of the Joshua tree association, the  relative numbers of _Dipodomys merriami_ and _D. panamintinus_ shifted  from 1948 to 1951, possibly concurrent with the seasons of low rainfall  in this period. Whereas in 1948 _merriami_ was decidedly less abundant  than _panamintinus_ in the Joshua tree belt, in 1951 the numbers were  reversed.    In December, 1951, it was found by tending the traps in the early  evening that _merriami_ foraged fairly early before the ground had  frozen solidly.        _Specimens examined._--Los Angeles County: 2 mi. NW mouth of      Graham Canyon, 3500 ft., 5 (PC).      =Dipodomys merriami parvus= Rhoads    San Bernardino Kangaroo Rat    One specimen of this subspecies was trapped on November 26, 1951, in a  sandy channel of Cajon Wash near Devore beneath a clump of scale-broom.      =Dipodomys agilis agilis= Gambel    Pacific Kangaroo Rat    This species was found below about 4000 feet elevation all along the  coastal face of the range and reached maximum abundance in the level  tracts of coastal sage. It was one of the most abundant rodents there,  usually being second to _Perognathus fallax_ in point of numbers. Large  colonies of kangaroo rats occurred locally on sandy ground adjacent to  large washes. The rats were found sparingly on the foothill adobe banks  and in the greasewood chaparral of the lower foothills, but in heavy  chaparral where a layer of plant debris covered the ground, such as on  north slopes grown to scrub oak and lilac, kangaroo rats were completely  absent. Thus, in the lower chaparral belt, this rodent had a  discontinuous distribution.    The coyote probably is one of the major predators of these kangaroo  rats; remains of this rodent were often found in coyote feces, and  coyotes excavated many burrow systems in large kangaroo rat colonies in  the sandy ground near San Antonio Wash. The soil there is so soft that  coyotes probably were often successful in digging out their prey. The  shed skin of a large Pacific rattlesnake (_Crotalus viridis helleri_)  was found four feet inside the mouth of a kangaroo rat burrow; probably  this reptile preys on _agilis_. Great horned owls (_Bubo virginianus  pacificus_) come down nightly from the chaparral to hunt in the sage  flats. Beneath the perches of these owls I have found pellets containing  bones of _agilis_.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 13, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: San Antonio Wash, 1900 ft., 11 (10 PC); 4 mi. NE      Claremont, 1600 ft., 2.      =Dipodomys agilis perplexus= (Merriam)    Pacific Kangaroo Rat    All the specimens of this species from the desert slope of the San  Gabriel Range are referred to the subspecies _perplexus_. They were  taken in brushy habitats between the elevations of 4500 and 7400 feet.  Throughout much of this area _perplexus_ was found only in certain  restricted areas more or less surrounded by inhospitable ground. For  example, at 7400 feet on Blue Ridge, they were found occasionally in the  strips of sagebrush and lilac brush which locally capped this ridge.  Often these patches of chaparral on Blue Ridge were surrounded by areas  unsuitable for kangaroo rats: on the Pacific slope, talus, oaks, and  yellow pines prevailed; on the ridge scattered yellow pine groves were  present; and on the steep desert slope there were yellow pines and white  firs. In Swarthout Valley _perplexus_ was found in flats that supported  basin sagebrush and _Haploppus_, while the coniferous forests to the  south, and pinyon-covered slopes to the north were uninhabited. On flats  supporting antelope brush and juniper, _perplexus_ was often common, but  it did not penetrate the chaparral of adjacent slopes grown to scrub oak  and mountain-mahogany. In general then, _perplexus_ was found in fairly  open brushy flats or slopes, even where these were surrounded by  unsuitable habitats.    Specimens of _D. agilis_ from the desert slope two miles east of  Valyermo are referrable to the subspecies _perplexus_. A series taken in  Cajon Wash at Devore, on the Pacific slope, is intermediate between  _agilis_, of the coastal slope of the San Gabriels, and _perplexus_ of  the desert slope, but approaches more nearly the later subspecies. Thus,  different subspecies of _D. agilis_ occur on opposite slopes of the San  Gabriel Mountains, with intergradation taking place in the Cajon Pass  area and probably also at the west end of the Mountains.    Both scrub oak acorns and juniper berries were found in the cheek  pouches of this subspecies, and one immature individual taken in  Swarthout Valley had its cheek pouches stuffed with approximately 550  seeds of brome grass.    On November 13, 1951, at 7500 feet on Blue Ridge, a small juvenile was  taken; it must have been born not earlier than September.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 17, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: 2 mi.

SW Devore, 2200 ft., 5.      Family CRICETIDAE      =Reithrodontomys megalotis longicaudus= (Baird)    Western Harvest Mouse    This species inhabited grassy areas of the coastal sage belt, and  reached maximum abundance on cleared land grown thickly to weeds and  scattered brush. The mouse was only locally abundant--being scarce  throughout much of the sage belt--but was found under contrasting  conditions. In San Antonio Wash the species was taken among rocks and  sparse weeds, at Palmer Canyon specimens were trapped on a barren ridge  sparsely clothed with greasewood and white sage, and also one mile E of  Big Pines in flats supporting basin sagebrush and a fairly dense growth  of grasses. The western harvest mouse was recorded from 1500 feet  elevation to 3200 feet on the Pacific slope, and at 6600 feet near Big  Pines on the desert slope.    Those specimens of harvest mice from near Big Pines may be grading  toward the desert race _megalotis_; my series of specimens from this  locality, however, is too small for clear indications on this point.    Individuals in juvenal pelage were taken on November 26, 1951, near  Devore.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 6, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: 1 mi. E Big Pines, 6600 ft., 2; Palmer Canyon,      2000 ft., 1; 4 mi. N Claremont, 1700 ft., 3 (PC).      =Peromyscus eremicus eremicus= (Baird)    Cactus Mouse    In Mescal Wash on the desert slope of the San Gabriels, this mouse was  one of the most abundant mammals and was the only rodent other than  _Peromyscus maniculatus_ regularly trapped in the barren channels of  washes. In Mescal Wash, at an altitude of 4000 feet, _eremicus_ occurred  along with the chaparral-inhabiting _Peromyscus boylii_ and _Peromyscus  californicus_. The two species last mentioned were associated with the  occasional large patches of manzanita, antelope brush, and other brush  of the wash, whereas _eremicus_ was trapped in the rocky and sandy  channels among scattered bushes of scale-broom. No specimens of  _eremicus_ were taken on the juniper-clad benches adjacent to the wash.        _Specimens examined._--Los Angeles County: Mescal Wash, 4000      ft., 10 (4 PC).      =Peromyscus eremicus fraterculus= (Miller)    Cactus Mouse    This mouse was recorded from 1900 feet elevation, one mile south of the  mouth of San Antonio Canyon, to 3200 feet elevation in Cajon Canyon.  This subspecies is characteristic of the sage belt and shows a strong  preference for the rough rocky areas found in dry washes. Although in  many areas the channels of the washes are immediately adjacent to sandy  sagebrush-covered flats, _eremicus_ is not common in the latter areas.  Rocks seem to be essential to _eremicus_, for sandy areas in the  sageland which were devoid of rocks yielded only an occasional specimen.  For example, 100 trap-nights in the main channel of San Antonio Wash  yielded 23 _eremicus_ and only six"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34853"],[0,"The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries (#10)"],[1,"and on, the folk-lore  of Western Ireland, not indeed in the shape in which Mr. Wentz has  collected it, but rather with an eye (partly for linguistic and literary  purposes) to its songs, sayings, ballads, proverbs, and _sgealta_, which  last are generally the equivalent of the German Maerchen, but sometimes  have a touch of the saga nature about them. In making a collection of  these things I have naturally come across a very large amount of  folk-belief conversationally expressed, with regard to the 'good people'  and other supernatural manifestations, so that I can bear witness to the  fidelity with which Mr. Wentz has done his work on Irish soil, for to a  great number of the beliefs which he records I have myself heard  parallels, sometimes I have heard near variants of the stories,  sometimes the identical stories. So we may, I think, unhesitatingly  accept his subject-matter, whatever, as I said, be the conclusions we  may deduce from them.    The folk-tale (_sean-sgeal_) or Maerchen, which I have spent so much time  in collecting, must not be confounded with the folk-belief which forms  the basis of Mr. Wentz's studies. The _sgeal_ or story is something much  more intricate, complicated, and thought-out than the belief. One can  quite easily distinguish between the two. One (the belief) is short,  conversational, chiefly relating to real people, and contains no great  sequence of incidents, while the other (the folk-tale) is long,  complicated, more or less conventional, and above all has its interest  grouped around a single central figure, that of the hero or heroine. I  may make this plainer by an example. Let us go into a cottage on the  mountain-side, as Mr. Wentz and I have done so often, and ask the old  man of the house if he ever heard of such things as fairies, and he will  tell you that 'there is fairies in it surely. Didn't his own father see  the \"forth\"[10] beyond full of them, and he passing by of a moonlight  night and a little piper among them, and he playing music that mortal  man never heard the like?' or he'll tell you that 'he himself wouldn't  say agin fairies for it's often he heard their music at the old bush  behind the house'. Ask what the fairies are like, and he will tell  you--well, pretty much what Mr. Wentz tells us. From this and the like  accounts we form our ideas of fairies and fairy music, of ghosts,  mermaids, _pucas_, and so on, but there is no sequence of incidents, no  hero, no heroine, no story.    Again, ask the old man if he knows e'er a _sean-sgeal_ (story or  Maerchen), and he will ask you at once, 'Did you ever hear the Speckled  Bull; did you ever hear the Well at the end of the world; did you ever  hear the Tailor and the Three Beasts; did you ever hear the Hornless  Cow?' Ask him to relate one of these, and if you get him in the right  vein, which may be perhaps one time in ten, or if you induce the right  vein, which you may do perhaps nine times out of ten, you will find him  begin with a certain gravity and solemnity at the very beginning, thus,  'There was once, in old times and in old times it was, a king in  Ireland'; or perhaps 'a man who married a second wife'; or perhaps 'a  widow woman with only one son': and the tale proceeds to recount the  life and adventures of the heroes or heroines, whose biographies told in  Irish in a sort of stereotyped form may take from ten minutes to half an  hour to get through. Some stories would burn out a dip candle in the  telling, or even last the whole night. But these stories have little or  nothing to say to the questions raised in this book.    The problem we have to deal with is a startling one, as thus put before  us by Mr. Wentz. Are these beings of the spirit world real beings,  having a veritable existence of their own, in a world of their own, or  are they only the creation of the imagination of his informants, and  the tradition of bygone centuries? The newspaper, the 'National' School,  and the _Zeitgeist_ have answered to their own entire satisfaction that  these things are imagination pure and simple. Yet this off-hand  condemnation does not always carry with it a perfect conviction. We do  not doubt the existence of tree-martins or kingfishers, although nine  hundred and ninety-nine people out of every thousand pass their entire  lives without being vouchsafed a glimpse of them in their live state;  and may it not be the same with the creatures of the spirit world, may  not they also exist, though to only one in a thousand it be vouchsafed  to behold them? The spirit creatures cannot be stuffed and put into  museums, like rare animals and birds, whose existence we might doubt of  if we had not seen them there; yet they may exist just as such animals  and birds do, though we cannot see them. I, at least, have often been  tempted to think so. But the following considerations, partly drawn from  comparative folk-lore, have made me hesitate about definitely accepting  any theory.    In the first place, then, viewing the Irish spirit-world as a whole, we  find that it contains, even on Mr. Wentz's showing, quite a number of  different orders of beings, of varying shapes, appearances, size, and  functions. Are we to believe that all those beings equally exist, and,  on the principle that there can be no smoke without a fire, are we to  hold that there would be no popular conception of the banshee, the  leprechaun, or the _Maighdean-mhara_ (sea-maiden, mermaid), and  consequently no tales told about them, if such beings did not exist, and  from time to time allow themselves to be seen like the wood-martin and  the kingfisher? This question is, moreover, further complicated by the  belief in the appearance of things that are or appear to be inanimate  objects, not living beings, such as the deaf coach or the phantom ship  in full sail, the appearance of which Mr. Yeats has immortalized in one  of his earliest and finest poems.    Again, although the _bean-sidhe_ (banshee), leprechaun, _puca_, and the  like are the most commonly known and usually seen creatures of the  spirit world, yet great quantities of other appearances are believed to  have been also sporadically met with. I very well remember sitting one  night some four or five years ago in an hotel in Indianapolis, U.S.A.,  and talking to four Irishmen, one or two of them very wealthy, and all  prosperous citizens of the United States. The talk happened to turn upon  spirits--the only time during my entire American experiences in which  such a thing happened--and each man of the four had a story of his own  to tell, in which he was a convinced believer, of ghostly manifestations  seen by him in Ireland. Two of these manifestations were of beings that  would fall into no known category; a monstrous rabbit as big as an ass,  which plunged into the sea (rabbits can swim), and a white heifer which  ascended to heaven, were two of them. I myself, when a boy of ten or  eleven, was perfectly convinced that on a fine early dewy morning in  summer when people were still in bed, I saw a strange horse run round a  seven-acre field of ours and change into a woman, who ran even swifter  than the horse, and after a couple of courses round the field  disappeared into our haggard. I am sure, whatever I may believe to-day,  no earthly persuasion would, at the time, have convinced me that I did  not see this. Yet I never saw it again, and never heard of any one else  seeing the same.    My object in mentioning these things is to show that if we concede the  real objective existence of, let us say, the apparently  well-authenticated banshee (_Bean-sidhe_, 'woman-fairy'), where are we  to stop? for any number of beings, more or less well authenticated, come  crowding on her heels, so many indeed that they would point to a far  more extensive world of different shapes than is usually suspected, not  to speak of inanimate objects like the coach and the ship. Of course  there is nothing inherently impossible in all these shapes existing any  more than in one of them existing, but they all seem to me to rest upon  the same kind of testimony, stronger in the case of some, less strong in  the case of others, and it is as well to point out this clearly.    My own experience is that beliefs in the _Sidhe_ (pronounced Shee)  folk, and in other denizens of the invisible world is, in many places,  rapidly dying. In reading folk-lore collections like those of Mr. Wentz  and others, one is naturally inclined to exaggerate the extent and depth  of these traditions. They certainly still exist, and can be found if you  go to search for them; but they often exist almost as it were by  sufferance, only in spots, and are ceasing to be any longer a power.  Near my home in a western county (County Roscommon) rises gently a  slope, which, owing to the flatness of the surrounding regions, almost  becomes a hill, and is a conspicuous object for many miles upon every  side. The old people called it in Irish _Mullach na Sidhe_. This name is  now practically lost, and it is called Fairymount. So extinct have the  traditions of the _Sidhe_-folk, who lived within the hill, become, that  a high ecclesiastic recently driving by asked his driver was there an  Irish name for the hill, and what was it, and his driver did not know.  There took place a few years ago a much talked of bog-slide in the  neighbouring townland of Cloon-Sheever (_Sidhbhair_ or _Siabhra_), 'the  Meadow of the Fairies,' and many newspaper correspondents came to view  it. One of the natives told a sympathetic newspaper reporter, 'Sure we  always knew it was going to move, that's why the place is named  Cloon-Sheever, the bog was always in a \"shiver\"!' I have never been able  to hear of any legends attached to what must have at one time been held  to be the head-quarters of the _Sidhe_ for a score of miles round it.    Of all the beings in the Irish mythological world the _Sidhe_ are,  however, apparently the oldest and"]]]
