In his later years the king lived in peace  and luxury, surrounded by a vicious and intriguing Court, haunted by  magicians, hags, and mystery-mongers. Dealers in magic may still  be found on the other side of the river, in happy Luxor. I made the  acquaintance of two when I was there, one of whom offered for a couple  of pounds to provide me with a preservative against all such dangers as  beset the traveller in wild places. In order to prove its efficacy he  asked me to come to his house by night, bringing a dog and my revolver  with me. He would hang the charm about the dog's neck, and I was then to  put six shots into the animal's body. He positively assured me that the  dog would be uninjured. I half-promised to come and, when night began to  fall, looked vaguely about for a dog. At last I found one, but it howled  so dismally when I asked Ibrahim Ayyad to take possession of it for  experimental purposes, that I weakly gave up the project, and left the  magician clamoring for his hundred and ninety-five piastres.    Its warlike aspect gives a special personality to Medinet-Abu. The  shield-shaped battlements; the courtyards, with their brutal columns,  narrowing as they recede towards the mountains; the heavy gateways,  with superimposed chambers; the towers; quadrangular bastion to protect,  inclined basement to resist the attacks of sappers and cause projectiles  to rebound--all these things contribute to this very definite effect.    I have heard travelers on the Nile speak piteously of the confusion  wakened in their minds by a hurried survey of many temples, statues,  monuments, and tombs. But if one stays long enough this confusion fades  happily away, and one differentiates between the antique personalities  of Ancient Egypt almost as easily as one differentiates between the  personalities of one's familiar friends. Among these personalities  Medinet-Abu is the warrior, standing like Mentu, with the solar disk,  and the two plumes erect above his head of a hawk, firmly planted at the  foot of the Theban mountains, ready to repel all enemies, to beat back  all assaults, strong and determined, powerful and brutally serene.          XI    THE RAMESSEUM    \"This, my lord, is the thinking-place of Rameses the Great.\"    So said Ibrahim Ayyad to me one morning--Ibrahim, who is almost as  prolific in the abrupt creation of peers as if he were a democratic  government.    I looked about me. We stood in a ruined hall with columns, architraves  covered with inscriptions, segments of flat roof. Here and there traces  of painting, dull-red, pale, ethereal blue--the \"love-color\" of Egypt,  as the Egyptians often call it--still adhered to the stone. This hall,  dignified, grand, but happy, was open on all sides to the sun and air.  From it I could see tamarisk- and acacia-trees, and far-off shadowy  mountains beyond the eastern verge of the Nile. And the trees were still  as carven things in an atmosphere that was a miracle of clearness and  of purity. Behind me, and near, the hard Libyan mountains gleamed in the  sun. Somewhere a boy was singing; and suddenly his singing died away.  And I thought of the \"Lay of the Harper\" which is inscribed upon the  tombs of Thebes--those tombs under those gleaming mountains:         \"For no one carries away his goods with him;       Yea, no one returns again who has gone thither.\"    It took the place of the song that had died as I thought of the great  king's glory; that he had been here, and had long since passed away.    \"The thinking-place of Rameses the Great!\"    \"Suttinly.\"    \"You must leave me alone here, Ibrahim.\"    I watched his gold-colored robe vanish into the gold of the sun  through the copper color of the columns. And I was quite alone in  the \"thinking-place\" of Rameses. It was a brilliant day, the sky  dark sapphire blue, without even the spectre of a cloud, or any airy,  vaporous veil; the heat already intense in the full sunshine, but  delicious if one slid into a shadow. I slid into a shadow, and sat down  on a warm block of stone. And the silence flowed upon me--the silence of  the Ramesseum.    Was _Horbehutet_, the winged disk, with crowned _uroei_, ever set up  above this temple's principal door to keep it from destruction? I do not  know. But, if he was, he failed perfectly to fulfil his mission. And I  am glad he failed. I am glad of the ruin that is here, glad that walls  have crumbled or been overthrown, that columns have been cast down, and  ceilings torn off from the pillars that supported them, letting in the  sky. I would have nothing different in the thinking-place of Rameses.    Like a cloud, a great golden cloud, a glory impending that will not,  cannot, be dissolved into the ether, he loomed over the Egypt that is  dead, he looms over the Egypt of to-day. Everywhere you meet his traces,  everywhere you hear his name. You say to a tall young Egyptian: \"How big  you are growing, Hassan!\"    He answers, \"Come back next year, my gentleman, and I shall be like  Rameses the Great.\"    Or you ask of the boatman who rows you, \"How can you pull all day  against the current of the Nile?\" And he smiles, and lifting his brown  arm, he says to you: \"Look! I am strong as Rameses the great.\"    This familiar fame comes down through some twenty years. Carved upon  limestone and granite, now it seems engraven also on every Egyptian  heart that beats not only with the movement of shadoof, or is not buried  in the black soil fertilized by Hapi. Thus can inordinate vanity prolong  the true triumph of genius, and impress its own view of itself upon  the minds of millions. This Rameses is believed to be the Pharaoh who  oppressed the children of Israel.    As I sat in the Ramesseum that morning, I recalled his face--the face  of an artist and a dreamer rather than that of a warrior and oppressor;  Asiatic, handsome, not insensitive, not cruel, but subtle, aristocratic,  and refined. I could imagine it bending above the little serpents of the  sistrum as they lifted their melodious voices to bid Typhon depart, or  watching the dancing women's rhythmic movements, or smiling half kindly,  half with irony, upon the lovelorn maiden who made her plaint:         \"What is sweet to the mouth, to me is as the gall of birds;       Thy breath alone can comfort my heart.\"    And I could imagine it looking profoundly grave, not sad, among the  columns with their opening lotus flowers. For it is the hall of lotus  columns that Ibrahim calls the thinking-place of the king.    There is something both lovely and touching to me in the lotus columns  of Egypt, in the tall masses of stone opening out into flowers near the  sun. Near the sun! Yes; only that obvious falsehood will convey to those  who have not seen them the effect of some of the hypostyle halls, the  columns of which seem literally soaring to the sky. And flowers of  stone, you will say, rudely carved and rugged! That does not matter.  There was poetry in the minds that conceived them, in the thought that  directed the hands which shaped them and placed them where they are.  In Egypt perpetually one feels how the ancient Egyptians loved  the _Nymphaea lotus_, which is the white lotus, and the _Nymphaea  coeruloea_, the lotus that is blue. Did they not place Horus in its cup,  and upon the head of Nefer-Tum, the nature god, who represented in  their mythology the heat of the rising sun, and who seems to have been  credited with power to grant life in the world to come, set it as a  sort of regal ornament? To Seti I., when he returned in glory from his  triumphs over the Syrians, were given bouquets of lotus-blossoms by  the great officers of his household. The tiny column of green feldspar  ending in the lotus typified eternal youth, even as the carnelian buckle  typified the blood of Isis, which washed away all sin. Kohl pots were  fashioned in the form of the lotus, cartouches sprang from it, wine  flowed from cups shaped like it. The lotus was part of the very life of  Egypt, as the rose, the American Beauty rose, is part of our social  life of to-day. And here, in the Ramesseum, I found campaniform, or  lotus-flower capitals on the columns--here where Rameses once perhaps  dreamed of his Syrian campaigns, or of that famous combat when, \"like  Baal in his fury,\" he fought single-handed against the host of the  Hittites massed in two thousand, five hundred chariots to overthrow him.    The Ramesseum is a temple not of winds, but of soft and kindly airs.  There comes Zephyrus, whispering love to Flora incarnate in the Lotus.  To every sunbeam, to every little breeze, the ruins stretch out arms.  They adore the deep-blue sky, the shining, sifted sand, untrammeled  nature, all that whispers, \"Freedom.\"    So I felt that day when Ibrahim left me, so I feel always when I sit  in the Ramesseum, that exultant victim of Time's here not sacrilegious  hand.    All strong souls cry out secretly for liberty as for a sacred necessity  of life. Liberty seems to drench the Ramesseum. And all strong souls  must exult there. The sun has taken it as a beloved possession. No massy  walls keep him out. No shield-shaped battlements rear themselves up  against the outer world as at Medinet-Abu. No huge pylons cast down upon  the ground their forms in darkness. The stone glows with the sun, seems  almost to have a soul glowing with the sense, the sun-ray sense, of  freedom. The heart leaps up in the Ramesseum, not frivolously, but with  a strange, sudden"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34076"],[0,"Fox Trapping: A Book of Instruction Telling How to Trap, Snare, Poison and Shoot (#10)"],[1," possible around your traps. When setting for any  shy animal, don't cover or handle trap or clog with bare hands. Use  gloves and a small wooden spade.        CHAPTER XIII.    TENNESSEE TRAPPER'S METHODS.    Do you trap foxes? If you do I bet you have some favorite way, and  too, doubtless in most respects it's different from my way of  trapping them, as there seems to be almost as many methods as there  are successful trappers; nor either is the same confined to the  methods used, but to the kind of traps employed, baits, scents, etc.,  says B. P. Pickens.    The Water Set, the Sheep Path Methods, are national, and known to be  O. K., though the former requires bait attractions, and lots of other  preparations, while the latter with me has never necessarily required  baits or scents to make it a good success.    I do not confine my fox trapping to any one method long, for I am  always governed by the surroundings, and conditions, yet my traps are  set and concealed the same way, no matter for what animals I intend  to trap.    My traps set for skunk and rats are just as carefully set and  concealed as though they were set for fox and coon.    My favorite is a Newhouse Fox Trap for every purpose, as it will  hold.    My reasons for using nothing smaller than a No. 2 Fox Trap is that a  fellow does not always know if a fox will happen about his skunk  traps or a big coon about his rat traps, and since I have found Mr.  Fox and Mr. Coon a few times in the toils I make every preparation  for his reception.    I will endeavor to tell some of the things I do, which is a good way  to take a fox. I commence early in the spring, if the ground is not  ready to arrange for my fall and winter trapping, looking out for  their signs, and continue to keep my eyes open all summer and around  the pastures, in the fields, old roads, and in the woods, gullies and  washouts. I arrange to trap them in stock paths by laying a limb or  fence rail across these paths, while the use of stock all summer  renders it old, and on either side of this path obstruction is just  the place for a fox trap. I cut and wire my trap chain to the middle  of a brush, one that a fox can drag some distance away, which leaves  this same place a good risk for another catch, where if stapled to  something he could not move he would render the place unfit for the  rest of the season.    Conceal your trap by digging a hole on either side of the path  obstruction the size of the trap to be used, setting trap always  springs with path, have the hole deep enough so when the trap is well  covered with leaves, then on the leaves a layer of dirt, it will just  be level with the earth and look natural.    To use this same underground method in cold freezing weather, first  bed the trap hole good with dry leaves, or grass, over springs and  all, being sure to use dry flat leaves to lay over the pan and jaws,  then cover over all with some of the remaining dirt before mentioned.    Be sure to hide chain and handle everything with gloves.    Now brush out your tracks, step over your trap and go on.    One way of trapping foxes may be done like this. Around the pastures  and in the woods where stock make paths lay a fence rail, or its  equivalent across these paths, and the use of stock during the summer  months will render these prearranged obstructions worn and natural by  November trapping, and on either side of such an obstruction is a  splendid place to set your trap for the fox to step in, writes L. M.  Pickens.    Paths, places under fences, little washouts, and old roads not much  used are generally his favorite travels. See after his tracks in the  dust, mud, or snow; notice how he steps over one of these  obstructions that you arranged early in the summer, and other places,  studying him, then set your trap this way, using every precaution to  not change any of the surroundings.      [Illustration: TENNESSEE TRAPPERS AND TRAPS.]    Carry with you a little hard wood stick, ready sharpened, with which  to dig a hole on either side of this obstruction that has been lying  over the stock path just the size of your trap, and deep enough so  your trap pan and jaws will be a little below the level of the  surface. Now cover over springs good and all around the outside of  jaws with some of this dirt you dug up; now you have the trap  concealed all but its pan and inside of jaws; finish the set by  laying some small flat leaves from jaws to pan, commencing and going  all the way around jaws; after this is done pulverize some of the  remaining dirt, and sprinkle it over these leaves, entirely covering  them. Take a small twig and level over trap, finishing the job. It  might help some to cut a part of a bird into fine pieces, dropping it  and loose feathers over this kind of a set.    To fasten the trap is some of the job. Cut a bush with a lot of limbs  to it, and wire your trap to the middle of same securely, but do not  have the brush drag so heavily that he cannot run off with it; it is  intended for him to go immediately after he is caught, for these  reasons, he will soon hang up some distance away, and thus fastened,  he is not stationed at this good place where another may be caught,  besides his chances of pulling out of the trap is less than it is if  he was stapled to something he could not move. The brush is a give  and take game, see?    Be sure to cover chain of trap good, and have everything look as  natural when you leave us when you came to set trap. Use No. 2  Newhouse, handling it and everything with gloves; always stand In one  place; leave no paper or whittlings on the premises. I use this  method just outlined. Try it boys.        CHAPTER XIV.    MANY GOOD METHODS.    There is no animal roaming the woods so hard to catch in a steel trap  as the fox, says a writer in the _Orange Judd Farmer_. Yet when one  understands his nature he is easily taken despite his cunning. The  following method I have employed successfully: First take four good  steel traps and cover them with fresh blood at a slaughter house.  Take a dead hen (one that has died a natural death will do if there  is no odor), and run a wire up in her head and down in her body; also  wires through her feet and legs. Select a place where foxes run near  a low bush or small tree. On a branch of this, about three feet from  the ground, fasten your hen solidly with the wires in her feet. By  means of wire in her neck, bend it so she will look as if she were on  a roost. Be very particular on this point. Set your trap a little  below the surface of the soil, so that the tops are level. Now cover  up with leaves and grass so that there is no difference in appearance  from the surrounding ground. Be sure the chains are well staked. Mr.  Fox comes up and sees the hen. He squats down on his stomach. He will  lie there for five minutes watching the hen. Then he makes a spring  for her neck, and gets it, but the traps get him and the boy gets the  fox if he is cute enough.      * * *    Well here is how I caught my first fox, says C. F. Hotchkiss, of  Wisconsin. It was in the winter of 1887 and 1888. I was working for a  farmer here in Shawano Co., had to drive the stock to the river to  water all winter. I noticed fox tracks on the ice so I bought a  double spring Newhouse. Gave 60 cents for it, took some chaff from the  hay in the cow stable for a bed and set the trap on the river bank  under a large hemlock to protect it from storms, covered trap with  chaff and strewed pieces of chicken and feathers on the bed. In four  days I had two foxes, then some one stole my trap and I did not try  any more then. Last winter I was working for the same farmer again.  He lost two sheep. We drew the carcasses out in the woods, set four  traps at one sheep and six at the other. In seven weeks we had 14  foxes and we lost no time from other work. We pulled wool from the  sheep to cover the traps with. I do not think it best to spit near a  fox trap, especially tobacco spit. There may be some foxes that do  not care for it, but I know they are not all built that way.    One of my methods of trapping Reynard was as follows: First,  thoroughly besmear the trap with droppings from cattle, using no  other preparation, neither boiling or smoking, as some recommend to  prevent their fear of human scent, then my favorite sets being in the  path of some old timber or wood road or cattle path in some unusual  pasture. After selecting the place best suited, according to my best  judgment, take a knife to cut out a hole corresponding to size of  trap, remove carefully all loose earth. I usually carried a small  basket for the reception of everything taken up this way. Set the  trap carefully, covering loosely with some coarse material and  topping the whole with material to correspond with the surrounding  surface of paths, and lastly laying a small twig across just at one  side of where the trap is set, as a fox will always step over any  small obstruction, and by placing the twig in this manner he would  step over into the trap.      [Illustration: THIRTY SILVER FOX SKINS WORTH $5000.]    In the section of country which I am now writing, that just east of  the White Mountains in New Hampshire, there were innumerable such  roads and paths, so that I had all the territory I desired for the  purpose. Have caught many a sly chap in this manner. Had a good  grapple at end of chain and never fastened a trap but let them make a  few jumps when they would nearly always get caught up, yet on a few  occasions have had to put up a pretty stiff hunt before locating  them. For instance, there might be a snow storm, if late in the  season, or a heavy rain. In this case there might not be any signs to  go by, and I would have to go on a blind hunt and cover considerable  ground before I could skin my fox.      * * *    I had my traps all set one fall and everything was coming my way,  until one morning I found that I was dealing"]]]
