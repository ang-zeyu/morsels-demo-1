Thirty years ago the Flicker, High-hole or Yellow-hammer, was prey of  any boy with a gun and was correspondingly wild and little known; now,  thanks to the Audubon Society, he is almost as domestic as the Robin. In  search of ants and their eggs, he hunts our lawns and even accepts the  hospitality of our nest-logs. A great acquisition to our dooryard life  is this bird of beautiful colors, quaint habits, and strange notes. His  loud, strongly accented call, _kee-yer_, his rapidly repeated mellow  _weechew, weechew_, possess character even if they lack musical quality.    The Flicker nests in holes and lays from 5-9 white eggs in late April or  early May.          GOATSUCKERS, SWIFTS, HUMMINGBIRDS. ORDER MACROCHIRES          NIGHTHAWKS, WHIP-POOR-WILLS, ETC. FAMILY CAPRIMULGIDAE      CHUCKWILL'S WIDOW    _Antrostromus carolinensis. Case 6, Fig. 40_              A larger, browner bird than the Whip-poor-will,            with branched, not simple bristles at the sides of            the bill. Breast-patch whiter in the male than in            the female.

Cambridge, A.V., one            record, Dec.    What the Whip-poor-will is to the north the Chuckwill is to the south.  The difference in their names expresses the syllabic difference in  their calls, but the Chuckwill's notes are uttered more evenly and lack  the marked accent on the first \"Whip\" of its northern cousin's song.    The Chuckwill lays its two eggs in April on the ground in the woods,  where it lives. They are white with delicate lilac markings and a few  brownish spots.

A mysterious, silent, flitting shadow, should we chance to arouse it  from its sleep in the forest by day, at dusk the Whip-poor-will takes  the center of the stage and announces his presence to the world.  _Whi['p]-poor-will, whi['p]-poor-will_ he calls with a snap and a  swinging rhythm that makes the twilight ring with the oft-repeated  notes.    Two eggs are laid on the ground in the woods in May. They are dull white  with delicate obscure lilac markings, and a few brownish gray spots.      NIGHTHAWK    _Chordeiles virginianus virginianus. Case 6, Fig. 39_              A white mark across the black outer wing-quills is            very conspicuous in flight; seen from below it            suggests a hole in the bird's wing. The female has            the throat buff and no white band in the tail.

Doubtless because we see the Nighthawk and only hear the Whip-poor-will  the notes of the latter have been often attributed to the former, with  the result that many people think there is but one species. While it is  true that there is a general resemblance in form, in details of color  and markings, the two birds are quite unlike, while so far as notes and  habits are concerned, few members of the same family differ more. The  Whip-poor-will haunts the shadows of the woods and rarely flies far  above the ground, the Nighthawk, like a Swift, courses high in the open,  even over city house-tops, where anyone who looks may see him. The  Whip-poor-will's notes have made him famous, the Nighthawk calls only a  nasal _peent, peent_, and, diving earthward on set wings, produces a  hollow, booming sound. Both nest on the ground, but the Nighthawk lays  in the fields or on pebbly roofs, and its two finely marked eggs (laid  in May or June) are quite unlike those of the Whip-poor-will.          SWIFTS.

Here the bracket-like nest of dead twigs is attached to the  bricks by the bird's saliva, to be loosened, at times, after heavy rains  and fall to the fire-place below. In the fall great flocks roost in  chimneys, generally large ones, returning night after night.    The 4-6 white eggs are laid in May.          HUMMINGBIRDS.

Any Hummingbird seen east of the Mississippi may, with confidence, be  called a Ruby-throat; exceptions will probably prove to be sphinx moths,  which, it must be confessed, look singularly hummingbird-like as they  hover before flowers. When the eggs are laid the male deserts the  female, leaving to her the task of incubation and care of the young.    The nest, most exquisite of bird homes, is saddled to a limb usually 15  or more feet up. The two bean-like white eggs are laid in May.          PERCHING BIRDS. ORDER PASSERES          FLYCATCHERS.

K.      SYMPATHY IN A DOG.              [_July 30, 1892._]    The article, \"Animals in Sickness,\" in the _Spectator_ of July 23rd, has  reminded me of the following anecdote, which was told to me some years  ago by a butcher residing at Brodick, in the Isle of Arran. He told me  that he had had two collie dogs at the same time, one old and the other  young. The old dog became useless through age, and was drowned in the  sea at Brodick. A few days afterwards, its body was washed ashore, and  it was discovered by the young dog, who was seen immediately to go to  the butcher's shop and take away a piece of meat and lay it at the dead  dog's mouth. The young dog evidently thought that the meat would revive  his old comrade, and thereby showed remarkable sympathy in aid of, to  him, the apparent \"weak.\"              DAVID HANNAY.      A DOG'S HUMANITY.              [_April 18, 1891._]    Possibly it is from an excess of the \"maudlin sentimentality\" of which  physiologists complain in those who protest against cruelty to animals,  that I find it almost painful to read such pathetic stories of dogs as  the one given by Miss Cobbe in the _Spectator_ of April 11th; for they  tell of such intelligence and devotion, that, remembering the inhuman  way in which our poor dogs are too often treated, we feel it would be  almost better if they lacked these human qualities.    The following is an anecdote of the same kind, that ever since I heard  it, I have been intending to send it to the _Spectator_. The servant-man  of one of my friends took a kitten to a pond with the intention of  drowning it. His master's dog was with him, and when the kitten was  thrown into the water, the dog sprang in and brought it back safely to  land. A second time the man threw it in, and again the dog rescued it;  and when for the third time the man tried to drown it, the dog, as  resolute to save the little helpless life as the man was to destroy it,  swam with it to the other side of the pool, running all the way home  with it, and safely depositing it before the kitchen fire; and \"ever  after\" they were inseparable, sharing even the same bed!    When not long ago I came across the noble sentiment that \"hecatombs of  brutes should be tortured, if man thereby could be saved one pang,\" I  found myself dimly wondering what constituted a \"brute.\" Certainly, in  the incident I have just given, the \"brute\" was not the dog!              S. W.      A CANINE MEMBER OF THE S.P.C.A.              [_June 18, 1892._]    If you think this little anecdote of canine friendliness worthy of the  _Spectator_, will you insert it for me? Last week a sick dog took up its  abode in the field behind our house, and after seeing the poor thing  lying there for some time, I took it food and milk-and-water. The next  day it was still there, and when I was going out to feed it, I saw that  a small pug was running about it, so I took a whip out with me to drive  it away. The pug planted itself between me and the sick dog, and barked  at me savagely, but at last I drove it away, and again gave food and  milk-and-water to my _protege_. The little pug watched me for a few  moments, and as soon as he felt quite assured that my intentions towards  the sick dog were friendly, it ran to me wagging its tail, leapt up to  my shoulder, and licked my face and hands, nor would it touch the water  till the invalid had had all it wanted. I suppose that it was satisfied  that its companion was in good hands, for it trotted happily away, and  did not appear upon the scene again.              VIOLET DAVIES.      A DOG'S COURTESY.              [_Nov. 29, 1890._]    In your article on Mr. Nettleship's pictures of animals, you note the  delicacy of a dog that has been properly trained in the matter of taking  its food. My little dog is not only most dainty in that particular, but  strictly observes the courtesy, which is natural, not taught, of not  beginning his dinner (served on white napery that is never soiled) until  his master begins his own. No amount of coaxing on the part of the  ladies (they do not wait) will induce him to eat if I am late: he merely  consents to have his muzzle taken off, inspects his dinner, and then  seeks his master's room, where he waits to accompany him in orderly  fashion downstairs.              C. HARPER.      CANINE JEALOUSY.              [_Dec. 12, 1891._]    I am not versed in dog-lore, and it may be that my love for the animal  makes me an ill judge of the importance of the following story; but a  friend vouches for its truth, and to my mind it has its importance, not  from its display of jealousy, but from the dog's deliberate acceptance  of the undoubtedly changed condition, and the clearly metaphysical  character of his motive.    The story is this. A young man had owned for some years a dog who was  his constant companion. Recently the young man married, and moved with  his bride and his dog into a house on the opposite side of the street  from his father's house, his own former home. The dog was not happy, for  the time and attention which had formerly been his was now given to the  young wife. In many ways he showed his unhappiness and displeasure, in  spite of the fact that the master tried to reconcile him and the bride  to win him. One day when the master came home, his wife sat on his  knee, while Jack was lying by the fire. He rose from his place, came  over to the couple, and expressed his disapproval. \"Why, Jack,\" said the  master, \"this is all right, she's a good girl,\" and as he spoke, he  patted her arm. Jack looked up at him, turned away, and left the room.  In a moment they heard a noise, and going into the hall, they found Jack  dragging his bed downstairs. When he reached the front door, he whined  to be let out, and when the door was opened, he dragged his bed down the  steps, across the street to his old home, where he scratched for  admittance. Since then he has never been back to his master, refusing  all overtures.              CHAS. MORRIS ADDISON.      A JEALOUS DOG.              [_Jan. 12, 1895._]    I was greatly interested in the story of the generosity shown by a dog,  as related in the _Spectator_ of January 5th, because of a similar case  within my own knowledge, and yet so different, as to prove that the  dispositions of animals are as varied as those of human beings. A friend  of mine had two fox-terriers, inseparable companions, and both equally  devoted to their mistress. On one occasion, when the family had been  away from home for some time, and were returning, one of these pets, not  being well, was brought back with its mistress, while the other was left  to follow with the horses, &c., and did not arrive for three days. On  entering the house, the dog had a very sullen appearance, took no notice  of any one, but searched everywhere till he found his companion; then  flew at his throat, and would have killed him but for timely succour!  Could any human being have indulged in a more rankling jealousy?              E. A. K.      A DOG THAT SCORNED TO BE JEALOUS.              [_Jan. 5, 1895._]    The following history of canine sympathy may interest your readers. I  was once the happy owner of a large and beautiful bull-terrier, Rose,  and at the same time of a still dearer, though less beautiful, little  mongrel, Fan, both passionately attached to a member of my household,  commonly called their best friend. A certain shawl belonging to this  adored friend was especially sacred in Fan's eyes. She never allowed any  one to touch it without remonstrance--Rose least of all--and when her  best friend was in bed, it was Fan's custom to ensconce herself in her  arms, and not to allow any dog, and only the most favoured of human  beings, to approach without violent growlings, if not worse. Fan was a  tiny grandmother who had long ruled the household; Rose, an  inexperienced newcomer. One day, in a fit of youthful folly, Rose jumped  over a gate and spiked herself badly, and was consigned for ten days to  the care of the veterinary surgeon. On her return, she was cordially  welcomed by Fan and myself; but when she rushed upstairs to the room of  her best friend (then confined to her bed), my mind forboded mischief.  We followed, and I opened the door. With one bound Rose flew into her  best friend's arms, taking Fan's very own place, and was lost in a  rapture of licking and being caressed. Fan flew after her, but to my  amazement, instead of the fury I expected, it was to join with heart and  tongue in the licking and caressing. She licked Rose as if she had been  a long-lost puppy, instead of an intruder; and then, of her own accord,  turned away, leaving Rose in possession, and took up a distant place on  the foot of the bed, appealing to me with an almost human expression of  mingled feelings--the heroic self-abnegation of new-born sympathy  struggling with natural jealousy. The better feelings triumphed (not, of  course, unsupported by human recognition and applause), till both dogs  fell asleep in their strangely reversed positions. After this, there was  a slight temporary failure in Fan's perhaps overstrained self-conquest;  but on the next day but one she actually, for the first (and last) time  in her life, made Rose welcome to a place beside her on the sacred  shawl; where again they slept side by side like sisters. This, however,  was the last gleam of the special sympathy called forth by Rose's  troubles. From that day Fan decidedly and finally resumed her jealous  occupation and guardianship of all sacred places and things, and  maintained it energetically to her life's end.              C. E.
