Wood puts it, of \"a fifth hand,\" being capable of use \"for any  purpose to which the hand could be applied,\" and for hooking out objects  from places \"where a hand could not be inserted.\" According to Mr. Wood  they wrap their tails about them to protect themselves from cold, to  which they are very sensitive, and hold on by them to the branches of  trees with such tenacity that they remain suspended after death. The  prehensile part of the tail is naked and of extreme sensibility. The  tail is also used to preserve balance when walking erect, for which  purpose it is thrown up and curled over. The appearance of these  monkeys, as they leap from branch to branch in their native woods,  swinging by their tails, and often hanging on to those of each other,  until a living bridge is formed from tree to tree, is exceedingly  picturesque.      The Howling Monkeys.    The Howling Monkeys form the single genus of the second sub-family of  the CebidA|--the genus Mycetes. There are a number of species, popularly  known as the \"Golden Howler,\" the \"Black Howler,\" &c. &c. They are  chiefly characteristic for the attribute to which they owe their name.  The howl is a loud mournful cry which can be heard at a great distance,  and is said by Wallace to proceed from the leader of the band who howls  for the whole company. These animals are larger and more clumsy than the  spider monkeys and therefore less agile; they have powerful, prehensile  tails. The \"Howler\" is much prized by the Indians as an article of food.      The Bearded Saki.    The third sub-family of the CebidA| includes some dozen species which  inhabit the forests of Equatorial America. They are of the genus  _Pithecia_, and some species have broad beards and bushy tails. The head  of the Bearded Saki (_Pithecia Satanas_) has a singularly human  appearance.      The Douroucouli.    The fourth sub-family of the CebidA| includes several genera and a number  of species, of these the Douroucouli (_Nyctipithecus felinus_) is one of  the most interesting. It is a small monkey, measuring only thirteen  inches, apart from its tail, which is eighteen inches long: It is  catlike in some of its habits, sleeping during the day, and prowling  about at night in search of food, which it finds in fruits, insects and  small birds. It has a catlike mew, though it often makes a louder cry  more resembling the noise of the jaguar.      The Marmosets.    The fifth family of the quadrumana comprises the marmosets, of which  there are two genera--the _Hapale_ and the _Midas_. These are very  small, measuring about eight inches without the tail, which is eleven  inches long. The marmoset is one of the prettiest of the monkeys, and,  though at first shy, soon becomes playful and affectionate. Marmosets  are one of the few species that breed in confinement. Sir William  Jardine describes a marmoset who gave birth to three offspring in Paris.  One of these, for some reason, displeased her, and she killed it, but  upon the others beginning to suck the maternal instinct awoke, and she  became as affectionate as she was before careless. \"The male seemed more  affectionate and careful of them than the mother, and assisted in the  charge. The young generally keep upon the back or under the belly of the  female, and Cuvier observed, that when the female was tired of carrying  them, she would approach the male with a shrill cry, who immediately  relieved her with his hands, placing them upon his back, or under his  belly, where they held themselves and were carried about until they  became restless for milk, when they were given over to the mother who,  in her turn, would again endeavour to get rid of them.\"      SUB-ORDER II. The Lemurs.    The lemurs and their allied forms make up the remaining families of the  quadrumana. These are three. The _LemuridA|_, of which there are many  species, most of which belong to Madagascar, others to Africa, Asia, and  the Indian Archipelago; the _TarsidA|_, which hail from Sumatra and  Borneo; and the _ChiromyidA|_, of which the aye-aye is the  representative. The _LemuridA|_ are divided into four sub-families by  Professor Mivart. I, the Indri; II, the true Lemurs; III, the slow  Lemurs and IV, the Galagos. The lemur is nocturnal in its habits and  noiseless in its movements. Some of its species much resemble the cat in  appearance though its four hands unmistakably demonstrate its order. Sir  William Jones describes a Slow Lemur (_Nycticebus tardigradus_), which  he had in his possession, as \"gentle except in the cold season, when his  temper seemed wholly changed.\" This animal expressed great resentment  when disturbed unseasonably. From half an hour after sunrise to half an  hour before sunset he slept without any intermission, rolled up like a  hedgehog: and as soon as he awoke he began to prepare himself for the  occupations of his approaching day, licking and dressing himself like a  cat--an operation which the flexibility of his neck and limbs enabled  him to perform very completely. He was then ready for a slight  breakfast, after which he commonly took a short nap; but when the sun  was quite set he recovered all his vivacity. \"Generally he was not  voracious, but of grasshoppers he never could have enough; and passed  the whole night during the hot season in prowling for them. He used all  his paws indifferently as hands.\" Mrs. Bowdich tells of one of these  animals, procured by Mr. Baird at Prince of Wales Island, who shared a  cage with a dog to whom he became greatly attached, while nothing could  reconcile him to a cat, which constantly jumped over his back, causing  him great annoyance.      The Tarsier.    The tarsier (_Tarsius spectrum_) is a small, kitten-faced animal with  long hind legs, which enable it to leap like a frog. It is nocturnal in  habit, and is found in Sumatra, Borneo, and elsewhere.      The Aye-Aye.    The aye-aye (_Chiromys madagascariensis_) is a remarkable little animal  resembling, as Professor Owen says, in size and shape the domestic cat,  its head and ears being larger, and its hind legs and tail longer than  those of the cat. Dr. Sandwich, writing of one he had in his possession,  says:--\"The thick sticks I put into his cage were bored in all  directions by a large and destructive grub, called the _montouk_. Just  at sunset the aye-aye crept from under his blanket, yawned, stretched  and betook himself to his tree. Presently he came to one of the  worm-eaten branches, which he began to examine most attentively, and  bending forward his ears, and applying his nose close to the bark, he  rapidly tapped the surface with the curious second digit, as a  woodpecker taps a tree, though with much less noise, from time to time  inserting the end of the slender finger into the worm-holes as a surgeon  would a probe. At length he came to a part of the branch which evidently  gave out an interesting sound, for he began to tear it with his strong  teeth. He rapidly stripped off the bark, cut into the wood, and exposed  the nest of a grub which he daintily picked out of its bed, with the  slender, tapping finger, and conveyed the luscious morsel to his mouth.  But I was yet to learn another peculiarity. I gave him water to drink in  a saucer, on which he stretched out his hand, dipped a finger into it  and drew it obliquely through his open mouth. After a while he lapped  like a cat, but his first mode of drinking appeared to me to be his way  of reaching water in the deep clefts of trees.\"      ORDER II.    Wing-Handed Animals.    The animals which most nearly resemble the four-handed animals or  quadrumana are the wing-handed animals,--the bats or _Cheiroptera_.  These are of singular appearance and interesting habit. \"If,\" says the  Rev. J. G. Wood, \"the fingers of a man were to be drawn out like wire to  about four feet in length, a thin membrane to extend from finger to  finger, and another membrane to fall from the little finger to the  ankles, he would make a very tolerable imitation of a bat.\"--Of course,  it should be added, making allowance for proportion, the full grown male  bat, of the largest species, rarely exceeding twelve inches in height  from head to foot. Bats' wings are highly nervous and sensitive, so much  so as to render their owners almost independent of sight. Besides being  \"well adapted for flight,\" says Dr. Percival Wright, \"they are still  capable in a small measure of seizing, differing thus from the anterior  limbs of Birds.\"      Bats.    Dr. Dobson divides the order _Cheiroptera_ into two sub-orders: I, The  Great Bats and II, The Smaller Bats. Of these there are numerous genera  and a large number of species. THE GREAT BATS abound in the tropical and  sub-tropical regions of the East, where they live on fruit, and from  this circumstance are classified as \"fruit-eating bats,\" though they are  sometimes called \"flying-foxes.\" The largest of these inhabit Sumatra  and Java, living in large companies, sleeping by day and foraging by  night. A large tree serves them for a sleeping-chamber, where,  suspending themselves head downwards from the branches, they wrap their  wings about them in lieu of blankets and sleep out the sunshine. After  sunset they gradually awake and proceed to ravage any fruit preserves  which may be within reach, committing serious depredations while the  owners outsleep the moon. According to Mr. Francis Day, \"they do very  great injury to cocoa-nut plantations and mangoe gardens.\" \"Their  habits,\" says Mr. Day, \"are very intemperate, and they often pass the  night drinking the toddy from the chatties in the cocoa-nut trees, which  results either in their returning home in the early morning in a state  of extreme and riotous intoxication, or in being found the next day at  the foot of the trees, sleeping off the effects of their midnight  debauch.\" THE SMALLER BATS include several families, numerous genera,  and a large number of species to be found in almost"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3796"],[0,"Rilla of Ingleside (#10)"],[1," Miss Cornelia were organizing a Red Cross. The doctor and  Mr. Meredith were rounding up the men for a Patriotic Society. Rilla,  after the first shock, reacted to the romance of it all, in spite of  her heartache. Jem certainly looked magnificent in his uniform. It was  splendid to think of the lads of Canada answering so speedily and  fearlessly and uncalculatingly to the call of their country. Rilla  carried her head high among the girls whose brothers had not so  responded. In her diary she wrote:      \"He goes to do what I had done    Had Douglas's daughter been his son,\"    and was sure she meant it. If she were a boy of course she would go,  too! She hadn't the least doubt of that.    She wondered if it was very dreadful of her to feel glad that Walter  hadn't got strong as soon as they had wished after the fever.    \"I couldn't bear to have Walter go,\" she wrote. \"I love Jem ever so  much but Walter means more to me than anyone in the world and I would  die if he had to go. He seems so changed these days. He hardly ever  talks to me. I suppose he wants to go, too, and feels badly because he  can't. He doesn't go about with Jem and Jerry at all. I shall never  forget Susan's face when Jem came home in his khaki. It worked and  twisted as if she were going to cry, but all she said was, 'You look  almost like a man in that, Jem.' Jem laughed. He never minds because  Susan thinks him just a child still. Everybody seems busy but me. I  wish there was something I could do but there doesn't seem to be  anything. Mother and Nan and Di are busy all the time and I just wander  about like a lonely ghost. What hurts me terribly, though, is that  mother's smiles, and Nan's, just seem put on from the outside. Mother's  eyes never laugh now. It makes me feel that I shouldn't laugh  either--that it's wicked to feel laughy. And it's so hard for me to  keep from laughing, even if Jem is going to be a soldier. But when I  laugh I don't enjoy it either, as I used to do. There's something  behind it all that keeps hurting me--especially when I wake up in the  night. Then I cry because I am afraid that Kitchener of Khartoum is  right and the war will last for years and Jem may be--but no, I won't  write it. It would make me feel as if it were really going to happen.  The other day Nan said, 'Nothing can ever be quite the same for any of  us again.' It made me feel rebellious. Why shouldn't things be the same  again--when everything is over and Jem and Jerry are back? We'll all be  happy and jolly again and these days will seem just like a bad dream.    \"The coming of the mail is the most exciting event of every day now.  Father just snatches the paper--I never saw father snatch before--and  the rest of us crowd round and look at the headlines over his shoulder.  Susan vows she does not and will not believe a word the papers say but  she always comes to the kitchen door, and listens and then goes back,  shaking her head. She is terribly indignant all the time, but she cooks  up all the things Jem likes especially, and she did not make a single  bit of fuss when she found Monday asleep on the spare-room bed  yesterday right on top of Mrs. Rachel Lynde's apple-leaf spread. 'The  Almighty only knows where your master will be having to sleep before  long, you poor dumb beast,' she said as she put him quite gently out.  But she never relents towards Doc. She says the minute he saw Jem in  khaki he turned into Mr. Hyde then and there and she thinks that ought  to be proof enough of what he really is. Susan is funny, but she is an  old dear. Shirley says she is one half angel and the other half good  cook. But then Shirley is the only one of us she never scolds.    \"Faith Meredith is wonderful. I think she and Jem are really engaged  now. She goes about with a shining light in her eyes, but her smiles  are a little stiff and starched, just like mother's. I wonder if I  could be as brave as she is if I had a lover and he was going to the  war. It is bad enough when it is your brother. Bruce Meredith cried all  night, Mrs. Meredith says, when he heard Jem and Jerry were going. And  he wanted to know if the 'K of K.' his father talked about was the King  of Kings. He is the dearest kiddy. I just love him--though I don't  really care much for children. I don't like babies one bit--though when  I say so people look at me as if I had said something perfectly  shocking. Well, I don't, and I've got to be honest about it. I don't  mind looking at a nice clean baby if somebody else holds it--but I  wouldn't touch it for anything and I don't feel a single real spark of  interest in it. Gertrude Oliver says she just feels the same. (She is  the most honest person I know. She never pretends anything.) She says  babies bore her until they are old enough to talk and then she likes  them--but still a good ways off. Mother and Nan and Di all adore babies  and seem to think I'm unnatural because I don't.    \"I haven't seen Kenneth since the night of the party. He was here one  evening after Jem came back but I happened to be away. I don't think he  mentioned me at all--at least nobody told me he did and I was  determined I wouldn't ask--but I don't care in the least. All that  matters absolutely nothing to me now. The only thing that does matter  is that Jem has volunteered for active service and will be going to  Valcartier in a few more days--my big, splendid brother Jem. Oh, I'm so  proud of him!    \"I suppose Kenneth would enlist too if it weren't for his ankle. I  think that is quite providential. He is his mother's only son and how  dreadful she would feel if he went. Only sons should never think of  going!\"    Walter came wandering through the valley as Rilla sat there, with his  head bent and his hands clasped behind him. When he saw Rilla he turned  abruptly away; then as abruptly he turned and came back to her.    \"Rilla-my-Rilla, what are you thinking of?\"    \"Everything is so changed, Walter,\" said Rilla wistfully. \"Even  you--you're changed. A week ago we were all so happy--and--and--now I  just can't find myself at all. I'm lost.\"    Walter sat down on a neighbouring stone and took Rilla's little  appealing hand.    \"I'm afraid our old world has come to an end, Rilla. We've got to face  that fact.\"    \"It's so terrible to think of Jem,\" pleaded Rilla. \"Sometimes I forget  for a little while what it really means and feel excited and proud--and  then it comes over me again like a cold wind.\"    \"I envy Jem!\" said Walter moodily.    \"Envy Jem! Oh, Walter you--you don't want to go too.\"    \"No,\" said Walter, gazing straight before him down the emerald vistas  of the valley, \"no, I don't want to go. That's just the trouble. Rilla,  I'm afraid to go. I'm a coward.\"    \"You're not!\" Rilla burst out angrily. \"Why, anybody would be afraid to  go. You might be--why, you might be killed.\"    \"I wouldn't mind that if it didn't hurt,\" muttered Walter. \"I don't  think I'm afraid of death itself--it's of the pain that might come  before death--it wouldn't be so bad to die and have it over--but to  keep on dying! Rilla, I've always been afraid of pain--you know that. I  can't help it--I shudder when I think of the possibility of being  mangled or--or blinded. Rilla, I cannot face that thought. To be  blind--never to see the beauty of the world again--moonlight on Four  Winds--the stars twinkling through the fir-trees--mist on the gulf. I  ought to go--I ought to want to go--but I don't--I hate the thought of  it--I'm ashamed--ashamed.\"    \"But, Walter, you couldn't go anyhow,\" said Rilla piteously. She was  sick with a new terror that Walter would go after all. \"You're not  strong enough.\"    \"I am. I've felt as fit as ever I did this last month. I'd pass any  examination--I know it. Everybody thinks I'm not strong yet--and I'm  skulking behind that belief. I--I should have been a girl,\" Walter  concluded in a burst of passionate bitterness.    \"Even if you were strong enough, you oughtn't to go,\" sobbed Rilla.  \"What would mother do? She's breaking her heart over Jem. It would kill  her to see you both go.\"    \"Oh, I'm not going--don't worry. I tell you I'm afraid to go--afraid. I  don't mince the matter to myself. It's a relief to own up even to you,  Rilla. I wouldn't confess it to anybody else--Nan and Di would despise  me. But I hate the whole thing--the horror, the pain, the ugliness. War  isn't a khaki uniform or a drill parade--everything I've read in old  histories haunts me. I lie awake at night and see things that have  happened--see the blood and filth and misery of it all. And a bayonet  charge! If I could face the other things I could never face that. It  turns me sick to think of it--sicker even to think of giving it than  receiving it--to think of thrusting a bayonet through another man.\"  Walter writhed and shuddered. \"I think of these things all the  time--and it doesn't seem to me that Jem and Jerry ever think of them.  They laugh and talk about 'potting Huns'! But it maddens me to see them  in the khaki. And they think I'm grumpy because I'm not fit to go.\"    Walter laughed bitterly. \"It is not a nice thing to feel yourself a  coward.\" But Rilla got her arms about him and cuddled her head on his  shoulder. She was so glad he didn't want to go--for just one minute she  had been horribly frightened. And it was so nice to have Walter  confiding his troubles to her--to her, not Di. She didn't feel so  lonely and superfluous any longer.    \"Don't you despise me, Rilla-my-Rilla?\" asked Walter wistfully.  Somehow, it hurt him to think Rilla might despise him--hurt him as much  as if it had been Di. He realized suddenly how very fond he was of this  adoring kid sister with her appealing eyes and troubled, girlish face.    \"No, I don't. Why, Walter, hundreds of people feel just as you do. You  know what that verse of Shakespeare in the old Fifth Reader says--'the  brave man is not he who feels no fear.'\"    \"No--but it is 'he whose"]]]
