Thighs orange-yellow; labial stripe white; iris bronze\" (Duellman, field  notes, July 10, 1964.)    _Remarks._--Smith (1953:150) named _cyanosticta_ as a subspecies of  _Hyla phaeota_. The differences in cranial characters and certain  external characters between _phaeota_ and _cyanosticta_ indicate that  they are distinct species. Furthermore, a gap of about 350 kilometers  exists between the known geographic ranges of the two kinds.    _Distribution._--_Smilisca cyanosticta_ inhabits wet forests on the  Atlantic slope of southern Mexico and northern Central America from  northern Oaxaca and southern Veracruz through northern Chiapas in Mexico  and into El Peten and northern Alta Verapaz in Guatemala (Fig. 2).  Apparently the range is discontinuous, for in southern Mexico the  species is found in cloud forest at elevations of 830 to 900 meters on  the northern slopes of the Sierra de Juarez. In the Sierra de Los  Tuxtlas in southern Veracruz the species is found in wet forest at  elevations of 300 to 1200 meters, but is absent in the intervening  lowlands characterized by drier forest. In the west forests of northern  Alta Verapaz and El Peten, Guatemala, the species is found at low  elevations.    _Specimens examined._--78, as follows: MEXICO: =Chiapas=: Monte Libano,  MCZ 28271-9; 8 km.

Aside from the data summarized in Table 2, the average ratio of tibia  length to snout-vent length is noticeably less in Colombian specimens  (53.4 per cent, as compared with 54.8 to 57.8 per cent in the other  samples) and the ratio of head length to snout-vent length is  noticeably less in Costa Rican specimens (33.5 per cent as compared with  34.9 to 35.1 per cent in the other samples). Also, specimens from  Heredia Province, Costa Rica, have a relatively smaller tympanum (62.7  to 80.4 [mean 68.4] per cent of the diameter of the eye, as compared  with means of 74.0 to 77.9 per cent in the other samples).    Two populations are distinctive as regards the size of adult males.  Specimens from the northern Caribbean lowlands of Nicaragua (Bonanza,  the northernmost locality for the species) are remarkably small. Males  having snout-vent lengths of between 40 and 43 mm. were breeding; the  largest male found had a snout-vent length of 47.7 mm. The other extreme  in size is attained in specimens from the Pacific lowlands of eastern  Costa Rica and western Panama, where most breeding males have snout-vent  lengths of more than 55 mm.; the largest male had a snout-vent length of  64.9 mm.    The rather striking differences in size among certain samples and the  minor differences in proportions among other samples show no geographic  trends. Instead, the variations apparently are random among the samples.  The data presented here possibly are the results of inadequate sampling,  but more likely reflect actual differences in the populations.    The dorsal ground color of _Smilisca phaeota_ is pale green to tan; the  venter is creamy white. The dorsum is variously marked with dark  olive-green or dark brown spots or blotches (Pl. 6C). A dark  interorbital bar is usually present. Usually a large dark dorsal mark  extends from the occiput to the sacral region, but in many individuals  this blotch is replaced by two or three dark marks. The dorsal markings  are irregular in shape and do not tend to form transverse bands or  longitudinal bars. The hind limbs are marked by dark transverse bands,  usually four or five on the thigh, five or six on the shank, and four on  the tarsus. Two or three narrow bands are usually present on the  proximal part of the fourth toe. The webbing on the feet is brown. The  loreal region is pale green, bordered above by a narrow dark brown  canthal stripe extending from the nostril to the orbit. The upper lip is  silvery white. A broad dark brown or black mark extends posteriorly from  the orbit, encompassing the tympanum, to a point above the insertion of  the forelimb. The flanks are pale green or pale tan and marked with a  fine dark brown or black venation. The anterior surfaces of the thighs  usually are pale brown or grayish tan, sometimes having small,  indistinct darker flecks. The posterior surfaces of the thighs are  similarly colored, but in most specimens small but distinct dark flecks  are present; in some specimens small cream-colored spots are also  present on the posterior surfaces of the thighs. A distinct, narrow  creamy white anal stripe usually is present. A distinct white stripe is  present "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37839"],[0,"My Experiences in Manipur and the Naga Hills (#10)"],[1," it was utterly  impossible that I, as their representative, could quietly stand by,  and see a savage massacre perpetrated, within sight of our station of  Samagudting. There is no doubt that this would have speedily followed  had I sent the people away without acceding to their wishes. Of course,  I might have used my influence with Mozuma to prevent a raid in this  particular instance, but that would have been giving protection, and,  I argued, if we give protection, let us get a little revenue to help  to pay for it. Why should all the advantage be on one side? Besides  a half-and-half policy would never have succeeded. \"Thorough\" should  be the motto of all who deal with savage and half-civilised races;  a promise to refer to Government is of little avail when people are  thinking of each other's blood. Action, immediate action, is what  is required. A failure to realise this, brought on later the Mozuma  expedition of 1877-78, in which a valuable officer lost his life.    Besides the obvious objections I have pointed out, any attempt to make  terms in favour of one village after another by negotiations with  their adversaries, would have involved us in so many complications,  that it would probably have ended in a combination against us.    I reported the matter to Government, and before I could receive any  answer, the village of Sitekima which had a feud with Sephema came  in and asked for the same favour to be accorded to it, as had been  granted to Mezeffina. I accordingly took them over on the same terms,  and again issued a proclamation calling on all people to respect  their rights as British subjects.    Soon after I heard from the Chief Commissioner of Assam, directing  me to take over no more villages without a reference. However, this  could not be, there was no telegraph in those days, and the tide in  favour of asking for our protection had set in in earnest, and must be  taken at the flood. \"Vestigia nulla retrorsum\" there was no retreat;  and having acted according to my judgment for the best interests of  the State, I felt bound to take further responsibility on myself,  when necessary. Accordingly when the little village of Phenina applied  for protection and offered revenue, I at once acceded, and accepted  their allegiance as British subjects, with the result that they were  left in peace by their powerful neighbours, and had no more anxiety  as to their safety. Phenina was followed by several other villages,  to whom I granted the same terms.    The Mozuma Nagas were always an intelligent set of men, and liked  to be in the forefront of any movement. Seeing the part that other  villages were taking, they came forward and offered to pay revenue,  if we would establish a guard of police in their village, and set up  a school for their children to attend. This was a question involving  a considerable expenditure of money, and as they were not in need of  protection, I felt that I could not accede to their request without  further reference, but I sent on the proposal to Government with a  strong recommendation that it should be adopted. The consideration of  it was put off for a time, and when very tardily my recommendation  was accepted, the Mozuma people had, as I predicted, changed their  minds. Such cases are of constant occurrence. When will our rulers  take the story of the Sibylline books to heart?    The question of education generally, was one that greatly  interested me, my success in Keonjhur [12] in the tributary Mehals  of Orissa, where I had introduced schools, having been very great. In  combination with other suggestions, I strongly urged the advisability  of establishing a regular system of education, including religious  instruction, under a competent clergyman of the Church of England. I  pointed out that the Nagas had no religion; that they were highly  intelligent and capable of receiving civilisation; that with it  they would want a religion, and that we might just as well give  them our own, and make them in that way a source of strength, by  thus mutually attaching them to us. Failing this, I predicted that,  following the example of other hill-tribes, they would sooner or later  become debased Hindoos or Mussulmans, and in the latter case, as we  knew by experience, be a constant source of trouble and annoyance,  Mussulman converts in Assam and Eastern Bengal, being a particularly  disagreeable and bigoted set. My suggestion did not find favour with  the authorities, and I deeply regret it. A fine, interesting race  like the Angamis, might, as a Christian tribe, occupy a most useful  position on our Eastern Frontier, and I feel strongly that we are not  justified in allowing them to be corrupted and gradually \"converted\"  by the miserable, bigoted, caste-observing Mussulman of Bengal, men who  have not one single good quality in common with the manly Afghans, and  other real Mussulman tribes. I do not like to think it, but, unless we  give the Nagas a helping hand in time, such is sure to be their fate,  and we shall have ourselves to thank when they are utterly corrupted.    The late General Dalton, C.S.I., when Commissioner of Chota Nagpure,  did his utmost to aid Christian Mission among the wild Kols; his  argument being like mine, that they wanted a religion, and that  were they Christians, they would be a valuable counterpoise in time  of trouble to the vast non-Christian population of Behar. In the  same way it cannot be doubted, that a large population of Christian  hill-men between Assam and Burmah, would be a valuable prop to the  State. Properly taught and judiciously handled, the Angamis would  have made a fine manly set of Christians, of a type superior to most  Indian native converts, and probably devoted to our rule. As things  stand at present, I fear they will be gradually corrupted and lose the  good qualities, which have made them attractive in the past, and that,  as time goes on, unless some powerful counter influence is brought to  bear on them, they will adopt the vile, bigoted type of Mahommedanism  prevalent in Assam and Cachar, and instead of becoming a tower of  strength to us, be a perpetual weakness and source of annoyance. I  earnestly hope that I may be wrong, and that their future may be as  bright a one as I could wish for them.                CHAPTER V.

Once more before the weather began to be unpleasantly hot, we went  down to Dimapur that I might inspect the road and a rest house being  built at Nowkatta. Dimapur though hot, was pleasant enough in the  evening, when I used to row my wife about on the large tank in a  canoe which just held us both. We could see a few feet below the  surface, the remains of the post set up when a tank is dedicated to  the deity. This post is usually many feet above the water, but here  it had rotted away from age. On a tree close to the rest house I shot  a chestnut coloured flying squirrel.    One sultry afternoon I rode out alone to Nowkatta. About half-way  I was stopped by a sudden storm, one of the most terrific I have  ever seen; the wind howled through the forest, and the trees swayed  to and fro literally like blades of grass. As the storm increased,  trees were torn up by the roots right and left, and some that were  very firmly rooted were shattered in pieces. Many of these trees  were 80 to 120 feet in height, and large in proportion, but the  wind was so high that I never heard the sound of the crash. I hardly  expected to escape being crushed by a falling tree, and nothing but  the extreme activity of my pony, a little Manipuri, saved me. I was  at length enabled to get on to Nowkatta, but as I returned, I had  much difficulty in making my way through the masses of fallen trees  which formed an obstacle often six feet in height, and I could only  pass them by penetrating the dense underwood, and riding round one end.    I returned to Dimapur later than I expected and drenched by the  soaking rain. Next day we went back to Samagudting very glad to  be again in a cooler atmosphere. We both paid for our visit to the  lowlands in a sharp attack of intermittent fever. Luckily, my wife  speedily recovered; but it told on my system, already saturated with  malaria and was the forerunner of constant attacks.    Except for its unhealthiness, Dimapur was a nice place, and, if  properly opened out, and cultivated, the country would be far more  salubrious. For this reason I advocated families being induced to  settle there as cultivators; and I had a scheme for establishing a  Police Militia Reserve in that district. I thought that a certain  number of the Naga Hills police might with advantage be discharged  every year and enlisted as reserve men, liable to serve when needed  in case of trouble; a reduced rate of pay to be given to each man,  and a grant of land to cultivate. I believe the system would have  worked well, but it was not sanctioned.    An incident occurred in the month of August which might have proved  serious. A native of a Kutcha Naga village within sight of Samagudting  came to complain that, while gathering wild tea-seed for sale, he  had been driven off by a Konoma Naga. Konoma, though not the most  populous village, had long been considered the most powerful and  warlike in the hills, and a threat from one of its members was almost a  sentence of death to a man from a weak village. The Merema clan also,  one of the worst in the hills for lawless deeds, had never made its  submission to Captain Butler, though it had on one occasion to his  predecessor. On hearing the man's complaint, I at once sent off a  message by a Naga calling upon the chiefs of Konoma to come in to me,  and"]]]
