The words with which Whewell closes his  chapter on the 'Mysticism of the Middle Ages' have their application to  the mysticism of the nineteenth century:--'Experience collects her  stores in vain, or ceases to collect them, when she can only pour them  into the flimsy folds of the lap of Mysticism, who is, in truth, so much  absorbed in looking for the treasures which are to fall from the skies,  that she heeds little how scantily she obtains, or how loosely she  holds, such riches as she might find beside her.'          II.    _THE RELIGION OF THE GREAT PYRAMID._      During the last few years a new sect has appeared which, though as yet  small in numbers, is full of zeal and fervour. The faith professed by  this sect may be called the religion of the Great Pyramid, the chief  article of their creed being the doctrine that that remarkable edifice  was built for the purpose of revealing--in the fulness of time, now  nearly accomplished--certain noteworthy truths to the human race. The  founder of the pyramid religion is described by one of the present  leaders of the sect as 'the late worthy John Taylor, of Gower Street,  London;' but hitherto the chief prophets of the new faith have been in  this country Professor Smyth, Astronomer Royal for Scotland, and in  France the Abbe Moigno. I propose to examine here some of the facts most  confidently urged by pyramidalists in support of their views.    But it will be well first to indicate briefly the doctrines of the new  faith. They may be thus presented:    The great pyramid was erected, it would seem, under the instructions of  a certain Semitic king, probably no other than Melchizedek. By  supernatural means, the architects were instructed to place the pyramid  in latitude 30 deg. north; to select for its figure that of a square  pyramid, carefully oriented; to employ for their unit of length the  sacred cubit corresponding to the 20,000,000th part of the earth's  polar axis; and to make the side of the square base equal to just so  many of these sacred cubits as there are days and parts of a day in a  year. They were further, by supernatural help, enabled to square the  circle, and symbolised their victory over this problem by making the  pyramid's height bear to the perimeter of the base the ratio which the  radius of a circle bears to the circumference. Moreover, the great  precessional period, in which the earth's axis gyrates like that of some  mighty top around the perpendicular to the ecliptic, was communicated to  the builders with a degree of accuracy far exceeding that of the best  modern determinations, and they were instructed to symbolise that  relation in the dimensions of the pyramid's base. A value of the sun's  distance more accurate by far than modern astronomers have obtained  (even since the recent transit) was imparted to them, and they embodied  that dimension in the height of the pyramid. Other results which modern  science has achieved, but which by merely human means the architects of  the pyramid could not have obtained, were also supernaturally  communicated to them; so that the true mean density of the earth, her  true shape, the configuration of land and water, the mean temperature of  the earth's surface, and so forth, were either symbolised in the great  pyramid's position, or in the shape and dimensions of its exterior and  interior. In the pyramid also were preserved the true, because  supernaturally communicated, standards of length, area, capacity,  weight, density, heat, time, and money. The pyramid also indicated, by  certain features of its interior structure, that when it was built the  holy influences of the Pleiades were exerted from a most effective  position--the meridian, through the points where the ecliptic and  equator intersect. And as the pyramid thus significantly refers to the  past, so also it indicates the future history of the earth, especially  in showing when and where the millennium is to begin. Lastly, the apex  or crowning stone of the pyramid was no other than the antitype of that  stone of stumbling and rock of offence, rejected by builders who knew  not its true use, until it was finally placed as the chief stone of the  corner. Whence naturally, 'whosoever shall fall upon it'--that is, upon  the pyramid religion--'shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall  it will grind him to powder.'    If we examine the relations actually presented by the great pyramid--its  geographical position, dimensions, shape, and internal  structure--without hampering ourselves with the tenets of the new faith  on the one hand, or on the other with any serious anxiety to disprove  them, we shall find much to suggest that the builders of the pyramid  were ingenious mathematicians, who had made some progress in astronomy,  though not so much as they had made in the mastery of mechanical and  scientific difficulties.    The first point to be noticed is the geographical position of the great  pyramid, so far, at least, as this position affects the aspect of the  heavens, viewed from the pyramid as from an observatory. Little  importance, I conceive, can be attached to purely geographical relations  in considering the pyramid's position. Professor Smyth notes that the  pyramid is peculiarly placed with respect to the mouth of the Nile,  standing 'at the southern apex of the Delta-land of Egypt.' This region  being shaped like a fan, the pyramid, set at the part corresponding to  the handle, was, he considers, 'that monument pure and undefiled in its  religion through an idolatrous land, alluded to by Isaiah; the monument  which was both \"an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt,  and a pillar at the border thereof,\" and destined withal to become a  witness in the latter days, and before the consummation of all things,  to the same Lord, and to what He hath purposed upon man kind.' Still  more fanciful are some other notes upon the pyramid's geographical  position: as (i.) that there is more land along the meridian of the  pyramid than on any other all the world round; (ii.) that there is more  land in the latitude of the pyramid than in any other; and (iii.) that  the pyramid territory of Lower Egypt is at the centre of the dry land  habitable by man all the world over.    It does not seem to be noticed by those who call our attention to these  points that such coincidences prove too much. It might be regarded as  not a mere accident that the great pyramid stands at the centre of the  arc of shore-line along which lie the outlets of the Nile; or it might  be regarded as not a mere coincidence that the great pyramid stands at  the central point of all the habitable land-surface of the globe; or,  again, any one of the other relations above mentioned might be regarded  as something more than a mere coincidence. But if, instead of taking  only one or other of these four relations, we take all four of them, or  even any two of them, together, we must regard peculiarities of the  earth's configuration as the result of special design which certainly  have not hitherto been so regarded by geographers. For instance, if it  was by a special design that the pyramid was placed at the centre of the  Nile delta, and also by special design that the pyramid was placed at  the centre of the land-surface of the earth, if these two relations are  each so exactly fulfilled as to render the idea of mere accidental  coincidence inadmissible, then it follows, of necessity, that it is  through no merely accidental coincidence that the centre of the Nile  delta lies at the centre of the land-surface of the earth; in other  words, the shore-line along which lie the mouths of the Nile has been  designedly curved so as to have its centre so placed. And so of the  other relations. The very fact that the four conditions _can_ be  fulfilled simultaneously is evidence that a coincidence of the sort may  result from mere accident.[16] Indeed, the peculiarity of geographical  position which really seems to have been in the thoughts of the pyramid  architects, introduces yet a fifth condition which by accident could be  fulfilled along with the four others.    It would seem that the builders of the pyramid were anxious to place it  in latitude 30 deg., as closely as their means of observation permitted.  Let us consider what result they achieved, and the evidence thus afforded  respecting their skill and scientific attainments. In our own time, of  course, the astronomer has no difficulty in determining with great  exactness the position of any given latitude-parallel. But at the time  when the great pyramid was built it must have been a matter of very  serious difficulty to determine the position of any required  latitude-parallel with a great degree of exactitude. The most obvious  way of dealing with the difficulty would have been by observing the  length of shadows thrown by upright posts at noon in spring and autumn.  In latitude 30 deg. north, the sun at noon in spring (or, to speak  precisely, on the day of the vernal equinox) is just twice as far from  the horizon as he is from the point vertically overhead; and if a  pointed post were set exactly upright at true noon (supposed to occur at  the moment of the vernal or autumnal equinox), the shadow of the post  would be exactly half as long as a line drawn from the top of the pole  to the end of the shadow. But observations based on this principle would  have presented many difficulties to the architects of the pyramid. The  sun not being a point of light, but a globe, the shadow of a pointed rod  does not end in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26558"],[0,"Pennsylvania Dutch Cooking (#10)"],[1,"20 minutes).
