Thick sweet cream whipped or plain,  sets off cold cobbler wonderfully to the average palate.    _Fried Pies_: To be perfect these must be made of sun-dried peaches,  very bright and sweet, but any sort of sound dried fruit will serve at a  pinch. Soak overnight after washing in three waters, simmer five hours  in the soaking water, with a plate to hold the fruit under, mash and  sweeten while hot, adding spices to taste--cinnamon, nutmeg and grated  lemon peel for apples, cloves and ginger--a bare zest--for peaches or  apricots. Roll out short paste into rounds the size of a small plate,  cover one-half with the fruit, fold over the empty half, pinch well  together around the edges, and fry in deep fat, blazing hot, to a rich  quick brown on both sides. Drain on paper napkins, sprinkling lightly  with sugar. Serve hot or cold. Most excellent for impromptu luncheons or  very late suppers--withal wholesome. A famous doctor said often of them,  \"You would be only the better for eating an acre of them.\"    _Green Apple Pie_: Take apples a little bigger than the thumb's end, cut  off stalks and nibs, and slice crosswise in three, dropping them in  water as sliced to save discoloration. Make a rich syrup--three cups  sugar, one cup water, to four cups sliced fruit. Boil and skim, throw in  the apples, with a blade or so of mace, and cook quickly until preserved  through. Either bake between crust in the common way, or bake crust  crisp after pricking well, and spread with the preserved fruit. Else  make into small turnovers, but bake instead of frying them--and be sure  the oven is hot enough to brown, but not to burn. Or you may make the  green apples into shortcake, putting fruit only between the layers of  crust, and serving with rich sauce or sweetened cream.    _Lemon Custard_: (M. L. Williams.) Separate and beat very light, the  yolks and whites of six eggs. Beat into the yolks very smoothly one  pound of sugar, then half a pound of creamed butter. Mix well, then add  the beaten whites, followed by the strained juice and grated yellow peel  of two large or three small lemons. Beat five minutes longer, pour into  pans lined with puff paste, pop into a hot oven and bake to a bright  brown. Meringue can be added but is not necessary save for ornament.    _Cream Pie_: (M. L. Williams.) Beat three eggs very light with a heaping  cup of sugar, add two cups sifted flour, mix smooth, then put in half a  cup of rich sour cream with half-teaspoon soda dissolved in it. Mix, put  instantly into shallow pans, bake in a quick oven and serve hot with or  without sauce.    _Damson and Banana Tart_: (M. W. Watkins.) An heirloom in the relator's  family, coming down from English forebears. Line an agate or earthen  pie dish two to three inches deep, with very good crust, rolled thin,  but not stretched nor dragged. Cover it with bananas, sliced thin,  lengthwise, strew over three tablespoonfuls of sugar, and a pinch of  grated lemon peel. Sprinkle with a liqueur glass of rum or brandy or  whiskey, then put in a layer of preserved plums--damsons are best--along  with their juice. If there is room repeat the layers--bananas and plums  and seasoning. Cover with a crust rolled fairly thin, prick and bake  three-quarters of an hour in a moderately quick oven. Serve either hot  or cold, preferably hot, with this sauce. One egg beaten very light,  with a cupful of cream, a wineglass of rum, brandy or sherry, and a  larger glass of preserve syrup. Mix over hot water, stirring hard all  the time till it begins to thicken. It must not get too thick.    _Amber Pie_: (Mrs. J. R. Oldham.) Beat yolks of four eggs very light,  with two heaping cups sugar, large spoonful melted butter, rounding  teaspoon sifted flour, cup buttermilk, cup seeded raisins, teaspoon  cinnamon, pinch each of cloves, alspice and nutmeg, two whites of egg  beaten very stiff. Half bake crust, then pour in batter and cook slowly  until done. Cover with meringue made by beating two egg-whites with two  teaspoons cold water, a few grains of salt, and one cup sugar. Add sugar  gradually after eggs are very light. Use at once--it will fall by  standing. Let the meringue barely color in the oven. Serve hot or cold.    _Jelly Pie_: (Louise Williams.) Beat the yolks of four eggs very light,  with a cup of sugar, three-quarters cup creamed butter, and a glass of  jelly, the tarter the better. Add a tablespoonful vanilla and a  dessert-spoonful of sifted cornmeal, then the whites of eggs beaten very  stiff. Bake in crusts--this makes two fat pies. Meringue is  optional--and unnecessary.    _Cheese Cakes_: Beat until very light the yolks of twelve eggs with a  pound of sugar, add to them a tablespoonful cornstarch, then  three-quarters of a pound of butter, washed and creamed. Add also the  strained juice of two lemons, a teaspoonful lemon essence and a  teaspoonful vanilla. Set over boiling water and stir until all  ingredients blend--only thus can you dissolve granulated sugar, which is  best to use, lacking the old-fashioned live open-kettle brown. Keep over  the hot water, stirring well together as you fill the tart shells. They  must be lined with real puff paste, rolled very thin, and nicely fitted.  Set in broad shallow pans, after filling with the batter and bake in a  quick, but not scorching oven. A blanched almond, or bit of citron, or  half a pecan or walnut meat, may be put in each shell before filling. I  prefer though to add such frills by help of the frosting. To make it,  beat six egg-whites with a pinch of salt until they stick to the dish,  add to them a little at a time, three cups granulated sugar boiled with  a cup and a half of water, till it spins a thread. Keep the syrup  boiling while adding it. When it is all in, set the pan of frosting over  boiling water, add six drops lemon juice and beat until stiff enough to  hold shape. It must not touch the water, but have plenty of steam  rising underneath. Frost the tarts rather thickly, and stick either a  shred of citron, a quarter of Maraschino cherry, or half a nut in the  middle. If you like cocoanut flavor, strew freshly grated cocoanut over  while the frosting is soft--it ought to harden inside half an hour. Tiny  pink or green comfits stuck in the middle, or set in threes  triangularly, are very decorative. Indeed, there is no limit but taste  and invention to the manners of making beautiful these tarts. I rather  pride myself upon them, since they have been enthusiastically praised by  folk who have eaten all around the world, and set above the best of  French confections by a man ten years resident in Paris, whose wife is  held to be the most skilled amateur cook in New York.    Grated cocoanut or raw grated apple stirred into the batter before  baking, varies the cheese cakes--and to some palates improves it. I  myself find nothing quite to equal the cheese cake of my  childhood--which had a full pound of butter to the pound of sugar, and  no frills of frosting, though strips of citron were often latticed over  the pans after the crust was in. Prick crust always very well before  filling--thus the tarts will be shapely instead of caricatures.    _Sweet Potato Custard_: Boil tender two large or four medium sweet  potatoes, peel, free of strings, and mash fine. Add to the pulp half a  pound of creamed butter, mix well, then add gradually five cups sugar,  alternately with five whole eggs. Beat smooth, add the juice of three  lemons, a tablespoonful lemon essence, and a scant pint of very rich  milk. Use less milk if the potatoes are very soft. Beat smooth and pour  into pie pans lined with good crust. Bake brown in a quick oven, but do  not over-bake. Lest the proportion of sugar may seem excessive, let it  be said here that sweet potatoes require more sugar for sweetening than  anything save crabapples or green gooseberries.    _Sweet Potato Pie_: Line a deep pie pan with short crust rolled a  quarter-inch thick, fill it with raw sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced  thin. Add to them, for a pan of medium size, three cups sugar, a cup of  butter, cut in bits, mace, cloves and nutmeg to taste, half a cup cold  water and half a cup good whiskey or sherry. Cover with a crust an  eighth-inch thick, prick well, also cut a tiny cross in middle, and bake  in a hot, but not scorching oven, three-quarters of an hour--a full hour  if the pan is large. Turning another pan, fitting the rim over, helps to  make the baking sure and even. Remove the cover pan ten minutes before  taking up. Serve hot. This requires no sauce.    _Apple Custard_: Beat four eggs very light with three cups sugar, one  cup butter, cup and a half rich milk--the richer the better. Stir in at  the very last, one quart grated apple, flavor with nutmeg or vanilla,  and bake in crusts. If wanted richer, dot raisins seeded and soaked in  whiskey, or shred citron over the top before baking.    _Molasses Pie_: (M. W. Watkins.) Cream well together one large cup  granulated sugar, and one heaping tablespoonful of butter, add when very  light the well-beaten yolks of three eggs, and a large cup of rich  molasses. Flavor with one teaspoonful grated nutmeg, then beat in, at  the very last, the whites of the eggs frothed as stiff as possible. Bake  in pans lined with rich crust until firm. Meringue can be added, but the  pies do not need it.    _Mystery Pie_: (Louise Williams.) Beat separately very light, the yolks  and whites of four eggs. Beat with the yolks a cup and a half of sugar,  three heaping tablespoonfuls of butter, two teaspoonfuls mixed spices,  either beaten or powdered fine, one cup of tart dark jelly, one cup  blackberry jam, and one cup sweet milk. Add last of all the egg-whites,  mix in well, then pour in pans lined with rich paste, and bake until  firm.    _Butter Scotch Pie_: (Leslie Fox.) Beat light two egg-yolks with one  scant cup dark brown sugar, one tablespoonful creamed butter, and two  tablespoonfuls flour. Mix smooth,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28497"],[0,"Myths of the Norsemen: From the Eddas and Sagas (#10)"],[1,"andals, and he  intended looking out from thence, instead of waiting until he had  mounted his throne. But, although so cunningly contrived, this plan  was frustrated by Frigga, who, divining his purpose, waited until he  was sound asleep, and then noiselessly turned his couch so that he  should face her favourites. Then she sent word to the Winilers to dress  their women in armour and send them out in battle array at dawn, with  their long hair carefully combed down over their cheeks and breasts.          \"Take thou thy women-folk,      Maidens and wives:      Over your ankles      Lace on the white war-hose;      Over your bosoms      Link up the hard mail-nets;      Over your lips      Plait long tresses with cunning;--      So war beasts full-bearded      King Odin shall deem you,      When off the grey sea-beach      At sunrise ye greet him.\"                The Longbeards' Saga (Charles Kingsley).      These instructions were carried out with scrupulous exactness, and  when Odin awoke the next morning his first conscious glance fell upon  their armed host, and he exclaimed in surprise, \"What Longbeards are  those?\" (In German the ancient word for long beards was Langobarden,  which was the name used to designate the Lombards.) Frigga, upon  hearing this exclamation, which she had foreseen, immediately cried  out in triumph that Allfather had given them a new name, and was  in honour bound to follow the usual Northern custom and give also a  baptismal gift.          \"'A name thou hast given them,      Shames neither thee nor them,      Well can they wear it.      Give them the victory,      First have they greeted thee;      Give them the victory,      Yoke-fellow mine!'\"                The Longbeards' Saga (Charles Kingsley).      Odin, seeing he had been so cleverly outwitted, made no demur, and in  memory of the victory which his favour vouchsafed to them the Winilers  retained the name given by the king of the gods, who ever after watched  over them with special care, giving them many blessings, among others  a home in the sunny South, on the fruitful plains of Lombardy.        Fulla    Frigga had, as her own special attendants, a number of beautiful  maidens, among whom were Fulla (Volla), her sister, according to  some authorities, to whom she entrusted her jewel casket. Fulla  always presided over her mistress's toilet, was privileged to put  on her golden shoes, attended her everywhere, was her confidante,  and often advised her how best to help the mortals who implored  her aid. Fulla was very beautiful indeed, and had long golden hair,  which she wore flowing loose over her shoulders, restrained only by  a golden circlet or snood. As her hair was emblematic of the golden  grain, this circlet represented the binding of the sheaf. Fulla  was also known as Abundia, or Abundantia, in some parts of Germany,  where she was considered the symbol of the fulness of the earth.    Hlin, Frigga's second attendant, was the goddess of consolation,  sent out to kiss away the tears of mourners and pour balm into hearts  wrung by grief. She also listened with ever-open ears to the prayers  of mortals, carrying them to her mistress, and advising her at times  how best to answer them and give the desired relief.        Gna    Gna was Frigga's swift messenger. Mounted upon her fleet steed  Hofvarpnir (hoof-thrower), she would travel with marvellous rapidity  through fire and air, over land and sea, and was therefore considered  the personification of the refreshing breeze. Darting thus to and fro,  Gna saw all that was happening upon earth, and told her mistress  all she knew. On one occasion, as she was passing over Hunaland,  she saw King Rerir, a lineal descendant of Odin, sitting mournfully  by the shore, bewailing his childlessness. The queen of heaven,  who was also goddess of childbirth, upon hearing this took an apple  (the emblem of fruitfulness) from her private store, gave it to Gna,  and bade her carry it to the king. With the rapidity of the element  she personified, Gna darted away, and as she passed over Rerir's head,  she dropped her apple into his lap with a radiant smile.          \"'What flies up there, so quickly driving past?'      Her answer from the clouds, as rushing by:      'I fly not, nor do drive, but hurry fast,      Hoof-flinger swift through cloud and mist and sky.'\"                Asgard and the Gods (Wagner-Macdowall).      The king pondered for a moment upon the meaning of this sudden  apparition and gift, and then hurried home, his heart beating high  with hope, and gave the apple to his wife to eat. In due season,  to his intense joy, she bore him a son, Volsung, the great Northern  hero, who became so famous that he gave his name to all his race.        Lofn, Vjofn, and Syn    Besides the three above mentioned, Frigga had other attendants in her  train. There was the mild and gracious maiden Lofn (praise or love),  whose duty it was to remove all obstacles from the path of lovers.          \"My lily tall, from her saddle bearing,      I led then forth through the temple, faring      To th' altar-circle where, priests among,      Lofn's vows she took with unfalt'ring tongue.\"                Viking Tales of the North (R. B. Anderson).      Vjofn's duty was to incline obdurate hearts to love, to maintain peace  and concord among mankind, and to reconcile quarrelling husbands and  wives. Syn (truth) guarded the door of Frigga's palace, refusing to  open it to those who were not allowed to come in. When she had once  shut the door upon a would-be intruder no appeal would avail to change  her decision. She therefore presided over all tribunals and trials,  and whenever a thing was to be vetoed the usual formula was to declare  that Syn was against it.        Gefjon    Gefjon was also one of the maidens in Frigga's palace, and to her  were entrusted all those who died unwedded, whom she received and  made happy for ever.    According to some authorities, Gefjon did not remain a virgin herself,  but married one of the giants, by whom she had four sons. This same  tradition goes on to declare that Odin sent her before him to visit  Gylfi, King of Sweden, and to beg for some land which she might call  her own. The king, amused at her request, promised her as much land as  she could plough around in one day and night. Gefjon, nothing daunted,  changed her four sons into oxen, harnessed them to a plough, and began  to cut a furrow so wide and deep that the king and his courtiers were  amazed. But Gefjon continued her work without showing any signs of  fatigue, and when she had ploughed all around a large piece of land  forcibly wrenched it away, and made her oxen drag it down into the sea,  where she made it fast and called it Seeland.          \"Gefjon drew from Gylfi,      Rich in stored up treasure,      The land she joined to Denmark.      Four heads and eight eyes bearing,      While hot sweat trickled down them,      The oxen dragged the reft mass      That formed this winsome island.\"                Norse Mythology (R. B. Anderson).      As for the hollow she left behind her, it was quickly filled with water  and formed a lake, at first called Logrum (the sea), but now known  as Maelar, whose every indentation corresponds with the headlands of  Seeland. Gefjon then married Skiold, one of Odin's sons, and became  the ancestress of the royal Danish race of Skioldungs, dwelling in  the city of Hleidra or Lethra, which she founded, and which became  the principal place of sacrifice for the heathen Danes.        Eira, Vara, Voer and Snotra    Eira, also Frigga's attendant, was considered a most skilful  physician. She gathered simples all over the earth to cure both wounds  and diseases, and it was her province to teach the science to women,  who were the only ones to practise medicine among the ancient nations  of the North.          \"Gaping wounds are bound by Eyra.\"                Valhalla (J. C. Jones).      Vara heard all oaths and punished perjurers, while she rewarded those  who faithfully kept their word. Then there were also Voer (faith),  who knew all that was to occur throughout the world, and Snotra,  goddess of virtue, who had mastered all knowledge.    With such a galaxy of attendants it is little wonder that Frigga was  considered a powerful deity; but in spite of the prominent place she  occupied in Northern religion, she had no special temple nor shrine,  and was but little worshipped except in company with Odin.        Holda    While Frigga was not known by this name in Southern Germany, there  were other goddesses worshipped there, whose attributes were so exactly  like hers, that they were evidently the same, although they bore very  different names in the various provinces. Among them was the fair  goddess Holda (Hulda or Frau Holle), who graciously dispensed many  rich gifts. As she presided over the weather, the people were wont to  declare when the snowflakes fell that Frau Holle was shaking her bed,  and when it rained, that she was washing her clothes, often pointing  to the white clouds as her linen which she had put out to bleach. When  long grey strips of clouds drifted across the sky they said she was  weaving, for she was supposed to be also a very diligent weaver,  spinner, and housekeeper. It is said she gave flax to mankind and  taught them how to use it, and in the Tyrol the following story is  told about the way in which she bestowed this invaluable gift:        The Discovery of Flax    There was once a peasant who daily left his wife and children in the  valley to take his sheep up the mountain to pasture; and as he watched  his flock grazing on the mountain-side, he often had opportunity to  use his cross-bow and bring down a chamois, whose flesh would furnish  his larder with food for many a day.    While pursuing a fine animal one day he saw it disappear behind a  boulder, and when he came to the spot, he was amazed to see a doorway  in the"]]]
