It was the same with the  telegraph wires. At a certain point they stopped and were gone. The  poles, tottering and scorched and bare, looked like a procession of  naked ghosts, undressed for livelier mockery. Before him the trees, the  shrubs, the grain, the grasses--in fine, all vegetation had been smitten  unto death.    The face of the earth was black and crumbling. It looked as if the roots  of this unconscious vegetable life had been suddenly touched by volcanic  fires and had died from the ground up. There was not a vestige of life  as far as the eye could see. Had a fire swept the land? But no! No smoke  had been hitherto visible, unless this inexplicable cloud were smoke.  And yet, to Swift's practiced eye, there were evidences of a violent, a  sudden, a consuming heat. The men in line behind Swift stood  respectfully back while he observed this unique scene. He noticed a  white mile-post close at hand. It was inscribed, \"Russell, 20 m.\"    \"Only twenty miles to Russell! and no one there yet! What a field for  the news editor of the greatest paper in the land! The competitors were  keen. The chances were even, the honor great, and no favors asked. As he  stood for a moment, lost in thought over the apparent hopelessness of  the undertaking, and almost wishing he had not sent so confident a  telegram to his chief, he felt a hand upon his arm.    \"I have found one,\" said a slow voice.    \"Have you? What?\" asked Swift, with careless interest. He recognized the  aspirated tones of Mr. Ticks.    \"I have calculated this thing over. There are between six and seven  thousand on the spot. Five hundred reporters are here, and more expected  by every train. There is no food, no bed, no roof for us here. This  place has been completely done up. It is exhausted. To get facts we must  move on.\"    \"Jove, you're right, old man!\"    Mr. Ticks acknowledged the compliment with a slight motion of his hand.    \"Yes, I have just purchased the only team to be had, for four hundred  dollars.\"    Swift glanced enviously at his autumnal colleague, who had already  outdone him in enterprise.    \"Cyclones and tornadoes in this part of the country,\" proceeded Mr.  Ticks sententiously, \"travel to the northeast. We will go to the north.  If there are any remains they are to be found there,\" Mr. Ticks had, it  would seem, embraced the tornado theory.    \"We will go immediately!\" exclaimed Swift.    \"Hold!\" cried the man of figures quietly, \"I wish to test this  phenomenon. Wait for me here!\"    Before Swift could utter a protest or arrest his colleague's arm, the  philosopher started up the vacant track. No one dared to follow him. The  crowd were too much stunned at his audacity. Had they not dragged a  dozen adventurers back from the same mad enterprise? Men shuddered  before this unknown fate that stretched out its relentless arms so far  and no further. A cocked pistol would have been more comfortable.    But Mr. Ticks walked on slowly, unconsciously, as if in a revery. He put  his hands out as if to feel the air. He put his tongue out as if to  taste it. He had not gone forty feet when he was observed to tremble  violently. Those on the dead line united with Swift in shrieking \"Come  back!\" The experimenting member of the _Planet_ staff only shook his  head. He was not twenty yards away when he stopped abruptly. He put his  hands to his head and heart, and struggled against the unseen force. It  beat upon him: but he steadied his legs the firmer and met the shock. It  smote at him, but he wearily smiled in return. He even made a motion as  if for his notebook. But such temerity was too much for the occult  fluid to suffer. It breathed upon him and felled him to the ground. As  he dropped he rested for a moment spasmodically upon one knee, and  peered into the air as if he were penetrating the secret of this baleful  agent. Then he fell back insensible.    Half an hour afterwards the newspaper man came to. Swift was bending  over him.    \"We rushed you out. You'll pull through all right, old man,\" said his  colleague cheerily.    \"Did you note the symptoms?\" asked Mr. Ticks feebly.    \"Yes.\"    \"Did you wire them?\"    \"No; I hadn't time. I----\"    \"Then do so!\" He sank back exhausted.    \"But how did you feel? How _do_ you feel?\" asked Swift anxiously.    \"As mortal never felt before,\" replied Mr. Ticks solemnly. With these  words upon his lips he lapsed away again into unconsciousness.    That evening at a late hour Swift made his way to the  four-hundred-dollar team under whose protecting shelter he had ensconced  his patient with such poor comfort as was possible.    Mr. Ticks raised himself from the cushions upon one arm.    \"Are you ready?\" he said restlessly.    \"For what?\" asked Swift in astonishment.    \"To start.\"    \"Not to-night surely?\"    \"Yes--immediately. Harness up! We must be at the extreme north of this  unclassified belt by to-morrow morning.\"          IV.      Empiria, the new county seat of the new county Dominion of the new State  of Harrison, was twenty miles away to the northward as the crow flies,  and at least thirty miles off by road. The horse that Mr. Ticks had the  forethought to purchase developed an unaccountable spavin, united with  an unmistakable case of the heaves: when the whip was applied it  furthermore exhibited an innate tendency to back. Mr. Swift drove  through the darkness of the night, picking out the road with that genius  for locality which the general and the reporter in the field share  alike. Barring mistakes, accidents, or further exhibitions of depravity  on the part of the equine department, they hoped to reach Empiria by  dawn.    Mr. Ticks leaned back upon the jolting seat in unbroken silence. When  his colleague, who drove, hazarded a question, the only reply was a low  grunt. As sleep was out of the question in that wagon, behind that horse  and in those roads, was it pain or mighty thought or nebulous  calculation that oppressed the wise man of the _Planet_? At about two  o'clock in the morning Mr. Stalls Ticks broke his long reserve with the  following remark:    \"If it is, it is a unique case. The phenomenon is isolated.\"    \"I hope you feel better now?\" Swift had been anxious about his  colleague, and had interpreted his silence as evidence of physical  distress. Mr. Ticks gave an invisible shrug of his shoulders to express  the contempt he felt for his own anatomy in comparison with the  attainment of exact knowledge. Otherwise, heedless of the interruption,  he proceeded:    \"It is physically impossible that a low-pressured area could have had  its centre three or four hundred miles northwest of Russell.\"    \"Indeed?\" replied Swift, vaguely and unsympathetically.    \"It must travel towards the centre of the low pressure.\"    \"Of course,\" assented Swift, as he would to a lunatic. Evidently that  inexpressible shock had been too much for the middle-aged man.    \"The Gopher lake on the north, and the Buzzard mountain on the south,  prevent the isothermal curve from being deflected toward the north.\"    \"Really?\" said Swift.    \"It will be deflected to the south, young man,\" said Mr. Ticks,  severely. \"The atmospheric equilibrium can suffer no centripetal  disturbance.\"    \"Well, what then?\" asked Swift, a little bored.    \"There could be no gyrating motion of the atmosphere. There will be no  aerial contest. There could be no colder stratum above the warmer layer  coming from another direction. Both would flow from the south. There  could be no inversion of these conditions. My friend, Russell has  experienced no tornado or cyclone. And yet--\" he added wistfully and  thoughtfully, \"and yet--\"    \"Well, if there was no tornado, what the deuce are we going to  Empiria for?\" demanded Swift. He forgot himself, and gave the  four-hundred-dollar horse a sharp cut with the whip, in consequence of  which the animal backed them so nearly toward the place from which they  started that the journey to Empiria was seriously lengthened. Mr. Ticks  did not notice this delay.    \"--And yet?\" he mused.    \"What is the matter, then, if it isn't wind?\" asked Swift, impatiently,  after he had persuaded his horse to defer the next attack of backing for  a mile or so. \"Is there a new variety of atmospheric disturbance? If  so, it might strike us here!\"    \"Sir--no! This is not a common tornado. As to further theories, they are  not formulated as yet. No, this quadrant of the State of Harrison was  not subjected to such a violent disturbance. I am prepared to say that  there will be no evidences of a vortex wind in or near Empiria.\" Mr.  Ticks relapsed into further thought, nor could he be aroused until the  jaded horse brought the two jaded reporters into the open square of the  county seat.    It was early, about five o'clock, but still there were evidences of  stirring and excitement. Upon the village common two or three large  tents were erected, and from out of these, scantily dressed men and  woman emerged. As these came into the cool, open air they lifted up  their faces to the south, searching the horizon and sky to see if there  was anything new in the smitten district. It was a motion as instinctive  as that of the Mahomedan toward Mecca when he prays. The appearance of  our two strangers excited no notice. Empiria was on a branch road,  difficult of access, but people had flocked in and the village had  become a city.    After a hard struggle, in which persistent ingenuity won, Swift obtained  a little corn for his horse, and a promise of breakfast for himself and  companion.    By six the populace was awake, bustling with feverish eagerness and  oppressed with dread and suspense. Swift questioned a hundred, climbed  to the tops of trees, advanced upon the mysterious dead line, and  retired baffled at every step.    As he thought of that vast enclosure, that was now an unapproachable  cemetery, his soul shuddered"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33687"],[0,"Illustrative Anecdotes of the Animal Kingdom (#10)"],[1,"ary, he was astonished to see the animal roll his eyes  in a furious manner, and seeming as if he wished him to make as little  noise as possible, for fear of awaking the child, whom he clasped to  his breast. The bear, though ravenous, did not appear the least moved  with the food which was placed before him. The report of this  extraordinary circumstance was soon spread at court, and reached the  ears of Leopold, who, with part of his courtiers, was desirous of being  satisfied of the truth of Marco's generosity. Several of them passed  the night near his hut, and beheld, with astonishment, that the bear  never stirred as long as his guest showed an inclination to sleep. At  break of day, the child awoke, was very much ashamed to find himself  discovered, and, fearing that he would be punished for his temerity,  begged pardon. The bear, however, caressed him, and endeavored to  prevail on him to eat what had been brought to him the evening before,  which he did at the request of the spectators, who afterwards conducted  him to the prince. Having learned the whole history of this singular  alliance, and the time which it had continued, Leopold ordered care to  be taken of the little Savoyard, who, doubtless, would have soon made  his fortune, had he not died a short time after.    Munster relates the following story of a man being strangely relieved  from a perilous situation: A countryman in Muscovy, in seeking for  honey in the woods, mounted a stupendous tree, which was hollow in the  centre of its trunk; and, discovering that it contained a large  quantity of comb, descended into the hollow, where he stuck fast in the  honey, which had been accumulated there to a great depth; and every  effort on his part to extricate himself proved abortive. So remote was  this tree, that it was impossible his voice could be heard. After  remaining in this situation for two days, and allaying his hunger with  the honey, all hope of being extricated was abandoned, and he gave  himself up to despair. At last a bear, who, like himself, had come in  search of honey, mounted the tree, and descended the hollow cleft,  \"stern forward.\" The man was at first alarmed, but mustered courage to  seize the bear with all the firmness he could; upon which the animal  took fright, made a speedy retreat, and dragged the peasant after it.  When fairly out of the recess, he quitted his hold, and the bear made  the best of its way to the ground, and escaped.    It would appear that, in the remote regions of the United States, the  common black bear is occasionally found of a cinnamon color, and  sometimes even white. Tanner gives us the following account: \"Shortly  after this, I killed an old she-bear, which was perfectly white. She  had four cubs; one white, with red eyes and red nails, like herself;  one red, and two black. In size, and other respects, she was the same  as the common black bear; but she had nothing black about her but the  skin of her lips. The fur of this kind is very fine, but not so highly  valued by the traders as the red. The old one was very tame, and I shot  her without difficulty; two of the young ones I shot in the hole, and  two escaped into a tree.    \"I had but just shot them when there came along three men, attracted,  probably, by the sound of my gun. As these men were very hungry, I took  them home with me, fed them, and gave them each a piece of meat, to  carry home. Next day, I chased another bear into a low poplar-tree; but  my gun being a poor one, I could not shoot him.    \"A few days after, as I was hunting, I started, at the same moment, an  elk and three young bears; the latter ran into a tree. I shot at the  young bears, and two of them fell. As I thought one or both must only  be wounded, I sprang towards the root of the tree, but had scarcely  reached it when I saw the old she-bear coming in another direction. She  caught up the cub which had fallen near her, and, raising it with her  paws, while she stood on her hind feet, holding it as a woman holds a  child, she looked at it for a moment, smelled the ball-hole, which was  in its belly, and perceiving it was dead, dashed it down, and came  directly towards me, gnashing her teeth, and walking so erect that her  head stood as high as mine. All this was so sudden, that I scarce  reloaded my gun, having only time to raise it, and fire, as she came  within reach of the muzzle. I was now made to feel the necessity of a  lesson the Indians had taught me, and which I very rarely  neglected--that is, to think of nothing else before loading it again.\"    Some years ago, a boy, of New Hampshire, found a very young cub, near  Lake Winnipeg, and carried it home with him. It was fed and brought up  about the house of the boy's father, and became as tame as a dog.    Every day its youthful captor had to go to school at some distance,  and, by degrees, the bear became his daily companion. At first, the  other scholars were shy of the creature's acquaintance; but, ere long,  it became their regular playfellow, and they delighted in sharing with  it the little store of provisions which they brought, for their  sustenance, in small bags. After two years of civilization, however,  the bear wandered to the woods, and did not return. Search was made for  him, but in vain.    Four succeeding years passed away, and, in the interval, changes had  occurred in the school alluded to. An old dame had succeeded to the  ancient master, and a new generation of pupils had taken the place of  the former ones. One very cold, winter day, while the schoolmistress  was busy with her humble lessons, a boy chanced to leave the door half  way open, on his entrance, and, suddenly, a large bear walked in.    The consternation of the old lady, and her boys and girls, was  unspeakable. Both schoolmistress and pupils would fain have been  abroad; but the bear was in the path, and all that could be done was to  fly off, as far as possible, behind the tables and benches. But the  bear troubled nobody. He walked quietly up to the fireplace, and warmed  himself, exhibiting much satisfaction in his countenance during the  process.    He remained thus about a quarter of an hour, and then walked up to the  wall where the provender bags and baskets of the pupils were suspended.  Standing on his hind feet, he took hold of these successively, put his  paws into them, and made free with the bread, fruit, and other  eatables, therein contained. He next tried the schoolmistress's desk,  where some little provisions usually were; but finding it firmly shut,  he went up again to the fire, and, after a few minutes' stay before it,  he walked out by the way he came in.    As soon as the schoolmistress and her pupils had courage to move, the  alarm was given to the neighbors. Several young men immediately started  after the bear, and, as its track was perfectly visible upon the snow,  they soon came up with it, and killed it. Then it was that, by certain  marks upon its skin, some of the pursuers recognized, in the poor bear,  no enemy, but an old friend of their own recent school days. Great  regret was felt at the loss of the creature. It was like killing a  human friend rather than a wild animal.    Landor furnishes us with the following account: A man in Sweden set off  one morning to shoot the cock of the woods. This bird is so extremely  shy, that he may rarely be met with, except in the pairing season,  when, every morning, he renews his song. He usually commences just  before sunrise, beginning in a loud strain, which gradually sinks into  a low key, until he is quite entranced with his own melody; he then  droops his wings to the earth, and runs to the distance of several  feet, calling, _Cluck, cluck, cluck_! during which time, he is said to  be incapable of seeing, so wrapped up is he in his own contemplations,  and may be caught even with the hand by those who are near enough, as  the fit lasts only a few moments. If unready, wait for the next  occasion; for, should he advance a step, except when the bird is thus  insensible, he will certainly be overheard, and the victim escape.    The man I began to speak of, being, early one morning, in pursuit of  this bird, heard his song at a short distance, and, as soon as the  _clucking_ commenced, of course advanced as rapidly as he could, and  then remained motionless, till these particular notes were again  sounded. It was quite dusk, the sun not having yet risen; but the song  seemed to come from an open space in the forest, from which the sun was  just emerging. He could not see many yards before him, and only  followed the direction of the sound. It so happened that, from another  point, but at no great distance, a bear was advancing on the bird, just  in the manner of, and with the same steps as the man.    The hunter, whilst standing motionless, thought he perceived a dark  object on one side of him; but it did not much engage his attention; at  the usual note, he moved on toward the game, but was surprised to see  that the black object had also advanced in an equal degree, and now  stood on a line with him. Still he was so eager after the bird, that he  could think of nothing else, and approached close to his prey before he  perceived that a large bear stood within a few feet of him; in fact,  just as they were about to spring on the bird, they caught sight of one  another, and each thought proper to slink back. After having retreated  a short distance, the man began to think it would be rather inglorious  to yield the prize without a struggle; and there being now more light,  he returned to the spot, when it appeared that the bear had also taken  the same resolution, and was actually advancing over the same open  space I have mentioned, growling, and tearing up the grass with her  feet. Though the man had only shot in his gun, he fired without  hesitation, and immediately took to his heels and fled, conceiving the  bear to be close in his rear,"]]]
