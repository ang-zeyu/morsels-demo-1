Such distinctive characters are spoken of as _secondary sexual  characters_, in contradistinction to the _primary sexual characters_,  the reproductive organs. Our terminology would, perhaps, be more exact  if we were to regard the reproductive glands alone, the testicles and  the ovaries, as primary sexual characters; including the rest of the  genital organs among the secondary sexual characters. Havelock Ellis[11]  distinguishes, in addition to the primary and secondary sexual  characters (as commonly defined), _tertiary sexual characters_, by which  he denotes those differences between the sexes which do not attract our  attention when we compare individual members of the two sexes, but which  become noticeable when we compare the average male with the average  female type. Among such tertiary sexual characters may be mentioned the  comparatively flatter skull, the greater size and activity of the  thyroid gland, and the lesser corpuscular richness of the blood, in  women. Especially distinct are the secondary sexual characters in  respect of general bodily structure. The form of the skeleton is  different in the two sexes. Thus, in woman the pelvis is wider and  shallower than in man. In the hair also there are notable differences:  in woman the hair of the head tends to grow much longer, and woman is  much less liable than man to premature baldness; the beard, on the  other hand, is a masculine peculiarity. In woman the breasts attain a  much greater development. The larynx is in man more prominent and  longer; in woman it is wider and shallower. Woman's skin is more  delicate than man's. And so on.    Now what have we to say regarding these sexual differences in the case  of children? During the age which we have defined as the first period of  childhood, except in the matter of the genital organs, we can detect  hardly any important bodily characters distinguishing the sexes. Still,  even at this early age some differences have been recorded. Thus, the  average weight of new-born girls is less than that of new-born boys, the  figures given by Stratz[12] being, for boys, 3500 grams (7.7 lbs.); for  girls, 3250 grams (7.15 lbs.). According to a very large number of  measurements, the mean length of the new-born girl is somewhat less than  that of the new-born boy, the difference amounting to nearly 1 cm.  (2/5ths inch). Craniometric records, taken at the end of the first  period of childhood, exhibit differences between the sexes; in general,  the measurements show that the girl's head is smaller than the boy's in  respect both of length and breadth. Further, dynamometric records, taken  from children six years of age, have shown that the grasp in girls is  less powerful than in boys. But if we except such differences as these,  which relate rather to averages than to individuals, and which,  moreover, are for the most part demonstrable only during the latter part  of the first period of childhood, we find that, apart from the  reproductive organs, very little difference between the sexes can be  detected during the first years of life. Many investigators have been  unable to confirm the assertion that even in the first year of life the  hips are more powerfully developed in girls than in boys. Fehling,[13]  however, declares that as early as the fifth month of intra-uterine  life, sexual differences manifest themselves in the formation of the  pelvis. However this may be, it is beyond question that during the  earlier years of the first period of childhood the differences between  the sexes are comparatively trifling. But towards the end of this  period, sexual differentiation becomes more marked. According to Stratz,  it is at this time that the characteristic form of the lower half of the  body develops. The thighs and the hips of the young girl exhibit a  somewhat more marked deposit of fat than is seen in the boy of the same  age. To a lesser extent the same is true of the calves. It is often  assumed that even in very early childhood the sexes can be distinguished  by the formation of the face. The girl's face is said to be rounder and  fuller than the boy's; the expression of countenance in the former, to  be more bashful and modest. Stratz, however, urges in opposition to this  view, with justice, in my opinion, that we have here to do only with the  effects of individual educational influences, or perhaps with individual  variations, from which no general conclusions can safely be drawn.    During the second period of childhood sexual differences become much  more distinct. Before considering these differences, I must say a few  words regarding the growth of the child, since in this particular there  exists a notable distinction between the sexes. Careful measurements  have shown that during certain years of childhood growth occurs  especially in height, whereas in other years the main increase is in  girth. For this reason, it is customary to follow Bartels in his  subdivision of each of the two periods of childhood into two subperiods.  The age from one to four years is the _first period of growth in girth_;  from the beginning of the fifth to the completion of the seventh year is  the _first period of growth in height_; from the beginning of the eighth  to the completion of the tenth year is the _second period of growth in  girth_; and from the beginning of the eleventh to the completion of the  fourteenth year is the _second period of growth in height_. During these  periods there are certain differences in respect of growth between boys  and girls. Although in general the growth in height of the boy exceeds  that of the girl, there is a certain period during which the average  height of girls is greater than that of boys. From the beginning of the  eleventh year onwards, the girl grows in height so much more rapidly  than the boy, that from this age until the beginning of the fifteenth  year the average height of girls exceeds that of boys, although at all  other ages the reverse is the case. In our consideration of the  differences between the sexes, these differences in respect of growth  must not be overlooked.    In addition to these, other important differences between the sexes  manifest themselves during the second period of childhood. In the first  place, it is an established fact that in the girl the secondary sexual  characters make their appearance earlier than in the boy, the boy  remaining longer in the comparatively neutral condition of childhood. We  have seen that in the girl, at the end of the first period of childhood,  the lower half of the body begins to resemble that of the woman in type.  During the second period of childhood, this peculiarity becomes more  marked; the pelvis and the hips widen, the thighs and the buttocks  become more and more rounded; the enduring feminine characteristics in  these respects are acquired. More gradually, the feminine development of  the upper half of the body succeeds that of the lower; the transition  from the lower jaw to the neck become less abrupt, and the face becomes  fuller. The sexual difference in the growth of the hair also manifests  itself in childhood. Whether cut or uncut, the girl's hair tends to grow  longer than the boy's. Later, the typical development of the breasts  occurs. As early as the beginning of the second period of childhood, the  surface of the areola mammae may become slightly raised; but the typical  deposit of fat, leading to the hemispherical prominence of the breast,  does not begin until towards the close of the second period of  childhood. Even later than this is the growth of the axillary and pubic  hair. Various answers are given to the question as to the relation in  time between the appearance of menstruation and the development of the  sexual characters just described. Unquestionably there are great  differences in this respect. Whereas Axel Key declared that the  secondary sexual characters appeared before the first menstruation,  according to C. H. Stratz this is true only of girls belonging to the  lower classes; whilst according to his own observations on girls  belonging to the upper classes of society, the first menstruation  precedes the development of the breasts and the growth of the pubic and  axillary hair.    Concerning a number of sexual differences, during childhood, authors are  not agreed. As regards the type of breathing, for instance, in the adult  man, the abdominal type prevails; that is, the respiratory exchange of  gases is effected chiefly by movements of the diaphragm and the  abdominal muscles: whereas in the adult woman the respiration is costal,  the respiratory exchange being effected chiefly by movements of the  thorax. How unsettled our views are in respect of the types of  respiration in children is well displayed by the collection of opinions  given by Havelock Ellis.[14] According to Boerhaave, sexual differences  in the type of respiration were manifest even in very small children;  but his observations have not been confirmed by others. Thus, Sibson  states that the characteristic costal type of respiration begins in  girls at the age of ten, for which reason some observers have assumed  that the wearing of the corset is the cause of its appearance; others,  however, among whom Hutchinson may be mentioned, deny this alleged  causal connexion, stating that they have observed costal respiration in  young girls who have never worn any constricting garments.  Unquestionably, sexual differences in the type of respiration become  apparent in the later years of childhood.    I have already pointed out that in girls the secondary sexual characters  begin to make their appearance at an earlier age than in boys. In the  onset of sexual differentiation, the boy thus plays a more passive part  than the girl, inasmuch as he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28434"],[0,"The Astronomy of Milton's 'Paradise Lost' (#10)"],[1,"ter. A  close friendship soon existed between the two men, and they carried on  an active correspondence about matters relating to the science which  they both loved so well.    Crabtree, who was an unbeliever in Lansberg, urged Horrox to discard the  Flemish astronomer's works, and devote his talents to the study of Tycho  Brahe and Kepler. This advice led Horrox to make a more rigorous  examination of the Lansberg Tables, and after comparing them with the  observations made by Crabtree, which coincided with his own, he resolved  to renounce them. Acting on the advice of his friend, Horrox directed  his attention to the writings of Kepler. The youthful astronomer soon  realised their value, and was charmed with the accuracy of observation  and inductive reasoning displayed in the elucidation of those general  laws which constituted a new era in the history of astronomy.    The Rudolphine Tables, which were the astronomical calculations  commenced by Tycho Brahe, and completed by Kepler, were regarded by  Horrox as much superior to those of Lansberg; but it occurred to him  that they might be improved by changing some of the numbers, and yet  retaining the hypotheses. To this task he applied himself with much  earnestness and assiduity, and after close application and laborious  study he accomplished the arduous undertaking of bringing those tables  to a high state of perfection.    In his investigation of the Lunar theory, Horrox outstripped all his  predecessors, and Sir Isaac Newton distinctly affirms he was the first  to discover that the Moon's motion round the Earth is in the form of an  ellipse with the centre in the lower focus. Besides having made this  discovery, Horrox was able to explain the causes of the inequalities of  the Moon's motion, which render the exact computation of her elements so  difficult.    The Annual Equation, an irregularity discovered by Tycho Brahe, which is  produced by the increase and decrease of the Sun's disturbing force as  the Earth approaches or recedes from him in her orbit, had its value  first assigned by Horrox. This he calculated to be eleven minutes  sixteen seconds, which is within four seconds of what it has since been  proved to be by the most recent observations.    The Evection, an irregular motion of the Moon discovered by Ptolemy,  whereby her mean longitude is increased or diminished, was explained by  Horrox as depending upon the libratory motion of the apsides, and the  change which takes place in the eccentricity of the lunar orbit.    These discoveries were made by Horrox before he attained the age of  twenty years, and if his reputation had alone rested upon them his name  would have been honourably associated with those who have attained to  the highest eminence in astronomy.    Another achievement which adds lustre to Horrox's name consists in his  detection of the inequality in the mean motions of Jupiter and Saturn.    He also directed his attention to the study of cometary bodies, and  arrived at certain conclusions with regard to the nature of their  movements. At first, he believed like Kepler that comets were projected  in straight lines from the Sun; this supposition having been upheld on  account of the great elongation of their orbits. He next perceived that  their velocity increased as they approached the Sun, and decreased as  they receded from him. Afterwards he says, 'They move in an elliptic  figure or near it,' and finally he arrived at the conclusion that  'comets move in elliptical orbits, being carried round the Sun with a  velocity which is probably variable.' This theory has been verified by  numerous observations, and is now generally accepted by astronomers.    Horrox also made a series of observations on the tides. He notified the  extent of their rise and fall at different periods, and investigated  other phenomena associated with their ebb and flow. After having  continued his observations for some time, he wrote to his friend  Crabtree, and informed him that he had perceived many interesting  details which had not been previously described, and he hoped to be  able to arrive at some important conclusions with regard to their nature  and cause. Unfortunately, Horrox's writings on this subject, along with  many other important papers, have been lost or destroyed. We are  therefore ignorant of the result of his researches, which were the first  undertaken by any person for the purpose of scientific inquiry.    From his study of the Lansberg and Rudolphine Tables, Horrox arrived at  the conclusion that a transit of Venus would occur on November 24, 1639.  This transit was for some unaccountable reason overlooked by Kepler, who  predicted one in 1631, and the next not until 1761. The transit of 1631  was not visible in Europe.    We are indebted to Horrox for a description of the transit of 1639--the  first that was ever observed of which there is any record; and were it  not for the accuracy of his calculations, the occurrence of the  phenomenon would have been unperceived, and no history of the  conjunction would have been handed down to posterity. As soon as Horrox  had assured himself of the time when the transit would take place, he  wrote to Crabtree to inform him of the date, and asked him to make  observations with his telescope, and especially to examine the diameter  of the planet, which he thought had been over-estimated. He also  requested him to write to Dr. Foster of Cambridge, and inform him of the  expected event, as it was desirable that the transit should be observed  from several places in consequence of the possibility of failure, owing  to an overcast sky. His letter is dated October 26, 1639. He says: 'My  reason for now writing is to advise you of a remarkable conjunction of  the Sun and Venus on the 24th of November, when there will be a transit.  As such a thing has not happened for many years past, and will not occur  again in this century, I earnestly entreat you to watch attentively with  your telescope in order to observe it as well as you can.    'Notice particularly the diameter of Venus, which is stated by Kepler to  be seven minutes, and by Lansberg to be eleven, but which I believe to  be scarcely greater than one minute.'    In describing the method which he adopted for observing the transit,  Horrox writes as follows: 'Having attentively examined Venus with my  instrument, I described on a sheet of paper a circle, whose diameter was  nearly equal to six inches--the narrowness of the apartment not  permitting me conveniently to use a larger size. I divided the  circumference of this circle into 360 degrees in the usual manner, and  its diameter into thirty equal parts, which gives about as many minutes  as are equivalent to the Sun's apparent diameter. Each of these thirty  parts was again divided into four equal portions, making in all one  hundred and twenty; and these, if necessary, may be more minutely  subdivided. The rest I left to ocular computation, which, in such small  sections, is quite as certain as any mechanical division. Suppose,  then, each of these thirty parts to be divided into sixty seconds,  according to the practice of astronomers. When the time of the  observation approached, I retired to my apartment, and, having closed  the windows against the light, I directed my telescope--previously  adjusted to a focus--through the aperture towards the Sun, and received  his rays at right angles upon the paper already mentioned. The Sun's  image exactly filled the circle, and I watched carefully and unceasingly  for any dark body that might enter upon the disc of light.    'Although the corrected computation of Venus' motions which I had before  prepared, and on the accuracy of which I implicitly relied, forbade me  to expect anything before three o'clock in the afternoon of the 24th,  yet since, according to the calculations of most astronomers, the  conjunction should take place sooner--by some even on the 23rd--I was  unwilling to depend entirely on my own opinion, which was not  sufficiently confirmed, lest by too much self-confidence I might  endanger the observation. Anxiously intent, therefore, on the  undertaking through the greater part of the 23rd, and on the whole of  the 24th, I omitted no available opportunity of observing her ingress. I  watched carefully on the 24th from sunrise to nine o'clock, and from a  little before ten until noon, and at one in the afternoon, being called  away in the intervals by business of the highest importance, which for  these ornamental pursuits I could not with propriety neglect.[3] But  during all this time I saw nothing in the Sun except a small and common  spot, consisting as it were of three points at a distance from the  centre towards the left, which I noticed on the preceding and following  days. This evidently had nothing to do with Venus. About fifteen minutes  past three in the afternoon, when I was again at liberty to continue my  labours, the clouds, as if by divine interposition, were entirely  dispersed, and I was once more invited to the grateful task of repeating  my observations. I then beheld a most agreeable spectacle--the object of  my sanguine wishes; a spot of unusual magnitude and of a perfectly  circular shape, which had already fully entered upon the Sun's disc on  the left, so that the limbs of the Sun and Venus precisely coincided,  forming an angle of contact. Not doubting that this was really the  shadow of the planet, I immediately applied myself sedulously to observe  it.    'In the first place, with respect to the inclination, the line of the  diameter of the circle being perpendicular to the horizon, although its  plane was somewhat inclined on account of the Sun's altitude, I found  that the shadow of Venus at the aforesaid hour--namely, fifteen minutes  past three--had entered the Sun's disc about 62 deg. 30', certainly between  60 deg. and 65 deg., from the top towards the right.
