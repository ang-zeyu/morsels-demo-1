This species is indigenous to the pine-oak forests on the southern rim  of the Mexican Plateau, and has been collected at elevations from 1500  to 2500 meters. Males have been observed to call from rocks, rock  fences, clumps of grass, and low bushes; the call is a single \"peep.\" At  San Juan de Parangaricutiro numerous specimens were found in the daytime  beneath adobe bricks and lava on the volcanic ash derived from Volcan  Paricutin; at Paracho individuals were found by day beneath rocks in a  pine forest.    In most specimens the dorsum is dark reddish brown, and the prominent  inguinal glands are cream-color or pale orange (Pl. 3, Fig. 1). Of eight  individuals collected at Paracho, one was reddish brown, two were  pinkish tan, three were dark brown, and two were black.      ~Tomodactylus fuscus~ Davis and Dixon         _Tomodactylus fuscus_ Davis and Dixon, Herpetologica,       11:157, July 15, 1955.--1.5 miles southeast of Huitzilac,       Morelos, Mexico.         Los Cantiles (2); 28 km. E of Morelia.    The range of this species includes the Sierra Ajusco in Mexico and  Morelos and thence westward to the Serrania Ucareo in Michoacan. The  specimen from 28 kilometers east of Morelia was found in an oak forest  on a steep hillside at an elevation of 2100 meters. One from Los  Cantiles was calling from a steep cliff at an elevation of 2200 meters  in pine-oak forest. This specimen (UMMZ 119156) in life had a pale  olive-brown dorsum with irregular dark brown mottling and transverse  bars on the limbs. The interorbital bar, the upper arms, and the tips of  the dorsal pustules were pale orange; the iris was pale grayish gold  (Pl. 3, Fig. 2).      ~Tomodactylus nitidus nitidus~ (Peters)         _Liuperus nitidus_ Peters, Monats. Akad. Wiss. Berlin, p.       878, 1869.--Izucar de Matamoras, Puebla, Mexico.         _Tomodactylus amulae_ Guenther, Biologia Centrali-Americana,       Reptilia and Batrachia, p. 219, April, 1900.--Amula,       Guerrero, Mexico.         _Tomodactylus nitidus nitidus_, Dixon, Texas Jour. Sci.,       9:385, December, 1957.         Copuyo (15); Tuxpan (8); Tzitzio (11).    One specimen from Tzitzio (UMMZ 99155) was referred to _Tomodactylus  nitidus petersi_ by Dixon (1957:390). A re-examination of this specimen,  and examination of ten others from the same locality (UMMZ 121571)  reveals that the relatively small size of the tympanum and absence of  dense ventral spotting place these specimens closer to _T. nitidus  nitidus_ than to _T. nitidus petersi_.    The specimens from Tuxpan (UMMZ 114303-4) had in life a gray to olive  tan ground color with dark olive-green markings, bright yellow thighs  with olive-green transverse bands, yellowish tan shanks with olive-green  bars, yellow groin, white inguinal glands with black markings, grayish  white belly with scattered brownish black spots in some specimens, and a  deep golden iris (Pl. 4, Fig. 1). These specimens were found calling  from bushes in a rocky field at an elevation of 1800 meters. The call is  a high-pitched \"pee-ee-eep.\"      ~Tomodactylus nitidus orarius~ Dixon         _Tomodactylus nitidus orarius_ Dixon, Texas Jour. Sci.,       9:392, December, 1957.--4.5 miles southwest of Tecolapa,       Colima, Mexico.         La Placita (3); Pomaro.    These specimens, referred to _Tomodactylus petersi_ by Duellman  (1954b:5), were included in _T. nitidus orarius_ by Dixon (1957:392).  Color notes based on living individuals from Tecolapa, Colima (UMMZ  114312 and 116922), are: gray above mottled with brown; venter dirty  white; anterior and posterior surfaces of thighs bright yellow; iris  pale golden (Pl. 4, Fig. 2). The call is a soft \"braa\" usually followed  by three high notes: \"braaa-eep-ee-eep.\" In Michoacan this subspecies  has been found only in the coastal region and the lower foothills of the  Sierra de Coalcoman, an area in which it replaces _Tomodactylus nitidus  petersi_. This is the only _Tomodactylus_ known to inhabit coastal  lowlands.      ~Tomodactylus nitidus petersi~ Duellman         _Tomodactylus petersi_ Duellman, Occ. Pap. Mus. Zool. Univ.       Michigan, 560:5, October 22, 1954.--Coalcoman, Michoacan,       Mexico.         _Tomodactylus nitidus petersi_, Dixon, Texas Jour. Sci.,       9:390, December, 1957.         Aguililla; Apatzingan (8); Cascada Tzararacua: Charapendo       (5); Coalcoman (5); 18 km. E of Dos Aguas (6); El Sabino       (5); La Playa (2); Jiquilpan; Uruapan (2); Volcan Jorullo;       Zamora.    In life, specimens from Apatzingan (UMMZ 114308-9) varied in dorsal  color from grayish tan to pale brown; the dorsal markings were olive  green. The thighs and groin were yellowish orange; the iris was pale  golden, and the vocal sac was purplish gray (Pl. 5, Fig. 1).  Measurements for 13 adult males from the Tepalcatepec Valley are:  snout-vent length, 21.9-26.8 (24.3); tibia length, 8.4-9.9 (9.3); head  width, 7.2-9.2 (7.8); head length, 7.6-8.7 (8.2).    At Apatzingan and Charapendo in the Tepalcatepec Valley males were found  calling from rocks and bushes in open arid tropical scrub forest. The  call, a triple note \"peep-ee-eep,\" is repeated once every 90 to 135  seconds. _Tomodactylus nitidus petersi_ probably ranges throughout the  Tepalcatepec Valley and surrounding foothills. Dixon (1957:392) referred  the specimens from Zamora, Jiquilpan, and Uruapan to this subspecies.  Uruapan is near the lower limits of the pine forest on the slopes of the  Cordillera Volcanica; Zamora and Jiquilpan are on a low part of the  Mexican Plateau southeast of Lago de Chapala.      ~Tomodactylus rufescens~ Duellman and Dixon         _Tomodactylus rufescens_ Duellman and Dixon, Texas Jour.       Sci., 11:78, March, 1959.--Dos Aguas, Michoacan, Mexico.         Dos Aguas (14); 18 km. E of Dos Aguas (6).    Fourteen specimens from the pine-oak forests around Dos Aguas (UMMZ  118503-10, 121498-9) have reddish brown dorsal color and a narrow  cream-colored middorsal line (Pl. 5, Fig. 2). Twelve of these specimens  are adult males having snout-vent lengths of 20.7 to 24.6 (22.5) mm. One  female has a snout-vent length of 24.8 mm., and one juvenile has a  snout-vent length of 14.5 mm. Six specimens are from a region of mixture  of pine-oak forest and arid tropical scrub forest at 18 kilometers east  of Dos Aguas (UMMZ 121497, 121500). All are males having snout-vent  lengths of 18.0 to 22.6 (20.7) mm. The dorsum is tan marked with black;  the thighs are yellowish orange.    The specimens from 18 kilometers east of Dos Aguas were found on July  22, 1960, by Floyd L. Downs and John Winklemann, who collected calling  males of _Tomodactylus rufescens_ and _Tomodactylus nitidus petersi_ at  the same locality. Downs (_personal communication_) stated the call was  a single note. At Dos Aguas I heard _T. rufescens_ give two calls, one a  single \"peep,\" the other a triple note--\"pee-ee-eep.\"    In the higher parts of the Sierra de Coalcoman _Tomodactylus rufescens_  seems to fill the same niche as _T. angustidigitorum_ does in the  Cordillera Volcanica. At lower elevations in their respective mountain  ranges the species occur sympatrically with _T. nitidus petersi_.      ~Diaglena reticulata~ Taylor         _Diaglena reticulata_ Taylor, Univ. Kansas Sci. Bull.,       28:60, May 15, 1942.--Cerro Arenal, Oaxaca, Mexico.         Nueva Italia (3); Ostula (7).    Until recently frogs of the genus _Diaglena_ were known only from a few  specimens from southern Sinaloa (_Diaglena spatulata_) and from the  Pacific lowlands of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (_Diaglena reticulata_).  Peters (1955a) reported specimens from Ostula, Michoacan, and compared  these specimens with one _D. reticulata_ from Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, and  four _D. spatulata_ from Sinaloa. This comparison showed that the  specimens from Michoacan, although showing some minor differences from  _D. reticulata_, are closer to that species than to _D. spatulata_.  Subsequent to Peters' work, series of both species of _Diaglena_,  including additional specimens from Michoacan and from Colima, have been  collected, and a more qualified comparison is now possible.    In comparing specimens of _D. spatulata_ from southern Sinaloa (UMMZ  115322) with specimens of _D. reticulata_ from Tehuantepec, Oaxaca (UMMZ  115321), the differences noted by Taylor (1942c:60) were found to be  constant. But specimens from Ostula, Michoacan (UMMZ 104418), and five  individuals from Colima (TNHC 26379-83) were found to be intermediate in  certain characters. The skin of the dorsum in _D. reticulata_ is  granular; that in _D. spatulata_ is smooth. The skin in specimens from  Ostula and Colima is slightly granular. The dorsal ground color of _D.  reticulata_ is yellowish brown with dark reticulations; the dorsal  ground color of _D. spatulata_ is olive-green. Specimens from Ostula and  Colima most closely resemble those from Tehuantepec in coloration, but  the reticulations are more coarse, and the ground color has an  olive-green tint. _Diaglena reticulata_ also differs from _D.  spatulata_ in having a larger over-all size, slightly broader head, a  narrower interorbital distance, and a more pointed snout with a deeper  labial shelf (Table 4). The specimens from Ostula and Colima are  intermediate between _D. reticulata_ from Oaxaca and _D. spatulata_ from  Sinaloa in body proportions.    Of three specimens from the Tepalcatepec Valley (JRD 5991-3), only two  are suitable for measuring. These specimens are smaller than adults from  the coastal areas and have broader heads and snouts, but narrower  interorbital distances, than specimens in the other samples (Table 4).

I  consider we are quite safe in that respect, but Atherton might be doing  something if he found we did not come back.\"    \"He might do something, perhaps,\" Wilfrid said; \"but I am quite sure he  would not alarm my father and mother about it. He is the last sort of  fellow to do that.\"          CHAPTER IV.    A ROW ON SHORE.      While Wilfrid and the Allens were talking they were walking briskly in  the direction of their landing-place. They had arrived within a hundred  yards of it, when a party of four men who were lying among a pile of  timber got up and came across towards them. They were rough-looking  fellows, and James Allen said, \"I do not like the look of these chaps. I  think they mean mischief. Look out!\" As he spoke the men rushed at them.  James Allen gave a loud shout for help and then struck a blow at a man  who rushed at him. The fellow staggered backwards, and with a fierce  exclamation in Portuguese drew a knife. A moment later Allen received a  sharp stab on the shoulder, and was knocked to the ground. The other two  after a short struggle had also been overpowered and borne down, but in  their case the robbers had not used their knives.    They were feeling in their pockets when the step of a man approaching at  full speed was heard. One of the robbers was about to run off, when  another exclaimed: \"You coward! It is but one man, which means more  booty. Out with your knives and give him a taste of them as he comes  up!\" A moment later the man ran up. The leader stepped forward to meet  him, knife in hand; but as he struck his wrist was grasped, and a  tremendous blow was delivered in his face, hurling him stunned and  bleeding to the ground. With a bound the new-comer threw himself upon  two of the other men. Grasping them by their throats he shook them as if  they had been children, and then dashed their heads together with such  tremendous force that when he loosened his grasp both fell insensible on  the ground. The other robber took to his heels at the top of his speed.  All this had passed so quickly that the struggle was over before Wilfrid  and the Allens could get to their feet.    \"Not hurt, I hope?\" their rescuer asked anxiously.    \"Why, Mr. Atherton, is it you?\" Wilfrid exclaimed. \"You arrived at a  lucky moment indeed. No, I am not hurt that I know of, beyond a shake.\"    \"Nor I,\" Bob Allen said.    \"I have got a stab in my shoulder,\" James Allen answered. \"I don't know  that it is very deep, but I think it is bleeding a good deal, for I feel  very shaky. That fellow has got my watch,\" and he pointed to the man who  had been first knocked down.    \"Look in his hand, Wilfrid. He won't have had time to put it in his  pocket. If you have lost anything else look in the other fellows' hands  or on the ground close to them.\"    He lifted James Allen, who was now scarcely able to stand, carried him  to the wood pile, and seated him on a log with his back against another.  Then he took off his coat and waistcoat, and tore open his shirt. \"It is  nothing serious,\" he said. \"It is a nasty gash and is bleeding freely,  but I daresay we can stop that; I have bandaged up plenty of worse  wounds in my time.\" He drew the edge of the wound together, and tied his  handkerchief and that of Wilfrid tightly round it. \"That will do for the  present,\" he said. \"Now I will carry you down to the boat,\" and lifting  the young fellow up as though he were a feather he started with him.    \"Shall we do anything with these fellows, Mr. Atherton?\" Wilfrid asked.    \"No, leave them as they are; what they deserve is to be thrown into the  sea. I daresay their friend will come back to look after them  presently.\"    In a couple of minutes they arrived at the landing-place, where two men  were sitting in a boat.    \"But how did you come to be here, Mr. Atherton?\" Wilfrid asked when they  had taken their seats.    \"I came to look after you boys, Wilfrid. I got on board about eleven,  and on going down to the cabin found you had not returned, so I thought  I would smoke another cigar and wait up for you. At twelve o'clock the  last party returned, and as I thought you might have some difficulty in  getting on board after that, I got into the boat and rowed ashore, and  engaged the men to wait as long as I wanted them. I thought perhaps you  had missed your way, and did not feel uneasy about you, for there being  three of you together it was scarcely likely you had got into any bad  scrape. I was beginning at last to think you had perhaps gone to an  hotel for the night, and that it was no use waiting any longer, when I  heard your voices coming along the quays. The night is so quiet that I  heard your laugh some distance away, and recognized it. I then strolled  along to meet you, when I saw those four fellows come out into the  moonlight from a shadow in the wood. I guessed that they were up to  mischief, and started to run at once, and was within fifty yards of you  when I saw the scuffle and caught the glint of the moon on the blade of  a knife. Another five or six seconds I was up, and then there was an end  of it. Now we are close to the ship. Go up as quietly as you can, and do  not make a noise as you go into your cabins. It is no use alarming  people. I will carry Jim down.\"    \"I can walk now, I think, Mr. Atherton.\"    \"You might do, but you won't, my lad; for if you did you would probably  start your wound bleeding afresh. You two had best take your shoes off  directly you get on deck.\"    James Allen was carried down and laid on his berth. Mr. Atherton went  and roused the ship's doctor, and then lighted the lamp in the cabin.    \"What is all this about?\" the surgeon asked as he came in.    \"There has been a bit of a scrimmage on shore,\" Mr. Atherton replied;  \"and, as you see, Allen has got a deepish slash from the shoulder down  to the elbow. It has been bleeding very freely, and he is faint from  loss of blood; but I do not think it is serious at all.\"    \"No, it is a deep flesh wound,\" the doctor said, examining him; \"but  there is nothing to be in the slightest degree uneasy about. I will get  a bandage from my cabin, and some lint, and set it all right in five  minutes.\"    When the arm was bandaged, Mr. Atherton said: \"Now I must get you to do  a little plastering for me doctor.\"    \"What! are you wounded, Mr. Atherton?\" the others exclaimed in surprise.    \"Nothing to speak of, lads; but both those fellows made a slash at me as  I closed with them. I had but just finished their leader and could do no  more than strike wildly as I turned upon them.\" As he spoke he was  taking off his waistcoat and shirt.    \"By Jove, you have had a narrow escape!\" the doctor said; \"and how you  take it so coolly I cannot make out. Except as to the bleeding, they are  both far more serious than Allen's.\"    One of the wounds was in the left side, about three inches below the  arm. The man had evidently struck at the heart, but the quickness with  which Mr. Atherton had closed with him had disconcerted his aim; the  knife had struck rather far back, and glancing behind the ribs had cut a  deep gash under the shoulder-blade. The other wound had been given by a  downright blow at the right side, and had laid open the flesh from below  the breast down to the hip.    \"It is only a case for plaster,\" Mr. Atherton said. \"It is useful to  have a casing of fat sometimes. It is the same thing with a whale--you  have got to drive a harpoon in very deep to get at the vitals. You see  this wound in front has bled very little.\"    \"You have lost a good deal of blood from the other cut,\" the surgeon  said. \"I will draw the edges of the wounds together with a needle and  thread, and will then put some bandages on. You will have to keep quiet  for some days. Your wounds are much too serious to think of putting  plaster on at present.\"    \"I have had a good deal more serious wounds than these,\" Mr. Atherton  said cheerfully, \"and have had to ride seventy or eighty miles on the  following day. However I will promise you not to go ashore to-morrow;  and as the captain says he expects to be off the next morning, I shall  be able to submit myself to your orders without any great privation.\"    \"Why did you not say that you were wounded, Mr. Atherton?\" Wilfrid said  reproachfully as they went to their own cabin and prepared to turn in.    \"To tell you the truth, Wilfrid, I hardly thought the wounds were as  deep as they are. My blood was up, you see, and when that is the case  you are scarcely conscious of pain. I felt a sharp shooting sensation on  both sides as I grasped those fellows by the throat, and afterwards I  knew I was bleeding a bit at the back, for I felt the warmth of the  blood down in my shoe; but there was nothing to prevent my carrying  young Allen, and one person can carry a wounded man with much more ease  to him than two can do, unless of course they have got a stretcher.\"    The next morning there was quite a stir in the ship when it was known  that two of the passengers were wounded, and Mr. and Mrs. Renshaw were  greatly alarmed when they heard of the risk Wilfrid had run. Neither of  the wounded men appeared at breakfast, as the surgeon insisted that both  should lie quiet for at least one day. Mr. Renshaw had paid a visit to  Mr. Atherton directly he had heard from Wilfrid his story of the fray,  and thanked him most warmly for his intervention on behalf of his son.  \"Wilfrid said he has very little doubt that they all three would have  been stabbed if you had not come up.\"    \"I do not say they might not,\" Mr. Atherton said, \"because their  resistance had raised the men's anger; and in this country when a man is  angry he generally uses his knife. Besides, dead men raise no alarm.  Still they might have contented themselves with"]]]
