This is profoundly true, and for  every passion habit has killed it must certainly have created more  genuine affections.    The Spartan plan of allowing husband and wife to meet only by stealth  shows an acute understanding of human nature and has much to recommend  it, if the object in view is to prolong the period of passion. But we  are not now dealing with passion, but with the ordinary affection  between people who have to live together under the trying conditions of  modern marriage, and in these circumstances one must agree with Dumas as  to the wonders worked by habit.    Indeed, if people only realised it, habit is the cement which holds the  edifice of matrimony together. With the passing of years, given the  slightest basis of mutual harmony, one's partner becomes  indispensable--not by reason of her charms or the love we bear him, but  simply because she or he is a part of our lives. That is why I think the  policy of constant separation foolish. It is based presumably on the  erroneous supposition that absence makes the heart grow fonder. Where  the basis of mutual harmony does _not_ exist, it may be true; and if a  couple dislike each other and get on badly, a short separation may serve  to relieve the tension, and to send them back each resolved to try and  make things smoother in future. But where affection exists, it is a  mistake. One learns to do without the other; that linking chain of  little daily intimacies, oft-repeated jests, endearing customs, is  temporarily snapped, and it is not easily put together again. My friend  Miranda said to me not long ago: 'If Lysander's been away from me a day  I've heaps to talk about when he returns--if we've been parted a month,  I've nothing on earth to say.'    I think it is de la Rochfoucauld who says: 'Absence deepens great  passions and lessens little ones just as the wind puts out the candle  and heightens the fire.' This is fine from the literary point of view,  but is it true? My experience says No. Yet _during_ the absence this  aphorism seems true enough. Disillusion comes with reunion. Who does not  remember that first departure of the Beloved--the innumerable letters,  the endless meditation, the ceaseless yearning and the everlasting  planning for the glorious return? What a meeting that is going to be!  How one dwells in thought on that first goodly satisfaction of the  desire of the eyes; goodlier still that joyous clasping of the hands;  goodliest of all that glorious locking of the lips, that unending  embrace in the ecstasy of which all the wretched hours of absence are to  be forgotten--and, oh! laughter of the gods! how different it really  proves! What a hideous disappointment the meeting is! How different the  Beloved looks from our passionate dream; his hair wants cutting; we  don't like his boots; his tie is not of our choosing; his speech does  not please us; his kiss has no thrill; his remarks bore; his presence  irritates: in short, _we have learnt to do without him_, so nothing he  does seems right. Poor Beloved! and did you think the same of us? Are  you disappointed too? Did you say to yourself: 'How fagged she looks!  By Jove! she's getting a double chin. I thought pink used to suit her.  What's she done to her hair? Her voice seems sharper. Why does she laugh  like that? I don't like her teeth. Good heavens, the woman's hideous!'  In short, _he has learnt to do without us_. When husbands and wives  learn this lesson, the good ship 'Wedded Bliss' is getting into perilous  waters where danger of utter wreck looms large.    But it is equally fatal to go to the other extreme, and I entirely agree  with that authoress (who was she?) who said that no house could be  expected to go on properly unless the male members of the family are out  of it for at least six hours daily, Sundays excepted. The woman whose  husband's occupation, or lack of it, keeps him at home all day has my  profound sympathy. Merely to have to think out and order a man's lunch  as well as his breakfast and dinner must be a bitter trial. For this  reason among others women should never marry a man who does not work at  _something_. If he has no bread-winning business to remove him from his  wife's sphere of action for several hours daily, then he must have a  hobby, or a game mania, or engrossing duties which serve the same  purpose. Otherwise the wife must be constituted on a plane of inhuman  goodness and possess infinite love, tact, and patience if the two are to  live happily together.    The same principle applies to women, though it is not generally  recognised. I am convinced that a great number of middle-class marriages  prove unhappy merely because the woman has not enough to do. Possessed  of sufficient servants, her household duties occupy a very small portion  of her leisure, and if her children are at school (or perhaps she has  none) she has nothing more engrossing to do than read novels and pay  visits. The result is that one type of woman cultivates nerves and  becomes a neurasthenic semi-invalid; another cultivates the opposite sex  and fills her leisure hours with undesirable philandering; another  develops temper or melancholy or jealous fancies; and so on--all of them  spoilt as companions merely for want of sufficient occupation.            III      THE AGE TO MARRY      'To me the extraordinary thing is not that so many people remain    unmarried, but that so many rush into marriage, as they might rush    into a station to catch a train. And if you catch the wrong train,    what then? All you have to comfort you is the fact that you have    travelled.'  --ROBERT HICHENS.      A great many unhappy unions might be prevented if people could find  their right age for marrying. As it differs with the individual, it is  impossible to lay down any exact rule. Some men are capable of making a  good choice at twenty-two; others don't know their own minds at double  that age. Some girls are fit for wifehood and maternity in their teens;  others never.    In the interests of abstract morality early marriages are desirable,  and in England everything the law can do is done to encourage them. In  France the preservation of family authority is considered all-important,  and the law apparently tries to check early unions by every means in its  power, regardless of the high percentage of illegitimate births which is  the direct consequence.[3]        [Footnote 3: In 1903 one tenth of all the children born in France      were illegitimate. In Paris alone the percentage was higher      still--about one in every four.]    Broadly speaking, no woman should wed until she understands something of  life, has met a good many men, has acquired a certain knowledge of  physiology and eugenics and a clear understanding of what marriage  really means. No woman should marry until she has learnt the value of  money, and how to manage a household--until she has had plenty of  girlish fun and gaiety, and is thus ready for the more serious things of  life. Not until then is she likely to be happy in the monotony of  wedlock or capable of attuning her mind to the necessity of being  faithful to one man only, in thought as well as in deed. Broadly  speaking, also, no man is likely to marry happily until he has seen life  and plenty of it, has hammered out for himself something of a philosophy  and obtained considerable knowledge of women and a consequent  understanding of how to make one happy.    This is not so easily done as men suppose, and it takes time to learn.  Few men under thirty are fit to have the care of a wife, and Heaven  preserve a girl from a young husband who is still a cub! No doubt she  will have glorious moments, for there is something intoxicating about  the ardour of a very young heart, and that is why we find boy and girl  marriages so charming--in theory. Sometimes in the case of an  exceptional couple, well suited to each other, they really are charming,  and then it is the most beautiful marriage conceivable--two young  things, starting off hand in hand on life's journey, brave-hearted,  loving, full of high hopes. But as a rule the glory is limited to  moments only; young girls are mostly shallow and frivolous; very young  men are often madly selfish and reckless. They are so proud of being the  sole possessor of an attractive woman that their conceit, always  immense, swells into monstrous proportions and they grow wholly  unbearable. If dark days should come to the young couple, the  boy-husband has no philosophy to support him, no knowledge of women to  enable him to understand his wife and live happily with her, and little  self-control for his help; she has the same defects of youth, and the  result is failure. Stevenson puts it perfectly thus: 'You may safely go  to school with hope, but before you marry you should have learned the  mingled lesson of the world.' On the other hand, Grant Allen says that  'the best of men are, so to speak, born married,' and that it is only  the selfish, mean, and calculating man who waits till he can afford to  marry. 'That vile phrase scarcely veils hidden depths of depravity,' he  continues. 'The right sort of man doesn't argue with himself at all on  these matters. He doesn't say, with selfish coldness: \"I can't afford a  wife\"; or \"If I marry now I shall ruin my prospects.\" He feels and acts.  He mates like the birds, because he can't help himself.'    I must say that these young men who do not think, but merely feel and  act, scarcely seem of the highest type in my opinion, and if mating like  the birds were to be generally accepted as a sign of a noble  nature--well, nobility would be decidedly less rare than at present!

Drop on top of each portion one tablespoon whipped cream  delicately seasoned with salt, pepper and a few grains cayenne. Sprinkle  cream with paprika or finely chopped chives.      FRICASSEE OF CHICKEN    Dress, singe, clean and cut two young chickens in pieces for serving.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and dredge with flour, brown richly in  equal parts of Cottolene and butter, turning often that pieces may be  evenly browned. Then cover with boiling water to which add a bit of bay  leaf, one-half teaspoon peppercorns, a spray of parsley, six slices  carrot and three slices onion. Cover and simmer until chicken is tender  (from one to one and one-quarter hours). Remove chicken from stock,  cover and keep warm; strain stock; there should be two cups. Melt four  tablespoons butter in a sauce pan, add four tablespoons flour, stir to a  paste, then gradually pour on the two cups hot stock, stirring  constantly; let simmer ten minutes. Remove from range, add one cup of  hot cream and the yolks of two eggs slightly beaten. Reheat chicken in  sauce (do not allow sauce to boil after adding yolks). Serve with  Waffles.      SPINACH WITH DEVILED EGGS              1 peck spinach.            1/4 pound bacon.            Salt, pepper.            1/3 cup butter.            Few grains nutmeg.            5 hard-cooked eggs.            1/2 teaspoon salt.            1/4 teaspoon pepper.            1/2 teaspoon finely chopped parsley.            1/2 teaspoon grated onion.            1/2 cup minced ham.            Cream Salad Dressing.    PROCESS: Cook spinach in the usual way. Cook the bacon with spinach to  give it flavor. When spinach is tender, remove bacon, drain spinach and  chop fine. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Add butter, mix well and  pack into an oval mold. Keep hot over hot water, cut eggs in halves  lengthwise, remove yolks and rub through a sieve. Add ham, salt, pepper,  parsley and onion juice. Moisten with Cream Salad Dressing to bind  mixture together. Refill halves of eggs with this mixture, heaping it  pyramid-like. Turn mold of spinach on hot serving dish and surround with  stuffed eggs.      PRUNE AND NUT SALAD    Buy very select prunes for this purpose (tins holding one or two pounds  are best), cook prunes in the usual way, letting the liquor evaporate  during the latter part of cooking. Prunes should not be as well done as  when serving them as sauce. Drain prunes from the liquor and chill them.  Remove the stones carefully, cut prunes in five pieces lengthwise. Cut  pecan nut meats in four pieces lengthwise. Mix prunes and nut meats,  sprinkle with salt and paprika. For one-half pound prunes and one-fourth  pound shelled nut meats allow one cup whipping cream. Whip cream until  solid, season with one-half teaspoon each salt and paprika; add two  tablespoons lemon juice and one and one-half tablespoons Sherry wine  slowly, while beating constantly. Mix two-thirds of the cream with the  prunes and nuts. Arrange the heart leaves of lettuce on cold, individual  salad plates, pile some of the mixture in each and mask with remaining  whipped cream. Arrange three pieces of prunes on top of each portion,  radiating from center, and place a cherry or strawberry on top of each.      STEAMED SNOW BALLS    (For recipe, see page 168.)
