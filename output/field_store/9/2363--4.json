IRIS I am swift Iris.    PISTHETAERUS Paralus or Salaminia?(1)      f(1) The names of the two sacred galleys which carried Athenian  officials on State business.    IRIS What do you mean?    PISTHETAERUS Let a buzzard rush at her and seize her.(1)      f(1) A buzzard is named in order to raise a laugh, the Greek name also  meaning, etymologically, provided with three testicles, vigorous in  love.    IRIS Seize me! But what do all these insults mean?    PISTHETAERUS Woe to you!    IRIS 'Tis incomprehensible.    PISTHETAERUS By which gate did you pass through the wall, wretched  woman?    IRIS By which gate? Why, great gods, I don't know.    PISTHETAERUS You hear how she holds us in derision. Did you present  yourself to the officers in command of the jays? You don't answer. Have  you a permit, bearing the seal of the storks?    IRIS Am I awake?    PISTHETAERUS Did you get one?    IRIS Are you mad?    PISTHETAERUS No head-bird gave you a safe-conduct?    IRIS A safe-conduct to me, you poor fool!    PISTHETAERUS Ah! and so you slipped into this city on the sly and into  these realms of air-land that don't belong to you.    IRIS And what other roads can the gods travel?    PISTHETAERUS By Zeus! I know nothing about that, not I. But they won't  pass this way. And you still dare to complain! Why, if you were treated  according to your deserts, no Iris would ever have more justly suffered  death.    IRIS I am immortal.    PISTHETAERUS You would have died nevertheless.--Oh! 'twould be truly  intolerable! What! should the universe obey us and the gods alone  continue their insolence and not understand that they must submit to  the law of the strongest in their due turn? But tell me, where are you  flying to?    IRIS I? The messenger of Zeus to mankind, I am going to tell them to  sacrifice sheep and oxen on the altars and to fill their streets with  the rich smoke of burning fat.    PISTHETAERUS Of which gods are you speaking?    IRIS Of which? Why, of ourselves, the gods of heaven.    PISTHETAERUS You, gods?    IRIS Are there others then?    PISTHETAERUS Men now adore the birds as gods, and 'tis to them, by Zeus,  that they must offer sacrifices, and not to Zeus at all!    IRIS Oh! fool! fool! Rouse not the wrath of the gods, for 'tis terrible  indeed. Armed with the brand of Zeus, Justice would annihilate your  race; the lightning would strike you as it did Licymnius and consume  both your body and the porticos of your palace.(1)      f(1) Iris' reply is a parody of the tragic style.--'Lycimnius' is,  according to the scholiast, the title of a tragedy by Euripides, which  is about a ship that is struck by lightning.    PISTHETAERUS Here! that's enough tall talk. Just you listen and keep  quiet! Do you take me for a Lydian or a Phrygian(1) and think to  frighten me with your big words? Know, that if Zeus worries me again,  I shall go at the head of my eagles, who are armed with lightning, and  reduce his dwelling and that of Amphion to cinders.(2) I shall send more  than six hundred porphyrions clothed in leopards' skins(3) up to heaven  against him; and formerly a single Porphyrion gave him enough to do.  As for you, his messenger, if you annoy me, I shall begin by stretching  your legs asunder, and so conduct myself, Iris though you be, that  despite my age, you will be astonished. I will show you something that  will make you three times over.      f(1) i.e. for a poltroon, like the slaves, most of whom came to Athens  from these countries.    f(2) A parody of a passage in the lost tragedy of 'Niobe' of Aeschylus.    f(3) Because this bird has a spotted plumage.--Porphyrion is also the  name of one of the Titans who tried to storm heave.    IRIS May you perish, you wretch, you and your infamous words!    PISTHETAERUS Won't you be off quickly? Come, stretch your wings or look  out for squalls!    IRIS If my father does not punish you for your insults...    PISTHETAERUS Ha!... but just you be off elsewhere to roast younger folk  than us with your lightning.    CHORUS We forbid the gods, the sons of Zeus, to pass through our city  and the mortals to send them the smoke of their sacrifices by this road.    PISTHETAERUS 'Tis odd that the messenger we sent to the mortals has  never returned.    HERALD Oh! blessed Pisthetaerus, very wise, very illustrious, very  gracious, thrice happy, very... Come, prompt me, somebody, do.    PISTHETAERUS Get to your story!    HERALD All peoples are filled with admiration for your wisdom, and they  award you this golden crown.    PISTHETAERUS I accept it. But tell me, why do the people admire me?    HERALD Oh you, who have founded so illustrious a city in the air, you  know not in what esteem men hold you and how many there are who burn  with desire to dwell in it. Before your city was built, all men had a  mania for Sparta; long hair and fasting were held in honour, men went  dirty like Socrates and carried staves. Now all is changed. Firstly, as  soon as 'tis dawn, they all spring out of bed together to go and seek  their food, the same as you do; then they fly off towards the notices  and finally devour the decrees. The bird-madness is so clear, that many  actually bear the names of birds. There is a halting victualler, who  styles himself the partridge; Menippus calls himself the swallow;  Opuntius the one-eyed crow; Philocles the lark; Theogenes the fox-goose;  Lycurgus the ibis; Chaerephon the bat; Syracosius the magpie; Midias the  quail;(1) indeed he looks like a quail that has been hit hard over the  head. Out of love for the birds they repeat all the songs which concern  the swallow, the teal, the goose or the pigeon; in each verse you see  wings, or at all events a few feathers. This is what is happening down  there. Finally, there are more than ten thousand folk who are coming  here from earth to ask you for feathers and hooked claws; so, mind you  supply yourself with wings for the immigrants.      f(1) All these surnames bore some relation to the character or the build  of the individual to whom the poet applies them.--Chaerephon,  Socrates' disciple, was of white and ashen hue.--Opuntius was  one-eyed.--Syracosius was a braggart.--Midias had a passion for  quail-fights, and, besides, resembled that bird physically.    PISTHETAERUS Ah! by Zeus, 'tis not the time for idling. Go as quick as  possible and fill every hamper, every basket you can find with wings.  Manes(1) will bring them to me outside the walls, where I will welcome  those who present themselves.      f(1) Pisthetaerus' servant, already mentioned.    CHORUS This town will soon be inhabited by a crowd of men.    PISTHETAERUS If fortune favours us.    CHORUS Folk are more and more delighted with it.    PISTHETAERUS Come, hurry up and bring them along.    CHORUS Will not man find here everything that can please him--wisdom,  love, the divine Graces, the sweet face of gentle peace?    PISTHETAERUS Oh! you lazy servant! won't you hurry yourself?    CHORUS Let a basket of wings be brought speedily. Come, beat him as I  do, and put some life into him; he is as lazy as an ass.    PISTHETAERUS Aye, Manes is a great craven.    CHORUS Begin by putting this heap of wings in order; divide them in  three parts according to the birds from whom they came; the singing,  the prophetic(1) and the aquatic birds; then you must take care to  distribute them to the men according to their character.      f(1) From the inspection of which auguries were taken, e.g. the eagles,  the vultures, the crows.    PISTHETAERUS (TO MANES) Oh! by the kestrels! I can keep my hands off you  no longer; you are too slow and lazy altogether.    A PARRICIDE(1) Oh! might I but become an eagle, who soars in the skies!  Oh! might I fly above the azure waves of the barren sea!(2)      f(1) Or rather, a young man who contemplated parricide.    f(2) A parody of verses in Sophocles 'Oenomaus.'    PISTHETAERUS Ha! 'twould seem the news was true; I hear someone coming  who talks of wings.    PARRICIDE Nothing is more charming than to fly; I burn with desire to  live under the same laws as the birds; I am bird-mad and fly towards  you, for I want to live with you and to obey your laws.    PISTHETAERUS Which laws? The birds have many laws.    PARRICIDE All of them; but the one that pleases me most is, that among  the birds it is considered a fine thing to peck and strangle one's  father.    PISTHETAERUS Aye, by Zeus! according to us, he who dares to strike his  father, while still a chick, is a brave fellow.    PARRICIDE And therefore I want to dwell here, for I want to strangle my  father and inherit his wealth.    PISTHETAERUS But we have also an ancient law written in the code of the  storks, which runs thus, \"When the stork father has reared his young  and has taught them to fly, the young must in their turn support the  father.\"    PARRICIDE 'Tis hardly worth while coming all this distance to be  compelled to keep my father!    PISTHETAERUS No, no, young friend, since you have come to us with such  willingness, I am going to give you these black wings, as though you  were an orphan bird; furthermore, some good advice, that I received  myself in infancy. Don't strike your father, but take these wings in one  hand and these spurs in the other; imagine you have a cock's crest on  your head and go and mount guard and fight; live on your pay and respect  your father's life. You're a gallant fellow! Very well, then! Fly to  Thrace and fight.(1)      f(1) The Athenians were then besieging Amphipolis in the Thracian  Chalcidice.    PARRICIDE By Bacchus! 'Tis well spoken; I will follow your counsel.    PISTHETAERUS 'Tis acting wisely, by Zeus.    CINESIAS(1) \"On my light pinions I soar off to Olympus; in its  capricious flight my Muse flutters"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30181"],[0,"Fungi: Their Nature and Uses (#10)"],[1,"species are shorter, broader, and more ovate than  in the compact species. If a section of one of the more compact sori be  made, it will be seen that the majority of the spores are side by side,  nearly at the same level, their apices forming the external surface  of the sori, but it will not be unusual to observe smaller and  younger spores pushing up from the hymenial cells, between the  peduncles of the elder spores, leading to the inference that there is a  succession of spores produced in the same pulvinule. In _Podisoma_, a  rather anomalous genus, the septate spores are immersed in a  gelatinous stratum, and some authors have imagined that they have an  affinity with the Tremellini, but this affinity is more apparent than  real. The phenomena of germination, and their relations to _Roestelia_,  if substantiated, establish their claim to a position amongst the  _Pucciniaei_.[h] It seems to us that _Gymnosporangium_ does not differ  generically from _Podisoma_. In a recently-characterized species,  _Podisoma Ellisii_, the spores are bi-triseptate. This is, moreover,  peculiar from the great deficiency in the gelatinous element. In  another North American species, called _Gymnosporangium biseptatum_,  Ellis, which is distinctly gelatinous, there are similar biseptate  spores, but they are considerably broader and more obtuse. In other  described species they are uniseptate.    [Illustration: FIG. 22.--Pseudospores of _Puccinia_.]    USTILAGINEI.--These fungi are now usually treated as distinct from the  _Caeomacei_, to which they are closely related.[i] They are also  parasitic on growing plants, but the spores are usually black or  sooty, and never yellow or orange; on an average much smaller than in  the _Caeomacei_. In _Tilletia_, the spores are spherical and  reticulated, mixed with delicate threads, from whence they spring. In  the best known species, _Tilletia caries_, they constitute the \"bunt\"  of wheat. The peculiarities of germination will be alluded to  hereafter. In _Ustilago_, the minute sooty spores are developed either  on delicate threads or in compacted cells, arising first from a sort  of semi-gelatinous, grumous stroma. It is very difficult to detect any  threads associated with the spores. The species attack the flowers and  anthers of composite and polygonaceous plants, the leaves, culms, and  germen of grasses, &c., and are popularly known as \"smuts.\" In  _Urocystis_ and _Thecaphora_, the spores are united together into  sub-globose bodies, forming a kind of compound spore. In some species  of _Urocystis_, the union which subsists between them is comparatively  slight. In _Thecaphora_, on the contrary, the complex spore, or  agglomeration of spores, is compact, being at first apparently  enclosed in a delicate cyst. In _Tuburcinia_, the minute cells are  compacted into a hollow sphere, having lacunae communicating with the  interior, and often exhibiting the remains of a pedicel.    [Illustration: FIG. 23.--_Thecaphora hyalina._]    [Illustration: FIG. 24.--_AEcidium Berberidis._]    AECIDIACEI.--This group differs from the foregoing three groups  prominently in the presence of a cellular peridium, which encloses  the spores; hence some mycologists have not hesitated to propose  their association with the Gasteromycetes, although every other  feature in their structure seems to indicate a close affinity  with the _Caeomacei_. The pretty cups in the genus _AEcidium_ are  sometimes scattered and sometimes collected in clusters, either with  spermogonia in the centre or on the opposite surface. The cups  are usually white, composed of regularly arranged bordered cells  at length bursting at the apex, with the margins turned back and  split into radiating teeth. The spores are commonly of a bright  orange or golden yellow, sometimes white or brownish, and are  produced in chains, or moniliform strings, slightly attached to  each other,[j] and breaking off at the summit at the same time that  they continue to be produced at the base, so that for some time  there is a successive production of spores. The spermogonia are  not always readily detected, as they are much smaller than the  peridia, and sometimes precede them. The spermatia are expelled  from the lacerated and fringed apices, and are very minute and  colourless. In _Roestelia_ the peridia are large, growing in  company, and splitting longitudinally in many cases, or by a  lacerated mouth. In most instances, the spores are brownish, but  in a splendid species from North America (_Roestelia aurantiaca_,  Peck), recently characterized, they are of a bright orange. If  Oersted is correct in his observations, which await confirmation,  these species are all related to species of _Podisoma_ as a  secondary form of fruit.[k] In the _Roestelia_ of the pear-tree, as  well as in that of the mountain ash, the spermogonia will be found  either in separate tufts on discoloured spots, or associated with  the _Roestelia_, In _Peridermium_ there is very little structural  difference from _Roestelia_, and the species are all found on  coniferous trees. In _Endophyllum_, the peridia are immersed in the  succulent substance of the matrix; whilst in _Graphiola_, there is  a tougher and withal double peridium, the inner of which forms a  tuft of erect threads resembling a small brush.[l]    [Illustration: FIG. 25.--_Helminthosporium molle._]    HYPHOMYCETES.--The predominant feature in the structure of this order  has already been intimated to consist in the development of the  vegetative system under the form of simple or branched threads, on  which the fruit is generated. The common name of mould is applied to  them perhaps more generally than to other groups, although the term is  too vague, and has been too vaguely applied to be of much service in  giving an idea of the characteristics of this order. Leaving the  smaller groups, and confining ourselves to the _Dematiei_ and the  _Mucedines_, we shall obtain some notion of the prevalent structure.  In the former the threads are more or less carbonized, in the latter  nearly colourless. One of the largest genera in _Dematiei_ is  _Helminthosporium_. It appears on decaying herbaceous plants, and on  old wood, forming effused black velvety patches. The mycelium, of  coloured jointed threads, overlays and penetrates the matrix; from  this arise erect, rigid, and usually jointed threads, of a dark brown,  nearly black colour at the base, but paler towards the apex. In most  cases these threads have an externally cortical layer, which imparts  rigidity; usually from the apex, but sometimes laterally, the spores  are produced. Although sometimes colourless, these are most commonly  of some shade of brown, more or less elongated, and divided  transversely by few or many septa. In _Helminthosporium Smithii_, the  spores much exceed the dimensions of the threads;[m] in other species  they are smaller. In _Dendryphium_, the threads and spores are very  similar, except that the threads are branched at their apex, and the  spores are often produced one at the end of another in a short  chain.[n] In _Septosporium_ again, the threads and spores are similar,  but the spores are pedicellate, and attached at or near the base;  whilst in _Acrothecium_, with similar threads and spores, the latter  are clustered together at the apex of the threads. In _Triposporium_,  the threads are similar, but the spores are tri-radiate; and in  _Helicoma_, the spores are twisted spirally. Thus, we might pass  through all the genera to illustrate this chief feature of coloured,  septate, rather rigid, and mostly erect threads, bearing at some point  spores, which in most instances are elongated, coloured, and septate.    [Illustration: FIG. 26.--_Acrothecium simplex._]    [Illustration: FIG. 27.--_Peronospora Arenariae._]    MUCEDINES.--Here, on the other hand, the threads, if coloured at all,  are still delicate, more flexuous, with much thinner walls, and never  invested with an external cortical layer. One of the most important  and highly developed genera is _Peronospora_, the members of which are  parasitic upon and destructive of living vegetables. It is to this  genus that the mould of the too famous potato disease belongs.  Professor De Bary has done more than any other mycologist in the  investigation and elucidation of this genus; and his monograph is a  masterpiece in its way.[o] He was, however, preceded by Mr. Berkeley,  and more especially by Dr. Montagne, by many years in elucidation of  the structure of the flocci and conidia in a number of species.[p] In  this genus, there is a delicate mycelium, which penetrates the  intercellular passages of living plants, giving rise to erect branched  threads, which bear at the tips of their ultimate ramuli, sub-globose,  ovate, or elliptic spores, or, as De Bary terms them--conidia. Deeply  seated on the mycelium, within the substance of the foster plant,  other reproductive bodies, called oogonia, originate. These are  spherical, more or less warted and brownish, the contents of which  become differentiated into vivacious zoospores, capable, when  expelled, of moving in water by the aid of vibratile cilia. A similar  structure has already been indicated in _Cystopus_, otherwise it is  rare in fungi, if the _Saprolegniei_ be excluded. In _Botrytis_ and in  _Polyactis_, the flocci and spores are similar, but the branches of  the threads are shorter and more compact, and the septa are more  common and numerous; the oogonia also are absent. De Bary has selected  _Polyactis cinerea_, as it occurs on dead vine leaves, to illustrate  his views of the dualism which he believes himself to have discovered  in this species. \"It spreads its mycelium in the tissue which is  becoming brown,\" he writes, \"and this shows at first essentially the  same construction and growth as that of the mycelium filaments of  _Aspergillus_.\" On the mycelium soon appear, besides those which are"]]]
