[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36830"],[0,"The Badger: A Monograph (#10)"],[1,"  dog's smothered cries of anger and pain make you strain every nerve to  get to his relief.    When the badger at last leaves go, the terrier's turn comes, and now  with blood up he drives back the badger to his end of the hole with  every determination to keep him there. After two or three turns like  this, if the dog has been in an hour or two, he will probably come out  for a breath of air for a moment. He should be immediately taken,  fastened up, watered, and kept in reserve for future contingencies, and  the best terrier for sticking up be sent in with the utmost haste. If a  minute has been spent in doing this, every moment will have been used by  the badger in barricading the passage against the dog and burying  himself. This once accomplished, you may as well whistle for your badger  as continue digging, for he may have got down into some other gallery,  or have buried himself so that neither dog nor man can find him. Of one  thing you may be sure, that whilst you are speculating what has become  of him, he is digging at a prodigious rate, or has already made his  escape by some secret stair.    If, however, you are quick, terrier number two has interrupted master  badger as he is at work and lets you know. \"It's all right,\" \"Come on,\"  \"He's here,\" \"I've got him,\" \"He's got me,\" \"You beast,\" \"Get back,\"  \"I'll hold him,\" and spade and shovel and pick are hard at work again.  Backs and arms are aching with lifting at high pressure out of the deep  trench. You dig on, blocking the hole as the roof falls in, but every  now and then the shovels clear it for a moment to give the dog air. And  now the game has shown itself. A terrible charge down the hole sends out  the terrier; and the badger, seeing the men at work, backs again,  followed by the dog. Now all is excitement. Every snap, haunch, grunt,  groan, and yell in the fight is heard. A favourite's life in the  balance! The prize in view! The other terriers are tugging at their  chains, frantic to join the fray, yelling fit to split their throats. It  is maddening for them to see the dust and commotion in the trench, to  hear the sound of battle so near, to wind the enemy, to hear the cry of  their fighting and perhaps wounded companion, and not to be allowed to  share in the glory of the final action. Now is the time if you have a  terrier to enter to see what he is made of, but there is no time to  waste on education. You are close up to the badger, he cannot be an  arm's-length off. Draw your dog, the badger will then turn his tail to  you to dig, or he will charge out. Be ready with the tongs, and a good  dog in case he charges. But if he turns tail get hold of it with a good  grip. A long pull and a steady pull will draw him out, bouncing,  lunging, and snapping. Now, boys, ready with the sack! Dogs off. All  want steady nerves now; three hands on the sack mouth to keep it open,  and take care of your fingers! A twirl round and a quick plunge, and the  badger is in the bag. Don't let go his tail till you have slipped the  cord on his hind-leg, and made the other end of the cord fast to the bag  mouth and to a tree. I have seen a badger go through a sack like a  bullet through paper, and it is well to make all as safe as possible.    M. Edmond le Masson, in his book on hunting fox and badger, severely  deprecates tailing a badger. He denounces the danger and folly of it,  and gives an amusing account of his falling into a trench at the  critical moment as follows:--    \"One fine day, or rather one cursed day, when I was sweating blood and  water to get a monster badger out of his earth, a venerable patriarch,  white with years, who resisted my aching tired arms and weary back with  all his strength, the earth gave way and I fell back, rolling over with  the animal, and there I was at the bottom of the abyss in a veritable  pandemonium. Bruised and breathless, I was conscious enough to know that  I was in very bad company, with four more badgers, a furious mother and  three young ones, and not so young either but that one of them was able  to tear from me a large piece of the most indispensable part of my  attire, which placed me in a position of cruel embarrassment, and  obliged me to wait till the shades of night enabled me to get home with  decency. The most humiliating part of the adventure was that all these  cursed brutes, father, mother, and children, made the most insolent  retreat over my stomach to escape from their earth, and then took off  straight across country and escaped. From this moment I have felt a  ferocious malice against all badgers, whether big, middling, or little,  and I never go down into the trench now without having a Lefaucheux  revolver and a Devisme revolver, a long dagger knife, and a sharp Toledo  colichemarde!\"    But let not ingenuous youth think that to enjoy the sport all he has to  do is to take a spade and any reputable terrier. He might as well try,  like Dame Partington, to stop the rising tide with a mop! Before so  serious an enterprise as a badger digging be undertaken, the wise man  will see to it that all the materials are ready, and let him be sure  that he has the first necessity--the stout heart to go through with a  tough job when once started. I have, with my brother, Mr. J. A. Pease,  started at 7.30a.m. from home, worked a summer's day with a slight  refreshment at one, handled pick and shovel and spade, fought the  terriers, and gone on through the afternoon, evening, and a black wet  night, without even a drop of water to slake our parched throats,  deserted by all but one faithful workman, and on till the grey dawn of  another day, which found us as weary, wet, and wounded, and as  disreputable a looking company of three men and four terriers as ever  survived a bloody action. At five o'clock we secured a splendid pair of  badgers, which we bore home on aching backs, followed by our gallant  little team of draggled and dirty terriers. On another occasion, it took  my brother and myself, some ten labourers and keepers, and nine  terriers, from 10 till 5.30 to take an old 30-lb. dog badger, in an  earth which had only one hole, and where it was a case of following  straight into the hill. It is wonderful what can be done by twelve men  with pick, spade, and shovel in seven hours. On this occasion we dug a  trench ten feet long into the hill, and then the depth of bearing  necessitated our making a drift, or tunnel, which we drove in thirty  feet. The heat and want of air inside made the work difficult. Candles  would not burn after we had gone about twenty feet, and the tunnel was  so low that we had to work on our knees and then on our stomachs. There  was a considerable danger from the roof falling in, but the fight waged  so fiercely that we thought of little but what was ahead of us. When at  last we got within distance of the badger, he was in rocky ground, we  could mine no further, and being on a shelf round a corner no terrier  could draw him. As I was the smallest of the party, it fell to me to try  and reach him, and I crawled up as far as I could, holding a little  bull-terrier on whom I could rely for protection for my face, and a pair  of short badger tongs. I had indeed a bad quarter of an hour!    It was stifling, cramped, and pitch dark. I kept the terrier in front of  my head and gallantly he behaved, though every now and then the badger's  charge, or a fierce encounter, nearly smothered me with dust and soil,  against which I could not protect myself, as I was powerless to retreat,  there being only room to lie flat on the ground. The man behind me was  in the same position, tight hold of my ankles, and the man again behind  him, and the rest of the force made a human chain, which on a signal  from me was to be drawn out to daylight. Many attempts I made when the  badger charged to get him with the tongs, but I had so little room to  work my hands in that I missed him, and heard and felt the click and  snack of his teeth on the iron. At last I felt I had hold of something,  and I slipped the guard on the tongs, making the hold sure. I cried  \"Haul away,\" holding the terrier with one hand between me and the  badger, and the tongs in the other. I found that he came with wonderful  ease. It was not till we got to the light that I saw I had the huge  bouncing brute by one claw, \"Nip\" diverting his attention from my head  and hands. The labourers set up a shout, \"He's got him by the clee,\" and  a minute later we had the satisfaction of bagging him. But we were out  only just in time. I had gone back with the terriers to see if there  was nothing more in, and hardly had got outside again, when there was a  fall from the roof that would, if it had taken place earlier, have  buried some of us alive. As it was I looked round to see if we were all  there. The men were, but one little terrier, \"Pepper,\" a real treasure  belonging to a neighbour of mine in Cleveland, Mr. J. P. Petch, was  missing. We went in and found him buried, but got him out alive and  little the worse. This was the biggest badger my brother and I ever got.    But these operations are quite surpassed by those M. le Masson related  in the following authentic story.    \"An extraordinary _chasse_ that lasted without interruption three days  and three nights, took place lately in the neighbourhood of St. Omer, on  some land in the picturesque commune of Wisques, in a wood attached to  the chateau of Madame la douairiere Cauvet de Blanchonval.    \"One morning two young sportsmen of St. Omer, MM. Theobald Cauvet and  Charles d'Hallewyn, were told by the _garde forestier_ that on his beat  he knew of several badgers near the place they call l'Ermitage.    \"The little dogs being put on the scent soon found the earths, where  they entered, and advanced with so much courage that they never stopped  till they had reached the bottom of the earth, where they cornered the  badgers, which held their ground in an attitude of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36844"],[0,"In New England Fields and Woods (#10)"],[1,"and meditative pastime attends his brother of the gun  who, sweating under the burden of lightest apparel and equipment, beats  the swampy covers where beneath the sprawling alders and arching fronds  of fern the woodcock hides. Not a breath stirs the murky atmosphere of  these depths of shade, hotter than sunshine; not a branch nor leaf moves  but with his struggling passage, or marking with a wake of waving  undergrowth the course of his unseen dog.    Except this rustling of branches, sedges and ferns, the thin, continuous  piping of the swarming mosquitoes, the busy tapping and occasional harsh  call of a woodpecker, scarcely a sound invades the hot silence, till the  wake of the hidden dog ceases suddenly and the waving brakes sway with  quickening vibrations into stillness behind him. Then, his master draws  cautiously near, with gun at a ready and an unheeded mosquito drilling  his nose, the fern leaves burst apart with a sudden shiver, and a  woodcock, uttering that shrill unexplained twitter, upsprings in a halo  of rapid wing-beats and flashes out of sight among leaves and branches.  As quick, the heelplate strikes the alert gunner's shoulder, and, as if  in response to the shock, the short unechoed report jars the silence of  the woods. As if out of the cloud of sulphurous smoke, a shower of  leaves flutter down, with a quicker patter of dry twigs and shards of  bark, and among all these a brown clod drops lifeless and inert to  mother earth.    A woodcock is a woodcock, though but three-quarters grown; and the shot  one that only a quick eye and ready hand may accomplish; but would not  the achievement have been more worthy, the prize richer, the sport  keener in the gaudy leafage and bracing air of October, rather than in  this sweltering heat, befogged with clouds of pestering insects, when  every step is a toil, every moment a torture? Yet men deem it sport and  glory if they do not delight in its performance. The anxious note and  behavior of mother song-birds, whose poor little hearts are in as great  a flutter as their wings concerning their half-grown broods, hatched  coincidently with the woodcock, is proof enough to those who would heed  it, that this is not a proper season for shooting. But in some northerly  parts of our wide country it is woodcock now or never, for the birds  bred still further northward are rarely tempted by the cosiest copse or  half-sunned hillside of open woods to linger for more than a day or two,  as they fare southward, called to warmer days of rest and frostless  moonlit nights of feeding under kindlier skies.    While the nighthawk's monotonous cry and intermittent boom and the  indistinct voice of the whippoorwill ring out in the late twilight of  the July evenings, the alarmed, half-guttural chuckle of the grass  plover is heard, so early migrating in light marching order, thin in  flesh but strong of wing, a poor prize for the gunner whose ardor  outruns his humanity and better judgment. Lean or fat, a plover is a  plover, but would that he might tarry with us till the plump  grasshoppers of August and September had clothed his breast and ribs  with fatness.    Well, let him go, if so soon he will. So let the woodcock go, to offer  his best to more fortunate sportsmen. What does it profit us to kill  merely for the sake of killing, and have to show therefor but a beggarly  account of bones and feathers? Are there not grouse and quail and  woodcock waiting for us, and while we wait for them can we not content  ourselves with indolent angling by shaded streams in these melting days  of July rather than contribute the blaze and smoke of gunpowder to the  heat and murkiness of midsummer? If we must shed blood let us tap the  cool veins of the fishes, not the hot arteries of brooding mother birds  and their fledgelings.          XXII    CAMPING OUT      \"Camping out\" is becoming merely a name for moving out of one's  permanent habitation and dwelling for a few weeks in a well-built lodge,  smaller than one's home, but as comfortable and almost as convenient;  with tables, chairs and crockery, carpets and curtains, beds with sheets  and blankets on real bedsteads, a stove and its full outfit of cooking  utensils, wherefrom meals are served in the regular ways of  civilization. Living in nearly the same fashion of his ordinary life,  except that he wears a flannel shirt and a slouch hat, and fishes a  little and loafs more than is his ordinary custom, our \"camper\" imagines  that he is getting quite close to the primitive ways of hunters and  trappers; that he is living their life with nothing lacking but the  rough edges, which he has ingeniously smoothed away. He is mistaken. In  ridding himself of some of its discomforts, he has lost a great deal of  the best of real camp life; the spice of small adventure, and the woodsy  flavor that its half-hardships and makeshift appliances give it. If one  sleeps a little cold under his one blanket on his bed of evergreen  twigs, though he does not take cold, he realizes in some degree the  discomfort of Boone's bivouac when he cuddled beside his hounds to keep  from freezing--and feels slightly heroic. His slumbers are seasoned with  dreams of the wild woods, as the balsamic perfume of his couch steals  into his nostrils; his companions' snores invade his drowsy senses as  the growl of bears, and the thunderous whir of grouse bursting out of  untrodden thickets. When he awakes in the gray of early morning he finds  that the few hours of sleep have wrought a miracle of rest, and he feels  himself nearer to nature when he washes his face in the brook, than when  he rinses off his sleepiness in bowl or basin. The water of the spring  is colder and has a finer flavor when he drinks it from a birch bark  cup of his own making. Tea made in a frying-pan has an aroma never known  to such poor mortals as brew their tea in a teapot, and no mill ever  ground such coffee as that which is tied up in a rag and pounded with a  stone or hatchet-head. A sharpened stick for a fork gives a zest to the  bit of pork \"frizzled\" on as rude a spit and plattered on a clean chip  or a sheet of bark, and no fish was ever more toothsome than when  broiled on a gridiron improvised of green wands or roasted Indian  fashion in a cleft stick.    What can make amends for the loss of the camp-fire, with innumerable  pictures glowing and shifting in its heart, and conjuring strange shapes  out of the surrounding gloom, and suggesting unseen mysteries that the  circle of darkness holds behind its rim? How are the wells of  conversation to be thawed out by a black stove, so that tales of  hunters' and fishers' craft and adventure shall flow till the measure of  man's belief is overrun? How is the congenial spark of true  companionship to be kindled when people brood around a stove and light  their pipes with matches, and not with coals snatched out of the  camp-fire's edge, or with twigs that burn briefly with baffling flame?    But it will not be long before it will be impossible to get a taste of  real camping without taking long and expensive journeys, for every  available rod of lake shore and river bank is being taken up and made  populous with so-called camps, and the comfortable freedom and seclusion  of a real camp are made impossible there. One desiring that might better  pitch his tent in the back woodlot of a farm than in any such popular  resort. This misnamed camping out has become a fashion which seems  likely to last till the shores are as thronged as the towns, and the  woods are spoiled for the real campers, whom it is possible to imagine  seeking in the summers of the future a seclusion in the cities that the  forests and streams no longer can give them.    Yet, let it be understood that make-believe camping is better than no  camping. It cannot but bring people into more intimate relations with  nature than they would be if they stayed at home, and so to better  acquaintance with our common mother, who deals so impartially with all  her children.          XXIII    THE CAMP-FIRE      If \"the open fire furnishes the room,\" the camp-fire does more for the  camp. It is its life--a life that throbs out in every flare and flicker  to enliven the surroundings, whether they be the trees of the forest,  the expanse of prairie, shadowed only by clouds and night, or the barren  stretch of sandy shore. Out of the encompassing gloom of all these, the  camp-fire materializes figures as real to the eye as flesh and blood. It  peoples the verge of darkness with grotesque forms, that leap and crouch  and sway with the rise and fall and bending of the flame to the wind,  and that beckon the fancy out to grope in the mystery of night.    Then imagination soars with the updrift of smoke and the climbing galaxy  of fading sparks, to where the steadfast stars shine out of the  unvisited realm that only imagination can explore.    The camp-fire gives an expression to the human face that it bears in no  other light, a vague intentness, an absorption in nothing tangible; and  yet not a far-away look, for it is focused on the flame that now licks a  fresh morsel of wood, now laps the empty air; or it is fixed on the  shifting glow of embers, whose blushes flush or fade under their ashen  veil. It is not the gaze of one who looks past everything at nothing, or  at the stars or the mountains or the far-away sea-horizon; but it is  centred on and revealed only by the camp-fire. You wonder what the gazer  beholds--the past, the future, or something that is neither; and the  uncertain answer you can only get by your own questioning of the  flickering blaze.           *       *       *       *       *    As the outers gather around this cheerful centre their lips exhale  stories of adventure by field and flood, as naturally as the burning  fuel does smoke and sparks, and in that engendering warmth, no fish  caught or lost, no buck killed or missed, suffers shrinkage "]]]
