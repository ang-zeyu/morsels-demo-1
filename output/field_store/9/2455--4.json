Another recognized authority on ecclesiastical history, and one  whose avowed purpose was to present the truth respecting the Church in  its most favorable light, is Joseph Milner, author of a comprehensive  \"History of the Church of Christ.\" He comments on the state of the  Church at the close of the first century in this wise: \"Let us keep in  view what that [the spirit of the gospel] really is. The simple faith  of Christ as the only Savior of lost sinners, and the effectual  influences of the Holy Ghost in recovering souls altogether depraved  by sin--these are the leading ideas. When the effusion of the Holy  Ghost first took place, these things were taught with power; and no  sentiments which militated against them could be supported for a  moment. As, through the prevalence of human corruption and the crafts  of Satan, the love of truth was lessened, heresies and various abuses  of the gospel appeared; and in estimating them we may form some idea  of the declension of true religion toward the end of the [first]  century.\" The same writer continues: \"Yet a gloomy cloud hung over the  conclusion of the first century. The first impressions made by the  effusion of the Spirit are generally the strongest and the most  decisively distinct from the spirit of the world. But human depravity,  overborne for a time, arises afresh, particularly in the next  generation. Hence the disorders of schism and heresy. Their tendency  is to destroy the pure work of God.\"--(Milner, \"Church History,\" Cent.  I, ch. 15.)    21. The purpose of this chapter has been that of demonstrating the  early beginning of the apostasy, so soon to become general, and later,  universal. The specific causes directly contributing to the  degradation of the Church are reserved for future consideration.    **The Growth of Apostasy on the Western Hemisphere**.    22. Now let us see what was the condition of the Church established by  the Resurrected Lord among the descendants of Lehi on the American  Continent. In this undertaking we shall not restrict ourselves to the  beginning of the disruption alone. Inasmuch as the course of apostasy  among the Nephites was so rapid, and the period intervening between  the establishment of the Church and the destruction of the nation was  so brief, we shall consider the history of the Church to its close,  and thus obviate the necessity of recurring to the subject in later  chapters. We read that the Church had prospered until about 200 A. D.  Then apostasy became general, as evidence of which note the following:    23. \"And now in this two hundred and first year, there began to be  among them those who were lifted up in pride. * * * And they began to  be divided into classes, and they began to build up churches unto  themselves, to get gain, and began to deny the true Church of Christ.  And it came to pass that when two hundred and ten years had passed  away there were many churches in the land; yea, there were many  churches which professed to know the Christ, and yet they did deny the  more parts of his gospel, insomuch that they did receive all manner of  wickedness, and did administer that which was sacred unto him to whom  it had been forbidden, because of unworthiness. And this church did  multiply exceedingly, because of iniquity, and because of the power of  Satan, who did get hold upon their hearts. And again, there was  another church which denied the Christ; and they did persecute the  true Church of Christ because of their humility, and their belief in  Christ; and they did despise them because of the many miracles which  were wrought among them.\"--(IV Nephi 1:24-29; read the entire  chapter.)    24. The Book of Mormon record is definite in its specifications of the  immediate reasons for, or causes of the great apostasy on the western  hemisphere. While the members of the Church remained faithful to their  covenants and obligations, they as individuals and the Church as an  organization prospered; and their enemies were unable to prevail  against them. With prosperity, however, came pride and class  distinctions, the rich dominated the poor, and earthly gain became the  object of life.--(See IV Nephi 1:2-7 and compare with verses 25, 26.)  Secret organizations of evil purpose flourished,--(Verse 42.) the  people were divided into two opposing factions, those who still  professed a belief in Christ being known as Nephites and their enemies  as Lamanites, without regard to actual descent or family relationship.  With the growth of pride and its attendant sins, the Nephites became  as wicked as the non-professing Lamanites;--(Verse 45.) and in their  wickedness these people sought each other's destruction. Consider the  pathos and dire tragedy expressed in the words of Moroni, the solitary  survivor of a once blessed and mighty nation:    25. \"Behold, four hundred years have passed away since the coming of  our Lord and Savior. And behold, the Lamanites have hunted my people,  the Nephites, down from city to city, and from place to place, even  until they are no more; and great has been their fall; yea, great and  marvelous is the destruction of my people, the Nephites. And behold,  it is the hand of the Lord which hath done it. And behold also, the  Lamanites are at war one with another; and the whole face of this land  is one continual round of murder and bloodshed; and no one knoweth the  end of the war. And now behold, I say no more concerning them, for  there are none, save it be the Lamanites and robbers that do exist  upon the face of the land; and there are none that do know the true  God, save it be the disciples of Jesus,--(See III Nephi 28:1-7.) who  did tarry in the land until the wickedness of the people was so great,  that the Lord would not suffer them to remain with the people; and  whether they be upon the face of the land no man knoweth.\"--(Mormon  8:6-10.)      NOTES.    1. _The Early Apostasy Recognized_. The fact of the early beginning of  the apostasy is generally recognized by theologians and authorities on  biblical interpretation. Clarke's commentary on the declaration of  Paul as to the \"mystery of iniquity\" then at work (See II Thess. 2:7)  is as follows:    \"_For the mystery of iniquity doth already work_: There is a system of  corrupt doctrine which will lead to the _general apostasy, already in  existence; but it is a mystery_; it is as yet hidden; it dare not show  itself because of that which hindereth or withholdeth. But when that  which now restraineth is taken out of the way, then shall that wicked  one be revealed; it will then be manifest who he is and what he is.\"    2. _Early Dissensions in the Church_. As instances of the  disagreements and differences that troubled and disturbed the Church  even in apostolic days Mosheim says: \"The first of these  controversies, which was set on foot in the church of Antioch,  regarded the necessity of observing the law of Moses, and its issue is  mentioned by St. Luke in the Acts of the Apostles (chap. 15). This  controversy was followed by many others, either with the Jews who were  violently attached to the worship of their ancestors, or with the  votaries of a wild and fanatical sort of philosophy, or with such as,  mistaking the true genius of the Christian religion, abused it  monstrously to the encouragement of their vices, and their indulgence  of the appetites and passions. St. Paul and the other apostles have in  several places of their writings, mentioned these controversies, but  with such brevity that it is difficult at this distance of time to  come at the true state of the question in these various disputes. The  most weighty and important of all these controversies was that which  certain Jewish doctors raised at Rome, and in other Christian Churches  concerning the means of justification and acceptance with God, and the  method of salvation pointed out in the word of God. The apostles,  wherever they exercised their ministry, had constantly declared all  hopes of acceptance and salvation delusive, except such as were  founded on Jesus the Redeemer, and His all-sufficient merits; while  the Jewish doctors maintained the works of the law to be the true  efficient cause of the soul's eternal salvation and felicity. This  latter sentiment not only led to many other errors extremely  prejudicial to Christianity, but was also injurious to the glory of  the divine Savior.\"--(Mosheim, \"Ecclesiastical History,\" Cent. I, Part  II, 11-12.)    3. _Unauthorized Writings in the Apostolic Age_. Paul's reference to  \"another gospel\" in his epistle to the Galatians (1:6) suggested to  Dr. Adam Clarke the following commentary on the passage:    \"_Another gospel_: It is certain that in the very earliest ages of the  Christian Church, there were several spurious gospels in circulation;  and it was the multitude of these false or inaccurate relations that  induced St. Luke to write his own (see Luke 1:1). We have the names of  more than seventy of these spurious narratives still on record, and in  ancient writers many fragments of them remain; these have been  collected and published by Fabricius in his account of the apocryphal  books of the New Testament (3 vols, 8 vo.) In some of these gospels  the necessity of circumcision and subjection to the Mosaic law, in  unity with the gospel, were strongly inculcated.\"--(Clarke, \"Bible  Commentary.\")    4. _Some Authorities on Ecclesiastical History_. Among the authorities  cited in the text are those named below. A brief note as to each may  be of interest.    _Eusebius_: Eusebius Pamphilus, bishop of Caesarea in Palestine. He  lived from about 260 to about 339 A.D., though there is some  uncertainty as to the exact time of his death. He was an eye witness  of and a participant in some of the sufferings incident to heathen  persecution of the Christians, and has been called the \"Father of  Church History.\" He was the author of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35534"],[0,"How to be Happy Though Married: Being a Handbook to Marriage (#10)"],[1,"and real  desires in hypocritical imitation, studied compliance, and continued  affectation. From the time that their love is avowed, neither sees the  other but in a mask; and the cheat is often managed on both sides with  so much art, and discovered afterwards with so much abruptness, that  each has reason to suspect that some transformation has happened on the  wedding-night, and that by a strange imposture, as in the case of Jacob,  one has been courted and another married.\"    Our conventional state of society curtails the limits of choice in  matrimony and hinders the natural law of the marriage of the fittest. We  knew a young gentleman living in a London suburb who bore an excellent  character, had sufficient income, and was in every respect marriageable.  He wished to try the experiment of two against the world, but--as he  told the clergyman of his parish--he was in the city all day, and never  had an opportunity of becoming acquainted with a young lady whom he  could ask to be his wife.    We have heard of the stiff Englishman who would not attempt to save a  fellow-creature from drowning because he had never been introduced to  him. In the same way unmarried ladies are allowed to remain in the  Slough of Despond because the valiant young gentlemen who would rescue  them, though they may be almost, are not altogether in their social set.    Every one knows Plato's theory about marriage. He taught that men and  women were hemispheres, so to speak, of an original sphere; that  ill-assorted marriages were the result of the wrong hemispheres getting  together; that, if the true halves met, the man became complete, and the  consequence was the \"happy-ever-after\" of childhood's stories. There is  much truth in this doctrine, that for every man there is _one_ woman  somewhere in the world, and for every woman _one_ man. They seldom meet  in time. If they did, what would become of the sensational novelists?    But are there not in reality too many artificial obstacles to happy  marriages? Why do the right men and women so seldom meet? Because  mammon, ambition, envy, hatred, and all uncharitableness step between  and keep apart those whom God would join together.    It is true that newly-married people when going through the process of  being disillusioned are liable to conclude much too quickly that they  have got bad matrimonial bargains. In a letter which Mrs. Thrale, the  friend of Dr. Johnson, wrote to a young gentleman on his marriage, she  says: \"When your present violence of passion subsides, and a more cool  and tranquil affection takes its place, be not hasty to censure  yourself as indifferent, or to lament yourself as unhappy. You have lost  that only which it was impossible to retain; and it were graceless amid  the pleasures of a prosperous summer to regret the blossoms of a  transient spring. Neither unwarily condemn your bride's insipidity, till  you have reflected that no object however sublime, no sounds however  charming, can continue to transport us with delight, when they no longer  strike us with novelty.\"    Satiety follows quickly upon the heels of possession. A little boy of  four years of age told me the other day that he wished to die. \"Why?\"  \"Oh, just for a change!\" There are children of a larger growth who  require continual change and variety to keep them interested.    We expect too much from life in general, and from married life in  particular. When castle-building before marriage we imagine a condition  never experienced on this side of heaven; and when real life comes with  its troubles and cares, the tower of romance falls with a crash, leaving  us in the mud-hut of every-day reality. Better to enter the marriage  state in the frame of mind of that company of American settlers, who, in  naming their new town, called it Dictionary, \"because,\" as they said,  \"that's the only place where peace, prosperity, and happiness are always  to be found.\"    It would be contrary to the nature of constitutional grumblers to be  satisfied with their matrimonial bargains, no matter how much too good  for them they may be. They don't want to be satisfied in this or in any  other respect, for, as the Irishman said, they are never happy unless  they are miserable. They may have drawn a prize in the matrimonial  lottery, but they grumble if it be not the highest prize. They are  cursed with dispositions like that of the Jew, who, very early one  morning, picked up a roll of bank-notes on Newmarket Heath, which had  been dropped by some inebriated betting-man the night before. \"What have  you got there?\" exclaimed a fellow Israelite. \"Lucky as usual!\" \"Lucky  you call it?\" grumbled the man in reply, rapidly turning over the notes.  \"Lucky is it! all fivers--not a tenner among them!\"    Even a perfect matrimonial bargain would not please some people. They  are as prone to grumble as the poor woman who, being asked if she were  satisfied when a pure water supply had been introduced into Edinburgh,  said: \"Aye, not so well as I might; it's not like the water we had  before--it neither smells nor tastes.\"    There is a story told of a rustic swain who, when asked whether he would  take his partner to be his wedded wife, replied, with shameful  indecision, \"Yes, I'm willin'; but I'd a much sight rather have her  sister.\" The sort of people who are represented by this vacillating  bridegroom are no sooner married than they begin to cast fond, lingering  looks behind upon the state of single blessedness they have abandoned,  or else upon some lost ideal which they prefer to the living, breathing  reality of which they have become possessed. They don't know, and never  did know, their own minds.    Let us suppose, however, that a bad matrimonial bargain has been  obtained, not in imagination, but in sad earnest--How is the best to be  made of it? We must do as Old Mother Hubbard did when she found the  cupboard empty--\"accept the inevitable with calm steadfastness.\" It may  even be politic to dissemble a little, and pretend we rather enjoy it  than otherwise. Above all, do not appeal to the girl's friends for  comfort or consolation. They will only laugh at you. Take warning from  the unfortunate young man who, every time he met the father of his wife,  complained to him of the bad temper and disposition of his daughter. At  last, upon one occasion, the old gentleman, becoming weary of the  grumbling of his son-in-law, exclaimed: \"You are right, sir; she is an  impertinent jade; and if I hear any more complaints of her I will  disinherit her.\"    A writer in _Chambers' Journal_ gives some instances of matrimonial  tribulation that were brought to light in the last census returns.  Several husbands returned their wives as the heads of the families; and  one described himself as an idiot for having married his literal  better-half. \"Married, and I'm heartily sorry for it,\" was returned in  two cases; and in quite a number of instances \"Temper\" was entered under  the head of infirmities opposite the name of the wife.    Confessions of this sort, besides being, as we have already hinted,  somewhat indiscreet, are often also supererogatory; for conjugal  dissension, like murder, will out; and that sometimes in the most  provoking and untimely manner. It would be much better to call in the  assistance of proper pride than to whine in this cowardly fashion. \"We  mortals,\" says George Eliot, \"men and women, devour many a  disappointment between breakfast and dinner time; keep back the tears  and look a little pale about the lips, and in answer to inquiries say,  'Oh, nothing!' Pride helps us; and pride is not a bad thing when it only  urges us to hide our own hurts--not to hurt others.\" \"To feel the  chains, but take especial care the world shall not hear them clank. 'Tis  a prudence that often passes for happiness. It is one of the decencies  of matrimony.\"    \"Biddy,\" said Dean Swift one day to his cook, \"this leg of mutton is  over-done; take it down and do it less.\" \"Plaze, your Riverence,\"  replied Biddy, \"the thing is impossible.\" \"Well, then,\" rejoined her  master, \"let this be a lesson to you, that if you must commit mistakes  they, at all events, shall not be of such gravity as to preclude  correction.\" Well would it be if people never made mistakes that  preclude correction in reference to more important matters! Yet, for all  this, it is a good thing that we have no \"fatal facility\" of divorce in  this country, and that a marriage once made is generally regarded as a  world-without-end bargain.    A story has been told of a graceless scamp who gained access to the  Clarendon printing-office in Oxford, when a new edition of the  Prayer-book was ready for the press. In that part of the \"forme\" already  set up which contained the marriage service, he substituted the letter  _k_ for the letter _v_ in the word live; and thus the vow \"to love,  honour, comfort, &c., so long as ye both shall live,\" was made to read  \"so long as ye both shall like!\" The change was not discovered until the  whole of the edition was printed off. If the sheets are still preserved  it would be a good speculation to send them to some of the States in  America, where people are \"exceedingly divorced.\" May they long remain  useless in Great Britain! For nothing is more dangerous than to unite  two persons so closely in all their interests and concerns as man and  wife, without rendering the union entire and total.    In that very interesting Bible story of Nabal and Abigail, a noble woman  is seen making the best of an extremely bad matrimonial bargain. If her  marriage with Nabal, who was a churlish, ill-tempered, drunken fool, was  one of the worst possible, does not her conduct teach the lesson that  something may be done to mitigate the miseries of even the most  frightful state of marriage? Who shall say how many heroines unknown to  fame there are who imitate her? Their husbands are weak-willed, foolish,  idle,"]]]
