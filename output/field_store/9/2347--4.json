If we of the United States today will call to mind certain Western small  towns of some decades ago--if we will review them as they are pictured  in poem and novel and play--we may receive, as it were out of the tail  of the eye, an impression of some aspects of these western plantings of  the seventeenth century. The dare-devil, the bully, the tenderfoot, the  gambler, the gentleman-desperado had their counterparts in Virginia. So  had the cool, indomitable sheriff and his dependable posse, the friends  generally of law and order. Dale may be viewed as the picturesque  sheriff of this earlier age.    But it must be remembered that this Virginia was of the seventeenth, not  of the nineteenth century. And law had cruel and idiot faces as well as  faces just and wise. Hitherto the colony possessed no written statutes.  The Company now resolved to impose upon the wayward an iron restraint.  It fell to Dale to enforce the regulations known as \"Lawes and Orders,  dyvine, politique, and martiall for the Colonye of Virginia\"--not  English civil law simply, but laws \"chiefly extracted out of the Lawes  for governing the army in the Low Countreys.\" The first part of this  code was compiled by William Strachey; the latter part is thought to  have been the work of Sir Edward Cecil, Sir Thomas Gates, and Dale  himself, approved and accepted by the Virginia Company. Ten years  afterwards, defending itself before a Committee of Parliament, the  Company through its Treasurer declared \"the necessity of such laws, in  some cases ad terrorem, and in some to be truly executed.\"    Seventeenth-century English law herself was terrible enough in all  conscience, but \"Dale's Laws\" went beyond. Offences ranged from failure  to attend church and idleness to lese majeste. The penalties were  gross--cruel whippings, imprisonments, barbarous puttings to death. The  High Marshal held the unruly down with a high hand.    But other factors than this Draconian code worked at last toward order  in this English West. Dale was no small statesman, and he played ferment  against ferment. Into Virginia now first came private ownership of land.  So much was given to each colonist, and care of this booty became  to each a preoccupation. The Company at home sent out more and more  settlers, and more and more of the industrious, peace-loving sort. By  1612 the English in America numbered about eight hundred. Dale projected  another town, and chose for its site the great horseshoe bend in the  river a few miles below the Falls of the Far West, at a spot we now call  Dutch Gap. Here Dale laid out a town which he named Henricus after the  Prince of Wales, and for its citizens he drafted from Jamestown three  hundred persons. To him also are due Bermuda and Shirley Hundreds and  Dale's Gift over on the Eastern Shore. As the Company sent over more  colonists, there began to show, up and down the James though at far  intervals, cabins and clearings made by white men, set about with a  stockade, and at the river edge a rude landing and a fastened boat. The  restless search for mines of gold and silver now slackened. Instead eyes  turned for wealth to the kingdom of the plant and tree, and to fur trade  and fisheries.         * Hitherto there had been no trading or landholding by       individuals. All the colonists contributed the products of       their toil to the common store and received their supplies       from the Company. The adventurers (stockholders) contributed       money to the enterprise; the colonists, themselves and their       labor.    Those ships that brought colonists were in every instance expected  to return to England laden with the commodities of Virginia. At first  cargoes of precious ores were looked for. These failing, the Company  must take from Virginia what lay at hand and what might be suited to  English needs. In 1610 the Company issued a paper of instructions upon  this subject of Virginia commodities. The daughter was expected to  send to the mother country sassafras root, bay berries, puccoon,  sarsaparilla, walnut, chestnut, and chinquapin oil, wine, silk grass,  beaver cod, beaver and otter skins, clapboard of oak and walnut, tar,  pitch, turpentine, and powdered sturgeon.    It might seem that Virginia was headed to become a land of fishers, of  foresters, and vine dressers, perhaps even, when the gold should be  at last discovered, of miners. At home, the colonizing merchants and  statesmen looked for some such thing. In return for what she laded into  ships, Virginia was to receive English-made goods, and to an especial  degree woolen goods, \"a very liberall utterance of our English cloths  into a maine country described to be bigger than all Europe.\" There was  to be direct trade, country kind for country kind, and no specie to be  taken out of England. The promoters at home doubtless conceived a hardy  and simple trans-Atlantic folk of their own kindred, planters for their  own needs, steady consumers of the plainer sort of English wares, steady  gatherers, in return, of necessaries for which England otherwise must  trade after a costly fashion with lands which were not always friendly.  A simple, sturdy, laborious Virginia, white men and Indians. If this was  their dream, reality was soon to modify it.      A new commodity of unsuspected commercial value began now to be grown in  garden-plots along the James--the \"weed\" par excellence, tobacco. That  John Rolfe who had been shipwrecked on the Sea Adventure was now a  planter in Virginia. His child Bermuda had died in infancy, and his wife  soon after their coming to Jamestown. Rolfe remained, a young man, a  good citizen, and a Christian. And he loved tobacco. On that trivial  fact hinges an important chapter in the economic history of America.  In 1612 Rolfe planted tobacco in his own garden, experimented with its  culture, and prophesied that the Virginian weed would rank with the  best Spanish. It was now a shorter plant, smaller-leafed and  smaller-flowered, but time and skilful gardening would improve it.    England had known tobacco for thirty years, owing its introduction to  Raleigh. At first merely amused by the New World rarity, England was  now by general use turning a luxury into a necessity. More and more she  received through Dutch and Spanish ships tobacco from the Indies. Among  the English adventurers to Virginia some already knew the uses of the  weed; others soon learned from the Indians. Tobacco was perhaps not  indigenous to Virginia, but had probably come through southern tribes  who in turn had gained it from those who knew it in its tropic habitat.  Now, however, tobacco was grown by all Virginia Indians, and  was regarded as the Great Spirit's best gift. In the final happy  hunting-ground, kings, werowances, and priests enjoyed it forever. When,  in the time after the first landing, the Indians brought gifts to the  adventurers as to beings from a superior sphere, they offered tobacco as  well as comestibles like deer-meat and mulberries. Later, in England and  in Virginia, there was some suggestion that it might be cultivated among  other commodities. But the Company, not to be diverted from the path  to profits, demanded from Virginia necessities and not new-fangled  luxuries. Nevertheless, a little tobacco was sent over to England, and  then a little more, and then a larger quantity. In less than five years  it had become a main export; and from that time to this profoundly has  it affected the life of Virginia and, indeed, of the United States.    This then is the wide and general event with which John Rolfe is  connected. But there is also a narrower, personal happening that has  pleased all these centuries. Indian difficulties yet abounded, but Dale,  administrator as well as man of Mars, wound his way skilfully through  them all. Powhatan brooded to one side, over there at Werowocomoco.  Captain Samuel Argall was again in Virginia, having brought over  sixty-two colonists in his ship, the Treasurer. A bold and restless man,  explorer no less than mariner, he again went trading up the Potomac,  and visited upon its banks the village of Japazaws, kinsman of Powhatan.  Here he found no less a personage than Powhatan's daughter Pocahontas.  An idea came into Argall's active and somewhat unscrupulous brain.  He bribed Japazaws with a mighty gleaming copper kettle, and by that  chief's connivance took Pocahontas from the village above the Potomac.  He brought her captive in his boat down the Chesapeake to the mouth of  the James and so up the river to Jamestown, here to be held hostage for  an Indian peace. This was in 1613.    Pocahontas stayed by the James, in the rude settlers' town, which may  have seemed to the Indian girl stately and wonderful enough. Here Rolfe  made her acquaintance, here they talked together, and here, after some  scruples on his part as to \"heathennesse,\" they were married. He writes  of \"her desire to be taught and instructed in the knowledge of God; her  capableness of understanding; her aptnesse and willingnesse to  recieve anie good impression, and also the spiritual, besides her owne  incitements stirring me up hereunto.\" First she was baptized, receiving  the name Rebecca, and then she was married to Rolfe in the flower-decked  church at Jamestown. Powhatan was not there, but he sent young chiefs,  her brothers, in his place. Rolfe had lands and cabins thereupon up  the river near Henricus. He called this place Varina, the best Spanish  tobacco being Varinas. Here he and Pocahontas dwelled together \"civilly  and lovingly.\" When two years had passed the couple went with their  infant son upon a visit to England. There court and town and country  flocked to see the Indian \"princess.\" After a time she and Rolfe would  go back to Virginia. But at Gravesend, before their ship sailed, she was  stricken with smallpox and died, making \"a religious and godly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2900"],[0,"The Age of Invention: A Chronicle of Mechanical Conquest (#10)"],[1,"off clouds of steam and making quite a sensation on the  streets.    Evans had never forgotten his dream of the \"steam wagon.\" His Oruktor  had no sooner begun puffing than he offered to make for the Philadelphia  and Lancaster Turnpike Company steamdriven carriages to take the place  of their six-horse Conestoga wagons, promising to treble their profits.  But the directors of the road were conservative men and his arguments  fell on deaf ears.    In the same year Evans petitioned Congress for an extension of the  patent on his flour-milling machinery, which was about to expire. He  had derived little profit from this important invention, as the new  machinery made its way very slowly, but every year more and more millers  were using it and Evans received royalties from them. He felt sure that  Congress would renew his patent, and, with great expectations for the  future, he announced a new book in preparation by himself to be called  \"The Young Engineer's Guide\". It was to give the most thorough treatment  to the subject of the steam engine, with a profusion of drawings to  illustrate the text. But Evans reckoned without the millers who were  opposing his petition. Though they were profiting by his invention, they  were unwilling to pay him anything, and they succeeded in having his  bill in Congress defeated. It was a hard blow for the struggling author  and inventor. His income cut off, he was obliged to reduce the scale  of his book \"and to omit many of the illustrations he had promised.\"  He wrote the sad story into the name of the book. It came out under the  title of \"The Abortion of the Young Engineer's Guide\".    Four years later, when Congress restored and extended his patent, Evans  felt that better days were ahead, but, as said already, he was too  far ahead of his time to be understood and appreciated. Incredulity,  prejudice, and opposition were his portion as long as he lived.  Nevertheless, he went on building good engines and had the satisfaction  of seeing them in extensive use. His life came to an end as the result  of what to him was the greatest possible tragedy. He was visiting  New York City in 1819, when news came to him of the destruction by an  incendiary of his beloved shops in Philadelphia. The shock was greater  than he could bear. A stroke of apoplexy followed, from which he died.    The following prophecy, written by Oliver Evans and published in 1812,  seventeen years before the practical use of the locomotive began, tells  us something of the vision of this early American inventor:    \"The time will come when people will travel in stages moved by steam  engines from one city to another almost as fast as birds fly--fifteen  to twenty miles an hour. Passing through the air with such  velocity--changing the scenes in such rapid succession--will be the  most exhilarating, delightful exercise. A carriage will set out  from Washington in the morning, and the passengers will breakfast at  Baltimore, dine in Philadelphia, and sup at New York the same day.    \"To accomplish this, two sets of railways will be laid so nearly level  as not in any place to deviate more than two degrees from a horizontal  line, made of wood or iron, on smooth paths of broken stone or gravel,  with a rail to guide the carriages so that they may pass each other  in different directions and travel by night as well as by day; and the  passengers will sleep in these stages as comfortably as they do now in  steam stage-boats.\"*         *Cited by Coleman Sellers, Ibid., p. 13.      Another early advocate of steam carriages and railways was John Stevens,  the rich inventor of Hoboken, who figures in the story of the steamboat.  In February, 1812, Stevens addressed to the commissioners appointed by  the State of New York to explore a route for the Erie Canal an elaborate  memoir calculated to prove that railways would be much more in the  public interest than the proposed canal. He wrote at the same time to  Robert R. Livingston (who, as well as Robert Fulton, his partner in the  steamboat, was one of the commissioners) requesting his influence in  favor of railways. Livingston, having committed himself to the steamboat  and holding a monopoly of navigation on the waters of New York State,  could hardly be expected to give a willing ear to a rival scheme, and  no one then seems to have dreamed that both canal and railway would  ultimately be needed. Livingston, however, was an enlightened statesman,  one of the ablest men of his day. He had played a prominent part in the  affairs of the Revolution and in the ratification of the Constitution;  had known Franklin and Washington and had negotiated with Napoleon the  Louisiana Purchase. His reply to Stevens is a good statement of the  objections to the railway, as seen at the time, and of the public  attitude towards it.      Robert R. Livingston to John Stevens    \"Albany, 11th March, 1812.    \"I did not, till yesterday, receive yours of the 5th of February; where  it has loitered on the road I am at a loss to say. I had before read  your very ingenious propositions as to the rail-way communication. I  fear, however, on mature reflection, that they will be liable to serious  objections, and ultimately more expensive than a canal. They must be  double, so as to prevent the danger of two such heavy bodies meeting.  The walls on which they are placed must at least be four feet below the  surface, and three above, and must be clamped with iron, and even then,  would hardly sustain so heavy a weight as you propose moving at the rate  of four miles an hour on wheels. As to wood, it would not last a week;  they must be covered with iron, and that too very thick and strong. The  means of stopping these heavy carriages without a great shock, and of  preventing them from running upon each other (for there would be many on  the road at once) would be very difficult. In case of accidental stops,  or the necessary stops to take wood and water &c many accidents would  happen. The carriage of condensed water would be very troublesome. Upon  the whole, I fear the expense would be much greater than that of canals,  without being so convenient.\"*         * John Stevens, \"Documents Tending to Prove the Superior       Advantages of Rail-Ways and Steam-Carriages over Canal       Navigation\" (1819). Reprinted in \"The Magazine of History       with Notes and Queries\", Extra Number 54 (1917).      Stevens, of course, could not convince the commissioners. \"The  Communication from John Stevens, Esq.,\" was referred to a committee,  who reported in March: \"That they have considered the said communication  with the attention due to a gentleman whose scientific researches and  knowledge of mechanical powers entitle his opinions to great respect,  and are sorry not to concur in them.\"    Stevens, however, kept up the fight. He published all the  correspondence, hoping to get aid from Congress for his design, and  spread his propaganda far and wide. But the War of 1812 soon absorbed  the attention of the country. Then came the Erie Canal, completed in  1825, and the extension into the Northwest of the great Cumberland Road.  From St. Louis steamboats churned their way up the Missouri, connecting  with the Santa Fe Trail to the Southwest and the Oregon Trail to the far  Northwest. Horses, mules, and oxen carried the overland travelers, and  none yet dreamed of being carried on the land by steam.    Back East, however, and across the sea in England, there were a few  dreamers. Railways of wooden rails, sometimes covered with iron, on  which wagons were drawn by horses, were common in Great Britain; some  were in use very early in America. And on these railways, or tramways,  men were now experimenting with steam, trying to harness it to do  the work of horses. In England, Trevithick, Blenkinsop, Ericsson,  Stephenson, and others; in America, John Stevens, now an old man but  persistent in his plans as ever and with able sons to help him, had  erected a circular railway at Hoboken as early as 1826, on which he ran  a locomotive at the rate of twelve miles an hour. Then in 1828 Horatio  Allen, of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company, went over to England  and brought back with him the Stourbridge Lion. This locomotive, though  it was not a success in practice, appears to have been the first to turn  a wheel on a regular railway within the United States. It was a seven  days' wonder in New York when it arrived in May, 1829. Then Allen  shipped it to Honesdale, Pennsylvania, where the Delaware and Hudson  Canal Company had a tramway to bring down coal from the mountains to the  terminal of the canal. On the crude wooden rails of this tramway Allen  placed the Stourbridge Lion and ran it successfully at the rate of ten  miles an hour. But in actual service the Stourbridge Lion failed and was  soon dismantled.    Pass now to Rainhill, England, and witness the birth of the modern  locomotive, after all these years of labor. In the same year of 1829, on  the morning of the 6th of October, a great crowd had assembled to see an  extraordinary race--a race, in fact, without any parallel or precedent  whatsoever. There were four entries but one dropped out, leaving three:  The Novelty, John Braithwaite and John Ericsson; The Sanspareil, Timothy  Hackworth; The Rocket, George and Robert Stephenson. These were  not horses; they were locomotives. The directors of the London and  Manchester Railway had offered a prize of five hundred pounds for the  best locomotive, and here they were to try the issue.    The contest resulted in the triumph of Stephenson's Rocket. The others  fell early out of the race. The Rocket alone met all the requirements  and won the prize. So it happened that George Stephenson came into  fame and has ever since lived in popular memory as the father of  the locomotive. There was nothing new in his Rocket, except his own  workmanship. Like Robert Fulton, he appears to have succeeded where"]]]
