One  thinks of the great myth of the Tempter and the \"cause of all our woe,\"  and wonders if the Arch Enemy is not now playing off some of his pranks  before him. Whether we call it snake or devil matters little. I could  but admire his terrible beauty, however; his black, shining folds, his  easy, gliding movement, head erect, eyes glistening, tongue playing like  subtle flame, and the invisible means of his almost winged locomotion.    The parent birds, in the mean while, kept up the most agonizing cry, at  times fluttering furiously about their pursuer, and actually laying hold  of his tail with their beaks and claws. On being thus attacked, the  snake would suddenly double upon himself and follow his own body back,  thus executing a strategic movement that at first seemed almost to  paralyze his victim and place her within his grasp. Not quite, however.  Before his jaws could close upon the coveted prize the bird would tear  herself away, and, apparently faint and sobbing, retire to a higher  branch. His reputed powers of fascination availed him little, though it  is possible that a frailer and less combative bird might have been held  by the fatal spell. Presently, as he came gliding down the slender body  of a leaning alder, his attention was attracted by a slight movement of  my arm; eyeing me an instant, with that crouching, utterly motionless  gaze which I believe only snakes and devils can assume, he turned  quickly--a feat which necessitated something like crawling over his own  body--and glided off through the branches, evidently recognizing in me a  representative of the ancient parties he once so cunningly ruined. A few  moments later, as he lay carelessly disposed in the top of a rank alder,  trying to look as much like a crooked branch as his supple, shining form  would admit, the old vengeance overtook him. I exercised my prerogative,  and a well-directed missile, in the shape of a stone, brought him  looping and writhing to the ground. After I had completed his downfall  and quiet had been partly restored, a half-fledged member of the  bereaved household came out from his hiding-place, and, jumping upon a  decayed branch, chirped vigorously, no doubt in celebration of the  victory.          THE BOBOLINK      The bobolink has a secure place in literature, having been laureated by  no less a poet than Bryant, and invested with a lasting human charm in  the sunny page of Irving, and is the only one of our songsters, I  believe, that the mockingbird cannot parody or imitate. He affords the  most marked example of exuberant pride, and a glad, rollicking, holiday  spirit, that can be seen among our birds. Every note expresses  complacency and glee. He is a beau of the first pattern, and, unlike any  other bird of my acquaintance, pushes his gallantry to the point of  wheeling gayly into the train of every female that comes along, even  after the season of courtship is over and the matches are all settled;  and when she leads him on too wild a chase, he turns lightly about and  breaks out with a song that is precisely analogous to a burst of gay and  self-satisfied laughter, as much as to say, \"_Ha! ha! ha! I must have my  fun, Miss Silverthimble, thimble, thimble, if I break every heart in the  meadow, see, see, see!_\"    At the approach of the breeding-season the bobolink undergoes a complete  change; his form changes, his color changes, his flight changes. From  mottled brown or brindle he becomes black and white, earning, in some  localities, the shocking name of \"skunk bird\"; his small, compact form  becomes broad and conspicuous, and his ordinary flight is laid aside for  a mincing, affected gait, in which he seems to use only the very tips of  his wings. It is very noticeable what a contrast he presents to his mate  at this season, not only in color but in manners, she being as shy and  retiring as he is forward and hilarious. Indeed, she seems disagreeably  serious and indisposed to any fun or jollity, scurrying away at his  approach, and apparently annoyed at every endearing word and look. It is  surprising that all this parade of plumage and tinkling of cymbals  should be gone through with and persisted in to please a creature so  coldly indifferent as she really seems to be.    I know of no other song-bird that expresses so much self-consciousness  and vanity, and comes so near being an ornithological coxcomb. The  redbird, the yellowbird, the indigo-bird, the oriole, the cardinal  grosbeak, and others, all birds of brilliant plumage and musical  ability, seem quite unconscious of self, and neither by tone nor act  challenge the admiration of the beholder.    If I were a bird, in building my nest I should follow the example of the  bobolink, placing it in the midst of a broad meadow, where there was no  spear of grass, or flower, or growth unlike another to mark its site. I  judge that the bobolink escapes the dangers to which nesting birds are  liable as few or no other birds do. Unless the mowers come along at an  earlier date than she has anticipated, that is, before July 1, or a  skunk goes nosing through the grass, which is unusual, she is as safe as  bird well can be in the great open of nature. She selects the most  monotonous and uniform place she can find amid the daisies or the  timothy and clover, and places her simple structure upon the ground in  the midst of it. There is no concealment, except as the great conceals  the little, as the desert conceals the pebble, as the myriad conceals  the unit. You may find the nest once, if your course chances to lead you  across it, and your eye is quick enough to note the silent brown bird as  she darts swiftly away; but step three paces in the wrong direction, and  your search will probably be fruitless. My friend and I found a nest by  accident one day, and then lost it again one minute afterward. I moved  away a few yards to be sure of the mother bird, charging my friend not  to stir from his tracks. When I returned, he had moved two paces, he  said (he had really moved four), and we spent a half-hour stooping over  the daisies and the buttercups, looking for the lost clew. We grew  desperate, and fairly felt the ground over with our hands, but without  avail. I marked the spot with a bush, and came the next day, and, with  the bush as a centre, moved about it in slowly increasing circles,  covering, I thought, nearly every inch of ground with my feet, and  laying hold of it with all the visual power I could command, till my  patience was exhausted, and I gave up, baffled. I began to doubt the  ability of the parent birds themselves to find it, and so secreted  myself and watched. After much delay, the male bird appeared with food  in his beak, and, satisfying himself that the coast was clear, dropped  into the grass which I had trodden down in my search. Fastening my eye  upon a particular meadow-lily, I walked straight to the spot, bent down,  and gazed long and intently into the grass. Finally my eye separated the  nest and its young from its surroundings. My foot had barely missed them  in my search, but by how much they had escaped my eye I could not tell.  Probably not by distance at all, but simply by unrecognition. They were  virtually invisible. The dark gray and yellowish-brown dry grass and  stubble of the meadow-bottom were exactly copied in the color of the  half-fledged young. More than that, they hugged the nest so closely and  formed such a compact mass, that though there were five of them, they  preserved the unit of expression,--no single head or form was defined;  they were one, and that one was without shape or color, and not  separable, except by closest scrutiny, from the one of the  meadow-bottom. That nest prospered, as bobolinks' nests doubtless  generally do; for, notwithstanding the enormous slaughter of the birds  by Southern sportsmen during their fall migrations, the bobolink appears  to hold its own, and its music does not diminish in our Northern  meadows.      THE BOBOLINK        Daisies, clover, buttercup,        Redtop, trefoil, meadowsweet,      Ecstatic pinions, soaring up,        Then gliding down to grassy seat.        Sunshine, laughter, mad desires,        May day, June day, lucid skies,      All reckless moods that love inspires--        The gladdest bird that sings and flies.        Meadows, orchards, bending sprays,        Rushes, lilies, billowy wheat,      Song and frolic fill his days,        A feathered rondeau all complete.        Pink bloom, gold bloom, fleabane white,        Dewdrop, raindrop, cooling shade,      Bubbling throat and hovering flight,        And jocund heart as e'er was made.          THE WOOD THRUSH      The wood thrush is the handsomest species of the thrush family. In grace  and elegance of manner he has no equal. Such a gentle, high-bred air,  and such inimitable ease and composure in his flight and movement! He is  a poet in very word and deed. His carriage is music to the eye. His  performance of the commonest act, as catching a beetle, or picking a  worm from the mud, pleases like a stroke of wit or eloquence. Was he a  prince in the olden time, and do the regal grace and mien still adhere  to him in his transformation? What a finely proportioned form! How  plain, yet rich, his color,--the bright russet of his back, the clear  white of his breast, with the distinct heart-shaped spots! It may be  objected to Robin that he is noisy and demonstrative; he hurries away or  rises to a branch with an angry note, and flirts his wings in ill-bred  suspicion. The thrasher, or red thrush, sneaks and skulks like a  culprit, hiding in the densest alders; the catbird is a coquette and a  flirt, as well as a sort of female Paul Pry; and the chewink shows his  inhospitality by "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26059"],[0,"The Ascent of Denali (Mount McKinley) (#10)"],[1,"below was visible and nothing above,  and a few minutes later everything below would be obscured and  everything above revealed.    This great crescent range is, indeed, our rampart against the hateful  humidity of the coast and gives to us in the interior the dry, windless,  exhilarating cold that is characteristic of our winters. We owe it  mainly to this range that our snowfall averages about six feet instead  of the thirty or forty feet that falls on the coast. The winds that  sweep northward toward this mountain range are saturated with moisture  from the warm waters of the Pacific Ocean; but contact with the lofty  colds condenses the moisture into clouds and precipitates most of it on  the southern slopes as snow. Still bearing all the moisture their  lessened temperature will allow, the clouds pour through every notch and  gap in the range and press resolutely onward and downward, streaming  along the glaciers toward the interior. But all the time of their  passage they are parting with their moisture, for the snow is falling  from them continually in their course. They reach the interior, indeed,  and spread out triumphant over the lowlands, but most of their burden  has been deposited along the way. One is reminded of the government  train of mules from Fort Egbert that used to supply the remote posts of  the \"strategic\" telegraph line before strategy yielded to economy and  the useless line was abandoned. When the train reached the Tanana  Crossing it had eaten up nine-tenths of its original load, and only  one-tenth remained for the provisioning of the post. So these clouds  were being squeezed like a sponge; every saddle they pushed through  squeezed them; every peak and ridge they surmounted squeezed them; every  glacier floor they crept down squeezed them, and they reached the  interior valleys attenuated, depleted, and relatively harmless.    [Sidenote: Aneroids]    The aneroids had kept fairly well with the mercurial barometer and the  boiling-point thermometer until we moved to the ridge; from this time  they displayed a progressive discrepancy therewith that put them out of  serious consideration, and one was as bad as the other. Eleven thousand  feet seemed the limit of their good behavior. To set them back day by  day, like Captain Cuttle's watch, would be to depend wholly upon the  other instruments anyway, and this is just what we did, not troubling to  adjust them. They were read and recorded merely because that routine had  been established. Says Burns:        \"There was a lad was born in Kyle,       But whatna day o' whatna style,       I doubt it's hardly worth the while       To be sae nice wi' Robin.\"    So they were just aneroids: aluminum cases, jewelled movements,  army-officer patented improvements, Kew certificates, import duty, and  all--just aneroids, and one was as bad as the other. Within their  limitations they are exceedingly useful instruments, but it is folly to  depend on them for measuring great heights.    Perched up here, the constant struggle of the clouds from the humid  south to reach the interior was interesting to watch, and one readily  understood that Denali and his lesser companions are a prime factor in  the climate of interior Alaska.    Day by day Karstens and Walter would go up and resume the finding and  making of a way, and Tatum and the writer would relay the stuff from the  camp to a cache, some five hundred feet above, and thence to another.  The grand objective point toward which the advance party was working was  the earthquake cleavage--a clean, sharp cut in the ice and snow of fifty  feet in height. Above that point all was smooth, though fearfully steep;  below was the confusion the earthquake had wrought. Each day Karstens  felt sure they would reach the break, but each day as they advanced  toward it the distance lengthened and the intricate difficulties  increased. More than once a passage painfully hewn in the solid ice had  to be abandoned, because it gave no safe exit, and some other passage  found. At last the cleavage was reached, and it proved the most ticklish  piece of the whole ridge to get around. Just below it was a loose snow  slope at a dangerous angle, where it seemed only the initial impulse was  needed for an avalanche to bear it all below. And just before crossing  that snow slope was a wall of overhanging ice beneath which steps must  be cut for one hundred yards, every yard of which endangered the climber  by disputing the passage of the pack upon his shoulders.    [Illustration: A dangerous passage.]    [Sidenote: The Primus Stove]    Late in the evening of the 27th May, looking up the ridge upon our  return from relaying a load to the cache, we saw Karstens and Walter  standing, clear-cut, against the sky, upon the surface of the unbroken  snow _above_ the earthquake cleavage. Tatum and I gave a great shout of  joy, and, far above as they were, they heard us and waved their  response. We watched them advance upon the steep slope of the ridge  until the usual cloud descended and blotted them out. The way was clear  to the top of the ridge now, and that night our spirits were high, and  congratulations were showered upon the victorious pioneers. The next  day, when they would have gone on to the pass, the weather drove them  back. On that smooth, steep, exposed slope a wind too high for safety  beat upon them, accompanied by driving snow. That day a little accident  happened that threatened our whole enterprise--on such small threads do  great undertakings hang. The primus stove is an admirable device for  heating and cooking--superior, one thinks, to all the newfangled  \"alcohol utilities\"--but it has a weak point. The fine stream of  kerosene--which, under pressure from the air-pump, is impinged against  the perforated copper cup, heated to redness by burning alcohol, and is  thus vaporized--first passes through several convolutions of pipe within  the burner, and then issues from a hole so fine that some people would  not call it a hole at all but an orifice or something like that. That  little hole is the weak spot of the primus stove. Sometimes it gets  clogged, and then a fine wire mounted upon some sort of handle must be  used to dislodge the obstruction. Now, the worst thing that can happen  to a primus stove is to get the wire pricker broken off in the burner  hole, and that is what happened to us. Without a special tool that we  did not possess, it is impossible to get at that burner to unscrew it,  and without unscrewing it the broken wire cannot be removed. Tatum and I  turned the stove upside down and beat upon it and tapped it, but nothing  would dislodge that wire. It looked remarkably like no supper; it looked  alarmingly like no more stove. How we wished we had brought the other  stove from the launch, also! Every bow on an undertaking of this kind  should have two strings. But when Karstens came back he went to work at  once, and this was one of the many occasions when his resourcefulness  was of the utmost service. With a file, and his usual ingenuity, he  constructed, out of the spoon-bowl of a pipe cleaner the writer had in  his pocket, the special tool necessary to grip that little burner, and  soon the burner was unscrewed and the broken wire taken out and the  primus was purring away merrily again, melting the water for supper. We  feel sure that we would have pushed on even had we been without fire.  The pemmican was cooked already, and could be eaten as it was, and one  does not die of thirst in the midst of snow; but calm reflection will  hardly allow that we could have reached the summit had we been deprived  of all means of cooking and heating.    [Sidenote: Germless Air]    On this ridge the dough refused to sour, and since our baking-powder was  consumed in the fire we were henceforth without bread. A cold night  killed the germ in the sour dough, and we were never again able to set  up a fermentation in it. Doubtless the air at this altitude is free from  the necessary spores or germs of ferment. Pasteur's and Tyndall's  experiments on the Alps, which resulted in the overthrow of the theory  of spontaneous generation, and the rehabilitation of the old dogma that  life comes only from life, were recalled with interest, but without much  satisfaction. We tried all sorts of ways of cooking the flour, but none  with any success. Next to the loss of sugar we felt the loss of bread,  and in the food longings that overtook us bread played a large part.    On Friday, 30th May, the way had been prospected right up to the pass  which gives entrance to the Grand Basin; a camping-place had been dug  out there and a first load of stuff carried through and cached. So on  that morning we broke camp, and the four of us, roped together, began  the most important advance we had made yet. With stiff packs on our  backs we toiled up the steps that had been cut with so much pains and  stopped at the cache just below the cleavage to add yet further burdens.  All day nothing was visible beyond our immediate environment. Again and  again one would have liked to photograph the sensational-looking  traverse of some particularly difficult ice obstacle, but the mist  enveloped everything.    Just before we reached the smooth snow slope above the range of the  earthquake disturbance lay one of the really dangerous passages of the  climb.    [Sidenote: A Perilous Passage]    It is easier to describe the difficulty and danger of this particular  portion of the ascent than to give a clear impression to a reader of  other places almost as hazardous. Directly below the earthquake cleavage  was an enormous mass of ice, detached from the cleavage wall. From  below, it had seemed connected with that wall, and much time and toil  had been expended in cutting steps up it and along its crest, only to  find a great gulf fixed; so it was necessary to pass along its base. Now  from its base there fell away at an exceedingly"]]]
