We may here observe, that this work, which has maintained its  colours so well that it almost appears of recent execution, confers  great honour on a young artist of twenty years of age; as we do not find  a composition of such magnitude, in the passage from ancient to modern  art, conceived by any single painter. So that if Raffaello stood not  entirely alone in this work, the best part of it must still be assigned  to him, since Pinturicchio himself was improving at this time, and the  works which he afterwards executed at Spello and Siena itself, incline  more to the modern than any he had before done. This will justify us in  concluding that Raffaello had already, at that early age, far  outstripped his master; his contour being more full, his composition  more rich and free, accompanied by an ornamental and grander style, and  an ability unlimited, and capable of embracing every subject that was  presented to him.    The works which he saw in Florence did not lead him out of his own path,  as, to mention one instance, afterwards happened to Franco, who, coming  from Venice, applied himself to a style of design and a career entirely  new. Raffaello had formed his own system, and only sought examples, to  enlarge his ideas and facilitate his execution. He therefore studied the  works of Masaccio, an elegant and expressive painter, whose Adam and Eve  he afterwards adopted in the Vatican. He also became acquainted with Fra  Bartolommeo, who, about this time, had returned to the exercise of his  profession. To this artist he taught the principles of perspective, and  acquired from him, in return, a better style of colouring. We have not  any record to prove that he made himself known to Da Vinci; and the  portrait of Raffaello, in the ducal gallery in Florence, which is said  to be by Lionardo, is an unknown head. I would willingly, however,  flatter myself, that a congeniality of mind and an affinity of genius,  emulous in the pursuit of perfection, must have produced a knowledge of  each other, if it did not conciliate a mutual attachment. No one  certainly was more capable than Da Vinci, of communicating to Raffaello  a degree of refinement and knowledge, which he could not have received  from Pietro; and to introduce him into the more subtle views of art. As  to Michelangiolo, his pictures were rare, and less analogous to the  genius of Raffaello. His celebrated Cartoon was not yet finished, in  1504, and that great master was jealous of its being seen, before its  entire completion. He finished it some few years afterwards, when he  returned to Florence on his flight from Rome, occasioned by the anger of  Julius II. Raffaello therefore could not have had the opportunity of  studying it at that time, nor did he then long remain in Florence, for,  as Vasari states, he was soon obliged to return to his native place, in  consequence of the death of his parents.[31] In 1505 we find him in  Perugia: and to this year belongs the chapel of S. Severo, and the  Crucifixion, which was severed from the wall, and preserved by the Padri  Camaldolensi. From these works, which are all in fresco, we may  ascertain the style which he acquired in Florence; and I think we may  assert, that it was not anatomical, no traces of it being visible in the  body of the Redeemer, which was an opportunity well adapted for the  exhibition of it. Nor was it the study of the beautiful, of which he had  previously exhibited such delightful specimens; nor that of expression,  as there were not to be found in Florence, heads more expressive and  lovely than those he had painted. But after his visit to Florence, we  find his colouring more delicate, and his grouping and the  foreshortening of his figures improved; whether or not he owed it to the  example of Da Vinci or Bonarruoti, or both together, or to some of the  older masters. He afterwards repaired to Florence, but soon quitted it  again, in order to paint in the church of S. Francis, in Perugia, a dead  Christ entombed, the cartoon of which he had designed at Florence; and  which picture was first placed in the church of S. Francis, was  afterwards, in the pontificate of Paul V., transferred to Rome, and is  now in the Borghese palace. After this he returned again to Florence,  and remained there until his departure for Rome, at the end of the year  1508. In this interval, more particularly, he executed the works which  are said to be in his second style, though it is a very delicate matter  to attempt to point them out. Vasari assigns to this period the Holy  Family in the Rinuccini gallery, and yet it bears the date of 1506. Of  this second style is undoubtedly the picture of the Madonna and the  infant Christ and S. John, in a beautiful landscape, with ruins in the  distance, which is in the gallery of the Grand Duke, and others, some of  which are to be found in foreign countries. His pictures of this period  are composed in the more usual style of a Madonna, accompanied by  saints, like the picture of the Pitti palace, formerly at Pescia, and  that of S. Fiorenzo in Perugia, which passed into England. The  attitudes, however, the air of the heads, and smaller features of  composition, are beyond a common style. The dead Christ above mentioned,  is in a more novel and superior style. Vasari calls it a most divine  picture; the figures are not numerous; but each fulfils perfectly the  part assigned to it; the subject is most affecting; the heads are  remarkably beautiful, and the earliest of the kind in the restoration of  art, while the expression of profound sorrow and extreme anguish does  not divest them of their beauty. After finishing this work, Raphael was  ambitious of painting an apartment in Florence, one, I believe, of the  Palazzo Pubblico. There remains a letter of his, in which he requests  the Duke of Urbino to write to the Gonfaloniere Soderini, in April,  1508.[32] But his relative, Bramante, procured him a nobler employ in  Rome, recommending him to Julius II. to ornament the Vatican. He removed  thither, and was already established there in the September of the same  year.[33]    We at length, then, behold him fixed in Rome, and placed in the Vatican  at a period, and under circumstances calculated to render him the first  painter in the world. His biographers do not mention his literary  attainments; and, if we were to judge from his letter just cited, and  now in the Museo Borgia, we might consider him grossly illiterate. But  he was then writing to his uncle; and therefore made use of his native  dialect, as is still done even in the public acts in Venice; though he  might be master of, and might use on proper occasions, a more correct  language. Raffaello, too, was of a family fully competent to afford him  the necessary instructions in his early years. Other letters of his are  found in the _Lettere Pittoriche_, in a very different style; and of his  knowledge in matters of importance, it is sufficient to refer to what  Celio Calcagnini, an eminent literary character of the age of Leo,  states of him to Giacomo Zieglero: \"I need not,\" he says, \"mention  Vitruvius, whose precepts he not only explains, but defends or impugns  with evident justice, and with so much temper, that in his objections  there does not appear the slightest asperity. He has excited the  admiration of the Pontiff Leo, and of all the Romans, in such a way,  that they regard him as a man sent down from heaven purposely to restore  the eternal city to its ancient splendour.\"[34] This acknowledged skill  in architecture must suppose an adequate acquaintance with the Latin  language and geometry; and we know from other quarters, that he  assiduously cultivated anatomy, history, and poetry.[35] But his  principal pursuit in Rome was the study of the remains of Grecian  genius, and by which he perfected his knowledge of art. He studied, too,  the ancient buildings, and was instructed in the principles of  architecture for six years by Bramante, in order that on his death he  might succeed him in the management of the building of S. Peter.[36] He  lived among the ancient sculptors, and derived from them not only their  contours and drapery, and attitudes, but the spirit and principles of  the art itself. Nor yet content with what he saw in Rome, he employed  artists to copy the remains of antiquity at Pozzuolo and throughout all  Italy, and even in Greece. Nor did he derive less assistance from living  artists whom he consulted on his compositions. \"The universal esteem  which he enjoyed,\"[37] and his attractive person and engaging manners,  which all accounts unite in describing as incomparable, conciliated him  the favour of the most eminent men of letters of his age; and Bembo,  Castiglione, Giovio, Navagero, Ariosto, Aretino, Fulvio, and Calcagnini,  set a high value on his friendship, and supplied him, we may be allowed  to suppose, with hints and ideas for his works.    His rival Michelangiolo, too, and his party, contributed not a little to  the success of Raffaello. As the contest between Zeuxis and Parrhasius  was beneficial to them both, so the rivalship of Bonarruoti and Sanzio  aided the fame of Michelangiolo, and produced the paintings of the  Sistine chapel; and at the same time contributed to the celebrity of  Raffaello, by producing the pictures of the Vatican, and not a few  others. Michelangiolo disdaining any secondary honours, came to the  combat, as it were, attended by his shield bearer; for he made drawings  in his grand style, and then gave them to F. Sebastiano, the scholar of  Giorgione, to execute; and by these means he hoped that Raffaello would  never be able to rival his productions either in design or colour.  Raffaello stood alone; but aimed at producing works with a degree of  perfection beyond the united efforts of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34604"],[0,"Middle American Frogs of the Hyla microcephala Group (#10)"],[1,"around temporary pools, such as depressions in forests,  flooded fields, and roadside ditches. At the height of their breeding  season, usually in the early part of the rainy season, the  congregations are made up of large numbers of individuals. In April,  1961, and in June, 1966, the senior author noted nearly continuous  choruses of _H. m. microcephala_ in roadside ditches along the 75  kilometers of road between Villa Neily and Palmar Sur, Puntarenas  Province, Cost Rica; on June 20, 1966, at Puerto Viejo, Heredia  Province, Costa Rica, he estimated approximately 900 _Hyla phlebodes_  in one pond, and two nights later noticed that the number of  individuals had increased substantially. Other observations by the  first author on size of breeding congregations include nearly  continuous choruses of _H. m. underwoodi_ between Villahermosa and  Teapa, Tabasco, in July of 1958, an estimated 400 _Hyla robertmertensi_  in a road side ditch 7.2 kilometers west-northwest of Zanatepec,  Oaxaca, on July 13, 1956, and approximately 150 _Hyla sartori_ around  a rocky pool in a riverbed, 11.8 kilometers west-northwest of Tierra  Colorada, Guerrero, on June 28, 1958.    The length of the breeding season seemingly is more dependent on  climatic conditions in various parts of Middle America than on  behavioral differences in the various species. Thus, Fouquette (1960b)  found in the Canal Zone that _H. m. microcephala_ formed breeding  choruses from May through January, the entire rainy season in that  area. In the wetter coastal region of Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica,  the species breeds as early as mid-March, whereas in the drier region  encompassing Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica, and southwestern  Nicaragua breeding activity is initiated by the first heavy rains of  the season, usually in June.    _Hyla phlebodes_ inhabits regions having rainfall throughout the year.  Although large breeding congregations are most common in the early  parts of the rainy season, males probably call throughout the year. At  Puerto Viejo in Costa Rica the senior author has heard _Hyla phlebodes_  in February, April, June, July, and August. Charles W. Myers noted  calling males of this species in the area around Almirante, Bocas del  Toro Province, Panama, in September, October, and February. An  exception to the correlation between rainfall and breeding activity  was noted by the junior author in _Hyla phlebodes_ in the Canal Zone,  where he noticed a decrease in activity of that species in October and  November, when the rains are heaviest and most frequent. Furthermore,  independent observations made by both of us indicate that _H.  phlebodes_ does not reach peaks of activity during or immediately  after heavy rains, but instead builds up to peaks of activity two or  three days after a heavy rain. This is in contrast to the other  species, all of which characteristically inhabit drier environments  than does _H. phlebodes_. Peaks of breeding activity in the other  species occur immediately after, or even during, heavy rains.    The calling location of the males generally is on vegetation above,  or at the edge of, the water. _Hyla microcephala_ and _H. phlebodes_  call almost exclusively from grasses and sedges; _phlebodes_ usually  calls from taller and more dense grasses than does _microcephala_.  Except for some minor differences in calling location observed by  the junior author (Fouquette, 1960b) in the Canal Zone, the differences  in density and height of grasses utilized for calling-locations  probably is dependent primarily on the nature of the available  vegetation. Although bushes and broad-leafed herbs are usually present  at the breeding sites, males of these species seldom utilize them for  calling locations. Both _H. robertmertensi_ and _H. sartori_ have been  observed calling from grasses, herbs, bushes, and low trees. Calling  males of _robertmertensi_ have been found two meters above the ground  in small trees.    Daytime retreats in the breeding season sometimes are no more than  shaded clumps of vegetation adjacent to a pond or in clumps of grass  in a pond. Individuals of _H. m. underwoodi_ were found by day under  the outer sheaths of banana plants next to a water-filled ditch. Dry  season refuges are unknown.    Amplexus is axillary in all four species. Egg deposition has been  observed in _H. m. microcephala_, _m. underwoodi_, and _phlebodes_.  In all three the eggs are deposited in small masses that float near  the surface of the water and usually are at least partly attached to  emergent vegetation. Each clutch does not represent the entire egg  complement of the female.    Tadpoles are definitely known of only _H. m. microcephala_ and  _phlebodes_; these have been described in the preceding accounts of  the species. The tadpoles of these two species can be distinguished  readily (Pl. 15). The tadpole of _H. microcephala_ has a uniformly  white venter and nearly transparent tail, whereas in _H. phlebodes_  the venter is flecked anteriorly and the tail is mottled. In life, _H.  microcephala_ is easily recognized by the orange posterior half of  the tail, whereas the tail in _H. phlebodes_ is mottled tan and grayish  brown.          PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS      The evidence already presented on osteology, external structure,  coloration, mating call, and life history emphatically show that the  four species under consideration are a closely related assemblage.  Now the question arises: To what other groups in the genus is the  _Hyla microcephala_ group related? Furthermore, it is pertinent to  this discussion to attempt a reconstruction of the phylogeny of the  group as a whole and of the individual species in the _Hyla  microcephala_ group. With regard to the relationships of the group we  must take into account certain species in South America. Our endeavors  there are hampered by the absence of data on the mating calls and life  histories of most of the relevant species.    As mentioned in the account of _Hyla m. microcephala_, the species  _microcephala_ possibly is subspecifically related to _Hyla misera_, a  frog widespread in the Amazon Basin. _Hyla misera_ resembles  _microcephala_ in coloration, external structure, and cranial  characters. The frontoparietals are equally poorly ossified, and the  frontoparietal fontanelle is extensive. Our principal reason for not  considering the two taxa conspecific at this time is our lack of  knowledge concerning the color of living _H. misera_, the structure of  the tadpoles, and the characteristics of the mating call. Even with the  absence of such data that we think essential to establish the  nomenclature status of the taxa, we are confident that the two are  sufficiently closely related that any discussion of the phylogenetic  relationships of one species certainly must involve consideration of  the other.    _Hyla misera_ possibly is allied to other small yellowish tan South  American _Hyla_ that lack dark pigmentation on the thighs. Probable  relatives are _Hyla elongata_, _minuta_ (with _goughi_, _pallens_,  _suturata_, _velata_, and possibly others as synonyms), _nana_, and  _werneri_. The consideration of the interspecific relationships of  these taxa is beyond the scope of this paper, but we can say that each  of these species has a pale yellowish tan dorsum, relatively broad  dorsolateral brown stripe, and narrow longitudinal brown lines or  irregular marks on the dorsum. Furthermore, examination of the skulls  of _elongata_, _nana_, and _werneri_ reveals that they are like  _misera_ and _microcephala_ in the nature of the frontoparietal  fontanelle and in having a greatly reduced quadratojugal. Thus, on the  basis of cranial and external characters the _Hyla microcephala_ group  can be associated with _Hyla misera_ and its apparent allies in South  America. This association can be only tentative until the mating calls,  tadpoles, and chromosome numbers of the South American species are  known.    Among the Middle American hylids, only the _Hyla microcephala_ group  and _H. ebraccata_ have a haploid number of 15 chromosomes (Duellman  and Cole, 1965). All other New World _Hyla_, for which the number is  known, have a haploid number of 12; the only other _Hyla_ having 15  is a Papuan _Hyla angiana_ (Duellman, 1967).    _Hyla ebraccata_ occurs in the humid tropical lowlands of Middle  America and the Pacific lowlands of northwestern South America. It is  the northernmost, and only Central American, representative of the  _Hyla leucophyllata_ group, which is diverse (about 10 species  currently recognized) and widespread in tropical South America east of  the Andes. This group is characterized by having broad, flat skulls  with larger nasals and more ossification of the frontoparietals than  in the _Hyla microcephala_ group. The quadratojugal is present as a  small anteriorly projecting spur that does not connect with the  maxillary. Externally, the _Hyla leucophyllata_ group is characterized  by having a well-developed axillary membrane, uniformly yellow thighs,  and a dorsal color pattern in many species consisting of a dark lateral  band, a pale dorsolateral band or dorsal ground color, and a large  middorsal dark mark. In some species, the dorsal pattern consists of  small dark markings or is nearly uniformly pale. At least in the  Central American _Hyla ebraccata_, the mating call consists of a  single primary note followed by a series of shorter secondary notes,  the tadpoles have xiphicercal tails and lack teeth, and the haploid  number of chromosomes is 15. On the strength of these observations it  seems imperative to consider the _Hyla leucophyllata_ group as a close  ally to the _Hyla microcephala_ group. Successful artificial  hybridization supports the close relationship of _H. m. microcephala_  and _phlebodes_; partial success of artificial hybridization of these  two with _ebraccata_ (Fouquette, 1960b) provides further"]]]
