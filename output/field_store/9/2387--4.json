When no  flowers can be found, this is the quickest way to obtain a bee.    It is a singular fact that when the bee first finds the hunter's box  its first feeling is one of anger; it is as mad as a hornet; its tone  changes, it sounds its shrill war trumpet and darts to and fro, and  gives vent to its rage and indignation in no uncertain manner. It seems  to scent foul play at once. It says, \"Here is robbery; here is the  spoil of some hive, may be my own,\" and its blood is up. But its ruling  passion soon comes to the surface, its avarice gets the better of its  indignation, and it seems to say, \"Well, I had better take possession  of this and carry it home.\" So after many feints and approaches and  dartings off with a loud angry hum as if it would none of it, the bee  settles down and fills itself.    It does not entirely cool off and get soberly to work till it has made  two or three trips home with its booty. When other bees come, even if  all from the same swarm, they quarrel and dispute over the box, and clip  and dart at each other like bantam cocks. Apparently the ill feeling  which the sight of the honey awakens is not one of jealousy or rivalry,  but wrath.    A bee will usually make three or four trips from the hunter's box before  it brings back a companion. I suspect the bee does not tell its fellows  what it has found, but that they smell out the secret; it doubtless  bears some evidence with it upon its feet or proboscis that it has been  upon honey-comb and not upon flowers, and its companions take the hint  and follow, arriving always many seconds behind. Then the quantity and  quality of the booty would also betray it. No doubt, also, there are  plenty of gossips about a hive that note and tell everything. \"Oh, did  you see that? Peggy Mel came in a few moments ago in great haste, and  one of the up-stairs packers says she was loaded till she groaned with  apple-blossom honey which she deposited, and then rushed off again  like mad. Apple-blossom honey in October! Fee, fi, fo, fum! I smell  something! Let's after.\"    In about half an hour we have three well-defined lines of bees  established--two to farm-houses and one to the woods, and our box is  being rapidly depleted of its honey. About every fourth bee goes to the  woods, and now that they have learned the way thoroughly they do not  make the long preliminary whirl above the box, but start directly from  it. The woods are rough and dense and the hill steep, and we do not like  to follow the line of bees until we have tried at least to settle the  problem as to the distance they go into the woods-whether the tree is on  this side of the ridge or in the depth of the forest on the other side.  So we shut up the box when it is full of bees and carry it about  three hundred yards along the wall from which we are operating. When  liberated, the bees, as they always will in such cases, go off in the  same directions they have been going; they do not seem to know that they  have been moved. But other bees have followed our scent, and it is not  many minutes before a second line to the woods is established. This is  called cross-lining the bees. The new line makes a sharp angle with the  other line, and we know at once that the tree is only a few rods  into the woods. The two lines we have established form two sides of a  triangle of which the wall is the base; at the apex of the triangle, or  where the two lines meet in the woods, we are sure to find the tree. We  quickly follow up these lines, and where they cross each other on the  side of the hill we scan every tree closely. I pause at the foot of an  oak and examine a hole near the root; now the bees are in this tree and  their entrance is on the upper side near the ground, not two feet from  the hole I peer into, and yet so quiet and secret is their going and  coming that I fail to discover them and pass on up the hill. Failing in  this direction, I return to the oak again, and then perceive the bees  going out in a small crack in the tree. The bees do not know they are  found out and that the game is in our hands, and are as oblivious of our  presence as if we were ants or crickets. The indications are that the  swarm is a small one, and the store of honey trifling. In \"taking up\" a  bee-tree it is usual first to kill or stupefy the bees with the fumes of  burning sulfur or with tobacco smoke. But this course is impracticable  on the present occasion, so we boldly and ruthlessly assault the tree  with an ax we have procured. At the first blow the bees set up a loud  buzzing, but we have no mercy, and the side of the cavity is soon  cut away and the interior with its white-yellow mass of comb-honey is  exposed, and not a bee strikes a blow in defense of its all. This may  seem singular, but it has nearly always been my experience. When a swarm  of bees are thus rudely assaulted with an ax, they evidently think the  end of the world has come, and, like true misers as they are, each one  seizes as much of the treasure as it can hold; in other words they all  fall to and gorge themselves with honey, and calmly await the issue.  When in this condition they make no defense and will not sting unless  taken hold of. In fact they are as harmless as flies. Bees are always to  be managed with boldness and decision.    Any half-way measures, any timid poking about, any feeble attempts to  reach their honey, are sure to be quickly resented. The popular notion  that bees have a special antipathy toward certain persons and a liking  for certain others has only this fact at the bottom of it; they will  sting a person who is afraid of them and goes skulking and dodging  about, and they will not sting a person who faces them boldly and has no  dread of them. They are like dogs. The way to disarm a vicious dog is to  show him you do not fear him; it is his turn to be afraid then. I never  had any dread of bees and am seldom stung by them. I have climbed up  into a large chestnut that contained a swarm in one of its cavities and  chopped them out with an ax, being obliged at times to pause and brush  the bewildered bees from my hands and face, and not been stung once.  I have chopped a swarm out of an apple-tree in June and taken out the  cards of honey and arranged them in a hive, and then dipped out the  bees with a dipper, and taken the whole home with me in pretty good  condition, with scarcely any opposition on the part of the bees. In  reaching your hand into the cavity to detach and remove the comb you  are pretty sure to get stung, for when you touch the \"business end\" of a  bee, it will sting even though its head be off. But the bee carries the  antidote to its own poison. The best remedy for bee sting is honey, and  when your hands are besmeared with honey, as they are sure to be on such  occasions, the wound is scarcely more painful than the prick of a pin.  Assault your bee-tree, then, boldly with your ax, and you will find that  when the honey is exposed every bee has surrendered and the whole swarm  is cowering in helpless bewilderment and terror. Our tree yields only a  few pounds of honey, not enough to have lasted the swarm till January,  but no matter; we have the less burden to carry.    In the afternoon we go nearly half a mile farther along the ridge to  a cornfield that lies immediately in front of the highest point of the  mountain. The view is superb; the ripe autumn landscape rolls away to  the east, cut through by the great placid river; in the extreme north  the wall of the Catskills stands out clear and strong, while in the  south the mountains of the Highlands bound the view. The day is warm and  the bees are very busy there in that neglected corner of the field, rich  in asters, flea-bane, and golden-rod. The corn has been cut, and upon a  stout, but a few rods from the woods, which here drop quickly down from  the precipitous heights, we set up our bee-box, touched again with  the pungent oil. In a few moments a bee has found it; she comes up  to leeward, following the scent. On leaving the box she goes straight  toward the woods. More bees quickly come, and it is not long before the  line is well established. Now we have recourse to the same tactics we  employed before, and move along the ridge to another field to get our  cross line. But the bees still go in almost the same direction they did  from the corn stout. The tree is then either on the top of the mountain  or on the other or west side of it. We hesitate to make the plunge into  the woods and seek to scale those precipices, for the eye can plainly  see what is before us. As the afternoon sun gets lower the bees are seen  with wonderful distinctness. They fly toward and under the sun and are  in a strong light, while the near woods which form the background are  in deep shadow. They look like large luminous motes. Their swiftly  vibrating, transparent wings surround their bodies with a shining nimbus  that makes them visible for a long distance. They seem magnified many  times. We see them bridge the little gulf between us and the woods, then  rise up over the tree-tops with their burdens, swerving neither to the  right hand nor to the left. It is almost pathetic to see them labor so,  climbing the mountain and unwittingly guiding us to their treasures.  When the sun gets down so that his direction corresponds exactly with  the course of the bees, we make the plunge. It proves even harder  climbing than we had anticipated; the mountain is faced by a broken and  irregular wall of rock, up which we pull ourselves slowly and cautiously  by main strength. In half an hour, the perspiration streaming from  every pore, we reach the summit. The trees here are all small, a second  growth, and we are soon convinced the bees are not here. Then down we  go on the other side,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31630"],[0,"Hand-Loom Weaving: A Manual for School and Home (#10)"],[1,"as in No. 12.      NO. 14.

[Sidenote: _These formulas are the basis for numerous tones_]    \"These formulas can be taken as the basis of many other tones and shades  which can be secured by a slight alteration of proportions. By adding a  trifle more dull red, green, indigo, or drab liquid dyes, a color can be  darkened. By using less of these than the formulas call for, the colors  will be lighter. By using more of dull or bright yellow a color can  often be made richer without darkening it. Beginners are cautioned  against making changes until they become familiar with the dyes. In  making new experiments, try them on yard lengths, carefully subdividing  any given formula for both dyes and mordants, and increasing the  proportion of any particular color desired. If the cloth should fail to  take up the dye properly after boiling the full time, increase the  quantity of acid, lifting the cloth out when adding the acid to the dye  bath.\"    Excellent suggestions by Miss Albee for color schemes in stripes may be  found on pages 64 and 65.

In weaving, run the wool through the warp to the very end.  Start the new piece a few warp threads back, being careful to go over  and under exactly the _same_ warp threads as you did when finishing the  end. As you pass these threads you will find that you are taking up the  right warp threads, and that no mistake has been made. It is best to run  the threads past each other in the _middle_ of the mat rather than on  the _sides_. The children learn this method of splicing very quickly and  the result is much more satisfactory than knotting, because the back of  the rug or mat will be smooth. As Mrs. Wiggin says: \"There should never  be a wrong side to work any more than there should be to folks.\"    [Sidenote: _Silkoline, cheese cloth, rags_]    [Sidenote: _Candle-wicking, chenille, and macreme cord_]    In splicing such materials as silkoline, rags, candle-wicking, chenille,  and macreme cord, lay the end of one piece over another, each lapping  about one-quarter inch, and sew securely with silk or thread of like  color. Cut off the selvedge ends of rags. These strips can be run past  each other, but the work will not be so smooth.    [Sidenote: _Germantown wool, heavy worsteds, and rope silk_]    In splicing Germantown wool, heavy worsteds, or rope silk, thread a  worsted needle with one strand obtained by unwinding the wool or silk,  lay one end over the other, and sew over and over. Twist the part just  sewn between the thumb and finger and the splicing will be hardly  visible.    When weaving stripes, splice the wool so that the piecing will come on  top of the rod. In this way the new color will start at the edge of the  rug, as it should, and the number of loops on the rod will be the same  on each side. Consider the _under_ side of the weaving as the _right_  side. It is always smoother and cleaner, and the splicing can be done  more neatly on top of the rod.    [Sidenote: _Raffia_]    Splicing raffia is the most difficult of all, and the method used in  braiding and basket weaving is the best. As you near the end of a strip  in weaving it usually becomes narrower. Find another strip having a  narrow end, and place one over the other, securing, if necessary, by  winding a very narrow piece--just a thread torn from a long piece--and  fastening this by sewing a few times over and over. Or, the two narrow  ends may be run past each other, as in carpet ravelings. Care should be  taken to have the splicing the same width as the other parts of the  weaving, so that the spliced parts will not be noticeable.    [Sidenote: _Leather, leatherette, and celluloid strips_]    Leather, leatherette, and celluloid strips should be long enough to  extend the entire width and length of the frame without splicing. The  ends can be cut, as is done in paper weaving, or turned in some pretty  way like that in the splint work.          Chapter Eight    WOOL AND SILKOLINE RUGS OR MATS      [Illustration: _Silkoline rug with three white stripes_]    [Sidenote: _Plain rug with end stripes_]    [Sidenote: _Finishing the ends_]    Silkoline rugs or mats are by far the prettiest for doll-house use. The  method of preparing the strips is explained under Materials (page 51).  Make the warp with twine of the same color as the silkoline. It should  be a three-eighths-inch warp. Choose a plain color for the body of the  rug, and a short distance from each end weave several stripes of a  contrasting color. The rug in the illustration is of deep cardinal. The  stripes can be of olive green, black, or any preferred color. Mottled  stripes are also attractive and effective. When the stripes at the foot  are woven, ascertain the distance from the foot piece to the last one.  To know where to commence the first stripe at the head, measure the  distance just found from the head piece down, and mark on both rods by  tying or sewing a colored string to the warp. This helps the child to  understand where the stripe should begin, which he soon learns to  measure for himself; and this training in accuracy and independence is  most excellent. There is nothing better than learning self-reliance, and  the child who has been taught it, is not apt to ask others to do his  examples for him. To learn the manner of making the stripes and spaces  each of the same width, count the loops on the rods (one has to weave  twice across the loom to have one loop on a rod), and have the same  number on each side. Care should be taken not to _twist_ the strips in  weaving. The method of splicing the strips and fastening the warp  strings is explained in Chapter V. The rug may be finished with a wool  or silk fringe of the predominating color, or a fringe of the combined  colors. If desired, it may be left plain, catching the woof strips  together at each end to conceal the warp strings. When a mistake has  been made, run the needle back under the same strings instead of pulling  out what is wrong. It prevents stretching and a destruction of the  material.    [Sidenote: _Mottled rugs made of figured silkoline_]    Mottled rugs are made of figured silkoline. Choose oriental colors, no  matter how gaudy the silkoline may look in the piece. It will have a  beautiful effect when woven. Portieres are pretty made in this way.  These rugs should always be plain--that is, without stripes.    [Illustration: _A mottled rug of figured silkoline, in which the colors  brown, blue, and old gold predominate_]    [Sidenote: _Plain rugs with mottled borders, or mottled rugs with plain  borders_]    Plain rugs with mottled borders, or mottled rugs with plain borders, are  the delight of the children. Adjust the frame for the size required, and  decide how wide the border is to be. It is necessary to have an extra  pair of rods, if one desires a smooth and well-finished"]]]
