In eastern  Mexico, _longipes_ and _verrucipes_ are sympatric in southern Hidalgo,  and _longipes_ is sympatric with _cystignathoides_, _dennisi_, and  _guttilatus_ in southern Tamaulipas. _Syrrhophus cystignathoides_ and  _leprus_ are apparently sympatric in central Veracruz.    Subspecific assignments have been made only when there is evidence of  intergradation. The sympatric occurrence of morphologically similar  species in this genus has led me to adopt a conservative approach to the  degree of difference philosophy. I have therefore recognized all  morphologically distinct allopatric populations as species.        [Illustration: FIG. 21: Generic distributions of _Syrrhophus_         (stipple) and _Tomodactylus_ (hatching). Black areas are zones         of intergeneric sympatry.]    _Syrrhophus_ is closely allied to another Mexican leptodactylid genus,  _Tomodactylus_, which was revised by Dixon (1957), who along with  numerous other authors noted the close relationship between the two  genera. There is an almost complete lack of sympatry between the two  genera; in very few places in Mexico do they coexist (Fig. 21).  _Tomodactylus_ has its greatest diversity in the Cordillera Volcanica  and Sierra Madre del Sur, whereas _Syrrhophus_ reaches its greatest  diversity in the Sierra Madre Oriental and eastern foothills. The  species of both genera are about the same size and presumably have  similar requirements insofar as food, breeding sites, and habitat  selection.    Four cases of intergeneric sympatry are known for the two genera:  1) the Chilpancingo region of Guerrero, 2) the lowlands of Colima and  the mountains just inland in Jalisco, 3) the lowlands of central Nayarit,  and 4) the Sierra Madre Occidental on the Durango-Sinaloan border. The  apparent sympatry in the Chilpancingo region involves four species:  _S. pipilans_, _T. albolabris_, _T. dilatus_, and _T. nitidus_. Of the  four, _T. dilatus_ appears to be completely allopatric in that it occurs  at higher altitudes (above 2000 meters), whereas the other three occur  below 1800 meters in the region (Davis and Dixon, 1965). In the  Colima-Jalisco region, _Tomodactylus_ tends to occur higher (Dixon and  Webb, 1966) than some of the _Syrrhophus_, but one subspecies of  _Tomodactylus nitidus_ is a lowland frog, occurring sympatrically with  the lowland _Syrrhophus modestus_. A similar situation is observed in  Nayarit; the lowland _Tomodactylus_ occurs sympatrically with the small  _Syrrhophus pallidus_. In both cases the _Syrrhophus_ is smaller than  the _Tomodactylus_.        [Illustration: FIG. 22: Altitudinal distributions of _Syrrhophus_         and _Tomodactylus_. Widths of the columns are proportional to the         numbers of species at a given altitude; narrowest width equals one         species.]    Frogs of the genus _Syrrhophus_ tend to occur at lower elevations than  do their close relatives of the genus _Tomodactylus_ (Fig. 22). This  generalization is complicated by the occurrence in the Sierra Madre  Oriental in relatively high altitude _Syrrhophus_ (up to 2000 m.) and  the occurrence in Michoacan of low altitude _Tomodactylus_ (to sea  level). There are no _Tomodactylus_ in the Sierra Madre Oriental,  whereas the genus _Syrrhophus_ is represented in the lowlands of western  Mexico (_modestus_ group). _Syrrhophus_ and _Tomodactylus_ exhibit  essentially parapatric distributions. The two genera as now composed can  be characterized as low to moderate elevation frogs (_Syrrhophus_) and  moderate to intermediate elevation frogs (_Tomodactylus_).

A great storm came down upon the ships here. But, marvelous to relate,  the fiery body of good St. Anselmo or Anseline \"appeared to us, and  immediately the storm ceased.\"    The fleet sailed away again and came to Port St. Julian, the true land  of the giants, of which place our Knight has some very interesting  stories to tell.    [Illustration: The world according to the Ptolemy of 1548.]    The fleet entered the Port of St. Julian. It was winter, and for a long  time no human beings appeared.    Suddenly one day a most extraordinary sight met the eyes of some of the  adventurers. Our Knight's description of this being is very vivid. He  says:    \"One day, without any one's expecting it, we saw a giant who was on the  shore of the sea, quite naked, and was dancing and leaping and singing,  and, while singing, he put sand and dust on his head.\" The Captain of  one of the ships, who first saw this extraordinary creature, said to one  of the sailors:    \"Go and meet him. He dances and sings as a sign of friendship. You must  do the same. Beckon him to me.\"    The Captain himself was on a little island.    The scene that followed must have been comical indeed.    The giant danced and sung and sprinkled his head with sand. The sailor  did the same, danced and sang, and the two approached each other.    So the giant was made to think that he was among friends. The sailor led  him on to the island, where he met the Captain.    But the lively giant now began to be afraid in the presence of a new  people. He seemed to wish to ask them who they were and whence they  came. Then an answer to this question came to him. He looked up to the  sky and pointed upward with one finger, saying by signs:    \"Did you come down from Heaven?\"    \"He was so tall,\" says our descriptive Knight, \"that the tallest of us  only came up to his waist.\" He was probably hardly taller than many of  his race. Falkner, in his account of Patagonia (1774), says that he saw  men there seven feet and a half high.    Of this dancing giant our historian gives a further description in  lively and interesting colors:    \"He had a large face painted red all around, and around his eyes were  rings of yellow, and he had two hearts painted on his cheeks. He had but  little hair on the top of his head, which was painted white.    \"When he was brought before the Captain, he had thrown over him the  skin of a certain beast, which skin was very carefully sewed.\"    [Illustration: The dancing giant.]    The skin was that of a guanaco, a kind of llama.    Our historian thus describes the guanaco:    \"This beast has its head and ears of the size of a mule, and the neck  and body of the fashion of a camel, the legs of a deer, and the tail of  a horse, and it neighs like a horse. There are great numbers of these  animals in the same place.\"    Patagonia is the land of these strange animals, which are still found  there, and are hunted by Indians who lie upon the ground with drawn  bows. The animal has great curiosity, and he draws near this living  snare and is killed. When tame he is an interesting companion, but if  angered he suddenly emits a great quantity of offensive liquid from his  nose, like a half bucket of water, which he throws upon the offender. He  is the South American camel.    This giant when he made himself ready to meet the adventurers had shoes  of leather or skins, and carried a bow made of the \"gut of a beast\" and  a bundle of cane arrows feathered, at the end of which were small white  stones.    \"The Captain caused food and drink to be given to him.    \"Then the crew began to show him some of the presents they had brought,  among them a looking-glass.\"    When the giant saw himself in the glass he was filled with wonder. It  was as though his own ghost had appeared to him. There were men behind  him curious to see how he would be affected. He leaped back with such  force as to tumble them over. They were but pigmies to him.    The Captain now gave the giant two bells, a mirror, a comb, and beads,  and sent him back to the shore.    One of the giants of the country saw him coming back, ran to the  habitation of the giants, and summoned the giant people to the shore to  meet him. They came, almost naked, leaping and singing, and pointing  upward to Heaven. What a sight it must have been!    The women were laden with goods. The sailors beckoned them to the ships  to trade.    Queerly enough, the women brought with them a baby or little guanaco,  which they led by a string. Our historian learned that when these giants  wished to capture the old guanacos or camels they fastened one of the  little guanacos to a bush, and the old ones came to the bush to play  with it, and so became an easy prey.    \"Six days afterward, our people going to cut wood,\" writes the Knight,  \"saw another giant, who raised his hands toward Heaven.    \"When the Captain General came to know of it, he sent to fetch him with  his ship's boat, and brought him to one of the little islands in the  port. This giant was of a better disposition than the other, and was a  gracious and amiable person, he loved to dance and leap. When he leaped,  he caused the earth to sink to a palm's depth at the place where his  feet touched.\"    The good giant remained for a time with the adventurers. They gave him  the name of John. They learned him to pronounce the name of Jesus.    \"Say Pater Noster,\" said they.    \"Pater Noster,\" said the giant.    \"Say Ave Maria,\" said the men.    \"Ave Maria,\" said the susceptible giant.    They made him presents when he went away, among them some of the many  tinkling bells.    \"We must capture some of these people,\" said the Captain, \"and take them  to Spain for wonders.\"    So the explorers began to study how to secure some interesting specimens  of these tall people, to excite the wonder of the people of Spain.          CHAPTER XI.    CAPTURING A GIANT.--MAGELLAN'S DECISION.      The attempts to capture wild giants greatly interested Pigafetta.    Our historian says that it was \"done by gentle and cunning means, for  otherwise they would have done a hurt to some of our men.\"    One day some sailors saw four giants hidden in some bushes, and they  were unarmed. They brought these into the power of the Captain. Two of  them were young, and such as would excite admiration anywhere for their  noble development.    They gave these two lusty young Herculeses as many knives, mirrors,  bells, and trinkets as they could hold in their hands, and while the  delighted youths were thus abounding in riches, the Captain said:    \"Now show them the iron fetters.\"    The two youths could but wonder at these when they were brought.    The Captain ordered that the fetters be presented to them.    But their hands were already full. What could they do with them? Where  could they put them?    The Captain signified to them that he would ornament their feet with the  fetters. To this they consented.    So the fetters were put on the feet of each of them, like necklaces or  rings, but when the young giants saw a blacksmith bring a hammer and  rivet the fetters, they began to be distrustful and presently greatly  agitated. They tried to walk, but they could not move.    Our historian thus describes their fury when they saw that they were  helplessly bound:    \"Nevertheless when they saw the trick which had been played on them they  began to be enraged, and to foam like bulls, crying out to the _devil_  to help them.\" We do not see why our Knight should have taken this view  of the case; we would think that two human beings who had been so  treacherously deceived, might have been regarded as appealing to the  Deity of justice.    \"The hands of the other two giants were bound,\" says the original  narrative, \"but it was with great difficulty; then the Captain sent them  back on shore, with nine of his men to conduct them, and to bring the  wife of one of those who had remained in irons, because he regretted her  greatly.\" This last touch gives us a very favorable view of this young  giant.    But on being conducted away, one of the two giants who were to be  liberated, untied his hands and escaped. As soon as he found that he was  free, his feet were picked up nimbly indeed. He flew, as it were, his  long strides leaving his late captors far behind him. He had no heart to  trust Europeans again. He rushed to his native town, but he found only  the women there, who must have been greatly alarmed; the men had gone to  hunt.    He rushed after the hunters to tell them how his companions had been  betrayed.    What became of the other giant whose hands were bound? He struggled,  too, to break the cords, seeing which, one of the men struck him on the  head. He became quiet when he saw that he was helpless, and led the men  to the giant's town where the women and children were.    The men concluded to pass the night there, as it was near night and  everything there looked harmless and inviting.    But during the night the other giant who had gone to meet the hunters  returned with his companions. These saw the bruised head of the giant  who had also been bound, and warned the women who began to run. We are  told that the youngest \"ran faster than the biggest\" and that the men  \"ran faster than horses,\" at which we can not wonder. The fleeing giant  shot one of the men from the ships, and he was buried there on shore.  The poor giant in irons who had lamented for his wife probably never  saw the giantess again.    The methods of treating sickness in the town of the giants were curious.  For an emetic one ran a stick down his throat. For a headache, one cut a  gash on the forehead, not unlike the old method of bleeding. The  philosophy of this latter treatment was interesting-"]]]
