To all animals, whether wild or domesticated, fresh-spilt blood has a  significance that can never be disregarded. It indicates suffering and  death. Ever since, in far distant years, blood first welled from a  stricken creature's wounds, Nature has been haunted by the grim presence  of Fear. The hunting weasel, coming unexpectedly to a pool of blood,  whence a wounded rabbit has crawled away to die in the nearest burrow,  opens mouth and nostrils wide to inhale with fierce delight the pungent  odour. Once I caught sight of a weasel under such circumstances, and was  startled by the almost demon-like look of ferocity on the creature's  face.    But the hunted weaklings of the fields and woods read the signs of death  with consternation. When the scent of the slayer is mingled with that of  the victim it is noted with care, and, if often detected in similar  conditions, is committed to memory as inseparable from danger.    Brighteye had been repeatedly warned by his mother to avoid the presence  of man, and had also learned to fear it because of his experiences with  the angler and the trout. Alarmed at the approach of men and hounds, he  waded out, swam straight up-stream to a tiny bay, and hid beneath a  willow-root to wait till the danger had passed. He strained his ears to  catch each different sound as the \"thud, thud\" and the patter of feet  came nearer. Then the gravel rattled, a stone fell into the stream, and  a shaggy spaniel poked his nose into a hole between the willow-roots.  The dog drew a long, noisy breath, and barked so suddenly and loudly,  and so close to Brighteye's ear, that the vole involuntarily leaped  from his resting place.    In full view of the spaniel, Brighteye passed deep down into the clear,  unruffled pool, hurriedly using every limb, instead of only his  hind-legs, and with quick strokes gained the edge of the current, where  for an instant he rose to breathe before plunging deep once more and  continuing his journey towards the willows on the opposite bank. As he  dived for the second time, Bob saw him among the ripples, and with  shrill voice headed the clamouring hounds, that, \"harking forward\" to  his cry, rushed headlong in pursuit through shallow and pool. A stout,  lichen-covered branch, weighed down at the river's edge by a mass of  herbage borne thither by a recent heavy flood, occupied a corner in the  dense shadow of an alder; and the vole, climbing out of the water, sat  on it, and was hidden completely by the darkness from the eager hounds.  But his sanctuary was soon invaded; the indefatigable terrier, guided by  the tiny bubbles of scent borne down by the stream, left the river, and  ran, whimpering with excitement, straight to the alder. Brighteye saw  him approach, dived silently, and, with a wisdom he had never gained  from experience, turned in a direction quite contrary to that in which  the terrier expected him to flee. The vole moved slowly, right beneath  the dark form of the terrier now swimming in the backwater. On, on, he  went, past the stakes at the outlet of the pool into the trout-reach,  and still on, by a series of dives, each following a brief interval for  breath and observation among the sheltering weeds, till he arrived at  the pool above the cottage gardens, where a wide fringe of brushwood  formed an impenetrable thicket and he was safe from his pursuers.    Hardly, however, was this long journey needed. The dog was baffled at  the outset; and, casting about for the lost scent, he discovered, on the  pebbles, the strong smell of the weasel that had wandered thither to  quench his thirst while Brighteye was feeding in the reed-bed opposite.  Bob never by any chance neglected the opportunity of killing a stoat or  a weasel; so, abandoning all thoughts of rats and voles, he dashed  upward through the wood, and, almost immediately closing on his prey,  destroyed a bloodthirsty little tyrant that, unknown to Brighteye, had  just been planning a raid on the burrow by the willow-stoles.    Water-voles, as a rule, are silent little creatures; unless attacked or  frightened they seldom squeak as they move in and out of the lush  herbage by the riverside. But Brighteye was undoubtedly different from  his fellows: he was almost as noisy as a shrew in the dead leaves of a  tangled hedgerow, and his voice was like a shrew's, high-pitched and  continuous, but louder, so that I could hear him at some distance from  his favourite resort in the reeds and the rushes by the willows. He  seemed to be always talking to himself or to the flowers and the river  as he wandered to and fro in search of tit-bits; always debating with  himself as to the chances of finding a tempting delicacy; always  querulous of danger from some ravenous tyrant that might surprise him in  his burrow, or pounce on him unawares from the evening sky, or rise,  swift, relentless, eager, from the depths beneath him as he swam across  the pool.    When I got to know him well, my favourite method, in learning of his  ways, was to lie in wait at a spot commanding a view of one or other of  the narrow lanes joining the main road of the riverside folk, and there,  my face hidden by a convenient screen of interlacing grass-stems, to  listen intently for his approach. Generally, for five minutes or so  before he chose to reach my hiding place, I could hear his shrill  piping, now faint and intercepted by a mound, or indistinct and mingled  with the swirl of the water around the stakes, then full and clear as he  gained the summit of a stone or ridge and came down the winding path  towards me. Though in his talkative moments Brighteye usually reminded  me of the tiny shrew, there were times when he reminded me more forcibly  of an eccentric mouse that, a few years before, had taken up her  quarters in the wall of my study, and each night, for more than a week,  when the children's hour was over and I sat in silence by my shaded  lamp, had made her presence known by a bird-like solo interrupted only  when the singer stayed to pick up a crumb on her way across the room.    The times when Brighteye wandered, singing, singing, down the lanes and  main road of the river-bank, were, however, infrequent; and the surest  sign of his approach, before he came in sight, was the continuous,  gossiping twitter I have already described. This habit of singing and  twittering was not connected with amorous sentiments towards any sleek  young female; Brighteye adopted it long before he was of an age to seek  a mate, and he ceased practising his solos before the first winter set  in and the morning sun glanced between leafless trees on a dark flood  swirling over the reed-bed where in summer was his favourite feeding  place.    Whether or not the other voles frequenting the burrow by the willows had  shown their disapproval of such a habit I was never able to discover.  One fact, however, seemed significant: Brighteye parted from his parents  as soon as he was sufficiently alert and industrious to manage his own  affairs, and, having hollowed out a plain, one-roomed dwelling, with an  exit under the surface of the water and another near some primrose-roots  above the level of flood, lived there for months, timid and lonely, yet  withal, if his singing might be regarded as the sign of a gladsome life,  the happiest vole in the shadowed pool above the village gardens.    It has been supposed by certain naturalists that the song of the  house-mouse is the result of a disease in its throat, and is therefore a  precursor of death. The mouse that came to my study ceased her visits  soon after the week had passed and was never seen again; and I was  unable to determine how her end was hastened. Brighteye could not, at  any rate, have suffered seriously, else he would have succumbed, either  to some enemy ever ready to prey on the young, the aged, the sick, and  the wounded of his tribe, or to starvation, the well-nigh inevitable  follower of disease in animals. He always seemed to me to be full of  vitality and happiness, as if the dangers besetting his life only  provided him with wholesome excitement, and sharpened his intellect far  more finely than that of the rest of his tribe.          III.    WILD HUNTING.      Once, during the first summer of the water-vole's life, I saw as pretty  a bit of wild hunting as I have ever witnessed, and my pleasure was  enhanced by the fact that the quarry escaped unharmed. Early in the  afternoon, instead of during twilight, I, in company with the members of  the village Hunt and their mongrel pack, had searched the stream and its  banks for rats, and had enjoyed good sport. Suddenly, however, our  ragamuffin hounds struck the line of nobler game: Lutra, the otter, was  astir in the pool.    I was not surprised, for on the previous night, long after the moon had  risen and sleep had descended on the village, I, with Ianto the  fisherman, had passed the spot on returning from an angling expedition  eight or ten miles up-stream, and had stayed awhile to watch the most  expert of all river-fishers, as she dived and swam from bank to bank,  and sometimes, turning swiftly into the backwater, landed on the shingle  close by Brighteye's reed-bed, to devour at leisure a captured trout.    Lutra soon baffled our inexpert hounds, and gained refuge in a \"strong  place\" well behind a fringe of alder-roots, whence Bob, notwithstanding  his most strenuous efforts, failed to \"bolt\" her. I then drew off the  hounds, led them towards the throat of the pool, and for a half hour  assisted them to work the \"stale drag,\" till I reached a bend of the  river where Lutra's footprints were still visible on the fine, wet sand  at the brink of a rapid.    Later, when the dogs were quietly resting at their homes, I returned,  alone, to my hiding place not far from Lutra's \"holt.\" As long as  daylight lasted I saw nothing of vole or otter, though several brown"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29362"],[0,"The Goat-gland Transplantation (#10)"],[1,"lands, if he took the operation.    On Saturday, April 16. 1921, Dr. Brinkley operated on him at the  hospital, Milford, Kansas, transplanting the glands of a three-weeks old  male goat. He remained in bed Saturday and Sunday, got up and went for  an auto drive on Monday, and passed an uneventful week at the hospital,  returning to Chicago on Saturday. He experienced a marked increase in  mental energy, which might have shown itself also as increased physical  energy if it had been put to the test. This feeling of added pep, snap,  energy, or what you please to call it, could be psychological in its  origin if it were not for the fact that it is continuous, with no  set-backs. Every student of psychology is aware that auto-suggestion has  the power to bring out latent energy, raise the drooping spirits, and  generate a feeling of well-being. But the student, if he is a reasonably  close observer, is also aware that these improved states of feeling have  an annoying habit of being offset by corresponding periods of  depression, and though he may persist in his effort to lift himself out  of the black moods with such success that he finally arrives at a higher  tone-level mentally, with a corresponding physical improvement, there is  indubitably a strong sense of effort needed for this good result. When,  therefore, the writer finds himself working long hours day after day  with no sense of mental fatigue, but a certain unusual gaiety of heart  accompanying the successive days, as if life were on the whole rather a  lark, he, being accurately introspective, and not easily deceived into  optimistic conclusions, is forced to give the whole credit for this  change of spirit to the functioning of the new glands, and he is  confirmed in this conclusion by the fact that the high blood pressure,  which was noticeable enough before the operation, cannot now, ten days  after the operation, be detected by him at all. Ten days is all too  short a time in which to write of details in a matter of this  importance. He expects to be able to confirm improvement in eyesight by  the middle of May, and will be in a position to speak at greater length  on the matter after the summer has passed. The intent of this chapter is  to give a brief account of something he saw at Dr. Brinkley's hospital  during the week of his treatment.    Two weeks before his arrival a man suffering from locomotor ataxia had  been carried in, unable to help himself at all. When the writer saw this  man and talked with him he was up and dressed and walking about, without  a cane, and he left for home after a total stay of something less than  three weeks. In parting from him the doctor said, \"You are on the  high-road to complete recovery. I expect to hear that you are getting  stronger every day. Practice in walking will bring back to you the old  confidence and banish the helpless feeling that you are sure to fall.  You see that you can control the motions of your feet and legs now as  you could not before. Sensation has returned to the soles of your feet,  and you can now turn yourself over in bed, which you could not do before  without assistance. This means that the brain, spinal cord, muscles and  will are co-ordinating again. This means that the goat-glands are  actively working, dissolving scar-tissue, and bringing you back to  health. But it is asking a good deal of a pair of goat-glands to do as  much as they must do in your case to bring about complete recovery.  I would rather give them some extra assistance. If you will come back to  me, therefore, next Fall, to this hospital, I will put two new  goat-glands into you; and I believe that with this extra help you will  go right through to a complete cure without any trouble. The operation  will not cost you a cent. I am anxious only to complete the good work.  I may be wrong at that, and it is possible that the glands you have now  will be enough to do the work, but if they do not, come back here for  two more next Fall. Don't forget.\"    This man had been everywhere for relief, and had taken every treatment  known for his disease, with no results whatever, as he told the writer.  \"This is the first time for twelve years,\" he said, \"that I have had any  feeling in my feet. I am surely going to get well at last.\"    In another case of the same disease the patient, when he came to the  hospital, was taking morphine daily to relieve the lightning-pains. He  could not stand upright with his eyes shut without falling, and if  spoken to suddenly was likely to lose his balance and fall. He had not  walked without a cane for several years. Twenty-four hours after the  goat-gland operation he said that the pains had left him, and  voluntarily stopped the morphine. In two weeks he was walking five miles  before breakfast, without a cane to help him. He left the hospital a  cured man. There has never been a case of true locomotor ataxia cured by  any means whatever, in the history of man, until this Kansas surgeon,  Dr. Brinkley, found the cure for it in this transplantation of  goat-glands. Ataxia is an after-math of syphilis, in ninety-nine cases  out of a hundred, and it is a question, which no layman can solve,  whether the cause of the ataxia is in the disease, or in the mercurial  treatment used to combat the disease. Another age, following this, may  decide that the disease, syphilis, is less destructive of human tissue  than the cure, Mercury. However that may be, the fact remains that  goat-glands will cure Locomotor Ataxia, and they are apparently the only  means of cure hitherto discovered.    The writer talked with some of the townspeople of Milford regarding Dr.  Brinkley's work. Their attitude was detached, but on the whole  affirmative. They could not, as they put it, doubt their own eyesight,  implying that they would do so if they could. They had seen case after  case carried into the hospital, and they had seen those same people walk  out and go their way to their homes. It was queer, they said, and wagged  a critical head. So true is it in all parts of the earth that a prophet  hath honor save in his own country! Here and there, however, the writer  found a townsman who had nothing but words of praise and admiration for  Dr. Brinkley's work. These always proved to be people who had had some  relative under Dr. Brinkley's care at the hospital, and they were  intelligent men who could give their reasons for their conclusions. They  were proud of the lustre which Dr. Brinkley's Goat-Gland work was  shedding upon the name of their village. Most of the townspeople,  however, seemed to think that Dr. Brinkley should be proud of the town.  Their engaging surliness of demeanor with regard to the miracles being  performed in their village was a fascinating study to a city man, who  saw here at its best the typical small-town attitude towards the big  local thing. It is not peculiar to Milford. It is universal. It is as  true in England and France and Belgium and Germany as in any little town  in the United States. What do you suppose the country villagers thought  of Fabre, the great French naturalist, probably to be hailed by the next  generation as the greatest figure since Darwin? Without doubt they  thought him mad, and if kindly, pitied him, or if savage, despised him.  Meanwhile it is quite certain that the work of Dr. Brinkley has put the  town of Milford, Kansas, on the map, and, if you do not find it on the  railroad map you may some day consult, it will help a little to say here  that you go from Kansas City, Missouri, by the Union Pacific Railroad to  Junction City, Kansas, and from that point change to a little branch  line which carries you to Milford. The depot at Milford is about a mile  from the village itself. You will find an auto at the depot which will  carry you to the hospital, where you will be met by Dr. or Mrs.  Brinkley, or Miss Lewis, the Head Nurse, and where you will be very  comfortable if you decide to make a stay of a week or so for personal  reasons. The food is good, and the Kansas air fresh and bracing and  plentiful. Winds are indeed common, but the village is safely out of the  track of the Kansas cyclones, and the storm cellar is unknown. The  hospital is spotlessly clean and a marvel of completeness in equipment.  The preparations for the gland transplantation are simple but thorough;  a test of spermatic fluid, a blood test, a test for blood pressure,  a blood count, and a purgative the night before the operation, with no  breakfast on the morning of the operation. You will eat a good lunch in  bed, however, on that day, and miss no meals afterwards. Briefly, the  writer can say honestly that the pain of the operation is no more than  the twinge of a toothache.          CHAPTER IX    SUMMARY      Dr. Brinkley's employment of the goat-glands for the past three years of  continuous operating, therefore, has proved to his satisfaction and to  that of his patients that the testes in men and the ovaries in women  furnish a secretion which has the property of a revivifying fluid when  restored to the system by the currents of blood and lymph. In that  commonly fatal condition of the arteries which follows rapidly upon the  state of blood pressure known as hardening of the arteries, or  arterio-sclerosis, a practically incurable condition hitherto, the  results obtained by the goat-gland transplantation are miraculously  swift. When the arteries are, as the doctor puts it, \"as hard as  pipe-stems,\" they grow in a few weeks, sometimes in a week, soft and  pliable. The change, according to Dr. Brinkley, is brought about in the  walls of the arteries themselves, and is not a process of dissolving the  accumulations or deposits of calcareous material within the arteries.  The change is in the material of the walls of the arteries, producing a  return of the condition of elasticity, permitting expansion and  contraction as in youth.    It is a favorite theory with"]]]
