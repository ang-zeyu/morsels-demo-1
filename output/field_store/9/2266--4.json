But I would reply, that old men are       boys twice over, and that it is the more reasonable that       the old should weep than the young, inasmuch as it is       less just that they should err.         Strep. It is nowhere ordained by law that a father       should suffer this.         Phid. Was it not then a man like you and me, who first       proposed this law, and by speaking persuaded the       ancients? Why then is it less lawful for me also in turn       to propose henceforth a new law for the sons, that they       should beat their fathers in turn? But as many blows as       we received before the law was made, we remit: and we       concede to them our having been thrashed without return.       Observe the cocks and these other animals, how they       punish their fathers; and yet, in what do they differ       from us, except that they do not write decrees?         Strep. Why then, since you imitate the cocks in all       things, do you not both eat dung and sleep on a perch?         Phid. It is not the same thing, my friend; nor would it       appear so to Socrates.         Strep. Therefore do not beat me; otherwise you will one       day blame yourself.         Phid. Why, how?         Strep. Since I am justly entitled to chastise you; and       you to chastise your son, if you should have one.         Phid. But if I should not have one, I shall have wept       for nothing, and you will die laughing at me.         Strep. To me, indeed, O comrades, he seems to speak       justly; and I think we ought to concede to them what is       fitting. For it is proper that we should weep, if we do       not act justly.         Phid. Consider still another maxim.         Strep. No; for I shall perish if I do.         Phid. And yet perhaps you will not be vexed at suffering       what you now suffer.         Strep. How, pray? For inform me what good you will do me       by this.         Phid. I will beat my mother, just as I have you.         Strep. What do you say? What do you say? This other,       again, is a greater wickedness.         Phid. But what if, having the worst Cause, I shall       conquer you in arguing, proving that it is right to beat       one's mother?         Strep. Most assuredly, if you do this, nothing will       hinder you from casting yourself and your Worse Cause       into the pit along with Socrates. These evils have I       suffered through you, O Clouds! Having intrusted all my       affairs to you.         Cho. Nay, rather, you are yourself  the cause of these       things, having turned yourself to wicked courses.         Strep. Why, pray, did you not tell me this, then, but       excited with hopes a rustic and aged man?         Cho. We always do this to him whom we perceive to be a       lover of wicked courses, until we precipitate him into       misfortune, so that he may learn to fear the gods.         Strep. Ah me! it is severe, O Clouds! But it is just;       for I ought not to have withheld the money which I       borrowed. Now, therefore, come with me, my dearest son,       that you may destroy the blackguard Chaerephon and       Socrates, who deceived you and me.         Phid. I will not injure my teachers.         Strep. Yes, yes, reverence Paternal Jove.         Phid. \"Paternal Jove\" quoth'a! How antiquated you are!       Why, is there any Jove?         Strep. There is.         Phid. There is not, no; for Vortex reigns having       expelled Jupiter.         Strep. He has not expelled him; but I fancied this, on       account of this Vortex here. Ah me, unhappy man! When I       even took you who are of earthenware for a god.         Phid. Here rave and babble to yourself.         [Exit Phidippides]         Strep. Ah me, what madness! How mad, then, I was when I       ejected the gods on account of Socrates! But O dear       Hermes, by no means be wroth with me, nor destroy me;       but pardon me, since I have gone crazy through prating.       And become my adviser, whether I shall bring an action       and prosecute them, or whatever you think. You advise me       rightly, not permitting me to get up a lawsuit, but as       soon as possible to set fire to the house of the prating       fellows. Come hither, come hither, Xanthias! Come forth       with a ladder and with a mattock and then mount upon the       thinking-shop and dig down the roof, if you love your       master, until you tumble the house upon them.         [Xanthias mounts upon the roof]         But let some one bring me a lighted torch and I'll make       some of them this day suffer punishment, even if they be       ever so much impostors.         1st Dis. (from within) Hollo! Hollo!         Strep. It is your business, O torch, to send forth       abundant flame.         [Mounts upon the roof]         1st Dis. What are you doing, fellow?         Strep. What am I doing? Why, what else, than chopping       logic with the beams of your house?         [Sets the house on fire]         2nd Dis. (from within) You will destroy us! You will       destroy us!         Strep. For I also wish this very thing; unless my       mattock deceive my hopes, or I should somehow fall first       and break my neck.         Soc. (from within). Hollo you! What are you doing, pray,       you fellow on the roof?         Strep. I am walking on air, and speculating about the       sun.         Soc. Ah me, unhappy! I shall be suffocated, wretched       man!         Chaer. And I, miserable man, shall be burnt to death!         Strep. For what has come into your heads that you acted       insolently toward the gods, and pried into the seat of       the moon? Chase, pelt, smite them, for many reasons, but       especially because you know that they offended against       the gods!         [The thinking shop is burned down]         Cho. Lead the way out; for we have sufficiently acted as       chorus for today.             [Exeunt omnes]"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2563"],[0,"Memoirs of the Comtesse Du Barry (#10)"],[1," Fronsac was justly hated by his father; he was what is called  a decided scamp, without one redeeming point or virtue. Dissipated  without agreeableness, a courtier without address, a soldier without  courage, he thoroughly deserved his bad reputation. He was not hated,  because hatred implies a species of honor, but he was universally  despised. His father hated him; he hated his father. The reciprocity was  edifying. I have often seen the duc de Fronsac, and always with disgust.  He had incurred the extremity of punishment; when trying to carry off a  butcher's daughter, he rendered himself guilty of the triple crimes of  arson, rape, and robbery. This was the most splendid deed of his life,  at least his father said so, the only one in which he had shown--guess  what for, my friend, I will not pen the cynical word made use of by his  father. It must be confessed that we sometimes kept very bad company at  Versailles. The king, who abhorred degrading actions, did not like  the duc de Fronsac, but was full of kindly feeling towards the duc  d'Aiguillon. The latter experienced the extent of his favor in his  long and obstinate struggle with the parliament of Bretagne. It must be  owned, that if he gained the victory at court, he decidedly lost it in  the city, and I was publicly insulted on this account in the most brutal  manner. However, the friendship which his first interview inspired me  with, I have always preserved unaltered.    The week glided away, and each day my fortune seemed more fully assured.  The love of the king increased, he heaped presents on me perpetually,  and seemed to think he never could do enough for me. The bounties of  Louis XV were known, and instantly aroused against me the two enemies  with whom I had been threatened--the duc de Choiseul and the duchesse de  Grammont, his sister. I must say, however, that, at first, the brother  contented himself with despising me, but the duchesse was furious; I had  offended her feminine self-love, and she could not forgive me. I have  told you that she obtained possession of the king by stratagem. This is  fact. She was in a place of concealment during a regal debauch, and when  Louis left the table, with his head heated by wine, she awaited him in  his bed to commit a sort of violence on him. What curious ambition! As  soon as this noble lady learned my position, she was desirous of knowing  who I was, and I have been told since all the measures she took to learn  this. She did not confine her search to the circle of Versailles, but  hastened to prosecute her inquiries in Paris with M. de Sartines. The  lieutenant of police not suspecting the favor that awaited me, as well  as that which I already enjoyed, and on the other hand persuaded of that  of the Choiseul family, set all his bloodhounds on my traces. They did  not fail to bring him back a thousand horrible tales about me, with  which he gratified the duchesse, who, thinking thereby to do me a severe  injury, spread in the chateau a multitude of prejudicial tales against  me, hoping that they would reach the ears of the king and disgust him  with his amour. It was at this juncture that appeared in the \"_Nouvelles  a la Main_\" those infamous articles, collected in what they call the  Collection of Bachaumont. From the same source proceeded the songs _a la  Bourbonnaise_ which filled Paris, and were sung about everywhere. These  scandals produced no other effect than increasing the attachment which  the king had for me, and to diminish that which he felt for the duc de  Choiseul.    Passion never reasons; if it had common sense, it would perceive that it  cannot disgust a lover by vilifying his mistress, but, on the contrary,  interests his self-love in supporting her. Thus all these intrigues  scathed me not; I did not mention to my counsellor comte Jean an insult  which I met with in the park at Versailles from madame de Grammont. I  did not tell it to the king, not wishing to create any disturbance  at court. I avenged myself by myself, and think I conducted myself  remarkably well in this adventure, which was as follows:    I was walking in the garden with Henriette, who had given me her arm;  it was early in the morning, and the walks appeared solitary. We walked  towards towards the side of the Ile d'Amour, when we heard the steps of  two persons who came behind us. Henriette turned her head and then said  to me, \"Here are mesdames de Brionne and de Grammont.\" I knew the latter  but very slightly, and the former not at all. Certainly she could not  have been there by chance; they knew I should be there, and wished to  see me closely. Not suspecting what was to follow, I was delighted at  the rencontre. They passed us with head erect, haughty air; looked at  me with a disdainful stare, laughed rudely and walked away. Altho' such  behavior offended me, it did not put me out of humor; I thought it very  natural for madame de Grammont to be irritated against me. Henriette had  less magnanimity. She repeated so often how impertinent it was thus to  insult a female honored by the bounties of the king, and so far excited  my feelings, that instead of returning as prudence suggested, I followed  the steps of these ladies. I did not proceed far before I rejoined  them; they were seated on a bench, awaiting my arrival as it appeared.  I passed close to them, and at that moment the duchesse de Grammont,  raising her voice, said,    \"It must be a profitable business to sleep with every body.\"    I was excessively nettled, and instantly retorted, \"At least I cannot  be accused of making a forcible entry into any person's bed.\" The arrow  went to the mark and penetrated deeply. The whole countenance of the  duchesse turned pale, except her lips, which became blue. She would have  said something foolish, but madame de Brionne, more cool because touched  less nearly, placed her hand over her companion's mouth. I in my turn  walked away with Henriette, laughing till tears came into my eyes at  this pleasing victory.    The duchesse de Grammont, who had no further inclination to laugh, told  the whole to her brother. He, who loved her excessively, too much so  perhaps, reprimanded her, nevertheless, and pointed out to her the  disadvantage in an open struggle with me. Madame de Brionne was enjoined  to secrecy, but that did not prevent her from confiding the affair to  the dowager duchesse d'Aiguillon.    This latter was a lady of most superior merit, uniting to much wit more  solid acquirements. She spoke English like a native. Her death, which  happened in 1772, was a great misfortune to her son, to whom she  gave the most excellent counsel. She told my adventure to her  daughter-in-law, who, excessively ambitious, saw, without any pain,  the increasing attachment of her husband for me. I must tell you, in a  parenthesis, that I always lived on the best terms with her, and that,  in my disgrace, her friendship did not weaken. I must do her this  justice. All my _faithful friends_ have not been equally faithful  towards me.    These two ladies knowing this occurrence, the duc d'Aiguillon was not  long kept in ignorance that something had happened. He came in haste to  see me, and inquired what it was. But he asked in vain, I would not tell  him. My secrecy hurt him, and on his return home he wrote to me. As  I have great pleasure in telling you all that recalls this amiable  gentleman to my mind, I will transcribe his letter, which will give you  an opportunity of judging of the turn of his mind.    _I am very unhappy, madame. I had flattered myself with having obtained  your confidence, but the obstinate silence which you have kept with  me has cruelly informed me of my mistake. Allow the deep interest with  which you have inspired me to offer a suggestion. You know nothing of  forms, you are unacquainted with our usages: you require a friend who  shall direct and counsel you. Why should you not select a man entirely  devoted to you, and as equally so to the king, the king whose affections  you possess--and who could refuse them to you? I pause. Nothing is more  dangerous than to use a pen where we have a heart overflowing like mine.  Be more gracious towards me, I ask it of you in charity, and take no  pleasure in driving me to twofold desperation. Adieu, madame, etc._    \"Signed, the Duc D'A.\"    I read and read again this epistle: it delighted me from beginning to  end. I found in it a depth of passion which did not displease me: I  perfectly comprehended the obscurity of the latter phrase. I needed  a sort of mentor superior to comte Jean, and I preferred the duc  d'Aiguillon to any other, because he pleased me. This feeling decided  me, and I replied to him in these terms:--    \"You are wrong, monsieur, to be annoyed, and to think that I am not  disposed to grant you my confidence. It seems to me that I cannot place  myself in better hands. However, we do not know each other well enough  for me to repose in you at once: see me frequently, and then, with the  habit of being in your company, I will allow myself to glide quietly  into that state of confidence which you desire. Yes, I am indeed a  stranger to all that passes around me; my only support is the protection  with which the king honors me. That is all-powerful, but I will not  employ it unseasonably or improperly. I know that I need the counsels  of an honorable, prudent, and well-informed man. I accept, therefore, of  yours; I even ask them from you, if your friendship go along with them.  Adieu, monsieur. My regards are due to your uncle, the marechal, the  first time you write to him.\"    This letter filled the duc d'Aiguillon with joy. Some days afterwards,  the prince de Soubise, who also wished to give me his advice, did not  attain the same success. It must be owned, that, for a man of the world,  he went about it in a very clumsy way. He committed the extreme error of  selecting mademoiselle Guimard as mediatrix between"]]]
