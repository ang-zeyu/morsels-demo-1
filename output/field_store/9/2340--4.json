The soldiers boisterously sang a fine chorus as  they went. No sooner had they finished than the students began their  song. It was all in Latin and seemed to Faust to echo that life which  had once been his. Then the soldiers and students joined in the  jollity and sang together.    This fun lasted what to Faust seemed too long a time. He was impatient  to see and speak with the dear maiden Marguerite; and at last, his  wish was to be granted. The Devil set him down without ceremony in the  young girl's house. There, where she lived, where her meagre  belongings were about, he sang rapturously of her. He went about the  room, looking at her chair, her basket of work, the place where she  should sleep, examining all with rapture. Then the Devil said in an  undertone:    \"She is coming! hide thyself, and frighten her not.\" Then he hid Faust  behind some curtains and took himself off with the parting advice:    \"Have a care not to frighten her, or thou wilt lose her. Now make the  most of thy time.\" Faust's heart beat so with love that he feared to  betray himself.    Then Marguerite entered. She was as lovely as a dream. She was simple  and gentle, and very young and innocent. She had never seen any one  outside her little village. She was so good that she could fairly tell  by instinct if evil influences were about her. She no sooner entered  the chamber than she was aware of something wrong. She felt the  presence of the evil one who had but just gone. She paused and  murmured to herself:    \"The air is very sultry,\" and she felt stifled. \"I am trembling like a  little child. I think it is the dream I had last night\" (for the Devil  had given her a dream as he had given Faust, and in it she had seen  her future husband). \"I think it is because I expect every moment  since my dream, to see the one who is to love and cherish me the rest  of my life.\" The simple folk of Marguerite's time believed in dreams  and portents of all kinds.    There she sat in her chair and recalled how handsome the lover of her  dream was, and how truly she already loved him. Then she decided to go  to bed, and while she was folding her few things, putting her apron  away, combing out her long and beautiful hair, she sang an old Gothic  song, of the King of Thule:    [Music:         There was a king in Thule         Was faithful till the grave       To whom his mistress, dying,         A golden goblet gave.       Naught was to him more precious,         He drained it at ev'ry bout.       His eyes with tears ran over         As oft as he drank thereout.]         When came his time of dying,         The towns in his land he told;       Naught else to his heir denying         Except the goblet of gold.       He sat at the royal banquet,         With his knights of high degree,       In the lofty hall of his fathers,         In the castle by the sea.         There stood the old carouser,         And drank the last life-glow,       And hurled the hallow'd goblet         Into the tide below.       He saw it plunging and filling,         And sinking deep in the sea,       Then his eyelids fell forever,         And never more drank he.         There was a King once in Thule,         Faithful was he--to the grave.    Then the Devil, who was watching all, summoned his imps. This time  they took the form of Will-o'-the-wisps.    \"Come! dance and confuse this maiden, and see what we can do to help  this lovesick Faust,\" he cried to them, and at once they began a  wonderful dance. Marguerite watched them entranced, and by the time  Faust appeared from the folds of the curtains she was half dazed and  confused by the unreal spectacle she had seen. Then she recognized the  handsome fellow as the one she had seen in her dream.    \"I have seen thee in my dreams,\" she said, \"and thou wert one who  loved me well.\" Faust, entranced with her beauty and goodness,  promised to love her forever; and as he embraced her, the Devil  suddenly popped in.    \"Hasten,\" he cried. \"We must be off.\"    \"Who is this man?\" Marguerite cried in affright.    \"A brute,\" Faust declared, knowing well the devilishness of his  pretended friend in whose company he travelled.    \"Nay! I am your best friend. Be more courteous,\" the Devil cautioned,  smiling.    \"I expect I am intruding,\" he continued. \"But really I came to save  this angel of a girl. Our songs have awakened all the neighbours  round, and they are running hither like a pack of hounds to see what  is going on. They know this pretty girl has a young man in here  talking with her, and already they are calling for her old gossip of a  mother. When her mother comes ye will catch it finely. So come along.\"    \"Death and Hell!\" Faust cried, not knowing how near he was to both.    \"There is no time for that. Just come along. You and the young woman  will have plenty of time hereafter to see each other. But just now we  must be off.\"    \"But she----\"    \"It will go hard with her if we are found here, so ye had better come  on, if only for her sake.\"    \"But, return, return,\" Marguerite cried, looking tenderly at Faust.    \"I shall return, never to leave thee,\" he cried, and then, interrupted  by the noise made by men and women in the street, who were coming to  find out what he was doing there, Faust left hurriedly. Every night  thereafter for a time they met, and Marguerite was persuaded by the  Devil to give her old mother a sleeping potion to keep her from  surprising them. Then one day the Devil again lured Faust away.    \"Now thou shalt never see her again,\" the Devil said to himself,  gloating over the sorrow Faust was sure to feel; and away they fled,  the Devil sure of tempting Faust anew.    After that Marguerite, left quite alone, watched sadly, each day for  the return of her lover, but alas! he never came. One night while she  was leaning out of her casement, the villagers were singing of the  return of the army.    \"Alas, they are all making merry, soldiers and students, as on the  night when I first saw my lover, but he is no longer among them.\" And  then sadly she closed her window and kept her lonely vigil, ever  hoping for his return.    Away in a cavern, in the depths of the forest, was Faust. He had never  returned to Marguerite's village, and neither had he known any peace  of mind. He had immediately found other pleasures which had for a  time made him forget her, and then, when he was far away and it was  too late to return, he desired again to be with her. Now, sitting  apart in the wood, mourning, the Devil came to him.    \"How about that constant love of thine? Do ye never think of that poor  child Marguerite, lonely and far away, awaiting thee month after  month?\"    \"Be silent and do not torture me, fiend,\" Faust cried bitterly.    \"Oh I have a lot to tell thee,\" the Black Prince replied. \"I have been  saving news for thee. Dost thou remember how, on those nights when  thou didst go to see that good maiden, she was told to give her old  mother a sleeping draught, that she might sleep soundly while ye  billed and cooed? Well, when ye were gone, Marguerite still expected  ye, and continued to give the draught, and one night the old dame  slept forever, and I tell thee that draught killed her. Now thy  Marguerite is going to be hanged for it.\" Upon hearing that, Faust  nearly died with horror.    \"What is it ye tell me?\" he cried. \"My God! This is not true.\"    \"All right. All right. Believe it or not, it is the same to me--and to  her--because that poor maid is about to die for killing her mother.\"    \"Thou shalt save her, or I shall kill--\" But he stopped in his fury,  knowing that none could kill the Devil. He wrung his hands in despair.    \"Now if thou wilt keep thyself a bit civil, I may save her for thee,  but don't forget thy manners.\"    At that Faust was in a fury of excitement to be off to Marguerite's  village.    \"Not so fast, not so fast,\" the Devil said \"Now if I am to save thy  love, I must have a little agreement with thee. I want your signature  to this paper. Sign, and I promise to save her, without fail. But I  must have that first.\"    \"I will give thee anything,\" Faust cried, and instantly signed the  paper. That paper was really an agreement to give the Devil his soul  when he should die, so Faust had abandoned his last hope on earth or  hereafter. Then the Devil called for his horses--his black horses upon  which damned souls rode with him to Hell.    \"Mount,\" he said to Faust, \"and in a trice we shall be with thy  Marguerite and snatch her from the gallows.\" Instantly they mounted  and then began the fearful ride to Hell.    Presently they came near a crowd of peasants kneeling about a roadside  cross.    \"Oh, have a care. Let us not ride upon them,\" Faust cried.    \"Get on, get on,\" the Devil cried. \"It is thy Marguerite we are  hastening to,\" and the poor peasants scattered in every direction,  some being trampled upon and little children hurt.    \"Horrible, horrible,\" Faust cried. \"What is that monster pursuing us?\"  he whispered, glancing fearfully behind him.    \"Ye are dreaming.\"    \"Nay! and there are hideous birds of prey now joining us. They rush  upon us. What screams? Their black wings strike me.\" And then a bell  tolled.    \"Hark ye! It is the bell for her death. Hasten,\" the Devil urged.    \"Aye, make haste, make haste.\" And the horses, black as night, were  urged on and on. \"See those ghastly skeletons dancing!\" Faust  screamed, as the fearful spectres gathered round them.    \"Think not of them, but of our Marguerite!\" the Devil counselled.    \"Our horses' manes are bristling. They tremble, the earth rocks  wildly. I hear the thunders roar, it is raining blood,\" Faust  shrieked. Then the Devil shouted:    \"Ah! Ye slaves of Hell, your trumpets blow. I come triumphant. This  man is mine!\" And as he spoke, the two riders fell headlong into the  abyss of Hell.    Then all the fiends of Hell began to sing wildly."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2872"],[0,"The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication — Volume 2 (#10)"],[1,"stage of growth, they  would not become irregular. If, moreover, the arrest were to take place at a  still earlier period of development, the result would be a simple tuft of  green leaves; and no one probably would call this a case of reversion. Dr.  Masters designates the cases first alluded to as regular peloria; and others,  in which all the corresponding parts assume a similar form of irregularity, as  when all the petals in a Linaria become spurred, as irregular peloria. We have  no right to attribute these latter cases to reversion, until it can be shown  that the parent-form, for instance, of the genus Linaria had had all its  petals spurred; for a chance of this nature might result from the spreading of  an anomalous structure, in accordance with the law, to be discussed in a  future chapter, of homologous parts tending to vary in the same manner. But as  both forms of peloria frequently occur on the same individual plant of the  Linaria (13/69. Verlot 'Des Varietes' 1865 page 89; Naudin 'Nouvelles Archives  du Museum' tome 1 page 137.), they probably stand in some close relation to  one another. On the doctrine that peloria is simply the result of an arrest of  development, it is difficult to understand how an organ arrested at a very  early period of growth should acquire its full functional perfection;--how a  petal, supposed to be thus arrested, should acquire its brilliant colours, and  serve as an envelope to the flower, or a stamen produce efficient pollen; yet  this occurs with many peloric flowers. That pelorism is not due to mere chance  variability, but either to an arrest of development or to reversion, we may  infer from an observation made by Ch. Morren (13/70. In his discussion on some  curious peloric Calceolarias quoted in 'Journal of Horticulture' February 24,  1863 page 152.) namely, that families which have irregular flowers often  \"return by these monstrous growths to their regular form; whilst we never see  a regular flower realise the structure of an irregular one.\"    Some flowers have almost certainly become more or less completely peloric  through reversion, as the following interesting case shows. Corydalis tuberosa  properly has one of its two nectaries colourless, destitute of nectar, only  half the size of the other, and therefore, to a certain extent, in a  rudimentary state; the pistil is curved towards the perfect nectary, and the  hood, formed of the inner petals, slips off the pistil and stamen in one  direction alone, so that, when a bee sucks the perfect nectary, the stigma and  stamens are exposed and rubbed against the insect's body. In several closely  allied genera, as in Dielytra, etc., there are two perfect nectaries, the  pistil is straight, and the hood slips off on either side, according as the  bee sucks either nectary. Now, I have examined several flowers of Corydalis  tuberosa, in which both nectaries were equally developed and contained nectar;  in this we see only the redevelopment of a partially aborted organ; but with  this redevelopment the pistil becomes straight, and the hood slips off in  either direction, so that these flowers have acquired the perfect structure,  so well adapted for insect agency, of Dielytra and its allies. We cannot  attribute these coadapted modifications to chance, or to correlated  variability; we must attribute them to reversion to a primordial condition of  the species.    The peloric flowers of Pelargonium have their five petals in all respects  alike, and there is no nectary so that they resemble the symmetrical flowers  of the closely allied genus Geranium; but the alternate stamens are also  sometimes destitute of anthers, the shortened filaments being left as  rudiments, and in this respect they resemble the symmetrical flowers of the  closely allied genus Erodium. Hence we may look at the peloric flowers of  Pelargonium as having reverted to the state of some primordial form, the  progenitor of the three closely related genera of Pelargonium, Geranium, and  Erodium.    In the peloric form of Antirrhinum majus, appropriately called the\" Wonder,\"  the tubular and elongated flowers differ wonderfully from those of the common  snapdragon; the calyx and the mouth of the corolla consist of six equal lobes,  and include six equal instead of four unequal stamens. One of the two  additional stamens is manifestly formed by the development of a  microscopically minute papilla, which may be found at the base of the upper  lip of the flower of the common snapdragons in the nineteen plants examined by  me. That this papilla is a rudiment of a stamen was well shown by its various  degrees of development in crossed plants between the common and the peloric  Antirrhinum. Again, a peloric Galeobdolon luteum, growing in my garden, had  five equal petals, all striped like the ordinary lower lip, and included five  equal instead of four unequal stamens; but Mr. R. Keeley, who sent me this  plant, informs me that the flowers vary greatly, having from four to six lobes  to the corolla, and from three to six stamens. (13/71. For other cases of six  divisions in peloric flowers of the Labiatae and Scrophulariaceae see Moquin-  Tandon 'Teratologie' page 192.) Now, as the members of the two great families  to which the Antirrhinum and Galeobdolon belong are properly pentamerous, with  some of the parts confluent and others suppressed, we ought not to look at the  sixth stamen and the sixth lobe to the corolla in either case as due to  reversion, any more than the additional petals in double flowers in these same  two families. But the case is different with the fifth stamen in the peloric  Antirrhinum, which is produced by the redevelopment of a rudiment always  present, and which probably reveals to us the state of the flower, as far as  the stamens are concerned, at some ancient epoch. It is also difficult to  believe that the other four stamens and the petals, after an arrest of  development at a very early embryonic age, would have come to full perfection  in colour, structure, and function, unless these organs had at some former  period normally passed through a similar course of growth. Hence it appears to  me probable that the progenitor of the genus Antirrhinum must at some remote  epoch have included five stamens and borne flowers in some degree resembling  those now produced by the peloric form. The conclusion that peloria is not a  mere monstrosity, irrespective of any former state of the species, is  supported by the fact that this structure is often strongly inherited, as in  the case of the peloric Antirrhinum and Gloxinia and sometimes in that of the  peloric Corydalis solida. (13/72. Godron reprinted from the 'Memoires de  l'Acad. de Stanislas' 1868.)    Lastly I may add that many instances have been recorded of flowers, not  generally considered as peloric, in which certain organs are abnormally  augmented in number. As an increase of parts cannot be looked at as an arrest  of development, nor as due to the redevelopment of rudiments, for no rudiments  are present, and as these additional parts bring the plant into closer  relationship with its natural allies, they ought probably to be viewed as  reversions to a primordial condition.]    These several facts show us in an interesting manner how intimately certain  abnormal states are connected together; namely, arrests of development causing  parts to become rudimentary or to be wholly suppressed,--the redevelopment of  parts now in a more or less rudimentary condition,--the reappearance of organs  of which not a vestige can be detected,--and to these may be added, in the  case of animals, the presence during youth, and subsequent disappearance, of  certain characters which occasionally are retained throughout life. Some  naturalists look at all such abnormal structures as a return to the ideal  state of the group to which the affected being belongs; but it is difficult to  conceive what is meant to be conveyed by this expression. Other naturalists  maintain, with greater probability and distinctness of view, that the common  bond of connection between the several foregoing cases is an actual, though  partial, return to the structure of the ancient progenitor of the group. If  this view be correct, we must believe that a vast number of characters,  capable of evolution, lie hidden in every organic being. But it would be a  mistake to suppose that the number is equally great in all beings. We know,  for instance, that plants of many orders occasionally become peloric; but many  more cases have been observed in the Labiatae and Scrophulariaceae than in any  other order; and in one genus of the Scrophulariaceae, namely Linaria, no less  than thirteen species have been described in this condition (13/73. Moquin-  Tandon 'Teratologie' page 186.) On this view of the nature of peloric flowers,  and bearing in mind certain monstrosities in the animal kingdom, we must  conclude that the progenitors of most plants and animals have left an  impression, capable of redevelopment, on the germs of their descendants,  although these have since been profoundly modified.    The fertilised germ of one of the higher animals, subjected as it is to so  vast a series of changes from the germinal cell to old age,--incessantly  agitated by what Quatrefages well calls the tourbillon vital,--is perhaps the  most wonderful object in nature. It is probable that hardly a change of any  kind affects either parent, without some mark being left on the germ. But on  the doctrine of reversion, as given in this chapter, the germ becomes a far  more marvellous object, for, besides the visible changes which it undergoes,  we must believe that it is crowded with invisible characters, proper to both  sexes, to both the right and left side of the body, and to a long line of male  and female ancestors separated by hundreds or even thousands of generations  from the present time: and these characters, like those "]]]
