His lordship  was little conversant with the history of proverbs, and would  unquestionably have smiled on those \"men of fashion\" of another stamp,  who, in the days of Elizabeth, James, and Charles, were great collectors  of them; would appeal to them in their conversations, and enforce them  in their learned or their statesmanlike correspondence. Few, perhaps,  even now, suspect that these neglected fragments of wisdom, which exist  among all nations, still offer many interesting objects for the studies  of the philosopher and the historian; and for men of the world still  open an extensive school of human life and manners.    The home-spun adages, and the rusty \"sayed-saws,\" which remain in the  mouths of the people, are adapted to their capacities and their humours.  Easily remembered, and readily applied, these are the philosophy of the  vulgar, and often more sound than that of their masters! whoever would  learn what the people think, and how they feel, must not reject even  these as insignificant. The proverbs of the street and of the market,  true to nature, and lasting only because they are true, are records that  the populace at Athens and at Rome were the same people as at Paris and  at London, and as they had before been in the city of Jerusalem!    Proverbs existed before books. The Spaniards date the origin of their  _refranes que dicen las viejas tras el fuego_, \"sayings of old wives by  their firesides,\" before the existence of any writings in their  language, from the circumstance that these are in the old romance or  rudest vulgar idiom. The most ancient poem in the Edda, \"the sublime  speech of Odin,\" abounds with ancient proverbs, strikingly descriptive  of the ancient Scandinavians. Undoubtedly proverbs in the earliest ages  long served as the unwritten language of morality, and even of the  useful arts; like the oral traditions of the Jews, they floated down  from age to age on the lips of successive generations. The name of the  first sage who sanctioned the saying would in time be forgotten, while  the opinion, the metaphor, or the expression, remained, consecrated into  a proverb! Such was the origin of those memorable sentences by which men  learnt to think and to speak appositely; they were precepts which no man  could contradict, at a time when authority was valued more than opinion,  and experience preferred to novelty. The proverbs of a father became the  inheritance of a son; the mistress of a family perpetuated hers through  her household; the workman condensed some traditional secret of his  craft into a proverbial expression. When countries are not yet populous,  and property has not yet produced great inequalities in its ranks, every  day will show them how \"the drunkard and the glutton come to poverty,  and drowsiness clothes a man with rags.\" At such a period he who gave  counsel gave wealth.    It might therefore have been decided, _a priori_, that the most homely  proverbs would abound in the most ancient writers--and such we find in  Hesiod; a poet whose learning was not drawn from books. It could only  have been in the agricultural state that this venerable bard could have  indicated a state of repose by this rustic proverb:--      [Greek: Pedalion men uper kapnou katadeio]    Hang your plough-beam o'er the hearth!    The envy of rival workmen is as justly described by a reference to the  humble manufacturers of earthenware as by the elevated jealousies of the  literati and the artists of a more polished age. The famous proverbial  verse in Hesiod's Works and Days--      [Greek: Kai kerameus keramei koteei],    is literally, \"The potter is hostile to the potter!\"    The admonition of the poet to his brother, to prefer a friendly  accommodation to a litigious lawsuit, has fixed a paradoxical proverb  often applied,--      [Greek: Pleon emisu pantos],    The half is better than the whole!    In the progress of time, the stock of popular proverbs received  accessions from the highest sources of human intelligence; as the  philosophers of antiquity formed their collections, they increased in  \"weight and number.\" Erasmus has pointed out some of these sources, in  the responses of oracles; the allegorical symbols of Pythagoras; the  verses of the poets; allusions to historical incidents; mythology and  apologue; and other recondite origins. Such dissimilar matters, coming  from all quarters, were melted down into this vast body of aphoristic  knowledge. Those \"WORDS OF THE WISE and their DARK SAYINGS,\" as they are  distinguished in that large collection which bears the name of the great  Hebrew monarch, at length seem to have required commentaries; for what  else can we infer of the enigmatic wisdom of the sages, when the royal  paroemiographer classes among their studies, that of \"_understanding a  proverb and the interpretation_?\" This elevated notion of \"the dark  sayings of the wise\" accords with the bold conjecture of their origin  which the Stagyrite has thrown out, who considered them as the wrecks of  an ancient philosophy which had been lost to mankind by the fatal  revolutions of all human things, and that those had been saved from the  general ruin by their pithy elegance and their diminutive form; like  those marine shells found on the tops of mountains, the relics of the  Deluge! Even at a later period, the sage of Cheronea prized them among  the most solemn mysteries; and Plutarch has described them in a manner  which proverbs may even still merit: \"Under the veil of these curious  sentences are hid those germs of morals which the masters of philosophy  have afterwards developed into so many volumes.\"    At the highest period of Grecian genius, the tragic and the comic poets  introduced into their dramas the proverbial style. St. Paul quotes a  line which still remains among the first exercises of our school-pens:--      Evil communications corrupt good manners.    It is a verse found in a fragment of Menander the comic poet:      [Greek: Phtheirousin hethe chresth' homiliai kakai].    As this verse is a proverb, and the apostle, and indeed the highest  authority, Jesus himself, consecrates the use of proverbs by their  occasional application, it is uncertain whether St. Paul quotes the  Grecian poet, or only repeats some popular adage. Proverbs were bright  shafts in the Greek and Latin quivers; and when Bentley, by a league of  superficial wits, was accused of pedantry for his use of some ancient  proverbs, the sturdy critic vindicated his taste by showing that Cicero  constantly introduced Greek proverbs into his writings,--that Scaliger  and Erasmus loved them, and had formed collections drawn from the stores  of antiquity.    Some difficulty has occurred in the definition. Proverbs must be  distinguished from proverbial phrases, and from sententious maxims; but  as proverbs have many faces, from their miscellaneous nature, the class  itself scarcely admits of any definition. When Johnson defined a proverb  to be \"a short sentence frequently repeated by the people,\" this  definition would not include the most curious ones, which have not  always circulated among the populace, nor even belong to them; nor does  it designate the vital qualities of a proverb. The pithy quaintness of  old Howell has admirably described the ingredients of an exquisite  proverb to be _sense, shortness, and salt_. A proverb is distinguished  from a maxim or an apophthegm by that brevity which condenses a thought  or a metaphor, where one thing is said and another is to be applied.  This often produces wit, and that quick pungency which excites surprise,  but strikes with conviction; this gives it an epigrammatic turn. George  Herbert entitled the small collection which he formed \"Jacula  Prudentium,\" Darts or Javelins! something hurled and striking deeply; a  characteristic of a proverb which possibly Herbert may have borrowed  from a remarkable passage in Plato's dialogue of \"Protagoras or the  Sophists.\"    The influence of proverbs over the minds and conversations of a whole  people is strikingly illustrated by this philosopher's explanation of  the term _to laconise_,--the mode of speech peculiar to the  Lacedaemonians. This people affected to appear _unlearned_, and seemed  only emulous to excel the rest of the Greeks in fortitude and in  military skill. According to Plato's notion, this was really a political  artifice, with a view to conceal their pre-eminent wisdom. With the  jealousy of a petty state, they attempted to confine their renowned  sagacity within themselves, and under their military to hide their  contemplative character! The philosopher assures those who in other  cities imagined they _laconised_, merely by imitating the severe  exercises and the other warlike manners of the Lacedaemonians, that they  were grossly deceived; and thus curiously describes the sort of wisdom  which this singular people practised.    \"If any one wish to converse with the meanest of the Lacedaemonians, he  will at first find him, for the most part, apparently despicable in  conversation; but afterwards, when a proper opportunity presents itself,  this same mean person, like a _skilful jaculator, will hurl a sentence_,  worthy of attention, _short and contorted_; so that he who converses  with him will appear to be in no respect superior to a boy! That _to  laconise_, therefore, consists much more in philosophising than in the  love of exercise, is understood by some of the present age, and was  known to the ancients, they being persuaded that the ability of  _uttering such sentences_ as these is the province of a man perfectly  learned. The seven sages were emulators, lovers, and disciples of the  _Lacedaemonian erudition_. Their wisdom was a thing of this kind, viz.  _short sentences uttered by each, and worthy to be remembered_. These  men, "]]]
