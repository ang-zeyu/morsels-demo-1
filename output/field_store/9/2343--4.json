[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2884"],[0,"The Mason-Bees (#10)"],[1,"time to  prepare for the experiment which was to be made in the following May.    'Favier,' I said, one day, to my assistant, 'I shall want some of those  nests. Go and ask our next-door neighbour's leave and climb to the roof  of his shed, with some new tiles and some mortar, which you can fetch  from the builder's. Take a dozen tiles from the roof, those with the  biggest nests on them, and put the new ones in their place.'    Things were done accordingly. My neighbour assented with a good grace to  the exchange of tiles, for he himself is obliged, from time to time, to  demolish the work of the Mason-bee, unless he would risk seeing his roof  fall in sooner or later. I was merely forestalling a repair which became  more urgent every year. That same evening, I was in possession of twelve  magnificent rectangular blocks of nest, each lying on the convex surface  of a tile, that is to say, on the surface looking towards the inside of  the shed. I had the curiosity to weigh the largest: it turned the scale  at thirty-five pounds. Now the roof whence it came was covered with  similar masses, adjoining one another, over a stretch of some seventy  tiles. Reckoning only half the weight, so as to strike an average  between the largest and the smallest lumps, we find the total weight of  the Bee's masonry to amount to three-quarters of a ton. And, even so,  people tell me that they have seen this beaten elsewhere. Leave the  Mason-bee to her own devices, in the spot that suits her; allow the  work of many generations to accumulate; and, one fine day, the roof will  break down under the extra burden. Let the nests grow old; let them  fall to pieces when the damp gets into them; and you will have chunks  tumbling on your head big enough to crack your skull. There you see the  work of a very little-known insect. (The insect is so little known that  I made a serious mistake when treating of it in the first volume of  these \"Souvenirs.\" Under my erroneous denomination of Chalicodoma  sicula are really comprised two species, one building its nests in  our dwellings and particularly under the tiles of outhouses, the other  building its nests on the branches of shrubs. The first species has  received various names, which are, in order of priority: Chalicodoma  pyrenaica, LEP. (Megachile); Chalicodoma pyrrhopeza, GERSTACKER;  Chalicodoma rufitarsis, GIRAUD. It is a pity that the name occupying the  first place should lend itself to misconception. I hesitate to apply  the epithet of Pyrenean to an insect which is much less common in the  Pyrenees than in my own district. I shall call it the Chalicodoma, or  Mason-bee, of the Sheds. There is no objection to the use of this name  in a book where the reader prefers lucidity to the tyranny of systematic  entomology. The second species, that which builds its nests on the  branches, is Chalicodoma rufescens, J. PEREZ. For a like reason, I shall  call it the Chalicodoma of the Shrubs. I owe these corrections to the  kindness of Professor Jean Perez, of Bordeaux, who is so well-versed in  the lore of Wasps and Bees.--Author's Note.)    These treasures were insufficient, not in regard to quantity, but in  regard to quality, for the main object which I had in view. They came  from the nearest house, separated from mine by a little field planted  with corn and olive-trees. I had reason to fear that the insects issuing  from those nests might be hereditarily influenced by their ancestors,  who had lived in the shed for many a long year. The Bee, when carried  to a distance, would perhaps come back, guided by the inveterate family  habit; she would find the shed of her lineal predecessors and thence,  without difficulty, reach her nest. As it is the fashion nowadays to  assign a prominent part to these hereditary influences, I must eliminate  them from my experiments. I want strange Bees, brought from afar, whose  return to the place of their birth can in no way assist their return to  the nest transplanted to another site.    Favier took the business in hand. He had discovered on the banks of  the Aygues, at some miles from the village, a deserted hut where the  Mason-bees had established themselves in a numerous colony. He proposed  to take the wheelbarrow, in which to move the blocks of cells; but  I objected: the jolting of the vehicle over the rough paths might  jeopardise the contents of the cells. A basket carried on the shoulder  was deemed safer. Favier took a man to help him and set out. The  expedition provided me with four well-stocked tiles. It was all that the  two men were able to carry between them; and even then I had to stand  treat on their arrival: they were utterly exhausted. Le Vaillant tells  us of a nest of Republicans (Social Weaver-birds.--Translator's Note.)  with which he loaded a wagon drawn by two oxen. My Mason-bee vies with  the South-African bird: a yoke of Oxen would not have been too many to  move the whole of that nest from the banks of the Aygues.    The next thing is to place my tiles. I want to have them under my eyes,  in a position where I can watch them easily and save myself the worries  of earlier days: going up and down ladders, standing for hours at a  stretch on a narrow rung that hurt the soles of my feet and risking  sunstroke up against a scorching wall. Moreover, it is necessary that  my guests should feel almost as much at home with me as where they come  from. I must make life pleasant for them, if I should have them grow  attached to the new dwelling. And I happen to have the very thing for  them.    Under the leads of my house is a wide arch, the sides of which get  the sun, while the back remains in the shade. There is something for  everybody: the shade for me, the sunlight for my boarders. We fasten  a stout hook to each tile and hang it on the wall, on a level with our  eyes. Half my nests are on the right, half on the left. The general  effect is rather original. Any one walking in and seeing my show for  the first time begins by taking it for a display of smoked provisions,  gammons of some outlandish bacon curing in the sun. On perceiving his  mistake, he falls into raptures at these new hives of mine. The news  spreads through the village and more than one pokes fun at it. They look  upon me as a keeper of hybrid Bees:    'I wonder what he's going to make out of that!' say they.    My hives are in full swing before the end of April. When the work is at  its height, the swarm becomes a little eddying, buzzing cloud. The  arch is a much-frequented passage: it leads to a store-room for various  household provisions. The members of my family bully me at first for  establishing this dangerous commonwealth within the precincts of our  home. They dare not go to fetch things: they would have to pass through  a swarm of Bees; and then...look out for stings! There is nothing for  it but to prove, once and for all, that the danger does not exist, that  mine is a most peaceable Bee, incapable of stinging so long as she is  not startled. I bring my face close to one of the clay nests, so as  almost to touch it, while it is black with Masons at work; I let my  fingers wander through the ranks, I put a few Bees on my hand, I stand  in the thick of the whirling crowd and never a prick do I receive. I  have long known their peaceful character. Time was when I used to share  the common fears, when I hesitated before venturing into a swarm of  Anthophorae or Chalicodomae; nowadays, I have quite got over those  terrors. If you do not tease the insect, the thought of hurting you  will never occur to it. At the worst, a single specimen, prompted by  curiosity rather than anger, will come and hover in front of your face,  examining you with some persistency, but employing a buzz as her only  threat. Let her be: her scrutiny is quite friendly.    After a few demonstrations, my household were reassured: all, old and  young, moved in and out of the arch as though there were nothing unusual  about it. My Bees, far from remaining an object of dread, became an  object of diversion; every one took pleasure in watching the progress  of their ingenious work. I was careful not to divulge the secret to  strangers. If any one, coming on business, passed outside the arch while  I was standing before the hanging nests, some such brief dialogue as the  following would take place:    'So they know you; that's why they don't sting you?'    'They certainly know me.'    'And me?'    'Oh, you; that's another matter!'    Whereupon the intruder would keep at a respectful distance, which was  what I wanted.    It is time that we thought of experimenting. The Mason-bees intended  for the journey must be marked with a sign whereby I may know them. A  solution of gum arabic, thickened with a colouring-powder, red, blue or  some other shade, is the material which I use to mark my travellers. The  variety in hue will save me from confusing the subjects of my different  experiments.    When making my former investigations, I used to mark the Bees at the  place where I set them free. For this operation, the insects had to  be held in the fingers one after the other; and I was thus exposed  to frequent stings, which smarted all the more for being constantly  repeated. The consequence was that I was not always quite able to  control my fingers and thumbs, to the great detriment of my travellers;  for I could easily warp their wing-joints and thus weaken their flight.  It was worth while improving the method of operation, both in my own  interest and in that of the insect. I must mark the Bee, carry her to a  distance and release her, without taking her in my fingers, without  once touching her. The experiment was bound to gain by these nice  precautions. I will describe the method which I adopted.    The Bee is so much engrossed in her work when she buries her abdomen  in the cell and rids herself of her load of pollen, or when she is  building, that it is easy, at such times, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2885"],[0,"The House of the Wolfings (#10)"],[1,"glorious was their array now, as they marched along with  their banner of the Elk, which was drawn by the very beasts themselves  tamed to draught to that end through many generations; they were fatter  and sleeker than their wild-wood brethren, but not so mighty.    So were the men of the three kindreds somewhat mingled together on the  way.  The Wolfings were the tallest and the biggest made; but of those  dark-haired men aforesaid, were there fewest amongst the Beamings, and  most among the Elkings, as though they had drawn to them more men of  alien blood during their wanderings aforesaid.  So they talked together  and made each other good cheer, as is the wont of companions in arms on  the eve of battle; and the talk ran, as may be deemed, on that journey  and what was likely to come of it: and spake an Elking warrior to a  Wolfing by whom he rode:    \"O Wolfkettle, hath the Hall-Sun had any foresight of the day of battle?\"    \"Nay,\" said the other, \"when she lighted the farewell candle, she bade us  come back again, and spoke of the day of our return; but that methinks,  as thou and I would talk of it, thinking what would be likely to befal.  Since we are a great host of valiant men, and these Welshmen {2} most  valiant, and as the rumour runneth bigger-bodied men than the Hun-folk,  and so well ordered as never folk have been.  So then if we overthrow  them we shall come back again; and if they overthrow us, the remnant of  us shall fall back before them till we come to our habitations; for it is  not to be looked for that they will fall in upon our rear and prevent us,  since we have the thicket of the wild-wood on our flanks.\"    \"Sooth is that,\" said the Elking; \"and as to the mightiness of this folk  and their customs, ye may gather somewhat from the songs which our House  yet singeth, and which ye have heard wide about in the Mark; for this is  the same folk of which a many of them tell, making up that story-lay  which is called the South-Welsh Lay; which telleth how we have met this  folk in times past when we were in fellowship with a folk of the Welsh of  like customs to ourselves: for we of the Elkings were then but a feeble  folk.  So we marched with this folk of the Kymry and met the men of the  cities, and whiles we overthrew and whiles were overthrown, but at last  in a great battle were overthrown with so great a slaughter, that the red  blood rose over the wheels of the wains, and the city-folk fainted with  the work of the slaughter, as men who mow a match in the meadows when the  swathes are dry and heavy and the afternoon of midsummer is hot; and  there they stood and stared on the field of the slain, and knew not  whether they were in Home or Hell, so fierce the fight had been.\"    Therewith a man of the Beamings, who was riding on the other side of the  Elking, reached out over his horse's neck and said:    \"Yea friend, but is there not some telling of a tale concerning how ye  and your fellowship took the great city of the Welshmen of the South, and  dwelt there long.\"    \"Yea,\" said the Elking, \"Hearken how it is told in the South-Welsh Lay:          \"'Have ye not heard        Of the ways of Weird?        How the folk fared forth        Far away from the North?        And as light as one wendeth        Whereas the wood endeth,        When of nought is our need,        And none telleth our deed,     So Rodgeir unwearied and Reidfari wan     The town where none tarried the shield-shaking man.     All lonely the street there, and void was the way     And nought hindered our feet but the dead men that lay     Under shield in the lanes of the houses heavens-high,     All the ring-bearing swains that abode there to die.'    \"Tells the Lay, that none abode the Goths and their fellowship, but such  as were mighty enough to fall before them, and the rest, both man and  woman, fled away before our folk and before the folk of the Kymry, and  left their town for us to dwell in; as saith the Lay:          \"'Glistening of gold        Did men's eyen behold;        Shook the pale sword        O'er the unspoken word,        No man drew nigh us        With weapon to try us,        For the Welsh-wrought shield        Lay low on the field.     By man's hand unbuilded all seemed there to be,     The walls ruddy gilded, the pearls of the sea:     Yea all things were dead there save pillar and wall,     But _they_ lived and _they_ said us the song of the hall;     The dear hall left to perish by men of the land,     For the Goth-folk to cherish with gold gaining hand.'    \"See ye how the Lay tells that the hall was bolder than the men, who fled  from it, and left all for our fellowship to deal with in the days gone  by?\"    Said the Wolfing man:    \"And as it was once, so shall it be again.  Maybe we shall go far on this  journey, and see at least one of the garths of the Southlands, even those  which they call cities.  For I have heard it said that they have more  cities than one only, and that so great are their kindreds, that each  liveth in a garth full of mighty houses, with a wall of stone and lime  around it; and that in every one of these garths lieth wealth untold  heaped up.  And wherefore should not all this fall to the Markmen and  their valiancy?\"    Said the Elking:    \"As to their many cities and the wealth of them, that is sooth; but as to  each city being the habitation of each kindred, it is otherwise: for  rather it may be said of them that they have forgotten kindred, and have  none, nor do they heed whom they wed, and great is the confusion amongst  them.  And mighty men among them ordain where they shall dwell, and what  shall be their meat, and how long they shall labour after they are weary,  and in all wise what manner of life shall be amongst them; and though  they be called free men who suffer this, yet may no house or kindred  gainsay this rule and order.  In sooth they are a people mighty, but  unhappy.\"    Said Wolfkettle:    \"And hast thou learned all this from the ancient story lays, O Hiarandi?  For some of them I know, though not all, and therein have I noted nothing  of all this.  Is there some new minstrel arisen in thine House of a  memory excelling all those that have gone before?  If that be so, I bid  him to the Roof of the Wolfings as soon as may be; for we lack new  tales.\"    \"Nay,\" said Hiarandi, \"This that I tell thee is not a tale of past days,  but a tale of to-day.  For there came to us a man from out of the wild-  wood, and prayed us peace, and we gave it him; and he told us that he was  of a House of the Gael, and that his House had been in a great battle  against these Welshmen, whom he calleth the Romans; and that he was taken  in the battle, and sold as a thrall in one of their garths; and howbeit,  it was not their master-garth, yet there he learned of their customs: and  sore was the lesson!  Hard was his life amongst them, for their thralls  be not so well entreated as their draught-beasts, so many do they take in  battle; for they are a mighty folk; and these thralls and those aforesaid  unhappy freemen do all tilling and herding and all deeds of  craftsmanship: and above these are men whom they call masters and lords  who do nought, nay not so much as smithy their own edge-weapons, but  linger out their days in their dwellings and out of their dwellings,  lying about in the sun or the hall-cinders, like cur-dogs who have fallen  away from kind.    \"So this man made a shift to flee away from out of that garth, since it  was not far from the great river; and being a valiant man, and young and  mighty of body, he escaped all perils and came to us through the  Mirkwood.  But we saw that he was no liar, and had been very evilly  handled, for upon his body was the mark of many a stripe, and of the  shackles that had been soldered on to his limbs; also it was more than  one of these accursed people whom he had slain when he fled.  So he  became our guest and we loved him, and he dwelt among us and yet  dwelleth, for we have taken him into our House.  But yesterday he was  sick and might not ride with us; but may be he will follow on and catch  up with us in a day or two.  And if he come not, then will I bring him  over to the Wolfings when the battle is done.\"    Then laughed the Beaming man, and spake:    \"How then if ye come not back, nor Wolfkettle, nor the Welsh Guest, nor I  myself?  Meseemeth no one of these Southland Cities shall we behold, and  no more of the Southlanders than their war-array.\"    \"These are evil words,\" said Wolfkettle, \"though such an outcome must be  thought on.  But why deemest thou this?\"    Said the Beaming: \"There is no Hall-Sun sitting under our Roof at home to  tell true tales concerning the Kindred every day.  Yet forsooth from time  to time is a word said in our Folk-hall for good or for evil; and who can  choose but hearken thereto?  And yestereve was a woeful word spoken, and  that by a man-child of ten winters.\"    Said the Elking: \"Now that thou hast told us thus much, thou must tell us  more, yea, all the word which was spoken; else belike we shall deem of it  as worse than it was.\"    Said the Beaming: \"Thus it was; this little lad brake out weeping  yestereve, when the Hall was full and feasting; and he wailed, and roared  out, as children do, and would not be pacified, and when he was asked why  he made that to do, he said: 'Well away!  Raven hath promised to make me  a clay horse and to bake it in the kiln with the pots next week; and now  he goeth to the war, and he shall never come back, and never shall my  horse be made.'  Thereat we all laughed as ye may well deem.  But the lad  made a sour countenance on us and said, 'why do ye laugh? look yonder,  what see ye?'  'Nay,' said one, 'nought but the Feast-hall wall and the  hangings of the High-tide thereon.'  Then said the lad sobbing: 'Ye see  ill: further afield see I: I see a little plain, on a hill top, and fells  beyond it far bigger than our"]]]
