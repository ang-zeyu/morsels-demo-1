On the 26th we resumed our march. At night we were alarmed by  the continual threatening of our enemies. I would here remark that  notwithstanding so many threats were thrown out against us, we did not  fear, nor hesitate to proceed on our journey, for God was with us, and  angels went before us, and we had no fear of either men or devils.  This we know because they (the angels) were seen. On Tuesday we came  to the Okaw, a fork of the Kaskaskia River, where we found two canoes;  we lashed them together and they served as a kind of ferry boat. We  took our baggage out of our wagons, put it on board and ferried it  across; then took our wagons and horses, and swam them across, and  when they got to the opposite shore the brethren fastened ropes into  the tongues of the wagons and helped the horses and wagons out of the  river. Others felled trees and laid them across the river, and thus  helped themselves over. In this way we all crossed in safety.  Wednesday, the 28th, we reached the township of Decatur, where we lost  another horse. Saturday the 31st, at night, we camped one mile from  Jacksonville and prepared for the Sabbath.    \"On Sunday, June 1st, we had preaching all day, and many of the  inhabitants of the town came out to hear. Brother John S. Carter  preached in the morning. By this time the inhabitants began to flock  down in companies to hear the preaching, as they understood we were  professors of religion and had a meeting in the morning. Brother  Joseph then proposed that some of the brethren should set forth  different portions of the Gospel in their discourses. He called upon  Brother Joseph Young to preach upon the principles of free salvation.  He then called upon Brother Brigham Young to speak, who set forth  baptism as essential to salvation. He was followed by Brother Orson  Hyde, who proved by the scriptures that baptism was for the remission  of sins. Lyman E. Johnson spoke at some length upon the necessity of  men being upright in their walk, and keeping the Sabbath day holy.  Brother Orson Pratt delivered an excellent discourse on the principles  of the final restoration of all things. The services of the day were  concluded by a powerful exhortation from Eleazer Miller. His voice was  said to be heard a mile and a half. I would here remark concerning  Brother Eleazer Miller, who was one of the first that brought the  Gospel to us at Mendon, New York: when he used to retire to a little  grove near my house for secret prayer, he would get so filled with the  Spirit and the power of the Holy Ghost that he would burst out in a  loud voice so that he was heard by the surrounding inhabitants for  more than a mile. After the services were over, many strangers were in  our camp making remarks upon the preaching which they had heard. They  said that Brother Joseph Young, by his preaching, they should judge  was a Methodist. They thought Brother Brigham Young was a close  communion Baptist. Brother Orson Hyde they supposed was a Campbellite  or reformed Baptist. Brother Lyman E. Johnson they supposed was a  Presbyterian, and Brother Orson Pratt a Restorationer. They enquired  if we all belonged to one denomination. The answer was, we _were_ some  of us Baptists, some Methodists, some Presbyterians, some Cambellites,  some Restorationers, etc.    \"On Monday morning when we passed through Jacksonville, they undertook  to count us; and I heard one man say, who stood in the door of a  cabinet shop, that he had counted a little rising of five hundred, but  he could not tell how many there were. This thing was attempted many  times in villages and towns as we passed through, but the people were  never able to ascertain our number.    \"While traveling in Indiana some spies came into our camp. While we  were eating dinner on the 21st of May, three gentlemen came riding up  on very fine looking horses and commenced their enquiries of various  ones concerning our traveling in so large a body, asking where we were  from, and where we were going. The reply was as usual, some from  Maine, some from New York, some from Massachusetts, some from Ohio,  and some replied, we are from the east, and as soon as we have done  eating we shall be going to the west again. They then addressed  themselves to Dr. Williams, to see if they could find out who the  leader of the camp was. The doctor replied, we have no one in  particular. They asked if we had not a general to take lead of the  company. The reply was, no one in particular. But, said they, is there  not some one among you whom you call your captain, or leader, or  superior to the rest? He answered, sometimes one, and sometimes  another, takes charge of the company so as to not throw the burden  upon any one in particular. These same spies, who had come from the  west, passed us that same day, and the next.    \"On Monday, June 2nd, we crossed the Illinois River. The enemy had  threatened that we should not pass over, but we were ferried across  without any difficulty. Here we were counted by the ferryman and he  declared we were five hundred in number, although there were only  about one hundred and fifty of us. Our company had increased since we  started from Kirtland in consequence of many having volunteered and  joined us from the different branches of the Church through which we  had passed on our journey. We camped on the west bank of the river  until the next day.    \"On Tuesday, the 3d, several of us went up with the Prophet to the top  of a mound on the bank of the Illinois River, which was several  hundred feet above the river, and from the summit we had a pleasant  view of the surrounding country. We could overlook the tops of the  trees and the meadow or prairie on each side the river as far as our  eyes could extend, which was one of the most pleasant scenes I ever  beheld. On the top of this mound there was the appearance of three  altars, which had been built of stone, one above the other, according  to the ancient order; and the ground was strewn with human bones. This  caused in us very peculiar feelings, to see the bones of our fellow  creatures scattered in this manner,--fellow creatures who had been  slain in ages past. We felt prompted to dig down into the mound, and  sending for a shovel and hoe, we proceeded to move away the earth. At  about one foot in depth we discovered the skeleton of a man, almost  entire; and between two of his ribs we found an Indian arrow, which  had evidently been the cause of his death. We took the leg and thigh  bones and carried them to Clay County. All four appeared sound.  Brother Brigham Young has yet the arrow in his possession. It was a  common thing to find bones thus bleaching upon the earth in that  country.    \"The same day we pursued our journey. While on our way we felt anxious  to know who the person was who had been killed by that arrow. It was  made known to Joseph that he had been an officer who fell in battle,  in the last destruction among the Lamanites, and his name was Zelph.  This caused us to rejoice much, to think that God was so mindful of us  as to show these things to His servant. Brother Joseph had enquired of  the Lord and it was made known to him in a vision.    \"While we were refreshing ourselves and teams, about the middle of the  day, Brother Joseph got up in a wagon and said he would deliver a  prophecy. After giving the brethren much good advice, he exhorted them  to faithfulness and humility, and said the Lord had told him that  there would be a scourge come upon the camp in consequence of the  fractious and unruly spirits that appeared among them, and they would  die like sheep with the rot; still if they would repent and humble  themselves before the Lord, the scourge in a great measure might be  turned away; 'but, as the Lord lives, this camp will suffer for giving  way to their unruly temper;' which afterwards actually did take place  to the sorrow of the brethren.    \"The same day when we had got within one mile of the Snye, we came to  a very beautiful little town called Atlas. Here we found honey, for  the first time on our journey, that we could buy. We purchased about  two-thirds of a barrel. We went down to the Snye and crossed over that  night in a ferry boat and camped for the night on the west bank. There  was a great excitement in the country through which we had passed, and  also ahead of us; the mob threatened to stop us; guns were fired in  almost every direction through the night.    \"We pursued our journey on the 4th and camped on the bank of the  Mississippi River. Here we were somewhat afflicted, and the enemy  threatened much that we should not cross over the river out of  Illinois into Missouri. It took us two days to cross the river, as we  had but one ferry boat, and the river was one mile and a half wide.  While some were crossing others spent their time in hunting, fishing,  etc. When we had all got over we camped about one mile from the little  town of Louisiana, in a beautiful oak grove, immediately on the bank  of the river.    \"At this place there were some feelings of hostility again manifested  by Sylvester Smith, in consequence of a dog growling at him while he  was marching his company up to the camp, he being the last that came  over the river. The next morning Brother Joseph said that he would  descend to the spirit that was manifested by some of the brethren to  show them the folly of their wickedness. He rose up and commenced by  saying, 'If any man insults me, or abuses me, I will stand in my own  defence at the expense of my life; and if a dog growl at me, I will  let him know that I am his master.' At this moment Sylvester Smith,  who had just returned from where he had turned out his horses to feed,  came up, and hearing Brother Joseph make those remarks said, 'If that  dog bites me I'll kill him.' Brother Joseph turned to Sylvester and  said, 'If you kill"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3534"],[0,"A Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson (#10)"],[1,"land; and a portion of tools and  implements of agriculture, proper for their use. And whenever any man,  who may become a settler, can maintain, feed, and clothe, such number of  convicts as may be judged necessary by the governor, for the time being,  to assist him in clearing and cultivating the land, the service of such  convicts shall be assigned to him.      We were joyfully surprised on the 20th of the month to see another sail  enter the harbour. She proved to be the Justinian transport, commanded by  Captain Maitland, and our rapture was doubled on finding that she was  laden entirely with provisions for our use. Full allowance, and general  congratulation, immediately took place. This ship had left Falmouth on  the preceding 20th of January, and completed her passage exactly in five  months*. She had staid at Madeira one day, and four at Sao Tiago, from  which last place she had steered directly for New South Wales, neglecting  Rio de Janeiro on her right, and the Cape of Good Hope on her left; and  notwithstanding the immense tract of ocean she had passed, brought her crew  without sickness into harbour. When the novelty and boldness of such an  attempt shall be recollected, too much praise, on the spirit and activity  of Mr. Maitland, cannot be bestowed.    [*Accident only prevented her from making it in eighteen days less, for she  was then in sight of the harbour's mouth, when an unpropitious gale of wind  blew her off. Otherwise she would have reached us one day sooner than the  'Lady Juliana'. It is a curious circumstance, that these two ships had  sailed together from the river Thames, one bound to Port Jackson, and  the other bound to Jamaica. The Justinian carried her cargo to the last  mentioned place, landed it; and loaded afresh with sugars, which she  returned with, and delivered in London. She was then hired as a transport,  reladen, and sailed for New South Wales. Let it be remembered, that no  material accident had happened to either vessel. But what will not zeal and  diligence accomplish!]    Good fortune continued to befriend us. Before the end of the month, three  more transports, having on board two companies of the New South Wales  corps, arrived to add to our society. These ships also brought out a large  body of convicts, whose state and sufferings will be best estimated by the  following return.         Names of     No. of people   No. of persons who died   No. landed sick       Ships         embarked          on the passage       at Port Jackson              -----------------------------------------------------------------       Neptune           530                 163                  269         Surprise          252                  42                  121         Scarborough       256                  68                   96              -----------------------------------------------------------------                        1038                 273                  486              -----------------------------------------------------------------    N.B. Of those landed sick, one hundred and twenty-four died in the hospital  at Sydney.      On our passage from England, which had lasted more than eight months and  with nearly an equal number of persons, only twenty-four had died, and  not thirty were landed sick. The difference can be accounted for, only by  comparing the manner in which each fleet was fitted out and conducted. With  us the provisions, served on board, were laid in by a contractor, who sent  a deputy to serve them out; and it became a part of duty for the officers  of the troops to inspect their quality, and to order that every one  received his just proportion. Whereas, in the fleet now arrived, the  distribution of provisions rested entirely with the masters of the  merchantmen, and the officers were expressly forbidden to interfere in any  shape farther about the convicts than to prevent their escape.    Seventeen pounds, in full of all expense, was the sum paid by the public  for the passage of each person. And this sum was certainly competent to  afford fair profit to the merchant who contracted. But there is reason  to believe, that some of those who were employed to act for him, violated  every principle of justice, and rioted on the spoils of misery, for want of  a controlling power to check their enormities. No doubt can be entertained,  that a humane and liberal government will interpose its authority, to  prevent the repetition of such flagitious conduct.    Although the convicts had landed from these ships with every mark of  meagre misery, yet it was soon seen, that a want of room, in which more  conveniences might have been stowed for their use, had not caused it.  Several of the masters of the transports immediately opened stores,  and exposed large quantities of goods to sale, which, though at most  extortionate prices, were eagerly bought up.    Such was the weakly state of the new corners, that for several weeks little  real benefit to the colony was derived from so great a nominal addition to  our number. However, as fast as they recovered, employment was immediately  assigned to them. The old hours of labour, which had been reduced in our  distress, were re-established, and the most vigorous measures adopted to  give prosperity to the settlement. New buildings were immediately planned,  and large tracts of ground, at Rose-hill, ordered to be cleared, and  prepared for cultivation. Some superintendents who had arrived in the  fleet, and were hired by government for the purpose of overlooking and  directing the convicts, were found extremely serviceable in accelerating  the progress of improvement.    July, 1790. This month was marked by nothing worth communication, except  a melancholy accident which befell a young gentleman of amiable character  (one of the midshipmen lately belonging to the 'Sirius') and two marines.  He was in a small boat, with three marines, in the harbour, when a whale  was seen near them. Sensible of their danger, they used every effort to  avoid the cause of it, by rowing in a contrary direction from that which  the fish seemed to take, but the monster suddenly arose close to them, and  nearly filled the boat with water. By exerting themselves, they baled her  out, and again steered from it. For some time it was not seen, and they  conceived themselves safe, when, rising immediately under the boat, it  lifted her to the height of many yards on its back, whence slipping off,  she dropped as from a precipice, and immediately filled and sunk. The  midshipman and one of the marines were sucked into the vortex which the  whale had made, and disappeared at once. The two other marines swam for  the nearest shore, but one only reached it, to recount the fate of his  companions.    August, 1790. In the beginning of this month, in company with Mr. Dawes and  Mr. Worgan, late surgeon of the 'Sirius', I undertook an expedition to  the southward and westward of Rose Hill, where the country had never been  explored. We remained out seven days, and penetrated to a considerable  distance in a S.S.W. direction, bounding our course at a remarkable hill,  to which, from its conical shape, we gave the name of Pyramid-hill. Except  the discovery of a river (which is unquestionably the Nepean near its  source) to which we gave the name of the Worgan, in honour of one of our  party, nothing very interesting was remarked.    Towards the end of the month, we made a second excursion to the north-west  of Rose Hill, when we again fell in with the Nepean, and traced it to  the spot where it had been first discovered by the party of which I was  a member, fourteen months before, examining the country as we went along.  Little doubt now subsisted that the Hawkesbury and Nepean were one river.    We undertook a third expedition soon after to Broken Bay, which place  we found had not been exaggerated in description, whether its capacious  harbour, or its desolate incultivable shores, be considered. On all these  excursions we brought away, in small bags, as many specimens of the soil  of the country we had passed through, as could be conveniently carried, in  order that by analysis its qualities might be ascertained.          CHAPTER VIII.        Transactions of the Colony in the Beginning of September, 1790.      The tremendous monster who had occasioned the unhappy catastrophe just  recorded was fated to be the cause of farther mischief to us.    On the 7th instant, Captain Nepean, of the New South Wales Corps, and Mr.  White, accompanied by little Nanbaree, and a party of men, went in a boat  to Manly Cove, intending to land there, and walk on to Broken Bay. On  drawing near the shore, a dead whale, in the most disgusting state of  putrefaction, was seen lying on the beach, and at least two hundred Indians  surrounding it, broiling the flesh on different fires, and feasting on  it with the most extravagant marks of greediness and rapture. As the boat  continued to approach, they were observed to fall into confusion and to  pick up their spears, on which our people lay upon their oars and Nanbaree  stepping forward, harangued them for some time, assuring them that we were  friends. Mr. White now called for Baneelon who, on hearing his name, came  forth, and entered into conversation. He was greatly emaciated, and so  far disfigured by a long beard, that our people not without difficulty  recognized their old acquaintance. His answering in broken English, and  inquiring for the governor, however, soon corrected their doubts. He seemed  quite friendly. And soon after Colbee came up, pointing to his leg, to show  that he had freed himself from the fetter which was upon him, when he had  escaped from us.    When Baneelon was told that the governor was not far off, he expressed  great joy, and declared that he would immediately go in search of him,  and if he found him not, would follow him to Sydney. \"Have you brought any  hatchets with you?\""]]]
