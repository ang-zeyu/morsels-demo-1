Ships by type includes a listing of barge carriers, bulk cargo ships,  cargo ships, chemical tankers, combination bulk carriers, combination  ore/oil carriers, container ships, liquefied gas tankers, livestock  carriers, multifunctional large-load carriers, petroleum tankers,  passenger ships, passenger/cargo ships, railcar carriers, refrigerated  cargo ships, roll-on/roll-off cargo ships, short-sea passenger ships,  specialized tankers, and vehicle carriers.    Foreign-owned are ships that fly the flag of one country but belong to  owners in another.    Registered in other countries are ships that belong to owners in one  country but fly the flag of another.    Military    This category includes the entries dealing with a country's military  structure, manpower, and expenditures.    Military - note    This entry includes miscellaneous military information of significance  not included elsewhere.    Military branches    This entry lists the service branches subordinate to defense ministries  or the equivalent (typically ground, naval, air, and marine forces).    Military expenditures - dollar figure    This entry gives spending on defense programs in US dollars for the  most recent year available; dollar figures for military expenditures  should be treated with caution because of different price patterns and  accounting methods among nations, as well as wide variations in the  strength of different currencies.    Military expenditures - percent of GDP    This entry gives spending on defense programs for the most recent year  available as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP); the GDP is  calculated on an exchange rate basis, i.e., not in terms of purchasing  power parity (PPP).    Military service age and obligation    This entry gives the required ages for voluntary or conscript military  service and the length of sevice obligation.    Money figures    All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars unless  otherwise indicated.    National holiday    This entry gives the primary national day of celebration - usually  independence day.    Nationality    This entry provides the identifying terms for citizens - noun and  adjective.    Natural gas - consumption    This entry is the total natural gas consumed in cubic meters (cu m).  The discrepancy between the amount of natural gas produced and/or  imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is due to the omission  of stock changes and other complicating factors.    Natural gas - exports    This entry is the total natural gas exported in cubic meters (cu m).    Natural gas - imports    This entry is the total natural gas imported in cubic meters (cu m).    Natural gas - production    This entry is the total natural gas produced in cubic meters (cu m).  The discrepancy between the amount of natural gas produced and/or  imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is due to the omission  of stock changes and other complicating factors.    Natural gas - proved reserves    This entry is the stock of proved reserves of natural gas in cubic  meters (cu m). Proved reserves are those quantities of natural gas,  which, by analysis of geological and engineering data, can be estimated  with a high degree of confidence to be commercially recoverable from a  given date forward, from known reservoirs and under current economic  conditions.    Natural hazards    This entry lists potential natural disasters.    Natural resources    This entry lists a country's mineral, petroleum, hydropower, and other  resources of commercial importance.    Net migration rate    This entry includes the figure for the difference between the number of  persons entering and leaving a country during the year per 1,000  persons (based on midyear population). An excess of persons entering  the country is referred to as net immigration (e.g., 3.56  migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the country as  net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000 population). The net  migration rate indicates the contribution of migration to the overall  level of population change. High levels of migration can cause problems  such as increasing unemployment and potential ethnic strife (if people  are coming in) or a reduction in the labor force, perhaps in certain  key sectors (if people are leaving).    Oil - consumption    This entry is the total oil consumed in barrels per day (bbl/day). The  discrepancy between the amount of oil produced and/or imported and the  amount consumed and/or exported is due to the omission of stock  changes, refinery gains, and other complicating factors.    Oil - exports    This entry is the total oil exported in barrels per day (bbl/day),  including both crude oil and oil products.    Oil - imports    This entry is the total oil imported in barrels per day (bbl/day),  including both crude oil and oil products.    Oil - production    This entry is the total oil produced in barrels per day (bbl/day). The  discrepancy between the amount of oil produced and/or imported and the  amount consumed and/or exported is due to the omission of stock  changes, refinery gains, and other complicating factors.    Oil - proved reserves    This entry is the stock of proved reserves of crude oil in barrels  (bbl). Proved reserves are those quantities of petroleum which, by  analysis of geological and engineering data, can be estimated with a  high degree of confidence to be commercially recoverable from a given  date forward, from known reservoirs and under current economic  conditions.    People    This category includes the entries dealing with the characteristics of  the people and their society.    People - note    This entry includes miscellaneous demographic information of  significance not included elsewhere.    Personal Names - Capitalization    The Factbook capitalizes the surname or family name of individuals for  the convenience of our users who are faced with a world of different  cultures and naming conventions. The need for capitalization, bold  type, underlining, italics, or some other indicator of the individual's  surname is apparent in the following examples: MAO Zedong, Fidel CASTRO  Ruz, George W. BUSH, and TUNKU SALAHUDDIN Abdul Aziz Shah ibni Al-  Marhum Sultan Hisammuddin Alam Shah. By knowing the surname, a short  form without all capital letters can be used with confidence as in  President Castro, Chairman Mao, President Bush, or Sultan Tunku  Salahuddin. The same system of capitalization is extended to the names  of leaders with surnames that are not commonly used such as Queen  ELIZABETH II. For Vietnamese names, the given name is capitalized  because officials are referred to by their given name rather than by  their surname. For example, the president of Vietnam is Tran Duc LUONG.  His surname is Tran, but he is referred to by his given name -  President LUONG.    Personal Names - Spelling    The romanization of personal names in the Factbook normally follows the  same transliteration system used by the US Board on Geographic Names  for spelling place names. At times, however, a foreign leader expressly  indicates a preference for, or the media or official documents  regularly use, a romanized spelling that differs from the  transliteration derived from the US Government standard. In such cases,  the Factbook uses the alternative spelling.    Personal Names - Titles    The Factbook capitalizes any valid title (or short form of it)  immediately preceding a person's name. A title standing alone is not  capitalized. Examples: President PUTIN and President BUSH are chiefs of  state. In Russia, the president is chief of state and the premier is  the head of the government, while in the US, the president is both  chief of state and head of government.    Petroleum    See entries under Oil.    Petroleum products    See entries under Oil.    Pipelines    This entry gives the lengths and types of pipelines for transporting  products like natural gas, crude oil, or petroleum products.    Political parties and leaders    This entry includes a listing of significant political organizations  and their leaders.    Political pressure groups and leaders    This entry includes a listing of organizations with leaders involved in  politics, but not standing for legislative election.    Population    This entry gives an estimate from the US Bureau of the Census based on  statistics from population censuses, vital statistics registration  systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past and on  assumptions about future trends. The total population presents one  overall measure of the potential impact of the country on the world and  within its region. Note: starting with the 1993 Factbook, demographic  estimates for some countries (mostly African) have explicitly taken  into account the effects of the growing impact of the HIV/AIDS  epidemic. These countries are currently: The Bahamas, Benin, Botswana,  Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central  African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the  Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras,  Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South  Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and  Zimbabwe.    Population below poverty line    National estimates of the percentage of the population falling below  the poverty line are based on surveys of sub-groups, with the results  weighted by the number of people in each group. Definitions of poverty  vary considerably among nations. For example, rich nations generally  employ more generous standards of poverty than poor nations.    Population growth rate    The average annual percent change in the population, resulting from a  surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance of migrants  entering and leaving a country.

Matters had now been  explained, and he only regretted that his wound had not at once ended  his existence.    The whole story bore the impress of truth, but when the other prisoner  was asked what he had to say he adhered to his first answers,  maintaining their correctness, and again asserted that he was the real  Martin Guerre, and that the new claimant could only be Arnauld du Thill,  the clever impostor, who was said to resemble himself so much that the  inhabitants of Sagias had agreed in mistaking him for the said Arnauld.    The two Martin Guerres were then confronted without changing the  situation in the least; the first showing the same assurance, the same  bold and confident bearing; while the second, calling on God and men to  bear witness to his sincerity, deplored his misfortune in the most  pathetic terms.    The judge's perplexity was great: the affair became more and more  complicated, the question remained as difficult, as uncertain as ever.  All the appearances and evidences were at variance; probability seemed  to incline towards one, sympathy was more in favour of the other, but  actual proof was still wanting.    At length a member of the Parliament, M. de Coras, proposed as a last  chance before resorting to torture, that final means of examination in a  barbarous age, that Bertrande should be placed between the two rivals,  trusting, he said, that in such a case a woman's instinct would divine  the truth. Consequently the two Martin Guerres were brought before the  Parliament, and a few moments after Bertrande was led in, weak, pale,  hardly able to stand, being worn out by suffering and advanced  pregnancy. Her appearance excited compassion, and all watched anxiously  to see what she would do. She looked at the two men, who had been placed  at different ends of the hall, and turning from him who was nearest to  her, went and knelt silently before the man with the wooden leg; then,  joining her hands as if praying for mercy, she wept bitterly. So simple  and touching an action roused the sympathy of all present; Arnauld du  Thill grew pale, and everyone expected that Martin Guerre, rejoiced at  being vindicated by this public acknowledgment, would raise his wife and  embrace her. But he remained cold and stern, and in a contemptuous  tone--    \"Your tears, madame,\" he said; \"they do not move me in the least,  neither can you seek to excuse your credulity by the examples of my  sisters and my uncle. A wife knows her husband more intimately than his  other relations, as you prove by your present action, and if she is  deceived it is because she consents to the deception. You are the sole  cause of the misfortunes of my house, and to you only shall I ever  impute them.\"    Thunderstruck by this reproach, the poor woman had no strength to reply,  and was taken home more dead than alive.    The dignified language of this injured husband made another point in his  favour. Much pity was felt for Bertrande, as being the victim of an  audacious deception; but everybody agreed that thus it beseemed the real  Martin Guerre to have spoken. After the ordeal gone through by the wife  had been also essayed by the sisters and other relatives, who one and  all followed Bertrande's example and accepted the new-comer, the court,  having fully deliberated, passed the following sentence, which we  transcribe literally:    \"Having reviewed the trial of Arnauld du Thill or Pansette, calling  himself Martin Guerre, a prisoner in the Conciergerie, who appeals from  the decision of the judge of Rieux, etc.    \"We declare that this court negatives the appeal and defence of the said  Arnauld du Thill; and as punishment and amends for the imposture,  deception, assumption of name and of person, adultery, rape, sacrilege,  theft, larceny, and other deeds committed by the aforesaid du Thill, and  causing the above-mentioned trial; this court has condemned and condemns  him to do penance before the church of Artigue, kneeling, clad in his  shirt only, bareheaded and barefoot, a halter on his neck, and a burning  torch in his hand, and there he shall ask pardon from God, from the  King, and from justice, from the said Martin Guerre and Bertrande de  Rolls, husband and wife: and this done, the aforesaid du Thill shall be  delivered into the hands of the executioners of the King's justice, who  shall lead him through the customary streets and crossroads of the  aforesaid place of Artigues, and, the halter on his neck, shall bring  him before the house of the aforesaid Martin Guerre, where he shall be  hung and strangled upon a gibbet erected for this purpose, after which  his body shall be burnt: and for various reasons and considerations  thereunto moving the court, it has awarded and awards the goods of the  aforesaid Arnauld du Thill, apart from the expenses of justice, to the  daughter born unto him by the aforesaid Bertrande de Rolls, under  pretence of marriage falsely asserted by him, having thereto assumed the  name and person of the aforesaid Martin Guerre, by this mans deceiving  the aforesaid de Rolls; and moreover the court has exempted and exempts  from this trial the aforesaid Martin Guerre and Bertrande de Rolls, also  the said Pierre Guerre, uncle of the aforesaid Martin, and has remitted  and remits the aforesaid Arnauld du Thill to the aforesaid judge of  Rieux, in order that the present sentence may be executed according to  its form and tenor. Pronounced judicially this 12th day of September  1560.\"    This sentence substituted the gallows for the decapitation decreed by  the first judge, inasmuch as the latter punishment was reserved for  criminals of noble birth, while hanging was inflicted on meaner persons.    When once his fate was decided, Arnauld du Thill lost all his audacity.  Sent back to Artigues, he was interrogated in prison by the judge of  Rieux, and confessed his imposture at great length. He said the idea  first occurred to him when, having returned from the camp in Picardy, he  was addressed as Martin Guerre by several intimate friends of the  latter. He then inquired as to the sort of life, the habits and  relations of, this man, and having contrived to be near him, had watched  him closely during the battle. He saw him fall, carried him away, and  then, as the reader has already seen, excited his delirium to the utmost  in order to obtain possession of his secrets. Having thus explained his  successful imposture by natural causes, which excluded any idea of magic  or sorcery, he protested his penitence, implored the mercy of God, and  prepared himself for execution as became a Christian.    The next day, while the populace, collecting from the whole  neighbourhood, had assembled before the parish church of Artigues in  order to behold the penance of the criminal, who, barefoot, attired in a  shirt, and holding a lighted torch in his hand, knelt at the entrance of  the church, another scene, no less painful, took place in the house of  Martin Guerre. Exhausted by her suffering, which had caused a premature  confinement, Bertrande lay on her couch of pain, and besought pardon  from him whom she had innocently wronged, entreating him also to pray  for her soul. Martin Guerre, sitting at her bedside, extended his hand  and blessed her. She took his hand and held it to her lips; she could no  longer speak. All at once a loud noise was heard outside: the guilty man  had just been executed in front of the house. When finally attached to  the gallows, he uttered a terrible cry, which was answered by another  from inside the house. The same evening, while the body of the  malefactor was being consumed by fire, the remains of a mother and child  were laid to rest in consecrated ground.                                            ----"]]]
