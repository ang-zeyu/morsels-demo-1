[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33914"],[0,"Myology and Serology of the Avian Family Fringillidae: A Taxonomic Study (#10)"],[1,"(Fig. 13) in  which the value of the heterologous reaction was 45 per cent. Because  most ornithologists consider these genera to be only distantly related  (they are in different suborders within the Order Passeriformes), the  relatively high value of the heterologous reaction emphasizes the  close serological correspondence of passerine birds and indicates that  small consistent serological differences among these birds are  actually significant. The possibility that some of the serological  correspondence is due to the \"homologizing\" effect of formalin on  proteins should not be excluded. I think, however, that this effect is  not entirely responsible for the close correspondence observed here.    An additional point to consider in interpretation of the serological  tests is that the techniques used tend to separate sharply species  that are closely related whereas species that are distantly related  are not so easily separated. In other words, comparative serological  studies with the photronreflectometer tend to minimize the differences  between distant relatives and to exaggerate the differences between  close relatives.    In analyzing the serological relationships of the species used in this  study, it becomes obvious that two or more series of tests must be  considered before the birds can be placed in relation to each other.  For example, the data presented in Fig. 14 indicate that _Spiza_ and  _Molothrus_ show approximately the same degree of serological  correspondence to _Richmondena_. This does not imply necessarily that  _Spiza_ and _Molothrus_ are closely related. If Fig. 15 is examined,  it can be determined that _Richmondena_ shows much greater serological  correspondence to _Spiza_ than does _Molothrus_. Thus, an analysis of  both figures serves to clarify the true serological relationships of  the three genera. By reference to other series of tests involving  these three birds a more exact determination of their relationships  may be obtained.    To illustrate this point by a hypothetical example, two species might  seem equidistant, serologically, from a third species. Additional  testing should indicate if the first two species are equidistant in  the same direction (therefore, by implication, close relatives) or in  opposite directions (therefore, distant relatives). A single test  supplies only two dimensions of a three dimensional arrangement.    It is impossible to interpret and to picture the serological data  satisfactorily in two dimensions; therefore, a three-dimensional model  (Figs. 22, 23) was constructed to summarize the serological  relationships of the birds involved. Each of the eleven kinds used  consistently throughout the investigation is represented in the model.  By use of the percentage values (Table 2), each bird was located in  relation to the other birds. Where possible, averages of reciprocal  tests (Table 3) were used in determining distances between the  elements of the model. In this way seven of the birds were accurately  located in relation to each other. Lacking reciprocal tests, the  positions of the other birds were determined by the values of single  tests (Table 4). Although these birds were placed with less certainty,  at least four points of reference were used in locating each species.  At least one serological test is represented by each connecting bar in  the model. The lengths of the bars connecting any two elements were  determined as follows: a percentage value (Table 3 and Table 4)  representing the degree of serological correspondence between two  birds was subtracted from 100 per cent; the remainder was multiplied  by a factor of five to increase the size of the model and the product  was expressed in millimeters; a bar of proper length connects the two  elements involved.    From the model it is observed that, _Molothrus_ and _Passer_ excluded,  the birds fall into two distinct groups: one includes _Piranga_,  _Richmondena_, _Spiza_, _Junco_, and _Zonotrichia_; the other includes  _Estrilda_, _Poephila_, _Carpodacus_, and _Spinus_.

During the process of blowing,  the hot glass must be steadily rotated.    To collect the glass for blowing a bulb of lead glass, employ the flame  described on pp. 17-22 for heating lead glass.    If the tube be held horizontally whilst the globe is blown, its form  will most nearly approach that of a true globe. If it be held in the  perpendicular position, with the mass of glass depending from it, the  form of the bulb will usually be somewhat elongated. If it be held  perpendicularly, with the mass of glass upwards, the resulting bulb will  be flattened.    When a bulb is not of a sufficiently regular form, it may sometimes be  re-made by re-collecting the glass, and re-blowing it. The greatest care  is needed at the earlier stages of re-heating to prevent the glass from  collapsing into a formless and unworkable mass. This is to be prevented  in all such cases by gently blowing it into shape from time to time  whilst gathering the glass.    [Illustration: FIG. 21.]    _To blow a Bulb between two Points_ (Fig 21).--Select a piece of  suitable tube, seal or cork one end, gather together a mass of glass at  the desired part, as directed for blowing a bulb at the end of a tube;  when a mass of glass has been collected of sufficient thickness, blow it  into shape from the open end of the tube by a rapid succession of short  blasts of air, till the expanding glass attains the desired dimensions.  The tube must be held horizontally, and must be rotated steadily during  the process. By slightly pressing together the glass while blowing, the  bulb will be flattened; by slightly drawing apart the two ends of the  tube, it will be elongated.    A pear-shaped bulb may be obtained by gently re-heating an elongated  bulb, say from _a_ to _a_, and drawing it out. It is easiest to perform  this operation on a bulb which is rather thick in the glass.    If the tubes _bb_ are to be small, and a globe of considerable size is  wanted, contract a tube as shown in Fig. 22, taking care that the narrow  portions of the tube are about the same axis as the wider portions, for  if this be not the case, the mouths of the bulb will not be  symmetrically placed; seal at _C_, cut off the wider tube at _B_, and  make the bulb, as previously described, from the glass between _AA_.  If, as probably will be the case, the contracted portions of the tube be  not very regular, they may be cut off, one at a time, near the bulb, and  replaced by pieces of tube of the size desired.    [Illustration: FIG. 22.]    When a bulb has to be blown upon a very fine tube, for example upon  thermometer tubing, the mouth should not be employed, for the moisture  introduced by the breath is extremely difficult to remove afterwards. A  small india-rubber bottle or reservoir, such as those which are used in  spray-producers, Galton's whistles, etc., securely attached to the open  end of the tube, should be used. With the help of these bottles bulbs  can be blown at the closed ends of fine tubes with ease, though some  care is necessary to produce them of good shape, as it is difficult to  rotate the hot glass properly when working in this way.      =Making and Grinding Stoppers.=--Apparatus which is to contain chemicals  that are likely to be affected by the free admission of air, needs to  have stoppers fitted to it. Making a good stopper is a much less tedious  process than is commonly supposed.    Suppose that the tube I. of Fig. 23 is to be stoppered at _A_, it must  be slightly enlarged by softening the end and opening it with a pointed  cone of charcoal; or a conical mouth for the stopper may be made by  slightly contracting the tube near one end, as at _B_, cutting off the  cylindrical end of the tube at the dotted line _C_, and then very  slightly expanding the end at _C_ with a charcoal cone after its edges  have been softened by heat. In either case the conical mouth should be  as long and regular as possible.    [Illustration: FIG. 23.]    For the stopper take a piece of rather thick tube, of such size that it  will pass easily, but not too easily, into _A_ or _B_. Expand this tube  at _D_, as shown in II., by softening the glass and gently compressing  it. The configuration of the enlarged tube as shown at _D_ may be  obtained by heating and compressing two or more zones of the tube that  are adjacent, one zone being less expanded than the other, so as to give  the sides of the imperfect stopper as nearly as possible the form shown  at _D_, which, however, is much less regular than may easily be  obtained. Seal off the head of the tube at _H_, and heat the glass till  it runs together into a nearly solid mass; compress this with a pair of  iron tongs to the flattened head _E_. In making _D_, aim at giving it a  form which will as nearly as possible correspond to that of the tube  into which it is to be ground, and make it slightly too large, so that  only the lower part at _D_ can be introduced into the mouth of _A_ or  _B_. Before it is ground, the stopper must be heated nearly to its  softening-point and annealed.    Moisten _D_ with a solution of camphor in recently distilled  turpentine, and dust the wet surface with finely-ground emery, then  gently grind it into its place till it fits properly. In this operation  the tail _G_, which should fit loosely into the tube _A_, will be of  assistance by preventing _D_ from unduly pressing in any direction on  _A_ in consequence of irregular movements. The stopper should be  completely rotated in grinding it. It must not be worked backwards and  forwards, or a well-fitting stopper will not be produced. Renew the  emery and camphorated turpentine frequently during the earlier part of  the grinding; when the stopper almost fits, avoid using fresh emery, but  continue to remove the stopper frequently at all stages of the  operation. That added at the earlier stages will be reduced to a state  of very fine division, and will therefore leave the stopper and mouth of  _A_ with smoother surfaces than fresh emery.[10]    [10] Mr. Gimmingham recommends giving stoppers a final polish with  rotten-stone (_Proceedings of the Royal Society_, p. 396, 1876).    NOTE.--The addition of camphor to the turpentine used for grinding glass  is very important. Notwithstanding its brittle nature, glass will work  under a file moistened with this solution almost as well as the metals.  Small quantities should be made at a time, and the solution should be  kept in a well-closed vessel, for after long exposure to the air it is  not equally valuable.    If the stopper is to fit a tube contracted like _B_, it must be  constructed from a piece of tube that will pass through the contraction  at _B_. The tail _GF_ will not do such good service as it does in the  case of a tube which has been opened out to receive its stopper, but it  will help to guide the stopper, and should be retained.    When the stopper has been ground into its place, melt off the tail at  _F_. The flame must be applied very cautiously, as glass which has been  ground is particularly apt to crack on heating. To avoid all risk of  this, the tail may simply be cut off, and its edges filed smooth with a  file moistened freely with camphorated turpentine.    The stoppers of bottles are not made exactly in the manner described  above, though, on occasion, a new stopper may be made for a bottle by  following those directions. Ill-fitting stoppers, which are very common,  can be very easily re-ground with emery and camphorated turpentine.          CHAPTER IV.    _MAKING THISTLE FUNNELS, U-TUBES, ETC.--COMBINING THE PARTS OF  COMPLICATED APPARATUS--MERCURY, AND OTHER AIR-TIGHT JOINTS--VACUUM  TAPS--SAFETY TAPS--AIR-TRAPS._      In Chapter III. the simpler operations used in making the separate parts  of which apparatus is composed have been described. In this Chapter  finished apparatus will be described, and the combination of the  separate parts into the more or less complicated arrangements used in  experiments will be so far explained as to enable the student to set up  such apparatus as he is likely to require. I have thought it would be  useful that I should add a short account of various contrivances that  have come much into use of late years for experimenting under reduced  pressure, such as safety taps, air-traps, vacuum joints, etc.    [Illustration: FIG. 24.]    =Electrodes.=--On page 38 (Fig. 13) is shown a simple form of electrode  sealed into a glass tube, which for many purposes answers very well. But  frequently, in order that there may be less risk of leakage between the  glass and the metal, the latter is covered for a considerable part of  its length with solid glass, which at one extremity is united to the  apparatus. In Fig. 24 _W_ is the metal core of the electrode, and _G_  the glass covering around it. The wire is fused into the glass, and the  glass is then united to the apparatus; a little white enamel should be  applied at one end and combined with the glass by fusion.      =U-Tubes.=--A U-tube is but a particular case of a bent glass tube. It  is scarcely possible when bending very large tubes in the manner  described on p. 29 to produce regular curves of sufficient strength.    To make a U-tube, or to bend a large tube, close one end of the tube  selected with a cork, soften and compress the glass in the flame at the  part where it is to be bent till a sufficient mass of glass for the bend  is collected, then remove the mass of glass from the flame, let it cool  a little, and simultaneously draw out the thickened glass, bend it to  the proper form, and blow the bend into shape from the open end of the  tube. Small irregularities may be partly corrected afterwards.    To make a good U-tube of large size, and of uniform diameter from end to  end, requires much"]]]
