Indeed, Churchill was always so precocious that I cannot recall the time  when he was young enough to be Lady Randolph's son; certainly, I cannot  recall the time when she was old enough to be his mother.    When first I knew him he had passed through Harrow and Sandhurst and was  a second lieutenant in the Queen's Own Hussars. He was just of age, but  appeared much younger.    He was below medium height, a slight, delicate-looking boy; although, as  a matter of fact, extremely strong, with blue eyes, many freckles, and  hair which threatened to be a decided red, but which now has lost its  fierceness. When he spoke it was with a lisp, which also has changed,  and which now appears to be merely an intentional hesitation.    His manner of speaking was nervous, eager, explosive. He used many  gestures, some of which were strongly reminiscent of his father, of  whom he, unlike most English lads, who shy at mentioning a distinguished  parent, constantly spoke.    He even copied his father in his little tricks of manner. Standing with  hands shoved under the frock-coat and one resting on each hip as though  squeezing in the waist line; when seated, resting the elbows on the arms  of the chair and nervously locking and unclasping fingers, are tricks  common to both.    He then had and still has a most embarrassing habit of asking many  questions; embarrassing, sometimes, because the questions are so frank,  and sometimes because they lay bare the wide expanse of one's own  ignorance.    At that time, although in his twenty-first year, this lad twice had been  made a question in the House of Commons.    That in itself had rendered him conspicuous. When you consider out of  Great Britain's four hundred million subjects how many live, die, and  are buried without at any age having drawn down upon themselves the  anger of the House of Commons, to have done so twice, before one has  passed his twenty-first year, seems to promise a lurid future.    The first time Churchill disturbed the august assemblage in which so  soon he was to become a leader was when he \"ragged\" a brother subaltern  named Bruce and cut up his saddle and accoutrements. The second time was  when he ran away to Cuba to fight with the Spaniards.    After this campaign, on the first night of his arrival in London, he  made his maiden speech. He delivered it in a place of less dignity  than the House of Commons, but one, throughout Great Britain and her  colonies, as widely known and as well supported. This was the Empire  Music Hall.    At the time Mrs. Ormiston Chant had raised objections to the presence in  the Music Hall of certain young women, and had threatened, unless they  ceased to frequent its promenade, to have the license of the Music Hall  revoked. As a compromise, the management ceased selling liquor, and  on the night Churchill visited the place the bar in the promenade was  barricaded with scantling and linen sheets. With the thirst of tropical  Cuba still upon him, Churchill asked for a drink, which was denied him,  and the crusade, which in his absence had been progressing fiercely,  was explained. Any one else would have taken no for his answer, and  have sought elsewhere for his drink. Not so Churchill. What he did is  interesting, because it was so extremely characteristic. Now he would  not do it; then he was twenty-one.    He scrambled to the velvet-covered top of the railing which divides  the auditorium from the promenade, and made a speech. It was a plea in  behalf of his \"Sisters, the Ladies of the Empire Promenade.\"    \"Where,\" he asked of the ladies themselves and of their escorts crowded  below him in the promenade, \"does the Englishman in London always find a  welcome? Where does he first go when, battle-scarred and travel-worn,  he reaches home? Who is always there to greet him with a smile, and  join him in a drink? Who is ever faithful, ever true--the Ladies of the  Empire Promenade.\"    The laughter and cheers that greeted this, and the tears of the ladies  themselves, naturally brought the performance on the stage to a stop,  and the vast audience turned in the seats and boxes.    They saw a little red-haired boy in evening clothes, balancing himself  on the rail of the balcony, and around him a great crowd, cheering,  shouting, and bidding him \"Go on!\"    Churchill turned with delight to the larger audience, and repeated his  appeal. The house shook with laughter and applause.    The commissionaires and police tried to reach him and a good-tempered  but very determined mob of well-dressed gentlemen and cheering girls  fought them back. In triumph Churchill ended his speech by begging his  hearers to give \"fair play\" to the women, and to follow him in a charge  upon the barricades.    The charge was instantly made, the barricades were torn down, and the  terrified management ordered that drink be served to its victorious  patrons.    Shortly after striking this blow for the liberty of others, Churchill  organized a dinner which illustrated the direction in which at that age  his mind was working, and showed that his ambition was already abnormal.  The dinner was given to those of his friends and acquaintances who \"were  under twenty-one years of age, and who in twenty years would control the  destinies of the British Empire.\"    As one over the age limit, or because he did not consider me an  empire-controlling force, on this great occasion, I was permitted to  be present. But except that the number of incipient empire-builders was  very great, that they were very happy, and that save the host himself  none of them took his idea seriously, I would not call it an evening of  historical interest. But the fact is interesting that of all the  boys present, as yet, the host seems to be the only one who to any  conspicuous extent is disturbing the destinies of Great Britain.  However, the others can reply that ten of the twenty years have not yet  passed.    When he was twenty-three Churchill obtained leave of absence from his  regiment, and as there was no other way open to him to see fighting, as  a correspondent he joined the Malakand Field Force in India.    It may be truthfully said that by his presence in that frontier war he  made it and himself famous. His book on that campaign is his best piece  of war reporting. To the civilian reader it has all the delight of one  of Kipling's Indian stories, and to writers on military subjects it is  a model. But it is a model very few can follow, and which Churchill  himself was unable to follow, for the reason that only once is it given  a man to be twenty-three years of age.    The picturesque hand-to-hand fighting, the night attacks, the charges up  precipitous hills, the retreats made carrying the wounded under constant  fire, which he witnessed and in which he bore his part, he never  again can see with the same fresh and enthusiastic eyes. Then it was  absolutely new, and the charm of the book and the value of the book are  that with the intolerance of youth he attacks in the service evils that  older men prefer to let lie, and that with the ingenuousness of youth he  tells of things which to the veteran have become unimportant, or which  through usage he is no longer even able to see.    In his three later war books, the wonder of it, the horror of it, the  quick admiration for brave deeds and daring men, give place, in \"The  River War,\" to the critical point of view of the military expert, and  in his two books on the Boer war to the rapid impressions of the  journalist. In these latter books he tells you of battles he has seen,  in the first one he made you see them.    For his services with the Malakand Field Force he received the campaign  medal with clasp, and, \"in despatches,\" Brigadier-General Jeffreys  praises \"the courage and resolution of Lieutenant W. L. S. Churchill,  Fourth Hussars, with the force as correspondent of the _Pioneer_.\"    From the operations around Malakand, he at once joined Sir William  Lockhart as orderly officer, and with the Tirah Expedition went through  that campaign.    For this his Indian medal gained a second clasp.    This was in the early part of 1898. In spite of the time taken up as  an officer and as a correspondent, he finished his book on the Malakand  Expedition and then, as it was evident Kitchener would soon attack  Khartum, he jumped across to Egypt and again as a correspondent took  part in the advance upon that city.    Thus, in one year, he had seen service in three campaigns.    On the day of the battle his luck followed him. Kitchener had attached  him to the Twenty-first Lancers, and it will be remembered the event of  the battle was the charge made by that squadron. It was no canter, no  easy \"pig-sticking\"; it was a fight to get in and a fight to get out,  with frenzied followers of the Khalifa hanging to the bridle reins,  hacking at the horses' hamstrings, and slashing and firing point-blank  at the troopers. Churchill was in that charge. He received the medal  with clasp.    Then he returned home and wrote \"The River War.\" This book is the last  word on the campaigns up the Nile. From the death of Gordon in Khartum  to the capture of the city by Kitchener, it tells the story of the many  gallant fights, the wearying failures, the many expeditions into the  hot, boundless desert, the long, slow progress toward the final winning  of the Sudan.    The book made a distinct sensation. It was a work that one would expect  from a lieutenant-general, when, after years of service in Egypt, he  laid down his sword to pen the story of his life's work. From a Second  Lieutenant, who had been on the Nile hardly long enough to gain the  desert tan, it was a revelation.

FONDANT CREAM WORK OR BUTTERCUP FILLING.    This branch of the business has developed wonderfully during the last  few years. This cream is not only moulded and worked into every  conceivable shape, size color and flavor by itself, but is used with  chocolate, fruits, etc., to make an endless variety of pleasing and  tasty confections. The smaller goods in this work form the body, and  sometimes the whole, of many beautiful mixtures, and no window can now  be considered orthodox unless they have a good display of these goods.  For our purpose the variety is a matter of detail which we only mention  to remind the reader that he must look for the greater part of it  outside the covers of this guide. The process is practically the same  all through; the mixing, flavors, colors and shapes make whatever  distinction there is. It will only be necessary to give a fair selection  of formulas to enable the reader to imitate anything he sees in this  line, or invent something new.    [Illustration: Fig. 15. a    Asbestos Gas Batch Warmer or Spinning Furnace.--Two Sizes.    32 inches long, price $15.00. Can be used in sections if desired.]      RASPBERRY & VANILLA FONDANTS.      10 lbs. White Sugar.    2-1/2 lbs. Glucose.    Raspberry and Vanilla Flavor.    3 pints water.    Carmine Color.    PROCESS.--Boil the sugar, glucose and water in the usual way to the  degree of soft ball; then remove the pan from the fire; damp the  pouring plate with cold water; pour the boil on it and let it remain  till nearly cold. With a long pallette knife or wooden spatula, commence  to work the syrup until it changes to a white glossy cream; then divide  the batch into two; put one part in the pan and remelt it, just enough  to make it a consistency to mould, add vanilla flavor and run it into  rubber moulds; now put the other portion in the pan and remelt; color it  a light pink; flavor with essence of raspberry and mould in the same  shapes; when the goods are set and cold crystalize them with cold syrup.    N.B.--Have everything very clean when making fondants; every speck will  show; a touch of blue will make the white a better color.      CHOCOLATE & VANILLA FONDANTS.      10 lbs White Sugar.    2-1/2 lbs. Glucose.    Vanilla Flavoring.    3 pints Water.    1/2 lb. Pure Chocolate.    PROCESS.--Prepare the fondant creams as in last recipe; when the boil  has been creamed, divide into two, one part being twice the size of the  other, put the small portion in the pan to remelt, adding the chocolate  paste; stir until paste is dissolved and incorporated, but do not let  the cream boil; remove the pan from the fire; run chocolate cream in  rubber moulds filling the impressions only one-third part full; then  melt the white cream, flavor with vanilla and fill up the moulds; when  set crystalize in cold syrup; each fondant will be in two colors, white  tipped with chocolate.    [Illustration: Fig. 15. Batch Warmer or Gas Candy Heater. Price $5.00.]      COCOANUT FONDANTS.      9 lbs. White Sugar.    2-1/2 lbs. Glucose.    1-1/2 lbs. Fine Desiccated Cocoanut, Unsweetened.    Carmine Color.    3 pints Water.    Lemon Flavoring.    PROCESS.--Proceed to make the cream as before directed and divide the  batch into two equal parts: remelt one part and stir in half the  desiccated cocoanut with a few drops of lemon; half fill moulds; remelt  the other portion of cream; stir in the remainder of the cocoanut; color  pink, adding a few drops of essence lemon, and fill up the moulds;  crystalize the usual way in cold syrup.      STRAWBERRY FONDANTS.      9 lbs. White Sugar.    2 lbs. Glucose.    Carmine Coloring.    2 lbs. Strawberry Jam.    3 pints Water.    PROCESS.--Boil the sugar, glucose and water to a soft ball degree, pour  the batch on pouring plate, which has been previously damped with cold  water, let the boil remain till nearly cold, then with a wooden spatula  work the syrup about till it becomes cream, then mix in jam; return the  whole to the pan and remelt, add sufficient color to make a bright pink,  then run into moulds; when set, crystalize in cold syrup.      CHERRY FONDANTS.      10 lbs. Sugar.    2-1/2 lbs. Glucose.    Cherry Flavor.    3 pints Water.    Carmine and Saffron Color.    PROCESS.--Select some large, preserved cherries, cut them in half. Boil  the sugar, glucose and water in the ordinary way to ball degree, pour  the batch on a damp pouring plate; when nearly cold work up the whole  with spatula till it becomes a white glossy cream, working the flavor in  at the same time; then divide into three equal portions, color one  portion a bright pink and another a yellow, leaving the third white;  knead each portion into stiff paste, adding a little icing sugar to make  it tough; pinch off small pieces and form them into balls about the size  of the cherry, make them a little flat on one side; on this flat part  stick a half cherry, squeezing them into shape; place them in canvas  trays and put them in the drying room for a few hours to harden;  afterwards crystalize with cold syrup. Other preserved fruits may be  used in same way.      FONDANTS FOR MIXTURES.      10 lbs. White Sugar.    2-1/2 lbs. Glucose.    Flavors Various.    3 pints Water.    Colors Various.    PROCESS.--Boil the sugar, glucose and water as before directed to a  stiff ball and pour the sugar on damp slab; let it stand till nearly  cold, then work it up with spatula till glossy cream; divide the boil  into as many portions as you want colors; then remelt this cream, color  and flavor to fancy; run the batch into moulds of different shapes. When  the fondants are set, crystalize in cold syrup. Fondants for mixture are  made a trifle harder to prevent being crushed with other sweets with  which they are mixed.      TO CRYSTALIZE FONDANTS      13 lbs. Best White Sugar.    4 pints Water.    PROCESS.--Boil this quantity of sugar and water for a few minutes, about  220 degrees by the thermometer; stand it aside undisturbed till quite  cold. Pack the fondants in crystalizing tins, putting wire trays between  each layer of say two inches deep; let the wire trays take a bearing on  the ends of the tin; when the tin is full, cover the goods with cold  syrup, putting a damp cloth over the top; stand the tins in a cool place  in the drying room about ten hours; then remove them to a cold place;  about an hour afterwards take out the plugs and drain off the  superfluous syrup; when the fondants are dry, turn the tins on end,  giving them a slight knock and empty them on clean trays; they will be  ready for packing in an hour or so.    N.B.--If a thin skin forms over the top of the syrup, skim it off before  draining the goods; it may tend to granulate them, but the damp cloth  ought to prevent this skin forming.      CHRISTMAS FANCIES--CLEAR TOY MOULDS.    There are a great number of fancies made from grain sugars sold about  Christmas time. Their beauty and attractiveness depends upon the moulds  in which they are moulded, and the taste displayed in painting or  decorating them. The goods themselves are quite a secondary  consideration, being so simple to make.    PROCESS.--Boil 7 lbs. sugar, 1 lb. glucose, 2 pints water in the usual  way to the degree of ball 250, by thermometer; remove it from the fire  and rub the sugar against the side of the pan until thick and white;  stir it all together, then fill the moulds through the runner. Too much  sugar must not be boiled at one time, or it will set before it can be  all run into the moulds; two or three pounds will be enough for a  beginner to practice with. They will be hard enough to be taken out of  the moulds in fifteen to thirty minutes, according to size after being  run, and they will be ready for decorating.      ARTIFICIAL FIGURES.    Fruit, eggs, and any object may be taken from nature by this process, to  be transformed into sugar, afterwards glazed, colored to imitate nature  so exactly as to deceive many persons. Boil the sugar in exactly the  same way as directed in the previous recipe, grain it and fill the  moulds; in a few minutes run out as much sugar as will leave the mould;  this will cause the casting to be hollow in the centre. Allow your  articles to imitate the natural objects which they represent with liquid  colors and camel's hair pencils; if gloss is required the colors should  be mixed with a strong solution of gum arabic or isinglass to the  desired tint.
