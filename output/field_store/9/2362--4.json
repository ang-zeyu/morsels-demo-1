[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30066"],[0,"Laboratory Manual of Glass-Blowing (#10)"],[1,") The end of the wire which is to be outside the tube is attached to  the end of a thin scrap of glass, by heating the glass and thrusting  the wire into it a very little way. Using this piece of glass as a  handle, the wire is inserted in the cut tail (_b_, Fig. 18) and the  globule brought near to the end of the tail. (If the main tube is cold,  it must of course first be warmed.) With the end of the hissing flame,  as in the first method, the globule of glass is melted and the end of  the tail softened. The wire is now pushed into place, the handle removed  by heating the end and withdrawing it, and the tail reheated a little if  necessary to make it shrink back into line with the walls of the tube.  The whole circumference of the tube is heated at that point and annealed  as usual.    [Illustration: FIG. 18.]    The use of this special glass is not absolutely necessary if the  platinum wire is small (1/4 millimeter or less in diameter), and in fact  it is often better in such cases not to use it, unless the apparatus is  to be subjected to a very high vacuum. On small tubes, especially, it is  undesirable to use the special glass, as a lump of it will usually cause  the tube to crack on cooling. When such glass is not at hand or is not  to be used, the procedure is altered somewhat. The tail which is drawn  out is very fine, having only a sufficient diameter so that when it is  cut off the wire can be inserted in it. Such a fine tail is readily made  by heating a small spot on the tube, touching it with a warm platinum  wire, removing from the flame and drawing out the tail with the wire.  After cutting off the tail the wire is inserted in it, being held on a  scrap of glass as in the previous case, and the wire and tail heated  until the latter shrinks back into line with the walls of the tube. If  too great shrinkage occurs, the place may be blown out gently after  reheating. Thus the wire is sealed through the wall of the tube without  changing the thickness of the latter, and consequently without  developing undue stresses at that point. Such a joint must of course be  carefully reheated and annealed. With fine platinum wire there is very  little risk of the tube cracking if care is taken to avoid formation of  any lump and to reheat the whole circumference of the tube at that  point.    Any glass adhering to the end of the platinum wire, where the scrap of  glass was sealed on for a handle, may be removed when the glass has  cooled by crushing it carefully with a pair of pliers.      SEALING VACUUM TUBES    Tubes which have been evacuated usually are sealed off while they are  still connected to the vacuum pump. The connection should be through a  small, rather thick-walled tube. When this is to be sealed, it is slowly  heated toward the softening point. As the glass just begins to soften,  the air-pressure will force it in, and care must be taken that the  softening is uniform over the whole circumference of the tube. As the  shrinking goes on, the tube is gently drawn out to make a thick-walled  cone at that place, and the end is drawn off as soon as the tube is  sealed. The principal point to be guarded is the thickness of the walls  of the cone, and uniform heating. A thin place or a hot place will give  way under the air-pressure and be sucked into the tube.      CLOSED TUBES FOR HEATING UNDER PRESSURE    (_Carius method for determination of the halogens and sulphur._) In this  case the tubing used must have thick walls (usually about 3/32 inch) to  withstand the pressure. Its external diameter is usually about 3/4 inch.  One length will usually make two tubes of standard length for the cannon  furnace. Especial care must be taken in heating and cooling it on  account of the thick walls. A length is gradually warmed in the center,  finally heated at that point until soft, drawn out, cut apart and  annealed. Taking one of the pieces, the cone is carefully heated and  shrunk, as in Exercise 4, until its walls are as thick as those of the  main tube. A flame with a little tinge of yellow should be used for this  operation to prevent devitrification (page 2), as the thick glass  shrinks slowly. The tail is now drawn off and the whole end heated and  gently blown several times to make a rounded end, like a test-tube, with  walls as thick as those of the main tube. This must be carefully  annealed. It is more important that the walls be thick than that the end  be nicely rounded: it may indeed be left somewhat conical in shape.    At a point about two inches from the open end of the tube, it is slowly  warmed and finally heated to the softening point. Grasping the open end  with a pair of crucible tongs, it is cautiously pulled out, a little at  a time, usually during rotation in the flame, to make a constriction of  moderate wall-thickness, but of sufficient internal diameter to admit  the tube containing the substance. After annealing this, cooling and  cleaning the tube, the acid and salt are introduced (the former by means  of a long-stemmed funnel) and the tube is inclined and rotated about its  axis so that the acid wets its surface about half way up from the  bottom. The substance is now weighed out in a piece of thin-walled glass  tubing, closed at one end, and about two inches long. Inclining the  large tube at a suitable angle, the small one is introduced, closed end  first, and allowed to slide down the walls of the large tube until it  reaches the place where the acid has wet the tube. Here it will stop,  and if the tube is kept inclined during the rest of the operation it  will roll around inside the tube at this point and thus not get down  where any acid is likely to get into it and produce any pressure by  decomposing it before the open end of the tube is sealed. Now the tube  is held in an inclined position, taking care that the acid does not  reach up to the substance, the constricted portion cautiously warmed and  shrunk. It is finally shrunk and drawn out into a somewhat elongated  cone, with walls as thick as the rest of the tube, and when this is  accomplished the end of the cone is sealed and the waste piece drawn  off. Anneal with great care, and cool in such a position that the acid  cannot reach the hot glass. The shrinking of this cone takes a good deal  of patience, and is one of the most important parts of the process. If  the walls are left too thin, the tube may burst when heated, and the  whole labor is lost. If care is taken, the same tube can be used for a  number of determinations, until it becomes quite short.

In their unmodified forms they look a lot alike,     and various kluges invented to make them visually distinct have     compounded the confusion. If your zero is center-dotted and letter-O     is not, or if letter-O looks almost rectangular but zero looks more     like an American football stood on end (or the reverse), you're     probably looking at a modern character display (though the dotted zero     seems to have originated as an option on IBM 3270 controllers). If     your zero is slashed but letter-O is not, you're probably looking at     an old-style ASCII graphic set descended from the default typewheel on     the venerable ASR-33 Teletype (Scandinavians, for whom Ø is a letter,     curse this arrangement). (Interestingly, the slashed zero long     predates computers; Florian Cajori's monumental \"A History of     Mathematical Notations\" notes that it was used in the twelfth and     thirteenth centuries.) If letter-O has a slash across it and the zero     does not, your display is tuned for a very old convention used at IBM     and a few other early mainframe makers (Scandinavians curse this     arrangement even more, because it means two of their letters collide).     Some Burroughs/Unisys equipment displays a zero with a reversed slash.     Old CDC computers rendered letter O as an unbroken oval and 0 as an     oval broken at upper right and lower left. And yet another convention     common on early line printers left zero unornamented but added a tail     or hook to the letter-O so that it resembled an inverted Q or cursive     capital letter-O (this was endorsed by a draft ANSI standard for how     to draw ASCII characters, but the final standard changed the     distinguisher to a tick-mark in the upper-left corner). Are we     sufficiently confused yet?       _________________________________________________________________       Node:1TBS, Next:[215]120 reset, Previous:[216]0, Up:[217]= 0 =       1TBS // n.
