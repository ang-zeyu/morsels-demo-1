The marriage of Henry IV. and Marie de  Medici, and the exquisite court-mourning for the afore-mentioned queen,  together with a few words let fall by M. de Bassompiere, king of the  _beaux_ of the period, made the fortune of the second generation of  Percerins. M. Concino Concini, and his wife Galligai, who subsequently  shone at the French court, sought to Italianize the fashion, and  introduced some Florentine tailors; but Percerin, touched to the  quick in his patriotism and his self-esteem, entirely defeated these  foreigners, and that so well that Concino was the first to give up his  compatriots, and held the French tailor in such esteem that he would  never employ any other, and thus wore a doublet of his on the very day  that Vitry blew out his brains with a pistol at the Pont du Louvre.    And so it was a doublet issuing from M. Percerin's workshop, which the  Parisians rejoiced in hacking into so many pieces with the living human  body it contained. Notwithstanding the favor Concino Concini had shown  Percerin, the king, Louis XIII., had the generosity to bear no malice to  his tailor, and to retain him in his service. At the time that Louis the  Just afforded this great example of equity, Percerin had brought up two  sons, one of whom made his _debut_ at the marriage of Anne of Austria,  invented that admirable Spanish costume, in which Richelieu danced a  saraband, made the costumes for the tragedy of \"Mirame,\" and stitched  on to Buckingham's mantle those famous pearls which were destined to  be scattered about the pavements of the Louvre. A man becomes easily  notable who has made the dresses of a Duke of Buckingham, a M. de  Cinq-Mars, a Mademoiselle Ninon, a M. de Beaufort, and a Marion de  Lorme. And thus Percerin the third had attained the summit of his glory  when his father died. This same Percerin III., old, famous and wealthy,  yet further dressed Louis XIV.; and having no son, which was a great  cause of sorrow to him, seeing that with himself his dynasty would end,  he had brought up several hopeful pupils. He possessed a carriage,  a country house, men-servants the tallest in Paris; and by special  authority from Louis XIV., a pack of hounds. He worked for MM. de Lyonne  and Letellier, under a sort of patronage; but politic man as he was, and  versed in state secrets, he never succeeded in fitting M. Colbert. This  is beyond explanation; it is a matter for guessing or for intuition.  Great geniuses of every kind live on unseen, intangible ideas; they act  without themselves knowing why. The great Percerin (for, contrary to  the rule of dynasties, it was, above all, the last of the Percerins who  deserved the name of Great), the great Percerin was inspired when he cut  a robe for the queen, or a coat for the king; he could mount a mantle  for Monsieur, the clock of a stocking for Madame; but, in spite of his  supreme talent, he could never hit off anything approaching a creditable  fit for M. Colbert. \"That man,\" he used often to say, \"is beyond my art;  my needle can never dot him down.\" We need scarcely say that Percerin  was M. Fouquet's tailor, and that the superintendent highly esteemed  him. M. Percerin was nearly eighty years old, nevertheless still fresh,  and at the same time so dry, the courtiers used to say, that he was  positively brittle. His renown and his fortune were great enough for  M. le Prince, that king of fops, to take his arm when talking over the  fashions; and for those least eager to pay never to dare to leave their  accounts in arrear with him; for Master Percerin would for the first  time make clothes upon credit, but the second never, unless paid for the  former order.    It is easy to see at once that a tailor of such renown, instead of  running after customers, made difficulties about obliging any fresh  ones. And so Percerin declined to fit _bourgeois_, or those who had but  recently obtained patents of nobility. A story used to circulate that  even M. de Mazarin, in exchange for Percerin supplying him with a full  suit of ceremonial vestments as cardinal, one fine day slipped letters  of nobility into his pocket.    It was to the house of this grand llama of tailors that D'Artagnan  took the despairing Porthos; who, as they were going along, said to his  friend, \"Take care, my good D'Artagnan, not to compromise the dignity  of a man such as I am with the arrogance of this Percerin, who will, I  expect, be very impertinent; for I give you notice, my friend, that if  he is wanting in respect I will infallibly chastise him.\"    \"Presented by me,\" replied D'Artagnan, \"you have nothing to fear, even  though you were what you are not.\"    \"Ah! 'tis because--\"    \"What? Have you anything against Percerin, Porthos?\"    \"I think that I once sent Mouston to a fellow of that name.\"    \"And then?\"    \"The fellow refused to supply me.\"    \"Oh, a misunderstanding, no doubt, which it will be now exceedingly easy  to set right. Mouston must have made a mistake.\"    \"Perhaps.\"    \"He has confused the names.\"    \"Possibly. That rascal Mouston never can remember names.\"    \"I will take it all upon myself.\"    \"Very good.\"    \"Stop the carriage, Porthos; here we are.\"    \"Here! how here? We are at the Halles; and you told me the house was at  the corner of the Rue de l'Arbre Sec.\"    \"'Tis true, but look.\"    \"Well, I do look, and I see--\"    \"What?\"    \"_Pardieu!_ that we are at the Halles!\"    \"You do not, I suppose, want our horses to clamber up on the roof of the  carriage in front of us?\"    \"No.\"    \"Nor the carriage in front of us to mount on top of the one in front of  it. Nor that the second should be driven over the roofs of the thirty or  forty others which have arrived before us.\"    \"No, you are right, indeed. What a number of people! And what are they  all about?\"    \"'Tis very simple. They are waiting their turn.\"    \"Bah! Have the comedians of the Hotel de Bourgogne shifted their  quarters?\"    \"No; their turn to obtain an entrance to M. Percerin's house.\"    \"And we are going to wait too?\"    \"Oh, we shall show ourselves prompter and not so proud.\"    \"What are we to do, then?\"    \"Get down, pass through the footmen and lackeys, and enter the tailor's  house, which I will answer for our doing, if you go first.\"    \"Come along, then,\" said Porthos.    They accordingly alighted and made their way on foot towards the  establishment. The cause of the confusion was that M. Percerin's doors  were closed, while a servant, standing before them, was explaining to  the illustrious customers of the illustrious tailor that just then M.  Percerin could not receive anybody. It was bruited about outside still,  on the authority of what the great lackey had told some great noble whom  he favored, in confidence, that M. Percerin was engaged on five costumes  for the king, and that, owing to the urgency of the case, he was  meditating in his office on the ornaments, colors, and cut of these five  suits. Some, contented with this reason, went away again, contented  to repeat the tale to others, but others, more tenacious, insisted  on having the doors opened, and among these last three Blue Ribbons,  intended to take parts in a ballet, which would inevitably fail unless  the said three had their costumes shaped by the very hand of the great  Percerin himself. D'Artagnan, pushing on Porthos, who scattered the  groups of people right and left, succeeded in gaining the counter,  behind which the journeyman tailors were doing their best to answer  queries. (We forgot to mention that at the door they wanted to put  off Porthos like the rest, but D'Artagnan, showing himself, pronounced  merely these words, \"The king's order,\" and was let in with his friend.)  The poor fellows had enough to do, and did their best, to reply to the  demands of the customers in the absence of their master, leaving  off drawing a stitch to knit a sentence; and when wounded pride, or  disappointed expectation, brought down upon them too cutting a rebuke,  he who was attacked made a dive and disappeared under the counter.  The line of discontented lords formed a truly remarkable picture. Our  captain of musketeers, a man of sure and rapid observation, took it all  in at a glance; and having run over the groups, his eye rested on a man  in front of him. This man, seated upon a stool, scarcely showed his head  above the counter that sheltered him. He was about forty years of age,  with a melancholy aspect, pale face, and soft luminous eyes. He was  looking at D'Artagnan and the rest, with his chin resting upon his hand,  like a calm and inquiring amateur. Only on perceiving, and doubtless  recognizing, our captain, he pulled his hat down over his eyes. It was  this action, perhaps, that attracted D'Artagnan's attention. If so,  the gentleman who had pulled down his hat produced an effect entirely  different from what he had desired. In other respects his costume was  plain, and his hair evenly cut enough for customers, who were not close  observers, to take him for a mere tailor's apprentice, perched behind  the board, and carefully stitching cloth or velvet. Nevertheless, this  man held up his head too often to be very productively employed with his  fingers. D'Artagnan was not deceived,--not he; and he saw at once that  if this man was working at anything, it certainly was not at velvet.    \"Eh!\" said he, addressing this man, \"and so you have become a tailor's  boy, Monsieur Moliere!\"    \"Hush, M. d'Artagnan!\" replied the man, softly, \"you will make them  recognize me.\"    \"Well, and what harm?\"    \"The fact is, there is no harm, but--\"    \"You were going to say there is no good in doing it either, is it not  so?\"    \"Alas! no; for I was occupied in examining some excellent figures.\"    \"Go on--go on, Monsieur Moliere.

Warm bath, cold bath, bandage of emplastrum de minio put on tight, so  as to compress the part. Cover the part with flannel. With oiled silk. Rub  it with common oil frequently. With ether. A blister. A warmer climate.  Venesection. A grain of calomel and a grain of opium for ten successive  nights. The Peruvian bark.    13. _Cicatrix vulnerum._ The scar after wounds. In the healing of ulcers  the matter is first thickened by increasing the absorption in them; and  then lessened, till all the matter is absorbed, which is brought by the  arteries, instead of being deposed in the ulcer.    M. M. This is promoted by bandage, by the sorbentia externally, as powder  of bark, white lead; solution of sugar of lead. And by the sorbentia  internally after evacuations. See Sect. XXXIII. 3. 2.    In those ulcers, which are made by the contact of external fire, the  violent action of the fibres, which occasions the pain, is liable to  continue, after the external heat is withdrawn. This should be relieved by  external cold, as of snow, salt and water recently mixed, ether, or spirits  of wine suffered to evaporate on the part.    The cicatrix of an ulcer generally proceeds from the edges of it; but in  large ones frequently from the middle, or commences in several places at  the same time; which probably contributes to the unevenness of large scars.    14. _Corneae obfuscatio._ Opacity of the cornea. There are few people, who  have passed the middle of life, who have not at some time suffered some  slight scratches or injuries of the cornea, which by not healing with a  perfectly smooth surface, occasion some refractions of light, which may be  conveniently seen in the following manner: fill a tea-saucer with cream and  tea, or with milk, and holding it to your lips, as if going to drink it,  the imperfections of the cornea will appear like lines or blotches on the  surface of the fluid, with a less white appearance than that surface. Those  blemishes of the eye are distinguished from the muscae volitantes described  in Class I. 2. 5. 3. by their being invariably seen at any time, when you  look for them.    Ulcers may frequently be seen on the cornea after ophthalmy, like little  pits or indentations beneath the surface of it: in this case no external  application should be used, lest the scar should be left uneven; but the  cure should be confined to the internal use of thirty grains of bark twice  a day, and from five to ten drops of laudanum at night, with five grains of  rhubarb, if necessary.    After ulcers of the cornea, which have been large, the inequalities and  opacity of the cicatrix obscures the sight; in this case could not a small  piece of the cornea be cut out by a kind of trephine about the size of a  thick bristle, or a small crow-quill, and would it not heal with a  transparent scar? This experiment is worth trying, and might be done by a  piece of hollow steel wire with a sharp edge, through which might be  introduced a pointed steel screw; the screw to be introduced through the  opake cornea to hold it up, and press it against the cutting edge of the  hollow wire or cylinder; if the scar should heal without losing its  transparency, many blind people might be made to see tolerably well by this  slight and not painful operation. An experiment I wish strongly to  recommend to some ingenious surgeon or oculist.           *       *       *       *       *    ORDO I.    _Increased Irritation._    GENUS IV.    _With increased Actions of other Cavities and Membranes._    SPECIES.    1. _Nictitatio irritativa._ Winking of the eyes is performed every minute  without our attention, for the purpose of cleaning and moistening the  eye-ball; as further spoken of in Class II. 1. 1. 8. When the cornea  becomes too dry, it becomes at the same time less transparent; which is  owing to the pores of it being then too large, so that the particles of  light are refracted by the edges of each pore, instead of passing through  it; in the same manner as light is refracted by passing near the edge of a  knife. When these pores are filled with water, the cornea becomes again  transparent. This want of transparency of the cornea is visible sometimes  in dying people, owing to their inirritability, and consequent neglect of  nictitation.    The increase of transparency by filling the pores with fluid is seen by  soaking white paper in oil; which from an opake body becomes very  transparent, and accounts for a curious atmospheric phenomenon; when there  exists a dry mist in a morning so as to render distant objects less  distinct, it is a sign of a dry day; when distant objects are seen very  distinct, it is a sign of rain. See Botan. Garden, Part I. add. note xxv.  The particles of air are probably larger than those of water, as water will  pass through leather and paper, which will confine air; hence when the  atmosphere is much deprived of moisture, the pores of the dry air are so  large, that the rays of light are refracted by their edges instead of  passing through them. But when as much moisture is added as can be  perfectly dissolved, the air becomes transparent; and opake again, when a  part of this moisture collects into small spherules previous to its  precipitation. This also accounts for the want of transparency of the air,  which is seen in tremulous motions over corn-fields on hot summer-days, or  over brick-kilns, after the flame is extinguished, while the furnace still  remains hot.    2. _Deglutitio irritativa._ The deglutition of our saliva is performed  frequently without our attention, and is then an irritative action in  consequence of the stimulus of it in the mouth. Or perhaps sometimes for  the purpose of diffusing a part of it over the dry membranes of the fauces  and pharinx; in the same manner as tears are diffused over the cornea of  the eye by the act of nictitation to clean or moisten it.    3. _Respiratio et Tussis irritativae._ In the acts of respiration and of  coughing there is an increased motion of the air-cells of the lungs owing  to some stimulating cause, as described above in Class I. 1. 2. 8. and I.  1. 3. 4. and which are frequently performed without our attention or  consciousness, and are then irritative actions; and thus differ from those  described in Class II. 1. 1. 2. and 5. To these increased actions of the  air-cells are superadded those of the intercostal muscles and diaphragm by  irritative association. When any unnatural stimulus acts so violently on  the organs of respiration as to induce pain, the sensorial power of  sensation becomes added to that of irritation, and inflammation of the  membranes of them is a general consequence.    4. _Exclusio bilis._ The exclusion of the bile from the gall-bladder, and  its derivation into the duodenum, is an irritative action in consequence of  the stimulus of the aliment on the extremity of the biliary duct, which  terminates in the intestine. The increased secretion of tears is occasioned  in a similar manner by any stimulating material in the eyes; which affects  the excretory ducts of the lacrymal glands. A pain of the external membrane  of the eye sometimes attends any unusual stimulus of it, then the sensorial  power of sensation becomes added to that of irritation, and a superficial  inflammation is induced.    5. _Dentitio._ Toothing. The pain of toothing often begins much earlier  than is suspected; and is liable to produce convulsions; which are  sometimes relieved, when the gum swells, and becomes inflamed; at other  times a diarrhoea supervenes, which is generally esteemed a favourable  circumstance, and seems to prevent the convulsions by supplying another  means of relieving the pain of dentition by irritative exertion; and a  consequent temporary exhaustion of sensorial power. See Class I. 1. 2. 5.  Sect. XXXV. 2. 1.    The convulsions from toothing generally commence long before the appearance  of the teeth; but as the two middle incisors of the lower jaw generally  appear first, and then those of the upper, it is adviseable to lance the  gums over these longitudinally in respect to the jaw-bones, and quite down  to the periosteum, and through it.    As the convulsions attending the commencement of toothing are not only  dangerous to life in their greatest degree, but are liable to induce stupor  or insensibility by their continuance even in a less degree, the most  efficacious means should be used to cure them.    M. M. Lance the gum of the expected teeth quite through the periosteum  longitudinally. Venesection by the lancet or by two or three leeches. One  grain of calomel as a purge. Tincture of jalap, five or six drops in water  every three hours til it purges, to be repeated daily. After evacuations a  small blister on the back or behind the ears. And lastly, two or three  drops of laudanum according to the age of the child. Warm bath. See Class  III. 1. 1. 5. and 6.    6. _Priapismus chronicus._ I have seen two cases, where an erection of the  penis, as hard as horn, continued two or three weeks without any venereal  desires, but not without some pain; the easiest attitude of the patients  was lying upon their backs with their knees up. At length the corpus  cavernosum urethrae became soft, and in another day or two the whole  subsided. In one of them a bougie was introduced, hoping to remove some bit  of gravel from the caput gallinaginis, camphor, warm bathing, opium,  lime-water, cold aspersion, bleeding in the veins of the penis, were tried  in vain. One of them had been a free drinker, had much gutta rosacea on his  face, and died suddenly a few months after his recovery from this  complaint. Was it a paralysis of the terminations of the veins, which  absorb the blood from the tumid penis? or from the stimulus of indurated  semen in the seminal vessels? In the latter case some venereal desires  should have attended. Class III. 1. 2. 16.    The priapismus, which occurs to vigorous "]]]
