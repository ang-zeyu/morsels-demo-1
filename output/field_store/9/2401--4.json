The  Singer company's acquisition of the Bachelder patent had given them  control of the yielding pressure bar also.    [Illustration: Figure 33.--SINGER FAMILY MACHINE, 1858, head only.  (Smithsonian photo 45524-F.)]    Singer's aggressive selling had begun to overcome the public's suspicion  of sewing machines. He pioneered in the use of lavishly decorated  sewing-machine showrooms when the company offices were expanded in the  mid-1850s (fig. 30). These were rich with carved walnut furniture,  gilded ornaments, and carpeted floors, places in which Victorian women  were not ashamed to be seen. The machines were demonstrated by pretty  young women. The total effect was a new concept of selling, and Singer  became the drum major of a new and coming industry that had many  followers (see fig. 31).    [Illustration: Figure 34.--GROVER AND BAKER'S PATENT MODEL, 1851.  (Smithsonian photo 32003-G.)]    The first, light, family sewing machine by the Singer company was not  manufactured until 1858 (figs. 32 and 33). Comparatively few of these  machines were made as they proved to be too small and light. The men in  the shop dubbed the machine \"The Grasshopper,\" but it was officially  called the new Family Sewing Machine or the Family Machine.[61] Because  of its shape, Singer company brochures of the 1920s referred to it as  the Turtleback Machine.    Since the cost of sewing machines was quite high and the average family  income was low, Clark suggested the adoption of the hire-purchase plan.  Into the American economy thus came the now-familiar installment  buying.    Singer and Clark continued to be partners until 1863 when a corporation  was formed. At this time Singer decided to withdraw from active work. He  received 40 percent of the stock and retired to Paris and later to  England, where he died in 1875.    [Illustration: Figure 35.--THIS GROVER AND BAKER CABINET-STYLE SEWING  MACHINE of 1856 bears the serial number 5675 and the patent dates  February 11, 1851, June 22, 1852, February 22, 1853, and May 27, 1856.  (Smithsonian photo 45572-F.)]    By the mid-1850s the basic elements of a successful, practical sewing  machine were at hand, but the continuing court litigation over rival  patent rights seemed destined to ruin the economics of the new industry.  It was then that the lawyer of the Grover and Baker company, another  sewing-machine manufacturer of the early 1850s, supplied the solution.  Grover and Baker were manufacturing a machine that was mechanically  good, for this early period. William O. Grover was another Boston  tailor, who, unlike many others, was convinced that the sewing machine  was going to revolutionize his chosen trade. Although the sewing  machines that he had seen were not very practical, he began in 1849 to  experiment with an idea based on a new kind of stitch. His design was  for a machine that would take both its threads from spools and eliminate  the need to wind one thread upon a bobbin. After much experimenting, he  proved that it was possible to make a seam by interlocking two threads  in a succession of slipknots, but he found that building a machine to do  this was a much more difficult task. It is quite surprising that while  he was working on this idea, he did not stumble upon a good method to  produce the single-thread (as opposed to Grover and Baker's two-thread)  chainstitch, later worked out by another. Grover was working so intently  on the use of two threads that apparently no thought of forming a stitch  with one thread had a chance to develop.    At this time Grover became a partner with another Boston tailor,  William E. Baker, and on February 11, 1851, they were issued U.S. patent  No. 7,931 for a machine that did exactly what Grover had set out to do;  it made a double chainstitch with two threads both carried on ordinary  thread spools. The machine (figs. 34 and 35) used a vertical eye-pointed  needle for the top thread and a horizontal needle for the underthread.  The cloth was placed on the horizontal platform or table, which had a  hole for the entry of the vertical needle. When this needle passed  through the cloth, it formed a loop on the underside. The horizontal  needle passed through this loop forming another loop beyond, which was  retained until the redescending vertical needle enchained it, and the  process repeated. The slack in the needle thread was controlled by means  of a spring guide. The cloth was fed by feeding rolls and a band.    [Illustration: Figure 36.--GROVER'S PATENT MODEL FOR THE FIRST PORTABLE  CASE, 1856. The machine in the case is a commercial machine of 1854,  bearing the serial number 3012 and the patent dates \"Feby 11, 1851, June  22, 1852, Feby 22, 1853.\" Powered by a single, foot-shaped treadle that  was connected by a removable wooden pitman, it also could be turned by  hand. (Smithsonian photo 45525-D.)]    A company was organized under the name of Grover and Baker Sewing  Machine Company, and soon the partners took Jacob Weatherill, mechanic,  and Orlando B. Potter, lawyer (who became the president), into the firm.  Potter contributed his ability as a lawyer in lieu of a financial  investment and handled the several succeeding patents of Grover and  Baker. These patents were primarily for mechanical improvements such as  U.S. patent No. 9,053 issued to Grover and Baker on June 22, 1852, for  devising a curved upper needle and an under looper[62] to form the  double-looped stitch which became known as the Grover and Baker stitch.  One of the more interesting of the patents, however, was for the box or  sewing case for which Grover was issued U.S. patent No. 14,956 on May  27, 1856. The inventor stated \"that when open the box shall constitute  the bed for the machine to be operated upon, and hanging the machine  thereto to facilitate oiling, cleansing, and repairs without removing it  from the box.\" It was the first portable sewing machine (fig. 36).    Though the Grover and Baker company manufactured machines using a  shuttle and producing the more common lockstitch, both under royalty in  their own name and also for other smaller companies, Potter was  convinced that the Grover and Baker stitch was the one that eventually  would be used in both family and commercial machines. He, as president,  directed the efforts of the company to that end. When the basic patents  held by the \"Sewing-Machine Combination\" (discussed on pp. 41-42) began  to run out in the mid-1870s, dissolving its purpose and lowering the  selling price of sewing machines, the Grover and Baker company began a  systematic curtailing of expenses and closing of branch offices. All the  patents held by the company and the business itself were sold to  another company.[63] But the members of the Grover and Baker company  fared well financially by the strategic move.    The Grover and Baker machine and its unique stitch did not have a great  influence on the overall development of the mechanics of machine sewing.  The merits of a double-looped stitch--its elasticity and the taking of  both threads from commercial spools--were outweighed by the bulkiness of  the seam and its consumption of three times as much thread as the  lockstitch required. Machines making a similar type of stitch have  continued in limited use in the manufacture of knit goods and other  products requiring an elastic seam. But, more importantly, Grover and  Baker's astute Orlando B. Potter placed their names in the annals of  sewing-machine history by his work in forming the \"Combination,\"  believed to be the first \"trust\" of any prominence.

Meanwhile, the sullen grey of the eastern clouds began to blush, then to  redden, and then to glow with a thousand colours, till the golden light  darted over all the air, touched the lower points of the mountain's  brow, and glanced in long sloping beams upon the valley and its stream.  All nature seemed to have awakened from death into life; the spirit of  St. Aubert was renovated. His heart was full; he wept, and his thoughts  ascended to the Great Creator.    Emily wished to trip along the turf, so green and bright with dew, and  to taste the full delight of that liberty, which the izard seemed to  enjoy as he bounded along the brow of the cliffs; while Valancourt often  stopped to speak with the travellers, and with social feeling to point  out to them the peculiar objects of his admiration. St. Aubert was  pleased with him: 'Here is the real ingenuousness and ardour of youth,'  said he to himself; 'this young man has never been at Paris.'    He was sorry when they came to the spot where the roads parted, and his  heart took a more affectionate leave of him than is usual after so short  an acquaintance. Valancourt talked long by the side of the carriage;  seemed more than once to be going, but still lingered, and appeared to  search anxiously for topics of conversation to account for his delay. At  length he took leave. As he went, St. Aubert observed him look with an  earnest and pensive eye at Emily, who bowed to him with a countenance  full of timid sweetness, while the carriage drove on. St. Aubert, for  whatever reason, soon after looked from the window, and saw Valancourt  standing upon the bank of the road, resting on his pike with folded  arms, and following the carriage with his eyes. He waved his hand, and  Valancourt, seeming to awake from his reverie, returned the salute, and  started away.    The aspect of the country now began to change, and the travellers soon  found themselves among mountains covered from their base nearly to their  summits with forests of gloomy pine, except where a rock of granite shot  up from the vale, and lost its snowy top in the clouds. The rivulet,  which had hitherto accompanied them, now expanded into a river; and,  flowing deeply and silently along, reflected, as in a mirror, the  blackness of the impending shades. Sometimes a cliff was seen lifting  its bold head above the woods and the vapours, that floated mid-way down  the mountains; and sometimes a face of perpendicular marble rose from  the water's edge, over which the larch threw his gigantic arms, here  scathed with lightning, and there floating in luxuriant foliage.    They continued to travel over a rough and unfrequented road, seeing now  and then at a distance the solitary shepherd, with his dog, stalking  along the valley, and hearing only the dashing of torrents, which the  woods concealed from the eye, the long sullen murmur of the breeze,  as it swept over the pines, or the notes of the eagle and the vulture,  which were seen towering round the beetling cliff.    Often, as the carriage moved slowly over uneven ground, St. Aubert  alighted, and amused himself with examining the curious plants that grew  on the banks of the road, and with which these regions abound; while  Emily, wrapt in high enthusiasm, wandered away under the shades,  listening in deep silence to the lonely murmur of the woods.    Neither village nor hamlet was seen for many leagues; the goat-herd's or  the hunter's cabin, perched among the cliffs of the rocks, were the only  human habitations that appeared.    The travellers again took their dinner in the open air, on a pleasant  spot in the valley, under the spreading shade of cedars; and then set  forward towards Beaujeu.    The road now began to descend, and, leaving the pine forests behind,  wound among rocky precipices. The evening twilight again fell over the  scene, and the travellers were ignorant how far they might yet be from  Beaujeu. St. Aubert, however, conjectured that the distance could not be  very great, and comforted himself with the prospect of travelling on a  more frequented road after reaching that town, where he designed to pass  the night. Mingled woods, and rocks, and heathy mountains were now seen  obscurely through the dusk; but soon even these imperfect images faded  in darkness. Michael proceeded with caution, for he could scarcely  distinguish the road; his mules, however, seemed to have more sagacity,  and their steps were sure.    On turning the angle of a mountain, a light appeared at a distance, that  illumined the rocks, and the horizon to a great extent. It was evidently  a large fire, but whether accidental, or otherwise, there were no means  of knowing. St. Aubert thought it was probably kindled by some of the  numerous banditti, that infested the Pyrenees, and he became watchful  and anxious to know whether the road passed near this fire. He had arms  with him, which, on an emergency, might afford some protection, though  certainly a very unequal one, against a band of robbers, so desperate  too as those usually were who haunted these wild regions. While many  reflections rose upon his mind, he heard a voice shouting from the road  behind, and ordering the muleteer to stop. St. Aubert bade him proceed  as fast as possible; but either Michael, or his mules were obstinate,  for they did not quit the old pace. Horses' feet were now heard; a man  rode up to the carriage, still ordering the driver to stop; and St.  Aubert, who could no longer doubt his purpose, was with difficulty able  to prepare a pistol for his defence, when his hand was upon the door of  the chaise. The man staggered on his horse, the report of the pistol was  followed by a groan, and St. Aubert's horror may be imagined, when in  the next instant he thought he heard the faint voice of Valancourt.  He now himself bade the muleteer stop; and, pronouncing the name of  Valancourt, was answered in a voice, that no longer suffered him to  doubt. St. Aubert, who instantly alighted and went to his assistance,  found him still sitting on his horse, but bleeding profusely, and  appearing to be in great pain, though he endeavoured to soften the  terror of St. Aubert by assurances that he was not materially hurt, the  wound being only in his arm. St. Aubert, with the muleteer, assisted him  to dismount, and he sat down on the bank of the road, where St. Aubert  tried to bind up his arm, but his hands trembled so excessively that he  could not accomplish it; and, Michael being now gone in pursuit of the  horse, which, on being disengaged from his rider, had galloped off,  he called Emily to his assistance. Receiving no answer, he went to the  carriage, and found her sunk on the seat in a fainting fit. Between the  distress of this circumstance and that of leaving Valancourt bleeding,  he scarcely knew what he did; he endeavoured, however, to raise her,  and called to Michael to fetch water from the rivulet that flowed by the  road, but Michael was gone beyond the reach of his voice. Valancourt,  who heard these calls, and also the repeated name of Emily, instantly  understood the subject of his distress; and, almost forgetting his own  condition, he hastened to her relief. She was reviving when he  reached the carriage; and then, understanding that anxiety for him had  occasioned her indisposition, he assured her, in a voice that trembled,  but not from anguish, that his wound was of no consequence. While he  said this St. Aubert turned round, and perceiving that he was still  bleeding, the subject of his alarm changed again, and he hastily formed  some handkerchiefs into a bandage. This stopped the effusion of the  blood; but St. Aubert, dreading the consequence of the wound, enquired  repeatedly how far they were from Beaujeu; when, learning that it was  at two leagues' distance, his distress increased, since he knew not how  Valancourt, in his present state, would bear the motion of the carriage,  and perceived that he was already faint from loss of blood. When he  mentioned the subject of his anxiety, Valancourt entreated that he would  not suffer himself to be thus alarmed on his account, for that he had no  doubt he should be able to support himself very well; and then he talked  of the accident as a slight one. The muleteer being now returned with  Valancourt's horse, assisted him into the chaise; and, as Emily was now  revived, they moved slowly on towards Beaujeu.    St. Aubert, when he had recovered from the terror occasioned him by this  accident, expressed surprise on seeing Valancourt, who explained  his unexpected appearance by saying, 'You, sir, renewed my taste for  society; when you had left the hamlet, it did indeed appear a solitude.  I determined, therefore, since my object was merely amusement, to change  the scene; and I took this road, because I knew it led through a more  romantic tract of mountains than the spot I have left. Besides,' added  he, hesitating for an instant, 'I will own, and why should I not? that I  had some hope of overtaking you.'    'And I have made you a very unexpected return for the compliment,'  said St. Aubert, who lamented again the rashness which had produced  the accident, and explained the cause of his late alarm. But Valancourt  seemed anxious only to remove from the minds of his companions every  unpleasant feeling relative to himself; and, for that purpose, still  struggled against a sense of pain, and tried to converse with gaiety.  Emily meanwhile was silent, except when Valancourt particularly  addressed her, and there was at those times a tremulous tone in his  voice that spoke much.    They were now so near the fire, which had long flamed at a distance on  the blackness of night, that it gleamed upon the road, and they could  distinguish figures moving about the blaze. The way winding still  nearer, they perceived in the valley one of those numerous bands of  gipsies, which at that period"]]]
