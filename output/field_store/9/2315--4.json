He  bawled aloud in brazen, ringing tones: \"Anybody want a F-I-G-H-T  t-t-t-t!!\"    I extemporized a horn and answered him according to his mood. \"_Yes, I  do; bring it ALONG!_\" and he brought it at a trot, squealing and roaring  as he came. When he got within forty yards he left the cover and  approached me, a perfect incarnation of brute ferocity and hate.    [Illustration]    His ears were laid back, his muzzle raised, his nose curled up, his  lower teeth exposed, his mane was bristling and in his eyes there blazed  a marvellous fire of changing opalescent green. On he marched, gritting  his teeth and uttering a most unpleasantly wicked squeal.    Then suddenly down went his head, and he came crash at me, with all the  power of half a ton of hate. However, I was not so much exposed as may  have been inferred. I was safely up a tree. And there I sat watching  that crazy bull as he prodded the trunk with his horns, and snorted, and  raved around, telling me just what he thought of me, inviting him to a  fight and then getting up a tree. Finally he went off roaring and  gritting his teeth, but turning back to cast on me from time to time the  deadly, opaque green light of his mad, malignant eyes.    A friend of mine, John Fossum, once a soldier attached to Fort  Yellowstone, had a similar adventure on a more heroic scale. While out  on a camera hunt in early winter he descried afar a large bull Elk lying  asleep in an open valley. At once Fossum made a plan. He saw that he  could crawl up to the bull, snap him where he lay, then later secure a  second picture as the creature ran for the timber. The first part of  the programme was carried out admirably. Fossum got within fifty feet  and still the Elk lay sleeping. Then the camera was opened out. But  alas! that little _pesky_ \"click,\" that does so much mischief, awoke the  bull, who at once sprang to his feet and ran--not for the woods--but  _for the man_. Fossum with the most amazing nerve stood there quietly  focussing his camera, till the bull was within ten feet, then pressed  the button, threw the camera into the soft snow and ran for his life  with the bull at his coat-tails. It would have been a short run but for  the fact that they reached a deep snowdrift that would carry the man,  and would not carry the Elk. Here Fossum escaped, while the bull snorted  around, telling just what he meant to do to the man when he caught him;  but he was not to be caught, and at last the bull went off grumbling and  squealing.    The hunter came back, recovered his camera, and when the plate was  developed it bore the picture No. xiv, b.    [Illustration: XIV. Elk on the Yellowstone in winter: (a) Caught in  eight feet of snow; _Photo by F. Jay Haynes_ (b) Bull Elk charging  _Photo by John Fossum_]    It shows plainly the fighting light in the bull's eye, the back laid  ears, the twisting of the nose, and the rate at which he is coming is  evidenced in the stamping feet and the wind-blown whiskers, and yet in  spite of the peril of the moment, and the fact that this was a hand  camera, there is no sign of shake on landscape or on Elk, and the  picture is actually over-exposed.      THE HOODOO COW    One of the best summer ranges for Elk is near the southeast corner of  the Yellowstone Lake, and here it was my luck to have the curious  experience that I call the \"Story of a Hoodoo Elk.\"    [Illustration]    In the September of 1912, when out with Tom Newcomb of Gardiner, I had  this curious adventure, that I shall not try to explain. We had crossed  the Yellowstone Lake in a motor boat and were camped on the extreme  southeast Finger, at a point twenty-five miles as the crow flies, and  over fifty as the trail goes, from any human dwelling. We were in the  least travelled and most primitive part of the Park. The animals here  are absolutely in the wild condition and there was no one in the region  but ourselves.    On Friday, September 6th, we sighted some Elk on the lake shore at  sunrise, but could not get nearer than two hundred yards, at which  distance I took a poor snap. The Elk wheeled and ran out of sight. I set  off on foot with the guide about 8:30. We startled one or two Elk, but  they were very wild, and I got no chance to photograph.    About 10:30, when several miles farther in the wilderness, we sighted a  cow Elk standing in a meadow with a Coyote sneaking around about one  hundred yards away. \"That's my Elk,\" I said, and we swung under cover.  By keeping in a little pine woods, I got within one hundred yards,  taking picture No. 1, Plate XV. As she did not move, I said to Tom: \"You  stay here while I creep out to that sage brush and I'll get a picture of  her at fifty yards.\" By crawling on my hands I was able to do this and  got picture No. 2. Now I noticed a bank of tall grass some thirty yards  from the cow, and as she was still quiet, I crawled to that and got  picture No. 3. She did not move and I was near enough to see that she  was dozing in a sun-bath. So I stood up and beckoned to Tom to come out  of the woods at once. He came on nearly speechless with amazement. \"What  is the meaning of this?\" he whispered.    [Illustration: XV. The first shots at the Hoodoo Cow  _Photos by E. T. Seton_]    I replied calmly: \"I told you I was a medicine man, perhaps you'll  believe me now. Don't you see I've made Elk medicine and got her  hypnotized? Now I am going to get up to about twenty yards and take her  picture. While I do so, you use the second camera and take me in the  act.\" So Tom took No. 4 while I was taking No. 5, and later No. 6.    \"Now,\" I said, \"let's go and talk to her.\" We walked up to within ten  yards. The Elk did not move, so I said: \"Well, Bossie, you have callers.  Won't you please look this way?\" She did so and I secured shot No. 7,  Plate XVI.    \"Thank you,\" I said. \"Now be good enough to lie down.\" She did, and I  took No. 9.    I went up and stroked her, so did Tom; then giving her a nudge of my  foot I said: \"Now stand up again and look away.\"    She rose up, giving me Nos. 8, 10 and 11.    \"Thank you, Bossie! now you can go!\" And as she went off I fired my last  film, getting No. 12.    [Illustration: XVI. The last shots at the Hoodoo Cow  _Photos by E. T. Seton_]    By this time Tom had used up all his allowable words, and was falling  back on the contraband kind to express his surging emotions.    \"What the ---- is the ---- meaning ---- of this ----?\" and so on.    I replied calmly: \"Maybe you'll believe I have Elk medicine. Now show me  a Moose and I'll give you some new shocks.\"    Our trip homeward occupied a couple of hours, during which I heard  little from Tom but a snort or two of puzzlement.    As we neared camp he turned on me suddenly and said: \"Now, Mr. Seton,  what _is_ the meaning of this? That wasn't a sick Elk; she was fat and  hearty. She wasn't poisoned or doped, 'cause there's no possibility of  that. It wasn't a tame Elk, 'cause there ain't any, and, anyhow, we're  seventy miles from a house. Now what is the meaning of it?\"    I replied solemnly: \"Tom! I don't know any more than you do. I was as  much surprised as you were at everything but one, and that was when she  lay down. I didn't tell her to lie down till I saw she was going to do  it, or to get up either, or look the other way, and if you can explain  the incident, you've got the field to yourself.\"      THE MOOSE, THE BIGGEST OF ALL DEER    The Moose is one of the fine animals that have responded magnificently  to protection in Canada, Maine, Minnesota, and the Yellowstone Park.  Formerly they were very scarce in Wyoming and confined to the southwest  corner of the Reserve. But all they needed was a little help; and,  receiving it, they have flourished and multiplied. Their numbers have  grown by natural increase from about fifty in 1897 to some five hundred  and fifty to-day; and they have spread into all the southern half of the  Park wherever they find surroundings to their taste; that is, thick  level woods with a mixture of timber, as the Moose is a brush-eater,  and does not flourish on a straight diet of evergreen.    The first Deer, almost the only one I ever killed, was a Moose and that  was far back in the days of my youth. On the Yellowstone, I am sorry to  say, I never saw one, although I found tracks and signs in abundance  last September near the Lake.      MY PARTNER'S MOOSE-HUNT    Though I have never since fired at a Moose, I was implicated in the  killing of one a few years later.    It was in the fall of the year, in the Hunting Moon, I was in the  Kippewa Country with my partner and some chosen friends on a camping  trip. Our companions were keen to get a Moose; and daily all hands but  myself were out with the expert Moose callers. But each night the  company reassembled around the campfire only to exchange their stories  of failure.    [Illustration]    Moose there were in plenty, and good guides, Indian, halfbreed and  white, but luck was against them all. Without being a very expert caller  I have done enough of it to know the game and to pass for a \"caller.\" So  one night I said in a spirit of half jest: \"I'll have to go out and show  you men how to call a Moose.\" I cut a good piece of birch-bark and  fashioned carefully a horn. Disdaining all civilized materials as  \"bad medicine,\" I stitched the edge with a spruce root or wattap, and  soldered it neatly with pine gum flowed and smoothed with a blazing  brand. And then I added the finishing touch, a touch which made the  Indian and the halfbreed shake their heads ominously; I drew two \"hoodoo  Moose\"--that is, men with Moose heads dancing around the horn.

Good deeds are based on creed from heaven sent,      In which, in turn, the sap of deeds must be.        Each creature borrows, lends, and gives with love,        Nor e'er disputes, to honor God above.        When man, howe'er, his fellowman hath fed,        Then 'spite the law forbidding interest,        He thinketh naught but cursed gain to wrest.      Who taketh usury methinks hath said:      'O Lord, in beauty has Thy earth been wrought!        But why should men for naught enjoy its plains?        Ask usance, since 'tis Thou that sendest rains.      Have they the trees, their fruits, and blossoms bought?      For all they here enjoy, Thy int'rest claim:        For heaven's orbs that shine by day and night,        Th' immortal soul enkindled by Thy light,      And for the wondrous structure of their frame.'      But God replies: 'Now come, and see! I give        With open, bounteous hand, yet nothing take;        The earth yields wealth, nor must return ye make.      But know, O men, that only while ye live,      You may enjoy these gifts of my award.        The capital's mine, and surely I'll demand        The spirit in you planted by my hand,      And also earth will claim her due reward.'        Man's dust to dust is gathered in the grave,        His soul returns to God who gracious gave.\"    R. Yehuda ben Zakkai answers his pupils who ask:        \"Why doth the Law with them more harshly deal        That filch a lamb from fold away,      Than with the highwaymen who shameless steal        Thy purse by force in open day?\"        \"Because in like esteem the brigands hold        The master and his serving man.      Their wickedness is open, frank, and bold,        They fear not God, nor human ban.        The thief feels more respect for earthly law        Than for his heav'nly Master's eye,      Man's presence flees in fear and awe,        Forgets he's seen by God on high.\"    That is a glimpse of the world of the Haggada--a wonderful, fantastic  world, a kaleidoscopic panorama of enchanting views. \"Well can we  understand the distress of mind in a mediaeval divine, or even in a  modern _savant_, who, bent upon following the most subtle windings of  some scientific debate in the Talmudical pages--geometrical, botanical,  financial, or otherwise--as it revolves round the Sabbath journey, the  raising of seeds, the computation of tithes and taxes--feels, as it  were, the ground suddenly give way. The loud voices grow thin, the doors  and walls of the school-room vanish before his eyes, and in their place  uprises Rome the Great, the _Urbs et Orbis_ and her million-voiced life.  Or the blooming vineyards round that other City of Hills, Jerusalem the  Golden herself, are seen, and white-clad virgins move dreamily among  them. Snatches of their songs are heard, the rhythm of their choric  dances rises and falls: it is the most dread Day of Atonement itself,  which, in poetical contrast, was chosen by the 'Rose of Sharon' as a day  of rejoicing to walk among those waving lily-fields and vine-clad  slopes. Or the clarion of rebellion rings high and shrill through the  complicated debate, and Belshazzar, the story of whose ghastly banquet  is told with all the additions of maddening horror, is doing service for  Nero the bloody; or Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian tyrant, and all his  hosts, are cursed with a yelling curse--_a propos_ of some utterly  inappropriate legal point, while to the initiated he stands for Titus  the--at last exploded--'Delight of Humanity.' ... Often--far too often  for the interests of study and the glory of the human race--does the  steady tramp of the Roman cohort, the password of the revolution, the  shriek and clangor of the bloody field, interrupt these debates, and  the arguing masters and disciples don their arms, and, with the cry,  'Jerusalem and Liberty,' rush to the fray.\"[17] Such is the world of the  Talmud.          THE JEW IN THE HISTORY OF CIVILIZATION[18]      In the childhood of civilization, the digging of wells was regarded as  beneficent work. Guide-posts, visible from afar, marked their position,  and hymns were composed, and solemn feasts celebrated, in honor of the  event. One of the choicest bits of early Hebrew poetry is a song of the  well. The soul, in grateful joy, jubilantly calls to her mates: \"Arise!  sing a song unto the well! Well, which the princes have dug, which the  nobles of the people have hollowed out.\"[19] This house, too, is a  guide-post to a newly-found well of humanity and culture, a monument to  our faithfulness and zeal in the recognition and the diffusion of truth.  A scene like this brings to my mind the psalmist's beautiful words:[20]  \"Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together  in unity. It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down  upon the beard, even Aaron's beard, that went down to the skirts of his  garment; as the dew of Hermon, running down upon the mountains of Zion;  for there hath the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for  evermore.\"    Wondrous thoughts veiled with wondrous imagery! The underlying meaning  will lead us to our feast of the well, our celebration in honor of  newly-discovered waters. Our order is based upon the conviction that all  men should be banded together for purposes of humanity. But what is  humanity? Not philanthropy, not benevolence, not charity: it is \"human  culture risen to the stage on which man is conscious of universal  brotherhood, and strives for the realization of the general good.\" In  early times, leaders of men were anointed with oil, symbol of wisdom and  divine inspiration. Above all it was meet that it be used in the  consecration of priests, the exponents of the divine spirit and the Law.  The psalmist's idea is, that as the precious ointment in its abundance  runs down Aaron's beard to the hem of his garment, even so shall wisdom  and the divine spirit overflow the lips of priests, the guides, friends,  and teachers of the people, the promoters of the law of peace and love.    \"As the dew of Hermon, running down upon the mountains of Zion!\" High  above all mountains towers Hermon, its crest enveloped by clouds and  covered with eternal snow. From that supernal peak grateful dew trickles  down, fructifying the land once \"flowing with milk and honey.\" From its  clefts gushes forth Jordan, mightiest stream of the land, watering a  broad plain in its course. In this guise the Lord has granted His  blessing to the land, the blessing of civilization and material  prosperity, from which spring as corollaries the duties of charity and  universal humanity.    A picture of the olden time this, a lodge-address of the days of the  psalm singers. Days flee, time abides; men pass away, mankind endures.  Filled with time-honored thoughts, inspired by the hopes of by-gone  generations, striving for the goal of noble men in all ages, like the  psalm singers in the days of early culture, we celebrate a feast of the  well by reviewing the past and looking forward down the avenues of time.    Less than fifty years ago a band of energetic, loyal Jews, on the other  side of the Atlantic, founded our beloved Order. Now it has established  itself in every part of the world, from the extreme western coast of  America to the blessed meadows of the Jordan; yea, even the Holy Land,  unfurling everywhere the banner of charity, brotherly love, and unity,  and seeking to spread education and culture, the forerunners of  humanity. Judaism, mark you, is the religion of humanity. By far too  late for our good and that of mankind, we began to proclaim this truth  with becoming energy and emphasis, and to demonstrate it with the  joyousness of conviction. The question is, are we permeated with this  conviction? Our knowledge of Judaism is slight; we have barely a  suspicion of what in the course of centuries, nay, of thousands of  years, it has done for the progress of civilization. In my estimation,  our house-warming cannot more fittingly be celebrated than by taking a  bird's-eye view of Jewish culture.    The Bible is the text-book of general literature. Out of the Bible, more  particularly from the Ten Commandments, flashed from Sinai, mankind  learned its first ethical lesson in a system which still satisfies its  needs. To convey even a faint idea of what the Bible has done for  civilization, morality, and the literature of every people--of the  innumerable texts it has furnished to poets, and subjects to  painters--would in itself require a literature.    The conflicts with surrounding nations to which they were exposed made  the Jews concentrate their forces, and so enabled them to wage  successful war with nations mightier than themselves. Their heroism  under the Maccabees and under Bar-Kochba, in the middle ages and in  modern days, permits them to take rank among the most valiant in  history. A historian of literature, a non-Jew, enumerates three factors  constituting Jews important agents in the preservation and revival of  learning:[21] First, their ability as traders. The Phoenicians are  regarded as the oldest commercial nation, but the Jews contested the  palm with them. Zebulon and Asher in very early times were seafaring  tribes. Under Solomon, Israelitish vessels sailed as far as Ophir to  bring Afric's gold to Jerusalem. Before the destruction of the Holy  City, Jewish communities established themselves on the westernmost coast  of Europe. \"The whole of the known world was covered with their  settlements, in constant communication with one another through  itinerant merchants, who effected an exchange of learning as well as of  wares; while the other nations grew more and more isolated, and shut  themselves off from even the sparse opportunities of mental culture then  available.\"    The second factor conducing to mental advancement was the schools which  have flourished in Israel since the days of"]]]
