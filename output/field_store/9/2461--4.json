The innkeeper, who began somewhat to disrelish these mad tricks of his  guest, resolved to despatch him forthwith, and bestow on him that  unlucky knighthood, to prevent farther mischief: so coming to him, he  excused himself for the insolence of those base scoundrels, as being  done without his privity or consent; but their audaciousness, he said,  was sufficiently punished. He added, that he had already told him  there was no chapel in his castle; and that indeed there was no need  of one to finish the rest of the ceremony of knighthood, which  consisted only in the application of the sword to the neck and  shoulders, as he had read in the register of the ceremonies of the  order; and that this might be performed as well in a field as anywhere  else: that he had already fulfilled the obligation of watching his  arms, which required no more than two hours watch, whereas he had been  four hours upon the guard. Don Quixote, who easily believed him, told  him he was ready to obey him, and desired him to make an end of the  business as soon as possible; for if he were but knighted, and should  see himself once attacked, he believed he should not leave a man alive  in the castle, except those whom he should desire him to spare for his  sake.    Upon this, the innkeeper, lest the knight should proceed to such  extremities, fetched the book in which he used to set down the  carriers' accounts for straw and barley; and having brought with him  the two kind females already mentioned, and a boy that held a piece of  lighted candle in his hand, he ordered Don Quixote to kneel: then  reading in his manual, as if he had been repeating some pious oration,  in the midst of his devotion he lifted up his hand, and gave him a  good blow on the neck, and then a gentle slap on the back with the  flat of his sword, still mumbling some words between his teeth in the  tone of a prayer. After this he ordered one of the ladies to gird the  sword about the knight's waist: which she did with much solemnity,  and, I may add, discretion, considering how hard a thing it was to  forbear laughing at every circumstance of the ceremony: it is true,  the thoughts of the knight's late prowess did not a little contribute  to the suppression of her mirth. As she girded on his sword, \"Heaven,\"  cried the kind lady, \"make your worship a lucky knight, and prosper  you wherever you go.\" Don Quixote desired to know her name, that he  might understand to whom he was indebted for the favour she had  bestowed upon him, and also make her partaker of the honour he was to  acquire by the strength of his arm. To which the lady answered with  all humility, that her name was Tolosa, a cobbler's daughter, that  kept a stall among the little shops of Sanchobinaya at Toledo; and  that whenever he pleased to command her, she would be his humble  servant. Don Quixote begged of her to do him the favour to add  hereafter the title of lady to her name, and for his sake to be called  from that time the Lady Toloso; which she promised to do. Her  companion having buckled on his spurs, occasioned a like conference  between them; and when he had asked her name, she told him she went by  the name of Molivera, being the daughter of an honest miller of  Antequera. Our new knight entreated her also to style herself the Lady  Molivera, making her new offers of service. These extraordinary  ceremonies (the like never seen before) being thus hurried over in a  kind of post-haste, Don Quixote could not rest till he had taken the  field in quest of adventures; therefore having immediately saddled his  Rozinante, and being mounted, he embraced the innkeeper, and returned  him so many thanks at so extravagant a rate, for the obligation he had  laid upon him in dubbing him a knight, that it is impossible to give a  true relation of them all; to which the innkeeper, in haste to get rid  of him, returned as rhetorical though shorter answers; and without  stopping his horse for the reckoning, was glad with all his heart to  see him go.          CHAPTER IV.    _What befel the Knight after he had left the inn._      Aurora began to usher in the morn, when Don Quixote sallied out of the  inn, so overjoyed to find himself knighted, that he infused the same  satisfaction into his horse, who seemed ready to burst his girths for  joy. But calling to mind the admonitions which the innkeeper had given  him, concerning the provision of necessary accommodation in his  travels, particularly money and clean shirts, he resolved to return  home to furnish himself with them, and likewise get him a squire,  designing to entertain as such a labouring man, his neighbour, who was  poor and had a number of children, but yet very fit for the office.  With this resolution he took the road which led to his own village.  The knight had not travelled far, when he fancied he heard an  effeminate voice complaining in a thicket on his right hand. \"I thank  Heaven,\" said he, when he heard the cries, \"for favouring me so soon  with an opportunity to perform the duty of my profession, and reap the  fruits of my desire; for these complaints are certainly the moans of  some distressed creature who wants my present help.\" Then turning to  that side with all the speed which Rozinante could make, he no sooner  came into the wood but he found a mare tied to an oak, and to another  a young lad about fifteen years of age, naked from the waist upwards.  This was he who made such a lamentable outcry; and not without cause,  for a lusty country-fellow was strapping him soundly with a girdle, at  every stripe putting him in mind of a proverb, _Keep your mouth shut,  and your eyes open_. \"Good master,\" cried the boy, \"I'll do so no  more: indeed, master, hereafter I'll take more care of your goods.\"  Don Quixote seeing this, cried in an angry tone, \"Discourteous knight,  'tis an unworthy act to strike a person who is not able to defend  himself: come, bestride thy steed, and take thy lance, then I'll make  thee know thou hast acted the part of a coward.\" The country-fellow,  who gave himself for lost at the sight of an apparition in armour  brandishing his lance at his face, answered him in mild and submissive  words: \"Sir knight,\" cried he, \"this boy, whom I am chastising, is my  servant; and because I correct him for his carelessness or his  knavery, he says I do it out of covetousness, to defraud him of his  wages; but, upon my life and soul, he belies me.\" \"Sayest thou this in  my presence, vile rustic,\" cried Don Quixote; \"for thy insolent  speech, I have a good mind to run thee through the body with my lance.  Pay the boy this instant, without any more words, or I will  immediately despatch and annihilate thee: unbind him, I say, this  moment.\" The countryman hung down his head, and without any further  reply unbound the boy; who being asked by Don Quixote what his master  owed him, told him it was nine months' wages, at seven reals a month.  The knight having cast it up, found it came to sixty-three reals in  all; which he ordered the farmer to pay the fellow immediately, unless  he intended to lose his life that very moment. \"The worst is, sir  knight,\" cried the farmer, \"that I have no money about me; but let  Andres go home with me, and I'll pay him every piece out of hand.\"  \"What, I go home with him!\" cried the youngster; \"I know better  things: for he'd no sooner have me by himself, but he'd flay me alive,  like another St. Bartholomew.\" \"He will not dare,\" replied Don  Quixote; \"I command him, and that's sufficient: therefore, provided he  will swear by the order of knighthood which has been conferred upon  him, that he will duly observe this regulation, I will freely let him  go, and then thou art secure of thy money.\" \"Good sir, take heed what  you say,\" cried the boy; \"for my master is no knight, nor ever was of  any order in his life: he's John Haldudo, the rich farmer of  Quintinar.\" \"This signifies little,\" answered Don Quixote, \"for there  may be knights among the Haldudos; besides, the brave man carves out  his fortune, and every man is the son of his own works.\" \"That's true,  sir,\" quoth Andres; \"but of what works can this master of mine be the  son, who denies me my wages, which I have earned with the sweat of my  brows?\" \"I do not deny to pay thee thy wages, honest Andres,\" cried  the master; \"do but go along with me, and by all the orders of  knighthood in the world, I promise to pay thee every piece, as I  said.\" \"Be sure,\" said Don Quixote, \"you perform your promise; for if  you fail, I will assuredly return and find you out, and punish you  moreover, though you should hide yourself as close as a lizard. And if  you will be informed who it is that lays these injunctions on you,  that you may understand how highly it concerns you to observe them,  know, I am Don Quixote de la Mancha, the righter of wrongs, the  revenger and redresser of grievances; and so farewell: but remember  what you have promised and sworn, as you will answer for it at your  peril.\" This said, he clapped spurs to Rozinante, and quickly left  them behind.    The countryman, who followed him with both his eyes, no sooner  perceived that he was passed the woods, and quite out of sight, than  he went back to his boy Andres. \"Come, child,\" said he, \"I will pay  thee what I owe thee, as that righter of wrongs and redresser of  grievances has ordered me.\" \"Ay,\" quoth Andres, \"on my word, you will  do well to fulfil the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/360"],[0,"What is Property? An Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government (#10)"],[1,"seems to you  blasphemous--PROPERTY IS ROBBERY--would, if our prejudices allowed us  to consider it, be recognized as the lightning-rod to shield us from the  coming thunderbolt; but too many interests stand in the way!... Alas!  philosophy will not change the course of events: destiny will fulfill  itself regardless of prophecy. Besides, must not justice be done and our  education be finished?    PROPERTY IS ROBBERY!... What a revolution in human ideas! PROPRIETOR and  ROBBER have been at all times expressions as contradictory as the beings  whom they designate are hostile; all languages have perpetuated this  opposition. On what authority, then, do you venture to attack universal  consent, and give the lie to the human race? Who are you, that you  should question the judgment of the nations and the ages?    Of what consequence to you, reader, is my obscure individuality? I  live, like you, in a century in which reason submits only to fact and  to evidence. My name, like yours, is TRUTH-SEEKER. [6] My mission is  written in these words of the law: SPEAK WITHOUT HATRED AND WITHOUT  FEAR; TELL THAT WHICH THOU KNOWEST! The work of our race is to build the  temple of science, and this science includes man and Nature. Now, truth  reveals itself to all; to-day to Newton and Pascal, tomorrow to  the herdsman in the valley and the journeyman in the shop. Each one  contributes his stone to the edifice; and, his task accomplished,  disappears. Eternity precedes us, eternity follows us: between two  infinites, of what account is one poor mortal that the century should  inquire about him?    Disregard then, reader, my title and my character, and attend only to my  arguments. It is in accordance with universal consent that I undertake  to correct universal error; from the OPINION of the human race I appeal  to its FAITH. Have the courage to follow me; and, if your will is  untrammelled, if your conscience is free, if your mind can unite two  propositions and deduce a third therefrom, my ideas will inevitably  become yours. In beginning by giving you my last word, it was my purpose  to warn you, not to defy you; for I am certain that, if you read me, you  will be compelled to assent. The things of which I am to speak are so  simple and clear that you will be astonished at not having perceived  them before, and you will say: \"I have neglected to think.\" Others offer  you the spectacle of genius wresting Nature's secrets from her, and  unfolding before you her sublime messages; you will find here only a  series of experiments upon JUSTICE and RIGHT a sort of verification of  the weights and measures of your conscience. The operations shall be  conducted under your very eyes; and you shall weigh the result.    Nevertheless, I build no system. I ask an end to privilege, the  abolition of slavery, equality of rights, and the reign of law. Justice,  nothing else; that is the alpha and omega of my argument: to others I  leave the business of governing the world.    One day I asked myself: Why is there so much sorrow and misery in  society? Must man always be wretched? And not satisfied with the  explanations given by the reformers,--these attributing the general  distress to governmental cowardice and incapacity, those to conspirators  and emeutes, still others to ignorance and general corruption,--and  weary of the interminable quarrels of the tribune and the press, I  sought to fathom the matter myself. I have consulted the masters of  science; I have read a hundred volumes of philosophy, law, political  economy, and history: would to God that I had lived in a century in  which so much reading had been useless! I have made every effort to  obtain exact information, comparing doctrines, replying to objections,  continually constructing equations and reductions from arguments, and  weighing thousands of syllogisms in the scales of the most rigorous  logic. In this laborious work, I have collected many interesting facts  which I shall share with my friends and the public as soon as I have  leisure. But I must say that I recognized at once that we had never  understood the meaning of these words, so common and yet so sacred:  JUSTICE, EQUITY, LIBERTY; that concerning each of these principles our  ideas have been utterly obscure; and, in fact, that this ignorance was  the sole cause, both of the poverty that devours us, and of all the  calamities that have ever afflicted the human race.    My mind was frightened by this strange result: I doubted my reason.  What! said I, that which eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor insight  penetrated, you have discovered! Wretch, mistake not the visions of  your diseased brain for the truths of science! Do you not know (great  philosophers have said so) that in points of practical morality  universal error is a contradiction?    I resolved then to test my arguments; and in entering upon this new  labor I sought an answer to the following questions: Is it possible  that humanity can have been so long and so universally mistaken in the  application of moral principles? How and why could it be mistaken? How  can its error, being universal, be capable of correction?    These questions, on the solution of which depended the certainty of my  conclusions, offered no lengthy resistance to analysis. It will be seen,  in chapter V. of this work, that in morals, as in all other branches of  knowledge, the gravest errors are the dogmas of science; that, even in  works of justice, to be mistaken is a privilege which ennobles man; and  that whatever philosophical merit may attach to me is infinitely small.  To name a thing is easy: the difficulty is to discern it before its  appearance. In giving expression to the last stage of an idea,--an idea  which permeates all minds, which to-morrow will be proclaimed by another  if I fail to announce it to-day,--I can claim no merit save that of  priority of utterance. Do we eulogize the man who first perceives the  dawn?    Yes: all men believe and repeat that equality of conditions is identical  with equality of rights; that PROPERTY and ROBBERY are synonymous terms;  that every social advantage accorded, or rather usurped, in the name of  superior talent or service, is iniquity and extortion. All men in their  hearts, I say, bear witness to these truths; they need only to be made  to understand it.    Before entering directly upon the question before me, I must say a word  of the road that I shall traverse. When Pascal approached a geometrical  problem, he invented a method of solution; to solve a problem in  philosophy a method is equally necessary. Well, by how much do the  problems of which philosophy treats surpass in the gravity of their  results those discussed by geometry! How much more imperatively, then,  do they demand for their solution a profound and rigorous analysis!    It is a fact placed for ever beyond doubt, say the modern psychologists,  that every perception received by the mind is determined by certain  general laws which govern the mind; is moulded, so to speak, in certain  types pre-existing in our understanding, and which constitutes its  original condition. Hence, say they, if the mind has no innate IDEAS,  it has at least innate FORMS. Thus, for example, every phenomenon is of  necessity conceived by us as happening in TIME and SPACE,--that compels  us to infer a CAUSE of its occurrence; every thing which exists implies  the ideas of SUBSTANCE, MODE, RELATION, NUMBER, &C.; in a word, we form  no idea which is not related to some one of the general principles of  reason, independent of which nothing exists.    These axioms of the understanding, add the psychologists, these  fundamental types, by which all our judgments and ideas are inevitably  shaped, and which our sensations serve only to illuminate, are known  in the schools as CATEGORIES. Their primordial existence in the mind is  to-day demonstrated; they need only to be systematized and catalogued.  Aristotle recognized ten; Kant increased the number to fifteen; M.  Cousin has reduced it to three, to two, to one; and the indisputable  glory of this professor will be due to the fact that, if he has not  discovered the true theory of categories, he has, at least, seen more  clearly than any one else the vast importance of this question,--the  greatest and perhaps the only one with which metaphysics has to deal.    I confess that I disbelieve in the innateness, not only of IDEAS, but  also of FORMS or LAWS of our understanding; and I hold the metaphysics  of Reid and Kant to be still farther removed from the truth than that of  Aristotle. However, as I do not wish to enter here into a discussion of  the mind, a task which would demand much labor and be of no interest to  the public, I shall admit the hypothesis that our most general and  most necessary ideas--such as time, space, substance, and cause--exist  originally in the mind; or, at least, are derived immediately from its  constitution.    But it is a psychological fact none the less true, and one to which the  philosophers have paid too little attention, that habit, like a second  nature, has the power of fixing in the mind new categorical forms  derived from the appearances which impress us, and by them usually  stripped of objective reality, but whose influence over our judgments  is no less predetermining than that of the original categories. Hence  we reason by the ETERNAL and ABSOLUTE laws of our mind, and at the same  time by the secondary rules, ordinarily faulty, which are suggested to  us by imperfect observation. This is the most fecund source of false  prejudices, and the permanent and often invincible cause of a multitude  of errors. The bias resulting from these prejudices is so strong that  often, even when we are fighting against a principle which our mind  thinks false, which is repugnant to our reason, and which our conscience  disapproves, we defend it without knowing it, we reason in accordance  with it,"]]]
