Such a Council in a small, poor nation did not      have sufficient funds for armaments, which were not immediately and      imperatively necessary; and therefore the Voivode Vissarion, who had      vast estates in his own possession, and who was the present      representative a family which of old had been leaders in the land,      found it a duty to do on his own account that which the State could      not do.  For security as to the loan which he wished to get, and      which was indeed a vast one, he offered to sell me his whole estate      if I would secure to him a right to repurchase it within a given time      (a time which I may say has some time ago expired).  He made it a      condition that the sale and agreement should remain a strict secret      between us, as a widespread knowledge that his estate had changed      hands would in all probability result in my death and his own at the      hands of the mountaineers, who are beyond everything loyal, and were      jealous to the last degree.  An attack by Turkey was feared, and new      armaments were required; and the patriotic Voivode was sacrificing      his own great fortune for the public good.  What a sacrifice this was      he well knew, for in all discussions regarding a possible change in      the Constitution of the Blue Mountains it was always taken for      granted that if the principles of the Constitution should change to a      more personal rule, his own family should be regarded as the Most      Noble.  It had ever been on the side of freedom in olden time; before      the establishment of the Council, or even during the rule of the      Voivodes, the Vissarion had every now and again stood out against the      King or challenged the Princedom.  The very name stood for freedom,      for nationality, against foreign oppression; and the bold      mountaineers were devoted to it, as in other free countries men      follow the flag.        Such loyalty was a power and a help in the land, for it knew danger      in every form; and anything which aided the cohesion of its integers      was a natural asset.  On every side other powers, great and small,      pressed the land, anxious to acquire its suzerainty by any      means--fraud or force.  Greece, Turkey, Austria, Russia, Italy,      France, had all tried in vain.  Russia, often hurled back, was      waiting an opportunity to attack.  Austria and Greece, although      united by no common purpose or design, were ready to throw in their      forces with whomsoever might seem most likely to be victor.  Other      Balkan States, too, were not lacking in desire to add the little      territory of the Blue Mountains to their more ample possessions.      Albania, Dalmatia, Herzegovina, Servia, Bulgaria, looked with lustful      eyes on the land, which was in itself a vast natural fortress, having      close under its shelter perhaps the finest harbour between Gibraltar      and the Dardanelles.        But the fierce, hardy mountaineers were unconquerable.  For centuries      they had fought, with a fervour and fury that nothing could withstand      or abate, attacks on their independence.  Time after time, century      after century, they had opposed with dauntless front invading armies      sent against them.  This unquenchable fire of freedom had had its      effect.  One and all, the great Powers knew that to conquer that      little nation would be no mean task, but rather that of a tireless      giant.  Over and over again had they fought with units against      hundreds, never ceasing until they had either wiped out their foes      entirely or seen them retreat across the frontier in diminished      numbers.        For many years past, however, the Land of the Blue Mountains had      remained unassailable, for all the Powers and States had feared lest      the others should unite against the one who should begin the attack.        At the time I speak of there was a feeling throughout the Blue      Mountains--and, indeed, elsewhere--that Turkey was preparing for a      war of offence.  The objective of her attack was not known anywhere,      but here there was evidence that the Turkish \"Bureau of Spies\" was in      active exercise towards their sturdy little neighbour.  To prepare      for this, the Voivode Peter Vissarion approached me in order to      obtain the necessary \"sinews of war.\"        The situation was complicated by the fact that the Elective Council      was at present largely held together by the old Greek Church, which      was the religion of the people, and which had had since the beginning      its destinies linked in a large degree with theirs.  Thus it was      possible that if a war should break out, it might easily      become--whatever might have been its cause or beginnings--a war of      creeds.  This in the Balkans must be largely one of races, the end of      which no mind could diagnose or even guess at.        I had now for some time had knowledge of the country and its people,      and had come to love them both.  The nobility of Vissarion's      self-sacrifice at once appealed to me, and I felt that I, too, should      like to have a hand in the upholding of such a land and such a      people.  They both deserved freedom.  When Vissarion handed me the      completed deed of sale I was going to tear it up; but he somehow      recognized my intention, and forestalled it.  He held up his hand      arrestingly as he said:        \"I recognize your purpose, and, believe me, I honour you for it from      the very depths of my soul.  But, my friend, it must not be.  Our      mountaineers are proud beyond belief.  Though they would allow      me--who am one of themselves, and whose fathers have been in some way      leaders and spokesmen amongst them for many centuries--to do all that      is in my power to do--and what, each and all, they would be glad to      do were the call to them--they would not accept aid from one outside      themselves.  My good friend, they would resent it, and might show to      you, who wish us all so well, active hostility, which might end in      danger, or even death.  That was why, my friend, I asked to put a      clause in our agreement, that I might have right to repurchase my      estate, regarding which you would fain act so generously.\"        Thus it is, my dear nephew Rupert, only son of my dear sister, that I      hereby charge you solemnly as you value me--as you value yourself--as      you value honour, that, should it ever become known that that noble      Voivode, Peter Vissarion, imperilled himself for his country's good,      and if it be of danger or evil repute to him that even for such a      purpose he sold his heritage, you shall at once and to the knowledge      of the mountaineers--though not necessarily to others--reconvey to      him or his heirs the freehold that he was willing to part with--and      that he has _de facto_ parted with by the effluxion of the time      during which his right of repurchase existed.  This is a secret trust      and duty which is between thee and me alone in the first instance; a      duty which I have undertaken on behalf of my heirs, and which must be      carried out, at whatsoever cost may ensue.  You must not take it that      it is from any mistrust of you or belief that you will fail that I      have taken another measure to insure that this my cherished idea is      borne out.  Indeed, it is that the law may, in case of need--for no      man can know what may happen after his own hand be taken from the      plough--be complied with, that I have in another letter written for      the guidance of others, directed that in case of any failure to carry      out this trust--death or other--the direction become a clause or      codicil to my Will.  But in the meantime I wish that this be kept a      secret between us two.  To show you the full extent of my confidence,      let me here tell you that the letter alluded to above is marked \"C,\"      and directed to my solicitor and co-executor, Edward Bingham Trent,      which is finally to be regarded as clause eleven of my Will.  To      which end he has my instructions and also a copy of this letter,      which is, in case of need, and that only, to be opened, and is to be      a guide to my wishes as to the carrying out by you of the conditions      on which you inherit.        And now, my dear nephew, let me change to another subject more dear      to me--yourself.  When you read this I shall have passed away, so      that I need not be hampered now by that reserve which I feel has      grown upon me through a long and self-contained life.  Your mother      was very dear to me.  As you know, she was twenty years younger than      her youngest brother, who was two years younger than me.  So we were      all young men when she was a baby, and, I need not say, a pet amongst      us--almost like our own child to each of us, as well as our sister.      You knew her sweetness and high quality, so I need say nothing of      these; but I should like you to understand that she was very dear to      me.  When she and your father came to know and love each other I was      far away, opening up a new branch of business in the interior of      China, and it was not for several months that I got home news.  When      I first heard of him they had already been married.  I was delighted      to find that they were very happy.  They needed nothing that I could      give.  When he died so suddenly I tried to comfort her, and all I had      was at her disposal, did she want it.  She was a proud woman--though      not with me.  She had come to understand that, though I seemed cold      and hard (and perhaps was so generally), I was not so to her.  But      she would not have help of any kind.  When I pressed her, she told me      that she had enough for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31"],[0,"Plays of Sophocles: Oedipus the King; Oedipus at Colonus; Antigone (#10)"],[1," dreading my name alone;  For me you surely dread not, nor my deeds,  Deeds of a man more sinned against than sinning,  As I might well convince you, were it meet  To tell my mother's story and my sire's,  The cause of this your fear.  Yet am I then  A villain born because in self-defense,  Striken, I struck the striker back again?  E'en had I known, no villainy 'twould prove:  But all unwitting whither I went, I went--  To ruin; my destroyers knew it well,  Wherefore, I pray you, sirs, in Heaven's name,  Even as ye bade me quit my seat, defend me.  O pay not a lip service to the gods  And wrong them of their dues.  Bethink ye well,  The eye of Heaven beholds the just of men,  And the unjust, nor ever in this world  Has one sole godless sinner found escape.  Stand then on Heaven's side and never blot  Athens' fair scutcheon by abetting wrong.  I came to you a suppliant, and you pledged  Your honor; O preserve me to the end,  O let not this marred visage do me wrong!  A holy and god-fearing man is here  Whose coming purports comfort for your folk.  And when your chief arrives, whoe'er he be,  Then shall ye have my story and know all.  Meanwhile I pray you do me no despite.    CHORUS  The plea thou urgest, needs must give us pause,  Set forth in weighty argument, but we  Must leave the issue with the ruling powers.    OEDIPUS  Where is he, strangers, he who sways the realm?    CHORUS  In his ancestral seat; a messenger,  The same who sent us here, is gone for him.    OEDIPUS  And think you he will have such care or thought  For the blind stranger as to come himself?    CHORUS  Aye, that he will, when once he learns thy name.    OEDIPUS  But who will bear him word!    CHORUS                                The way is long,  And many travelers pass to speed the news.  Be sure he'll hear and hasten, never fear;  So wide and far thy name is noised abroad,  That, were he ne'er so spent and loth to move,  He would bestir him when he hears of thee.    OEDIPUS  Well, may he come with blessing to his State  And me!  Who serves his neighbor serves himself. [5]    ANTIGONE  Zeus!  What is this?  What can I say or think?    OEDIPUS  What now, Antigone?    ANTIGONE                      I see a woman  Riding upon a colt of Aetna's breed;  She wears for headgear a Thessalian hat  To shade her from the sun.  Who can it be?  She or a stranger?  Do I wake or dream?  'This she; 'tis not--I cannot tell, alack;  It is no other!  Now her bright'ning glance  Greets me with recognition, yes, 'tis she,  Herself, Ismene!    OEDIPUS                      Ha! what say ye, child?    ANTIGONE  That I behold thy daughter and my sister,  And thou wilt know her straightway by her voice.  [Enter ISMENE]    ISMENE  Father and sister, names to me most sweet,  How hardly have I found you, hardly now  When found at last can see you through my tears!    OEDIPUS  Art come, my child?    ISMENE                      O father, sad thy plight!    OEDIPUS  Child, thou art here?    ISMENE                      Yes, 'twas a weary way.    OEDIPUS  Touch me, my child.    ISMENE                      I give a hand to both.    OEDIPUS  O children--sisters!    ISMENE                      O disastrous plight!    OEDIPUS  Her plight and mine?    ISMENE                      Aye, and my own no less.    OEDIPUS  What brought thee, daughter?    ISMENE                                Father, care for thee.    OEDIPUS  A daughter's yearning?    ISMENE                           Yes, and I had news  I would myself deliver, so I came  With the one thrall who yet is true to me.    OEDIPUS  Thy valiant brothers, where are they at need?    ISMENE  They are--enough, 'tis now their darkest hour.    OEDIPUS  Out on the twain!  The thoughts and actions all  Are framed and modeled on Egyptian ways.  For there the men sit at the loom indoors  While the wives slave abroad for daily bread.  So you, my children--those whom I behooved  To bear the burden, stay at home like girls,  While in their stead my daughters moil and drudge,  Lightening their father's misery.  The one  Since first she grew from girlish feebleness  To womanhood has been the old man's guide  And shared my weary wandering, roaming oft  Hungry and footsore through wild forest ways,  In drenching rains and under scorching suns,  Careless herself of home and ease, if so  Her sire might have her tender ministry.  And thou, my child, whilom thou wentest forth,  Eluding the Cadmeians' vigilance,  To bring thy father all the oracles  Concerning Oedipus, and didst make thyself  My faithful lieger, when they banished me.  And now what mission summons thee from home,  What news, Ismene, hast thou for thy father?  This much I know, thou com'st not empty-handed,  Without a warning of some new alarm.    ISMENE  The toil and trouble, father, that I bore  To find thy lodging-place and how thou faredst,  I spare thee; surely 'twere a double pain  To suffer, first in act and then in telling;  'Tis the misfortune of thine ill-starred sons  I come to tell thee.  At the first they willed  To leave the throne to Creon, minded well  Thus to remove the inveterate curse of old,  A canker that infected all thy race.  But now some god and an infatuate soul  Have stirred betwixt them a mad rivalry  To grasp at sovereignty and kingly power.  Today the hot-branded youth, the younger born,  Is keeping Polyneices from the throne,  His elder, and has thrust him from the land.  The banished brother (so all Thebes reports)  Fled to the vale of Argos, and by help  Of new alliance there and friends in arms,  Swears he will stablish Argos straight as lord  Of the Cadmeian land, or, if he fail,  Exalt the victor to the stars of heaven.  This is no empty tale, but deadly truth,  My father; and how long thy agony,  Ere the gods pity thee, I cannot tell.    OEDIPUS  Hast thou indeed then entertained a hope  The gods at last will turn and rescue me?    ISMENE  Yea, so I read these latest oracles.    OEDIPUS  What oracles?  What hath been uttered, child?    ISMENE  Thy country (so it runs) shall yearn in time  To have thee for their weal alive or dead.    OEDIPUS  And who could gain by such a one as I?    ISMENE  On thee, 'tis said, their sovereignty depends.    OEDIPUS  So, when I cease to be, my worth begins.    ISMENE  The gods, who once abased, uplift thee now.    OEDIPUS  Poor help to raise an old man fallen in youth.    ISMENE  Howe'er that be, 'tis for this cause alone  That Creon comes to thee--and comes anon.    OEDIPUS  With what intent, my daughter?  Tell me plainly.    ISMENE  To plant thee near the Theban land, and so  Keep thee within their grasp, yet now allow  Thy foot to pass beyond their boundaries.    OEDIPUS  What gain they, if I lay outside?    OEDIPUS                                     Thy tomb,  If disappointed, brings on them a curse.    OEDIPUS  It needs no god to tell what's plain to sense.    ISMENE  Therefore they fain would have thee close at hand,  Not where thou wouldst be master of thyself.    OEDIPUS  Mean they to shroud my bones in Theban dust?    ISMENE  Nay, father, guilt of kinsman's blood forbids.    OEDIPUS  Then never shall they be my masters, never!    ISMENE  Thebes, thou shalt rue this bitterly some day!    OEDIPUS  When what conjunction comes to pass, my child?    ISMENE  Thy angry wraith, when at thy tomb they stand. [6]    OEDIPUS  And who hath told thee what thou tell'st me, child?    ISMENE  Envoys who visited the Delphic hearth.    OEDIPUS  Hath Phoebus spoken thus concerning me?    ISMENE  So say the envoys who returned to Thebes.    OEDIPUS  And can a son of mine have heard of this?    ISMENE  Yea, both alike, and know its import well.    OEDIPUS  They knew it, yet the ignoble greed of rule  Outweighed all longing for their sire's return.    ISMENE  Grievous thy words, yet I must own them true.    OEDIPUS  Then may the gods ne'er quench their fatal feud,  And mine be the arbitrament of the fight,  For which they now are arming, spear to spear;  That neither he who holds the scepter now  May keep this throne, nor he who fled the realm  Return again.  _They_ never raised a hand,  When I their sire was thrust from hearth and home,  When I was banned and banished, what recked they?  Say you 'twas done at my desire, a grace  Which the state, yielding to my wish, allowed?  Not so; for, mark you, on that very day  When in the tempest of my soul I craved  Death, even death by stoning, none appeared  To further that wild longing, but anon,  When time had numbed my anguish and I felt  My wrath had all outrun those errors past,  Then, then it was the city went about  By force to oust me, respited for years;  And then my sons, who should as sons have helped,  Did nothing: and, one little word from them  Was all I needed, and they spoke no word,  But let me wander on for evermore,  A banished man, a beggar.  These two maids  Their sisters, girls, gave all their sex could give,  Food and safe harborage and filial care;  While their two brethren sacrificed their sire  For lust of power and sceptred sovereignty.  No! me they ne'er shall win for an ally,  Nor will this Theban kingship bring them gain;  That know I from this maiden's oracles,  And those old prophecies concerning me,  Which Phoebus now at length has brought to pass.  Come Creon then, come all the mightiest  In Thebes to seek me; for if ye my friends,  Championed by those dread Powers indigenous,  Espouse my cause; then for the State ye gain  A great deliverer, for my foemen bane.    CHORUS  Our pity, Oedipus, thou needs must move,  Thou and these maidens; and the stronger plea  Thou urgest, as the savior of our land,  Disposes me to counsel for thy weal.    OEDIPUS  Aid me, kind sirs; I will do all you bid.    CHORUS  First make atonement to the deities,  Whose grove by trespass thou didst first profane.    OEDIPUS  After what manner, stranger?  Teach me, pray.    CHORUS  Make a libation first of water fetched  With undefiled hands from living spring.    OEDIPUS"]]]
