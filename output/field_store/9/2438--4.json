[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3462"],[0,"More Hunting Wasps (#10)"],[1," the injection of ammonia, or the grub which, a novice at dissecting a  prey differing from its own, did not know how to practise its craft upon  a changed victim and began to bite before the proper time?    In my uncertainty, I try again. This time I shall not interfere, so that  my clumsiness cannot be to blame. As I described when speaking of the  Cetonia-larva, the Oryctes-larva now lies bound, quite alive, on a strip  of cork. As usual, I make a small opening in the belly, to entice the  grub by means of a bleeding wound and facilitate its access. I obtain  the same negative result. In a little while, the Oryctes is a noisome  mass on which the nurseling lies poisoned. The failure was foreseen: to  the difficulties presented by a prey unknown to my charge was added the  commotion caused by the wriggling of an unparalysed animal.    We will try once more, this time with a victim paralysed not by me, an  unskilled operator, but by an adept whose ability ranks so high that it  is beyond discussion. Chance favours me to perfection: yesterday, in a  warm sheltered corner, at the foot of a sandy bank, I discovered three  cells of the Languedocian Sphex, each with its Ephippiger and the  recently laid egg. This is the game I want, a corpulent prey, of a  size suited to the Scolia and, what is more, in splendid condition,  artistically paralysed according to rule by a master among masters.    As usual, I install my three Ephippigers in a glass jar, on a bed of  mould; I remove the egg of the Sphex and on each victim, after slightly  incising the skin of the belly, I place a young Scolia-grub. For three  or four days my charges feed upon this game, so novel to them, without  any sign of repugnance or hesitation. By the fluctuations of the  digestive canal I perceive that the work of nutrition is proceeding  as it should; things are happening just as if the dish were a  Cetonia-larva. The change of diet, complete though it is, has in no way  affected the appetite of the Scolia-grubs. But this prosperous condition  does not last long. About the fourth day, a little sooner in one case,  a little later in another, the three Ephippigers become putrid and the  Scoliae die at the same time.    This result is eloquent. Had I left the egg of the Sphex to hatch, the  larva coming out of it would have fed upon the Ephippiger; and for the  hundredth time I should have witnessed an incomprehensible spectacle,  that of an animal which, devoured piecemeal for nearly a fortnight,  grows thin and empty, shrivels up and yet retains to the very end the  freshness peculiar to living flesh. Substitute for this Sphex-larva a  Scolia-larva of almost the same size; let the dish be the same though  the guest is different; and healthy live flesh is promptly replaced  by pestilent rotten flesh. That which under the mandibles of the Sphex  would for a long while have remained wholesome food promptly becomes a  poisonous liquescence under the mandibles of the Scolia.    It is impossible to explain the preservation of the victuals until  finally consumed by supposing that the venom injected by the Wasp when  she delivers her paralysing stings possesses antiseptic properties.  The three Ephippigers were operated on by the Sphex. Able to keep fresh  under the mandibles of the Sphex-larvae, why did they promptly go bad  under the mandibles of the Scolia-larvae? Any idea of an antiseptic must  needs be rejected: a liquid preservative which would act in the first  case could not fail to act in the second, as its virtues would not  depend on the teeth of the consumer.    Those of you who are versed in the knowledge attaching to this problem,  investigate, I beg you, search, sift, see if you can discover the reason  why the victuals keep fresh when consumed by a Sphex, whereas they  promptly become putrid when consumed by a Scolia. For me, I see only one  reason; and I very much doubt whether any one can suggest another.    Both larvae practise a special art of eating, which is determined by the  nature of the game. The Sphex, when sitting down to an Ephippiger, the  food that has fallen to its lot, knows thoroughly how to consume it and  how to preserve, to the very end, the glimmer of life which keeps it  fresh; but, if it has to browse upon a Cetonia-grub, whose different  structure would confuse its talents as a dissector, it would soon have  nothing before it but a heap of putrescence. The Scolia, in its turn,  is familiar with the method of eating the Cetonia-grub, its invariable  portion; but it does not understand the art of eating the Ephippiger,  though the dish is to its taste. Unable to dissect this unknown species  of game, its mandibles slash away at random, killing the creature  outright as soon as they take their first bites of the deeper tissues of  the victim. That is the whole secret.    One more word, on which I shall enlarge in another chapter. I observe  that the Scoliae to which I give Ephippigers paralysed by the Sphex  keep in excellent condition, despite the change of diet, so long as  the provisions retain their freshness. They languish when the game goes  high; and they die when putridity supervenes. Their death, therefore,  is due not to an unaccustomed diet, but to poisoning by one or other  of those terrible toxins which are engendered by animal corruption  and which chemistry calls by the name of ptomaines. Therefore,  notwithstanding the fatal outcome of my three attempts, I remain  persuaded that the unfamiliar method of rearing would have been  perfectly successful had the Ephippigers not gone bad, that is, if the  Scoliae had known how to eat them according to the rules.    What a delicate and dangerous thing is the art of eating in these  carnivorous larvae supplied with a single victim, which they have to  spend a fortnight in consuming, on the express condition of not killing  it until the very end! Could our physiological science, of which, with  good reason, we are so proud, describe, without blundering, the method  to be followed in the successive mouthfuls? How has a miserable grub  learnt what our knowledge cannot tell us? By habit, the Darwinians will  reply, who see in instinct an acquired habit.    Before deciding this serious matter, I will ask you to reflect that the  first Wasp, of whatever kind, that thought of feeding her progeny on  a Cetonia-grub or on any other large piece of game demanding long  preservation could necessarily have left no descendants unless the art  of consuming food without causing putrescence had been practised, with  all its scrupulous caution, from the first generation onwards. Having as  yet learnt nothing by habit or by atavistic transmission, since it was  making a first beginning, the nurseling would bite into its provender at  random. It would be starving, it would have no respect for its prey.  It would carve its joint at random; and we have just seen the fatal  consequence of an ill-directed bite. It would perish--I have just proved  this in the most positive manner--it would perish, poisoned by its  victim, already dead and putrid.    To prosper, it would have, although a novice, to know what was permitted  and what forbidden in ransacking the creature's entrails; nor would  it be enough for the larva to be approximately in possession of this  difficult secret: it would be indispensable that it should possess the  secret completely, for a single bite, if delivered before the right  moment, would inevitably involve its own demise. The Scoliae of my  experiments are not novices, far from it: they are the descendants of  carvers that have practised their art since Scoliae first came into  the world; nevertheless they all perish from the decomposition of the  rations supplied, when I try to feed them on Ephippigers paralysed by  the Sphex. Very expert in the method of attacking the Cetonia, they do  not know how to set about the business of discreetly consuming a species  of game new to them. All that escapes them is a few details, for the  trade of an ogre fed on live flesh is familiar to them in its general  features; and these unheeded details are enough to turn their food into  poison. What, then, happened in the beginning, when the larva bit  for the first time into a luscious victim? The inexperienced creature  perished; of that there is not a shadow of doubt, unless we admit an  absurdity and imagine the larva of antiquity feeding upon those terrible  ptomaines which so swiftly kill its descendants to-day.    Nothing will ever make me admit and no unprejudiced mind can admit  that what was once food has become a horrible poison. What the larva of  antiquity ate was live flesh and not putrescence. Nor can it be admitted  that the chances of fortune can have led at the first trial to success  in a system of nourishment so full of pit-falls: fortuitous results are  preposterous amid so many complications. Either the feeding is strictly  methodical at the beginning, in conformity with the organic exigencies  of the prey devoured, and the Wasp established her race; or else it was  hesitating, without determined rules, and the Wasp left no successor. In  the first case we behold innate instinct; in the second acquired habit.    A strange acquisition, truly! An acquisition presumed to be made by  an impossible creature; an acquisition supposed to develop in no less  impossible successors! Though the snow-ball, slowly rolling, at  last becomes an enormous sphere, it is still necessary that the  starting-point shall not have been NIL. The big ball implies the little  ball, as small as you please. Now, in harking back to the origin of  these acquired habits, if I interrogate the possibilities I obtain zero  as the only answer. If the animal does not know its trade thoroughly,  if it has to acquire something, all the more if it has to acquire  everything, it perishes: that is inevitable; without the little  snow-ball the big snow-ball cannot be rolled. If it has nothing to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34645"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 3 (of 6) (#10)"],[1,"ments, and Gio. Martini, by Vasari; and  Martino d'Udine, who in the _Storia Pittorica_, is called Pellegrino di  S. Daniello. The style of the former was harsh and crude, though not  destitute of grace in the countenances and in the colouring. The name of  Pellegrino was bestowed upon the latter by Bellini, in honour of his  rare genius, while the name of the country was attached to him from his  long residence in S. Daniello, a territory not far from Udine. This city  is, nevertheless, the place where he appears to most advantage, in  competition with Giovanni; as the same emulation they had felt while  fellow pupils, continued, as sometimes happens, when they became  masters. In that city appear the labours of each, and more particularly  in the two chapels contiguous to the dome, where the first of them was  employed in the year 1501, the second in 1502. Giovanni, in his  altarpiece of St. Mark, there produced the richest specimen which  appeared from his hand; and Pellegrino left that of his St. Joseph,  preferred by Vasari, in some degree, to the work of Martini. I have seen  the last mentioned picture in oil, faded indeed in colour, and in other  respects defaced; yet still worthy of admiration for its architecture,  which gives a graceful fulness to the whole canvass, and a striking  relief to the three figures, consisting of S. Joseph with the holy child  in his arms, and S. John the Baptist, each of which displays the finest  contours and the best forms. Other specimens of the same pencil are to  be seen in Udine, among which are the SS. Agostino and Girolamo, in the  public council hall, a picture remarkable also for its power of  colouring.    As this artist advanced in age, he improved in the softness of his  tints, as well as in every other quality. The altarpiece at Santa Maria  de' Battuti, which is in Cividale, and represents the Virgin seated  between the four virgins of Aquileja, besides the Saints Batista and  Donato, and a cherub, partakes of Giorgione; it is enumerated among the  rarest paintings of Friuli, and was executed in the year 1529. Yet above  any of his productions, are esteemed those various histories of the life  of our Saviour, painted in fresco at S. Daniele, in the church of S.  Antonio, together with the titular saint, and several other portraits of  the brethren of that chapel, so richly adorned by his hand, all  breathing and glowing proofs of his art. By his means, also, one of the  pictoric schools of Friuli rose into high repute, and will be elsewhere  described.    At Rovigo, in possession of the noble family of Casalini, is a picture  of the Circumcision of our Saviour, bearing this memorandum: _Opus Marci  Belli discipuli Johannis Bellini_. He is a good disciple of the school,  and would appear to be a different artist from that Marco, son of Gio.  Tedesco, who was employed in 1463 at Rovigo.    In the adjacent city of Padua, the style of the Bellini was less  followed, a very natural circumstance in a place where Squarcione, the  avowed rival of Giovanni, held supreme sway. Still there are several  pictures belonging to this age remaining there, which partake of the  Venetian style; and Vasari, in his life of Carpaccio, records, that in  fact Niccolo Moreto executed many works in Padua,[33] besides many other  artists connected with the Bellini. A picture of Christ risen from the  dead, merits particular mention; it adorns the episcopal palace at  Padua, along with the portraits of all the Paduan bishops, and the busts  of the apostles, including several of their acts, executed with much  elegance in chiaroscuro. The work is dated 1495, in which the painter  subscribes his name _Jacobus Montagnana_; not Montagna, as it is written  in Vasari and Ridolfi.    There remains of his a very extensive altarpiece, at the Santo, the  style inclining as much as in any others, to the modern; and to whatever  degree it may partake of the Venetian in taste of colours, in its design  it partakes of a more precise and spare expression upon the principle of  the Paduan School. To this, also, he very manifestly conformed himself,  in that celebrated picture left in Belluno, at the hall of council, in  which he represented[34] Roman histories. It is an immense production,  and at the first view would incline us to attribute it to the pencil of  Mantegna, such is the design, the drapery, and the composition of the  figures; while even several of them are known to have been accurately  copied, with the same forms and motions, from those Mantegna had already  introduced into his grand chapel at the Eremitani. Here we have a clear  proof that both received the same education, or at least, that  Montagnana had profited much by the Paduan School. I say only _much_,  for in point of costume he does not shew any traces of the erudite  instructions of Squarcione; but commits faults resembling those of the  Bellini, to whom by popular opinion, recorded by the very diligent  author of the new Guide of Padua, he has been given as a pupil.    I have before treated of Squarcione, and of his method, reserving for a  fitter place the consideration of his disciples, more especially Andrea  Mantegna. He will, however, be included in the present list as a  scholar; although, as a master of the school of Lombardy, we are bound  to speak of him with more commendation, in another chapter. But even the  first essays of great characters are valuable; and Vasari does not  scruple to commend Andrea's first altarpiece as a work worthy of his old  age. It was placed in Santa Sofia, where the artist has signed himself  _Andreas Mantinea Patavinus annos VII. et X. natus sua manu pinxit,  1448_. Squarcione was so much delighted with his early genius, that he  adopted him for his son. But he afterwards regretted his own generosity,  when the young artist took to wife the daughter of his rival, Jacopo  Bellini; so that he then began to blame him, yet at the same time to  instruct him better. Andrea having been educated in an academy which  adopted the study of marbles, indulged great admiration of several Greek  bassi relievi, in the ancient style, such as is that of the Primarii  Dei, in an altar of the capitol. He was therefore extremely bent upon  acquiring the chasteness of the contours, the beauty of the ideas and of  the bodies; but not content with adopting that straitness of the  garment, those parallel folds, and that study of parts which so easily  degenerates into stiffness, he neglected that portion of his art which  animates the otherwise uninformed images--expression. In this respect he  greatly failed in his picture of the Martyrdom of S. Jacopo, placed in  the church of the Eremitani, and from which Squarcione took occasion to  reprehend him severely. These complaints led him to adopt a better  method, and in his representation of the history of S. Cristoforo,  placed opposite his S. Jacopo, he threw more expression into his  figures; and in particular, his production about the same period of San  Marco, in the act of writing the gospel, painted for Santa Giustina,  displays in the features the absorbed mind of the philosopher and the  enthusiasm of a saint. If Squarcione thus contributed by his reproaches  to render this artist great, the Bellini, perhaps, co-operated with him  by friendship and relationship, in producing the same result. He resided  little in Venice, but during that time he did not fail to avail himself  of the best portion of that school; and we thus perceive in some of his  pictures, landscapes and gardens quite in the Venetian character,  besides a knowledge of colours not inferior to the best Venetian artists  of the age. I am uncertain whether he or some other communicated to the  Bellini that species of perspective so much commended by Barbaro; but I  know that Lomazzo, in his \"Tempio della Pittura,\" page 53, has put on  record _that Mantegna was the first who gave us true notions relating to  this art_: and I know that the most distinguished characters of those  times were equally eager, either to become scholars in such points as  they were themselves deficient in, or masters in such as were wanting in  others.    The style of Mantegna being known, it will not be difficult to divine  that of his fellow pupils, educated in the same maxims, and instructed  by his examples. The chapel before mentioned exhibits specimens of  three, the first of whom, Niccolo Pizzolo is pointed out by Vasari. A  picture of the Assumption of the Virgin in an altarpiece, with other  figures on the wall, are by his hand. There is also a fresco in one of  the facades with the motto _Opus Nicoletti_: and in both places he not  only strongly resembles, but approaches near the composition of  Mantegna. Two other artists also painted there certain histories of S.  Cristoforo, under one of which is inserted _Opus Boni_; under the other,  _Opus Ansuini_, an artist of Forli. Both of these might elsewhere have  been admired; but there they appear only as scholars by the side of  their master. An artist more nearly approaching Mantegna, and who, in  the chief part of his figures might be mistaken for him, is Bernardo  Parentino, who painted for a cloister of Santa Giustina, ten acts in the  life of San Benedetto, and little histories in chiaroscuro, representing  upon each the portrait of a Pontiff of the name of Benedict. I have seen  no painting adapted to a religious cloister so well conceived in every  part; and it is known that it was superintended by a distinguished  scholar of that learned order, the Abate Gaspero da Pavia. Attached to  it is the name of Parentino and the dates of 1489 and 1494. The work was  continued by a Girolamo da Padua, or Girolamo dal Santo, celebrated for  his miniatures, as it is recorded by Vasari and Ridolfi. Here, however,  he exhibits himself a poor artist, in point of design, and still more so  in expression, though praiseworthy in many accessaries of his art, more"]]]
