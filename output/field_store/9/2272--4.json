During his residence at Rome in 1615 and 1616, Galileo had  communicated his views on this subject to the Comte di Lemos, the  Viceroy of Naples, who had presided over the council of the Spanish  Indies. This nobleman advised him to apply to the Spanish minister the  Duke of Lerma; and, through the influence of the Grand Duke Cosmo, his  ambassador at the court of Madrid was engaged to manage the affair. The  anxiety of Galileo on this subject was singularly great. He assured the  Tuscan ambassador that, in order to accomplish this object, \"he was  ready to leave all his comforts, his country, his friends, and his  family, to cross over into Spain, and to stay as long as he might be  wanted at Seville or at Lisbon, or wherever it might be convenient to  communicate a knowledge of his method.\" The lethargy of the Spanish  court seems to have increased with the enthusiasm of Galileo; and though  the negotiations were occasionally revived for ten or twelve years, yet  no steps were taken to bring them to a close. This strange  procrastination has been generally ascribed to jealousy or indifference  on the part of Spain; but Nelli, one of Galileo's biographers, declares,  on the authority of Florentine records, that Cosmo had privately  requested from the government the privilege of sending annually to the  Spanish Indies two Leghorn merchantmen free of duty, as a compensation  for the loss of Galileo!    The failure of this negotiation must have been a source of extreme  mortification to the high spirit and sanguine temperament of Galileo.  He had calculated, however, too securely on his means of putting the new  method to a successful trial. The great imperfection of the time-keepers  of that day, and the want of proper telescopes, would have baffled him  in all his efforts, and he would have been subject to a more serious  mortification from the failure and rejection of his plan, than that  which he actually experienced from the avarice of his patron, or the  indifference of Spain. Even in the present day, no telescope has been  invented which is capable of observing at sea the eclipses of Jupiter's  satellites; and though this method of finding the longitude has great  advantages on shore, yet it has been completely abandoned at sea, and  superseded by easier and more correct methods.    In the year 1618, when no fewer than _three_ comets visited our system,  and attracted the attention of all the astronomers of Europe, Galileo  was unfortunately confined to his bed by a severe illness; but, though  he was unable to make a single observation upon these remarkable bodies,  he contrived to involve himself in the controversies which they  occasioned. Marco Guiducci, an astronomer of Florence, and a friend of  Galileo, had delivered a discourse on comets before the Florentine  Academy. The heads of this discourse, which was published in 1619,[30]  were supposed to have been communicated to him by Galileo, and this  seems to have been universally admitted during the controversy to which  it gave rise. The opinion maintained in this treatise, that comets are  nothing but meteors which occasionally appear in our atmosphere, like  halos and rainbows, savours so little of the sagacity of Galileo that we  should be disposed to question its paternity. His inability to partake  in the general interest which these three comets excited, and to employ  his powerful telescope in observing their phenomena, and their  movements, might have had some slight share in the formation of an  opinion which deprived them of their importance as celestial bodies.  But, however this may have been, the treatise of Guiducci afforded a  favourable point of attack to Galileo's enemies, and the dangerous task  was entrusted to Horatio Grassi, a learned Jesuit, who, in a work  entitled _The Astronomical and Philosophical Balance_, criticised the  discourse on comets, under the feigned name of Lotario Sarsi.         [30] Discorso delle Comete. Printed in the Opere di Galileo, vol.       vi., pp. 117-191.    Galileo replied to this attack in a volume entitled _Il Saggiatore_, or  _The Assayer_, which, owing to the state of his health, was not  published till the autumn of 1623.[31] This work was written in the form  of a letter to Virginio Cesarini, a member of the Lyncaean Academy, and  master of the chamber to Urban VIII., who had just ascended the papal  throne. It was dedicated to the Pontiff himself, and has been long  celebrated among literary men for the beauty of its language, though it  is doubtless one of the least important of Galileo's writings.         [31] Printed in the Opere di Galileo, vol. vi., pp. 191-571.          CHAPTER V.         _Urban VIII., Galileo's friend, raised to the Pontificate--Galileo       goes to Rome to offer his congratulations--The Pope loads Galileo       with presents, and promises a Pension to his Son--Galileo in       pecuniary difficulties, owing to the death of his patron,       Cosmo--Galileo again rashly attacks the Church, notwithstanding the       Pope's kindness--He composes his System of the World, to       demonstrate the Copernican System--Artfully obtains a license to       print it--Nature of the work--Its influence on the public mind--The       Pope resolves on suppressing it--Galileo summoned before the       Inquisition--His Trial--His Defence--His formal abjuration of his       opinions--Observations on his conduct--The Pope shews great       indulgence to Galileo, who is allowed to return to his own house at       Arcetri, as the place of his confinement._      The succession of the Cardinal Maffeo Barberini to the papal throne,  under the name of Urban VIII., was hailed by Galileo and his friends as  an event favourable to the promotion of science. Urban had not only been  the personal friend of Galileo and of Prince Cesi, the founder of the  Lyncaean Academy, but had been intimately connected with that able and  liberal association; and it was therefore deemed prudent to secure his  favour and attachment. If Paul III. had, nearly a century before,  patronised Copernicus, and accepted of the dedication of his great work,  it was not unreasonable to expect that, in more enlightened times,  another Pontiff might exhibit the same liberality to science.    The plan of securing to Galileo the patronage of Urban VIII. seems to  have been devised by Prince Cesi. Although Galileo had not been able for  some years to travel, excepting in a litter, yet he was urged by the  Prince to perform a journey to Rome, for the express purpose of  congratulating his friend upon his elevation to the papal chair. This  request was made in October 1623; and though Galileo's health was not  such as to authorise him to undergo so much fatigue, yet he felt the  importance of the advice, and, after visiting Cesi at Acqua Sparta, he  arrived at Rome in the spring of 1624. The reception which he here  experienced far exceeded his most sanguine expectations. During the two  months which he spent in the capital he was permitted to have no fewer  than six long and gratifying audiences of the Pope. The kindness of his  Holiness was of the most marked description. He not only loaded Galileo  with presents,[32] and promised him a pension for his son Vincenzo, but  he wrote a letter to Ferdinand, who had just succeeded Cosmo as Grand  Duke of Tuscany, recommending Galileo to his particular patronage. \"For  we find in him,\" says he, \"not only literary distinction, but the love  of piety; and he is strong in those qualities by which Pontifical  good-will is easily obtained. And now, when he has been brought to this  city to congratulate us on our elevation, we have very lovingly embraced  him; nor can we suffer him to return to the country whither your  liberality recalls him, without an ample provision of Pontifical love.  And that you may know how dear he is to us, we have willed to give him  this honourable testimonial of virtue and piety. And we further  signify, that every benefit which you shall confer upon him, imitating  or even surpassing your father's liberality, will conduce to our  gratification.\"         [32] A fine painting in gold, and a silver medal, and \"a good       quantity of agnus dei.\"    Not content with thus securing the friendship of the Pope, Galileo  endeavoured to bespeak the good-will of the Cardinals towards the  Copernican system. He had, accordingly, many interviews with several of  these dignitaries; and he was assured, by Cardinal Hohenzoller, that in  a representation which he had made to the Pope on the subject of  Copernicus, he stated to his Holiness, \"that as all the heretics  considered that system as undoubted, it would be necessary to be very  circumspect in coming to any resolution on the subject.\" To this remark  his Holiness replied--\"that the church had not condemned this system;  and that it should not be condemned as heretical, but only as rash;\" and  he added, \"that there was no fear of any person undertaking to prove  that it must necessarily be true.\"    The recent appointment of the Abbe Castelli, the friend and pupil of  Galileo, to be mathematician to the Pope, was an event of a most  gratifying nature; and when we recollect that it was to Castelli that  he addressed the famous letter which was pronounced heretical by the  Inquisition, we must regard it also as an event indicative of a new and  favourable feeling towards the friends of science. The opinions of  Urban, indeed, had suffered no change. He was one of the few Cardinals  who had opposed the inquisitorial decree of 1616, and his subsequent  demeanour was in every respect conformable to the liberality of his  early views. The sincerity of his conduct was still further evinced by  the grant of a pension of one hundred crowns to Galileo, a few"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26005"],[0,"Armour's Monthly Cook Book, Volume 2, No. 12, October 1913 (#10)"],[1,"d, Rye Bread, Butter, Nut Cake, Armour's       Grape Juice Punch.

Little Stories by Our Readers      A Ham Story    [Illustration]    As we are lovers of good ham we always use Armour's Star Brand. I  generally buy the ham on Saturday as it keeps better than fresh meat. I  buy a whole ham (try to get one about ten pounds), then get the dealer  to cut two nice slices thick enough to broil, a little beyond the  center, leaving two nice ends, the string end the smaller. One slice I  use for Sunday morning Breakfast, the other one I wrap in a moist cloth,  place between two plates. This will keep three or four days.    I now take the large end, put it on in cold water, let simmer for a  couple of hours, then take out and drain; cut off skin, and part of the  fat and put it in the oven to finish cooking. The skin I save for use on  the griddle, the fat I render and use the dripping for salads. After  baking, serve hot or cold, sliced; I still have a small end and one  slice left, the small end I boil until thoroughly done, take out and use  the water for vegetables, such as cabbage, spinach, beans, etc. The  small end does not slice as well as the other so I take all the meat  from the bone, and put it through the chopper, grind it fine, and use it  for ham loaf, toast filling for tomato cups or for ham omelet. The baked  end I serve sliced, also, use for sandwiches. If I have to keep the  sandwiches I put them in a moistened napkin; it keeps the ham moist and  juicy.           *       *       *       *       *    How I Arrange to Use a Whole Ham    SUNDAY BREAKFAST: Water cress, slice Star Ham broiled with milk gravy,  hot rolls, coffee, home-made peach cake.    SUNDAY DINNER: Beef pot roast, white potatoes whipped, sweet potatoes  roasted under the meat, cauliflower boiled in the ham water, cream  dressing, fruit sherbet, in which I use Armour's Grape Juice.    SUNDAY SUPPER: Cold baked Star Ham sliced thin, or tomato cups on  lettuce with mustard dressing, white bread and butter, home-made cake,  sliced peaches, and tea.    To make TOMATO CUPS, take medium size tomatoes, skin them (by pouring  boiling water over them first, this is easily done) and put on ice until  cold; scoop out the center. Make a filling of minced ham, a little  chicken, breadcrumbs (equal parts), a seasoning of chopped peppers; fill  tomatoes; on top of each put a little mustard dressing. Set each cup on  a lettuce leaf, and serve.    Now I still have one slice of ham left, some minced ham, some of the  baked ham. The last slice I broil and serve with poached eggs; the baked  ham, makes sandwiches. The week I buy a whole ham I don't buy much other  meat. Trusting this will be of value to some, I remain,--I. M. B.,  Philadelphia.           *       *       *       *       *    Milk Toast    \"Have kept Armour's Beef Extract always on hand for years and it has  helped me out of many a tight place. One day the children teased for  milk toast for supper, and to my dismay I found the milk was 'short'  that day. Not wishing to disappoint them I tried to see what I could do.  I made a consomme with Armour's Beef Extract, using a quarter  teaspoonful to a cup and seasoning it with salt and pepper, and used  this in the same way as I would milk. Our 'milk' toast was fit for a  king. The children pronounced it the best ever. In these times of high  prices, with milk at ten cents per quart, many a family would welcome  such an excellent substitute as Armour's Extract.\"    Most useful are the Armour's Bouillon Cubes. I use them in preparing  soups, gravies, dissolved and poured over a roast while cooking. I give  my husband and children each one in a cup of hot water, every morning  for breakfast, the first thing, as it seems to be an appetizer; also  serve it to my aged parents in the morning before rising, as it gives  them strength to make their toilet. They are both very aged and failing  and the effect of the bouillon is wonderful. My husband also takes  Armour's Bouillon Cubes with him in his lunch basket to the factory  where he holds a clerical position; he keeps his bouillon cup and spoon  and there is plenty of boiling water accessible, so it makes a nice,  nourishing drink at lunch time.--Mrs. E. B., Greensburg, Pa.           *       *       *       *       *    A Red Letter for Armour's Extract    We have a friend who derived more benefit (in our estimation) from  Armour's Extract, than any one we have ever heard of. He is an expert  machinist and is sent to all parts of the world to put up machines, such  as reapers, mowers, etc. The particular trip I write of he was sent to  Bulgaria, to a small village, where the accommodations were very poor.  Sleep was almost out of the question and to eat the black bread, which  was the principal food, was impossible. The water in all foreign  countries was so bad that he always carried jars of the Extract with  him. This time he not only dissolved it in hot water and drank it, but  took his penknife and fed himself the extract raw. He claims it saved  his life, as for four days that was all he had with him to eat or drink.  He says he felt fine and did his work better than when he had been where  the food was palatable and he had eaten heartily. Of course he swears by  the Extract and never takes a trip now without taking a good supply with  him.--Mrs. H. L., Yorktown Heights, Westchester Co., N.
