Yet how  he dreaded to tell the Jacksons of his success. Nat would be so hurt!  Still, they must, of course, know it in time and how much better to hear  the news from Peter himself than in cowardly fashion to leave the spread  of the tidings to rumor. Accordingly he told his tale as bravely as he  could.    \"It isn't as if I deserved it one bit more than you, Nat,\" he concluded.  \"It has just happened to come to me--I've no idea why.\"    \"Of course you deserve it, Peter,\" cried Nat. \"Haven't you worked like a  tiger in the beamhouse ever since you came here? You know you have.  Everybody says so. There isn't a man in the works but likes you and will  be glad at your good luck--I most of all. Some day I'll be making a  start up the ladder myself; wait and see if I don't!\"    Although he spoke with a generous heartiness and made every attempt to  conceal his chagrin, Peter knew that in reality Nat honestly felt that  he had failed to receive the prize that he had rightfully won. Had not  the friendship of the boys been of tough fibre it would have been  shattered then and there. As it was their affection for each other  bridged the chasm and it would have been hard to tell which of them  suffered the more--the lad who through no fault of his own had taken the  award that belonged to his chum, or the lad who had won the prize only  to see it handed to some one else. Peter, who was the victim of success,  seemed of the two the more overwhelmed with regrets and therefore it was  Nat who, despite his bitter disappointment, turned comforter.    \"You mustn't be so cut up over it, Peter, old boy! Of course I know you  didn't have anything to do with it. The men in a factory are like so  many checkers--they are moved about just any way that those higher up  choose to play the game. It is all right and I want you to know I think  so. Don't start in at your new job feeling that I'm sorry you have it.  I'm glad; really I am, Peter!\"    \"It's mighty decent of you, Nat. I wish I had the chance to show you how  much I appreciate it.\"    \"I don't want you to show me; I just want you to believe that I mean  what I say. And you mustn't mind our working in different departments.  We'll be together at noon time just the same. It won't make any  difference.\"    But still Peter was not happy. Day after day he waited hopefully to see  if Mr. Tyler would make good his promise and do something for young  Jackson; but nothing came of it, and no course remained but to accept  unwillingly the promotion and set his foot on this upward rung of the  ladder.    The finishing department occupied several floors of the building devoted  to calfskins, and the first task given Peter was to help stretch and  tack the skins which were still wet from dyeing on boards, after which  they were dried by steam in a large, hot room. In some factories, he  learned, the skins were put in great rooms with open shutters on all  sides, where they dried in the air. But the Coddington Company, he was  told, preferred drying by steam. Peter was very slow at tacking the wet  skins on the boards. The speed with which the boys worked who had been  long at the job astounded him. With lightning swiftness they took up the  big, flat-headed tacks, placed, and struck them. One could scarcely  follow the motions of their hands. Fortunately for Peter he was released  from this work after a few days and set to helping the men who measured  the finished skins in an automatic measuring machine; this machine  recorded the dimensions of the skins on a dial and was a wonderfully  intricate contrivance. Try as he would Peter was unable to fathom how it  could so quickly and exactly compute a problem that it would have taken  him a long time to solve.    Incidentally he learned many other things of the workmen. Some of the  very stiff calfskins, he discovered, were \"dusted\" or laid in bins of  damp sawdust and softened before they were taken to the finishers. There  were a multitude of processes, he found, for converting the leather into  the special kinds desired. What a numberless variety of finishes there  was! There was willow calf--a fine, soft, chrome-tanned leather which,  the foreman told him, was put into the best quality of men's and women's  shoes; box calf--a high grade, storm-proof leather, chrome tanned and  dull finished; chrome calf--finished in tan color, and with a fine,  smooth grain; boarded calf--tanned either in chrome or quebracho; wax  calf--finished by polishing the flesh side until it took a hard, waxy  surface; mat calf that was dull in finish; storm calf, oiled for winter  wear; and French calf, which, like wax calf, was finished on the flesh  side.    \"How in the world could any one think of so many different things to do  to the skin of a calf?\" ejaculated Peter.    His head fairly ached with the information poured into it by the  zealous foreman who, by the way, was an Englishman named Stuart.    \"In time you'll sort out all I have told you,\" Stuart answered  encouragingly, observing Peter's despair. \"It is simple enough when you  once understand the different finishing processes. First the leather is  rolled by machinery until it is pliable enough for the finishers to work  on. Then it goes through a 'putting out' process; by that I mean that it  is laid out on benches where it is stretched and flattened by being  smoothed with a piece of hard rubber; next the edges are trimmed off and  the odd bits sold; some of these go to hardware dealers who use them for  washers or for the thousand and one purposes that leather is needed for  in making tools.\"    \"More economy!\" put in Peter.    \"Yes, I guess you have learned already that we do not waste much here,\"  grinned Stuart.    Peter nodded.    \"Afterward,\" Stuart continued, \"follow the many methods for getting  certain varieties of finish on the leather. Here, for instance, you will  see men graining tan stock by working it by hand into tiny wrinkles;  they use heavy pieces of cork with which they knead the material until  the leather is checked in minute squares. It looks like an easy thing  to do, but it isn't. It requires skilled workmen in order to get  satisfactory results. Over here,\" and he beckoned to Peter, \"men are  making 'boarded calf' by beating and pounding it as you see, that they  may get fine, soft stock. Here still others are glassing the leather and  giving it a smooth surface by rubbing it with a heavy piece of glass.\"    \"And what are those fellows over by the wall doing?\" inquired Peter,  pointing to a group of workmen who, with right leg naked, were standing  in a row and rapidly drawing tan leather first over a wooden upright set  in the floor, and then over their knee.    \"Those,\" Stuart answered, \"are knee-stakers. Strangely enough no machine  has yet been invented which will give to certain kinds of leather the  elasticity and softness which can be put into it by a man's stretching  it over his bare knee. It is a curious way to earn one's living, isn't  it? See how quickly they work and how strong they are. Just look how the  muscles of their legs stand out!\"    \"I should say so,\" Peter answered. \"Why, it almost seems as if they must  have been track sprinters all their lives. They must be well paid.\"    \"What they earn depends on how fast they work,\" Stuart said. \"All this  finishing is piece work. The more a man can do in an hour the higher he  is paid. Almost all these fellows are skilled workmen who have been at  just this task for a long time. They do it rapidly and well, and receive  good wages.\"    Stuart walked on and Peter followed.    \"Here is a machine that makes gun-metal finished leather for the uppers  of black shoes; the leather is, as you see, put through a series of  rollers where it is blacked, oiled, and ironed, and comes out with that  dull surface.\"    \"Are all these different kinds of leather really made from calfskins?\"  asked Peter at last.    \"Practically so--yes,\" replied Stuart. \"Upper or dressed leather is made  from large calfskins or else from kips. Kips, you know, are the skins  of under-sized cows, oxen, horses, buffalo, walrus, and other such  animals. These are tanned and sorted out in the beamhouse when wet. The  thick ones are usually split thin by machinery and the two parts are  finished separately. The part of the leather where the hair grew is the  more valuable and is called the grain; the other part which was next to  the animal is called the split. Remember those two terms--the grain and  the split.\"    \"I'll try my best,\" said Peter with a doubtful shake of his head. \"I am  dreadfully afraid, though, that I shall forget some of the things you  have told me to-day.\"    \"I don't expect you to remember all I've told you, Strong,\" laughed  Stuart, good-naturedly. \"Why, you would not be a human, breathing boy if  you did. It has taken me a long time to learn the facts that I have been  telling you. But do remember about the grain and the split; and while  you are remembering that, try also to remember that a rough split is the  cheapest leather made. Some heavy hides are split two, four, and even  six times and are then sold. You can see this sort of leather up-stairs  in the shipping-room of the other factory, and if I were you I would  take the trouble to go up there some time and look at it. You may be  interested, too, to know----\"    But what the interesting item was Peter never found out.    A boy, breathless from running, came rushing into the room.    \"If you please, sir,\" he panted, \"Mr. Bryant sent me to find Peter  Strong! Young Jackson has been hurt. He slipped on the wet floor and the  wheel of a heavy truck went over his ankle. Jackson says it is only a  sprain, but Mr. Bryant thinks the bones are broken. They've telephoned  for a doctor. Jackson is lying on the floor awful white and still, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25828"],[0,"History of Australia and New Zealand (#10)"],[1,"better than bush tracks,  yet, when he left, there were over three hundred miles of excellent and  substantial roads spreading in all directions from Sydney. He marked out  towns--such as Windsor, Richmond, and Castlereagh--in suitable places;  then, by making roads to them, he encouraged the freed convicts to leave  Sydney and form little communities inland. But his greatest achievement  in the way of road-making was the highway across the Blue Mountains.  This range had for years presented an insurmountable barrier. Many  persons--including the intrepid Bass--had attempted to cross it, but in  vain; the only one who succeeded even in penetrating far into that wild  and rugged country was a gentleman called Caley, who stopped at the  edge of an enormous precipice, where he could see no way of descending.  But in 1813 three gentlemen--named Wentworth, Lawson, and  Blaxland--succeeded in crossing. After laboriously piercing through the  dense timber which covers some of the ranges, they traversed a wild and  desolate country, sometimes crawling along naked precipices, sometimes  fighting their way through wild ravines, but at length emerging on the  beautiful plains to the west. On their return they found that by keeping  constantly on the crest of a long spur, the road could be made much  easier, and Governor Macquarie, stimulated by their report, sent  Surveyor Evans to examine the pass. His opinion was favourable, and  Macquarie lost no time in commencing to construct a road over the  mountains. The difficulties in his way were immense; for fifty miles the  course lay through the most rugged country, where yawning chasms had to  be bridged, and oftentimes the solid rock had to be cut away. Yet, in  less than fifteen months, a good carriage highway stretched from Sydney  across the mountains; and the Governor was able to take Mrs. Macquarie  on a trip to the fine pasture lands beyond, where he founded a town and  named it Bathurst, after Lord Bathurst, the Secretary of State. This was  a measure of great importance to the colony, for the country between the  mountains and the sea was too limited and too much subject to droughts  to maintain the two hundred and fifty thousand sheep which the  prosperous colony now possessed. Many squatters took their flocks along  the road to Bathurst, and settled down in the spacious pasture lands of  the Macquarie and Lachlan Rivers.    [Illustration: BLUE MOUNTAIN SCENERY, WENTWORTH FALLS, NEW SOUTH WALES.]      #3. Governor Brisbane.#--In 1821 Governor Macquarie left for England, much  regretted by the colonists. The only serious mistake of his policy had  been that he had quietly discouraged the introduction of free settlers,  \"because,\" as he said, \"the colony is intended for convicts, and  free settlers have no business here\". His successor--Sir Thomas  Brisbane--and, afterwards, Sir Ralph Darling--adopted a more liberal  policy, and offered every inducement to free immigrants to make their  homes in the colony. It was never found possible, however, to obtain  many of that class which has been so successful in America, consisting  of men who, having with difficulty gathered sufficient money for their  passages, landed in their adopted country without means and with no  resources beyond the cheerful labour of themselves and of their  families, yet settled down in the deep, untrodden forests, and there  made for themselves happy and prosperous homes. This was not the class  of immigrants who arrived in New South Wales during the times of  Brisbane and Darling. For in 1818 free passages to Australia had been  abolished, and the voyage was so long and so expensive that a poor man  could scarcely hope to accomplish it. Hence, those who arrived in  Sydney were generally young men of good education, who brought with them  a few hundred pounds, and not only were willing to labour themselves,  but were able to employ the labour of others. In America, the \"squatter\"  was a man who farmed a small piece of land. In Australia, he was one who  bought a flock of sheep and carried them out to the pasture lands,  where, as they increased from year to year, he grew rich with the annual  produce of their wool. Sir Thomas Brisbane was pleased with the advent  of men of this class: he gave them grants of land and assigned to them  as many convicts as they were able to employ. Very speedily the fine  lands of the colony were covered with flocks and herds; and the  applications for convicts became so numerous that, at one time, two  thousand more were demanded than could be supplied. Hence began an  important change in the colony. The costly Government farms were, one  after another, broken up, and the convicts assigned to the squatters.  Then the unremunerative public works were abandoned; for many of these  had been begun only for the purpose of occupying the prisoners. All this  tended for good; as the convicts, when thus scattered, were much more  manageable, and much more likely to reform, than when gathered in large  and corrupting crowds. In Macquarie's time, not one convict in ten could  be usefully employed; seven or eight years after, there was not a  convict in the colony whose services would not be eagerly sought for at  a good price by the squatters.    This important change took place under Governors Brisbane and Darling,  and was in a great measure due to those Governors; yet, strange to say,  neither of them was ever popular. Brisbane, who entered upon office in  1821, was a fine old soldier, a thorough gentleman, honourable and  upright in all his ways. Yet it could not be doubted that he was out of  his proper sphere when conducting the affairs of a young colony, and in  1825 the British Government found it necessary to recall him.      #4. Governor Darling.#--He was succeeded by Sir Ralph Darling, who was  also a soldier, but was, at the same time, a man well adapted for  business. Yet he, too, failed to give satisfaction. He was precise and  methodical, and his habits were painfully careful, exhibiting that sort  of diligence which takes infinite trouble and anxiety over details, to  the neglect of larger and more important matters. His administration  lasted six years, from 1825 to 1831. During this period an association  was formed in England, consisting of merchants and members of  Parliament, who subscribed a capital of one million pounds, and received  from Government a grant of one million acres in New South Wales. They  called themselves the Australian Agricultural Company, and proposed to  improve and cultivate the waste lands of Australia, to import sheep and  cattle for squatting purposes, to open up mines for coal and metals,  and, in general, to avail themselves of the vast resources of the  colony. Sir Edward Parry, the famous Polar navigator, was sent out as  manager. The servants and _employes_ of the association formed quite a  flourishing colony on the Liverpool Plains, at the head of the Darling  River; and though, at first, it caused some confusion in the financial  state of New South Wales, yet, in the end, it proved of great benefit to  the whole colony.      #5. The Legislative Council.#--In 1824 a small Executive Council had been  formed to consult with Governor Brisbane on colonial matters. In 1829  this was enlarged and became the Legislative Council, consisting of  fifteen members, who had power to make laws for the colony. But as their  proceedings were strictly secret, and could be completely reversed by  the Governor whenever he chose, they formed but a very imperfect  substitute for a truly legislative body. Yet this Council was of some  service to the colony: one of its first acts was to introduce the  English jury system, in place of arbitrary trials by Government  officials.      #6. The Newspaper War.#--Governor Darling was never popular. During the  greater part of his period of office intrigues were continually on foot  to obtain his recall; and from this state of feeling there arose what  has been called the newspaper war, which lasted for four years with  great violence. The first Australian newspaper had been established in  1803 by a convict named Howe. It was in a great measure supported by the  patronage of the Government, and the Governors always exercised the  right of forbidding the insertion of what they disliked. Hence this  paper, the _Sydney Gazette_, was considered to be the Government organ,  and, accordingly, its opinions of the Governors and their acts were  greatly distrusted. But, during the time of Brisbane, an independent  newspaper, the _Australian_, was established by Mr. Wentworth and Dr.  Wardell. A second of the same kind soon followed, and was called the  _Monitor_. These papers found it to their advantage, during the  unpopularity of Darling, to criticise severely the acts of that  Governor, who was defended by the _Gazette_ with intemperate zeal. This  altercation had lasted for some time, when, in the third year of  Darling's administration, a very small event was sufficient to set the  whole colony in an uproar.    A dissipated soldier named Sudds persuaded his companion, Thompson, that  their prospects were not hopeful so long as they remained soldiers; but  that, if they became convicts, they had a fair chance of growing rich  and prosperous. Accordingly, they entered a shop and stole a piece of  cloth. They were tried, convicted, and sentenced to be transported to  Tasmania for seven years. This was what they wished; but Governor  Darling, having heard of the scheme they were so successfully carrying  out, took it upon himself to alter the course of the law, and directed  them to be chained together with heavy spiked collars of iron about  their necks, and to be set to labour on the roads. Sudds was suffering  from liver disease; he sank beneath the severity of his punishment, and  in a few days he died--while Thompson, about the same time, became  insane. This was an excellent opportunity for"]]]
