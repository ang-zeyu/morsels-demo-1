Mrs. Murray's high courage in the bush, her skill in the sick-room, and  that fine spiritual air she carried with her made for her a place in his  imagination where men set their divinities. The hero and the saint in  her stirred his poetic and fervent soul and set it aglow with a feeling  near to adoration. To Mrs. Murray also the events of that night set  forth Ranald in a new light. In the shy, awkward, almost sullen lad  there had suddenly been revealed in those moments of peril the cool,  daring man, full of resource and capable of self-sacrifice. Her heart  went out toward him, and she set herself to win his confidence and to  establish a firm friendship with him; but this was no easy matter.    Macdonald Dubh and his son, living a half-savage life in their lonely  back clearing, were regarded by their neighbors with a certain degree of  distrust and fear. They were not like other people. They seldom mingled  in the social festivities of the community, and consequently were  more or less excluded from friendship and free intercourse with their  neighbors. Ranald, shy, proud, and sensitive, felt this exclusion, and  in return kept himself aloof even from the boys, and especially from the  girls, of his own age. His attendance at school was of a fragmentary and  spasmodic nature, and he never really came to be on friendly terms with  his fellow-pupils. His one friend was Don Cameron, whom the boys called  \"Wobbles,\" from his gait in running, whose father's farm backed that  of Macdonald Dubh. And though Don was a year older, he gave to Ranald a  homage almost amounting to worship, for in all those qualities that  go to establish leadership among boys, Ranald was easily first. In the  sport that called for speed, courage, and endurance Ranald was chief  of all. Fleet of foot, there was no runner from the Twelfth to the  Twentieth that could keep him in sight, and when he stood up to fight,  the mere blaze of his eyes often won him victory before a blow was  struck. To Don, Ranald opened his heart more than to any one else; all  others he kept at a distance.    It was in vain that Mrs. Murray, in her daily visits to Macdonald Dubh,  sought to find out Ranald and to come to speech with him. Aunt Kirsty  never knew where he was, and to her calls, long and loud, from the back  door and from the front, no response ever came. It was Hughie Murray who  finally brought Ranald once more into touch with the minister's wife.    They had come one early morning, Hughie with Fido \"hitched\" in a sled  driving over the \"crust\" on the snow banks by the roadside, and his  mother on the pony, to make their call upon the sick man. As they drew  near the house they heard a sound of hammering.    \"That's Ranald, mother!\" exclaimed Hughie. \"Let me go and find him. I  don't want to go in.\"    \"Be sure you don't go far away, then, Hughie; you know we must hurry  home to-day\"; and Hughie faithfully promised. But alas for Hughie's  promises! when his mother came out of the house with Kirsty, he was  within neither sight nor hearing.    \"They will just be at the camp,\" said Kirsty.    \"The camp?\"    \"Aye, the sugaring camp down yonder in the sugar bush. It is not far off  from the wood road. I will be going with you.\"    \"Not at all, Kirsty,\" said the minister's wife. \"I think I know where  it is, and I can go home that way quite well. Besides, I want to see  Ranald.\" She did not say she would rather see him alone.    \"Indeed, he is the quare lad, and he is worse since coming back from the  shanties.\" Kirsty was evidently much worried about Ranald.    \"Never mind,\" said the minister's wife, kindly; \"we must just be  patient. Ranald is going on fast toward manhood, and he can be held only  by the heart.\"    \"Aye,\" said Kirsty, with a sigh, \"I doubt his father will never be able  any more to take a strap to him.\"    \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Murray, smiling, \"I'm afraid he is far beyond that.\"    \"Beyond it!\" exclaimed Kirsty, astonished at such a doctrine. \"Indeed,  and his father and his uncle would be getting it then, when they were as  beeg as they will ever be, and much the better were they for it.\"    \"I don't think it would do for Ranald,\" said the minister's wife,  smiling again as she said good by to Kirsty. Then she took her way down  the wood road into the bush. She found the camp road easily, and after  a quarter of an hour's ride, she heard the sound of an ax, and soon  came upon the sugar camp. Ranald was putting the finishing touches to a  little shanty of cedar poles and interwoven balsam brush, and Hughie was  looking on in admiration and blissful delight.    \"Why, that's beautiful,\" said Mrs. Murray; \"I should like to live in a  house like that myself.\"    \"Oh, mother!\" shouted Hughie, \"isn't it splendid? Ranald and Don are  going to live in it all the sugaring time, and Ranald wants me to come,  too. Mayn't I, mother? Aw, do let me.\"    The mother looked down upon the eager face, smiled, and shook her head.  \"What about the night, Hughie?\" she said. \"It will be very dark in the  woods here, and very cold, too. Ranald and Don are big boys and strong,  but I'm afraid my little boy would not be very comfortable sleeping  outside.\"    \"Oh, mother, we'll be inside, and it'll be awful warm--and oh, you might  let me!\" Hughie's tears were restrained only by the shame of weeping  before his hero, Ranald.    \"Well, we will see what your father says when he comes home.\"    \"Oh, mother, he will just say 'no' right off, and--\"    A shadow crossed his mother's face, but she only answered quietly,  \"Never mind just now, Hughie; we will think of it. Besides,\" she added,  \"I don't know how much Ranald wants to be bothered with a wee boy like  you.\"    Ranald gave her a quick, shy glance and answered:    \"He will be no trouble, Mrs. Murray\"; and then, noticing Hughie's  imploring face, he ventured to add, \"and indeed, I hope you will let him  come. I will take good care of him.\"    Mrs. Murray hesitated.    \"Oh, mother!\" cried Hughie, seeing her hesitation, \"just one night; I  won't be a bit afraid.\"    \"No, I don't believe you would,\" looking down into the brave young face.  \"But what about your mother, Hughie?\"    \"Oh, pshaw! you wouldn't be afraid.\" Hughie's confidence in his mother's  courage was unbounded.    \"I don't know about that,\" she replied; and then turning to Ranald,  \"How about our friends of the other night?\" she said. \"Will they not be  about?\" Hughie had not heard about the wolves.    \"Oh, there is no fear of them. We will keep a big fire all night, and  besides, we will have our guns and the dogs.\"    \"Guns!\" cried Mrs. Murray. This was a new terror for her boy. \"I'm  afraid I cannot trust Hughie where there are guns. He might--\"    \"Indeed, let me catch him touching a gun!\" said Ranald, quickly, and  from his tone and the look in his face, Mrs. Murray felt sure that  Hughie would be safe from self-destruction by the guns.    \"Well, well, come away, Hughie, and we will see,\" said Mrs. Murray; but  Hughie hung back sulking, unwilling to move till he had got his mother's  promise.    \"Come, Hughie. Get Fido ready. We must hurry,\" said his mother again.    Still Hughie hesitated. Then Ranald turned swiftly on him. \"Did ye  hear your mother? Come, get out of this.\" His manner was so fierce that  Hughie started immediately for his dog, and without another word of  entreaty made ready to go. The mother noted his quick obedience, and  smiling at Ranald, said: \"I think I might trust him with you for a night  or two, Ranald. When do you think you could come for him?\"    \"We will finish the tapping to-morrow, and I could come the day after  with the jumper,\" said Ranald, pointing to the stout, home-made sleigh  used for gathering the sap and the wood for the fire.    \"Oh, I see you have begun tapping,\" said Mrs. Murray; \"and do you do it  yourself?\"    \"Why, yes, mother; don't you see all those trees?\" cried Hughie,  pointing to a number of maples that stood behind the shanty. \"Ranald and  Don did all those, and made the spiles, too. See!\" He caught up a spile  from a heap lying near the door. \"Ranald made all these.\"    \"Why, that's fine, Ranald. How do you make them? I have never seen one  made.\"    \"Oh, mother!\" Hughie's voice was full of pity for her ignorance. He had  seen his first that afternoon.    \"And I have never seen the tapping of a tree. I believe I shall learn  just now, if Ranald will only show me, from the very beginning.\"    Her eager interest in his work won Ranald from his reserve. \"There is  not much to see,\" he said, apologetically. \"You just cut a natch in the  tree, and drive in the spile, and--\"    \"Oh, but wait,\" she cried. \"That's just what I wanted to see. How do you  make the spile?\"    \"Oh, that is easy,\" said Ranald. He took up a slightly concave chisel or  gouge, and slit a slim slab from off a block of cedar about a foot long.    \"This is a spile,\" he exclaimed. \"We drive it into the tree, and the sap  runs down into the trough, you see.\"    \"No, I don't see,\" said the minister's wife. She was too thoroughgoing  to do things by halves. \"How do you drive this into the tree, and how do  you get the sap to run down it?\"    \"I will show you,\" he said, and taking with him a gouge and ax, he  approached a maple still untapped. \"You first make a gash like this.\" So  saying, with two or three blows of his ax, he made a slanting notch in  the tree. \"And then you make a place for the spile this way.\" With the  back of his ax he drove his gouge into the corner of the notch, and then  fitted his spile into the incision so made.    \"Ah, now I see. And you put the trough under the drip from the spile.  But how do you make the troughs?\"    \"I did not make them,\" said Ranald. \"Some of them father made, and some  of them belong to the Camerons. But it is easy enough. You just take a  thick slab of basswood"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3289"],[0,"The Valley of Fear (#10)"],[1,"at unexpected  strangers. I was perfectly certain that he had some powerful enemies,  that he believed they were on his track, and that he was always on  his guard against them. I was so sure of it that for years I have been  terrified if ever he came home later than was expected.\"    \"Might I ask,\" asked Holmes, \"what the words were which attracted your  attention?\"    \"The Valley of Fear,\" the lady answered. \"That was an expression he has  used when I questioned him. 'I have been in the Valley of Fear. I am not  out of it yet.'--'Are we never to get out of the Valley of Fear?' I have  asked him when I have seen him more serious than usual. 'Sometimes I  think that we never shall,' he has answered.\"    \"Surely you asked him what he meant by the Valley of Fear?\"    \"I did; but his face would become very grave and he would shake his  head. 'It is bad enough that one of us should have been in its shadow,'  he said. 'Please God it shall never fall upon you!' It was some real  valley in which he had lived and in which something terrible had  occurred to him, of that I am certain; but I can tell you no more.\"    \"And he never mentioned any names?\"    \"Yes, he was delirious with fever once when he had his hunting accident  three years ago. Then I remember that there was a name that came  continually to his lips. He spoke it with anger and a sort of horror.  McGinty was the name--Bodymaster McGinty. I asked him when he recovered  who Bodymaster McGinty was, and whose body he was master of. 'Never of  mine, thank God!' he answered with a laugh, and that was all I could get  from him. But there is a connection between Bodymaster McGinty and the  Valley of Fear.\"    \"There is one other point,\" said Inspector MacDonald. \"You met Mr.  Douglas in a boarding house in London, did you not, and became engaged  to him there? Was there any romance, anything secret or mysterious,  about the wedding?\"    \"There was romance. There is always romance. There was nothing  mysterious.\"    \"He had no rival?\"    \"No, I was quite free.\"    \"You have heard, no doubt, that his wedding ring has been taken. Does  that suggest anything to you? Suppose that some enemy of his old life  had tracked him down and committed this crime, what possible reason  could he have for taking his wedding ring?\"    For an instant I could have sworn that the faintest shadow of a smile  flickered over the woman's lips.    \"I really cannot tell,\" she answered. \"It is certainly a most  extraordinary thing.\"    \"Well, we will not detain you any longer, and we are sorry to have put  you to this trouble at such a time,\" said the inspector. \"There are some  other points, no doubt; but we can refer to you as they arise.\"    She rose, and I was again conscious of that quick, questioning glance  with which she had just surveyed us. \"What impression has my evidence  made upon you?\" The question might as well have been spoken. Then, with  a bow, she swept from the room.    \"She's a beautiful woman--a very beautiful woman,\" said MacDonald  thoughtfully, after the door had closed behind her. \"This man Barker  has certainly been down here a good deal. He is a man who might be  attractive to a woman. He admits that the dead man was jealous, and  maybe he knew best himself what cause he had for jealousy. Then there's  that wedding ring. You can't get past that. The man who tears a wedding  ring off a dead man's--What do you say to it, Mr. Holmes?\"    My friend had sat with his head upon his hands, sunk in the deepest  thought. Now he rose and rang the bell. \"Ames,\" he said, when the butler  entered, \"where is Mr. Cecil Barker now?\"    \"I'll see, sir.\"    He came back in a moment to say that Barker was in the garden.    \"Can you remember, Ames, what Mr. Barker had on his feet last night when  you joined him in the study?\"    \"Yes, Mr. Holmes. He had a pair of bedroom slippers. I brought him his  boots when he went for the police.\"    \"Where are the slippers now?\"    \"They are still under the chair in the hall.\"    \"Very good, Ames. It is, of course, important for us to know which  tracks may be Mr. Barker's and which from outside.\"    \"Yes, sir. I may say that I noticed that the slippers were stained with  blood--so indeed were my own.\"    \"That is natural enough, considering the condition of the room. Very  good, Ames. We will ring if we want you.\"    A few minutes later we were in the study. Holmes had brought with him  the carpet slippers from the hall. As Ames had observed, the soles of  both were dark with blood.    \"Strange!\" murmured Holmes, as he stood in the light of the window and  examined them minutely. \"Very strange indeed!\"    Stooping with one of his quick feline pounces, he placed the slipper  upon the blood mark on the sill. It exactly corresponded. He smiled in  silence at his colleagues.    The inspector was transfigured with excitement. His native accent  rattled like a stick upon railings.    \"Man,\" he cried, \"there's not a doubt of it! Barker has just marked the  window himself. It's a good deal broader than any bootmark. I mind that  you said it was a splay-foot, and here's the explanation. But what's the  game, Mr. Holmes--what's the game?\"    \"Ay, what's the game?\" my friend repeated thoughtfully.    White Mason chuckled and rubbed his fat hands together in his  professional satisfaction. \"I said it was a snorter!\" he cried. \"And a  real snorter it is!\"          Chapter 6--A Dawning Light        The three detectives had many matters of detail into which to inquire;  so I returned alone to our modest quarters at the village inn. But  before doing so I took a stroll in the curious old-world garden which  flanked the house. Rows of very ancient yew trees cut into strange  designs girded it round. Inside was a beautiful stretch of lawn with an  old sundial in the middle, the whole effect so soothing and restful that  it was welcome to my somewhat jangled nerves.    In that deeply peaceful atmosphere one could forget, or remember only  as some fantastic nightmare, that darkened study with the sprawling,  bloodstained figure on the floor. And yet, as I strolled round it and  tried to steep my soul in its gentle balm, a strange incident occurred,  which brought me back to the tragedy and left a sinister impression in  my mind.    I have said that a decoration of yew trees circled the garden. At the  end farthest from the house they thickened into a continuous hedge.  On the other side of this hedge, concealed from the eyes of anyone  approaching from the direction of the house, there was a stone seat.  As I approached the spot I was aware of voices, some remark in the deep  tones of a man, answered by a little ripple of feminine laughter.    An instant later I had come round the end of the hedge and my eyes  lit upon Mrs. Douglas and the man Barker before they were aware of my  presence. Her appearance gave me a shock. In the dining-room she had  been demure and discreet. Now all pretense of grief had passed away from  her. Her eyes shone with the joy of living, and her face still quivered  with amusement at some remark of her companion. He sat forward, his  hands clasped and his forearms on his knees, with an answering smile  upon his bold, handsome face. In an instant--but it was just one instant  too late--they resumed their solemn masks as my figure came into view.  A hurried word or two passed between them, and then Barker rose and came  towards me.    \"Excuse me, sir,\" said he, \"but am I addressing Dr. Watson?\"    I bowed with a coldness which showed, I dare say, very plainly the  impression which had been produced upon my mind.    \"We thought that it was probably you, as your friendship with Mr.  Sherlock Holmes is so well known. Would you mind coming over and  speaking to Mrs. Douglas for one instant?\"    I followed him with a dour face. Very clearly I could see in my mind's  eye that shattered figure on the floor. Here within a few hours of the  tragedy were his wife and his nearest friend laughing together behind a  bush in the garden which had been his. I greeted the lady with reserve.  I had grieved with her grief in the dining room. Now I met her appealing  gaze with an unresponsive eye.    \"I fear that you think me callous and hard-hearted,\" said she.    I shrugged my shoulders. \"It is no business of mine,\" said I.    \"Perhaps some day you will do me justice. If you only realized--\"    \"There is no need why Dr. Watson should realize,\" said Barker quickly.  \"As he has himself said, it is no possible business of his.\"    \"Exactly,\" said I, \"and so I will beg leave to resume my walk.\"    \"One moment, Dr. Watson,\" cried the woman in a pleading voice. \"There is  one question which you can answer with more authority than anyone else  in the world, and it may make a very great difference to me. You know  Mr. Holmes and his relations with the police better than anyone  else can. Supposing that a matter were brought confidentially to his  knowledge, is it absolutely necessary that he should pass it on to the  detectives?\"    \"Yes, that's it,\" said Barker eagerly. \"Is he on his own or is he  entirely in with them?\"    \"I really don't know that I should be justified in discussing such a  point.\"    \"I beg--I implore that you will, Dr. Watson! I assure you that you will  be helping us--helping me greatly if you will guide us on that point.\"    There was such a ring of sincerity in the woman's voice that for the  instant I forgot all about her levity and was moved only to do her will.    \"Mr. Holmes is an independent investigator,\" I said. \"He is his own  master, and would act as his own judgment directed. At the same time, he  would naturally feel loyalty towards the officials who were working on  the same case, and he would not conceal from them anything which would  help them in bringing a criminal to justice. Beyond this I can say  nothing, and I would refer you to Mr. Holmes himself if you wanted  fuller information.\"    So saying I raised my hat and"]]]
