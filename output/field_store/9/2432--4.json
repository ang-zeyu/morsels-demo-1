To any one versed in  the breeding of poultry this indicates that these peculiar types had  been made by very skillful breeders long before. The most reasonable  supposition is that these breeders were monks in the monasteries of  Central Europe. Throughout the Middle Ages the monks of Europe, more  than any other class of men, worked for improvement in agriculture as  well as for the advancement of learning.    [Illustration: Fig. 35. Houdan cock. (Photograph from the Houdan Yards,  Sewickley, Pennsylvania)]    [Illustration: Fig. 36. White Minorca hen. (Photograph from Tioga  Poultry Farm, Apalachin, New York)]    =French races.= The Houdan is the only French breed well known in  America. It is of the Polish type, but heavier, and the plumage is  mottled irregularly, not distinctly marked as in the party-colored  varieties of Polish. The breed takes its name from the town of Houdan,  the center of a district in which this is the common type of fowl.    =Spanish races.= The fowls of Spanish origin well known outside of Spain  are the White-faced Black Spanish, the Black Minorca, and the Blue  Andalusian. The fowls of Spain at the present time are mostly of the  Italian type, with black (or in some districts blue) the predominant  color. The Black Spanish seems to have been known in Holland and England  for two hundred years or more. In Spain the white face is but moderately  developed. The monstrous exaggeration of this character began in Holland  and was carried to the extreme by British fanciers who admired it.    [Illustration: Fig. 37. Black Minorca cock. (Photograph from Arthur  Trethaway, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania)]    The Black Minorca is supposed to have been brought to England direct  from Spain about a century ago. There it was bred to much greater size,  with the comb often so large that it was a burden to the fowl. Blue  Andalusians, at first called Blue Spanish and Blue Minorcas, were first  known in England about 1850.    =Asiatic races of fowls.= The evolution of races of fowls in the Orient  gave some general results strikingly different from those in Europe. As  far as is known, after the introduction of fowls into China and India  some thousand years ago the stock which went to those countries and that  which descended from it was completely isolated from the fowls of  Western Asia, Africa, and Europe until the eighteenth century. When  commerce between Europe, India, and the East Indies began, the Europeans  found in these countries fowls of a much more rugged type than those of  Europe. Some of these fowls were much larger than any that the visitors  had seen. The Aseel of India was a small but very strong, stocky type of  Game. Among the Malayans the common fowl was a large, coarse type of  Game. The hens of these breeds laid eggs of a reddish-brown color, while  hens of all the races of Europe laid white eggs. Birds of both these  types were taken to England early in the last century, and perhaps in  small numbers before that time.    [Illustration: Fig. 38. Buff Cochin hen[5]]    [Illustration: Fig. 39. Buff Cochin cock[5]]    [5] Photograph from Tienken and Case, Rochester, Michigan.    [Illustration: Fig. 40. Dark Brahma hen]    =Chinese races.= In China a type of fowl in some ways much like the  Malay, in others quite different, had been developed as the common stock  of the country. They were about as tall as the Malays, much heavier, and  very quiet and docile. They were of various colors, had feathers on the  shanks and feet, and laid brown eggs. Some of these fowls were brought  to America in sailing vessels very early in the last century and  occasionally after that until the middle of the century, but attracted  no attention, for the birds were brought in small numbers for friends of  sailors or for persons particularly interested in poultry, and at that  time there was no means of communication between fanciers in different  localities.    [Illustration: Fig. 41. Dark Brahma cockerel]    =Japanese races.= Although the Japanese races of fowls had no particular  influence on the development of poultry culture in America, they are of  great interest in a study of poultry types, because, when intercourse  between Japan and Western nations began, it was found that the ordinary  fowls of Japan were much like the ordinary fowls of Europe and America,  and not, as would be expected, like the fowls of China. This indicated  that there had been no exchange of fowls between China and Japan after  the type in China became changed. It also affords strong evidence that  the fowls of India and China, although so changed, were originally like  the European and Japanese common fowls. The special races developed in  Japan were Game Fowls, more like the European than the Malay type; a  long-tailed fowl, very much like the Leghorn in other respects; and the  very short-legged Japanese Bantam.    [Illustration: Fig. 42. Long-Tailed Japanese Phoenix cockerel.  (Photograph from Urban Farms, Buffalo, New York)]    =The \"hen-fever\" period.= We are all familiar with the phrase \"the hen  fever\" and with its application to persons intensely interested in  poultry, but few know how it originated. The interest in better poultry  that had been slowly growing in the Eastern states culminated in 1849 in  an exhibition in the Public Garden in Boston, to which fanciers from  eastern Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and eastern Connecticut brought  their choicest and rarest specimens. This was the first poultry show  held in America. Nearly fifteen hundred birds were exhibited, and the  exhibitors numbered over two hundred. There were a few birds of other  kinds, but fowls made by far the greater part of the show. All the  principal races of Europe and Asia were represented. Most of the  exhibitors lived in the immediate vicinity of Boston. About ten thousand  people attended this exhibition.    Such an event created a great sensation. Newspaper reports of it reached  all parts of the country. The Chinese fowls, so large when compared with  others, were most noticed. At once a great demand for these fowls and  for their eggs arose, and prices for fancy poultry, which previously had  been but little higher than prices for common poultry, rose so high that  those who paid such prices for fowls were commonly regarded as  monomaniacs. While the interest was not as great in other kinds of fowls  as in the Shanghais, Cochin Chinas, and \"Brahmaputras,\" as they were  then called, all shared in the boom, and within a few years there was  hardly a community in the northeastern part of the United States where  there was not some one keeping highly bred fowls. When the interest  became general, the famous showman, P. T. Barnum, promoted a show of  poultry in the American Museum in New York City. Many celebrated men  became interested in fine poultry. Daniel Webster had been one of the  exhibitors at the first show in 1849. The noted temperance lecturer,  John B. Gough, was a very enthusiastic fancier.    After a few years the excitement began to subside, and most people  supposed that it was about to die, never to revive. A Mr. Burnham, who  had been one of the most energetic promoters of Asiatic fowls, and had  made a small fortune while the boom lasted, had so little confidence in  the permanence of the poultry fancy that he published a book called \"The  History of the Hen Fever,\" which presented the whole movement as a  humbug skillfully engineered by himself. This book was very widely read,  and the phrase \"the hen fever,\" applying to enthusiastic amateur poultry  keepers, came into common use.    Subsequent developments showed that those who had supposed that the  interest in fine poultry was only a passing fad were wrong. The true  reason for its decline at that time was that the nation was approaching  a crisis in its history and a civil war. When the war was over, the  interest in poultry revived at once, and has steadily increased ever  since. The prices for fine specimens, which were considered absurd in  the days of the hen fever, are now ordinary prices for stock of high  quality.    [Illustration: Fig. 43. Barred Plymouth Rock cock. (Photograph from  Bureau of Animal Industry, United States Department of Agriculture)]    =How the American breeds arose.= It is natural to suppose that with such  a variety of types of fowls, from so many lands, there was no occasion  for Americans to make any new breeds. If, however, you look critically  at the foreign breeds, you may notice that not one of them had been  developed with reference to the simple requirements of the ordinary  farmer and poultry keeper. It was the increasing demand for eggs and  poultry for market that had given the first impulse to the interest in  special breeds. The first claim made for each of these was that it was a  better layer than the ordinary fowl. In general, these claims were true,  but farmers and others who were interested primarily in producing eggs  and poultry for the table were rather indifferent to the foreign breeds,  because, among them all, there was not one as well adapted to the  ordinary American poultry keeper's needs as the old Dominique or as the  occasional flocks of the old native stock that had been bred with some  attention to size and to uniformity in other characters.    To every foreign breed these practical poultry keepers found some  objection. The Dorking was too delicate, and its five-toed feet made it  clumsy. The Hamburgs, too, were delicate, and the most skillful breeding  was required to preserve their beautiful color markings. The superfluous  feathers on the heads of the crested breeds and on the feet of the  Asiatics were equally objectionable. All the European races except the  Leghorns had white skin and flesh-colored or slate-colored feet, while  in America there was a very decided popular preference for fowls with  yellow skin and legs.

Dobby here has already fitted him out with a complete army,  and various other things, too numerous to mention.\"    \"Why, look who's here!\" cried Dobbleigh, interrupting the doctor, as the  door swung open a third time, and Seymour appeared, his raiment  consisting of a blanket and a pair of carpet slippers, causing him in  the dim light to give the impression of an Indian on the warpath. \"By  Jove, Tommy,\" he added, \"all you need is a tomahawk in one hand, and a  bunch of wooden cigars in the other, to pass for the puller-in of a  tobacco shop. What are you after, sneaking in here like old Sitting  Bull, at this unholy hour of the morning? After the kid's scalp?\"    \"Why, you see, Dobby,\" replied Seymour, revealing a soft, furry cap and  a pair of gloves that looked as if they had just been pulled off the  paws of a bear cub, \"I happened to be taking these things home for my  boy Jim--he's daft on skating, and it's cold as the dickens up at  Blairsport--but Jimmie can wait until New Year's for his, I guess. It  came over me all of a sudden, while I was trying to get to sleep  upstairs, that our honored guest might find them useful.\"    \"Look at those chapped little fists,\" said the doctor. \"That's your  answer, Seymour!\"    \"They're his, all right,\" said Seymour, sitting on the side of the bed,  and comparing the gloves with the red little hands that lay inert on the  counterpane. \"By Jove!\" he muttered, as he took one of the diminutive  hands in his own. \"They're like sandpaper.\"    [Illustration: One by one the prisoners of the night dropped in  surreptitiously. _Page_ 155.]    \"Selling papers in winter doesn't give these babies exactly the sort of  paddies you'd expect to find on a mollycoddle,\" said the doctor.    And so, here in the House of the Seven Santas, things went for the next  hour. One by one all the prisoners of the night, with the exception of  Ricketts, dropped in surreptitiously, to find that the ideas of each  were common to them all, and the little mite under the bedclothes was  destined soon to emerge from the riches of his dreams into a reality  even richer and more substantial. The varied gifts were ranged about  the foot of the bed, the golf stockings bulging with sweets were hung at  its head, and the big-hearted donors retired, this time to that real  sleep which comes to him who has had the satisfaction of some kindly  deed to look back upon.    \"Poor Ricketts!\" sighed the doctor, as he noted the one absentee. \"How  much these old bachelors lose at this season of the year!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Two hours later, just as the first rays of the dawn began to light up  the guest room, its small occupant opened his eyes, and began rubbing  them violently with his fists.    \"Chee!\" was his first utterance, and then he sat up and gazed about  him. His unfamiliar surroundings naturally puzzled him, and a look of  childish wonder came over his face. \"Where'm I at?\" he muttered. \"Guess  diss must be dat Heaven place de guys down to de mission talks about.\"    He clambered out of bed, and as he did so his eyes took in the wondrous  array of gifts spread before him.    \"Well, whad'd'yer know about dat?\" he muttered. \"What kind of a choint  is diss, anyhow?\"    As he attempted to walk across the room his small feet became entangled  in the flowing skirt of Mallerby's bath robe, which he wore in lieu of a  nightshirt.    \"Dat's it,\" he said, as he tripped, and stumbled to the floor. \"I'm  dead, dat's what I am--and dese is my anchel clo'es. Chee, but dey's  hard to walk in. Seems to me I'd radder have me pants.\"    In a moment he had regained his feet, and the marvelous variety of toys  began to reveal themselves in detail to his astounded vision.    \"Will yer pipe de layout!\" he gasped ecstatically. \"Wonder what kid's  goin' to have de luck to draw dem in his socks?\"    And just then the door opened again, and a sleepy-eyed old bachelor came  stealing in, in the person of Ricketts. He wore his pajamas, and a  yellow mackintosh thrown over his shoulders.    \"Good morning, kiddie,\" he said, closing the door softly behind him.  \"Merry Christmas to you!\"    \"Merry Chrissmus yerself!\" smiled the youngster. \"Say, mister, kin yer  tell me where I'm at? Diss ain't like my reg'lar lodgin' house, and I  must ha' got in wrong somehow.\"    \"Where is your regular lodging house?\" asked Ricketts, seating himself  on the side of the bed.    \"Oh, any old place where dere's room fer me an' me feet at de same  time,\" replied the boy. \"Packin' boxes mostly in de winter-time, and de  docks in de summer.\"    \"But your parents?\" demanded Ricketts. \"Where are they?\"    \"Me what?\" asked the boy.    \"Your parents--your father and mother?\" explained Ricketts.    \"I ain't never had no mudder,\" said the boy. \"But me fadder--well, me  an' him had a scrap over me wages las' summer, and I ain't seen him  since.\"    \"Your wages, eh?\" smiled Ricketts. The idea of this little tad earning  wages struck him as being rather humorous.    \"He t'ought I ought to give him de whole wad,\" said the boy, \"and when  he licked me for spendin' a nickel on meself and a fr'en' o' mine las'  Fourth o' July, I give him de skidoo.\"    \"I see,\" said Ricketts, regarding the little guest with a singular light  in his eye. \"You've got a fine lot of stuff here from old Santa Claus,  haven't you?\"    \"What, me?\" asked the boy, gazing earnestly into Ricketts' face. \"Is  dese here t'ings for me?\"    \"Why, of course,\" said Ricketts. \"Old Daddy Santa Claus on his rounds  last night found you occupying a handsome apartment on Fifth Avenue, but  the steam heat had been turned off, and, fearing you might catch cold,  he picked you up and brought you to his own home. He'd been looking for  you all day.\"    \"And dese is--really--_fer me_?\" cried the child.    \"Every blessed stick and shred of them,\" said Ricketts fervently.    The boy squatted flat upon the floor, completely staggered by the sudden  revelation of his wealth.    \"_Chee!_\" was all he could think of to say.    And then began a romp through a veritable toyland, in which two lonely  wanderers through the vales of life had the first taste of joys they had  never known before; the red-headed little son of the streets getting the  first glimpse of kindness that his starved little soul had ever enjoyed;  the confirmed old bachelor finding the only outlet that fate had ever  vouchsafed him for those instincts of fatherhood which are the priceless  heritage of us all.    Small wonder that the play waxed fast, furious, and noisy. The lad, up  to this time confronted ever with the pressing necessities of life,  developed a capacity for play that was all the more intense for the  privations of his limited years; the bachelor finding the dam of his  pent-up feelings loosened into an overwhelming flood of pure joyousness.  There were cries of joy, and shrieks of laughter, and when, with some  difficulty, because of his lack of experience, Ricketts finally  succeeded in getting the lad arrayed in his rough-rider suit, whose  buckles and buttons seemed aggravatingly small for hands that had  developed nothing but thumbs, the tin trumpet, with all the stops save  the one that would silence it even temporarily, was brought into play;  and the battles that were fought in the ensuing hour between a noble  army of warriors, led by the youngster against himself as either a  Spanish army or a wild Indian tribe, have no equals in the annals of  warfare.    The morning was pretty well advanced when the other sleeping Santas were  roused from their dreams by shouts of victory, to be confronted upon  investigation by a prostrate enemy, in the person of Ricketts, lying  face downward upon the floor, with a diminutive rough-rider standing  upon the small of his back, waving a nickel sword in the air, while he  blew ear-splitting blasts upon his trumpet to announce the arrival of  the conqueror.    \"Well, well, well!\" said Doctor Mallerby, with a loud laugh, as he and  the others burst into the room. \"What's going on? Another San Juan  Hill?\"    \"The same,\" panted Ricketts, from his coign of disadvantage. \"And I'm  the hill. All that remains now is for some of you fellows to hurry up,  and get a bath towel from somewhere, and hoist the flag of truce.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The morning passed, and the storm showing some signs of abatement, the  exiled men began to cherish hopes of getting home before night.  Communication with the railway station elicited the gratifying news that  about four o'clock in the afternoon a train would be sent forth to carry  the marooned suburbanites back to the scenes of their domestic desires.    Meanwhile, the honored guest received to the full all the attention of  which the Seven Santas were capable; only in making up for the lost  playtime of the past the guest proved to be untiring, while the Seven  Santas were compelled now and then to work in relays in order to keep up  with the game.    Hence it was that at various hours of the day dignified business men  were to be seen squatting upon the floor, irrespective of that dignity,  running iron cars over tin railway tracks, arranging the serried ranks  of tin soldiers in battle array, answering strident summonses to battle  sounded on that everlasting tin trumpet, and, strange to say, joining  their young friend in feasts of candy and other digestion-destroying  sweets which they had forever eschewed long years before.    \"I suppose I'll suffer for this,\" said Grantham, as at the command of  his superior officer he swallowed the handle of a peppermint walking  stick, after fletcherizing it carefully for several minutes, \"but, by  ginger, it's worth it.\"    \"You'll be all right, Gran,\" laughed the doctor. \"If worst comes to the  worst, I'll blow you to a pony of ipecac, unless you prefer squills.\"    But at last even the strenuous"]]]
