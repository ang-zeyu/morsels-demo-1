I had to admit that I could not share his hopes of  the influence of an artistic portrayal of the sufferings of the weavers  upon the people of wealth. Self-satisfied virtue is hard to move. Rather  did I believe that a great work of art, treating of the life of the  masses, was bound to rouse their consciousness to their own conditions.    At that time, I believe, Hauptmann had already completed his \"Weavers.\"  His journey into the weaving district was not to collect material for  the structure of that tremendous play, rather than it was devoted to  details, localities and landscapes. He had already drawn up the outline  for his other play, \"College Crampton,\" portraying a genial and joyous  man, of whom narrowness and miserableness of surroundings make a  caricature and who is finally wrecked.    Langenbielau, after our journey through the Golgatha of poverty, seemed  a place of relief. The mills, with the increasing noise of machines that  dulls the ears and racks the nerves, are by no means an elevating sight,  but they bring the workingmen together and awaken their feeling and  understanding of solidarity and the necessity for concerted action.  Here, in spite of sunken chests, great fatigue, poor nourishment, one  felt the breeze of the struggling proletarian mind that indicated a new  land of regeneration, beyond the misery of our times.    For one of the evenings a gathering of the older weavers was arranged.  Hauptmann had a plate set for each one. During the meal a lively  discussion developed. There was one weaver, Mathias, very bony, and with  a skin like parchment, very poor, but blessed with many children. He  related of a bet he had won. The owner of the tavern where we were  having our feast had expressed doubt as to the ability of Mathias to  consume three pounds of pork at once. He volunteered to do it, if the  meat would be paid for and a quantity of beer added to it. A neighbor  was intrusted with the preparation of the roast. At the appointed hour  Mathias appeared, together with two other men as witnesses of the  contest. The prize eating began, when Mathias was confronted by an  obstacle: Five children belonging to the neighbor surrounded the table,  with their eyes widely opened at the unusual sight of a roast. Their  little faces expressed great desire and their mouths began to water. The  prize eater felt very uncomfortable before the longing look of the  children. He imagined himself a hard-hearted guzzler, only concerned  about his own stomach. He forgot the bet, cut up some of the meat and  was about to place it before the children, when a howl of protest arose.  This was not permitted, if he wanted to win he would have to eat the  entire roast himself. Mathias submitted, but dropped his eyes in shame  before the children. Time and again he involuntarily passed portions of  meat to them, but his attempts were frustrated by renewed protests. He  could not continue, however, until the little ones were taken out into  the cold. There was no other place, since the only room was taken up by  the parties concerned in the contest. They might have been put into the  cold, dark garret, but that would have been too cruel and would have  made Mathias unable to carry out the feat. The undertaking was  finished, but the winner felt quite wretched; he was conscious of having  committed a great sin against the simplest of human demands.    The conversation turned to the uprising of the weavers in 1844. Many  incidents of those days were related. Various legend-like and fantastic  stories told. Also names of people of the neighborhood who had  participated in that historic event.    The entire affair was very informal and simple, and not an atom of the  oppressive atmosphere one feels in the relations between the members of  the upper and lower stations of life.    The next morning we started for Kaschbach. The place looked even more  dismal than the one we had visited the day previous. In one of the huts  a weaver, with a swollen arm in a sling, led us into a corner of the  room. On a bunk covered with straw and rags lay a woman with a little  baby near her. Its body was covered with a terrible rash, perfectly  bare, almost hidden within the floor rags. The shy father, himself in  pain, stood near, the personification of helplessness. If only there  were food in the house! The district physician? He would have been  compelled to prescribe food, light, warmth and sanitation for every hut  he visited, if he did not wish his science to prove a mockery. He could  not do that, so he came but rarely. Humanitarianism, thus far your name  is impotency! All that could be done was to leave money and hurry out  into the air.    The next abode might be considered pleasant compared with the previous  one. Two elderly people, not so worn and wan, and not so ragged. The man  was weaving, still having some work at times; his wife, very pleasant  and amiable, was almost ready to praise the good fortune of their home.  \"We are better off than our neighbors,\" she said with some pride. She  pointed to a freshly cut loaf of bread, to the fire in the oven, to a  table and a real bed--a great fortune, indeed. The walls were covered  with some colored prints, representing virtue, patience, endurance to  the end. One picture showed the return of the prodigal son, one the  ejection of Hagar from the house of Abraham. Our hostess could boast of  the luxury of a coffee mill even, and, after she had ground and brewed  the coffee, we were invited to partake of it, which we gratefully did.  Local and general affairs were talked over; the man, quite talkative,  but careful and reticent in his remarks, especially when religious and  political questions were approached. His remarks were kept within  careful lines so as not to offend. Hauptmann said afterwards that he had  noticed such cautiousness in all weavers. No doubt it had grown out of  the great poverty that often brought out diffidence and reticence toward  strangers.    Hauptmann sat on a low stool, and, while we were sipping our coffee, the  woman petted him tenderly on the brow. \"Yes, yes, young man, Want, the  awfulness of Want, but we cannot complain.\" At our departure, she  pointed to a hut nearby and said: \"The people in there are nearly  starved.\" It was not exaggerated. When we entered, we saw a woman in the  dismal gray of the room, surrounded by a number of crying children. Two  or three of the maturer girls, thin and pale and drawn out by the  Procrustean bed of poverty, secretly wiped the last drops of tears from  their suffering faces. Hunger reigned supreme within these walls. The  woman, in the last stage of pregnancy, suffered the keenest under the  lamentations of the younger children, to whom she could give no food.  The husband had been gone two days on a begging tramp. He would surely  bring home something, though it was very difficult to get anything in  this neighborhood. One must tramp a long distance for a piece of bread.  Yesterday they could still obtain a few potatoes, but to-day she had  nothing more to give, nor did she know what to tell the children. She  had implored the minister to let her have something to eat, if only a  few morsels, but he had nothing himself, he said. The tightly pressed  lips of the older girls trembled violently, every breath of the family  was despair. Our presence had silenced the cries of the children with  the frost-bitten faces, but when we left, they again would tear the  heart of their mother, their weak little voices calling for bread.    No one could expect such fatalism from these starving little ones, that  they should coolly and philosophically analyse the \"economic necessity\"  that condemned their parents to a desperate battle with hunger. The only  thing that could perform miracles here was a coin. The poor woman did  not dare to believe that she actually held one in her hand. That which  was to secure these unfortunates relief from death, at the same moment  fostered elsewhere conceit, corruption and extravagance, and is being  used for the conversion of heathen to brotherly love. The terrible sight  of this mother and her little ones conjured up the heartlessness and  emptiness of all philanthropy and charity for dumb misery. Greatest of  all social crimes, that makes the possibility of stilling the hunger of  the little children dependent on money.    One morning Hauptmann and I went on foot to Reichenbach, where I  introduced him to an old weaver, a Socialist, who had participated in  the co-operative scheme proposed by Bismarck. The old man had much of  interest to relate of this venture, that had been very meagerly assisted  by the government. He said that the association could have survived, had  it not been for the conspiracy of the manufacturers, who had a large  capital at their disposal. The result of this, for the co-operative  movement, was the closing of the market. At one time all the weaving  products sent to the Leipzig Fair had to be transported back; a  clandestine but effective boycott had made the sale thereof impossible.  With much more gusto he related the days of Lassalle's agitation--that  had brought life into the still limbs of the masses, a great change had  seemed to be at hand. The wife of our old friend, too, had hoped for the  change; but now, she remarked somewhat resigned, \"we old people would  rejoice if we were confident that the young generation would live to  bring about the change.\"    In this house we met a widow with a thirteen-year-old daughter.  Hauptmann found the child very striking. She had beautiful, soft,  golden-blond hair, deep-set eyes and a very delicate, pale complexion. I  learned later that he sent her occasional gifts. And when I read  \"Hannele\" I could not rid myself of the thought"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27341"],[0,"Mother Earth, Vol. 1 No. 4, June 1906 (#10)"],[1," at the next Court, if the case so requires;  provided, and it is the meaning of the Court, that men and women shall  have liberty to wear out such apparel as they are now provided of  (except the immoderate great sleeves, slashed apparel, immoderate great  veils, long wings, etc.).\" What intolerable tyranny of private  surveillance is indicated in the phrase, \"what any man shall judge to be  uncomely\"!    In the second letter of instructions (dated June, 1629) to Endicott and  his Council, they are exhorted to prevent the sale of \"strong waters\" to  the Indians, and to punish any of their own people who shall become  drunk in the use of them. In the preamble to a law enacted in 1646, one  is led to expect an enforcement of the modern principles of abstinence  and prohibition; since, after declaring that \"drunkenness is a vice to  be abhorred of all nations, especially of those which hold out and  profess the Gospel of Christ Jesus,\" it goes on to assert that \"any  strict laws against the sin will not prevail unless the cause be taken  away.\" But it would seem that \"the cause,\" in the eyes of our Puritan  lawmakers, was an indiscriminate sale of spirituous drinks; for the law  chiefly enacts that none but \"vintners\" shall have permission to retail  wine and \"strong water.\" It is also permitted to constables to search  any tavern, or even any private house, \"suspected to sell wine contrary  to this order.\" Moreover, no person is \"to drink or tipple at  unseasonable times in houses of entertainment,\"--the \"unseasonable\" time  being declared to be after nine in the evening.    But these laws were of small avail, for, in 1648, the Court is grieved  to confess: \"It is found by experience that a great quantity of wine is  spent, and much thereof abused to excess of drinking and unto  drunkenness itself, notwithstanding all the wholesome laws provided and  published for the preventing thereof.\" It therefore orders, that those  who are authorized to sell wine and beer shall not harbor a drunkard in  their houses, but shall forthwith give him up to be dealt with by the  proper officer, under penalty of five pounds for disobedience.    In 1636 one \"Peter Bussaker was censured for drunkenness to be whipped  and to have twenty stripes sharply inflicted, and fined L5 for slighting  the magistrates,\" etc. In March, 1634, it was ordered, \"that Robert  Coles, for drunkenness by him committed at Roxbury, shall be  disfranchised, wear about his neck and so to hangg upon his outward  garment a D made of red cloth and set upon white; to continue this for a  year, and not to leave it off at any time when he comes amongst company,  under penalty of 40s. for the first offence and L5 for the second.\" What  was the efficacy of the whipping or the \"scarlet letter,\" we are not  informed.    Of course, people capable of such legislation must frame fantastic  definitions of Liberty. Here is an old one whose sentiments have been  often parroted by unthinking humans of modern times. It reads: \"True  Liberty consists in a freedom of doing and receiving good under the  protection of a government solicitous for the people's good.\" Such has  always been the tyrant's conception of freedom, and, strange to say,  finds many endorsements even to this day.    It has recently been solemnly announced from the judicial bench that the  only liberty an American has is the liberty to do the right thing, of  course according to other people's conception of right. That is  precisely the kind of tyranny or liberty that was enjoyed by the victims  of the paternalistic laws above described.    Persons afflicted with newspaper intelligence express their conception  that the individual has no rights that government may not invade, by  that hollow phrase, \"Liberty under the Law.\" Liberty under the law is  what the government-ridden peasants of Russia enjoy. Liberty under the  law was the pleasure of those who expired with indescribable agony on  the rack and amid the flames. Liberty under the law was meted out to the  millions of victims of the witchcraft delusion. Liberty under the law  was also the liberty of our Southern chattel slaves before as well as  after the war. Liberty under the law is the same old idea of liberty  which every tyrant has ever advanced. As for myself, I shouldn't object  to a little liberty in spite of the law, when that does not conform to  the rule of liberty as laid down by Herbert Spencer in these words:  \"Every man has freedom to do all that he wills, provided he infringes  not the equal freedom of any other man.\"          AIM AND TACTICS OF THE TRADE-UNION MOVEMENT.    By MAX BAGINSKI.      TRADE unionism represents to the working man the most natural form of  association with his fellow-brother. This medium became a necessity to  him when he was confronted by modern industrialism and the power of  capitalism. It dawned on him that the individual producer had not a  shadow of a chance with the owner of the means of production, who,  together with the economic power, enjoyed the protection of the State  with its various weapons of warfare and coercion. In the face of such a  giant master all the appeals of the workingman to the love of justice  and common humanity went up into smoke.    The beginning of modern industry found the producer in abject slavery  and without the understanding of an organized form of resistance.  Exploitation reigned supreme, ever seeking to sap the last drop of  strength of its victims. No mercy for the common man, nor any  consideration shown for his life, his health, growth and development.  Capitalism's only aim was the accumulation of profits, of wealth and  power, and to this moloch everything else was ruthlessly sacrificed.    This spirit of accumulation did not admit of the right of the masses to  think, feel, or demand; it merely considered them a class of coolies,  specially created, as it were, for their masters' use.    This notion is still in vogue to-day, and if the conditions of the  workers at this moment are somewhat better, somewhat more endurable, it  is not thanks to the milk of human kindness of the money power.  Whatsoever the workingmen have achieved in the way of better human  conditions,--a higher standard of living, or a partial recognition of  their rights,--they have wrenched from their enemies through a hard and  bitter struggle that required great endurance, tremendous courage and  many sacrifices.    The tendency to treat the people as a herd of sheep the purpose of which  is to serve as food for parasites is still very strong; but this  tendency no longer goes unchallenged; it is being met with tremendous  opposition; increased social knowledge and revolutionary ideas have  taught the workingmen to unite their efforts against those who have been  comfortably seated on their backs for centuries past.    The first unskilled attempt on the part of the people to gain a clear  conception of their position brought out blind hatred against the  technical methods of exploitation instead of hatred against the latter.    In England, for instance, the workingmen considered machinery their  deadly foe, to be gotten rid of by all means. The simple axiom that  machinery, factories, mines, land, together with every other means of  production, if only in the hands of the entire community, would serve  for the comfort and happiness of all, instead of being a curse, was a  book of seven seals for the people in those days. And even at this late  hour this simple truth is entertained by a comparative few, though more  than one decade of socialistic and anarchistic enlightenment has passed.    The first trade-unionistic attempts have met with the same ferocious  persecution that Anarchism is being met with to-day. Even as to-day  capital avails itself of the strongest weapons of government in its  attack upon labor. The authorities were not slow in passing laws against  trade unionism and every effort for organization was at that time  considered high treason, organizers and all those who participated in  strikes were considered aides and abettors of crime and conspiracy,  punishable with long years of imprisonment and, in many cases, even with  death.    At the behest of Money, the State sent human bloodhounds on the trail of  the man who in any way was suspected in participating in the trade-union  movement. The most villainous and brutal methods were employed to  counteract the growth and success of labor organizations. The powers  that be recognized the great force that is contained in organized labor  as the means of the regeneration of society much quicker than the  workingmen themselves. They felt this force hanging like a Damocles  sword over their heads, which danger made them dread the future, and  nothing was left undone to nip this force in the bud.    The fundamental principle of trade unionism is of a revolutionary  character and, as such, it never was and never can be a mere palliative  for the adjustment of Labor to Capital. Hence, it must aim at the social  and economic reconstruction of society.    Many labor leaders in this country, who consider their duty performed  when they sit themselves at the table of wealth and authority, trying to  bring about peace and harmony between Capital and Labor, might greatly  profit by the history of trade-unionism and the various economic  struggles it has fought.    Only ignorance can account for the birth of such superficial stuff on  the labor question as the book of John Mitchell that has been launched  upon the market through loud and vulgar advertisement. Nothing could  have disproved the fitness of Mr. Mitchell for a labor leader so  drastically as this book.    As already stated, the violent attempt to kill trade unionism or its  organizations have proven futile. The swelling tide of the labor  movement could not be stopped. The social and economic problem brought  to light by modern industry demanded a hearing, produced various"]]]
