For they are all parched with the sun.\"    They walked a long way side by side, and Ulenspiegel seemed thoughtful,  muttering from time to time:    \"I'll make 'em pay--I'll make 'em pay for their Masses for the dead!\"    \"What Masses are those you speak of?\" Nele inquired. \"And who is to  pay for them?\"    Ulenspiegel answered:    \"All the deans, cures, clerks, beadles and the rest, both superior  and inferior, who feed us with their trash. See now, if I had happened  to be a strong working man they would have robbed me of the value of  three years' labour by making me thus to go on this pilgrimage. But as  things are, it is the poor Claes who pays. Ah, but they shall give me  back my three years a hundredfold, and with their own money I myself  will sing for them their Masses for the dead!\"    \"Alas, Tyl!\" said Nele, \"be prudent, or they will have you burnt  alive.\"    \"I am fireproof,\" answered Ulenspiegel.    And they parted from one another, she all in tears, he heart-broken  and angry.              XXIV      Once in the open country, Ulenspiegel shook himself like a dog, or  like a bird that has regained its liberty, and his heart was cheered  by the trees and fields and the bright sunshine.    When he had walked on thus for three days he came to the outskirts of  Brussels, and to the wealthy township of Uccle. And there, passing in  front of the inn with the sign of the Trumpet, his attention was drawn  to a most heavenly odour of fricassee. A little urchin who stood by  was also sniffing the delightful perfume of the sauce, and Ulenspiegel  asked him in whose honour it was that there rose to heaven such odour  of festal incense. The boy made answer that the Guild of the Jolly  Face was to meet at the inn that evening after vespers, to celebrate  the deliverance of the town by the women and girls of olden time.    Now in the distance Ulenspiegel saw a high pole with a popinjay on  the top of it, and the pole was set in the ground, and round it were  a company of women armed with bows and arrows. He asked the boy if  women were become archers nowadays?    The boy, still sniffing greedily the savour of the sauces, replied that  in the days of the Good Duke the very bows that were now being used  by those women had been the means of killing over a hundred brigands.    Ulenspiegel desired to know further concerning this matter, but the  boy said that he could tell no more, so hungry was he, unless forsooth  Ulenspiegel would give him a patard with which he might buy food and  drink. This Ulenspiegel did, for he felt sorry for him.    No sooner had the boy received the patard than he rushed into the  tavern like a fox to the hen-house, and presently reappeared in  triumph with half a sausage and a large loaf of bread.    And now Ulenspiegel was suddenly aware of a sweet sound of viols  and tabors, and soon he saw a number of women dancing together, and  among them a woman of great beauty with a chain of gold hanging round  her neck.    The boy, who had by this time assuaged his hunger and was grinning  with delight, informed Ulenspiegel that the beautiful woman was the  Queen of Archery, that her name was Mietje, and that she was wife to  Messire Renonckel, alderman of the parish. Then he asked Ulenspiegel  to give him six liards for a drink. Ulenspiegel gave him the money,  and when he had thus eaten and drunk his fill the urchin sat himself  down in the sun and fell to picking his teeth with his nails.    When the women archers noticed Ulenspiegel standing there in his  pilgrim's habit, they came and began to dance round him in a ring,  crying:    \"Hail pilgrim, hail! Do you come from far away, you handsome pilgrim  boy?\"    Ulenspiegel, thinking sadly of Nele, thus made answer:    \"I come from Flanders, a lovely land and filled with lovesome girls.\"    \"What crime have you committed?\" asked the women, stopping in their  dance.    \"I dare not confess it, so great it was,\" said he.    They asked him the reason why it was needful for him to journey thus  with a pilgrim's staff and wallet, and those scalloped oysters that  are the sign of the pilgrim.    \"The reason is,\" he replied, not quite truthfully, \"that I said that  Masses for the dead are advantageous to the priests.\"    \"True, they bring many a sounding denier to the priests,\" they  answered; \"but are they not also of advantage to the souls in  purgatory!\"    \"I have never been there,\" answered Ulenspiegel.    \"Will you come dine with us?\" said the prettiest of the archers.    \"Willingly would I dine with you,\" said he, \"and dine off you into  the bargain! You and all your companions in turn, for you are morsels  fit for a king, more delicate to swallow than any ortolan or thrush  or snipe!\"    \"Nay,\" they answered, \"but we are not for sale.\"    \"Then perhaps you will give?\" he asked them.    \"Yea, verily,\" they laughed, \"a good box on the ear to such as are too  bold. And if needs were we would beat you now like a bundle of corn!\"    \"Thank you,\" he said, \"I will go without the beating.\"    \"Well then,\" they said, \"come in to dinner.\"    So he followed them into the inn yard, glad for their fresh young  faces. And thereafter he saw the Brethren of the Jolly Face themselves,  who were now entering the yard with great ceremony, and by their  own jolly appearance living up most conspicuously to the name of  their Guild.    They scrutinized Ulenspiegel with some curiosity, till one of the women  informed them who he was--a pilgrim they had picked up on the road,  and whom, being a good red-face like unto their husbands and their  sweethearts, they had invited to share in the entertainment. The men  were agreeable to this proposal, and one of them addressed himself  to Ulenspiegel:    \"Pilgrim on pilgrimage, what say you now to continuing your pilgrimage  across some sauce and fricassee?\"    \"I shall have need of my seven-league boots,\" answered Ulenspiegel.    Now as he was following them into the festal hall, he noticed twelve  blind men coming along the Paris road. And as they passed they were  lamenting most piteously their hunger and thirst. But Ulenspiegel  said to himself that they should dine that night like kings, and all  at the expense of the Dean of Uccle himself, and in memory of the  Masses for the dead.    He accosted them, saying:    \"Here are nine florins for you. Come in to dinner. Do you not smell  the good smell of fricassee?\"    \"Ah!\" they cried, \"for the last half-league, and without hope!\"    \"Now you can eat your fill,\" said Ulenspiegel, \"for you have nine  florins.\"    But he had not really given them anything.    \"The Lord bless you,\" they said. For being blind, each man believed his  neighbour had been given the money. And shown the way by Ulenspiegel,  they all sat down at a small table while the Brethren of the Jolly  Face took their seats at a long one, together with their wives and  their daughters.    Then, with the complete assurance that comes from the possession of  nine florins:    \"Mine host,\" cried the blind men insolently, \"give us now to eat and  to drink of your best.\"    The landlord, who had heard tell of the nine florins and thought that  they were safe in the blind men's purse, asked them what they would  like for their dinner.    Then they all began to talk at once at the top of their voices:    \"Bacon and peas, hotchpotch of beef and veal, chicken and lamb! And  where are the sausages--were they made for the dogs, pray? And who  is he that has smelt out the black and white puddings in the passage  without collaring them for us? I used to be able to see them, alas,  in the days when my poor eyes were bright as candles! And where is the  buttered koekebakken of Anderlecht? Sizzling in the frying-pan, juicy  and crackling, enough to make a fish thirsty for drink! Ho there! But  who will bring me eggs and ham, or ham and eggs, twin friends of my  palate? And where are you, you choesels, that float in a heavenly mess  of meats and kidneys, coxcombs, sweetbreads, ox-tails, lamb's feet,  with many onions, pepper, cloves, nutmegs, all in a stew, and three  pints at least of best white wine for sauce? And who will bring you  to me divine, chitterlings, you that are so good that one does not  utter a word while you are being swallowed! And they come straight  from Luyleckerland, a land bursting with fatness and filled with happy  lazy folk, whose passion for good things to eat is never assuaged! And  where are you, dried leaves of autumns past? Now quick there! Bring  me a leg of mutton with broad beans. And for me, some pig's ears  grilled with bread-crumbs. And for me, a chaplet of ortolans. Verily  the snipe shall figure the Paters, and a fat capon the Credo.\"    Mine host answered quietly:    \"I will bring you an omelette made with sixty eggs. And as sign-posts  to guide your spoons, I will plant fifty black puddings in the midst,  all smoking on a veritable mountain of good cheer; and from the top of  all some dobbel peterman shall flow down like a river on every side.\"    At this the mouths of the poor blind men began to water indeed,  and they said:    \"Then serve us, pray, and that right quickly with the mountain,  the sign-posts, and the river!\"    And the Brethren of the Jolly Face, who were now all seated at table  with their wives, remarked to Ulenspiegel that this should be called  the Day of the Invisible Feast; for that the blind men could not see  what they were eating, and thus, poor things, were deprived of half  their pleasure.    At last it came--the omelette all garnished with cress and parsley,  carried by mine host himself and four of his cooks--and the blind men  desired to fall to incontinently, and at once began to set their paws  upon it. But mine host was determined to serve each of them fairly,  and, however difficult it might be, to make sure that each trencher  had its just"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3760"],[0,"Sybil, Or, The Two Nations (#10)"],[1,"courts and factions--in  a palace in a garden, meet scene for youth, and innocence, and  beauty--came the voice that told the maiden she must ascend her throne!    The council of England is summoned for the first time within her bowers.  There are assembled the prelates and captains and chief men of her  realm; the priests of the religion that consoles, the heroes of the  sword that has conquered, the votaries of the craft that has decided the  fate of empires; men grey with thought, and fame, and age; who are the  stewards of divine mysteries, who have encountered in battle the hosts  of Europe, who have toiled in secret cabinets, who have struggled in the  less merciful strife of aspiring senates; men too, some of them, lords  of a thousand vassals and chief proprietors of provinces, yet not one of  them whose heart does not at this moment tremble as he awaits the first  presence of the maiden who must now ascend her throne.    A hum of half-suppressed conversation which would attempt to conceal the  excitement, which some of the greatest of them have since acknowledged,  fills that brilliant assemblage; that sea of plumes, and glittering  stars, and gorgeous dresses. Hush! the portals open; She comes! The  silence is as deep as that of a noontide forest. Attended for a moment  by her royal mother and the ladies of her court, who bow and then  retire, VICTORIA ascends her throne; a girl, alone, and for the first  time, amid an assemblage of men.    In a sweet and thrilling voice, and with a composed mien which indicates  rather the absorbing sense of august duty than an absence of emotion,  THE QUEEN announces her accession to the throne of her ancestors, and  her humble hope that divine providence will guard over the fulfilment of  her lofty trust.    The prelates and captains and chief men of her realm then advance to the  throne, and kneeling before her, pledge their troth, and take the sacred  oaths of allegiance and supremacy.    Allegiance to one who rules over the land that the great Macedonian  could not conquer; and over a continent of which even Columbus never  dreamed: to the Queen of every sea, and of nations in every zone.    It is not of these that I would speak; but of a nation nearer her  foot-stool, and which at this moment looks to her with anxiety, with  affection, perhaps with hope. Fair and serene, she has the blood and  beauty of the Saxon. Will it be her proud destiny at length to bear  relief to suffering millions, and with that soft hand which might  inspire troubadours and guerdon knights, break the last links in the  chain of Saxon thraldom?      END OF THE FIRST BOOK          BOOK II          Book 2 Chapter 1        The building which was still called MARNEY ABBEY, though remote from the  site of the ancient monastery, was an extensive structure raised at  the latter end of the reign of James the First, and in the stately and  picturesque style of that age. Placed on a noble elevation in the centre  of an extensive and well wooded park, it presented a front with two  projecting wings of equal dimensions with the centre, so that the form  of the building was that of a quadrangle, less one of its sides. Its  ancient lattices had been removed, and the present windows though  convenient accorded little with the structure; the old entrance door in  the centre of the building however still remained, a wondrous specimen  of fantastic carving: Ionic columns of black oak, with a profusion of  fruits and flowers, and heads of stags and sylvans. The whole of the  building was crowned with a considerable pediment of what seemed at the  first glance fanciful open work, but which examined more nearly offered  in gigantic letters the motto of the house of Marney. The portal opened  to a hall, such as is now rarely found; with the dais, the screen, the  gallery, and the buttery-hatch all perfect, and all of carved black oak.  Modern luxury, and the refined taste of the lady of the late lord, had  made Marney Abbey as remarkable for its comfort and pleasantness of  accommodation as for its ancient state and splendour. The apartments  were in general furnished with all the cheerful ease and brilliancy of  the modern mansion of a noble, but the grand gallery of the seventeenth  century was still preserved, and was used on great occasions as the  chief reception-room. You ascended the principal staircase to reach  it through a long corridor. It occupied the whole length of one of the  wings; was one hundred feet long, and forty-five feet broad, its walls  hung with a collection of choice pictures rich in history; while the  Axminster carpets, the cabinets, carved tables, and variety of easy  chairs, ingeniously grouped, imparted even to this palatian chamber a  lively and habitable air.    Lord Marney was several years the senior of Charles Egremont, yet still  a young man. He was handsome; there was indeed a general resemblance  between the brothers, though the expression of their countenances was  entirely different; of the same height and air, and throughout the  features a certain family cast; but here the likeness ceased. The  countenance of Lord Marney bespoke the character of his mind; cynical,  devoid of sentiment, arrogant, literal, hard. He had no imagination, had  exhausted his slight native feeling, but he was acute, disputatious,  and firm even to obstinacy. Though his early education had been very  imperfect, he had subsequently read a good deal, especially in French  literature. He had formed his mind by Helvetius, whose system he deemed  irrefutable, and in whom alone he had faith. Armed with the principles  of his great master, he believed he could pass through existence in  adamantine armour, and always gave you in the business of life the idea  of a man who was conscious you were trying to take him in, and rather  respected you for it, but the working of whose cold, unkind, eye defied  you.    There never had been excessive cordiality between the brothers even in  their boyish days, and shortly after Egremont's entrance into life, they  had become estranged. They were to meet now for the first time since  Egremont's return from the continent. Their mother had arranged their  reconciliation. They were to meet as if no misunderstanding had ever  existed between them; it was specially stipulated by Lord Marney, that  there was to be no \"scene.\" Apprised of Egremont's impending arrival,  Lord Marney was careful to be detained late that day at petty sessions,  and entered the room only a few minutes before dinner was announced,  where he found Egremont not only with the countess and a young lady who  was staying with her, but with additional bail against any ebullition  of sentiment in the shape of the Vicar of Marney, and a certain Captain  Grouse, who was a kind of aide-de-camp of the earl; killed birds and  carved them; played billiards with him, and lost; had indeed every  accomplishment that could please woman or ease man; could sing, dance,  draw, make artificial flies, break horses, exercise a supervision  over stewards and bailiffs, and make every body comfortable by taking  everything on his own shoulders.    Lady Marney had received Egremont in a manner which expressed the  extreme satisfaction she experienced at finding him once more beneath  his brother's roof. When he arrived indeed, he would have preferred  to have been shown at once to his rooms, but a message immediately  delivered expressed the wish of his sister-in-law at once to see him.  She received him alone and with great warmth. She was beautiful, and  soft as May; a glowing yet delicate face; rich brown hair, and large  blue eyes; not yet a mother, but with something of the dignity of the  matron blending with the lingering timidity of the girl.    Egremont was glad to join his sister-in-law again in the drawing-room  before dinner. He seated himself by her side; and in answer to her  enquiries was giving her some narrative of his travels; the Vicar who  was very low church, was shaking his head at Lady Marney's young friend,  who was enlarging on the excellence of Mr Paget's tales; while Captain  Grouse, in a very stiff white neck-cloth, very tight pantaloons, to show  his very celebrated legs, transparent stockings and polished shoes,  was throwing himself into attitudes in the back ground, and with a zeal  amounting almost to enthusiasm, teaching Lady Marney's spaniel to  beg; when the door opened, and Lord Marney entered, but as if to make  security doubly sure, not alone. He was accompanied by a neighbour and  brother magistrate, Sir Vavasour Firebrace, a baronet of the earliest  batch, and a gentleman of great family and great estate.    \"Well Charles!\"    \"How are you George?\"    And the brothers shook hands.    'Tis the English way; and if they had been inclined to fall into each  other's arms, they would not probably have done more.    In a few minutes it was announced that dinner was served, and so,  secured from a scene, having a fair appetite, and surrounded by dishes  that could agreeably satisfy it, a kind of vague fraternal sentiment  began to stir the breast of Lord Marney: he really was glad to see  his brother again; remembered the days when they rode their poneys and  played cricket; his voice softened, his eyes sparkled, and he at length  exclaimed, \"Do you know, old fellow, it makes me quite happy to see you  here again. Suppose we take a glass of wine.\"    The softer heart and more susceptible spirit of Egremont were well  calculated to respond to this ebullition of feeling, however slight; and  truly it was for many reasons not without considerable emotion, that  he found himself once more at Marney. He sate by the side of his gentle  sister-in-law, who seemed pleased by the unwonted cordiality of her  husband, and anxious by many kind offices to second every indication of  good feeling on his part. Captain Grouse was extremely assiduous: the  vicar was of the deferential breed, agreed "]]]
