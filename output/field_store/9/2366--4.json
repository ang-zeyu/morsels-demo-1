Day after day he  worried her by following her about, and often, furious at her lasting  hatred, he would knock her down and tear out mouthfuls of her soft fur  till his rage cooled somewhat, when he would let her go for a while. But  his fixed purpose was to kill Rag, whose escape seemed hopeless. There  was no other swamp he could go to, and whenever he took a nap now he had  to be ready at any moment to dash for his life. A dozen times a day  the big stranger came creeping up to where he slept, but each time the  watchful Rag awoke in time to escape. To escape yet not to escape. He  saved his life indeed, but oh! what a miserable life it had become. How  maddening to be thus helpless, to see his little mother daily beaten  and torn, as well as to see all his favorite feeding-grounds, the cosy  nooks, and the pathways he had made with so much labor, forced from him  by this hateful brute. Unhappy Rag realized that to the victor belong  the spoils, and he hated him more than ever he did fox or ferret.    How was it to end? He was wearing out with running and watching and bad  food, and little Molly's strength and spirit were breaking down under  the long persecution. The stranger was ready to go to all lengths to  destroy poor Rag, and at last stooped to the worst crime known among  rabbits. However much they may hate each other, all good rabbits forget  their feuds when their common enemy appears. Yet one day when a great  goshawk came swooping over the Swamp, the stranger, keeping well under  cover himself, tried again and again to drive Rag into the open.    Once or twice the hawk nearly had him, but still the briers saved him,  and it was only when the big buck himself came near being caught that he  gave it up. And again Rag escaped, but-was no better off. He made up his  mind to leave, with his mother, if possible, next night and go into the  world in quest of some new home when he heard old Thunder, the hound,  sniffing and searching about the outskirts of the swamp, and he resolved  on playing a desperate game. He deliberately crossed the hound's view,  and the chase that then began was fast and furious. Thrice around the  Swamp they went till Rag had made sure that his mother was hidden safely  and that his hated foe was in his usual nest. Then right into that nest  and plump over him he jumped, giving him a rap with one hind foot as he  passed over his head.    \"You miserable fool, I'll kill you yet,\" cried the stranger, and up he  jumped only to find himself between Rag and the dog and heir to all the  peril of the chase.    On came the hound baying hotly on the straight-away scent. The buck's  weight and size were great advantages in a rabbit fight, but now they  were fatal. He did not know many tricks. Just the simple ones like  'double,' 'wind,' and 'hole-up,' that every baby Bunny knows. But the  chase was too close for doubling and winding, and he didn't know where  the holes were.    It was a straight race. The brierrose, kind to all rabbits alike,  did its best, but it was no use. The baying of the hound was fast and  steady. The crashing of the brush and the yelping of the hound each time  the briers tore his tender ears were borne to the two rabbits where  they crouched in hiding. But suddenly these sounds stopped, there was a  scuffle, then loud and terrible screaming. Rag knew what it meant and it  sent a shiver through him, but he soon forgot that when all was over and  rejoiced to be once more the master of the dear old Swamp.    VIII    Old Olifant had doubtless a right to burn all those brush-piles in  the east and south of the Swamp and to clear up the wreck of the old  barbed-wire hog-pen just below the spring. But it was none the less  hard on Rag and his mother. The first were their various residences and  outposts, and the second their grand fastness and safe retreat.    They had so long held the Swamp and felt it to be their very own in  every part and suburb--including Olifant's grounds and buildings--that  they would have resented the appearance of another rabbit even about the  adjoining barnyard.    Their claim, that of long, successful occupancy, was exactly the same as  that by which most nations hold their land, and it would be hard to find  a better right.    During the time of the January thaw the Olifants had cut the rest of the  large wood about the pond and curtailed the Cottontails' domain on all  sides. But they still clung to the dwindling Swamp, for it was their  home and they were loath to move to foreign parts. Their life of daily  perils went on, but they were still fleet of foot, long of wind, and  bright of wit. Of late they had been somewhat troubled by a mink that  had wandered upstream to their quiet nook. A little judicious guidance  had transferred the uncomfortable visitor to Olifant's hen-house. But  they were not yet quite sure that he had been properly looked after.  So for the present they gave up using the ground-holes, which were, of  course, dangerous blind-alleys, and stuck closer than ever to the briers  and the brush-piles that were left.    That first snow had quite gone and the weather was bright and warm until  now. Molly, feeling a touch of rheumatism, was somewhere in the lower  thicket seeking a teaberry tonic. Rag was sitting in the weak sunlight  on a bank in the east side. The smoke from the familiar gable chimney  of Olifant's house came fitfully drifting a pale blue haze through the  underwoods and showing as a dull brown against the brightness of the  sky. The sun-gilt gable was cut off midway by the banks of brier brush,  that, purple in shadow, shone like rods of blazing crimson and gold in  the light. Beyond the house the barn with its gable and roof, new gift  at the house, stood up like a Noah's ark.    The sounds that came from it, and yet more the delicious smell that  mingled with the smoke, told Rag that the animals were being fed cabbage  in the yard. Rag's mouth watered at the idea of the feast. He blinked and  blinked as he snuffed its odorous promises, for he loved cabbage dearly.  But then he had been to the barnyard the night before after a few paltry  clover-tops, and no wise rabbit would go two nights running to the same  place.    Therefore he did the wise thing. He moved across where he could not  smell the cabbage and made his supper of a bundle of hay that had been  blown from the stack. Later, when about to settle for the night, he was  joined by Molly, who had taken her teaberry and then eaten her frugal  meal of sweet birch near the Sunning Bank.    Meanwhile the sun had gone about his business elsewhere, taking all  his gold and glory with him. Off in the east a big black shutter came  pushing up and rising higher and higher; it spread over the whole sky,  shut out all light and left the world a very gloomy place indeed. Then  another mischief-maker, the wind, taking advantage of the sun's absence,  came on the scene and set about brewing trouble. The weather turned  colder and colder; it seemed worse than when the ground had been  covered with snow.    \"Isn't this terribly cold? How I wish we had our stove-pipe brush-pile,\"  said Rag.    \"A good night for the pine-root hole,\" replied Molly, \"but we have not  yet seen the pelt of that mink on the end of the barn, and it is not  safe till we do.\"    The hollow hickory was gone--in fact at this very moment its trunk,  lying in the wood-yard, was harboring the mink they feared. So the  Cottontails hopped to the south side of the pond and, choosing a  brush-pile, they crept under and snuggled down for the night, facing  the wind but with their noses in different directions so as to go out  different ways in case of alarm. The wind blew harder and colder as the  hours went by, and about midnight a fine icy snow came ticking down on  the dead leaves and hissing through the brush-heap. It might seem a poor  night for hunting, but that old fox from Springfield was out. He came  pointing up the wind in the shelter of the Swamp and chanced in the lee  of the brush-pile, where he scented the sleeping Cotton-tails. He halted  for a moment, then came stealthily sneaking up toward the brush under  which his nose told him the rabbits were crouching. The noise of the  wind and the sleet enabled him to come quite close before Molly  heard the faint crunch of a dry leaf under his paw. She touched Rag's  whiskers, and both were fully awake just as the fox sprang on them; but  they always slept with their legs ready for a jump. Molly darted out  into the blinding storm. The fox missed his spring but followed like a  racer, while Rag dashed off to one side.    There was only one road for Molly; that was straight up the wind, and  bounding for her life she gained a little over the unfrozen mud that  would not carry the fox, till she reached the margin of the pond. No  chance to turn now, on she must go.    Splash! splash! through the weeds she went, then plunge into the deep  water.    And plunge went the fox close behind. But it was too much for Reynard  on such a night. He turned back, and Molly, seeing only one course,  struggled through the reeds into the deep water and struck out for the  other shore. But there was a strong headwind. The little waves, icy  cold, broke over her head as she swam, and the water was full of snow  that blocked her way like soft ice, or floating mud. The dark line of  the other shore seemed far, far away, with perhaps the fox waiting for  her there.    But she laid her ears flat to be out of the gale, and bravely put forth  all her strength with wind and tide against her. After a long, weary  swim in the cold water, she had nearly reached the farther reeds when a  great mass of floating snow barred her road; then the wind on the bank  made strange, fox-like sounds that robbed her of all force, and she was  drifted far backward before she could get free from the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30310"],[0,"Special Report on Diseases of Cattle (#10)"],[1,"other remedies are of no service in  such cases, and bleeding also fails to produce any benefit. Indeed, it is  usually true that in such cases treatment is useless. Some cases are  recorded in which an incision has been made in the flank, so as to enable  the operator to restore the intestine to its normal position or to remove  the kink.      CONSTIPATION.    Constipation is to be regarded rather as a symptom of disease or of faults  in feeding than as a disease in itself. It occurs in almost all general  fevers unless the bowels are involved in local disease, in obstructions of  all kinds, from feeding on dry, bulky feed, etc. In order to remove the  constipation the treatment must be applied to remove the causes which give  rise to it. Calves sometimes suffer from constipation immediately after  birth when the meconium that accumulates in the bowels before birth is not  passed. In such cases, give a rectal injection of warm water and an ounce  of castor oil shaken up with an ounce of new milk. The mother's milk is the  best food to prevent constipation in the new-born calf, as it contains a  large amount of fatty matter which renders it laxative in its effects.    It is usually better to treat habitual constipation by a change of diet  than by medicine. Flaxseed is a good feed laxative. If the constipation has  lasted long, repeated small doses of purgatives are better than a single  large dose.      INTESTINAL WORMS.    [See chapter on \"The animal parasites of cattle,\" p. 502.]      RUPTURES (VENTRAL HERNIA).    Ventral hernia, or rupture, is an escape of some one of the abdominal  organs through a rupture in the abdominal muscles, the skin remaining  intact. The rumen, the small intestine, or part of the large intestine, and  the fourth stomach are the parts which usually form a ventral hernia in  bovine animals.    _Causes._--Hernia is frequently produced by blows of the horns, kicks, and  falls. In old cows hernia may sometimes occur without any direct injury.    HERNIA OF THE RUMEN.--Hernia of the rumen is generally situated on the left  side of the abdomen, on account of the situation of the rumen. In  exceptional cases it may take place on the right side, and in such cases it  also generally happens that some folds of the intestine pass into the  hernial sac. Hernias have been classified into simple or complicated,  recent or old, traumatic (from mechanical injury) or spontaneous.    In recent traumatic hernia there is swelling on the left side of the lower  part of the abdomen. The swelling is greatest in the cases of hernia which  are situated on the lower part of the abdomen. Unless an examination is  made immediately after the injury has been inflicted it is difficult, and  sometimes impossible, to ascertain the exact extent of the rupture, owing  to the swelling which subsequently takes place. Frequently there is no loss  of appetite, fever, or other general symptoms attending the injury. From  the twelfth to the fifteenth day the swelling has generally subsided to  such an extent that it is possible by an examination to determine the  extent of the rupture.    In old cows what is termed spontaneous hernia may sometimes take place  without any direct injury. The occurrence of this form of hernia is  explained by the increase in the size of the abdomen, which takes place in  an advanced stage of pregnancy, causing a thinning and stretching of the  muscular fibers, which at last may rupture, or give way. Such hernias  frequently occur about the end of the period of gestation, and in some  instances have contained the right sac of the rumen, the omentum, the small  and large intestines, a portion of the liver, and the pregnant uterus.    In old hernias the swelling is soft and elastic, and if they have not  contracted adhesions to the sides of the laceration, they can be made to  disappear by pressure carefully applied. Sometimes this accident is  complicated by a rupture of the rumen, constituting a complicated hernia.  If a portion of the contents of the rumen escape into the abdomen, the case  will be aggravated by the occurrence of peritonitis.    HERNIA OF THE BOWEL.--When the intestines (Pl. III, fig. 6) form the  contents of the hernia, it will be situated at the right side of the  abdomen. In an intestinal hernia the swelling is usually not painful, of a  doughy consistence or elastic, according as the intestine does or does not  contain alimentary matter. This swelling can generally be made to disappear  by pressure, and when it has been reduced one can easily recognize the  direction and extent of the hernial opening. Hernias of the bowel which are  situated at the upper and right side of the abdomen are usually formed by  the small intestine. They are less easily reduced than a hernia in a lower  situation, but when reduction has been effected they are less readily  reproduced than those occurring lower. In hernias of the small intestine,  adhesion of the protruding parts to the walls of the opening, or  strangulation, are complications which sometimes take place. If adhesion  has taken place the hernia can not be reduced by pressure, and when  strangulation has occurred the animal shows symptoms of pain--is restless,  turns its nose to the painful part, and shows those symptoms which are  usually collectively designated under the term colic. If relief is not  afforded, the animal will die.    HERNIA OF THE RENNET, OR FOURTH STOMACH.--This disease occasionally occurs  in calves and is usually caused by a blow from a cow's horn on the right  flank of the calf. After such an accident a swelling forms on the right  flank near the last rib. This swelling may be neither hot nor painful, even  at first, and is soft to the touch. It can be made to disappear by careful  pressure, when the sides of the aperture through which it has passed can be  felt. The application of pressure so as to cause the disappearance of the  hernia is best made immediately after the occurrence of the accident, or  when the edema which accompanies the swelling has disappeared.    _Treatment._--When a hernia is reducible--that is, can be pushed back into  the abdomen--then, if it is of recent occurrence, it is advisable to  maintain the natural position of the parts by bandaging and to allow the  walls of the laceration to grow together. The bowels should be kept  reasonably empty by avoiding the use of bulky feed, and the animal must be  kept quiet.    The following method of bandaging is recommended by Bouley:    First prepare a bandage (must be of strong material), about 10 yards long  and between 3 and 4 inches broad, and a flexible and solid piece of  pasteboard adapted in size to the surface of the hernia. The protruding  organ must then be replaced in the abdomen and maintained in that position  during the application of the bandage. This being done, a layer of melted  pitch and turpentine is quickly spread on the skin covering the seat of the  hernia, so as to extend somewhat beyond that space. This adhesive layer is  then covered with a layer of fine tow, then a new layer of pitch and  turpentine is spread on the tow, and the piece of pasteboard is applied on  the layer of pitch, its outer surface being covered with the same  preparation. Lastly, the bandage, adhering to the piece of pasteboard, to  the skin, and to the different turns which it makes around the body, is  carefully applied so as to form an immovable, rigid, and solid bandage,  which will retain the hernia long enough for the wound in the abdominal  walls to heal permanently.    If the hernia is old and small it may be treated by injecting a strong  solution of common salt about the edges of the tear. This causes swelling  and inflammation, which, respectively, forces the protruded organ back and  closes the opening. There is some risk attached to this method of  treatment.    In small, old, ventral hernias the method of compressing and sloughing off  the skin has been used successfully. If the hernia is large a radical  operation will be necessary, and this is also true when the symptoms  indicate that a hernia is strangulated. This operation is performed by  cutting down on the hernia, restoring the organ to the abdominal cavity,  and then closing the wound with two sets of stitches; the inner stitches,  in the muscular wall, should be made with catgut and the outer stitches, in  the skin, may be made with silk or silver wire. The strictest surgical  cleanliness must be observed. Bleeding vessels should be tied. Then a  compress composed of ten or twelve folds of cloth must be placed smoothly  over the seat of injury and a bandage applied around the body, the two ends  being fastened at the back. In the smaller kinds of hernia, nitric acid may  sometimes be applied with success. This treatment should not be applied  until the swelling and inflammation attending the appearance of the hernia  have subsided; then, the contents of the hernia having been returned, the  surface of skin corresponding to it is sponged over with a solution  composed of 1 part of nitric acid to 2 of water. This treatment acts by  exciting considerable inflammation, which has the effect of causing  swelling, and thus frequently closing the hernial opening and preventing  the contents of the sac from returning. A second application should not be  made until the inflammation excited by the first has subsided. In what is  termed spontaneous hernia it is useless to apply any kind of treatment.    UMBILICAL HERNIA.--The umbilicus, or navel, is the aperture through which  the blood vessels pass from the mother to the fetus, and naturally the  sides of this aperture ought to adhere or unite after birth. In very young  animals, and sometimes in newborn calves, this aperture in the abdominal  muscles remains open and a part of the bowel or a portion of the mesentery  may slip through the opening, constituting what is called umbilical hernia.  The wall of the sac is formed by"]]]
