Hardly has it disappeared in the conflagration of its last  rays, with which the West is flushed, when the blue orb reappears on the  opposite side, shedding a pale azure light upon the world it  illuminates, which knows no night. And thus these two suns fraternize in  the Heavens over the common task of renewing a thousand effects of  extra-terrestrial light for the globes that are subject to their  variations.    Scarlet, indigo, green, and golden suns; pearly and multi-colored Moons;  are these not fairy visions, dazzling to our poor sight, condemned while  here below to see and know but one white Sun?    As we have learned, there are not only double, but triple, and also  multiple stars. One of the finest ternary systems is that of [gamma] in  Andromeda, above mentioned. Its large star is orange, its second green,  its third blue, but the two last are in close juxtaposition, and a  powerful telescope is needed to separate them. A triple star more easy  to observe is [zeta] of Cancer, composed of three orbs of fifth  magnitude, at a distance of 1\" and 5\"; the first two revolve round their  common center of gravity in fifty-nine years, the third takes over three  hundred years. The preceding figure shows this system in a fairly  powerful objective (Fig. 18).    [Illustration: FIG. 18.--Triple star [zeta] in Cancer.]    In the Lyre, a little above the dazzling Vega, [epsilon] is of fourth  magnitude, which seems a little elongated to the unaided eye, and can  even be analyzed into two contiguous stars by very sharp sight. But on  examining this attractive pair with a small glass, it is further obvious  that each of these stars is double; so that they form a splendid  quadruple system of two couples (Fig. 19): one of fifth and a half and  sixth magnitudes, at a distance of 2.4\", the other of sixth and  seventh, 3.2\" distant. The distance between the two pairs is 207\".    [Illustration: FIG. 19.--Quadruple star [epsilon] of the Lyre.]    In speaking of Orion, we referred to the marvelous star [theta] situated  in the no less famous Nebula, below the Belt; this star forms a  dazzling sextuple system, in the very heart of the nebula (Fig. 20). How  different to our Sun, sailing through Space in modest isolation!    Be it noted that all these stars are animated by prodigious motions that  impel them in every direction.    [Illustration: FIG. 20.--Sextuple star [theta] in the Nebula of Orion.]    There are no fixed stars. On every side throughout Infinity, the burning  suns--enormous globes, blazing centers of light and heat--are flying at  giddy speed toward an unknown goal, traversing millions of miles each  day, crossing century by century such vast spaces as are inconceivable  to the human intellect.    If the stars appear motionless to us, it is because they are so remote,  their secular movements being only manifested on the celestial sphere by  imperceptible displacements. But in reality these suns are in perpetual  commotion in the abysses of the Heavens, which they quicken with an  extraordinary animation.    These perpetual and cumulative motions must eventually modify the aspect  of the Constellations: but these changes will only take effect very  slowly; and for thousands and thousands of years longer the heroes and  heroines of mythology will keep their respective places in the Heavens,  and reign undisturbed beneath the starry vault.    Examination of these star motions reveals the fact that our Sun is  plunging with all his system (the Earth included) toward the  Constellation of Hercules. We are changing our position every moment: in  an hour we shall be 70,000 kilometers (43,500 miles) farther than we are  at present. The Sun and the Earth will never again traverse the space  they have just left, and which they have deserted forever.    And here let us pause for an instant to consider the _variable stars_.  Our Sun, which is constant and uniform in its light, does not set the  type of all the stars. A great number of them are variable--either  periodically, in regular cycles--or irregularly.    We are already acquainted with the variations of Algol, in Perseus, due  to its partial eclipse by a dark globe gravitating in the line of our  vision. There are several others of the same type: these are not,  properly speaking, variable stars. But there are many others the  intrinsic light of which undergoes actual variations.    In order to realize this, let us imagine that our Earth belongs to such  a sun, for example, to a star in the southern constellation of the  Whale, indicated by the letter [omicron], which has been named the  \"wonderful\" (Mira Ceti). Our new sun is shining to-day with a dazzling  light, shedding the gladness of his joyous beams upon nature and in our  hearts. For two months we admire the superb orb, sparkling in the azure  illuminated with its radiance. Then of a sudden, its light fades, and  diminishes in intensity, though the sky remains clear. Imperceptibly,  our fine sun darkens; the atmosphere becomes sad and dull, there is an  anticipation of universal death. For five long months our world is  plunged in a kind of penumbra; all nature is saddened in the general  woe.    But while we are bewailing the cruelty of our lot, our cherished  luminary revives. The intensity of its light increases slowly. Its  brilliancy augments, and finally, at the end of three months, it has  recovered its former splendors, and showers its bright beams upon our  world, flooding it with joy. But--we must not rejoice too quickly! This  splendid blaze will not endure. The flaming star will pale once more;  fade back to its minimum; and then again revive. Such is the nature of  this capricious sun. It varies in three hundred and thirty-one days, and  from yellow at the maximum, turns red at the minimum. This star, Mira  Ceti, which is one of the most curious of its type, varies from the  second to the ninth magnitudes: we cite it as one example; hundreds of  others might be instanced.    Thus the sky is no black curtain dotted with brilliant points, no empty  desert, silent and monotonous. It is a prodigious theater on which the  most fantastic plays are continually being acted. Only--there are no  spectators.    Again, we must note the _temporary stars_, which shine for a certain  time, and then die out rapidly. Such was the star in Cassiopeia, in  1572, the light of which exceeded Sirius in its visibility in full  daylight, burning for five months with unparalleled splendor, dominating  all other stars of first magnitude; after which it died out gradually,  disappearing at the end of seventeen months, to the terror of the  peoples, who saw in it the harbinger of the world's end: that of 1604,  in the Constellation of the Serpent, which shone for a year; of 1866, of  second magnitude, in the Northern Crown, which appeared for a few weeks  only; of 1876, in the Swan; of 1885, in the Nebula of Andromeda; of  1891, in the Charioteer; and quite recently, of 1901, in Perseus.    These temporary stars, which appear spontaneously to the observers on  the Earth, and quickly vanish again, are doubtless due to collisions,  conflagrations, or celestial cataclysms. But we only see them long after  the epoch at which the phenomena occurred, years upon years, and  centuries ago. For instance, the conflagration photographed by the  author in 1901, in Perseus, must have occurred in the time of Queen  Elizabeth. It has taken all this time for the rays of light to reach us.           *       *       *       *       *    The Heavens are full of surprises, on which we can bestow but a fleeting  glance within these limits. They present a field of infinite variety.    Who has not noticed the Milky Way, the pale belt that traverses the  entire firmament and is so luminous on clear evenings in the  Constellations of the Swan and the Lyre? It is indeed a swarm of stars.  Each is individually too small to excite our retina, but as a whole,  curiously enough, they are perfectly visible. With opera-glasses we  divine the starry constitution: a small telescope shows us marvels.  Eighteen millions of stars were counted there with the gauges of William  Herschel.    Now this Milky Way is a symbol, not of the Universe, but of the  Universes that succeed each other through the vast spaces to Infinity.    Our Sun is a star of the Milky Way. It surrounds us like a great circle,  and if the Earth were transparent, we should see it pass beneath our  feet as well as over our heads. It consists of a very considerable mass  of star-clusters, varying greatly in extent and number, some projected  in front of others, while the whole forms an agglomeration.    [Illustration: FIG. 21.--The Star-Cluster in Hercules.]    Among this mass of star-groups, several thousands of which are already  known to us, we will select one of the most curious, the Cluster in  Hercules, which can be distinguished with the unaided eye, between the  stars [eta] and [zeta] of that constellation. Many photographs of it  have been taken in the author's observatory at Juvisy, showing some  thousands of stars; and one of these is reproduced in the accompanying  figure (Fig. 21). Is it not a veritable universe?    [Illustration: FIG. 22.--The Star-Cluster in the Centaur.]    Another of the most beautiful, on account of its regularity, is that of  the Centaur (Fig. 22).    These groups often assume the most extraordinary shapes in the  telescope, such as crowns, fishes, crabs, open mouths, birds with  outspread wings, etc.    We must also note the _gaseous nebulae_, universes in the making,  _e.g._, the famous Nebula in Orion, of which we obtained some notion a  while ago in connection with its sextuple star: and also that in  Andromeda (Fig. 23).    [Illustration: FIG. 23.--The Nebula in Andromeda.]    [Illustration: FIG. 24.--Nebula in the Greyhounds.]    Perhaps the most marvelous of all is that of the Greyhounds, which  evolves in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2527"],[0,"The Sorrows of Young Werther (#10)"],[1,"the same anecdote in the same monotonous tone, which never changes. I  find by this, how much an author injures his works by altering them,  even though they be improved in a poetical point of view. The first  impression is readily received. We are so constituted that we believe  the most incredible things; and, once they are engraved upon the memory,  woe to him who would endeavour to efface them.    AUGUST 18.    Must it ever be thus,--that the source of our happiness must also be the  fountain of our misery? The full and ardent sentiment which animated  my heart with the love of nature, overwhelming me with a torrent of  delight, and which brought all paradise before me, has now become an  insupportable torment, a demon which perpetually pursues and harasses  me. When in bygone days I gazed from these rocks upon yonder mountains  across the river, and upon the green, flowery valley before me, and saw  all nature budding and bursting around; the hills clothed from foot  to peak with tall, thick forest trees; the valleys in all their varied  windings, shaded with the loveliest woods; and the soft river gliding  along amongst the lisping reeds, mirroring the beautiful clouds which  the soft evening breeze wafted across the sky,--when I heard the groves  about me melodious with the music of birds, and saw the million swarms  of insects dancing in the last golden beams of the sun, whose setting  rays awoke the humming beetles from their grassy beds, whilst the  subdued tumult around directed my attention to the ground, and I there  observed the arid rock compelled to yield nutriment to the dry moss,  whilst the heath flourished upon the barren sands below me, all this  displayed to me the inner warmth which animates all nature, and filled  and glowed within my heart. I felt myself exalted by this overflowing  fulness to the perception of the Godhead, and the glorious forms of  an infinite universe became visible to my soul! Stupendous mountains  encompassed me, abysses yawned at my feet, and cataracts fell headlong  down before me; impetuous rivers rolled through the plain, and rocks  and mountains resounded from afar. In the depths of the earth I saw  innumerable powers in motion, and multiplying to infinity; whilst  upon its surface, and beneath the heavens, there teemed ten thousand  varieties of living creatures. Everything around is alive with an  infinite number of forms; while mankind fly for security to their petty  houses, from the shelter of which they rule in their imaginations over  the wide-extended universe. Poor fool! in whose petty estimation all  things are little. From the inaccessible mountains, across the desert  which no mortal foot has trod, far as the confines of the unknown ocean,  breathes the spirit of the eternal Creator; and every atom to which he  has given existence finds favour in his sight. Ah, how often at that  time has the flight of a bird, soaring above my head, inspired me  with the desire of being transported to the shores of the immeasurable  waters, there to quaff the pleasures of life from the foaming goblet  of the Infinite, and to partake, if but for a moment even, with  the confined powers of my soul, the beatitude of that Creator who  accomplishes all things in himself, and through himself!    My dear friend, the bare recollection of those hours still consoles me.  Even this effort to recall those ineffable sensations, and give them  utterance, exalts my soul above itself, and makes me doubly feel the  intensity of my present anguish.    It is as if a curtain had been drawn from before my eyes, and, instead  of prospects of eternal life, the abyss of an ever open grave yawned  before me. Can we say of anything that it exists when all passes away,  when time, with the speed of a storm, carries all things onward,--and  our transitory existence, hurried along by the torrent, is either  swallowed up by the waves or dashed against the rocks? There is not a  moment but preys upon you,--and upon all around you, not a moment in  which you do not yourself become a destroyer. The most innocent walk  deprives of life thousands of poor insects: one step destroys the fabric  of the industrious ant, and converts a little world into chaos. No:  it is not the great and rare calamities of the world, the floods which  sweep away whole villages, the earthquakes which swallow up our towns,  that affect me. My heart is wasted by the thought of that destructive  power which lies concealed in every part of universal nature. Nature has  formed nothing that does not consume itself, and every object near  it: so that, surrounded by earth and air, and all the active powers, I  wander on my way with aching heart; and the universe is to me a fearful  monster, for ever devouring its own offspring.    AUGUST 21.    In vain do I stretch out my arms toward her when I awaken in the morning  from my weary slumbers. In vain do I seek for her at night in my bed,  when some innocent dream has happily deceived me, and placed her near me  in the fields, when I have seized her hand and covered it with countless  kisses. And when I feel for her in the half confusion of sleep, with the  happy sense that she is near, tears flow from my oppressed heart; and,  bereft of all comfort, I weep over my future woes.    AUGUST 22.    What a misfortune, Wilhelm! My active spirits have degenerated into  contented indolence. I cannot be idle, and yet I am unable to set to  work. I cannot think: I have no longer any feeling for the beauties of  nature, and books are distasteful to me. Once we give ourselves up, we  are totally lost. Many a time and oft I wish I were a common labourer;  that, awakening in the morning, I might have but one prospect, one  pursuit, one hope, for the day which has dawned. I often envy Albert  when I see him buried in a heap of papers and parchments, and I fancy I  should be happy were I in his place. Often impressed with this feeling  I have been on the point of writing to you and to the minister, for the  appointment at the embassy, which you think I might obtain. I believe I  might procure it. The minister has long shown a regard for me, and has  frequently urged me to seek employment. It is the business of an  hour only. Now and then the fable of the horse recurs to me. Weary of  liberty, he suffered himself to be saddled and bridled, and was ridden  to death for his pains. I know not what to determine upon. For is not  this anxiety for change the consequence of that restless spirit which  would pursue me equally in every situation of life?    AUGUST 28.    If my ills would admit of any cure, they would certainly be cured here.  This is my birthday, and early in the morning I received a packet from  Albert. Upon opening it, I found one of the pink ribbons which Charlotte  wore in her dress the first time I saw her, and which I had several  times asked her to give me. With it were two volumes in duodecimo  of Wetstein's \"Homer,\" a book I had often wished for, to save me the  inconvenience of carrying the large Ernestine edition with me upon my  walks. You see how they anticipate my wishes, how well they understand  all those little attentions of friendship, so superior to the costly  presents of the great, which are humiliating. I kissed the ribbon a  thousand times, and in every breath inhaled the remembrance of those  happy and irrevocable days which filled me with the keenest joy. Such,  Wilhelm, is our fate. I do not murmur at it: the flowers of life are but  visionary. How many pass away, and leave no trace behind--how few yield  any fruit--and the fruit itself, how rarely does it ripen! And yet there  are flowers enough! and is it not strange, my friend, that we should  suffer the little that does really ripen, to rot, decay, and perish  unenjoyed? Farewell! This is a glorious summer. I often climb into the  trees in Charlotte's orchard, and shake down the pears that hang on the  highest branches. She stands below, and catches them as they fall.    AUGUST 30.    Unhappy being that I am! Why do I thus deceive myself? What is to come  of all this wild, aimless, endless passion? I cannot pray except to her.  My imagination sees nothing but her: all surrounding objects are of no  account, except as they relate to her. In this dreamy state I enjoy many  happy hours, till at length I feel compelled to tear myself away from  her. Ah, Wilhelm, to what does not my heart often compel me! When I have  spent several hours in her company, till I feel completely absorbed by  her figure, her grace, the divine expression of her thoughts, my mind  becomes gradually excited to the highest excess, my sight grows dim,  my hearing confused, my breathing oppressed as if by the hand of a  murderer, and my beating heart seeks to obtain relief for my aching  senses. I am sometimes unconscious whether I really exist. If in such  moments I find no sympathy, and Charlotte does not allow me to enjoy  the melancholy consolation of bathing her hand with my tears, I feel  compelled to tear myself from her, when I either wander through the  country, climb some precipitous cliff, or force a path through the  trackless thicket, where I am lacerated and torn by thorns and briers;  and thence I find relief. Sometimes I lie stretched on the ground,  overcome with fatigue and dying with thirst; sometimes, late in the  night, when the moon shines above me, I recline against an aged tree  in some sequestered forest, to rest my weary limbs, when, exhausted  and worn, I sleep till break of day. O Wilhelm! the hermit's cell, his  sackcloth, and girdle of thorns would be luxury and indulgence compared  with what I suffer. Adieu! I see no end to this wretchedness except the  grave.    SEPTEMBER 3.    I must away. Thank you, Wilhelm, for determining my wavering purpose.  For a whole fortnight I have thought of leaving her. I must away.  She has returned to town, and is at the house of a friend. And then,  Albert--yes, I"]]]
