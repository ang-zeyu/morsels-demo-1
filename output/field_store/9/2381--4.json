Some hundred paces from it  lies the manor-house Ny Soe, where Thorwaldsen generally sojourned  during his stay in Denmark, and where he called many of his immortal  works into existence.    ------    But little Tuk was no longer lying down: all at once he was on  horseback. On he went at full gallop, still galloping on and on. A  knight with a gleaming plume, and most magnificently dressed, held him  before him on the horse, and thus they rode through the wood to the  old town of Bordingborg, and that was a large and very lively town.  High towers rose from the castle of the king, and the brightness of  many candles streamed from all the windows; within was dance and song,  and King Waldemar and the young, richly-attired maids of honor danced  together. The morn now came; and as soon as the sun appeared, the  whole town and the king's palace crumbled together, and one tower  after the other; and at last only a single one remained standing where  the castle had been before,* and the town was so small and poor, and  the school boys came along with their books under their arms, and  said, \"2000 inhabitants!\" but that was not true, for there were not so  many.    ------    * Bordingborg, in the reign of King Waldemar a considerable place, now  an unimportant little town. One solitary tower only, and some remains  of a wall, show where the castle once stood.    ------    And little Tukey lay in his bed: it seemed to him as if he dreamed,  and yet as if he were not dreaming; however, somebody was close beside  him.    \"Little Tukey! little Tukey!\" cried some one near. It was a seaman,  quite a little personage, so little as if he were a midshipman; but a  midshipman it was not.    \"Many remembrances from Corsor.* That is a town that is just rising  into importance; a lively town that has steam-boats and stagecoaches:  formerly people called it ugly, but that is no longer true. I lie on  the sea,\" said Corsor; \"I have high roads and gardens, and I have  given birth to a poet who was witty and amusing, which all poets are  not. I once intended to equip a ship that was to sail all round the  earth; but I did not do it, although I could have done so: and then,  too, I smell so deliciously, for close before the gate bloom the most  beautiful roses.\"    ------    * Corsor, on the Great Belt, called, formerly, before the introduction  of steam-vessels, when travellers were often obliged to wait a long  time for a favorable wind, \"the most tiresome of towns.\" The poet  Baggesen was born here.    ------    Little Tuk looked, and all was red and green before his eyes; but as  soon as the confusion of colors was somewhat over, all of a sudden  there appeared a wooded slope close to the bay, and high up above  stood a magnificent old church, with two high pointed towers. From out  the hill-side spouted fountains in thick streams of water, so that  there was a continual splashing; and close beside them sat an old king  with a golden crown upon his white head: that was King Hroar, near the  fountains, close to the town of Roeskilde, as it is now called. And up  the slope into the old church went all the kings and queens of  Denmark, hand in hand, all with their golden crowns; and the organ  played and the fountains rustled. Little Tuk saw all, heard all. \"Do  not forget the diet,\" said King Hroar.[1] Again all suddenly  disappeared. Yes, and whither? It seemed to him just as if one turned  over a leaf in a book. And now stood there an old peasant-woman, who  came from Soroe,[2] where grass grows in the marketplace.    ------    [1] Roeskilde, once the capital of Denmark. The town takes its name  from King Hroar, and the many fountains in the neighborhood. In the  beautiful cathedral the greater number of the kings and queens of  Denmark are interred. In Roeskilde, too, the members of the Danish  Diet assemble.    [2] Soroe, a very quiet little town, beautifully situated, surrounded  by woods and lakes. Holberg, Denmark's Moliere, founded here an  academy for the sons of the nobles. The poets Hauch and Ingemann were  appointed professors here. The latter lives there still.    ------    She had an old grey linen apron hanging over her head and back: it was  so wet, it certainly must have been raining \"Yes, that it has,\" said  she; and she now related many pretty things out of Holberg's comedies,  and about Waldemar and Absalon; but all at once she cowered together,  and her head began shaking backwards and forwards, and she looked as  she were going to make a spring. \"Croak! croak!\" said she: \"it is wet,  it is wet; there is such a pleasant death-like stillness in Soroe!\"  She was now suddenly a frog, \"Croak;\" and now she was an old woman.  \"One must dress according to the weather,\" said she. \"It is wet, it is  wet. My town is just like a bottle; and one gets in by the neck, and  by the neck one must get out again! In former times I had the finest  fish, and now I have fresh rosy-cheeked boys at the bottom of the  bottle, who learn wisdom, Hebrew, Greek,--Croak!\" When she spoke it  sounded just like the noise of frogs, or as if one walked with great  boots over a moor; always the same tone, so uniform and so tiring that  little Tuk fell into a good sound sleep, which, by the bye, could not  do him any harm.    But even in this sleep there came a dream, or whatever else it was:  his little sister Augusta, she with the blue eyes and the fair curling  hair, was suddenly a tall, beautiful girl, and without having wings  was yet able to fly; and she now flew over Zealand--over the green  woods and the blue lakes.    \"Do you hear the cock crow, Tukey? cock-a-doodle-doo! The cocks are  flying up from Kjoge! You will have a farm-yard, so large, oh! so very  large! You will suffer neither hunger nor thirst! You will get on in  the world! You will be a rich and happy man! Your house will exalt  itself like King Waldemar's tower, and will be richly decorated with  marble statues, like that at Prastoe. You understand what I mean. Your  name shall circulate with renown all round the earth, like unto the  ship that was to have sailed from Corsor; and in Roeskilde\"----    \"Do not forget the diet!\" said King Hroar.    \"Then you will speak well and wisely, little Tukey; and when at last  you sink into your grave, you shall sleep as quietly\"----    \"As if I lay in Soroe,\" said Tuk, awaking. It was bright day, and he  was now quite unable to call to mind his dream; that, however, was not  at all necessary, for one may not know what the future will bring.    And out of bed he jumped, and read in his book, and now all at once he  knew his whole lesson. And the old washerwoman popped her head in at  the door, nodded to him friendly, and said, \"Thanks, many thanks, my  good child, for your help! May the good ever-loving God fulfil your  loveliest dream!\"    Little Tukey did not at all know what he had dreamed, but the loving  God knew it.      ------------        THE NAUGHTY BOY.    A long time ago there lived an old poet, a thoroughly kind old poet.  As he was sitting one evening in his room, a dreadful storm arose  without, and the rain streamed down from heaven; but the old poet sat  warm and comfortable in his chimney-corner, where the fire blazed and  the roasting apple hissed.    \"Those who have not a roof over their heads will be wetted to the  skin,\" said the good old poet.    \"Oh let me in! let me in! I am cold, and I'm so wet!\" exclaimed  suddenly a child that stood crying at the door and knocking for  admittance, while the rain poured down, and the wind made all the  windows rattle.    \"Poor thing!\" said the old poet, as he went to open the door. There  stood a little boy, quite naked, and the water ran down from his long  golden hair; he trembled with cold, and had he not come into a warm  room he would most certainly have perished in the frightful tempest.    \"Poor child!\" said the old poet, as he took the boy by the hand. \"Come  in, come in, and I will soon restore thee! Thou shalt have wine and  roasted apples, for thou art verily a charming child!\" And the boy was  so really. His eyes were like two bright stars; and although the water  trickled down his hair, it waved in beautiful curls. He looked exactly  like a little angel, but he was so pale, and his whole body trembled  with cold. He had a nice little bow in his hand, but it was quite  spoiled by the rain, and the tints of his many-colored arrows ran one  into the other.    The old poet seated himself beside his hearth, and took the little  fellow on his lap; he squeezed the water out of his dripping hair,  warmed his hands between his own, and boiled for him some sweet wine.  Then the boy recovered, his cheeks again grew rosy, he jumped down  from the lap where he was sitting, and danced round the kind old poet.    \"You are a merry fellow,\" said the old man; \"what's your name?\"    \"My name is Cupid,\" answered the boy. \"Don't you know me? There lies  my bow; it shoots well, I can assure you! Look, the weather is now  clearing up, and the moon is shining clear again through the window.\"    \"Why, your bow is quite spoiled,\" said the old poet.    \"That were sad indeed,\" said the boy, and he took the bow in his hand  and examined it on every side. \"Oh, it is dry again, and is not hurt  at all; the string is quite tight. I will try it directly.\" And he  bent his bow, took aim, and shot an arrow at the old poet, right into  his heart. \"You see now that my bow was not spoiled,\" said he,  laughing; and away he ran.    The naughty boy! to shoot the old poet in that way; he who had taken  him into his warm room, who had treated him so kindly, and who had  given him warm wine and the very best apples!    The poor poet lay on the earth and wept, for the arrow had really  flown into his heart.    \"Fie!\" said he, \"how naughty a boy Cupid is! I will tell all children  about him, that they may take care and not play with him, for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31111"],[0,"Across Asia on a Bicycle (#10)"],[1,"was made to our intended ascent of  Ak-Dagh, the mysterious abode of the jinn. Before turning in for the  night, we reconnoitered our situation. The lights in all the tents, save  our own, were now extinguished. Not a sound was heard, except the heavy  breathing of some of the slumbering animals about us, or the bark of a dog  at some distant encampment. The huge dome of Ararat, though six to eight  miles farther up the slope, seemed to be towering over us like some giant  monster of another world. We could not see the summit, so far was it above  the enveloping clouds. We returned to the tent to find that the zaptiehs  had been given the best places and best covers to sleep in, and that we  were expected to accommodate ourselves near the door, wrapped up in an old  Kurdish carpet. Policy was evidently a better developed trait of Kurdish  character than hospitality.    Although we arose at four, seven o'clock saw us still at the encampment.  Two hours vanished before our gentlemen zaptiehs condescended to rise from  their peaceful slumbers; then a great deal of time was unnecessarily  consumed in eating their special breakfast. We ourselves had to be content  with ekmek and yaourt (blotting-paper bread and curdled milk). This over,  they concluded not to go on without sandals to take the place of their  heavy military boots, as at this point their horses would have to be  discarded. After we had employed a Kurd to make these for them, they  declared they were afraid to proceed without the company of ten Kurds  armed to the teeth. We knew that this was only a scheme on the part of the  Kurds, with whom the zaptiehs were in league, to extort money from us. We  still kept cool, and only casually insinuated that we did not have enough  money to pay for so large a party. This announcement worked like a charm.  The interest the Kurds had up to this time taken in our venture died away  at once. Even the three Kurds who, as requested in the message of the  mutessarif, were to accompany us up the mountain to the snow-line, refused  absolutely to go. The mention of the mutessarif's name awakened only a  sneer. We had also relied upon the Kurds for blankets, as we had been  advised to do by our friends in Bayazid. Those we had already hired they  now snatched from the donkeys standing before the tent. All this time our  tall, gaunt, meek-looking muleteer had stood silent. Now his turn had  come. How far was he to go with his donkeys?--he didn't think it possible  for him to go much beyond this point. Patience now ceased to be a virtue.  We cut off discussion at once; told the muleteer he would either go on, or  lose what he had already earned; and informed the zaptiehs that whatever  they did would be reported to the mutessarif on our return. Under this  rather forcible persuasion, they stood not on the order of their going,  but sullenly followed our little procession out of camp before the  crestfallen Kurds.    In the absence of guides we were thrown upon our own resources. Far from  being an assistance, our zaptiehs proved a nuisance. They would carry  nothing, not even the food they were to eat, and were absolutely ignorant  of the country we were to traverse. From our observations on the previous  days, we had decided to strike out on a northeast course, over the gentle  slope, until we struck the rocky ridges on the southeast buttress of the  dome. On its projecting rocks, which extended nearer to the summit than  those of any other part of the mountain, we could avoid the slippery,  precipitous snow-beds that stretched far down the mountain at this time of  the year.    Immediately after leaving the encampment, the ascent became steeper and  more difficult; the small volcanic stones of yesterday now increased to  huge obstructing boulders, among which the donkeys with difficulty made  their way. They frequently tipped their loads, or got wedged in between  two unyielding walls. In the midst of our efforts to extricate them, we  often wondered how Noah ever managed with the animals from the ark. Had  these donkeys not been of a philosophical turn of mind, they might have  offered forcible objections to the way we extricated them from their  straightened circumstances. A remonstrance on our part for carelessness in  driving brought from the muleteer a burst of Turkish profanity that made  the rocks of Ararat resound with indignant echoes. The spirit of  insubordination seemed to be increasing in direct ratio with the height of  our ascent.    We came now to a comparatively smooth, green slope, which led up to the  highest Kurdish encampment met on the line of our ascent, about 7500 feet.  When in sight of the black tents, the subject of Kurdish guides was again  broached by the zaptiehs, and immediately they sat down to discuss the  question. We ourselves were through with discussion, and fully determined  to have nothing to do with a people who could do absolutely nothing for  us. We stopped at the tents, and asked for milk. \"Yes,\" they said; \"we  have some\": but after waiting for ten minutes, we learned that the milk  was still in the goats' possession, several hundred yards away among the  rocks. It dawned upon us that this was only another trick of the zaptiehs  to get a rest.      [Illustration: OUR GUARDS SIT DOWN TO DISCUSS THE SITUATION.]    We pushed on the next 500 feet of the ascent without much trouble or  controversy, the silence broken only by the muleteer, who took the _raki_  bottle off the donkey's pack, and asked if he could take a drink. As we  had only a limited supply, to be used to dilute the snow-water, we were  obliged to refuse him.    At 8000 feet we struck our first snowdrift, into which the donkeys sank up  to their bodies. It required our united efforts to lift them out, and half  carry them across. Then on we climbed till ten o'clock, to a point about  9000 feet, where we stopped for lunch in a quiet mountain glen, by the  side of a rippling mountain rill. This snow-water we drank with raki. The  view in the mean time had been growing more and more extensive. The plain  before us had lost nearly all its detail and color, and was merged into  one vast whole. Though less picturesque, it was incomparably grander. Now  we could see how, in ages past, the lava had burst out of the lateral  fissures in the mountain, and flowed in huge streams for miles down the  slope, and out on the plain below. These beds of lava were gradually  broken up by the action of the elements, and now presented the appearance  of ridges of broken volcanic rocks of the most varied and fantastic  shapes.    It was here that the muleteer showed evident signs of weakening, which  later on developed into a total collapse. We had come to a broad  snow-field where the donkeys stuck fast and rolled over helpless in the  snow. Even after we had unstrapped their baggage and carried it over on  our shoulders, they could make no headway. The muleteer gave up in  despair, and refused even to help us carry our loads to the top of an  adjoining hill, whither the zaptiehs had proceeded to wait for us. In  consequence, Raffl and we were compelled to carry two donkey-loads of  baggage for half a mile over the snow-beds and boulders, followed by the  sulking muleteer, who had deserted his donkeys, rather than be left alone  himself. On reaching the zaptiehs, we sat down to hold a council on the  situation; but the clouds, which, during the day, had occasionally  obscured the top of the mountain, now began to thicken, and it was not  long before a shower compelled us to beat a hasty retreat to a neighboring  ledge of rocks. The clouds that were rolling between us and the mountain  summit seemed but a token of the storm of circumstances. One thing was  certain, the muleteer could go no farther up the mountain, and yet he was  mortally afraid to return alone to the Kurdish robbers. He sat down, and  began to cry like a child. This predicament of their accomplice furnished  the zaptiehs with a plausible excuse. They now absolutely refused to go  any farther without him. Our interpreter, the Greek, again joined the  majority; he was not going to risk the ascent without the Turkish guards,  and besides, he had now come to the conclusion that we had not sufficient  blankets to spend a night at so high an altitude. Disappointed, but not  discouraged, we gazed at the silent old gentleman at our side. In his  determined countenance we read his answer. Long shall we remember Ignaz  Raffl as one of the pluckiest, most persevering of old men.      [Illustration: HELPING THE DONKEYS OVER A SNOW-FIELD.]    There was now only one plan that could be pursued. Selecting from our  supplies one small blanket, a felt mat, two long, stout ropes, enough food  to last us two days, a bottle of cold tea, and a can of Turkish raki, we  packed them into two bundles to strap on our backs. We then instructed the  rest of the party to return to the Kurdish encampment and await our  return. The sky was again clear at 2:30 P. M., when we bade good-by to our  worthless comrades and resumed the ascent. We were now at a height of nine  thousand feet, and it was our plan to camp at a point far enough up the  mountain to enable us to complete the ascent on the following day, and  return to the Kurdish encampment by nightfall. Beyond us was a region of  snow and barren rocks, among which we still saw a small purple flower and  bunches of lichens, which grew more rare as we advanced. Our course  continued in a northeast direction, toward the main southeast ridge of the  mountain. Sometimes we were floundering with our heavy loads in the deep  snow-beds, or scrambling on hands and knees over the huge boulders of the  rocky seams. Two hours and a half of climbing brought us to the crest of  the main southeast ridge, about one thousand feet below the base of the  precipitous dome. At this point our course changed from northeast to  northwest, and continued so during the "]]]
