[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37512"],[0,"A Revision of Snakes of the Genus Conophis (Family Colubridae, from Middle (#6)"],[1,"have seven supralabials on each side, and  three others have seven on one side, and eight on the other. Never is  more than the lower third of the supralabials dark brown. In many  specimens little or no brown is on the supralabials. There is little  or no brown on the chin.    Variation in coloration and in number of supralabials appears to be of  no geographic significance.    Although no juveniles have been collected, I expect that juveniles  resemble adults in coloration. Probably there would be a greater  contrast between the dark stripes and the pale ground-color in  juveniles.    In life an adult from three miles northwest of Lerdo de Tejada,  Veracruz, Mexico (UMMZ 114484), had black stripes on the 4th and 7th  rows of dorsal scales, and black spots on a brown background on the  1st row. The 2nd row had a medial, pale to medium brown auxiliary  stripe on a brownish-white background. Posterior to the nape the 3rd  row was medium brown. The area between the 4th and 7th rows and the  dorsum between the 7th row of scales on each side was a pale  brownish-white. Posterior to the place of scale-reduction the primary  stripes were displaced downward by one row to the 3rd and 6th rows and  secondary stripes originated as elongated spots on the 4th and 7th  rows. Near the tail the secondary stripes were broad and continuous.  The head was white or tannish-white with three dark brown or black  stripes.    _Remarks._--In his diagnosis of _C. l. lineatus_, Smith (1941:122)  states: \"lateral dark stripe ... very narrow posterior to nape,  extending along fourth scale row; posteriorly a stripe along third and  eighth (farther posteriorly the seventh) scale rows; a narrow dark  stripe along sixth scale row, continuous throughout length of  body....\" I fail to find a dark stripe on the 6th row throughout the  length of the body. In all specimens that I have seen, there is a dark  stripe on the 7th row anteriorly and on the 6th row posteriorly. In  many specimens the stripes on the 3rd and 8th (posteriorly the 7th)  scale-rows are absent or present so far posteriorly that the 8th row  is never involved.    The dark brown on the first scale-row and the presence of a lateral  dark stripe on the 4th row of dorsal scales only, in combination with  the characteristics of the genus, distinguish _C. l. lineatus_ from  all other snakes in Mexico.    _Distribution._--Semi-arid habitats on the coastal plain of Veracruz,  Mexico, from Tecolutla to Lerdo de Tejada and Piedras Negras (fig. 2).    _Specimens examined._--Total of 27, as follows: MEXICO: _no specific  locality_, AMNH 19614-15, 19621-24, 19642-43, NMW 16827. _Veracruz: no  specific locality_, AMNH 19618-20, CAS 73640, NMW 16829; _4 km.

Type locality: \"Yucatan,\" restricted to Chichen Itza,  Yucatan, Mexico by Smith and Taylor (1950:352).    _Diagnosis._--Dark stripes either absent posterior to the nape, or  present as a row of small spots on fourth or seventh scale-row; no  dark stripe on first scale-row; eight supralabials having dark ventral  margins.    _Variation._--Forty-five specimens have 158 to 170 (163.7 +- 1.56)  ventrals. Thirty-eight of these snakes having complete tails have 56  to 74 (66.7 +- 4.77) subcaudals; the number of ventrals plus subcaudals  varies from 222 to 245 (230.6). In 45 specimens the reduction from 19  to 17 dorsal scales takes place between ventrals 89 and 114 (102.5 +-  5.57). Sexual dimorphism is evident in the number of subcaudals; 16  females have 56 to 65 (61.8), and 22 males have 68 to 74 (70.3)  subcaudals. The longest specimen (USNM 46395) is a male from Chichen  Itza, Yucatan, having a body length of 893 mm., a tail length of 274  mm., and a total length of 1167 mm. A juvenile (AMNH 38833) from  Chichen Itza, Yucatan, has a body length of 194 mm., a tail length of  50 mm., and a total length of 244 mm.    The venter is immaculate white or pale yellow and the dorsum of the  body is immaculate pale gray to pale olive. Some specimens have small  dark brown spots on the tips of the scales of the 4th or of the 7th  row, but never on both. Only on the nape are spots present on both the  4th and the 7th rows; these spots are the posterior continuations of  the dark stripes on the head and on many specimens do not reach the  nape. Posterior to the place of scale reduction from 19 to 17 rows by  the fusion of the 3rd and 4th rows of scales, the dark spots (when  present) are on the 3rd or 6th row of scales.    The coloration of juveniles is the same as that of adults. Color in  life is thought not too different from that of preserved specimens,  for notes on the color of living individuals (Neill and Allen,  1961:44) agree with what I have observed on preserved snakes.    _Remarks._--The specimen from \"Peten\" (USNM, no. 4941) is the only  specimen that has a controversial history. As can be seen from the  synonymy of the species, the relationship of this specimen with the  rest of the genus has been interpreted in several ways. Smith  (1941:122-123) stated that the above specimen was catalogued as being  from El Salvador; however, the locality was presumed by him to be El  Peten, Guatemala, due to the presence in the bottle of a piece of  paper inscribed \"_Conophis vittatus_, Peten, J. M. Dow.\" This specimen  is the one mentioned by Cope (1861:300, 1876:76, and 1900:1094-95),  and in the first paper is ascribed to Guatemala. In 1900 this specimen  was named _C. lineaticeps_ by Cope who thought the specimen differed  significantly from _C. concolor_ (Cope, 1867:318-319). This specimen  has the coloration normal for _C. l. concolor_ as far posteriorly as  mid-body; beyond mid-body the dark lines, typical of _C. l. lineatus_  or of _C. l. dunni_, are present. It is likely that this specimen is  an intergrade between _C. l. concolor_ and _C. l. dunni_, the other  subspecies present in Guatemala.    The only specimen not from the Yucatan Peninsula is allegedly from  Patuca, Honduras (USNM 20271). It was obtained in the 1870's. Possibly  more collecting will verify the presence of _C. l. concolor_ in  northern Honduras. This individual may be merely a genetically  aberrant specimen from an area where normal specimens are _C. l.  dunni_. Neill and Allen (1961:44-45) suggested that the specimen from  Patuca implies widely overlapping distributions for _C. l. dunni_ and  _C. concolor_. The occurrence of _C. l. concolor_ in Honduras needs to  be verified before this assumption is made. There can, therefore, at  present be no objection to the view that intergradation between the  subspecies _C. l. dunni_ and _C. l. concolor_ could occur through a  relatively broad area of El Peten and British Honduras.    Neill and Allen (1961:44-45) further suggest that the present range of  _C. l. dunni_ extends \"presumably still farther northward toward the  Mexican state of Veracruz where _C. l. lineatus_ exists.\" Actually the  presence of the subspecies _C. l. dunni_ and _C. l. lineatus_ as  presently disjunct populations implies merely that they were  presumably a continuous population at some time in the past.    The characteristics of the genus in combination with the reduction of  dark coloration posterior to the head distinguish this snake from all  other snakes in Mexico and Central America.    _Distribution._--The Yucatan Peninsula: eastern Campeche, all of  Yucatan, probably in Quintana Roo, and the northern third of British  Honduras. A record for northeastern Honduras is questioned (fig. 2)."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3754"],[0,"The Wonders of Instinct: Chapters in the Psychology of Insects (#6)"],[1,"of the future mothers are  thread-like; those of the future males are distended into a spindle at  the lower half, forming a case or sheath whence graceful plumes will  spring at a later date.    Behold the creature, worthy of a Callot's fantastic pencil. (Jacques  Callot (1592-1635), the French engraver and painter, famed for the  grotesque nature of his subjects.--Translator's Note.) If you come  across it in the bramble-bushes, it sways upon its four stilts, it wags  its head, it looks at you with a knowing air, it twists its mitre round  and peers over its shoulder. You seem to read mischief in its pointed  face. You try to take hold of it. The imposing attitude ceases  forthwith, the raised corselet is lowered and the creature makes off  with mighty strides, helping itself along with its fighting-limbs,  which clutch the twigs. The flight need not last long, if you have a  practised eye. The Empusa is captured, put into a screw of paper, which  will save her frail limbs from sprains, and lastly penned in a  wire-gauze cage. In this way, in October, I obtain a flock sufficient  for my purpose.    How to feed them? My Devilkins are very little; they are a month or two  old at most. I give them Locusts suited to their size, the smallest  that I can find. They refuse them. Nay more, they are frightened of  them. Should a thoughtless Locust meekly approach one of the Empusae,  suspended by her four hind-legs to the trellised dome, the intruder  meets with a bad reception. The pointed mitre is lowered; and an angry  thrust sends him rolling. We have it: the wizard's cap is a defensive  weapon, a protective crest. The Ram charges with his forehead, the  Empusa butts with her mitre.    But this does not mean dinner. I serve up the House-fly, alive. She is  accepted, without hesitation. The moment that the Fly comes within  reach, the watchful Devilkin turns her head, bends the stalk of her  corselet slantwise and, flinging out her fore-limb, harpoons the Fly  and grips her between her two saws. No Cat pouncing upon a Mouse could  be quicker.    The game, however small, is enough for a meal. It is enough for the  whole day, often for several days. This is my first surprise: the  extreme abstemiousness of these fiercely-armed insects. I was prepared  for ogres: I find ascetics satisfied with a meagre collation at rare  intervals. A Fly fills their belly for twenty-four hours at least.    Thus passes the late autumn: the Empusae, more and more temperate from  day to day, hang motionless from the wire gauze. Their natural  abstinence is my best ally, for Flies grow scarce; and a time comes  when I should be hard put to it to keep the menageries supplied with  provisions.    During the three winter months, nothing stirs. From time to time, on  fine days, I expose the cage to the sun's rays, in the window. Under  the influence of this heat-bath, the captives stretch their legs a  little, sway from side to side, make up their minds to move about, but  without displaying any awakening appetite. The rare Midges that fall to  my assiduous efforts do not appear to tempt them. It is a rule for them  to spend the cold season in a state of complete abstinence.    My cages tell me what must happen outside, during the winter. Ensconced  in the crannies of the rockwork, in the sunniest places, the young  Empusae wait, in a state of torpor, for the return of the hot weather.  Notwithstanding the shelter of a heap of stones, there must be painful  moments when the frost is prolonged and the snow penetrates little by  little into the best-protected crevices. No matter: hardier than they  look, the refugees escape the dangers of the winter season. Sometimes,  when the sun is strong, they venture out of their hiding-place and come  to see if spring be nigh.    Spring comes. We are in March. My prisoners bestir themselves, change  their skin. They need victuals. My catering difficulties recommence.  The House-fly, so easy to catch, is lacking in these days. I fall back  upon earlier Diptera: Eristales, or Drone-flies. The Empusa refuses  them. They are too big for her and can offer too strenuous a  resistance. She wards off their approach with blows of her mitre.    A few tender morsels, in the shape of very young Grasshoppers, are  readily accepted. Unfortunately, such windfalls do not often find their  way into my sweeping-net. Abstinence becomes obligatory until the  arrival of the first Butterflies. Henceforth, Pieris brassicae, the  White Cabbage Butterfly, will contribute the greater portion of the  victuals.    Let loose in the wire cage, the Pieris is regarded as excellent game.  The Empusa lies in wait for her, seizes her, but releases her at once,  lacking the strength to overpower her. The Butterfly's great wings,  beating the air, give her shock after shock and compel her to let go. I  come to the weakling's assistance and cut the wings of her prey with my  scissors. The maimed ones, still full of life, clamber up the  trellis-work and are forthwith grabbed by the Empusae, who, in no way  frightened by their protests, crunch them up. The dish is to their  taste and, moreover, plentiful, so much so that there are always some  despised remnants.    The head only and the upper portion of the breast are devoured: the  rest--the plump abdomen, the best part of the thorax, the legs and  lastly, of course, the wing-stumps--is flung aside untouched. Does this  mean that the tenderest and most succulent morsels are chosen? No, for  the belly is certainly more juicy; and the Empusa refuses it, though  she eats up her House-fly to the last particle. It is a strategy of  war. I am again in the presence of a neck-specialist as expert as the  Mantis herself in the art of swiftly slaying a victim that struggles  and, in struggling, spoils the meal.    Once warned, I soon perceive that the game, be it Fly, Locust,  Grasshopper, or Butterfly, is always struck in the neck, from behind.  The first bite is aimed at the point containing the cervical ganglia  and produces sudden death or immobility. Complete inertia will leave  the consumer in peace, the essential condition of every satisfactory  repast.    The Devilkin, therefore, frail though she be, possesses the secret of  immediately destroying the resistance of her prey. She bites at the  back of the neck first, in order to give the finishing stroke. She goes  on nibbling around the original attacking-point. In this way the  Butterfly's head and the upper part of the breast are disposed of. But,  by that time, the huntress is surfeited: she wants so little! The rest  lies on the ground, disdained, not for lack of flavour, but because  there is too much of it. A Cabbage Butterfly far exceeds the capacity  of the Empusa's stomach. The Ants will benefit by what is left.    There is one other matter to be mentioned, before observing the  metamorphosis. The position adopted by the young Empusae in the  wire-gauze cage is invariably the same from start to finish. Gripping  the trellis-work by the claws of its four hind-legs, the insect  occupies the top of the dome and hangs motionless, back downwards, with  the whole of its body supported by the four suspension-points. If it  wishes to move, the front harpoons open, stretch out, grasp a mesh and  draw it to them. When the short walk is over, the lethal arms are  brought back against the chest. One may say that it is nearly always  the four hind-shanks which alone support the suspended insect.    And this reversed position, which seems to us so trying, lasts for no  short while: it is prolonged, in my cages, for ten months without a  break. The Fly on the ceiling, it is true, occupies the same attitude;  but she has her moments of rest: she flies, she walks in a normal  posture, she spreads herself flat in the sun. Besides, her acrobatic  feats do not cover a long period. The Empusa, on the other hand,  maintains her curious equilibrium for ten months on end, without a  break. Hanging from the trellis-work, back downwards, she hunts, eats,  digests, dozes, casts her skin, undergoes her transformation, mates,  lays her eggs and dies. She clambered up there when she was still quite  young; she falls down, full of days, a corpse.    Things do not happen exactly like this under natural conditions. The  insect stands on the bushes back upwards; it keeps its balance in the  regular attitude and turns over only in circumstances that occur at  long intervals. The protracted suspension of my captives is all the  more remarkable inasmuch as it is not at all an innate habit of their  race.    It reminds one of the Bats, who hang, head downwards, by their  hind-legs from the roof of their caves. A special formation of the toes  enables birds to sleep on one leg, which automatically and without  fatigue clutches the swaying bough. The Empusa shows me nothing akin to  their contrivance. The extremity of her walking-legs has the ordinary  structure: a double claw at the tip, a double steelyard-hook; and that  is all.    I could wish that anatomy would show me the working of the muscles and  nerves in those tarsi, in those legs more slender than threads, the  action of the tendons that control the claws and keep them gripped for  ten months, unwearied in waking and sleeping. If some dexterous scalpel  should ever investigate this problem, I can recommend another, even  more singular than that of the Empusa, the Bat and the bird. I refer to  the attitude of certain Wasps and Bees during the night's rest.    An Ammophila with red fore-legs (A. holosericea) is plentiful in my  enclosure towards the end of August and selects a certain  lavender-border for her dormitory. At dusk, especially after a stifling  day, when a storm is brewing, I am sure to find the strange sleeper  settled there. Never was more eccentric attitude adopted for a night's  rest! The mandibles bite right into the lavender-stem. Its square shape  supplies a firmer hold than a round stalk"]]]
