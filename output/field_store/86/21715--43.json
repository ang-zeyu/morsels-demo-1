Here are, who all the Church maintains approve,  But yet the Church herself they will not love;  In angry speech, they blame the carnal tie  Which pure Religion lost her spirit by;  What time from prisons, flames, and tortures led,  She slumber'd careless in a royal bed;  To make, they add, the Church's glory shine,  Should Diocletian reign, not Constantine.     \"In pomp,\" they cry, \"is \"England's Church array'd,  Her cool Reformers wrought like men afraid;  We would have pull'd her gorgeous temples down,  And spurn'd her mitre, and defiled her gown:  We would have trodden low both bench and stall,  Nor left a tithe remaining, great or small.\"     Let us be serious--Should such trials come.  Are they themselves prepared for martyrdom?  It seems to us that our reformers knew  Th' important work they undertook to do;  An equal priesthood they were loth to try,  Lest zeal and care should with ambition die;  To them it seem'd that, take the tenth away,  Yet priests must eat, and you must feed or pay:  Would they indeed, who hold such pay in scorn,  Put on the muzzle when they tread the corn?  Would they all, gratis, watch and tend the fold,  Nor take one fleece to keep them from the cold?     Men are not equal, and 'tis meet and right  That robes and titles our respect excite;  Order requires it; 'tis by vulgar pride  That such regard is censured and denied;  Or by that false enthusiastic zeal,  That thinks the Spirit will the priest reveal,  And show to all men, by their powerful speech,  Who are appointed and inspired to teach:  Alas! could we the dangerous rule believe,  Whom for their teacher should the crowd receive?  Since all the varying kinds demand respect,  All press you on to join their chosen sect,  Although but in this single point agreed,  \"Desert your churches and adopt our creed.\"     We know full well how much our forms offend  The burthen'd Papist and the simple Friend:  Him, who new robes for every service takes,  And who in drab and beaver sighs and shakes;  He on the priest, whom hood and band adorn,  Looks with the sleepy eye of silent scorn;  But him I would not for my friend and guide,  Who views such things with spleen, or wears with pride.     See next our several Sects,--but first behold  The Church of Rome, who here is poor and old:  Use not triumphant raillery, or, at least,  Let not thy mother be a whore and beast;  Great was her pride indeed in ancient times,  Yet shall we think of nothing but her crimes?  Exalted high above all earthly things,  She placed her foot upon the neck of kings;  But some have deeply since avenged the crown,  And thrown her glory and her honours down;  Nor neck nor ear can she of kings command,  Nor place a foot upon her own fair land.     Among her sons, with us a quiet few,  Obscure themselves, her ancient state review,  And fond and melancholy glances cast  On power insulted, and on triumph past:  They look, they can but look, with many a sigh,  On sacred buildings doom'd in dust to lie;  \"On seats,\" they tell, \"where priests mid tapers dim  Breathed the warm prayer, or tuned the midnight hymn;  Where trembling penitents their guilt confessed,  Where want had succour, and contrition rest;  There weary men from trouble found relief,  There men in sorrow found repose from grief.  To scenes like these the fainting soul retired;  Revenge and anger in these cells expired;  By Pity soothed, Remorse lost half her fears,  And soften'd Pride dropp'd penitential tears.     \"Then convent walls and nunnery spires arose,  In pleasant spots which monk or abbot chose;  When counts and barons saints devoted fed,  And making cheap exchange, had pray'r for bread.     \"Now all is lost, the earth where abbeys stood  Is layman's land, the glebe, the stream, the wood:  His oxen low where monks retired to eat,  His cows repose upon the prior's seat:  And wanton doves within the cloisters bill,  Where the chaste votary warr'd with wanton will.\"     Such is the change they mourn, but they restrain  The rage of grief, and passively complain.     We've Baptists old and new; forbear to ask  What the distinction--I decline the task;  This I perceive, that when a sect grows old,  Converts are few, and the converted cold:  First comes the hotbed heat, and while it glows  The plants spring up, and each with vigour grows:  Then comes the cooler day, and though awhile  The verdure prospers and the blossoms smile,  Yet poor the fruit, and form'd by long delay,  Nor will the profits for the culture pay;  The skilful gard'ner then no longer stops,  But turns to other beds for bearing crops.     Some Swedenborgians in our streets are found,  Those wandering walkers on enchanted ground,  Who in our world can other worlds survey,  And speak with spirits though confin'd in clay:  Of Bible-mysteries they the keys possess,  Assured themselves, where wiser men but guess:  'Tis theirs to see around, about, above, -  How spirits mingle thoughts, and angels move;  Those whom our grosser views from us exclude,  To them appear--a heavenly multitude;  While the dark sayings, seal'd to men like us,  Their priests interpret, and their flocks discuss.     But while these gifted men, a favour'd fold,  New powers exhibit and new worlds behold;  Is there not danger lest their minds confound  The pure above them with the gross around?  May not these Phaetons, who thus contrive  'Twixt heaven above and earth beneath to drive,  When from their flaming chariots they descend,  The worlds they visit in their fancies blend?  Alas! too sure on both they bring disgrace,  Their earth is crazy, and their heaven is base.     We have, it seems, who treat, and doubtless well,  Of a chastising not awarding Hell;  Who are assured that an offended God  Will cease to use the thunder and the rod;  A soul on earth, by crime and folly stain'd,  When here corrected has improvement gain'd;  In other state still more improved to grow,  And nobler powers in happier world to know;  New strength to use in each divine employ,  And more enjoying, looking to more joy.     A pleasing vision! could we thus be sure  Polluted souls would be at length so pure;  The view is happy, we may think it just,  It may be true-- but who shall add, it must?  To the plain words and sense of Sacred Writ,  With all my heart I reverently submit;  But where it leaves me doubtful, I'm afraid  To call conjecture to my reason's aid;  Thy thoughts, thy ways, great God! are not as mine,  And to thy mercy I my soul resign.     Jews are with us, but far unlike to those,  Who, led by David, warr'd with Israels foes;  Unlike to those whom his imperial son  Taught truths divine--the Preacher Solomon;  Nor war nor wisdom yield our Jews delight;  They will not study, and they dare not fight.     These are, with us, a slavish, knavish crew,  Shame and dishonour to the name of Jew;  The poorest masters of the meanest arts,  With cunning heads, and cold and cautious hearts;  They grope their dirty way to petty gains,  While poorly paid for their nefarious pains.  Amazing race! deprived of land and laws,  A general language and a public cause;  With a religion none can now obey,  With a reproach that none can take away:  A people still, whose common ties are gone;  Who, mix'd with every race, are lost in none.     What said their Prophet?--\"Shouldst thou disobey,  The Lord shall take thee from thy land away;  Thou shalt a by-word and a proverb be,  And all shall wonder at thy woes and thee;  Daughter and son, shalt thou, while captive, have,  And see them made the bond-maid and the slave;  He, whom thou leav'st, the Lord thy God, shall bring  War to thy country on an eagle-wing.  A people strong and dreadful to behold,  Stern to the young, remorseless to the old;  Masters whose speech thou canst not understand  By cruel signs shall give the harsh command:  Doubtful of life shalt thou by night, by day,  For grief, and dread, and trouble pine away;  Thy evening wish,--Would God I saw the sun  Thy morning sigh,--Would God the day were done!  Thus shalt thou suffer, and to distant times  Regret thy misery, and lament thy crimes.\"     A part there are, whom doubtless man might trust,  Worthy as wealthy, pure, religious, just;  They who with patience, yet with rapture, look  On the strong promise of the Sacred Book:  As unfulfill'd th' endearing words they view,  And blind to truth, yet own their prophets true;  Well pleased they look for Sion's coming state,  Nor think of Julian's boast and Julian's fate.     More might I add:  I might describe the flocks  Made by Seceders from the ancient stocks;  Those who will not to any guide submit,  Nor find one creed to their conceptions fit -  Each sect, they judge, in something goes astray,  And every church has lost the certain way!  Then for themselves they carve out creed and laws,  And weigh their atoms, and divide their straws.     A Sect remains, which, though divided long  In hostile parties, both are fierce and strong,  And into each enlists a warm and zealous throng.  Soon as they rose in fame, the strife arose,  The Calvinistic these, th' Arminian those;  With Wesley some remain'd, the remnant Whitfield chose.  Now various leaders both the parties take,  And the divided hosts their new divisions make.     See yonder Preacher! to his people pass,  Borne up and swell'd by tabernacle-gas:  Much he discourses, and of various points,  All unconnected, void of limbs and joints;  He rails, persuades, explains, and moves the will  By fierce bold words, and strong mechanic skill.     \"That Gospel, Paul with zeal and love maintain'd,  To others lost, to you is now explain'd;  No worldly learning can these points discuss,  Books teach them not as they are taught to us.  Illiterate call us!--let their wisest man  Draw forth his thousands as your Teacher can:  They give their moral precepts:  so, they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5225"],[0,"The Satyricon — Complete (#6)"],[1,"woman remarked that it would be necessary for  us to use our wits.  It turned out that her advice was sound, for I soon  found out that complacency to the one meant possession of the other.  Giton, in the meantime, was recruiting his exhausted strength, and  Tryphaena turned her attention to me, but, meeting with a repulse, she  flounced out in a rage.  The next thing this burning harlot did was to  discover my commerce with both husband and wife.  As for his wantonness  with me, she flung that aside, as by it she lost nothing, but she fell  upon the secret gratifications of Doris and made them known to Lycas,  who, his jealousy proving stronger than his lust, took steps to get  revenge.  Doris, however, forewarned by Tryphaena's maid, looked out  for squalls and held aloof from any secret assignations.  When I became  aware of all this, I heartily cursed the perfidy of Tryphaena and the  ungrateful soul of Lycas, and made up my mind to be gone.  Fortune  favored me, as it turned out, for a vessel sacred to Isis and laden with  prize-money had, only the day before, run upon the rocks in the vicinity.  After holding a consultation with Giton, at which he gladly gave consent  to my plan, as Tryphaena visibly neglected him after having sapped his  virility, we hastened to the sea-shore early on the following morning,  and boarded the wreck, a thing easy of accomplishment as the watchmen,  who were in the pay of Lycas, knew us well.  But they were so attentive  to us that there was no opportunity of stealing a thing until, having  left Giton with them, I craftily slipped out of sight and sneaked aft  where the statue of Isis stood, and despoiled it of a valuable mantle and  a silver sistrum.  From the master's cabin, I also pilfered other  valuable trifles and, stealthily sliding down a rope, went ashore.  Giton  was the only one who saw me and he evaded the watchmen and slipped away  after me.  I showed him the plunder, when he joined me, and we decided  to post with all speed to Ascyltos, but we did not arrive at the home of  Lycurgus until the following day.  In a few words I told Ascyltos of the  robbery, when he joined us, and of our unfortunate love-affairs as well.  He was for prepossessing the mind of Lycurgus in our favor, naming the  increasing wantonness of Lycas as the cause of our secret and sudden  change of habitation.  When Lycurgus had heard everything, he swore  that he would always be a tower of strength between us and our enemies.  Until Tryphaena and Doris were awake and out of bed, our flight remained  undiscovered, for we paid them the homage of a daily attendance at the  morning toilette.  When our unwonted absence was noted, Lycas sent out  runners to comb the sea-shore, for he suspected that we had been to the  wreck, but he was still unaware of the robbery, which was yet unknown  because the stern of the wreck was lying away from the beach, and the  master had not, as yet, gone back aboard.  Lycas flew into a towering  rage when our flight was established for certain, and railed bitterly at  Doris, whom he considered as the moving factor in it.  Of the hard words  and the beating he gave her I will say nothing, for the particulars are  not known to me, but I will affirm that Tryphaena, who was the sole cause  of the unpleasantness, persuaded Lycas to hunt for his fugitives in the  house of Lycurgus, which was our most probable sanctuary.  She  volunteered to accompany him in person, so that she could load us with  the abuse which we deserved at her hands.  They set out on the following  day and arrived at the estate of Lycurgus, but we were not there, for he  had taken us to a neighboring town to attend the feast of Hercules, which  was there being celebrated.  As soon as they found out about this, they  hastened to take to the road and ran right into us in the portico of the  temple.  At sight of them, we were greatly put out, and Lycas held forth  violently to Lycurgus, upon the subject of our flight, but he was met  with raised eyebrows and such a scowling forehead that I plucked up  courage and, in a loud voice, passed judgment upon his lewd and base  attempts and assaults upon me, not in the house of Lycurgus alone, but  even under his own roof: and as for the meddling Tryphaena, she received  her just deserts, for, at great length, I described her moral turpitude  to the crowd, our altercation had caused a mob to collect, and, to give  weight to my argument, I pointed to limber-hamed Giton, drained dry, as  it were, and to myself, reduced almost to skin and bones by the raging  lust of that nymphomaniac harlot.  So humiliated were our enemies by the  guffaws of the mob, that in gloomy ill-humor they beat a retreat to plot  revenge.  As they perceived that we had prepossessed the mind of Lycurgus  in our favor, they decided to await his return, at his estate, in order  that they might wean him away from his misapprehension.  As the  solemnities did not draw to a close until late at night, we could not  reach Lycurgus' country place, so he conducted us to a villa of his,  situated near the halfway point of the journey, and, leaving us to sleep  there until the next day, he set off for his estate for the purpose of  transacting some business.  Upon his arrival, he found Lycas and  Tryphaena awaiting him, and they stated their case so diplomatically that  they prevailed upon him to deliver us into their hands.  Lycurgus, cruel  by nature and incapable of keeping his word, was by this time striving to  hit upon the best method of betraying us, and to that end, he persuaded  Lycas to go for help, while he himself returned to the villa and had us  put under guard.  To the villa he came, and greeted us with a scowl as  black as any Lycas himself had ever achieved, clenching his fists again  and again, he charged us with having lied about Lycas, and, turning  Ascyltos out, he gave orders that we were to be kept confined to the room  in which we had retired to rest.  Nor would he hear a word in our  defense, from Ascyltos, but, taking the latter with him, he returned to  his estate, reiterating his orders relative to our confinement, which was  to last until his return.  On the way back, Ascyltos vainly essayed to  break down Lycurgus' determination, but neither prayers nor caresses, nor  even tears could move him.  Thereupon my \"brother\" conceived the design  of freeing us from our chains, and, antagonized by the stubbornness of  Lycurgus, he positively refused to sleep with him, and through this he  was in a better position to carry out the plan which he had thought out.  When the entire household was buried in its first sleep, Ascyltos loaded  our little packs upon his back and slipped out through a breach in the  wall, which he had previously noted, arriving at the villa with the dawn.  He gained entrance without opposition and found his way to our room,  which the guards had taken the precaution to bar.  It was easy to force  an entrance, as the fastening was made of wood, which same he pried off  with a piece of iron.  The fall of the lock roused us, for we were  snoring away, in spite of our unfortunate situation.  On account of the  long vigil, the guard was in such a deep sleep that we alone were wakened  by the crashing fall of the lock, and Ascyltos, coming in, told us in a  few words what he had done for us; but as far as that goes, not many were  necessary.  We were hurriedly dressing, when I was seized with the notion  of killing the guard and stripping the place.  This plan I confided to  Ascyltos, who approved of the looting, but pointed out a more desirable  solution without bloodshed: knowing all the crooks and turns, as he did,  he led us to a store-room which he opened.  We gathered up all that was  of value and sallied forth while it was yet early in the morning.  Shunning the public roads; we could not rest until we believed ourselves  safe from pursuit.  Ascyltos, when he had caught his breath, gloatingly  exulted of the pleasure which the looting of a villa belonging to  Lycurgus, a superlatively avaricious man, afforded him: he complained,  with justice of his parsimony, affirming that he himself had received no  reward for his k-nightly services, that he had been kept at a dry table  and on a skimpy ration of food.  This Lycurgus was so stingy that he  denied himself even the necessities of life, his immense wealth to the  contrary notwithstanding.)         The tortured Tantalus still stands, to parch in his shifting pool,         And starve, when fruit sways just beyond his grasp:         The image of the miser rich, when his avaricious soul         Robs him of food and drink, in Plenty's clasp.    (Ascyltos was for going to Naples that same day, but I protested the  imprudence of going to any place where they would be on the lookout for  us.  \"Let's absent ourselves, for a while, and travel in the country.  We  are well supplied with means.\"  This advice took his fancy and we set out  for a part of the country noted for the beauty of its estates, and where  not a few of our acquaintances were enjoying the sports of the season.  Scarcely had we covered half the distance, however, before it began to  pour down rain by the bucketful, compelling us to run for the nearest  village.  Upon entering the inn, we noticed many other wayfarers, who had  put up there to escape the storm.  The jam prevented our being watched,  and at the same time made it easier for us to pry about with curious  eyes, on the alert for something to appropriate.  Ascyltos, unseen by  anyone, picked up off the ground a little pouch in which he found some  gold pieces.  We were overjoyed with this auspicious beginning, but,  fearing that some one would miss the gold, we stealthily slipped out by  the back door.  A slave, who was saddling a horse in the courtyard,  suddenly left his work and went into the house, as if he had forgotten  something, and while he was gone I appropriated a superb"]]]
