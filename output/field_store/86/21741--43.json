I was shown a  little north of the town a place where the Dutch, true to their  national instincts, began a canal to supply Loanda with sweet and  wholesome drinking material and water communication; others place  it with more probability near the confluence of the Cuanza and  the Lucala, the first great northern fork, where Massangano was  built by the Conquistadores. This \"leat\" was left incomplete, the  terminus being three miles from St. Paul's; the Governor-General  José de Oliveira Barbosa, attempted to restore it, but was  prevented by considerations of cost.    Calumbo must be a gruesome place to all except its natives.  Whilst Loanda has improved in climate since Captain Owen's day  (1826), this has become deadly as Rome in 1873. The raw mists in  early morning and the hot suns, combined with the miasmas of the  retreating waters, sometimes produce a \"carneirado\" (bilious  remittent) which carries off half the inhabitants. Dysenteries  are everywhere dangerous between the Guinea Coast and Mossamedes,  the cause being vile water. All the people looked very sickly;  many wore milongos, Fetish medicines in red stripes, and not a  few had whitewashed faces in token of mourning. I observed that  my Portuguese companions took quinine as a precaution. Formerly a  few foreign merchants were settled here, but they found the hot  seasons fatal, and no wonder, with 130° (F.) in the shade! The  trade from the upper river, especially from the Presidio das  Pedras Negras de Pungo Andongo,[FN#2] consists of hides, cattle  tame and wild (cefos); saltpetre washed from earth in sieves,  mucocote or gum anime (copal), said by Lopes de Lima to be found  in all the forests of Pungo Andongo; wax, white and yellow; oil  of the dendêm (Elaïs Guineënsis) and mandobim, here called  ginguba (arachis); mats, manioc-flour, and sometimes an ivory.    Calumbo was built as early as 1577 by the Conquistador Porcador  and first Capitão Mór Paulo Dias II., a gallant soldier, who died  in 1589 at Massangano, the \"Presidium,\" which he had founded  between 1580-83, and who was buried in the Church of Na. Sa. da  Vittoria; he is said also to have built the Church of Santa Cruz.  Equidistant from Loanda and the sea, the settlement soon had a  wealthy trade with the fortified stations of the interior, and  large Government stores filled with merchandize. In 1820 a number  of schooners, pinnaces, and small crafts plied up and down to  Muchimo, Massangano, Cambembe, and other inland settlements; now  we find out only a few canoes. The Cuanza at \"Sleepers' Bay\" has  one of the worst shifting bars on the whole coast. At this  distance, five leagues from the mouth, its width is one hundred  fathoms, and the depth varies from eight to nine. It breeds good  fish; the manatus is common, people talk of fresh-water sharks,  and the jacare (crocodile) is fatal to many a pig even in the  village. It is navigable for schooners, they say, six days, or  150 miles, to the large \"Presidio de Cambembe,\" where Andrew  Battel (1589-1600) visited a \"perpendicular water-fall, which  made such a noise as to be heard thirty miles' distance.\" This  and another water-fall higher up are laid down in the map of Dr.  Livingstone's admirable first journey. Above Cambembe the river-  bed is broken by archipelagoes, and the shoals render it fit only  for boats. The Cuanza head has been explored only lately,  although a royal order to that effect was issued on March 14,  1800.    After receiving and returning the visits of the principal whites,  all habited in frocks and continuations of the blackest and  heaviest broadcloth, we feasted with the excellent commandant,  who was hospitality itself. The mosquitoes soon roused us from  any attempt at sleep, and we passed the night after a fashion  which sometimes leads to red eyes and \"hot coppers\" in the  morning. I left early, for my companions had business at Calumbo;  as they were no longer present to control the bearers, a race  soft as putty, and I was not used to manage them, the gang became  unbearable. The soldier sent to keep them in order did his best  with his \"supple-jack,\" and the consequence was that all bolted  into the bush. At Cavúa two men were forcibly enlisted, but I  preferred walking in. When at home in the Red House (Mr.  Hewett's) the hammock men came complaining of my deserting them,  and begging bakhshish.    It was another lesson to me--the Gaboon had lately administered  one--that, however well you may know the negro generally, each  tribe requires a specific study. This, however, would not take  long, and with a little knowledge of the language there would be  no difficulty in following the footsteps of Joaquim Rodrigues  Graça; letters would be required to the several commandants, the  season of setting out should be in early Cacimbo (April), and the  up march would take six months, with about four to return. But,  unless active measures are adopted, only the seaboard will remain  to the Portuguese. This is an exploration which I had kept \"dark\"  for myself; but Captain von Homeyer has gained the day, and  nothing remains for me but to give the gallant officer God speed.  After a short but exceedingly pleasant visit, I left the capital  of Angola with regret. All seemed anxious to further my views of  travel; the authorities gave me the very best advice, and offered  me introductions to all the district commandants, Sr. Moses  Abecasis, and Sr. Francisco A. Flores, Sir Henry Huntley's host,  obliged me with recommendations to the most influential agents at  Porto da Lenha on the Congo River. Mr. Essex of St. Helena placed  me in the hands of his compatriot, Mr. Scott, and Captain  Hoskins, R.N., ended his kindness with ordering for me a passage  on board H.M. Steamship \"Griffon,\" an old acquaintance in the  Gaboon River. Briefly, I quitted São Paulo with the best wishes  for one and all who had befriended me.                                      Chapter IV.        The Cruise along Shore--the Granite Pillar of Kinsembo.        On August 22nd we left Loanda, and attacked the 180 miles  separating it from the Congo mouth. Steaming along shore we  enjoyed the vanishing perspective of the escarpment disappearing  in the misty distance. The rivers Bengo, Dande, and Onze are  denoted by densely wooded fissures breaking the natural sea-wall,  and, as usual in West Africa, these lines are the favourite sites  for settlements. The Onze or the Lifune of Mazula Bay--which the  Hydrographic Chart (republished March 18, 1869) changes into  \"River Mazulo,\" and makes the mouth of the \"River Onzo\"--is  chosen by Bowdich and writers of his day as the northern boundary  of Angola, greatly to the disgust of the Portuguese, whose  pretensions extend much farther north. Volumes of daily smoke and    048--- nightly flame suggest the fires of St. John lighted by the  goatherds of Tenerife. They greatly excite the gallant  \"Griffons,\" who everywhere see slaver-signals, and the system is  old upon this coast as the days of Hanno and Herodotus. At this  season they are an infallible sign that the dries are ending; the  women burn the capim (tall grass) for future forage, and to  manure the land for manioc, maize, and beans. The men seek  present \"bush-beef:\" as the flames blow inland, they keep to  seaward, knowing that game will instinctively and infallibly  break cover in that direction, and they have learned the  \"wrinkle\" of the prairie traveller to make a \"little Zoar\" in  case of accidental conflagration.    At 2 P.M. on the 24th we were abreast of Ambriz, an important  settlement, where a tall red and white cliff, with a background  of broken blue hill, showed a distinct \"barra,\" or river mouth,  not to be confounded with the English \"bar.\" The north point of  the Rio dos Ambres, of the \"green\" or \"raw copal,\" is low and  mangrove-grown, throwing into high relief its sister formation,  Ambriz Head or Strong-Tide Corner, which stands up gaunt and  bluff.    A little to the south-east lies the fort, flying the argent and  azure flag, and garrisoned by some 200 men; five large  whitewashed houses and the usual bunch of brown huts compose the  settlement. This nest of slavers was temporarily occupied in May  15, 1855. The Governor-General, Senor Coelho de Amaral,  reinforced by 1,000 soldiers from home, and levying 2,500  \"Empacasseiros,\"[FN#3] embarked from Loanda in the \"Dorn  Fernando\" frigate, landed here, once more burnt the barracoons,  and built the fort. In 1856 a force was sent under Colonel  Francisco Salles Ferreira, to re-open a communication with the  Bembe mines of copper and malachite. That energetic officer  marched on São Salvador, the old capital of Congo, and crowned  Dom Pedro V., whose predecessor died the year before. He there  fell a victim to fever, and his second in command, Major Andrade,  was nearly cut off on his return. Shortly afterwards the natives  blockaded, but were driven from, Bembe, and they attempted in  vain to carry Ambriz.    The far-famed copper mines were granted to the Portuguese in the  sixteenth century by the King of Congo. They were the property of  his feudatory, the (black) \"Marquess of Pemba\" (Bembe): Barbot  mentions their being mistaken for gold, and feels himself bound  to warn his readers that the metal was brought \"from Sondy, not  from Abyssinia or the empire of Prester John.\" They lost all  their mystery about A.D. 1855, when they were undertaken by an  English company, Messrs. John Taylor & Co. of London, after  agreement with the concessionists, Messrs. Francisco A. Flores  and Pinto Perez of Loanda. Between Ambriz and Bembe, on the  Lunguila (Lufula?) River, and 770 feet above sea-level, the  Angolan government built four presidios, Matuta, Quidilla,  Quileala, and Quimalenco. But the garrison was not strong enough  to keep the country quiet,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5762"],[0,"Grammar and Vocabulary of the Lau Language, Solomon Islands (#6)"],[1," _agamu_ poss. pl. 2. for you, among you, for your part, you (obj.);  _ati mwane agamu_, what man among you?    _agani_ v. tr. to pluck out.
