The result of such an accident  would probably be the unsettling of an acquired habit, the return to  the usual suspicious attitude.    Birds are able sometimes to discriminate between protectors and  persecutors, but seldom very well I should imagine; they do not view  the face only, but the whole form, and our frequent change of dress  must make it difficult for them to distinguish the individuals they  know and trust from strangers. Even a dog is occasionally at fault  when his master, last seen in black and grey suit, reappears in straw  hat and flannels.    Nevertheless, if birds once come to know those who habitually protect  them and form a trustful habit, this will not be abandoned on account  of a little rough treatment on occasions. A lady at Worthing told me  of her blackbirds breeding in her garden that they refused to be kept  from the strawberries when she netted the ripening fruit. One or more  of the birds would always manage to get under the net; and when she  would capture the robber and carry him, screaming, struggling and  pecking at her fingers, to the end of the garden and release him, he  would immediately follow her back to the bed and set himself to get at  the fruit again.    In a bird's relations with other mammals there is no room for doubt or  confusion; each consistently acts after its kind; once hostile, always  hostile; and if once seen to be harmless, then to be trusted for ever.  The fox must always be feared and detested; his disposition, like his  sharp nose and red coat, is unchangeable; so, too, with the cat,  stoat, weasel, etc. On the other hand, in the presence of herbivorous  mammals, birds show no sign of suspicion; they know that all these  various creatures are absolutely harmless, from the big  formidable-looking bull and roaring stag, to the mild-eyed, timorous  hare and rabbit. It is common to see wagtails and other species  attending cattle in the pastures, and keeping close to their noses, on  the look-out for the small insects driven from hiding in the grass.  Daws and starlings search the backs of cattle and sheep for ticks and  other parasites, and it is plain that their visits are welcome. Here a  joint interest unites bird and beast; it is the nearest approach to  symbiosis among the higher vertebrates of this country, but is far  less advanced than the partnership which exists between the rhinoceros  bird and the rhinoceros or buffalo, and between the spur-winged plover  and crocodile in Africa.    One day I was walking by a meadow, adjoining the Bishop's palace at  Wells, where several cows were grazing, and noticed a little beyond  them a number of rooks and starlings scattered about. Presently a  flock of about forty of the cathedral jackdaws flew over me and  slanted down to join the other birds, when all at once two daws  dropped out of the flock on to the back of the cow standing nearest to  me. Immediately five more daws followed, and the crowd of seven birds  began eagerly pecking at the animal's hide. But there was not room  enough for them to move freely; they pushed and struggled for a  footing, throwing their wings out to keep their balance, looking like  a number of hungry vultures fighting for places on a carcase; and soon  two of the seven were thrown off and flew away. The remaining five,  although much straitened for room, continued for some time scrambling  over the cow's back, busy with their beaks and apparently very much  excited over the treasure they had discovered. It was amusing to see  how the cow took their visit; sinking her body as if about to lie down  and broadening her back, and dropping her head until her nose touched  the ground, she stood perfectly motionless, her tail stuck out behind  like a pump-handle. At length the daws finished their feeding and  quarrelling and flew away; but for some minutes the cow remained  immovable in the same attitude, as if the rare and delightful  sensation of so many beaks prodding and so many sharp claws scratching  her hide had not yet worn off.    Deer, too, like cows, are very grateful to the daw for its services.  In Savernake Forest I once witnessed a very pretty little scene. I  noticed a hind lying down by herself in a grassy hollow, and as I  passed her at a distance of about fifty yards it struck me as singular  that she kept her head so low down that I could only see the top of it  on a level with her back. Walking round to get a better sight, I saw a  jackdaw standing on the turf before her, very busily pecking at her  face. With my glass I was able to watch his movements very closely; he  pecked round her eyes, then her nostrils, her throat, and in fact  every part of her face; and just as a man when being shaved turns his  face this way and that under the gentle guiding touch of the barber's  fingers, and lifts up his chin to allow the razor to pass beneath it,  so did the hind raise and lower and turn her face about to enable the  bird to examine and reach every part with his bill. Finally the daw  left the face, and, moving round, jumped on to the deer's shoulders  and began a minute search in that part; having finished this he jumped  on to the head and pecked at the forehead and round the bases of the  ears. The pecking done, he remained for some seconds sitting perfectly  still, looking very pretty with the graceful red head for a stand, the  hind's long ears thrust out on either side of him. From his living  perch he sprang into the air and flew away, going close to the  surface; then slowly the deer raised her head and gazed after her  black friend--gratefully, and regretting his departure, I could not  but think.    Some birds when breeding exhibit great anxiety at the approach of any  animal to the nest; but even when most excited they behave very  differently towards herbivorous mammals and those which they know to  be at all times the enemies of their kind. The nest of a  ground-breeding species may be endangered by the proximity of a goat,  sheep, deer, or any grazing animal, but the birds do not winnow the  air above it, scream, make threatening dashes at its head, and try to  lead it away as they would do in the case of a dog or fox. When small  birds dash at and violently attack large animals and man in defence of  their nest, even though the nest may not have been touched, the action  appears to be purely instinctive and involuntary, almost unconscious,  in fact. Acts of this kind are more often seen in humming-birds than  in birds of other families; and humming-birds do not appear to  discriminate between rapacious and herbivorous mammals. When they see  a large animal moving about they fly close to and examine it for a few  moments, then dart away; if it comes too near the nest they will  attack it, or threaten an attack. When examining their nests I have  had humming-birds dash into my face. The action is similar to that of  a stingless, solitary carpenter bee, common in La Plata: a round burly  insect with a shining steel-blue body: when the tree or bush in which  this bee has its nest is approached by a man it darts about in an  eccentric manner, humming loudly, and at intervals remains suspended  motionless for ten or fifteen seconds at a height of seven or eight  yards above his head; suddenly it dashes quick as lightning into his  face, inflicting a sharp blow. The bee falls, as if stunned, a space  of a couple of feet, then rises again to repeat the action.    There is certainly a wide difference between so simple an instinctive  action as this, which cannot be regarded as intelligent or conscious,  and the actions of most birds in the presence of danger to their eggs  or young. In species that breed on the ground in open situations the  dangers to which bird and nest are exposed are of different kinds,  and, leaving out the case of that anomalous creature, man, we see that  as a rule the bird's judgment is not at fault. In one case it is  necessary that he should guard himself while trying to save his nest;  in another case the danger is to the nest only, and he then shows that  he has no fear for himself. The most striking instance I have met  with, bearing on this last point, relates to the action of a  spur-winged lapwing observed on the Pampas. The bird's loud excited  cries attracted my attention; a sheep was lying down with its nose  directly over the nest, containing three eggs, and the plover was  trying to make it get up and go away. It was a hot day and the sheep  refused to stir; possibly the fanning of the bird's wings was grateful  to her. After beating the sheep's face for some time it began pecking  sharply at the nose; then the sheep raised her head, but soon grew  tired of holding it up, and no sooner was it lowered than the blows  and peckings began again. Again the head was raised, and lowered again  with the same result, and this continued for about twelve or fourteen  minutes, until the annoyance became intolerable; then the sheep raised  her head and refused to lower it any more, and in that very  uncomfortable position, with her nose high in the air, she appeared  determined to stay. In vain the lapwing waited, and at last began to  make little jumps at the face. The nose was out of reach, but by and  by, in one of its jumps, it caught the sheep's ear in its beak and  remained hanging with drooping wings and dangling legs. The sheep  shook her head several times and at last shook the bird off; but no  sooner was it down than it jumped up and caught the ear again; then at  last the sheep, fairly beaten, struggled up to her feet, throwing the  bird off, and lazily walked away, shaking her head repeatedly.    How great the confidence of the plover must have been to allow it to  act in such a manner!    This perfect confidence which birds have in the mammals they have been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37809"],[0,"A Taxonomic Revision of the Leptodactylid Frog Genus Syrrhophus Cope (#6)"],[1," juveniles of nearly all leptodactylids, a frontoparietal  fontanelle is present. Firschein (1954) used the presence of the  fontanelle to distinguish _guttilatus_ from his _petrophilus_.    As is clearly evident from the length of the synonymy, I consider a  number of currently used names to be synonymous with _guttilatus_. I  have seen the holotypes of all four names and am unable to recognize  more than a single species. The holotype of _petrophilus_ is a male,  whereas that of _smithi_ is a female. The supposed differences are a  reflection of sexual dimorphism in the size of the eye (Table 5). The  two holotypes, as well as those of _gaigeae_ and _Malachylodes  guttilatus_ agree in color pattern.    Schmidt and Smith (1944) named _Syrrhophus gaigeae_ from the Chisos  Mountains of the Big Bend region of Texas and compared it only with  _S. marnockii_. Milstead, Mecham and McClintock (1950) synonymized  _gaigeae_ and _marnockii_ because they were unable to verify the  characters Wright and Wright (1949) used to separate them. Specimens  from the Big Bend region differ from those of the Edward and Stockton  Plateaus in having a vermiculate pattern, an interorbital bar, and a  supratympanic stripe. In these respects they agree with specimens from  northern Mexico. Based on limited observations, the Mexican population  is yellowish to brownish in life whereas the central Texas population is  green in life. Lacking evidence of genetic exchange, the two are held to  be specifically distinct.    Nearly every specimen examined was infested with chiggers of the genus  _Hannemania_. The greatest concentrations are on the venter, in the  groin, and on the thighs. Many specimens have chiggers on the digits and  tarsi. The same, or a related, chigger was found on many specimens of  _Syrrhophus marnockii_ and a few _S. verrucipes_, but on no other  species of the genus. Mr. Willy Wrenn told me that he has seen heavy  infestations of _Hannemania_ on _Syrrhophus pallidus_. Infestation by  _Hannemania_ probably reflects similar ecologies rather than close  relationships.

Taylor  (1940e) described it as a _Tomodactylus_, but Dixon (1957) pointed out  that _T. macrotympanum_ differed from the other species of the genus in  having a poorly developed lumbo-inguinal (inguinal) gland, and placed  the species in the genus _Syrrhophus_. Comparison of the holotypes of  _S. verrucipes_ and _T. macrotympanum_ leaves no doubt in my mind that a  single species is involved. This same species was reported by Smith and  Taylor (1948) as _S. verruculatus_.    _Syrrhophus verrucipes_ bears resemblance to members of both the  _leprus_ and _marnockii_ groups. In snout shape it is closer to the  _leprus_ group, whereas in digital pad, the shape of the general body  form, and contiguity of habitat it is most similar to the _marnockii_  group (_S. guttilatus_).    _Etymology._--Latin, meaning warty foot, probably in reference to the  numerous plantar supernumerary tubercles.    _Distribution._--Moderate elevations in southeastern San Luis Potosi,  Queretaro, and northwestern Hidalgo, Mexico (Fig. 7).    _Specimens examined_--(43) MEXICO, _Hidalgo_: Jacala, UMMZ 106434; 9.6  km.
