The chimpanzee is a near neighbour of the gorilla in Equatorial Africa  though he appears to have a more extended range. He is found in Sierra  Leone and in the country lying to the north of the river Congo, and  according to native accounts is gregarious in his habits, travelling in  formidable companies, who carry sticks and make effective use of them.  They are said to reach maturity at nine or ten years of age and to  attain a height of from four to five feet. Like the gorillas they have  immensely powerful limbs, and have been known without apparent effort to  break off branches of trees which a man would have been powerless to  bend.      The Docility and Sagacity of the Chimpanzee.    The chimpanzee differs from the gorilla in his amenability to  civilisation. The gorilla, however young, seems incapable of being  tamed; while the chimpanzee in its infancy and youth at least has often  been domesticated, though like most other apes, as it approaches  maturity, it needs to be kept under strong control. Captain Brown in his  \"Habits and Characteristics of Animals and Birds\" gives the following  illustration of the docility and sagacity of the chimpanzee. He says:  \"M. de GrandprA(C) saw, on board of a vessel, a female chimpanzee, which  exhibited wonderful proofs of intelligence. She had learnt to heat the  oven; she took great care not to let any of the coals fall out, which  might have done mischief in the ship; and she was very accurate in  observing when the oven was heated to the proper degree, of which she  immediately apprized the baker, who, relying with perfect confidence  upon her information, carried his dough to the oven as soon as the  chimpanzee came to fetch him. This animal performed all the business of  a sailor, spliced ropes, handled the sails, and assisted at unfurling  them; and she was, in fact considered by the sailors as one of  themselves. The vessel was bound for America; but the poor animal did  not live to see that country, having fallen a victim to the brutality of  the first mate, who inflicted very cruel chastisement upon her, which  she had not deserved. She endured it with the greatest patience, only  holding out her hands in a suppliant attitude, in order to break the  force of the blows she received. But from that moment she steadily  refused to take any food, and died on the fifth day from grief and  hunger. She was lamented by every person on board, not insensible to the  feelings of humanity, who knew the circumstances of her fate.\"      The Orang-utan.    The orang-utan is one of the largest of the ape species and until the  discovery of the gorilla was supposed to be the largest. It is said  sometimes to attain to the height of six feet, and some travellers'  tales credit it with even greater height. The orang is possessed of  great strength but is of a docile disposition when brought under  civilisation, and even in a wild state is often quiet and peaceable  except when attacked. It inhabits country that is low, level, and  swampy, and that is at the same time covered with lofty virgin forests.  It belongs to the genus _Simia_ of which it is the single species.      The Habits of the Orang-utan.    The following account of the orang is given by Mr. Brooke of Sarawak.  \"On the habits of the orangs, as far as I have been able to observe  them, I may remark that they are as dull and as slothful as can well be  conceived, and on no occasion, when pursuing them, did they move so fast  as to preclude my keeping pace with them easily through a moderately  clear forest; and even when obstructions below (such as wading up to  the neck) allowed them to get away some distance, they were sure to stop  and allow us to come up. I never observed the slightest attempt at  defence; and the wood, which sometimes rattled about our ears, was  broken by their weight, and not thrown, as some persons represent. If  pushed to extremity, however, the pappan could not be otherwise than  formidable; and one unfortunate man, who with a party was trying to  catch one alive, lost two of his fingers, besides being severely bitten  on the face, whilst the animal finally beat off his pursuers and  escaped. When hunters wish to catch an adult, they cut down a circle of  trees round the one on which he is seated, and then fell that also, and  close before he can recover himself, and endeavour to bind him. The rude  hut which they are stated to build in the trees would be more properly  called a seat, or nest, for it has no roof or cover of any sort. The  facility with which they form this seat is curious; and I had an  opportunity of seeing a wounded female weave the branches together, and  seat herself in a minute. She afterwards received our fire without  moving, and expired in her lofty abode, whence it cost us much trouble  to dislodge her. The adult male I killed was seated lazily on a tree;  and when approached only took the trouble to interpose the trunk between  us, peeping at me and dodging as I dodged. I hit him on the wrist, and  he was afterwards despatched.\"      The Walk of the Orang-utan.    In locomotion the orang disdains the earth and perambulates the vernal  terraces of the forest trees. \"It is a singular sight,\" says Mr.  Wallace, \"to watch a mias (orang-utan) making his way leisurely through  a forest. He walks deliberately along some of the larger branches in the  semi-erect attitude which the great length of his arms and the shortness  of his legs cause him naturally to assume, and seems always to choose  those branches which intermingle with an adjoining tree, on approaching  which he stretches out his long arms, and seizing the opposing boughs,  grasps them together with both hands, seems to try their strength, and  then deliberately swings himself across to the next branch on which he  walks along as before. He never jumps or springs, or even appears to  hurry himself, and yet manages to get along almost as quickly as a  person can run through the forest beneath.\"      The Strength of the Orang-utan.    \"The Dyaks,\" says Mr. Wallace, \"all declare that the mias is never  attacked by any animal in the forest, with two rare exceptions; and the  accounts received of these are so curious that I give them nearly in the  words of my informants, old Dyak Chiefs, who had lived all their lives  in the places where the animal is most abundant. The first of whom I  enquired said, 'No animal is strong enough to hurt the mias, and the  only creature he ever fights with is the crocodile. When there is no  fruit in the jungle he goes to seek food on the banks of the river where  there are plenty of young shoots that he likes, and fruits that grow  close to the water. Then the crocodile sometimes tries to seize him, but  the mias gets upon him and beats him with his hands and feet, and tears  and kills him.' He added that he had once seen such a fight and that he  believed that the mias is always the victor. My next informant was Orang  Kayo or chief of the Balow Dyaks on the Simunjou River. He said the mias  has no enemies, no animals dare attack it but the crocodile and the  python. He always kills the crocodile by main strength, standing upon  it, and pulling open its jaws and ripping up its throat. If a python  attacks a mias he seizes it with his hands and then bites it, and soon  kills it. The mias is very strong; there is no animal in the jungle so  strong as he.\"      The Docility of the Orang-utan.    Buffon thus describes an orang-utan that he saw: \"His aspect was  melancholy, his deportment grave, his movements regular, and his  disposition gentle. Unlike the baboon or the monkey, who are fond of  mischief, and only obedient through fear, a look kept him in awe; while  the other animals could not be brought to obey without blows. He would  present his hand to conduct the people who came to visit him, and walk  as gravely along with them as if he had formed a part of the company. I  have seen him sit down at table, when he would unfold his towel, wipe  his lips, use a spoon or a fork to carry his victuals to his mouth, pour  his liquor into a glass, and make it touch that of a person who drank  along with him. When invited to take tea, he would bring a cup and  saucer, place them on the table, put in sugar, pour out the tea, and  allow it to cool before he drank it. All this I have seen him perform  without any other instigation than the signs or the command of his  master, and often even of his own accord.\"      The Orang-utan's Intelligence.    M. de la Bosse thus describes two young orang-utans, male and female.  \"We had these animals with us on shipboard. They ate at the same table  with us. When they wanted anything, they, by certain signs, acquainted  the cabin boy with their wishes; and if he did not bring it, they  sometimes flew into a rage at him, bit him in the arm, and not  unfrequently threw him down. The male fell sick during the voyage, and  submitted to be treated like a human patient. The disease being of an  inflammatory nature, the surgeon bled him twice in the right arm; and  when he afterwards felt himself indisposed, he used to hold out his arm  to be bled, because he recollected that he found himself benefited by  that operation on a former occasion.\"      The Orang-utan's Affection.    Dr. Tyson in describing one of the earliest specimens of the orang  brought to London, says that it conceived a great affection for those  with whom travel had made it familiar, frequently embracing them with  the greatest tenderness. A female orang belonging to a Dutch menagerie  showed the greatest affection for her attendants, giving unmistakable  signs of her delight in their company and distress in their absence. She  would often take the hay from her bed and spread it at her side and with  anxious and obvious signs invite her keeper to sit beside her. M.  Palavicini credited a pair of orangs which he had in his possession in  1759"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3796"],[0,"Rilla of Ingleside (#6)"],[1,"of Carl Meredith. Miranda was  the daughter of Whiskers-on-the-moon; she did not share her father's  unpopularity but she was not much run after, being a pale, neutral  little creature, somewhat addicted to nervous giggling. She had silvery  blonde hair and her eyes were big china blue orbs that looked as if she  had been badly frightened when she was little and had never got over  it. She would much rather have walked with Joe than with Carl, with  whom she did not feel in the least at home. Yet it was something of an  honour, too, to have a college boy beside her, and a son of the manse  at that.    Shirley Blythe was with Una Meredith and both were rather silent  because such was their nature. Shirley was a lad of sixteen, sedate,  sensible, thoughtful, full of a quiet humour. He was Susan's \"little  brown boy\" yet, with his brown hair, brown eyes, and clear brown skin.  He liked to walk with Una Meredith because she never tried to make him  talk or badgered him with chatter. Una was as sweet and shy as she had  been in the Rainbow Valley days, and her large, dark-blue eyes were as  dreamy and wistful. She had a secret, carefully-hidden fancy for Walter  Blythe that nobody but Rilla ever suspected. Rilla sympathized with it  and wished Walter would return it. She liked Una better than Faith,  whose beauty and aplomb rather overshadowed other girls--and Rilla did  not enjoy being overshadowed.    But just now she was very happy. It was so delightful to be tripping  with her friends down that dark, gleaming road sprinkled with its  little spruces and firs, whose balsam made all the air resinous around  them. Meadows of sunset afterlight were behind the westerning hills.  Before them was the shining harbour. A bell was ringing in the little  church over-harbour and the lingering dream-notes died around the dim,  amethystine points. The gulf beyond was still silvery blue in the  afterlight. Oh, it was all glorious--the clear air with its salt tang,  the balsam of the firs, the laughter of her friends. Rilla loved  life--its bloom and brilliance; she loved the ripple of music, the hum  of merry conversation; she wanted to walk on forever over this road of  silver and shadow. It was her first party and she was going to have a  splendid time. There was nothing in the world to worry about--not even  freckles and over-long legs--nothing except one little haunting fear  that nobody would ask her to dance. It was beautiful and satisfying  just to be alive--to be fifteen--to be pretty. Rilla drew a long breath  of rapture--and caught it midway rather sharply. Jem was telling some  story to Faith--something that had happened in the Balkan War.    \"The doctor lost both his legs--they were smashed to pulp--and he was  left on the field to die. And he crawled about from man to man, to all  the wounded men round him, as long as he could, and did everything  possible to relieve their sufferings--never thinking of himself--he was  tying a bit of bandage round another man's leg when he went under. They  found them there, the doctor's dead hands still held the bandage tight,  the bleeding was stopped and the other man's life was saved. Some hero,  wasn't he, Faith? I tell you when I read that--\"    Jem and Faith moved on out of hearing. Gertrude Oliver suddenly  shivered. Rilla pressed her arm sympathetically.    \"Wasn't it dreadful, Miss Oliver? I don't know why Jem tells such  gruesome things at a time like this when we're all out for fun.\"    \"Do you think it dreadful, Rilla? I thought it wonderful--beautiful.  Such a story makes one ashamed of ever doubting human nature. That  man's action was godlike. And how humanity responds to the ideal of  self-sacrifice. As for my shiver, I don't know what caused it. The  evening is certainly warm enough. Perhaps someone is walking over the  dark, starshiny spot that is to be my grave. That is the explanation  the old superstition would give. Well, I won't think of that on this  lovely night. Do you know, Rilla, that when night-time comes I'm always  glad I live in the country. We know the real charm of night here as  town dwellers never do. Every night is beautiful in the country--even  the stormy ones. I love a wild night storm on this old gulf shore. As  for a night like this, it is almost too beautiful--it belongs to youth  and dreamland and I'm half afraid of it.\"    \"I feel as if I were part of it,\" said Rilla.    \"Ah yes, you're young enough not to be afraid of perfect things. Well,  here we are at the House of Dreams. It seems lonely this summer. The  Fords didn't come?\"    \"Mr. and Mrs. Ford and Persis didn't. Kenneth did--but he stayed with  his mother's people over-harbour. We haven't seen a great deal of him  this summer. He's a little lame, so didn't go about very much.\"    \"Lame? What happened to him?\"    \"He broke his ankle in a football game last fall and was laid up most  of the winter. He has limped a little ever since but it is getting  better all the time and he expects it will be all right before long. He  has been up to Ingleside only twice.\"    \"Ethel Reese is simply crazy about him,\" said Mary Vance. \"She hasn't  got the sense she was born with where he is concerned. He walked home  with her from the over-harbour church last prayer-meeting night and the  airs she has put on since would really make you weary of life. As if a  Toronto boy like Ken Ford would ever really think of a country girl  like Ethel!\"    Rilla flushed. It did not matter to her if Kenneth Ford walked home  with Ethel Reese a dozen times--it did not! Nothing that he did  mattered to her. He was ages older than she was. He chummed with Nan  and Di and Faith, and looked upon her, Rilla, as a child whom he never  noticed except to tease. And she detested Ethel Reese and Ethel Reese  hated her--always had hated her since Walter had pummelled Dan so  notoriously in Rainbow Valley days; but why need she be thought beneath  Kenneth Ford's notice because she was a country girl, pray? As for Mary  Vance, she was getting to be an out-and-out gossip and thought of  nothing but who walked home with people!    There was a little pier on the harbour shore below the House of Dreams,  and two boats were moored there. One boat was skippered by Jem Blythe,  the other by Joe Milgrave, who knew all about boats and was nothing  loth to let Miranda Pryor see it. They raced down the harbour and Joe's  boat won. More boats were coming down from the Harbour Head and across  the harbour from the western side. Everywhere there was laughter. The  big white tower on Four Winds Point was overflowing with light, while  its revolving beacon flashed overhead. A family from Charlottetown,  relatives of the light's keeper, were summering at the light, and they  were giving the party to which all the young people of Four Winds and  Glen St. Mary and over-harbour had been invited. As Jem's boat swung in  below the lighthouse Rilla desperately snatched off her shoes and  donned her silver slippers behind Miss Oliver's screening back. A  glance had told her that the rock-cut steps climbing up to the light  were lined with boys, and lighted by Chinese lanterns, and she was  determined she would not walk up those steps in the heavy shoes her  mother had insisted on her wearing for the road. The slippers pinched  abominably, but nobody would have suspected it as Rilla tripped  smilingly up the steps, her soft dark eyes glowing and questioning, her  colour deepening richly on her round, creamy cheeks. The very minute  she reached the top of the steps an over-harbour boy asked her to dance  and the next moment they were in the pavilion that had been built  seaward of the lighthouse for dances. It was a delightful spot, roofed  over with fir-boughs and hung with lanterns. Beyond was the sea in a  radiance that glowed and shimmered, to the left the moonlit crests and  hollows of the sand-dunes, to the right the rocky shore with its inky  shadows and its crystalline coves. Rilla and her partner swung in among  the dancers; she drew a long breath of delight; what witching music Ned  Burr of the Upper Glen was coaxing from his fiddle--it was really like  the magical pipes of the old tale which compelled all who heard them to  dance. How cool and fresh the gulf breeze blew; how white and wonderful  the moonlight was over everything! This was life--enchanting life.  Rilla felt as if her feet and her soul both had wings.        CHAPTER IV    THE PIPER PIPES    Rilla's first party was a triumph--or so it seemed at first. She had so  many partners that she had to split her dances. Her silver slippers  seemed verily to dance of themselves and though they continued to pinch  her toes and blister her heels that did not interfere with her  enjoyment in the least. Ethel Reese gave her a bad ten minutes by  beckoning her mysteriously out of the pavilion and whispering, with a  Reese-like smirk, that her dress gaped behind and that there was a  stain on the flounce. Rilla rushed miserably to the room in the  lighthouse which was fitted up for a temporary ladies' dressing-room,  and discovered that the stain was merely a tiny grass smear and that  the gap was equally tiny where a hook had pulled loose. Irene Howard  fastened it up for her and gave her some over-sweet, condescending  compliments. Rilla felt flattered by Irene's condescension. She was an  Upper Glen girl of nineteen who seemed to like the society of the  younger girls--spiteful friends said because she could queen it over  them without rivalry. But Rilla thought Irene quite wonderful and loved  her for her patronage. Irene was pretty and stylish; she sang divinely  and spent every winter in Charlottetown taking music lessons. She had  an aunt in Montreal who sent her wonderful things to wear; she was  reported to have had a sad love affair--nobody knew just what, but its  very mystery allured. Rilla felt that Irene's compliments crowned her  evening. She ran gaily back to the pavilion "]]]
