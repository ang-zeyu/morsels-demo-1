My  reinforcement was already gone, and another man with it.    With my diminished party I resumed the trail and followed it until  about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, when we heard the sound of voices,  and the corporal, thinking we were approaching Lieutenant  Williamson's party, was so overjoyed in anticipation of the junction,  that he wanted to fire his musket as an expression of his delight.  This I prevented his doing, however, and we continued cautiously and  slowly on to develop the source of the sounds in front.  We had not  gone far before I discovered that the noise came from a band of Pit  River Indians, who had struck the trail of the surveying expedition,  and were following it up, doubtless with evil intent.  Dismounting  from my horse I counted the moccasin tracks to ascertain the number  of Indians, discovered it to be about thirty, and then followed on  behind them cautiously, but with little difficulty, as appearances of  speed on their part indicated that they wished to overtake Lieutenant  Williamson's party, which made them less on the lookout than usual  for any possible pursuers.  After following the trail until nearly  sundown, I considered it prudent to stop for the night, and drew off  some little distance, where, concealed in a dense growth of timber,  we made our camp.    As I had with me now only two men, I felt somewhat nervous, so I  allowed no fires to be built, and in consequence our supper consisted  of hard bread only.  I passed an anxious night, but beyond our own  solicitude there was nothing to disturb us, the Indians being too  much interested in overtaking the party in front to seek for victims  in the rear, After a hard-bread breakfast we started again on the  trail, and had proceeded but a short distance when, hearing the  voices of the Indians, we at once slackened our speed so as not to  overtake them.    Most of the trail on which we traveled during the morning ran over an  exceedingly rough lava formation--a spur of the lava beds often  described during the Modoc war of 1873 so hard and flinty that  Williamson's large command made little impression on its surface,  leaving in fact, only indistinct traces of its line of march.  By  care and frequent examinations we managed to follow his route through  without much delay, or discovery by the Indians, and about noon,  owing to the termination of the lava formation, we descended into the  valley of Hat Greek, a little below where it emerges from the second  canon and above its confluence with Pit River.  As soon as we reached  the fertile soil of the valley, we found Williamson's trail well  defined, deeply impressed in the soft loam, and coursing through  wild-flowers and luxuriant grass which carpeted the ground on every  hand.    When we struck this delightful locality we traveled with considerable  speed, and after passing over hill and vale for some distance, the  trail becoming more and more distinct all the time, I suddenly saw in  front of me the Pit River Indians.    This caused a halt, and having hurriedly re-capped our guns and  six-shooters, thus preparing for the worst, I took a look at the band  through my field-glass.  They were a half-mile or more in our front  and numbered about thirty individuals, armed with bows and arrows  only.  Observing us they made friendly demonstrations, but I had not  implicit faith in a Pit River Indian at that period of the settlement  of our country, and especially in that wild locality, so after a  \"council of war\" with the corporal and man, I concluded to advance to  a point about two hundred yards distant from the party, when, relying  on the speed of our horses rather than on the peaceable intentions of  the savages, I hoped to succeed in cutting around them and take the  trail beyond.  Being on foot they could not readily catch us, and  inasmuch as their arrows were good for a range of only about sixty  yards, I had no fear of any material damage on that score.    On reaching the place selected for our flank movement we made a dash  to the left of the trail, through the widest part of the valley, and  ran our horses swiftly by, but I noticed that the Indians did not  seem to be disturbed by the manoeuvre and soon realized that this  indifference was occasioned by the knowledge that we could not cross  Hat Creek, a deep stream with vertical banks, too broad to be leaped  by our horses.  We were obliged, therefore, to halt, and the Indians  again made demonstrations of friendship, some of them even getting  into the stream to show that they were at the ford.  Thus reassured,  we regained our confidence and boldly crossed the river in the midst  of them.  After we had gained the bluff on the other side of the  creek, I looked down into the valley of Pit River, and could plainly  see the camp of the surveying party.  Its proximity was the influence  which had doubtless caused the peaceable conduct of the Indians.  Probably the only thing that saved us was their ignorance of our  being in their rear, until we stumbled on them almost within sight of  the large party under Williamson.    The Pit River Indians were very hostile at that time, and for many  succeeding years their treachery and cruelty brought misfortune and  misery to the white settlers who ventured their lives in search of  home and fortune in the wild and isolated section over which these  savages roamed.  Not long after Williamson's party passed through  their country, the Government was compelled to send into it a  considerable force for the purpose of keeping them under control.  The outcome of this was a severe fight--resulting in the loss of a  good many lives--between the hostiles and a party of our troops under  Lieutenant George Crook.  It finally ended in the establishment of a  military post in the vicinity of the battle-ground, for the permanent  occupation of the country.    A great load was lifted from my heart when I found myself so near  Williamson's camp, which I joined August 4, 1855, receiving a warm  welcome from the officers.  During the afternoon I relieved  Lieutenant Hood of the command of the personal escort, and he was  ordered to return, with twelve of the mounted men, over the trail I  had followed.  I pointed out to him on the map the spot where he  would find the two men left on the roadside, and he was directed to  take them into Fort Reading.  They were found without difficulty, and  carried in to the post.  The sick man--Duryea--whom I had expected  never to see again, afterward became the hospital steward at Fort  Yamhill, Oregon, when I was stationed there.    The Indians that I had passed at the ford came to the bluff above the  camp, and arranging themselves in a squatting posture, looked down  upon Williamson's party with longing eyes, in expectation of a feast.  They were a pitiable lot, almost naked, hungry and cadaverous.  Indians are always hungry, but these poor creatures were particularly  so, as their usual supply of food had grown very scarce from one  cause and another.    In prosperity they mainly subsisted on fish, or game killed with the  bow and arrow.  When these sources failed they lived on grasshoppers,  and at this season the grasshopper was their principal food.  In  former years salmon were very abundant in the streams of the  Sacramento Valley, and every fall they took great quantities of these  fish and dried them for winter use, but alluvial mining had of late  years defiled the water of the different streams and driven the fish  out.  On this account the usual supply of salmon was very limited.  They got some trout high up on the rivers, above the sluices and  rockers of the miners, but this was a precarious source from which to  derive food, as their means of taking the trout were very primitive.  They had neither hooks nor lines, but depended entirely on a  contrivance made from long, slender branches of willow, which grew on  the banks of most of the streams.  One of these branches would be  cut, and after sharpening the butt-end to a point, split a certain  distance, and by a wedge the prongs divided sufficiently to admit a  fish between.  The Indian fisherman would then slyly put the forked  end in the water over his intended victim, and with a quick dart  firmly wedge him between the prongs.  When secured there, the work of  landing him took but a moment.  When trout were plentiful this  primitive mode of taking them was quite successful, and I have often  known hundreds of pounds to be caught in this way, but when they were  scarce and suspicious the rude method was not rewarded with good  results.    The band looking down on us evidently had not had much fish or game  to eat for some time, so when they had made Williamson understand  that they were suffering for food he permitted them to come into  camp, and furnished them with a supply, which they greedily swallowed  as fast as it was placed at their service, regardless of possible  indigestion.  When they had eaten all they could hold, their  enjoyment was made complete by the soldiers, who gave them a quantity  of strong plug tobacco.  This they smoked incessantly, inhaling all  the smoke, so that none of the effect should be lost.  When we  abandoned this camp the next day, the miserable wretches remained in  it and collected the offal about the cooks' fires to feast still  more, piecing out the meal, no doubt, with their staple article of  food--grasshoppers.    On the morning of August 5 Lieutenant Hood started back to Fort  Reading, and Lieutenant Williamson resumed his march for the Columbia  River.  Our course was up Pit River, by the lower and upper canons,  then across to the Klamath Lakes, then east, along their edge to the  upper lake.  At the middle Klamath Lake, just after crossing Lost  River and the Natural Bridge, we met a small party of citizens from  Jacksonville, Oregon,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4363"],[0,"Beyond Good and Evil (#6)"],[1,"conscience--still more so, a doctrine of the derivation of all good  impulses from bad ones. If, however, a person should regard even  the emotions of hatred, envy, covetousness, and imperiousness  as life-conditioning emotions, as factors which must be present,  fundamentally and essentially, in the general economy of life (which  must, therefore, be further developed if life is to be further  developed), he will suffer from such a view of things as from  sea-sickness. And yet this hypothesis is far from being the strangest  and most painful in this immense and almost new domain of dangerous  knowledge, and there are in fact a hundred good reasons why every one  should keep away from it who CAN do so! On the other hand, if one has  once drifted hither with one's bark, well! very good! now let us set our  teeth firmly! let us open our eyes and keep our hand fast on the helm!  We sail away right OVER morality, we crush out, we destroy perhaps the  remains of our own morality by daring to make our voyage thither--but  what do WE matter. Never yet did a PROFOUNDER world of insight reveal  itself to daring travelers and adventurers, and the psychologist who  thus \"makes a sacrifice\"--it is not the sacrifizio dell' intelletto,  on the contrary!--will at least be entitled to demand in return that  psychology shall once more be recognized as the queen of the sciences,  for whose service and equipment the other sciences exist. For psychology  is once more the path to the fundamental problems.        CHAPTER II. THE FREE SPIRIT      24. O sancta simplicitas! In what strange simplification and  falsification man lives! One can never cease wondering when once one has  got eyes for beholding this marvel! How we have made everything around  us clear and free and easy and simple! how we have been able to give  our senses a passport to everything superficial, our thoughts a godlike  desire for wanton pranks and wrong inferences!--how from the beginning,  we have contrived to retain our ignorance in order to enjoy an almost  inconceivable freedom, thoughtlessness, imprudence, heartiness,  and gaiety--in order to enjoy life! And only on this solidified,  granite-like foundation of ignorance could knowledge rear itself  hitherto, the will to knowledge on the foundation of a far more powerful  will, the will to ignorance, to the uncertain, to the untrue! Not as  its opposite, but--as its refinement! It is to be hoped, indeed, that  LANGUAGE, here as elsewhere, will not get over its awkwardness, and that  it will continue to talk of opposites where there are only degrees  and many refinements of gradation; it is equally to be hoped that the  incarnated Tartuffery of morals, which now belongs to our unconquerable  \"flesh and blood,\" will turn the words round in the mouths of us  discerning ones. Here and there we understand it, and laugh at the way  in which precisely the best knowledge seeks most to retain us in this  SIMPLIFIED, thoroughly artificial, suitably imagined, and suitably  falsified world: at the way in which, whether it will or not, it loves  error, because, as living itself, it loves life!    25. After such a cheerful commencement, a serious word would fain be  heard; it appeals to the most serious minds. Take care, ye philosophers  and friends of knowledge, and beware of martyrdom! Of suffering \"for the  truth's sake\"! even in your own defense! It spoils all the innocence  and fine neutrality of your conscience; it makes you headstrong against  objections and red rags; it stupefies, animalizes, and brutalizes, when  in the struggle with danger, slander, suspicion, expulsion, and even  worse consequences of enmity, ye have at last to play your last card  as protectors of truth upon earth--as though \"the Truth\" were such an  innocent and incompetent creature as to require protectors! and you of  all people, ye knights of the sorrowful countenance, Messrs Loafers and  Cobweb-spinners of the spirit! Finally, ye know sufficiently well that  it cannot be of any consequence if YE just carry your point; ye know  that hitherto no philosopher has carried his point, and that there might  be a more laudable truthfulness in every little interrogative mark  which you place after your special words and favourite doctrines (and  occasionally after yourselves) than in all the solemn pantomime and  trumping games before accusers and law-courts! Rather go out of the way!  Flee into concealment! And have your masks and your ruses, that ye may  be mistaken for what you are, or somewhat feared! And pray, don't forget  the garden, the garden with golden trellis-work! And have people around  you who are as a garden--or as music on the waters at eventide, when  already the day becomes a memory. Choose the GOOD solitude, the free,  wanton, lightsome solitude, which also gives you the right still to  remain good in any sense whatsoever! How poisonous, how crafty, how bad,  does every long war make one, which cannot be waged openly by means  of force! How PERSONAL does a long fear make one, a long watching  of enemies, of possible enemies! These pariahs of society, these  long-pursued, badly-persecuted ones--also the compulsory recluses, the  Spinozas or Giordano Brunos--always become in the end, even under the  most intellectual masquerade, and perhaps without being themselves aware  of it, refined vengeance-seekers and poison-Brewers (just lay bare  the foundation of Spinoza's ethics and theology!), not to speak of  the stupidity of moral indignation, which is the unfailing sign in a  philosopher that the sense of philosophical humour has left him. The  martyrdom of the philosopher, his \"sacrifice for the sake of truth,\"  forces into the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks in him;  and if one has hitherto contemplated him only with artistic curiosity,  with regard to many a philosopher it is easy to understand the dangerous  desire to see him also in his deterioration (deteriorated into a  \"martyr,\" into a stage-and-tribune-bawler). Only, that it is necessary  with such a desire to be clear WHAT spectacle one will see in any  case--merely a satyric play, merely an epilogue farce, merely the  continued proof that the long, real tragedy IS AT AN END, supposing that  every philosophy has been a long tragedy in its origin.    26. Every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a privacy,  where he is FREE from the crowd, the many, the majority--where he may  forget \"men who are the rule,\" as their exception;--exclusive only of  the case in which he is pushed straight to such men by a still stronger  instinct, as a discerner in the great and exceptional sense. Whoever, in  intercourse with men, does not occasionally glisten in all the green  and grey colours of distress, owing to disgust, satiety, sympathy,  gloominess, and solitariness, is assuredly not a man of elevated tastes;  supposing, however, that he does not voluntarily take all this burden  and disgust upon himself, that he persistently avoids it, and remains,  as I said, quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel, one thing is then  certain: he was not made, he was not predestined for knowledge. For as  such, he would one day have to say to himself: \"The devil take my good  taste! but 'the rule' is more interesting than the exception--than  myself, the exception!\" And he would go DOWN, and above all, he would  go \"inside.\" The long and serious study of the AVERAGE man--and  consequently much disguise, self-overcoming, familiarity, and bad  intercourse (all intercourse is bad intercourse except with one's  equals):--that constitutes a necessary part of the life-history of every  philosopher; perhaps the most disagreeable, odious, and disappointing  part. If he is fortunate, however, as a favourite child of knowledge  should be, he will meet with suitable auxiliaries who will shorten and  lighten his task; I mean so-called cynics, those who simply recognize  the animal, the commonplace and \"the rule\" in themselves, and at the  same time have so much spirituality and ticklishness as to make them  talk of themselves and their like BEFORE WITNESSES--sometimes they  wallow, even in books, as on their own dung-hill. Cynicism is the only  form in which base souls approach what is called honesty; and the  higher man must open his ears to all the coarser or finer cynicism, and  congratulate himself when the clown becomes shameless right before  him, or the scientific satyr speaks out. There are even cases where  enchantment mixes with the disgust--namely, where by a freak of nature,  genius is bound to some such indiscreet billy-goat and ape, as in the  case of the Abbe Galiani, the profoundest, acutest, and perhaps also  filthiest man of his century--he was far profounder than Voltaire, and  consequently also, a good deal more silent. It happens more frequently,  as has been hinted, that a scientific head is placed on an ape's body, a  fine exceptional understanding in a base soul, an occurrence by no means  rare, especially among doctors and moral physiologists. And whenever  anyone speaks without bitterness, or rather quite innocently, of man  as a belly with two requirements, and a head with one; whenever any one  sees, seeks, and WANTS to see only hunger, sexual instinct, and vanity  as the real and only motives of human actions; in short, when any one  speaks \"badly\"--and not even \"ill\"--of man, then ought the lover of  knowledge to hearken attentively and diligently; he ought, in general,  to have an open ear wherever there is talk without indignation. For the  indignant man, and he who perpetually tears and lacerates himself with  his own teeth (or, in place of himself, the world, God, or society),  may indeed, morally speaking, stand higher than the laughing and  self-satisfied satyr, but in every other sense he is the more ordinary,  more indifferent, and less instructive case. And no one is such a LIAR  as the indignant man.    27. It is difficult to be"]]]
