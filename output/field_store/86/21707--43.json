I'm sure to get there if I follow this plan.\"    Half-way up the bank Spotty lost his balance, and the house he was  carrying just tipped him right over backward, and down he rolled to the  place he had started from.    \"I needed to cool off,\" said Spotty to himself and slid into a little  pool of water. Then he tried the bank again, and just as before he  slipped back two steps for every three he went up. But he shut his mouth  tight and kept at it, and by and by he was up to the place from which he  had tumbled. There he stopped to get his breath.     \"I can if I will, and will if I can!    I'm sure to get there if I follow this plan,\"    said he and started on again. Twice more he tumbled clear down to the  place he had started from, but each time he laughed at himself and tried  again. And at last he reached the top of the bank.    \"I said I could if I would, and I would if I could, and I have!\" he  cried.    Then he hurried to see what was behind the strange wall. What do you  think it was? Why, a pond! Yes, Sir, there was a pond right in the  middle of the Green Forest! Trees were coming up right out of the middle  of it, but it was a sure enough pond. Spotty found it harder work to  believe his own eyes now than when he had first seen the strange wall  across the Laughing Brook.    \"Why, why, why, what does it mean?\" exclaimed Spotty the Turtle.    \"That's what I want to know!\" cried Billy Mink, who came hurrying up  just then.        CHAPTER XVII: Who Had Made The Strange Pond?    Who had made the strange pond? That is what Spotty the Turtle wanted to  know. That is what Billy Mink wanted to know. So did Little Joe Otter  and Jerry Muskrat and Grandfather Frog, when they arrived. So did  Ol' Mistah Buzzard, looking down from the blue, blue sky. It was very  strange, very strange indeed! Never had there been a pond in that part  of the Green Forest before, not even in the days when Sister South Wind  melted the snow so fast that the Laughing Brook ran over its banks and  the Smiling Pool grew twice as large as it ought to be.    Of course some one had made it. Spotty the Turtle had known that as soon  as he had seen the strange pond. All in a flash he had understood what  that wall of logs and brush and mud across the Laughing Brook was for.  It was to stop the water from running down the Laughing Brook. And of  course, if the water couldn't keep on running and laughing on its way  to the Smiling Pool, it would just stand still and grow and grow into a  pond. Of course! There was nothing else for it to do. Spotty felt very  proud when he had thought that out all by himself.    \"This wall we are sitting on has made the pond,\" said Spotty the Turtle,  after a long time in which no one had spoken.    \"You don't say so!\" said Billy Mink. \"How ever, ever, did you guess it?  Are you sure, quite sure that the pond didn't make the wall?\"    Spotty knew that Billy Mink was making fun of him, but he is too  good-natured to lose his temper over a little thing like that. He  tried to think of something smart to say in reply, but Spotty is a slow  thinker as well as a slow walker, and before he could think of anything,  Billy was talking once more.    \"This wall is what Farmer Brown's boy calls a dam,\" said Billy Mink, who  is a great traveler. \"Dams are usually built to keep water from running  where it isn't wanted or to make it go where it is wanted. Now, what  I want to know is, who under the sun wants a pond way back here in  the Green Forest, and what is it for? Who do you think built this dam,  Grandfather Frog?\"    Grandfather Frog shook his head. His big goggly eyes seemed more goggly  than ever, as he stared at the new pond in the Green Forest.    \"I don't know,\" said Grandfather Frog. \"I don't know what to think.\"    \"Why, it must be Farmer Brown's boy or Farmer Brown himself,\" said Jerry  Muskrat.    \"Of course,\" said Little Joe Otter, just as if he knew all about it.    Still Grandfather Frog shook his head, as if he didn't agree. \"I don't  know,\" said Grandfather Frog, \"I don't know. It doesn't look so to me.\"    Billy Mink ran along the top of the dam and down the back side. He  looked it all over with those sharp little eyes of his.    \"Grandfather Frog is right,\" said he, when he came back. \"It doesn't  look like the work of Farmer Brown or Farmer Brown's boy. But if they  didn't do it, who did? Who could have done it?\"    \"I don't know,\" said Grandfather Frog again, in a dreamy sort of voice.    Spotty the Turtle looked at him, and saw that Grandfather Frog's face  wore the far-away look that it always does when he tells a story of  the days when the world was young. \"I don't know,\" he repeated, \"but it  looks to me very much like the work of--\" Grandfather Frog stopped short  off and turned to Jerry Muskrat. \"Jerry Muskrat,\" said he, so sharply  that Jerry nearly lost his balance in his surprise, \"has your big cousin  come down from the North?\"        CHAPTER XVIII: Jerry Muskrat's Big Cousin     Fiddle, faddle, feedle, fuddle!   Was there ever such a muddle?   Fuddle, feedle, faddle, fiddle!   Who is there will solve the riddle?    Here was the Laughing Brook laughing no longer. Here was the Smiling  Pool smiling no longer. Here was a brand new pond deep in the Green  Forest. Here was a wall of logs and bushes and mud called a dam, built  by some one whom nobody had seen. And here was Grandfather Frog asking  Jerry Muskrat if his big cousin had come down from the North, when Jerry  didn't even know that he had a big cousin.    \"I--I haven't any big cousin,\" said Jerry, when he had quite recovered  from his surprise at Grandfather Frog's question.    \"Chugarum!\" exclaimed Grandfather Frog, and the scornful way in which he  said it made Jerry Muskrat feel very small. \"Chugarum! Of course you've  got a big cousin in the North. Do you mean to tell me that you don't  know that, Jerry Muskrat?\"    Jerry had to admit that it was true that he didn't know anything about  that big cousin. If Grandfather Frog said that he had one, it must be  so, for Grandfather Frog is very old and very wise, and he knows a great  deal. Still, it was very hard for Jerry to believe that he had a big  cousin of whom he had never heard.    \"Did--did you ever see him, Grandfather Frog?\" Jerry asked.    \"No!\" snapped Grandfather Frog. \"I never did, but I know all about him.  He is a great worker, is this big cousin of yours, and he builds dams  like this one we are sitting on.\"    \"I don't believe it!\" cried Billy Mink. \"I don't believe any cousin of  Jerry Muskrat's ever built such a dam as this. Why, just look at that  great tree trunk at the bottom! No one but Farmer Brown or Farmer  Brown's boy could ever have dragged that there. You're crazy,  Grandfather Frog, just plain crazy.\" Billy Mink sometimes is very  disrespectful to Grandfather Frog.    \"Chugarum!\" replied Grandfather Frog. \"I'm pretty old, but I'm not too  old to learn as some folks seem to be,\" and he looked very hard at Billy  Mink. \"Did I say that that tree trunk was dragged here?\"    \"No,\" replied Billy Mink, \"but if it wasn't dragged here, how did it get  here? You are so smart, Grandfather Frog, tell me that!\"    Grandfather Frog blinked his great goggly eyes at Billy Mink as he said,  just as if he was very, very sorry for Billy, \"Your eyes are very bright  and very sharp, Billy Mink, and it is a great pity that you have never  learned how to use them. That tree wasn't dragged here; it was cut so  that it fell right where it lies.\" As he spoke, Grandfather Frog pointed  to the stump of the tree, and Billy Mink saw that he was right.    But Billy Mink is like a great many other people; he dearly loves to  have the last word. Now he suddenly began to laugh.    \"Ha, ha, ha! Ho, ho, ho!\" laughed Billy Mink. \"Ho, ho, ho! Ha, ha, ha!\"    \"What is it that is so funny?\" snapped Grandfather Frog, for nothing  makes him so angry as to be laughed at.    \"Do you mean to say that anybody but Farmer Brown or Farmer Brown's boy  could have cut down such a big tree as that?\" asked Billy. \"Why, that  would be as hard as to drag the tree here.\"    \"Jerry Muskrat's big cousin from the North could do it, and I believe he  did,\" replied Grandfather Frog. \"Now that we have found the cause of the  trouble in the Laughing Brook and the Smiling Pool, what are we going to  do about it?\"        CHAPTER XIX: Jerry Muskrat Has A Busy Day    There was the strange pond in the Green Forest, and there was the dam  of logs and sticks and mud which had made the strange pond, but look  as they would, Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter and Jerry Muskrat and  Grandfather Frog and Spotty the Turtle could see nothing of the one who  had built the dam. It was very queer. The more they thought about it,  the queerer it seemed. They looked this way, and they looked that way.    \"There is one thing very sure, and that is that whoever built this dam  had no thought for those who live in the Laughing Brook and the Smiling  Pool,\" said Grandfather Frog. \"They are selfish, just plain, every-day  selfish; that's what they are! Now the Laughing Brook cannot laugh,  and the Smiling Pool cannot smile, while this dam stops the water from  running, and so--\" Grandfather Frog stopped and looked around at his  four friends.    \"And so what?\" cried Billy Mink impatiently.    \"And so we must spoil this dam. We must make a place for the water to  run through,\" said Grandfather Frog very gravely.    \"Of course! That's the very thing!\" cried Little Joe Otter and Billy  Mink and Jerry Muskrat and Spotty the Turtle. Then Little Joe Otter  looked at Billy Mink, and Billy Mink looked at Jerry Muskrat, and Jerry  Muskrat looked at Spotty the Turtle, and after that they all looked very  hard at Grandfather Frog, and all together they asked: \"How are we going  to do it?\"    Grandfather Frog scratched his head thoughtfully and looked a long time  at the dam of logs and sticks and mud. Then his big mouth"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5113"],[0,"The Confessions of a Beachcomber (#6)"],[1,"under the  sloping hill with large patches of bush, a small stream of fresh water,  running out over the beach, furnished a supply for the ship, although the  boats could approach the place closely only at high-water. Among the  most interesting objects of natural history are two birds, one a new and  handsome fly-catcher (MONARCHA LEUCOTIS), the other a swallow, which Mr  Goold informs me is also an Indian species. Great numbers of butterflies  frequent the neighbourhood of the watering-place; one of these (PAPILIO  URVILLIANUS) is of great size, and splendour, with dark purple wings,  broadly margined with ultramarine, but from its habit of flying high  among the trees I did not succeed in catching one. An enormous spider,  beautifully variegated with black and gold, is plentiful in the woods,  watching for its prey in the centre of a large net stretched horizontally  between the trees. The seine was frequently hauled upon the beach with  great success. One evening through its means, in addition to plenty of  fish, no less than five kinds of star-fishes and twelve of crustacea,  several of which are quite new, were brought ashore. Among the plants of  the island the most important is a wild species of plantain or banana,  afterwards found to range along the north-east coast and its islands, as  far as Cape York. Here I saw for the first time a species of  Sciadophyllum (BRASSAIA ACTINOPHYLLA, the umbrella-tree) one of the most  singular trees of the eastern coast-line of tropical Australia; a slender  stem, about thirty feet in height, gives off a few branches with immense  digitate dark and glossy leaves, and long spike-like racemes of small  scarlet flowers, a great resort for insects and insect-feeding birds.  Soon after the ship had come to an anchor, some of the natives came off  in their canoes and paid us a visit, bringing with them a quantity of  shell-fish (SANGUINOLARIA RUGOSA), which they eagerly exchanged for  biscuit. For a few days afterwards we occasionally met them on the beach,  but at length they disappeared altogether, in consequence of having been  fired at with shot by one of two 'young gentlemen' of the BRAMBLE on a  shooting excursion, whom they wished to prevent approaching too closely a  small village where they had their wives and children. Immediate steps  were taken in consequence to prevent the recurrence of such collisions  when thoughtless curiosity on one side is apt to be promptly resented on  the other if numerically superior in force... The men had large  cicatrices on the shoulders and across the breast and belly, the septum  of the nose was perforated, and none of the teeth had been removed. I saw  no weapons, and some rude armlets were their only ornaments.\"    Tam o' Shanter Point derives its title from the barque of that name, in  which the members of the Kennedy Exploring Expedition voyaged from  Sydney, whence they disembarked on 24th and 25th May 1848. H.M.S.  RATTLESNAKE had been commissioned to lend Kennedy assistance, and  Macgillivray relates that everything belonging to the party (with the  exception of one horse drowned while swimming ashore) was safely landed.  The first camp was formed on some open forest-land behind the beach at a  small fresh-water creek. On the 27th Mr Carson, the botanist of the party,  commenced digging a piece of ground, in which he sowed seeds of cabbages,  turnips, leek, pumpkin, rock and water melons, pomegranate, peach-stones  and apple-pips. No trace of this first venture in gardening in North  Queensland is now discernible. No doubt, inquisitive and curious blacks  would rummage the freshly turned soil as soon as the back of the  good-natured gardener was turned. It occurred to me that possibly the  pomegranate seeds might have germinated, and the plants become  established and acclimatised, but search proved resultless. Carson makes  no reference to the coco-nut palm which once flourished at the mouth of  the creek. The inference is that the nut whence it sprang drifted ashore  after his attempt to civilise the vicinity by the planting of seeds.  Dalrymple refers to the tree which, at the date of his visit (September  1873), was \"about fourteen feet in height, but without fruit!\" It grew to  a great tree, and blacks found in the fruit a refreshing, nutritious  food; but an evil thing came along one day in the shape of a thirsty  Chinaman, and as he could not climb the tree he cut it down, and blacks,  even to this day, hate the name of Chinaman. Opposite the Point is the  Island of Timana, known to some as \"the Island on which the Chinaman was  killed!\" Whether \"the Chinaman\" was the person who cut down the coco-nut  palm is not known, but somehow his fate and that of the palm have become  associated.    The only traces of the expedition of half a century ago are marks upon  trees at the mouth of the Hull River--2 miles to the south, at the spot  which it appears to have crossed. The object of Kennedy's expedition was  to explore the country to the eastward of the dividing range running  along the north-east coast of Australia. Difficulties assailed them at  the outset, as many weeks passed before they got clear of Rockingham Bay,  its rivers, swamps, and dense scrubs fenced in by a mountain chain. The  cart was abandoned on July 18th and the horses were packed. An axle and  other ironwork of a cart was found many years ago in the neighbourhood of  the upper Murray River. As the axle was slotted for the old style of  linchpins, no reasonable doubt exists as to its identity, and its  discovery affords collateral proof of a statement published in Mr  Dalrymple's official report--\"It is noteworthy that several gins of the  Rockingham Bay tribe now in service in private families, and with the  native police are unanimous in their statements that an elderly white man  is still resident amongst them, and they associate his capture with  'white fellow leave him wheel-barrow along a scrub.' Kennedy abandoned his  horse-cart in the scrub of the Rockingham Bay Range before these gins  were born!\" Kennedy's expedition was a disastrous failure. The brave  leader was killed by the blacks far up Cape York Peninsula while he was  heroically pushing on to obtain succour for his famishing and weary  followers. Three only were subsequently rescued. All this has, perhaps,  little to do with Dunk Island: but the scene is so close at hand that the  temptation to include a slight reference to one of the most sensational  and romantic episodes in the exploration of Australia could not be  resisted.    Twenty-five years lapsed, and then another official landing took place.  In the meantime the island had been frequently visited, but there are no  records, until the 29th September 1873, when the \"Queensland North-East  Coast Expedition,\" under the leadership of Mr G. Elphinstone Dalrymple,  F.R.G.S., landed. Three members of the party have left pleasing  testimonies of their first impressions, and I turn to the remarks of the  leader for geological definitions. He says--\"The formation of Dunk Island  is clay slates and micaceous schist. A level stratum of a soft, greasy,  and very red decomposing granitic clay was exposed along the southwest  tide-flats, and quartz veins and blue slates were found on the same side  of the island further in!\" The huge granite boulders on the south-east  aspect and the granite escarpments on the shoulders of the hills above  did not apparently attract attention.    One feature then existent has also disappeared. The explorers referred to  the belt of magnificent calophyllum trees along the margin of the  south-west beach, and Mr Dalrymple thus describes a vegetable wonder--  \"Some large fig-trees sent out great lateral roots, large as their own  trunks, fifty feet into salt water; an anchor-root extending  perpendicularly at the extremity to support them. Thence they have sent  up another tree as large as the parent stem, at high-water presenting the  peculiarity of twin-trees, on shore and in the sea, connected by a  rustic root bridge.\" These trees have no place or part now.    My chronicles are fated to be tinged with the ashen hue of the  commonplace, though the scenes they attempt to depict are all of the  sun-blessed tropics.    SATELLITES AND NEIGHBOURS    Consultation of the map will show that Dunk Island has four satellites  and seven near relations. Though not formally included in the Family  Group it stands as sponsor to all its members, and overlords the islets  within a few yards of its superior shores. The official chart has been  revised,    Only a few examples of current titles are given, as the crowding in of  the full list would have obscured the map in a maze of words. Many of the  geographical titles of the blacks are without meaning, being used merely  to indicate a locality. Others were bestowed because of the presence of a  particular tree or plant or a remarkable rock. Some few commemorate  incidents. Two places on Dunk Island perpetuate the names of females. The  coast-line is so varied that specific names for localities a few hundred  yards apart hardly seem necessary; but the original inhabitants, frugal  of their speech, found it less trouble to strew names thickly than to  enter into explanations one to another when relating the direction and  extent which the adventures and the sport of the day led them. Few names  for any part of the island away from the beach seem to have existed,  although the site of camps along the edge of the jungle, and even in  gullies as remote as may be from the sea, are even now apparent. Camps  were not honoured by titles, but all the creeks and watercourses and other  places where water was obtainable were so invariably, and camps were  generally, though not always, made near water.    Brief reference to each of the satellites and neighbours of Dunk Island  may not be out of place; if only to preserve distinctions which were  current long before the advent of "]]]
