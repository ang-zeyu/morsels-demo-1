Joliet's discoveries were most joyfully received in France, Colbert  especially appreciating their value and importance both as regards the  extent and fertility of the countries traversed and also as to the easy  water communication therewith. It afforded an opportunity of extending  the limits of French possessions in America, which was not neglected. It  did not fall, however, to Joliet to play any part in this great work,  which was the lot of his great rival, the energetic, persistent, and  far-seeing La Salle, who received in 1678 a royal patent with seignorial  rights over all lands which he might discover and colonize within twenty  years, and who gave Louisiana to the French crown.    The natural despondency of Joliet over the loss of his maps and  journals soon gave way to happier experiences; for the following year,  October 7, 1675, he married Clare Frances Bissot. His father-in-law, a  Canadian, was a wealthy Indian trader, so Joliet naturally resumed his  former occupation, and in 1679 made a journey to Hudson Bay by way of  the Saguenay. He found the English strongly intrenched in their  successful efforts to monopolize the Indian trade of that quarter. The  usual attempts to draw Canadians into their service were made in  Joliet's case. He not only declined service, but on his return to Quebec  made such representations of the inevitable effect of English rivalry,  if unopposed, on the trade of Canada, that a competing company was  organized by French merchants.    Joliet in the meantime had only received fair words, but after strenuous  efforts he succeeded in 1679 in obtaining a grant of the Islands of  Mignan, and in the following year the French Government granted him the  Island of Anticosti, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Here he established  himself with his family, and with six servants engaged in fisheries.    In the course of time he added to his buildings and extended his  interests, but his peaceful pursuits were destined to interruption and  devastation. In 1690 an English fleet, under command of Sir William  Phipps, sailed to attack Quebec, and in course of time anchored at  Anticosti. In those days war was waged with utter disregard of the  rights of private property. Joliet was then absent. A detachment from  the English fleet landed on the island, devastated Joliet's  establishment, destroyed his buildings by fire, and even carried away as  prisoners his wife and mother-in-law, who fortunately were soon  exchanged.    Deprived in a day of the accumulation of years, his future actions  showed that age and adversity made but small inroads on his manly  spirit. Obliged to exertion for the support of his family, he turned  again in his fiftieth year to a voyage of exploration and adventure. A  Canadian company contemplated the extension of its seal and whale  fisheries to the rugged and dangerous coast of Labrador, then little  known, and in 1694 Joliet explored the greater part of this ice-covered  and rock-bound coast under the auspices and in the interest of this  company.    Some years earlier Joliet had shown his merits as a skilful surveyor and  navigator by charting the waters of the St. Lawrence, and when, on his  return from Labrador, occupation failed, Frontenac recognized his  deserving abilities by naming him for the post of royal pilot of the St.  Lawrence, still later appointing him hydrographer at Quebec.    The emoluments of his royal offices were a mere pittance, and in 1695 he  is found on Mignan Islands, where, with his wife, he contracted with his  brother-in-law Bissot and other parties with a view of developing his  interests both on land and at sea. In 1697 he was granted by the Crown  the Seignory of Joliet. This honor he did not long enjoy, for he died,  apparently a poor man, in 1699 or 1700. He was fortunate in his burial  place, one of the Mignan Islands, which is forever associated with his  fame, having been granted him by the French Crown for that great and  dangerous voyage which gave to the world its first definite knowledge of  the location, extent, and fertility of the great valley of the  Mississippi.    While Joliet followed the rugged and peaceful pursuits of his  island-home, ill fared it with his vigorous Norman successor. The great  La Salle fell under the hand of a mutinous follower, while his fated  Texan colony perished totally by desertion, betrayal, and massacre. So  relapsed the lower Mississippi into its primal savagery and grandeur,  until the domineering energy of the great Canadian, Iberville, awakened  it into a vast dominion, to the glory, if not to the profit, of France.    [Illustration]          II.    PETER LE MOYNE, SIEUR D'IBERVILLE,    FOUNDER OF LOUISIANA.      Among the very earliest settlers of Hochelega, now Montreal, was the son  of a Norman innkeeper, a young French lad of fifteen, Charles le Moyne,  who came to this Indian village in 1641. Apt, strong, daring, and  zealous, he soon became one of the most efficient aids to French power.  The language, the wood-craft, the arts of the savage soon became his,  and added to these such suavity of manner, clearness of perception, and  native kindness as made him loved equally by French and savage. As  interpreter, soldier, negotiator, and captain of the guard, he rendered  such great service to the young and exposed colony as caused him to be  made captain of Montreal, and later, in 1668, to be ennobled by Louis  XIV. under the title of Sieur of Longueuil. For four years service in  the country of the Hurons he received for his entire pay the sum of  twenty crowns and his clothing, but he gained also such a knowledge of  the possibilities of the country, such an insight into Indian character,  and such a wealth of vigorous manhood as enabled him to acquire during  his life an estate that was princely. He did better than this, he  married a woman worthy of him, whose family is scarcely known,  Catherine Tierry, an adopted daughter of Antoine Primot.    In all the history of American families there is none that has as  distinguished and brilliant a history as the twelve sons and two  daughters born of this French peasant and the son of a Norman innkeeper  in the forests of Canada. The two daughters married nobles, and of the  twelve sons nine live distinguished in history, three of them were  killed in the service of France, ten of them were ennobled, and four,  Iberville, Serigny, Chateauguay, and Bienville the younger, played  important parts in the founding of Louisiana.    [Illustration: Signature of le Moyne.]    There were many brilliant and picturesque figures among the actors in  the founding of a New France in the wilds of North America, but among  them all there was scarcely one whose personality and deeds excited more  admiration among his contemporaries, or whose services and career are  more deserving of recognition by posterity, than Peter le Moyne, Sieur  d'Iberville, third son of Longueuil, who was born on the extreme  frontier, at the outpost of Montreal, July 16, 1661. As a soldier he  rose to be the leader and idol of his fellow-Canadians; as a sailor he  became an extremely skilful navigator, who was acknowledged as one of  the greatest of French naval commanders; and as an explorer and  administrator he so successfully accomplished his plans as to merit and  receive the title of the Founder of Louisiana.    The freedom, vigor, and wildness of Canadian life developed men early,  and Iberville entered the French Navy as midshipman at the age of  fourteen. His first service of note, however, was as a soldier in the  wilds of his native land, in the Canadian overland campaign to recover  possession of an Indian trading post on Hudson Bay, which it was claimed  the English had illegally seized. Iberville volunteered for this  campaign under De Troye, and exhibited such judgment and vigor as caused  him to be put in command of a small party of nine, some say twelve, men  with two canoes, wherewith he did not hesitate to attack and compel the  unconditional surrender of an English ship manned by fourteen, including  the commander of Hudson Bay. St. Helene, his brother, meantime captured  another vessel, and with the two as means of transport, the two brothers  pushed on to Fort Quitchitchouen, which surrendered after withstanding a  sharp cannonade.    These victories not only insured to the French the command of the entire  southern part of Hudson Bay, but put them in possession of a vast amount  of stores. Indeed, so destructive to English interests were the  campaigns of Iberville in 1687-88, that the Hudson Bay Company declared  that their actual losses amounted to 108,520 pounds sterling, an  enormous sum in the young colonies of that day. The consequential losses  must have been very great, for we are told that the value of furs  obtained in the trade of one year amounted to 400,000 livres (francs).    Iberville remained in charge of the country which his valor had  recaptured, and in 1688, while the Iroquois were ravaging Canada, waged  successful war in Hudson Bay. One of his lieutenants, capturing an  English official, found on him an order from the London Company to  proclaim English sovereignty over the whole bay. Later two ships, with  twenty-eight cannon and eight swivels, appeared before St. Anne in order  to expel the French. Eventually Iberville compelled the surrender of the  English ships, and releasing the smaller vessel for the safe transport  of such prisoners as he paroled, himself navigated the larger ship, with  eleven Hudson Bay pilots held prisoners, to Quebec through Hudson  Strait.    In 1690 Iberville volunteered, under his brother St. Helene, for the  retaliatory expedition in mid-winter against Schenectady, wherein a  large number of the inhabitants of that unhappy town were ruthlessly  massacred by the French and their Indian allies.

From  the south, and indeed from all parts of the country, parties go more  and more every year to the Mammoth Cave, (of which we have in store a  particular and profusely illustrated account), and up the great rivers  and lakes of the west, all along which, first-class hotels,  steamboats, &c., render travel as easy and delightful as on the old  summer routes in the middle and eastern states.    --Thus we have taken our readers--some of whom haply cannot this  season go by other ways--the circuit of the principal scenes of  enjoyment to which the denizens of the hot cities are intent to escape  through July, August, and September.

[Illustration: MAMMOTH CAVE HOTEL.]          NOAH WEBSTER.    [Illustration]      The above portrait of the author of _The American Spelling-Book_, of  which there have been sold thirty millions of copies, and of the  _American Dictionary_, of which his publishers have hopes of selling  as great a number, is very life-like; it is from a painting by  Professor Morse, and the last time we saw the veteran scholar and  schoolmaster, he wore the very expression caught by that always  successful artist. Noah Webster's is the most universally familiar  name in our history; every body, from first to second childhood, from  end to end and side to side of the continent, knows it as well as his  own; and he who made it so famous was worthy of his reputation.    Noah Webster was born in Hartford, Connecticut, October 16th, 1758. He  was a descendant, in the fourth generation, of John Webster, one of  the first settlers of Hartford, and afterwards governor of the colony.  In 1774 he was admitted to Yale College. His studies were frequently  interrupted during the Revolution, and for a time he himself served as  a volunteer in the army, with his father and two brothers. He  graduated, with honor, in 1778, in the same class with Joel Barlow,  Oliver Wolcott, Uriah Tracy, and other distinguished men, and  immediately opened a school, residing meanwhile in the family of  Oliver Ellsworth, afterward chief justice of the United States. He  soon commenced the study of the law, and was admitted to the bar in  1781; but the poverty and unsettled state of the country prevented any  immediate success in the courts, and he resumed the business of  instruction in 1782, at Goshen, Orange county, New-York. It was here  that he began the preparation of books for the schools. He was led to  do so in despondency of success in his profession; but it changed the  course of his life. Having exhibited the rude sketch of his initial  effort to Mr. Madison (afterwards President), and Dr. Stanhope Smith,  Professor in Princeton college, he was encouraged by them to publish  the \"First Part of a Grammatical Institute of the English Language.\"  The second and third parts of the series soon followed. A generation  has not passed since some of these books were occasionally seen in New  England. It may be that here and there a copy may still be lurking in  the garret of some ancient family, or on the dusty shelves of a  collector of antiquities. There is no more striking contrast than that  suggested by a comparison of Webster's \"Third Part,\" as it was  familiarly styled, with the admirably printed school books now in  every family. Webster's were the first school books published in the  United States. In 1847 twenty-four million copies of the Spelling Book  had been sold, and for several years the demand for it has been at the  rate of a million a year.    Dr. Webster did not confine his attention to his own publications; but  having learned that a copy of Winthrop's Journal was in the  possession of Governor Trumbull, he caused it to be transcribed and  published at his own risk. In this way was given to the public one of  the most important memorials of our early history, and the first  example furnished of printing the documents, and other materials,  illustrative of our original experience. Mr. Webster was poor, and the  country had never yet evinced any disposition to encourage enterprises  of this sort; but he had always a confidence that it was safe to do  what was right and necessary, and therefore disregarded in this, as in  many other cases, the opinions of his friends that he would incur  inevitable loss.    The peace of 1783 involved the whole country in political agitation,  at certain points of which the calmest and wisest well nigh despaired  of the republic. At that time the influence of the pen was greater  than ever before. It seemed that the decision of principles which were  to last for centuries was dependent on the force of a single argument,  or the earnestness of one appeal. In this conflict the ambitious and  self-relying spirit of Mr. Webster led him to take an active part, and  from the peace till the close of Washington's administration, he was  an industrious and efficient writer. No period in the history of this  country was ever more critical; in none were so many principles  subjected to experiment, in none was discussion more able, exhausting,  and high-toned.    The first topic which engaged Mr. Webster's attention was the decision  of Congress to remunerate the army, then recently disbanded. This  measure was violently opposed in all parts of the country. Meetings  were held to organize resistance to the law, and two-thirds of the  towns of Connecticut were represented in a convention for this  purpose. Mr. Webster was then twenty-five years of age, but he  contributed to the leading paper of the state a series of essays,  signed HONORIUS, which induced a decisive change in the public  feeling; and he received for his important services the thanks of  Governor Trumbull. In the winter of 1784--5 he published a tract,  _Sketches of American Policy_, in which he advanced the doctrine, that  to meet the crisis and secure the prosperity of the whole country, a  government should be organized that would act, not upon the states,  but directly on the people, vesting in Congress full authority to  execute its own acts. A copy of this essay was presented by the author  to Washington, and it is believed that it contained the first distinct  proposal of the new constitution. About the same time, he exerted  himself successfully for what was then called an \"International  Copyright\" law between the several sovereign states; and at a later  period he spent a winter in Washington, to procure an extension of the  period for which a copyright might be enjoyed. In 1785, he prepared a  series of lectures on the English language, which he delivered in the  larger towns, and in 1789 published, under the title of _Dissertations  on the English Language_. In 1787-8, he spent the winter in  Philadelphia, as a teacher. The convention called to frame the new  constitution was in session during a part of the year, and after its  labors were completed, Mr. Webster undertook to recommend the result  to the then doubtful favor of the people. This he did in a tract,  entitled _An Examination of the Leading Principles of the Federal  Constitution_. In the next year he established in New-York _The  American Magazine_, but it was unsuccessful. In 1789 he opened a  law-office in Hartford, and his reputation, diligence, and abilities,  insured business and profits. He was now married to Miss Greenleaf, of  Boston, and enjoyed the advantage of one of the most brilliant  literary circles of the country, consisting of Joel Barlow, Lemuel  Hopkins, John Trumbull, and others who at that time were eminent for  their capacities.    But the political excitement of 1793, caused by the proclamation of  neutrality, disturbed his plans, and brought him again into the arena  of affairs. The sympathy for the new French republic, natural and  pardonable as it was, overran all limits of reason. The popularity and  influence of Washington were hardly sufficient for the repression of  disorder and violence, and an armed espousal of the cause of the  French. Mr. Webster was solicited to devote himself to the support of  the administration, and means were furnished for the establishment by  him of a daily paper in New-York. He accordingly commenced _The  Minerva_, and soon after, a semi-weekly, _The Herald_, which  ultimately received the names which they now retain, of _The  Commercial Advertiser_, and _The New-York Spectator_.    Another agitation soon followed, if possible, still more  alarming--that which grew out of Jay's Treaty with England. The  discussions to which this gave rise were earnest, often angry and  vituperative, but always able, enlisting the most accomplished men of  the country. In these discussions Mr. Webster was, as might have been  anticipated, remarkably active. A series of papers by him, under the  signature of CURTIUS, had an unquestionable influence on the whole  nation. They were extensively reprinted and afterwards collected in a  volume. Mr. Rufus King said to Mr. Jay, that they had done more than  any others to allay "]]]
