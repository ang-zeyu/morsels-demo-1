The suture between the nasals and frontals varies from  V-shaped to truncate to W-shaped. The maxillary part of the zygoma  varies from broad to slender in dorsoventral width in both species.      PELAGE AND MOLTS    There are three distinct pelages, juvenal, postjuvenal, and adult. The  sequences of molt and change of pelage from the juvenal, to the  postjuvenal, and from it to adult, are essentially as reported for  _Peromyscus_ by Collins (1918:78-81; 1924:58-60) and Hoffmeister  (1951:5). The juvenal pelage is uniformly dusky gray throughout except  for the paler gray on the venter. In most juvenal mice, the yellow to  ochraceous pigments of the subterminal bands are reduced or absent.  Unlike _Peromyscus_, _Baiomys_ has bright brownish hairs on the head as  the first evidence of the postjuvenal molt (see Figure 4, part a). Blair  (1941:381) reports adult pelage in pygmy mice being evident first at an  age of 46 days. Two of my juveniles born in captivity began the  postjuvenal molt on the 38th and 40th days. The area of new hairs on the  head spreads most rapidly posteriorly. New hair appears ventrally and  laterally at the end of 46 days (see Figure 4, part b). Hair replacement  proceeds more slowly after the \"saddle back\" stage (described in  _Peromyscus_ by Collins, 1918:80) has been reached. That stage was  reached in two pygmy mice at 52 days (see Figure 4, part c). Areas  immediately posterior to the ears, in the scapular region, molt last.  The postjuvenal pelage was seemingly complete in one captive pygmy mouse  at the end of 60 days. Another captive failed to complete its growth of  new pelage until two additional weeks had elapsed. Length of time  required to molt in pygmy mice is about the same as that reported by  Layne (1959:72) in _Reithrodontomys_.        [Illustration: FIG. 4. Diagrams showing progress of the postjuvenal         molt in pygmy mice. For explanation of a, b, and c, see text.         All approximately 2/3 natural size.]    If, after the postjuvenal molt, a distinct adult pelage is acquired it  is difficult to separate it from the annual replacement of pelage in  adults at the beginning of the rainy season. Adults of both species have  been found in molt in all months of the year. To the north, in Texas,  the pelage of winter-taken specimens is denser and slightly more reddish  than that of specimens taken in spring and summer. In the two last  mentioned seasons, the pelage is more uniformly gray. To the south, in  Mexico, the pelage is heavy and long in most specimens taken in the  rainy season. The percentage of specimens in molt immediately before the  rainy season and immediately before the dry season is slightly higher  than in specimens taken at other times of the year. The adult or  seasonal molt (both loss of old pelage and growth of new) resembles that  in _Peromyscus truei gilberti_, described by Hoffmeister (1951:6) as  proceeding \"posteriorly as a wave over the entire back.\" The new hair is  slightly brighter than the old. Old adults are usually in ragged pelage  regardless of season; possibly only one regular annual change of pelage  occurs in most animals before they die. Only one case of melanism was  observed among all the specimens of both species examined. It was a  young male _B. t. taylori_, KU 35943, from 6 mi. SW San Geronimo,  Coahuila, possessing black hairs throughout. Its hairs are longer and  finer than those on specimens of comparable age and sex. No albino was  found, although Stickel and Stickel (1949:145) record one--an adult male  of _B. taylori_.          TAXONOMIC CHARACTERS AND RELATIONSHIPS      _External parts._--Length of body, foot, ear, and tail are useful when  considered together in distinguishing species and subspecies. I found as  Hooper (1952a:91) did that length of ear in combination with length of  hind foot suffices to identify nearly all specimens to species,  especially where the two species occur together.    _Pelage._--Color in adults is of especial value in subspecific  determination; the manner in which it varies geographically is described  on pages 609, 630.    _Skull._--Difference in occipitonasal length and zygomatic breadth, both  having low coefficients of variation, are useful in separating species,  especially where they are sympatric. Shape of presphenoid, nasals,  interparietal, frontoparietal sutures, and length and degree of the  openings of the incisive foramina are useful in delimiting subspecies.  The rostrum of _B. taylori_, in front of the frontonasal suture, is  deflected three to five degrees ventrally in 85 per cent of the adults  examined, and in _B. musculus_ is less, or not at all, deflected.    _Teeth._--Alveolar length of the upper and lower molar tooth-rows aids  in distinguishing fossil and Recent species, and to a lesser degree in  delimiting subspecies. Occlusal pattern is useful in estimating the  relationship of fossil and living species. Degree of development of the  mesostyle, mesostylid, mesoloph, and mesolophid have been useful in  determining relationship between fossil and living species as well as  useful in separating the living species. Rinker (1954:119) and Hooper  (1957:48) have shown the degree of variation in dental patterns in  _Peromyscus_, _Sigmodon_, and _Oryzomys_, mice thought to be closely  related to _Baiomys_. In pygmy mice, however, the dental patterns are  relatively constant. The lophs and styles are subject to some geographic  variation but, nevertheless, are useful in estimating relationships.        [Illustration: FIG. 5. Ventral view of hyoid bones. x 18.        A. _Baiomys musculus brunneus_, adult, female, No. 30182 KU,         Potrero Viejo, 1700 feet, Veracruz.        B. _Baiomys taylori analogous_, adult, female, No. 36761 KU,         2 mi. N Ciudad Guzman, 5000 feet, Jalisco.]    _Hyoid apparatus._--Shape and, to a lesser extent, size of the hyoid  apparatus differentiate nearly all specimens of _B. taylori_ from all  those of _B. musculus_. The hyoid of _B. taylori_ differs from that of  _B. musculus_ principally in the shape of the basihyal. It possesses an  anteriorly pointed entoglossal process in _B. musculus_, and is not  rounded to completely absent as in _B. taylori_ (see Figure 5). The  shoulders of the basihyal protrude anteriorly in _B. musculus_, and are  not flattened as in _B. taylori_. The total length was measured in a  sample of 55 basihyals of _B. musculus_, and was compared to the total  length of a sample of 80 basihyals of _B. taylori_. The means of the two  samples differ significantly at the 95 per cent level; the mean plus two  standard errors of _B. musculus_ and _B. taylori_, are, respectively,  2.43 +- .02; 2.18 +- .03. There is sufficient overlap of the samples  (mean plus one standard deviation of _B. musculus_ and _B. taylori_,  respectively: 2.43 +- .15; 2.18 +- .15) to make the total length of the  basihyal of only secondary importance in distinguishing species, but  shape and total length of the basihyal, when considered together, serve  to identify all specimens to species. When length of the basihyal is  plotted against occipitonasal length (see Figure 6), all specimens  studied, regardless of age or geographical origin, were separated at the  level of species. The hypohyals of _B. taylori_ seemingly remain  distinct throughout life; those of _B. musculus_ completely fuse in some  adults. The ceratohyals are highly variable in shape and of little  taxonomic use.        [Illustration: FIG. 6. Relationship of length of basihyal to         occipitonasal length of skull. Black symbols, all below the curved         line, represent measurements of _B. taylori_; open symbols, all         above the curved line, represent measurements of _B. musculus_.]    The degree of geographic variation in shape of basihyal is not great.  Specimens of _B. musculus pallidus_ from 1 km. NW Chapa, Guerrero, have  a small indentation on the anteriormost part of the entoglossal process.  The shoulder of the basihyal is directed less forward in specimens of  _B. taylori taylori_ from 6 mi. N, 6 mi. W Altamira, Tamaulipas, than in  other specimens of the species. The variations observed seemed not to be  clinal.    According to White (1953:548) the hyoid, like the baculum (Burt,  1936:146), is little influenced by changes in external environment and  may serve to clarify intergeneric relationships. Hyoids of both species  of _Baiomys_ are smaller than hyoids of all subgenera of _Peromyscus_.  In shape, the hyoids of _Baiomys_ resemble those of _Ochrotomys  nuttalli_ (as explained on page 605, _Ochrotomys_ is here accorded  generic, instead of subgeneric, rank). In size, the hyoid of both  species of _Baiomys_ resembles that in _Reithrodontomys_. Sprague  (1941:304) reports a resemblance in shape between the ceratohyals of  _Baiomys_ and _Reithrodontomys_. The thyrohyals differ from those of  _Reithrodontomys_, being less boot-shaped, and having a slight terminal  expansion as in _Ochrotomys_ (see Sprague, _loc. cit._). In shape, the  large basihyal of _Onychomys_ resembles the smaller one of _B.  musculus_. The basihyal of _Oryzomys_ lacks the entoglossal process  present in _Baiomys_. On the basis of shape of hyoid, _Baiomys_ seems to  be most closely related to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38308"],[0,"Natural History of Cottonmouth Moccasin, Agkistrodon piscovorus (Reptilia) (#6)"],[1,"age of two years and ten months.  The size classes represented by gravid females found by Barbour  (1956:38) in Kentucky indicate that breeding occurs at least by the  third year.    The ovaries of female cottonmouths examined revealed ova in various  stages of development. In individuals less than 300 millimeters in  snout-vent length the ovaries are almost completely undeveloped; in  immature individuals from 300 to 450 millimeters in length the follicles  are from one to two millimeters in length; in post-post females  follicles vary in size, the largest being about seven millimeters.  Reproductive females also contain follicles of various sizes. One or two  sets are less than three millimeters in length, and large ova that soon  are to be ovulated are present. Ovarian ova found in April ranged in  length from 23 to 35 millimeters. No embryonic development was observed  in most individuals until June or later.

The reproductive cycle in cottonmouths resembles that illustrated by  Rahn (_op. cit._:237), in which the ovarian follicles of post-partum  females begin to enlarge in late summer and autumn, with ovulation  occurring the following spring. By means of retaining sperm successive  broods possibly are produced after only one mating. In captivity, at  least, some females may not follow this biennial cycle; Stanley Roth  (M.S.), biology teacher in high school at Lawrence, Kansas, had a female  of _A. p. piscivorus_, from Florida, that produced broods of 14 and 12  young in two consecutive years.    [Illustration: FIG. 4. Length of testes in cottonmouths of various  sizes (.--left; º--right). The right testis is always longer than  the left.]      Embryonic Development    After ova are fertilized a three and one-half to four-month period of  development begins which varies somewhat depending on the temperature.  In almost every instance the ova in the right uterus outnumber those in  the left. Embryos usually assume the serpentine form in the latter part  of June and are coiled in a counterclockwise spiral with the head on the  outside of the coil. At this time the head is relatively large and  birdlike in appearance with conspicuous protruding eyes. Sex is easily  noted because the hemipenes of males are everted. By late July scales  are well developed and the embryo is more snakelike in appearance, but  pigmentation is still absent. By mid-August the color and pattern are  well developed, the egg tooth is present, the snake shows a considerable  increase in size over that of the previous month, and much of the yolk  has been consumed. Some females that contain well developed embryos also  contain eggs that fail to develop. Sizes of ova vary irrespective of  size of female and stage of embryonic development. Lengths of ova ranged  from 22 to 51 millimeters in May to 35 to 49 millimeters in July and  August. A two-yolked egg was found in one female.      Birth of Young    Accounts in the literature of 15 litters of cottonmouths fix the time of  birth as August and September. Conant (1933:43) reported the birth of a  litter in mid-July by a female that had been raised in captivity, and  one female that I had kept in captivity for two months gave birth to a  litter between October 19 and October 25. The conditions of captivity  undoubtedly affected the time of birth in both instances.    Wharton (1960:125-126) reported the birth and behavior of a brood of  seven cottonmouths in Florida. I was given notes of a similar nature by  Richard S. Funk of Junction City, Kansas, on a brood of five  cottonmouths. The mother of the brood was caught in June, 1962, in  Tarrant County, Texas, by Richard E. Smith, and was 705 millimeters in  snout-vent length. The first young was found dead in an extended  position a few inches from the fetal membranes at 11:05 p.m. on August  22. The second young was born at 11:07 p.m. The intervals between the  successive births were three, seven, and four minutes; and time until  the sac was ruptured in each instance was six, five, eight, and 11  minutes. The time interval between the rupture of the sac and emergence  of each individual was 41, 92, 154, and 34 minutes. The mother's actions  in giving birth to the last four young were essentially as described by  Wharton (_loc. cit._), except that the intervals between successive  births did not increase. Within one minute after rupturing the sac and  while its head was protruding, each of the four living young opened its  mouth widely from three to seven times, then took its first breath.  Breaths for the first three hours were steady at three or four per  minute but then decreased to two or three per minute. Pulse rate for the  four averaged 38 per minute while at rest but increased to 44 per minute  after voluntarily crawling.      Number of Young per Litter    Records of from one to 16 young per litter have been reported (Ditmars,  1945:330; Clark, 1949:259), but the average is probably between six or  seven. Most accounts in the literature present information on number of  ova or embryos per female rather than the number of young. Size and age  of the mother (Table 9) influence the number of ova produced. Allen and  Swindell (1948:11) recorded three to 12 embryos in 31 cottonmouths  varying in total length from 26 to 44 inches. An average of 6.5 embryos  per female was found.         TABLE 9.--Number of Ova Produced by Fecund Cottonmouths.      ====================+============+======================      Snout-vent length |  Number    |    Number of ova,       in millimeters   | in sample  | average and extremes    --------------------+------------+----------------------           450-549      |     10     |     4.1 (2 to 7)           550-649      |     11     |     4.9 (1 to 8)           650-749      |      4     |     6.3 (4 to 8)           750-849      |      1     |          5           850-949      |      1     |         14    --------------------------------------------------------    Mortality at birth has been recorded for almost every litter born in  captivity (see Allen and Swindell, _loc. cit._; Conant, 1933:43;  Wharton, 1960:125). A female that I kept in captivity gave birth to  seven young. Three never ruptured their sacs, and another died soon  after leaving the sac. The effects of captivity on females may result in  higher rates of deformity and mortality in young than is common in  nature. Klauber (1956:699-700) estimated that the defects brought about  by conditions of captivity on rattlesnakes eliminate about three young  per litter.      Population Composition    No investigator has yet analyzed the composition of a population of  cottonmouths according to age, sex and snout-vent length. Barbour  (1956:35) did sort 167 snakes into size classes, but did not determine  sex ratio, size at sexual maturity, reproductive cycles, or snout-vent  length. He recorded total lengths from which snout-vent lengths cannot  be computed because of differential growth rates and different bodily  proportions of the two sexes. I judge from my findings that he included  immature individuals in his three smallest size classes (45.5 per cent  of the population). I found at least 32.5 per cent immature individuals  (Fig. 5) in my material, but it was not a natural population.    The sex ratios of several small collections from natural populations  varied, and no conclusions could be drawn. Females comprised 53 per cent  of the specimens included in Fig. 5 and in a group of 48 embryos which  represented eight broods. That percentage may not be the percentage in a  natural population but is used in making assumptions because I lack  better information.      Reproductive Potential    If data in Fig. 5 are representative of a natural population and if 61  per cent of the females are sexually mature, the reproductive potential  can be estimated as follows: assuming a cohort of 1000 cottonmouths  contains 530 females, 61 per cent of the females (323 individuals)  probably are adults. If 42 per cent of these females produce 6.5 young  per female in any season (Tables 8 and 9), 136 females will produce 884  young. But if 50 per cent of the adult females are reproductive (as  would be assumed if reproduction is biennial), 1050 young will be  produced. Actually the number of young required per year to sustain a  population is unknown, because mortality rates at any age are unknown.    [Illustration: FIG. 5. Composition of a group of cottonmouths examined  in this study. Individuals less than 450 millimeters in snout-vent  length are considered as immature. Specimens from 200 to 249 millimeters  in length are included in the 200-millimeter class, _etc._]          GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT    Size at Birth and Early Growth      Size at birth depends on the health of the mother. According to Fitch  (1960:182), many litters of copperheads born in captivity are stunted.  Seven young cottonmouths (two males and five females) born in captivity  were each 185 millimeters in snout-vent length"]]]
