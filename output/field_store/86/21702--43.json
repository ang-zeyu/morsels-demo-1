[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5039"],[0,"State of the Union Addresses (#6)"],[1," have already made recommendations to the Congress as to the procedure  best adapted to meeting the threat of work stoppages in Nation-wide  industries without sacrificing the fundamental rights of labor to bargain  collectively and ultimately to strike in support of their position.    If we manage our economy properly, the future will see us on a level of  production half again as high as anything we have ever accomplished in  peacetime. Business can in the future pay higher wages and sell for lower  prices than ever before. This is not true now for all companies, nor will  it ever be true for all, but for business generally it is true.    We are relying on all concerned to develop, through collective bargaining,  wage structures that are fair to labor, allow for necessary business  incentives, and conform with a policy designed to \"hold the line\" on  prices.    Production and more production was the byword during the war and still is  during the transition from war to peace. However, when deferred demand  slackens, we shall once again face the deflationary dangers which beset  this and other countries during the 1930's. Prosperity can be assured only  by a high level of demand supported by high current income; it cannot be  sustained by deferred needs and use of accumulated savings.    If we take the right steps in time we can certainly avoid the disastrous  excesses of runaway booms and headlong depressions. We must not let a year  or two of prosperity lull us into a false feeling of security and a  repetition of the mistakes of the 1920's that culminated in the crash of  1929.    During the year ahead the Government will be called upon to act in many  important fields of economic policy from taxation and foreign trade to  social security and housing. In every case there will be alternatives. We  must choose the alternatives which will best measure up to our need for  maintaining production and employment in the future. We must never lose  sight of our long-term objectives: the broadening of markets--the  maintenance of steadily rising demand. This demand can come from only three  sources: consumers, businesses, or government.    In this country the job of production and distribution is in the hands of  businessmen, farmers, workers, and professional people-in the hands of our  citizens. We want to keep it that way. However, it is the Government's  responsibility to help business, labor, and farmers do their jobs.    There is no question in my mind that the Government, acting on behalf of  all the people, must assume the ultimate responsibility for the economic  health of the Nation. There is no other agency that can. No other  organization has the scope or the authority, nor is any other agency  accountable, to all the people. This does not mean that the Government has  the sole responsibility, nor that it can do the job alone, nor that it can  do the job directly.    All of the policies of the Federal Government must be geared to the  objective of sustained full production and full employment-to raise  consumer purchasing power and to encourage business investment. The  programs we adopt this year and from now on will determine our ability to  achieve our objectives. We must continue to pay particular attention to our  fiscal, monetary, and tax policy, programs to aid business--especially  small business--and transportation, labor-management relations and  wage-price policy, social security and health, education, the farm program,  public works, housing and resource development, and economic foreign  policy.    For example, the kinds of tax measures we have at different times--whether  we raise our revenue in a way to encourage consumer spending and business  investment or to discourage it--have a vital bearing on this question. It  is affected also by regulations on consumer credit and by the money market,  which is strongly influenced by the rate of interest on Government  securities. It is affected by almost every step we take.    In short, the way we handle the proper functions of government, the way we  time the exercise of our traditional and legitimate governmental functions,  has a vital bearing on the economic health of the Nation.    These policies are discussed in greater detail in the accompanying Fifth  Quarterly Report of the Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion.    3. LEGISLATION HERETOFORE RECOMMENDED    AND STILL PENDING    To attain some of these objectives and to meet the other needs of the  United States in the reconversion and postwar period, I have from time to  time made various recommendations to the Congress.    In making these recommendations I have indicated the reasons why I deemed  them essential for progress at home and abroad. A few--a very few--of these  recommendations have been enacted into law by the Congress. Most of them  have not. I here reiterate some of them, and discuss others later in this  Message. I urge upon the Congress early consideration of them. Some are  more urgent than others, but all are necessary.    (1) Legislation to authorize the President to create fact-finding boards  for the prevention of stoppages of work in Nationwide industries after  collective bargaining and conciliation and voluntary arbitration have  failed--as recommended by me on December 3, 1945.    (2) Enactment of a satisfactory full employment bill such as the Senate  bill now in conference between the Senate and the House--as recommended by  me on September 6, 1945.    (3) Legislation to supplement the unemployment insurance benefits for  unemployed workers now provided by the different States--as recommended by  me on May 1945.    (4) Adoption of a permanent Fair Employment Practice Act--as recommended by  me on September 6, 1945.    (5) Legislation substantially raising the amount of minimum wages now  provided by law--as recommended by me on September 6, 1945.    (6) Legislation providing for a comprehensive program for scientific  research--as recommended by me on September 6, 1945.    (7) Legislation enacting a health and medical care program--as recommended  by me on November 19, 1945.    (8) Legislation adopting the program of universal training--as recommended  by me on October 23, 1945.    (9) Legislation providing an adequate salary scale for all Government  employees in all branches of the Government--as recommended by me on  September 6, 1945.    (10) Legislation making provision for succession to the Presidency in the  event of the death or incapacity or disqualification of the President and  Vice President--as recommended by me on June 19, 1945.    (11) Legislation for the unification of the armed services--as recommended  by me on December 19, 1945.    (12) Legislation for the domestic use and control of atomic energy--as  recommended by me on October 3, 1945.    (13) Retention of the United States Employment Service in the Federal  Government for a period at least up to June 30, 1947--as recommended by me  on September 6, 1945.    (14) Legislation to increase unemployment allowances for veterans in line  with increases for civilians--as recommended by me on September 6, 1945.    (15) Social security coverage for veterans for their period of military  service--as recommended by me on September 6, 1945.    (16) Extension of crop insurance--as recommended by me on September 6,  1945.    (17) Legislation permitting the sale of ships by the Maritime Commission at  home and abroad--as recommended by me on September 6, 1945. I further  recommend that this legislation include adequate authority for chartering  vessels both here and abroad.    (18) Legislation to take care of the stock piling of materials in which the  United States is naturally deficient--as recommended by me on September 6,  1945.    (19) Enactment of Federal airport legislation-as recommended by me on  September 6, 1945.    (20) Legislation repealing the Johnson Act on foreign loans--as recommended  by me on September 6, 1945.    (21) Legislation for the development of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River  Basin-as recommended by me on October 3, 1945.    4. POLICIES IN SPECIFIC FIELDS    (a) Extension of Price Control Act.    Today inflation is our greatest immediate domestic problem. So far the  fight against inflation has been waged successfully. Since May 1943,  following President Roosevelt's \"hold the line\" order and in the face of  the greatest pressures which this country has ever seen, the cost of living  index has risen only three percent. Wholesale prices in this same period  have been held to an increase of two and one-half percent.    This record has been made possible by the vigorous efforts of the agencies  responsible for this program. But their efforts would have been fruitless  if they had not had the solid support of the great masses of our people.  The Congress is to be congratulated for its role in providing the  legislation under which this work has been carried out.    On VJ-day it was clear to all thinking people that the danger of inflation  was by no means over. Many of us can remember vividly our disastrous  experience following World War I. Then the very restricted wartime controls  were lifted too quickly, and as a result prices and rents moved more  rapidly upward. In the year and a half following the armistice, rents,  food, and clothing shot to higher and still higher levels.    When the inevitable crash occurred less than two years after the end of the  war, business bankruptcies were widespread. Profits were wiped out.  Inventory losses amounted to billions of dollars. Farm income dropped by  one-half. Factory pay rolls dropped 40 percent, and nearly one-fifth of all  our industrial workers were walking the streets in search of jobs. This was  a grim greeting, indeed, to offer our veterans who had just returned from  overseas.    When I addressed the Congress in September, I emphasized that we must  continue to hold the price line until the production of goods"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50535"],[0,"Blood Atonement and the Origin of Plural Marriage: A Discussion (#6)"],[1,"their revelations is  the man BRIGHAM YOUNG,\" (page 190).    \"Brigham has outraged decency and driven asunder the most sacred ties,  by his shameless introduction of polygamy,\" (page 273).    \"There have been many apostates from the teachings of Joseph Smith in  early days, but of all apostates, Bro. Brigham is the chief,\" (page  614).    It is reported by Fanny Stenhouse, and many others, that Joseph Smith  said, \"If ever the Church had the misfortune to be led by Bro. Brigham,  he would lead it to hell,\" (page 268).    Why did Joseph Smith a short time prior to his death make the above  and similar statements regarding the man Brigham Young? The reason is  plain. He too had doubtless heard some rumors as to his conduct and  secret teachings, and the evidence would seem to indicate that just  before his death he made a move to bring the guilty to judgment. We  will let William Marks, who was president of the Nauvoo Stake at the  time of Joseph Smith's death testify:    \"A few days after this occurrence, I met with Bro. Joseph, he said  that he wanted to converse with me on the affairs of the Church, and  we retired by ourselves; I will give his words _verbatim_ for they are  indelibly stamped upon my mind. He said he had desired for a long time  to have a talk with me on the subject of polygamy. He said it would  eventually prove the overthrow of the Church, and we should soon be  obliged to leave the United States, unless it could be speedily put  down. He was satisfied that it was a cursed doctrine, and that there  must be every exertion to put it down. He said that he would go before  the congregation and proclaim against it, and I must go into the High  Council, and he would prefer charges against those in transgression,  and I must sever them from the Church unless they made ample  satisfaction. There was much more said, but this was the substance. The  mob commenced to gather about Carthage in a few days after, therefore  there was nothing done concerning it.\" (_Saints' Herald_, vol. 1, pp.  22, 23.)    President Marks, after Joseph Smith's death, made mention of the above  conversation; it was soon rumored that he was about to apostatize, and  that his statement was a tissue of lies.\" (See _Saints' Herald_, vol.  1, pp. 22, 23.)    Speaking of the revelation on polygamy, Marks said, \"I never heard of  it during Joseph's life. It was evidently gotten up by Brigham Young  and some of the Twelve, after Joseph's death.\" (Briggs' Autobiography;  _Herald_ 1901.)    Now I propose to produce evidence showing that Joseph Smith and the  Church during his lifetime condemned polygamy in the strongest terms.  First, I submit the testimony of thirty-one witnesses as published by  the Church on October the 1st, 1842. We deem this sufficient to show  you where Joseph and Hyrum Smith stood on this question of polygamy.    \"We, the undersigned members of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints, and residents of the city of Nauvoo, persons of  families, do hereby certify and declare, that we know of no other  rule or system of marriage than the one published from the Book of  Covenants, and we give this certificate to show that Dr. John C.  Bennett's secret wife system is a creature of his own make, as we know  of no such society in this place, nor never did.\"    This is signed by a number of the leading men of the Church, some of  the Twelve Apostles, some of the First Presidency of the Utah Church,  and a number of the leading men of the Church. A similar document is  signed by Emma Smith the wife of Joseph Smith, and a number of the  leading women of the Church, thirty-one witnesses in all.    Now I submit for your consideration a statement made by Joseph Smith  and his Brother Hyrum just a few months prior to their assassination.  They learned that a man up here in the state of Michigan was teaching  polygamy, and this is what they said about it: \"As we have lately  been credibly informed that a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints, a man by the name of Hyrum Brown, has been teaching  polygamy and other false and corrupt doctrines, in the county of  Lapeer, state of Michigan, this is to notify him and the Church in  general that he has been cut off from the Church for his iniquity.\"  Signed, Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, Presidents of the Church.    This was given in February, 1844. Joseph was killed four months after  that. Here he declares that polygamy is a crime, and the man was  excommunicated from the Church for preaching it. Now I want to give  you the testimony of George Q. Cannon, whom I met in Salt Lake City,  as one of the presidency of the Salt Lake Mormon Church: \"A prevalent  idea has been that this prejudice against us owes its origin and  continuation to our belief in a plurality of wives. * * * Joseph and  Hyrum Smith were slain in the Carthage Jail, and hundreds of persons  were persecuted to death previous to the Church having any knowledge of  this doctrine.\"--_Journal of Discourses_, vol. 14, pages 165, 166.[4]    This being true, Joseph Smith was not guilty of the practice of  polygamy; he was killed before the people knew anything about polygamy.  This is the statement of George Q. Cannon. Let me strengthen this now  by the son-in-law of Brigham Young, H. B. Clawson:    \"Polygamy at that time (that is at the time of Joseph Smith's death)  was not known among those of the Mormon faith. * * * The doctrine of  polygamy was not promulgated until they got to Salt Lake; not, in  fact, until some little time after they had arrived there.\" Salt Lake  _Herald_, February 9, 1882.[5]    Joseph Smith was killed in 1844. They arrived in Salt Lake the 24th of  July, 1847, and he says not until some little time after that was it  introduced. The little time was the 29th of August, 1852, eight years  and two months after the assassination of Joseph Smith.    We have Brigham Young himself on this. He being interviewed by  Senator Trumbull in 1869, said: \"It (polygamy) was adopted by us as a  _necessity_ after we came here.\" Ah, there never was a greater truth  told in all the world than that. Polygamy was not an original tenet  of the Church, and Brigham Young says it was adopted as a _necessity_  after \"we came here.\" The real facts are, Brigham Young, as I will show  from their own evidence, and a few other Elders were living vile lives  secretly, and to cover up the consequences of their bad conduct, as he  truthfully says in this \"as a necessity\"; yea, as a necessity polygamy  was introduced. But who will dare to blame Joseph Smith for their  introducing polygamy eight years after his death?    I have been careful to take these clippings right from their own  papers, so that they cannot say that we have changed the words or  anything of that kind. Here is another statement; this is found from  Elder Ephraim Jenson:    \"Polygamy was not practiced by the Mormons prior to and at the time of  the execution of Joseph Smith, who was executed at Nauvoo, Illinois.  * * * Fourth, that only three per cent of the Mormon men practiced  polygamy, a proof itself that it was not essential to the creed.\"--_The  Yeoman's Shield._    Here is another one:        \"Go back to the foundation of our Church, April 6, 1830, there was no      polygamy practiced or taught in Mormon literature until five years      after that band of persecuted Saints reached Utah.\" _New York Herald_,      January 8, 1900.[6]    This is by Elder Whitaker, who knew who _did_ introduce this polygamy.  Now I might introduce dozens and dozens of witnesses to prove that  Joseph Smith had nothing to do with it. Well, who did it? Here is  what the Apostle's wife says of it: \"How then, asked the reader, did  polygamy originate? It was born in the vile and lustful brain of  Brigham Young, and was grafted on the faith to gratify his sensual  bestiality.\"[7] (Mysteries of Mormonism, pp. 16, 17.)    One of the Mormon wives said that, and she ought to know whereof she  affirms.    We have learned from the above statements that polygamy was not taught  or practiced by Joseph Smith, but was introduced into an apostate  branch of the church, after his death, as is admitted by Brigham Young  and others of his followers.    Having read the works of the church for over a quarter of a century. I  confidently affirm that there is not a single word, in a single sermon,  lecture, statement, newspaper or church publication printed during the  lifetime of the Prophet Joseph Smith wherever he, by word, has endorsed  the doctrine of plurality of wives; not a single statement; and there  is no Salt Lake Mormon breathing who can produce one and prove its  authenticity.    But suppose you could prove that Joseph Smith secretly taught and  practiced polygamy, that would not make it a Christian doctrine. If  Joseph Smith secretly taught, practiced, or endorsed the doctrine of  polygamy, he did it contrary to all the revelations given for the  government of the church in the Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and  Covenants; contrary to all his sermons, speeches, and public teachings;  and he was a criminal before the law of his country, a base hypocrite  before the God whom he openly worshiped, a despicable traitor to the  woman whom he claimed to love and cherish as his wife, and was untrue  to all the sacred principles of fidelity and integrity which he evinced  in all his public utterances and conduct.    In the face of all this, the wife and children of Joseph Smith,  together with thousands of people who knew him in life, refuse to  believe the contradictory statements of Brigham Young and others who  are wallowing in the mire of polygamy.      MY VISIT TO UTAH    If your father denies that he and I discussed the doctrine of polygamy,  all I have to say about it is, that what he states is untrue. Here are  a few points that may help him to remember what was said and done:  When talking with Joseph F. Smith in Salt Lake City two years ago,  he"]]]
