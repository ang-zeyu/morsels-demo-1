George  Eliot's dictum that we are, each one of us, but an omnibus carrying down  the traits of our ancestors, does not appear at all to hold here.  This  fanciful realist, this naive-wistful humorist, this dreamy mystical  casuist, crossed by the innocent bohemian, this serious and genial  essayist, in whom the deep thought was hidden by the gracious play of wit  and phantasy, came, on the father's side, of a stock of what the world  regarded as a quiet, ingenious, demure, practical, home-keeping people.  In his rich colour, originality, and graceful air, it is almost as though  the bloom of japonica came on a rich old orchard apple-tree, all out of  season too.  Those who go hard on heredity would say, perhaps, that he  was the result of some strange back-stroke.  But, on closer examination,  we need not go so far.  His grandfather, Robert Stevenson, the great  lighthouse-builder, the man who reared the iron-bound pillar on the  destructive Bell Rock, and set life-saving lights there, was very intent  on his professional work, yet he had his ideal, and romantic, and  adventurous side.  In the delightful sketch which his famous grandson  gave of him, does he not tell of the joy Robert Stevenson had on the  annual voyage in the _Lighthouse Yacht_--how it was looked forward to,  yearned for, and how, when he had Walter Scott on board, his fund of  story and reminiscence all through the tour never failed--how Scott drew  upon it in _The Pirate_ and the notes to _The Pirate_, and with what  pride Robert Stevenson preserved the lines Scott wrote in the lighthouse  album at the Bell Rock on that occasion:       \"PHAROS LOQUITUR       \"Far in the bosom of the deep     O'er these wild shelves my watch I keep,     A ruddy gem of changeful light     Bound on the dusky brow of night.     The seaman bids my lustre hail,     And scorns to strike his timorous sail.\"    And how in 1850 the old man, drawing nigh unto death, was with the utmost  difficulty dissuaded from going the voyage once more, and was found  furtively in his room packing his portmanteau in spite of the protests of  all his family, and would have gone but for the utter weakness of death.    His father was also a splendid engineer; was full of invention and  devoted to his profession, but he, too, was not without his romances, and  even vagaries.  He loved a story, was a fine teller of stories, used to  sit at night and spin the most wondrous yarns, a man of much reserve, yet  also of much power in discourse, with an aptness and felicity in the use  of phrases--so much so, as his son tells, that on his deathbed, when his  power of speech was passing from him, and he couldn't articulate the  right word, he was silent rather than use the wrong one.  I shall never  forget how in these early morning walks at Braemar, finding me  sympathetic, he unbent with the air of a man who had unexpectedly found  something he had sought, and was fairly confidential.    On the mother's side our author came of ministers.  His maternal  grandfather, the Rev. Dr Balfour of Colinton, was a man of handsome  presence, tall, venerable-looking, and not without a mingled authority  and humour of his own--no very great preacher, I have heard, but would  sometimes bring a smile to the faces of his hearers by very naive and  original ways of putting things.  R. L. Stevenson quaintly tells a story  of how his grandfather when he had physic to take, and was indulged in a  sweet afterwards, yet would not allow the child to have a sweet because  he had not had the physic.  A veritable Calvinist in daily action--from  him, no doubt, our subject drew much of his interest in certain  directions--John Knox, Scottish history, the '15 and the '45, and no  doubt much that justifies the line \"something of shorter-catechist,\" as  applied by Henley to Stevenson among very contrasted traits indeed.    But strange truly are the interblendings of race, and the way in which  traits of ancestors reappear, modifying and transforming each other.  The  gardener knows what can be done by grafts and buddings; but more  wonderful far than anything there, are the mysterious blendings and  outbursts of what is old and forgotten, along with what is wholly new and  strange, and all going to produce often what we call sometimes  eccentricity, and sometimes originality and genius.    Mr J. F. George, in _Scottish Notes and Queries_, wrote as follows on  Stevenson's inheritances and indebtedness to certain of his ancestors:       \"About 1650, James Balfour, one of the Principal Clerks of the Court     of Session, married Bridget, daughter of Chalmers of Balbaithan,     Keithhall, and that estate was for some time in the name of Balfour.     His son, James Balfour of Balbaithan, Merchant and Magistrate of     Edinburgh, paid poll-tax in 1696, but by 1699 the land had been sold.     This was probably due to the fact that Balfour was one of the     Governors of the Darien Company.  His grandson, James Balfour of     Pilrig (1705-1795), sometime Professor of Moral Philosophy in     Edinburgh University, whose portrait is sketched in _Catriona_, also     made a Garioch [Aberdeenshire district] marriage, his wife being     Cecilia, fifth daughter of Sir John Elphinstone, second baronet of     Logie (Elphinstone) and Sheriff of Aberdeen, by Mary, daughter of Sir     Gilbert Elliot, first baronet of Minto.       \"Referring to the Minto descent, Stevenson claims to have 'shaken a     spear in the Debatable Land and shouted the slogan of the Elliots.'  He     evidently knew little or nothing of his relations on the Elphinstone     side.  The Logie Elphinstones were a cadet branch of Glack, an estate     acquired by Nicholas Elphinstone in 1499.  William Elphinstone, a     younger son of James of Glack, and Elizabeth Wood of Bonnyton, married     Margaret Forbes, and was father of Sir James Elphinstone, Bart., of     Logie, so created in 1701. . . .       \"Stevenson would have been delighted to acknowledge his relationship,     remote though it was, to 'the Wolf of Badenoch,' who burned Elgin     Cathedral without the Earl of Kildare's excuse that he thought the     Bishop was in it; and to the Wolf's son, the Victor of Harlaw [and] to     his nephew 'John O'Coull,' Constable of France. . . . Also among     Tusitala's kin may be noted, in addition to the later Gordons of     Gight, the Tiger Earl of Crawford, familiarly known as 'Earl Beardie,'     the 'Wicked Master' of the same line, who was fatally stabbed by a     Dundee cobbler 'for taking a stoup of drink from him'; Lady Jean     Lindsay, who ran away with 'a common jockey with the horn,' and     latterly became a beggar; David Lindsay, the last Laird of Edzell [a     lichtsome Lindsay fallen on evil days], who ended his days as hostler     at a Kirkwall inn, and 'Mussel Mou'ed Charlie,' the Jacobite ballad-     singer.       \"Stevenson always believed that he had a strong spiritual affinity to     Robert Fergusson.  It is more than probable that there was a distant     maternal affinity as well.  Margaret Forbes, the mother of Sir James     Elphinstone, the purchaser of Logie, has not been identified, but it     is probable she was of the branch of the Tolquhon Forbeses who     previously owned Logie.  Fergusson's mother, Elizabeth Forbes, was the     daughter of a Kildrummy tacksman, who by constant tradition is stated     to have been of the house of Tolquhon.  It would certainly be     interesting if this suggested connection could be proved.\" {5}       \"From his Highland ancestors,\" says the _Quarterly Review_, \"Louis     drew the strain of Celtic melancholy with all its perils and     possibilities, and its kinship, to the mood of day-dreaming, which has     flung over so many of his pages now the vivid light wherein figures     imagined grew as real as flesh and blood, and yet, again, the ghostly,     strange, lonesome, and stinging mist under whose spell we see the     world bewitched, and every object quickens with a throb of infectious     terror.\"    Here, as in many other cases, we see how the traits of ancestry reappear  and transform other strains, strangely the more remote often being the  strongest and most persistent and wonderful.    \"It is through his father, strange as it may seem,\" says Mr Baildon,  \"that Stevenson gets the Celtic elements so marked in his person,  character, and genius; for his father's pedigree runs back to the  Highland clan Macgregor, the kin of Rob Roy.  Stevenson thus drew in  Celtic strains from both sides--from the Balfours and the Stevensons  alike--and in his strange, dreamy, beautiful, and often far-removed  fancies we have the finest and most effective witness of it.\"    Mr William Archer, in his own characteristic way, has brought the  inheritances from the two sides of the house into more direct contact and  contrast in an article he wrote in _The Daily Chronicle_ on the  appearance of the _Letters to Family and Friends_.       \"These letters show,\" he says, \"that Stevenson's was not one of those     sunflower temperaments which turn by instinct, not effort, towards the     light, and are, as Mr Francis Thompson puts it, 'heartless and happy,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5921"],[0,"The History of Don Quixote, Volume 1, Complete (#6)"],[1,"of Granada. In order to  remit the money he had collected more conveniently to the treasury, he  entrusted it to a merchant, who failed and absconded; and as the  bankrupt's assets were insufficient to cover the whole, he was sent to  prison at Seville in September 1597. The balance against him, however,  was a small one, about 26l., and on giving security for it he was  released at the end of the year.    It was as he journeyed from town to town collecting the king's taxes,  that he noted down those bits of inn and wayside life and character that  abound in the pages of \"Don Quixote:\" the Benedictine monks with  spectacles and sunshades, mounted on their tall mules; the strollers in  costume bound for the next village; the barber with his basin on his  head, on his way to bleed a patient; the recruit with his breeches in his  bundle, tramping along the road singing; the reapers gathered in the  venta gateway listening to \"Felixmarte of Hircania\" read out to them; and  those little Hogarthian touches that he so well knew how to bring in, the  ox-tail hanging up with the landlord's comb stuck in it, the wine-skins  at the bed-head, and those notable examples of hostelry art, Helen going  off in high spirits on Paris's arm, and Dido on the tower dropping tears  as big as walnuts. Nay, it may well be that on those journeys into remote  regions he came across now and then a specimen of the pauper gentleman,  with his lean hack and his greyhound and his books of chivalry, dreaming  away his life in happy ignorance that the world had changed since his  great-grandfather's old helmet was new. But it was in Seville that he  found out his true vocation, though he himself would not by any means  have admitted it to be so. It was there, in Triana, that he was first  tempted to try his hand at drawing from life, and first brought his  humour into play in the exquisite little sketch of \"Rinconete y  Cortadillo,\" the germ, in more ways than one, of \"Don Quixote.\"    Where and when that was written, we cannot tell. After his imprisonment  all trace of Cervantes in his official capacity disappears, from which it  may be inferred that he was not reinstated. That he was still in Seville  in November 1598 appears from a satirical sonnet of his on the elaborate  catafalque erected to testify the grief of the city at the death of  Philip II, but from this up to 1603 we have no clue to his movements. The  words in the preface to the First Part of \"Don Quixote\" are generally  held to be conclusive that he conceived the idea of the book, and wrote  the beginning of it at least, in a prison, and that he may have done so  is extremely likely.    There is a tradition that Cervantes read some portions of his work to a  select audience at the Duke of Bejar's, which may have helped to make the  book known; but the obvious conclusion is that the First Part of \"Don  Quixote\" lay on his hands some time before he could find a publisher bold  enough to undertake a venture of so novel a character; and so little  faith in it had Francisco Robles of Madrid, to whom at last he sold it,  that he did not care to incur the expense of securing the copyright for  Aragon or Portugal, contenting himself with that for Castile. The  printing was finished in December, and the book came out with the new  year, 1605. It is often said that \"Don Quixote\" was at first received  coldly. The facts show just the contrary. No sooner was it in the hands  of the public than preparations were made to issue pirated editions at  Lisbon and Valencia, and to bring out a second edition with the  additional copyrights for Aragon and Portugal, which he secured in  February.    No doubt it was received with something more than coldness by certain  sections of the community. Men of wit, taste, and discrimination among  the aristocracy gave it a hearty welcome, but the aristocracy in general  were not likely to relish a book that turned their favourite reading into  ridicule and laughed at so many of their favourite ideas. The dramatists  who gathered round Lope as their leader regarded Cervantes as their  common enemy, and it is plain that he was equally obnoxious to the other  clique, the culto poets who had Gongora for their chief. Navarrete, who  knew nothing of the letter above mentioned, tries hard to show that the  relations between Cervantes and Lope were of a very friendly sort, as  indeed they were until \"Don Quixote\" was written. Cervantes, indeed, to  the last generously and manfully declared his admiration of Lope's  powers, his unfailing invention, and his marvellous fertility; but in the  preface of the First Part of \"Don Quixote\" and in the verses of \"Urganda  the Unknown,\" and one or two other places, there are, if we read between  the lines, sly hits at Lope's vanities and affectations that argue no  personal good-will; and Lope openly sneers at \"Don Quixote\" and  Cervantes, and fourteen years after his death gives him only a few lines  of cold commonplace in the \"Laurel de Apolo,\" that seem all the colder  for the eulogies of a host of nonentities whose names are found nowhere  else.    In 1601 Valladolid was made the seat of the Court, and at the beginning  of 1603 Cervantes had been summoned thither in connection with the  balance due by him to the Treasury, which was still outstanding. He  remained at Valladolid, apparently supporting himself by agencies and  scrivener's work of some sort; probably drafting petitions and drawing up  statements of claims to be presented to the Council, and the like. So, at  least, we gather from the depositions taken on the occasion of the death  of a gentleman, the victim of a street brawl, who had been carried into  the house in which he lived. In these he himself is described as a man  who wrote and transacted business, and it appears that his household then  consisted of his wife, the natural daughter Isabel de Saavedra already  mentioned, his sister Andrea, now a widow, her daughter Constanza, a  mysterious Magdalena de Sotomayor calling herself his sister, for whom  his biographers cannot account, and a servant-maid.    Meanwhile \"Don Quixote\" had been growing in favour, and its author's name  was now known beyond the Pyrenees. In 1607 an edition was printed at  Brussels. Robles, the Madrid publisher, found it necessary to meet the  demand by a third edition, the seventh in all, in 1608. The popularity of  the book in Italy was such that a Milan bookseller was led to bring out  an edition in 1610; and another was called for in Brussels in 1611. It  might naturally have been expected that, with such proofs before him that  he had hit the taste of the public, Cervantes would have at once set  about redeeming his rather vague promise of a second volume.    But, to all appearance, nothing was farther from his thoughts. He had  still by him one or two short tales of the same vintage as those he had  inserted in \"Don Quixote\" and instead of continuing the adventures of Don  Quixote, he set to work to write more of these \"Novelas Exemplares\" as he  afterwards called them, with a view to making a book of them.    The novels were published in the summer of 1613, with a dedication to the  Conde de Lemos, the Maecenas of the day, and with one of those chatty  confidential prefaces Cervantes was so fond of. In this, eight years and  a half after the First Part of \"Don Quixote\" had appeared, we get the  first hint of a forthcoming Second Part. \"You shall see shortly,\" he  says, \"the further exploits of Don Quixote and humours of Sancho Panza.\"  His idea of \"shortly\" was a somewhat elastic one, for, as we know by the  date to Sancho's letter, he had barely one-half of the book completed  that time twelvemonth.    But more than poems, or pastorals, or novels, it was his dramatic  ambition that engrossed his thoughts. The same indomitable spirit that  kept him from despair in the bagnios of Algiers, and prompted him to  attempt the escape of himself and his comrades again and again, made him  persevere in spite of failure and discouragement in his efforts to win  the ear of the public as a dramatist. The temperament of Cervantes was  essentially sanguine. The portrait he draws in the preface to the novels,  with the aquiline features, chestnut hair, smooth untroubled forehead,  and bright cheerful eyes, is the very portrait of a sanguine man. Nothing  that the managers might say could persuade him that the merits of his  plays would not be recognised at last if they were only given a fair  chance. The old soldier of the Spanish Salamis was bent on being the  Aeschylus of Spain. He was to found a great national drama, based on the  true principles of art, that was to be the envy of all nations; he was to  drive from the stage the silly, childish plays, the \"mirrors of nonsense  and models of folly\" that were in vogue through the cupidity of the  managers and shortsightedness of the authors; he was to correct and  educate the public taste until it was ripe for tragedies on the model of  the Greek drama--like the \"Numancia\" for instance--and comedies that  would not only amuse but improve and instruct. All this he was to do,  could he once get a hearing: there was the initial difficulty.    He shows plainly enough, too, that \"Don Quixote\" and the demolition of  the chivalry romances was not the work that lay next his heart. He was,  indeed, as he says himself in his preface, more a stepfather than a  father to \"Don Quixote.\" Never was great work so neglected by its author.  That it was written carelessly, hastily, and by fits and starts, was not  always his fault, but it seems clear he never read what he sent to the  press. He knew how the printers had blundered, but he never took the  trouble to correct them when the third edition was in progress, as a man  who really cared for the child of his brain would have done. He appears  to have regarded the book as little more than a mere libro de  entretenimiento, an amusing book, a"]]]
