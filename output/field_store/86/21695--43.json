[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49525"],[0,"First Lensman (#6)"],[1," expected the  unexpected--and got it.    \"Ah, Tellurians, you are precisely on time.\" A strong, assured,  deeply resonant pseudo-voice made itself heard in the depths of  each mind aboard the tremendous ship of war. \"Pilots and navigating  officers, you will shift course to one seventy eight dash seven twelve  fifty three. Hold that course, inert, at one Tellurian gravity of  acceleration. Virgil Samms will now be interviewed. He will return to  the consciousnesses of the rest of you in exactly six of your hours.\"    Practically dazed by the shock of their first experience with  telepathy, not one of the _Chicago's_ crew perceived anything unusual  in the phraseology of that utterly precise, diamond-clear thought.  Samms and Kinnison, however, precisionists themselves, did. But, warned  although they were and keyed up although they were to detect any sign  of hypnotism or of mental suggestion, neither of them had the faintest  suspicion, then or ever, that Virgil Samms did not as a matter of fact  leave the _Chicago_ at all.    Samms _knew_ that he boarded a lifeboat and drove it toward the  shimmering haze beyond which Arisia was. Commissioner Kinnison _knew_,  as surely as did every other man aboard, that Samms did those things,  because he and the other officers and most of the crew watched Samms do  them. They watched the lifeboat dwindle in size with distance; watched  it disappear within the peculiarly iridescent veil of force which their  most penetrant ultra-beam spy-rays could not pierce.    They waited.    And, since every man concerned _knew_, beyond any shadow of doubt and  to the end of his life, that everything that seemed to happen actually  did happen, it will be so described.    Virgil Samms, then, drove his small vessel through Arisia's innermost  screen and saw a planet so much like Earth that it might have been her  sister world. There were the white ice-caps, the immense blue oceans,  the verdant continents partially obscured by fleecy banks of cloud.    Would there, or would there not, be cities? While he had not known  at all exactly what to expect, he did not believe that there would  be any large cities upon Arisia. To qualify for the role of _deus ex  machina_, the Arisian with whom Samms was about to deal would have to  be a super-man indeed--a being completely beyond man's knowledge or  experience in power of mind. Would such a race of beings have need of  such things as cities? They would not. There would be no cities.    Nor were there. The lifeboat flashed downward--slowed--landed smoothly  in a regulation dock upon the outskirts of what appeared to be a small  village surrounded by farms and woods.    \"This way, please.\" An inaudible voice directed him toward a  two-wheeled vehicle which was almost, but not quite, like a Dillingham  roadster.    This car, however, took off by itself as soon as Samms closed the door.  It sped smoothly along a paved highway devoid of all other traffic,  past farms and past cottages, to stop of itself in front of the low,  massive structure which was the center of the village and, apparently,  its reason for being.    \"This way, please,\" and Samms went through an automatically-opened  door; along a short, bare hall; into a fairly large central room  containing a vat and one deeply-holstered chair.    \"Sit down, please.\" Samms did so, gratefully. He did not know whether  he could have stood up much longer or not.    He had expected to encounter a tremendous mentality; but this was a  thing far, far beyond his wildest imaginings. This was a brain--just  that--nothing else. Almost globular; at least ten feet in diameter;  immersed in and in perfect equilibrium with a pleasantly aromatic  liquid--a BRAIN!    \"Relax,\" the Arisian ordered, soothingly, and Samms found that he  _could_ relax. \"Through the one you know as Bergenholm I heard of your  need and have permitted you to come here this once for instruction.\"    \"But this ... none of this ... it isn't ... it _can't_ be real!\" Samms  blurted. \"I am--I must be--imagining it ... and yet I know that I  _can't_ be hypnotized--I've been psychoed against it!\"    \"What is reality?\" the Arisian asked, quietly. \"Your profoundest  thinkers have never been able to answer that question. Nor, although I  am much older and a much more capable thinker than any member of your  race, would I attempt to give you its true answer. Nor, since your  experience has been so limited, is it to be expected that you could  believe without reservation any assurances I might give you in thoughts  or in words. You must, then, convince yourself--definitely, by means  of your own five senses--that I and everything about you are real, as  you understand reality. You saw the village and this building; you see  the flesh that houses the entity which is I. You feel your own flesh;  as you tap the woodwork with your knuckles you feel the impact and  hear the vibrations as sound. As you entered this room you must have  perceived the odor of the nutrient solution in which and by virtue of  which I live. There remains only the sense of taste. Are you by any  chance either hungry or thirsty?\"    \"Both.\"    \"Drink of the tankard in the niche yonder. In order to avoid any  appearance of suggestion I will tell you nothing of its content except  the one fact that it matches perfectly the chemistry of your tissues.\"    Gingerly enough, Samms brought the pitcher to his lips--then, seizing  it in both hands, he gulped down a tremendous draught. It was GOOD! It  smelled like all appetizing kitchen aromas blended into one; it tasted  like all of the most delicious meals he had ever eaten; it quenched his  thirst as no beverage had ever done. But he could not empty even that  comparatively small container--whatever the stuff was, it had a satiety  value immensely higher even than old, rare, roast beef! With a sigh of  repletion Samms replaced the tankard and turned again to his peculiar  host.    \"I am convinced. That was real. No possible mental influence could so  completely and unmistakably satisfy the purely physical demands of  a body as hungry and as thirsty as mine was. Thanks, immensely, for  allowing me to come here, Mr....?\"    \"You may call me Mentor. I have no name, as you understand the term.  Now, then, please think fully--you need not speak--of your problems and  of your difficulties; of what you have done and of what you have it in  mind to do.\"    Samms thought, flashingly and cogently. A few minutes sufficed to cover  Triplanetary's history and the beginning of the Solarian Patrol; then,  for almost three hours, he went into the ramifications of the Galactic  Patrol of his imaginings. Finally he wrenched himself back to reality.  He jumped up, paced the floor, and spoke.    \"But there's a vital flaw, one inherent and absolutely ruinous fact  that makes the whole thing impossible!\" he burst out, rebelliously. \"No  one man, or group of men, no matter who they are, can be trusted with  that much power. The Council and I have already been called everything  imaginable; and what we have done so far is literally nothing at  all in comparison with what the Galactic Patrol could and must do.  Why, I myself would be the first to protest against the granting of  such power to _anybody_. Every dictator in history, from Philip of  Macedon to the Tyrant of Asia, claimed to be--and probably was, in his  beginnings--motivated solely by benevolence. How am I to think that the  proposed Galactic Council, or even I myself, will be strong enough to  conquer a thing that has corrupted utterly every man who has ever won  it? Who is to watch the watchmen?\"    \"The thought does you credit, youth,\" Mentor replied, unmoved. \"That is  one reason why you are here. You, of your own force, can not know that  you are in fact incorruptible. I, however, know. Moreover, there is an  agency by virtue of which that which you now believe to be impossible  will become commonplace. Extend your arm.\"    Samms did so, and there snapped around his wrist a platinum-iridium  bracelet carrying, wrist-watch-wise, a lenticular something at which  the Tellurian stared in stupefied amazement. It seemed to be composed  of thousands--millions--of tiny gems, each of which emitted pulsatingly  all the colors of the spectrum; it was throwing out--broadcasting--a  turbulent flood of writhing, polychromatic light!    \"The successor to the golden meteor of the Triplanetary Service,\"  Mentor said, calmly. \"The Lens of Arisia. You may take my word for it,  until your own experience shall have convinced you of the fact, that  no one will ever wear Arisia's Lens who is in any sense unworthy. Here  also is one for your friend, Commissioner Kinnison; it is not necessary  for him to come physically to Arisia. It is, you will observe, in an  insulated container, and does not glow. Touch its surface, but lightly  and very fleetingly, for the contact will be painful.\"    Samms' finger-tip barely touched one dull, gray, lifeless jewel: his  whole arm jerked away uncontrollably as there swept through his whole  being the intimation of an agony more poignant by far than any he had  ever known.    \"Why--it's _alive_!\" he gasped.    \"No, it is not really alive, as you understand the term ...\" Mentor  paused, as though seeking a way to describe to the Tellurian a thing  which was to him starkly incomprehensible. \"It is, however, endowed  with what you might call a sort of pseudo-life; by virtue of which it  gives off its characteristic radiation while, and only while, it is  in physical circuit with the living entity--the ego, let us say--with  whom it is in exact resonance. Glowing, the Lens is perfectly harmless;  it is complete--saturated--satiated--fulfilled. In the dark condition  it is, as you have learned, dangerous in the extreme. It is then  incomplete--unfulfilled--frustrated--you might say seeking or yearning  or demanding. In that condition its pseudo-life interferes so strongly  with any"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4962"],[0,"The Story of Germ Life (#6)"],[1," the world  which we are only just beginning to appreciate. In our attempt to  outline the agency which bacteria play in our industries and in  natural processes as well, we shall notice that they are sometimes  of value simply for their power of producing decomposition; but  their greatest value lies in the fact that they are important  agents because of the products of their life.    We may notice, in the first place, that in the arts there are  several industries which may properly be classed together as  maceration industries, all of which are based upon the  decomposition powers of bacteria. Hardly any animal or vegetable  substance is able to resist their softening influence, and the  artisan relies upon this power in several different directions.    BENEFITS DERIVED FROM POWERS OF DECOMPOSITION.    Linen.--Linen consists of certain woody fibres of the stem of the  flax. The flax stem is not made up entirely of the valuable  fibres, but largely of more brittle wood fibres, which are of no  use. The valuable fibres are, however, closely united with the  wood and with each other in such an intimate fashion that it is  impossible to separate them by any mechanical means. The whole  cellular substance of the stem is bound together by some cementing  materials which hold it in a compact mass, probably a salt of  calcium and pectinic acid. The art of preparing flax is a process  of getting rid of the worthless wood fibres and preserving the  valuable, longer, tougher, and more valuable fibres, which are  then made into linen. But to separate them it is necessary first  to soften the whole tissue. This is always done through the aid of  bacteria. The flax stems, after proper preparation, are exposed to  the action of moisture and heat, which soon develops a rapid  bacterial growth. Sometimes this is done by simply exposing the  flax to the dew and rain and allowing it to lie thus exposed for  some time. By another process the stems are completely immersed in  water and allowed to remain for ten to fourteen days. By a third  process the water in which the flax is immersed is heated from 75  degrees to 90 degrees F., with the addition of certain chemicals,  for some fifty to sixty hours. In all cases the effect is the  same. The moisture and the heat cause a growth of bacteria which  proceeds with more or less rapidity according to the temperature  and other conditions. A putrefactive fermentation is thus set up  which softens the gummy substance holding the fibres together. The  process is known as \"retting,\" and after it is completed the  fibres are easily isolated from each other. A purely mechanical  process now easily separates the valuable fibres from the wood  fibres. The whole process is a typical fermentation. A  disagreeable odour arises from the fermenting flax, and the liquid  after the fermentation is filled with products which make valuable  manure. The process has not been scientifically studied until very  recently. The bacillus which produces the \"retting\" is known now,  however, and it has been shown that the \"retting\" is a process of  decomposition of the pectin cement. No method of separating the  linen fibres in the flax from the wood fibres has yet been devised  which dispenses with the aid of bacteria.    Jute and Hemp.--Almost exactly the same use is made of bacterial  action in the manufacture of jute und hemp. The commercial aspect  of the jute industry has grown to be a large one, involving many  millions of dollars. Like linen, jute is a fibre of the inner bark  of a plant, and is mixed in the bark with a mass of other useless  fibrous material. As in the case of linen, a fermentation by  bacteria is depended upon as a means of softening the material so  that the fibres can be disassociated. The process is called  \"retting,\" as in the linen manufacture. The details of the process  are somewhat different. The jute is commonly fermented in tanks of  stagnant water, although sometimes it is allowed to soak in river  water for a sufficient length of time to produce the softening.  After the fermentation is thus started the jute fibre is separated  from the wood, and is of a sufficient flexibility and toughness to  be woven into sacking, carpets, curtains, table covers, and other  coarse cloth.    Practically the same method is used in separating the tough fibres  of the hemp. The hemp plant contains some long flexible fibres  with others of no value, and bacterial fermentation is relied upon  to soften the tissues so that they may be separated.    Cocoanut fibre, a somewhat similar material is obtained from the  husk of the cocoanut by the same means. The unripened husk is  allowed to steep and ferment in water for a long time, six months  or a year being required. By this time the husk has become so  softened that it can be beaten until the fibres separate and can  be removed. They are subsequently made into a number of coarse  articles, especially valuable for their toughness. Door mats,  brushes, ships' fenders, etc., are illustrations of the sort of  articles made from them.    In each of these processes the fermentation must have a tendency  to soften the desired fibres as well as the connecting substance.  Putrefaction attacks all kinds of vegetable tissue, and if this  \"retting\" continues too long the desired fibre is decidedly  injured by the softening effect of the fermentation. It is quite  probable that, even as commonly carried on, the fermentation has  some slight injurious effect upon the fibre, and that if some  purely mechanical means could be devised for separating the fibre  from the wood it would produce a better material. But such  mechanical means has not been devised, and at present a  putrefactive fermentation appears to be the only practical method  of separating the fibres.    Sponges.--A somewhat similar use is made of bacteria in the  commercial preparation of sponges. The sponge of commerce is  simply the fibrous skeleton of a marine animal. When it is alive  this skeleton is completely filled with the softer parts of the  animal, and to fit the sponge for use this softer organic material  must be got rid of. It is easily accomplished by rotting. The  fresh sponges are allowed to stand in the warm sun and very  rapidly decay. Bacteria make their way into the sponge and  thoroughly decompose the soft tissues. After a short putrefaction  of this sort the softened organic matter can be easily washed out  of the skeleton and leave the clean fibre ready for market.    Leather preparation.--The tanning of leather is a purely chemical  process, and in some processes the whole operation of preparing  the leather is a chemical one. In others, however, especially in  America, bacteria are brought into action at one stage. The dried  hide which comes to the tannery must first have the hair removed  together with the outer skin. The hide for this purpose must be  moistened and softened. In some tanneries this is done by steeping  it in chemicals. In others, however, it is put into water and  slightly heated until fermentation arises. The fermentation  softens it so that the outer skin can be easily removed with a  knife, and the removal of hair is accomplished at the same time.  Bacterial putrefaction in the tannery is thus an assistance in  preparing the skin for the tanning proper. Even in the subsequent  tanning a bacterial fermentation appears to play a part, but  little is yet known in regard to it.    Maceration of skeletons.--The making of skeletons for museums and  anatomical instruction in general is no very great industry, and  yet it is one of importance. In the making of skeletons the  process of maceration is commonly used as an aid. The maceration  consists simply in allowing the skeleton to soak in water for a  day or two after cleaning away the bulk of the muscles. The  putrefaction that arises softens the connective tissues so much  that the bones may be readily cleaned of flesh.    Citric acid.--Bacterial fermentation is employed also in the  ordinary preparation of citric acid. The acid is made chiefly from  the juice of the lemon. The juice is pressed from the fruit and  then allowed to ferment. The fermentation aids in separating a  mucilaginous mass and making it thus possible to obtain the citric  acid in a purer condition. The action is probably similar to the  maceration processes described above, although it has not as yet  been studied by bacteriologists.    BENEFITS DERIVED FROM THE PRODUCTS OF BACTERIAL LIFE.    While bacteria thus play a part in our industries simply from  their power of producing decomposition, it is primarily because of  the products of their action that they are of value. Wherever  bacteria seize hold of organic matter and feed upon it, there are  certain to be developed new chemical compounds, resulting largely  from decomposition, but partly also from constructive processes.  These new compounds are of great variety. Different species of  bacteria do not by any means produce the same compounds even when  growing in and decomposing the same food material. Moreover, the  same species of bacteria may give rise to different products when  growing in different food materials. Some of the compounds  produced by such processes are poisonous, others are harmless.  Some are gaseous, others are liquids. Some have peculiar odours,  as may be recognised from the smell arising from a bit of decaying  meat. Others have peculiar tastes, as may be realized in the gamy  taste of meat which is in the incipient stages of putrefaction. By  purely empirical means mankind has learned methods of encouraging  the development of some of these products, and is to-day making  practical use of this power, possessed by bacteria, of furnishing  desired chemical compounds. Industries involving the investment of  hundreds of millions of dollars are founded upon the products of  bacterial life, and they have a far more important relation to our"]]]
