Sperm are present in small  groups within the sustentacular cytoplasm, but ordinarily are absent  in the lumina.    Primary spermatocytes appear in the tubules from mid-May to early  June. By mid-May there are practically no sperm at any place in the  tubules. The sustentacular cytoplasm has a less compact arrangement in  late May than in April.    Spermatogenesis is well under way by mid-June; at this time, two or  three distinct layers of primary and secondary spermatocytes are  present and these cells outnumber the Sertoli cells. The lumina are  filled with cellular detritus and are no longer bordered by a clear  ring of sustentacular cytoplasm. No sperm are present.    Spermatids appear in late June and a few of them undergo metamorphosis  in early July; by mid-July, spermatids and secondary spermatocytes are  the dominant cells in the seminiferous tubules, although  spermatogonia are still active.    By late August, clusters of sperm and metamorphosing spermatids  surround the Sertoli cells; large numbers of sperm as well as sloughed  cells representing various spermatogenic stages are present in the  lumina. Secondary spermatocytes are still evident near the periphery  of the tubules but they are much less numerous than spermatids. The  germinal epithelium is still semiactive and small groups of primary  spermatocytes are present in nearly all of the tubules.    The spermatogenic cycle is completed in the latter half of October  when most of the spermatozoa pass into the epididymides. A few  spermatozoa and spermatids remain in the seminiferous tubules during  hibernation. Although no testicular material was obtained from  hibernating turtles, comparisons of sections made in October and April  show that the germinal epithelium remains inactive from autumn until  spring. Possibly some spermiogenesis takes place in the early phases  of hibernation or in the period in late autumn when turtles are  intermittently active. It is uncertain whether the reorganization of  the sustentacular cytoplasm occurs in autumn, in spring, or in the  course of hibernation.    The seminiferous tubules of immature males are small, lack lumina, and  contain a few large but inactive spermatogonia (Pl. 19, Fig. 6). The  testes of specimens that were nearly mature contained primary and  secondary spermatocytes but lacked lumina; it was thought that such  individuals would have matured in the following summer and bred in the  following autumn.    Mature sperm were found in epididymides at all times of the year but  were most numerous in spring and autumn, the period between  spermatogenic cycles (Pl. 19, Fig. 7). Sperm expelled from the  epididymides in autumn matings are seemingly replaced by others from  the seminiferous tubules; the epididymides become much smaller when  their supply of sperm is nearly exhausted after spring mating.    Risley (1938:304) found the testes of the common musk turtle,  _Sternotherus odoratus_, to be largest in August and smallest in early  May. Recession of testes in spring was coincident with the period of  active breeding; increase in size, later in the season, corresponded  to increasing spermatogenic activity and enlargement of seminiferous  tubules. Altland (1951:600-603) found the spermatogenic cycle of  _Terrapene carolina_ to be nearly like that of _Sternotherus  odoratus_. Fox (1952) found that testes of garter snakes (_Thamnophis  sirtalis_ and _T. elegans_) in California reached a peak of  spermatogenic activity in midsummer, regressed in the latter half of  the summer, and were inactive in winter.    The spermatogenic cycle of _T. ornata_ as here reported, differs in no  important respect from those of _Thamnophis_, _Sternotherus odoratus_,  or _Terrapene carolina_, except that in _T. ornata_ the cycle begins  and ends somewhat later in the season of activity. In most of the  lizards that have been studied (Fox, 1952:492-3), spermatogenesis  reaches a peak in spring (more or less coincident with the mating  period and with ovulation) and the germinal epithelium remains active  in winter. _Sternotherus_, _Terrapene_, and _Thamnophis_ are alike in  completing spermatogenesis late in the season and storing spermatozoa,  in the seminiferous tubules or in the epididymides, during  hibernation.    It is noteworthy that, in the turtles and snakes mentioned above,  sperm produced in autumn are used to fertilize eggs laid in the  following year, and mating [with the exception of _Thamnophis  elegans_, (Fox, 1956)] occurs in both spring and autumn. It is not  definitely known in any of these instances, whether sperm resulting  from autumn or spring inseminations (or both) fertilize the eggs.  Risley (1933:693) found motile sperm in the oviducts of female  _Sternotherus odoratus_ that had recently emerged from hibernation;  he believed that spring mating, although it commonly occurred, was not  necessary to fertilize eggs. Disadvantages, if any, of completing  spermatogenesis well in advance of ovulation seem to be at least  partly counteracted by two annual mating periods or by mating  throughout the season of activity.    Sexual Cycle of Females    The following account of oAÂ¶genesis is based on examination of  preserved ovaries from 68 mature specimens. The ages of most specimens  were known, inasmuch as the specimens were used in studies of growth  as well as gametogenesis. Other data were obtained from adult females  that were dissected but not preserved, and from immature females.       [Illustration: FIG. 4. Seasonal fluctuations in ovarian weight         in _T. o. ornata_, as determined by examination of 60 specimens         from eastern Kansas.]    Size of ovarian follicles was determined by means of a clear plastic  gauge containing notches 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 millimeters wide. The  number of follicles within a given size range could be quickly  determined by finding the smallest notch into which the follicles fit.  It was necessary to weigh all ovaries after preservation since some of  them had not been weighed when fresh. Since all ovarian samples were  preserved in the same manner, weights remained relatively the same.  Preserved material was lighter than fresh by an average of 13 per  cent. Follicles less than one millimeter in diameter were not counted.  Corpora lutea and corpora albicantia were studied under a binocular  dissecting microscope. No histological studies were made of the female  reproductive system.    Ovarian follicles and oviducal eggs were recorded separately for the  right and left sides. Each ovary was always kept associated with the  oviduct of the same side, but in some instances it was not recorded  whether the organs were left or right.    Ovaries ordinarily weighed most in October, March, and April, when  most females contained enlarged follicles, and least in August and  September when the supply of enlarged follicles was usually exhausted  (Figs. 4 and 5).       [Illustration: FIG. 5. The seasonal occurrence of enlarged         ovarian follicles in females of _T. o. ornata_, expressed,         For each month, as the percentage of total females that         contained two or more follicles having diameters greater than         15 mm. Total number of females in each of the samples is shown         in parentheses at the top of each bar.]    The ovarian cycle begins in July or August, after ovulation has  occurred. At that time many minute follicles form on the germinal  ridges of the ovaries. On the basis of the material that I examined,  it seems that ovarian follicles either grow to nearly mature size in  the season preceding ovulation and remain quiescent over winter or  grow rapidly in the period of approximately six weeks between spring  emergence and ovulation. Altland (1951:603-5) reported that the former  condition was the usual one in _T. carolina_; he suggested that  possibly some of the enlarged follicles were absorbed during  hibernation.    Examination of yolks of oviducal eggs revealed that follicles mature  when they reach a diameter of 16 to 20 millimeters and a weight of two  to two and one-half grams (Pl. 20, Fig. 1).    The enlarged follicles remaining on the ovaries after ovulation  (excluding those smaller than six mm.) can be grouped according to  diameter as: large (greater than 15 mm.), medium (11 to 15 mm.), and  small (six to 10 mm.). Ten females collected in the period from June 2  to 8, after they had ovulated, all had follicles falling in at least  one of these size groups, and eight had follicles falling in two or  more of the groups. In females having enlarged follicles of more than  one of the size groups, there were several follicles in each of two  groups and no follicles, or only one follicle, in the remaining group.  Enlarged follicles represent future clutches but whether the enlarged  follicles will be ovulated in the same season or in a later season is  questionable.    Evidence found in the present study suggested that at least a few  females lay more than one clutch of eggs per year. Among 34 specimens  obtained in June and July, eight (24 per cent) had corpora lutea (or  easily discernible corpora albicantia) and at least two follicles more  than 15 millimeters in diameter; in three specimens (9 per cent) the  ovaries bore fresh corpora lutea (representing recent ovulations) and  a set of older corpora lutea (representing ovulations that had  occurred several weeks previously). It was thought that each of these  eleven females (33 per cent of sample) had produced or would have  produced two clutches of eggs in the season of its capture. The number  of large follicles present after the first set of ovulations (mean,  3.5) was fewer in most instances than the average clutch-size (see  below), indicating that second clutches are smaller than first  clutches. Smaller second clutches were found also in _T. carolina_  (Legler, 1958).    Further evidence for multiple clutches was the absence of enlarged  ovarian"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37595"],[0,"Ecological Studies of the Timber Wolf in Northeastern Minnesota (#6)"],[1,"times 1055 was observed through February 1.  However, from February 5 to 19, 1055 was with another wolf on eight of  the 12 times she was seen. The two animals were observed resting,  traveling, hunting, and feeding together. On February 20, and  thereafter, 1055 was alone all 14 times she was seen.    It is possible that 1055's associate was killed between February 19 and  20. About March 6, a 63-pound male wolf pup was found dead (by Mr.  Charles Wick, USDA Forest Service) within about 50 feet of a highway  and less than a mile from where 1055 and her associate were seen on  February 19. Because of the snow conditions, it was judged that the  wolf had been killed (probably by an automobile) sometime in February.    Wolf 1057, whose foot froze during capture, was a member of a pack of  10 to 13 wolves, and was seen with the pack on January 13 and 18. After  that she was usually found alone, although on at least five occasions  she was with one or more wolves:                     _No. of_  _Period_      _observations_  _Associations_    Jan. 13              1        10 other wolves  Jan. 14-17           1        None  Jan. 18              1        10 or 11 other wolves  Jan. 19-29           2        None  Jan. 30              1        1 other wolf  Jan. 31 to Feb. 2    2        None  Feb. 3-4             2        2 other wolves  Feb. 5               1        1 other wolf  Feb. 6-13            6        None  Feb. 14              1        3 other wolves  Feb. 15-22           5        None  Feb. 23              1        10 to 13 other wolves  Feb. 24 to Apr. 24   6        None    February 23 she was with the pack at a kill in her usual area, and  although the pack left that night, 1057 remained near the kill the next  day. Presumably this animal would have traveled with pack if she could  have.    No. 1059 was part of a pack that included three to five members (fig.  26). From January 25, the first time she was observed after release,  through April 2, the animal was seen 19 times with two other wolves,  eight times with at least three others, and eight times with four  others. She was never seen alone until April 17; both times after this  when she was seen, May 9 and 21, 1059 was also alone.    Some insight into the fluctuating size of this pack was obtained on  February 27 when the five animals were followed for 2 hours. During  that time two members (one of which was larger than the other) often  lagged behind the other three by as much as a mile. These two romped  and played considerably, with one carrying a stick or a bone part of  the time. Eventually they caught up again to the other three. The  behavior of the two lagging wolves would be consistent with the  hypothesis that they were either pups or a courting pair of adults. In  either case, they seemed to be an actual part of the pack even though  they temporarily traveled separately.    [Illustration: _Figure 26.--One of the radiotagged wolves was a member  of this pack of five. (Photo courtesy of L. D. Mech.)_]    The fact that 1059 was observed traveling alone three times from April  17 to May 21 may be further evidence that the pack had a den in the  area at that time. The presence of a den allows individual pack members  to venture off singly and return each day to a known social center, as  Murie (1944) observed, so they do not need to travel with each other to  maintain social bonds. Wolves in our area breed during the latter half  of February (see below), and the young should be born in the latter  half of April. Since dens are prepared a few weeks in advance (Young  1944), pack members might be expected to begin traveling singly in  mid-April.    Some information on social relations within our radiotagged pack of  five was also obtained. One of the members could often be  distinguished from the others by its reddish cast and this individual  appeared to be the pack leader or alpha male (Schenkel 1947). In  urinating, this animal lifted his leg, a position seen almost  exclusively in males. Except for only two temporary occasions, this  animal always headed the pack, which usually traveled single file. The  second wolf in line generally was noticeably small, possible a female,  and the third wolf was twice identified as 1059 on the basis of  sightings of her collar.    The leader often gained a lead on the other wolves, especially during a  chase (see below), much as reported for a lead wolf on Isle Royale  (Mech 1966a). Upon returning to the lagging members of the pack, this  animal usually held his tail vertically, an expression of social  dominance (Schenkel 1947). On two occasions he led chases against  strange wolves and demonstrated the highest motivation (see below).    The leader was also the most active in his reactions when scent posts  were encountered. Because the function of scent-marking behavior is  still unknown, it is important that detailed descriptions of the  natural behavior of free-ranging wolves around scent posts be made  available (fig. 27). Thus the following excerpt from field notes by  Mech dated February 27, 1969, is presented:    [Illustration: _Figure 27.--Feces, urine, and scratching in a  conspicuous spot indicate a wolf \"scent post.\" (Photo courtesy of  L. D. Mech.)_]         \"When they [the three wolves] came to a small frozen pond,       where the wolf trail [which they had been following]       branched and there were some packed down areas, they became       quite excited [fig. 28]. This was especially true of the       reddish wolf. He nosed several spots, and scratched around       them. Usually his tail was vertical. He defecated at one       spot, and right afterwards another wolf did. After about 2       minutes that pack went on.    [Illustration: _Figure 28.--A pack of wolves investigating a scent  post. The raised tails indicate their excitement. (Photo courtesy of  L. D. Mech.)_]         \"About 15 minutes later the 2 'satellite' wolves arrived at       this spot, hesitated, nosed around but continued on after       less than a minute.         \"The three wolves meanwhile came to a junction of 2 logging       roads. There they nosed around, scratched, and acted much as       described above. Again the reddish wolf was most active and       had its tail up.         \"When the last 2 wolves came to this spot, they nosed       around, ran back and forth, and 1 defecated. They then       headed on a different branch of the trail than the first 3       had gone on just 10 minutes before.         \"The first 3 wolves meanwhile were running along a logging       road but eventually they circled and one other than the       reddish one headed across a swamp toward the last 2. Then       the reddish one and the other followed this one, and they       met the last 2 on a ridge. There was the usual tail wagging,       then all headed off together in a new direction. They passed       the first scent post again and there was some nosing by the       reddish wolf but little hesitation.         \"When they traveled, one wolf lagged behind by 150 yards.       The wolf just ahead of it had its tail vertical part of the       time, as did the reddish leader.         \"Soon the pack came upon another area packed with wolf       tracks on a pond. There they followed every little trail,       nose to the ground, wagged tails, grouped together often,       chased each other, rolled over, etc. for 6 minutes. The       reddish animal had tail up most of the time.         \"The wolves continued on, and we left them about 1 mile S.W.       of the S.W. arm of Bald Eagle Lake [at 6:05 p.m.].\"    Unfortunately it was not known whether the trails that the wolves were  following were their own or those made by other wolves.    Significant aspects of the above observation are (1) the spirited  initiative of the leader, (2) the amount of time spent in scratching,  urinating, and defecating, (3) the decision of the last two wolves to  take a different route from that of the first three even though their  goal seemed to be to catch up to the first three, and (4) the fact that  the scent posts were located at trail junctions. In the last regard, we  often noted from the ground that wolves urinated at the junction of  newly formed human trails heading perpendicularly from roads they were  following.    Copulation in wolves was only observed once during our study, on  February 19, 1969. Two members of a group of four were seen coupled for  2 minutes on Kekekabic Lake. On Isle Royale, which is at the same  latitude, copulations were witnessed on February 21, 24 and 27 (Mech  1966a).    On April 17, a den west of Big Moose Lake known to have been used at  least intermittently for 13 years was seen from the air to have fresh  activity of some kind in the snow in front of it, and on April 24 we  saw a wolf at the mound. A few days later, two local human residents  unaware of our interests approached this den and looked in. An adult  wolf, presumably the bitch, leaped over their heads and fled the area.  The men then dug up the den and removed six pups whose eyes had not yet  opened.      Intraspecific Intolerance and Indifference    Instances of chasing or attack by a pack of wolves on conspecifics not  a part of their group have been described by Murie (1944) and Mech  (1966a). Observations of such behavior are important in trying to  determine conclusively whether or not wolves are territorial. Pimlott  _et al._ (1969, p. 75) wrote \"It still is not clear, however, whether  or not their use of range should be defined as territorial.\" Mech  (1970) summarized the available evidence for territoriality in wolves  and postulated that it may be spatiotemporal such that packs might  avoid each other at any particular point in time but over a long period  might cover the same area at different times. A number of our  observations are pertinent to this question, for we have evidence of  both, tolerance and intolerance between population units of"]]]
