And it may be said here that, if  Mr. Hopper underestimated him, certainly he underestimated Mr. Hopper.    \"It ain't easy to get a job this Fall,\" said Eliphalet, \"St. Louis  houses have felt the panic.\"    \"I am sorry to hear that.\"    \"What business was you callatin' to grapple with?\"    \"Law,\" said Stephen.    \"Gosh!\" exclaimed Mr. Hopper, \"I want to know.\" In reality he was a  bit chagrined, having pictured with some pleasure the Boston aristocrat  going from store to store for a situation. \"You didn't come here  figurin' on makin' a pile, I guess.\"    \"A what?\"    \"A pile.\"    Stephen looked down and over Mr. Hopper attentively. He took in the  blocky shoulders and the square head, and he pictured the little eyes at  a vanishing-point in lines of a bargain. Then humor blessed humor--came  to his rescue. He had entered the race in the West, where all start  equal. He had come here, like this man who was succeeding, to make his  living. Would he succeed?    Mr. Hopper drew something out of his pocket, eyed Miss Crane, and bit  off a corner.    \"What office was you going into?\" he asked genially. Mr. Brice decided  to answer that.    \"Judge Whipple's--unless he has changed his mind.\" Eliphalet gave him a  look more eloquent than words.    \"Know the Judge?\"    Silent laughter.    \"If all the Fourth of Julys we've had was piled into one,\" said Mr.  Hopper, slowly and with conviction, \"they wouldn't be a circumstance to  Silas Whipple when he gets mad. My boss, Colonel Carvel, is the only  man in town who'll stand up to him. I've seen 'em begin a quarrel in the  store and carry it all the way up the street. I callate you won't stay  with him a great while.\"          CHAPTER IV. BLACK CATTLE    Later that evening Stephen Brice was sitting by the open windows in his  mother's room, looking on the street-lights below.    \"Well, my dear,\" asked the lady, at length, \"what do you think of it  all?\"    \"They are kind people,\" he said.    \"Yes, they are kind,\" she assented, with a sigh. \"But they are not--they  are not from among our friends, Stephen.\"    \"I thought that one of our reasons for coming West, mother,\" answered  Stephen.    His mother looked pained.    \"Stephen, how can you! We came West in order that you might have more  chance for the career to which you are entitled. Our friends in Boston  were more than good.\"    He left the window and came and stood behind her chair, his hands  clasped playfully beneath her chin.    \"Have you the exact date about you, mother?\"    \"What date, Stephen?\"    \"When I shall leave St. Louis for the United States Senate. And you  must not forget that there is a youth limit in our Constitution for  senators.\"    Then the widow smiled,--a little sadly, perhaps. But still a wonderfully  sweet smile. And it made her strong face akin to all that was human and  helpful.    \"I believe that you have the subject of my first speech in that august  assembly. And, by the way, what was it?\"    \"It was on 'The Status of the Emigrant,'\" she responded instantly,  thereby proving that she was his mother.    \"And it touched the Rights of Privacy,\" he added, laughing, \"which do  not seem to exist in St. Louis boarding-houses.\"    \"In the eyes of your misguided profession, statesmen and authors and  emigrants and other public charges have no Rights of Privacy,\" said she.  \"Mr. Longfellow told me once that they were to name a brand of flour for  him, and that he had no redress.\"    \"Have you, too, been up before Miss Crane's Commission?\" he asked, with  amused interest.    His mother laughed.    \"Yes,\" she said quietly.    \"They have some expert members,\" he continued. \"This Mrs. Abner  Reed could be a shining light in any bar. I overheard a part of her  cross-examination. She--she had evidently studied our case--\"    \"My dear,\" answered Mrs. Brice, \"I suppose they know all about us.\" She  was silent a moment, \"I had so hoped that they wouldn't. They lead the  same narrow life in this house that they did in their little New England  towns. They--they pity us, Stephen.\"    \"Mother!\"    \"I did not expect to find so many New Englanders here--I wish that Mr.  Whipple had directed us elsewhere-\"    \"He probably thought that we should feel at home among New Englanders. I  hope the Southerners will be more considerate. I believe they will,\" he  added.    \"They are very proud,\" said his mother. \"A wonderful people,--born  aristocrats. You don't remember those Randolphs with whom we travelled  through England. They were with us at Hollingdean, Lord Northwell's  place. You were too small at the time. There was a young girl, Eleanor  Randolph, a beauty. I shall never forget the way she entered those  English drawing-rooms. They visited us once in Beacon Street,  afterwards. And I have heard that there are a great many good Southern  families here in St. Louis.\"    \"You did not glean that from Judge Whipple's letter, mother,\" said  Stephen, mischievously.    \"He was very frank in his letter,\" sighed Mrs. Brice.    \"I imagine he is always frank, to put it delicately.\"    \"Your father always spoke in praise of Silas Whipple, my dear. I have  heard him call him one of the ablest lawyers in the country. He won a  remarkable case for Appleton here, and he once said that the Judge  would have sat on the Supreme Bench if he had not been pursued with such  relentlessness by rascally politicians.\"    \"The Judge indulges in a little relentlessness now and then, himself.  He is not precisely what might be termed a mild man, if what we hear is  correct.\"    Mrs. Brice started.    \"What have you heard?\" she asked.    \"Well, there was a gentleman on the steamboat who said that it took  more courage to enter the Judge's private office than to fight a Border  Ruffian. And another, a young lawyer, who declared that he would rather  face a wild cat than ask Whipple a question on the new code. And yet he  said that the Judge knew more law than any man in the West. And lastly,  there is a polished gentleman named Hopper here from Massachusetts who  enlightened me a little more.\"    Stephen paused and bit his tongue. He saw that she was distressed by  these things. Heaven knows that she had borne enough trouble in the last  few months.    \"Come, mother,\" he said gently, \"you should know how to take my jokes by  this time. I didn't mean it. I am sure the Judge is a good man,--one of  those aggressive good men who make enemies. I have but a single piece of  guilt to accuse him of.\"    \"And what is that?\" asked the widow.    \"The cunning forethought which he is showing in wishing to have it said  that a certain Senator and Judge Brice was trained in his office.\"    \"Stephen--you goose!\" she said.    Her eye wandered around the room,--Widow Crane's best bedroom. It was  dimly lighted by an extremely ugly lamp. The hideous stuffy bed curtains  and the more hideous imitation marble mantel were the two objects that  held her glance. There was no change in her calm demeanor. But Stephen,  who knew his mother, felt that her little elation over her arrival had  ebbed, Neither would confess dejection to the other.    \"I--even I--\" said Stephen, tapping his chest, \"have at least made  the acquaintance of one prominent citizen, Mr. Eliphalet D. Hopper.  According to Mr. Dickens, he is a true American gentleman, for he chews  tobacco. He has been in St. Louis five years, is now assistant manager  of the largest dry goods house, and still lives in one of Miss  Crane's four-dollar rooms. I think we may safely say that he will be a  millionaire before I am a senator.\"    He paused.    \"And mother?\"    \"Yes, dear.\"    He put his hands in his pockets and walked over to the window.    \"I think that it would be better if I did the same thing.\"    \"What do you mean, my son--\"    \"If I went to work,--started sweeping out a store, I mean. See here,  mother, you've sacrificed enough for me already. After paying father's  debts, we've come out here with only a few thousand dollars, and the  nine hundred I saved out of this year's Law School allowance. What shall  we do when that is gone? The honorable legal profession, as my friend  reminded me to-night, is not the swiftest road to millions.\"    With a mother's discernment she guessed the agitation, he was striving  to hide; she knew that he had been gathering courage for this moment for  months. And she knew that he was renouncing thus lightly, for her sake  an ambition he had had from his school days.    Widow passed her hand over her brow. It was a space before she answered  him.    \"My son,\" she said, let us never speak of this again:    \"It was your father's dearest wish that you should become a lawyer  and--and his wishes are sacred God will take care of us.\"    She rose and kissed him good-night.    \"Remember, my dear, when you go to Judge Whipple in the morning,  remember his kindness, and--.\"    \"And keep my temper. I shall, mother.\"    A while later he stole gently back into her room again. She was on her  knees by the walnut bedstead.    At nine the next manning Stephen left Miss Crane's, girded for the  struggle with the redoubtable Silas Whipple. He was not afraid, but a  poor young man as an applicant to a notorious dragon is not likely to  be bandied with velvet, even though the animal had been a friend of  his father. Dragons as a rule have had a hard rime in their youths, and  believe in others having a hard time.    To a young man, who as his father's heir in Boston had been the  subject of marked consideration by his elders, the situation was keenly  distasteful. But it had to be gone through. So presently, after inquiry,  he came to the open square where the new Court House stood, the dome  of which was indicated by a mass of staging, and one wing still to be  completed. Across from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54"],[0,"The Marvelous Land of Oz (#6)"],[1,"dripping,  up the grassy bank.    Tip's trouser-legs and shoes were thoroughly soaked; but the Saw-Horse had  floated so perfectly that from his knees up the boy was entirely dry. As for  the Pumpkinhead, every stitch of his gorgeous clothing dripped water.    \"The sun will soon dry us,\" said Tip \"and, anyhow, we are now safely across,  in spite of the ferryman, and can continue our journey.    \"I didn't mind swimming, at all,\" remarked the horse.    \"Nor did I,\" added Jack.    They soon regained the road of yellow brick, which proved to be a  continuation of the road they had left on the other side, and then Tip once  more mounted the Pumpkinhead upon the back of the Saw-Horse.        63    \"If you ride fast,\" said he, \"the wind will help to dry your clothing. I  will hold on to the horse's tail and run after you. In this way we all will  become dry in a very short time.\"    \"Then the horse must step lively,\" said Jack.    \"I'll do my best,\" returned the Saw-Horse, cheerfully.    Tip grasped the end of the branch that served as tail to the Saw-Horse, and  called loudly: \"Get-up!\"    The horse started at a good pace, and Tip followed behind. Then he decided  they could go faster, so he shouted: \"Trot!\"    Now, the Saw-Horse remembered that this word was the command to go as fast  as he could; so he began rocking along the road at a tremendous pace,                   Line-Art Drawing        64  and Tip had hard work--running faster than he ever had before in his  life--to keep his feet.    Soon he was out of breath, and although he wanted to call \"Whoa!\" to the  horse, he found he could not get the word out of his throat. Then the end of  the tail he was clutching, being nothing more than a dead branch, suddenly  broke away, and the next minute the boy was rolling in the dust of the road,  while the horse and its pumpkin-headed rider dashed on and quickly  disappeared in the distance.    By the time Tip had picked himself up and cleared the dust from his throat  so he could say \"Whoa!\" there was no further need of saying it, for the  horse was long since out of sight.    So he did the only sensible thing he could do. He sat down and took a good  rest, and afterward began walking along the road.    \"Some time I will surely overtake them,\" he reflected; \"for the road will  end at the gates of the Emerald City, and they can go no further than that.\"    Meantime Jack was holding fast to the post and the Saw-Horse was tearing  along the road like a racer. Neither of them knew Tip was left behind, for  the Pumpkinhead did not look around and the Saw-Horse couldn't.    As he rode, Jack noticed that the grass and trees        65  had become a bright emerald-green in color, so he guessed they were nearing  the Emerald City even before the tall spires and domes came into sight.    At length a high wall of green stone, studded thick with emeralds, loomed up  before them; and fearing the Saw-Horse would not know enough to stop and so  might smash them both against this wall, Jack ventured to cry \"Whoa!\" as  loud as he could.    So suddenly did the horse obey that had it not been for his post Jack would  have been pitched off head foremost, and his beautiful face ruined.    \"That was a fast ride, dear father!\" he exclaimed; and then, hearing no  reply, he turned around and discovered for the first time that Tip was not  there.    This apparent desertion puzzled the Pumpkinhead, and made him uneasy. And  while he was wondering what had become of the boy, and what he ought to do  next under such trying circumstances, the gateway in the green wall opened  and a man came out.    This man was short and round, with a fat face that seemed remarkably good-  natured. He was clothed all in green and wore a high, peaked green hat upon  his head and green spectacles over his eyes. Bowing before the Pumpkinhead  he said:    \"I am the Guardian of the Gates of the Emerald        66  City. May I inquire who you are, and what is your business?\"    \"My name is Jack Pumpkinhead,\" returned the other, smilingly; \"but as to my  business, I haven't the least idea in the world what it is.\"    The Guardian of the Gates looked surprised, and shook his head as if  dissatisfied with the reply.    \"What are you, a man or a pumpkin?\" he asked, politely.    \"Both, if you please,\" answered Jack.    \"And this wooden horse--is it alive?\" questioned the Guardian.    The horse rolled one knotty eye upward and winked at Jack. Then it gave a  prance and brought one leg down on the Guardian's toes.    \"Ouch!\" cried the man; \"I'm sorry I asked that question. But the answer is  most convincing. Have you any errand, sir, in the Emerald City?\"    \"It seems to me that I have,\" replied the Pumpkinhead, seriously; \"but I  cannot think what it is. My father knows all about it, but he is not here.\"    \"This is a strange affair very strange!\" declared the Guardian. \"But you  seem harmless. Folks do not smile so delightfully when they mean mischief.\"    \"As for that,\" said Jack, \"I cannot help my smile, for it is carved on my  face with a jack-knife.\"        67    \"Well, come with me into my room,\" resumed the Guardian, \"and I will see  what can be done for you.\"    So Jack rode the Saw-Horse through the gateway into a little room built into  the wall. The Guardian pulled a bell-cord, and presently a very tall  soldier--clothed in a green uniform--entered from the opposite door. This  soldier carried a long green gun over his shoulder and had lovely green  whiskers that fell quite to his knees. The Guardian at once addressed him,  saying:    \"Here is a strange gentleman who doesn't know why he has come to the Emerald  City, or what he wants. Tell me, what shall we do with him?\"    The Soldier with the Green Whiskers looked at Jack with much care and  curiosity. Finally he shook his head so positively that little waves rippled  down his whiskers, and then he said:    \"I must take him to His Majesty, the Scarecrow.\"    But what will His Majesty, the Scarecrow, do with him?\" asked the Guardian  of the Gates.    \"That is His Majesty's business,\" returned the soldier. \"I have troubles  enough of my own. All outside troubles must be turned over to His Majesty.  So put the spectacles on this fellow, and I'll take him to the royal  palace.\"        68    So the Guardian opened a big box of spectacles and tried to fit a pair to  Jack's great round eyes.    \"I haven't a pair in stock that will really cover those eyes up,\" said the  little man, with a sigh; \"and your head is so big that I shall be obliged to  tie the spectacles on.\"    \"But why need I wear spectacles?\" asked Jack.    \"It's the fashion here,\" said the Soldier, \"and they will keep you from  being blinded by the glitter and glare of the gorgeous Emerald City.\"    \"Oh!\" exclaimed Jack. \"Tie them on, by all means. I don't wish to be  blinded.\"    \"Nor I!\" broke in the Saw-Horse; so a pair of green spectacles was quickly  fastened over the bulging knots that served it for eyes.    Then the Soldier with the Green Whiskers led them through the inner gate and  they at once found themselves in the main street of the magnificent Emerald  City.    Sparkling green gems ornamented the fronts of the beautiful houses and the  towers and turrets were all faced with emeralds. Even the green marble  pavement glittered with precious stones, and it was indeed a grand and  marvelous sight to one who beheld it for the first time.    However, the Pumpkinhead and the Saw-Horse,        69  knowing nothing of wealth and beauty, paid little attention to the wonderful  sights they saw through their green spectacles. They calmly followed after  the green soldier and scarcely noticed the crowds of green people who stared  at them in surprise. When a green dog ran out and barked at them the Saw-  Horse promptly kicked at it with its wooden leg and sent the little animal  howling into one of the houses; but nothing more serious than this happened  to interrupt their progress to the royal palace.    The Pumpkinhead wanted to ride up the green marble steps and straight into  the Scarecrow's presence; but the soldier would not permit that. So Jack  dismounted, with much difficulty, and a servant led the Saw-Horse around to  the rear while the Soldier with the Green Whiskers escorted the Pumpkinhead  into the palace, by the front entrance.    The stranger was left in a handsomely furnished waiting room while the  soldier went to announce him. It so happened that at this hour His Majesty  was at leisure and greatly bored for want of something to do, so he ordered  his visitor to be shown at once into his throne room.    Jack felt no fear or embarrassment at meeting the ruler of this magnificent  city, for he was entirely ignorant of all worldly customs. But when he en-        70  tered the room and saw for the first time His Majesty the Scarecrow seated  upon his glittering throne, he stopped short in amazement.                        Line-Art Drawing        71               His Majesty the Scarecrow      I suppose every reader of this book knows what a scarecrow is; but Jack  Pumpkinhead, never having seen such a creation, was more surprised at  meeting the remarkable King of the Emerald City than by any other one  experience of his brief life.    His Majesty the Scarecrow was dressed in a suit of faded blue clothes, and  his head was merely a small sack stuffed with straw, upon which eyes, ears,  a nose and a mouth had been rudely painted to represent a face. The clothes  were also stuffed with straw, and that so unevenly or carelessly that his  Majesty's legs and arms seemed more bumpy than was necessary. Upon his hands  were gloves with long fingers, and these were padded with cotton. Wisps of  straw stuck out from the monarch's        72  coat and also from his neck and boot-tops. Upon his head he wore a heavy  golden crown set thick with sparkling jewels, and the weight of this crown  caused his brow to sag in wrinkles, giving a thoughtful"]]]
