The  preacher was pretty tired of all this, and seeing no  prospect of being asked to partake with the family, and  tolerably sharp set, he asked one of the boys to fetch  him his horse out of the barn. When he was taking leave  of the Elder, (there were several folks by at the time,)  says he, Elder Thomson, you have a fine farm here, a very  fine farm, indeed; you have a large Ox too, a very large  Ox; and I think, said he, I've seen to-day, (turning and  looking him full in the face, for he intended to hit him  pretty hard,) I think I have seen to-day the greatest  hag I ever saw in my life. The neighbours snickered a  good deal, and the Elder felt pretty streaked. I guess  he'd give his great Pig or his great Ox either, if that  story had'nt got wind.          No. VII    Go Ahead.    When we resumed our conversation, the Clockmaker said,  \"I guess we are the greatest nation on the face of the  airth, and the most enlightened too.\" This was rather  too arrogant to pass unnoticed, and I was about replying,  that whatever doubts there might be on that subject,  there could be none whatever that they were the most  MODEST; when he continued \"we go ahead,\" the Novascotians  go \"astarn.\" Our ships go ahead of the ships of other  folks, our steam boats beat the British in speed, and so  do our stage coaches; and I reckon a real right down New  York trotter might stump the univarse for going \"ahead.\"  But since we introduced the Rail Roads if we don't go  \"ahead\" its a pity. We never fairly knew what going the  whole hog was till then; we actilly went ahead of ourselves,  and that's no easy matter I tell you. If they only had  edication here, they might learn to do so too, but they  don't know nothin. You undervalue them, said I, they have  their College and Academies, their grammar schools and  primary institutions, and I believe there are few among  them who cannot read and write.    I guess all that's nothin, said he. As for Latin and  Greek, we don't valy it a cent; we teach it, and so  we do painting and music, because the English do, and  we like to go ahead on em, even in them are things. As  for reading, its well enough for them that has nothing  to do, and writing is plaguy apt to bring a man to  States-prison, particularly if he writes his name so  like another man as to have it mistaken for his'n.  Cyphering is the thing--if a man knows how to cypher,  he is sure to grow rich. We are a 'calculating' people,  we all cypher.    A horse that wont go ahead, is apt to run back, and the  more you whip him the faster he goes astarn. That's jist  the way with the Nova Scotians; they have been running back  so fast lately, that they have tumbled over a BANK or two,  and nearly broke their necks; and now they've got up and  shook themselves, they swear their dirty clothes and bloody  noses are all owing to the BANKS. I guess if they wont look  ahead for the future, they'll larn to look behind, and see  if there's a bank near hand em.    A Bear always goes down a tree STARN FOREMOST. He is a  cunning critter, he knows tante safe to carry a heavy  load over his head, and his rump is so heavy, he don't  like to trust it over hisn, for fear it might take a  lurch, and carry him heels over head, to the ground; so  he lets his starn down first, and his head arter. I wish  the Blue Noses would find as good an excuse in their  rumps for running backwards as he has. But the bear  'CYPHERS;' he knows how many pounds his hams weigh, and  he 'CALCULATES' if he carried them up in the air, they  might be top heavy for him.    If we had this Province we'd go to work and 'cypher' right  off. Halifax is nothing without a river or back country;  add nothing to nothing, and I guess you have nothing  still--add a Rail Road to the Bay of Fundy, and how much  do you get? That requires cyphering--it will cost $300,000,  or 75,000 pounds your money--add for notions omitted in  the addition column, one third, and it makes even money  --100,000 pounds. Interest at 5 per cent 5,000 pounds a  year. Now turn over the slate and count up freight--I  make it upwards of 25,000 pounds a year. If I had you at  the desk, I'd shew you a bill of items.    Now comes \"SUBTRACTION,\" deduct cost of engines, wear  and tear, and expenses, and what not, and reduce it for  shortness down to 5,000 pounds a year, the amount of  interest. What figures have you got now? you have an  investment that pays interest, I guess, and if it don't  pay more then I don't know chalk from cheese. But suppose  it don't, and that it only yields two and a half per  cent, (and it requires good cyphering, I tell you, to  say how it would act with folks that like going astarn  better than going ahead,) what would them are wise ones  say then? Why the critters would say it wont pay; but I  say the sum ant half stated. Can you count in your head?  Not to any extent, said I. Well, that's an etarnal pity,  said the Clockmaker, for I should like to show you Yankee  Cyphering. What is the entire real estate of Halifax  worth, at a valeation? I really cannot say. Ah, said he,  I see you don't cypher, and Latin and Greek wont do; them  are people had no rail-roads. Well, find out, and then  only add ten per cent to it, for increased value, and if  it don't give the cost of a rail-road, then my name is  not Sam Slick. Well, the land between Halifax and Ardoise  is worth --- nothing, add 5 per cent to that, and send  the sum to the College, and ax the students how much it  comes to. But when you get into Hants County, I guess  you have land worth coming all the way from Boston to  see. His Royal Highness the King, I guess, hasn't got  the like in his dominions. Well, add 15 per cent to all  them are lands that border on Windsor Basin, and 5 per  cent to what butts on Basin of Mines, and then, what do  you get? A pretty considerable sum I tell you--but its  no use to give you the CHALKS, if you can't keep the  TALLIES. Now we will lay down the schoolmaster's assistant,  and take up another book every bit and grain as good as  that, although these folks affect to sneer at it--I mean  human natur. Ah! said I, a knowledge of that was of  great service to you, certainly, in the sale of your  clock to the old Deacon: let us see how it will assist  you now. What does a clock want that's run down? said  he. Undoubtedly to be wound up, I replied; I guess you've  hit it this time. The folks of Halifax have run down,  and they'll never go to all eternity, till they are wound  up into motion: the works are all good, and it is plaguy  well cased and set--it only wants a KEY. Put this railroad  into operation, and the activity it will inspire into  business, the new life it will give the place, will  surprise you. Its like lifting a child off its crawling,  and putting him on his legs to run--see how the little  critter goes ahead arter that. A kurnel, (I don't mean  a Kurnel of militia, for we don't valy that breed o'  cattle nothing--they do nothing but strut about and  screech all day, like peacocks,) but a kurnel of grain,  when sowed, will stool into several shoots, and each  shoot hear many kurnels, and will multiply itself thus  --4 times 1 is 4, and 4 times 25 is a hundred, (you see  all natur cyphers, except the Blue Noses.) Jist so, this  here rail-road will not perhaps beget other rail-roads,  but it will beget a spirit of enterprise, that will beget  other useful improvements. It will enlarge the sphere  and the means of trade, open new sources of traffic and  supply--develop resources--and what is of more value  perhaps than all--beget motion. It will teach the folks  that go astarn or stand stock still, like the statehouse  in Boston, (though they do say the foundation of that  has moved a little this summer) not only to go \"AHEAD,\"  BUT TO NULLIFY TIME AND SPACE.    Here his horse (who, feeling the animation of his master,  had been restive of late) set off at a most prodigious  rate of trotting. It was some time before he was reined  up. When I overtook him, the Clockmaker said, \"this old  Yankee horse, you see, understands our word 'go ahead'  better nor these Blue Noses.\"    What is it, he continued, what is it that 'fetters' the  heels of a young country, and hangs like 'a poke' around  its neck? what retards the cultivation of its soil, and  the improvement of its fisheries?--the high price of  labor, I guess. Well, what's a rail-road? The substitution  of mechanical for human and animal labor, on a scale as  grand as our great country. Labor is dear in America,  and cheap in Europe. A rail-road, therefore, is  comparatively no manner of use to them, to what it is to  us--it does wonders there, but it works miracles here.  There it makes the old man younger, but here it makes a  child a giant. To us it is river, bridge, road and canal,  all one. It saves what we han't got to spare, men,  horses, carts, vessels, barges, and what's all in all--time.    Since the creation of the Univarse, I guess it's the  greatest invention, arter man. Now this is what I call  \"cyphering\" arter human natur, while figures are cyphering  arter \"the assistant.\" These two sorts of cyphering make  idecation--and you may depend on't Squire, there is  nothing like folks cyphering, if they want to \"go ahead.\"          No. VIII    The Preacher that Wandered from His Text.    I guess, said the Clockmaker, we know more of Nova Scotia  than the Blue Noses themselves do. The Yankees see further  ahead than most folks; they can een a most see round  t'other side of a thing; indeed some on them have hurt  their eyes by it, and sometimes I think that's the reason  such a sight of them wear spectacles. The first I ever  heerd tell of Cumberland was from Mr. Everett of Congress;  he know'd as much about it as if he had lived here all  his days, and may be a little grain"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/582"],[0,"A Collection of Beatrix Potter Stories (#6)"],[1,"l. The rest of the line, with a hook at the end,  remained in his hand.    Tommy Brock snored conscientiously. Mr. Tod stood and looked at him for  a minute; then he left the room again.    Tommy Brock opened both eyes, and looked at the rope and grinned. There  was a noise outside the window. Tommy Brock shut his eyes in a hurry.    Mr. Tod had gone out at the front door, and round to the back of the  house. On the way, he stumbled over the rabbit burrow. If he had had any  idea who was inside it, he would have pulled them out quickly.    His foot went through the tunnel nearly upon the top of Peter Rabbit and  Benjamin, but fortunately he thought that it was some more of Tommy  Brock's work.    He took up the coil of line from the sill, listened for a moment, and  then tied the rope to a tree.    Tommy Brock watched him with one eye, through the window. He was  puzzled.    Mr. Tod fetched a large heavy pailful of water from the spring, and  staggered with it through the kitchen into his bedroom.    Tommy Brock snored industriously, with rather a snort.    Mr. Tod put down the pail beside the bed, took up the end of rope with  the hook--hesitated, and looked at Tommy Brock. The snores were almost  apoplectic; but the grin was not quite so big.    Mr. Tod gingerly mounted a chair by the head of the bedstead. His legs  were dangerously near to Tommy Brock's teeth.    He reached up and put the end of rope, with the hook, over the head of  the tester bed, where the curtains ought to hang.    (Mr. Tod's curtains were folded up, and put away, owing to the house  being unoccupied. So was the counterpane. Tommy Brock was covered with a  blanket only.) Mr. Tod standing on the unsteady chair looked down upon  him attentively; he really was a first prize sound sleeper!    It seemed as though nothing would waken him--not even the flapping rope  across the bed.    Mr. Tod descended safely from the chair, and endeavoured to get up again  with the pail of water. He intended to hang it from the hook, dangling  over the head of Tommy Brock, in order to make a sort of shower-bath,  worked by a string, through the window.    But naturally being a thin-legged person (though vindictive and sandy  whiskered)--he was quite unable to lift the heavy weight to the level of  the hook and rope. He very nearly overbalanced himself.    The snores became more and more apoplectic. One of Tommy Brock's hind  legs twitched under the blanket, but still he slept on peacefully.    Mr. Tod and the pail descended from the chair without accident. After  considerable thought, he emptied the water into a wash-basin and jug.  The empty pail was not too heavy for him; he slung it up wobbling over  the head of Tommy Brock.    Surely there never was such a sleeper! Mr. Tod got up and down, down and  up on the chair.    As he could not lift the whole pailful of water at once, he fetched a  milk jug, and ladled quarts of water into the pail by degrees. The pail  got fuller and fuller, and swung like a pendulum. Occasionally a drop  splashed over; but still Tommy Brock snored regularly and never  moved,--except one eye.    At last Mr. Tod's preparations were complete. The pail was full of  water; the rope was tightly strained over the top of the bed, and across  the window sill to the tree outside.    \"It will make a great mess in my bedroom; but I could never sleep in  that bed again without a spring cleaning of some sort,\" said Mr. Tod.    Mr. Tod took a last look at the badger and softly left the room. He went  out of the house, shutting the front door. The rabbits heard his  footsteps over the tunnel.    He ran round behind the house, intending to undo the rope in order to  let fall the pailful of water upon Tommy Brock--    \"I will wake him up with an unpleasant surprise,\" said Mr. Tod.    The moment he had gone, Tommy Brock got up in a hurry; he rolled Mr.  Tod's dressing-gown into a bundle, put it into the bed beneath the pail  of water instead of himself, and left the room also--grinning immensely.    He went into the kitchen, lighted the fire and boiled the kettle; for  the moment he did not trouble himself to cook the baby rabbits.    When Mr. Tod got to the tree, he found that the weight and strain had  dragged the knot so tight that it was past untying. He was obliged to  gnaw it with his teeth. He chewed and gnawed for more than twenty  minutes. At last the rope gave way with such a sudden jerk that it  nearly pulled his teeth out, and quite knocked him over backwards.    Inside the house there was a great crash and splash, and the noise of a  pail rolling over and over.    But no screams. Mr. Tod was mystified; he sat quite still, and listened  attentively. Then he peeped in at the window. The water was dripping  from the bed, the pail had rolled into a corner.    In the middle of the bed under the blanket, was a wet flattened  SOMETHING--much dinged in, in the middle where the pail had caught it  (as it were across the tummy). Its head was covered by the wet blanket  and it was NOT SNORING ANY LONGER.    There was nothing stirring, and no sound except the drip, drop, drop  drip of water trickling from the mattress.    Mr. Tod watched it for half an hour; his eyes glistened.    Then he cut a caper, and became so bold that he even tapped at the  window; but the bundle never moved.    Yes--there was no doubt about it--it had turned out even better than he  had planned; the pail had hit poor old Tommy Brock, and killed him dead!    \"I will bury that nasty person in the hole which he has dug. I will  bring my bedding out, and dry it in the sun,\" said Mr. Tod.    \"I will wash the tablecloth and spread it on the grass in the sun to  bleach. And the blanket must be hung up in the wind; and the bed must be  thoroughly disinfected, and aired with a warming-pan; and warmed with a  hot-water bottle.\"    \"I will get soft soap, and monkey soap, and all sorts of soap; and soda  and scrubbing brushes; and persian powder; and carbolic to remove the  smell. I must have a disinfecting. Perhaps I may have to burn sulphur.\"    He hurried round the house to get a shovel from the kitchen--\"First I  will arrange the hole--then I will drag out that person in the blanket  ...\"    He opened the door....    Tommy Brock was sitting at Mr. Tod's kitchen table, pouring out tea from  Mr. Tod's tea-pot into Mr. Tod's tea-cup. He was quite dry himself and  grinning; and he threw the cup of scalding tea all over Mr. Tod.    Then Mr. Tod rushed upon Tommy Brock, and Tommy Brock grappled with Mr.  Tod amongst the broken crockery, and there was a terrific battle all  over the kitchen. To the rabbits underneath it sounded as if the floor  would give way at each crash of falling furniture.    They crept out of their tunnel, and hung about amongst the rocks and  bushes, listening anxiously.    Inside the house the racket was fearful. The rabbit babies in the oven  woke up trembling; perhaps it was fortunate they were shut up inside.    Everything was upset except the kitchen table.    And everything was broken, except the mantelpiece and the kitchen  fender. The crockery was smashed to atoms.    The chairs were broken, and the window, and the clock fell with a crash,  and there were handfuls of Mr. Tod's sandy whiskers.    The vases fell off the mantelpiece, the canisters fell off the shelf;  the kettle fell off the hob. Tommy Brock put his foot in a jar of  raspberry Jam.    And the boiling water out of the kettle fell upon the tail of Mr. Tod.    When the kettle fell, Tommy Brock, who was still grinning, happened to  be uppermost; and he rolled Mr. Tod over and over like a log, out at the  door.    Then the snarling and worrying went on outside; and they rolled over the  bank, and down hill, bumping over the rocks. There will never be any  love lost between Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.    As soon as the coast was clear Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny came out  of the bushes--    \"Now for it! Run in, Cousin Benjamin! Run in and get them while I watch  at the door.\"    But Benjamin was frightened--    \"Oh; oh! they are coming back!\"    \"No they are not.\"    \"Yes they are!\"    \"What dreadful bad language! I think they have fallen down the stone  quarry.\"    Still Benjamin hesitated, and Peter kept pushing him--    \"Be quick, it's all right. Shut the oven door, Cousin Benjamin, so that  he won't miss them.\"    Decidedly there were lively doings in Mr. Tod's kitchen!    At home in the rabbit hole, things had not been quite comfortable.    After quarrelling at supper, Flopsy and old Mr. Bouncer had passed a  sleepless night, and quarrelled again at breakfast. Old Mr. Bouncer  could no longer deny that he had invited company into the rabbit hole;  but he refused to reply to the questions and reproaches of Flopsy. The  day passed heavily.    Old Mr. Bouncer, very sulky, was huddled up in a corner, barricaded with  a chair. Flopsy had taken away his pipe and hidden the tobacco. She had  been having a complete turn out and spring-cleaning, to relieve her  feelings. She had just finished. Old Mr. Bouncer, behind his chair, was  wondering anxiously what she would do next.    In Mr. Tod's kitchen, amongst the wreckage, Benjamin Bunny picked his  way to the oven nervously, through a thick cloud of dust. He opened the  oven door, felt inside, and found something warm and wriggling. He  lifted it out carefully, and rejoined Peter Rabbit.    \"I've got them! Can we get away? Shall we hide, Cousin Peter?\"    Peter pricked his ears; distant sounds of fighting still echoed in the  wood.    Five minutes afterwards two breathless rabbits came scuttering away down  Bull Banks, half carrying half dragging a sack between them, bumpetty  bump over the grass. They reached home safely and burst into the rabbit  hole.    Great was old Mr. Bouncer's relief and Flopsy's joy when Peter and  Benjamin arrived in triumph with the young family. The rabbit-babies  were rather tumbled and very hungry; they were fed and"]]]
