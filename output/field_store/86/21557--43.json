So I shall  not be disappointed if this man says the same thing. I shall go to  him, anyhow.\"    Then one of the three men said, \"Let us go with this man, and see  what the beggar will buy.\"    \"Pshaw!\" said another; \"buy! You talk foolishly. He has not had a  good meal in three years, to my knowledge; and a man in his condition  doesn't have money to buy gazelles. However, let's go; and if he  makes this poor countryman carry his load over there just for the  fun of looking at the gazelles, let each of us give him a good hard  whack with our walking-sticks, to teach him how to behave toward  honest merchants.\"    So, when they came near him, one of those three men said: \"Well,  here are the gazelles; now buy one. Here they are, you old hypocrite;  you'll feast your eyes on them, but you can't buy them.\"    But Haamdaanee, paying no attention to the men, said to Moohaadeem,  \"How much for one of your gazelles?\"    Then another of those men broke in: \"You're very innocent, aren't  you? You know, as well as I do, that gazelles are sold every day at  two for a quarter.\"    Still taking no notice of these outsiders, Haamdaanee continued,  \"I'd like to buy one for a dime.\"    \"One for a dime!\" laughed the men; \"of course you'd like to buy one  for a dime. Perhaps you'd also like to have the dime to buy with.\"    Then one of them gave him a push on the cheek.    At this Haamdaanee turned and said: \"Why do you push me on the cheek,  when I've done nothing to you? I do not know you. I call this man,  to transact some business with him, and you, who are strangers,  step in to spoil our trade.\"    He then untied the knot in the corner of his ragged coat, produced  the dime, and, handing it to Moohaadeem, said, \"Please, good man,  let me have a gazelle for that.\"    At this, the countryman took a small gazelle out of the cage and  handed it to him, saying, \"Here, master, take this one. I call it  Keejee'paa.\" Then turning to those three men, he laughed, and said:  \"Ehe! How's this? You, with your white robes, and turbans, and swords,  and daggers, and sandals on your feet--you gentlemen of property,  and no mistake--you told me this man was too poor to buy anything;  yet he has bought a gazelle for a dime, while you fine fellows,  I think, haven't enough money among you to buy half a gazelle, if  they were five cents each.\"    Then Moohaadeem and the three men went their several ways.    As for Haamdaanee, he stayed at the dust heap until he found a few  grains of millet for himself and a few for Keejeepaa, the gazelle,  and then went to his hut, spread his sleeping mat, and he and the  gazelle slept together.    This going to the dust heap for a few grains of millet and then going  home to bed continued for about a week.    Then one night Haamdaanee was awakened by some one calling,  \"Master!\" Sitting up, he answered: \"Here I am. Who calls?\" The gazelle  answered, \"I do!\"    Upon this, the beggar man became so scared that he did not know  whether he should faint or get up and run away.    Seeing him so overcome, Keejeepaa asked, \"Why, master, what's the  matter?\"    \"Oh, gracious!\" he gasped; \"what a wonder I see!\"    \"A wonder?\" said the gazelle, looking all around; \"why, what is this  wonder, that makes you act as if you were all broken up?\"    \"Why, it's so wonderful, I can hardly believe I'm awake!\" said his  master. \"Who in the world ever before knew of a gazelle that could  speak?\"    \"Oho!\" laughed Keejeepaa; \"is that all? There are many more wonderful  things than that. But now, listen, while I tell you why I called you.\"    \"Certainly; I'll listen to every word,\" said the man. \"I can't help  listening!\"    \"Well, you see, it's just this way,\" said Keejeepaa; \"I've allowed you  to become my master, and I can not run away from you; so I want you to  make an agreement with me, and I will make you a promise, and keep it.\"    \"Say on,\" said his master.    \"Now,\" continued the gazelle, \"one doesn't have to be acquainted  with you long, in order to discover that you are very poor. This  scratching a few grains of millet from the dust heap every day,  and managing to subsist upon them, is all very well for you--you're  used to it, because it's a matter of necessity with you; but if I  keep it up much longer, you won't have any gazelle--Keejeepaa will  die of starvation. Therefore, I want to go away every day and feed  on my own kind of food; and I promise you I will return every evening.\"    \"Well, I guess I'll have to give my consent,\" said the man, in no  very cheerful tone.    As it was now dawn, Keejeepaa jumped up and ran out of the door,  Haamdaanee following him. The gazelle ran very fast, and his master  stood watching him until he disappeared. Then tears started in the  man's eyes, and, raising his hands, he cried, \"Oh, my mother!\" Then  he cried, \"Oh, my father!\" Then he cried, \"Oh, my gazelle! It has  run away!\"    Some of his neighbors, who heard him carrying on in this manner,  took the opportunity to inform him that he was a fool, an idiot,  and a dissipated fellow.    Said one of them: \"You hung around that dust heap, goodness knows  how long, scratching like a hen, till fortune gave you a dime. You  hadn't sense enough to go and buy some decent food; you had to buy  a gazelle. Now you've let the creature run away. What are you crying  about? You brought all your trouble on yourself.\"    All this, of course, was very comforting to Haamdaanee, who slunk  off to the dust heap, got a few grains of millet, and came back to  his hut, which now seemed meaner and more desolate than ever.    At sunset, however, Keejeepaa came trotting in; and the beggar was  happy again, and said, \"Ah, my friend, you have returned to me.\"    \"Of course,\" said the gazelle; \"didn't I promise you? You see, I feel  that when you bought me you gave all the money you had in the world,  even though it was only a dime. Why, then, should I grieve you? I  couldn't do it. If I go and get myself some food, I'll always come  back evenings.\"    When the neighbors saw the gazelle come home every evening and run  off every morning, they were greatly surprised, and began to suspect  that Haamdaanee was a wizard.    Well, this coming and going continued for five days, the gazelle  telling its master each night what fine places it had been to, and  what lots of food it had eaten.    On the sixth day it was feeding among some thorn bushes in a thick  wood, when, scratching away some bitter grass at the foot of a big  tree, it saw an immense diamond of intense brightness.    \"Oho!\" said Keejeepaa, in great astonishment; \"here's property, and no  mistake! This is worth a kingdom! If I take it to my master he will  be killed; for, being a poor man, if they say to him, 'Where did you  get it?' and he answers, 'I picked it up,' they will not believe him;  if he says, 'It was given to me,' they will not believe him either. It  will not do for me to get my master into difficulties. I know what  I'll do. I'll seek some powerful person; he will use it properly.\"    So Keejeepaa started off through the forest, holding the diamond in  his mouth, and ran, and ran, but saw no town that day; so he slept  in the forest, and arose at dawn and pursued his way. And the second  day passed like the first.    On the third day the gazelle had traveled from dawn until between  eight and nine o'clock, when he began to see scattered houses, getting  larger in size, and knew he was approaching a town. In due time he  found himself in the main street of a large city, leading direct  to the sultan's palace, and began to run as fast as he could. People  passing along stopped to look at the strange sight of a gazelle running  swiftly along the main street with something wrapped in green leaves  between its teeth.    The sultan was sitting at the door of his palace, when Keejeepaa,  stopping a little way off, dropped the diamond from its mouth,  and, lying down beside it, panting, called out: \"Ho, there! Ho,  there!\" which is a cry every one makes in that part of the world when  wishing to enter a house, remaining outside until the cry is answered.    After the cry had been repeated several times, the sultan said to  his attendants, \"Who is doing all that calling?\"    And one answered, \"Master, it's a gazelle that's calling, 'Ho, there!'\"    \"Ho-ho!\" said the sultan; \"Ho-ho! Invite the gazelle to come near.\"    Then three attendants ran to Keejeepaa and said: \"Come, get up. The  sultan commands you to come near.\"    So the gazelle arose, picked up the diamond, and, approaching  the sultan, laid the jewel at his feet, saying, \"Master, good  afternoon!\" To which the sultan replied: \"May God make it good! Come  near.\"    The sultan ordered his attendants to bring a carpet and a large  cushion, and desired the gazelle to rest upon them. When it protested  that it was comfortable as it was, he insisted, and Keejeepaa had  to allow himself to be made a very honored guest. Then they brought  milk and rice, and the sultan would hear nothing until the gazelle  had fed and rested.    At last, when everything had been disposed of, the sultan said,  \"Well, now, my friend, tell me what news you bring.\"    And Keejeepaa said: \"Master, I don't exactly know how you will like  the news I bring. The fact is, I'm sent here to insult you! I've come  to try and pick a quarrel with you! In fact, I'm here to propose a  family alliance with you!\"    At this the sultan exclaimed: \"Oh, come! for a gazelle,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3751"],[0,"The Psychology of Beauty (#6)"],[1,"just this immediate application of a  philosophical definition to concrete cases.  Who but an Hegelian  philosopher, cries Professor James, ever pretended that reason  in action was per se a sufficient explanation of the political  changes in Europe?  Who but an Hegelian philosopher, he might  add, ever pretended that \"the expression of the Idea to Sense\"  was a sufficient explanation of the Sistine Madonna?  But I  think the Hegelian--or other--philosopher might answer that he  had no need so to pretend.  Such a philosophical definition,  as I hope to show, cannot possibly apply to particular cases,  and should not be expected to do so.    Beauty is an excellence, a standard, a value.  But value is  in its nature teleological; is of the nature of purpose.  Anything ha value because it fulfills an end, because it is  good for something in the world.  A thing is not beautiful  because it has value,--other things have that,--it has value  because it is beautiful, because it fulfills the end of Beauty.  Thus the metaphysical definition of Beauty must set forth what  this end of Beauty is,--what it serves in the universe.    But to determine what anything does, or fulfills, or exemplifies,  is not the same as to determine what it is in itself.  The most  that can be said is that the end, or function, shapes the means  or constitution.  The end is a logical imperative.  Beauty does,  and must do, such things.  To ask how, is at once to indicate  an ultimate departure from the philosophical point of view; for  the means to an end are different, and to be empirically  determined.    Now the constitution of Beauty can be only the means to the  end of Beauty,--that combination of qualities in the object  which will bring about the end fixed by philosophical definition.  The end is general; the means may be different kinds.  Evidently,  then, the philosophical definition cannot be applied directly to  the object until the possibilities, conditions, and limitations  of that object's fitness for the purpose assigned are known.  We  cannot ask, Does the Sistine Madonna express the Idea of Sense?  until we know all possibilities and conditions of the visual for  attaining that expression.  But, indeed, the consideration of  causes and effects suggests at once that natural science must  guide further investigation.  Philosophy must lay down what  Beauty has to do, but since it is in our experience of Beauty  that its end is accomplished, since the analysis of such  experience and the study of its contributing elements is a work  of the natural science of such experience--it would follow that psychology must deal with the various means through which this  end is to be reached.    Thus we see that Fechner's reproach is unjustified.  Those concepts  which are too general to apply to particular cases are not meant  to do so.  If a general concept expresses, as it should, the place  of Beauty in the hierarchy of metaphysical values, it is for the  psychologist of aesthetics to develop the means by which that end  can be reached in the various realms in which works of art are  found.    Nor can we agree with Santayana's dictum<1> that philosophical  aesthetics confuses the import of an experience with the  explanation of its cause.  It need not.  The aesthetic experience  is indeed caused by the beautiful object, but the beautiful object  itself is caused by the possibility of the aesthetic experience,--  beauty as an end under the conditions of human perception.  Thus  the Nature of Beauty is related to its import, or meaning, or  end, as means to that end; and therefore the import of an  experience may well point out to us the constitution of the cause  of that experience.  A work of art, a piece of nature, is judged  by its degree of attainment to that end; the explanation of its  beauty--of its degree of attainment, that is--is found in the  effect of its elements, according to psychological laws, on the  aesthetic subject.    <1> The Sense of Beauty, 1898. Intro.    Such a psychological study of the means by which the end of  Beauty is attained is the only method by which we can come to  an explanation of the wealth of concrete beauty.  The concept  of explanation, indeed, is valid only within the realm of  causes and effects.  The aim of aesthetics being conceded, as  above, to be the determination of the Nature of Beauty and the  explanation of our feelings about it, it is evident at this  point that the Nature of Beauty must be determined by philosophy;  but the general definition having been fixed, the meaning of the  work of art having been made clear, the only possible explanation  of our feelings about it--the aesthetic experience, in other  words--must be gained from psychology.  This method is not open  to the logical objections against the preceding.  No longer need  we ask what has a right to be included in the aesthetic experience.  That has been fixed by the definition of Beauty.  But how the  beautiful object brings about the aesthetic experience, the  boundaries of which are already known, is clearly matter for  psychology.    The first step must then be to win the philosophical definition  of Beauty.  It was Kant, says Hegel, who spoke the first rational  word concerning Beauty.  The study of his successors will reveal,  I believe, that the aesthetic of the great system of idealism  forms, on the whole, one identical doctrine.  It is worth while  to dwell somewhat on this point, because the traditional view of  the relation of the aesthetic of Kant, Schiller, Schelling, and  Hegel is otherwise.  Kant's starting-point was the discovery of  the normative, \"over-individual\" nature of Beauty, which we have  just found to be the secret of the contradictions of empirical  aesthetics.  Yet he came to it at the bidding of quite other  motives.    Kant's aesthetics was meant to serve as the keystone of the  arch between sense and reason.  The discovery of all that is  implicit in the experience of the senses had led him to deny  the possibility of knowledge beyond the matter of this experience.  Yet the reason has an inevitable tendency to press beyond this  limit, to seek all-embracing, absolute unities,--to conceive  an unconditioned totality.  Thus the reason presents us with  the ideas--beyond all possibility of knowledge--of the Soul,  the World, and God.  In the words of Kant, the Ideas of Reason  lead the understanding to the consideration of Nature according  to a principle of completeness, although it can never attain  to this.  Can there be a bridge across this abyss between sense  and reason? then asks Kant; which bridge he believes himself  to have found in the aesthetic faculty.  For on inquiring what  is involved in the judgment, \"This is beautiful,\" he discovers  that such a judgment is \"universal\" and \"necessary,\" inasmuch  as it implies that every normal spectator must acknowledge its  validity, that it is \"disinterested\" because it rests on the  \"appearance of the object without demanding its actual  existence,\" and that it is \"immediate\" or \"free,\" as it  acknowledges the object as beautiful without definite purpose,  as of adaptation to use.  But how does this judgment constitute  the desired bond between sense and reason?  Simply in that,  though applied to an object of the senses, it has yet all the  marks of the Idea of Reason,--it is universal, necessary, free,  unconditioned; it is judged as if it were perfect, and so  fulfills those demands of reason which elsewhere in the world  of sense are unsatisfied.    The two important factors, then, of Kant's aesthetics are its  reconciliation of sense and reason in beauty, and its reference  of the \"purposiveness\" of beauty to the cognitive faculty.    Schiller has been given the credit of transcending Kant's  \"subjective\" aesthetic through his emphasis on the significance  of the beautiful object.  It is not bound by a conception to  which it must attain, so that it is perceived as if it were  free.  Nor do we desire the reality of it to use for ourselves  or for others; so that we are free in relation to it.  It, the  object, is thus \"the vindication of freedom in the world of  phenomena,\" that world which is otherwise a binding necessity.  But it would seem that this had been already taught by Kant  himself, and that Schiller has but enlivened the subject by  his two illuminating phrases, \"aesthetic semblance\" and the  \"play-impulse,\" to denote the real object of the aesthetic  desire and the true nature of that desire; form instead of  material existence, and a free attitude instead of serious  purpose.  Still, his insistence on Beauty as the realization  of freedom may be said to have paved the way for Schelling's  theory, in which the aesthetic reaches its maximum of  importance.    The central thought of the Absolute Idealism of Schelling is  the underlying identity of Nature and the Self.  In Nature,  from matter up to the organism, the objective factor  predominates, or, in Schelling's phrase, the conscious self  is determined by the unconscious.  In morality, science, the  subjective factor predominates, or the unconscious is  determined by the conscious.  But the work of art is a natural  appearance and so unconscious, and is yet the product of a  conscious activity.  It gives, then, the equilibrium of the  real and ideal factors,--just that repose of reconciliation  or \"indifference\" which alone can show the Absolute.  But--  and this is of immense importance for our theory--in order  to explain the identity of subject and object, the Ego must  have an intuition, through which, in one and the same  appearance, it is in itself at once conscious and unconscious,  and this condition is given in the aesthetic experience.  The  beautiful is thus the solution of the riddle of the universe,  for it is the possibility of the explicit consciousness of  the unity of Nature and the Self--or the Absolute.    So Beauty is again the pivot on which "]]]
