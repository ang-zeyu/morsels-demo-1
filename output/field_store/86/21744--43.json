By and by two or three others  stroll up, and we all make measurements together. The general  opinion is that there has been a lot of rain in the night, and  that 43 in. in three weeks must be a record. But, anyhow, it is  fairly fine now, and what about a little lawn tennis? Or golf? Or  croquet? Or---? And so the arrangements for the morning are made.    And they can be made more readily out of doors; for--supposing it  is fine--the fresh air calls you to be doing something, and the  sight of the newly marked tennis lawn fills you with thoughts of  revenge for your accidental defeat the evening before. But  indoors it is so easy to drop into a sofa after breakfast, and,  once there with all the papers, to be disinclined to leave it  till lunch-time. A man or woman as lazy as this must not be  rushed. Say to such a one, \"Come and play,\" and the invitation  will be declined. Say, \"Come and look at the pond,\" and the worst  sluggard will not refuse such gentle exercise. And once he is out  he is out.    All this for those delightful summer days when there are fine  intervals; but consider the advantages of the pond when the rain  streams down in torrents from morning till night. How tired we  get of being indoors on these days, even with the best of books,  the pleasantest of companions, the easiest of billiard tables.  Yet if our hostess were to see us marching out with an umbrella,  how odd she would think us. \"Where are you off to?\" she would  ask, and we could only answer lamely, \"Er--I was just going to--  er--walk about a bit.\" But now we tell her brightly, \"I'm going  to see the pond. It must be nearly full. Won't you come too?\" And  with any luck she comes.  And you know, it even reconciles us a  little to these streaming days to reflect that it all goes to  fill the pond. For there is ever before our minds that great  moment in the future when the pond is at last full. What will  happen then? Aldenham may know, but we his guests do not. Some  think there will be merely a flood over the surrounding paths and  the kitchen garden, but for myself I believe that we are promised  something much bigger than that. A man with such a broad and  friendly outlook towards rain-gauges will be sure to arrange  something striking when the great moment arrives. Some sort of  fete will help to celebrate it, I have no doubt; with an open-air  play, tank drama, or what not. At any rate we have every hope  that he will empty the pond as speedily as possible so that we  may watch it fill again.    I must say that he has been a little lucky in his choice of a  year for inaugurating the pond. But, all the same, there are now  45 in. of rain in it, 45 in. of rain have fallen in the last  three weeks, and I think that something ought to be done about  it.          A Seventeenth-Century Story      There is a story in every name in that first column of The Times-  -Births, Marriages, and Deaths--down which we glance each  morning, but, unless the name is known to us, we do not bother  about the stories of other people. They are those not very  interesting people, our contemporaries. But in a country  churchyard a name on an old tombstone will set us wondering a  little. What sort of life came to an end there a hundred years  ago?    In the parish register we shall find the whole history of them;  when they were born, when they were married, how many children  they had, when they died--a skeleton of their lives which we can  clothe with our fancies and make living again. Simple lives, we  make them, in that pleasant countryside; \"Man comes and tills the  field and lies beneath\"; that is all. Simple work, simple  pleasures, and a simple death.    Of course we are wrong. There were passions and pains in those  lives; tragedies perhaps. The tombstones and the registers say  nothing of them; or, if they say it, it is in a cypher to which  we have not the key. Yet sometimes the key is almost in our  hands. Here is a story from the register of a village church--  four entries only, but they hide a tragedy which with a little  imagination we can almost piece together for ourselves.    The first entry is a marriage. John Meadowes of Littlehaw Manor,  bachelor, took Mary Field to wife (both of this parish) on 7th  November 1681.    There were no children of the marriage. Indeed, it only lasted a  year. A year later, on l2th November 1682, John died and was  buried.    Poor Mary Meadowes was now alone at the Manor. We picture her  sitting there in her loneliness, broken-hearted, refusing to be  comforted. ...    Until we come to the third entry. John has only been in his grave  a month, but here is the third entry, telling us that on l2th  December 1682, Robert Cliff, bachelor, was married to Mary  Meadowes, widow. It spoils our picture of her. ...    And then the fourth entry. It is the fourth entry which reveals  the tragedy, which makes us wonder what is the story hidden away  in the parish register of Littlehaw--the mystery of Littlehaw  Manor. For here is another death, the death of Mary Cliff, and  Mary Cliff died on ... l3th December 1682.    And she was buried in unconsecrated ground. For Mary Cliff (we  must suppose) had killed herself. She had killed herself on the  day after her marriage to her second husband.    Well, what is the story? We shall have to make it up for  ourselves. Here is my rendering of it. I have no means of finding  out if it is the correct one, but it seems to fit itself within  the facts as we know them.    Mary Field was the daughter of well-to-do parents, an only child,  and the most desirable bride, from the worldly point of view, in  the village. No wonder, then, that her parents' choice of a  husband for her fell upon the most desirable bridegroom of the  village--John Meadowes. The Fields' land adjoined Littlehaw  Manor; one day the child of John and Mary would own it all. Let a  marriage, then, be arranged.    But Mary loved Robert Cliff whole-heartedly --Robert, a man of no  standing at all. A ridiculous notion, said her parents, but the  silly girl would grow out of it. She was taken by a handsome  face. Once she was safely wedded to John, she would forget her  foolishness. John might not be handsome, but he was a solid,  steady fellow; which was more--much more, as it turned out--than  could be said for Robert.    So John and Mary married. But she still loved Robert. ...    Did she kill her husband? Did she and Robert kill him together?  Or did she only hasten his death by her neglect of him in some  illness? Did she dare him to ride some devil of a horse which she  knew he could not master; did she taunt him into some foolhardy  feat; or did she deliberately kill him--with or without her  lover's aid? I cannot guess, but of this I am certain. His death  was on her conscience. Directly or indirectly she was responsible  for it --or, at any rate, felt herself responsible for it. But  she would not think of it too closely; she had room for only one  thought in her mind. She was mistress of Littlehaw Manor now, and  free to marry whom she wished. Free, at last, to marry Robert.  Whatever had been done had been worth doing for that.    So she married him. And then--so I read the story--she discovered  the truth. Robert had never loved her. He had wanted to marry the  rich Miss Field, that was all. Still more, he had wanted to marry  the rich Mrs. Meadowes. He was quite callous about it. She might  as well know the truth now as later. It would save trouble in the  future, if she knew.    So Mary killed herself. She had murdered John for nothing.  Whatever her responsibility for John's death, in the bitterness  of that discovery she would call it murder. She had a murder on  her conscience for love's sake--and there was no love. What else  to do but follow John? ...    Is that the story? I wonder.          Our Learned Friends      I do not know why the Bar has always seemed the most respectable  of the professions, a profession which the hero of almost any  novel could adopt without losing caste. But so it is. A  schoolmaster can be referred to contemptuously as an usher; a  doctor is regarded humorously as a licensed murderer; a solicitor  is always retiring to gaol for making away with trust funds, and,  in any case, is merely an attorney; while a civil servant sleeps  from ten to four every day, and is only waked up at sixty in  order to be given a pension. But there is no humorous comment to  be made upon the barrister--unless it is to call him \"my learned  friend.\" He has much more right than the actor to claim to be a  member of the profession. I don't know why. Perhaps it is because  he walks about the Temple in a top-hat.    So many of one's acquaintances at some time or other have \"eaten  dinners\" that one hardly dares to say anything against the  profession. Besides, one never knows when one may not want to be  defended. However, I shall take the risk, and put the barrister  in the dock. \"Gentlemen of the jury, observe this well-dressed  gentleman before you. What shall we say about him?\"    Let us begin by asking ourselves what we expect from a  profession. In the first place, certainly, we expect a living,  but I think we want something more than that. If we were offered  a thousand a year to walk from Charing Cross to Barnet every day,  reasons of poverty might compel us to accept the offer, but we  should hardly be proud of our new profession. We should prefer to  earn a thousand a year by doing some more useful work. Indeed, to  a man of any fine feeling the profession of Barnet walking would  only be tolerable if he could persuade himself that by his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5805"],[0,"The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel (#6)"],[1,"  awful house, where--\"    She paused, and that quick look of furtive terror, which was so often to  be met with in the eyes of the timid these days, crept into her wrinkled  face.    \"Well, citizeness,\" Chauvelin rejoined quietly, \"why don't you proceed?  That awful house, you were saying. Where and what is that awful house of  which you speak?\"    \"The place kept by citizen Leridan, just by Bassin de l'Ourcq,\" the  woman murmured. \"You know it, citizen.\"    Chauvelin nodded. He was beginning to understand.    \"Well, now, tell me,\" he said, with that bland patience which had so oft  served him in good stead in his unavowable profession. \"Tell me. Last  year citizen Marat adopted--we'll say adopted--a child, whom he placed  in the Leridans' house on the Pantin road. Is that correct?\"    \"That is just how it is, citizen. And I--\"    \"One moment,\" he broke in somewhat more sternly, as the woman's  garrulity was getting on his nerves. \"As you say, I know the Leridans'  house. I have had cause to send children there myself. Children of  aristos or of fat bourgeois, whom it was our duty to turn into good  citizens. They are not pampered there, I imagine,\" he went on drily;  \"and if citizen Marat sent his--er--adopted son there, it was not with a  view to having him brought up as an aristo, what?\"    \"The child was not to be brought up at all,\" the woman said gruffly. \"I  have often heard citizen Marat say that he hoped the brat would prove a  thief when he grew up, and would take to alcoholism like a duck takes to  water.\"    \"And you know nothing of the child's parents?\"    \"Nothing, citizen. I had to go to Pantin once a month and have a look at  him and report to citizen Marat. But I always had the same tale to tell.  The child was looking more and more like a young reprobate every time I  saw him.\"    \"Did citizen Marat pay the Leridans for keeping the child?\"    \"Oh, no, citizen! The Leridans make a trade of the children by sending  them out to beg. But this one was not to be allowed out yet. Citizen  Marat's orders were very stern, and he was wont to terrify the Leridans  with awful threats of the guillotine if they ever allowed the child out  of their sight.\"    Chauvelin sat silent for a while. A ray of light had traversed the dark  and tortuous ways of his subtle brain. While he mused the woman became  impatient. She continued to talk on with the volubility peculiar to her  kind. He paid no heed to her, until one phrase struck his ear.    \"So now,\" Jeannette Marechal was saying, \"I don't know what to do. The  ring has disappeared, and the Leridans are suspicious.\"    \"The ring?\" queried Chauvelin curtly. \"What ring?\"    \"As I was telling you, citizen,\" she replied querulously, \"when I went  to see the child, the citizen Marat always gave me this ring to show to  the Leridans. Without I brought the ring they would not admit me inside  their door. They were so terrified with all the citizen's threats of the  guillotine.\"    \"And now you say the ring has disappeared. Since when?\"    \"Well, citizen,\" replied Jeannette blandly, \"since you took poor Paul  Mole into custody.\"    \"What do you mean?\" Chauvelin riposted. \"What had Paul Mole to do with  the child and the ring?\"    \"Only this, citizen, that he was to have gone to Pantin last night  instead of me. And thankful I was not to have to go. Citizen Marat gave  the ring to Mole, I suppose. I know he intended to give it to him. He  spoke to me about it just before that execrable woman came and murdered  him. Anyway, the ring has gone and Mole too. So I imagine that Mole has  the ring and--\"    \"That's enough!\" Chauvelin broke in roughly. \"You can go!\"    \"But, citizen--\"    \"You can go, I said,\" he reiterated sharply. \"The matter of the child  and the Leridans and the ring no longer concerns you. You understand?\"    \"Y--y--yes, citizen,\" murmured Jeannette, vaguely terrified.    And of a truth the change in citizen Chauvelin's demeanour was enough to  scare any timid creature. Not that he raved or ranted or screamed. Those  were not his ways. He still sat beside his desk as he had done before,  and his slender hand, so like the talons of a vulture, was clenched upon  the arm of his chair. But there was such a look of inward fury and of  triumph in his pale, deep-set eyes, such lines of cruelty around his  thin, closed lips, that Jeannette Marechal, even with the picture before  her mind of Jean Paul Marat in his maddest moods, fled, with the  unreasoning terror of her kind, before the sternly controlled, fierce  passion of this man.    Chauvelin never noticed that she went. He sat for a long time, silent  and immovable. Now he understood. Thank all the Powers of Hate and  Revenge, no thought of disappointment was destined to embitter the  overflowing cup of his triumph. He had not only brought his arch-enemy  to his knees, but had foiled one of his audacious ventures. How clear  the whole thing was! The false Paul Mole, the newly acquired menial in  the household of Marat, had wormed himself into the confidence of his  employer in order to wrest from him the secret of the aristo's child.  Bravo! bravo! my gallant Scarlet Pimpernel! Chauvelin now could see it  all. Tragedies such as that which had placed an aristo's child in the  power of a cunning demon like Marat were not rare these days, and  Chauvelin had been fitted by nature and by temperament to understand and  appreciate an execrable monster of the type of Jean Paul Marat.    And Paul Mole, the grimy, degraded servant of the indigent demagogue,  the loathsome mask which hid the fastidious personality of Sir Percy  Blakeney, had made a final and desperate effort to possess himself of  the ring which would deliver the child into his power. Now, having  failed in his machinations, he was safe under lock and key--guarded on  sight. The next twenty-four hours would see him unmasked, awaiting his  trial and condemnation under the scathing indictment prepared by  Fouquier-Tinville, the unerring Public Prosecutor. The day after that,  the tumbril and the guillotine for that execrable English spy, and the  boundless sense of satisfaction that his last intrigue had aborted in  such a signal and miserable manner.    Of a truth Chauvelin at this hour had every cause to be thankful, and it  was with a light heart that he set out to interview the Leridans.      VIII    The Leridans, anxious, obsequious, terrified, were only too ready to  obey the citizen Representative in all things.    They explained with much complacency that, even though they were  personally acquainted with Jeannette Marechal, when the citizeness  presented herself this very morning without the ring they had refused  her permission to see the brat.    Chauvelin, who in his own mind had already reconstructed the whole  tragedy of the stolen child, was satisfied that Marat could not have  chosen more efficient tools for the execution of his satanic revenge  than these two hideous products of revolutionary Paris.    Grasping, cowardly, and avaricious, the Leridans would lend themselves  to any abomination for a sufficiency of money; but no money on earth  would induce them to risk their own necks in the process. Marat had  obviously held them by threats of the guillotine. They knew the power of  the \"Friend of the People,\" and feared him accordingly. Chauvelin's  scarf of office, his curt, authoritative manner, had an equally  awe-inspiring effect upon the two miserable creatures. They became  absolutely abject, cringing, maudlin in their protestations of good-will  and loyalty. No one, they vowed, should as much as see the child--ring  or no ring--save the citizen Representative himself. Chauvelin, however,  had no wish to see the child. He was satisfied that its name was  Lannoy--for the child had remembered it when first he had been brought  to the Leridans. Since then he had apparently forgotten it, even though  he often cried after his \"Maman!\"    Chauvelin listened to all these explanations with some impatience. The  child was nothing to him, but the Scarlet Pimpernel had desired to  rescue it from out of the clutches of the Leridans; had risked his  all--and lost it--in order to effect that rescue! That in itself was a  sufficient inducement for Chauvelin to interest himself in the execution  of Marat's vengeance, whatever its original mainspring may have been.    At any rate, now he felt satisfied that the child was safe, and that the  Leridans were impervious to threats or bribes which might land them on  the guillotine.    All that they would own to was to being afraid.    \"Afraid of what?\" queried Chauvelin sharply.    That the brat may be kidnapped ... stolen. Oh! he could not be decoyed  ... they were too watchful for that! But apparently there were  mysterious agencies at work....    \"Mysterious agencies!\" Chauvelin laughed aloud at the suggestion. The  \"mysterious agency\" was even now rotting in an obscure cell at the  Abbaye. What other powers could be at work on behalf of the brat?    Well, the Leridans had had a warning!    What warning?    \"A letter,\" the man said gruffly. \"But as neither my wife nor I can  read--\"    \"Why did you not speak of this before?\" broke in Chauvelin roughly. \"Let  me see the letter.\"    The woman produced a soiled and dank scrap of paper from beneath her  apron. Of a truth she could not read its contents, for they were writ in  English in the form of a doggerel rhyme which caused Chauvelin to utter  a savage oath.    \"When did this come?\" he asked. \"And how?\"    \"This morning, citizen,\" the woman mumbled in reply. \"I found it outside  the door, with a stone on it to prevent the wind from blowing it away.  What does it mean, citizen?\" she went on, her voice shaking with terror,  for of a truth the citizen Representative looked as if he had seen some  weird and unearthly apparition.    He gave no reply for a moment or two, and the two catiffs had no  conception of the tremendous effort at self-control"]]]
