Apart from this, with heavy guns carrying with great accuracy,  and the facilities afforded by steam, we shall seldom hear, in the future,  of a fight at close quarters; skilful manoeuvring, impossible with a  sailing vessel, will doubtless be more in vogue.                   [Illustration: ROCKS NEAR CAPE ST. VINCENT.]    Meantime, the _Victory_ had not been idle. In conjunction with two of the  fleet, she had succeeded in silencing the _Salvador del Mundi_, a  first-rate of 112 guns. When, after the fight, Nelson went on board the  _Victory_, Sir John Jervis took him to his arms, and insisted that he  should keep the sword taken from the Spanish rear-admiral. When it was  hinted, during some private conversation, that Nelson's move was  unauthorised, Jervis had to admit the fact, but promised to forgive any  such breach of orders, accompanied with the same measure of success.    The battle had now lasted from noon, and at five p.m. four Spanish  line-of-battle vessels had lowered their colours. Even the great  _Santissima Trinidada_ might then have become a prize but for the return  of the vessels which had been cut off from the fleet in the morning, and  which alone saved her. Her colours had been shot away, and she had hoisted  English colours in token of submission, when the other ships came up, and  Cordova reconsidered his step. Jervis did not think that his fleet was  quite equal to a fresh conflict; and the Spaniards showed no desire to  renew the fight. They had lost on the four prizes, alone, 261 killed, and  342 wounded, and in all, probably, nearly double the above. The British  loss was seventy-three killed, and 227 wounded.    Of Trafalgar and of Nelson, both day and man so intimately associated with  our good ship, what can yet be said or sung that has gone unsaid,  unsung?--how when he left Portsmouth the crowds pressed forward to obtain  one last look at their hero--England's greatest hero--and \"knelt down before  him, and blessed him as he passed;\"(7) that beautiful prayer, indited in  his cabin, \"May the great God whom I worship grant to my country, and for  the benefit of Europe in general, a great and glorious victory, and may no  misconduct in any one tarnish it, and may humanity after victory be the  predominant feature of the British fleet,\" or the now historical signal  which flew from the mizen top-gallant mast of that noble old ship, and  which has become one of the grand mottoes of our tongue, are facts as  familiar to every reader as household words.    The part directly played by the _Victory_ herself in the battle of  Trafalgar was second to none. From the very first she received a raking  fire from all sides, which must have been indeed severe, when we find the  words extorted from Nelson, \"This is too warm work to last long,\"  addressed to Captain Hardy. At that moment fifty of his men were lying  dead or wounded, while the _Victory's_ mizen-mast and wheel were shot  away, and her sails hanging in ribbons. To the terrible cannonading of the  enemy, Nelson had not yet returned a shot. He had determined to be in the  very thick of the fight, and was reserving his fire. Now it was that  Captain Hardy represented to Nelson the impracticability of passing  through the enemy's line without running on board one of their ships; he  was coolly told to take his choice. The _Victory_ was accordingly turned  on board the _Redoubtable_, the commander of which, Captain Lucas, in a  resolute endeavour to block the passage, himself ran his bowsprit into the  figurehead of the _Bucentaure_, and the two vessels became locked  together. Not many minutes later, Captain Harvey, of the _Temeraire_,  seeing the position of the _Victory_ with her two assailants, fell on  board the _Redoubtable_, on the other side, so that these four ships  formed as compact a tier as though moored together. The _Victory_ fired  her middle and lower deck guns into the _Redoubtable_, which returned the  fire from her main-deck, employing also musketry and brass pieces of  larger size with most destructive effects from the tops.      \"_Redoubtable_ they called her--a curse upon her name!    'Twas from her tops the bullet that killed our hero came.\"    Within a few minutes of Lord Nelson's fall, several officers and about  forty men were either killed or wounded from this source. But a few  minutes afterwards the _Redoubtable_ fell on board the _Temeraire_, the  French ship's bowsprit passing over the British ship. Now came one of the  warmest episodes of the fight. The crew of the _Temeraire_ lashed their  vessel to their assailants' ship, and poured in a raking fire. But the  French captain, having discovered that--owing, perhaps, to the sympathy  exhibited for the dying hero on board the _Victory_, and her excessive  losses in men--her quarter-deck was quite deserted, now ordered an attempt  at boarding the latter. This cost our flag-ship the lives of Captain Adair  and eighteen men, but at the same moment the _Temeraire_ opened fire on  the _Redoubtable_ with such effect that Captain Lucas and 200 men were  themselves placed _hors de combat_.    In the contest we have been relating, the coolness of the _Victory's_ men  was signally evinced. \"When the guns on the lower deck were run out, their  muzzles came in contact with the sides of the _Redoubtable_, and now was  seen an astounding spectacle. Knowing that there was danger of the French  ship taking fire, the fireman of each gun on board the British ship stood  ready with a bucketful of water to dash into the hole made by the shot of  his gun--thus beautifully illustrating Nelson's prayer, 'that the British  might be distinguished by humanity in victory.' Less considerate than her  antagonist, the _Redoubtable_ threw hand-grenades from her tops, which,  falling on board herself, set fire to her, ... and the flame communicated  with the foresail of the _Temeraire_, and caught some ropes and canvas on  the booms of the _Victory_, risking the destruction of all; but by immense  exertions the fire was subdued in the British ships, whose crews lent  their assistance to extinguish the flames on board the _Redoubtable_, by  throwing buckets of water upon her chains and forecastle.\"(8)    Setting aside, for the purpose of clearness, the episode of the taking of  the _Fougueux_, which got foul of the _Temeraire_ and speedily  surrendered, we find, five minutes later, the main and mizen masts of the  _Redoubtable_ falling--the former in such a way across the _Temeraire_ that  it formed a bridge, over which the boarding-party passed and took quiet  possession. Captain Lucas had so stoutly defended his flag, that, out of a  crew of 643, only 123 were in a condition to continue the fight; 522 were  lying killed or wounded. The _Bucentaure_ soon met her fate, after being  defended with nearly equal bravery. The French admiral, Villeneuve, who  was on board, said bitterly, just before surrendering, \"_Le Bucentaure a  rempli sa tache; la mienne n'est pas encore achevee_.\"    Let the reader remember that the above are but a few episodes of the most  complete and glorious victory ever obtained in naval warfare. Without the  loss of one single vessel to the conqueror, more than half the ships of  the enemy were captured or destroyed, while the remainder escaped into  harbour to rot in utter uselessness. Twenty-one vessels were lost for ever  to France and Spain. It is to be hoped and believed that no such contest  will ever again be needed; but should it be needed, it will have to be  fought by very different means. The instance of four great ships locked  together, dealing death and destruction to each other, has never been  paralleled. Imagine that seething, fighting, dying mass of humanity, with  all the horrible concomitants of deafening noise and blinding smoke and  flashing fire! It is not likely ever to occur in modern warfare. The  commanders of steam-vessels of all classes will be more likely to fight at  out-manoeuvring and shelling each other than to come to close quarters,  which would generally mean blowing up together. It would be interesting to  consider how Nelson would have acted with, and opposed to, steam-frigates  and ironclads. He would, no doubt, have been as courageous and far-seeing  and rapid in action as ever, but hardly as reckless, or even daring.     [Illustration: THE \"VICTORY\" AT CLOSE QUARTERS WITH THE \"REDOUBTABLE.\"]      \"And still, though seventy years, boys,      Have gone, who, without pride,    Names his name--tells his fame      Who at Trafalgar died?\"    May we always have a Nelson in the hour of national need!    The day for such battles as this is over; there may be others as  gloriously fought, but never again by the same means. Ships, armaments,  and modes of attack and defence are, and will be, increasingly different.  Those who have read Nelson's private letters and journals will remember  how he gloried in the appreciation of his subordinate officers just before  Trafalgar's happy and yet fatal day, when he had explained to them his  intention to attack the enemy with what was practically a wedge-formed  fleet. He was determined to break their line, and, Nelson-like, he did.  But that which he facetiously christened the \"Nelson touch\" would itself  nowadays be broken up in a few minutes and thrown into utter confusion by  any powerfully-armed vessel hovering about under steam. Or if the wedge of  wooden vessels were allowed to form, as they approached the apex, a couple  of ironclads would take them in hand coolly, one by one, and send them to  the bottom, while their guns might as well shoot peas at the ironclads as  the shot of former days.    Taking the _Victory_ as a fair type of the best war-ships of her day (a  day when there was not that painful uncertainty with regard to naval  construction and armament existing now, in spite of our vaunted progress),  we still"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39372"],[0,"The Recent Mammals of Tamaulipas, México (#6)"],[1,"as.
