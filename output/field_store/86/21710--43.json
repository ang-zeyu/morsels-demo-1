Army Air Corps years later sought an appropriate insignia  for its lighter-than-air division, it could think of nothing more  fitting than a design which included a rooster, a duck and a sheep.    Everyone was ready for the next step. A French judge had the solution.  He offered the choice to several prisoners awaiting execution--a balloon  flight or the guillotine. Two volunteered, felt they had at least a  chance with the balloon, whereas the guillotine was distressingly final.  They had nothing to lose. That word rang through Paris. A young gallant  named De Rozier objected.    \"The chance might succeed,\" he said. \"The honor of being the first man  to fly should not go to a convict, but to a gentleman of France. I offer  my life.\"    Even the king protested at this needless risk, but De Rozier took off  the following month, flew half way over Paris, landed safely. This  happened on Nov. 21, 1783.    Among the witnesses to these experiments was Benjamin Franklin, the  American ambassador, himself a scientist of no small renown. He  predicted great things for aeronautics.    \"But of what use is a balloon?\" asked a practical-minded friend.    \"Of what use,\" replied the American, \"is a baby?\"    A little later, on January 7, 1785, Jean Pierre Francois Blanchard, a  Frenchman, and Dr. John Jeffries, an American, practicing medicine in  England, inflated a balloon, took off from the cliffs of Dover at one  o'clock in the afternoon, arrived safely in Calais three hours later.        [Illustration: Santos Dumont startled Paris in 1910, when he let an      American girl fly one of his airships over the city.

Army pilots found that at flying speed the plane      weighed nothing, was sustained by dynamic forces. (U. S. Army      photo)]    Flight was here, though it would be a long time becoming practical. Dr.  Charles and many others contributed, even at that early day. Knowing  that hydrogen expanded as the air pressure grew less, at higher  altitudes, Charles devised a valve at the top of the balloon, so that  the surplus gas could be released, not burst the balloon. He devised a  net from which the basket could be suspended, distributing its load over  the entire bag.    The drag rope was evolved, an ingenious device to stabilize the  balloon's flight in unstable air. If the balloon tended to rise it would  have to carry the entire weight of the rope. If it grew sluggish and  drifted low, it had less weight to carry, as much of the rope now lay on  the ground. These ballooning principles, early found, are still in use.  But the \"dirigible\" balloon, or airship must wait for light weight,  dependable motors, despite the hundreds of ingenious experiments made by  men over a full century.    Since this is an airship story, we should first make clear the  difference between the airship and the airplane.    The French hit on an apt phrase to distinguish them, dividing aircraft  into those which are lighter than the air, such as airships, and those  which are heavier than the air, like airplanes.    Airships are literally lighter than air. So are all free balloons, used  for training and racing, and all anchored balloons, such as the  observation balloon widely used in the last war and the barrage balloons  of the present war.    The airship goes up and stays up because the buoyancy given by its  lifting gas makes it actually lighter than the air it displaces, and  even with the load of motors, fuel, equipment and passengers, must still  use ballast to hold it in equilibrium.    The airplane, on the other hand, is heavier than the air. Even the  lightest plane can stay up only if it is moving fast enough to get a  lifting effect from the movement of air along the wings, similar to that  which makes a kite stay up. A kite may be flown in calm weather only if  the one who holds the cord keeps running. On a windy day, the kite may  be anchored on the ground, and the movement of the wind alone will have  sufficient lifting effect. So powerful are these air forces that a plane  weighing 20 tons may climb to an altitude of 10,000 feet if its speed is  great enough, and its area of wing surface broad enough to produce this  kiting effect.    But an airplane can remain aloft only as long as it is moving faster  than a certain minimum speed. Cut the motors, or even throttle down  below this stalling speed, and the plane will start earthward.    The airship needs its motors only to propel it forward. It can cut its  speed, even stop its engines, and nothing happens. It retains its  buoyancy, continues to float. The airplane's lift is dynamic, that of  the airship is static.    The airship has some dynamic lift, also, because its horizontal fins or  rudders, and the body of the airship have some kiting effect in flight.  The blimp pilot, starting on a long trip, will fill up his tanks with  all the fuel the ship can lift statically, then take on another 2,000  pounds, taxi across the airport till he gets flying speed and so get  under way with many more miles added to his cruising speed.    This dynamic lift however, while useful in certain operations is still  incidental. Primarily the airship gets its lift from the fact that the  gas in the envelope is much lighter than the air.    Hydrogen is only one-fifteenth the weight of air, helium, the  non-inflammable American gas, is a little heavier, about one-seventh.  The practical lift is 68 pounds to the thousand cubic feet of hydrogen,  63 pounds in the case of helium.    Lighter-than-air ships are of three classes, rigid, semi-rigid and  non-rigid. The rigid airship has a complete metal skeleton, which gives  the ship strength and shape. Into the metal frame of the rigid airship  are built quarters, shops, communication ways, even engine rooms in the  case of the Akron and Macon, with only the control car, fins, and  propellers projecting outside the symmetrical hull. The lifting gas is  carried in a dozen or more separate gas cells, nested within the bays of  the ship.    The non-rigid airship has no such internal support. The bag keeps its  taut shape only from the gas and air pressure maintained within. Release  the gas and the bag becomes merely a flabby mass of fabric on the hangar  floor. Ship crews do not live in the balloon section, but in the control  car below.    The British, apt at nicknames, differentiated between the two types of  airships by calling them \"rigid\" and \"limp\" types, and since an early  \"Type B\" was widely used in the first World War, quickly contracted \"B,  limp\" into the handier word \"Blimp.\"    The third type, semi-rigid, has a metal keel extending the length of the  ship, to which control surfaces and the car are attached, and with a  metal cone to stiffen the bow section.    The rigid ship is of German origin. Developed by Count Zeppelin, retired  army officer, and largely used by that nation during the war of 1914-18,  it was taken up after the war started, by the British and Americans, and  to a small extent later by France and Italy.    Non-rigid ships were widely used by the British and French, to a less  extent by Italy and United States.    The intermediate semi-rigid was largely Italian and French in war use,  though United States bought one ship after the war from the Italians,  built one itself. The Germans also built smaller Parseval semi-rigids.    The rigid airships are the largest, the non-rigids smallest. The rigid  has to be large to hold enough gas to lift its metal frame along with  the load of fuel, oil, crew, supplies, passengers and cargo. The blimps  can be much smaller.    The Army's first airship, built by Major Tom Baldwin, old time  balloonist, had 19,500 cubic feet capacity. Goodyear's pioneer helium  ship \"Pilgrim\" had 51,000 cubic feet. These contrast with the seven  million feet capacity of the Hindenburg, and the ten million cubic feet  of ships projected for the future.    The following table will show the range of sizes:      Rigid Airships:  Hindenburg (German)               7,070,000 cubic feet                     Akron-Macon (U.

Let's cut back now to the Montgolfiers. Progress was disappointingly  slow. The simple balloon would only go up and down, and in the direction  of the wind. Before it could be practical, men must be able to drive it  wherever they liked, make it dirigible, or "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5157"],[0,"How I Found Livingstone (#6)"],[1,"of Africa might prove an advantage.  Accordingly I had a cart constructed, eighteen inches wide and five feet  long, supplied with two fore-wheels of a light American wagon, more for  the purpose of conveying the narrow ammunition-boxes. I estimated that  if a donkey could carry to Unyanyembe a load of four frasilahs, or 140  lbs., he ought to be able to draw eight frasilahs on such a cart,  which would be equal to the carrying capacity of four stout pagazis or  carriers. Events will prove, how my theories were borne out by practice.    When my purchases were completed, and I beheld them piled up, tier after  tier, row upon row, here a mass of cooking-utensils, there bundles of  rope, tents, saddles, a pile of portmanteaus and boxes, containing every  imaginable thing, I confess I was rather abashed at my own temerity.  Here were at least six tons of material! \"How will it ever be possible,\"  I thought, \"to move all this inert mass across the wilderness stretching  between the sea, and the great lakes of Africa? Bah, cast all doubts  away, man, and have at them! 'Sufficient for the day is the evil  thereof,' without borrowing from the morrow.\"    The traveller must needs make his way into the African interior after  a fashion very different from that to which he has been accustomed in  other countries. He requires to take with him just what a ship must have  when about to sail on a long voyage. He must have his slop chest, his  little store of canned dainties, and his medicines, besides which, he  must have enough guns, powder, and ball to be able to make a series of  good fights if necessary. He must have men to convey these miscellaneous  articles; and as a man's maximum load does not exceed 70 lbs., to convey  11,000 lbs. requires nearly 160 men.    Europe and the Orient, even Arabia and Turkestan, have royal ways  of travelling compared to Africa. Specie is received in all those  countries, by which a traveller may carry his means about with him on  his own person. Eastern and Central Africa, however, demand a necklace,  instead of a cent; two yards of American sheeting, instead of half a  dollar, or a florin, and a kitindi of thick brass-wire, in place of a  gold piece.    The African traveller can hire neither wagons nor camels, neither  horses nor mules, to proceed with him into the interior. His means of  conveyance are limited to black and naked men, who demand at least $15 a  head for every 70 lbs. weight carried only as far as Unyanyembe.    One thing amongst others my predecessors omitted to inform men bound for  Africa, which is of importance, and that is, that no traveller should  ever think of coming to Zanzibar with his money in any other shape than  gold coin. Letters of credit, circular notes, and such civilized things  I have found to be a century ahead of Zanzibar people.    Twenty and twenty-five cents deducted out of every dollar I drew on  paper is one of the unpleasant, if not unpleasantest things I have  committed to lasting memory. For Zanzibar is a spot far removed from all  avenues of European commerce, and coin is at a high premium. A man  may talk and entreat, but though he may have drafts, cheques, circular  notes, letters of credit, a carte blanche to get what he wants, out of  every dollar must, be deducted twenty, twenty-five and thirty cents,  so I was told, and so was my experience. What a pity there is no  branch-bank here!    I had intended to have gone into Africa incognito. But the fact that a  white man, even an American, was about to enter Africa was soon known  all over Zanzibar. This fact was repeated a thousand times in the  streets, proclaimed in all shop alcoves, and at the custom-house. The  native bazaar laid hold of it, and agitated it day and night until my  departure. The foreigners, including the Europeans, wished to know the  pros and cons of my coming in and going out.    My answer to all questions, pertinent and impertinent, was, I am going  to Africa.

Ah, me! what hard work it is to start an expedition alone! What with  hurrying through the baking heat of the fierce relentless sun from shop  to shop, strengthening myself with far-reaching and enduring patience  far the haggling contest with the livid-faced Hindi, summoning courage  and wit to brow-beat the villainous Goanese, and match the foxy Banyan,  talking volumes throughout the day, correcting estimates, making up  accounts, superintending the delivery of purchased articles, measuring  and weighing them, to see that everything was of full measure and  weight, overseeing the white men Farquhar and Shaw, who were busy on  donkey saddles, sails, tents, and boats for the Expedition, I felt, when  the day was over, as though limbs and brain well deserved their rest.  Such labours were mine unremittingly for a month.    Having bartered drafts on Mr. James Gordon Bennett to the amount of  several thousand dollars for cloth, beads, wire, donkeys, and a thousand  necessaries, having advanced pay to the white men, and black escort  of the Expedition, having fretted Capt. Webb and his family more than  enough with the din of preparation, and filled his house with my goods,  there was nothing further to do but to leave my formal adieus with the  Europeans, and thank the Sultan and those gentlemen who had assisted me,  before embarking for Bagamoyo.    The day before my departure from Zanzibar the American Consul, having  just habited himself in his black coat, and taking with him an extra  black hat, in order to be in state apparel, proceeded with me to the  Sultan's palace. The prince had been generous to me; he had presented me  with an Arab horse, had furnished me with letters of introduction to his  agents, his chief men, and representatives in the interior, and in many  other ways had shown himself well disposed towards me.    The palace is a large, roomy, lofty, square house close to the fort,  built of coral, and plastered thickly with lime mortar. In appearance  it is half Arabic and half Italian. The shutters are Venetian blinds  painted a vivid green, and presenting a striking contrast to the  whitewashed walls. Before the great, lofty, wide door were ranged in  two crescents several Baluch and Persian mercenaries, armed with  curved swords and targes of rhinoceros hide. Their dress consisted of a  muddy-white cotton shirt, reaching to the ancles, girdled with a leather  belt thickly studded with silver bosses.    As we came in sight a signal was passed to some person inside the  entrance. When within twenty yards of the door, the Sultan, who was  standing waiting, came down the steps, and, passing through the ranks,  advanced toward us, with his right hand stretched out, and a genial  smile of welcome on his face. On our side we raised our hats, and shook  hands with him, after which, doing according as he bade us, we passed  forward, and arrived on the highest step near the entrance door. He  pointed forward; we bowed and arrived at the foot of an unpainted  and narrow staircase to turn once more to the Sultan. The Consul, I  perceived, was ascending sideways, a mode of progression which I saw was  intended for a compromise with decency and dignity. At the top of the  stairs we waited, with our faces towards the up-coming Prince. Again we  were waved magnanimously forward, for before us was the reception-hall  and throne-room. I noticed, as I marched forward to the furthest end,  that the room was high, and painted in the Arabic style, that the carpet  was thick and of Persian fabric, that the furniture consisted of a dozen  gilt chairs and a chandelier,    We were seated; Ludha Damji, the Banyan collector of customs, a  venerable-looking old man, with a shrewd intelligent face, sat on the  right of the Sultan; next to him was the great Mohammedan merchant Tarya  Topan who had come to be present at the interview, not only because he  was one of the councillors of His Highness, but because he also took a  lively interest in this American Expedition. Opposite to Ludha sat Capt.  Webb, and next to him I was seated, opposite Tarya Topan. The Sultan sat  in a gilt chair between the Americans and the councillors. Johari  the dragoman stood humbly before the Sultan, expectant and ready to  interpret what we had to communicate to the Prince.    The Sultan, so far as dress goes, might be taken for a Mingrelian  gentleman, excepting, indeed, for the turban, whose ample folds in  alternate colours of red, yellow, brown, and white, encircled his head.  His long robe was of dark cloth, cinctured round the waist with his rich  sword-belt, from which was suspended a gold-hilted scimitar, encased in  a scabbard also enriched with gold: His legs and feet were bare, and had  a ponderous look about them, since he suffered from that strange curse  of Zanzibar--elephantiasis. His feet were slipped into a pair of watta  (Arabic for slippers), with thick soles and a strong leathern band over  the instep. His light complexion and his correct features, which are  intelligent and regular, bespeak the Arab patrician. They indicate,  however, nothing except his high descent and blood; no traits of  character are visible unless there is just a trace of amiability, and  perfect contentment with himself and all around.    Such is Prince, or Seyd Burghash, Sultan of Zanzibar and Pemba, and the  East coast of Africa, from Somali Land to the Mozambique, as he appeared  to me.
