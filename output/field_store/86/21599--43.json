The insects of Europe, indeed, offer but few  exceptions to these characters; but the habits of certain exotic tribes, in  each of these families, partake both of one and the other in a remarkable  manner. Thus, among the butterflies, there is a genus in South America  (hitherto unnoticed), which fly only during the dusk of evening: a number  of the Linnaean Hawk-moths prefer the meridian heat of the sun; and there  are not wanting several moths which are only seen during the same period of  the day.    The insect, however, before us, is of that tribe to which the remark of  Linnaeus is strictly applicable; and, although included in the _Systema  Naturae_, has remained without any correct representation, for it would be  difficult to delineate a worse figure of it than that given by Cramer.  Besides the row of five snowy white spots on each side of the body, there  are four pair of others, more dusky, down the middle, and five small black  dots near the outer margin of the fore wings; the colour of all beneath is  a buff yellow, with two faint dusky oblique bars, and the middle of the  fore wings sea green.    I have received this species from Jamaica; in its larva state it appears to  feed on the wild vine.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 88    [Illustration]    MITRA caffra,    _Brown white-banded Mitre._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 23.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _M.

In this shell, the plaits commence halfway round the body whirl;  they are obtuse, crowded, and not angulated near the suture; the striae  between are fine and decidedly marked; the base half of the shell strongly  grooved; the suture rather compressed; the channel short and not recurved,  and the aperture striated.           *       *       *       *       *    MITRA crassa    _Thick Mitre--upper and lower figures._           *       *       *       *       *        _M.

I borrowed it for a day from  the good woman to whom it belonged, and thus made the drawing and  description with the bird before me.    Dr. Latham observes on this species, that excepting where the grey colour  pervades, \"the rest of the body is olive green, excepting the quills, which  are deep green;\"--this may be the female. He adds a quotation from  Pernetty, who describes a bird from Monte Video, something near this; but  which, from having a very long tail, a flesh-coloured bill, &c. may  probably be distinct.    The live bird could not be conveniently measured, but it is rather larger  than the red-shouldered Parrakeet, (figured at pl. 62.) The skin round the  eye white, and the irides hazel; the whole upper part of the plumage is a  beautiful grass green, changing according to the light into different  shades; the top of the head, the quill feathers, and end of the tail,  greenish blue, in some lights appearing quite blue; the sides of the head,  ears, and throat, as far as the breast, bluish grey; all the remaining  under plumage yellowish green, with a shade of orange in the middle of the  body and vent; bill and legs dark grey; this latter colour is so unusual in  this tribe, that I at first thought it indicated an imperfect plumage, but  I have now seen it at two different seasons of the year without any  variation whatever. It is probably a South American species.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 90    [Illustration]    PTEROGLOSSUS inscriptus,    _Lettered Aracari._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 44.           *       *       *       *       *    SPECIFIC CHARACTER.        _P. fusco-viridis, capite gulaque nigris (feminae castaneis;) uropygio      rubro; abdomine flavo; rostri fulvi culmine, basi et apice nigris;      marginibus dentatis, lineis nigris inscriptis._        Obscure green; head and throat black, (in the female chesnut;) rump      crimson; body yellow; bill fulvous, the top, base, and tip, black; the      margins dentated, and marked with black lines resembling characters.           *       *       *       *       *    I was put in possession of this rare and unknown bird, by the dispersion of  the most magnificent assemblage of natural productions that ever marked the  zeal of an individual, or ornamented the capital of this kingdom. Mr.  Bullock's Museum is now scattered; yet the objects it comprised were deemed  worthy of enriching the public repositories of every nation in Europe; who  sent their learned men to purchase with avidity, and share in the spoils of  a Museum, the dispersion of which will be long regretted by the learned,  the inquiring, and \"the many.\"    Total length, twelve inches and a half; bill, from the angle of the mouth  to the tip, two inches three tenths long, and eight tenths across the base;  the colour (which appears little changed from that in the live state) is  deep straw, or buff yellow; the top of the upper mandible and tips of both  are black; parallel with the marginal base of the upper, is a black line,  which is very broad on that of the lower; the edges of both are serrated,  and marked by short black lines, somewhat resembling oriental characters;  at the base of the bill there is an elevated rim of deeper yellow; the  ears, chin, and throat are deep chesnut, margined in front with a narrow  line of black, (which parts in the male are entirely black;) the crown of  the head and neck above also black, changing to a dark bluish green on the  wings, back, and tail; the rump crimson, and the greater quills blackish;  from the breast to the vent straw-coloured yellow, with a greenish cast;  the thighs and flanks olive; tail wedged, near five inches long; the orbits  appear to have been black, and the feet green.

Every person in the State knew him, had known him in territorial  times, and would know him until either the State or he ceased to be.    Flung headlong from somewhere into Kansas during the \"border ruffian\"  period, he would probably have passed as rapidly out of it had he been  allowed to do so peaceably. But as the slavery party endeavored to push  him, he concluded to stick. At that particular time, he was a moderate  Democrat or conservative Republican, and consequently had no particular  principles. But the slavery party supposed he had, and to them  accordingly he became an object of suspicion. They assumed the  aggressive, and he at once resolved into a staunch Republican. Had the  latter first struck him, he would have been as staunch a Democrat. And  Gripe has never known how near he came to being the latter. The  Republicans had just decided to order him out of the state as a border  ruffian spy, when the Democrats took action and did so for his not being  one. Those were troublous times. He went to the front at once in the  antislavery ranks, and has stayed there ever since. Sore-headed men are  apt to become famous. There were those in our late war who were kicked  by adversity into the very arms of Fame.    Our friend had been in both the upper and lower houses of the State  Legislature, and had rolled Congressional logs, moreover, until he was  hardly happy without having his hands on one.    [Illustration: _BUREAU OF ILLUSTRATION BUFFALO_    SHAMUS DOBEEN--HIS CARD.]    [Illustration: HON. T. GRIPE (BEATIFIED).]          CHAPTER III.         THE TOPEKA AUCTIONEER--MUGGS GETS A BARGAIN--CYNOCEPHALUS--INDIAN       SUMMER IN KANSAS--HUNTING PRAIRIE CHICKENS--OUR FIRST DAY'S SPORT.      We had three or four days to spend in Topeka, as it was there that we  were to purchase our outfit for the buffalo region. With the latter  purpose in view, we were wandering along Kansas Avenue the next morning,  when a horseman came furiously down the street, shouting, at the top of  his lungs, \"Sell um as he wars har!\" Semi hastily retreated behind Mr.  Colon, thinking it might be a Jayhawker, while the professor adjusted  his glasses.    Muggs said the individual reminded him of the famous charge at  Balaklava. Muggs had never seen Balaklava, but other Englishmen had,  which answered the same purpose.    The equestrian proved to be a well-known auctioneer of Topeka, who may  be discovered at almost any time tearing through the streets on some  spavined or bow-legged old cob, auctioneering it off as he goes. His  favorite expression is, \"I'll sell um as he wars har.\" What particular  selling charm lies concealed in this announcement even Gripe could not  tell. Sachem thought that possibly he had been brought up at some  exposed frontier post, where, on account of Indian prejudices, wearing  hair is a rare luxury. To say there that a man was still able to comb  his own scalp-lock denoted an extraordinary state of physical  perfection. Expressions of praise for humans are often applied to  horses, and so, perhaps, the one in question. \"I have heard,\" quoth our  alderman, in support of this assertion, \"Fitz say of a belle, at a  charity ball, what a 'bootiful cweature;' and I have heard him, the day  after, in his stable, say the same thing of his horse.\"    That horse-auction was a sight worth seeing. The crowd collected most  thickly on the corner of Kansas Avenue and Sixth Street, and before it  the cob came to a stand. And it was a stand--as stiff and painful as  that of a retired veteran put on dress parade. The limbs would have had  full duty to perform in supporting the carcass alone, which had  evidently been in light marching order for years past. The additional  weight of the auctioneer must certainly have proved altogether too much,  had not the horse heard, for the first time, of the wonderful qualities  with which he was still endowed.    Seeing a whole corner, with gaping mouths, swallowing the statement that  he was only six years old, reduced by hard work, and could, after three  months grass, pull a ton of coal, he would have been a thankless horse  indeed, which could not strain a point, or all his points, for such a  rider.    [Illustration: _BUREAU OF ILLUSTRATION_    \"SPERIT, GENTLEMEN!\"]    And so, when the spurs suddenly rattled against his ribs, the old skin  full of bones gave a snort of pain, which the auctioneer called \"Sperit,  gentle_men_!\" and away up the broad avenue he rolled, at a speed which  threatened to break the rider's neck, and his own legs as well. His  tail having been cut short in youth, and retrimmed in old age, the  outfit made but a sorry figure going up the street. The Professor said  it suggested the idea of some fossil vertabra, with a paint brush  attached to its end, running away with a geological student.    After the return and cries for more bids, Muggs must have winked at the  auctioneer--possibly, to slyly telegraph him the fact that in \"Hengland\"  they were up to such games. At least the auctioneer so declared, and  advancing the price one dollar in accordance therewith, finally knocked  the brute down to him. Then the British wrath bubbled and boiled. The  auctioneer was inexorable. Muggs _had_ winked, and that was an advanced  bid, according to commercial custom the land over. Articles were often  sold simply by the vibration of an eyelash, and not a word uttered.    The Professor remarked that in law winks would doubtless be accepted as  evidence. It was a recognized principle of the statutes that he who  winked at a matter acquiesced in it, and indeed such signals were often  more expressive than words. Sachem sustained this point, and added  further that he had known many a man's head broken on account of an  injudicious wink.    The crowd, with almost unanimous voice, pronounced the auctioneer right  and Muggs wrong.    \"Me take the brute!\" exclaimed the indignant Briton; \"why he can 'ardly  stand up long enough to be knocked down. Except in France, he could be  put to no earthly use whatever. 'Is knees knock together in an ague  quartette, and 'is tail--look at it! It's hincapable of knocking a fly  off; looks more like flying off hitself!\" Muggs further declared the  sale was an attempt on the owner's part to evade the health officer, who  would have been around, in a couple of days, to have the carcass  removed.    The auctioneer waxed belligerent, the crowd noisy, and Muggs, like a  true Englishman, secured peace at the price of British gold. The horse  was on his hands, having barely escaped being on the town, and an  enthusiastic crowd of urchins escorted the purchase to a livery stable.  Muggs christened the animal Cynocephalus, and soon afterward sold him to  Mr. Colon, who was of an economical turn, for the use of his son Semi.    \"I have heard,\" said the thoughtful father, \"that the buffalo grass of  the plains is very nourishing. All that the poor steed needs is care and  fat pastures. Semi can give him the former, and over the latter our  future journey lies. I have also learned that what is especially needed  in a hunting horse is steadiness, and this quality the animal certainly  possesses.\"    From some months' acquaintance with the purchase, we can say that  Cynocephalus was steady to a remarkable degree. We are firmly persuaded  that a heavy battery might have fired a salute over his back without  moving him, unless, possibly, the concussion knocked him down.    Our first hunting morning, the second day preceding our hegira westward,  came to us with a clear sky, the sun shedding a mellow warmth, and the  air full of those exhilarating qualities which our lungs afterward  drank in so freely on the plains. Indian summer, delightful anywhere, is  especially so in Kansas.    From the advance guard of the winter king not a single chilling zephyr  steals forward among the tarrying ones of summer. Soothing and gentle as  when laden with spicy fragrance south, they here shower the whole land  with sunbeams. Earth no longer seems a heavy, inert mass, but floats in  that smoky, fleecy atmosphere with which artists delight so much to wrap  their angels. It is as if the warmer, lighter clouds of sunny weather  were nestling close to earth, frightened from the skies, like a flock of  white swans, at the October howls of winter. But I never could agree  with those writers who call this season dreamy. If such it be, it is  surely a dream of motion. All nature appears quickened. The inhabitants  of the air have commenced their southern pilgrimage, and the oldest and  leading ganders may be heard croaking, day-time and night-time, to their  wedge-shaped flocks their narrative of summer experiences at the Arctic  circle, and their commands for the present journey.    Sachem, I find, has recorded as a discovery in natural history that  geese form their flocks in wedge shape that they may easier \"make a  split\" for the south when Nature, with her north pole, stirs up their  feeding and breeding-grounds in November gales, and changes their fields  of operation into fields of ice. Sachem was sadly addicted to slang  phrases.    All game, I may remark, is wilder at this season of the year than  earlier. If the earth is dreaming, its wild inhabitants certainly are  not. Men, too, have thrown off the summer lethargy, and shave their  neighbors as closely as ever. If any one thinks it a dreamy season of  the year, let him test the matter practically by being a day or two  behindhand with a payment.    In reply to a question, the professor told us that the smoky condition  of the atmosphere was probably caused by the exhalation of phosphorus  from decaying vegetation. Sachem remarked that out of twenty different  objects which he had submitted for examination, and as many questions  that he had asked, nine-tenths of the results contained phosphorus in  some shape. It was "]]]
