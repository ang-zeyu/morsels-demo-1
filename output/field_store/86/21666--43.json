God is not divested of his grace, or man of his  dignity--nor is the tie between heaven and earth broken. The foundation  of God--the everlasting gospel--still standeth secure--and every effort  that is made to overthrow, does but more firmly establish it.\" [27]    Let us examine this matter more nearly, and with less partiality  than Rawlinson has done. If for the new school of critics to succeed  means that the orthodox view respecting Jesus of Nazareth, and the  religion he founded must be entirely overthrown by being driven out of  existence, then the new criticism is an \"attack\" which has \"failed,\"  for orthodox Christianity, that is, the Christianity which recognizes  Christ as divine--as God, and the New Testament as divinely inspired  and stating the substantial facts of Messiah's life--is still with us.    There are a number of reasons why the orthodox view of Christ has not  been entirely overthrown by the new criticism. First, the great body  of Christians which constitute the Catholic Church have been preserved  in the orthodox faith of Christ by the protecting aegis afforded by  the authority of that Church. Recognizing the church as superior to  the written word, alike its custodian and interpreter, and accepting  the meaning which the church attaches to the Bible as infallible,  Catholics, I say, have been preserved from the faith-shattering effects  of the New Criticism. Second, the criticism has been conducted, in the  main, and especially in the early stages of it, in the German language,  and hence has been largely confined to the German nation. Third, the  discussion wherever it has taken place has been carried on over the  heads of the laity; it has not been within their reach, hence to a  large extent it has been without effect upon them--an \"attack that has  failed.\" But in each case, let it be remembered, its non-effect is  the result of not coming in contact with it. In one case it has been  kept away from the people by the authority of the church; in the other  through the inability of the laity, outside of Germany, to understand  the language in which the attack was written; and thirdly, through  the inability of the masses to bring the necessary scholarship to the  investigation.    But, on the other hand, if to attract to itself a large following,  both among clergymen and laity, and especially among scholars; if to  modify prevailing orthodox opinion concerning the historical character  of the Old Testament, and force concessions respecting the character  at least of some parts of the Christian documents; if to permeate  all Christendom--the Catholic Church perhaps excepted--with doubt  concerning the divinity of Christ, and to threaten in the future the  faith of millions of Christians--if to do this is to succeed, then  the new criticism is succeeding, for that is what it is doing. Forty  years ago it was the complaint of German orthodox writers that this  German neology, as the new criticism is sometimes called, had left \"No  objective ground or standpoint,\" on which the believing theological  science can build with any feeling of security. [28] \"Nor,\" says the  same authority, \"is the evil in question confined to Germany. The  works regarded as most effective in destroying the historical faith  of Christians abroad, have received an English dress, and are, it is  to be feared, read by persons very ill-prepared by historical studies  to withstand their specious reasonings, alike in our country and in  America. The tone, moreover, of German historical writings generally is  tinged with the prevailing unbelief; and the faith of the historical  student is likely to be undermined, almost without his having his  suspicions aroused, by covert assumptions of the mythical character of  the sacred narrative, in works professing to deal chiefly, or entirely  with profane subjects.\" [29]    It is more than thirty years since these admissions were made; since  then the German works complained of have been more generally translated  and widely read than before. Besides, since then, Renan has given  his \"_Origins of Christianity_\" [30] to the world, and by his great  learning, but more especially by the power and irresistible charm of  his treatment of the subject, has popularized the conceptions of the  Rationalists, until now the virus of their infidelity may be said to be  poisoning all Protestant Christendom.    What must ever be an occasion for chagrin, not to say humiliation,  to orthodox Christendom, is, its inability to meet in any effectual  way the assaults of this new criticism. In Germany they complain  against Strauss for having written his \"_Life of Jesus_\" in the German  language. If he must write such a book, so full of unbelief in the  orthodox conception of Jesus, he ought at least to have had the grace  to have written it in Latin! [31]    For his rationalism Renan is driven out of the Church of Rome; but  this only gives notoriety to his views, creates a desire to read his  books and spreads abroad his unbelief. When the Presbyterian Church  takes to task one of its most brilliant scholars [32] for accepting  the results of the new criticism, he is sustained by the powerful  Presbyterian Synod of New York and acquitted; and when an appeal  is taken to the general assembly of the church and he is finally  condemned, he is able to retort that while he was condemned by the  general assembly, it was by numbers and not by intelligence that he  was overcome; it was the less intelligent Presbyteries of the rural  district that gave the necessary strength to his opponents. The better  informed members--members from the cities and centers of education  and enlightenment--were with him. [33] The defense commonly made for  orthodox Christianity is an appeal to its antiquity and its past  victories. Its defenders point with pride to the failure of the proud  boast of Voltaire, who was foolish enough to say: \"In twenty years  Christianity will be no more. My single hand shall destroy the edifice  it took twelve apostles to rear.\" \"Some years after his death,\" say  the orthodox, \"his very printing press was employed in printing New  Testaments, and thus spreading abroad the gospel.\" Gibbon with solemn  sneer devoted his gorgeous history [34] to sarcasm upon Christ and his  followers. \"His estate,\" say the orthodox, \"is now in the hands of one  who devotes large sums to the propagation of the very truth Gibbon  labored to sap.\" [35]    All this may be very well, but even in their day these men of the  eighteenth century had a large following, and did much damage to  orthodox belief. In fact, it is not inconsistent to claim that, in an  indirect way, they were the forerunners of our new school of criticism;  for many Christian scholars not satisfied with the answers made to the  infidel writers of the eighteenth century have accepted the results of  this new criticism as a solution of the difficulties urged against  christianity by the infidels of the eighteenth century.    It is time now to pause and summarize what has been thus far discussed:    First, the divided state of Christendom of itself argues something  wrong; for nearly every page of holy scripture urges the unity of  Christ's Church. \"Is Christ divided?\" [36] is the ringing question that  the apostle of the Gentiles asks the schismatically inclined church  at Corinth. \"I beseech you, brethren,\" says he, \"by the name of our  Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there  be no division among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in  the same mind and the same judgment.\" [37] He then proceeds to tell  them that they are utterly at fault in one saying that he was of Paul;  another that he was of Apollos, and another that he was of Cephas. [38]  What he would say of divided, not to say warring Christendom of today,  one may not conjecture, further than to say that if the incipient  divisions in Corinth provoked his condemnation, the open rupture and  conflicting creeds of the Christianity of the nineteenth century would  merit still harsher reproof.    Second, the failure of Christianity to evangelize the world in nineteen  centuries, sixteen of which, to all human judgment, appear to have  been especially favorable to that evangelization, since at the back  of Christianity stood the powerful nations of Europe whose commerce  and conquests opened the gates of nearly all nations to Christian  missionaries--argues some weakness in a religion bottomed on divine  revelation and sustained through all these centuries (so Christians  claim) by divine power. To be compelled to admit after all these  centuries favorable to the establishment of Christianity that now only  a little more than one-fourth of the population of our earth is even  nominally Christian is to confess that the results do not do credit  to a religion making the claims and possessing the advantages of  Christianity.    Third, the existence of a broad and constantly widening stream of  unbelief, not only in Christian lands and apart from Christian  communion, but within the very churches claiming to be churches of  Christ, together with the inability of the orthodox to meet and silence  the infidel revilers of the Christian religion--tells its own tale of  weakness; and bears testimony of the insufficiency of the Christian  evidences to bring conviction to the doubting minds of many sincere and  moral people.    All these considerations proclaim in trumpet-tones        \"'Tis time that some new prophet should appear.\"    Mankind stand in need of a new witness for God--a witness who may speak  not as the scribes or the pharisees, but in the clear, ringing tones of  one clothed with authority from God. The world is weary of the endless  wrangling of the scholastics. They "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46237"],[0,"The Romance of Book-Collecting (#6)"],[1,"of the extraordinary  character of the coloured coats of arms and other illustrations, would  at least have prompted inquiry; but no! it was thrown lightly aside, and  in due course disposed of to a pedlar for ninepence.  He in his turn  sold it to a chemist at Gainsborough for four times the amount, and the  chemist got L2 for his bargain from a bookseller, who, notwithstanding  the fact that a very imperfect copy had been disposed of at the Duke of  Roxburghe's sale many years before, positively sold it to another  bookseller for L7.  He, at any rate, was somewhat better informed,  though not much, for once more the volume changed hands, this time to  Sir Thomas Grenville, for L80.  These transactions did not take place in  the Middle Ages, but in the forties of the present century, and the  wonder is that anyone with the slightest knowledge of books could have  flown in the face of Dibdin's valuation of L420, which was at the time a  matter of common knowledge.  The butler may be honestly forgiven, and  the pedlar commiserated with, the chemist even excused; but the two  booksellers have no hope of redemption.  The imperfect Roxburghe copy  brought L147, and was resold at the White Knights sale for L84.  In 1882  a perfect copy made its appearance at Christie's, and was knocked down  for L630, being about a third less than the purchaser had made up his  mind to pay for it had circumstances compelled.  The life of a book is  more often than not like the life of a horse.  You use it, and little by  little strip it of its value till it becomes a wreck and can be used no  more.  The 'Boke of St. Albans,' in company with many other treasured  volumes, is not, however, for use, but a thing of sentiment, with a  value that will probably continue to increase, till the leaves crumble  before the touch of time.    Stories such as this are the book-man's tonic; they pick him up from the  despondency into which he has fallen through lack of sustenance, and  encourage him to believe that extreme scarcity is not always the reason  of failure, but rather that all things come at last to him who can work  and can wait, as indeed they do, for instances of good luck in the  matter of discovering books, though perhaps not numerous when personal  experience alone is considered, are common enough in the aggregate.  Here is a comparatively recent instance of good fortune:    In the summer of the year 1893 a London bookseller, who must be  nameless, was offered a small library, then stored in a provincial town  some thirty miles away.  The owner copied the title-pages of a few of  the books, and these were of such a character that the bookseller went  over and eventually paid the price asked.  What that amount was I am  unable to state, but have good reason to suppose that it was less than  L50.  The majority of the volumes were, as is usually the case with  old-fashioned and not particularly noticeable libraries, almost  worthless.  There were sermons preached in the long-ago to sleeping  congregations, tracts and pamphlets on nothing in particular, an old and  well-thumbed Prayer-Book or two of no importance, and the usual  ponderous family Bible in tarnished gilt. On a casual survey, the whole  of the books might have passed muster at a third-rate auction, and yet  the bookseller was only too glad to see them safely housed in London.  The reason was this: Among the refuse were _Americana_, some of extreme  rarity, such as those who deal in such books are perpetually on the  look-out for, and rarely find, even at their full value.  As these books  were publicly sold the following December, we are in a position to see  what the bookseller got in return for his money, which, as I have said,  was probably less than L50.  The prices realized are given, so that  there may be no mistake about the matter:    1.

This remarkable collection of books of American interest is probably the  most important that has ever been met with in such a way.  It may have  been formed a couple of centuries ago by someone who took a burning  interest in the 'New-found Worlde,' as old Frampton calls America, and  for various reasons was unable to go there.  Or it may be that it was  got together at a later date, as the presence of Heath's 'Journal of  Travels' seems to suggest, by some bookish prophet, with an eye to the  main chance.  If so, it is a pity that he did not live long enough to  reap the reward of his foresight and energy, though, after all, even had  he done so, _cui bono_?  Suppose he gave L5 for the whole collection a  hundred years ago--and surely this is on the right side, for Hakluyt's  'Principal Navigations' would itself be worth as much in those  days--even then he would be woefully out of pocket for his pains, for  his L5 would, at compound interest, have increased to the best part of  L2,500.  It is this little matter of interest that upsets all  calculations, and makes us all lying prophets, so far as money is  concerned.    Another extremely fortunate find was made, in 1896, in Hampshire.  Can  such things be?  Can any man be born to such a heritage of luck?  It  seems that Mr. M. H. Foster, who recently bought the Cams Hall estate in  the county named, took it into his head to explore the mansion, and in  doing so came across a number of old volumes which had been abandoned by  the late proprietor. They lay, dusty and cobwebbed, in an old cupboard,  and instead of consisting of forgotten ledgers and day-books, as would  have been the case if any less fortunate gentleman had been concerned,  proved to be of the greatest value. There was Caxton, writ large, among  them--several Caxtons in fact, one being 'Justinian's Law,' such an  exceedingly scarce book that a later edition once sold in London for  L1,000--so at least it is said, though I have no record of the  circumstance.  At any rate, there is very little doubt that the volume  in question would bring that amount or near it, and again let it be  asked, Can any mortal living enjoy such favour from the gods?  As in the  case of the Thorneck Hall 'Boke of St. Albans,' so in that of the Cams  Hall 'Justinian's Law '; how can such books be overlooked?  Their very  type betrays them sufficiently, one would think, to make it impossible  for anyone, however careless, to pass them by.    Wholesale and very valuable discoveries like these are naturally of such  infrequent occurrence that when one is made the news of it is  disseminated far and wide, and commented upon in all the newspapers,  which are nothing now if not literary, at least to some extent.  Isolated finds, the picking up of some single object of interest or  value, is the most the book-man reasonably hopes for in these days, and  so long as he confines his desires within such narrow bounds it is hard  indeed if he never reap an occasional success, such as that reported of  a Melbourne gentleman, who only a few months ago picked out of a box  labelled 'Fourpence each' a first edition of 'Sordello,' with an  inscription in the handwriting of the author himself.  Browning had  written on the flyleaf, 'To my dear friend, R. H. Horne, from R. B.,'  which, though certainly autographically less important than if he had  signed his name in full, is yet a very pretty and cheap souvenir of an  eminent poet.  This R. H. Horne, who was himself a versifier, and once  celebrated as the author of 'Orion,' emigrated to Australia in 1852, and  became a Goldfields Commissioner at Ballarat.  When he left there and  came to England again, the book must have been left to the mercies of  the"]]]
