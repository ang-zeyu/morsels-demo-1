There have been quarrels between good  people just because one phase of nervous irritability roused  another. Let things in other people go until you have entirely  dropped your strain about them--then it will be clear enough what to  do and what to say, or what not to do and what not to say. People in  the world cannot get on our nerves unless we allow them to do so.          CHAPTER V    _The Trying Member of the Family_      \"TOMMY, don't do that. You know it annoys your grandfather.\"    \"Well, why should he be annoyed? I am doing nothing wrong.\"    \"I know that, and it hurts me to ask you, but you know how he will  feel if he sees you doing it, and you know that troubles me.\"    Reluctantly and sullenly Tommy stopped. Tommy's mother looked  strained and worried and discontented. Tommy had an expression on  his face akin to that of a smouldering volcano.    If any one had taken a good look at the grandfather it would have  been very clear that Tommy was his own grandson, and that the old  man and the child were acting and reacting upon one another in a way  that was harmful to both; although the injury was, of course, worse  to the child, for the grandfather had toughened. The grandfather  thought he loved his little grandson, and the grandson, at times,  would not have acknowledged that he did not love his grandfather. At  other times, with childish frankness, he said he \"hated him.\"    But the worst of this situation was that although the mother loved  her son, and loved her father, and sincerely thought that she was  the family peacemaker, she was all the time fanning the antagonism.    Here is a contrast to this little story An old uncle came into the  family of his nephew to live, late in life, and with a record behind  him of whims and crotchets in the extreme. The father and mother  talked it over. Uncle James must come. He had lost all his money.  There was no one else to look after him and they could not afford to  support him elsewhere where he would be comfortable. They took it  into account, without offence, that it was probably just as much a  cross to Uncle James to come as it was to them to have him. They  took no pose of magnanimity such as: \"Of course we must be good and  offer Uncle James a home,\" and \"How good we are to do it!\" Uncle  James was to come because it was the only thing for him to do. The  necessity was to be faced and fought and conquered, and they had  three strong, self-willed little children to face it with them. They  had sense enough to see that if faced rightly it would do only good  to the children, but if made a burden to groan over it would make  their home a \"hornets' nest.\" They agreed to say nothing to the  children about Uncle James's peculiarities, but to await  developments.    Children are always delighted at a visit from a relative, and they  welcomed their great-uncle with pleasure. It was not three days,  however, before every one of the three was crying with dislike and  hurt feelings and anger. Then was the time to begin the campaign.    The mother, with a happy face, called the three children to her, and  said \"Now listen, children. Do you suppose I like Uncle James's  irritability any better than you do?\"    \"No,\" came in a chorus; \"we don't see how you stand it, Mother.\"    Then she said: \"Now look here, boys, do you suppose that Uncle James  likes his snapping any better than we do?\"    \"If he does not like it why does he do it?\" answered the boys.    \"I cannot tell you that; that is his business and not yours or  mine,\" said the mother; \"but I can prove to you that he does not  like it. Bobby, do you remember how you snapped at your brother  yesterday, when he accidentally knocked your house over?\"    \"Yes!\" replied Bobby.    \"Did you feel comfortable after it?\" \"You bet I didn't,\" was the  quick reply.    \"Well,\" answered the mother, \"you boys stop and think just how  disagreeable it is inside of you when you snap, and then think how  it would be if you had to feel like that as much as Uncle James  does.\"    \"By golly, but that would be bad,\" said the twelve-year-old.    \"Now, boys,\" went on the mother, \"you want to relieve Uncle James's  disagreeable feelings all you can, and don't you see that you  increase them when you do things to annoy him? His snappish  feelings are just like a sore that is smarting and aching all the  time, and when you get in their way it hurts as if you rubbed the  sore. Keep out of his way when you can, and when you can't and he  snaps at you, say: 'I beg your pardon, sir,' like gentlemen, and  stop doing what annoys him; or get out of his way as soon as you  can.\"    Uncle James never became less snappish. But the upright, manly  courtesy of those boys toward him was like fresh air on a mountain,  especially because it had become a habit and was all as a matter of  course. The father and mother realized that Uncle James had,  unconsciously, made men of their boys as nothing else in the world  could have done, and had trained them so that they would grow up  tolerant and courteous toward all human peculiarities.    Many times a gracious courtesy toward the \"trying member\" will  discover good and helpful qualities that we had not guessed before.  Sometimes after a little honest effort we find that it is ourselves  who have been the trying members, and that the other one has been  the member tried. Often it is from two members of the family that  the trying element comes. Two sisters may clash, and they will  generally clash because they are unlike. Suppose one sister moves  and lives in big swings, and the other in minute details. Of course  when these extreme tendencies are accented in each the selfish  temptation is for the larger mind to lapse into carelessness of  details, and for the smaller mind to shrink into pettiness, and as  this process continues the sisters get more and more intolerant of  each other, and farther and farther apart. But if the sister who  moves in the big swings will learn from the other to be careful in  details, and if the smaller mind will allow itself to be enlarged by  learning from the habitually broader view of the other, each will  grow in proportion, and two women who began life as enemies in  temperament can end it as happy friends.    There are similar cases of brothers who clash, but they are not so  evident, for when men do not agree they leave one another alone.  Women do not seem to be able to do that. It is good to leave one  another alone when there is the clashing tendency, but it is better  to conquer the clashing and learn to agree.    So long as the normal course of my life leads me to live with some  one who rubs me the wrong way I am not free until I have learned to  live with that some one in quiet content. I never gain my freedom by  running away. The bondage is in me always, so long as the other  person's presence can rouse it. The only way is to fight it out  inside of one's self. When we can get the co-operation of the other  so much the better. But no one's co-operation is necessary for us to  find our own freedom, and with it an intelligent, tolerant  kindliness.    \"Mother, you take that seat. No, not that one, Mother--the sun comes  in that window. Children, move aside and let your grandmother get to  her seat.\"    The young woman was very much in earnest in seeing that her mother  had a comfortable seat, that she had not the discomfort of the hot  sun, that the children made way for her so that she could move into  her seat comfortably. All her words were thoughtful and courteous,  but the spirit and the tone of her words were quite the reverse of  courteous. If some listener with his eyes shut had heard the tone  without understanding the words he might easily have thought that  the woman was talking to a little dog.    Poor \"Mother\" trotted into her seat with the air of a little dog who  was so well trained that he did at once what his mistress ordered.  It was very evident that \"Mother's\" will had been squeezed out of  her and trampled upon for years by her dutiful daughter, who looked  out always that \"Mother\" had the best, without the first scrap of  respect for \"Mother's\" free, human soul.    The grandchildren took the spirit of their mother's words rather  than the words themselves, and treated their grandmother as if she  were a sort of traveling idiot tagged on to them, to whom they had  to be decently respectful whenever their mother's eye was upon them,  and whom they ignored entirely when their mother looked the other  way.    It so happened that I was sitting next to this particular mother who  had been poked into a comfortable seat by her careful daughter. And,  after a number of other suggestions had been poked at her with a  view to adding to her comfort, she turned to me and in a quaint,  confidential way, with the gentle voice of a habitual martyr, and at  the same time a twinkle of humor in her eye, she said \"They think,  you know, I don't know anything.\"    And after that we had a little talk about matters of the day which  proved to me that \"Mother\" had a mind broader and certainly more  quiet than her daughter. I studied the daughter with interest after  knowing \"Mother\" better, and her habitual strain of voice and manner  were pathetic. By making a care of her mother instead of a  companion, she was not only guilty of disrespect to a soul which,  however weak it may have been in allowing itself to be directed in  all minor matters, had its own firm principles which were not  overridden nor even disturbed by the daughter's dominance. If the  daughter had only dropped her strain of care and her habit of  \"bossing\" she would have found a true companion in her mother, and  would have been a healthier and happier woman herself.

In that respect they evidently have not attained a degree  of development which we do not find even among our political,  scientific, and religious leaders. Their social instincts hardly extend  beyond the limits of the hive or the nest. However, colonies of no less  than two hundred nests, belonging to two different species (Formica  exsecta and F. pressilabris) have been described by Forel on Mount  Tendre and Mount Saleve; and Forel maintains that each member of these  colonies recognizes every other member of the colony, and that they all  take part in common defence; while in Pennsylvania Mr. MacCook saw a  whole nation of from 1,600 to 1,700 nests of the mound-making ant, all  living in perfect intelligence; and Mr. Bates has described the hillocks  of the termites covering large surfaces in the \"campos\"--some of the  nests being the refuge of two or three different species, and most of  them being connected by vaulted galleries or arcades.(10) Some steps  towards the amalgamation of larger divisions of the species for purposes  of mutual protection are thus met with even among the invertebrate  animals.    Going now over to higher animals, we find far more instances of  undoubtedly conscious mutual help for all possible purposes, though we  must recognize at once that our knowledge even of the life of higher  animals still remains very imperfect. A large number of facts have been  accumulated by first-rate observers, but there are whole divisions of  the animal kingdom of which we know almost nothing. Trustworthy  information as regards fishes is extremely scarce, partly owing to the  difficulties of observation, and partly because no proper attention has  yet been paid to the subject. As to the mammalia, Kessler already  remarked how little we know about their manners of life. Many of them  are nocturnal in their habits; others conceal themselves underground;  and those ruminants whose social life and migrations offer the greatest  interest do not let man approach their herds. It is chiefly upon birds  that we have the widest range of information, and yet the social life of  very many species remains but imperfectly known. Still, we need not  complain about the lack of well-ascertained facts, as will be seen from  the following.    I need not dwell upon the associations of male and female for rearing  their offspring, for providing it with food during their first steps in  life, or for hunting in common; though it may be mentioned by the way  that such associations are the rule even with the least sociable  carnivores and rapacious birds; and that they derive a special interest  from being the field upon which tenderer feelings develop even amidst  otherwise most cruel animals. It may also be added that the rarity of  associations larger than that of the family among the carnivores and the  birds of prey, though mostly being the result of their very modes of  feeding, can also be explained to some extent as a consequence of the  change produced in the animal world by the rapid increase of mankind. At  any rate it is worthy of note that there are species living a quite  isolated life in densely-inhabited regions, while the same species, or  their nearest congeners, are gregarious in uninhabited countries.  Wolves, foxes, and several birds of prey may be quoted as instances in  point.    However, associations which do not extend beyond the family bonds are of  relatively small importance in our case, the more so as we know numbers  of associations for more general purposes, such as hunting, mutual  protection, and even simple enjoyment of life. Audubon already mentioned  that eagles occasionally associate for hunting, and his description of  the two bald eagles, male and female, hunting on the Mississippi, is  well known for its graphic powers. But one of the most conclusive  observations of the kind belongs to Syevertsoff. Whilst studying the  fauna of the Russian Steppes, he once saw an eagle belonging to an  altogether gregarious species (the white-tailed eagle, Haliactos  albicilla) rising high in the air for half an hour it was describing its  wide circles in silence when at once its piercing voice was heard. Its  cry was soon answered by another eagle which approached it, and was  followed by a third, a fourth, and so on, till nine or ten eagles came  together and soon disappeared. In the afternoon, Syevertsoff went to the  place whereto he saw the eagles flying; concealed by one of the  undulations of the Steppe, he approached them, and discovered that they  had gathered around the corpse of a horse. The old ones, which, as a  rule, begin the meal first--such are their rules of propriety-already  were sitting upon the haystacks of the neighbourhood and kept watch,  while the younger ones were continuing the meal, surrounded by bands of  crows. From this and like observations, Syevertsoff concluded that the  white-tailed eagles combine for hunting; when they all have risen to a  great height they are enabled, if they are ten, to survey an area of at  least twenty-five miles square; and as soon as any one has discovered  something, he warns the others.(11) Of course, it might be argued that a  simple instinctive cry of the first eagle, or even its movements, would  have had the same effect of bringing several eagles to the prey. But in  this case there is strong evidence in favour of mutual warning, because  the ten eagles came together before descending towards the prey, and  Syevertsoff had later on several opportunities of ascertaining that the  whitetailed eagles always assemble for devouring a corpse, and that some  of them (the younger ones first) always keep watch while the others are  eating. In fact, the white-tailed eagle--one of the bravest and best  hunters--is a gregarious bird altogether, and Brehm says that when kept  in captivity it very soon contracts an attachment to its keepers.    Sociability is a common feature with very many other birds of prey. The  Brazilian kite, one of the most \"impudent\" robbers, is nevertheless a  most sociable bird. Its hunting associations have been described by  Darwin and other naturalists, and it is a fact that when it has seized  upon a prey which is too big, it calls together five or six friends to  carry it away. After a busy day, when these kites retire for their  night-rest to a tree or to the bushes, they always gather in bands,  sometimes coming together from distances of ten or more miles, and they  often are joined by several other vultures, especially the percnopters,  \"their true friends,\" D'Orbigny says. In another continent, in the  Transcaspian deserts, they have, according to Zarudnyi, the same habit  of nesting together. The sociable vulture, one of the strongest  vultures, has received its very name from its love of society. They live  in numerous bands, and decidedly enjoy society; numbers of them join in  their high flights for sport. \"They live in very good friendship,\" Le  Vaillant says, \"and in the same cave I sometimes found as many as three  nests close together.\"(12) The Urubu vultures of Brazil are as, or  perhaps even more, sociable than rooks.(13) The little Egyptian vultures  live in close friendship. They play in bands in the air, they come  together to spend the night, and in the morning they all go together to  search for their food, and never does the slightest quarrel arise among  them; such is the testimony of Brehm, who had plenty of opportunities of  observing their life. The red-throated falcon is also met with in  numerous bands in the forests of Brazil, and the kestrel (Tinnunculus  cenchris), when it has left Europe, and has reached in the winter the  prairies and forests of Asia, gathers in numerous societies. In the  Steppes of South Russia it is (or rather was) so sociable that Nordmann  saw them in numerous bands, with other falcons (Falco tinnunculus, F.  oesulon, and F. subbuteo), coming together every fine afternoon about  four o'clock, and enjoying their sports till late in the night. They set  off flying, all at once, in a quite straight line, towards some  determined point, and, having reached it, immediately returned over the  same line, to repeat the same flight.(14)    To take flights in flocks for the mere pleasure of the flight, is quite  common among all sorts of birds. \"In the Humber district especially,\"  Ch. Dixon writes, \"vast flights of dunlins often appear upon the  mud-flats towards the end of August, and remain for the winter.... The  movements of these birds are most interesting, as a vast flock wheels  and spreads out or closes up with as much precision as drilled troops.  Scattered among them are many odd stints and sanderlings and  ringed-plovers.\"(15)    It would be quite impossible to enumerate here the various hunting  associations of birds; but the fishing associations of the pelicans are  certainly worthy of notice for the remarkable order and intelligence  displayed by these clumsy birds. They always go fishing in numerous  bands, and after having chosen an appropriate bay, they form a wide  half-circle in face of the shore, and narrow it by paddling towards the  shore, catching all fish that happen to be enclosed in the circle. On  narrow rivers and canals they even divide into two parties, each of  which draws up on a half-circle, and both paddle to meet each other,  just as if two parties of men dragging two long nets should advance to  capture all fish taken between the nets when both parties come to meet.  As the night comes they fly to their resting-places--always the same for  each flock--and no one has ever seen them fighting for the possession of  either the bay or the resting place. In South America they gather in  flocks of from forty to fifty thousand individuals, part of which enjoy  sleep while the others keep watch, and others again go fishing.(16) And  finally, I should be doing an injustice to the much-calum"]]]
