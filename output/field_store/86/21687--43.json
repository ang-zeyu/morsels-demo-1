Now the syndicalists are opposed in  principle to all political action; they would feel that they were  departing from their theory in taking the necessary practical steps,  and they would be without the required training because of their  previous abstention from politics.  For these reasons it is likely  that, even after a syndicalist revolution, actual power would fall  into the hands of men who were not really syndicalists.    Another objection to a program which is to be realized suddenly at  some remote date by a revolution or a general strike is that  enthusiasm flags when there is nothing to do meanwhile, and no partial  success to lessen the weariness of waiting.  The only sort of movement  which can succeed by such methods is one where the sentiment and the  program are both very simple, as is the case in rebellions of  oppressed nations.  But the line of demarcation between capitalist and  wage-earner is not sharp, like the line between Turk and Armenian, or  between an Englishman and a native of India.  Those who have advocated  the social revolution have been mistaken in their political methods,  chiefly because they have not realized how many people there are in  the community whose sympathies and interests lie half on the side of  capital, half on the side of labor.  These people make a clear-cut  revolutionary policy very difficult.    For these reasons, those who aim at an economic reconstruction which  is not likely to be completed to-morrow must, if they are to have any  hope of success, be able to approach their goal by degrees, through  measures which are of some use in themselves, even if they should not  ultimately lead to the desired end.  There must be activities which  train men for those that they are ultimately to carry out, and there  must be possible achievements in the near future, not only a vague  hope of a distant paradise.    But although I believe that all this is true, I believe no less firmly  that really vital and radical reform requires some vision beyond the  immediate future, some realization of what human beings might make of  human life if they chose.  Without some such hope, men will not have  the energy and enthusiasm necessary to overcome opposition, or the  steadfastness to persist when their aims are for the moment unpopular.  Every man who has really sincere desire for any great amelioration in  the conditions of life has first to face ridicule, then persecution,  then cajolery and attempts at subtle corruption.  We know from painful  experience how few pass unscathed through these three ordeals.  The  last especially, when the reformer is shown all the kingdoms of the  earth, is difficult, indeed almost impossible, except for those who  have made their ultimate goal vivid to themselves by clear and  definite thought.    Economic systems are concerned essentially with the production and  distribution of material goods.  Our present system is wasteful on the  production side, and unjust on the side of distribution.  It involves  a life of slavery to economic forces for the great majority of the  community, and for the minority a degree of power over the lives of  others which no man ought to have.  In a good community the production  of the necessaries of existence would be a mere preliminary to the  important and interesting part of life, except for those who find a  pleasure in some part of the work of producing necessaries.  It is not  in the least necessary that economic needs should dominate man as they  do at present.  This is rendered necessary at present, partly by the  inequalities of wealth, partly by the fact that things of real value,  such as a good education, are difficult to acquire, except for the  well-to-do.    Private ownership of land and capital is not defensible on grounds of  justice, or on the ground that it is an economical way of producing  what the community needs.  But the chief objections to it are that it  stunts the lives of men and women, that it enshrines a ruthless  possessiveness in all the respect which is given to success, that it  leads men to fill the greater part of their time and thought with the  acquisition of purely material goods, and that it affords a terrible  obstacle to the advancement of civilization and creative energy.    The approach to a system free from these evils need not be sudden; it  is perfectly possible to proceed step by step towards economic freedom  and industrial self-government.  It is not true that there is any  outward difficulty in creating the kind of institutions that we have  been considering.  If organized labor wishes to create them, nothing  could stand in its way.  The difficulty involved is merely the  difficulty of inspiring men with hope, of giving them enough  imagination to see that the evils from which they suffer are  unnecessary, and enough thought to understand how the evils are to be  cured.  This is a difficulty which can be overcome by time and energy.  But it will not be overcome if the leaders of organized labor have no  breadth of outlook, no vision, no hopes beyond some slight superficial  improvement within the framework of the existing system.  Revolutionary action may be unnecessary, but revolutionary thought is  indispensable, and, as the outcome of thought, a rational and  constructive hope.          Chapter III: Pitfalls in Socialism      I    In its early days, socialism was a revolutionary movement of which the  object was the liberation of the wage-earning classes and the  establishment of freedom and justice.  The passage from capitalism to  the new regime was to be sudden and violent: capitalists were to be  expropriated without compensation, and their power was not to be  replaced by any new authority.    Gradually a change came over the spirit of socialism.  In France,  socialists became members of the government, and made and unmade  parliamentary majorities.  In Germany, social democracy grew so strong  that it became impossible for it to resist the temptation to barter  away some of its intransigeance in return for government recognition  of its claims.  In England, the Fabians taught the advantage of reform  as against revolution, and of conciliatory bargaining as against  irreconcilable antagonism.    The method of gradual reform has many merits as compared to the method  of revolution, and I have no wish to preach revolution.  But gradual  reform has certain dangers, to wit, the ownership or control of  businesses hitherto in private hands, and by encouraging legislative  interference for the benefit of various sections of the wage-earning  classes.  I think it is at least doubtful whether such measures do  anything at all to contribute toward the ideals which inspired the  early socialists and still inspire the great majority of those who  advocate some form of socialism.    Let us take as an illustration such a measure as state purchase of  railways.  This is a typical object of state socialism, thoroughly  practicable, already achieved in many countries, and clearly the sort  of step that must be taken in any piecemeal approach to complete  collectivism.  Yet I see no reason to believe that any real advance  toward democracy, freedom, or economic justice is achieved when a  state takes over the railways after full compensation to the  shareholders.    Economic justice demands a diminution, if not a total abolition, of  the proportion of the national income which goes to the recipients of  rent and interest.  But when the holders of railway shares are given  government stock to replace their shares, they are given the prospect  of an income in perpetuity equal to what they might reasonably expect  to have derived from their shares.  Unless there is reason to expect a  great increase in the earnings of railways, the whole operation does  nothing to alter the distribution of wealth.  This could only be  effected if the present owners were expropriated, or paid less than  the market value, or given a mere life-interest as compensation.  When  full value is given, economic justice is not advanced in any degree.    There is equally little advance toward freedom.  The men employed on  the railway have no more voice than they had before in the management  of the railway, or in the wages and conditions of work.  Instead of  having to fight the directors, with the possibility of an appeal to  the government, they now have to fight the government directly; and  experience does not lead to the view that a government department has  any special tenderness toward the claims of labor.  If they strike,  they have to contend against the whole organized power of the state,  which they can only do successfully if they happen to have a strong  public opinion on their side.  In view of the influence which the  state can always exercise on the press, public opinion is likely to be  biased against them, particularly when a nominally progressive  government is in power.  There will no longer be the possibility of  divergences between the policies of different railways.  Railway men  in England derived advantages for many years from the comparatively  liberal policy of the North Eastern Railway, which they were able to  use as an argument for a similar policy elsewhere.  Such possibilities  are excluded by the dead uniformity of state administration.    And there is no real advance toward democracy.  The administration of  the railways will be in the hands of officials whose bias and  associations separate them from labor, and who will develop an  autocratic temper through the habit of power.  The democratic  machinery by which these officials are nominally controlled is  cumbrous and remote, and can only be brought into operation on  first-class issues which rouse the interest of the whole nation.

Perhaps  that was because he would have been an earl if he hadn't died. I am glad  earls are brave. That's a great 'vantage--to be a brave man. Once I used  to be rather afraid of things--in the dark, you know; but when I thought  about the soldiers in the Revolution and George Washington--it cured  me.\"    \"There is another advantage in being an earl, sometimes,\" said Mr.  Havisham slowly, and he fixed his shrewd eyes on the little boy with a  rather curious expression. \"Some earls have a great deal of money.\"    He was curious because he wondered if his young friend knew what the  power of money was.    \"That's a good thing to have,\" said Ceddie innocently. \"I wish I had a  great deal of money.\"    \"Do you?\" said Mr. Havisham. \"And why?\"    \"Well,\" explained Cedric, \"there are so many things a person can do with  money. You see, there's the apple-woman. If I were very rich I should  buy her a little tent to put her stall in, and a little stove, and then  I should give her a dollar every morning it rained, so that she could  afford to stay at home. And then--oh! I'd give her a shawl. And, you  see, her bones wouldn't feel so badly. Her bones are not like our bones;  they hurt her when she moves. It's very painful when your bones hurt  you. If I were rich enough to do all those things for her, I guess her  bones would be all right.\"    \"Ahem!\" said Mr. Havisham. \"And what else would you do if you were  rich?\"    \"Oh! I'd do a great many things. Of course I should buy Dearest all  sorts of beautiful things, needle-books and fans and gold thimbles and  rings, and an encyclopedia, and a carriage, so that she needn't have to  wait for the street-cars. If she liked pink silk dresses, I should buy  her some, but she likes black best. But I'd, take her to the big stores,  and tell her to look 'round and choose for herself. And then Dick----\"    \"Who is Dick?\" asked Mr. Havisham.    \"Dick is a boot-black,\" said his young lordship, quite warming up in  his interest in plans so exciting. \"He is one of the nicest boot-blacks  you ever knew. He stands at the corner of a street down-town. I've  known him for years. Once when I was very little, I was walking out  with Dearest, and she bought me a beautiful ball that bounced, and I  was carrying it and it bounced into the middle of the street where the  carriages and horses were, and I was so disappointed, I began to cry--I  was very little. I had kilts on. And Dick was blacking a man's shoes,  and he said 'Hello!' and he ran in between the horses and caught the  ball for me and wiped it off with his coat and gave it to me and said,  'It's all right, young un.' So Dearest admired him very much, and so did  I, and ever since then, when we go down-town, we talk to him. He says  'Hello!' and I say 'Hello!' and then we talk a little, and he tells me  how trade is. It's been bad lately.\"    \"And what would you like to do for him?\" inquired the lawyer, rubbing  his chin and smiling a queer smile.    \"Well,\" said Lord Fauntleroy, settling himself in his chair with a  business air, \"I'd buy Jake out.\"    \"And who is Jake?\" Mr. Havisham asked.    \"He's Dick's partner, and he is the worst partner a fellow could have!  Dick says so. He isn't a credit to the business, and he isn't square. He  cheats, and that makes Dick mad. It would make you mad, you know, if you  were blacking boots as hard as you could, and being square all the time,  and your partner wasn't square at all. People like Dick, but they don't  like Jake, and so sometimes they don't come twice. So if I were rich,  I'd buy Jake out and get Dick a 'boss' sign--he says a 'boss' sign goes  a long way; and I'd get him some new clothes and new brushes, and start  him out fair. He says all he wants is to start out fair.\"    There could have been nothing more confiding and innocent than the way  in which his small lordship told his little story, quoting his friend  Dick's bits of slang in the most candid good faith. He seemed to feel  not a shade of a doubt that his elderly companion would be just as  interested as he was himself. And in truth Mr. Havisham was beginning  to be greatly interested; but perhaps not quite so much in Dick and the  apple-woman as in this kind little lordling, whose curly head was so  busy, under its yellow thatch, with good-natured plans for his friends,  and who seemed somehow to have forgotten himself altogether.    \"Is there anything----\" he began. \"What would you get for yourself, if  you were rich?\"    \"Lots of things!\" answered Lord Fauntleroy briskly; \"but first I'd give  Mary some money for Bridget--that's her sister, with twelve children,  and a husband out of work. She comes here and cries, and Dearest gives  her things in a basket, and then she cries again, and says: 'Blessin's  be on yez, for a beautiful lady.' And I think Mr. Hobbs would like a  gold watch and chain to remember me by, and a meerschaum pipe. And then  I'd like to get up a company.\"    \"A company!\" exclaimed Mr. Havisham.    \"Like a Republican rally,\" explained Cedric, becoming quite excited.  \"I'd have torches and uniforms and things for all the boys and myself,  too. And we'd march, you know, and drill. That's what I should like for  myself, if I were rich.\"    The door opened and Mrs. Errol came in.    \"I am sorry to have been obliged to leave you so long,\" she said to Mr.  Havisham; \"but a poor woman, who is in great trouble, came to see me.\"    \"This young gentleman,\" said Mr. Havisham, \"has been telling me about  some of his friends, and what he would do for them if he were rich.\"    \"Bridget is one of his friends,\" said Mrs. Errol; \"and it is Bridget  to whom I have been talking in the kitchen. She is in great trouble now  because her husband has rheumatic fever.\"    Cedric slipped down out of his big chair.    \"I think I'll go and see her,\" he said, \"and ask her how he is. He's a  nice man when he is well. I'm obliged to him because he once made me a  sword out of wood. He's a very talented man.\"    He ran out of the room, and Mr. Havisham rose from his chair. He seemed  to have something in his mind which he wished to speak of.    He hesitated a moment, and then said, looking down at Mrs. Errol:    \"Before I left Dorincourt Castle, I had an interview with the Earl, in  which he gave me some instructions. He is desirous that his grandson  should look forward with some pleasure to his future life in England,  and also to his acquaintance with himself. He said that I must let his  lordship know that the change in his life would bring him money and the  pleasures children enjoy; if he expressed any wishes, I was to gratify  them, and to tell him that his grand-father had given him what he  wished. I am aware that the Earl did not expect anything quite like  this; but if it would give Lord Fauntleroy pleasure to assist this poor  woman, I should feel that the Earl would be displeased if he were not  gratified.\"    For the second time, he did not repeat the Earl's exact words. His  lordship had, indeed, said:    \"Make the lad understand that I can give him anything he wants. Let him  know what it is to be the grandson of the Earl of Dorincourt. Buy him  everything he takes a fancy to; let him have money in his pockets, and  tell him his grandfather put it there.\"    His motives were far from being good, and if he had been dealing with a  nature less affectionate and warm-hearted than little Lord Fauntleroy's,  great harm might have been done. And Cedric's mother was too gentle to  suspect any harm. She thought that perhaps this meant that a lonely,  unhappy old man, whose children were dead, wished to be kind to her  little boy, and win his love and confidence. And it pleased her very  much to think that Ceddie would be able to help Bridget. It made her  happier to know that the very first result of the strange fortune which  had befallen her little boy was that he could do kind things for those  who needed kindness. Quite a warm color bloomed on her pretty young  face.    \"Oh!\" she said, \"that was very kind of the Earl; Cedric will be so  glad! He has always been fond of Bridget and Michael. They are quite  deserving. I have often wished I had been able to help them more.  Michael is a hard-working man when he is well, but he has been ill a  long time and needs expensive medicines and warm clothing and nourishing  food. He and Bridget will not be wasteful of what is given them.\"    Mr. Havisham put his thin hand in his breast pocket and drew forth a  large pocket-book. There was a queer look in his keen face. The truth  was, he was wondering what the Earl of Dorincourt would say when he was  told what was the first wish of his grandson that had been granted. He  wondered what the cross, worldly, selfish old nobleman would think of  it.    \"I do not know that you have realized,\" he said, \"that the Earl of  Dorincourt is an exceedingly rich man. He can afford to gratify any  caprice. I think it would please him to know that Lord Fauntleroy had  been indulged in any fancy. If you will call him back and allow me, I  shall give him five pounds for these people.\"    \"That would be twenty-five dollars!\" exclaimed Mrs. Errol. \"It will seem  like wealth to them. I can scarcely believe that it is true.\"    \"It is quite true,\" said Mr. Havisham, with his dry smile. \"A great  change has taken place in your son's life, a great deal of power will  lie in his hands.\"    \"Oh!\" cried his mother. \"And he is such a little boy--a very little boy.  How can I teach him to use it well? It makes me half afraid. My pretty  little Ceddie!\"    The lawyer slightly cleared his throat. It touched his worldly, hard old  heart to see the tender, timid look in her brown eyes.    \"I think, madam,\" he said, \"that if I may judge from my interview with  Lord"]]]
