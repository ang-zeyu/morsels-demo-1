The more unequal a country's income distribution, the farther  its Lorenz curve from the 45 degree line and the higher its Gini  index, e.g., a Sub-Saharan country with an index of 50. If income  were distributed with perfect equality, the Lorenz curve would  coincide with the 45 degree line and the index would be zero; if  income were distributed with perfect inequality, the Lorenz curve  would coincide with the horizontal axis and the right vertical axis  and the index would be 100.        E      Economy      This category includes the entries dealing with the size,  development, and management of productive resources, i.e., land,  labor, and capital.        Economy - overview      This entry briefly describes the type of economy, including the  degree of market orientation, the level of economic development, the  most important natural resources, and the unique areas of  specialization. It also characterizes major economic events and  policy changes in the most recent 12 months and may include a  statement about one or two key future macroeconomic trends.        Education expenditures      This entry provides the public expenditure on education as a percent  of GDP.        Electricity - consumption      This entry consists of total electricity generated annually plus  imports and minus exports, expressed in kilowatt-hours. The  discrepancy between the amount of electricity generated and/or  imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is accounted for as  loss in transmission and distribution.        Electricity - exports      This entry is the total exported electricity in kilowatt-hours.        Electricity - imports      This entry is the total imported electricity in kilowatt-hours.        Electricity - production      This entry is the annual electricity generated expressed in  kilowatt-hours. The discrepancy between the amount of electricity  generated and/or imported and the amount consumed and/or exported is  accounted for as loss in transmission and distribution.        Elevation extremes      This entry includes both the highest point and the lowest point.

The following terms and abbreviations are used throughout  the entry:  Acidification - the lowering of soil and water pH due to acid  precipitation and deposition usually through precipitation; this  process disrupts ecosystem nutrient flows and may kill freshwater  fish and plants dependent on more neutral or alkaline conditions  (see acid rain).  Acid rain - characterized as containing harmful levels of sulfur  dioxide or nitrogen oxide; acid rain is damaging and potentially  deadly to the earth's fragile ecosystems; acidity is measured using  the pH scale where 7 is neutral, values greater than 7 are  considered alkaline, and values below 5.6 are considered acid  precipitation; note - a pH of 2.4 (the acidity of vinegar) has been  measured in rainfall in New England.  Aerosol - a collection of airborne particles dispersed in a gas,  smoke, or fog.  Afforestation - converting a bare or agricultural space by planting  trees and plants; reforestation involves replanting trees on areas  that have been cut or destroyed by fire.  Asbestos - a naturally occurring soft fibrous mineral commonly used  in fireproofing materials and considered to be highly carcinogenic  in particulate form.  Biodiversity - also biological diversity; the relative number of  species, diverse in form and function, at the genetic, organism,  community, and ecosystem level; loss of biodiversity reduces an  ecosystem's ability to recover from natural or man-induced  disruption.  Bio-indicators - a plant or animal species whose presence,  abundance, and health reveal the general condition of its habitat.  Biomass - the total weight or volume of living matter in a given  area or volume.  Carbon cycle - the term used to describe the exchange of carbon (in  various forms, e.g., as carbon dioxide) between the atmosphere,  ocean, terrestrial biosphere, and geological deposits.  Catchments - assemblages used to capture and retain rainwater and  runoff; an important water management technique in areas with  limited freshwater resources, such as Gibraltar.  DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro-ethane) - a colorless, odorless  insecticide that has toxic effects on most animals; the use of DDT  was banned in the US in 1972.  Defoliants - chemicals which cause plants to lose their leaves  artificially; often used in agricultural practices for weed control,  and may have detrimental impacts on human and ecosystem health.  Deforestation - the destruction of vast areas of forest (e.g.,  unsustainable forestry practices, agricultural and range land  clearing, and the over exploitation of wood products for use as  fuel) without planting new growth.  Desertification - the spread of desert-like conditions in arid or  semi-arid areas, due to overgrazing, loss of agriculturally  productive soils, or climate change.  Dredging - the practice of deepening an existing waterway; also, a  technique used for collecting bottom-dwelling marine organisms  (e.g., shellfish) or harvesting coral, often causing significant  destruction of reef and ocean-floor ecosystems.  Drift-net fishing - done with a net, miles in extent, that is  generally anchored to a boat and left to float with the tide; often  results in an over harvesting and waste of large populations of  non-commercial"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35842"],[0,"Microscopes and Accessory Apparatus: Catalogue No. 40 (#6)"],[1,"                    =108.--=      11. =The same= without Illuminating-Apparatus.

Zeitschrift fuer wissenschaftliche Mikroskopie, XIII, 1896.)     31. The sliding microscope is an instrument by means of       which very large microscope sections, as, for example,       large sections of the brain, can be systematically       examined. It is also of service in looking over plate       cultures of bacteria.         The microscope is carried on a heavy beam supported       by two stout pillars under which the stage       moves. The various movements are accomplished by       motion of the microscope on a lateral track upon       its support and by motion of the stage on a similar       track at right angles to the first. The motion of the       microscope is by means of a screw, that of the stage       by double rack and pinion. The extent of the movements       is indicated in each case by a scale, thus       permitting the systematic examination of the entire       specimen.         The stage consists of a glass plate, measuring       16x20 cm, which is carried in a frame supported on       four columns. The tracks permit a motion of the       microscope of 18 cm and of the stage of 13,5 cm. A       mirror under the stage affords ample illumination.         The microscope tube is so arranged that it can be       easily removed from the stand and a simple lens substituted       for it. The coarse adjustment of the microscope       is by rack and pinion. A screw above the objective       serves for fine adjustment. The price of this sliding       microscope, without objectives or oculars, but with a       lens holder and simple lens magnifying eight diameters       is                                                         =80.--=         =Flat glass dish="]]]
