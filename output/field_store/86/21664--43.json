But this is not right.  A man cannot get rid of the  responsibility, for his own actions.  And that is clear from the  following example.  If your officer commands you to kill your  neighbor's child, to kill your father or your mother, would you  obey?  If you would not obey, the whole argument falls to the  ground, for if you can disobey the governors in one case, where do  you draw the line up to which you can obey them?  There is no line  other than that laid down by Christianity, and that line is both  reasonable and practicable.    And therefore we consider it the duty of every man who thinks war  inconsistent with Christianity, meekly but firmly to refuse to  serve in the army.  And let those whose lot it is to act thus,  remember that the fulfillment of a great duty rests with them.  The destiny of humanity in the world depends, so far as it depends  on men at all, on their fidelity to their religion.  Let them  confess their conviction, and stand up for it, and not in words  alone, but in sufferings too, if need be.  If you believe that  Christ forbade murder, pay no heed to the arguments nor to the  commands of those who call on you to bear a hand in it.  By such a  steadfast refusal to make use of force, you call down on  yourselves the blessing promised to those \"who hear these sayings  and do them,\" and the time will come when the world will recognize  you as having aided in the reformation of mankind.    Musser's book is called \"Non-resistance Asserted,\" or \"Kingdom of  Christ and Kingdoms of this World Separated.\"  This book is  devoted to the same question, and was written when the American  Government was exacting military service from its citizens at the  time of the Civil War.  And it has, too, a value for all time,  dealing with the question how, in such circumstances, people  should and can refuse to enter military service. Here is the tenor  of the author's introductory remarks:       \"It is well known that there are many persons in the United     States who refuse to fight on grounds of conscience.  They are     called the 'defenseless,' or 'non-resistant' Christians.  These     Christians refuse to defend their country, to bear arms, or at     the call of government to make war on its enemies.  Till lately     this religious scruple seemed a valid excuse to the government,     and those who urged it were let off service.  But at the     beginning of our Civil War public opinion was agitated on this     subject.  It was natural that persons who considered it their     duty to bear all the hardships and dangers of war in defense of     their country should feel resentment against those persons who     had for long shared with them the advantages of the protection     of government, and who now in time of need and danger would not     share in bearing the labors and dangers of its defense.  It was     even natural that they should declare the attitude of such men     monstrous, irrational, and suspicious.\"    A host of orators and writers, our author tells us, arose to oppose this  attitude, and tried to prove the sinfulness of non-resistance, both from  Scripture and on common-sense grounds. And this was perfectly natural,  and in many cases the authors were right--right, that is, in regard to  persons who did not renounce the benefits they received from the  government and tried to avoid the hardships of military service, but not  right in regard to the principle of non-resistance itself. Above all,  our author proves the binding nature of the rule of non-resistance for a  Christian, pointing out that this command is perfectly clear, and is  enjoined upon every Christian by Christ without possibility of  misinterpretation. \"Bethink yourselves whether it is righteous to obey  man more than God,\" said Peter and John. And this is precisely what  ought to be the attitude to every man who wishes to be Christian to the  claim on him for military service, when Christ has said, \"Resist not  evil by force.\" As for the question of the principle itself, the author  regards that as decided. As to the second question, whether people have  the right to refuse to serve in the army who have not refused the  benefits conferred by a government resting on force, the author  considers it in detail, and arrives at the conclusion that a Christian  following the law of Christ, since he does not go to war, ought not  either to take advantage of any institutions of government, courts of  law, or elections, and that in his private concerns he must not have  recourse to the authorities, the police, or the law. Further on in the  book he treats of the relation of the Old Testament to the New, the  value of government for those who are Christians, and makes some  observations on the doctrine of non-resistance and the attacks made on  it. The author concludes his book by saying: \"Christians do not need  government, and therefore they cannot either obey it in what is contrary  to Christ's teaching nor, still less, take part in it.\" Christ took his  disciples out of the world, he says. They do not expect worldly  blessings and worldly happiness, but they expect eternal life. The  Spirit in whom they live makes them contented and happy in every  position. If the world tolerates them, they are always happy. If the  world will not leave them in peace, they will go elsewhere, since they  are pilgrims on the earth and they have no fixed place of habitation.  They believe that \"the dead may bury their dead.\" One thing only is  needful for them, \"to follow their Master.\"    Even putting aside the question as to the principle laid down in these  two books as to the Christian's duty in his attitude to war, one cannot  help perceiving the practical importance and the urgent need of deciding  the question.    There are people, hundreds of thousands of Quakers, Mennonites,  all our Douhobortsi, Molokani, and others who do not belong to any  definite sect, who consider that the use of force--and,  consequently, military service--is inconsistent with Christianity.  Consequently there are every year among us in Russia some men  called upon for military service who refuse to serve on the ground  of their religious convictions.  Does the government let them off  then?  No.  Does it compel them to go, and in case of disobedience  punish them?  No. This was how the government treated them in  1818.  Here is an extract from the diary of Nicholas Myravyov of  Kars, which was not passed by the censor, and is not known in  Russia:       \"Tiflis, October 2, 1818.       \"In the morning the commandant told me that five peasants     belonging to a landowner in the Tamboff government had lately     been sent to Georgia.  These men had been sent for soldiers,     but they would not serve; they had been several times flogged     and made to run the gauntlet, but they would submit readily to     the cruelest tortures, and even to death, rather than serve.     'Let us go,' they said, 'and leave us alone; we will not hurt     anyone; all men are equal, and the Tzar is a man like us; why     should we pay him tribute; why should I expose my life to     danger to kill in battle some man who has done me no harm?  You     can cut us to pieces and we will not be soldiers.  He who has     compassion on us will give us charity, but as for the     government rations, we have not had them and we do not want to     have them.'  These were the words of those peasants, who declare     that there are numbers like them Russia.  They brought them     four times before the Committee of Ministers, and at last     decided to lay the matter before the Tzar who gave orders that     they should be taken to Georgia for correction, and commanded     the commander-in-chief to send him a report every month of     their gradual success in bringing these peasants to a better     mind.\"    How the correction ended is not known, as the whole episode indeed  was unknown, having been kept in profound secrecy.    This was how the government behaved seventy-five years ago--this  is how it has behaved in a great cumber of cases, studiously  concealed from the people.  And this is how the government behaves  now, except in the case of the German Mennonites, living in the  province of Kherson, whose plea against military service is  considered well grounded.  They are made to work off their term of  service in labor in the forests.    But in the recent cases of refusal on the part of Mennonites to  serve in the army on religious grounds, the government authorities  have acted in the following manner:    To begin with, they have recourse to every means of coercion used  in our times to \"correct\" the culprit and bring him to \"a better  mind,\" and these measures are carried out with the greatest  secrecy.  I know that in the case of one man who declined to serve  in 1884 in Moscow, the official correspondence on the subject had  two months after his refusal accumulated into a big folio, and was  kept absolutely secret among the Ministry.    They usually begin by sending the culprit to the priests, and the  latter, to their shame be it said, always exhort him to obedience.  But since the exhortation in Christ's name to forswear Christ is  for the most part unsuccessful, after he has received the  admonitions of the spiritual authorities, they send him to the  gendarmes, and the latter, finding, as a rule, no political cause  for offense in him, dispatch him back again, and then he is sent  to the learned men, to the doctors, and to the madhouse.  During  all these vicissitudes he is deprived of liberty and has to endure  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46092"],[0,"A Little Pilgrimage in Italy (#6)"],[1," to the casket and handed up her rosary  that it might touch the shrine. She passed down with bent head.  Next came a girl of the splendid Umbrian type, deep-chested and  straight-limbed, her head carried high. She kissed the glass  and lifted up her ring, maybe her wedding ring, then crossed  herself, and passed on with trembling lips. Old men there were who  touched the shrine with shaking fingers, and stumbled away into  the cathedral to pray. Children were lifted up to kiss it. And  there were others besides the kerchiefed women and their peasant  husbands--people of the town, complacent burghers and their stout  wives, and the dainty white-robed girls of Perugia. And nearly all  passed out with uncertain lips as if they had been strangely moved.    Across the nave is the Miraculous Madonna which Giovanni Manni  painted on a column. She is in a gilt frame, set about with silver  hearts, which gleam in the darkness of the aisle like the smiles of  those who have found joy in her. I do not wonder that the people  of Perugia love this Madonna, for she is very beautiful. Her hands  are raised in blessing, but to me her tender eyes are full of  wonder, as though having no belief herself she marvelled at these  worshippers for their faith, and loved them exceedingly because of  it. We always found some poor, rough-headed peasants kneeling in  the great ugly church before her, and ever she blessed them, and  wondered at them, and seemed to give them peace.    [Illustration: THE GRIFFON OF PERUGIA.]    Perugia is a mediaeval paradox. When you stand upon her ramparts  in the clear shining of the morning, and look across the hills  and vales of Umbria, you wonder that the hot breath of war and  the scent of blood should have reached her. For she stands at the  head of two wide plains full of enchanted silence--the Valley of  Spoleto with its many little cities starring the green hills, and  the Valley of the Tiber which sweeps from the gates of Perugia  southwards to Rome. The mountains, which close them in, are clothed  with vines and olives, and swell softly like the many bosoms of  Diana of the Ephesians. The valleys are a garden, and the hills  roll softly to the horizon till they grow aerial in the distance  and hang upon the heavens like fantastic clouds. Little white  cities crown them or clamber up their slopes, and rivers wind down  the valleys, with sunlight glinting on their waters, between the  tall poplars swaying on their banks like girls who gather flowers  by a stream. The high brown shoulder of Subasio, made sacred by its  memories of Umbria's greatest saint, shuts off the bleak and hungry  Appennines which clasp Gubbio and Gualdo and a hundred other little  cities to their barren breasts. But here you have the landscape  of the Quattrocento artists with the clear pale light and blue  aerial hills which are the hall-mark of the Umbrian masters. Nor  can you ever tire of watching it, for every day and every hour some  subtle change sweeps over the face of this immortal loveliness;  and it is always beautiful, whether you look across the sunlit  mists at Assisi in a blue veil of cloud-shadow or see her smiling  and rosy in the sunset, or whether you stand at night under the  scented laurels of Perugia's _passeggiata_, and see the lights of  distant hill-cities riding like ships upon the dim horizon of a  soundless sea. It became a custom, almost an act of worship, to  congregate upon the bulwarks of Perugia before the sun slipped  behind the western hills, to watch the light pouring into the plain  like liquid gold into a bowl of translucent glass, tinted all the  colours of the prism. Even when night had drained this ancient  chalice of the golden wine of the sun, and the lights of lonely  farmsteads were twinkling on the hillsides, we were loth to leave  it.    Yet these fair valleys have been drenched with blood and scorched  by fire; Hannibal and his Gauls and Africans gave battle to  Flaminius, the maker of roads, by the lake of Thrasymene; they  have been devastated by Goths and Lombards; the German Kings of  Rome have harried them, and the history of Perugia itself has been  one long tale of battle and murder. It is as though the Griffin of  Perugia, the strange Etruscan beast which is to this day the device  of the city, has never sheathed its talons in anything but human  flesh.    From the beginning Perugia fought fiercely for her freedom.  Octavius wrestled for seven months outside her gates, and when  he entered them was cheated of everything but honour; because a  citizen, rather than yield his city to the first emperor, set fire  to it, and stabbed himself in the holocaust which followed. Totila  would not rest until he possessed her, and all through the Middle  Ages she fought like a termagant with her neighbours; and the name  of that griffin's brood, the Baglioni, was a terror throughout the  Umbrian vales.[4]    It was Paul III. who brought her to her knees, and forced her to  build his great fortress upon the palaces of her princes, and not  long since she turned and rent it stone from stone, seeking to wipe  out the old insult.    But it is not only in the marvellous and peaceful beauty of her  setting that Perugia is a paradox, for how is it possible to  reconcile the pictures of Perugino and his great pupils--Raphael,  Lo Spagna, Pinturicchio, and Eusebio di San Giorgio--with the  awful deeds of the Oddi and the Baglioni; or the wailing of the  Flagellants with the great soldiers who ruled this turbulent  city--Biordo Michelotto, foully done to death by the wicked Abbot  of Mommaggiore, and Braccio Fortebraccio, the idol of the people?  Paradox again! For the bones of Braccio Fortebraccio, which, to  satisfy the vengeance of Martin V., were buried in unconsecrated  ground, lie in a wooden box in the museum, and sigh to posterity  through their melancholy inscription:                  Hospes lege et luge.    Perusiae natum Montonium me exulem excepit,    Mars patriam Umbriam et Capuam mihi subegit.    Roma paruit; Italia theatrum; spectator orbis fuit.    At Aquila cadentem risit quem patria lugens brevi hac urna tegit.    Eheu! Mars extulit, Mors substulit.                                Abi.    In the days when Perugino and his pupils were painting their  calm-eyed Madonnas and saints with the blue Umbrian hills as the  background to a world of ineffable peace, Perugia was drenched  with blood daily, and every man carried his life in his hand. Yet  hardly any of the artists of Perugia painted war, though here and  there in their blue distances you see a little band of knights  pricking out on the plain. Bonfigli, the master of Perugino, was  the only one who cared to speak the truth; dear Bonfigli, who loved  Perugia so well, and painted her with such naive joy upon the  walls of the Palazzo Comunale!    [Illustration: FOUNTAIN IN THE CLOISTER OF S. PIETRO DE'  CASSINENSI.]    Trace Perugia in his frescoes, and you will wonder that it should  be so little changed to-day. There is the slender minaret of San  Pietro de' Cassinensi, and the great Gothic window of San Domenico,  whose cloisters are to-day a barrack, and Sant'Ercolano soaring up  beneath the city walls beside the ancient Porta Marzia. Here you  see the Palazzo Comunale, one of the most sublime Gothic palaces  in Italy, with its curving front and delicate fourteenth-century  windows and majestic portal, and the loggia which Fortebraccio  built by the cathedral. It is all much the same to-day as it was  when Bonfigli painted his primitive wars, except that the citizens  no longer dress in scarlet and fur, and that there are fewer towers  in the city, and none at all on the circuit of the walls.    San Pietro de' Cassinensi is still the gracious church Bonfigli  loved. We walked there one evening towards the hour of sunset. A  little rainstorm, like a petulant burst of weeping, overtook us as  we drew near, and we saw the yellow sunset and the cloud-shadows  in the valley through a web of silver threads woven by the rain  under the acacias. Inside, it was too dark to see the pictures with  which the walls are covered, but we gathered an impression of space  and dignity and richness. In the dim light we marvelled at the  beauty of the choir-stalls, the intarsia, and the carving in which  Stefano of Bergamo, and some say Raphael himself, gave free rein to  fancy, and dreamed of delightful mythical beasts, and sphinxes with  lovely faces, and a wealth of flowers and fruit and joyful little  children. A mad world!    Then the old monk, glad that we loved his treasures, opened  the doors of the choir, so that we might see their exquisite  workmanship in the fading light; and we looked down upon the  incomparable Valley of Spoleto, with Assisi and her sister city,  little Spello, on the skirts of Monte Subasio, and Foligno and  Trevi rising out of rosy sunset mists. There is a small round hill  below San Pietro, just such a little hill as Pinturicchio loved,  encircled by a winding white road, and shadowed with slender trees.  We almost looked to see his gay horsemen in red and blue and  shining steel pricking down into the plain. There were still storms  abroad, and the clouds drifted like great birds across the heavens,  casting their shadows on the valley.    'This is the work of a great artist,' said the philosopher, with a  little sigh of complete content. And indeed it was a worthy picture  to be framed in those exquisite doors.    Night overtook us before we reached Sant'Ercolano, which looked  more like a mosque than ever with its soaring arches in the  twilight. We climbed up the steps beside it, and passed into the  city through the Gate of True Dreams. At night Perugia of the  Middle Ages awakes. As we wandered in her dark and silent streets,  ill-lit and bridged with gloomy arches, our ears were tuned to  catch the voices of the past.    We divided our evenings. Sometimes we took our coffee and vermouth  in the"]]]
