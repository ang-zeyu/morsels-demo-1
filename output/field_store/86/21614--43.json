Their success might, and probably would, have forced the  evacuation of Ypres and affected the Picardy salient with its vertex  near Amiens, forcing the evacuation of Arras. But, as we have seen, the  operations on the Lys salient, meeting with an overwhelming obstruction  on April 29, did not achieve these results. Throughout the next three  weeks the manoeuvres of the enemy in Picardy afforded excellent  opportunities for counterattacks on the part of the Allies, whose object  here has been to punish the enemy as much as possible and to consolidate  every strategic position on a broad front in anticipation of a renewal  of Germany's original scheme to isolate the allied armies north of the  Somme by a dash to the mouth of that river via Amiens.    In these circumstances, the enemy on April 30 launched heavy attacks on  the French lines in the region of Hangard and Noyon. These fell down,  and on May 2 the French made distinct gains in Hangard Wood and near  Mailly-Raineval. The next day the French advanced their lines between  Hailles and Castel, south of the Avre, and captured Hill 82. On the 6th  the British advanced their lines between the Somme and the Ancre,  southwest of Morlancourt, and in the neighborhood of Locon and the Lawe  River, taking prisoners in both places. On the 11th skirmishes southwest  of Mailly-Raineval, between Hangard and Montdidier, developed into a  pitched battle, in which the French at first lost ground and then  recovered it. On May 14 the Germans, after an intense local bombardment,  delivered a spirited attack on a mile front of the British southwest of  Morlancourt, gaining a footing in their first trenches. Instantly some  Australian troops counterattacked and completely re-established the  British positions. On the 16th and 17th the enemy showed impressive and  portentous artillery activity along the Avre and at Rollott, on the  Abbeville road, south of Montdidier, similar in character to that  observed north of Kemmel, on the Lys salient.    There are now believed to be over half a million American rifles on the  western front, either at definite places or available as reserves. On  April 20 a battalion of Germans made a raid on our eight-mile sector  south of the Woeuvre, and succeeded in reaching the front-line trenches  and taking the village of Seicheprey. Our losses were between 200 and  300; 300 German dead were counted. A detachment of our army, principally  artillery, holds a sector of five miles with the French infantry east of  Montdidier, on the Picardy front, protecting the Beauvais-Amiens road.  Here their fire is principally employed in breaking up German  concentrations and transport in and around Montdidier.      THE ZEEBRUGGE RAID    The German submarine bases at Zeebrugge and Ostend on the Belgian coast  have been repeatedly bombed from the sea and shelled by British monitors  with indifferent results. With the adding of super-U-boats to the German  submarine fleet and the increased transatlantic traffic of the Allies  the necessity for effectually sealing these bases has long been  apparent. Theoretically the nature of the entrance to the harbors of  both places, resembling the neck of a bottle, about 250 feet wide, made  such a task easy by the sinking of block ships. Practically it was most  difficult, on account of both sea obstructions and the shore batteries.    On the night of April 22-23 British naval forces, commanded by Vice  Admiral Keyes, with the co-operation of French destroyers, and hidden by  a newly devised smoke-screen, invented and here employed by  Wing-Commander Brock, attempted to seal up the harbors. At Zeebrugge the  enterprise was entirely successful. The Intrepid and Iphigenia were sunk  well within and across the narrow channel, the Thetis at the entrance.  All three were loaded with cement, which became solid concrete after  contact with the water and can be removed only by submarine blasting. A  detachment of troops was also landed on the mole from the Vindictive and  engaged the crews of the German machine gun batteries stationed there.  An old submarine was placed under the bridge of the mole and detonated.  A German destroyer and some small craft were sunk. Before the blockships  were placed a torpedo had been driven against the lock gates which lead  from the channel into the inner harbors. The expedition retired with the  loss of fifty officers and 538 men, of whom sixteen officers and 144 men  had been killed.    At Ostend, the entrance to whose harbor is protected by no mole, the  block ships Sirius and Brilliant were not effectively placed. Against  this port the experiment was, therefore, repeated on the night of May  9-10. The Vindictive, with a cargo of concrete, was planted and sunk at  the entrance to the channel, but not entirely blocking it.      ITALIAN RAID AT POLA    Another naval exploit of the month worthy of record was the sinking in  the Austrian Harbor of Pola of a dreadnought of the Viribus Unitis class  (20,000 tons) by Italian naval forces, in the morning of May 15. The  achievement was similar to that performed by the President of the  Anaconda Copper Company, who has been appointed Director of Aircraft  Production for the United States Army] Italians on the night of Dec.  9-10, when a destroyer sawed her way through the steel net protecting  the Harbor of Trieste and torpedoed the predreadnoughts Wien and  Monarch, (5,000 tons each,) sinking the former. The Harbor of Pola,  however, is much more difficult to penetrate. It is three miles deep and  entered by a two-mile channel, at certain places less than half a mile  wide, and protected along its entire course by strong defenses. A mole  covers its mouth, making the channel here less than 1,000 yards wide.  Forts Cristo and Musil guard the entrance.    [Illustration: CHARLES M. SCHWAB    Head of the Bethlehem Steel Works, who has been appointed Director  General of the Emergency Fleet Corporation to carry out the Government's  shipbuilding program    ((C) _Harris & Ewing_)]    [Illustration: JOHN D. RYAN    TEUTONIZING THE BLACK SEA]    Save for the reports which have come to hand denoting the steady  progress of the British forces in Palestine and Mesopotamia, little of  importance has occurred in the Near East. Still the Teutonizing of the  Black Sea goes steadily on. On May 2 it was announced that a German  force had occupied the great Russian fortress of Sebastopol, famous for  its protracted siege by the British and French in 1855, and until then  considered impregnable. On May 12 part of the Russian Black Sea fleet  was taken possession of by the Germans at that place, while the  remainder escaped to Novorossysk. Among the captured vessels only the  battleship Volga and the protected cruiser Pamiat Merkuria were in  serviceable condition. At Odessa a new dreadnought and two protected  cruisers had already been seized by the Germans as they lay in their  slips.    In Macedonia the huge allied forces under the French General,  Guillaumat, are still waiting on events. The Greek Army is still in  process of reconstruction under the Venizelos Administration. The month,  however, has not been barren of engagements on this battleline. On April  28 the Serbians beat back attempts of the Bulgars to capture fortified  positions in the Vetrenik region; the French and British did the same in  regard to German attacks aimed at points west of Makovo and south of  Lake Doiran. So it has been all the month, the monotony only varied on  April 27, when there was intense artillery fire by the allied guns in  the neighborhood of Monastir, on the Cerna, and, in the Vetrenik region,  a Serbian assault annihilated a Bulgar section.      [Illustration: MAP OF PALESTINE AND MESOPOTAMIA, WHERE TWO BRITISH  ARMIES ARE AIMING AT BAGDAD RAILWAY]    IN THE NEAR EAST    There has been no serious attempt on the part of the Turks during the  month to oppose the expansion of General Allenby's front beyond  Jerusalem or the triumphant march of General Marshall up the Euphrates  and the Tigris--on the latter river now sixty miles below Mosul,  Marshall's obvious objective. The objective of Allenby is Aleppo, where  there is said to be a single division of German troops in addition to  the Turks, who have been forced north from Jerusalem. Allenby and  Marshall are advancing along parallel lines with a desert space of about  400 miles between. The Turks and their ally still have possession of the  caravan trail and the partly built and entirely surveyed Bagdad Railway,  which intersect the prospective parallel paths of Allenby and Marshall,  whose lines of communication already reach hundreds of miles to the  rear. But while Allenby has a lateral sea communication with Syrian  ports, no such advantage is enjoyed by Marshall, who must get all his  supplies from the head of the Persian Gulf, 450 miles to the south.  Whatever be the force at the disposition of the enemy, it is evident  that he will continue to possess a predominating tactical and strategic  advantage until he has been decisively defeated at both Aleppo and Mosul  or a junction has been established between Allenby and Marshall, or  both.    [Illustration: SCENE OF LATEST ITALIAN FIGHTING IN THE ALPS]    The former's line, which is a sixty-mile front, extending from Arsuf el  Haram on the Mediterranean east to the Jordan, took Es-Salt with  thirty-three German and 317 Turkish prisoners on May 1--twenty miles  north of Jerusalem--which was first occupied by Allenby early in  December.    Marshall's advance has been much more rapid. In the week of May 1 his  cavalry, in pursuit of the fleeing Turks, advanced twenty miles and  captured 1,000 prisoners. On May 7 he was 80 miles from Mosul; on May 10  he was within 60 miles. Allenby is 300 miles from Aleppo and 110 miles  from Damascus.

It was fastened  about his body by a band of the hair-cloth, fastened to the two  protuberances of the elytra, or wing-cases, on either side of the dorsal  surface.    The discovery at least robbed the situation of one aspect of terror.  Bram, however he had obtained control of the swarm, was still only a  man.    \"Yes, still insane,\" answered Dodd bitterly. \"Insane enough to go on  believing that the polyprotodontia and the dasyuridae, which includes  the peramelidae, or bandicoots, and the banded ant-eaters, or  myrmecobidae, are not to be found in fossil form, for the excellent  reason that they were not represented before the Upper Cretaceous  period.\"    \"You lie! You lie!\" screamed Bram. \"I have shown to all the world that  phascalotherium, amphitherium, amblotherium, spalacotherium, and many  other orders are to be found in the Upper Jurassic rocks of England,  Wyoming, and other places. You--you are the man who denied the existence  of the nototherium, of the marsupial lion, in pleistocene deposits! You  denied that the dasyuridae can be traced back beyond the pleistocene.  And you stand there and lie to me, when you are at my mercy!\"    \"For God's sake don't aggravate him,\" whispered Tommy to Dodd. \"Don't  you see that he's insane? Humor him, or we'll be dead men. Think what  the world will lose, if you are never able to go back with your  specimens,\" he added craftily.           *       *       *       *       *    But Dodd, whose eyes were glaring, said a sublime thing: \"I have given  my life to science, and I will never deny my master!\"    With a screech, which, however, was evidently inaudible to the beetles,  Bram leaped at Dodd and seized him by the throat. The two men fell to  the ground, the ponderous beetle-shell completely covering them.  Underneath it they could be seen to be struggling desperately. All the  while the beetle horde remained perfectly motionless. Tommy thought  afterward that in this fact lay their brightest chances of escape, if  Bram's immediate vengeance did not fall on them.    Either because Bram was not himself a beetle, or because in some other  way the swarm instinct was not stirred, the monsters watched the  struggle with complete indifference.    At the moment, however, Tommy was only concerned with saving Dodd from  the madman. He got his foot beneath the shell, then inserted his leg;  using his whole body as a lever, he succeeded in turning Bram over on  his back.    Then, and only then, the swarm rushed in upon them. Then Tommy realized  that he had touched one of the triggers that regulated the beetle's  automatism. In another instant Bram would have been torn to pieces. The  needle-beaks were darting through the air, the hideous jaws were  snapping. Bram's yells rang through the cavern.           *       *       *       *       *    Dodging beneath the avalanche of the monsters, Tommy got Bram upon his  feet again. The beetles stopped, every movement arrested. Bram's hand  went to the pocket of his tattered coat, there came a snap, a flash.  Bram had ignited an automatic cigarette-lighter!    Instantly the monsters went scurrying away into the distance. And Tommy  had another clue. The beetles, living in the dimness of the underworld,  could not stand light or fire!    He ran to where Jimmy was lying, face upward, on the ground. His face  was badly scarred by Bram's nails, and the blood was spurting from a  long gash in his throat, made by the sharp flint that was lying beside  him.    He had some time before discarded his fur coat. Now he pulled off his  coat, and, tearing off the tail of his shirt, he made a pad and a  bandage, with which he attempted to staunch the blood and bind the  wound. It must have taken ten minutes before the failing heart force  enabled him to get the bleeding under control. Dodd had nearly bled to  death, his face was drawn and waxen, but, because the pulsation was so  feeble, the artery had ceased to spurt.    Then only did Tommy take notice of Bram. He had been squatting near, and  Tommy realized that he had unconsciously observed Bram put some sort of  pellets into his mouth. Now he realized that Bram was a drug fiend. That  was what had made him walk out of the Greystoke camp in the storm.    Bram got up and came toward them. \"Is he dead?\" he whispered hoarsely.  \"I--I lost my temper. You two--I don't intend to kill you.  There--there's room for the three of us. I've got--plans of the utmost  importance to humanity.\"    \"I don't think much of the way you've started to carry them out,\"  answered Tommy bitterly. \"No, he's not dead yet, but I wouldn't give  much for his chances, even in the best hospital. The best thing you can  do now is to go to hell, and take your beetles with you,\" he added.           *       *       *       *       *    Bram, without replying, raised his head and emitted from his throat the  shrillest whistle that Tommy had ever heard. The response was amazing.    Rasping out of the darkness came eight beetles in pairs. Instead of  leaping from an upright position, they trotted in the manner of horses,  on all fours, their shells, which touched at the edges, forming a solid  surface, gently rounded in the center so that a man's body could lie  there and fit snugly into the groove.    \"Help me get him up,\" said Bram. \"Trust me! I'll do my best for him. If  we leave him here they may kill and eat him. I can't trust all those  beetle guards.\"    Tommy hesitated a moment, then decided to follow Bram's suggestion.  Together they raised the unconscious man to the beetle-shell couch. Bram  seated himself upon the boss of one of the beetle-shells in front, and  Tommy jumped up behind.    Next moment, to his amazement, the trained steeds were flying smoothly  through the air, at a rate that could not have been less than  seventy-five to eighty miles an hour.    Tommy's shell seat was not a bed of roses, but he hardly noticed that.  He was thinking that if Dodd lived they should be able to turn the  tables.    For, unknown to Bram, he was in possession of the cigarette-lighter  which he had picked up, and which Bram, in his agitation, had  forgotten. It was full of petrol, or some other fluid of a similar  nature, which Bram must have obtained from some natural source within  the earth. And, in an emergency, Tommy knew that he had the means of  keeping the beetles at bay.           *       *       *       *       *    They had traveled for perhaps an hour when a faint light began to glow  in the distance. It grew brighter, and a roaring sound became audible. A  turn of the track that they were traversing, and the light became a  glare. A terrific sight met Tommy's eyes.    Out of the bowels of the earth--actually out of the crust beneath their  feet--there shot a pillar of roaring flame, of intense white color, and  radiating a heat that was perceptible even at a distance of several  hundred yards. The beetle steeds dropped gently to the ground; they  halted. Bram got down, grinning.    \"Nicely trained horses, what?\" he asked. \"By the way, you have the  advantage of me in names. Who and what are you?\"    Tommy told him.    \"Well, Travers, it looks as if we're going to be companions for some  time to come, and I quite admit you saved my life back there. So we  don't want to start with secrets. This is a natural petrol spring, which  has probably been burning undiminished for ages. My trained beetles are  blind--you didn't happen to notice I'd cut off their antenna? But the  rest of the swarm daren't come near it. So that makes me their master.    \"Pretty trick, what, Travers? I'm the Lord of the Flame down here, and  I'm using my advantage. But don't get the idea of supplanting me. There  are lots of other tricks you don't know anything about, and I'll have to  trust you better before--\"    He broke off and slipped another pellet into his mouth.    \"Help me get Dodd down, if this is our destination,\" answered Tommy.    They lifted Dodd to the ground. He was conscious now, and moaning for  water. The two men carried him into a sort of large cavern, at the  farther end of which the fire was roaring. Bram went to a spring that  trickled down one side, filled something that looked like a petrified  lily calyx, and brought it to Dodd, who drained it.           *       *       *       *       *    Tommy looked about him. He was astonished to see that the place was, in  a way, furnished. Bram had carved out a very creditable couch, and  several low chairs, evidently with a stone ax, for by the light of the  fire, which cast a fair illumination even at that distance, Tommy could  see the marks of the implement, rough and irregular, in the wood.    On the ground were thick rugs, woven of hair, and two or three more rugs  of the same material lay on the couch. It was evident that the human  herd was expected to furnish textile materials as well as meat.    \"Sit down, and make yourself comfortable,\" said Bram, when they had  raised Dodd to the couch. \"We'll have dinner, and then we'll talk. I can  give you a fine vegetarian meal. Those dirty shrimp-eating savages look  on me as a cannibal because I eat the fruits of the trees.\" He grinned.  \"There's a bad shortage of food in Submundia, as I've named this part of  the world,\" he went on, \"for until I came the beetles simply devoured  the humans wholesale, instead of breeding them, like I taught them. And  there's another of the hundred-and-fifty year swarms due to hatch out  soon. However, we'll talk about that later. And all those fine fruits  going to waste! Excuse me, Travers.\"           *       *       *       *       *    He disappeared, and returned in a minute or two with a small table,  piled high with luscious fruits unknown to Tommy, though among them were  some that looked like loaves of natural bread.
