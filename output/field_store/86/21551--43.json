[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37090"],[0,"Our Knowledge of the External World as a Field for Scientific Method in (#6)"],[1,"that the world has  this or that desirable ethical characteristic--is not one which, so far  as I can see, philosophy can do anything whatever to satisfy. The  difference between a good world and a bad one is a difference in the  particular characteristics of the particular things that exist in these  worlds: it is not a sufficiently abstract difference to come within the  province of philosophy. Love and hate, for example, are ethical  opposites, but to philosophy they are closely analogous attitudes  towards objects. The general form and structure of those attitudes  towards objects which constitute mental phenomena is a problem for  philosophy; but the difference between love and hate is not a difference  of form or structure, and therefore belongs rather to the special  science of psychology than to philosophy. Thus the ethical interests  which have often inspired philosophers must remain in the background:  some kind of ethical interest may inspire the whole study, but none must  obtrude in the detail or be expected in the special results which are  sought.    If this view seems at first sight disappointing, we may remind ourselves  that a similar change has been found necessary in all the other  sciences. The physicist or chemist is not now required to prove the  ethical importance of his ions or atoms; the biologist is not expected  to prove the utility of the plants or animals which he dissects. In  pre-scientific ages this was not the case. Astronomy, for example, was  studied because men believed in astrology: it was thought that the  movements of the planets had the most direct and important bearing upon  the lives of human beings. Presumably, when this belief decayed and the  disinterested study of astronomy began, many who had found astrology  absorbingly interesting decided that astronomy had too little human  interest to be worthy of study. Physics, as it appears in Plato's  _Timaeus_ for example, is full of ethical notions: it is an essential  part of its purpose to show that the earth is worthy of admiration. The  modern physicist, on the contrary, though he has no wish to deny that  the earth is admirable, is not concerned, as physicist, with its ethical  attributes: he is merely concerned to find out facts, not to consider  whether they are good or bad. In psychology, the scientific attitude is  even more recent and more difficult than in the physical sciences: it is  natural to consider that human nature is either good or bad, and to  suppose that the difference between good and bad, so all-important in  practice, must be important in theory also. It is only during the last  century that an ethically neutral science of psychology has grown up;  and here too ethical neutrality has been essential to scientific  success.    In philosophy, hitherto, ethical neutrality has been seldom sought and  hardly ever achieved. Men have remembered their wishes, and have judged  philosophies in relation to their wishes. Driven from the particular  sciences, the belief that the notions of good and evil must afford a key  to the understanding of the world has sought a refuge in philosophy. But  even from this last refuge, if philosophy is not to remain a set of  pleasing dreams, this belief must be driven forth. It is a commonplace  that happiness is not best achieved by those who seek it directly; and  it would seem that the same is true of the good. In thought, at any  rate, those who forget good and evil and seek only to know the facts are  more likely to achieve good than those who view the world through the  distorting medium of their own desires.    The immense extension of our knowledge of facts in recent times has had,  as it had in the Renaissance, two effects upon the general intellectual  outlook. On the one hand, it has made men distrustful of the truth of  wide, ambitious systems: theories come and go swiftly, each serving, for  a moment, to classify known facts and promote the search for new ones,  but each in turn proving inadequate to deal with the new facts when they  have been found. Even those who invent the theories do not, in science,  regard them as anything but a temporary makeshift. The ideal of an  all-embracing synthesis, such as the Middle Ages believed themselves to  have attained, recedes further and further beyond the limits of what  seems feasible. In such a world, as in the world of Montaigne, nothing  seems worth while except the discovery of more and more facts, each in  turn the deathblow to some cherished theory; the ordering intellect  grows weary, and becomes slovenly through despair.    On the other hand, the new facts have brought new powers; man's physical  control over natural forces has been increasing with unexampled  rapidity, and promises to increase in the future beyond all easily  assignable limits. Thus alongside of despair as regards ultimate theory  there is an immense optimism as regards practice: what man can _do_  seems almost boundless. The old fixed limits of human power, such as  death, or the dependence of the race on an equilibrium of cosmic forces,  are forgotten, and no hard facts are allowed to break in upon the dream  of omnipotence. No philosophy is tolerated which sets bounds to man's  capacity of gratifying his wishes; and thus the very despair of theory  is invoked to silence every whisper of doubt as regards the  possibilities of practical achievement.    In the welcoming of new fact, and in the suspicion of dogmatism as  regards the universe at large, the modern spirit should, I think, be  accepted as wholly an advance. But both in its practical pretensions and  in its theoretical despair it seems to me to go too far. Most of what is  greatest in man is called forth in response to the thwarting of his  hopes by immutable natural obstacles; by the pretence of omnipotence, he  becomes trivial and a little absurd. And on the theoretical side,  ultimate metaphysical truth, though less all-embracing and harder of  attainment than it appeared to some philosophers in the past, can, I  believe, be discovered by those who are willing to combine the  hopefulness, patience, and open-mindedness of science with something of  the Greek feeling for beauty in the abstract world of logic and for the  ultimate intrinsic value in the contemplation of truth.    The philosophy, therefore, which is to be genuinely inspired by the  scientific spirit, must deal with somewhat dry and abstract matters, and  must not hope to find an answer to the practical problems of life. To  those who wish to understand much of what has in the past been most  difficult and obscure in the constitution of the universe, it has great  rewards to offer--triumphs as noteworthy as those of Newton and Darwin,  and as important in the long run, for the moulding of our mental habits.  And it brings with it--as a new and powerful method of investigation  always does--a sense of power and a hope of progress more reliable and  better grounded than any that rests on hasty and fallacious  generalisation as to the nature of the universe at large. Many hopes  which inspired philosophers in the past it cannot claim to fulfil; but  other hopes, more purely intellectual, it can satisfy more fully than  former ages could have deemed possible for human minds.          LECTURE II    LOGIC AS THE ESSENCE OF PHILOSOPHY      The topics we discussed in our first lecture, and the topics we shall  discuss later, all reduce themselves, in so far as they are genuinely  philosophical, to problems of logic. This is not due to any accident,  but to the fact that every philosophical problem, when it is subjected  to the necessary analysis and purification, is found either to be not  really philosophical at all, or else to be, in the sense in which we are  using the word, logical. But as the word \"logic\" is never used in the  same sense by two different philosophers, some explanation of what I  mean by the word is indispensable at the outset.    Logic, in the Middle Ages, and down to the present day in teaching,  meant no more than a scholastic collection of technical terms and rules  of syllogistic inference. Aristotle had spoken, and it was the part of  humbler men merely to repeat the lesson after him. The trivial nonsense  embodied in this tradition is still set in examinations, and defended by  eminent authorities as an excellent \"propaedeutic,\" _i.e._ a training in  those habits of solemn humbug which are so great a help in later life.  But it is not this that I mean to praise in saying that all philosophy  is logic. Ever since the beginning of the seventeenth century, all  vigorous minds that have concerned themselves with inference have  abandoned the mediaeval tradition, and in one way or other have widened  the scope of logic.    The first extension was the introduction of the inductive method by  Bacon and Galileo--by the former in a theoretical and largely mistaken  form, by the latter in actual use in establishing the foundations of  modern physics and astronomy. This is probably the only extension of the  old logic which has become familiar to the general educated public. But  induction, important as it is when regarded as a method of  investigation, does not seem to remain when its work is done: in the  final form of a perfected science, it would seem that everything ought  to be deductive. If induction remains at all, which is a difficult  question, it will remain merely as one of the principles according to  which deductions are effected. Thus the ultimate result of the  introduction of the inductive method seems not the creation of a new  kind of non-deductive reasoning, but rather the widening of the scope of  deduction by pointing out a way of deducing which is certainly not  syllogistic, and does not fit into the mediaeval scheme.    The question of the scope and validity of induction is of great  difficulty, and of great importance to our knowledge. Take such a  question as, \"Wil"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37101"],[0,"Humpback Whales in Glacier Bay National Monument, Alaska (#6)"],[1,"t;     2) the development of a universal and/or site-specific definition      of \"harassment\" to apply to humpback whales in Glacier Bay,      southeast Alaska and the North Pacific in general;     3) the development and implementation of a long-range      research/management plan for the Monument including whale and      environmental monitoring;     4) a determination as to the direct and indirect effects of      incidental take, whale watching, fishing activity, etc. on humpback      whales in Glacier Bay, Southeast Alaska and the North Pacific in      general; and     5) a determination as to the long-term cumulative impacts of the      degradation and destruction of habitat on the survival of the      humpback whale throughout its range in the North Pacific.            AGENCY RESPONSIBILITIES AND NEED FOR  COOPERATION AND COORDINATION      There are many individuals, groups and organizations interested or  involved in finding solutions to problems associated with humpback  whales and human activities in Glacier Bay. The need for management  planning and research programs has been identified. The  identification of interested and responsible organizations is  necessary so that cooperative, coordinated planning and research can  occur. Hopefully, by developing such plans or projects, minimum  resources will be expended to obtain satisfactory solutions. In  addition, by involving all interested and responsible individuals,  groups, or organizations at an early stage, cooperative efforts can be  maximized and disagreements identified and minimized.    The prime responsibilities of the National Marine Fisheries Service  and the National Park Service have been identified. Other Federal  agencies that should or might profitably be involved include the  Bureau of Land Management, the Office of Coastal Zone Management, Sea  Grant, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Geological Survey,  the U.S. Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the  Army Corps of Engineers. State agencies that should or might be  profitably involved include the Alaska Department of Fish and Game,  the State Coastal Zone Management Commission, and the Alaska  Department of Natural Resources. Commercial and recreational companies  that organize fishing, tour, and charter activities, private boaters,  academic/scientific communities, and environmental organizations are  also important. Some of these organizations have on-going, or plan to  initiate, research projects, which may provide data and information of  importance to the problems discussed in this report.    The Bureau of Land Management, New York Outer Continental Shelf (OCS)  Office, is presently initiating noise effects studies on marine  mammals. The U.S. Geological Survey at Tacoma, Washington and Menlo  Park, California is describing and mapping marine sediment  distribution, thickness and characteristics within Glacier Bay. J. P.  Mathews, of the Institute of Marine Science, University of Alaska, is  summarizing the physical characteristics, especially water mass  characteristics and dynamics, of Glacier Bay. If possible, these  studies should be coordinated such that a maximum amount of  information can be obtained and used in the management and research  activities related to Glacier Bay National Monument and the humpback  whale.          SUMMARY      Humpback whales in the North Pacific are migratory, spending the  summer months in northern waters including the inland waters of  southeast Alaska. Records have been maintained on the number of  identifiable humpbacks seen in these waters including Glacier Bay. In  1978, humpbacks departed Glacier Bay after being \"in residence\" for a  far shorter time period than recorded previously; all but three whales  left the Bay within 24 hours of entering in 1979.    There has been an increase in vessel traffic and activity within  Glacier Bay during the 1970's. Such activity may have been a factor in  the movement of humpbacks from Glacier Bay. Other factors which may  have been at least contributing but for which no known information  exists, or is inadequate at best, include: natural environmental  changes (chemical, physical, biological) or natural changes in the  movement of the whales.    Present management and research plans and activities did not  anticipate and, therefore, are inadequate to deal effectively with  present day problems associated with a rapidly growing influx of  people and vessels/aircraft into any environment with limited space  and resources. Some human activities and the activities and behavioral  patterns of humpback whales may be mutually exclusive.    The most apparent important short-term research need is to analyze and  evaluate all available data, in order to develop short and long term  management plans and research programs.
