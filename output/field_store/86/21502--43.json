[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3434"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#6)"],[1,"the state of Arabia previous to the time of  Muhammad was one of preparedness for a new religion that the scattered  elements were there, and wanted only the mind of a master to harmonise and  enforce them and that Islam was, so to speak, a necessity of the time.15  Still Muhammad's career is a wonderful instance of the force and life that  resides in him who possesses an intense Faith in God and in the unseen world;  and whatever deductions may be madeand they are many and seriousfrom the  noble and truthful in his character, he will always be regarded as one of  those who have had that influence over the faith, morals, and whole earthly  life of their fellow-men, which none but a really great man ever did, or can,  exercise; and as one of those, whose efforts to propagate some great verity  will prosper, in spite of manifold personal errors and defects, both of  principle and character.    The more insight we obtain, from undoubted historical sources, into the  actual character of Muhammad, the less reason do we find to justify the  strong vituperative language poured out upon his head by Maracci, Prideaux,  and others, in recent days, one of whom has found, in the Byzantine  \"Maometis,\" the number of the Beast (Rev. xii)! It is nearer to the truth to  say that he was a great though imperfect character, an earnest though  mistaken teacher, and that many of his mistakes and imperfections were the  result of circumstances, of temperament, and constitution; and that there  must be elements both of truth and goodness in the system of which he was the  main author, to account for the world-wide phenomenon, that whatever may be  the intellectual inferiority (if such is, indeed, the fact) of the Muslim  races, the influence of his teaching, aided, it is true, by the vast impulse  given to it by the victorious arms of his followers, has now lasted for  nearly thirteen centuries, and embraces more than one hundred millions of our  racemore than one-tenth part of the inhabitants of the globe.    It must be acknowledged, too, that the Koran deserves the highest praise for  its conceptions of the Divine nature, in reference to the attributes of  Power, Knowledge, and universal Providence and Unitythat its belief and  trust in the One God of Heaven and Earth is deep and ferventand that, though  it contains fantastic visions and legends, teaches a childish ceremonial, and  justifies bloodshedding, persecution, slavery, and polygamy, yet that at the  same time it embodies much of a noble and deep moral earnestness, and  sententious oracular wisdom, and has proved that there are elements in it on  which mighty nations, and conquering though not, perhaps, durableempires can  be built up. It is due to the Koran, that the occupants in the sixth century  of an arid peninsula, whose poverty was only equalled by their ignorance,  become not only the fervent and sincere votaries of a new creed, but, like  Amru and many more, its warlike propagators. Impelled possibly by drought and  famine, actuated partly by desire of conquest, partly by religious  convictions, they had conquered Persia in the seventh century, the northern  coasts of Africa, and a large portion of Spain in the eighth, the Punjaub and  nearly the whole of India in the ninth. The simple shepherds and wandering  Bedouins of Arabia, are transformed, as if by a magician's wand, into the  founders of empires, the builders of cities, the collectors of more libraries  than they at first destroyed, while cities like Fostât, Baghdad, Cordova, and  Delhi, attest the power at which Christian Europe trembled. And thus, while  the Koran, which underlays this vast energy and contains the principles which  are its springs of action, reflects to a great extent the mixed character of  its author, its merits as a code of laws, and as a system of religious  teaching, must always be estimated by the changes which it introduced into  the customs and beliefs of those who willingly or by compulsion embraced it.  In the suppression of their idolatries, in the substitution of the worship of  Allah for that of the powers of nature and genii with Him, in the abolition  of child murder, in the extinction of manifold superstitious usages, in the  reduction of the number of wives to a fixed standard, it was to the Arabians  an unquestionable blessing, and an accession, though not in the Christian  sense a Revelation, of Truth; and while every Christian must deplore the  overthrow of so many flourishing Eastern churches by the arms of the  victorious Muslims, it must not be forgotten that Europe, in the middle ages,  owed much of her knowledge of dialectic philosophy, of medicine, and  architecture, to Arabian writers, and that Muslims formed the connecting link  between the West and the East for the importation of numerous articles of  luxury and use. That an immense mass of fable and silly legend has been built  up upon the basis of the Koran is beyond a doubt, but for this Muhammad is  not answerable, any more than he is for the wild and bloodthirsty excesses of  his followers in after ages. I agree with Sale in thinking that, \"how  criminal soever Muhammad may have been in imposing a false religion on  mankind, the praises due to his real virtues ought not to be denied him\"  (Preface), and venture to think that no one can rise from the perusal of his  Koran without argeeing with that motto from St. Augustin, which Sale has  prefixed to his title page, \"Nulla falsa doctrina est, quæ non aliquid veri  permisceat.\" Qust. Evang. ii. 40.    The Arabic text from which this translation has been made is that of Fluegel.  Leips. 1841. The translations of Sale, Ullmann, Wahl, Hammer von Purgstall in  the Fundgruben des Orients, and M. Kasimirski, have been collated throughout;  and above all, the great work of Father Maracci, to whose accuracy and  research search Sale's work mainly owes its merits. Sale has, however,  followed Maracci too closely, especially by introducing his paraphrastic  comments into the body of the text, as well as by his constant use of  Latinised instead of Saxon words. But to Sale's \"Preliminary Discourse\" the  reader is referred, as to a storehouse of valuable information; as well as to  the works of Geiger, Gerock, and Freytag, and to the lives of Muhammad by Dr.  Weil, Mr. Muir, and that of Dr. Sprenger now issuing from the press, in  German. The more brief and poetical verses of the earlier Suras are  translated with a freedom from which I have altogether abstained in the  historical and prosaic portions; but I have endeavoured nowhere to use a  greater amount of paraphrase than is necessary to convey the sense of the  original. \"Vel verbum e verbo,\" says S. Jerome (Præf. in Jobum) of versions,  \"vel sensum e sensu, vel ex utroque commixtum, et medie temperatum genus  translationis.\" The proper names are usually given as in our Scriptures: the  English reader would not easily recognise Noah as Nûh, Lot as Lût, Moses as  Musa, Abraham as Ibrahym, Pharaoh as Firaun, Aaron as Harun, Jesus as Isa,  John as Yahia, etc.; and it has been thought best to give different  renderings of the same constantly recurring words and phrases, in order more  fully to convey their meaning. For instance, the Arabic words which mean  Companions of the fire, are also rendered inmates of, etc., given up to,  etc.; the People of the Book, i.e. Jews, Christians and Sabeites, is  sometimes retained, sometimes paraphrased. This remark applies to such words  as tanzyl, lit. downsending or Revelation; zikr, the remembrance or constant  repetition or mention of God's name as an act of devotion; saha, the Hour of  present or final judgment; and various epithets of Allah.    I have nowhere attempted to represent the rhymes of the original. The  \"Proben\" of H. v. Purgstall, in the Fundgruben des Orients, excellent as they  are in many respects, shew that this can only be done with a sacrifice of  literal translation. I subjoin as a specimen Lieut. Burton's version of the  Fatthah, or opening chapter of previous editions. See Sura [viii.] p. 28.     1  In the Name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate!   2  Praise be to Allah, who the three worlds made.   3  The Merciful, the Compassionate,   4  The King of the day of Fate.   5  Thee alone do we worship, and of thee alone do we ask aid.   6  Guide us to the path that is straight   7   The path of those to whom thy love is great,    Not those on whom is hate,    Nor they that deviate.  Amen.    \"I have endeavoured,\" he adds, \"in this translation to imitate the imperfect  rhyme of the original Arabic. Such an attempt, however, is full of  difficulties. The Arabic is a language in which, like Italian, it is almost  impossible not to rhyme.\" Pilgr. ii. 78.      1  Mishcât, vol. i. p. 524.  E. Trans. B. viii. 3, 3.    2  Mishcât, as above.

These areas were utilized only  at certain seasons, but by 1948 the effect of trampling and heavy  browsing by livestock was conspicuous. Herbaceous ground vegetation  was almost lacking and low woody vegetation was also scarce, in  contrast to the parts of the woodland that were adjacent but separated  by fences that excluded livestock. The contrast was perhaps heightened  along the fences because the animals tended to follow along the fence  lines and their effects were concentrated there.

For both browsed and unbrowsed samples, the strips had a total length  of 4000 feet, each representing an area of .919 acres. Table 4  contrasts the number of young trees per acre on the browsed and  unbrowsed areas, grouped in several size classes. In general the  saplings up to one-fourth inch in diameter were those that had become  established in the five growing seasons since browsing was  discontinued and both areas were protected. For this size group the  numbers were approximately equal, being slightly higher on the browsed  strips. However, in the size group of 1/2 inch to 4 inches in stem  diameter, the trees were nearly three times as abundant on the  unbrowsed areas, and most trees within this size range must have  become established within the time of differing treatments. The  disparity in numbers was great for hackberry, redbud, elm and dogwood  which made up the bulk of the saplings. In the size range 5 to 12  inches most trees antedated the fence, and the unbrowsed portion had  only a few more than the portion that had been browsed.    On the formerly browsed areas clumps of gooseberry bushes were  conspicuous and were computed to cover 3.81 per cent of the area  sampled, versus 2.87 per cent on the unbrowsed area. These thorny  bushes seem to be resistant to browsing, and elsewhere have been noted  in abundance in woodlands heavily used by livestock. The elimination  of competing undergrowth by browsers may be a factor favoring  development of gooseberry clumps. The trend was just the opposite for  fragrant sumac, which was computed to cover 1.94 per cent of the  browsed sample versus 3.23 per cent of the unbrowsed sample.  Greenbrier (_Smilax tamnoides hispida_) was most abundant on the  unbrowsed strips, with seven large clumps, and 56 smaller clumps (10  stems or fewer) as contrasted with five large clumps and 32 smaller  clumps on the browsed strips. There were 32 grapevines (_Vitis  vulpina_) on the unbrowsed strips and only seven on those that were  browsed.          Animal Associates      The invertebrates of the University of Kansas Natural History  Reservation have not been intensively studied. Most of the species of  vertebrates are characteristic of the deciduous forest of the eastern  United States, or of the edge of woodland; relatively few kinds are  characteristic of prairies.    Of birds, for example, some 23 species characteristic of the eastern  deciduous forests have been found nesting on the Reservation, as have  14 additional species that are mainly eastern in their distribution  but are most characteristic of forest-edge thickets, clearings, or  marshy places. The ruffed grouse (_Bonasa umbellus_) and wild turkey  (_Meleagris gallopavo_) are not present on the area, although they may  have occurred there earlier. Other forest birds which occur in the  general area, and which have been recorded from time to time on the  Reservation, although they seem not to nest there, are:  chuck-will's-widow (_Caprimulgus carolinensis_), scarlet tanager  (_Piranga olivacea_), Acadian flycatcher (_Empidonax virescens_),  veery (_Hylocichla fuscescens_), parula warbler (_Parula americana_),  oven-bird (_Seiurus aurocapillus_), and orchard oriole (_Icterus  spurius_). For each of these, habitat conditions on the Reservation  seem to be deficient in some respect. On the other hand, the only  typical prairie bird that breeds on the Reservation is the dickcissel  (_Spiza americana_). Others, including the Swainson hawk (_Buteo  swainsoni_), greater prairie chicken (_Tympanuchus cupido_), upland  plover (_Bartramia longicauda_), western kingbird (_Tyrannus  verticalis_) and loggerhead shrike (_Lanius ludovicianus_), occur in  the general area, and may even cross the Reservation at times, but  they do not become established.    In the mammalian fauna, species typical of the deciduous forests  include the opossum (_Didelphis marsupialis_), short-tailed shrew  (_Blarina brevicauda_), eastern mole (_Scalopus aquaticus_), eastern  gray squirrel (_Sciurus carolinensis_), and pine vole (_Microtus  pinetorum_), but the eastern chipmunk (_Tamias striatus_) and southern  flying squirrel (_Glaucomys volans_) are lacking. Also, the present  fauna lacks large mammals that may have been present under original  conditions: the white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_), recorded  on the area from time to time but not permanently established there,  the wapiti (_Cervus americanus_), black bear (Ursus americanus), and  bobcat (_Lynx rufus_). Other species on the area, that are  characteristic of the deciduous woodlands, but that occur also far  west into prairie regions, include the little short-tailed shrew  (_Cryptotis parva_), raccoon (_Procyon lotor_), fox squirrel (_Sciurus  niger_), white-footed mouse (_Peromyscus leucopus_), eastern woodrat  (_Neotoma floridana_) and eastern cottontail. On the area, the only  mammals that are sharply confined to grasslands, elsewhere as well as  on the Reservation, are the plains pocket gopher (_Geomys bursarius_)  and plains harvest mouse (_Reithrodontomys montanus_), both of which  are rare on the area, and the hispid cotton rat (_Sigmodon hispidus_).  The following species are typical of the plains, but they range  eastward into the region of deciduous forests: western harvest mouse  (_Reithrodontomys megalotis_), deer mouse (_Peromyscus maniculatus_),  coyote (_Canis latrans_), and spotted skunk (_Spilogale putorius_).  The following mammals, typical of grassland, are absent: black-tailed  jack rabbit (_Lepus californicus_), black-tailed prairie dog (_Cynomys  ludovicianus_), 13-lined ground squirrel (_Spermophilus  tridecemlineatus_), Franklin's ground squirrel (_Spermophilus  franklinii_), southern lemming-mouse (_Synaptomys cooperi_), and of  course, the buffalo (_Bison bison_), and the prong-horned antelope  (_Antilocapra americana_) long extinct in this part of their range.    Of amphibians and reptiles also, the majority are typical forest  species, including: the American toad (_Bufo terrestris_), common tree  frog (_Hyla versicolor_), brown skink (_Lygosoma laterale_), common  five-lined skink (_Eumeces fasciatus_), worm snake (_Carphophis  amoenus_), pilot black snake (_Elaphe obsoleta_), DeKay snake  (_Storeria dekayi_), western ground snake (_Haldea valeriae_),  copperhead (_Agkistrodon contortrix_), and timber rattlesnake  (_Crotalus horridus_). Other typical forest species missing from the  area include the spring peeper (_Hyla crucifer_), Carolina box turtle  (_Terrapene carolina_), coal skink (_Eumeces anthracinus_), and  red-bellied snake (_Storeria occipitomaculata_). Of typical prairie  species only the Kansas ant-eating frog (_Gastrophryne olivacea_) and  the ornate box turtle (_Terrapene ornata_) are common, and, curiously,  each seems to prefer a forest habitat on this area, in the absence of  their"]]]
