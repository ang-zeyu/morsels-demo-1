In  such cases I do not pretend to decide; the object of my labours being  only to trace the vicissitudes of the art in various places, and to  point out those artists who have exercised an influence over them; not  to determine disputes, unpleasant in themselves, and wholly foreign to  my undertaking.      [Footnote 2: See Algarotti, _Saggio sopra la Pittura_, in the chapter  _Della critica necessaria al Pittore_.]    [Footnote 3: For this fault, which the Greeks used to call _Acribia_,  Pascoli has been sharply reproved. He has, in fact, informed us which  among the several artists could boast a becoming and proportionate nose,  which had it short or long, aquiline or snubbed, very sharp or very  hollow. He most generally observes that such an artist was neither tall  nor large of stature, neither handsome nor plain in his physiognomy; and  who would have thought it worth his while to inquire about it? The sole  utility that can possibly attend such inquiries is, the chance of  detecting some impostor, who might attempt to palm upon us for a genuine  portrait the likeness of some other individual. Engravings, however, are  the best security against similar impositions.]    [Footnote 4: In the Magasin Encyclopedique of Paris, (An. viii. tom. iv.  p. 63), there is a work in two volumes, edited in the German language at  Gottingen, announced as well as commended. The first volume is dated  1798, the second 1801, from the pen of note the learned Sig. Florillo,  the title of which we insert in the second index. It consists of a  history of painting upon the plan of the present one; but there is some  variation in the order of the schools.]    [Footnote 5: It was finished in the year 1796, and it is now given, with  various additions and corrections throughout. Many churches, galleries,  and pictures, are here mentioned which are no longer in existence; but  this does not interfere with its truth, inasmuch as the title of the  work is confined to the before mentioned year. Numerous friends have  lent me their assistance in the completion of this edition, and in  particular the cavalier Gio. de' Lazara, a gentleman of Padua, who  possesses a rich collection, both in books and MSS., and displays the  utmost liberality in affording others the use of them. To this merit, in  regard to the present work, he has likewise added that of revising and  correcting it through the press, a favour which I could not have more  highly estimated from any other hand, deeply versed as he is in the  history of the fine arts.]    [Footnote 6: \"Ut enim pictores, et qui signa faciunt, et vero etiam  poetae suum quisque opus a vulgo considerari vult, ut si quid reprehensum  sit a pluribus id corrigatur ... sic aliorum judicio permulta nobis et  facienda et non facienda, et mutanda et corrigenda sunt.\" Cicero De  Officiis, ii. c. 41.]    [Footnote 7: Treatise on Painting, tom. ii. p. 166.]    [Footnote 8: Opere, tom. ii. p. 108.]    [Footnote 9: A learned Venetian, skilled in the practice of design and  of painting. He must not be confounded with Antonio Maria Zanetti, an  eminent engraver, who revived the art of taking prints from wooden  blocks with more than one colour, which was invented by Ugo da Carpi,  but afterwards lost. He also wrote works, serviceable to the fine arts;  and several of his letters may be seen in the second volume of _Lettere  Pittoriche_. They are subscribed _Antonio Maria Zanetti, q. Erasmo_; but  this is an error of the editor: it ought to be _q. Girolamo_, to  distinguish him from the other, who was called _del q. Alessandro_. This  mistake was detected by the accurate Vianelli, in his Diario della  Carriera, p. 49.]    [Footnote 10: An amateur, who happens to be unacquainted with the fact,  that there were various artists of the same name, as the Vecelli,  Bassani, and Caracci, will never become properly acquainted with these  families of painters; neither will he be competent to judge of certain  pictures, which only attract the regard of the vulgar, because they  truly boast the reputation of a great name.]    [Footnote 11: I do not admit this principle. Horace laid it down for the  art of poetry alone, because it is a faculty that perishes when it  ceases to give delight. Architecture, on the other hand, confers vast  utility when it does not please, by presenting us with habitations; and  painting, and sculpture, by preserving the features of men, and  illustrious actions. Besides, let us recollect, that Horace denounces  the production of inferior verses, because there is not space enough for  them; \"Non concessere columnae,\" but it is not so with paintings of  mediocrity. In any country Petrarch, Ariosto, and Tasso, may be read,  and he who has never read a poor poet, will write better than if he had  read a hundred. But it is not every one who can boast either in the  houses or temples of his country, of possessing the works of good  artists; and for purposes of worship or of ornament, the less excellent  ones may suffice; wherefore these also produce some advantage.]    [Footnote 12: Like one who thinks of some other person than he that is  before him.]    [Footnote 13: For the improvement of my latest edition, I am greatly  indebted to the Prince Filippo Ercolani, who, having purchased from the  heirs of Signor Marcello Oretti fifty-two manuscript volumes, which that  indefatigable amateur, in the course of his studies, journeys, and  observations, had compiled respecting the professors of the fine arts,  their eras, and their labours, allowed materials to be drawn from them  for various notes, by the Sig. Lazara, who superintended the edition. To  the devoted attachment of these gentlemen to the fine arts, the public  are indebted for much information, either wholly new, or hitherto little  known.]    [Footnote 14: Vasari, from whom several epochs are taken, is full of  errors in dates, as may be every where perceived. See Bottari's note on  tom. ii. p. 79. The same observation applies generally to other authors,  as Bottari remarks in a note on _Lettere Pittoriche_, tom. iv. p. 366. A  similar objection is made to the Dictionary of P. Orlandi in another  letter, tom. ii. p. 318, where it is termed \"a useful work, but so full  of errors, that one can derive no benefit from it without possessing the  books there quoted.\" After three editions of this work, a fourth was  printed in Venice, in 1753, corrected and enlarged by Guarienti, \"but  enough still remains to be done after his additions, even to increase it  twofold.\" Bottari, Lett. Pitt. tom. iii. p. 353. See also Crespi _Vite  de' Pittori Bolognesi_, p. 50. No one, who has not perused this book,  would believe how often he defaces Orlandi in presuming to correct him;  multiplying artists for every little difference with which authors wrote  the name of the same man. Thus Pier Antonio Torre, and Antonio Torri, are  with him two different men. Many of the articles, however, added by him,  relating to artists unknown to P. Orlandi, are useful; so that this  second Dictionary ought to be consulted with caution, not altogether  rejected. The last edition, printed at Florence, in two volumes,  contains the names of many painters, either lately dead, or still  living, and often of very inferior merit, and on this account is little  noticed in my history. This Dictionary, moreover, affords little  satisfaction to the reader concerning the old masters, unless he possess  a work printed at Florence in twelve volumes, entitled _Serie degli  Uomini piu illustri in Pittura_, to which the articles in it often  refer. The Dizionario Portatile, by Mr. La Combe, is also a book of  reference, not very valuable to those who look for exact information. We  give a single instance of his inaccuracy in regard to the elder Palma;  but our emendations have been chiefly directed towards the writers of  Italy, from whom foreigners have, or ought to have borrowed, in writing  respecting our artists.]    [Footnote 15: See Mr. Richardson's _Treatise on Painting_, tom. ii. p.  58; and M. D'Argenville's _Abrege de la Vie des plus fameux Peintres_,  tom. i. p. 65.]    [Footnote 16: \"Some made use of pure colours, without blending one with  the other; a practice well understood in the age of Titiano: others, as  Coreggio, adopted a method totally opposite: he laid on his admirable  colours in such a manner, that they appear as if they had been breathed  without effort on the canvas; so soft and so clear, without harshness of  outline, and so relieved, that he seems the rival of nature. The elder  Palma and Lorenzo Lotto coloured freshly, and finished their pictures as  highly as Giovanni Bellini; but they have loaded and overwhelmed them  with outline and softness in the style of Titiano and Giorgione. Some  others, as Tintoretto, to a purity of colour not inferior to the artists  above mentioned, have added a boldness as grand as it is astonishing;\"  &c. Baldinucci, Lett. Pittor. tom. ii. lett. 126.]    [Footnote 17: See Baldinucci in _Lett. Pittor._ tom. ii. lett. 126, and  one by Crespi, tom. iv. lett. 162.]    [Footnote 18: We must recollect that \"de pictore, sculptore, fusore,  judicare nisi artifex non potest,\" (Plin. Jun. i. epist. 10); which must  be understood of certain refinements of the art that may escape the eye  of the most learned connoisseur. But have we any need of a painter to  whisper in our ear whether the features of a figure are handsome or  ugly, its colouring false or natural, whether it has harmony and  expression, or whether its composition be in the Roman or Venetian  taste? And where it is really expedient to have the opinion of an  artist, which we therefore report as we have either read it or heard it,  will that opinion have less authority in my pages than on his own  tongue?]    [Footnote 19: Abundance of quotations, and descriptions of the minutest"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34501"],[0,"Wolf and Coyote Trapping: An Up-to-Date Wolf Hunter's Guide (#6)"],[1,"everywhere proved an incentive to fraud, and  thousands of dollars are wasted annually in paying bounties on coyote  scalps offered in place of wolves, and on the scalps of dogs, foxes,  coons, badgers, and even cats, which are palmed off for wolves and  coyotes. If in all states having the bounty system whole skins,  including nose, ears, feet, and tail of both adult and young animals,  were required as valid evidence for bounty payments, the possibility  of deception would be reduced to a minimum. The common practice of  paying bounty on scalps alone, or in some cases merely the ears, is  dangerous, as even an expert can not always positively identify such  fragments. A satisfactory way of marking skins on which the bounty  has been paid is by a slit 4 to 6 inches long between the ears. This  does not injure the skins for subsequent use. If all bounty-paying  states would adopt such a system, the possibility of collecting more  than one bounty on the same skin in different states would be  avoided.\"    \"The following directions have been prepared as an aid to county and  state officers in identifying scalps, skins, and skulls of wolves and  coyotes, the pups of wolves, coyotes, red, grey, and kit foxes, and  young bob-cats, coons and badgers.\"    \"The variation in dogs is so great that no one set of characters will  always distinguish them from wolves or coyotes, but when there is  reason to suspect that dogs are being presented for bounties, their  skins and skulls should be sent to the Biological Survey for positive  identification. It goes without saying that anyone detected in such  fraud should be prosecuted with a view to the suppression of these  dishonest practices.\"    KEY TO ADULT WOLVES AND COYOTES.

[Illustration: Difference in Sizes of Noes, Heel Pads and  Canine Teeth of Wolves and Coyotes.]    KEY TO WOLF, COYOTE AND FOX PUPS.      Wolf Pups.      Muzzle blackish at birth, fading in a month or 6 weeks to        greyish.      Head greyish in decided contrast to black of back, nose and ears.      Ears black at tips, fading to greyish in a month or 6 weeks.      Tail black, fading to grey with black tip.      Coyote Pups.      Muzzle tawny, or yellowish brown, becoming more yellowish with        age.      Head yellowish grey, not strongly contrasted with rest of body.      Ears dark brown at tips and back, soon fading to yellowish brown.      Tail black, fading to grey with black tip.      Red Fox Pups.      Muzzle blackish.      Head dusky with side of face light yellowish.      Ears large, nearly the whole back of ears bright black at all        ages.      Eyes and ears relatively larger and nose pad smaller than in        coyote or wolf.      Tail dusky, tip white at all ages.      Grey Fox Pups.      Muzzle blackish.      Head greyish, face back or eyes sharply pepper and salt grey.      Ears large, back of ears dusky at tip, fulvous at base.      Eyes and nose pad small.      Tail with tip black at all ages.      Kit Fox Pups.      Muzzle with blackish patch on each side.      Head and face tawny or yellowish brown.      Ears tawny without black backs or tips.      Eyes larger and nose pad smaller than in young coyote.      Tail with tip black at all ages.    KEY TO YOUNG CATS, COONS AND BADGERS.      Young bobcats are much striped and spotted. Young cats of any kind      can be distinguished by the short nose and round head.    Young coons have a broad black band across the face and eyes      bordered above by a light band.    Young badgers have a white stripe between the eyes.    The bounty laws have always been a good thing for the trapper as they  have helped much towards making his occupation a lucrative one, but,  as before explained, it is doubtful if it has ever, in any marked  degree, tended to decrease the numbers of predatory animals.    It is true that continued trapping will cause the numbers of wolves  and coyotes to diminish, but would not the trapping be prosecuted  practically the same, even if there were no bounties? We believe that  it would, for if the bounty offered were any great incentive, there  would be more trapping done during the summer when the furs were of  no account.    Neither do we believe that it ever induces others, not trappers, to  kill these animals, for they will kill them on every opportunity,  bounty or no bounty. It is man's nature to kill, for he is the enemy  of all animal life.        CHAPTER V.    HUNTING YOUNG WOLVES AND COYOTES.    Of the many methods of hunting and otherwise capturing wolves and  coyotes, employed by the professional \"wolfers\" of the west, none is  more remunerative than the hunting of the young animals during the  spring season. While the fur of the adult animals is of little value  at that time and that of the young is not worth saving, the bounty  which is usually paid for wolf and coyote pups will fully compensate  for all loss from that source. At that time of year (March, April and  May) there is very little fur of any value, to be had but the wolf  hunter can combine wolf trapping and the hunting of the parent  animals with the killing of the young, and the large bounties paid by  many of the states and the various provinces of Canada, will alone  enable one to do a profitable business.    In those parts of our country where the extermination of the wolves  and coyotes is necessary for the protection of stock and game and the  authorities and stockmen co-operate for the destruction of predatory  animals, the hunting of the young animals during the breeding season  should be especially encouraged. In no other way can the number of  wolves be so surely reduced. To those who are well acquainted with  the habits of the wolf, their time of breeding and the most favored  breeding grounds, this mode of hunting is very simple.      [Illustration: A Wyoming Wolf Den.]      [Illustration: A Near View of the Den.]    Wolves breed much earlier than is commonly supposed, even by stockmen  who have resided for a considerable length of time in the wolf  country. The majority of young wolves are born in March in the  Western States and the young of the coyote make their appearance  mainly in April, but occasional litters of both will appear in May,  and grey wolves may be born at any time during the summer.    On the western cattle range, the dens of the wolf and coyote are  located mainly in the valleys among the foothills of the mountain  ranges and among the low mountains, but seldom at any great  elevation. The steep side of a hill or canyon facing the south is the  most favored location, and the rougher and more broken and brushy the  ground, the better it suits the wolves for denning purposes. They  especially like knolls, strewn with large boulders, from which the  male parent can watch for the approach of enemies.    As before mentioned, the mode of hunting is very simple. All that is  necessary is to look carefully over the breeding grounds until tracks  are found and these should be followed to the den. It is safe to say  that at that time of year, nine out of every ten tracks will lead to  a den. On the northern portions of the range, there is almost certain  to be good tracking snow during the early part of the breeding  season, but even if the ground is bare it is not generally a  difficult matter to trail the animals to the den. A track that has  been made in the evening should be followed backwards and one made in  the morning should be followed forwards, as the wolves do most of  their hunting at night and return to the den in the early morning.  When the track can not be followed, if one can get the general course  of it, the lay of the land will enable one, on many occasions, to  locate the den.    Whenever the hunter hears of wolves, or their signs having been seen  frequently, he should make a diligent search for the den. As the old  mother wolf always goes to the nearest water to drink, the number of  tracks at a watering place will often be a dead give-away and a  careful search of the locality will usually result in the discovery  of the den. As the den is approached, the tracks will become more  numerous, and near by there will be well beaten trails. Where tracks  are numerous one should keep watch for the male, sentinel wolf, as he  will always be on the lookout somewhere near the den and his position  will enable one to locate it more readily. As one approaches, the  male animal will howl and endeavor to draw the hunter off in pursuit  and thus prevent the finding of the den. Their tricks on such  occasions show considerable intelligence.    When looking for dens on bare ground, a dog, if he understands the  work is very useful. A fox hound that is well trained on fox is good,  but if trained for this style of hunting especially, will be found to  be better. Unless on the trail of a bachelor wolf, which by the way  are occasionally found during the breeding season, the dog will  readily trail the wolf to the den. It is best to go early in the  morning as the trail will be fresher at that time and the dog is more  apt to follow a fresh trail, therefore, more certain of locating the  den. In all probability, one of the old wolves will attempt to draw  the dog off for a mile or two, but in that case the mother will  endeavor to return to her young. Sometimes they find it necessary to  fight the dogs and try to keep them from approaching too near the  den. Anyway the actions of the animals will show when they are in the  vicinity of the den, which may "]]]
