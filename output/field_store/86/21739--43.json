They passed Bill  Britterling, standing in the mud, an old friend of Bert's. Bert's  face, twisted with pain, looked up to Bill for some sympathy.    \"Lucky devil,\" said Bill.    Across the way on the other side of No Man's Land there was mud the  same as on Bill's side: only the mud over there stank; it didn't seem  to have been kept clean somehow. And the parapet was sliding away in  places, for working parties had not had much of a chance. They had  three Tok Emmas working in that battalion front line, and the British  batteries did not quite know where they were, and there were eight of  them looking.    Fritz Groedenschasser, standing in that unseemly mud, greatly yearned  for them to find soon what they were looking for. Eight batteries  searching for something they can't find, along a trench in which you  have to be, leaves the elephant hunter's most desperate tale a little  dull and insipid. Not that Fritz Groedenschasser knew anything about  elephant hunting: he hated all things sporting, and cordially approved  of the execution of Nurse Cavell. And there was thermite too.  Flammenwerfer was all very well, a good German weapon: it could burn a  man alive at twenty yards. But this accursed flaming English thermite  could catch you at four miles. It wasn't fair.    The three German trench mortars were all still firing. When would the  English batteries find what they were looking for, and this awful  thing stop? The night was cold and smelly.    Fritz shifted his feet in the foul mud, but no warmth came to him that  way.    A gust of shells was coming along the trench. Still they had not found  the minnewerfer! Fritz moved from his place altogether to see if he  could find some place where the parapet was not broken. And as he  moved along the sewerlike trench he came on a wooden cross that marked  the grave of a man he once had known, now buried some days in the  parapet, old Ritz Handelscheiner.    \"Lucky devil,\" said Fritz.          The Master of No Man's Land      When the last dynasty has fallen and the last empire passed away, when  man himself has gone, there will probably still remain the swede. [The  rutabaga or Swedish turnip.]    There grew a swede in No Man's Land by Croisille near the Somme, and  it had grown there for a long while free from man.    It grew as you never saw a swede grow before. It grew tall and strong  and weedy. It lifted its green head and gazed round over No Man's  Land. Yes, man was gone, and it was the day of the swede.    The storms were tremendous. Sometimes pieces of iron sang through its  leaves. But man was gone and it was the day of the swede.    A man used to come there once, a great French farmer, an oppressor of  swedes. Legends were told of him and his herd of cattle, dark  traditions that passed down vegetable generations. It was somehow  known in those fields that the man ate swedes.    And now his house was gone and he would come no more.    The storms were terrible, but they were better than man. The swede  nodded to his companions: the years of freedom had come.    They had always known among them that these years would come. Man had  not been there always, but there had always been swedes. He would go  some day, suddenly, as he came. That was the faith of the swedes. And  when the trees went the swede believed that the day was come. When  hundreds of little weeds arrived that were never allowed before, and  grew unchecked, he knew it.    After that he grew without any care, in sunlight, moonlight and rain;  grew abundantly and luxuriantly in the freedom, and increased in  arrogance till he felt himself greater than man. And indeed in those  leaden storms that sang often over his foliage all living things  seemed equal.    There was little that the Germans left when they retreated from the  Somme that was higher than this swede. He grew the tallest thing for  miles and miles. He dominated the waste. Two cats slunk by him from a  shattered farm: he towered above them contemptuously.    A partridge ran by him once, far, far below his lofty leaves. The  night winds mourning in No Man's Land seemed to sing for him alone.    It was surely the hour of the swede. For him, it seemed, was No Man's  Land. And there I met him one night by the light of a German rocket  and brought him back to our company to cook.          Weeds and Wire      Things had been happening. Divisions were moving. There had been,  there was going to be, a stunt. A battalion marched over the hill and  sat down by the road. They had left the trenches three days march to  the north and had come to a new country. The officers pulled their  maps out; a mild breeze fluttered them; yesterday had been winter and  to-day was spring; but spring in a desolation so complete and  far-reaching that you only knew of it by that little wind. It was  early March by the calendar, but the wind was blowing out of the gates  of April. A platoon commander, feeling that mild wind blowing, forgot  his map and began to whistle a tune that suddenly came to him out of  the past with the wind. Out of the past it blew and out of the South,  a merry vernal tune of a Southern people. Perhaps only one of those  that noticed the tune had ever heard it before. An officer sitting  near had heard it sung; it reminded him of a holiday long ago in the  South.    \"Where did you hear that tune?\" he asked the platoon commander.    \"Oh, the hell of a long way from here,\" the platoon commander said.    He did not remember quite where it was he had heard it, but he  remembered a sunny day in France and a hill all dark with pine woods,  and a man coming down at evening out of the woods, and down the slope  to the village, singing this song. Between the village and the slope  there were orchards in blossom. So that he came with his song for  hundreds of yards through orchards. \"The hell of a way from here,\"  he said.    For a long while then they sat silent.    \"It mightn't have been so very far from here,\" said the platoon  commander. \"It was in France, now I come to think of it. But it was a  lovely part of France, all woods and orchards. Nothing like this,  thank God.\" And he glanced with a tired look at the unutterable  desolation.    \"Where was it?\" said the other.    \"In Picardy,\" he said.    \"Aren't we in Picardy now?\" said his friend.    \"Are we?\" he said.    \"I don't know. The maps don't call it Picardy.\"    \"It was a fine place, anyway,\" the platoon commander said. \"There  seemed always to be a wonderful light on the hills. A kind of short  grass grew on them, and it shone in the sun at evening. There were  black woods above them. A man used to come out of them singing at  evening.\"    He looked wearily round at the brown desolation of weeds. As far as  the two officers could see there was nothing but brown weeds and bits  of brown barbed wire. He turned from the desolate scene back to his  reminiscences.    \"He came singing through the orchards into the village,\" he said.  \"A quaint old place with queer gables, called Ville-en-Bois.\"    \"Do you know where we are?\" said the other.    \"No, said the platoon commander.\"    \"I thought not,\" he said. \"Hadn't you better take a look at the  map?\"    \"I suppose so,\" said the platoon commander, and he smoothed out his  map and wearily got to the business of finding out where he was.    \"Good Lord!\" he said. \"Ville-en-Bois!\"          Spring in England and Flanders      Very soon the earliest primroses will be coming out in woods wherever  they have been sheltered from the north. They will grow bolder as the  days go by, and spread and come all down the slopes of sunny hills.  Then the anemones will come, like a shy pale people, one of the tribes  of the elves, who dare not leave the innermost deeps of the wood: in  those days all the trees will be in leaf, the bluebells will follow,  and certain fortunate woods will shelter such myriads of them that the  bright fresh green of the beech trees will flash between two blues,  the blue of the sky and the deeper blue of the bluebells. Later the  violets come, and such a time as this is the perfect time to see  England: when the cuckoo is heard and he surprises his hearers; when  evenings are lengthening out and the bat is abroad again; and all the  flowers are out and all the birds sing. At such a time not only Nature  smiles but our quiet villages and grave old spires wake up from winter  in the mellow air and wear their centuries lightly. At such a time you  might come just at evening on one of those old villages in a valley  and find it in the mood to tell you the secret of the ages that it hid  and treasured there before the Normans came. Who knows? For they are  very old, very wise, very friendly; they might speak to you one warm  evening. If you went to them after great suffering they might speak to  you; after nights and nights of shelling over in France, they might  speak to you and you might hear them clearly.    It would be a long, long story that they would tell, all about the  ages; and it would vary wonderfully little, much less perhaps than we  think; and the repetitions rambling on and on in the evening, as the  old belfry spoke and the cottages gathered below it, might sound so  soothing after the boom of shells that perhaps you would nearly sleep.  And then with one's memory tired out by the war one might never  remember the long story they told, when the belfry and the  brown-roofed houses all murmured at evening, might never remember even  that they had spoken all through that warm spring and evening. We may  have heard them speak and forgotten that they have spoken. Who knows?  We are at war, and see so many strange things: some we must forget,  some we must remember; and we cannot choose which.    To turn from Kent to Flanders is to turn to a time of mourning through  all seasons alike.

Yes, it is  mouse and bacon!\"    \"I think it wants another five minutes,\"  said Ribby. \"Just a shade longer; I will  pour out the tea, while we wait.  Do you take sugar, my dear Duchess?\"    \"Oh yes, please! my dear Ribby; and  may I have a lump upon my nose?\"    \"With pleasure, my dear Duchess.\"    Duchess sat up with the sugar on  her nose and sniffed--    \"How good that pie smells! I do  love veal and ham--I mean to say  mouse and bacon--\"    She dropped the sugar in confusion,  and had to go hunting under the tea-  table, so did not see which oven Ribby  opened in order to get out the pie.      Ribby set the pie upon the table;  there was a very savoury smell.    Duchess came out from under the  table-cloth munching sugar, and sat  up on a chair.    \"I will first cut the pie for you; I am  going to have muffin and  marmalade,\" said Ribby.    \"I think\"--(thought Duchess to  herself)--\"I THINK it would be wiser if  I helped myself to pie; though Ribby  did not seem to notice anything when  she was cutting it. What very small  fine pieces it has cooked into! I did not  remember that I had minced it up so  fine; I suppose this is a quicker oven  than my own.\"    The pie-dish was emptying rapidly!  Duchess had had four helps already,  and was fumbling with the spoon.    \"A little more bacon, my dear  Duchess?\" said Ribby.    \"Thank you, my dear Ribby; I was  only feeling for the patty-pan.\"    \"The patty-pan? my dear Duchess?\"    \"The patty pan that held up the  pie-crust,\" said Duchess, blushing  under her black coat.      \"Oh, I didn't put one in, my dear  Duchess,\" said Ribby; \"I don't think  that it is necessary in pies made of  mouse.\"    Duchess fumbled with the spoon--  \"I can't find it!\" she said anxiously.    \"There isn't a patty-pan,\" said  Ribby, looking perplexed.    \"Yes, indeed, my dear Ribby; where  can it have gone to?\" said Duchess.    Duchess looked very much  alarmed, and continued to scoop the  inside of the pie-dish.    \"I have only four patty-pans, and  they are all in the cupboard.\"    Duchess set up a howl.    \"I shall die! I shall die! I have  swallowed a patty-pan! Oh, my dear  Ribby, I do feel so ill!\"    \"It is impossible, my dear Duchess;  there was not a patty-pan.\"    \"Yes there WAS, my dear Ribby, I am  sure I have swallowed it!\"    \"Let me prop you up with a pillow,  my dear Duchess; where do you think  you feel it?\"    \"Oh I do feel so ill ALL OVER me, my  dear Ribby.\"    \"Shall I run for the doctor?\"      \"Oh yes, yes! fetch Dr. Maggotty,  my dear Ribby: he is a Pie himself, he  will certainly understand.\"    Ribby settled Duchess in an  armchair before the fire, and went  out and hurried to the village to look  for the doctor.    She found him at the smithy.    Ribby explained that her guest had  swallowed a patty-pan.    Dr. Maggotty hopped so fast that  Ribby had to run. It was most  conspicuous. All the village could see  that Ribby was fetching the doctor.    But while Ribby had been hunting  for the doctor--a curious thing had  happened to Duchess, who had been  left by herself, sitting before the fire,  sighing and groaning and feeling very  unhappy.    \"How COULD I have swallowed it!  such a large thing as a patty-pan!\"    She sat down again, and stared  mournfully at the grate. The fire  crackled and danced, and something  sizz-z-zled!    Duchess started! She opened the  door of the TOP oven;--out came a  rich steamy flavour of veal and ham,  and there stood a fine brown pie,--  and through a hole in the top of the  pie-crust there was a glimpse of a  little tin patty-pan!    Duchess drew a long breath--      \"Then I must have been eating  MOUSE! . . . No wonder I feel ill. . . .  But perhaps I should feel worse if I  had really swallowed a patty-pan!\"  Duchess reflected--\"What a very  awkward thing to have to explain to  Ribby! I think I will put MY pie in the  back-yard and say nothing about it.  When I go home, I will run round and  take it away.\" She put it outside the  back-door, and sat down again by  the fire, and shut her eyes; when  Ribby arrived with the doctor, she  seemed fast asleep.    \"I am feeling very much better,\"  said Duchess, waking up with a jump.    \"I am truly glad to hear it! He has  brought you a pill, my dear Duchess!\"    \"I think I should feel QUITE well if he  only felt my pulse,\" said Duchess,  backing away from the magpie, who  sidled up with something in his beak.    \"It is only a bread pill, you had  much better take it; drink a little milk,  my dear Duchess!\"    \"I am feeling very much better, my  dear Ribby,\" said Duchess. \"Do you  not think that I had better go home  before it gets dark?\"      \"Perhaps it might be wise, my dear  Duchess.\"    Ribby and Duchess said good-bye  affectionately, and Duchess started  home. Half-way up the lane she  stopped and looked back; Ribby had  gone in and shut her door. Duchess  slipped through the fence, and ran  round to the back of Ribby's house,  and peeped into the yard.    Upon the roof of the pig-stye sat Dr.  Maggotty and three jackdaws. The  jackdaws were eating piecrust, and  the magpie was drinking gravy out of  a patty-pan.    Duchess ran home feeling  uncommonly silly!    When Ribby came out for a pailful  of water to wash up the tea-things,  she found a pink and white pie-dish  lying smashed in the middle of the  yard.    Ribby stared with amazement--  \"Did you ever see the like! so there  really WAS a patty-pan? . . . But MY  patty-pans are all in the kitchen  cupboard. Well I never did! . . . Next  time I want to give a party--I will  invite Cousin Tabitha Twitchit!\"          THE TALE OF  MR. JEREMY FISHER    [For Stephanie  from Cousin B.]      Once upon a time there was a frog  called Mr. Jeremy Fisher; he lived in a  little damp house amongst the  buttercups at the edge of a pond.    The water was all slippy-sloppy in  the larder and in the back passage.    But Mr. Jeremy liked getting his feet  wet; nobody ever scolded him, and he  never caught a cold!    He was quite pleased when he  looked out and saw large drops of  rain, splashing in the pond--      \"I will get some worms and go  fishing and catch a dish of minnows  for my dinner,\" said Mr. Jeremy  Fisher. \"If I catch more than five fish, I  will invite my friends Mr. Alderman  Ptolemy Tortoise and Sir Isaac  Newton. The Alderman, however,  eats salad.\"    Mr. Jeremy put on a mackintosh,  and a pair of shiny galoshes; he took  his rod and basket, and set off with  enormous hops to the place where he  kept his boat.    The boat was round and green, and  very like the other lily-leaves. It was  tied to a water-plant in the middle of  the pond.      Mr. Jeremy took a reed pole, and  pushed the boat out into open water.  \"I know a good place for minnows,\"  said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.    Mr. Jeremy stuck his pole into the  mud and fastened the boat to it.    Then he settled himself cross-  legged and arranged his fishing  tackle. He had the dearest little red  float. His rod was a tough stalk of  grass, his line was a fine long white  horse-hair, and he tied a little  wriggling worm at the end.    The rain trickled down his back,  and for nearly an hour he stared at  the float.    \"This is getting tiresome, I think I  should like some lunch,\" said Mr.  Jeremy Fisher.      He punted back again amongst the  water-plants, and took some lunch  out of his basket.    \"I will eat a butterfly sandwich,  and wait till the shower is over,\" said  Mr. Jeremy Fisher.    A great big water-beetle came up  underneath the lily leaf and tweaked  the toe of one of his galoshes.    Mr. Jeremy crossed his legs up  shorter, out of reach, and went on  eating his sandwich.    Once or twice something moved  about with a rustle and a splash  amongst the rushes at the side of the  pond.    \"I trust that is not a rat,\" said Mr.  Jeremy Fisher; \"I think I had better get  away from here.\"      Mr. Jeremy shoved the boat out  again a little way, and dropped in the  bait. There was a bite almost directly;  the float gave a tremendous bobbit!    \"A minnow! a minnow! I have him  by the nose!\" cried Mr. Jeremy Fisher,  jerking up his rod.    But what a horrible surprise!  Instead of a smooth fat minnow, Mr.  Jeremy landed little Jack Sharp, the  stickleback, covered with spines!    The stickleback floundered about  the boat, pricking and snapping until  he was quite out of breath. Then he  jumped back into the water.      And a shoal of other little fishes put  their heads out, and laughed at Mr.  Jeremy Fisher.    And while Mr. Jeremy sat  disconsolately on the edge of his  boat--sucking his sore fingers and  peering down into the water--a MUCH  worse thing happened; a really  FRIGHTFUL thing it would have been, if  Mr. Jeremy had not been wearing a  mackintosh!    A great big enormous trout came  up--ker-pflop-p-p-p! with a splash--  and it seized Mr. Jeremy with a snap,  \"Ow! Ow! Ow!\"--and then it turned  and dived down to the bottom of the  pond!      But the trout was so displeased  with the taste of the mackintosh, that  in less than half a minute it spat him  out again; and the only thing it  swallowed was Mr. Jeremy's galoshes.    Mr. Jeremy bounced up to the  surface of the water, like a cork and  the bubbles out of a soda water  bottle; and he swam with all his  might to the edge of the pond.    He scrambled out on the first bank  he came to, and he hopped home  across the meadow with his  mackintosh all in tatters.      \"What a mercy that was not a  pike!\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. \"I have  lost my rod and basket; but it does  not much matter, for I am sure I  should never have "]]]
