[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39396"],[0,"A Population Study of the Prairie Vole (Microtus ochrogaster) in Northeastern (#6)"],[1,"were  discussed earlier in connection with the analysis of habitats.          HOME RANGE      Home ranges were calculated for individual voles according to the method  described by Blair (1940:149-150). The term, home range, is used as  defined by Burt (1943:350-351). Only those voles captured at least four  times were used for the home range studies. Individuals which included  the edge of the trap grid in their range were excluded unless a barrier  existed (see description of habitat) confining the seeming range to the  study area.    The validity of home range calculations has been challenged (Hayne,  1950:39) and special methods of determining home range have been  advocated by a number of authors. The ranges calculated in this study  are assumed to approximate the actual areas used by individuals and are  considered useful for comparison with other ranges calculated by similar  methods, but no claim to exactness is intended. It is obvious, for  instance, that many plotted ranges contain so-called blank areas which,  at times, are not actually used by any vole (Elton, 1949:8; Mohr,  1943:553). Studies of the movements of mammals on a more detailed scale,  perhaps by live-traps set at shorter intervals and moved frequently, are  needed to increase our understanding of home range.    In order to test the reliability of the range calculated, an examination  of the relationship between the size of the seeming range and the number  of captures was made. For the first three months, trapping on House  Field was done with a 20 foot grid and throughout the remainder of the  study a 30 foot grid was used. The effect of these different spacings on  the size of the seeming home range was also investigated. Hayne  (1950:38) found that an increase in the distance between traps caused an  increase in the size of the seeming home range, but in my study the  increased interval between traps was not accompanied by any change in  the sizes of the calculated ranges.    The number of captures, above the minimum of four, did not seem to be a  factor in determining the size of the calculated monthly range. A  seeming relationship was observed between the number of times an  individual was trapped and the total area used during the entire time  the vole was trapped. Closer examination revealed that the most  important factor was the length of time over which the vole's captures  extended. Table 2 shows the progressive increase in sizes of the mean  range of animals taken over periods of time from one month to ten  months.      TABLE 2.

Several workers, including Blair (1940) and Hamilton  (1937c), have studied the home range of _M. pennsylvanicus_. Blair  (1940:153) reported a larger range for males than for females in all  habitats and in all seasons represented in his sample. In _M.  ochrogaster_, however, I found that the mean monthly range for both  sexes was 0.09 of an acre. Blair (_loc. cit._) reported no individuals  with a range so small as that mean, but Hamilton (_op. cit._:261)  mentioned two voles with ranges of less than 1200 square feet. The mean  total range used by an individual during the entire time it was being  trapped showed a slight difference between the sexes. Males used an  average of 0.14 of an acre whereas females used an average of but 0.12  of an acre. This suggested that, as in _M. pennsylvanicus_ (Hamilton,  _loc. cit._), males tended to wander more than females and to shift  their home range more often.    The largest monthly range recorded was 0.28 of an acre used by a female  in March, 1951, and calculated on the basis of four captures. The  largest monthly range of a male was 0.25 of an acre for a vole caught  eight times in November, 1950. The smallest monthly range was 0.02 of an  acre; several individuals of both sexes were restricted to areas of this  size. Juveniles, not included in the home range study, were usually  restricted to 0.01 or, at most, 0.02 of an acre. Seasonal differences in  the sizes of home ranges were not significant. However, the voles caught  in the winter often enough to be used for home range studies were too  few for a thorough study of seasonal variation in the size of home  ranges.    One female was captured 22 times in the seven-month period of October,  1950, to April, 1951. She used an area of 0.83 of an acre, but this  actually comprised two separate ranges. From October, 1950, through  December, 1950, she was taken 17 times within an area of 0.12 of an  acre; and from January, 1951, to April, 1951, she was taken five times  within an area of 0.15 of an acre. The largest area assumed to represent  one range of a female was 0.38 of an acre, recorded on the basis of six  captures in three months. The largest area encompassed by the record of  an individual male was 0.41 of an acre. He, too, shifted his range,  being taken five times on an area of 0.07 of an acre and twice, two  months later, on an area of 0.09 of an acre. Presumably, the remainder  of his calculated total range was used but little, or not at all. The  largest single range of a male was 0.36 of an acre, calculated on the  basis of 18 captures in seven months. The smallest total range for both  sexes was 0.02 of an acre.    Many voles shifted their home range and a few did so abruptly. The large  range of a female vole, described above and plotted in Fig. 6, indicated  an abrupt shift from one home range to another. More common is a gradual  shift as indicated by the range of the male shown in Fig. 7. Large parts  of each monthly range of this vole overlapped the area used in other  months but his center of activity shifted from month to month.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.

No territoriality has  been reported in any species of _Microtus_, to my knowledge, and my  voles showed no objection to sharing their range. Voles taken from the  field into the laboratory lived together in pairs or larger groups  without much friction.    Definable systems of runways and home ranges were not coextensive.  Runway systems tended to merge, as described later in this report, and  relationships between them and home range were not apparent. Home ranges  had no characteristic shape.          LIFE HISTORY      Reproduction    Reproductive activity might have been measured in a number of ways.  Three indicators were tested: the percentage of females gravid or  lactating, the percentage of juveniles in the month following the  sampling period, and the percentage of females with a vaginal orifice in  the sampling period. The condition of vagina proved to be most useful.  Whether or not there is a vaginal cycle in _Microtus_ is uncertain.  Bodenheimer and Sulman (1946:255-256) found no evidence of such a cycle,  nor did I in my work with laboratory animals at Lawrence. How much the  artificial environment of the laboratory affected these findings is  unknown. The presence of an orifice seemed to indicate sexual activity  (Hamilton, 1941:9). The percentage of gravid females in the population  could not be determined accurately by a live-trapping study and was not  useful in this investigation. The percentage of juveniles trapped in the  month following the sampling period tended to follow the curve of the  percentage of adult females with a vaginal orifice. The ratio of trapped  juveniles to adults trapped was a poor indicator of reproductive  activity. Juveniles were caught in relatively small numbers because of  their restricted movements, and no way to determine prenatal and juvenal  mortality was available.    Reproductive activity continues throughout the year. Within the  thirty-month period for which data were obtained, December and January  showed the lowest percentages of females with vaginal orifices (Fig. 8).  The other months all showed higher levels of reproductive activity with  a slight peak in the August-September-October period in both 1950 and  1951. In the species of _Microtus_ that are found in the United States,  such summer peaks of breeding seem to be the rule (Blair, 1940:151;  Gunderson, 1950:17; Hamilton, 1937b:785). Jameson (1947:147) worked in  the same county where my field study was made and found that the high  point of reproduction was in March, although his samples were too small  to be reliable. The peak of reproductive activity slightly preceded the  highest level of population density in each year (Fig. 8).    [Illustration: FIG. 8.

Abnormally low rainfall  in 1952 caused a decrease in breeding activity and eventually in the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39421"],[0,"Mount Everest, the Reconnaissance, 1921 (#6)"],[1,"by pen, beauty  no less valuable than the knowledge.                                THE NARRATIVE OF THE EXPEDITION                                        By                       LIEUT.-COL. C. K. HOWARD-BURY, D.S.O.                                           CHAPTER I                          FROM DARJEELING THROUGH SIKKIM      Early in May most of the members of the Expedition had assembled at  Darjeeling. Mr. Raeburn had been the first to arrive there in order to  collect as many coolies of the right type as he could. I had come out a  few weeks earlier in order to visit the Indian Authorities at Simla and  to make sure that there were no political difficulties in the way. There  I found every one very kind and helpful and all were anxious to do their  best to assist the Expedition. Owing to the heavy deficit in the Indian  Budget, the expenses of every Department had been rigorously cut down,  and the Government of India were unable to give us financial assistance.  They agreed, however, to take upon themselves the whole of the expenses  of the survey, and to lend the Expedition the services of an officer of  the Geological Department. The Viceroy, Lord Reading, who, together with  Lady Reading, took the greatest interest in the Expedition, kindly gave  us a subscription of 750 rupees, and at Darjeeling the Governor of  Bengal, Lord Ronaldshay, had not only put up several members of the  Expedition at his most comfortable house, but had also given the  Expedition several rooms in which to collect their stores for separation  and division into loads. Local stores, such as tea, sugar, flour and  potatoes had to be bought on the spot. Coolies had to be collected and  arrangements made for fitting them out with boots and warm clothing. The  coolies were to receive pay at the rate of 12 annas per day while in  Sikkim, and when in Tibet were to receive another 6 annas per day,  either in cash or the equivalent in rations. The former proved the most  acceptable eventually, except during the period when the coolies were  up on the glaciers, where there were no villages and consequently  nothing could be bought.    A passport had been sent to us by the Government at Lhasa under the seal  of the Prime Minister of Tibet, of which the following is a  translation:--      _To_      _The Jongpens and Headmen of Pharijong, Ting-ke, Khamba and Kharta._      You are to bear in mind that a party of Sahibs are coming to see the    Chha-mo-lung-ma mountain and they will evince great friendship towards    the Tibetans. On the request of the Great Minister Bell a passport    has been issued requiring you and all officials and subjects of the    Tibetan Government to supply transport, e.g. riding ponies, pack    animals and coolies as required by the Sahibs, the rates for which    should be fixed to mutual satisfaction. Any other assistance that    the Sahibs may require either by day or by night, on the march or    during halts, should be faithfully given, and their requirements    about transport or anything else should be promptly attended to. All    the people of the country, wherever the Sahibs may happen to come,    should render all necessary assistance in the best possible way, in    order to maintain friendly relations between the British and Tibetan    Governments.      Dispatched during the Iron-Bird Year.    Seal of the Prime Minister.    Our start had been originally arranged for the middle of May, but the  \"Hatarana,\" in which were most of our stores, was unable to obtain a  berth, as accommodation in the Docks at Calcutta was very insufficient  for the large number of steamers that call there; she had therefore to  lie out in the Hoogly for a fortnight before she could get room in the  Docks. However, by May 11 everything was unloaded at Calcutta. The  Darjeeling-Himalayan Railway had generously given the Expedition a free  pass over their line for all stores and goods, and as the Customs had  granted a free entry into the country, everything was up in Darjeeling  by May 14. The time of waiting at Darjeeling had, however, not been  wasted. Four cooks had been engaged for the Expedition and some forty  coolies. These were Sherpa Bhotias, whose homes were in the North-east  corner of Nepal, some of them coming from villages only a few miles to  the South of Mount Everest. They were an especially hardy type of  coolie, accustomed to living in a cold climate and at great heights.  They were Buddhists by religion and therefore had no caste prejudices  about food, and could eat anything. They proved at times quarrelsome and  rather fond of strong drink; they turned out, however, to be a useful  and capable type of man, easily trained in snow and ice work and not  afraid of the snow. We later on picked up a few Tibetan coolies in the  Chumbi Valley and these proved to be as good as the best of the Sherpas.  They were very hardy and got on well with the Tibetans, who were always  rather suspicious of our Nepalese coolies. They were also less  troublesome to manage and could carry heavy loads at great heights.  These coolies had all to be fitted with boots and very difficult this  sometimes proved to be, as often their feet were almost as broad as they  were long. Blankets, cap comforters, fur gloves and warm clothing were  issued to all of them, and for those who had to sleep at the highest  camps, eiderdown sleeping-bags were also taken. Arrangements had also to  be made for interpreters to accompany the Expedition, as with the  exception of Major Morshead, who knew a little Tibetan, no one was able  to speak the language. It was a matter of great importance to get hold  of the right type of man as interpreter. It was essential to find men of  some position and standing who knew not only the Tibetan language, but  also all their ways and customs. After many names had been suggested, we  were very lucky in getting hold of two men who possessed these  qualifications to a great extent. Gyalzen Kazi, who came from Gangtok in  Sikkim, where he was a Kazi and landowner, was a young and ambitious man  who knew the Tibetan language well and was well read in their sacred  writings and scriptures. The other one, Chheten Wangdi, was a Tibetan  who had been for a time a captain in the Tibetan army, and who had left  them and been attached to the Indian army in Egypt during the war. He  was a most energetic, hard-working man, knew all the Tibetan manners and  customs, and was up to all their tricks of procrastination and attempts  at overcharging. By his knowledge and persuasive powers the Expedition  was saved many thousand rupees.    The Expedition when it left Darjeeling included nine Europeans. The  Alpine climbers were Mr. Harold Raeburn, Dr. A. M. Kellas, Mr. G. L.  Mallory and Mr. C. H. Bullock. Dr. Kellas had unfortunately in the early  spring of this year tried his constitution very severely by climbing  Narsing,[2] and he had also spent several nights at very low  temperatures in camps over 20,000 feet, on the slopes of Kabru,[2] so  that when he arrived at Darjeeling a few days before the Expedition was  due to start, he was not in as fit a condition as he should have been.  The two Surveyors were Major H. T. Morshead, D.S.O., and Major O. E.  Wheeler, M.C. These officers had been lent by the Survey of India. Major  Morshead had already a considerable experience of travelling in the  Eastern borders of Tibet and in the Kham country, where he had carried  out some useful survey work, and under him were three native surveyors,  one of whom was left in Sikkim to revise the existing maps, which were  very inaccurate, while the other two, Gujjar Singh and Lalbir Singh,  accompanied the Expedition and filled in all the details of the country  traversed on their plane tables at a scale of 4 miles to the inch. Major  O. E. Wheeler, the other Surveyor, was a member of the Canadian Alpine  Club and a very keen climber himself. He was an expert in the Canadian  system of Photo Survey--a method especially useful and applicable to a  difficult and mountainous country. The Indian Government had also lent  the Expedition the services of Dr. A. M. Heron, of the Geological Survey  of India, in order to study the geology of the country through which it  was about to go, and about which nothing was known, and to investigate  the problems which surround the age and the structure of the Himalayan  range. Besides these, there was Mr. A. F. Wollaston, a member of the  Alpine Club and a very distinguished traveller as well, who had made  some most interesting journeys around Ruwenzori in Africa and in the  interior of New Guinea. He accompanied the Expedition in the capacity of  Doctor, Naturalist and Botanist, and was equipped with a complete  collector's outfit.      [2] Narsing and Kabru are two high mountains in the North of Sikkim.    During our time of enforced waiting at Darjeeling, we came in for the  Lebong races--a unique and very amusing entertainment. The course is a  small circular one, where the top of the Lebong spur has been levelled,  and only genuine Tibetan and Bhotia ponies are allowed to race there.  There were always large entries for these races, as they were very  popular among the hill-folk, who flocked into Darjeeling from great  distances, dressed in their finest clothes and with their women covered  with jewellery and wearing clothing of brilliant shades of green and  red. There was very heavy betting on each race, and the amount of money  that the coolies, sirdars or servants were able to put up was  astonishing. In most of the races there was at least a field of ten,  which made the start a very amusing affair. The jockeys were all  hill-boys, and as they and the ponies were up to every dodge and trick,  and were equally anxious to get off first, and as most of the ponies had  mouths of iron, it was always a long time before a start could be made,  and in nearly every race one or more of the ponies would run out"]]]
