I'm  going to take it apart now, and see what it needs.\"    \"Before you do that, Tom, I wish you would take a telegram to town  for me. I must wire my lawyers at once.\"    \"Dad looks worried,\" thought Tom as he wheeled the broken motor-cycle  into a machine shop, where he did most of his work. \"Well, I don't  blame him. But we'll get the best of those scoundrels yet!\"          CHAPTER VI.    AN INTERVIEW IN THE DARK      While Mr. Swift was writing the message he wished his son to take to  the village, the young mechanic inspected the motor-cycle he had  purchased. Tom found that a few repairs would suffice to put it in  good shape, though an entire new front wheel would be needed. The  motor had not been damaged, as he ascertained by a test. Tom rode  into town on his bicycle, and as he hurried along he noticed in the  west a bank of ugly-looking clouds that indicated a shower.    \"I'm in for a wetting before I get back,\" he mused, and he increased  his speed, reaching the telegraph office shortly before seven  o'clock.    \"Think this storm will hold off until I get home?\" asked Tom.    \"I'm afraid not,\" answered the agent. \"You'd better get a hustle  on.\"    Tom sprinted off. It was getting dark rapidly, and when he was about  a mile from home he felt several warm drops on his face.    \"Here it comes!\" exclaimed the youth. \"Now for a little more speed!\"    Tom pressed harder on the pedals, too hard, in fact, for an instant  later something snapped, and the next he knew he was flying over the  handle-bars of the bicycle. At the same time there was a metallic,  clinking sound.    \"Chain's busted!\" exclaimed the lad as he picked himself up out of  the dust. \"Well, wouldn't that jar you!\" and he walked back to  where, in the dusk, he could dimly discern his wheel.    The chain had come off the two sprockets and was lying to one side.  Tom picked it up and ascertained by close observation that the screw  and nut holding the two joining links together was lost.    \"Nice pickle!\" he murmured. \"How am I going to find it in all this  dust and darkness?\" he asked himself disgustedly. \"I'll carry an  extra screw next time. No, I won't, either. I'll ride my motor-cycle  next time. Well, I may as well give a look around. I hate to walk,  if I can fix it and ride.\"    Tom had not spent more than two minutes looking about the dusty  road, with the aid of matches, for the screw, when the rain suddenly  began falling in a hard shower.    \"Guess there's no use lingering here any longer,\" he remarked. \"I'll  push the wheel and run for home.\"    He started down the road in the storm and darkness. The highway soon  became a long puddle of mud, through which he splashed, finding it  more and more difficult every minute to push the bicycle in the  thick, sticky clay.    Above the roar of the wind and the swishing of the rain he heard  another sound. It was a steady \"puff-puff,\" and then the darkness  was cut by a glare of light.    \"An automobile,\" said Tom aloud. \"Guess I'd better get out of the  way.\"    He turned to one side, but the auto, instead of passing him when it  got to the place where he was, made a sudden stop.    \"Want a ride?\" asked the chauffeur, peering out from the side  curtains which somewhat protected him from the storm. Tom saw that  the car was a large, touring one. \"Can I give you a lift?\" went on  the driver.    \"Well, I've got my bicycle with me,\" explained the young inventor.  \"My chain's broken, and I've got a mile to go.\"    \"Jump up in back,\" invited the man. \"Leave your wheel here; I guess  it will be safe.\"    \"Oh, I couldn't do that,\" said Tom. \"I don't mind walking. I'm wet  through now, and I can't get much wetter. I'm much obliged, though.\"    \"Well, I'm sorry, but I can hardly take you and the bicycle, too,\"  continued the chauffeur.    \"Certainly not,\" added a voice from the tonneau of the car. \"We  can't have a muddy bicycle in here. Who is that person, Simpson?\"    \"It's a young man,\" answered the driver.    \"Is he acquainted around here?\" went on the voice from the rear of  the car. \"Ask him if he is acquainted around here, Simpson.\"    Tom was wondering where he had heard that voice before. He had a  vague notion that it was familiar.    \"Are you acquainted around here?\" obediently asked the man at the  wheel.    \"I live here,\" replied Tom.    \"Ask him if he knows any one named Swift?\" continued the voice from  the tonneau, and the driver started to repeat it.    \"I heard him,\" interrupted Tom. \"Yes, I know a Mr. Swift;\" but Tom,  with a sudden resolve, and one he could hardly explain, decided  that, for the present, he would not betray his own identity.    \"Ask him if Mr. Swift is an inventor.\" Once more the unseen person  spoke in the voice Tom was trying vainly to recall.    \"Yes, he is an inventor,\" was the youth's answer.    \"Do you know much about him? What are his habits? Does he live near  his workshops? Does he keep many servants? Does he--\"    The unseen questioner suddenly parted the side curtains and peered  out at Tom, who stood in the muddy road, close to the automobile. At  that moment there came a bright flash of lightning, illuminating not  only Tom's face, but that of his questioner as well. And at the  sight Tom started, no less than did the man. For Tom had recognized  him as one of the three mysterious persons in the restaurant, and as  for the man, he had also recognized Tom.    \"Ah--er--um--is--Why, it's you, isn't it?\" cried the questioner, and  he thrust his head farther out from between the curtains. \"My, what a  storm!\" he exclaimed as the rain increased. \"So you know Mr. Swift,  eh? I saw you to-day in Mansburg, I think. I have a good memory for  faces. Do you work for Mr. Swift? If you do I may be able to--\"    \"I'm Tom Swift, son of Mr. Barton Swift,\" said Tom as quietly as he  could.    \"Tom Swift! His son!\" cried the man, and he seemed much agitated.  \"Why, I thought--that is, Morse said--Simpson, hurry back to  Mansburg!\" and with that, taking no more notice of Tom, the man in  the auto hastily drew the curtains together.    The chauffeur threw in the gears and swung the ponderous machine to  one side. The road was wide, and he made the turn skilfully. A  moment later the car was speeding back the way it had come, leaving  Tom standing on the highway, alone in the mud and darkness, with the  rain pouring down in torrents.          CHAPTER VII.    OFF ON A SPIN      Tom's first impulse was to run after the automobile, the red tail-light  of which glowed through the blackness like a ruby eye. Then he  realized that it was going from him at such a swift pace that it  would be impossible to get near it, even if his bicycle was in  working order.    \"But if I had my motor-cycle I'd catch up to them,\" he murmured. \"As  it is, I must hurry home and tell dad. This is another link in the  queer chain that seems to be winding around us. I wonder who that  man was, and what he wanted by asking so many personal questions  about dad?\"    Trundling his wheel before him, with the chain dangling from the  handle-bar, Tom splashed on through the mud and rain. It was a  lonesome, weary walk, tired as he was with the happenings of the  day, and the young inventor breathed a sigh of thankfulness as the  lights of his home shone out in the mist of the storm. As he tramped  up the steps of the side porch, his wheel bumping along ahead of  him, a door was thrown open.    \"Why, it's Tom!\" exclaimed Mrs. Baggert. \"Whatever happened to you?\"  and she hurried forward with kindly solicitude, for the housekeeper  was almost a second mother to the youth.    \"Chain broke,\" answered the lad laconically. \"Where's dad?\"    \"Out in the shop, working at his latest invention, I expect. But are  you hurt?\"    \"Oh, no. I fell easily. The mud was like a feather-bed, you know,  except that it isn't so good for the clothes,\" and the young  inventor looked down at his splashed and bedraggled garments.    Mr. Swift was very much surprised when Tom told him of the happening  on the road, and related the conversation and the subsequent alarm  of the man on learning Tom's identity.    \"Who do you suppose he could have been?\" asked Tom, when he had  finished.    \"I am pretty certain he was one of that crowd of financiers of whom  Anson Morse seems to be a representative,\" said Mr. Swift. \"Are you  sure the man was one of those you saw in the restaurant?\"    \"Positive. I had a good look at him both times. Do you think he  imagined he could come here and get possession of some of your  secrets?\"    \"I hardly know what to think, Tom. But we will take every  precaution. We will set the burglar alarm wires, which I have  neglected for some time, as I fancied everything would be secure  here. Then I will take my plans and the model of the turbine motor  into the house. I'll run no chances to-night.\"    Mr. Swift, who was adjusting some of the new bolts that Tom had  brought home that day; began to gather up his tools and material.    \"I'll help you, dad,\" said Tom, and he began connecting the burglar  alarm wires, there being an elaborate system of them about the  house, shops and grounds.    Neither Tom nor his father slept well that night. Several times one  or the other of them arose, thinking they heard unusual noises, but  it was only some disturbance caused by the storm, and morning  arrived without anything unusual having taken place. The rain still  continued, and Tom, looking from his window and seeing the downpour,  remarked:    \"I'm glad of it!\"    \"Why?\" asked his father, who was in the next room.    \"Because I'll have a good excuse for staying in and working on my  motor-cycle.\"    \"But you must do some studying,\" declared Mr. Swift. \"I will hear  you in mathematics right after breakfast.\"    \"All right, dad. I guess you'll find I have my lessons.\"    Tom had graduated with honors from a local academy, and when it came  to a question of going further in his studies, he had elected to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42324"],[0,"Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus (#6)"],[1," pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of  the affection that united them. He lost no time in endeavouring to seek  him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again  through his credit and assistance.    Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself; and it was ten  months before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this  discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean  street, near the Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone  welcomed him. Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the  wreck of his fortunes; but it was sufficient to provide him with  sustenance for some months, and in the mean time he hoped to procure  some respectable employment in a merchant's house. The interval was,  consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and  rankling, when he had leisure for reflection; and at length it took so  fast hold of his mind, that at the end of three months he lay on a bed  of sickness, incapable of any exertion.    His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness; but she saw with  despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing, and that there  was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind  of an uncommon mould; and her courage rose to support her in her  adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw; and by various  means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.    Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time  was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence  decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving  her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her; and she knelt  by Beaufort's coffin, weeping bitterly, when my father entered the  chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who  committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend, he  conducted her to Geneva, and placed her under the protection of a  relation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.    There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but  this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted  affection. There was a sense of justice in my father's upright mind,  which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love  strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the  late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved, and so was disposed to set  a greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and  worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the  doating fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her  virtues, and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing  her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace  to his behaviour to her. Every thing was made to yield to her wishes and  her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered  by the gardener, from every rougher wind, and to surround her with all  that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent  mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant  spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During the two  years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had  gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after  their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change of  scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as  a restorative for her weakened frame.    From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was  born at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I  remained for several years their only child. Much as they were attached  to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection  from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother's tender  caresses, and my father's smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding  me, are my first recollections. I was their plaything and their idol,  and something better--their child, the innocent and helpless creature  bestowed on them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future  lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as  they fulfilled their duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of  what they owed towards the being to which they had given life, added to  the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined  that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of  patience, of charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken  cord, that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me.    For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to  have a daughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was  about five years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of  Italy, they passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their  benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor.  This, to my mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a  passion,--remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been  relieved,--for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the  afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a  vale attracted their notice, as being singularly disconsolate, while the  number of half-clothed children gathered about it, spoke of penury in  its worst shape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan,  my mother, accompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant  and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a  scanty meal to five hungry babes. Among these there was one which  attracted my mother far above all the rest. She appeared of a different  stock. The four others were dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child  was thin, and very fair. Her hair was the brightest living gold, and,  despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed to set a crown of  distinction on her head. Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes  cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of  sensibility and sweetness, that none could behold her without looking on  her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent, and bearing a  celestial stamp in all her features.    The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and  admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She  was not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother  was a German, and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been  placed with these good people to nurse: they were better off then. They  had not been long married, and their eldest child was but just born. The  father of their charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of  the antique glory of Italy,--one among the _schiavi ognor frementi_, who  exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the  victim of its weakness. Whether he had died, or still lingered in the  dungeons of Austria, was not known. His property was confiscated, his  child became an orphan and a beggar. She continued with her foster  parents, and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer than a garden rose  among dark-leaved brambles.    When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall  of our villa, a child fairer than pictured cherub--a creature who seemed  to shed radiance from her looks, and whose form and motions were lighter  than the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With  his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield  their charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence  had seemed a blessing to them; but it would be unfair to her to keep her  in poverty and want, when Providence afforded her such powerful  protection. They consulted their village priest, and the result was,  that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my parents' house--my more  than sister--the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations  and my pleasures.    Every one loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential  attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my  pride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being brought to my  home, my mother had said playfully,--\"I have a pretty present for my  Victor--to-morrow he shall have it.\" And when, on the morrow, she  presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish  seriousness, interpreted her words literally, and looked upon Elizabeth  as mine--mine to protect, love, and cherish. All praises bestowed on  her, I received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other  familiarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression could body  forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me--my more than  sister, since till death she was to be mine only.          CHAPTER II.      We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in  our ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of  disunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the  diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer  together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition;  but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense application,  and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge. She busied  herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the  majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home--the  sublime shapes of the mountains; the changes of the seasons; tempest and  calm; the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of our Alpine  summers,--she found ample scope for admiration and delight. While my  companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the  magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in"]]]
