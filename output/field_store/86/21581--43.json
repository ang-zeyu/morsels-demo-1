[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38315"],[0,"Artistic Anatomy of Animals (#6)"],[1,"sternum is formed of two distinct bones, which are united  by an articulation. One, the anterior, is short, and forms the first  portion of the sternum; it is slightly flattened from side to side, and  vertical in direction. The other, the posterior, is longer, and is  formed by the fusion of several small bones; it is placed horizontally,  and is flattened from above downwards. At the level of articulation of  these two portions, and because of their different directions, the bone  is bent. This bend occurs at the point of articulation of the second  costal cartilage. On the superior border of the anterior segment the  cartilage of the first rib is articulated. The xiphoid appendix, which  is cartilaginous, is attached to the extremity of a long process of the  last bone of the sternum.    The shape of the anterior extremity of the sternum is influenced by the  presence or absence of clavicles. We have seen that in some quadrupeds  the clavicles are wanting. In the first case, this extremity is large,  and approaches in shape to the corresponding part of the human sternum,  which is so clearly designed to give a point of support to the anterior  bone of the shoulder. In the second, on the contrary, this extremity is  narrow.    The sternum in birds is very different from that in mammalia, which we  have been studying. It varies greatly in extent and shape, under the  influence of certain conditions. To understand the cause of these  variations it is necessary to remember that in man (as, indeed, in other  animals; but the example of man, for that which follows, will be more  striking, on account of the mobility of his upper limbs) the sternum  gives origin to the pectoral muscles, and that these muscles are  inserted into other parts of the thoracic limbs, designed by their  contraction to draw the arms downwards, forwards, and inwards--that is,  when these are in a state of abduction and in a horizontal direction,  they draw them towards the anterior surface of the thorax and downwards.  Now, this movement is similar to that made by birds during flight. It is  necessary to add that, in the latter case, the more the displacement of  the upper limbs has of force and extent, the more the pectoral muscles  are developed.    For these reasons, birds, in which, during flight, the movements of the  thoracic limbs--the wings--are necessarily energetic, present a great  development of the pectoral muscles; having consequently, because an  extent of surface for the origin of the muscles commensurate with their  development is necessary, a very large and peculiarly shaped sternum  (Figs. 18, 6; and 21, 6). Indeed, not only is the sternum large, but,  further, in order to form a deeper surface, proportionately adapted to  the muscles which arise from and cover it, its anterior surface  presents, in the median line, a prominent crest known as the _keel_.  This prominence forms two lateral fossae. We cite as examples, the  sternum of the eagle, the vulture, the falcon, and the hawk.    All birds are not, however, equally adapted to flight, for in the  domestic cock, which flies but a short distance, and badly, the sternum  is less developed (Fig. 7); it is also diminished by slots, which  diminish its surface. These slots, two on each side, are called from  their position the internal and external slots. They are bounded by  narrow, elongated, bony processes, an internal and an external; the  expanded lower extremity of the latter overlaps the last inferior ribs  (see p. 19). The part of the external border which surmounts this  external process is hollowed out into grooves, which receive the  inferior ribs, and terminates superiorly in an osseous projection known  as _the costal prominence_.    In the ostrich, the cassowary, and the apteryx, which run, but do not  fly, the sternum has the form of a plate of bone slightly convex, but  without a keel.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--STERNUM OF A BIRD (THE COCK): LEFT SIDE,  EXTERNAL SURFACE.    1, Keel; 2, internal slot; 3, external slot; 4, internal process; 5,  external process; 6, inferior ribs; 7, costal process; 8, surface for  articulation with the coracoid bone.]    The shape of the sternum, correlated to the faculty of flight (or of  swimming; apropos of which we may cite the penguin, of which the  rudimentary wings resemble fins, and perform their functions only), or  the absence of this faculty, has furnished the division of birds into  two groups. In one are included, under the name _Carinates_ (_carina_,  keel), those in which the sternum is provided with a keel; in the other  division are those in which the sternum is not furnished with one. These  latter, on account of their unique mode of progression, are more nearly  allied to the mammals.    The keel is developed in flying mammals (bats).    =Ribs and Costal Cartilages.=--There are on each side of the thorax as  many ribs as there are dorsal vertebrae. In animals, as in man, the ribs  which articulate with the sternum by their cartilages are called _true_,  or _sternal_ ribs; those whose cartilages do not articulate with the  sternum are called _false_, or _asternal_. The longer ribs are those  situated in the middle region of the thorax.    The ribs are directed obliquely downwards and backwards, and this  obliquity is more marked in the posterior ones than in the anterior.  They are, however, less oblique than in the human being; what proves  this is that the first rib in man is oblique, while in quadrupeds it is  vertical.    The curvature of the ribs is less pronounced in quadrupeds than in the  human being, but this is not equal in all animals. The ribs of the bear  are more curved than those of the dog; the latter has ribs more curved  than those of the horse.    Each rib, at its vertebral extremity, presents, from within outwards, a  wedge-shaped head for articulation with two dorsal vertebrae, a neck, and  a tuberosity. External to the tubercle are found some rough impressions,  for muscular attachments, which correspond to the angle of the human  rib.    In the following table, we give the number and classification of the  ribs of some animals:    NUMBER OF THE RIBS ON EACH SIDE OF THE THORAX.                                 Sternal.    Asternal.

Their length is proportionate to that of  the ribs. The cartilages, which are continued from the asternal ribs,  unite and form the borders, directed obliquely downwards and forwards,  of the fossa which is found at the inferior and posterior part of the  thorax, and which forms the lateral limits of the epigastric region. In  the dog and cat the ribs are thick and almost cylindrical; the costal  cartilages are thicker at the margin of the sternum than at their costal  extremity. In the ox, the ribs are flattened laterally and are very  broad, the more so as we examine a portion further from the vertebral  column. From the second to the twelfth they are quadrangular in the  superior fourth, and thicker than in the rest of their extent. The first  costal cartilage is vertical; the following ones are progressively more  oblique in a direction downwards and forwards. The four or five  cartilages which succeed the first unite with slight obliquity to the  sternum; their union with that bone gives the impression of a very  strong, well-knit apparatus. The costal cartilages which unite with the  sternum are flattened laterally in the portions next the ribs, and  flattened from front to back in the rest of their extent.    In the horse the ribs increase in length from the first to the ninth;  they are flattened from without inwards, and increase in width from the  first to the sixth or seventh, and the following ones become narrower.  The costal cartilages, from the second to the eighth, are, as in the ox,  at first flattened laterally, near the ribs; while near the sternum they  are flattened from front to back.    In birds, the ribs are each furnished with a flat process (Fig. 18, 10),  which springs from the posterior border, is directed backwards, and  overlaps the external surface of the succeeding rib. These processes are  not found, as a rule, on the first or last ribs.    As for the costal cartilages, they are, as a rule, ossified, and receive  the name of inferior ribs (Fig. 18, 11), united to the preceding  (superior ribs; Fig. 18, 9) by articulation; by the other extremity they  are joined to the sternum; the first superior ribs generally want them.  Sometimes the last inferior rib becomes connected with the one that  precedes it, not articulating with the sternum; and thus recalls the  relations of the asternal ribs which we have noticed in our study of the  mammals.    In the bat, as in birds, the costal cartilages are ossified.      THE ANTERIOR LIMBS[5]      [5] Consult Figs. 21, 33, 34, 38, 39, 46.    The anterior limbs, homologous to the upper limbs in man, are formed, as  in the latter, of four segments: the shoulder, the arm, the forearm, and  the hand. These limbs, considered in the vertebral series, present  themselves under very different aspects, which are determined by the  functions they are called upon to perform.

Lying near them, he was to watch them all the  time, and when they were laughing and unthinking of anything but the  spectacle before them, he was to steal the comebee. Having arranged  their plan of action, they all prepared for a big corrobboree. They  sent word to all the surrounding tribes, asking them to attend,  especially they begged the Bralgahs to come, as they were celebrated  for their wonderful dancing, which was so wonderful as to be most  likely to absorb the attention of the firemakers.    All the tribes agreed to come, and soon all were engaged in great  preparations. Each determined to outdo the other in the quaintness and  brightness of their painting for the corrobboree. Each tribe as they  arrived gained great applause; never before had the young people seen  so much diversity in colouring and design. Beeleer, the Black Cockatoo  tribe, came with bright splashes of orange-red on their black skins.  The Pelicans came as a contrast, almost pure white, only a touch here  and there of their black skin showing where the white paint had rubbed  off. The Black Divers came in their black skins, but these polished to  shine like satin. Then came the Millears, the beauties of the Kangaroo  Rat family, who had their home on the morillas. After them came the  Buckandeer or Native Cat tribe, painted in dull colours, but in all  sorts of patterns. Mairas or Paddymelons came too in haste to take part  in the great corrobboree. After them, walking slowly, came the  Bralgahs, looking tall and dignified as they held up their red heads,  painted so in contrast to their French-grey bodies, which they deemed  too dull a colour, unbrightened, for such a gay occasion. Amongst the  many tribes there, too numerous to mention, were the rose and grey  painted Galabs, the green and crimson painted Billai; most brilliant  were they with their bodies grass green and their sides bright crimson,  so afterwards gaining them the name of crimson wings. The bright little  Gidgereegahs came too.    Great was the gathering that Bootoolgah, the crane, and Goonur, the  kangaroo rat, found assembled as they hurried on to the scene.  Bootoolgah had warned Goonur that they must only be spectators, and  take no active part in the corrobboree, as they had to guard their  combee. Obedient to his advice, Goonur seated herself beside him and  slung the comebee over her arm. Bootoolgah warned her to be careful and  not forget she had it. But as the corrobboree went on, so absorbed did  she become that she forgot the comebee, which slipped from her arm.  Happily, Bootoolgah saw it do so, replaced it, and bade her take heed,  so baulking Beeargah, who had been about to seize it, for his vigilance  was unceasing, and, deeming him sick almost unto death, the two whom  lie was watching took no heed of him. Back he crouched, moaning as he  turned, but keeping ever an eye on Goonur. And soon was he rewarded.  Now came the turn of the Bralgahs to dance, and every eye but that of  the watchful one was fixed on them as slowly they came into the ring.  First they advanced, bowed and retired, then they repeated what they  had done before, and again, each time getting faster and faster in  their movements, changing their bows into pirouettes, craning their  long necks and making such antics as they went through the figures of  their dance, and replacing their dignity with such grotesqueness, as to  make their large audience shake with laughter, they themselves keeping  throughout all their grotesque measures a solemn air, which only seemed  to heighten the effect of their antics.    And now came the chance of Beeargah the hawk. In the excitement of the  moment Goonur forgot the comebee, as did Bootoolgah. They joined in the  mirthful applause of the crowd, and Goonur threw herself back helpless  with laughter. As she did so the comebee slipped from her arm. Then up  jumped the sick man from behind her, seized the comebee with his combo,  cut it open, snatched forth the firestick, set fire to the heap of  grass ready near where he had lain, and all before the two realised  their loss. When they discovered the precious comebee was gone, up  jumped Bootoolgah and Goonur. After Beeargah ran Bootoolgah, but  Beeargah had a start and was fleeter of foot, so distanced his pursuer  quickly. As he ran he fired the grass with the stick he still held.  Bootoolgah, finding he could not catch Beeargah, and seeing fires  everywhere, retired from the pursuit, feeling it was useless now to try  and guard their secret, for it had now become the common property of  all the tribes there assembled.          8.  WEEDAH THE MOCKING BIRD      Weedah was playing a great trick on the black fellows who lived near  him. He had built himself a number of grass nyunnoos, more than twenty.  He made fires before each, to make it look as if some one lived in the  nyunnoos. First he would go into one nyunnoo, or humpy, and cry like a  baby, then to another and laugh like a child, then in turn, as he went  the round of the humpies he would sing like a maiden, corrobboree like  a man, call out in a quavering voice like an old man, and in a shrill  voice like an old woman; in fact, imitate any sort of voice he had ever  heard, and imitate them so quickly in succession that any one passing  would think there was a great crowd of blacks in that camp. His object  was to entice as many strange black fellows into his camp as he could,  one at a time; then he would kill them and gradually gain the whole  country round for his own. His chance was when he managed to get a  single black fellow into his camp, which he very often did, then by his  cunning he always gained his end and the black fellow's death. This was  how he attained that end. A black fellow, probably separated from his  fellows in the excitement of the chase, would be returning home alone  passing within earshot of Weedah's camp he would hear the various  voices and wonder what tribe could be there. Curiosity would induce him  to come near. He would probably peer into the camp, and, only seeing  Weedah standing alone, would advance towards him. Weedah would be  standing at a little distance from a big glowing fire, where he would  wait until the strange black fellow came quite close to him. Then he  would ask him what he wanted. The stranger would say he had heard many  voices and had wondered what tribe it could be, so had come near to  find out. Weedah would say, \"But only I am here. How could you have  heard voices? See; look round; I am alone.\" Bewildered, the stranger  would look round and say in a puzzled tone of voice: \"Where are they  all gone? As I came I heard babies crying, men calling, and women  laughing; many voices I heard but you only I see.\"    \"And only I am here. The wind must have stirred the branches of the  balah trees, and you must have thought it was the wailing of children,  the laughing of the gouggourgahgah you heard, and thought it the  laughter of women and mine must have been the voice as of men that you  heard. Alone in the bush, as the shadows fall, a man breeds strange  fancies. See by the light of this fire, where are your fancies now? No  women laugh, no babies cry, only I, Weedah, talk.\" As Weedah was  talking he kept edging the stranger towards the fire; when they were  quite close to it, he turned swiftly, seized him, and threw him right  into the middle of the blaze. This scene was repeated time after time,  until at last the ranks of the black fellows living round the camp of  Weedah began to get thin.    Mullyan, the eagle hawk, determined to fathom the mystery, for as yet  the black fellows had no clue as to how or where their friends had  disappeared. Mullyan, when Beeargah, his cousin, returned to his camp  no more, made up his mind to get on his track and follow it, until at  length he solved the mystery. After following the track of Beeargah, as  he had chased the kangaroo to where he had slain it, on he followed his  homeward trail. Over stony ground he tracked him, and through sand,  across plains, and through scrub. At last in a scrub and still on the  track of Beeargah, he heard the sounds of many voices, babies crying,  women singing, men talking. Peering through the bush, finding the track  took him nearer the spot whence came the sounds, he saw the grass  humpies. \"Who can these be?\" he thought. The track led him right into  the camp, where alone Weedah was to be seen. Mullyan advanced towards  him and asked where were the people whose voices he had heard as he  came through the bush.    Weedah said: \"How can I tell you? I know of no people; I live alone.\"    \"But,\" said Mullyan, the eagle hawk, \"I heard babies crying, women  laughing, and men talking, not one but many.\"    \"And I alone am here. Ask of your cars what trick they played you, or  perhaps your eyes fail you now. Can you see any but me? Look for  yourself.\"    \"And if, as indeed it seems, you only are here, what did you with  Beeargah my cousin, and where are my friends? Many are their trails  that I see coming into this camp, but none going out. And if you alone  live here you alone can answer me.\"    \"What know I of you or your friends? Nothing. Ask of the winds that  blow. Ask of Bahloo the moon, who looks down on the earth by night. Ask  of Yhi the sun, that looks down by day. But ask not Weedah, who dwells  alone, and knows naught of your friends.\" But as Weedah was talking he  was carefully edging Mullyan towards the fire.    Mullyan, the eagle hawk, too, was cunning, and not easy to trap. He saw  a blazing fire in front of him, lie saw the track of his friend behind  him, he saw Weedah was edging him towards the fire, and it came to him  in a moment the thought that if the fire could speak, well could it  tell where were his friends. But the time was not yet come to show that  he had fathomed the mystery. So he affected to fall into the trap. But  when they reached the fire, "]]]
