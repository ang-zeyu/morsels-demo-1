When the dog came back  to me in this way I lost not a second in accepting the shelter of the  nearest hedge or deepest ditch till the danger was past. If suddenly  surprised and without means of hiding, myself and the dog would make off  in different directions. Then there were times when it was inconvenient  that we should know each other, and upon such occasions the dogs would  not recognise me even upon the strongest provocation.    My best lurchers knew as much of the habits of game as I did. According  to the class of land to be worked they were aware whether hares,  partridges, or rabbits were to constitute the game for the night. They  judged to a nicety the speed at which a hare should be driven to make a  snare effective, and acted accordingly. At night the piercing scream of  a netted hare can be heard to a great distance, and no sound sooner puts  the keeper on the alert.    Consequently, when \"puss\" puts her neck into a wire, or madly jumps into  a gate-net, the dog is on her in an instant, and quickly stops her  piteous squeal. In field-netting rabbits, lurchers are equally quick,  seeming quite to appreciate the danger of noise. Once only have I heard  a lurcher give mouth. \"Rough\" was a powerful, deep-chested bitch, but  upon one occasion she failed to jump a stiff, stone fence, with a  nine-pound hare in her mouth. She did not bark, however, until she had  several times failed at the fence, and when she thought her whereabouts  were unknown. Hares and partridges invariably squat on the fallow or in  the stubble when alarmed, and remain absolutely still till the danger is  passed. This act is much more likely to be observed by the dog than its  master, and in such cases the lurchers gently rubbed my shins to apprise  me of the fact. Then I moved more cautiously. Out-lying pheasants,  rabbits in the clumps, red grouse on the heather--the old dog missed  none of them. Every movement was noted, and each came to the capacious  pocket in turn. The only serious fights I ever had were when keepers  threatened to shoot the dogs. This was a serious matter. Lurchers take  long to train, and a keeper's summary proceeding often stops a whole  winter's work, as the best dogs cannot easily be replaced. Many a one of  our craft would as soon have been shot himself as seen his dog  destroyed; and there are few good dogs which have not, at one time or  other, been riddled with pellets during their lawless (save the mark!)  career. If a hare happens to be seen, the dog sometimes works it so  cleverly as to \"chop\" it in its \"form\"; and both hares and rabbits are  not unfrequently snapped up without being run at all. In fact,  depredations in fur would be exceedingly limited without the aid of  dogs; and one country squire saved his ground game for a season by  buying my best brace of lurchers at a very fancy price; while upon  another occasion a bench of magistrates demanded to see the dogs of  whose doings they had heard so much. In short, my lurchers at night  embodied all my senses.    Whilst preparing my nets and wires, the dogs would whine impatiently to  be gone. Soon their ears were pricked out on the track, though until  told to leave they stuck doggedly to heel. Soon the darkness would blot  out even the forms of surrounding objects, and our movements were made  more cautiously. A couple of snares are set in gaps in an old thorn  fence not more than a yard apart. These are delicately manipulated, as  we know from previous knowledge that the hare will take one of them. The  black dog is sent over, the younger fawn bitch staying behind. The  former slinks slowly down the field, sticking close to the cover of a  fence running at right angles to the one in which the wires are set. I  have arranged that the wind shall blow from the dog and across to the  hare's seat when the former shall come opposite. The ruse acts; \"puss\"  is alarmed, but not terrified; she gets up and goes quietly away for the  hedge. The dog is crouched, anxiously watching; she is making right for  the snare, though something must be added to her speed to make the wire  effective. As the dog closes in, I wait, bowed, with hands on knees,  still as death, for her coming. I hear the brush of the grass, the trip,  trip, trip, as the herbage is brushed. There is a rustle among the dead  leaves, a desperate rush, a momentary squeal--and the wire has tightened  round her throat.    Again we trudge silently along the lane, but soon stop to listen. Then  we disperse, but to any on-looker would seem to have dissolved. This dry  ditch is capacious, and its dead herbage tall and tangled. A heavy foot,  with regular beat, approaches along the road, and dies slowly away in  the distance.    Hares love green cornstalks, and a field of young wheat is at hand; I  spread a net, twelve feet by six, at the gate, and at a sign the dogs  depart different ways. Their paths soon converge, for the night is torn  by a piteous cry; the road is enveloped in a cloud of dust; and in the  midst of the confusion the dogs dash over the fence. They must have  found their game near the middle of the field, and driven the hares--for  there are two--so hard that they carried the net right before them;  every struggle wraps another mesh about them, and, in a moment, their  screams are quieted. By a quick movement I wrap the long net about my  arm, and, taking the noiseless sward, get hastily away from the spot.    In March, when hares are pairing, four or five may frequently be found  together in one field. Although wild, they seem to lose much of their  natural timidity, and during this month I usually reaped a rich harvest.  I was always careful to set my wires and snares on the side _opposite_  to that from which the game would come, for this reason--that hares  approach any place through which they are about to pass in a zig-zag  manner. They come on, playing and frisking, stopping now and then to  nibble the herbage. Then they canter, making wide leaps at right angles  to their path, and sit listening upon their haunches. A freshly  impressed footmark, the scent of dog or man, almost invariably turns  them back. Of course these traces are certain to be left if the snare be  set on the _near_ side of the gate or fence, and then a hare will refuse  to take it, even when hard pressed. Now here is a wrinkle to any keeper  who cares to accept it. Where poaching is prevalent and hares abundant,  _every hare on the estate should be netted_, for it is a fact well known  to every poacher versed in his craft, that an escaped hare that has  once been netted can never be retaken. The process, however, will  effectually frighten a small percentage of hares off the land  altogether.    [Illustration]    The human scent left at gaps and gateways by ploughmen, shepherds, and  mouchers, the wary poacher will obliterate by driving sheep over the  spot before he begins operations. On the sides of fells and uplands  hares are difficult to kill. This can only be accomplished by swift  dogs, which are taken _above_ the game. Puss is made to run down-hill,  when, from her peculiar formation, she goes at a disadvantage.    Audacity almost invariably stands the poacher in good stead. Here is an  actual incident. I knew of a certain field of young wheat in which was  several hares--a fact observed during the day. This was hard by the  keeper's cottage, and surrounded by a high fence of loose stones. It  will be seen that the situation was somewhat critical, but that night my  nets were set at the gates through which the hares always made. To drive  them the dog was to range the field, entering it at a point furthest  away from the gate. I bent my back in the road a yard from the wall to  aid the dog. It retired, took a mighty spring, and barely touching my  shoulders, bounded over the fence. The risk was justified by the haul,  for that night I bagged nine good hares.    Owing to the scarcity of game, hare-poaching is now hardly worth  following, and I believe that what is known as the _Ground Game Act_ is  mainly responsible for this. A country Justice, who has often been my  friend when I was sadly in need of one, asked me why I thought the Hares  and Rabbits Act had made both kinds of fur scarcer. I told him that the  hare would become abundant again if it were not beset by so many  enemies. Since 1880 it has had no protection, and the numbers have gone  down amazingly. A shy and timid animal, it is worried through every  month of the year. It does not burrow, and has not the protection of the  rabbit. Although the colour of its fur resembles that of the dead grass  and herbage among which it lies, yet it starts from its \"form\" at the  approach of danger, and from its size makes an easy mark. It is not  unfrequently \"chopped\" by sheep-dogs, and in certain months hundreds of  leverets perish in this way. Hares are destroyed wholesale during the  mowing of the grass and the reaping of the corn. For a time in summer,  leverets especially seek this kind of cover, and farmers and  farm-labourers kill numbers with dog and gun--and this at a time when  they are quite unfit for food. In addition to these causes of scarcity  there are others well known to sportsmen. When harriers hunt late in the  season--as they invariably do now-a-days--many leverets are \"chopped,\"  and for every hare that goes away three are killed in the manner  indicated. At least, that is my experience while mouching in the wake of  the hounds. When hunting continues through March, master and huntsman  assert that this havoc is necessary in order to kill off superabundant  jack-hares, and so preserve the balance of stock. Doubtless there was  reason in this argument before the present scarcity, but now there is  none. March, too, is a general breeding month, and the hunting of  doe-hares entails the grossest cruelty."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36974"],[0,"Old Trails on the Niagara Frontier (#6)"],[1,"permitted to voyage westward from the Niagara  with the gallant La Salle. When the Griffon sailed, Father Melithon  Watteaux was left behind in the little palisaded house at Niagara as  chaplain. He takes his place in our history as the first Catholic priest  appointed to minister to whites in New York State. On May 27, 1679, La  Salle had made a grant of land at Niagara to these Recollect Fathers,  for a residence and cemetery, and this was the first property in the  present State of New York to which the Catholic Church held title. Who  can say what were the experiences of the priest during the succeeding  winter in the loneliness and dangers of the savage-infested wilderness?  Nowhere have I as yet found any detailed account of his sojourn. We  know, however, that it was not long. During the succeeding years there  was some passing to and fro. In 1680 La Salle, returning east, passed  the site of his ruined and abandoned fort. He was again on the Niagara  in 1681 with a considerable party bound for the Miami. Father Membre,  who was with him, returned east in October, 1682, by the Niagara route;  and La Salle himself passed down the river again in 1683--his last visit  to the Niagara. His blockhouse, within which was Father Melithon's  chapel, had been burned by the Senecas.    From this time on for over half a century the missionary work in our  region centered at Fort Niagara, which still stands, a manifold reminder  of the romantic past, at the mouth of the river. Four years after La  Salle's last passage through the Niagara--in 1687--the Marquis de  Denonville led his famous expedition against the Senecas. With him in  this campaign was a band of Western Indians, who were attended by the  Jesuit Father Enjalran. He was wounded in the battle with the Senecas  near Boughton Hill, but appears to have accompanied de Denonville to his  rendezvous on the site of Fort Niagara. Here he undoubtedly exercised  his sacred office; and since the construction of Fort Niagara began at  this time his name may head the list of priests officiating at that  stronghold. He was soon after dispatched on a peace mission to the West,  which was the special scene of his labors. His part, for some years to  come, was to be an important one as Superior of the Jesuit Mission at  Michillimackinac.    As soon as Fort Niagara was garrisoned, Father Jean de Lamberville was  sent thither as chaplain. For the student, it would be profitable to  dwell at length upon the ministrations of this devoted priest. He was of  the Society of Jesus, had come out to Canada in 1668, and labored in the  Onondaga mission from 1671 to 1687. His work is indelibly written on the  history of missions in our State. He was the innocent cause of a party  of Iroquois falling into the hands of the French, who sent them to  France, where they toiled in the king's galleys. When de Denonville, in  1687, left at Fort Niagara a garrison of one hundred men under the  Chevalier de la Mothe, Father Lamberville came to minister to them. The  hostile Iroquois had been dealt a heavy blow, but a more insidious and  dreadful enemy soon appeared within the gates. The provisions which had  been left for the men proved utterly unfit for food, so that disease,  with astounding swiftness, swept away most of the garrison, including  the commander. Father Lamberville, himself, was soon stricken down with  the scurvy. Every man in the fort would no doubt have perished but for  the timely arrival of a party of friendly Miami Indians, through whose  good offices the few survivors, Father Lamberville among them, were  enabled to make their way to Catarouquoi--now Kingston, Ont. There he  recovered; and he continued in the Canadian missions until 1698, when he  returned to France.    Not willing to see his ambitious fort on the Niagara so soon abandoned,  de Denonville sent out a new garrison and with them came Father Pierre  Milet. He had labored, with rich results, among the Onondagas and  Oneidas. No sooner was he among his countrymen, in this remote and  forlorn corner of the earth, than he took up his spiritual work with  characteristic zeal. On Good Friday of that year, 1688, in the center of  the square within the palisades, he caused to be erected a great cross.  It was of wood, eighteen feet high, hewn from the forest trees and  neatly framed. On the arms of it was carved in abbreviated words the  sacred legend, \"_Regnat, Vincit, Imperat Christus_,\" and in the midst of  it was engraven the Sacred Heart. Surrounded by the officers of the  garrison,--gallant men of France, with shining records, some of them  were,--by the soldiers, laborers and friendly Indians, Father Milet  solemnly blessed it. Can you not see the little band, kneeling about  that symbol of conquest? Around them were the humble cabins and quarters  of the soldiers. One of them, holding the altar, was consecrated to  worship. Beyond ran the palisades and earthworks--feeble fortifications  between the feeble garrison and the limitless, foe-infested wilderness.  On one hand smiled the blue Ontario, and at their feet ran the gleaming  Niagara, already a synonym of hardship and suffering in the annals of  three of the religious orders. What wonder that the sense of isolation  and feebleness was borne in upon the little band, or that they devoutly  bowed before the cross which was the visible emblem of their strength  and consolation in the wilderness. Where is the artist who shall paint  us this scene, unique in the annals of any people?    And yet, but a few months later--September 15th of that year--the  garrison was recalled, the post abandoned, the palisades broken down,  the cabins left rifled and empty; and when priest and soldiers had  sailed away, and only the prowling wolf or the stealthy Indian ventured  near the spot, Father Milet's great cross still loomed amid the  solitude, a silent witness of the faith which knows no vanquishing.    There followed an interim in the occupancy of the Niagara when neither  sword nor altar held sway here; nor was the altar reestablished in our  region until the permanent rebuilding of Fort Niagara in 1726. True,  Father Charlevoix passed up the river in 1721, and has left an  interesting account of his journey, his view of the falls, and his brief  tarrying at the carrying-place--now Lewiston. This spot was the  principal rendezvous of the region for many years; and here, at the  cabin of the interpreter Joncaire, where Father Charlevoix was received,  we may be sure that spiritual ministrations were not omitted. A somewhat  similar incident, twenty-eight years later, was the coming to these  shores of the Jesuit Father Bonnecamps. He was not only the spiritual  leader but appears to have acted as pilot and guide to De Celoron's  expedition--an abortive attempt on the part of Louis XV. to reesablish  the claims of France to the inland regions of America. The expedition  came up the St. Lawrence and through Lake Ontario, reaching Fort Niagara  on July 6, 1749. It passed up the river, across to the south shore of  Lake Erie and by way of Chautauqua Lake and the Allegheny down the Ohio.  Returning from its utterly futile adventure, we find the party resting  at Fort Niagara for three days, October 19-21. Who the resident chaplain  was at the post at that date I have not been able to ascertain; but we  may be sure that he had a glad greeting for Father Bonnecamps. From  1726, when, as already mentioned, the fort was rebuilt, until its  surrender to Sir Wm. Johnson in 1759, a garrison was continually  maintained, and without doubt was constantly attended by a chaplain. The  register of the post during these years has never been found--the  presumption being that it was destroyed by the English--so that the  complete list of priests who ministered there is not known.    Only here and there from other sources do we glean a name by which to  continue the succession. Father Crespel was stationed at Fort Niagara  for about three years from 1729, interrupting his ministrations there  with a journey to Detroit, where his order--the Society of Jesus--had  established a mission. Of Fort Niagara at this time he says: \"I found  the place very agreeable; hunting and fishing were very productive; the  woods in their greatest beauty, and full of walnut and chestnut trees,  oaks, elms and some others, far superior to any we see in France.\" But  not even the banks of the Niagara were to prove an earthly paradise.  \"The fever,\" he continues, \"soon destroyed the pleasures we began to  find, and much incommoded us, until the beginning of autumn, which  season dispelled the unwholesome air. We passed the winter very quietly,  and would have passed it very agreeably, if the vessel which was to have  brought us refreshments had not encountered a storm on the lake, and  been obliged to put back to Frontenac, which laid us under the necessity  of drinking nothing but water. As the winter advanced, she dared not  proceed, and we did not receive our stores till May.\"    Remember the utter isolation of this post and mission at the period we  are considering. To be sure, it was a link in the chain of French posts,  which included Quebec, Montreal, Kingston, Niagara, Detroit,  Michillimackinac; but in winter the water route for transport was  closed, and Niagara, like the upper posts, was thrown on its own  resources for existence. There is no place in our domain to-day which  fairly may be compared to it for isolation and remoteness. The upper  reaches of Alaskan rivers are scarcely less known to the world than was  the Niagara at the beginning of the last century. A little fringe of  settlement--hostile settlement at that--stretched up the Hudson from New  York. Even the Mohawk Valley was still unsettled. From the Hudson to  the remotest West the wilderness stretched as a sea, and Fort Niagara  was buried in its midst. Although a full century had gone by since  Father Dallion first reached its"]]]
