In the original MS. occurs a reference (struck out) to Aristarchus of  Samos as holding the theory of the earth's motion. (Prowe: II, 507,  note.) The finding of this passage proves that Copernicus had at least  heard of Aristarchus, but his apparent indifference is the more  strange since an account of his teaching occurs in the same book of  Plutarch from which Copernicus learned about Philolaus. But the chief  source of our knowledge about Aristarchus is through Archimedes, and  the editio princeps of his works did not appear till 1544, a year  after the death of Copernicus. C.R.

But his devoted pupil and friend,  Rheticus, aided by Tiedeman Giese, Bishop of Culm and a lifelong  friend, at length (1542) persuaded him.[120] So he entrusted the  matter to Giese who passed it on to Rheticus, then connected with the  University at Wittenberg as professor of mathematics.[121] Rheticus,  securing leave of absence from Melancthon his superior, went to  Nuernberg to supervise the printing.[122] This was done by Petrejus.  Upon his return to Wittenberg, Rheticus left in charge Johann Schoener,  a famous mathematician and astronomer, and Andreas Osiander, a  Lutheran preacher interested in astronomy. The printed book[123] was  placed in Copernicus's hands at Frauenburg on May 24th, 1543, as he  lay dying of paralysis.[124]    [Footnote 118: Copernicus: Dedication, 3.]    [Footnote 119: Prowe: II, 362-7.]    [Footnote 120: Ibid: II, 406.]    [Footnote 121: Ibid: II, 501.]    [Footnote 122: Ibid: II, 517-20.]    [Footnote 123: Four other editions have since appeared; at Basel,  1566, Amsterdam 1617, Warsaw 1847, and Thorn 1873.

The  edition cited in this study is the Thorn one of 1873.]    [Footnote 124: Prowe: II, 553-4.]    Copernicus passed away that day in ignorance that his life's work  appeared before the world not as a truth but as an hypothesis; for  there had been inserted an anonymous preface \"ad lectorem de  hypothesibus huius opera\" stating this was but another hypothesis for  the greater convenience of astronomers.[125] \"Neque enim necesse est  eas hypotheses esse veras, imo ne verisimiles quidem, sed sufficit hoc  unum, si calculum observationibus congruentem exhibeant.\"[126] For  years Copernicus was thought to have written this preface to disarm  criticism. Kepler sixty years later (1601) called attention to this  error,[127] and quoted Osiander's letters to Copernicus and to  Rheticus of May, 1541, suggesting that the system be called an  hypothesis to avert attacks by theologians and Aristotelians. He  claimed that Osiander had written the preface; but Kepler's article  never was finished and remained unpublished till 1858.[128] Giese and  Rheticus of course knew that the preface falsified Copernicus's work,  and Giese, highly indignant at the \"impiety\" of the printer (who he  thought had written it to save himself from blame) wrote Rheticus  urging him to write another \"praefatiunculus\" purging the book of this  falsehood.[129] This letter is dated July 26, 1543, and the book had  appeared in April. Apparently nothing was done and the preface was  accepted without further challenge.    [Footnote 125: Copernicus: _De Revolutionibus_, I. \"To the reader on  the hypotheses of this book.\"]    [Footnote 126: \"For it is not necessary that these hypotheses be true,  nor even probable, but this alone is sufficient, if they show  reasoning fitting the observations.\"]    [Footnote 127: Kepler: _Apologia Tychonis contra Ursum_ in _Op. Om._:  I, 244-246.]    [Footnote 128: Prowe: II, 251, note.]    [Footnote 129: Ibid: II, 537-9.]    It remains to ask whether people other than Copernicus's intimates had  known of his theory before 1543. Peucer, Melancthon's nephew, declared  Copernicus was famous by 1525,[130] and the invitation from the  Lateran Council committee indicates his renown as early as 1514. In  Vienna in 1873[131] there was found a _Commentariolus_, or summary of  his great work,[132] written by Copernicus for the scholars friendly  to him. It was probably written soon after 1530, and gives a full  statement of his views following a series of seven axioms or theses  summing up the new theory. This little book probably occasioned the  order from Pope Clement VII in 1533 to Widmanstadt to report to him on  the new scheme.[133] This Widmanstadt did in the papal gardens before  the Pope with several of the cardinals and bishops, and was presented  with a book as his reward.    [Footnote 130: Ibid: II, 273.]    [Footnote 131: Ibid: II, 286-7.]    [Footnote 132: A second copy was found at Upsala shortly afterwards,  though for centuries its existence was unknown save for two slight  references to such a book, one by Gemma Frisius, the other by Tycho  Brahe. Prowe: II, 284.]    [Footnote 133: Ibid: II, 273-4.]    In 1536, the Cardinal Bishop of Capua, Nicolas von Schoenberg,  apparently with the intent to pave the way for the theory at Rome,  wrote for a report of it.[134] It is not known whether the report was  sent, and the cardinal died the following year. But that Copernicus  was pleased by this recognition is evident from the prominence he gave  to the cardinal's letter, as he printed it in his book at the  beginning, even before the dedication to the Pope.    [Footnote 134: Prowe: II, 274, note.]    The most widely circulated account at this time, however, was the  _Narratio Prima_, a letter from Georg Joachim of Rhaetia (better known  as Rheticus), written in October, 1539, from Frauenburg to Johann  Schoener at Nuernberg.[135] Rheticus,[136] at twenty-five years of age  professor of mathematics at Wittenberg, had gone uninvited to  Frauenburg early that summer to visit Copernicus and learn for himself  more in detail about this new system. This was rather a daring  undertaking, for not only were Luther and Melancthon outspoken in  their condemnation of Copernicus, but Rheticus was going from  Wittenberg, the headquarters of the Lutheran heresy, into the  bishopric of Ermeland where to the Bishop and the King his overlord,  the very name of Luther was anathema. Nothing daunted, Rheticus  departed for Frauenberg and could not speak too highly of the cordial  welcome he received from the old astronomer. He came for a few weeks,  and remained two years to return to Wittenberg as an avowed believer  in the system and its first teacher and promulgator. Not only did he  write the _Narratio Prima_ and an _Encomium Borussae_, both extolling  Copernicus, but what is more important, he succeeded in persuading him  to allow the publication of the _De Revolutionibus_. Rheticus returned  to his post in 1541, to resign it the next year and become Dean of the  Faculty of Arts. In all probability the conflict was too intense  between his new scientific beliefs and the statements required of him  as professor of the old mathematics and astronomy.    [Footnote 135: Prowe: II, 426-440.]    [Footnote 136: Ibid: II, 387-405.]    His colleague, Erasmus Reinhold, continued to teach astronomy there,  though he, too, accepted the Copernican system.[137] He published a  series of tables (_Tabulae Prutenicae_, 1551) based on the Copernican  calculations to supersede the inaccurate ones by Regiomontanus; and  these were in general use throughout Europe for the next seventy-odd  years. As he himself declared, the series was based in its principles  and fundamentals upon the observations of the famous Nicolaus  Copernicus. The almanacs deduced from these calculations probably did  more to bring the new system into general recognition and gradual  acceptance than did the theoretical works.[138]    [Footnote 137: Ibid: II, 391.]    [Footnote 138: Holden in _Pop. Sci._, 119.]    Opposition to the theory had not yet gathered serious headway. There  is record[139] of a play poking fun at the system and its originator,  written by the Elbing schoolmaster (a Dutch refugee from the  Inquisition) and given in 1531 by the villagers at Elbing (3 miles  from Frauenburg). Elbing and Ermeland were hostile to each other,  Copernicus was well known in Elbing though probably from afar, for  there seems to have been almost no personal intercourse between canons  and people, and the spread of Luther's teachings had intensified the  hostility of the villagers towards the Church and its representatives.  But not until Giordano Bruno made the Copernican system the  starting-point of his philosophy was the Roman Catholic Church  seriously"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3580"],[0,"Recollections of the Private Life of Napoleon — Complete (#6)"],[1,"g.    All were admitted at Madame Bonaparte's on a footing of equality, which  was most gratifying. There came familiarly Murat, Duroc, Berthier, and  all those who have since figured as great dignitaries, and some even as  sovereigns, in the annals of the empire.    The family of General Bonaparte were assiduous in their attentions; but  it was known among us that they had no love for Madame Bonaparte, of  which fact I had many proofs. Mademoiselle Hortense never left her  mother, and they were devotedly attached to each other.    Besides men distinguished by their posts under the government or in the  army, there gathered others also who were not less distinguished by  personal merit, or the position which their birth had given them before  the Revolution. It was a veritable panorama, in which we saw the persons  themselves pass before our eyes. The scene itself, even exclusive of the  gayety which always attended the dinings of Eugene, had its attractions.  Among those whom we saw most frequently were Volney, Denon, Lemercier,  the Prince of Poix, de Laigle, Charles Baudin, General Beurnonville,  Isabey, and a number of others, celebrated in science, literature, and  art; in short, the greater part of those who composed the society of  Madame de Montesson.    Madame Bonaparte and Mademoiselle Hortense often took excursions on  horseback into the country. On these occasions her most constant escorts  were the Prince de Poix and M. de Laigle. One day, as this party was  reentering the court-yard at Malmaison, the horse which Hortense rode  became frightened, and dashed off. She was an accomplished rider, and  very active, so she attempted to spring off on the grass by the roadside;  but the band which fastened the end of her riding-skirt under her foot  prevented her freeing herself quickly, and she was thrown, and dragged by  her horse for several yards. Fortunately the gentlemen of the party,  seeing her fall, sprang from their horses in time to rescue her; and, by  extraordinary good fortune, she was not even bruised, and was the first  to laugh at her misadventure.    During the first part of my stay at Malmaison, the First Consul always  slept with his wife, like an ordinary citizen of the middle classes in  Paris; and I heard no rumor of any intrigue in the chateau. The persons  of this society, most of whom were young, and who were often very  numerous, frequently took part in sports which recalled college days.  In fact, one of the greatest diversions of the inhabitants of Malmaison  was to play \"prisoners' base.\" It was usually after dinner; and  Bonaparte, Lauriston, Didelot, de Lucay, de Bourrienne, Eugene, Rapp,  Isabey, Madame Bonaparte, and Mademoiselle Hortense would divide  themselves into two camps, in which the prisoners taken, or exchanged,  would recall to the First Consul the greater game, which he so much  preferred. In these games the most active runners were Eugene, Isabey,  and Hortense. As to General Bonaparte, he often fell, but rose laughing  boisterously.    General Bonaparte and his family seemed to enjoy almost unexampled  happiness, especially when at Malmaison, which residence, though  agreeable at that time, was far from being what it has since become.  This estate consisted of the chateau, which Bonaparte found in bad  condition on his return from Egypt, a park already somewhat improved, and  a farm, the income of which did not with any certainty exceed twelve  thousand francs a year. Josephine directed in person all the  improvements made there, and no woman ever possessed better taste.    From the first, they played amateur comedy at Malmaison, which was a  relaxation the First Consul enjoyed greatly, but in which he took no part  himself except that of looker-on. Every one in the house attended these  representations; and I must confess we felt perhaps even more pleasure  than others in seeing thus travestied on the stage those in whose service  we were.    The Malmaison Troupe, if I may thus style actors of such exalted social  rank, consisted principally of Eugene, Jerome, Lauriston, de Bourrienne,  Isabey, de Leroy, Didelot, Mademoiselle Hortense, Madame Caroline Murat,  and the two Mademoiselles Auguie, one of whom afterwards married Marshal  Ney,       [Michel Ney, Styled by Napoleon the \"bravest of the brave,\" was     born 1769, at Sarre-Louis (now in Prussia), son of a cooper.     Entered the army as a private 1787, adjutant-general 1794, general     of brigade 1796, general of division 1799, marshal 1804, Duke of     Elchingen 1805, Prince of Moskwa 1812, and commanded the rear-guard     in the famous retreat from Russia. On the return from Elba he went     over to Napoleon; was at Waterloo. Was afterwards taken, and in     spite of the terms of the surrender of Paris was tried for treason,     and shot in the gardens of the Luxembourg, Dec. 8, 1815.--TRANS.]    and the other M. de Broc. All four were very young and charming, and few  theaters in Paris could show four actresses as pretty. In addition to  which, they showed much grace in their acting, and played their parts  with real talent; and were as natural on the stage as in the saloon,  where they bore themselves with exquisite grace and refinement. At first  the repertoire contained little variety, though the pieces were generally  well selected. The first representation which I attended was the \"Barber  of Seville\" in which Isabey played the role of Figaro, and Mademoiselle  Hortense that of Rosine--and the \"Spiteful Lover.\" Another time I saw  played the \"Unexpected Wager,\" and \"False Consultations.\" Hortense and  Eugene played this last piece perfectly; and I still recall that, in the  role of Madame le Blanc, Hortense appeared prettier than ever in the  character of an old woman, Eugene representing Le Noir, and Lauriston the  charlatan. The First Consul, as I have said, confined himself to the  role of spectator; but he seemed to take in these fireside plays, so to  speak, the greatest pleasure, laughed and applauded heartily, though  sometimes he also criticised.    Madame Bonaparte was also highly entertained; and even if she could not  always boast of the successful acting of her children, \"the chiefs of the  troupe,\" it sufficed her that it was an agreeable relaxation to her  husband, and seemed to give him pleasure; for her constant study was to  contribute to the happiness of the great man who had united her destiny  with his own.    When the day for the presentation of a play had been appointed, there was  never any postponement, but often a change of the play; not because of  the indisposition, or fit of the blues, of an actress (as often happens  in the theaters of Paris), but for more serious reasons. It sometimes  happened that M. d'Etieulette received orders to rejoin his regiment, or  an important mission was confided to Count Almaviva, though Figaro and  Rosine always remained at their posts; and the desire of pleasing the  First Consul was, besides, so general among all those who surrounded him,  that the substitutes did their best in the absence of the principals, and  the play never failed for want of an actor.       [Michau, of the Comedie Francaise, was the instructor of the     troupe. Wherever it happened that an actor was wanting in     animation, Michau would exclaim. \"Warmth! Warmth! Warmth!\"     --Note by CONSTANT.]          CHAPTER III.    I had been only a very short time in the service of Madame Bonaparte when  I made the acquaintance of Charvet, the concierge of Malmaison, and in  connection with this estimable man became each day more and more  intimate, till at last he gave me one of his daughters in marriage.  I was eager to learn from him all that he could tell me concerning Madame  Bonaparte and the First Consul prior to my entrance into the house; and  in our frequent conversations he took the greatest pleasure in satisfying  my curiosity. It is to him I owe the following details as to the mother  and daughter.    When General Bonaparte set out for Egypt, Madame Bonaparte accompanied  him as far as Toulon, and was extremely anxious to go with him to Egypt.  When the general made objections, she observed that having been born a  Creole, the heat of the climate would be more favorable than dangerous to  her. By a singular coincidence it was on 'La Pomone' that she wished to  make the journey; that is to say, on the very same vessel which in her  early youth had brought her from Martinique to France. General  Bonaparte, finally yielding to the wishes of his wife, promised to send  'La Pomone' for her, and bade her go in the meantime to take the waters  at Plombieres. The matter being arranged between husband and wife,  Madame Bonaparte was delighted to go to the springs of Plombieres which  she had desired to visit for a long time, knowing, like every one else,  the reputation these waters enjoyed for curing barrenness in women.    Madame Bonaparte had been only a short time at Plombieres, when one  morning, while occupied in hemming a turban and chatting with the ladies  present, Madame de Cambis, who was on the balcony, called to her to come  and see a pretty little dog passing along the street. All the company  hastened with Madame Bonaparte to the balcony, which caused it to fall  with a frightful crash. By a most fortunate chance, no one was killed;  though Madame de Cambis had her leg broken, and Madame Bonaparte was most  painfully bruised, without, however, receiving any fracture. Charvet,  who was in a room behind the saloon, heard the noise, and at once had a  sheep killed and skinned, and Madame Bonaparte wrapped in the skin. It  was a long while before she regained her health, her arms and her hands  especially being so bruised that she was for a long time unable to use  them; and it was necessary to cut up her food, feed her, and, in fact,  perform the same offices for her as for an infant.    I related above that Josephine thought she was to rejoin her"]]]
