In that day it would seem the angels only dared to come by  stealth, so unpopular was their coming. But the _way_ was opened for  the angels. What wonder that they have since come in hosts good and  bad, and made their advent popular? Millions testify to their advent  now; and \"modern spiritualism,\" though of \"another source,\" is a proof  of Mormonism more astonishing than prophecy herself.    Yet is all this not more remarkable than the promise which Joseph Smith  made to the world in proclaiming his mission. It was the identical  promise of Christ: \"These signs shall follow them that believe!\" These  signs meant nothing short of all that extraordinary experience familiar  to the Hebrew people and the early-day saints. We have no record that  ever this sweeping promise was made before by any one but Jesus Christ.  Yet Joseph Smith, filled with a divine assurance, dared to re-affirm it  and apply the promise to all nations wherever the gospel of his mission  should be preached. The most wonderful of tests is this. But the test  was fulfilled. The signs followed all, and everywhere. Even apostates  witness to this much.    There is nothing in modern spiritualism nearly so marvelous as was  Mormonism in its rise and progress in America and Great Britain. It has  indeed made stir enough in the world. But it had to break the way for  coming ages. Revelation was at first a very new and strange theme after  the more than Egyptian darkness in which the Christian nations had been  for fifty generations. It was the light set upon the hill now; but the  darkness comprehended it not. Yet was a spiritual dispensation opened  again to the world. Once more was the lost key found. Mormonism was the  key; and it was Joseph and his God-fearing disciples who unlocked the  heavens. That fact the world will acknowledge in the coming times.        CHAPTER IV.    BIRTH OF THE CHURCH--KIRTLAND AS THE BRIDE, IN THE CHAMBERS OF THE  WILDERNESS--THE EARLY GATHERING--\"MOTHER WHITNEY,\" AND ELIZA R. SNOW.    The birth-place of Mormonism was in the State of New York. There the  angels first administered to the youthful prophet; there in the \"Hill  Cumorah,\" near the village of Palmyra, the plates of the book of Mormon  were revealed by Moroni; there, at Manchester, on the 6th of April,  1830, the \"Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\" was organized,  with six members.    But the divine romance of the sisterhood best opens at Kirtland. It is  the place where this Israelitish drama of our times commenced its first  distinguishing scenes,--the place where the first Mormon temple was  built.    Ohio was the \"Great West.\" Kirtland, the city of the saints, with its  temple, dedicated to the God of Israel, rose in Ohio.    Not, however, as the New Jerusalem of America, was Kirtland founded;  but pioneer families, from New England, had settled in Ohio, who early  received the gospel of the Latter-day Church.    Thus Kirtland became an adopted Zion, selected by revelation as a  gathering place for the saints; and a little village grew into a city,  with a temple.    Among these pioneers were the families of \"Mother Whitney,\" and Eliza  R. Snow, and the families of \"Father Morley,\" and Edward Partridge, who  became the \"first Bishop\" of Zion.    Besides these, there were a host of men and women soon numbered among  the founders of Mormondom, who were also pioneers in Ohio, Missouri,  and Illinois.    There is no feature of the Mormons more interesting than their  distinguishing mark as pioneers. In this both their Church and family  history have a national significance.    Trace their family migrations from old England to New England in the  seventeenth century; from Europe to America in the nineteenth; then  follow them as a people in their empire-track from the State of New  York, where their Church was born, to Utah and California! It will  thus be remarkably illustrated that they and their parents have been  pioneering not only America but the world itself to the \"Great West\"  for the last two hundred and fifty years!    As a community the Mormons have been emphatically the Church of  pioneers. The sisters have been this equally with the brethren. Their  very religion is endowed with the genius of migrating peoples.    So in 1830-31, almost as soon as the Church was organized, the prophet  and the priesthood followed the disciples to the West, where the star  of Messiah was rising.    As though the bride had been preparing for the coming! As though,  womanlike, intuitively, she had gone into the wilderness--the chambers  of a new civilization--to await the bridegroom.    For the time being Kirtland became the Zion of the West; for the time  being Kirtland among cities was the bride.    But the illustration is also personal. Woman herself had gone to the  West where the star of Messiah was looming. Daughters of the New  Jerusalem were already in the chamber awaiting the bridegroom.    Early in the century, two had pioneered into the State of Ohio, who  have since been, for a good lifetime, high priestesses of the Mormon  temples. And the voice of prophesy has declared that these have the  sacred blood of Israel in their veins. In the divine mysticism of their  order they are at once of a kingly and priestly line.    There is a rare consistency in the mysticism of the Mormon Church. The  daughters of the temple are so by right of blood and inheritance. They  are discovered by gift of revelation in Him who is the voice of the  Church; but they inherit from the fathers and mothers of the temple of  the Old Jerusalem.    And so these two of the principal heroines of Mormondom--\"Mother  Whitney\" and \"Sister Eliza R. Snow\"--introduced first as the two  earliest of the Church who pioneered to the \"Great West,\" before the  advent of their prophet, as well as introduced for the divine part  which they have played in the marvelous history of their people.    These are high priestesses! These are two rare prophetesses! These  have the gifts of revelation and \"tongues!\" These administer in \"holy  places\" for the living and the dead.    It was about the year of our Lord 1806 that Oliver Snow, a native of  Massachusetts, and his wife, R. L. Pettibone Snow, of Connecticut,  moved with their children to that section of the State of Ohio  bordering on Lake Erie on the north and the State of Pennsylvania  on the east, known then as the \"Connecticut Western Reserve.\" They  purchased land and settled in Mantua, Portage county.    Eliza R. Snow, who was the second of seven children, four daughters  and three sons, one of whom is the accomplished apostle Lorenzo Snow,  was born in Becket, Berkshire county, Mass., January 21st, 1804.  Her parents were of English descent; their ancestors were among the  earliest settlers of New England.    Although a farmer by occupation, Oliver Snow performed much public  business, officiating in several responsible positions. His daughter  Eliza, being ten years the senior of her eldest brother, so soon as she  was competent, was employed as secretary in her father's office.    She was skilled in various kinds of needlework and home manufactures.  Two years in succession she drew the prize awarded by the committee on  manufactures, at the county fair, for the best manufactured leghorn.    When quite young she commenced writing for publication in various  journals, which she continued to do for several years, over assumed  signatures,--wishing to be useful as a writer, and yet unknown except  by intimate friends.    \"During the contest between Greece and Turkey,\" she says, \"I watched  with deep interest the events of the war, and after the terrible  destruction of Missolonghi, by the Turks, I wrote an article entitled  'The Fall of Missolonghi.' Soon after its publication, the deaths of  Adams and Jefferson occurred on the same memorable fourth of July, and  I was requested through the press, to write their requiem, to which I  responded, and found myself ushered into conspicuity. Subsequently I  was awarded eight volumes of 'Godey's Lady's Book,' for a first prize  poem published in one of the journals.\"    The classical reader will remember how the struggle between Greece and  Turkey stirred the soul of Byron. That immortal poet was not a saint  but he was a great patriot and fled to the help of Greece.    Precisely the same chord that was struck in the chivalrous mind of Lord  Byron was struck in the Hebraic soul of Eliza R. Snow. It was the chord  of the heroic and the antique.    Our Hebraic heroine is even more sensitive to the heroic and patriotic  than to the poetic,--at least she has most self-gratification in lofty  and patriotic themes.    \"That men are born poets,\" she continues, \"is a common adage. _I was  born a patriot,_--at least a warm feeling of patriotism inspired my  childish heart, and mingled in my earliest thoughts, as evinced in many  of the earliest productions of my pen. I can even now recollect how,  with beating pulse and strong emotion I listened, when but a small  child, to the tales of the revolution.    \"My grandfather on my mother's side, when fighting for the freedom of  our country, was taken prisoner by British troops, and confined in  a dreary cell, and so scantily fed that when his fellow-prisoner by  his side died from exhaustion, he reported him to the jailor as sick  in bed, in order to obtain the amount of food for both,--keeping him  covered in their blankets as long as he dared to remain with a decaying  body.    \"This, with many similar narratives of revolutionary sufferings"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54337"],[0,"Reminiscences of Joseph, the Prophet, and the Coming Forth of the Book of Mormon (#6)"],[1,"and lamentation did rend the air exceedingly.\"    A continuation of this lamentable slaughter, with weeping and howling,  was kept up for six successive days, till only thirty-two of the people  of Shiz and twenty-seven of Coriantumr's were left, and on the seventh  day Coriantumr with his twenty-seven retreated, which gave the opposing  King Shiz fresh courage. He said, \"I will slay Coriantumr or perish by  the sword,\" and indeed his words were fulfilled after a severe battle,  in which all were slain, excepting King Shiz, who had fallen faint and  weak, and Coriantumr, who leaned upon his sword to rest, after which he  smote off the head of Shiz and fell to the ground as if he was dead.  Here the history leaves this, the only survivor of those two mighty  armies, around this historic Hill Cumorah, thus bringing to pass the  words of the prophet Ether, who prophecied to King Coriantumr that  unless he and his people should repent, every one of them should be  slain except himself and he should live to see a strange people possess  the land and be buried by them. Now, in order to verify the prophet's  words, I will refer you to the book of Omni, Book of Mormon, which says:     \"And Coriantumr was discovered by the people of Zarahemla; and he   dwelt with them for the space of nine moons\" (months).    Coriantumr, weak, wounded and alone, had to wend his way about 3,000  miles to Zarahemla, where he remained until his death and was buried by  this strange people.    Thus ended two great nations around this historic hill, in fulfillment  of God's word, as found in the Book of Mormon, page 474:     \"Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it   [and this will apply to all people in every age] shall be free from   bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under heaven,   if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ. I   will forgive thee and thy brethren of their sins, but thou shalt not   sin any more, for ye shall remember that my spirit shall not always   strive with man; wherefore if ye will sin until ye are fully ripe, ye   shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.\"    This has been fulfilled to the very letter with both nations.    CHAPTER III.    The Angel that had been foretold would \"Fly through the midst of  Heaven, having the everlasting Gospel to Preach unto them that Dwell on  the Earth\" appears to Joseph Smith.--The Golden Plates are Given into  his Charge.    The memorable twenty-second day of September, 1827, was the day  appointed by the angel Moroni to meet Joseph Smith on the Hill Cumorah.  There he was to receive the gold plates, the breast-plate and the Urim  and Thummim. The accompanying shows Joseph grown to maturity, being no  longer a lad of tender years as when he received his first vision. He  now stands in his noble, dignified manhood, in the twenty-second year  of his age. Before being entrusted with those valuable plates it was  necessary that he should become experienced with regard to such sacred  matters. For more than four years previous to this event he had at  intervals met the angel and been instructed by him. This was during the  important period between boyhood and manhood, when the mind is easily  impressed. During all that time, he had not been permitted to take the  plates away.    The appointed time now having come, we see him receiving the treasure,  as pictured in the engraving. He is holding the book in his hands,  while the breast-plate rests on the edge of the stone box, with the  sword of Laban near by. The angel, holding the Urim and Thummim, is in  the act of delivering it unto Joseph, and while doing so charges him as  follows:     \"Now you have got the record into your own hands, and you are but a   young man: therefore, you will have to be watchful and faithful to   your trust, or you will be overpowered by wicked men; for they will   lay every plan and scheme possible to get it away from you; and if you   do not take heed continually, they will succeed. While it was in my   hands, I could keep it and no man had power to take it away; but now I   give it up to you. Beware, and look well to your ways, and you shall   have power to retain it, until the time for it to be translated.\"    In 1834 I first listened to this Prophet of God, who related this  vision he had been favored with. The honesty and power of his  expression carried conviction with it.    I will now introduce a few Bible quotations in order to prove that just  such an event as the one represented by the accompanying illustration  was to take place in the latter days. Zechariah in his 2nd chapter says:     \"And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another   angel went out to meet him.     \"And said unto him, run, speak to this  young man, saying, Jerusalem   shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men   and cattle therein.\"    In order to discover further the mind of God's inspired prophet, we  will turn to his 8th chapter, which reads as follows:     \"Again the word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying,     \"Thus saith the Lord of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great   jealousy. * * *     \"Thus saith the Lord; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the   midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth.     \"Thus saith the Lord of hosts, there shall yet old men and old women   dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his   hand for very age.     \"And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing   in the streets thereof.     \"* * * Behold I will save my people from the east country, and from   the west country;     \"And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of   Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.\"    Soon after the message of the angel to the young man Joseph, he, in  obedience to God's command, organized the church. In due time there  were Twelve Apostles, and he appointed two of those Apostles on a  mission to Jerusalem. Upon Mount Olivet, one of the apostles,--Orson  Hyde,--offered a dedicatory prayer unto God, the Eternal Father.    In that prayer he supplicated God to remember his promises made to  Father Abraham concerning this dry and barren land, and Abraham's seed  which should inhabit this thirsty country, and who had wandered as  strangers in a strange land. The land had become barren because of the  sins of those who, in their ignorance, crucified God's Only Begotten  Son, Jesus Christ. He further pleaded:     \"And as Jesus, thy Son, in his sorrowful and trying hours, cried,   'Lord, forgive them, they know not what they do!' so do thou, O God,   have mercy on them and let the promises of the prophets come up in   remembrance before thee. Be pleased, O Father, to send the rains on   these parched lands; and may the dews fall upon the hills and valleys,   that the land may again teem with plenty, and cities be built up unto   the Lord our God.\"    This is the substance of the supplication of the Apostle who dedicated  the land of Palestine. Since then the way is being prepared with a  railroad from the Mediterranean Sea to Jerusalem; and lo! the time has  come for God's mercy, as foretold by Isaiah, 40th chapter:     \"Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. Speak ye   comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is   accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of   the Lord's hand double for all her sins.\"    Joel, another of God's ancient prophets, prophecying of future events,  in 2nd chapter, says:     \"Fear not, O land; be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in   the Lord your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately,   and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and   the latter rain in the first month. And the floors shall be full of   wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil. * * * And ye   shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the Lord   your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you, and my people shall   never be ashamed.\"    Realizing that the words of the prophets Isaiah and Joel will have a  literal fulfillment, we can readily conceive of the way being thus  prepared for the support of the hosts that are soon to fill the streets  of Jerusalem; for without the early and the latter rains, this land,  for so many generations barren, could not be redeemed. Indeed, the  words of those who crucified the Savior, or who consented to his death,  are brought forcibly to the minds of Christians:     \"His blood be upon us and our children.\"_--Matt.27:25_    Because of their wicked desires, desolation has rested upon this land  which once flowed with milk and honey. But, thank God! a pardoning time  is being ushered in. The angel spoken of by Zechariah has come with the  glad tidings.    [Image: The Angel Moroni Delivering the Golden Plates to Joseph Smith.]    John, the Revelator, also, was permitted to behold an angel who had a  message to deliver. Who can truthfully say the angel he saw is not the  very one Zechariah said should speak to the young man?     \"And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having   the everlasting gospel [the Book of Mormon says it contains the   everlasting gospel] to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and   to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people; saying with   a loud voice, fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his   judgment is come; and worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the   sea, and the fountains of waters.\"_--Revelation, 14,6-7._    In Zechariah, 2nd chapter, 8th verse, it says:     \"Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for lo, I come, and I will   dwell in the midst of thee, saith the Lord. And many nations shall be   joined to the Lord in that day.\"    What day? The day in which the angel was to speak to the _young_ (not  old) man. In Zion there "]]]
