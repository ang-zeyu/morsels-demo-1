Hence Calvin, who differed so widely on some  points from the fully developed Lutheran creed, readily adopted and  subscribed it at Strasburg.--The _Apology_, or Vindication of the Augsburg  Confession, set forth, among others, the cardinal doctrine of the Lutheran  faith, namely, Justification by faith alone, with extraordinary power and  purity. Its full, lucid, and strictly scriptural character has never been  successfully controverted. For this very reason the Apology was rejected  by Papists, as it now is practically by Rationalists and others who depend  on human merit, and are unwilling to give all honor to the Saviour  alone.--The _Smalcald Articles_, which Luther prepared in order to set  forth the points on which no Protestant or Bible Christian could make any  concession to Popery, are also offensive to Papists, to Rationalists, and  to the unbelieving and impenitent generally, as they contain the pure  evangelical truth, which humbles man, while it exalts God.--_The Two  Catechisms (the Large and the Small)_ furnish materials for popular  instruction in revealed truth, which have never been equalled by other  manuals, in their adaptation to the object, their fulness, and their  purity. Hence, a friend of divine truth, like Arndt, who took so deep an  interest in the religious education of the young, could not do otherwise  than regard them as of inestimable value. An enemy of the truth would  naturally disavow them.--The _Formula of Concord_--the last of the series of  Lutheran Confessions of Faith, and the one which Arndt appears to have  prized most highly--was intended, as we have shown above, to determine  various important points involved in the controversies which had arisen in  the bosom of the Lutheran Church before or at the time when he was born.  The very circumstance that this Symbol was demanded by the exigencies of  the Church, demonstrates that the Augsburg Confession was _not originally  designed to be a full and complete confession of faith_, but only a  statement of points discussed during the infancy of the Reformation. While  it excludes every error which might dishonor God, and confirm the  impenitent sinner in his evil course, it completes the previous Symbols,  and forms with them an undivided and harmonious whole, exhibiting with  brilliancy, power, and spotless purity the Person of the God-Man, Jesus  Christ, and glorifies God alone. A confession of faith which so  unreservedly unveils the fearful character of Original Sin, while it so  fully explains and establishes the true doctrine of the Lord's Supper,  would naturally be unwelcome to an impenitent heart; whereas, the devout  Arndt found nothing in it but animating and heavenly truth. Hence he  desired to be regarded as simply an Evangelical Lutheran Christian,--an  adherent of the Formula of Concord.    ยง 26. Religion assumed an unusually attractive and beautiful form in  Arndt, and is strikingly shadowed forth in his \"True Christianity;\" this  work is an admirable portraiture of his inner man. He was naturally of a  grave, but not by any means of an unsocial or gloomy disposition; he would  not otherwise have been styled \"the Fenelon of Protestantism.\" Dr.  Wildenhahn, whose charming work (entitled _Johannes Arndt_) embodies  strictly accurate historical notices, and derives only subordinate matter,  such as incidents in domestic life, conversations, etc., from analogy and  a fruitful imagination, exhibits him in the true light, as an affectionate  husband, a cheerful companion, a generous and self-sacrificing friend of  the sick and the poor--in short, as a model in all the relations of life.  There is no exaggeration in this language. He possessed great firmness of  character; indeed, a truly heroic spirit dwelt in him. He manifested this  trait on many trying occasions--not only when he preferred poverty and  exile to a denial of a single Gospel truth or Lutheran usage, but also in  many other scenes of conflict. The ravages of the pestilence could not  alarm his heroic soul; the open and violent denunciations of enemies he  always encountered in the spirit of Him who said: \"If I have spoken evil,  bear witness of the evil; but if well, why smitest thou me?\" (John 18:23.)  There was a certain calmness or gentleness in his manner of treating his  enemies, which, combined with his earnestness and candor in repelling  their calumnies, invariably subdued them. Love--love, not to the amiable  and good, or to the poor and sorrowing alone, but also to his enemies--was  too often and too variously manifested, to leave the spectator in doubt  respecting its true source--a genuine faith in Christ, and deep, ardent  love to Him. In truth, it is here that the peculiar type of his religion  is seen; he lived more in heaven than on earth. The sacerdotal prayer of  Christ (John, Chap. 17) was an unfailing source of light, of hope, of  peace and joy to his soul. Expressions like these, \"As thou, Father, art  in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us\" (ver. 21)--\"I in  them, and thou in me, etc.\" (ver. 23), and language like that of Paul:  \"Christ in you, etc.\" (Col. 1:27), furnished him virtually with the  formula: \"Christ in me, and I in Christ.\" Such was his faith in Christ,  and such was his love to Him, that he was always calm and hopeful. Hence  features appeared in his religious character which his worldly-minded  contemporaries could not fully appreciate; they were formed by two  different series of Gospel doctrines, which cannot come in conflict, but  which relate to two entirely different objects--Christ, the Saviour, and  fallen man. No one more sincerely embraced the doctrine of Original Sin,  as held by the Lutheran Church, than Arndt did; of this his writings  furnish the evidence. His own searching self-examination, constantly  maintained in the light of Scripture, revealed to him the utter corruption  of his own heart by nature; he found nothing in himself but sin. He was  conscious that he could do nothing without Christ, and deeply felt that  grace--nothing but grace--could renew his nature, and save him. These  convictions induced him to insist with such earnestness, in his Four  Books, on the true and genuine repentance of the sinner. At the same time,  there was nothing like sternness, gloom, or despondency connected with his  sincere and profound self-abasement. For he received with equal strength  of faith another series of truths--he believed with all his heart that  \"after the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, not  by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy  he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy  Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;  that being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to  the hope of eternal life.\" Tit. 3:4-7. Here a new tide of emotions flowed  through his soul. Wonder, joy, gratitude, love, took possession of him.  His large heart was full of happiness that the lost could be found and  saved--that \"where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.\" Rom. 5:20.  And now, when these two distinct principles appear in him in their  practical union, the type of his religion is clearly developed. He was  grave and earnest, humble, and free from all confidence in himself, for he  was \"by nature a child of wrath.\" Eph. 2:3. But, on the other hand, God  had, in pity and in love, given him a Saviour, engrafted him in that  Saviour through Holy Baptism, bestowed on him the fulness of grace, and  invited him, as a repentant, believing, pardoned child of Adam, to enter  heaven. If sin abounded through the first Adam, grace did, through the  second Adam (1 Cor. 15:45), much more abound. His writings, therefore, now  assume a very cheerful character--_love_ is the prevailing theme. Nothing  morose appears in them--sorrow for sin and repentance--faith in Christ and  love to him, are his soul-inspiring themes, and a cheerful spirit, a sense  of fervent, joyful gratitude to God, a heavenly calm, pervade alike his  heart and its language as uttered in the \"True Christianity.\"    ยง 27. The essential features of vital godliness are always the same; yet  \"there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.\" 1 Cor. 12:4. Paul  insists on faith; John, on love. Luther's religion was, like that of  Arndt, earnest, and yet cheerful. Both were enabled by their personal  experience to understand the nature of these Christian virtues, and also  the distinction between them. Luther dwells with wonderful power on  _faith_. Arndt delights to speak of God's _love_. There is something very  beautiful in these different developments of true godliness in the  servants of Christ, while the influences of the same divine Spirit  controls them alike.    ยง 28. It would be an error to suppose that the whole world had risen up in  arms against Arndt, after he had assumed his position as an humble and  devout Christian. Vast numbers received his First Book on True  Christianity with gratitude and joy. It enlightened their minds; it  controlled the conscience; it diffused the warmth of life through their  souls; and they thanked God that such a book, so full of love, had been  given to the world. A comparatively small number of men rose up against  him. Certain individuals, such as his colleague, Denecke, a co-pastor of  the same congregation in Brunswick, were, no doubt, influenced by envy and  personal dislike. But others who opposed him, were by no means governed  solely by unworthy personal considerations. Some of them were so much  concerned about \"questions and strifes of words\" (1 Tim. 6:4), that they  overlooked and misconceived the heavenly-mindedness of Arndt. Others, who  did him injustice, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34781"],[0,"An Australian Bird Book: A Pocket Book for Field Use (#6)"],[1,"ilvery-gray; upper dark-gray;      crest rust-red; eyes orange; f., sim.

Nl.    ====    The birds of Order V. are amongst the successes in the struggle  for existence, for they are found the world over.    The Landrailor Corn-Crake, the Little Crake, Spotted Crake, Moor-Hen,  Purple Gallinule, and the lobed-toed Coot, of other countries, are  represented by similar birds here.    They are largely swamp-dwellers, and conditions about swamps  apparently do not vary much from continent to continent. There is a  full supply of vegetable and animal food, and there is good shelter  in the thick reed-beds. The smaller members of the family are seldom  seen, for they skulk amongst the reeds, and seldom show themselves.    Many of these birds are long-toed, and are beautifully adapted for  life about the soft mud and floating vegetation of lagoons and swamps.  Though the feet are not webbed, several of these swamp-dwellers swim  well. Thus the Little Crake is an expert swimmer and diver.    There is one Australian bird not represented in other countries.  This is the handsome, bantam-like Black-tailed Native-Hen. At long  intervals the birds appear in thousands, and, being largely vegetable  feeders, they have sometimes done considerable damage to crops.    During one such irruption in 1846, the birds invaded the streets of  Adelaide. Others invaded the Geraldton district, and even reached  Perth in 1886. Northern Victoria was visited in 1909.    Some of the members of this group are known to all; indeed, when you  have finished reading this lecture, I expect to have created in your  mind an idea that bird study is very simple--that you know at least  one of each of the groups of birds. One further advantage of bird  study is that so few birds are found in any district. Thus, only 880  birds have ever been recorded from Australia, whereas there are over  9,000 kinds of native flowering plants, not to mention non-flowering  plants. In very few districts could a list of 100 different kinds of  birds be compiled in one year.    Again, while it is impossible to talk popularly of native plants,  because they have no common names, that does not apply to birds, for  bird-lovers have given a simple name to each bird. Even children,  therefore, can talk definitely and exactly about the different kinds.  This is a great advantage. Again, as birds are living, moving, loving,  and beautiful animals, they have always been favorite objects of  study, and so we know more about them than about any other division of  the animal kingdom. Thus you will, I hope, find that you know far more  about the subject than you at first thought.    ====      [Page 18b]        ORDER V.--RALLIFORMES.        F. 22.

Bird names often reflect some habit, e.g.,  Scratchers, Cooers. So Grebes are often called Divers. But the Divers  of the ornithologist are Northern Hemisphere birds, placed in the next  family (25).    There is a widespread tradition to the effect that Grebes wait for the  flash of the cap, and then dive before the bullet can reach them. They  are, indeed, remarkably active in the water, but are absurd on land.  Their legs are set so far back that it is almost impossible for them  to walk. Their toes are not webbed, but are broadly lobed.    The Great Crested Grebe is identical with the British bird, for it is  found all through the Eastern Hemisphere.    This is a remarkable distribution, when we consider that the bird,  by reason of its very small wings, is a poor flyer, and is"]]]
