Training a dog to hunt young wolves is a  harder task, and unless your dog is born for it, you will fail to  make anything like a first class dog out of him. Almost any good fox  dog will hunt old wolves, but very few will hunt pups, and my  experience has been that a bitch will hunt quicker than a dog. There  are a great many dogs that will trail and hunt a wolf to a finish,  but will pay no attention to the pups whatever; but if you succeed in  finding one that is inclined to hunt them, remember that practice  makes perfect.    Speaking of brush wolves: The kind of dog needed is a good ranger,  extra good cold trailer and an everlasting stayer. Then if he will  only run a short distance after starting the wolf and come back and  hunt the pups, and then bark at them when found, you have a good,  valuable dog. There are plenty of dogs that will hunt and trail  wolves all right, but very few that will hunt the pups.    Sometimes when your dog trails in near the pups you will get a fight,  and sometimes they will jump out and run for it. Sometimes if the  pups are quite young you will find the mother in with them and for  the first few days she will be found near them, but as they grow  older she will be found farther away.    A Minnesota wolfer who averages 35 wolves a year pins his faith in  the long eared variety of hounds, with features of strength,  endurance, good tonguers and stayers.    From another source we are advised that the best dogs ever for  coyotes, are part English blue and Russian stag. English blue are  very fast and the stag are long winded and have the grit to make a  good fight.    Another admired and capable dog is the one-half Scotch stag hound and  one-half grey hound.    A Wisconsin hunter writes that the best breed to catch and kill  coyotes are one-half shepherd and one-half hound. They are faster  than a hound and trail just as well on a hot trail.    Another fast breed for coyotes is a one-fourth English bull,  one-fourth blood hound and one-half fox hound.      [Illustration: Typical Western Wolf Hounds.]    A Kansas hunter contributes some first hand discussion of wolf  hunting as follows: I have been hunting wolves with dogs for eight or  nine years and have caught my share. I only hunt in spring and late  in fall, but any time is good when you can find them. But don't take  your dogs out in summer, as it will be sure to be the time when you  will find a hard race, and there is where you will hurt some of your  best dogs. I use a pack of from three to five, but the more the  better.    I have tried most all kinds of dogs and have found a cross with stag  hound and English greyhound suits me the best. I don't have any use  for a full blood English greyhound--they cannot stand the cold  weather and are too easily hurt in a fight.    I want a dog that will weigh 75 pounds, with long legs and short back  so he can gather himself up quickly. I don't think foxhounds are any  good for wolves. I have seen thirty-five of them start after the same  wolf, in good weather and four hours afterward there were only two,  the smallest of the pack, still in the race. I have no doubt but that  they could have taken the wolf several times in the race, but all  they could do was to bark.    I will not say a full blood stag hound is not all right, in a level,  unobstructed country, but in many parts of the country many large  dogs would not be able to get thru the fences or over the rough  ground with the ease that the smaller ones do.    I have never seen the big dog that could catch and kill a wolf by  himself. I have killed them with two, but would rather have four or  five.    I always hunt on a horse, and they should be the best of horses, well  broken and not afraid of wire. I never carry a gun of any kind, but  always have a hammer, and if I want to succor the dogs in the race, I  will ride up to the dogs and kill the wolf for them.    THE IRISH WOLFHOUND.    The Irish wolfhound of history is no more, the breed having become  extinct years ago. There has been a determined effort, however, to  approximate him with a present day breed. The modern Irish wolfhound  is a cross between the Scottish deerhound and the Great Dane. Other  combinations have also been tried, with more or less good effect.    According to the idea of the American-Irish Wolfhound Club, the Irish  wolfhound should be \"not quite so heavy or massive as the Great Dane,  but more so than the deerhound, which in general type be should  resemble. Of great size and commanding appearance, very muscular,  strongly though gracefully built; movements easy and active, head and  neck carried high; the tail carried with an upward sweep, with a  slight curve toward the extremity.    The minimum height and weight of dogs should be 31 inches and 120  pounds; bitches 28 inches and 90 pounds. Anything below this should  be debarred from competition. Great size, including height and  shoulder and proportionate length of body is the desideratum to be  aimed at, and it is desired to firmly establish a race that shall  average from 32 to 34 inches in dogs, showing the requisite power,  activity, courage and symmetry.\"    \"The coat should be rough and hard on body, legs and head; especially  wiry and long over the eyes and under the jaws. The recognized colors  are gray, brindle, red, black, pure white, fawn or any color that  appears in the deerhound.\"    THE RUSSIAN WOLFHOUND.    The Russian wolfhound has a reputation for being a most capable  wolf-catcher in his native country, but so far the pure bred hound of  that family has not held his own with the American wolf. He has the  speed and capacity for catching the wolf, but is unable to cope with  him or detain him long enough for the hunter to arrive. Admirers of  the dog say he lacks training and adaption and that he will with a  generation or two of careful training and practice become the most  available dog for the purpose.      [Illustration: Termination of a Successful Chase.]    Others get good results by crossing in some fiercer and stronger  blood.    The Russian Wolfer has somewhat the clean cut appearance of the  greyhound, though more stockily built, and has a long, silky coat of  wavy or curly hair.    \"In general appearance\" says an authority, \"he is an elegant,  graceful aristocrat among dogs, possessing courage and combining  great muscular power with extreme speed, weighing from 75 to 105  pounds.\"      [Illustration: Good Dogs Make Good Luck.]        CHAPTER VII.    TRAINING--FOR SQUIRRELS AND RABBITS.    Here is my way for training squirrel and coon hounds, which I think  is best, writes a Texas Hunter. First, select good healthy pups,  raise them up friendly and don't whip or cow them in any way until  about ten or twelve months old, for if pups get cowed when young they  will never get over it. When about ten months old, take them out  hunting with one or two squirrel dogs and then when the old dogs tree  in small trees or any place where you can make them jump out, jump  the squirrel out and get your pups after them.    Then if the squirrel gets up another tree your pups will bark up the  tree at him. Then when they bark well up the tree at the squirrel,  pet, sick and yell to let the pups know that you are trying to help  them catch the squirrel. Keep jumping the squirrel out until they  catch him, and if they don't catch him and it gets away up a big tree  where you can't jump him, then shoot him and they will wool him when  he falls out.    Clean the squirrel and give the pups some of it to eat, and you won't  be but a few times out hunting squirrels and jumping them out for the  pups and trying to help them catch the squirrel until they will start  out hunting and treeing squirrels as good as any old dog. If the dogs  won't bark up the tree when you get through all of this and they see  the squirrel run back up the tree, you might as well kill them or  take them and run deer, for they will never make tree dogs.    The following directions for perfecting the rabbit dog, are from the  pen of an experienced and successful Ohio hunter.    Get your pup some day while young, if possible, keep him by you, and  when you see a sparrow or something alive, shoot it, pick it up and  show him what you shot at; do this at home. Shoot all you please  while he is young, so when you go hunting with him and shoot at game  he won't be afraid and make a bee line for home.    Most dogs will soon take a liking to guns. Now to training a beagle  dog to be a good one on rabbits, I warn you never to take another dog  along, but for a common hound you may use your own way.    I have seen good beagle dogs spoiled by other dogs. Now, some frosty  morning take your pup to where you most think there are rabbits;  scare one out, and then if he is not near, give three good sharp  whistles which you ought to keep as your signal for him to come. If  you train your pup to a regular code of whistles, he will know what  you want. So here is a good code, which if kept in rule, will become  very handy. When you have scared up game let three sharp whistles be  the calling; if you only want him to come to go another way, give  three long ones. Motion your hand in what direction you want to go  and he will soon learn to understand.    I have often let the dog decide the way to go. Now to go back to the  old subject, when he comes you must be all excited and showing him  that you are greatly in need of him. Then show him three of four  places where the rabbit hopped; when he gets a start you go and stand  where you most think he will come around, but again I warn you never  to jump and run away while your pup is near enough to see or even  hear you, for if you do, he will leave the track and follow you.  Also, you will do a fine piece of work to shoot the first rabbit he  brings"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34294"],[0,"Birds Illustrated (#6)"],[1,"ground, usually called a scratching ground, where the males  assemble at the early dawn, to vie with each other in carnage and  pompous display, uttering at the same time their love call, a loud,  booming noise. As soon as this is heard by the hen birds desirous of  mating, they quietly appear, squat upon the ground, apparently  indifferent observers, until claimed by victorious rivals, whom they  gladly accept, and whose caresses they receive. Audubon states that  the vanquished and victors alike leave the grounds to search for the  females, but he omits to state that many are present, and mate upon the  \"scratching grounds.\"    The nest of the Prairie Hen is placed on the ground in the thick prairie  grass and at the foot of bushes when the earth is barren; a hollow is  scratched in the soil, and sparingly lined with grasses and a few  feathers. There are from eight to twelve eggs, tawny brown, sometimes  with an olive hue and occasionally sprinkled with brown.    During the years 1869 and 1870, while the writer was living in  southwestern Kansas, which was then the far west, Prairie Chickens as  they were called there, were so numerous that they were rarely used for  food by the inhabitants, and as there was then no readily accessible  market the birds were slaughtered for wanton sport.

BY ELANORA KINSLEY MARBLE.      The next day Mrs. Jenny retired into the tin pot, and later, when Mr.  Wren peeped in, lo! an egg, all spotted with red and brown, lay upon the  soft lining of the nest.    \"It's quite the prettiest thing in the world,\" proudly said Mr. Wren.  \"Why, my dear, I don't believe your cousin, Mrs. John Wren, ever laid  one like it. It seems to me those spots upon the shell are very  remarkable. I shouldn't be surprised if the bird hatched from that shell  will make a name for himself in bird-land some day, I really shouldn't.\"    \"You foolish fellow,\" laughed Mrs. Wren, playfully pecking him with her  bill, \"if you were a Goose your Goslings, in your eyes, would all be  Swans. That's what I heard our landlady say to her husband last night,  out on the porch, when he wondered which one of his boys would be  president of the United States.\"    Mr. Wren chuckled in a truly papa-like manner and pecked her bill in  return, then fairly bubbling over with happiness flew to a neighboring  limb, and burst into such a merry roundelay, one note tumbling over  another in Wren fashion, that every member of the household came out to  hear and see.    \"There he is,\" cried Pierre, as Mrs. Wren left her nest and flew over  beside him, \"with tail down and head up, singing as though he were mad  with joy.\"    \"Such a rapturous song,\" said mamma. \"It reminds me of two almost  forgotten lines:        'Brown Wren, from out whose swelling throat      Unstinted joys of music float.'    \"How well we are repaid for the litter they made, are we not?\"    \"And sure, mum,\" said Bridget, whose big heart had also been touched  by the sweet song, \"it's glad I am, for sure, that I wasn't afther  dispossessin' your tinents. It's innocent craythurs they be, God bless  'em, a harmin' ov no wan. Sthill--\"    \"Well,\" queried her mistress, as Bridget paused.    \"Sthill, mum, I do be afther wonderin' if the tin pot had been a hangin'  under the front porch instead of the back, would ye's been after takin'  the litter so philosophyky like as ye have, mum, to be sure.\"    The mistress looked at Bridget and laughingly shook her head.    \"That's a pretty hard nut to crack, Bridget,\" said she. \"Under those  conditions I am afraid I----\" What ever admission she was going to make  was cut short by a burst of laughter from the children.    \"Look at him, mamma, just look at him,\" they cried, pointing to Mr.  Wren, who, too happy to keep still had flown to the gable at the  extremity of the ridge-pole of the house, and after a gush of song, to  express his happiness was jerking himself along the ridge-pole in a  truly funny fashion. From thence he flew into the lower branches of a  neighboring tree, singing and chattering, and whisking himself in and  out of the foliage: then back to the roof again, and from roof to tree.    \"I know what makes him so happy,\" announced Henry, who, standing upon a  chair, had peeped into the nest. \"There's a dear little egg in here.  Hurrah for Mrs. Wren!\"    \"Do not touch it,\" commanded mamma, \"but each one of us will take a peep  in turn.\"    Mrs. Wren's bead-like eyes had taken in the whole proceeding, and with  fluttering wings she stood on a shrub level with the porch and gave  voice to her motherly anxiety and anger.    \"_Dee, dee, dee_,\" she shrilly cried, fluttering her little wings, which  in bird language means, \"oh dear, oh dear, what shall I do?\"    Her cries of distress were heard by Mr. Wren, and with all haste he flew  down beside her.    \"What is it?\" cried he, very nearly out of breath from his late  exertions. \"Has that rascally Mr. Jay----\"    \"No, no!\" she interrupted, wringing her sharp little toes, \"It's not Mr.  Jay this time, Mr. Wren. It's the family over there, _our_ family,  robbing our nest of its one little egg.\"    \"Pooh! nonsense!\" coolly said Mr. Wren, taking one long breath of  relief. \"Why, my dear, you nearly frighten me to death. You know, or  _ought_ to know by this time, that our landlord's family have been  taught not to do such things. Besides you yourself admit them to be  exceptionally good children and good children never rob nests. Fie, I'm  ashamed of you. Really my heart flew to my bill when I heard your call  of distress.\"    Mrs. Wren, whose fears were quite allayed by this time, looked at her  mate scornfully.    \"Oh!\" said she, with fine sarcasm, \"your heart flew into your bill  did it? Well, let me say, Mr. Wren, that if it had been my mother in  distress, father at the first note of warning, would have flown to her  assistance with his heart in his _claws_. He kept them well sharpened  for just such occasions, and woe to any enemy _he_ found prowling about  his premises.\"    \"Oh, indeed!\" said Mr. Wren, \"I presume he would have attacked Bridget  over there, and the whole family. To hear you talk, Mrs. Wren, one would  think your father was a whole host in himself.\"    \"And so he was,\" said she, loftily, \"I have seen him attack a _Bluebird_  and a _Martin_ at the same time and put them both to flight. An _Owl_  had no terrors for him, and as for squirrels, why----\" Mrs. Wren raised  her wings and shrugged her shoulders in a very Frenchy and wholly  contemptuous manner.    \"I'm a peace-loving sort of a fellow, that you know, Mrs. Wren,  deploring the reputation our tribe has so justly earned for fighting,  and scolding, and jeering at everything and everybody. Indeed they go so  far as to say we trust no one, not even our kindred. But mark me, Mrs.  Wren, mark me, I say! Should any rascally Jay, neighbor or not, ever  dare approach that tin pot over yonder, or ever alight on the roof of  the porch, I'll, I'll----\" Mr. Wren fairly snorted in his anger, and  standing on one foot, doubled up the toes of the other and struck it  defiantly at the imaginary foe.    \"Oh, I dare say!\" tauntingly said Mrs. Wren, \"you are the sort of fellow  that I heard little Dorothy reading about the other day. You would fight  and run away, Mr. Wren, that you might live to fight another day.\"    Mr. Wren lifted one foot and scratched himself meditatively behind the  ear.    \"Good, _very_ good, indeed, my dear! It must have been a pretty wise  chap that wrote that.\" And Mr. Wren, who seemed to find the idea very  amusing, laughed until the tears stood in his eyes.    Mrs. Wren smoothed her ruffled feathers and smiled too.    \"Tut, tut, Jenny,\" said the good-natured fellow, \"what is the use of us  newly married folk quarreling in this fashion. Think how joyous we were  less than one short hour ago. Come, my dear, the family have all left  the porch, save Emmett. Let us fly over there and take a look at our  treasure.\" And Mrs. Wren, entirely restored to good humor, flirted her  tail over her back, hopped about a little in a coquettish manner, then  spread her wings, and off they flew together.    Mrs. Wren the next day deposited another egg, and the next, and the  next, till six little speckled beauties lay huddled together in the cosy  nest.    \"Exactly the number of our landlord's family,\" said she, fluffing her  feathers and gathering the eggs under her in that truly delightful  fashion common to all mother birds. \"I am so glad. I was greatly puzzled  to know what names we should have given the babies had there been more  than six.\"    \"I hadn't thought of that,\" admitted Mr. Wren, who in his joy had been  treating his mate to one of his fine wooing songs, and at length coaxed  her from the nest, \"but I dare say we would have named them after some  of our relatives.\"    \"Why, of course,\" assented Mrs. Wren, \"I certainly would have named one  after my dear, brave papa. Mrs. John Wren says that boys named after a  great personage generally develop all the qualities of that person.\"    \"Oh, indeed!\" sniffed Mr. Wren, \"that was the reason she named one of  her numerous brood last year after our rascally neighbor, Mr. Jay, I  presume. Certainly the youngster turned out as great a rascal as the one  he was named after.\"    Mrs. Wren's head feathers stood on end at once.    \"For the life of me,\" she said tartly, \"I cannot see why you always fly  into a passion, Mr. Wren, whenever I mention dear papa, or Mrs. John, or  in fact _any_ of my relatives. Indeed--but sh-sh! There's one of our  neighbors coming this way. I verily believe it is, oh yes, it is, it  _is_----\" and Mrs. Wren wrung her toes, and cried _cheet, cheet, cheet_,  and _dee, dee, dee_! in a truly anxious and alarming manner.    [TO"]]]
