The main object of the work  being to inform his countrymen who propose emigration, of the true  state of the most available branches of industry in this country, and  prevent on their part undue anticipation or disappointment, even these  items cannot be deemed out of place. Cherishing an enthusiastic  admiration of our country, and better informed in all probability in  the branches of which he treats than any foreigner who has before  ventured upon the subject, it is not astonishing that he should have  produced a work which not only fully answers the object intended, but  in a faithful translation would doubtless be extensively read by our  own countrymen.    The reader will find in this book many _little_ traits of our domestic  life, which, commonplace though they be, are not unattractive when  thus reflected back on us, mirror-like, from another land. Take for  example the following account of confectioners:         \"All men are more or less fond of sweet food and dainties,       and the wealthier a people may be, and consequently in more       fit condition to add such luxuries to the necessaries of       life, the greater will be its consumption of sugar. If we       compare the sugar consumption of England with that of       Germany, we find the first consumes a far greater quantity       per head than the latter.         \"And in this respect the Americans are in no wise behind the       English, since they not only at least twice a day drink       either tea or coffee, which they abundantly sweeten,       enjoying therewith vast quantities of preserved fruits, and       every variety of cakes, but they have universally a       remarkable appetite for sweets, which from childhood up is       nourished with all sorts of confectionery. And this appetite       is very generally retained even to an advanced age, so that       all the _cents_ of the children, and many of the dollars of       those more advanced in life, go to the _candy-shops_ and       _confectioneries_. Add to this the numerous balls,       marriages, and other festive occasions, particularly the       parties in private houses, at which pyramids, temples, and       other architectural and artistic works, founded on rocks of       candied sugar, and bonsbons, are never wanting, we can       readily imagine that in this country the confectioner's       trade is a flourishing and brilliant business.         \"The Americans are, as is well known, universally a       remarkably hospitable people, not only frequently       entertaining guests in their homes, but also holding it as       an established point of _bon ton_, to give one or two       parties annually, to which _all_ their friends are invited.       The evening is then spent with music and dancing, concluded       with an extremely elegant (_hochst elegant_) supper, at       which the gentlemen wisely stick to the more substantial       viands and champagne, but where abundance of sugar-work for       the ladies is never wanting.         \"And since no family will be surpassed by another, the most       incredible extravagance not infrequently results from this       unfortunate spirit of rivalry. Confectionery is often       brought for a certain party expressly from France, fresh       fruits from the West Indies, and the stairways and rooms are       adorned with the most exquisite flowers which Europe can       yield, while the guests are served on costly porcelain and       massive plate. In a word, the greatest imaginable expense is       lavished on these festive occasions, which prevail in every       class of society, and in none--be their degree what it       may--are sugared sweets wanting: the poorer confining       themselves, it is true, to such dainties as are the       production of the country, excepting indeed a few bottles of       champagne, which latter is absolutely indispensable.         \"I have deemed it necessary to touch upon these       extravagances of American life, that I might show that while       on the one hand an expert confectioner may readily find       employment during the season, on the other that mere skill       and industry are by no means sufficient of themselves to       support an establishment grounded on credit.         \"Nearly all the small shopkeepers, fruit-dealers, and       bar-keepers, sell candy and sugar-cakes, which they either       prepare themselves or obtain from confectioners who not only       carry on a wholesale business, _but even send large       quantities of their products to the country dealers_. In       Philadelphia, warm cakes are carried about for sale in the       streets,[1] the bearers thereof announcing their presence by       the sound of a bell. French confectioners have already done       much in this country toward improving the public taste, and       excellent _bonsbons a la francaise_ are now actually       manufactured here, though we must admit that in the country       there is a great consumption of confectionery and cakes by       no means of a very good quality. In these regions a taste       for '_horses_' (which are of cake greatly resembling       gingerbread and made in the form of a horse) universally       predominates, and not only children but even adults select       these as a favorite dainty. It is no unusual spectacle to       behold in the northern states an entire court--judge, jury,       and lawyers--regaling themselves during an important trial       on horse-cakes!\"    Whether Herr Fleischmann received this legal anecdote on hearsay, or  whether his German soul was actually startled by stumbling upon such  an extraordinary legal spectacle, we will not here inquire. In Germany  the favorite dainty in this line is a _pretzel_, or carnival cake, in  the form of a two-headed serpent, which antiquaries declare to be of  oriental origin, and to conceal divers horrific mysteries of deeply  metaphysical import. From the solemnity of tone with which Herr  Fleischmann imparts this horse-cake story, we are half inclined to  suspect that he inferred that a great ethical mystery, in some way  connected with the administration of justice in America, might thus be  conveyed.    Under the head of spirit distilleries our author enters into a _naif_  and enthusiastic defence of good brandy, but still highly approves of  the American custom of substituting coffee for grog in merchant  vessels, on which he remarks that it is not allowed to soldiers or  sailors to bring spirits into the forts or ships. \"But they are so  extravagantly fond of liquor as to invent every imaginable method of  evading the regulation. I have been told,\" he says, \"by persons of the  highest credibility that during the night whisky is not unfrequently  brought to the vicinity of military stations, and that the sentinels,  after filling the barrels of their muskets therewith, bring it into  the 'watch-room,' and divide the _loading_ with their comrades.\"    After remarking the melancholy fact, which the strictest examination  would, we fear confirm, in a still higher degree, that the  sewing-girls employed in our umbrella factories, tailor  establishments, &c., are very inadequately paid, he makes a statement  which is, however, glaringly false, that among these poor girls  corruption of manners prevails to a degree unknown in any country of  Europe, save indeed \"merry England.\" Without being familiar with such  statistics, we are on the contrary firmly convinced that though  females in these employments are _not_ so well paid even as in  Germany, there is no country on the face of the earth--most certainly  not in Bavaria, Austria, or Prussia, where the standard of morals is  in this respect so high as in our own. There are a thousand  correlative facts in the state of society in our country which confirm  our assertion. This opinion of our author's is, however, slightly at  variance, as far as appearance is concerned, with a part of the  following good advice to the more beautiful portion of his fair young  countrywomen, who propose repairing to this country for the sake of  catching husbands:         \"And I deem this a fit place to give them a warning, which I       have before often repeated, namely, that these lovely       beings, when they forsake their homes, also leave behind       them their fantastic national dress. In this country long       dresses are worn--and not merely frocks which barely reach       the knee, as is usual in several parts of Germany. The same       may be applied to their head-dresses, which are not       unfrequently so eccentric as to give their wearers the       appearance of having escaped from a lunatic asylum. On which       account, I beg my _ladies_, or any women who design       emigrating to this land of equality, to buy themselves       French bonnets,[2] or a similar style of head covering, but       in no instance to run bareheaded about the streets, which is       here remarkably unpopular, since neither widow, wife, nor       maiden, ever appears in the public way without hat or       bonnet. And I moreover beg of them, on their first arrival       in the populous cities, to restrain their manifestations of       affection to the house, where walls are the only witnesses,       _and not to permit their lovers, fiancees, or husbands, to       clasp them about the waist, and lead them in this close       embrace about the streets_, since this would be for       Americans a scandalous spectacle. I will not assert that the       American is incapable of tender feeling, but he at least       observes decency in the public streets, and _apropos_ of       this, I would further remark, that in this country the wife       or maiden invariably walks by the side of her male       companion, and never follows after him in _Indian"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36496"],[0,"On the cattle plague: or, Contagious typhus in horned cattle. Its history, (#6)"],[1,"physicians, on their side conscious of the duty which devolves upon  them in such seasons of calamity, instead of resting satisfied with  recommending remedies, betook themselves boldly to the work, and studied  the disease experimentally in respect to its propagation and prevention.    Thus, for instance, certain Dutch physicians, in 1754, wishing to know  whether the morbid matter would transmit the disease by inoculation,  made incisions in the necks of some oxen, cows and calves, inserting in  the wound a little tow saturated with the morbid secretions discharged  from the eyes and nostrils. This direct inoculation having been  practised on seventeen animals, transmitted the disease to them all in  the course of a few days.    The English physicians having been made acquainted with these  experiments, applied them to a more practical purpose, no longer to  discover whether the disease could thus be transmitted (for that had  been proved), but to find out (what was far more important) whether this  fearful distemper could be prevented and kept off.    Malcolm Flemming, in 1755, merely suggested the idea of inoculation as a  preventive means, without proceeding to a course of experiments to  ratify his opinion. He intimates his notion in the following terms:--    \"I apprehend that inoculation will stand the better chance of bringing  on the distemper, if the subject it is performed on is as young as  safety will permit, the vessels being then most absorbent, and the  animal economy most easily put into disorder.    \"But even in case the inoculation of calves should be found so  successful as universally to prevail, the method I recommend will not be  altogether useless; for, by being properly modelled and adapted to  circumstances, it may, I am persuaded, prevent contagion, and likewise  act as a preparative in any epidemical affection of the inflammatory  kind, not only in horned cattle, but likewise in all other quadrupeds  that civil society may think worthy of preservation, and even in the  human species.\"    Layard, in 1757, devotes the seventh chapter of his work, \"The Means to  prevent the Infection,\" to the consideration of the preventive  treatment, in which he says:--    \"No one will think of bringing the infection into any place free from  it, merely for the sake of inoculating their cattle; but if the  contagious distemper be in the neighbourhood of a herd, or break out so  as to endanger the stock, the grazier or farmer may, by inoculating his  cattle, with proper precautions, at least secure his stock, since he can  house them before they fall sick, prepare them, and have due care taken,  knowing the course of the distemper.    \"Sir William St. Quintin, the Rev. Dr. Fountayne, Dean of York, and  other gentlemen have succeeded in inoculation: in Holland it has both  failed and succeeded. These gentlemen all inoculated with matter taken  from the running of the mouth, nose, or eyes. Professor Swenke mentions  that the beast from which he took the matter was recovering from the  distemper. A circumstance to be attended to is this:--had matter been  taken after the crisis, from a tumour, boil, pimple, or scab, either on  the back near the spine, or on the legs, the pus would have proved much  more elaborated, subtle, and infecting than that which, flowing with the  mucus of the nose, must necessarily be, in some degree, sheathed by this  glutinous excretion, though I am well aware how putrid and acrid it is  rendered by the disease.    \"That nothing may be omitted which in any shape can contribute to the  success of inoculation, due attention should be paid to the constitution  and state of the beast, no less in this practice on the cattle than on  the human species. Undoubtedly the young, healthy, and strong bid fairer  for a good issue than the old, sickly, and feeble; each of these  different constitutions demand a particular treatment, even in the  method of preparation; and however trifling it may seem to many--the  urging a necessity of preparation--I will venture to affirm that I have  seen excellent effects arising from a rational preparation, and fatal  events from want of preparation. I have likewise been witness of  unfavourable turns, merely from an injudicious preparation.    \"The beasts which are sanguine require moderate bleeding; those that  have but a small share of blood must have none drawn. The strong must,  besides moderate bleeding and purging, be kept on light diet, and their  body kept open. Thus, scalded bran, mixed with their hay and chaff, will  cool them. The weakly, and such as are inclined to scour, must be kept  on dry fodder, and have peas and beans given them to strengthen them. A  mess of malt, or a quart of warm ale, with a few spices, will be very  suitable for them.    \"Whatever diseases the cattle may be affected with, if time will permit,  they are first to be removed.    \"The cattle to be inoculated are first to be well washed, rubbed dry,  and then curried, to remove all the filth from the hair and skin. Then  they are to be placed in a spacious barn or stable, where the air is  temperate and no cold can come to them. There they are to be prepared  according to the direction already given, foddered with good sweet hay,  and watered with clear spring water; and if the distemper be not near,  they may be turned out into the air, near the barn or stable, and may  stay there a few hours in the middle of the day.    \"When it appears that the cattle are in perfect health, free from any  infection or disease, brisk and lively, neither costive nor scouring,  and chewing their cud, then the operation may be safely undertaken, and  henceforth they must be confined to the barn.    \"Since there is observed to follow the greatest flow of the contagious  and putrid particles separated from the blood, wherever the infectious  matter makes an impression at first, particular care must be taken not  to inoculate near such vital parts as the heart and lungs, nor near the  womb, if a cow with calf be inoculated; for, though rowels are properly  applied in the dewlaps to draw off the pestilential humour from the  breast, and in other cases beasts are frequently rowelled in the  flanks,--yet, in this operation, as matter is inserted by these channels  into the neighbouring vessels, those vital parts, or the womb, might  become the chief seat of the disease, and the event prove fatal.    \"To prevent such accidents, human beings have been inoculated on the  arms and legs, and now-a-days the arms are found sufficient. I would  recommend that the cattle should be inoculated about the middle of the  shoulders or buttocks, on both sides, to have the benefit of two drains.  The skin is to be cut lengthways two inches, deep enough for the blood  to start, but not to bleed much. In this incision is to be put a dossil  or pledget of tow, dipped in the matter of a boil full ripe, opened in  the back of a young calf recovering from the distemper. It may not be  amiss to stitch up the wound, to keep the tow in, and let it remain  forty-eight hours. Then the stitches are to be cut, the tow taken out,  and the wound dressed with yellow basilicum ointment, or one made with  turpentine and yolk of egg, spread on pledgets of tow. These dressings  are to be continued during the whole illness, and till after the  recovery of the beast, to promote the discharge; and then the wound may  be healed with the cerate of lapis calaminaris, or any other.    \"On the third day after inoculation, the discolouring of the wound,  whose lips appear grey and swollen, will be a sign that the inoculation  has succeeded; but the beasts, as Professor Swenke informs us, did not  fall ill till the sixth day, which answers exactly to the observations  daily made in the inoculating of children. Yet the Professor adds that  on the third day a costiveness came on, which was removed by giving each  calf three ounces of Epsom salts.    \"No sooner do the symptoms of heaviness and stupidity appear than the  beasts must have a light covering thrown over them, and at night  fastened loosely. They must be rubbed morning and evening, and curried,  till the boils begin to rise; warm hay-water and vinegar-whey must be  given plentifully. Should the beasts require more nourishment, dry meat,  such as cut hay, with a little bran, may be offered. I should be very  cautious in giving milk-pottage, even after the boils and pimples had  all come out, for fear of bringing on a scouring. However, this caution  is proper, that whenever milk-pottage be given, the vinegar-whey is to  be omitted for obvious reasons. In cases of accident, the same attention  is to be observed in the disease by inoculation as in the natural way,  and the medicines recommended are the same I would use; but by  inoculation there seldom is a call for any, so favourably does the  distemper proceed through its several stages.    \"The crisis being over, it will be proper to purge the cattle, to air  them by degrees, and to have the same regard in the management of them  as is laid down in the chapter on the method of cure.\"    Such are the recommendations which Layard has prescribed for those who  have to practise inoculation as a preventive treatment; it would be  difficult to offer an example of greater prudence or precision.    A certain number of oxen were, by means of this inoculation, protected  against the attack of the cattle disease; and this mode of treatment  was, as we shall afterwards explain, adopted in Russia. Unfortunately,  this rational and preventive treatment was discovered only at the end of  the epizootia, when already upwards of six millions of horned cattle had  fallen a sacrifice to the contagious fever.    _Curative Means._--When the first course of the disease had left no  doubt of the attack, the sick animal was subjected to an appropriate  diet, and restricted to liquids either as medicinal decoctions, or as  alimentary beverages.
