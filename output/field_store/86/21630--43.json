He was  to sit in the main office, which was in the third story and looked out  upon a large street. Every fifteen minutes he must take a lantern and  patrol the entire building above the first floor, which was occupied  by another firm, furniture dealers and manufacturers.    \"Here, 'Lijah,\" said Farley, hurriedly drawing a bunch of keys from  his pocket and thrusting them into the other's hands; \"take these.  That flat key will open the safe, and in it--look--is this box,  containing the most valuable papers in the store. If anything happens  be sure to look after them. Now good-bye, old fellow. Don't go to  sleep, and look out for me inside of two hours.\" And he was gone.    'Lijah listened to his retreating footsteps with intense satisfaction.    \"Hi! Ain't dis a Chris'mus Eve fer ole 'Lijah!\" he said, softly,  taking a survey of his surroundings, and proceeding to settle himself  in one of the most uncomfortable chairs in the room.    Pretty soon he looked at the clock. The hand indicated exactly  half-past seven.    \"Reck'n I'll begin dis yere business on time,\" he soliloquized,  picking up the lantern Farley had left for him.    It would have been laughable, and pathetic at the same time, had any  one been there to see how anxiously he peered into every corner for  signs of danger; scrutinizing the door mats, gravely pausing before  tables and desks, giving a comprehensive glance now and then at the  ceiling, stepping on tiptoe, and, with eyes as round as saucers,  listening as he approached each door. This entire performance he  repeated regularly on the quarter-hours, as Farley had told him; his  features relaxing into his gleeful chuckle each time, as he found  himself in the cosy office, with all well behind him.    Meanwhile the hands of the clock upon the wall crept round in  leisurely fashion to nine, half-past, ten; and 'Lijah's broad, white  smile expanded further and further as no Farley appeared.    \"He's done trus' me lots dis yere night, sho'ly,\" he repeated again.  \"Guess you's a tol'able good watchman, po' ole 'Lijah, you is. Hi!  dat's some o' Miss Rosy's work, sho' 'nuff!\"    He had finished his quarter-past-ten round, and had been sitting for  some time in his straight-backed chair, singing softly to himself, and  ruminating on Mars' George's manifold virtues and the fair face of his  lady, and was watching the clock for the signal of his next survey of  the premises, when he noticed a peculiar effect in the upper portion  of the room. The ceiling seemed to be going farther and farther away,  lifting higher and higher. Was he falling asleep then, after all, like  an unfaithful sentinel? He sat bolt upright, rubbed his smarting eyes,  and looked up again. The ceiling was almost out of sight. At the same  moment the old negro was seized with a violent fit of coughing. He  sprang to his feet, trembling in every limb. There was no longer any  mystery about it; the room was rapidly filling with smoke, which  poured in steadily through the transom over the office door.    'Lijah stood a moment and tried to think. Then he ran, lantern in  hand, into the entry and down the stairs, uttering incoherent cries of  \"O Lor'! O Mars' George! Look yere, look yere! O 'Lijah, you wuf'less  ole--O Lor', O Lor'!\" Scrambling, tumbling, sliding, he found his way  down through the stifling smoke, which boiled up in an ever  increasing volume from the basement. Reaching the street, 'Lijah ran  plump into a policeman, and, his teeth chattering with terror, tried  to tell him what was the matter.    But his haste was needless, for even while he spoke, deep voices were  repeating 'Lijah's message in solemn, measured tones, above the roofs  all over the city; a low roar, growing louder each instant, arose far  down the street. Louder and louder, mingled with a jangling of gongs  and dismal blowing of horns, as the mighty foes of the fire gathered  to their work. Suddenly the crowd, which seemed to have sprung up out  of the ground, fled to right and left. A magnificent pair of black  horses dashed fiercely up before the store, leaving behind them a long  trail of floating sparks from the beautiful, glistening creature of  brass and steel at their backs. Then came one piece of apparatus after  another, engines, ladders and hose. In the confusion and uproar of  their arrival, the policeman had quite forgotten the trembling old  black man and his lantern. Now he looked around and saw him crowding  his way toward the store, from which tongues of flame began to dart  viciously.    \"Come back there!\" shouted the officer sternly, rushing upon 'Lijah  and jerking him backward so that he nearly fell. \"Don't you see the  stairway's all on fire?\"    \"B-b-but Mars' George done trus'\"--    \"I don't know anything about that,\" interrupted the policeman, pushing  back the crowd to right and left. \"You can't go in there again, and  that's all there is about it.\"    A determined look came into 'Lijah's dark face. He stopped shaking and  watched his chance. It came soon, and with a movement wonderfully  quick for such an old man, he darted through the line and toward the  burning building.    \"Stop him! Stop the nigger!\" shouted half a dozen voices. \"He's  crazy!\"    Two or three firemen sprang forward, but it was too late. An  involuntary and audible shudder went through the crowd as he plunged  into the black stairway, stooping to avoid the flames which curled  around the posts above his head.    In another minute some one cried out, \"Look, look! there he is, way up  in the third story!\"    How he had made his way through that terrible barrier, no one ever  knew. There he was, gesticulating wildly at the window, shouting to  the firemen, and presently holding up what appeared to be a small box.  With a warning cry to those below, he dropped it, watched it as it  fell and was borne safely out of danger by a uniformed officer,--and  sank back upon the window sill. Those in the opposite building  afterward said they could see then that he was terribly burned, but  seemed in all his pain to be laughing to himself. They thought, as did  the crowd below, that he was insane.    All this time the firemen were attacking the fire upon every side, but  with no visible effect. The varnish and oils stored by the furniture  dealers in various portions of their establishment made rallying  points for the flames, which almost at the very outset had found their  way through the central staircase, and so up and out of the roof.  Every front window in the two lower stories poured forth its volume of  fire and smoke, so that no ladders could be successfully planted. Nor  could entrance be effected through the skylight, the enemy having, as  I have described, taken possession of that important point. Meanwhile  old 'Lijah seemed quite content to sit just inside his window and wait  for what was coming fast. His grizzled head drooped gradually, and  those nearest could see his lips moving. If they had been very near  indeed, they would have heard him talking and singing to himself:        \"'Swing low, sweet chari-o-t,      Comin' fer to carry me home!'    I'se done it, Mars' George, jes' 's you tole me. You done trus'  'Lijah, an' he warn't a-gwine to give up.        'Whiter dan sno-o-ow! Swing low!'\"    Yes, old 'Lijah, your chariot is swinging low for you, very low.        \"Comin' fer to carry me\"--    The thick smoke rolls out heavily through the window overhead. The  firemen keep a steady stream playing through the broken panes, and  fight fiercely with their axes to reach him. It grows so hot that the  people in the opposite windows hold their hands before their faces,  while they watch.    Still nearer swings the great roaring chariot of fire. Lower and lower  droops the faithful head upon the black, scorched hands.    His lips were still moving faintly, and he was still whispering,  \"Swing low, swing low, swing low,\" when CRASH! came a burly figure,  his face blackened with smoke and his rubber coat dripping with water,  straight in through the window. Without a word he seized 'Lijah firmly  around the waist and raised himself upright on the window-sill; then  looking upward he shouted, hoarsely, \"Haul away!\"    The crowd held their breath as the two figures swung out into the air  at that fearful height, and spun round once or twice before they were  drawn up--up--inch by inch, and landed safe and sound on the roof.  Then up went such a shout as has rarely been heard in this good city;  a great, beautiful, manly cry of triumph and joy, such as the angels  might utter over him who was lost.    It was a long time before 'Lijah could realize that he had not been  borne away in his chariot, that had swung so low. I believe he felt a  pang of disappointment when he first looked at his wrinkled, scarred  hands, and found they were not \"whiter than snow.\" But Rosy, dear,  repentant little Rosy, soon found ways to comfort him; for she would  not hear of his staying in the hospital, because she knew it was all  her fault, she said, keeping George so long. So 'Lijah is quite as  content to stay on the earth a little while longer as he was to go.  For does not Mars' George come every evening and sit by him, and tell  him they must live together always? and doesn't 'Lijah know, too, that  the crowning glory of his life is to be on next Christmas Eve, just a  year from the great fire, when Miss Rosy will be Miss Rosy no longer,  and he is to enter upon permanent duties in her new home?          IV    A CHRISTMAS REVERIE      It was growing late, on a certain December evening, when I put on my  dressing-gown and slippers, turned off the gas, drew my easy chair up  in front of the blazing wood fire, and settled back with a long breath  of comfort, thanking my lucky stars that work was over, for that day  at any rate. Not that any stars were in sight, lucky or otherwise. In  the first place, the windows were covered with a heavy,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4320"],[0,"An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals (#6)"],[1,"for those rules, which are, on the whole, most  USEFUL and BENEFICIAL. Vulgar sense and slight experience are sufficient  for this purpose; where men give not way to too selfish avidity, or too  extensive enthusiasm.    Who sees not, for instance, that whatever is produced or improved by a  man's art or industry ought, for ever, to be secured to him, in order to  give encouragement to such USEFUL habits and accomplishments? That the  property ought also to descend to children and relations, for the same  USEFUL purpose? That it may be alienated by consent, in order to beget  that commerce and intercourse, which is so BENEFICIAL to human society?  And that all contracts and promises ought carefully to be fulfilled,  in order to secure mutual trust and confidence, by which the general  INTEREST of mankind is so much promoted?    Examine the writers on the laws of nature; and you will always find,  that, whatever principles they set out with, they are sure to terminate  here at last, and to assign, as the ultimate reason for every rule which  they establish, the convenience and necessities of mankind. A concession  thus extorted, in opposition to systems, has more authority than if it  had been made in prosecution of them.    What other reason, indeed, could writers ever give, why this must be  MINE and that YOURS; since uninstructed nature surely never made any  such distinction? The objects which receive those appellations are, of  themselves, foreign to us; they are totally disjoined and separated  from us; and nothing but the general interests of society can form the  connexion.    Sometimes the interests of society may require a rule of justice in  a particular case; but may not determine any particular rule, among  several, which are all equally beneficial. In that case, the slightest  analogies are laid hold of, in order to prevent that indifference and  ambiguity, which would be the source of perpetual dissension. Thus  possession alone, and first possession, is supposed to convey property,  where no body else has any preceding claim and pretension. Many of the  reasonings of lawyers are of this analogical nature, and depend on very  slight connexions of the imagination.    Does any one scruple, in extraordinary cases, to violate all regard to  the private property of individuals, and sacrifice to public interest  a distinction which had been established for the sake of that interest?  The safety of the people is the supreme law: All other particular laws  are subordinate to it, and dependent on it: And if, in the COMMON course  of things, they be followed and regarded; it is only because the  public safety and interest COMMONLY demand so equal and impartial an  administration.    Sometimes both UTILITY and ANALOGY fail, and leave the laws of justice  in total uncertainty. Thus, it is highly requisite, that prescription  or long possession should convey property; but what number of days or  months or years should be sufficient for that purpose, it is impossible  for reason alone to determine. CIVIL LAWS here supply the place of the  natural CODE, and assign different terms for prescription, according to  the different UTILITIES, proposed by the legislator. Bills of exchange  and promissory notes, by the laws of most countries, prescribe sooner  than bonds, and mortgages, and contracts of a more formal nature.    In general we may observe that all questions of property are subordinate  to the authority of civil laws, which extend, restrain, modify,  and alter the rules of natural justice, according to the particular  CONVENIENCE of each community. The laws have, or ought to have, a  constant reference to the constitution of government, the manners, the  climate, the religion, the commerce, the situation of each society. A  late author of genius, as well as learning, has prosecuted this subject  at large, and has established, from these principles, a system of  political knowledge, which abounds in ingenious and brilliant thoughts,  and is not wanting in solidity.           [Footnote: The author of L'ESPRIT DES LOIX, This illustrious       writer, however, sets out with a different theory, and       supposes all right to be founded on certain RAPPORTS or       relations; which is a system, that, in my opinion, never       will be reconciled with true philosophy. Father Malebranche,       as far as I can learn, was the first that started this       abstract theory of morals, which was afterwards adopted by       Cudworth, Clarke, and others; and as it excludes all       sentiment, and pretends to found everything on reason, it       has not wanted followers in this philosophic age. See       Section I, Appendix I. With regard to justice, the virtue       here treated of, the inference against this theory seems       short and conclusive. Property is allowed to be dependent on       civil laws; civil laws are allowed to have no other object,       but the interest of society: This therefore must be allowed       to be the sole foundation of property and justice. Not to       mention, that our obligation itself to obey the magistrate       and his laws is founded on nothing but the interests of       society. If the ideas of justice, sometimes, do not follow       the dispositions of civil law; we shall find, that these       cases, instead of objections, are confirmations of the       theory delivered above. Where a civil law is so perverse as       to cross all the interests of society, it loses all its       authority, and men judge by the ideas of natural justice,       which are conformable to those interests. Sometimes also       civil laws, for useful purposes, require a ceremony or form       to any deed; and where that is wanting, their decrees run       contrary to the usual tenour of justice; but one who takes       advantage of such chicanes, is not commonly regarded as an       honest man. Thus, the interests of society require, that       contracts be fulfilled; and there is not a more material       article either of natural or civil justice: But the omission       of a trifling circumstance will often, by law, invalidate a       contract, in foro humano, but not in foro conscientiae, as       divines express themselves. In these cases, the magistrate       is supposed only to withdraw his power of enforcing the       right, not to have altered the right. Where his intention       extends to the right, and is conformable to the interests of       society; it never fails to alter the right; a clear proof of       the origin of justice and of property, as assigned above.]      WHAT IS A MAN'S PROPERTY? Anything which it is lawful for him, and for  him alone, to use. BUT WHAT RULE HAVE WE, BY WHICH WE CAN DISTINGUISH  THESE OBJECTS? Here we must have recourse to statutes, customs,  precedents, analogies, and a hundred other circumstances; some of  which are constant and inflexible, some variable and arbitrary. But the  ultimate point, in which they all professedly terminate, is the  interest and happiness of human society. Where this enters not into  consideration, nothing can appear more whimsical, unnatural, and even  superstitious, than all or most of the laws of justice and of property.    Those who ridicule vulgar superstitions, and expose the folly of  particular regards to meats, days, places, postures, apparel, have an  easy task; while they consider all the qualities and relations of the  objects, and discover no adequate cause for that affection or antipathy,  veneration or horror, which have so mighty an influence over a  considerable part of mankind. A Syrian would have starved rather than  taste pigeon; an Egyptian would not have approached bacon: But if these  species of food be examined by the senses of sight, smell, or taste,  or scrutinized by the sciences of chemistry, medicine, or physics, no  difference is ever found between them and any other species, nor  can that precise circumstance be pitched on, which may afford a just  foundation for the religious passion. A fowl on Thursday is lawful  food; on Friday abominable: Eggs in this house and in this diocese,  are permitted during Lent; a hundred paces farther, to eat them is a  damnable sin. This earth or building, yesterday was profane; to-day,  by the muttering of certain words, it has become holy and sacred. Such  reflections as these, in the mouth of a philosopher, one may safely  say, are too obvious to have any influence; because they must always,  to every man, occur at first sight; and where they prevail not, of  themselves, they are surely obstructed by education, prejudice, and  passion, not by ignorance or mistake.    It may appear to a careless view, or rather a too abstracted reflection,  that there enters a like superstition into all the sentiments of  justice; and that, if a man expose its object, or what we call property,  to the same scrutiny of sense and science, he will not, by the most  accurate enquiry, find any foundation for the difference made by moral  sentiment. I may lawfully nourish myself from this tree; but the fruit  of another of the same species, ten paces off, it is criminal for me to  touch. Had I worn this apparel an hour ago, I had merited the severest  punishment; but a man, by pronouncing a few magical syllables, has now  rendered it fit for my use and service. Were this house placed in the  neighbouring territory, it had been immoral for me to dwell in it;  but being built on this side the river, it is subject to a different  municipal law, and by its becoming mine I incur no blame or censure.  The same species of reasoning it may be thought, which so successfully  exposes superstition, is also applicable to justice; nor is it possible,  in the one case more than in the other, to point out, in the object,  that precise quality or circumstance, which is the foundation of the  sentiment.    But there is this material difference between SUPERSTITION and JUSTICE,  that the former is"]]]
