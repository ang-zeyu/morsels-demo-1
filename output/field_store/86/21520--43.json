But, before the first hour had passed, a boy from the telegraph office  handed in a blue envelope, and the doctor hastily broke the seal and  read--           \"Be with you at 6.20.         \"FERRARS.\"      When the first suburban train for the evening halted, puffing, at the  village station, Doctor Barnes waiting upon the platform, saw a man of  medium height and square English build step down from the smoking car  and look indifferently about him.    There was the usual throng of gaping and curious villagers, and some of  them heard the stranger say, as he advanced toward the doctor, who  waited with his small medicine case in his hand--    \"Pardon me; is this doctor--doctor Barnes?\" And when the doctor nodded  he asked quickly, \"How is she?\"    \"Still unnerved and weak. We have had a terrible shock, for all of us.\"    When the two men had left the crowd of curious loungers behind them the  doctor said--    \"It is awfully good of you, Ferrars, to come so promptly at my call. Of  course, I could not explain over the wires. But, you understand.\"    \"I understand that you needed me, and as I'm good for very little, save  in one capacity, I, of course, supposed there was a case for me. The  evening paper, however, gave me--or so I fancy--a hint of the business.  Is it the young schoolmaster?\"    The doctor started. It seemed impossible that the news had already found  its way into print.    \"Some one has made haste,\" he said, scornfully.    \"Some one always does in these cases, and the _Journal_ has a 'special  correspondent' in every town and village in the country almost. It was  only a few lines.\" He glanced askance at his companion as he spoke. \"And  it was reported an accident or suicide.\"    \"It was a murder!\"    \"I thought so.\"    \"You--why?\"    \"'The victim was found,' so says the paper, 'face downward, or nearly  so.' 'Fallen forward,' those were the words. Was that the case?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, did you ever see or hear of a suicide who had fallen directly  forward and face downward, supposing him to have shot himself?\"    \"No, no.\"    \"On the other hand, have you ever noted that a man taken unawares, shot  from the side, or rear, falls forward? If shot standing, that is. It is  only when he receives a face charge that he falls backward.\"    \"I had not thought of that, and yet it looks simple and rational  enough,\" and then, while they walked down the quiet street running  parallel with Main, and upon which Mrs. Marcy's cottage stood, the  doctor told the story of the morning, briefly but clearly, adding, at  the end, \"In telling this much, I am telling you actually all that I  know.\"    \"All--concerning Miss Grant, too?\"    \"Everything.\"    The doctor did not lift his eyes from the path before them, and again  the detective shot a side glance from the corner of his eye, and the  shadow of a smile crossed his face.    \"How does it happen that this brother is here so--I was about to  say--opportunely?\"    \"He told me that he came by appointment, but on an earlier train than he  had at first intended to take, to pass Sunday with his brother.\"    \"Now see,\" mused Ferrars, \"what little things, done or left undone,  shape or shorten our lives! If he had telegraphed to his brother  announcing his earlier arrival, there would have been no target  practice, but a walk to the station instead.\"    The doctor sighed, and for a few moments walked on in silence. Then, as  they neared the cottage he almost stopped short and turned toward the  detective.    \"I'm afraid you will think me a sad bungler, Ferrars. I should have told  you at once that Robert Brierly awaits us at Mrs. Marcy's cottage.\"    \"Robert Brierly? Is that his name? I wonder if he can be the Robert  Brierly who has helped to make one of our morning papers so bright and  breezy. A rising young journalist, in fact. But it's probably another of  the name.\"    \"I don't know. He has not spoken of himself. Will it suit you to meet  him at once?\"    \"We don't often get the chance to begin as would best suit us, we  hunters of our kind. I would have preferred to go first to the scene of  the death, but I suppose the ground has been trampled over and over,  and, besides, I don't want to advertise myself until I am better  informed at least. Go on, we will let our meeting come as it will.\"    But things seldom went on as they would for long, when Frank Ferrars was  seeking his way toward a truth or fact. They found Mrs. Marcy at the  door, and she at once led them to the upper room which looked out upon  the side and rear of the little lawn, and was screened from inlookers,  as well as from the sun's rays, by tall cherry trees at the side, and  thick and clinging morning glory vines at the back.    \"You'll be quite safe from intrusion here,\" she murmured, and left them  as she had received them at the door.    If Doctor Barnes had feared for his patient's strength, and dreaded the  effect upon her of the coming interview, he was soon convinced that he  had misjudged the courage and will power of this slight, soft-eyed,  low-voiced and unassertive young woman. She was very pale, and her eyes  looked out from their dark circles like wells of grief. But no tears  fell from them, and the low pathetic voice did not falter when she said,  after the formal presentation, and before either of the others had  spoken:    \"I have asked to be present at this interview, Mr. Ferrars, and am told  that it rests with you whether I am admitted to your confidences.  Charles Brierly is my betrothed, and I would to God I had yielded to his  wish and married him a week ago. Then no one could have shut me out from  ought that concerns him, living or dead. In the sight of heaven he is my  husband, for we promised each other eternal faithfulness with our hands  clasped above his mother's Bible.\"    Francis Ferrars was a singular mixture of sternness and gentleness, of  quick decision at need and of patient considerateness, and he now took  one of the cold little hands between his own, and gently but firmly led  her to the cosy chair from which she had arisen.    \"You have proved your right to be here, and no one will dispute it. We  may need your active help soon, as much as we need and desire your  counsel and your closer knowledge of the dead man now.\"    In moments of intense feeling conventionalities fall away from us and  strong soul speaks to strong soul. While they awaited the coming of the  doctor and Francis Ferrars, Hilda Grant and Robert Brierly had been  unable to break through the constraint which seemed to each to be the  mental attitude of the other, and then, too, both were engrossed with  the same thought, the coming of the detective, and the possibilities  this suggested, for underlying the grievous sorrow of both brother and  sweetheart lay the thought, the silent appeal for justice as inherent in  our poor human nature as is humanity itself.    But Hilda's sudden claim, her prayer for recognition struck down the  barrier of strangeness and the selfishness of sorrow, than which  sometimes nothing can be more exclusive, in the mind and heart of Robert  Brierly, and he came swiftly to her side, as she sank back, pallid and  panting, upon her cushions.    \"Miss Grant, my sister; no other claim is so strong as yours. It was to  meet you, to know you, that I set out for this place to-day. In my poor  brother's last letter--you shall read it soon--he said, 'I am going to  give you something precious, Rob; a sister. It is to meet her that I  have asked you to come just now.' I claim that sister, and need her now  if never before. Don't look upon me as a stranger, but as Charlie's  brother, and yours.\" He placed his hand over hers as it rested weakly  upon the arm of her chair, and as it turned and the chill little fingers  closed upon his own, he held it for a moment and then, releasing it  gently, drew a seat beside her and turned toward the detective.    \"Mr. Ferrars, your friend has assured me that I may hope for your aid.  Is that so?\"    \"When I have heard all that you can tell me, I will answer,\" replied  Ferrars. \"If I see a hope or chance of unravelling what now looks like  a mystery--should it be proved a mystery--I will give you my promise,  and my services.\"    He had seated himself almost opposite Hilda Grant, and while he quietly  studied her face, he addressed the doctor.    \"Tell me,\" he said, \"all you know and have been told by others, and be  sure you omit not the least detail.\"    Beginning with the appearance of Mr. Doran at his office door, with the  panting and perspiring black pony, the doctor detailed their drive and  his first sight of the victim, reviewing his examination of the body in  detail, while the detective listened attentively and somewhat to the  surprise of the others, without interruption, until the narrator had  reached the point when, accompanied by Brierly, he had followed the  hearse, with its pitiful burden, back to the village. Then Ferrars  interposed.    \"A moment, please,\" taking from an inner pocket a broad, flat  letter-case and selecting from it a printed card, which, with a pencil,  he held out to the doctor. \"Be so good,\" he said, \"as to sketch upon the  blank back of this the spot where you found the dead man, the mound in  full, with the road indicated, above and beyond it. I remember you used  to be skilful at sketching things.\"          CHAPTER V.    IN CONSULTATION.      When the doctor had completed his hasty sketch, he returned the card  upon which it was made, to the detective and silently awaited his  comment.    \"It is very helpful,\" said Ferrars. \"It would seem, then, that just  opposite the mound the lake makes an inward curve?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And that the centre of the mound corresponds to the central or nearest  point of the curve?\"    The doctor nodded assent.    \"Now am I right in thinking that anything "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3533"],[0,"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town (#6)"],[1," a la Ossawippi.    Three members of the town council were converted with a Dindon farci a  la Josh Smith.    And then, finally, Mr. Diston persuaded Dean Drone to come, and as soon  as Mr. Smith and Alphonse saw him they landed him with a fried flounder  that even the apostles would have appreciated.    After that, every one knew that the license question was practically  settled. The petition was all over the town. It was printed in duplicate  at the Newspacket and you could see it lying on the counter of every  shop in Mariposa. Some of the people signed it twenty or thirty times.    It was the right kind of document too. It began--\"Whereas in the bounty  of providence the earth putteth forth her luscious fruits and her  vineyards for the delight and enjoyment of mankind--\" It made you  thirsty just to read it. Any man who read that petition over was wild to  get to the Rats' Cooler.    When it was all signed up they had nearly three thousand names on it.    Then Nivens, the lawyer, and Mr. Gingham (as a provincial official) took  it down to the county town, and by three o'clock that afternoon the  news had gone out from the long distance telephone office that Smith's  license was renewed for three years.    Rejoicings! Well, I should think so! Everybody was down wanting to  shake hands with Mr. Smith. They told him that he had done more to boom  Mariposa than any ten men in town. Some of them said he ought to run  for the town council, and others wanted to make him the Conservative  candidate for the next Dominion election. The caff was a mere babel  of voices, and even the Rats' Cooler was almost floated away from its  moorings.    And in the middle of it all, Mr. Smith found time to say to Billy,  the desk clerk: \"Take the cash registers out of the caff and the Rats'  Cooler and start counting up the books.\"    And Billy said: \"Will I write the letters for the palms and the tables  and the stuff to go back?\"    And Mr. Smith said: \"Get 'em written right away.\"    So all evening the laughter and the chatter and the congratulations went  on, and it wasn't till long after midnight that Mr. Smith was able to  join Billy in the private room behind the \"rotunda.\" Even when he did,  there was a quiet and a dignity about his manner that had never been  there before. I think it must have been the new halo of the Conservative  candidacy that already radiated from his brow. It was, I imagine, at  this very moment that Mr. Smith first realised that the hotel business  formed the natural and proper threshold of the national legislature.    \"Here's the account of the cash registers,\" said Billy.    \"Let me see it,\" said Mr. Smith. And he studied the figures without a  word.    \"And here's the letters about the palms, and here's Alphonse up to  yesterday--\"    And then an amazing thing happened.    \"Billy,\" said Mr. Smith, \"tear'em up. I ain't going to do it. It ain't  right and I won't do it. They got me the license for to keep the caff  and I'm going to keep the caff. I don't need to close her. The bar's  good for anything from forty to a hundred a day now, with the Rats'  Cooler going good, and that caff will stay right here.\"    And stay it did.    There it stands, mind you, to this day. You've only to step round the  corner of Smith's Hotel on the side street and read the sign: LADIES'  AND GENT'S CAFE, just as large and as imposing as ever.    Mr. Smith said that he'd keep the caff, and when he saida thing he meant  it!    Of course there were changes, small changes.    I don't say, mind you, that the fillet de beef that you get there now is  perhaps quite up to the level of the filet de boeufs aux champignons of  the days of glory.    No doubt the lamb chops in Smith's Caff are often very much the same,  nowadays, as the lamb chops of the Mariposa House or the Continental.    Of course, things like Omelette aux Trufles practically died out when  Alphonse went. And, naturally, the leaving of Alphonse was inevitable.  No one knew just when he went, or why. But one morning he was gone. Mr.  Smith said that \"Alf had to go back to his folks in the old country.\"    So, too, when Alf left, the use of the French language, as such, fell  off tremendously in the caff. Even now they use it to some extent. You  can still get fillet de beef, and saucisson au juice, but Billy the desk  clerk has considerable trouble with the spelling.    The Rats' Cooler, of course, closed down, or rather Mr. Smith closed it  for repairs, and there is every likelihood that it will hardly open for  three years. But the caff is there. They don't use the grills, because  there's no need to, with the hotel kitchen so handy.    The \"girl room,\" I may say, was never opened. Mr. Smith promised it, it  is true, for the winter, and still talks of it. But somehow there's been  a sort of feeling against it. Every one in town admits that every big  hotel in the city has a \"girl room\" and that it must be all right.  Still, there's a certain--well, you know how sensitive opinion is in a  place like Mariposa.          TWO. The Speculations of Jefferson Thorpe    It was not until the mining boom, at the time when everybody went simply  crazy over the Cobalt and Porcupine mines of the new silver country near  the Hudson Bay, that Jefferson Thorpe reached what you might call public  importance in Mariposa.    Of course everybody knew Jeff and his little barber shop that stood just  across the street from Smith's Hotel. Everybody knew him and everybody  got shaved there. From early morning, when the commercial travellers off  the 6.30 express got shaved into the resemblance of human beings, there  were always people going in and out of the barber shop.    Mullins, the manager of the Exchange Bank, took his morning shave from  Jeff as a form of resuscitation, with enough wet towels laid on his face  to stew him and with Jeff moving about in the steam, razor in hand, as  grave as an operating surgeon.    Then, as I think I said, Mr. Smith came in every morning and there was  a tremendous outpouring of Florida water and rums, essences and revivers  and renovators, regardless of expense. What with Jeff's white coat and  Mr. Smith's flowered waistcoat and the red geranium in the window and  the Florida water and the double extract of hyacinth, the little shop  seemed multi-coloured and luxurious enough for the annex of a Sultan's  harem.    But what I mean is that, till the mining boom, Jefferson Thorpe never  occupied a position of real prominence in Mariposa. You couldn't, for  example, have compared him with a man like Golgotha Gingham, who,  as undertaker, stood in a direct relation to life and death, or to  Trelawney, the postmaster, who drew money from the Federal Government of  Canada, and was regarded as virtually a member of the Dominion Cabinet.    Everybody knew Jeff and liked him, but the odd thing was that till he  made money nobody took any stock in his ideas at all. It was only after  he made the \"clean up\" that they came to see what a splendid fellow  he was. \"Level-headed\" I think was the term; indeed in the speech of  Mariposa, the highest form of endowment was to have the head set on  horizontally as with a theodolite.    As I say, it was when Jeff made money that they saw how gifted he was,  and when he lost it,--but still, there's no need to go into that. I  believe it's something the same in other places too.    The barber shop, you will remember, stands across the street from  Smith's Hotel, and stares at it face to face.    It is one of those wooden structures--I don't know whether you know  them--with a false front that sticks up above its real height and gives  it an air at once rectangular and imposing. It is a form of architecture  much used in Mariposa and understood to be in keeping with the  pretentious and artificial character of modern business. There is a red,  white and blue post in front of the shop and the shop itself has a large  square window out of proportion to its little flat face.    Painted on the panes of the window is the remains of a legend that once  spelt BARBER SHOP, executed with the flourishes that prevailed in the  golden age of sign painting in Mariposa. Through the window you can see  the geraniums in the window shelf and behind them Jeff Thorpe with his  little black scull cap on and his spectacles drooped upon his nose as he  bends forward in the absorption of shaving.    As you open the door, it sets in violent agitation a coiled spring up  above and a bell that almost rings. Inside, there are two shaving chairs  of the heavier, or electrocution pattern, with mirrors in front of them  and pigeon holes with individual shaving mugs. There must be ever so  many of them, fifteen or sixteen. It is the current supposition of each  of Jeff's customers that everyone else but himself uses a separate mug.  One corner of the shop is partitioned off and bears the sign: HOT AND  COLD BATHS, 50 CENTS. There has been no bath inside the partition for  twenty years--only old newspapers and a mop. Still, it lends distinction  somehow, just as do the faded cardboard signs that hang against the  mirror with the legends: TURKISH SHAMPOO, 75 CENTS, and ROMAN MASSAGE,  $1.00.    They said commonly in Mariposa that Jeff made money out of the barber  shop. He may have, and it may have been that that turned his mind to  investment. But it's hard to see how he could. A shave cost five cents,  and a hair-cut fifteen (or the two, if you liked, for a quarter), and  at that it is hard to see how he could make money, even when he had both  chairs going and shaved first in one and then in the other.    You see, in Mariposa, shaving isn't the hurried, perfunctory thing that  it is in the city. A shave is looked upon as a form of physical pleasure  and lasts anywhere from twenty-five minutes to three-quarters of an  hour.    In the morning hours, perhaps, there was a semblance of haste about it,  but in the long quiet of the afternoon, as"]]]
