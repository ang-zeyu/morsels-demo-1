The fog still slept on the wing above the drowned city, where  the lamps glimmered like carbuncles; and through the muffle and  smother of these fallen clouds, the procession of the town's life  was still rolling in through the great arteries with a sound as of a  mighty wind. But the room was gay with firelight. In the bottle the  acids were long ago resolved; the imperial dye had softened with  time, As the colour grows richer in stained windows; and the glow of  hot autumn afternoons on hillside vineyards was ready to be set free    40)    and to disperse the fogs of London. Insensibly the lawyer melted.  There was no man from whom he kept fewer secrets than Mr. Guest;  and he was not always sure that he kept as many as he meant. Guest  had often been on business to the doctor's; he knew Poole; he could  scarce have failed to hear of Mr. Hyde's familiarity about the  house; he might draw conclusions: was it not as well, then, that he  should see a letter which put that mystery to rights? and above all  since Guest, being a great student and critic of handwriting, would  consider the step natural and obliging? The clerk, besides, was a  man of counsel; he would scarce read so strange a document without  dropping a remark; and by that remark Mr. Utterson might shape his  future course.    \"This is a sad business about Sir Danvers,\" he said.    \"Yes, sir, indeed. It has elicited a great deal of public feeling,\"  returned Guest. \"The man, of course, was mad.\"    \"I should like to hear your views on that,\" replied Utterson. \"I  have a document here in his handwriting; it is between ourselves,  for I scarce know what to do about it; it is an ugly business at  the best. But there it is; quite in your way a murderer's  autograph.\"    Guest's eyes brightened, and he sat down at once and studied it  with passion. \"No, sir,\" he said: \"not mad; but it is an odd hand.\"    41)    \"And by all accounts a very odd writer,\" added the lawyer.    Just then the servant entered with a note.    \"Is that from Dr. Jekyll, sir?\" inquired the clerk. \"I thought I  knew the writing. Anything private, Mr. Utterson?\"    \"Only an invitation to dinner. Why? Do you want to see it?\"    \"One moment. I thank you, sir\"; and the clerk laid the two sheets  of paper alongside and sedulously compared their contents. \"Thank  you, sir,\" he said at last, returning both; \"it's a very  interesting autograph.\"    There was a pause, during which Mr. Utterson struggled with  himself. \"Why did you compare them, Guest?\" he inquired suddenly.    \"Well, sir,\" returned the clerk, \"there's a rather singular  resemblance; the two hands are in many points identical: only  differently sloped.\"    \"Rather quaint,\" said Utterson.    \"It is, as you say, rather quaint,\" returned Guest.    \"I wouldn't speak of this note, you know,\" said the master.    \"No, sir,\" said the clerk. \"I understand.\"    But no sooner was Mr. Utterson alone that night than he locked the  note into his safe, where it reposed from that time forward.  \"What!\" he thought. \"Henry Jekyll forge for a murderer!\" And his  blood ran cold in his veins.        42)                             REMARKABLE INCIDENT OF DR. LANYON    TIME ran on; thousands of pounds were offered in reward, for the  death of Sir Danvers was resented as a public injury; but Mr. Hyde  had disappeared out of the ken of the police as though he had never  existed. Much of his past was unearthed, indeed, and all  disreputable: tales came out of the man's cruelty, at once so  callous and violent; of his vile life, of his strange associates,  of the hatred that seemed to have surrounded his career; but of his  present whereabouts, not a whisper. From the time he had left the  house in Soho on the morning of the murder, he was simply blotted  out; and gradually, as time drew on, Mr. Utterson began to recover  from the hotness of his alarm, and to grow more at quiet with  himself. The death of Sir Danvers was, to his way of thinking, more  than paid for by the disappearance of Mr. Hyde. Now that that evil  influence had been withdrawn, a new life began for Dr. Jekyll. He  came out of his seclusion, renewed relations with his friends,  became once more their familiar guest    43)    and entertainer; and whilst he had always been known for  charities, he was now no less distinguished for religion. He was  busy, he was much in the open air, he did good; his face seemed to  open and brighten, as if with an inward consciousness of service;  and for more than two months, the doctor was at peace.    On the 8th of January Utterson had dined at the doctor's with a  small party; Lanyon had been there; and the face of the host had  looked from one to the other as in the old days when the trio were  inseparable friends. On the 12th, and again on the 14th, the door  was shut against the lawyer. \"The doctor was confined to the  house,\" Poole said, \"and saw no one.\" On the 15th, he tried again,  and was again refused; and having now been used for the last two  months to see his friend almost daily, he found this return of  solitude to weigh upon his spirits. The fifth night he had in Guest  to dine with him; and the sixth he betook himself to Dr. Lanyon's.    There at least he was not denied admittance; but when he came in,  he was shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctor's  appearance. He had his death-warrant written legibly upon his face.  The rosy man had grown pale; his flesh had fallen away; he was  visibly balder and older; and yet it was not so much, these tokens  of a swift physical decay that arrested the lawyer's notice, as a  look in the eye and quality of manner that seemed to testify to    44)    some deep-seated terror of the mind. It was unlikely that the  doctor should fear death; and yet that was what Utterson was  tempted to suspect. \"Yes,\" he thought; \"he is a doctor, he must  know his own state and that his days are counted; and the knowledge  is more than he can bear.\" And yet when Utterson remarked on his  ill-looks, it was with an air of greatness that Lanyon declared  himself a doomed man.    \"I have had a shock,\" he said, \"and I shall never recover. It is a  question of weeks. Well, life has been pleasant; I liked it; yes,  sir, I used to like it. I sometimes think if we knew all, we should  be more glad to get away.\"    \"Jekyll is ill, too,\" observed Utterson. \"Have you seen him?\"    But Lanyon's face changed, and he held up a trembling hand. \"I wish  to see or hear no more of Dr. Jekyll,\" he said in a loud, unsteady  voice. \"I am quite done with that person; and I beg that you will  spare me any allusion to one whom I regard as dead.\"    \"Tut-tut,\" said Mr. Utterson; and then after a considerable pause,  \"Can't I do anything?\" he inquired. \"We are three very old friends,  Lanyon; we shall not live to make others.\"    \"Nothing can be done,\" returned Lanyon; \"ask himself.\"    \"He will not see me,\" said the lawyer.    \"I am not surprised at that,\" was the reply. \"Some day, Utterson,  after I am dead, you may    45)    perhaps come to learn the right and wrong of this. I cannot tell  you. And in the meantime, if you can sit and talk with me of other  things, for God's sake, stay and do so; but if you cannot keep clear  of this accursed topic, then, in God's name, go, for I cannot bear  it.\"    As soon as he got home, Utterson sat down and wrote to Jekyll,  complaining of his exclusion from the house, and asking the cause  of this unhappy break with Lanyon; and the next day brought him a  long answer, often very pathetically worded, and sometimes darkly  mysterious in drift. The quarrel with Lanyon was incurable. \"I do  not blame our old friend,\" Jekyll wrote, \"but I share his view  that we must never meet. I mean from henceforth to lead a life of  extreme seclusion; you must not be surprised, nor must you doubt  my friendship, if my door is often shut even to you. You must  suffer me to go my own dark way. I have brought on myself a  punishment and a danger that I cannot name. If I am the chief of  sinners, I am the chief of sufferers also. I could not think that  this earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors so  unmanning; and you can do but one thing, Utterson, to lighten  this destiny, and that is to respect my silence.\" Utterson was  amazed; the dark influence of Hyde had been withdrawn, the doctor  had returned to his old tasks and amities; a week ago, the  prospect had smiled with every promise of a cheerful and an  honoured age;    46)    and now in a moment, friendship, and peace of mind, and the whole  tenor of his life were wrecked. So great and unprepared a change  pointed to madness; but in view of Lanyon's manner and words,  there must lie for it some deeper ground.    A week afterwards Dr. Lanyon took to his bed, and in something  less than a fortnight he was dead. The night after the funeral,  at which he had been sadly affected, Utterson locked the door of  his business room, and sitting there by the light of a melancholy  candle, drew out and set before him an envelope addressed by the  hand and sealed with the seal of his dead friend. \"PRIVATE: for  the hands of G. J. Utterson ALONE and in case of his predecease  to be destroyed unread,\" so it was emphatically superscribed; and  the lawyer dreaded to behold the contents. \"I have buried one  friend to-day,\" he thought: \"what if this should cost me  another?\" And then he condemned the fear as a disloyalty, and  broke the seal. Within there was another enclosure, likewise  sealed, and marked upon the cover as \"not to be opened till the  death or disappearance of Dr. Henry Jekyll.\" Utterson could not  trust his eyes. Yes, it was disappearance; here again, as in the  mad will which he had long ago restored to its author, here again  were the idea of a disappearance and the name of Henry Jekyll  bracketed. But in the will, that idea had sprung from the  sinister suggestion of    47)    the man Hyde; it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/420"],[0,"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz (#6)"],[1,"Prince.  \"You will notice they are all attached to  the plants by the soles of their feet, and when they are quite ripe  they are easily separated from the stems and at once attain the powers  of motion and speech.  So while they grow they cannot be said to really  live, and they must be picked before they can become good citizens.\"    \"How long do you live, after you are picked?\" asked Dorothy.    \"That depends upon the care we take of ourselves,\" he replied.  \"If we  keep cool and moist, and meet with no accidents, we often live for five  years.  I've been picked over six years, but our family is known to be  especially long lived.\"    \"Do you eat?\" asked the boy.    \"Eat!  No, indeed.  We are quite solid inside our bodies, and have no  need to eat, any more than does a potato.\"    \"But the potatoes sometimes sprout,\" said Zeb.    \"And sometimes we do,\" answered the Prince; \"but that is considered a  great misfortune, for then we must be planted at once.\"    \"Where did you grow?\" asked the Wizard.    \"I will show you,\" was the reply. \"Step this way, please.\"    He led them within another but smaller circle of hedge, where grew one  large and beautiful bush.    \"This,\" said he, \"is the Royal Bush of the Mangaboos.  All of our  Princes and Rulers have grown upon this one bush from time immemorial.\"    They stood before it in silent admiration.  On the central stalk stood  poised the figure of a girl so exquisitely formed and colored and so  lovely in the expression of her delicate features that Dorothy thought  she had never seen so sweet and adorable a creature in all her life.  The maiden's gown was soft as satin and fell about her in ample folds,  while dainty lace-like traceries trimmed the bodice and sleeves.  Her  flesh was fine and smooth as polished ivory, and her poise expressed  both dignity and grace.    \"Who is this?\" asked the Wizard, curiously.    The Prince had been staring hard at the girl on the bush.  Now he  answered, with a touch of uneasiness in his cold tones:    \"She is the Ruler destined to be my successor, for she is a Royal  Princess.  When she becomes fully ripe I must abandon the sovereignty  of the Mangaboos to her.\"    \"Isn't she ripe now?\" asked Dorothy.    He hesitated.    \"Not quite,\" said he, finally.  \"It will be several days before she  needs to be picked, or at least that is my judgment.  I am in no hurry  to resign my office and be planted, you may be sure.\"    \"Probably not,\" declared the Wizard, nodding.    \"This is one of the most unpleasant things about our vegetable lives,\"  continued the Prince, with a sigh, \"that while we are in our full prime  we must give way to another, and be covered up in the ground to sprout  and grow and give birth to other people.\"    \"I'm sure the Princess is ready to be picked,\" asserted Dorothy, gazing  hard at the beautiful girl on the bush.  \"She's as perfect as she can  be.\"    \"Never mind,\" answered the Prince, hastily, \"she will be all right for  a few days longer, and it is best for me to rule until I can dispose of  you strangers, who have come to our land uninvited and must be attended  to at once.\"    \"What are you going to do with us?\" asked Zeb.    \"That is a matter I have not quite decided upon,\" was the reply.  \"I  think I shall keep this Wizard until a new Sorcerer is ready to pick,  for he seems quite skillful and may be of use to us.  But the rest of  you must be destroyed in some way, and you cannot be planted, because I  do not wish horses and cats and meat people growing all over our  country.\"    \"You needn't worry,\" said Dorothy.  \"We wouldn't grow under ground, I'm  sure.\"    \"But why destroy my friends?\" asked the little Wizard.  \"Why not let  them live?\"    \"They do not belong here,\" returned the Prince.  \"They have no right to  be inside the earth at all.\"    \"We didn't ask to come down here; we fell,\" said Dorothy.    \"That is no excuse,\" declared the Prince, coldly.    The children looked at each other in perplexity, and the Wizard sighed.  Eureka rubbed her paw on her face and said in her soft, purring voice:    \"He won't need to destroy ME, for if I don't get something to eat  pretty soon I shall starve to death, and so save him the trouble.\"    \"If he planted you, he might grow some cat-tails,\" suggested the Wizard.    \"Oh, Eureka! perhaps we can find you some milk-weeds to eat,\" said the  boy.    \"Phoo!\" snarled the kitten; \"I wouldn't touch the nasty things!\"    \"You don't need milk, Eureka,\" remarked Dorothy; \"you are big enough  now to eat any kind of food.\"    \"If I can get it,\" added Eureka.    \"I'm hungry myself,\" said Zeb.  \"But I noticed some strawberries  growing in one of the gardens, and some melons in another place.  These  people don't eat such things, so perhaps on our way back they will let  us get them.\"    \"Never mind your hunger,\" interrupted the Prince.  \"I shall order you  destroyed in a few minutes, so you will have no need to ruin our pretty  melon vines and berry bushes.  Follow me, please, to meet your doom.\"          5.  Dorothy Picks the Princess      The words of the cold and moist vegetable Prince were not very  comforting, and as he spoke them he turned away and left the enclosure.  The children, feeling sad and despondent, were about to follow him when  the Wizard touched Dorothy softly on her shoulder.    \"Wait!\" he whispered.    \"What for?\" asked the girl.    \"Suppose we pick the Royal Princess,\" said the Wizard.  \"I'm quite sure  she's ripe, and as soon as she comes to life she will be the Ruler, and  may treat us better than that heartless Prince intends to.\"    \"All right!\" exclaimed Dorothy, eagerly.  \"Let's pick her while we have  the chance, before the man with the star comes back.\"    So together they leaned over the great bush and each of them seized one  hand of the lovely Princess.    \"Pull!\" cried Dorothy, and as they did so the royal lady leaned toward  them and the stems snapped and separated from her feet.  She was not at  all heavy, so the Wizard and Dorothy managed to lift her gently to the  ground.    The beautiful creature passed her hands over her eyes an instant,  tucked in a stray lock of hair that had become disarranged, and after a  look around the garden made those present a gracious bow and said, in a  sweet but even toned voice:    \"I thank you very much.\"    \"We salute your Royal Highness!\" cried the Wizard, kneeling and kissing  her hand.    Just then the voice of the Prince was heard calling upon them to  hasten, and a moment later he returned to the enclosure, followed by a  number of his people.    Instantly the Princess turned and faced him, and when he saw that she  was picked the Prince stood still and began to tremble.    \"Sir,\" said the Royal Lady, with much dignity, \"you have wronged me  greatly, and would have wronged me still more had not these strangers  come to my rescue.  I have been ready for picking all the past week,  but because you were selfish and desired to continue your unlawful  rule, you left me to stand silent upon my bush.\"    \"I did not know that you were ripe,\" answered the Prince, in a low  voice.    \"Give me the Star of Royalty!\" she commanded.    Slowly he took the shining star from his own brow and placed it upon  that of the Princess.  Then all the people bowed low to her, and the  Prince turned and walked away alone.  What became of him afterward our  friends never knew.    The people of Mangaboo now formed themselves into a procession and  marched toward the glass city to escort their new ruler to her palace  and to perform those ceremonies proper to the occasion.  But while the  people in the procession walked upon the ground the Princess walked in  the air just above their heads, to show that she was a superior being  and more exalted than her subjects.    No one now seemed to pay any attention to the strangers, so Dorothy and  Zeb and the Wizard let the train pass on and then wandered by  themselves into the vegetable gardens.  They did not bother to cross  the bridges over the brooks, but when they came to a stream they  stepped high and walked in the air to the other side.  This was a very  interesting experience to them, and Dorothy said:    \"I wonder why it is that we can walk so easily in the air.\"    \"Perhaps,\" answered the Wizard, \"it is because we are close to the  center of the earth, where the attraction of gravitation is very  slight.  But I've noticed that many queer things happen in fairy  countries.\"    \"Is this a fairy country?\" asked the boy.    \"Of course it is,\" returned Dorothy promptly.  \"Only a fairy country  could have veg'table people; and only in a fairy country could Eureka  and Jim talk as we do.\"    \"That's true,\" said Zeb, thoughtfully.    In the vegetable gardens they found the strawberries and melons, and  several other unknown but delicious fruits, of which they ate heartily.  But the kitten bothered them constantly by demanding milk or meat, and  called the Wizard names because he could not bring her a dish of milk  by means of his magical arts.    As they sat upon the grass watching Jim, who was still busily eating,  Eureka said:    \"I don't believe you are a Wizard at all!\"    \"No,\" answered the little man, \"you are quite right.  In the strict  sense of the word I am not a Wizard, but only a humbug.\"    \"The Wizard of Oz has always been a humbug,\" agreed Dorothy.  \"I've  known him for a long time.\"    \"If that is so,\" said the boy, \"how could he do that wonderful trick  with the nine tiny piglets?\"    \"Don't know,\" said Dorothy, \"but it must have been humbug.\"    \"Very true,\" declared the Wizard, nodding at her.  \"It was necessary to  deceive that ugly Sorcerer and the Prince, as well as their stupid  people; but I don't mind telling you, who are my friends, that the  thing was only a trick.\"    \"But I saw the little pigs with my own eyes!\" exclaimed Zeb.    \"So did I,\" purred the kitten.    \"To be sure,\" answered the Wizard.  \"You saw them because they were  there.
