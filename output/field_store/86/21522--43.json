I was glad,  therefore, to appease my friend by consenting to go with him--I knew not  where--and see an apparition.    Accordingly a few minutes before six, we started together on the strange  adventure. We passed down the street which leads to the _Jardin des  Plants_, and entering through the main avenue, walked nearly its entire  length, when my companion turned into a narrow path, almost concealed by  the foliage, which brought us into a small open space. Here he motioned  me to stop, and pointing to a rustic bench we both sat down. At the same  moment, the chimes from a neighboring chapel pealed the hour of six, and  while I was still listening to them, my friend seized my arm and  exclaimed in a whisper, \"Look!\" I cast my eyes across to the other side,  and beheld a figure advancing slowly toward us. It was that of a young  girl, in appearance scarcely seventeen. Her form was light and graceful,  simply draped in a loose robe of white muslin. On her head she wore a  straw hat, in which were placed conspicuously a bunch of fresh spring  blossoms. The gloves and mantelet seemed to have been forgotten. Her  demeanor was one of gentleness and modesty. She cast her eyes around as  if expecting to meet a companion, and then quietly sat down on a rude  seat not very far from where we were. I remained for ten minutes  patiently waiting a demonstration of some kind, either from my companion  or the strange appearance near us. But now I began to yield to the  influence of the scene. The sun was declining, and cast a mellow and  saddening light over the various objects around. Gradually as I gazed on  the motionless form of the maiden, I felt impressed with awe, which was  heightened by the solemn manner of my friend, who appeared as much under  the charm as myself. At length I whispered to him, \"For Heaven's sake  tell me what does all this mean?\" A low \"Hush,\" with an expressive  gesture to enforce quiet, was the only response. I made no further  attempt to interrupt the silence, but sat spell-bound, always looking at  the figure, until I was positively afraid to take my eyes from it. Again  the chimes began their peal for the completion of the last quarter. It  was seven o'clock. The moment they ceased, the girl rose from her seat,  glanced slowly, sadly, earnestly around, pressed her hand across her  eyes, and proceeded in the path toward us. We both stood up as she came  near; my friend lifted his hat from his head in the most respectful  manner as the maiden passed, while she in return gazed vacantly on him,  and walking slowly by, disappeared in the direction opposite that from  which she came. We did not remain, but proceeded with a quickened pace  to our lodgings. Arrived there, I asked for an explanation of what we  had witnessed.    \"Do you remember,\" said Partridge, \"Alfred Dervilly?\"    \"Perfectly well. He was your room-mate after I left you last summer, and  twenty times I have been on the point of inquiring for him, but  something at each moment prevented. Where is he?\"    \"Dead.\"    \"Dead! How, when?\"    \"Killed by the apparition yonder.\"    \"Nonsense! Do not talk any more in riddles. Out with what you have to  say about Dervilly and the apparition, as you call it, and this  afternoon's adventure.\"    \"_Bien_, let us light the candles, fasten the doors, close the windows,  and take a fresh cigar.\"    This was soon done, and accommodating himself to his seat in a  comfortable manner, my companion commenced:    \"Yes--you recollect Dervilly of course, and must remember that before  you left us we used to joke him about a fair unknown, who was engaging  so much of his time.\"    \"I had forgotten--but I now recall the circumstance; I remember, I was  walking with him near the 'Garden,' and he made some trivial excuse to  leave me and turn into it. You afterwards told me he had an appointment  there, but I thought little of it.\"    \"Well, I will give you the story as I now have it, quite complete, for I  was partly in Dervilly's confidence, and was with him during his illness  and when he died. He was born in Louisiana, of French parents, who,  after spending some years in America, returned to their native country.  He spoke English fluently, as you know, and when you deserted me we  became very intimate. Then it was I learned how deeply the poor fellow  was in love, actually _in love_. No mere transitory emotion--no  momentary passion for an adventure--no affair of gallantry, was this:  his very being was absorbed--he became wholly changed--it seemed as if  he had bound himself, body and soul, to some spirit of another world. I  never saw, never read, of so engrossing a feeling. At last he confessed  to me. He said he had met, a few months before, at the house of a former  friend of his family, who had been of considerable consequence under the  previous reign, but was now reduced, and lived in obscurity, a creature  of most exquisite shape and feature, who proved on acquaintance to be  possessed with a loveliness of character, a modesty, an irresistible  charm of manner, which took him captive. Dervilly became completely  enamored with Emilie de Coigny. This he discovered to be her name, but  on inquiring of the persons at whose house he first met her, he could  get no satisfactory information; indeed a very singular reserve, as poor  Dervilly thought, was maintained whenever her name was mentioned, so  that he could not, in fact, glean the slightest particulars about her.  This did not prevent him from confessing his passion, for the girl came  frequently to this house, and their acquaintance ripened very fast.  Emilie de Coigny felt for the first time that her heart was occupied,  and all that restlessness of spirit caused by the unconscious longing of  the affections laid at rest, and Alfred Dervilly became the sole object  of her thoughts and of her hopes, if hopes she had. All this, I repeat,  Emilie de Coigny felt; but, singular to say, she hesitated to confess  what was in her heart, even when her lover passionately entreated; it  seemed as if something stood between her and happiness, to which she  feared to allude. It is not easy to deceive the _heart_, and Dervilly  knew, despite the apparent calmness of Emilie, despite her sometimes  cold demeanor, that he was loved in return. But one thing troubled and  perplexed him; one thing filled him with vague fears and apprehensions,  and checked the ecstatic feelings which were ready to overflow his  heart. A mystery hung about this beautiful girl; she claimed no one for  her friend, she spoke of no acquaintances, she never alluded to parents,  or to brother or sister, or other relation; she made no mention of her  home. Besides, a strange sadness, strange in one so young, seemed to  possess her, and to pervade her spirit, and while contemplating that  imperturbable countenance, Dervilly at times felt an awe come over him  for which he could not account, and which for moments subdued even the  force of his passion. It appeared to him then, as if he were under a  spell; but presently, when a gentle smile illumined her face, her eyes  would be turned on him so lovingly, and her look express, as plainly as  look could, that all her trust was in him and in him only. Dervilly  would forget every thing in the raptures of such moments; indeed in his  ecstasy he would be driven almost to madness; for of all characters,\"  continued Partridge, \"hers was the one to set a youth of ardent  temperament absolutely crazy. So matters advanced, or rather I should  say, so time advanced, while affairs did not. It was at this period,\"  said my friend, \"that Dervilly gave me his confidence. Our intimacy had  gradually increased from the hour of your leaving us, and at length he  unbosomed himself completely. My first impression, after hearing his  story, was that the pretty mademoiselle was no more nor less than an  arrant flirt; that her charms were magnified to a lover's vision, and  that the mystery which attended her would turn out to be no mystery at  all--so I treated the case lightly, laughed at his description, called  Mademoiselle Emilie a coquette, and added, a little seriously, that it  was a shame for her to trifle with so warm-hearted a fellow. You know  how grating are the disparaging remarks of a friend about one in whom we  confess to ourselves a deeper interest than we care to acknowledge. What  I had said was kindly intended, but it touched Dervilly to the quick. 'I  did not think you capable,' he exclaimed, 'of thus making light of my  confidence--I find I was deceived--you are at liberty to make as much  sport of me as you will. I have learned a lesson which I shall take care  to remember.' 'You must not speak so,' I said,' I really was not  serious. I take back every word. I would not wound you for the  world--forgive me.' Then we shook hands, and Dervilly assured me I had  misjudged his Emilie; he would ask her permission to introduce me, and I  should see for myself. The permission was never accorded, although  Dervilly urged to Mademoiselle de Coigny, that I was his best and almost  his only friend. She was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3535"],[0,"A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany-Bay (#6)"],[1,"te.    The Bay is very open, and greatly exposed to the fury of the S.E. winds,  which, when they blow, cause a heavy and dangerous swell. It is of  prodigious extent, the principal arm, which takes a S.W. direction,  being not less, including its windings, than twenty four miles from the  capes which form the entrance, according to the report of the French  officers, who took uncommon pains to survey it. At the distance of a  league from the harbour's mouth is a bar, on which at low water, not  more than fifteen feet are to be found. Within this bar, for many miles  up the S.W. arm, is a haven, equal in every respect to any hitherto  known, and in which any number of ships might anchor, secured from all  winds. The country around far exceeds in richness of soil that about  Cape Banks and Point Solander, though unfortunately they resemble each  other in one respect, a scarcity of fresh water.    We found the natives tolerably numerous as we advanced up the river, and  even at the harbour's mouth we had reason to conclude the country more  populous than Mr. Cook thought it. For on the Supply's arrival in the  Bay on the 18th of the month, they were assembled on the beach of the  south shore, to the number of not less than forty persons, shouting  and making many uncouth signs and gestures. This appearance whetted  curiosity to its utmost, but as prudence forbade a few people to venture  wantonly among so great a number, and a party of only six men was  observed on the north shore, the Governor immediately proceeded to land  on that side, in order to take possession of his new territory, and  bring about an intercourse between its old and new masters. The boat in  which his Excellency was, rowed up the harbour, close to the land, for  some distance; the Indians keeping pace with her on the beach. At last  an officer in the boat made signs of a want of water, which it was  judged would indicate his wish of landing. The natives directly  comprehended what he wanted, and pointed to a spot where water could  be procured; on which the boat was immediately pushed in, and a landing  took place. As on the event of this meeting might depend so much of  our future tranquillity, every delicacy on our side was requisite.  The Indians, though timorous, shewed no signs of resentment at the  Governor's going on shore; an interview commenced, in which the conduct  of both parties pleased each other so much, that the strangers returned  to their ships with a much better opinion of the natives than they had  landed with; and the latter seemed highly entertained with their new  acquaintance, from whom they condescended to accept of a looking glass,  some beads, and other toys.    Owing to the lateness of our arrival, it was not my good fortune to go  on shore until three days after this had happened, when I went with a  party to the south side of the harbour, and had scarcely landed five  minutes, when we were met by a dozen Indians, naked as at the moment of  their birth, walking along the beach. Eager to come to a conference, and  yet afraid of giving offence, we advanced with caution towards them,  nor would they, at first approach nearer to us than the distance of  some paces. Both parties were armed; yet an attack seemed as unlikely on  their part, as we knew it to be on our own.    I had at this time a little boy, of not more than seven years of age, in  my hand. The child seemed to attract their attention very much, for they  frequently pointed to him and spoke to each other; and as he was not  frightened, I advanced with him towards them, at the same time baring  his bosom and, shewing the whiteness of the skin. On the cloaths being  removed, they gave a loud exclamation, and one of the party, an old man,  with a long beard, hideously ugly, came close to us. I bade my little  charge not to be afraid, and introduced him to the acquaintance of this  uncouth personage. The Indian, with great gentleness, laid his hand on  the child's hat, and afterwards felt his cloaths, muttering to himself  all the while. I found it necessary, however, by this time to send away  the child, as such a close connection rather alarmed him; and in this,  as the conclusion verified, I gave no offence to the old gentleman.  Indeed it was but putting ourselves on a par with them, as I had  observed from the first, that some youths of their own, though  considerably older than the one with us, were, kept back by the grown  people.    Several more now came up, to whom, we made various presents, but our  toys seemed not to be regarded as very valuable; nor would they for a  long time make any returns to them, though before we parted, a large  club, with a head almost sufficient to fell an ox, was obtained in  exchange for a looking-glass. These people seemed at a loss to know  (probably from our want of beards) of what sex we were, which having  understood, they burst into the most immoderate fits of laughter,  talking to each other at the same time with such rapidity and  vociferation as I had never before heard. After nearly an hour's  conversation by signs and gestures, they repeated several times the word  whurra, which signifies, begone, and walked away from us to the head of  the Bay.    The natives being departed, we set out to observe the country, which,  on inspection, rather disappointed our hopes, being invariably sandy and  unpromising for the purposes of cultivation, though the trees and grass  flourish in great luxuriancy. Close to us was the spring at which Mr.  Cook watered, but we did not think the water very excellent, nor did  it run freely. In the evening we returned on board, not greatly pleased  with the latter part of our discoveries, as it indicated an increase of  those difficulties, which before seemed sufficiently numerous.    Between this and our departure we had several more interviews with the  natives, which ended in so friendly a manner, that we began to entertain  strong hopes of bringing about a connection with them. Our first object  was to win their affections, and our next to convince them of the  superiority we possessed: for without the latter, the former we knew  would be of little importance.    An officer one day prevailed on one of them to place a target, made of  bark, against a tree, which he fired at with a pistol, at the distance  of some paces. The Indians, though terrified at the report, did not run  away, but their astonishment exceeded their alarm, on looking at the  shield which the ball had perforated. As this produced a little shyness,  the officer, to dissipate their fears and remove their jealousy,  whistled the air of Malbrooke, which they appeared highly charmed  with, and imitated him with equal pleasure and readiness. I cannot help  remarking here, what I was afterwards told by Monsieur De Perrouse, that  the natives of California, and throughout all the islands of the Pacific  Ocean, and in short wherever he had been, seemed equally touched and  delighted with this little plaintive air.          CHAPTER IX.        The taking Possession of Port Jackson, with the Disembarkation of the  Marines and Convicts.      Our passage to Port Jackson took up but few hours, and those were spent  far from unpleasantly. The evening was bright, and the prospect before  us such as might justify sanguine expectation. Having passed between the  capes which form its entrance, we found ourselves in a port superior, in  extent and excellency, to all we had seen before. We continued to run  up the harbour about four miles, in a westerly direction, enjoying the  luxuriant prospect of its shores, covered with trees to the water's  edge, among which many of the Indians were frequently seen, till we  arrived at a small snug cove on the southern side, on whose banks the  plan of our operations was destined to commence.    The landing of a part of the marines and convicts took place the next  day, and on the following, the remainder was disembarked. Business  now sat on every brow, and the scene, to an indifferent spectator,  at leisure to contemplate it, would have been highly picturesque and  amusing. In one place, a party cutting down the woods; a second, setting  up a blacksmith's forge; a third, dragging along a load of stones or  provisions; here an officer pitching his marquee, with a detachment of  troops parading on one side of him, and a cook's fire blazing up on  the other. Through the unwearied diligence of those at the head of the  different departments, regularity was, however, soon introduced, and, as  far as the unsettled state of matters would allow, confusion gave place  to system.    Into the head of the cove, on which our establishment is fixed, runs a  small stream of fresh water, which serves to divide the adjacent country  to a little distance, in the direction of north and south. On the  eastern side of this rivulet the Governor fixed his place of residence,  with a large body of convicts encamped near him; and on the western  side was disposed the remaining part of these people, near the marine  encampment. From this last two guards, consisting of two subalterns, as  many serjeants, four corporals, two drummers, and forty-two private men,  under the orders of a Captain of the day, to whom all reports were  made, daily mounted for the public security, with such directions to  use force, in case of necessity, as left no room for those who were the  object of the order, but to remain peaceable, or perish by the bayonet.    As the straggling of the convicts was not only a desertion from the  public labour, but might be attended with ill consequences to the  settlement, in case of their meeting the natives, every care was taken  to prevent it. The Provost Martial with his men was ordered to patrole  the country around, and the convicts informed, that the severest  punishment would be inflicted on transgressors. In spite, however, of  all our precautions, they soon found the road to Botany Bay, in"]]]
