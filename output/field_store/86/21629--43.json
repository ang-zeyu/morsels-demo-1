Much of the success of our modern social movements has been due to  the exertions of the noble Society of Benefactors. The members of  this Society, as we well know, are now mostly men of independent  means. Their chief idea is to bring together and combine social  forces for the public good, which were formerly wasted. The  Society has already existed for two generations, so that our  rising generation is reaping the full benefit of its exertions.  It is chiefly to these exertions that the improved tone of public  opinion is due, and the general, moral and intellectual elevation  of the present day are largely owing to the same cause. In the old  benighted times before 1900 much wealth and ability were, for want  of organization, allowed to run almost to waste as far as the  general good of society was concerned. Men of means led aimless  lives, squandering their riches in foreign cities, or staying at  home to accumulate more and more, forgetting, or never considering  what a powerful means of ameliorating the condition of their fellow  creatures was within their reach. It was not only the lower classes  that needed improvement, but the whole mass of society in all its  aims, ideas and pursuits. Improvement on this large scale would  never have been accomplished by the elaborate theorising and much  preaching of the nineteenth century. Action, bold and fearless  action, was wanted, and until men were found with minds entirely  free from morbid theories, but full of the courage of their new  convictions, the world had to wait in tantalizing suspense for  improvement, always hoping that each new scientific discovery would  enlighten mankind in the desired direction, but always doomed to  be disappointed and to see humanity growing either more savage or  physically weaker, simultaneously with each phase of enlightenment.  These things are perhaps truer of society in Europe, and in some  of the States, than in our young Dominion, where everything was  necessarily in a somewhat inchoate condition. Yet had it not been  for the great men who providentially appeared in our midst--our  history, our manners and customs, our whole career as a nation  would simply have been a repetition of European civilization with  all its defects, failures and vices. Statistics of the period  show that neither in the States nor in Canada, amidst all the  surrounding newness, had there arisen any new social condition  peculiar to this continent which remedied to any extent the evils  rampant in old countries. Lunatic asylums, in ghastly sarcasm on  a self-styled intellectual age, reared their colossal facades and  enclosed their thousands of human wrecks. Huge prisons had to be  built in every large town. Hospitals were frequently crowded with  victims of foul diseases. Great cities abounded with filthy lanes,  alleys, and dwellings like dens of wild beasts. Epidemic diseases  occurred from brutal disregard of sanitary measures. Murder and  suicide were rife. Horrible accidents from preventible causes  occurred daily. Great fires were continually destroying valuable  city property, and ruinous monetary panics happened every few  years. And all this in an age that prided itself on being advanced!  An age that produced the telephone, but crowded up lunatic asylums!  That cabled messages all round the world, but filled its prisons to  the doors! That named the metals in the sun, but could not cleanse  its cities! An age, in fact, that was but one remove from the  unmitigated barbarism of medieval times! How marvellous is the  change wrought by a hundred years! We have not been shocked by  a murder in Canada for more than fifty years, nor has a suicide  been heard of for a very long period. Epidemic diseases belong  to the past. The sewage question, that source of vexation to the  municipalities of old, has been scientifically settled--to the  saving of enormous sums of money, and to the permanent benefit  of the community's health. Malignant scourges, like consumption,  epilepsy, cancer, etc., are never heard of except in less favored  countries. There is but one prison to a province, and that is  sometimes empty. Our cities are all fire-proof, and the night  air is never startled now by the hideous jangling of fire-bells,  arousing the citizens from sleep to view the destruction of their  city. So rational and interesting has daily life become, that mind  and body are constantly in healthy occupation; the fearful nervous  hurry of old times, that broke down so many minds and bodies,  having died out, to give way to a robust force of character which  accomplishes much more with half the fuss. Of course, advantages  such as these, did not spring upon society all at once; they have  come about by comparatively slow degrees.    The first president of the Society of Benefactors, who died some  years ago at an advanced age, was the man who started the new order  of things. When he commenced to give the world the benefit of his  views, he met with a good deal of opposition and ridicule, being  told that the world was going on all right and was improving all  the time, and that if people would only stop preaching and set to  work at doing a little more, things would get better more quickly.  He could not be convinced, however, that society had any grounds  for its satisfaction, but he took the hint about preaching and  stopped his lectures, which he had been giving all through the  country. He then set to work at organization, and as he had  inherited ample means from a millionaire father, he commenced  under good auspices. He went into his work with great eagerness,  gathering together all sorts of people, who held views similar to  his own, though usually in a vague unpractical way, and formed  his first committee of a bishop, celebrated for his enlightened  opinions, two physicians, two lawyers, several wealthy merchants,  and several working men who were good speakers and had influence  among their fellows. His capacity for organization was great,  and his success in gaining over to his side young men of means,  remarkable. From the very beginning the committee never lacked  money. Though they were actuated by purely philanthropic motives,  it was one of their first principles never to sink large sums  of money in any undertaking that would not pay its own expenses  ultimately. There was, therefore, a healthy business-like tone  about whatever they did, that distinguished their efforts from many  well-intentioned, but sickly, undertakings of the same day, which  one after another came to grief, doing nearly as much harm as good.  One of their first works was to buy up lots and dwellings in the  worst districts of Toronto, where miserable shanties and hovels  stood in fetid slums, as foul as any in London or Glasgow. The  hovels and shanties were then torn down, and respectable dwellings  erected in their stead. The unfortunate wretches, the victims of  drink, crime, or thriftlessness, who inhabited such places, were  not turned away to seek a fouler footing elsewhere, but were taken  in hand by the working-men on the committee, and were started  afresh in life with every encouragement. They were generally  permanently rescued from degradation, but if some fell back their  children were saved, and so the next generation was spared a family  of criminals. Montreal was next visited and the same thing done  there; attention was then turned to Quebec and Winnipeg. Successful  attempts were afterwards made to control the liquor traffic, not by  sudden prohibition, which always increased the evil, but by common  sense methods, necessarily somewhat slow, but sure. When the  Society had been at work ten years, there was a very perceptible  diminution in the amount of crime and smaller offences in all their  spheres of action. Police forces could be decreased, and a prison  here and there closed. This had a tendency to lessen the rates,  so the taxpayer became touched in his tenderest part--his pocket.  His heart and his conscience then immediately softened toward the  Society's work, though years of preaching and the existence of all  abominable evils close to his door had failed to move him. When  this point had been reached, the Society began to be looked upon  as one of the great remedial agents of the age, and work was much  easier. One evil after another was grappled with, and in time  subdued. Scientific researches were set on foot in hygiene,  medicine, and every subject from which the community at large  could derive benefit, till in twenty years time so much general  improvement had been effected that Canada's ways of doing things  came to be quoted in other countries as a precedent. Our cities  were the best built, best drained, cleanest and healthiest, and  our city populations the most orderly and most enlightened. The  Society's roll of members now included a great number of eminent  men, and their operations were extended over the whole Dominion,  and works of all kinds were carried on simultaneously in all parts.  Outside the Society, it had become quite fashionable for all  classes to take the most eager interest in everything concerning  the public welfare, so the Dominion continued to prosper and  advance with wonderful rapidity. Thus it happened that we came to  take the lead among nations and have been able to keep foremost  ever since, though with our 93,000,000 we are not by any means  the largest nation.    The improved hygienic conditions under which we live have had the  effect of very largely increasing the population. Our forefathers  in their wisdom spent large sums of money in attracting immigrants  to our shores, but it did not occur to them to increase the  population by preventing people from dying. Very few persons die  now, except from old age, and the tremendous and almost incredible  mortality of old"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4294"],[0,"Tales of Aztlan; The Romance of a Hero of Our Late Spanish-American War, (#6)"],[1,"water, crowds of Mexican people, mostly farmers' wives and  their children, form processions and carry the images of saints round  about the parched fields, chanting hymns and praying for rain.    On this occasion Dona Mercedes availed herself of the chance to extol  the prowess and power of her family's idolized saint, San Miguel. She  said as a rainmaker he had no equal. He disliked and objected to have  himself carried about the fields when there was not a certain sign of  coming rain in the heavens. Her little saint, she said, was too  honorable and too proud to risk the disgrace of failure and bring shame  on her family. Therefore, he would not consent to be carried out in the  fields until kind Nature, through unfailing signs, proclaimed a speedy  downpour. When thunder shook the expectant earth and the first drops of  rain began to fall, then he started on his little business trip and  never had he failed to make it rain copiously. Friends of Don Jose  Lopez, hearing all this talk, were not slow to take advantage of it.  The time for the election of county officials was near and they  promptly placed Don Jose in nomination for the office of the sheriff of  San Miguel County.    When people applied to the parish priest for advice in this matter, he  laughingly told them that he did not know if all these current rumors  were true, quien sabe, but surely nothing was impossible before the  Lord and the blessed saints, and Don Jose being a friend, he advised  them to give him their support, as he was a very good and capable man  who would make an ideal sheriff. To be sure, the Don paid his debts and  was never remiss in his duties to Holy Church.    We crossed over the Raton Mountains and were then in the northern part  of the Territory of New Mexico. What a curious country it was! The  houses were built of adobe or sun-dried brick of earth, in a very  primitive fashion. We seemed to be transported as by magic to the Holy  Land as it was in the lifetime of our Saviour. The architecture of the  buildings, the habits and raiment of the people, the stony soil of the  hills, covered by a thorny and sparse vegetation, the irrigated fertile  land of the valleys, the small fields surrounded by adobe walls--all  this could not fail to remind one vividly of descriptions and pictures  of Old Egypt and Palestine. Here you saw the same dusty, primitive  roads and quaint bullock carts, that were hewn out of soft wood and  joined together with thongs of rawhide and built without the vestige of  iron or other metal. There were the same antediluvian plows, made of  two sticks, as used in ancient Egypt at the time of the Exodus, when  Moses led the Jews out of captivity to their Promised Land. The very  atmosphere, so dry and exhilarating, seemed strange. In this  transparent air, objects which were twenty miles distant seemed to be  no farther than two or three miles at most. In such a country it would  not have surprised anyone to meet the Saviour face to face, riding an  ass or burro over the stony road, followed by His disciples and a  multitude of people, who, with the most implicit faith in the Lord's  power to perform miracles, expected Him to provide them with an  abundance of loaves and fishes. Here we were in a country, a territory  of the United States, which was about eighteen hundred years behind the  civilization of other Christian countries.    As we passed through the many little hamlets and towns, the male  population, who were sitting on the shady side of their houses,  regarded us with lazy curiosity. They were leaning against the cool,  adobe walls, dreaming and smoking cigarettes. The ladies seemed to  possess a livelier disposition and emerged from their houses to gossip  and gather news. They viewed me with the greatest interest and  curiosity and, shifting the mantillas, or rebozos, behind which they  hid their faces after the Moorish fashion, they gazed at me with  shining eyes. And I believe that I found favor with many, for they  would exclaim, \"M'ira que Americanito tan lindo, tan blanco!\" (What a  handsome young American. See what beautiful blue eyes he has and what a  white complexion.) And mothers warned the maidens not to look at me, as  I might have the evil eye. I heard one lady tell her daughter, \"You may  look at him just once, Dolores; oh, see how handsome he is!\" (Valga me,  Dios, que lindo es, pobrecito!)And the way the young lady gazed was a  revelation to me. The fire of her limpid black eyes struck me as a ray  of glorious light. An indescribable thrill, never before known, rose in  my breast and she held me enthralled under a spell which I had not the  least desire to break. And they said that it was I who had the evil  eye! To say that these people were lacking in the virtues and  accomplishments of modern civilization entirely would be a mistake very  easily made indeed by strangers who, on passing through their land, did  not understand their language and were unfamiliar with their social  customs and mode of living. They extended unlimited hospitality to  every one alike, to friend or stranger, to poor or rich. They were most  charmingly polite in their conversation, personal demeanor, and social  intercourse and very charitable and affectionate to their families and  neighbors. These people are happy as compared with other nations in  that they do not worry and fret over the unattainable and doubtful, but  lightheartedly they enjoy the blessings of the present, such as they  are. Therefore, if rightly understood, they may be the best of  companions at times, being sincere and unselfish; so I have found many  of them to be later on, during the intercourse of a more intimate  acquaintance. In the large towns, as Santa Fe, Albuquerque, and Las  Vegas, where there lived a considerable number of Americans, these  would naturally associate together, as, for instance, the American  colony in Paris or Berlin or other foreign places, so as not to be  obliged to mingle with the natives socially any more than they chose.  But in the village where my relatives lived, we had not the alternative  of choosing our own countrymen for social companionship.    Therefore, I realized when I reached my destination that I had to  change my accustomed mode of living and adapt myself to such a life as  people had led eighteen hundred years ago. I thought that if I took the  example of the Saviour's life for my guiding star, I would certainly  get along very well. Undoubtedly this would have sufficed in a  spiritual sense, but I found that it would be impractical as applied to  my temporal welfare and the requirements of the present time. For I  could not perform miracles nor could I live as the Saviour had done,  roaming over the country and teaching the natives. And then, seeing  that there were so many Jews in New Mexico, I feared they might attempt  to crucify me and I did not relish the thought. Therefore I accepted  King Solomon's life as the next best one to emulate. While I was  greatly handicapped by not possessing the riches of the great old king,  I fancied that I had a plenty of his wisdom, and although I could not  cut as wide a swath as he had done, I did well enough under the  circumstances. I was, of course, limited to a vastly smaller scale in  the pursuit and enjoyment of the many good things to be had in New  Mexico. Ever joyous, free from care, I drifted in my voyage of life  with the stream of hope over the shining waters of a happy and  delightful youth.          CHAPTER V.    ON THE RIO GRANDE. AN ABSTRACT OF THE AUTHOR'S GENEALOGY OF MATERNAL  LINEAGE      In the month of September I came to the end of my journey, as I arrived  on the Rio Abajo. Now I began the second chapter of my life's voyage.  No longer a precocious child, I was growing to young manhood and was  not lacking in those qualities which are essential in the successful  performance of life's continual struggle. I was heartily welcomed by my  uncle, my mother's brother. My aunt, poor lady, had, of course, given  me up as lost and greeted me with joyful admiration. But she did not  venture close to me, for in me she saw a strong, lusty young man,  bright eyed, alert-looking and carrying a deadly army revolver and  wicked hunting knife at his belt. To be sure, I was suntanned and  graybacked beyond comparison with the dust of a thousand miles of wagon  road.    As I had expected, I found my uncle in very prosperous circumstances,  in a commercial sense. And no wonder, for he was a tall, fine-looking  man, under forty and overflowing with energy and personal magnetism.  And my mother's little family tree did the rest--aye, surely, it was  not to be sneezed at, as will be presently seen.    Of course, mother traced her ancestral lineage, as all other people do,  to Adam and Eve in general, but in particular she claimed descent from  those ancient heroes of the Northland, the Vikings. These daring rovers  of the seas were really a right jolly set of men. In their small  galleys they roamed the trackless seas, undaunted alike by the terrors  of the hurricane as by the perils of unknown shores. On whatever coast  they chanced--finding it inhabited, they landed, fought off the men and  captured their women. They sacked villages and plundered towns, and  loading their ships with booty, they set sail joyfully, homeward bound  for the shores of the misty North Sea, the shallow German Ocean. Here  they had a number of retreats and strongholds. There was Helgoland, the  mysterious island; Cuxhaven, at the mouth of the river Elbe; Buxtehude,  notoriously known from a very peculiar ferocious breed of dogs; Norse  Loch on the coast of Holstein, and numerous other locker, or inlets,  hard to find, harder to enter when found and hardest to pronounce. In  the course of time these rovers were visited by saintly Christian  missionaries and, like all other Saxon tribes, they accepted the light  of the Christian Gospel. They saw the"]]]
