At night in Aberfoyle  after such a day, I witnessed a clear sunset and a fair evening sky; in  the morning when I arose, the lowlands along the river were inundated  and a thousand cascades, large and small, were leaping down the  mountain-highlands, and rain was falling in heavy masses. Within an hour  afterwards, as I travelled on towards Stirling, the rain and wind  ceased, and there settled down over all the land cloud-masses so  inky-black that they seemed like the fancies of some horrible dream.  Then like massed armies they began to move to their mountain-strongholds,  and stood there; while from the east came perfect weather and a flood of  brilliant sunshine.    And in the Highlands from Stirling to Inverness what magic, what  changing colours and shadows there were on the age-worn treeless hills,  and in the valleys with their clear, pure streams receiving tribute from  unnumbered little rills and springs, some dropping water drop by drop as  though it were fairy-distilled; and everywhere the heather giving to the  mountain-landscape a hue of rich purplish-brown, and to the air an odour  of aromatic fragrance.    On to the north-west beyond Inverness there is the same kind of a  treeless highland country; and then after a few hours of travel one  looks out across the water from Kyle and beholds Skye, where Cuchulainn  is by some believed to have passed his young manhood learning feats of  arms from fairy women,--Skye, dark, mountainous, majestic, with its  waterfalls turning to white spray as they tumble from cliff to cliff  into the sound, from out the clouds that hide their mountain-summit  sources.    In the Outer Hebrides, as in the Aranmore Islands off West Ireland,  influences are at work on the Celtic imagination quite different from  those in Skye and its neighbouring islands. Mountainous billows which  have travelled from afar out of the mysterious watery waste find their  first impediment on the west of these isolated Hebridean isles, and they  fling themselves like mad things in full fury against the wild rocky  islets fringing the coast. White spray flashes in unearthly forms over  the highest cliff, and the unrestrained hurricane whirls it far inland.  Ocean's eternally murmuring sounds set up a responsive vibration in the  soul of the peasant, as he in solitude drives home his flocks amid the  weird gloaming at the end of a December day; and, later, when he sits  brooding in his humble cottage at night, in the fitful flickering of a  peat fire, he has a mystic consciousness that deep down in his being  there is a more divine music compared with which that of external nature  is but a symbol and an echo; and, as he stirs the glowing peat-embers,  phantoms from an irretrievable past seem to be sitting with him on the  edge of the half-circle of dying light. Maybe there are skin-clad  huntsmen of the sea and land, with spears and knives of bone and flint  and shaggy sleeping dogs, or fearless sea-rovers resting wearily on  shields of brilliant bronze, or maybe Celtic warriors fierce and bold;  and then he understands that his past and his present are one.    Commonly there is the thickest day-darkness when the driving storms come  in from the Atlantic, or when dense fog covers sea and land; and, again,  there are melancholy sea-winds moaning across from shore to shore,  bending the bushes of the purple heather. At other times there is a  sparkle of the brightest sunshine on the ocean waves, a fierceness  foreign to the more peaceful Highlands; and then again a dead silence  prevails at sunrise and at sunset if one be on the mountains, or, if on  the shore, no sound is heard save the rhythmical beat of the waves, and  now and then the hoarse cry of a sea-bird. All these contrasted  conditions may be seen in one day, or each may endure for a day; and the  dark days last nearly all the winter. And then it is, during the long  winter, that the crofters and fisher-folk congregate night after night  in a different neighbour's house to tell about fairies and ghosts, and  to repeat all those old legends so dear to the heart of the Celt.  Perhaps every one present has heard the same story or legend a hundred  times, yet it is always listened to and told as though it were the  latest bulletin of some great world-stirring event. Over those little  islands, so far away to the north, out on the edge of the world, in  winter-time darkness settles down at four o'clock or even earlier; and  the islanders hurry through with their dinner of fish and oat-bread so  as not to miss hearing the first story. When the company has gathered  from far and near, pipes are re-filled and lit and the peat is heaped  up, for the story-telling is not likely to end before midnight. 'The  house is roomy and clean, if homely, with its bright peat fire in the  middle of the floor. There are many present--men and women, boys and  girls. All the women are seated, and most of the men. Girls are crouched  between the knees of fathers or brothers or friends, while boys are  perched wherever--boy-like--they can climb. The houseman is twisting  twigs of heather into ropes to hold down thatch, a neighbour crofter is  twining quicken root into cords to tie cows, while another is plaiting  bent grass into baskets to hold meal. The housewife is spinning, a  daughter is carding, another daughter is teazing, while a third  daughter, supposed to be working, is away in the background conversing  in low whispers with the son of a neighbouring crofter. Neighbour wives  and neighbour daughters are knitting, sewing, or embroidering.'[5] Then  when the bad weather for fishing has been fully discussed by the men,  and the latest gossip by the women, and the foolish talk of the youths  and maidens in the corners is finished, the one who occupies the chair  of honour in the midst of the _ceilidh_[6] looks around to be sure that  everybody is comfortable and ready; and, as his first story begins, even  the babes by instinct cease their noise and crying, and young and old  bend forward eagerly to hear every word. It does not matter if some of  the boys and girls do topple over asleep, or even some of the older folk  as the hour gets late; the tales meet no interruption in their even,  unbroken flow. And here we have the most Celtic and the most natural  environments which the Fairy-Faith enjoys in Scotland.    There are still the Southern Highlands in the country around Oban, and  the islands near them; and of all these isles none is so picturesque in  history as the one Columba loved so well. Though Iona enjoys less of the  wildness of the Hebrides furthest west, it has their storm-winds and  fogs and dark days, and their strangeness of isolation. On it, as  Adamnan tells us, the holy man fought with black demons who came to  invade his monastery, and saw angelic hosts; and when the angels took  his soul at midnight in that little chapel by the sea-shore there was a  mystic light which illuminated all the altar like the brightest  sunshine. But nowadays, where the saint saw demons and angels the  Islanders see ghosts and 'good people', and when one of these islanders  is taken in death it is not by angels--it is by fairies.      IN THE ISLE OF MAN    In the midst of the Irish Sea, almost equidistant from Ireland,  Scotland, and Wales, and concentrating in itself the psychical and  magnetic influences from these three Celtic lands, and from Celto-Saxon  England too, lies the beautiful kingdom of the great Tuatha De Danann  god, Manannan Mac Lir, or, as his loyal Manx subjects prefer to call  him, Mannanan-Beg-Mac-y-Leir. In no other land of the Celt does Nature  show so many moods and contrasts, such perfect repose at one time and at  another time the mightiness of its unloosed powers, when the baffled sea  throws itself angrily against a high rock-bound coast, as wild and  almost as weather-worn as the western coasts of Ireland and the  Hebrides.    But it is Nature's calmer moods which have greater effect upon the Manx  people: on the summit of his ancient stronghold, South Barrule Mountain,  the god Manannan yet dwells invisible to mortal eyes, and whenever on a  warm day he throws off his magic mist-blanket with which he is wont to  cover the whole island, the golden gorse or purple heather blossoms  become musical with the hum of bees, and sway gently on breezes made  balmy by the tropical warmth of an ocean stream flowing from the far  distant Mexican shores of a New World. Then in many a moist and  sweet-smelling glen, pure and verdant, land-birds in rejoicing bands add  to the harmony of sound, as they gather on the newly-ploughed field or  dip themselves in the clear water of the tinkling brook; and from the  cliffs and rocky islets on the coast comes the echo of the multitudinous  chorus of sea-birds. At sunset, on such a day, as evening calmness  settles down, weird mountain shadows begin to move across the  dimly-lighted glens; and when darkness has fallen, there is a mystic  stillness, broken only by the ceaseless throbbing of the sea-waves, the  flow of brooks, and the voices of the night.    In the moorland solitudes, even by day, there sometimes broods a deeper  silence, which is yet more potent and full of meaning for the peasant,  as under its spell he beholds the peaceful vision, happy and sunlit, of  sea and land, of gentle mountains falling away in land-waves into  well-tilled plains and fertile valleys; and he comes to feel  instinctively the old Druidic Fires relit within his heart, and perhaps  unconsciously he worships there in Nature's Temple. The natural beauty  without awakens the divine beauty within, and for a second of time he,  out of his subconsciousness, is conscious that in Nature there are  beings and inaudible voices which have no existence for the flippant  pleasure-seeking crowds who come and go.

These poor, unprotected mothers and  their babies I am sure were potent factors in my education as a  militant. In fact, all the women I came in contact with in the workhouse  contributed to that education. Very soon after I went on the board I saw  that the class of old women who came into the workhouse were in many  ways superior to the kind of old men who came into the workhouse. One  could not help noticing it. They were, to begin with, more industrious.  In fact, it was quite touching to see their industry and patience. Old  women, over sixty and seventy years of age, did most of the work of that  place, most of the sewing, most of the things that kept the house clean  and which supplied the inmates with clothing. I found that the old men  were different. One could not get very much work out of them. They liked  to stop in the oakum picking-room, where they were allowed to smoke;  but as to real work, very little was done by our old men.    I began to make inquiries about these old women. I found that the  majority of them were not women who had been dissolute, who had been  criminal, but women who had lead perfectly respectable lives, either as  wives and mothers, or as single women earning their own living. A great  many were of the domestic-servant class, who had not married, who had  lost their employment, and had reached a time of life when it was  impossible to get more employment. It was through no fault of their own,  but simply because they had never earned enough to save. The average  wage of working women in England is less than two dollars a week. On  this pittance it is difficult enough to keep alive, and of course it is  impossible to save. Every one who knows anything about conditions under  which our working women live knows that few of them can ever hope to put  by enough to keep them in old age. Besides, the average working woman  has to support others than herself. How can she save?    Some of our old women were married. Many of them, I found, were widows  of skilled artisans who had had pensions from their unions, but the  pensions had died with the men. These women, who had given up the power  to work for themselves, and had devoted themselves to working for their  husbands and children, were left penniless. There was nothing for them  to do but to go into the workhouse. Many of them were widows of men who  had served their country in the army or the navy. The men had had  pensions from the government, but the pensions had died with them, and  so the women were in the workhouse.    We shall not in future, I hope, find so many respectable old women in  English workhouses. We have an old-age pension law now, which allows old  women as well as old men the sum of five shillings--$1.20--a week;  hardly enough to live on, but enough to enable the poor to keep their  old fathers and mothers out of the workhouse without starving themselves  or their children. But when I was a Poor Law Guardian there was simply  nothing to do with a woman when her life of toil ceased except make a  pauper of her.    I wish I had space to tell you of other tragedies of women I witnessed  while I was on that board. In our out-relief department, which exists  chiefly for able-bodied poor and dependent persons, I was brought into  contact with widows who were struggling desperately to keep their homes  and families together. The law allowed these women relief of a certain  very inadequate kind, but for herself and one child it offered no relief  except the workhouse. Even if the woman had a baby at her breast she was  regarded, under the law, as an able-bodied man. Women, we are told,  should stay at home and take care of their children. I used to astound  my men colleagues by saying to them: \"When women have the vote they will  see that mothers _can_ stay at home and care for their children. You men  have made it impossible for these mothers to do that.\"    I am convinced that the enfranchised woman will find many ways in which  to lessen, at least, the curse of poverty. Women have more practical  ideas about relief, and especially of prevention of dire poverty, than  men display. I was struck with this whenever I attended the District  Conferences and the annual Poor Law Union Meetings. In our discussions  the women showed themselves much more capable, much more resourceful,  than the men. I remember two papers which I prepared and which caused  considerable discussion. One of these was on the Duties of Guardians in  Times of Unemployment, in which I pointed out that the government had  one reserve of employment for men which could always be used. We have,  on our northwest coast, a constant washing away of the fore shore. Every  once in a while the question of coast reclamation comes up for  discussion, but I had never heard any man suggest coast reclamation as a  means of giving the unemployed relief.      In 1898 I suffered an irreparable loss in the death of my husband. His  death occurred suddenly and left me with the heavy responsibility of  caring for a family of children, the eldest only seventeen years of age.  I resigned my place on the Board of Guardians, and was almost  immediately appointed to the salaried office of Registrar of Births and  Deaths in Manchester. We have registrars of births, deaths and marriages  in England, but since the act establishing the last named contains the  words \"male person,\" a woman may not be appointed a registrar of  marriages. The head of this department of the government is the  registrar-general, with offices at Somerset House, London, where all  vital statistics are returned and all records filed.    It was my duty as registrar of births and deaths to act as chief census  officer of my district; I was obliged to receive all returns of births  and deaths, record them, and send my books quarterly to the office of  the registrar-general. My district was in a working-class quarter, and  on this account I instituted evening office hours twice a week. It was  touching to observe how glad the women were to have a woman registrar to  go to. They used to tell me their stories, dreadful stories some of  them, and all of them pathetic with that patient and uncomplaining  pathos of poverty. Even after my experience on the Board of Guardians, I  was shocked to be reminded over and over again of the little respect  there was in the world for women and children. I have had little girls  of thirteen come to my office to register the births of their babies,  illegitimate, of course. In many of these cases I found that the child's  own father or some near male relative was responsible for her state.  There was nothing that could be done in most cases. The age of consent  in England is sixteen years, but a man can always claim that he thought  the girl was over sixteen. During my term of office a very young mother  of an illegitimate child exposed her baby, and it died. The girl was  tried for murder and was sentenced to death. This was afterwards  commuted, it is true, but the unhappy child had the horrible experience  of the trial and the sentence \"to be hanged by the neck, until you are  dead.\" The wretch who was, from the point of view of justice, the real  murderer of the baby, received no punishment at all.    I needed only one more experience after this one, only one more contact  with the life of my time and the position of women, to convince me that  if civilisation is to advance at all in the future, it must be through  the help of women, women freed of their political shackles, women with  full power to work their will in society. In 1900 I was asked to stand  as a candidate for the Manchester School Board. The schools were then  under the old law, and the school boards were very active bodies. They  administered the Elementary Education Act, bought school sites, erected  buildings, employed and paid teachers. The school code and the  curriculum were framed by the Board of Education, which is part of the  central government. Of course this was absurd. A body of men in London  could not possibly realise all the needs of boys and girls in remote  parts of England. But so it was.    As a member of the school board I very soon found that the teachers,  working people of the higher grade, were in exactly the same position as  the working people of the lower grades. That is, the men had all the  advantage. Teachers had a representative in the school board councils.  Of course that representative was a man teacher, and equally of course,  he gave preference to the interests of the men teachers. Men teachers  received much higher salaries than the women, although many of the  women, in addition to their regular class work, had to teach sewing and  domestic science into the bargain. They received no extra pay for their  extra work. In spite of this added burden, and in spite of the lower  salaries received, I found that the women cared a great deal more about  their work, and a great deal more about the children than the men. It  was a winter when there was a great deal of poverty and unemployment in  Manchester. I found that the women teachers were spending their slender  salaries to provide regular dinners for destitute children, and were  giving up their time to waiting on them and seeing that they were  nourished. They said to me, quite simply: \"You see, the little things  are too badly off to study their lessons. We have to feed them before we  can teach them.\"    Well, instead of seeing that women care more for schools and school  children than men do and should therefore have more power in education,  the Parliament of 1900 actually passed a law which took education in  England entirely out of the hands of women. This law abolished the  school board altogether and placed the administration of schools in the  hands of the municipalities. Certain corporations had formerly made  certain grants to technical education--Manchester had built a  magnificent"]]]
