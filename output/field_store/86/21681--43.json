The drays from the  railroad shake the iron portals as they rumble through, and the  clerks step out on the landing to receive the goods. The court is  obstructed with cases, baskets, straw, wrappers, and pack-cloth. One  is conscious of being in a factory. But at night, in the death-like  stillness, with the winter moon casting and tangling fantastic  shadows through the confused intricacy of all these roofs, the old  dwelling of the Nesmonds resumes its lordly air. The court of honor  seems to expand; the wrought-iron of the balconies looks like fine  lace; the old stairway is full of shadows in the uncertain light, of  mysterious recesses like those of a cathedral; there are empty niches  and half concealed steps that suggest an altar.    On this particular night M. Majesté is deeply impressed with the  grandeur of his dwelling. The echo of his own footsteps startles  him as he crosses the great deserted court. The stairway seems even  broader than usual, and peculiarly heavy to climb. But that is the  Christmas supper, no doubt. At the first landing he stops to take  breath; he leans on one of the window-sills. So much for living in  a historic mansion! M. Majesté is certainly not a poet, oh, no! and  still as he gazes around him at this lordly old place, which seems to  be sleeping so peacefully under its benumbed, snow-hooded roofs, as  he looks down into this grand, aristocratic old court which the moon  floods with a bluish light, weird fancies flash through his brain.    \"Suppose the Nesmonds should take it into their heads to come back,  eh?\"    Just then there is a violent pull at the door-bell. The portal swings  open instantly, so brusquely that it puts out the light of the  lamp-post in the court. From the shadow of the doorway come rustling  sounds and confused whisperings. There seems to be a great crowd  wrangling and jostling to get in. There are footmen, a multitude  of footmen, coaches with glass panes glimmering in the moonlight,  sedan-chairs swaying lightly between two torches whose long flames  writhe and twist in the draught of the doorway. In a second the court  is crowded; but at the foot of the stairway the confusion ceases.  People alight from the coaches, recognize one another, smile, bow,  and make their way up the stairs, chatting softly as though they were  quite familiar with the house. There is much rustling of silks and  clanking of swords on the landing, and billows of white hair, heavy  and dull with powder. Through the faint sound of the airy tread comes  a thin, high quiver of voices and little peals of laughter that has  lost its vibration. All these people seem old, very old,--eyes that  have lost their fire, slumbering jewels that have lost their light,  antique brocades that shimmer with a subdued iridescence in the light  of the torches, and above it all a thin mist of powder that rises at  every courtesy from the white-puffed scaffoldings of these stately  heads. In a moment the place seems to be haunted. Torches glitter  from window to window and up and down the curving stairways; the very  dormers in the mansard twinkle with joy and life. The whole mansion  is ablaze with light, as though a great burst of sunset had set its  windows aglow.    \"Merciful saints! they will set the house on fire!\" thinks M.  Majesté; and having recovered from his stupor, he makes an effort to  shake the numbness from his legs, and hurries down into the court,  where the footmen have just lighted a great bonfire. M. Majesté goes  up to them, speaks to them; but they do not answer; they stand there  chatting among themselves softly, and not the faintest breath issues  from their lips into the freezing shadow of the night. M. Majesté  is somewhat put out. He is reassured, however, when he realizes that  this great fire with its long straight flames is a most peculiar  fire, which emits no heat,--which simply glows, but does not burn.  The good man therefore sets his mind at rest, goes upstairs again,  and makes his way into the store.    These stores on the first floor must have been grand reception-halls  in their day. Particles of tarnished gold still cling to the angles.  Mythological frescos circle about the ceilings, wind round the  mirrors, hover above the doorways, vague and subdued, like bygone  memories. Unfortunately there are no curtains or furniture anywhere,  nothing but baskets, great cases filled with leaden-headed siphons,  and the withered limb of an old lilac bush rising in black outline  outside the window. M. Majesté enters. He finds the rooms crowded and  brilliantly illumined. He bows, but nobody seems to notice him. The  women, in their satin wraps, lean on their cavaliers' arms and flirt  with ceremonious, mincing graces. They promenade, chat, separate into  groups. All these old marquises really seem quite at home. One little  shade stops, all of a quiver, before a painted pier-glass; then she  glances smilingly at a Diana that rises out of the wood-work, lithe  and roseate, with a crescent on her brow.    \"This is I; think of it! And here I am!\"    \"Nesmond, come and see your crest!\" and they laugh immoderately at  the sight of the Nesmond coat-of-arms displayed on the wrappers above  the name of Majesté, Jr.    \"Ha, ha, ha! Majesté! There are some majesties left in France after  all, then!\"    And there is no end of merriment, of mincing coquetries. Little  trills of laughter rise like the notes of a flute in the air. Some  one exclaims suddenly,--    \"Champagne! champagne!\"    \"Nonsense!\"    \"Yes, indeed, champagne. Come, Countess, what say you to a little  Christmas supper?\"    They have mistaken M. Majesté's seltzer-water for champagne. They  naturally find it somewhat flat. But these poor little ghosts have  such unsteady heads! The foam of the seltzer-water somehow excites  them and makes them feel like dancing. Minuets are immediately  organized. Four rare violinists provided by Nesmond strike out with  an old melody by Rameau, full of triplets, quaint and melancholy in  its vivacity; and you should see the pretty little grandmothers turn  slowly and bow gravely in time with the music.    Their very finery seems freshened and rejuvenated by the sound,  and so do the waistcoats of cloth-of-gold, the brocaded coats and  diamond-buckled shoes. The panels themselves seem to awake. The old  mirror, scratched and dim, which has stood encased in the wall for  over two hundred years, recognizes them all, glows softly upon them,  showing them their own images with a pale vagueness like a tender  regret.    In the midst of all this elegance M. Majesté feels somewhat ill at  ease. He is huddled in a corner, and looks on from behind a case of  bottles. But gradually the day dawns. Through the glass doors of  the store one can see the court growing light, then the top of the  windows, then all one side of the great parlor. Before the light of  day the figures melt and disappear. The four little violinists alone  are belated in a corner; and M. Majesté watches them evaporate as the  daylight creeps upon them. In the court below he can just see the  vague form of a sedan-chair, a powdered head sprinkled with emeralds,  and the last spark of a torch that a lackey has dropped on the  pavement, and which blends with the sparks from the wheels of a dray,  rumbling in noisily through the open portals.    [Illustration]          THE PRINCESS AND THE RAGAMUFFIN.    From the Spanish of BENITO PÉREZ GALDÓS.      I.    Pacorrito Migajas was a great character. He stood a trifle over two  feet from the ground, and had just turned his seventh year. His skin  was tanned by the sun and the wind, and his wizened face suggested  a dwarf rather than a child. His eyes, adorned with long eyelashes  that looked like black wires, were full of vitality and resplendent  with mischief. His mouth was amazing in its ugliness; and his ears,  strangely like those of a faun, seemed to have been attached to his  face, rather than to have grown there. He was dressed in a shirt  of every possible shade of grime, and a pair of patchwork trousers  upheld by a single suspender. In the winter he wore a coat which he  had inherited from his grandfather. The sleeves had been cut off at  the elbow, and Pacorrito considered it a handsome fit, as overcoats  go. A rag which aspired to be a muffler was wound like a snake round  and round his neck, and on his head he wore a cap which he had picked  up at the Rastro. He had little use for shoes, which he considered  in the light of a hindrance, neither did he wear stockings, having a  great aversion to the roughness of the threads.    Pacorrito's ancestors could not have been more illustrious. His  father, accused of having attempted to make his way into a house  through the drain, went to Ceuta for a change of climate, and  died there. His mother, a great lady who for many years kept a  chestnut-stand in the Cava de San Miguel, had also fallen somehow  into the hands of the authorities, and after much ado with judges and  notaries, had repaired to the Alcalá jail. Pacorrito had one sister,  but this last relative had deserted her post at the tobacco factory  and flown to Sevilla in amorous pursuit of an artillery officer. Up  to the present she has not returned.    Migajas was therefore alone in the world, with no protection but that  of God, and no guide but his own will.      II.    The pious reader need not fancy that Pacorrito was in the least  daunted or disturbed at finding himself alone; not he. In his brief  career he had had occasion to study the ways of the world, and he  knew a thing or two about the fraud and vanity of life. He filled  himself with energy and confronted the situation like a hero. He was  on excellent terms with numerous persons of his age and quality, and  even with bearded men, who seemed disposed to protect him, so by dint  of push he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47338"],[0,"Kate Vernon: A Tale. Vol. 1 (of 3) (#6)"],[1,"few laughing words on my impetuosity, \"There is something in  your spirit I can well sympathise with, and I hope you will do me the  favour to accompany your brother officers, Captain Dashwood and Mr.  Hauton, whom I expect next week for a little shooting at Dungar.\"  I readily accepted; and often, while the regiment remained in that  part of the world, enjoyed the hospitality of Dungar, and the real  pleasure of Colonel Vernon's society.    Of a high family, which formerly possessed an immense territory, now  sadly dwindled, he had only just retired from the command of the  County Militia, having never held higher rank than that of Captain  in the Army. When I last saw him, though no longer keeping hounds,  his house was a model of all that was most agreeable and luxurious,  notwithstanding unpleasant remarks as to the incumbrances of his  estates, rife almost at his own table.    To return from this long digression. Colonel Vernon had always held an  indisputable place in my memory, not only for the kindness and pleasure  I had received from him, but as a model of chivalrous courtesy. With  the utmost amazement I now recognised him, and determined to renew  an acquaintance; crossing the street with this intention, just as I  reached him, a passing workman jostled him rudely and shook his gold  headed cane from his grasp; seizing this opportunity for accosting  him, I stooped for the cane and restored it to him. Raising his hat,  and bowing with _sauve_ grace, he said, \"Sir, you are very good, I am  extremely obliged to you.\"    I bowed, smiled, and still standing in front of him, said, \"I fear sir  you have forgotten my name as well as my face, nevertheless, Fred.  Egerton, of the -- Dragoons, is most happy to see Colonel Vernon  looking as well as he did ten years ago.\"    \"Egerton, God bless my soul! so it is. My dear boy, I am truly glad to  see you. I remember you perfectly, and 'gad, it takes ten years from my  life to see you again.\"    And we were shaking hands with a forty-horse power of cordiality; then  turning with me he took my arm.    \"But what lucky wind has blown you here, Egerton?\"    \"Why, we are quartered at Carrington, and I am here on a sketching  expedition; imagine my surprise and pleasure at recognising you in  about the last place in the world I should have anticipated such a  rencontre; but tell me, how goes the world at beautiful Dungar?\"    I felt a sudden pressure on my arm, \"Ah! my dear Egerton, I really do  not know; poor Dungar has not been mine for several years; in short,  I am living very quietly here; and having led the usual life of an  Irish proprietor, short and sweet, I am now atoning for it; though God  forgive the word, I am very happy, and you must come and dine with  me in my crib, small as it is, for by gad I am very glad to see you,  though till you spoke I did not recognise you, you have grown so dark  and, I fancy, taller.\"    \"And your little granddaughter? Was there not one with you in Ireland,  a pretty fair-haired child, who was always in mischief?\" \"Yes, yes,\"  said he with a pleasant sparkle of the eye, \"I'll introduce you to  her.\" Talking copiously of past times and people, sometimes laughing  at some droll reminiscence, sometimes glancing off from topics I could  see made my companion wince, he directed my steps towards an old  gateway, passing through which we pursued a narrow lane, between two  rows of ancient red stone houses, opening on a road which I recognized,  by a flight of steps descending from the city wall and the large old  church in front, to be the same I had observed on my first visit.  A low wall surrounded the church yard, in which were few graves, a  great deal of grass, and several venerable yew trees; altogether a  good sized enclosure. We entered it through a wrought-iron gate, of  curiously ancient workmanship, standing between two large yew trees,  and wide open; opposite to which a low deep arch of vast thickness  showed the church door within. A square and lofty tower rose beside  the church, independently, from the ground, at the western extremity  where we entered; and the edifice itself, ponderous looking and most  picturesquely irregular, stretched out for a considerable distance.    Following my companion by the path along the side of the church, and  listening to and answering his observations, my eye took in, without  an effort, these details, and reaching the east end, I perceived  that much of this portion of the building was in ruins, although the  exterior walls were still in tolerable preservation; several branches  of trees waved over them, and here was a small but perfect round arch,  surmounted by some old Gothic inscription I had not time to decipher,  and filled up by a green wicket clenched with nails, which my kind old  friend pushed open, and, shaking me by the hand, welcomed me to his new  but diminutive territory with true Irish warmth, and yet with a tinge  of melancholy. I could only return his pressure in silence, as I stood  enchanted with the beauty of the spot into which I was ushered.    This end of the building had, as I have said, fallen into decay, and  the present east window was some fifty yards within the old one, and  peeped out through the feathery foliage of a splendid ash and several  acacias, which grew almost against it, while the rugged red wall was  covered with ivy and other creepers. The little enclosure formed by  the ruined walls was divided in two by a row of three low ornamented  arches, somewhat broken, and beyond these rose clear against the sky  the lace-like tracery of the old window, much of which remained,  together with the remnant of a round tower.    At the side where we entered, a magnificent spreading elm filled the  inner enclosure with grace and shade, and both were carpeted with  the greenest, softest grass; a few red and white roses mixed with  evergreens adorning the larger of the two enclosures, and a straight  neatly gravelled walk led to a door opposite, half glass, the entrance  to a red stone cottage forming one side of the quadrangle; a time-worn  Madonna and Child and a quaint-looking and rather plump Saint, saying  his prayers, stood sentry right and left of this humble portal,  advancing to which the Colonel rung the bell, observing, \"You admire  this? Kate will be enchanted; it was the Vicar's residence, but the  present man is too great for so small a place, and lets me rent it  This is not a common church, but managed I do not quite know how. They  call it St. Augustine's Priory, and this cottage is known as the Priory  House.\"    As the door opened, \"Walk in; is Miss Kate at home, Nelly?\"    This question was addressed to the servant, a fat dignified old lady  in black, with an apron and cap of irreproachable whiteness; there  was a volume of character in her rather wide mouth, slightly drawn at  the corners, and the decided _nez retroussé_ bespoke a somewhat sharp  temper.    \"No, sir, she tuck a roll of music, and Cormac went with her; I dare  say she'll be in soon.\"    \"Well, we'll wait for her,\" said Vernon, \"but by the bye, Nelly, don't  you remember this gentleman at all? he used to be often at Dungar.\"    \"Why, now,\" she returned with a keen glance; \"I _dis_remember; sure  there was thousands of them, all with hair on their faces, just like  his honour; but at all ivints ye're heartily welcome, sir, for its  seldom I see a gentleman, barring the masther.\" Bowing and thanking  her for the compliment, I followed Colonel Vernon across a little  square arched hall, its only light derived from the glass door, to one  opposite, leading into a pretty modern room, to which a bow window,  occupying one entire side, gave light and space; it looked into a small  pleasure ground where towered an ancient and gigantic oak, beyond which  the bank sloped steeply to the river, winding blue and peaceful at its  foot. The room was redolent of heliotrope and mignionette, and gay with  brilliant dahlias, fuchsias, and, though late in the season, roses; a  pianoforte, some worked chairs, and a print of John Anderson my Joe,  then not quite so common as now, over the mantle-piece, were the only  articles in the room at all removed from the simplest and commonest  style of furniture. Yet a spirit of grace and refinement pervaded all  its arrangements, and breathed, I know not what of purity and peace,  into its atmosphere. All this time I was expressing my admiration of  his domicile to my friend, the Colonel, who was evidently delighted  by my encomiums. \"Yes,\" he said, \"quiet and snug, this and the dining  room were additions by a wealthy rector some thirty years ago, but  the little hall was formerly an entrance into a large confessional or  penitentiary, and so was the outer gate leading to it; Kate can tell  the whole story; I know it very imperfectly. By the way, what has  become of that curious fellow with the stutter, that used always to  forget the most essential part of every story?\"    And we again plunged into reminiscences; half an hour must have  elapsed, and I was just meditating some enquiries as to the existence  in A----, of a party such as I had met at Carrington, when something  scratched at the door; the handle turned, it opened, and in walked, in  shawl and bonnet, but in unmistakeable _propriâ personâ_, my beautiful  incognita, my nameless partner, the object of my search! followed by a  huge majestic looking dog, shaggy and stern. I had risen as the door  opened, and now stood transfixed, while the lady started, and blushed  to the eyes.    \"Kate, my love,\" said her grandfather, \"let me present Captain Egerton,  an old acquaintance of mine.\"    \"And of mine too, grandpapa,\" she replied, with a smile indescribably  arch, and recovering herself completely, \"I had the pleasure of meeting  Captain Egerton last week at Carrington, and it appears we had known  each other long ago.\"    \"Oh! was this the gentleman; how extraordinary,\" and he"]]]
