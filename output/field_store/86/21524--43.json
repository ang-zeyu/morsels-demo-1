[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35413"],[0,"A Review of the Middle American Tree Frogs of the Genus Ptychohyla (#6)"],[1,"am-colored  crescent-shaped mark on posterior edge of body and anterior part of  caudal musculature, bordered posteriorly by dark brown blotch;  scattered brown flecks on caudal musculature and posterior part of  caudal fin. Eye bronze color in life.    _Variation._--The variation in size and proportions is given in Table  2. In some specimens the first upper tooth-row is irregular, sometimes  broken, and often shorter than other upper tooth-rows. Usually the  fourth upper and first lower, and sometimes the sixth lower,  tooth-rows are interrupted medially. One specimen has a short,  irregular, seventh lower tooth-row; all others have six.    The cream-colored crescent-shaped mark usually is distinct. The brown  blotch posterior to this mark is variously shaped ranging from a  narrow vertical bar to a triangular blotch. Brown flecks seldom are  present on the anterior part of the ventral caudal fin.    _Comparisons._--Aside from the characters given in the diagnosis, _P.  euthysanota euthysanota_ can be distinguished from both _P.  spinipollex_ and _P. leonhardschultzei_ by the absence of bold black  and white marbling on the flanks; furthermore, from the former it can  be distinguished by having more and smaller horny nuptial spines and  from the latter by having the snout, in lateral profile, rounded above  and not acutely angulate. _Ptychohyla euthysanota euthysanota_ differs  from _P. euthysanota macrotympanum_ by normally having a darker dorsal  color, broader stripe on upper lip, and a distinct lateral stripe.    Occurring sympatrically with _Ptychohyla euthysanota euthysanota_ are  several species of _Plectrohyla_, all of which differ in having a bony  prepollex, rather rugose skin on the dorsum, and more squat bodies.  Other sympatric species are _Ptychohyla schmidtorum schmidtorum_,  which lacks a tarsal fold and nuptial spines and has a red eye in  life, _Hyla salvadorensis_, which has a green dorsum and lacks spinous  nuptial tuberosities, and _Hyla sumichrasti_, a small yellow frog  usually lacking vomerine teeth.      _Life History._--This subspecies breeds in clear, swift mountain  streams. Males call from stems and leaves of plants at the edge of, or  overhanging, the streams. The breeding call consists of a soft  \"wraack,\" repeated at intervals of three to four seconds. Each note  has a duration of 0.60 to 0.65 seconds and has 91 to 102 pulses per  second; the dominant frequency falls between 3000 and 3200 cycles per  second.    Tadpoles in various stages of development were found at Finca La Paz,  Guatemala, in late July. This indicates that there is either extreme  differential growth, or, more probably, an extended breeding season. A  tadpole having a body length of 6.8 mm. and a total length of 19.1 mm.  has a short median first upper tooth-row; lower tooth-rows 3-6 are  only two-thirds as long as lower rows 1 and 2. Two recently  metamorphosed young have snout-vent lengths of 14.2 and 14.8 mm.; they  are colored like the adults.    _Remarks._--The type specimen of _Hyla euthysanota_ Kellogg (1928:123)  is a female; therefore, when Taylor (1944) proposed the name  _Ptychohyla_ for hylids having ventrolateral glands in breeding males,  he was unaware that _Hyla euthysanota_ was a member of this group. In  his description of _Hyla rozellae_, Taylor (1942) did not compare his  specimens with _Hyla euthysanota_, but instead placed _H. rozellae_  with _H. loquax_ and _H. rickardsi_. The type series of _H. rozellae_  consists of one large adult female and several metamorphosing young.  Taylor (1949:16) based the description of _Ptychohyla bogerti_ on two  males and compared these specimens with _P. adipoventris_ Taylor [=  _P. leonhardschultzei_ (Ahl)]. Thus, in a period of 22 years the  females of this species were given two names and the male another.  Stuart (1954:169) suggested that _Hyla euthysanota_ and _Hyla  rozellae_ were _Ptychohyla_. Now that sufficient specimens are  available from throughout the range it is possible to determine that  the various named populations are conspecific.    _Distribution._--This subspecies inhabits cloud forests at elevations  of 660 to 2200 meters on the Pacific slopes of the Sierra Madre from  extreme eastern Oaxaca and western Chiapas, Mexico, through Guatemala  to northern El Salvador; probably it occurs also in southwestern  Honduras. Aside from the specimens listed below, three in the  Frankfurt Museum from Depto. Santa Ana, El Salvador (44571, Hacienda  San Jose; 43040, Hacienda Los Planes; 65119, Miramundo) are listed by  Mertens (1952:29).    _Specimens examined._--MEXICO: _Chiapas: Cascarada, 30 km.
