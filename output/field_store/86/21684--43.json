You would shake your head mournfully, and would remark \"Defective  Conclusion!  Poor little chap!\"  And perhaps you would ask the  young lady behind the counter whether she would let YOU eat the  bun, which the little boy had paid for and left behind him: and  perhaps SHE would reply \"Sha'n't!\"    But if, in the above example, the writer had drawn the Conclusion  \"All misers are selfish\" (that is, \"All y are x\"), this would  be going BEYOND his legitimate rights (since it would assert the  EXISTENCE of y, which is not contained in the Premisses), and you  would very properly say \"Fallacious Conclusion!\"    Now, when you read other treatises on Logic, you will meet with  various kinds of (so-called) 'Fallacies' which are by no means  ALWAYS so.  For example, if you were to put before one of these  Logicians the Pair of Premisses                \"No honest men cheat;             No dishonest men are trustworthy.\"      and were to ask him what Conclusion followed, he would probably say  \"None at all!  Your Premisses offend against TWO distinct Rules, and  are as fallacious as they can well be!\"  Then suppose you were bold  enough to say \"The Conclusion is 'No men who cheat are trustworthy',\"  I fear your Logical friend would turn away hastily--perhaps angry,  perhaps only scornful: in any case, the result would be unpleasant.  I ADVISE YOU NOT TO TRY THE EXPERIMENT!    \"But why is this?\" you will say.  \"Do you mean to tell us that all  these Logicians are wrong?\"  Far from it, dear Reader!  From THEIR  point of view, they are perfectly right.  But they do not include,  in their system, anything like ALL the possible forms of Syllogisms.    They have a sort of nervous dread of Attributes beginning with a  negative particle.  For example, such Propositions as \"All not-x  are y,\" \"No x are not-y,\" are quite outside their system.  And  thus, having (from sheer nervousness) excluded a quantity of very  useful forms, they have made rules which, though quite applicable  to the few forms which they allow of, are no use at all when you  consider all possible forms.    Let us not quarrel with them, dear Reader!  There is room enough in  the world for both of us.  Let us quietly take our broader system:  and, if they choose to shut their eyes to all these useful forms,  and to say \"They are not Syllogisms at all!\" we can but stand aside,  and let them Rush upon their Fate!  There is scarcely anything of  yours, upon which it is so dangerous to Rush, as your Fate.  You  may Rush upon your Potato-beds, or your Strawberry-beds, without  doing much harm: you may even Rush upon your Balcony (unless it  is a new house, built by contract, and with no clerk of the works)  and may survive the foolhardy enterprise: but if you once Rush upon  your FATE--why, you must take the consequences!

Hence the statistics of general and specific relapse indirectly  confirm the fact that criminals, as a whole, have no uniform  anthropological type; and that the bio-psychical types and  anomalies belong more especially to the category of habitual  criminals and those born into the criminal class, who, after all,  are the only ones hitherto studied by criminal anthropologists.    What, then, is the numerical proportion of habitual criminals to  the aggregate number of criminals?    In the absence of direct inquiry, it is possible to get at this  proportion indirectly, from facts of two kinds.  In the first  place, a study of the works on criminal anthropology supplies us  with an approximate figure, since the biological characteristics  united in individuals, in sufficient number to create a criminal  type, are met with in between forty and fifty per cent. of the  total.    And this conclusion may be confirmed by other data of criminal  statistics.    Whilst the statistics of relapse give us a very limited number of  crimes and offences committed by born and habitual criminals,  science and criminal legislation give us a far more extended  classification.    Ellero reckoned in the penal code of the German Empire 203 crimes  and offences; and I find that the Italian code of 1859 enumerates  about 180, the new code about 200, and the French penal code about  150.  Thus the kind of crimes of habitual criminals <p 19>would  only be about one-tenth of the complete legal classification of  crimes and offences.    It is easy indeed to suppose that born and habitual criminals do  not generally commit political crimes and offences, nor offences  connected with the press, nor against freedom of worship, nor in  corruption of public functionaries, nor misuse of title or  authority; nor calumny, making false attestations or false  reports; nor adultery, incest, or abduction of minors; nor  infanticide, abortion, or palming of children; nor betrayal of  professional secrets; nor bankruptcy offences, nor damage to  property, nor violation of domicile, nor illegal arrests, nor  duels, nor defamation, nor abuse.  I say generally; for, as there  are occasional criminals who commit the offences characteristic of  habitual criminality, such as homicides, robberies, rapes, &c., so  there are born criminals who sometimes commit crimes out of their  ordinary course.    It is now necessary to add a few statistical data in respect of  the classification of crime, which I take, like the others, from  the essay already mentioned.

These are printed ``landscape'' fashion in the book.}      <p 20>    That is to say, habitual criminality would be represented, in  Italy, by about 40 per cent. of the total number of condemned  persons, and by somewhat less in France and Belgium.  This would  be accounted for in Belgium by the exclusion of vagrancy; but the  difference is virtually due to the greater frequency in Italy of  certain crimes, such as homicide, highway robbery with violence,  and conspiracies.    Further, it is apparent that in all these countries the types of  habitual criminality, with the exception of thefts and vagrancy,  are in greater proportion at the assizes, on account of their  serious character.    The actual totals, however, are larger at the tribunals, for as,  in the scale of animal life, the greatest fecundity belongs to the  lower and smaller forms, so in the criminal scale, the less  serious offences (such as simple theft, swindling, vagrancy, &c.)  are the more numerous.  Thus, out of the total of 38 per cent. in  Italy, 32 belong to the tribunals and 6 to the assizes; out of 35  per cent in France, 33 belong to the tribunals and 2 to the  assizes; and out of 30 per cent. in Belgium, 29 belong to the  tribunals and 1 to the assizes.  This also is partly accounted for  by legislative distinctions as to the respective jurisdictions of  these courts.    As to the particulars of the totals, it is found that thefts are  the most numerous types in Italy (20 per cent.), in France (24 per  cent.), in Belgium (23 per cent.), and in Prussia (37 per cent.,  including breaches of trust).[5]      [5] Starke, ``Verbrechen und Verbrecher in Preussen,'' Berlin,  1884, p. 92.      <p 21>    After theft, the most numerous in Italy are vagrancy (5 per  cent.), homicides (4 per cent.), swindling (3 per cent.), forgery  (.9 per cent.), rape (.4 per cent.), conspiracy (.4 per cent.),  and incendiarism (.2 per cent.).    In France and Belgium we find the same relative frequency of  vagrancy and swindling; but homicide, incendiarism, and conspiracy  are less frequent, whilst rape is more common in France (.5 per  cent.) and in Belgium (1 per cent.).    Such then are the most frequent forms of habitual criminality in  the generality of condemned persons; and it will be useful now to  contrast the more frequent forms of occasional criminality.  For  Italy the only judicial statistics which are valuable for detailed  inquiry are those of 1863, 1869-72.  For France, every volume of  the admirable series of criminal statistics may be utilised.    It will be seen that the frequency of these occasional crimes and  offences in Italy and in France is very variable, though assaults  and wounding, resistance to authorities, damage, defamation and  abuse, are the most numerous in both countries.    The proportion of each offence to the total also varies  considerably, not only through a difference of legislation between  Italy and France in regard to poaching, drunkenness, frauds on  refreshment-house keepers, and so forth, but also by reason of the  different condition of individuals and of society in the two  countries.  Thus assaults and wounding, which in Italy comprise 23  per cent. of the total of convictions, reach in France no more  than 14 per cent., whilst resistance to the authorities, &c.,  which                                              YEARLY AVERAGE or CONDEMNED PERSONS.
