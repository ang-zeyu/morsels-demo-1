By this means the normal steam pressure or steam  supply, when thus intermittently or alternately reduced, is restored  gradually by reducing the flow from the water space to the steam  space, so that the transformation of water into steam is made  approximately uniform in spite of the intermittent escape of steam  through the cylinders, and the boiler is thus relieved of the constant  wear and strain of the concussion.    [Illustration: LAWSON'S IMPROVED STEAM BOILER.]    In supplying steam from the water compartment to the steam  compartment, the inventor intends using a number of small  perforations, not amounting in the aggregate to more than about one  twentieth the size of the cylinder port, in connection with a number  of small valves to be under control of the engineer, so that the  amount of steam required can be readily regulated, yet carefully  avoiding the possibility of all, when opened to their utmost capacity,  forming as large an opening as the valve through which the cylinder is  supplied. A number of small valves and perforations in the partition  sheet between the water and steam compartments, will remedy that  hitherto very general annoyance of water rising to and through the  valves, which is occasioned by pressure of steam upon the surface  of the water, and when _one large_ valve is opened, the pressure is  partly removed from the water immediately under it, consequently the  water rises through the valve. A number of small openings for the  liberation of steam from the superheated water will remedy this  difficulty.           *       *       *       *       *          MISCELLANEOUS INVENTIONS.      Mr. Niels C. Larsen, of Sacramento, Cal., has patented a purse or  satchel fastening which can be securely locked and present a smooth  and unbroken surface without projections.    A combined dental speculum and shield has been patented by Mr. Alfred  W. Edwards, of New York city. The object of this invention is to  facilitate the performance of dental operations, such as the filling  of teeth. It consists in a combined dental speculum, gag, and  shield formed of a flaring or bonnet-shaped shell of metal, having  a longitudinal slot in its lower side to receive the teeth, and an  arched wire attached to its lower part, upon the opposite sides of  the forward end of the slot, to rest upon the teeth and support the  forward part of the shell.    An improved coupling for the shafts of a wagon, which can be readily  fastened to or unfastened from the axle, has been patented by Mr.  William W. French, of Stockbridge, Mass. The invention consists in the  combination with the axle clip and knuckle joint of a sliding  bearer and spring catch to facilitate the opening and closing of the  coupling.    Mr. Joseph Kintz, of West Meriden, Conn., has patented an improved  process for bronzing iron surfaces, which consists in cleaning and  buffing the iron surfaces, then electroplating with copper, then  dipping in acid solution, then again buffing, then boiling in a salt  of tin solution, and then finishing by subjecting the article to heat  until the copper and spelter coatings are fused into bronze.    A simple device for extending the steps of passenger cars, for the  convenience of passengers getting in and out of the car, and for  protecting at the same time the treads of the permanent steps from  sparks, cinders, snow, etc., during the passage of the car from one  station to another, has been patented by Mr. Benjamin F. Shelabarger,  of Hannibal, Mo.    Mr. Luther C. Baldwin, of Manchester, N. H., has patented a new and  improved automatic heat regulator, simple in construction and so  arranged as to operate, under the smallest changes of temperature,  upon the valves of the source of heat.    An improved cigar lighting stand has been patented by Mr. Joseph  Kintz, of West Meriden, Conn. This improvement relates to lamp stands  for cigar lighting, and has for its object the production of a stand  of ornamental character which may be packed closely for transportation  and readily put together for use.    A simple, safe, and efficient device in which light oils may be used  as fuel for heating sad irons for domestic use, or for the use of  tailors, dressmakers, etc., has been patented by Mr. Harvey L. Wells,  of Evansville, Ind. It consists essentially of an iron box divided  longitudinally into two chambers, the lower being the combustion  chamber and the upper the heating chamber.    An improvement in electric light has been patented by Mr. Charles  J. Van Depoele, of Detroit, Mich. The object of this invention is  to automatically regulate the feed of the carbon in electric lights  according to the changes of resistance in the current caused by the  consumption of the carbon points, so as to prevent flickering and  variations in intensity of the light.           *       *       *       *       *          CHLOROFORMING DURING SLEEP.    The possibility of chloroforming a person in sleep, without waking  him, having been disputed in a recent murder trial, Dr. J. V. Quimby,  of Jersey City, was led to test the question experimentally. The  results were presented in a paper before the section of medical  jurisprudence at the meeting of the American Medical Association a few  days ago. Dr. Quimby made arrangements with a gentleman to enter his  room when he was asleep and apply chloroform to him. He did this with  entire success, transferring the person from natural to artificial  sleep without arousing him. He used about three drachms of Squibb's  chloroform, and occupied about seven minutes in the operation. The  second case was a boy of thirteen who had refused to take ether for a  minor operation. Dr. Quimby advised the mother to give the boy a light  supper and put him to bed. She did so, and Dr. Quimby, calling when  the boy was asleep, administered the chloroform and performed the  operation without awakening the boy. The third case was a boy of ten  years suffering from an abscess, and the same course was pursued with  equal success. Two important inferences may be drawn from these cases,  Dr. Quimby said. Minor surgical operations may be done with perfect  safety and much more pleasantly than in the ordinary way, and,  secondly, a person somewhat skilled in the use of chloroform may enter  a sleeping apartment and administer chloroform with evil intentions  while a person is asleep. Hence the use of this drug in the hands of  a criminal may become an effective instrument in the accomplishment of  his nefarious designs.           *       *       *       *       *          IMPROVED WATERING DIPPER.    A convenient vessel for watering plants, sprinkling floors, and for  other similar purposes is shown in the annexed engraving. It is simply  a dipper of the usual form, partly covered at the top by a shield, at  the center of which is fixed a sprinkler spout. The utility of this  improvement will be recognized without further description. It was  recently patented by Mr. R. Harrison, of Columbus, Miss.    [Illustration: HARRISON'S WATERING DIPPER]           *       *       *       *       *          IMPROVED ELECTRIC LAMP.    The lamp shown in the engraving will be recognized as an Edison  lamp, the vacuum globe and the carbon horseshoe being the principal  elements. Mr. John H. Guest, a well known electrical inventor of  Brooklyn, N. Y., judging from his own experience in fusing platinum  with glass in the manufacture of thermostatic fire alarms, concluded  that the principal trouble with the Edison lamp would be the entrance  of air around the wires passing through the glass of the vacuum globe,  devised a simple plan of sealing the joint between the wires and the  glass by means of mercury, thus interposing an effectual barrier to  the entrance of air at that point.    [Illustration: GUEST'S IMPROVED ELECTRIC LAMP, Fig 1 and Fig 2]    The invention is so clearly shown in the engraving that scarcely a  word of explanation is necessary. In the lamp shown in Fig. 1, the  wires that convey the current to the carbon horseshoe are sealed in  the ends of curved glass tubes communicating with the globe, and these  joints are inclosed in small globes formed on the ends of the glass  tubes and filled with mercury.    In this lamp Mr. Guest has made provision partially or wholly  preventing the circulation of air, should any remain in the globe  after exhaustion with the air pump. The device by which this is  accomplished is simply a small globe connected with the lower portion  of the lamp globe by a contracted passage, the theory being that the  cooler and heavier portion of the air will be drawn into the auxiliary  globe by its own gravity.    Fig. 2 shows a lamp in which the tubes that support the wires extend  downward into the lamp globe. These tubes at their junction with the  vacuum globe are fused to the platinum conducting wires, and the tubes  act simply as lateral supports to the wires inside the globe, allowing  the wires to expand freely lengthwise. The tubes are sealed outside  the globe in the manner shown in Fig. 1.    Another improvement made by Mr. Guest consists in inclosing the ends  of the platinum wire conductors in the ends of the material of the  carbon before it is carbonized, the wire being formed into a loop to  increase the conducting surface and to insure a good connection with  the carbon.           *       *       *       *       *          APPARATUS FOR PRESERVING FRUIT.    The annexed engraving represents a simple apparatus for preserving  fruit in its natural state, by means of a partial vacuum. The vessel  is especially designed for the purpose, and is provided with an  absorbent which takes up whatever moisture may emanate from the fruit.  The vessel is preferably made of glass or earthenware, and is provided  with a cover having a packing ring and a device for receiving  the stems of the fruit.

Mr. Simmins, the bee-master in question,  shuts the queen up for half an hour without any food before putting her  into the hive. He then carefully raises a corner of the cover, and  drops her on to the top of one of the combs. She seems overjoyed at  finding the bees around her, and as she is starving she gladly accepts  the food that they offer her. The workers, deceived by her manner, seem  to believe that she actually is their old queen who has come back to  them, and welcome her joyfully. In this case, therefore, it would seem  that Huber, and the other experts who declare that the bees can always  recognize their own queen, are not entirely right.    And there is also this to be said about the affection the bees have for  their queen. That affection is real, and certainly exists; but it is  certain also that it does not last very long. If you were to put back  into the hive a queen who had been away for several days, her daughters  would receive her so badly that you would have to snatch her up very  quickly, and take her away. The explanation is that the bees will have  made their arrangements to replace her, and will have turned a dozen  workers'cells into royal cradles, thus providing for a new queen and  rendering the future safe. They will therefore have nothing more to do  with the old one.      The future is the bees' one consideration, and they sacrifice everything  to it. As a curious instance, one may mention the way in which they will  deal with a mouse, or a slug perhaps, that shall have managed to get  into the hive. They will very soon kill the intruder, but then have to  consider how they will get rid of the body. If they are unable to drag  it out of the hive or tear it to pieces, they will build a perfect waxen  tomb round it, which will tower strangely above the ordinary monuments  of the city. In one of my hives last year I found three such tombs side  by side; they had been made with party-walls, like the cells of the  comb, so that no wax should be wasted. The careful grave-diggers had  raised these tombs over the remains of three snails that a child had  dropped into the hive. Generally, in the case of snails, the bees will  be satisfied to seal the opening of the shell with wax. But here it  seemed that the shells were broken, and the bees had therefore thought  it wiser to bury the entire snail; and so that the entrance-hall should  not be blocked, they had made a number of galleries, wide enough for the  male bees, which are almost twice as big as the workers, to pass  through. In districts where the hideous death's-head moth abounds, the  bees erect little columns of wax at the entrance of the hive, and place  them so closely together that the night-thief cannot pass through.      And now to return to our swarming hive, where the bees have already  given the signal for flight. And at once, as though with one sudden  impulse, every gate in the city is flung open wide; and the black throng  issues, or rather pours forth, in a double or treble jet, in a  throbbing, quivering stream, that quickly divides and melts into space,  where the thousands of beating wings weave a tissue humming with sound.  And this for some moments will hover above the hive, rustling like  gossamer silk; then, like a veil of gladness, all stirring and  quivering, it floats to and fro, from the flowers up to the sky. The  radiant mantle will gather together its four sunlit corners; and, like  the fairy carpet, will fly across space, steering its straight, direct  course to the willow, the pear-tree or lime on which the queen will have  settled. Around her each wave comes to rest, as though on a golden nail,  and from it there hangs the tissue of pearls and of golden wings.    And then there is silence once more; and, in an instant, this mighty  tumult, this bewildering golden hail that streamed upon every object  near, becomes nothing more than a cluster of inoffensive and harmless  bees, that wait patiently, in thousands of little motionless groups  hanging down from the branch of a tree, for the scouts to return who  have gone in search of a place of shelter.    This is the first stage of what is known as the \"primary swarm,\" at  whose head the old queen is always to be found. The bees will usually  settle on the shrub or the tree that is nearest the hive; for the  queen, who has spent all her life in the dark and has almost forgotten  the use of her wings, is afraid to venture too far.    The bee-keeper waits till the great mass of bees is all gathered  together; then, having covered his head with a large straw hat (for the  most inoffensive bee will think it is caught in a trap if entangled in  hair, and will at once use its sting) but, if he be experienced, wearing  neither mask nor veil--having taken the precaution only of plunging his  arms in cold water up to the elbow--he proceeds to gather the swarm by  vigorously shaking, over an inverted hive, the bough from which the bees  are hanging. Into this hive the cluster will fall just like an over-ripe  fruit. Or, if the branch be too thick, he can plunge a spoon into the  mass, and ladle it out, placing the living spoonfuls wherever it pleases  him, as though they were grains of corn. He need have no fear of the  bees that are buzzing around him, and settling on his face and hands;  and he knows that the swarm will not divide, or grow fierce, will not  scatter, or try to escape. This is a day when these strange workers seem  to make holiday, and to be full of a faith and a confidence that nothing  can shake. They have given up the treasure which they used to guard so  preciously; they no longer have enemies. They are harmless because they  are happy; though why they are happy we know not, unless it be because  they are doing what they feel it is right to do.    Where the queen has alighted the swarm will remain; and if she goes into  the hive, the long black files of the bees will closely follow, as soon  as the news shall reach them. Most of them will go eagerly in; but many  will stay for an instant on the threshold of the new home, and there  form themselves into solemn, ceremonious circles, which is their method  of celebrating happy events. \"They are beating to arms,\" the French  peasants say. The new home will at once be adopted, and its furthest  corners explored. Its position, its shape, its color, are taken note of  and never forgotten by these thousands of eager and faithful little  memories, which have also duly recorded the neighboring landmarks; the  new city is founded and the thought of it fills the mind and the heart  of all its inhabitants; the walls resound with the song that proclaims  the royal presence; and work begins.    But if the swarm be not gathered by man, its history will not end here.  It will cling to the branch of the tree till the scouts return who have  been flying in every direction looking for a new home. They will come  back one by one, and give an account of their mission. The report of  each scout will probably be very carefully considered. One of them,  perhaps, will speak favorably of some hollow tree it has seen; another  has something to say about a crack in a ruined wall, a hole in a grotto,  or an abandoned burrow. Sometimes the assembly will stop and weigh  matters over till the next morning; but at last the choice is made and  agreed to by all. At a given moment the entire mass stirs, divides and  sets forth; and then, in one sustained and impetuous flight that this  time knows no obstacle, it steers its straight course, over hedges and  cornfields, over haystack and lake, over river and village, to its fixed  and always far-away goal. It is rarely indeed that this second stage  can be followed by man. The swarm returns to nature; and we know not  what becomes of it.          III    THE FOUNDATION OF THE CITY      The bee-keeper has gathered the swarm into his hive; let us now see what  they will do. And, first of all, let us not be unmindful of the  sacrifice that these fifty thousand workers have made, who, as Ronsard  says \"In a little body bear so brave a heart,\" and let us, yet again,  admire the courage with which they begin their life anew in the desert  into which they have fallen. They have forgotten the wealth and  magnificence of their native city; they are indifferent to all they have  left behind. They give not a thought to the vast store of pollen that  they had collected, to the 120 pounds of honey, a quantity, let it be  remembered, which is more than twelve times the weight of all the bees  in the hive put together, and close on 600,000 times that of the single  bee. Or you might say that to us it would mean something like 42,000  tons of provisions, a great fleet laden with nourishment more precious  than any known to us; for to the bee honey is a kind of liquid life,  which it absorbs with almost no waste whatever.    Here, in the new abode, there is nothing; not a drop of honey, not a  morsel of wax; there is nothing to begin on, there is nothing to serve  as a starting-point. There is only the dreary emptiness of an enormous  building with its bare sides and roof. The smooth and rounded walls  enclose only darkness; under the lofty arch is a mere void. But useless  regrets are unknown to the bee; at any rate, they are not allowed to  interfere with work. And instead of being depressed or moping in a  corner, the bee sets to at once, and more energetically than ever.    Immediately, and without the smallest delay, the tangled mass divides,  splits up and forms itself into groups. Most of these will proceed,  marching abreast in regular columns, like regiments obeying the word of  command, and will begin to climb the steep walls of the hive. The first  bees to reach the dome will cling to it with the claws of their front  legs; those behind will hang on to the ones in front of them, and the  next the same, and so on to the end, till long chains have been made  that serve as a"]]]
