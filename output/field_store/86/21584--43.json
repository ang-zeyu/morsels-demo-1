The flowering stems stand above  the water, and each stem bears three or four very pretty violet purple  flowers, and it blossoms nearly all summer.      [Illustration: FIG. 2. BLADDER OF U. CLANDESTINA MAGNIFIED TWENTY    DIAMETERS.]    The flowers are about half an inch broad and quite conspicuous. Most of  the other species have yellow flowers.    There are no little thread-like leaves on this species, and the bladders  are on the ends of the little branchlets, and they have no sharp-pointed  antennae as in the other species; but in their place is an elegant  cluster of transparent glassy-like ornamental appendages. The ornaments  are just above the entrance, and who knows but this is a contrivance set  there to lure unwary creatures into the trap.    One of the most common little creatures that was caught in this trap,  was the _Tardigrada_, or water bear. He looks like a tiny cub, but  unlike his great namesake, he has eight legs, and he frequently slips  out of his old skin and comes out in a new suit.    I often find them crawling in a forest of these plants, peering out of a  thick jungle--now ascending a branch and out on a limb, holding fast  with their long claws, and apparently looking around to see what they  can find.    Now one seems to be attracted to this elegant glassy cluster of  _Utricularia_. At all events he is soon pushing his head among the  delicate stems, then stops a moment, standing perfectly still as if  listening. Perhaps he hears the groans of his dying comrades, but all  unheeding the warning, he steps forward, touches the fatal spring, when  in he goes to perish with his comrades.      [Illustration: FIG. 3. CHIRONOMUS LARVA: BACK VIEW WITH FEET DRAWN IN    AND JAWS CLOSED; SIDE VIEW WITH FEET EXTENDED AND JAWS CLOSED.]    Young microscopists may like to know that the _Utricularia_ can be  preserved in the house a long time by putting the stems or sprays in an  open, shallow dish of water where they will grow readily. I have kept  the plants months together in a large glass dish where they looked  charmingly beautiful and were the admiration of all who saw them. It is  very interesting to watch their growth. The ends of the growing sprays  unroll like ferns, and with a magnifying glass you can see the  development of the little bladders, and you may make discoveries--who  knows? I know that for a long time it was a mystery to me how the  bladders captured and imprisoned the little animals. Every day I saw  they were entrapped and never escaped, and I studied and pondered over  the matter a long time, and was so interested and determined to learn  the secret that I spent night after night looking through the  microscope, watching the strange, unwary creatures fall into the trap.    At last I concluded to adopt the following plan: I took sprays of the  plants that I had grown in clear water that contained no animalcules, so  that all the bladders were empty and quite transparent. In another dish  I had put a great many masses of mosquito eggs. Mosquito eggs are found  floating on almost any standing water, in dark, compact masses. In warm  weather they hatch in a few hours. So you can understand how quickly I  could swarm a small vessel of water with the mosquito larvae by  introducing the eggs where I wished them to hatch. When they were  hatched I put some of the water in which was a large number of the tiny  creatures into the live box with a spray of the plant containing empty  bladders. I placed the box under the microscope and closely watched the  manner of capture. I became certain that in almost every instance the  larvae were caught tail first. The tail is brush-like, and when it swept  over the door or valve that leads into the bladder, I saw that the door  would immediately fly open and always draw the larva in. I soon became  satisfied that the valve was very sensitive when touched at the right  point, but to this day I cannot tell what the power is that so quickly  draws the creatures within. I earnestly hope that some young  microscopists will yet be able to ferret out the cause of this singular  power.    Those who have read Mr. Darwin's very interesting book on _Insectivorous  Plants_, will have noticed that he says the valve of _Utricularia_ is  not in the least sensitive, and that the little creatures force their  way into the bladders--their heads acting like a wedge. But this is not  the case, as Mr. Darwin himself was convinced some years before his  death. In his usual kind, gracious manner he admitted that he was wrong,  and gracefully says the valve must be sensitive, although he could never  excite any movement. In a letter to me bearing date June 1st, 1875, he  says:    \"I have read your article (in _Harpers Magazine_) with the greatest  interest. It certainly appears from your excellent observations that the  valve is sensitive.... I cannot understand why I could never with all my  pains excite any movement. It is pretty clear I am quite wrong about the  head acting like a wedge. The indraught of the living larva is  astonishing.\"      X.--FREE SWIMMING ANIMALCULES.    The Brickmaker, Floscules, and Vorticellas are quiet peaceable citizens  of the microscopic world, and seem to be impressed with the graver  duties of life; they set up housekeeping and settle down for life moored  to one spot. But there are many others that live a free-and-easy sort of  life--a wandering gypsy kind of an existence, always on the move; and  there is not much satisfaction in trying to follow these rovers if we  wish to make a careful study of their structure.      [Illustration: SKELETON WATER WHEEL.]    So to be enabled to examine them you will be compelled to imprison them  in the live-box and bring just as much pressure to bear upon them as  they will stand without crushing, which with careful practice you may  soon learn to do. But if you are simply making the acquaintance of these  little creatures for amusement, it is more interesting and satisfactory  to watch them while they are unrestrained, and see the curious feats  they perform.    One of the most amusing of these little animals is the Skeleton  Wheel-bearer (_Dinocharis pocillum_). His portrait is seen at _Figure  1_. He has a long foot consisting of three joints, and these joints are  as perfect as those of our own knees and elbows, and can be moved as  easily forward and sideways, but not backward. The joints and foot are  not covered with any fleshy substance, from which fact--the joints being  so conspicuous--it probably received the name Skeleton. Two long slender  toes extend from the last joint, and from the tips of these the Skeleton  can show us more wonderful feats than any circus performer.    The toes can be widely separated, or brought close together, like a pair  of tongs. Sometimes he stands on the tip of one toe and throws his body  forward, or from side to side with a rapid motion; then straightening  himself up, he stands on the tips of both toes as if posing, remaining  perfectly still for a few moments and giving us an opportunity to take a  good look at his curious body which is encased in a pretty vase-shaped,  three-sided transparent shell. The head extends from the top of the  vase, and is surmounted with the usual cilia, or wheel, which we see  among all the rotifera. When he is tired of posing, away he swims in a  graceful, easy manner, with his long foot straightened out and the toes  brought close together.    You sometimes will find these pretty creatures, especially in  summer-time, very numerous in the sediment at the bottom of your  collecting bottles. Often I have found dead specimens, and very  beautiful objects they sometimes are. Great numbers of tiny scavengers  have completely cleaned out all of the soft parts of the body in a most  neat and perfect manner, leaving the beautiful shell and vertical  column, that runs through it, and the foot and toes, entire and perfect  in all of their parts.    Think of the minuteness of these scavengers--untold numbers of them  preying upon the body of an object invisible to the naked eye; and yet  this body is a mammoth by the side of one of the scavengers! The mind  can scarcely grasp the minuteness of these tiny creatures--creatures  that seem to enjoy existence, eating, and apparently playing and  entertaining each other like the higher animals.      [Illustration: WHIPTAIL.]    The whiptail (_Mastigocerca carinata_) (_Fig. 2_) is another delicate  pretty little creature, and, like the skeleton, is encased in a glassy  shell. It has a long, tapering, spine-like foot, or, more properly  speaking, a toe which is attached to a very short foot by means of a  flexible joint which allows free motion. You often will find him in  company with the Skeleton, and they seem to vie with each other in  performing strange feats. The Whiptail, if possible, looks even more  comical than the Skeleton when it stands on the tip of its long toe, a  toe which is longer than the entire length of the body, now bending over  and nibbling at the plants, now whisking around as if looking and  inquiring into some passing object, then sailing through the water with  a graceful, easy motion beyond sight.    _Brachionus pala_ is also a lovely creature encased in a delicate  transparent shell. It is considerably larger than the Skeleton or  Whiptail, and is just visible to the unassisted eye. If you drop it in a  phial of clear water and hold it up to the light, you can distinctly see  it gliding through the water like a revolving white speck. A moderate  power of the microscope reveals its beauty. The shell is swelled at the  sides, and narrow at the mouth, and round over the back, while the under  side is flat.      [Illustration: LARGE ROTIFER.]    Like the Skeleton and Whiptail, the head of the little Brachion is seen  protruding from the upper part of the shell; but instead of one wheel  this charming little creature has two, and nothing can be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38440"],[0,"A Distributional Study of the Amphibians of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, México (#6)"],[1," many ponds and most of the streams in  the rainforest are permanent throughout the year. In the scrub forest  all except the largest streams become dry during the dry season, and no  ponds exist through the dry season. With the advent of the first heavy  summer rains the stream beds fill with water, marshes expand, and many  depressions become ponds (Pl. 5, fig. 2). At this time the amount of  free water in the scrub forests and savannas greatly increases, much  more so than that in the rainforests.    Environments are vertically stratified in the rainforests. There is the  deep alluvial soil, the ground litter of leaves and decaying logs, the  low bushes and small trees, and finally the tall trees of the forest.  Each of these provides certain types of shelter for amphibians. The  moist soil and litter on the forest floor is an important microhabitat  for fossorial and strictly terrestrial species. The dense foliage of  the trees, tree holes, and bromeliads growing on the trees provide  shelter for arboreal species. Arboreal and terrestrial bromeliads and  the terrestrial elephant-ear plants (_Xanthosoma_) contain water in the  axils of their leaves throughout the year and thus provide an important  habitat for amphibians. The low, spiny, deciduous trees of the scrub  forest and the grasses and scattered trees in the savannas provide  little shelter. In the savannas there are depressions, some of which  contain water throughout the year; these are often surrounded by trees  providing refugia for amphibians during the dry season. In the scrub  forest many species congregate along streams and in moist stream beds  during the dry season.    Now that the important ecological factors of the major environments  have been outlined, we may examine the local distribution of amphibians  in each of these. Beginning with the rainforest, we find only one  fossorial species, _Gymnopis mexicanus_. A large number of species are  found on the forest floor; characteristic inhabitants of the leaf  litter are: _Bufo valliceps_, _Eleutherodactylus rhodopis_,  _Microbatrachylus pygmaeus_, and _Syrrhophus leprus_. Other terrestrial  amphibians usually are not scattered throughout the rainforest, as are  those named immediately above, but instead inhabit areas of forest  adjacent to ponds or streams; these species include: _Bufo marinus_,  _Eleutherodactylus natator_, _Eleutherodactylus rugulosus_,  _Leptodactylus labialis_, _Leptodactylus melanonotus_, _Rana palmipes_  and _Rana pipiens_. The most striking ecological assemblage of  amphibians in the rainforest is the arboreal group of species,  including:         _Bolitoglossa occidentalis_       _Bolitoglossa platydactyla_       _Eleutherodactylus alfredi_       _Hyla baudini_       _Hyla ebraccata_       _Hyla loquax_       _Hyla microcephala martini_       _Hyla picta_       _Phrynohyas modesta_       _Phrynohyas spilomma_       _Phyllomedusa callidryas taylori_    In the savannas _Rhinophrynus dorsalis_, _Engystomops pustulosus_, and  _Gastrophryne usta_ are fossorial species. _Bufo marinus_,  _Leptodactylus melanonotus_, _Leptodactylus labialis_, _Rana palmipes_,  and _Rana pipiens_ are found in the vicinity of permanent water in the  savannas. Although the savanna habitat does not provide the ecological  conditions for the existence of an arboreal fauna, many arboreal  species from the surrounding rainforest utilize the extensive marshes  and ponds in the savannas for breeding purposes. Thus, _Hyla baudini_,  _Hyla microcephala martini_, _Hyla picta_, and _Phrynohyas spilomma_  have been found breeding in savannas. In parts of savannas where clumps  of trees surround depressions containing water throughout the year,  individuals of the species named above, together with _Hyla loquax_ and  _Phyllomedusa callidryas taylori_, may not only breed, but remain  throughout the year.    In the semi-arid scrub forest the same fossorial species as exist in  the savannas are found. Likewise, _Bufo marinus_, _Leptodactylus  labialis_, _Leptodactylus melanonotus_, and _Rana pipiens_ are found  near permanent water. Terrestrial species in this semi-arid environment  include _Bufo canaliferus_, _Bufo coccifer_, _Bufo marmoreus_,  _Syrrhophus pipilans_, and _Diaglena reticulata_. Of these, _Syrrhophus  pipilans_ sometimes inhabits low trees and bushes; the others may be  fossorial. The arboreal species in the scrub forest include _Hyla  baudini_, _Hyla robertmertensi_, _Hyla staufferi_, and _Phyllomedusa  dacnicolor_.    _Eleutherodactylus rugulosus_ and _Hylella sumichrasti_ live along  streams in the scrub forest. _Hylella sumichrasti_ lays its eggs in  these streams.    In comparing the ecological differences in the amphibian assemblages in  the three major habitats, the most obvious difference is the great  percentage of arboreal species in the rainforest as compared with  savanna and scrub forest. Only four arboreal species are found in the  scrub forest, none in the savannas, but eleven in the rainforest.  Likewise, there is an absence of ground-dwelling forms in the arid  habitats; in the latter the only terrestrial species are those that  are found near water. A possible exception is _Syrrhophus pipilans_.    From the above analysis of ecological distribution we may see that the  rainforest provides a variety of habitats for amphibians and that these  habitats are suitable for amphibian life throughout the year. On the  other hand, the savannas and scrub forests are characterized by extreme  conditions of desiccation, a factor of considerable importance in  limiting the ecological distribution of amphibians. However, there  still is a diversity of amphibians in these semi-arid environments.  Obviously, these species are adapted in various ways for survival  during the dry season, at which time environmental conditions are such  that the animals cannot carry on their normal activities.    Although there is not an abundance of data concerning the seasonal  activity of the fauna, what is available shows some interesting  correlations with the environments. During the dry season in the scrub  forest there is essentially no amphibian activity; an occasional _Rana  pipiens_ may be seen along a river, or a _Bufo marinus_ may be seen at  night. In the rainforest the terrestrial-breeding amphibians are active  during the dry season. _Eleutherodactylus rugulosus_ is found at night  or by day along streams. _Eleutherodactylus rhodopis_,  _Microbatrachylus pygmaeus_, and _Bufo valliceps_ are active during the  day; these plus _Bolitoglossa occidentalis_, _Bolitoglossa  platydactyla_, _Eleutherodactylus alfredi_, _Eleutherodactylus  natator_, and an occasional _Hyla_ are active at night.    With the onset of the heavy summer rains and the subsequent formation  of breeding ponds, amphibian activity reaches a peak. This is  especially noticeable in the semi-arid environments, where during the  dry season there is little activity.    Among the anurans in the isthmus the four species of  _Eleutherodactylus_, the two species of _Syrrhophus_, and the one  species of _Microbatrachylus_ are either known, or presumed, to lay  eggs on the ground; these develop directly into small frogs. All of the  other anurans deposit their eggs in water or attach them to objects  over water (_Phyllomedusa_); these hatch into tadpoles, which later  metamorphose into frogs. _Hylella sumichrasti_ is known to breed only  in streams. All of the other species breed in ponds, but at times some  species deposit their eggs in streams; in this last group are _Bufo  valliceps_, _Bufo marmoreus_, _Phyllomedusa callidryas taylori_, and  _Rana pipiens_.    Although the ecological data are incomplete, they do show that  ecological conditions differ greatly in the three major environments,  different species of amphibians inhabit these environments, and that  the fauna is ecologically diversified in each environment.      _Distribution of the Fauna_    Plotting the distributions of species of amphibians known to live in  the lowlands of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec results in an array of  geographic patterns. These may be analyzed with respect to those  species that are restricted either to the Gulf lowlands or the Pacific  lowlands, or those that occur on both the Gulf and Pacific lowlands.  Furthermore, the distributions may be analyzed with respect to those  species whose ranges extend from Mexico across the Isthmus of  Tehuantepec into Central America, those that reach the isthmus from  Central America but do not extend into Mexico proper, and those that  reach the isthmus from Mexico but do not extend into Central America.  It should be kept in mind that the following analysis is of the lowland  inhabitants only. Species inhabiting the foothills and mountains will  be discussed later.    1. SPECIES RESTRICTED TO THE GULF LOWLANDS. Of the 36 species of  amphibians recorded from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, nine (25 per cent)  are in this group. Four of these (_Eleutherodactylus alfredi_,  _Syrrhophus leprus_, _Hyla loquax_, and _Hyla picta_) live in the Gulf  lowlands to the east and to the west of the isthmus. Three others  (_Hyla ebraccata_, _Hyla microcephala martini_ and _Phyllomedusa  callidryas taylori_) are primarily Central American in their  distribution and reach the northwestern limits of their ranges in the  Gulf lowlands of the isthmus, whereas _Bolitoglossa platydactyla_ and  _Eleutherodactylus natator_ reach the southern limits of their  distributions in the isthmus.    2. SPECIES RESTRICTED TO THE PACIFIC LOWLANDS. This group includes six  species, or 17 per cent of the amphibian fauna of the isthmus. Two of  these (_Bufo coccifer_ and _Syrrhophus pipilans_) range to the east and  to the west of the isthmus on the Pacific lowlands. Two others (_Bufo  canaliferus_ and _Hyla robertmertensi_) range from the isthmus into  Central America, and _Diaglena reticulata_ and _Phyllomedusa  dacnicolor_ range on the Pacific"]]]
