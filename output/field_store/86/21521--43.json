Kimball, an Apostle (#6)"],[1,"received the records of the  Book of Mormon from the angel Moroni, who had held those records in  his possession.    \"John Young, sen., and John P. Greene's wife, Rhoda, were also  witnesses.    \"My wife, being frightened at what she saw, said, 'Father Young, what  does all this mean?'    \"'Why, it's one of the signs of the coming of the Son of Man,' he  replied, in a lively, pleased manner.    \"The next night similar scenery was beheld in the west by the  neighbors, representing armies of men who were engaged in battle.\"    A wonderful foreshadowing, truly, of the warfare to be waged between  the powers of good and evil, from the time Truth sprang from earth and  Righteousness looked down from heaven upon the boy Joseph, predestined  to bring to light the buried records of the past.    In Mendon began the intimacy and friendship of Heber C. Kimball with  his life-long colleague, Brigham Young. The Youngs and Greenes, like  the Kimballs, were from Vermont, and had moved into Mendon a few  months prior to the event just related. In religion they were Reformed  Methodists, but, being in lowly circumstances, were looked down upon  by the proud members of the flourishing church to which they belonged.  They had suffered greatly from sickness, and had seen much sorrow and  affliction.    Heber's generous heart and that of his noble wife were touched with  sympathy and compassion for their situation. Says he: \"To them my  heart was united, because a principle had existed in my breast from  earliest childhood, to plead the cause of suffering innocence, to go  on the side of the oppressed at all times; neither do I remember to  have ever varied from this fixed principle at any time in my life; I  have many times turned aside from the company of those who were highly  esteemed in the world, and sought the society of the poor and humble,  those who loved the ways of the Lord better than the praise of the  world.\"    He found in these families, which were related, congenial associates,  for they too were seekers after truth, and truth they were all  destined, ere many days, to find.    Sometime in the fall or winter of 1831, about three weeks after Heber  and his wife had joined the Baptist church, five Elders of the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints came from Pennsylvania to Victor,  five miles from Mendon, and tarried at the house of Phineas H. Young.  They were Eleazer Miller, Elial Strong, Alpheus Gifford, Enos Curtis  and Daniel Bowen. Hearing of these men, Heber was prompted by  curiosity to visit them, \"when,\" says he, \"for the first time I heard  the fullness of the everlasting gospel.\"    The glorious news of a restored gospel and a living priesthood,  commissioned of and communicating with the heavens; the promise of the  Holy Ghost with signs following the believer, as in days of old; the  wondrous declaration of angels revisiting the earth, breaking the  silence of ages, bringing messages from another world;--all this fell  upon the heart of this God-fearing man, and on the hearts of his  friends and companions, like dew upon thirsty ground. As the voice of  a familiar spirit, it seemed an echo from the far past--something they  had known before.    To hear, with Heber, was to believe. He was convinced that they taught  the truth, and was constrained to receive their testimony. He saw,  more clearly than ever, that he had embraced but a portion of the  truth in the Baptist faith; that the creeds of Christendom, the  religions of the world, were but remnants of the everlasting gospel,  broken off fragments of that grand Rock of Ages, the same in all  generations; mixtures of truth and error; lesser lights at best in the  broad firmament of human faith; and that now, when the Sun had once  more arisen, the stars that lit the night must pale away.    Both Heber and Brigham received the word gladly, and were impelled to  testify of its divinity. Then the power of God fell upon them.    \"On one occasion,\" says Heber, \"Father John Young, Brigham Young,  Joseph Young and myself had come together to get up some wood for  Phineas H. Young. While we were thus engaged we were pondering upon  those things which had been told us by the Elders, and upon the saints  gathering to Zion, when the glory of God shone upon us, and we saw the  gathering of the saints to Zion, and the glory that would rest upon  them; and many more things connected with that great event, such as  the sufferings and persecutions that would come upon the people of  God, and the calamities and judgments that would come upon the world.    \"These things caused such great joy to spring up in our bosoms that we  were hardly able to contain ourselves, and we did shout aloud  'Hosannah to God and the Lamb.'\"    This heavenly vision, vouchsafed as the reward of faith and pure  desires, only made them eager to know more of the \"marvelous work and  wonder\" which the God of Israel had set His hand to perform, in  fulfillment of the words of His ancient prophets. The Holy Ghost had  fallen upon them, as on Cornelius of old, before baptism. They had  plucked from the Tree of Life, from branches overhanging the wall,  luscious fruit, whose sweetness and flavor made them long to enter the  garden and more fully satisfy the desire of their souls.    Heber, accordingly, proposed a journey to Pennsylvania, the state from  whence the Elders came, where several branches of the Church were  established. It was winter; January, 1832. Putting his horses to the  sleigh, he and his companions set off upon the journey, a distance of  one hundred and twenty-five miles. The party consisted of Heber C.  Kimball, Brigham Young, Phineas Young and the wives of the two latter.  The branch they visited was in Columbia, Bradford County; that from  which the Elders came, in Rutland, Tioga County.    They tarried about six days, attending the meetings of the Church,  witnessing the manifestations of the gifts of the spirit, such as  speaking in tongues, interpretations and prophecy, and learning more  of the nature and mission of the great latter-day work. They returned  home rejoicing, praising God, and bearing testimony by the way.          CHAPTER IV.    HEBER EMBRACES MORMONISM--A BAPTISM OF FIRE--DEATH OF MIRIAM  YOUNG--VILATE KIMBALL A MOTHER TO THE ORPHANS--HEBER ORDAINED AN  ELDER--RESOLVES TO VISIT KIRTLAND.      Heber, be it remembered, was a potter, and, though fairly well-to-do  in the world, continued to labor at his trade for a livelihood.    One day in April, of the spring following his visit to Pennsylvania,  as he was working in his shop, in the act of forming a vessel on the  wheel, Alpheus Gifford entered. This Elder was then on his second  mission to those parts, in company with others of his brethren. The  conversation turning on the subject of the gospel, Heber said:  \"Brother Alpheus, I am ready to go forward and be baptized.\"    What followed is thus graphically told. Says Heber: \"I arose, pulled  off my apron, washed my hands and started with him, with my sleeves  rolled up to my shoulders, and went a distance of one mile, where he  baptized me in a small stream in the woods. After I was baptized I  kneeled down and he laid his hands upon my head and confirmed me a  member of the Church of Jesus Christ, and said unto me, 'In the name  of Jesus Christ, and by the authority of the holy Priesthood, receive  ye the Holy Ghost;' and before I got up off my knees he wanted to  ordain me an Elder; but I plead with him not to do it, for I felt  myself unworthy of such a calling, and such an office.\"    This event, so important to Heber C. Kimball and his posterity, took  place on Monday, the fifteenth of April, 1832. Brigham Young had been  baptized the day before, by Elder Eleazer Miller. Two weeks later,  Heber's wife, Vilate, was baptized by Joseph Young.    A branch was raised up in Mendon numbering over thirty souls; its  members were as follows:    John Young, sen., and Mary his wife,  Brigham Young and Miriam his wife,  Phineas H. Young and Clarissa his wife,  Joseph Young,  Lorenzo D. Young and Persis his wife,  John P. Greene and Rhoda his wife and their children,  Joel Sanford and Louisa his wife,  William Stillson and Susan his wife,  Fanny Young,  Isaac Flummerfelt, wife and children,  Ira Bond and his wife Charlotte,  Heber C. Kimball and Vilate his wife,  Rufus Parks,  John Morton and Betsey his wife,  Nathan Tomlinson and his wife,  Israel Barlow with his mother, brothers and sisters.    The reception of the Holy Ghost was to Heber a veritable \"baptism of  fire.\" He thus describes his remarkable experience:    \"Under the ordinances of baptism and the laying on of hands, I  received the Holy Ghost, as the disciples did in ancient days, which  was like a consuming fire. I felt as though I sat at the feet of  Jesus, and was clothed in my right mind, although the people called me  crazy.    \"I continued in this way for many months, and it seemed as though my  body would consume away; at the same time the scriptures were unfolded  to my mind in such a wonderful manner that it appeared to me, at  times, as if I had formerly been familiar with them.\"    Thus did the Comforter, the spirit of truth, bringing things past to  remembrance and showing things to come, move upon the heart of this  \"mighty man of valor,\" whom the Lord was raising up for a marvelous  future work. One of the weak things of earth, through whom the  Omnipotent would yet thresh the nations by the power of His Spirit.    The branch in Mendon began to nourish, and the gifts of the spirit  were poured out upon its members. This branch is reputed to have been  the second in the Church to receive the gift of tongues; one of the  branches in Pennsylvania being the first in which that gift was  manifested.    Such a pentecostal renewal could scarcely take place without a  corresponding movement of opposition on the part of the powers of  darkness. The inevitable was at hand.

Here we paused, surveying \"the wild abyss; pondering our voyage.\"  Before us lay the trackless immeasurable desert, in awful silence. At  length, after consultation, we determined to steer west and by north, by  compass, the make of the land in that quarter indicating the existence of a  river. We continued to march all day through a country untrodden before by  an European foot. Save that a melancholy crow now and then flew croaking  over head, or a kangaroo was seen to bound at a distance, the picture of  solitude was complete and undisturbed. At four o'clock in the afternoon we  halted near a small pond of water, where we took up our residence for the  night, lighted a fire, and prepared to cook our supper: that was, to broil  over a couple of ramrods a few slices of salt pork, and a crow which we had  shot.    At daylight we renewed our peregrination; and in an hour after we found  ourselves on the banks of a river, nearly as broad as the Thames at  Putney, and apparently of great depth, the current running very slowly in a  northerly direction. Vast flocks of wild ducks were swimming in the stream;  but after being once fired at, they grew so shy that we could not get near  them a second time. Nothing is more certain than that the sound of a gun  had never before been heard within many miles of this spot.    We proceeded upwards, by a slow pace, through reeds, thickets, and a  thousand other obstacles, which impeded our progress, over coarse sandy  ground, which had been recently inundated, though full forty feet above the  present level of the river. Traces of the natives appeared at every step,  sometimes in their hunting-huts, which consist of nothing more than a  large piece of bark, bent in the middle, and open at both ends, exactly  resembling two cards, set up to form an acute angle; sometimes in marks on  trees which they had climbed; or in squirrel-traps*; or, which surprised us  more, from being new, in decoys for the purpose of ensnaring birds. These  are formed of underwood and reeds, long and narrow, shaped like a mound  raised over a grave; with a small aperture at one end for admission of  the prey; and a grate made of sticks at the other: the bird enters at the  aperture, seeing before him the light of the grate, between the bars of  which, he vainly endeavours to thrust himself, until taken. Most of these  decoys were full of feathers, chiefly those of quails, which shewed their  utility. We also met with two old damaged canoes hauled up on the beach,  which differed in no wise from those found on the sea coast.    [*A squirrel-trap is a cavity of considerable depth, formed by art, in the  body of a tree. When the Indians in their hunting parties set fire to  the surrounding country (which is a very common custom) the squirrels,  opossums, and other animals, who live in trees, flee for refuge into these  holes, whence they are easily dislodged and taken. The natives always pitch  on a part of a tree for this purpose, which has been perforated by a worm,  which indicates that the wood is in an unsound state, and will readily  yield to their efforts. If the rudeness and imperfection of the tools with  which they work be considered, it must be confessed to be an operation of  great toil and difficulty.]      Having remained out three days, we returned to our quarters at Rose-hill,  with the pleasing intelligence of our discovery. The country we had passed  through we found tolerably plain, and little encumbered with underwood,  except near the river side. It is entirely covered with the same sorts of  trees as grow near Sydney; and in some places grass springs up luxuriantly;  other places are quite bare of it. The soil is various: in many parts a  stiff and clay, covered with small pebbles; in other places, of a soft  loamy nature: but invariably, in every part near the river, it is a coarse  sterile sand. Our observations on it (particularly mine, from carrying  the compass by which we steered) were not so numerous as might have been  wished. But, certainly, if the qualities of it be such as to deserve future  cultivation, no impediment of surface, but that of cutting down and burning  the trees, exists, to prevent its being tilled.    To this river the governor gave the name of Nepean. The distance of the  part of the river which we first hit upon from the sea coast, is about 39  miles, in a direct line almost due west.    A survey of Botany Bay took place in September. I was of the party, with  several others officers. We continued nine days in the bay, during which  time, the relative position of every part of it, to the extent of more than  thirty miles, following the windings of the shore, was ascertained, and  laid down on paper, by captain Hunter.    So complete an opportunity of forming a judgment, enables me to speak  decisively of a place, which has often engaged conversation and excited  reflection. Variety of opinions here disappeared. I shall, therefore,  transcribe literally what I wrote in my journal, on my return from the  expedition. \"We were unanimously of opinion, that had not the nautical part  of Mr. Cook's description, in which we include the latitude and longitude  of the bay, been so accurately laid down, there would exist the utmost  reason to believe, that those who have described the contiguous country,  had never seen it. On the sides of the harbour, a line of sea coast  more than thirty miles long, we did not find 200 acres which could be  cultivated.\"    September, 1789. But all our attention was not directed to explore inlets,  and toll for discovery. Our internal tranquillity was still more important.  To repress the inroads of depredation; and to secure to honest industry the  reward of its labour, had become matter of the most serious consideration;  hardly a night passing without the commission of robbery. Many expedients  were devised; and the governor at length determined to select from the  convicts, a certain number of persons, who were meant to be of the fairest  character, for the purpose of being formed into a nightly-watch, for  the preservation of public and private property, under the following  regulations, which, as the first system of police in a colony, so  peculiarly constituted as ours, may perhaps prove not uninteresting.      I. A night-watch, consisting of 12 persons, divided into four parties, is  appointed, and fully authorized to patrol at all hours in the night; and  to visit such places as may be deemed necessary, for the discovery of any  felony, trespass, or misdemeanor; and for the apprehending and securing  for examination, any person or persons who may appear to them concerned  therein, either by entrance into any suspected hut or dwelling, or by such  other measure as may seem to them expedient.    II. Those parts in which the convicts reside are to be divided and  numbered, in the following manner. The convict huts on the eastern side of  the stream, and the public farm, are to be the first division. Those at  the brick-kilns, and the detached parties in the different private farms in  that district, are to be the second division. Those on the western side of  the stream, as far as the line which separates the district of the women  from the men, to be the third division. The huts occupied from that line to  the hospital, and from there to the observatory, to be the fourth division.    III. Each of these districts or divisions is to be under the particular  inspection of one person, who may be judged qualified to inform himself of  the actual residence of each individual in his district; as well as of his  business, connections, and acquaintances.    IV. Cognizance is to be taken of such convicts as may sell or barter their  slops or provisions; and also of such as are addicted to gaming for either  of the aforesaid articles, who are to be reported to the judge advocate.    V. Any soldier or seaman found straggling after the beating of the tattoo;  or who may be found in a convict's hut, is to be detained; and information  of him immediately given to the nearest guard.    VI. Any person who may be robbed during the night, is to give immediate  information thereof to the watch of his district, who, on the instant of  application being made, shall use the most effectual means to trace out  the offender, or offenders, so that he, she, or they, may be brought to  justice.    VII. The watch of each district is to be under the direction of one person,  who will be named for that purpose. All the patrols are placed under the  immediate inspection of Herbert Keeling. They are never to receive any  fee, gratuity, or reward, from any individual whatever, to engage their  exertions in the execution of the above trust. Nor will they receive any  stipulated encouragement for the conviction of any offender. But their  diligence and good behaviour will be rewarded by the governor. And for this  purpose their conduct will be strictly attended to, by those who are placed  in authority over them.    VIII. The night-watch is to go out as soon as the tattoo ceases beating: to  return to their huts when the working drum beats in the morning: and are  to make their report to the judge advocate, through Herbert Keeling, of all  robberies and misdemeanors which may have been committed. Any assistance  the patrols may require, will be given to them, on applying to the officer  commanding the nearest guard; and by the civil power, if necessary; for  which last, application is to be made to the provost martial.    IX. Any negligence on the part of those who shall be employed on this duty,  will be punished with the utmost rigour of the law.    X. The night-watch is "]]]
