Under the royal sanction, the dockyards of Seville were at his  command. He repaired to Seville, and was there looked upon as one  destined to harvest the wealth of the Indies.    But as soon as it became known in Portugal that Magellan was to lead a  new expedition of discovery, the mistake that the King had made in  rejecting the proposal of the lame soldier, to whom he had refused  pension honors, became apparent. The court saw what this rejected man of  positive purpose and invaluable knowledge of navigation might  accomplish. Should his dreams be prophetic and his projects prove  successful, the glory would go to Spain, and the King would be held  responsible for another mistake like that which his predecessor had made  in the case of Columbus.    What must the court of Portugal do? The hammers were flying in Seville  on the ships loading for the voyage. Magellan was making up his crews.  Spain had faith in him, and he had faith in himself; never a man had  more.    Portugal must prevent the expedition. The Crown must appeal to Magellan  to withdraw from it. The King must ask young King Charles to dismiss  Magellan as an act of royal courtesy. If these efforts were not  successful, it was argued that the expedition must be arrested by force,  or Magellan must be murdered by secret spies of the court.    The fleet preparing was to consist of five ships with ample equipment.  These were named the Trinidad, the San Antonio, of one hundred and  twenty Spanish tons each; the Concepcion, of ninety Spanish tons; the  Victoria, of eighty-five tons; and the Santiago, of seventy-five. The  Victoria, the ship of destiny, was to circumnavigate the globe.    And now while the hammers were at work, the dull King of Portugal began  to arouse himself to arrest the plan, and the court, seeing his spirit,  acted with him.    In the bright days in Zaragoza Magellan had been warned that he was in  danger of being assassinated. But he did not take alarm. As his project  rose into public view at Seville he must have known that he was  surrounded by spies, but he did not heed them; he kept right on,  marching forward as it were after the inspiration that had taken  possession of his soul.    [Illustration: BEHAIM'S GLOBE. 1492.]    There was an India House in Seville, composed of merchants, and these  were favorable to the expedition. In Spain everything favored Magellan.    Aluaro da Costa was the Portuguese minister to the court of Spain. He  plotted against Magellan, and sought an interview with young Charles in  order to induce him to eliminate the Portuguese from the expedition.  Charles was about to become a brother-in-law to Dom Manoel, and Aluaro  da Costa could appeal to the King in this cause in many ways.    Full of diplomacy and craft, he met the King who had to weigh the  prospect of gold and glory against this personal argument. Gold  outweighed the family considerations, for Charles in his young days was  a man of powerful ambitions.    Aluaro da Costa wrote to Dom Manoel a graphic account of this interview.  It shows how politic ministers of state were in those days. We can not  give the reader a clearer view of some of the obstacles against which  Magellan had to contend in those perilous days in Spain than by citing  Aluaro's account to Dom Manoel of his interview with young Charles V in  his intrigue against Magellan:    \"SIRE: Concerning Ferdinand Magellan's affair, how much I have done and  how I have labored, God knows, as I have written you at length; and now  I have spoken upon the subject very strongly to the King, putting  before him all the inconveniences that in this case may arise, and also  representing to him what an ugly matter it was, and how unusual for one  King to receive the subjects of another King, his friend, contrary to  his wish, a thing unheard of among cavaliers, and accounted both  ill-judged and ill-seeming. Yet I had just put your Highness and your  Highness's possessions at his service in Valladolid at the moment that,  he was harboring these persons against your will. I begged him to  consider that this was not the time to offend your Highness, the more so  in an affair which was of so little importance and so uncertain; and  that he would have plenty of subjects of his own and men to make  discoveries when the time came, without availing himself of those  malcontents of your Highness, whom your Highness could not fail to  believe likely to labor more for your disservice than for anything else;  also that his Highness had had until now so much to do in discovering  his own kingdoms and dominions, and in settling them, that he ought not  to turn his attention to these new affairs, from which dissensions and  other matters, which may well be dispensed with, may result.    \"I also presented to him the bad appearance that this would have at the  very moment of the marriage--the ratification of friendship and  affection. And also that it seemed to me that your Highness would much  regret to learn that these men asked leave of him to return,[A] and that  he did not grant it, the which are two faults--the receiving them  contrary to your desire, and the retaining them contrary to their own.  And I begged of him, both for his own and for your Highness's sake, that  he would do one of two things: either permit them to go, or put off the  affair for this year, by which he would not lose much; and means might  be taken whereby he might be obliged, and your Highness might not be  offended, as you would be were this scheme carried out.        [A] This statement there is every reason to believe was a pure      fiction of Da Costa.    \"He was so surprised, sire, at what I told him, that I also was  surprised; but he replied to me with the best words in the world, saying  that on no account did he wish to offend your Highness, and many other  good words; and he suggested that I should speak to the Cardinal, and  confide the whole matter to him.    \"May the Lord increase the life and dominions of your Highness to his  holy service. From Saragoca, Tuesday night, the 28th day of September.              \"I kiss the hands of your Highness,                                                \"ALUARO DA COSTA.\"    Court intrigue against Magellan did not avail. There was one thing  statecraft could do. It could set spies on Magellan on board his own  ships. This it succeeded in doing.    There was in Spain at this time a Portuguese adventurer and navigator by  the name of Estevan or Esteban Gormez--Stephen Gormez.    He was a student of navigation, and was restless to follow the examples  of Columbus and Vasco da Gama. He had applied to the court of  Spain--probably to Cardinal Ximenes, for a commission to go on a voyage  of discovery and he had received a favorable answer, and was preparing  to embark, when Magellan appeared at court and promised to find the  Spice Islands by way of South America.    Magellan's scheme was so much larger and definite than that of Gormez  that the court canceled its favors to the lesser plans, and Gormez had  to abandon his prospects of sailing under the royal favors of Spain.    The eyes of Spain were now fixed on Magellan.    \"I will find a way to the Spice Islands by South America or by the  West,\" said Magellan to the ministers of the King, \"or you may have my  head.\"    These were bold words. Magellan had not only been to the Spice Islands,  but he had gone out on the very voyage that discovered some of them. He  had behaved heroically on the voyage. So his application to the court  superseded the plan of Gormez and the latter sunk out of sight.    In his despondency at the failure of his plans, Gormez came to Magellan.    \"My countryman,\" said Gormez, \"your schemes have supplanted mine and  turned my ships into air. I was the first to plan a voyage to the  Moluccas out of the wake of hurricanes and monsoons. I do not feel that  I have been treated rightly. Something surely is due to me.\"    Magellan was a man of generous impulses. He saw that Gormez had a case  for moral appeal.    \"My friend,\" said he, \"you shall have a place in my expedition.\"    He could but think that the inspiration and knowledge of navigation of  his countryman would be useful to him, and he pitied him for his  disappointment, knowing how he himself would feel were his plans to be  set aside.    So Gormez, the Portuguese, was made the pilot of the Antonio.    Magellan, had he reflected, must have seen that this man would carry  with him envy and jealousy, passions that are poisons. But Estefano, or  Esteban, or Stephen Gormez, took his place at the pilot house of the  Antonio to follow the lantern of Magellan, but the hurt in his heart at  being superseded never healed.    On the ships also was one Juan de Carthagena, captain of the Concepcion,  a spy, and one of the \"malapots\" of the expedition. He was called the  _veedor_, or inspector. He inspected Magellan, and Magellan inspected  him, as we shall see.    And now the flags arose in the clear air, and the joyful fleet cleared  the Guadalquivir and leaped into the arms of the open sea, amid the  acclamations of gay grandees and a happy people.    It was September 20th when the anchors were lifted, of which probably  one was destined to come back in triumph after an immortal voyage that  encompassed the earth, and gave to Spain a new ocean.    And the King of Portugal ordered the coat of arms to be torn down from  the house of Magellan, as we have pictured at the beginning of our  narrative.          CHAPTER VII.    \"MAROONED.\"      The expedition moved down its western way, over the track of Columbus.  It had left poor Ruy Faleiro behind--he who had seen the progress of it  all in the fitful light of a disordered vision.

All unquestionably are representatives of  _S. baudini_.    Taylor (1942:306) named _Hyla beltrani_ from Tapachula, Chiapas. This  specimen (UIMNH 25046) is a small female (snout-vent length, 44 mm.) of  _S. baudini_. Taylor (1954:630) named _Hyla manisorum_ from Batan,  Limon, Costa Rica. The type (KU 34927) is a large female (snout-vent  length, 75.3 mm.) _S. baudini_. In this specimen and a male from  Suretka, Costa Rica, the usual dorsal color pattern is absent, but the  distinctive curved supraorbital processes, together with other  structural features, show that the two specimens are _S. baudini_.    _Hyla baudini dolomedes_ Barbour (1923:11), as shown by Dunn  (1931a:413), was based on a specimen of _Smilisca phaeota_ from Rio  Esnape, Darien, Panama.        [Illustration: FIG. 1. Map showing locality records for _Smilisca         baudini_.]    _Distribution_.--_Smilisca baudini_ inhabits lowlands and foothills  usually covered by xerophytic vegetation or savannas, but in the  southern part of its range _baudini_ inhabits tropical evergreen forest.  The species ranges throughout the Pacific and Atlantic lowlands of  Mexico from southern Sonora and the Rio Grande embayment of Texas  southward to Costa Rica, where on the Pacific lowlands the range  terminates at the southern limits of the arid tropical forest in the  vicinity of Esparta; on the Caribbean lowlands the distribution seems  to be discontinuous southward to Suretka (Fig. 1). Most localities where  the species has been collected are at elevations of less than 1000  meters. Three localities are notably higher; calling males were found at  small temporary ponds in pine-oak forest at Linda Vista, 2 kilometers  northwest of Pueblo Nuevo Solistahuacan, Chiapas, elevation 1675 meters,  and 10 kilometers northwest of Comitan, Chiapas, at an elevation of 1925  meters. Tadpoles and metamorphosing young were obtained from a pond in  arid scrub forest, 17 kilometers northeast of Juchatengo, Oaxaca,  elevation 1600 meters. Stuart (1954:46) recorded the species at  elevations up to 1400 meters in the south-eastern highlands of  Guatemala.    _Specimens examined._--3006, as follows: UNITED STATES: TEXAS: Cameron  County, Brownsville, CNHM 5412-3, 6869, UMMZ 54036, USNM 3256.
