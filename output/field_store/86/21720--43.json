[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5321"],[0,"Concerning the Spiritual in Art (#6)"],[1,"city, subject to these  sudden disturbances for which neither architects nor  mathematicians have made allowance. In one place lies a great  wall crumbled to pieces like a card house, in another are the  ruins of a huge tower which once stretched to heaven, built on  many presumably immortal spiritual pillars. The abandoned  churchyard quakes and forgotten graves open and from them rise  forgotten ghosts. Spots appear on the sun and the sun grows dark,  and what theory can fight with darkness? And in this city live  also men deafened by false wisdom who hear no crash, and blinded  by false wisdom, so that they say \"our sun will shine more  brightly than ever and soon the last spots will disappear.\" But  sometime even these men will hear and see.    But when we get still higher there is no longer this  bewilderment. There work is going on which boldly attacks those  pillars which men have set up. There we find other professional  men of learning who test matter again and again, who tremble  before no problem, and who finally cast doubt on that very matter  which was yesterday the foundation of everything, so that the  whole universe is shaken. Every day another scientific theory  finds bold discoverers who overstep the boundaries of prophecy  and, forgetful of themselves, join the other soldiers in the  conquest of some new summit and in the hopeless attack on some  stubborn fortress. But \"there is no fortress that man cannot  overcome.\"    On the one hand, FACTS are being established which the science of  yesterday dubbed swindles. Even newspapers, which are for the  most part the most obsequious servants of worldly success and of  the mob, and which trim their sails to every wind, find  themselves compelled to modify their ironical judgements on the  \"marvels\" of science and even to abandon them altogether. Various  learned men, among them ultra-materialists, dedicate their  strength to the scientific research of doubtful problems, which  can no longer be lied about or passed over in silence. [Footnote:  Zoller, Wagner, Butleroff (St. Petersburg), Crookes (London),  etc.; later on, C. H. Richet, C. Flammarion. The Parisian paper  Le Matin, published about two years ago the discoveries of the  two last named under the title \"Je le constate, mais je ne  l'explique pas.\" Finally there are C. Lombroso, the inventor of  the anthropological method of diagnosing crime, and Eusapio  Palladino.]    On the other hand, the number is increasing of those men who put no  trust in the methods of materialistic science when it deals with those  questions which have to do with \"non-matter,\" or matter which is not  accessible to our minds. Just as art is looking for help from the  primitives, so these men are turning to half-forgotten times in order to  get help from their half-forgotten methods. However, these very methods  are still alive and in use among nations whom we, from the height of our  knowledge, have been accustomed to regard with pity and scorn. To such  nations belong the Indians, who from time to time confront those learned  in our civilization with problems which we have either passed by  unnoticed or brushed aside with superficial words and explanations.  [Footnote: Frequently in such cases use is made of the word hypnotism;  that same hypnotism which, in its earlier form of mesmerism, was  disdainfully put aside by various learned bodies.] Mme. Blavatsky was  the first person, after a life of many years in India, to see a  connection between these \"savages\" and our \"civilization.\" From that  moment there began a tremendous spiritual movement which today includes  a large number of people and has even assumed a material form in the  THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY. This society consists of groups who seek to  approach the problem of the spirit by way of the INNER knowledge. The  theory of Theosophy which serves as the basis to this movement was set  out by Blavatsky in the form of a catechism in which the pupil receives  definite answers to his questions from the theosophical point of view.  [Footnote: E. P. Blavatsky, The Key of Theosophy, London, 1889.]  Theosophy, according to Blavatsky, is synonymous with ETERNAL TRUTH.  \"The new torchbearer of truth will find the minds of men prepared for  his message, a language ready for him in which to clothe the new truths  he brings, an organization awaiting his arrival, which will remove the  merely mechanical, material obstacles and difficulties from his path.\"  And then Blavatsky continues: \"The earth will be a heaven in the  twenty-first century in comparison with what it is now,\" and with these  words ends her book.    When religion, science and morality are shaken, the two last by  the strong hand of Nietzsche, and when the outer supports  threaten to fall, man turns his gaze from externals in on to  himself. Literature, music and art are the first and most  sensitive spheres in which this spiritual revolution makes itself  felt. They reflect the dark picture of the present time and show  the importance of what at first was only a little point of light  noticed by few and for the great majority non-existent. Perhaps  they even grow dark in their turn, but on the other hand they  turn away from the soulless life of the present towards those  substances and ideas which give free scope to the non-material  strivings of the soul.    A poet of this kind in the realm of literature is Maeterlinck. He  takes us into a world which, rightly or wrongly, we term  supernatural. La Princesse Maleine, Les Sept Princesses, Les  Aveugles, etc., are not people of past times as are the heroes in  Shakespeare. They are merely souls lost in the clouds, threatened  by them with death, eternally menaced by some invisible and  sombre power.    Spiritual darkness, the insecurity of ignorance and fear pervade  the world in which they move. Maeterlinck is perhaps one of the  first prophets, one of the first artistic reformers and seers to  herald the end of the decadence just described. The gloom of the  spiritual atmosphere, the terrible, but all-guiding hand, the  sense of utter fear, the feeling of having strayed from the path,  the confusion among the guides, all these are clearly felt in his  works.[Footnote: To the front tank of such seers of the decadence  belongs also Alfred Kubin. With irresistible force both Kubin's  drawings and also his novel \"Die Andere Seite\" seem to engulf us  in the terrible atmosphere of empty desolation.]    This atmosphere Maeterlinck creates principally by purely  artistic means. His material machinery (gloomy mountains,  moonlight, marshes, wind, the cries of owls, etc.) plays really a  symbolic role and helps to give  the inner note. [Footnote: When  one of Maeterlinck's plays was produced in St. Petersburg under  his own guidance, he himself at one of the rehearsals had a tower  represented by a plain piece of hanging linen. It was of no  importance to him to have elaborate scenery prepared. He did as  children, the greatest imaginers of all time, always do in their  games; for they use a stick for a horse or create entire  regiments of cavalry out of chalks. And in the same way a chalk  with a notch in it is changed from a knight into a horse. On  similar lines the imagination of the spectator plays in the  modern theatre, and especially in that of Russia, an important  part. And this is a notable element in the transition from the  material to the spiritual in the theatre of the future.]  Maeterlinck's principal technical weapon is his use of words. The  word may express an inner harmony. This inner harmony springs  partly, perhaps principally, from the object which it names. But  if the object is not itself seen, but only its name heard, the  mind of the hearer receives an abstract impression only, that is  to say as of the object dematerialized, and a corresponding  vibration is immediately set up in the HEART.    The apt use of a word (in its poetical meaning), repetition of this  word, twice, three times or even more frequently, according to the need  of the poem, will not only tend to intensify the inner harmony but also  bring to light unsuspected spiritual properties of the word itself.  Further than that, frequent repetition of a word (again a favourite game  of children, which is forgotten in after life) deprives the word of its  original external meaning. Similarly, in drawing, the abstract message  of the object drawn tends to be forgotten and its meaning lost.  Sometimes perhaps we unconsciously hear this real harmony sounding  together with the material or later on with the non-material sense of  the object. But in the latter case the true harmony exercises a direct  impression on the soul. The soul undergoes an emotion which has no  relation to any definite object, an emotion more complicated, I might  say more super-sensuous than the emotion caused by the sound of a bell  or of a stringed instrument. This line of development offers great  possibilities to the literature of the future. In an embryonic form this  word-power-has already been used in SERRES CHAUDES. [Footnote: SERRES  CHAUDES, SUIVIES DE QUINZE CHANSONS, par Maurice Maeterlinck. Brussels.  Lacomblez.] As Maeterlinck uses them, words which seem at first to  create only a neutral impression have really a more subtle value. Even a  familiar word like \"hair,\" if used in a certain way can intensify an  atmosphere of sorrow or despair. And this is Maeterlinck's method. He  shows that thunder, lightning and a moon behind driving clouds, in  themselves material means, can be used in the theatre to create a  greater sense of terror than they do in nature.    The true inner forces do not lose their strength and effect so  easily.

Land's sake!  I hope you don't feel you've come too soon.  I'll  fetch you everything on the place it's likely a redbird ever teched,  airly in the mornin' if you'll say you'll stay an' wave your torch  'long my river bank this summer. I haven't a scrap about me now.  Yes,  I have, too!  Here's a handful o' corn I was takin' to the banty  rooster; but shucks! he's fat as a young shoat now.  Corn's a leetle  big an' hard for you.  Mebby I can split it up a mite.\"    Abram took out his jack-knife, and dotting a row of grains along the  top rail, he split and shaved them down as fine as possible; and as he  reached one end of the rail, the Cardinal, with a spasmodic \"Chip!\"  dashed down and snatched a particle from the other, and flashed back to  the bush, tested, approved, and chipped his thanks.    \"Pshaw now!\" said Abram, staring wide-eyed.  \"Doesn't that beat you?  So you really are a pet?  Best kind of a pet in the whole world, too!  Makin' everybody, at sees you happy, an' havin' some chance to be happy  yourself.  An' I look like your friend?  Well!  Well!  I'm monstrous  willin' to adopt you if you'll take me; an', as for feedin', from  to-morrow on I'll find time to set your little table 'long this same  rail every day.  I s'pose Maria 'ull say 'at I'm gone plumb crazy; but,  for that matter, if I ever get her down to see you jest once, the  trick's done with her, too, for you're the prettiest thing God ever  made in the shape of a bird, 'at I ever saw.  Look at that topknot a  wavin' in the wind!  Maybe praise to the face is open disgrace; but  I'll take your share an' mine, too, an' tell you right here an' now 'at  you're the blamedest prettiest thing 'at I ever saw.    \"But Lord!  You ortn't be so careless!  Don't you know you ain't  nothin' but jest a target?  Why don't you keep out o' sight a little?  You come a-shinneyin' up to nine out o' ten men 'long the river like  this, an' your purty, coaxin', palaverin' way won't save a feather on  you.  You'll get the little red heart shot plumb outen your little red  body, an' that's what you'll get. It's a dratted shame!  An' there's  law to protect you, too.  They's a good big fine for killin' such as  you, but nobody seems to push it.  Every fool wants to test his aim,  an' you're the brightest thing on the river bank for a mark.    \"Well, if you'll stay right where you are, it 'ull be a sorry day for  any cuss 'at teches you; 'at I'll promise you, Mr. Redbird.  This  land's mine, an' if you locate on it, you're mine till time to go back  to that other old fellow 'at looks like me.  Wonder if he's any  willinger to feed you an' stand up for you 'an I am?\"    \"Here! Here! Here!\" whistled the Cardinal.    \"Well, I'm mighty glad if you're sayin' you'll stay!  Guess it will be  all right if you don't meet some o' them Limberlost hens an' tole off  to the swamp.  Lord!  the Limberlost ain't to be compared with the  river, Mr. Redbird.  You're foolish if you go!  Talkin' 'bout goin', I  must be goin' myself, or Maria will be comin' down the line fence with  the lantern; an', come to think of it, I'm a little moist, not to say  downright damp.  But then you WARNED me, didn't you, old fellow?  Well,  I told Maria seein' you 'ud be like meetin' folks, an' it has been.  Good deal more'n I counted on, an' I've talked more'n I have in a whole  year.  Hardly think now 'at I've the reputation o' being a mighty quiet  fellow, would you?\"    Abram straightened and touched his hat brim in a trim half military  salute.  \"Well, good-bye, Mr. Redbird.  Never had more pleasure meetin'  anybody in my life 'cept first time I met Maria.  You think about the  plowin', an', if you say `stay,' it's a go!  Good-bye; an' do be a  little more careful o' yourself.  See you in the mornin', right after  breakfast, no count taken o' the weather.\"    \"Wet year! Wet year!\" called the Cardinal after his retreating figure.    Abram turned and gravely saluted the second time.  The Cardinal went to  the top rail and feasted on the sweet grains of corn until his craw was  full, and then nestled in the sumac and went to sleep.  Early next  morning he was abroad and in fine toilet, and with a full voice from  the top of the sumac greeted the day--\"Wet year! Wet year!\"    Far down the river echoed his voice until it so closely resembled some  member of his family replying that he followed, searching the banks  mile after mile on either side, until finally he heard voices of his  kind.  He located them, but it was only several staid old couples, a  long time mated, and busy with their nest-building.  The Cardinal  returned to the sumac, feeling a degree lonelier than ever.    He decided to prospect in the opposite direction, and taking wing, he  started up the river.  Following the channel, he winged his flight for  miles over the cool sparkling water, between the tangle of foliage  bordering the banks.  When he came to the long cumbrous structures of  wood with which men had bridged the river, where the shuffling feet of  tired farm horses raised clouds of dust and set the echoes rolling with  their thunderous hoof beats, he was afraid; and rising high, he sailed  over them in short broken curves of flight.  But where giant maple and  ash, leaning, locked branches across the channel in one of old Mother  Nature's bridges for the squirrels, he knew no fear, and dipped so low  beneath them that his image trailed a wavering shadow on the silver  path he followed.    He rounded curve after curve, and frequently stopping on a conspicuous  perch, flung a ringing challenge in the face of the morning.  With  every mile the way he followed grew more beautiful. The river bed was  limestone, and the swiftly flowing water, clear and limpid.  The banks  were precipitate in some places, gently sloping in others, and always  crowded with a tangle of foliage.    At an abrupt curve in the river he mounted to the summit of a big ash  and made boastful prophecy, \"Wet year! Wet year!\" and on all sides  there sprang up the voices of his kind.  Startled, the Cardinal took  wing.  He followed the river in a circling flight until he remembered  that here might be the opportunity to win the coveted river mate, and  going slower to select the highest branch on which to display his  charms, he discovered that he was only a few yards from the ash from  which he had made his prediction.  The Cardinal flew over the narrow  neck and sent another call, then without awaiting a reply, again he  flashed up the river and circled Horseshoe Bend.  When he came to the  same ash for the third time, he understood.    The river circled in one great curve.  The Cardinal mounted to the  tip-top limb of the ash and looked around him.  There was never a  fairer sight for the eye of man or bird.  The mist and shimmer of early  spring were in the air.  The Wabash rounded Horseshoe Bend in a silver  circle, rimmed by a tangle of foliage bordering both its banks; and  inside lay a low open space covered with waving marsh grass and the  blue bloom of sweet calamus.  Scattered around were mighty trees, but  conspicuous above any, in the very center, was a giant sycamore, split  at its base into three large trees, whose waving branches seemed to  sweep the face of heaven, and whose roots, like miserly fingers,  clutched deep into the black muck of Rainbow Bottom.    It was in this lovely spot that the rainbow at last materialized, and  at its base, free to all humanity who cared to seek, the Great  Alchemist had left His rarest treasures--the gold of sunshine, diamond  water-drops, emerald foliage, and sapphire sky.    For good measure, there were added seeds, berries, and insects for the  birds; and wild flowers, fruit, and nuts for the children.  Above all,  the sycamore waved its majestic head.    It made a throne that seemed suitable for the son of the king; and  mounting to its topmost branch, for miles the river carried his  challenge: \"Ho, cardinals! Look this way! Behold me! Have you seen any  other of so great size? Have you any to equal my grace?  Who can  whistle so loud, so clear, so compelling a note? Who will fly to me for  protection? Who will come and be my mate?\"    He flared his crest high, swelled his throat with rolling notes, and  appeared so big and brilliant that among the many cardinals that had  gathered to hear, there was not one to compare with him.    Black envy filled their hearts.  Who was this flaming dashing stranger,  flaunting himself in the faces of their females? There were many  unmated cardinals in Rainbow Bottom, and many jealous males.  A second  time the Cardinal, rocking and flashing, proclaimed himself; and there  was a note of feminine approval so strong that he caught it.  Tilting  on a twig, his crest flared to full height, his throat swelled to  bursting, his heart too big for his body, the Cardinal shouted his  challenge for the third time; when clear and sharp arose a cry in  answer, \"Here! Here!  Here!\"  It came from a female that had accepted  the caresses of the brightest cardinal in Rainbow Bottom only the day  before, and had spent the morning carrying twigs to a thicket of red  haws.    The Cardinal, with a royal flourish, sprang in air to seek her; but her  outraged mate was ahead of him, and with a scream she fled, leaving a  tuft of feathers in her mate's beak.  In turn the Cardinal struck him  like a flashing rocket, and then red war waged in Rainbow Bottom.  The  females scattered for cover with all their might.  The Cardinal worked  in a kiss on one poor little bird, too frightened to escape him; then  the males closed in, and serious business began.  The Cardinal would  have enjoyed a fight vastly with two or three opponents; but a  half-dozen made discretion better than valour.  He darted among them,  scattering them right and left, and made for the sycamore.  With all  his remaining breath, he insolently repeated his challenge; and then  headed down"]]]
