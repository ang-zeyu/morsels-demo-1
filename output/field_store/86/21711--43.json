Here they come, my dear!\"    As she spoke, there before the throne appeared Uncle Henry and Aunt Em,  who for a moment stood motionless, glaring with white and startled  faces at the scene that confronted them.  If the ladies and gentlemen  present had not been so polite I am sure they would have laughed at the  two strangers.    Aunt Em had her calico dress skirt \"tucked up,\" and she wore a faded,  blue-checked apron.  Her hair was rather straggly and she had on a pair  of Uncle Henry's old slippers.  In one hand she held a dish-towel and  in the other a cracked earthenware plate, which she had been engaged in  wiping when so suddenly transported to the Land of Oz.    Uncle Henry, when the summons came, had been out in the barn \"doin'  chores.\"  He wore a ragged and much soiled straw hat, a checked shirt  without any collar and blue overalls tucked into the tops of his old  cowhide boots.    \"By gum!\" gasped Uncle Henry, looking around as if bewildered.    \"Well, I swan!\" gurgled Aunt Em in a hoarse, frightened voice.  Then  her eyes fell upon Dorothy, and she said: \"D-d-d-don't that look like  our little girl--our Dorothy, Henry?\"    \"Hi, there--look out, Em!\" exclaimed the old man, as Aunt Em advanced a  step; \"take care o' the wild beastses, or you're a goner!\"    But now Dorothy sprang forward and embraced and kissed her aunt and  uncle affectionately, afterward taking their hands in her own.    \"Don't be afraid,\" she said to them.  \"You are now in the Land of Oz,  where you are to live always, and be comfer'ble an' happy.  You'll  never have to worry over anything again, 'cause there won't be anything  to worry about.  And you owe it all to the kindness of my friend  Princess Ozma.\"    Here she led them before the throne and continued:    \"Your Highness, this is Uncle Henry.  And this is Aunt Em.  They want  to thank you for bringing them here from Kansas.\"    Aunt Em tried to \"slick\" her hair, and she hid the dish-towel and dish  under her apron while she bowed to the lovely Ozma.  Uncle Henry took  off his straw hat and held it awkwardly in his hands.    But the Ruler of Oz rose and came from her throne to greet her newly  arrived guests, and she smiled as sweetly upon them as if they had been  a king and queen.    \"You are very welcome here, where I have brought you for Princess  Dorothy's sake,\" she said, graciously, \"and I hope you will be quite  happy in your new home.\"  Then she turned to her courtiers, who were  silently and gravely regarding the scene, and added: \"I present to my  people our Princess Dorothy's beloved Uncle Henry and Aunt Em, who will  hereafter be subjects of our kingdom.  It will please me to have you  show them every kindness and honor in your power, and to join me in  making them happy and contented.\"    Hearing this, all those assembled bowed low and respectfully to the old  farmer and his wife, who bobbed their own heads in return.    \"And now,\" said Ozma to them, \"Dorothy will show you the rooms prepared  for you.  I hope you will like them, and shall expect you to join me at  luncheon.\"    So Dorothy led her relatives away, and as soon as they were out of the  Throne Room and alone in the corridor, Aunt Em squeezed Dorothy's hand  and said:    \"Child, child!  How in the world did we ever get here so quick?  And is  it all real?  And are we to stay here, as she says?  And what does it  all mean, anyhow?\"    Dorothy laughed.    \"Why didn't you tell us what you were goin' to do?\" inquired Uncle  Henry, reproachfully.  \"If I'd known about it, I'd 'a put on my Sunday  clothes.\"    \"I'll 'splain ever'thing as soon as we get to your rooms,\" promised  Dorothy.  \"You're in great luck, Uncle Henry and Aunt Em; an' so am I!  And oh! I'm so happy to have got you here, at last!\"    As he walked by the little girl's side, Uncle Henry stroked his  whiskers thoughtfully.  \"'Pears to me, Dorothy, we won't make bang-up  fairies,\" he remarked.    \"An' my back hair looks like a fright!\" wailed Aunt Em.    \"Never mind,\" returned the little girl, reassuringly.  \"You won't have  anything to do now but to look pretty, Aunt Em; an' Uncle Henry won't  have to work till his back aches, that's certain.\"    \"Sure?\" they asked, wonderingly, and in the same breath.    \"Course I'm sure,\" said Dorothy.  \"You're in the Fairyland of Oz, now;  an' what's more, you belong to it!\"        6.  How Guph Visited the Whimsies    The new General of the Nome King's army knew perfectly well that to  fail in his plans meant death for him.  Yet he was not at all anxious  or worried.  He hated every one who was good and longed to make all who  were happy unhappy.  Therefore he had accepted this dangerous position  as General quite willingly, feeling sure in his evil mind that he would  be able to do a lot of mischief and finally conquer the Land of Oz.    Yet Guph determined to be careful, and to lay his plans well, so as not  to fail.  He argued that only careless people fail in what they attempt  to do.    The mountains underneath which the Nome King's extensive caverns were  located lay grouped just north of the Land of Ev, which lay directly  across the deadly desert to the east of the Land of Oz.  As the  mountains were also on the edge of the desert the Nome King found that  he had only to tunnel underneath the desert to reach Ozma's dominions.  He did not wish his armies to appear above ground in the Country of the  Winkies, which was the part of the Land of Oz nearest to King Roquat's  own country, as then the people would give the alarm and enable Ozma to  fortify the Emerald City and assemble an army.  He wanted to take all  the Oz people by surprise; so he decided to run the tunnel clear  through to the Emerald City, where he and his hosts could break through  the ground without warning and conquer the people before they had time  to defend themselves.    Roquat the Red began work at once upon his tunnel, setting a thousand  miners at the task and building it high and broad enough for his armies  to march through it with ease.  The Nomes were used to making tunnels,  as all the kingdom in which they lived was under ground; so they made  rapid progress.    While this work was going on General Guph started out alone to visit  the Chief of the Whimsies.    These Whimsies were curious people who lived in a retired country of  their own.  They had large, strong bodies, but heads so small that they  were no bigger than door-knobs.  Of course, such tiny heads could not  contain any great amount of brains, and the Whimsies were so ashamed of  their personal appearance and lack of commonsense that they wore big  heads made of pasteboard, which they fastened over their own little  heads.  On these pasteboard heads they sewed sheep's wool for hair, and  the wool was colored many tints--pink, green and lavender being the  favorite colors.  The faces of these false heads were painted in many  ridiculous ways, according to the whims of the owners, and these big,  burly creatures looked so whimsical and absurd in their queer masks  that they were called \"Whimsies.\"  They foolishly imagined that no one  would suspect the little heads that were inside the imitation ones, not  knowing that it is folly to try to appear otherwise than as nature has  made us.    The Chief of the Whimsies had as little wisdom as the others, and had  been chosen chief merely because none among them was any wiser or more  capable of ruling.  The Whimsies were evil spirits and could not be  killed.  They were hated and feared by every one and were known as  terrible fighters because they were so strong and muscular and had not  sense enough to know when they were defeated.    General Guph thought the Whimsies would be a great help to the Nomes in  the conquest of Oz, for under his leadership they could be induced to  fight as long so they could stand up.  So he traveled to their country  and asked to see the Chief, who lived in a house that had a picture of  his grotesque false head painted over the doorway.    The Chief's false head had blue hair, a turned-up nose, and a mouth  that stretched half across the face.  Big green eyes had been painted  upon it, but in the center of the chin were two small holes made in the  pasteboard, so that the Chief could see through them with his own tiny  eyes; for when the big head was fastened upon his shoulders the eyes in  his own natural head were on a level with the false chin.    Said General Guph to the Chief of the Whimsies:    \"We Nomes are going to conquer the Land of Oz and capture our King's  Magic Belt, which the Oz people stole from him.  Then we are going to  plunder and destroy the whole country.  And we want the Whimsies to  help us.\"    \"Will there be any fighting?\" asked the Chief.    \"Plenty,\" replied Guph.    That must have pleased the Chief, for he got up and danced around the  room three times.  Then he seated himself again, adjusted his false  head, and said:    \"We have no quarrel with Ozma of Oz.\"    \"But you Whimsies love to fight, and here is a splendid chance to do  so,\" urged Guph.    \"Wait till I sing a song,\" said the Chief.  Then he lay back in his  chair and sang a foolish song that did not seem to the General to mean  anything, although he listened carefully.  When he had finished, the  Chief Whimsie looked at him through the holes in his chin and asked:    \"What reward will you give us if we help you?\"    The General was prepared for this question, for he had been thinking  the matter over on his journey.  People often do a good deed without  hope of reward, but for an evil deed they always demand payment.    \"When we get our Magic Belt,\" he made reply, \"our King, Roquat the Red,  will use its power to give every Whimsie a natural head as big and fine  as the false head he now wears.  Then you will no longer be ashamed  because your big strong bodies have such teenty-weenty heads.\"    \"Oh!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5173"],[0,"The Religion of the Samurai (#6)"],[1,"Monastery for eight months as a pounder of rice in order to qualify  himself to be a Zen teacher.      [FN#42]  The book was translated into Chinese by Kumarajiva in A.D.  384. 417; also by Bodhiruci in A.D. 509, and by Paramartha in A.D.  592; then by Hiuen Tsang in A.D. 648.  Many commentaries have been  written on it by the prominent Buddhist authors of China and Japan.        9. The Spiritual Attainment of the Sixth Patriarch.    Some time before his death (in 675 A.D.) the Fifth Patriarch  announced to all disciples that the Spirit of Shakya Muni is hard to  realize, that they should express their own views on it, on condition  that anyone who could prove his right realization should be given  with the Kachaya and created the Sixth Patriarch.  Then the venerable  Sung Siu, the head of the seven hundred disciples, who was considered  by his brothers to be the man entitled to the honour, composed the  following verses:    \"The body is the Bodhi-tree.[FN#43]  The mind is like a mirror bright on its stand.  Dust it and wipe it from time to time,  Lest it be dimmed by dust and dirt.\"      [FN#43]  The idea expressed by these lines is clear enough.  Body is  likened to the Bodhi-tree, under which Shakya Muni attained to his  supreme enlightenment; for it is not in another body in the future  existence, but in this very body that one had to get enlightened.  And mind is pure and bright in its nature like a mirror, but the dirt  and dust of passions and of low desires often pollute and dim it.  Therefore one should dust and wipe it from time to time in order to  keep it bright.      All who read these lines thought that the writer was worthy of the  expected reward, and the Fifth Patriarch also, appreciating the  significance of the verses, said: \"If men in the future would  practise Zen according to this view, they would acquire an excellent  result.\"  Hwui Nang, the rice-pounder, hearing of them, however,  secretly remarked that they are beautiful, but hardly expressive of  the Spirit of Shakya Muni, and wrote his own verses, which ran as  follows:    \"There is no Bodhi-tree,[FN#44]  Nor is there a mirror stand.  Nothing exists from the first  What can be dimmed by dust and dirt?\"      [FN#44]  These verses have often been misunderstood as expressive of  a nihilistic view, but the real meaning is anything but nihilistic.  Mind is pure and bright in its essence.  It is always free from  passions and mean desires, just as the sun is always bright, despite  of cloud and mist that cover its face.  Therefore one must get an  insight into this essential nature of Mind, and realize that one has  no mean desires and passions from the first, and also that there is  no tree of Bodhi nor the mirror of Enlightenment without him, but  they are within him.      Perhaps nobody ever dreamed such an insignificant fellow as the  rice-pounder could surpass the venerable scholar in a religious  insight, but the Fifth Patriarch saw at once an Enlightened Soul  expressed in those lines; therefore he made up his mind to give the  Kachaya to the writer, in whom he found a great spiritual leader of  future generations.  But he did it secretly at midnight, lest some of  the disciples from envy do violence to Hwui Nang.  He was, moreover,  cautious enough to advise his successor to leave the Monastery at  once, and go back to the South, that the latter might conceal his  Enlightenment until a time would come for his missionary activities.        10. Flight of the Sixth Patriarch.    On the following morning the news of what had happened during the  night flew from mouth to mouth, and some of the enraged brothers  attempted to pursue the worthy fugitive.  The foremost among them,  Hwui Ming (E-myo), overtook the Sixth Patriarch at a mountain pass  not very far from the Monastery.  Then Hwui Nang, laying down the  Kachaya on a rock by the road, addressed the pursuer: \"This is a mere  symbol of the patriarchal authority, and it is not a thing to be  obtained by force.  Take it along with you, if you long for it.\"  Upon this Hwui Ming, who began to be ashamed of his base act, tried  to lift the Kachaya, but in vain, for it was, as he felt, as heavy as  the rock itself.  At last he said to the Sixth Patriarch: \"I have  come here, my brother, not for the sake of this robe, but for the  sake of the Law.  Grant my hearty desire of getting Enlightened.\"  \"If you have come for the Law,\" replied Hwui Nang, \"you must put an  end to all your struggles and longings.  Think neither of good nor of  evil (make your mind pure from all idle thoughts), then see how is,  Hwui Ming, your original (mental) physiognomy!\"  Being thus  questioned, Ming found in an instant the Divine Light of Buddha  within himself, and became a disciple of the Sixth Patriarch.        11. The Development of the Southern and of the Northern School of Zen.    After the death of the Fifth Patriarch the venerable Shang Siu,  though not the legitimate successor of his master, was not inactive  in the propagation of the faith, and gathered about him a number of  enthusiastic admirers.  This led to the foundation of the Northern  school of Zen in opposition to the Southern school led by the Sixth  Patriarch.  The Empress Tseh Tien Wa Heu,[FN#45] the real ruler of  China at that time, was an admirer of Shang Siu, and patronized his  school, which nevertheless made no further development.      [FN#45]  The Emperor Chung Tsung (Chu-so, A.D. 684-704) was a nominal  sovereign, and the Empress was the real ruler from A.D. 684 to 705.      In the meanwhile the Sixth Patriarch, who had gone to the South,  arrived at the Fah Sing Monastery in Kwang Cheu, where Yin Tsung  (In-shu), the abbot, was giving lectures on the Mahayana sutras to a  number of student monks.  It was towards evening that he happened to  overhear two monks of the Monastery discussing about the flag  floating in air.  One of them said: \"It is the wind that moves in  reality, but not the flag.\"  \"No,\" objected the other, \"it is the  flag that moves in reality, but not the wind.\"  Thus each of them  insisted on his own one-sided view, and came to no proper conclusion.   Then the Sixth Patriarch introduced himself and said to them: \"It is  neither the wind nor the flag, but your mind that moves in reality.\"  Yin Tsung, having heard these words of the stranger, was greatly  astonished, and thought the latter should have been an extraordinary  personage.  And when he found the man to be the Sixth Patriarch of  Zen, he and all his disciples decided to follow Zen under the master.   Consequently Hwui Nang, still clad like a layman, changed his  clothes, and began his patriarchal career at that Monastery.  This is  the starting-point of the great development of Zen in China.        12. Missionary Activity of the Sixth Patriarch.    As we have seen above, the Sixth Patriarch was a great genius, and  may be justly called a born Zen teacher.  He was a man of no  erudition, being a poor farmer, who had served under the Fifth  Patriarch as a rice-pounder only for eight months, but he could find  a new meaning in Buddhist terms, and show how to apply it to  practical life.  On one occasion, for instance, Fah Tah (Ho-tatsu), a  monk who had read over the Saddharma-pundarika-sutra[FN#46] three  thousand times, visited him to be instructed in Zen.  \"Even if you  read the sutra ten thousand times,\" said the Sixth Patriarch, who  could never read the text, \"it will do you no good, if you cannot  grasp the spirit of the sutra.\"  \"I have simply recited the book,\"  confessed the monk, \"as it is written in characters.  How could such  a dull fellow as I grasp its spirit?\"  \"Then recite it once,\"  responded the master; \"I shall explain its spirit.\"  Hereupon Fah Tah  began to recite the sutra, and when he read it until the end of the  second chapter the teacher stopped him, saying: \"You may stop there.  Now I know that this sutra was preached to show the so-called  greatest object of Shakya Muni's appearing on earth.  That greatest  object was to have all sentient beings Enlightened just as He  Himself.\"  In this way the Sixth Patriarch grasped the essentials of  the Mahayana sutras, and freely made use of them as the explanation  of the practical questions about Zen.      [FN#46]  One of the most noted Mahayana sutras, translated by  Dharmaraksa (A.D. 286) and by Kumarajiva (A.D. 406).  The reader has  to note that the author states the essential doctrine in the second  chapter.  See \" Sacred Books of the East,\" vol. xxi., pp. 30-59.        13. The Disciples under the Sixth Patriarch.    Some time after this the Sixth Patriarch settled himself down at the  Pao Lin Monastery, better known as Tsao Ki Shan (So-kei-zan), in Shao  Cheu, and it grow into a great centre of Zen in the Southern States.  Under his instruction many eminent Zen masters qualified themselves  as Leaders of the Three Worlds.  He did not give the patriarchal  symbol, the Kachaya, to his successors, lest it might cause needless  quarrels among the brethren, as was experienced by himself.  He only  gave sanction to his disciples who attained to Enlightenment, and  allowed them to teach Zen in a manner best suited to their own  personalities.  For instance, Huen Kioh (Gen-kaku), a scholar of the  Tien Tai doctrine,[FN#47] well known as the Teacher of Yung  Kia[FN#48] (Yo-ka), received a sanction for his spiritual attainment  after exchanging a few words with the master in their first  interview, and was at once acknowledged as a Zen teacher.  When he  reached the zenith of his fame, he was presented with a crystal bowl  together with rich gifts by the Empress Tseh Tien; and it was in A.D.  705 that the Emperor Chung Tsung invited him in vain to proceed to  the palace, since the latter followed the example of the Fourth  Patriarch.      [FN#47]  The Teacher of Tien Tai (Ten-dai, A.D. 538-597), the founder  of the Buddhist sect of the same name, was a great scholar of"]]]
