To counteract the evil effect of Lyman Wight's communication to the  _Whig_, Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon and Hyrum Smith, then the presiding  quorum of the Church, published a letter in the _Whig_, from which I  make the following quotation:        We have not at any time thought there was any political party,      as such, chargeable with the Missouri barbarities, neither any      religious society, as such. They were committed by a mob, composed      of all parties, regardless of difference of opinion, either      political or religious.        The determined stand in this State, and by the people of Quincy      in particular, made against the lawless outrages of the Missouri      mobbers by all parties in politics and religion, have entitled      them equally to our thanks and our profoundest regards, and such,      gentlemen, we hope they will always receive from us. * * * We wish      to say to the public, through your paper, that we disclaim any      intention of making a political question of our difficulties with      Missouri, believing that we are not justified in so doing.    Lyman Wight was a bold, independent-spirited man; inclined to be  self-willed and refractory. No one could control him; and even counsel  or advice was usually disregarded--except it was from Joseph Smith. A  few years subsequent to the time of which I am now writing, Lyman Wight  himself said: \"Joseph Smith is the only man who ever did control me;  he is the only man who ever shall.\" But to Joseph's words Lyman Wight  gave respectful attention, and bent his own strong will to comply with  the wishes of the Prophet. He himself was a master spirit, and could  apparently bring himself to acknowledge but one to whom he was willing  to yield his own judgment and his own will, and that one was Joseph  Smith. It is said by those acquainted with him, that in the Prophet's  hands his spirit was as pliable as that of a child.    It was one of Joseph's peculiar characteristics to be able to control  men--men, too, who were themselves master spirits; who were themselves  naturally leaders; and it is seldom, indeed, that such characters are  willing to take a second place. But in the presence of Joseph they  seemed naturally to accord him the leadership. He was a leader even  among master spirits; a leader of leaders; and it may not be amiss  here to briefly inquire into the apparently mysterious influence which  the Prophet exerted over the minds of others, by reason of which he  controlled them, since this particular instance in which Lyman Wight  figures, illustrates it.    In reply to the letter of R. B. Thompson, Joseph admitted that the  course of Wight was unfair, and said: The Church was not willing to  make of their troubles a political question; but he also said that  he considered it to be \"the indefeasible right of every free man to  hold his own opinion in politics and religion;\" and therefore would  have it understood that, as an individual, Lyman Wight had the right  to entertain and express whatever opinion he pleased in regard to  their troubles in Missouri; only intimating that care should be taken  not to set forth individual views as the views of The Church. In  writing to Lyman Wight on the subject, Joseph did not upbraid him,  nor peremptorily order him to discontinue the publication of his  letters, or retract them, but he informed him that the matter had been  considered in a council of The Church, and that the result was that  his course was disapproved. But Joseph took occasion to express his  confidence in Wight's good intentions, and said:        Knowing your integrity of principle, and steadfastness in the cause      of Christ, I feel not to exercise even the privilege of counsel on      the subject, save only to request that you will endeavor to bear      in mind the importance of the subject, and how easy it might be to      get a misunderstanding with the brethren concerning it; and though      last, but not least, that whilst you continue to go upon your own      credit, you will steer clear of making The Church appear as either      supporting or opposing you in your politics, lest such a course may      have a tendency to bring about persecution on The Church, where a      little wisdom and caution may avoid it. I do not know that there is      any occasion for my thus cautioning you in this thing, but having      done so, I hope it will be well taken, and that all things shall      eventually be found to work together for the good of the Saints.      * * * With every possible feeling of love and friendship for an      old fellow-prisoner and brother in the Lord, I remain, sir, your      sincere friend.    Throughout this whole affair it will be observed that Joseph starts out  with the idea that every individual is absolutely free and independent  as to entertaining views and in giving expression to them, both in  politics and religion, so long as he makes no one else responsible  for them; that in correcting Lyman Wight, he does it by appealing  to the man's reason, and by pointing out the possible result of his  course, which may be avoided by a little discretion; while the whole  communication breathes such a spirit of confidence in the man he is  correcting, and love for him as an \"old fellow-prisoner,\" that it was  altogether irresistible. And this is the secret of Joseph's power to  control his brethren. There was no petty tyranny in his government.  He was above that. Every right he claimed for himself, he accorded to  others; while his mildness in correcting errors and his unbounded love  for his brethren knit them to him in bands stronger than steel. It was  ever his method to teach correct principles and allow men to govern  themselves.        CHAPTER VI.    A DAY OF GOD'S POWER.    DURING the summer of 1839 the Saints who had been driven from Missouri  continued to gather at Nauvoo and settle on the lands which had been  purchased by The Church authorities. The violent persecution they had  passed through in Missouri had well nigh wrecked the people. They had  been stripped of their earthly possessions, until they were reduced to  the most abject poverty. And the exposure and hardships endured made  them an easy prey to the malaria that infected Nauvoo and vicinity.  Another thing which doubtless contributed to make them unable to resist  the ravages of disease, was the fact that a period of relaxation was  following the intense excitement under which they had lived for more  than two years.    The spirit has such power when it is once thoroughly aroused, that  for a time it so braces up the body as to make it almost impregnable  to disease and unconscious of fatigue. But this cannot continue long.  It wears out the body; and as soon as the excitement is removed, then  comes the period of relaxation and the body sinks down from sheer  exhaustion.    Such was the condition of the exiled Saints who came flocking into  Nauvoo, in the summer of 1839. They had reached a haven of rest. The  fearful strain on the nervous system under which they had labored  during the mobbings in Missouri and their flight from that State was  removed; and they fell down in Nauvoo exhausted, to be a prey to the  deadly malaria prevalent in that locality. Such was their condition on  the morning of the 22nd of July. Joseph's house was crowded with the  sick whom he was trying to nurse back to health. In his door-yard were  a number of people camped in tents, who had but newly arrived, but upon  whom the fever had seized. Joseph himself was prostrate with sickness,  and the general distress of the Saints weighed down his spirit with  sadness. While still thinking of the trials of his people in the past,  and the gloom that then overshadowed them, the purifying influence  of God's Spirit rested upon him and he was immediately healed. He  arose and began to administer to the sick in his house, all of whom  immediately recovered. He then healed those encamped in his door-yard,  and from thence went from house to house calling on the sick to arise  from their beds of affliction, and they obeyed and were healed.    In company with P.P. Pratt, Orson Pratt, John Taylor, Heber C. Kimball,  and John E. Page, he crossed the river to Montrose, and healed the sick  there. One case is mentioned by all who have written on the subject  as being very remarkable. This was the case of Elijah Fordham. He was  almost unconscious and nearly dead. Bending over him, the Prophet asked  the dying man if he knew him, and believed him to be a servant of God.  In a whisper he replied that he did. Joseph then took him by the hand,  and with an energy that would have awoke the dead, he commanded him  in the name of Jesus Christ to arise from his bed and walk. Brother  Fordham leaped from his bed, removed the bandages and mustard plasters  from his feet, dressed himself, ate a bowl of bread and milk, and  accompanied the Prophet to other houses on his mission of love.    All day the work continued; and to the Saints who witnessed the  remarkable manifestation of God's power in behalf of the sick, the  twenty-second day of July, 1839, is remembered with gratitude to  Almighty God, who through the demonstration of His power that day, gave  an indisputable witness to the world that He was with Joseph Smith,  and had authorized him to speak in the name of Jesus Christ. To the  Saints it was a testimony that God was with them; for they witnessed a  fulfillment of God's ancient promise to His people, viz.--        Is any sick among you? Let him call for the Elders of the Church;      and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil, in the name of      the Lord: and the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord      shall raise him up.

(April, 1845), at a      little past 6, a goodly number of Saints had the honor, and glory      to witness the capstone of the Temple laid in its place.\"    In a letter from Elder John Taylor to Joseph Cain (Mill. Star, 8:31),  we find this:        \"My feelings were very peculiar while standing in the font, which      is of stone, and passing through the rooms when I thought how the      Saints had labored and striven to complete the building.\"    And in the Times and Seasons, volume 6, page 1017:        \"On Sunday, the 5th of October (1845) through the indefatigable      exertions, unceasing industry, and heaven blessed labors, in the      midst of trials, tribulations, poverty, and worldly obstacles,      solemnized, in some instances, by death, about 5,000 Saints had the      inexpressible joy and great gratification to meet for the first      time in the house of the Lord in the city of Joseph (Nauvoo). From      mites and tithing, millions had risen up to the glory of God, as a      Temple where the children of the last kingdom, could come together      and praise the Lord.\"    There are other passages; but these ought to suffice on this point of  the diligence of the Saints. But some one will say, all this testimony  is from those who are interested--from your friends. Should we take the  testimony of our enemies, those who are interested in our downfall,  and who are not acquainted with these facts? However, I will add the  testimony of one who hoped that the Temple would not be finished. In  the Messenger and Advocate of June, 1846, published by Sidney Rigdon, I  quote the following:        \"That people [the Saints with Brigham Young] were told that they      would not finish that Temple which THEY were building. They were      told that they would get the roof on, and do some of the inside      work, but never would finish it.\"    Now mark this; he adds:        \"No people ever labored harder to prove the above declaration      false. No pains were spared; but where has it terminated? Just as      we said it would.\"    Here we have the testimony of Sidney Rigdon, who opposed the Twelve  and the Church and the building of that Temple. Yet he says they were  diligent, but when he says it was not completed, he spoke too soon.  This article was written just shortly after the exodus commenced, and  at that time the Temple was not quite finished; but it was finished  before all the Saints' left Nauvoo.    I suppose that it is unnecessary to continue this branch of the subject  any further, but since our Church members have to meet the sophistry on  the part of the elders of the \"Reorganization,\" we will.      NAUVOO TEMPLE COMPLETED.    In proof that the Temple was completed I present the following  evidence. In the Times and Seasons, volume 6, page 1017, we find the  following:        \"It certainly afforded a holy satisfaction to think that since      the 6th of April, 1841, when the first stone was laid, amidst      the most straightened circumstances, the Church of Jesus Christ      of Latter-day Saints has witnessed their bread cast upon waters;      or more properly their obedience to the commandments of the Lord      appear in the tangible form of a Temple, entirely enclosed, windows      in, with temporary floors, pulpits, and seats to accommodate so      many persons preparatory to a general conference.\"    And on page 1018:        \"The font and the other parts of the Temple will be in readiness      in a few days to commence the administration of holy ordinances of      endowment, for which the faithful have long diligently labored and      fervently prayed, desiring above all things to see the beauty of      the Lord and inquire in His holy Temple.\"    Now, this was given in October, 1845, and we learn that the font--that  is the permanent font, which replaced the former and temporary  one--also the other parts of the Temple would be in readiness in a few  days to commence the administration of holy ordinances. I wish now  to refer to another reference from the writings of the president of  the \"Reorganization.\" I have already read where he declares that the  font and the first floor above the basement and one stairway, also the  basement, were completed. He reaffirms that in the following from an  editorial in the Saints' Herald of February 17, 1904:        \"Work continued to be done on the Temple until the fall of 1845,      possibly until the summer of 1846\"--you see he is not quite sure      about it--\"but the building was never finished; and whatever      ordinances were performed in it took place in rooms not wholly      finished.\"    Now note this particularly:        \"The north stairway, the second or upper auditorium, and the attic      were entirely incompleted.\"    We will now examine the Times and Seasons of January 20, 1846, and see  what his testimony is worth. Here on page 1096 occurs the following:        \"January thus far has been mild, which, in the midst of our      preparations for an exodus next spring, has given an excellent time      to finish the Temple. Nothing has appeared so much like a finish of      that holy edifice as the present.\"    Now, I want to call your attention to this which immediately follows:        \"The ATTIC story was finished in December.\"    That is in December 1845. You will remember that the president of the  Reorganization declares that the attic was \"entirely incompleted.\" But  to continue the quotation:        \"And if the Lord continues to favor us, the first story above the      basement will be completed ready for meeting, in the month of      February. The font, standing upon 12 stone oxen, is about ready,      and the floor of the story is laid, so that all speculation about      the Temple of God at Nauvoo, must cease.\"    Now the temporary floors were laid in October, 1845, so these floors  must have been the permanent ones, and while the temporary finishing in  October was for the purpose of fitting the building for the ordinances,  this finishing was permanent.    Here is an interesting feature about the testimony of this man. The  parts of the Temple which the president of the \"Reorganized\" Church  says were completed--finished, the Times and Seasons here states would  not be finished for a few days, or till February, but the part of the  building which he says was \"entirely incompleted,\" is here declared  to have been finished in the past December, 1845. I shall not dispute  with him the fact that the parts which he says were finished, were  completed, for they were; but what does his testimony amount to as  evidence when confronted with the statement of the Times and Seasons?  Simply nothing; more than to prove that he knew nothing about it at  all. Now which shall we believe? The Times and Seasons, published  at the time, or the president of the \"Reorganization,\" who made his  statement some 40 years later? Remember if he admits that the Temple  was finished his whole structure crumbles to the ground--it's bound to  crumble anyway sooner or later, for it is built upon the sand.    Elder John Taylor, in an address to the Saints in England, published in  the Millennial Star of November, 1846, (vol. 8:97) has this to say:        \"Time alone can unfold this to many, but to us it has been      manifested long ago, years before the Temple WAS COMPLETED, and      long before the martyrdom of our Prophet and Patriarch.\"    Here he declares that the Temple was completed. Now our friends quote  from the remarks of President Brigham Young delivered at the dedication  of the St. George Temple to the effect that up to that time the Saints  had never had the privilege of completing and enjoying a Temple. I call  your attention to the fact that President Brigham Young left Nauvoo  before the Temple was finished. He left in February, 1846, and a great  portion of the Latter-day Saints were expelled from that city before  they had the privilege of receiving the ordinances of the house of God,  therefore President Young was correct when he said we had not up to  that time had the privilege of completing and enjoying one. But I will  now call your attention to the statement of President Young's made in  October, 1863, (News, 13:96). Said he,        \"We have already built two Temples, one at Kirtland, Ohio, and one      at Nauvoo, Illinois. * * * God commanded us to build the Nauvoo      Temple, and we built it, and performed our duty pretty well. There      are elders present here today who labored on that house with not a      shoe to their foot, or pantaloons that would cover their limbs, or a      shirt to cover their arms.        \"We performed the work, and performed it WITHIN THE TIME WHICH      THE LORD GAVE US TO DO IT IN. Apostates said that we never could      perform that work, but through the blessing of God it was completed      and accepted of Him. Apostates never build Temples unto God, but      the Saints are called to do this work.\"    The Nauvoo Temple was publicly dedicated May 1, 1846, by Elder Orson  Hyde, and the"]]]
