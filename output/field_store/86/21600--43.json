[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39685"],[0,"Nooks and Corners of Old England (#6)"],[1,"the ear!\" This was scarcely to the point, and since we have  discovered that the ancient Jacobean gateway is at Hawstead Place after  all, we cannot place the Suffolk rustic intelligence above the average.  It is in the kitchen garden, and in the alcoves of the pillars are  moulded bricks with initials and hearts commemorating the union of Sir  Thomas Cullum with the daughter of Sir Henry North. The moat is still to  be seen, but the bridge spanning it has given way. The principal ruins  of the old mansion were removed about a century ago.    Gedding Hall, midway between Bury and Needham Market, is moated and  picturesque, and before it was restored must have been a perfect  picture, for as it is now it just misses being what it might have been  under very careful treatment. A glaring red-brick tower has been added,  which looks painfully new and out of keeping; and beneath two quaint old  gables, a front door has been placed which would look very well in  Fitz-John's Avenue or Bedford Park, but certainly not here. When old  houses are nowadays so carefully restored so that occasionally it is  really difficult to see where the old work ends and the new begins, one  regrets that the care that is being bestowed upon West Stow could not  have been lavished here.    We come across another instance of bad restoration at Bildeston. There  is a good old timber house at the top of the village street which,  carefully treated, would have been a delight to the eye; but the carved  oak corner-post has been enveloped in hideous yellow brickwork in such a  fashion that one would rather have wished the place had been pulled  down. But at the farther end of the village there is another old timber  house, Newbury Farm, with carved beams and very lofty porch, which  affords a fine specimen of village architecture of the fifteenth  century. Within, there is a fine black oak ceiling of massive moulded  beams, a good example of the lavish way in which oak was used in these  old buildings.    Hadleigh is rich in seventeenth-century houses with ornamental plaster  fronts and carved oak beams and corbels. One with wide projecting eaves  and many windows bears the date 1676, formed out of the lead setting of  the little panes of glass. Some bear fantastical designs upon the  pargeting, half obliterated by continual coats of white or yellow wash,  with varying dates from James I. to Dutch William.    A lofty battlemented tower in the churchyard, belonging to the rectory,  was built towards the end of the fifteenth century by Archdeacon  Pykenham. Some mural paintings in one of its rooms depict the adjacent  hills and river and the interior of the church, and a turret-chamber has  a kind of hiding-place or strong-room, with a stout door for defence.  Not far from this rectory gatehouse is a half-timber building almost  contemporary, with narrow Gothic doors, made up-to-date with an artistic  shade of green. The exterior of the church is fine, but the interior is  disappointing in many ways. It was restored at that period of the  Victorian era when art in the way of church improvement had reached its  lowest ebb. But the church had suffered previously, for a puritanical  person named Dowsing smashed the majority of the painted windows as  \"superstitious pictures.\" Fortunately some fine linen panelling in the  vestry has been preserved. The old Court Farm, about half a mile to the  north of the town, has also suffered considerably; for but little  remains beyond the entrance gate of Tudor date. By local report,  Cromwell is here responsible; but the place was a monastery once, and  Thomas Cromwell dismantled it. It would be interesting to know if the  Lord Protector ever wrote to the editor of the _Weekly Post_, to refute  any connection with his namesake of the previous century. Though the  \"White Lion\" Inn has nothing architecturally attractive, there is an  old-fashioned comfort about it. The courtyard is festooned round with  clematis of over a century's growth, and in the summer you step out of  your sleeping quarters into a delightful green arcade. The ostler, too,  is a typical one of the good old coaching days, and doubtless has a  healthy distaste for locomotion by the means of petrol.    The corner of the county to the south-east of Hadleigh, and bounded by  the rivers Stour and Orwell, could have no better recommendation for  picturesqueness than the works of the famous painter Constable. He was  never happier than at work near his native village, Flatford, where  to-day the old mill affords a delightful rural studio to some painters  of repute. The old timber bridge and the willow-bordered Stour, winding  in and out the valley, afford charming subjects for the brush; and  Dedham on the Essex border is delightful. Gainsborough also was very  partial to the scenery on the banks of the Orwell.    In the churchyard of East Bergholt, near Flatford, is a curious,  deep-roofed wooden structure, a cage containing the bells, which are  hung upside down. Local report says that his Satanic Majesty had the  same objection to the completion of the sacred edifices that he had for  Cologne Cathedral, consequently the tower still remains conspicuous by  its absence. The \"Hare and Hounds\" Inn has a finely moulded plaster  ceiling. It is worthy of note that the Folkards, an old Suffolk family,  have owned the inn for upwards of six generations.    Little and Great Wenham both possess interesting manor-houses: the  former particularly so, as it is one of the earliest specimens of  domestic architecture in the kingdom, or at least the first house where  Flemish bricks were used in construction. For this reason, no doubt,  trippers from Ipswich are desirous of leaving the measurements of their  boots deep-cut into the leads of the roof with their initials duly  recorded. Naturally the owner desires that some discrimination be now  shown as to whom may be admitted. The building is compact, with but few  rooms; but the hall on the first floor and the chapel are in a  wonderfully good state of repair,--indeed the house would make a much  more desirable residence than many twentieth-century dwellings of equal  dimensions. Great Wenham manor-house is of Tudor date, with pretty  little pinnacles at the corners of gable ends which peep over a high  red-brick wall skirting the highroad.    From here to Erwarton, which is miles from anywhere near the tongue of  land dividing the two rivers, some charming pastoral scenery recalls  peeps we have of it from the brush of Constable. At one particularly  pretty spot near Harkstead some holiday folks had assembled to enjoy  themselves, and looked sadly bored at a company of Salvationists who had  come to destroy the peace of the scene.    [Illustration: ERWARTON HALL.]    Erwarton Hall is a ghostly looking old place, with an odd-shaped  early-Jacobean gateway, with nine great pinnacles rising above its roof.  It faces a wide and desolate stretch of road, with ancient trees and  curious twisted roots, in front, and a pond: picturesque but melancholy  looking. The house is Elizabethan, of dark red-brick, and the old  mullioned windows peer over the boundary-wall as if they would like to  see something of the world, even in this remote spot. In the mansion,  which this succeeded, lived Anne Boleyn's aunt, Amata, Lady Calthorpe,  and here the unfortunate queen is said to have spent some of the  happiest days of girlhood,--a peaceful spot, indeed, compared with her  subsequent surroundings. Local tradition long back has handed down the  story that it was the queen's wish her heart should be buried at  Erwarton; and it had well-nigh been forgotten, when some sixty-five  years ago a little casket was discovered during some alterations to one  of the walls of the church. It was heart-shaped, and contained but dust,  and was eventually placed in a vault of the Cornwallis family. Sir W.  Hastings D'Oyly, Bart., in writing an interesting article upon this  subject a few years back,[10] pointed out that it has never been  decided where Anne Boleyn's remains actually are interred, though they  were buried, of course, in the first instance by her brother, Viscount  Rochford, in the Tower. There are erroneous traditions, both at Salle in  Norfolk and Horndon-on-the-Hill in Essex, that Anne Boleyn was buried  there. There are some fine old monuments in the Erwarton church, a  cross-legged crusader, and a noseless knight and lady, with elaborate  canopy, members of the Davilliers family. During the Civil War five of  the bells were removed from the tower and broken up for shot for the  defence of the old Hall against the Parliamentarians. At least so goes  the story. An octagonal Tudor font is in a good state of preservation,  and a few old rusty helmets would look better hung up on the walls than  placed upon the capital of a column.    The story of Anne Boleyn's heart recalls that of Sir Nicholas Crispe,  whose remains were recently reinterred when the old London church of St.  Mildred's in Bread Street was pulled down. The heart of the cavalier,  who gave large sums of money to Charles I. in his difficulties, is  buried in Hammersmith Old Church, and by the instructions of his will  the vessel which held it was to be opened every year and a glass of wine  poured upon it.    Some curious vicissitudes are said to have happened to the heart of the  great Montrose. It came into the possession of Lady Napier, his nephew's  wife, who had it embalmed and enclosed in a steel case of the size of an  egg, which opened with a spring, made from the blade of his sword, and  the relic was given by her to the then Marchioness of Montrose. Soon  afterwards it was lost, but eventually traced to a collection of curios  in Holland, and returned into the possession of the fifth Lord Napier,  who gave it to his daughter. When she married she went to reside in  Madeira, where the little casket was stolen by a native, under the  belief that it "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/398"],[0,"The First Book of Adam and Eve (#6)"],[1,"is neither sorrow nor suffering; but abiding joy and gladness,  and light that never fails, and praises that never cease; and a  beautiful garden that shall never pass away.\"    16 And God said again to Adam, \"Be patient and enter the cave, for the  darkness, of which you were afraid, shall only be twelve hours long;  and when ended, light shall come up.\"    17 Then when Adam heard these words from God, he and Eve worshipped  before Him, and their hearts were comforted.  They returned into the  cave after their custom, while tears flowed from their eyes, sorrow and  wailing came from their hearts, and they wished their soul would leave  their body.    18 And Adam and Eve stood praying until the darkness of night came over  them, and Adam was hid from Eve, and she from him.    19 And they remained standing in prayer.          Chapter XXVII - The second tempting of Adam and Eve.  The devil takes  on the form of a beguiling light.    1 When Satan, the hater of all good, saw how they continued in prayer,  and how God communed with them, and comforted them, and how He had  accepted their offering--Satan made an apparition.    2 He began with transforming his hosts; in his hands was a flashing  fire, and they were in a great light.    3 He then placed his throne near the mouth of the cave because he could  not enter into it by reason of their prayers.  And he shed light into  the cave, until the cave glistened over Adam and Eve; while his hosts  began to sing praises.    4 And Satan did this, in order that when Adam saw the light, he should  think within himself that it was a heavenly light, and that Satan's  hosts were angels; and that God had sent them to watch at the cave, and  to give him light in the darkness.    5 So that when Adam came out of the cave and saw them, and Adam and Eve  bowed to Satan, then he would overcome Adam thereby, and a second time  humble him before God.    6 When, therefore, Adam and Eve saw the light, fancying it was real,  they strengthened their hearts; yet, as they were trembling, Adam said  to Eve:--    7 \"Look at that great light, and at those many songs of praise, and at  that host standing outside who won't come into our cave.  Why don't  they tell us what they want, where they are from, what the meaning of  this light is, what those praises are, why they have been sent to this  place, and why they won't come in?    8 If they were from God, they would come into the cave with us, and  would tell us why they were sent.\"    9 Then Adam stood up and prayed to God with a burning heart, and said:--    10 \"O Lord, is there in the world another god besides You, who created  angels and filled them with light, and sent them to keep us, who would  come with them?    11 But, look, we see these hosts that stand at the mouth of the cave;  they are in a great light; they sing loud praises.  If they are of some  other god than You, tell me; and if they are sent by you, inform me of  the reason for which You have sent them.\"    12 No sooner had Adam said this, than an angel from God appeared to him  in the cave, who said to him, \"O Adam, fear not.  This is Satan and his  hosts; he wishes to deceive you as he deceived you at first.  For the  first time, he was hidden in the serpent; but this time he is come to  you in the likeness of an angel of light; in order that, when you  worshipped him, he might enslave you, in the very presence of God.\"    13 Then the angel went from Adam and seized Satan at the opening of the  cave, and stripped him of the pretense he had assumed, and brought him  in his own hideous form to Adam and Eve; who were afraid of him when  they saw him.    14 And the angel said to Adam, \"This hideous form has been his ever  since God made him fall from heaven.  He could not have come near you  in it; he therefore transformed himself into an angel of light.\"    15 Then the angel drove away Satan and his hosts from Adam and Eve, and  said to them, \"Fear not; God who created you, will strengthen you.\"    16 And the angel left them.    17 But Adam and Eve remained standing in the cave; no consolation came  to them; they divided in their thoughts.    18 And when it was morning they prayed; and then went out to seek the  garden.  For their hearts were towards it, and they could get no  consolation for having left it.          Chapter XXVIII - The Devil pretends to lead Adam and Eve to the water  to bathe.    1 But when the crafty Satan saw them, that they were going to the  garden, he gathered together his host, and came in appearance on a  cloud, intent on deceiving them.    2 But when Adam and Eve saw him thus in a vision, they thought they  were angels of God come to comfort them about having left the garden,  or to bring them back again into it.    3 And Adam spread his hands before God, beseeching Him to make him  understand what they were.    4 Then Satan, the hater of all good, said to Adam, \"O Adam, I am an  angel of the great God; and, behold the hosts that surround me.    5 God has sent us to take you and bring you to the border of the garden  northwards; to the shore of the clear sea, and bathe you and Eve in it,  and raise you to your former gladness, that you return again to the  garden.\"    6 These words sank into the heart of Adam and Eve.    7 Yet God withheld His Word from Adam, and did not make him understand  at once, but waited to see his strength; whether he would be overcome  as Eve was when in the garden, or whether he would prevail.    8 Then Satan called to Adam and Eve, and said, \"Behold, we go to the  sea of water,\" and they began to go.    9 And Adam and Eve followed them at some little distance.    10 But when they came to the mountain to the north of the garden, a  very high mountain, without any steps to the top of it, the Devil drew  near to Adam and Eve, and made them go up to the top in reality, and  not in a vision; wishing, as he did, to throw them down and kill them,  and to wipe off their name from the earth; so that this earth should  remain to him and his hosts alone.          Chapter XXIX - God tells Adam of the Devil's purpose. (v. 4).    1 But when the merciful God saw that Satan wished to kill Adam with his  many tricks, and saw that Adam was meek and without guile, God spoke to  Satan in a loud voice, and cursed him.    2 Then he and his hosts fled, and Adam and Eve remained standing on the  top of the mountain, from there they saw below them the wide world,  high above which they were.  But they saw none of the host which time  after time were by them.    3 They cried, both Adam and Eve, before God, and begged for forgiveness  of Him.    4 Then came the Word from God to Adam, and said to him, \"Know you and  understand concerning this Satan, that he seeks to deceive you and your  descendants after you.\"    5 And Adam cried before the Lord God, and begged and prayed to Him to  give him something from the garden, as a token to him, wherein to be  comforted.    6 And God considered Adam's thought, and sent the angel Michael as far  as the sea that reaches India, to take from there golden rods and bring  them to Adam.    7 This did God in His wisdom in order that these golden rods, being  with Adam in the cave, should shine forth with light in the night  around him, and put an end to his fear of the darkness.    8 Then the angel Michael went down by God's order, took golden rods, as  God had commanded him, and brought them to God.          Chapter XXX - Adam receives the first worldly goods.    1 After these things, God commanded the angel Gabriel to go down to the  garden, and say to the cherub who kept it, \"Behold, God has commanded  me to come into the garden, and to take from it sweet smelling incense,  and give it to Adam.\"    2 Then the angel Gabriel went down by God's order to the garden, and  told the cherub as God had commanded him.    3 The cherub then said, \"Well.\"  And Gabriel went in and took the  incense.    4 Then God commanded his angel Raphael to go down to the garden, and  speak to the cherub about some myrrh, to give to Adam.    5 And the angel Raphael went down and told the cherub as God had  commanded him, and the cherub said, \"Well.\" Then Raphael went in and  took the myrrh.    6 The golden rods were from the Indian sea, where there are precious  stones.  The incense was from the eastern border of the garden; and the  myrrh from the western border, from where bitterness came over Adam.    7 And the angels brought these things to God, by the Tree of Life, in  the garden.    8 Then God said to the angels, \"Dip them in the spring of water; then  take them and sprinkle their water over Adam and Eve, that they be a  little comforted in their sorrow, and give them to Adam and Eve.    9 And the angels did as God had commanded them, and they gave all those  things to Adam and Eve on the top of the mountain on which Satan had  placed them, when he sought to make an end of them.    10 And when Adam saw the golden rods, the incense and the myrrh, he was  rejoiced and cried because he thought that the gold was a token of the  kingdom from where he had come, that the incense was a token of the  bright light which had been taken from him, and that the myrrh was a  token of the sorrow in which he was.          Chapter XXXI - They make themselves more comfortable in the Cave of  Treasures on the third day.    1 After these things God said to Adam, \"You asked Me for something from  the garden, to be comforted therewith, and I have given you these three  tokens as a consolation to you; that you trust in Me and in My covenant  with you.    2 For I will come and save you; and kings shall bring me when in the  flesh, gold, incense and myrrh; gold as a token of My kingdom; incense  as a token of My divinity; and myrrh as a token of My suffering and of  My death.    3 But, O Adam, put these by you in the cave; the gold that it may shed  light over you by night; the incense, that you smell its sweet savor;  and the myrrh, to comfort you in"]]]
