She  married Glaucus, a rich Phocaean merchant of noble family, who had  defended his native town with great bravery against the Persians, and  with him departed to the newly-founded Massalia, on the Celtic coast.  There, however, the young couple both fell victims to the climate, and  died, leaving a little daughter, Sappho. Rhodopis at once undertook the  long journey westward, brought the orphan child back to live with her,  spent the utmost care on her education, and now that she is grown up,  forbids her the society of men, still feeling the stains of her own  youth so keenly that she would fain keep her granddaughter (and this in  Sappho's case is not difficult), at a greater distance from contact  with our sex than is rendered necessary, by the customs of Egypt. To my  friend herself society is as indispensable as water to the fish or air  to the bird. Her house is frequented by all the strangers here, and  whoever has once experienced her hospitality and has the time at command  will never after be found absent when the flag announces an evening of  reception. Every Greek of mark is to be found here, as it is in this  house that we consult on the wisest measures for encountering the hatred  of the priests and bringing the king round to our own views. Here you  can obtain not only the latest news from home, but from the rest of the  world, and this house is an inviolable sanctuary for the persecuted,  Rhodopis possessing a royal warrant which secures her from every  molestation on the part of the police.       [A very active and strict police-force existed in Egypt, the     organization of which is said to have owed much to Amasis' care. We     also read in inscriptions and papyrus rolls, that a body of mounted     police existed, the ranks of which were generally filled by     foreigners in preference to natives.]    Our own songs and our own language are to be heard here, and here we  take counsel on the best means for delivering Greece from the ever fresh  encroachments of her tyrants.    In a word, this house is the centre of attraction for all Hellenic  interests in Egypt, and of more importance to us politically, than our  temple, the Hellenion itself, and our hall of commerce.    In a few minutes you will see this remarkable grandmother, and, if we  should be here alone, perhaps the grandchild too; you will then at once  perceive that they owe everything to their own rare qualities and not to  the chances of good fortune. Ah! there they come! they are going towards  the house. Cannot you hear the slave-girls singing? Now they are going  in. First let them quietly be seated, then follow me, and when the  evening is over you shall say whether you repent of having come  hither, and whether Rhodopis resembles more nearly a queen or a freed  bond-woman.\"    The houses was built in the Grecian style. It was a rather long,  one-storied building, the outside of which would be called extremely  plain in the present day; within, it united the Egyptian brilliancy of  coloring with the Greek beauty of form. The principal door opened  into the entrance-hall. To the left of this lay a large dining-room,  overlooking the Nile, and, opposite to this last was the kitchen, an  apartment only to be found in the houses of the wealthier Greeks, the  poorer families being accustomed to prepare their food at the hearth in  the front apartment. The hall of reception lay at the other end of the  entrance-hall, and was in the form of a square, surrounded within by a  colonnade, into which various chambers opened. This was the apartment  devoted to the men, in the centre of which was the household fire,  burning on an altar-shaped hearth of rich AEginetan metal-work.    It was lighted by an opening in the roof, which formed at the same time,  an outlet for the smoke. From this room (at the opposite end to that  on which it opened into the entrance-hall), a passage, closed by a  well-fastened door, led into the chamber of the women. This was also  surrounded by a colonnade within, but only on three sides, and here  the female inhabitants were accustomed to pass their time, when not  employed, spinning or weaving, in the rooms lying near the back or  garden-door as it was termed. Between these latter and the domestic  offices, which lay on the right and left of the women's apartment, were  the sleeping-rooms; these served also as places of security for the  valuables of the house. The walls of the men's apartment were painted of  a reddish-brown color, against which the outlines of some white marble  carvings, the gift of a Chian sculptor, stood out in sharp relief.  The floor was covered with rich carpets from Sardis; low cushions of  panthers' skins lay ranged along the colonnade; around the  artistically wrought hearth stood quaint Egyptian settees, and small,  delicately-carved tables of Thya wood, on which lay all kinds of musical  instruments, the flute, cithara and lyre. Numerous lamps of various  and singular shapes, filled with Kiki oil, hung against the walls. Some  represented fire-spouting dolphins; others, strange winged monsters from  whose jaws the flames issued; and these, blending their light with that  from the hearth, illumined the apartment.    In this room a group of men were assembled, whose appearance and dress  differed one from the other. A Syrian from Tyre, in a long crimson robe,  was talking animatedly to a man whose decided features and crisp, curly,  black hair proclaimed him an Israelite. The latter had come to Egypt  to buy chariots and horses for Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah--the  Egyptian equipages being the most sought after at that time. Close to  him stood three Greeks from Asia Minor, the rich folds of whose  garments (for they wore the costly dress of their native city Miletus),  contrasted strongly with the plain and unadorned robe of Phryxus, the  deputy commissioned to collect money for the temple of Apollo at Delphi,  with whom they were in earnest conversation. Ten years before, the  ancient temple had been consumed by fire; and at this time efforts were  being made to build another, and a more beautiful one.    Two of the Milesians, disciples of Anaximander and Anaximenes, were  staying then in Egypt, to study astronomy and the peculiar wisdom of  the Egyptians at Heliopolis, and the third was a wealthy merchant and  ship-owner, named Theopompus, who had settled at Naukratis.       [Anaximander of Miletus, born 611-546, was a celebrated     geometrician, astronomer, philosopher and geographer. He was the     author of a book on natural phenomena, drew the first map of the     world on metal, and introduced into Greece a kind of clock which he     seems to have borrowed from the Babylonians. He supposes a primary     and not easily definable Being, by which the whole world is     governed, and in which, though in himself infinite and without     limits, everything material and circumscribed has its foundation.     \"Chaotic matter\" represents in his theory the germ of all created     things, from which water, earth, animals, nereids or fish-men, human     beings &c. have had their origin.]    Rhodopis herself was engaged in a lively conversation with two Samian  Greeks: the celebrated worker in metals, sculptor and goldsmith  Theodorus, and the Iambic poet Ibykus of Rhegium, who had left the court  of Polykrates for a time in order to become acquainted with Egypt, and  were bearers of presents to Amasis from their ruler. Close to the fire  lay Philoinus of Sybaris, a corpulent man with strongly-marked features  and a sensual expression of face; he was stretched at full-length on a  couch covered with spotted furs, and amused himself by playing with his  scented curls wreathed with gold, and with the golden chains which fell  from his neck on to the long saffron-colored robe that clothed him down  to his feet.       [Sybaris was a town in Lower Italy notorious throughout the ancient     world for its luxury. According to Strabo it was founded by     Achaeans 262. About 510 it was conquered and destroyed by the     Crotoniates and then rebuilt under the name of Thurii.]    Rhodopis had a kind word for each of her guests, but at present she  occupied herself exclusively with the two celebrated Sarnians; their  talk was of art and poetry. The fire of youth still glowed in the eyes  of the Thracian woman, her tall figure was still full and unbent;  her hair, though grey, was wound round her beautifully formed head in  luxuriant waves, and laid together at the back in a golden net, and a  sparkling diadem shone above her lofty forehead.    Her noble Greek features were pale, but still beautiful and without a  wrinkle, notwithstanding her great age; indeed her small mouth with its  full lips, her white teeth, her eyes so bright and yet so soft, and her  nobly-formed nose and forehead would have been beauty enough for a young  maiden.    Rhodopis looked younger than she really was, though she made no attempt  to disavow her age. Matronly dignity was visible in every movement, and  the charm of her manner lay, not in a youthful endeavor to be pleasing,  but in the effort of age to please others, considering their wishes, and  at the same time demanding consideration in return.    Our two friends now presenting themselves in the hall, every eye turned  upon them, and as Phanes entered leading his friend by the hand, the  heartiest welcome met him from all sides; one of the Milesians indeed  exclaimed: \"Now I see what it is that was wanting to our assembly. There  can be no merriment without Phanes.\"    And Philoinus, the Sybarite, raising his deep voice, but not allowing  himself for a moment to be disturbed in his repose, remarked: \"Mirth  is a good thing, and if you bring that with you, be welcome to me also,  Athenian.\"    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/548"],[0,"Project Trinity, 1945-1946 (#6)"],[1,"(1; 10).    Since it was expected that any dust from the cloud would fall on one  of the shelter areas within 30 minutes of the shot, plans had been  made to evacuate personnel as soon as the monitors completed their  initial survey.  Because the cloud moved to the northeast, the south  shelter (the Control Point) was not completely evacuated, although  nonessential personnel were sent to the Base Camp.  The west shelter  was emptied of all personnel except a searchlight crew spotlighting  the cloud as it moved away (1; 10).    Only at the north shelter did an emergency evacuation occur.  About 12  minutes after the shot, a detection instrument indicated a rapid rise  in the radiation levels within the shelter.  At the same time, a  remote ionization monitoring device detected a rapid increase in  radiation.  Because of these two readings, all north shelter personnel  were immediately evacuated to the Base Camp, 25 kilometers to the  south.  Film badges worn by personnel stationed at the north shelter,  however, showed no radiation exposure above the detectable level.  It  was later discovered that the meter of the detector in the north  shelter had not retained its zero calibration setting, and radiation  at the north shelter had not reached levels high enough to result in  measurable exposures of the personnel who had been positioned there.  However, fallout activity was later detected in the north shelter  area, proof that part of the cloud did head in that direction.  This  also explains why the monitoring device detected rising radiation  levels (1; 12).    After ascertaining that radiation levels along the roads leading from  the shelters to Broadway were within acceptable limits, the  radiological safety monitors and military police established  roadblocks at important intersections leading to ground zero.  The  north shelter monitor and military police set up a post where the  North Shelter Road ran into Broadway.  The west shelter monitor and a  military policeman blocked Vatican Road where it intersected Broadway.  The south shelter monitor and military police set up a roadblock where  Broadway intersected Pennsylvania Avenue (1).    The monitor assigned to Guard Post 4 surveyed the Mockingbird Gap area  to ensure that it was safe for the guards to return to their post.  This position controlled access to the McDonald Ranch Road, which led  directly to ground zero (1).    At 0540 hours, the chief monitor departed from the Base Camp with a  military policeman to monitor the entire length of Broadway.  They  first checked the roadblock at Pennsylvania Avenue and Broadway.  Next  they drove to the roadblock at Vatican Road and Broadway.  Upon the  chief monitor's arrival, the west shelter monitor traveled about nine  kilometers west on Vatican Road to monitor Guard Post 1 so that the  military police could reoccupy the post.  The monitoring excursion to  Guard Post 1 continued until the chief monitor had returned from Guard  Post 2, located 17 kilometers northwest of the Vatican Road roadblock  on Broadway (1; 18).    The chief monitor arrived at Guard Post 2 at about 0550 hours and  found the post empty.  He then continued five kilometers north along  Broadway to the foxholes from which the military police had watched  the detonation.  There he found the guards, the five radiological  safety monitors assigned to the evacuation detachment, and the  Commanding Officer of the evacuation detachment (1; 18).    The military policemen refused to return to Guard Post 2, insisting  that they had received orders over their two-way radio from the Base  Commander to evacuate their post and head for San Antonio, New Mexico,  a town 28 kilometers northwest of the Guard Post.  The Base Commander  had noted that portions of the cloud were heading northwestward and,  fearing that fallout from the cloud would contaminate Guard Post 2,  had ordered the military police to evacuate.  The chief monitor,  however, had found no significant radiation levels anywhere along the  northern part of Broadway nor around Guard Post 2. The Base Commander,  after being contacted by the chief monitor, drove to the foxholes and  ordered the guards to return to their post.  This was the only  unplanned incident during the onsite monitoring (1).    After Guard Post 2 was reoccupied, the chief monitor returned to the  roadblock at the intersection of Broadway and the North Shelter Road.  The north shelter monitor informed the chief monitor of the sudden  evacuation of the north shelter, whereupon the chief monitor surveyed  the north shelter area and found intensities of only 0.01 and 0.02  roentgens per hour (R/h).  The chief monitor then contacted the south  shelter and informed Dr. Bainbridge that the north shelter region was  safe for those who needed to return, that Broadway was safe from the  Base Camp to Guard Post 2, and that Guard Post 2 was now manned so  that personnel leaving for LASL could be checked out (1).    The chief monitor then returned to the south shelter and assembled the  monitors from the three roadblocks and Guard Post 4 to prepare for  entrance into the ground zero area.  The time was about 0815 hours.  The military police at the roadblocks were given radiation meters to  survey the adjoining area.  Broadway from the south shelter to Guard  Post 2 was remonitored occasionally to reassure the military police  that there was no radiation problem.  Monitors also surveyed the Base  Camp for 24 hours after the detonation.  No radiation above background  levels was detected there (1).    The following brief description of the radiological environment in the  TRINITY test area is based primarily on the results of the remote  gamma recorders situated in the test area and on results of the road  surveys conducted after the detonation (1).    Within about 1,400 meters of ground zero (except to the north),  radiation intensities between 0.2 and 1.3 R/h were detected during the  first few minutes after the detonation.  These readings decreased to  less than 0.1 R/h within a few hours.  At greater distances to the  east, south, and west, radiation levels above background were not  detected (1).    The cloud drifted to the northeast, and higher gamma readings due to  fallout were encountered in this direction.  About five minutes after  the detonation, a reading of 3 R/h was recorded 1,400 meters north of  ground zero.  Several minutes later, the intensity there had increased  to greater than 7 R/h, and it continued to increase for several more  minutes.  Gamma detectors 9,150 meters north of ground zero, however,  recorded no radiation above background levels.  This indicated that  the cloud had passed over or near the 1,400-meter area and only  partially over the 9,150-meter area where the north shelter was  located.  Subsequent ground surveys of this area found no gamma  intensities higher than 0.02 R/h (1).    Gamma radiation levels at and around ground zero were much higher than  in other onsite areas because of induced activity in the soil.  Twenty-four hours after the detonation, the gamma intensity at ground  zero was estimated to be 600 to 700 R/h.  This estimate was based on  data provided by the tank crew that drove to ground zero to obtain  soil samples.  The intensity decreased to about 2 R/h at 725 meters  from ground zero.  Gamma intensities of 0.1 R/h or more were confined  within a circular area extending about 1,100 meters from ground zero  (except in areas of fallout).  One week after the shot, the gamma  intensity at ground zero was about 45 R/h.  After 30 days, intensities  at ground zero had decreased to 15 R/h, and intensities of 0.1 R/h or  more were not encountered beyond about 365 meters from ground zero.  Gamma intensities of 3 to 10 R/h were found at ground zero three  months after the detonation (1; 19).      3.3 OFFSITE MONITORING GROUP    Four two-man teams and one five-man team supervised by the chief  offsite monitor constituted the Offsite Monitoring Group.  Before the  detonation, the four two-man teams established monitoring posts in  towns outside the test area.  These towns were Nogal, Roswell, Fort  Sumner, and Socorro, all in New Mexico.  The five-man team remained at  Guard Post 2 to assist in evacuation of nearby residences if the  TRINITY cloud drifted in that direction.  These residences, the Fite  house and the homes in the town of Tokay, were 24 and 32 kilometers  northwest of ground zero, respectively.  Since the cloud drifted to  the northeast, evacuation was not required.  All offsite monitoring  teams were in radio or telephone contact with personnel at the Base  Camp (11).    Offsite monitoring teams in areas northeast of ground zero encountered  gamma readings ranging from 1.5 to 15 R/h two to four hours after the  detonation.  Three hours after the detonation, surveys taken in  Bingham, New Mexico (located 30 kilometers northeast of ground zero)  found gamma intensities of about 1.5 R/h.  Radiation readings at the  town of White, nine kilometers southeast of Bingham, were 6.5 R/h  three hours after the detonation and 2.5 R/h two hours later.  Another  team monitoring in a canyon 11 kilometers east of Bingham found a  gamma intensity of about 15 R/h.  Five hours later, the intensity had  decreased to 3.8 R/h.  It was estimated that peak intensities of gamma  radiation from fallout on shot-day were about 7 R/h at an occupied  ranch house in this canyon area (1; 11; 19).    Monitoring teams resurveyed these towns about one month after the  TRINITY detonation.  At Bingham, gamma readings of 0.003 R/h and  0.0001 R/h were found at ground level outdoors and at waist level  inside a building, respectively.  At the town of White, the highest  outdoor gamma reading was 0.008 R/h.  Inside a building, the highest  reading was 0.0005 R/h (11).    Surveys taken in the canyon area one month after the detonation  indicated that gamma intensities at ground level had decreased to  0."]]]
