[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4748"],[0,"Baree, Son of Kazan (#6)"],[1," the day before.    That afternoon Baree took a long nap close to his cache. Then he  uncovered the partridge and ate his supper. When his fourth night alone  came, he did not hide himself as he had done on the three preceding  nights. He was strangely and curiously alert. Under the moon and the  stars he prowled in the edge of the forest and out on the burn. He  listened with a new kind of thrill to the faraway cry of a wolf pack on  the hunt. He listened to the ghostly whoo-whoo-whoo of the owls without  shivering. Sounds and silences were beginning to hold a new and  significant note for him.    For another day and night Baree remained in the vicinity of his cache.  When the last bone was picked, he moved on. He now entered a country  where subsistence was no longer a perilous problem for him. It was a  lynx country, and where there are lynx, there are also a great many  rabbits. When the rabbits thin out, the lynx emigrate to better hunting  grounds. As the snowshoe rabbit breeds all the summer through, Baree  found himself in a land of plenty. It was not difficult for him to  catch and kill the young rabbits. For a week he prospered and grew  bigger and stronger each day. But all the time, stirred by that  seeking, wanderlust spirit--still hoping to find the old home and his  mother--he traveled into the north and east.    And this was straight into the trapping country of Pierrot, the  half-breed.    Pierrot, until two years ago, had believed himself to be one of the  most fortunate men in the big wilderness. That was before La Mort  Rouge--the Red Death--came. He was half French, and he had married a  Cree chief's daughter, and in their log cabin on the Gray Loon they had  lived for many years in great prosperity and happiness. Pierrot was  proud of three things in this wild world of his. He was immensely proud  of Wyola, his royal-blooded wife. He was proud of his daughter; and he  was proud of his reputation as a hunter. Until the Red Death came, life  was quite complete for him. It was then--two years ago--that the  smallpox killed his princess wife. He still lived in the little cabin  on the Gray Loon, but he was a different Pierrot. The heart was sick in  him. It would have died, had it not been for Nepeese, his daughter. His  wife had named her Nepeese, which means the Willow.    Nepeese had grown up like the willow, slender as a reed, with all her  mother's wild beauty, and with a little of the French thrown in. She  was sixteen, with great, dark, wonderful eyes, and hair so beautiful  that an agent from Montreal passing that way had once tried to buy it.  It fell in two shining braids, each as big as a man's wrist, almost to  her knees. \"Non, M'sieu,\" Pierrot had said, a cold glitter in his eyes  as he saw what was in the agent's face. \"It is not for barter.\"    Two days after Baree had entered his trapping ground, Pierrot came in  from the forests with a troubled look in his face.    \"Something is killing off the young beavers,\" he explained to Nepeese,  speaking to her in French. \"It is a lynx or a wolf. Tomorrow--\" He  shrugged his thin shoulders, and smiled at her.    \"We will go on the hunt,\" laughed Nepeese happily, in her soft Cree.    When Pierrot smiled at her like that, and began with \"Tomorrow,\" it  always meant that she might go with him on the adventure he was  contemplating.      Still another day later, at the end of the afternoon, Baree crossed the  Gray Loon on a bridge of driftwood that had wedged between two trees.  This was to the north. Just beyond the driftwood bridge there was a  small clearing, and on the edge of it Baree paused to enjoy the last of  the setting sun. As he stood motionless and listening, his tail  drooping low, his ears alert, his sharp-pointed nose sniffing the new  country to the north, there was not a pair of eyes in the forest that  would not have taken him for a young wolf.    From behind a clump of young balsams, a hundred yards away, Pierrot and  Nepeese had watched him come over the driftwood bridge. Now was the  time, and Pierrot leveled his rifle. It was not until then that Nepeese  touched his arm softly. Her breath came a little excitedly as she  whispered:    \"Nootawe, let me shoot. I can kill him!\"    With a low chuckle Pierrot gave the gun to her. He counted the whelp as  already dead. For Nepeese, at that distance, could send a bullet into  an inch square nine times out of ten. And Nepeese, aiming carefully at  Baree, pressed steadily with her brown forefinger upon the trigger.        CHAPTER 5    As the Willow pulled the trigger of her rifle, Baree sprang into the  air. He felt the force of the bullet before he heard the report of the  gun. It lifted him off his feet, and then sent him rolling over and  over as if he had been struck a hideous blow with a club. For a flash  he did not feel pain. Then it ran through him like a knife of fire, and  with that pain the dog in him rose above the wolf, and he let out a  wild outcry of puppyish yapping as he rolled and twisted on the ground.    Pierrot and Nepeese had stepped from behind the balsams, the Willow's  beautiful eyes shining with pride at the accuracy of her shot.  Instantly she caught her breath. Her brown fingers clutched at the  barrel of her rifle. The chuckle of satisfaction died on Pierrot's lips  as Baree's cries of pain filled the forest.    \"Uchi moosis!\" gasped Nepeese, in her Cree.    Pierrot caught the rifle from her.    \"Diable! A dog--a puppy!\" he cried.    He started on a run for Baree. But in their amazement they had lost a  few seconds and Baree's dazed senses were returning. He saw them  clearly as they came across the open--a new kind of monster of the  forests! With a final wail he darted back into the deep shadows of the  trees. It was almost sunset, and he ran for the thick gloom of the  heavy spruce near the creek. He had shivered at sight of the bear and  the moose, but for the first time he now sensed the real meaning of  danger. And it was close after him. He could hear the crashing of the  two-legged beasts in pursuit; strange cries were almost at his  heels--and then suddenly he plunged without warning into a hole.    It was a shock to have the earth go out from under his feet like that,  but Baree did not yelp. The wolf was dominant in him again. It urged  him to remain where he was, making no move, no sound--scarcely  breathing. The voices were over him; the strange feet almost stumbled  in the hole where he lay. Looking out of his dark hiding place, he  could see one of his enemies. It was Nepeese, the Willow. She was  standing so that a last glow of the day fell upon her face. Baree did  not take his eyes from her.    Above his pain there rose in him a strange and thrilling fascination.  The girl put her two hands to her mouth and in a voice that was soft  and plaintive and amazingly comforting to his terrified little heart,  cried:    \"Uchimoo--Uchimoo--Uchimoo!\"    And then he heard another voice; and this voice, too, was far less  terrible than many sounds he had listened to in the forests.    \"We cannot find him, Nepeese,\" the voice was saying. \"He has crawled  off to die. It is too bad. Come.\"    Where Baree had stood in the edge of the open Pierrot paused and  pointed to a birch sapling that had been cut clean off by the Willow's  bullet. Nepeese understood. The sapling, no larger than her thumb, had  turned her shot a trifle and had saved Baree from instant death. She  turned again, and called:    \"Uchimoo--Uchimoo--Uchimoo!\"    Her eyes were no longer filled with the thrill of slaughter.    \"He would not understand that,\" said Pierrot, leading the way across  the open. \"He is wild--born of the wolves. Perhaps he was of Koomo's  lead bitch, who ran away to hunt with the packs last winter.\"    \"And he will die--\"    \"Ayetun--yes, he will die.\"    But Baree had no idea of dying. He was too tough a youngster to be  shocked to death by a bullet passing through the soft flesh of his  foreleg. That was what had happened. His leg was torn to the bone, but  the bone itself was untouched. He waited until the moon had risen  before he crawled out of his hole.    His leg had grown stiff, but it had stopped bleeding, though his whole  body was racked by a terrible pain. A dozen Papayuchisews, all holding  right to his ears and nose, could not have hurt him more. Every time he  moved, a sharp twinge shot through him; and yet he persisted in moving.  Instinctively he felt that by traveling away from the hole he would get  away from danger. This was the best thing that could have happened to  him, for a little later a porcupine came wandering along, chattering to  itself in its foolish, good-humored way, and fell with a fat thud into  the hole. Had Baree remained, he would have been so full of quills that  he must surely have died.    In another way the exercise of travel was good for Baree. It gave his  wound no opportunity to \"set,\" as Pierrot would have said, for in  reality his hurt was more painful than serious. For the first hundred  yards he hobbled along on three legs, and after that he found that he  could use his fourth by humoring it a great deal. He followed the creek  for a half mile. Whenever a bit of brush touched his wound, he would  snap at it viciously, and instead of whimpering when he felt one of the  sharp twinges shooting through him, an angry little growl gathered in  his throat, and his teeth clicked. Now that he was out of the hole, the  effect of the Willow's shot was stirring every drop of wolf blood in  his body. In him there was a growing animosity--a feeling of rage not  against any one thing in particular, but against all things. It was not  the feeling with which he had fought Papayuchisew, the young owl. On  this night the dog in him had disappeared. An accumulation of  misfortunes had descended upon him, and out of these misfortunes--and  his present hurt--the wolf had risen savage and vengeful.

Kimball's Journal (#6)"],[1,"whom  was Mr. Richards' son, (the minister of whom I have made mention)  an attorney, practicing in that neighborhood, we found that it was  according to the laws of the land.    Brother Hyde and I then made application to the quarter sessions for  licenses and, by the assistance of Mr. Richards, obtained them.    Having now obeyed the requisitions of the law, we felt ourselves  tolerably safe, knowing that our enemies now could not lawfully make us  afraid or harm us.    Although we had many persecutors, who would have rejoiced at our  destruction and who felt a determination to overthrow the work of the  Lord, there were many who were very friendly, who would have stood by  us under all circumstances, and would not have been afraid to hazard  their lives in our behalf.    After we had labored for some time in Preston, and had baptized a  number into the kingdom of God, Brother Hyde and I went about ten  miles into the country to preach, agreeably to an invitation we had  received. We preached twice to very numerous congregations, who  paid great attention to our word, and who marveled at the things we  proclaimed. We soon returned to Preston after which I paid a visit to  the church at Walker Fold, that being the name of the place where the  Rev. Mr. Richards resided. I found the church prospering, and after  laboring a few days, several more were added. From that place I went  to Bashe Lees, where I preached, and baptized two persons. I continued  my journey thence to Ribchester, situated on the river Ribble, where I  preached to a very large congregation, and then returned to Preston.    Having had some very pressing calls to go to some villages south of  Preston, I accordingly started to visit those places, in company with  Brother F. Moon, who had been baptized a short time previous. On  arriving at our destination we gave out an appointment to preach, and,  at the time appointed, the people flocked in crowds to hear me. Among  the number were five preachers, who listened with great interest to my  discourse, and who, with the greater part of the congregation, believed  the doctrines I advanced.    The next day I went to a village called Askin, and preached in the  evening; and the following day went to Eccleston, where I had the  privilege of preaching in a Methodist chapel. The last three times  I preached I baptized ten individuals, of whom two were preachers  belonging to the Association Methodists.    After spending several days in that neighborhood I returned to Preston,  where the church had now become numerous, and with the assistance of  Elders Hyde and Fielding, proceeded to organize them. We divided the  church into several branches, and appointed proper officers to preside  over them.    Thursday evenings were appointed for prayer meetings to be held in  different parts, and Sundays for the whole church to assemble in the  Cock Pit, where the sacrament was administered, and such instructions  given as were thought necessary for their spiritual prosperity and  advantage.    While attending to this, the greatest harmony and love prevailed; and  if ever any persons received the kingdom of heaven like little children  it was those brethren.    After having attended to this duty, I again went into the country,  where I spent the principal part of my time, occasionally visiting  Preston.    During my labors, I was greatly assisted by the Spirit of the Lord, and  my soul was comforted exceedingly. Churches were raised up in different  directions, and many who had previously sat in darkness, upon them the  true light shined, and before its benign and enlightening rays, the  mists of darkness, the clouds of error and superstition fled; while  \"those who murmured learned doctrine, and those who erred in spirit  came to understanding.\"    I was instrumental in building up churches in Eccleston, Wrightington,  Askin, Exton, Daubers Lane, Chorly, Whittle and Laland Moss, after  laboring about four weeks, and baptized upwards of one hundred persons,  which caused me to rejoice exceedingly in the God and Rock of my  salvation, that I had not to labor in vain, or spend my strength for  nought. More loving and affectionate Saints I never saw before, and  they were patterns of humility.    All the here-mentioned villages are within a very short distance of  each other, and adjacent to Preston.    After my return from those places, I took a tour to the north-east  of Preston in company with Elder Fielding, where we labored together  a short time with considerable success, and raised up churches in  Ribchester, Thomly, Soney Gate Lane and at Clitheroe, a very large  market town, containing several thousand inhabitants.    At the latter place I baptized a preacher and six members of the  Methodist church, immediately after I had preached the first time. We  likewise baptized several in the town of Waddington and Downham.    The day after we preached in Downham, we received a very pressing  invitation to preach in Chatburn, but having given out an appointment  to preach in Clitheroe that evening, I informed those who had invited  me that I would not be able to comply with their request. This did  not satisfy them, and they continued to solicit me with the greatest  importunity, until I was obliged to consent to go with them, after  requesting Elder Fielding to attend to the other appointment.    On my arrival at the village I was cordially received by the  inhabitants, who turned out in large numbers to hear me preach. I  commenced my address to them in my usual manner, and the spirit of the  Lord seemed to carry the word to the hearts of the congregation, who  listened with great attention, and received the ingrafted word, which  was able to make them wise unto salvation.    Being satisfied in my mind, from the witness of the spirit, that  numbers were believing, I gave an opportunity to those who wished  to obey the gospel to do so, and immediately repaired to the water,  although it was late in the evening. Before I was done I baptized  twenty-five for the remission of their sins, and was engaged in this  pleasing duty until one o'clock, the next morning.    After being absent from Preston about seven days, in which time we had  added eighty-three souls to the Church, we returned, praising God for  all His mercies, and for visiting our labors with such abundant success.      \"No harvest joy can equal theirs    Who see the fruit of all their cares.\"        CHAPTER V.    FIRST CONFERENCE IN ENGLAND--WORD OF WISDOM FIRST TAUGHT THERE--ENEMIES  ACTIVE--URGENT INVITATION FROM A BAPTIST CHURCH--THE EFFECT OF OUR  PREACHING.    It being near Christmas, we agreed to hold a general conference in  Preston on Christmas day, there being business of importance to the  churches to be attended to; and likewise several to be ordained to the  ministry.    On Christmas day, the Saints assembled in the Cock Pit, and we then  opened the conference, which was the first that was held by the Church  of Christ in that country. There were about three hundred Saints  present on the occasion, all of whom with the exception of three had  been baptized within a very short time. Elders Hyde, Fielding and  myself were present.    The brethren were instructed in the principles of the gospel, and their  several duties enjoined upon them, as Saints of the Most High. We then  proceeded to ordain several of the brethren to the Lesser Priesthood,  to take charge of the different branches where they resided. We  confirmed fourteen who had previously been baptized, and blessed about  one hundred children.    At this conference, the Word of Wisdom was first publicly taught in  that country; having previously taught it more by example than precept;  and, from my own observation afterwards, I am happy to state that it  was almost universally attended to by the brethren.    The Spirit of the Lord was with us during our interview, and truly the  hearts of the Elders were rejoiced beyond measure when we contemplated  the glorious work which had begun. We had to exclaim, \"It is the Lord's  doings, and it is marvelous in our eyes! Blessed be the name of the  Lord!\"    I felt greatly humbled before the Lord, who had crowned our labors with  such signal success, and had prospered us far beyond my most sanguine  expectations.    Immediately after this conference, Elder Hyde and I went to a village  called Longton, situated near the sea-shore, where we raised the  standard of truth, and published to the listening crowds, the glad  tidings of salvation. After delivering two discourses, several came to  us and requested baptism. It being very cold weather, insomuch that  the streams were all frozen up, we had to repair to the sea-shore to  administer that ordinance, and immersed fifteen in the waters of the  ocean.    It would probably be too tedious, to enumerate all the particulars  which occurred during the time we sojourned in that country; I shall  therefore pass over many events which, though pleasing to us at that  time, and which showed the kind dealings of our Heavenly Father, would  not be sufficiently interesting to others. I shall therefore content  myself by giving an outline of the principal circumstances attending  our mission, which I have no doubt will be pleasing to the brethren,  and to all who love the prosperity of Zion.    From this time, until about five weeks previous to our departure from  that land, we were continually engaged in the work of the ministry,  proclaiming the everlasting gospel in all the region round about,  and baptizing all such as believed the gospel and repented of their  sins. And truly, \"the Lord of Hosts was with us, the God of Jacob was  our refuge.\" The Holy Ghost the Comforter was given to us and abode  with us in a remarkable manner, while the people thronged to hear  our addresses, and \"numbers were added to the church daily, such as  should be saved.\" We would baptize as many as fifty in Preston in a  week, "]]]
