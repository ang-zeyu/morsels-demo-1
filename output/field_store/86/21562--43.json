At this  station I watched from the bank, three feet from the spawning  shiners. Water temperature was not recorded.    The minnows performed the same types of chase and display, all in  open water, as described for Station 29-G, However, at Station 55-M,  much activity of males occurred near the small deposit of debris. It  seemed that conflict was taking place, with males behaving as  described above, and milling violently about. Examination of the  area revealed nests of _L. cyanellus_ near the debris, and some of  the activity by the shiners may have been raids on nests of the  sunfish. However, females nearing the group of males were  immediately chased by one to four individual males, with one usually  continuing pursuit after a short chase by the group. The male again  moved into position at the lower left edge of the operculum of the  female as at Station 29-G.    Another kind of behavior was observed also, in which the female  sometimes stopped. The male approached, erecting his fins and  arching his body to the left. The female also assumed this arch to  the left, and the pair moved in a tight, counter-clockwise circle,  with the male on the inside. After a short period in this position,  the male moved aside in display, and gyrated to the side and down.  Females at both stations moved about slowly, usually remaining in  the immediate vicinity of activity by males, and returning to the  area even when pursued and deserted some distance away.    =Notropis deliciosus= (Girard), sand shiner: Meek (1895:136);  Evermann and Cox (1896:402), both as _Notropis blennius_ (Girard);  and Jennings (1942:365) as _Notropis deliciosus missuriensis_  (Cope). All stations excepting 1-S, 10-G, 12-G, 17-G, 20-G, 21-G,  22-G, 24-G, 29-G, 30-M, 31-G, 32-G, 33-M, 35-M, 51-M, 55-M, 57-M,  58-G, and 59-G.    Nelson (personal communication) has studied the sand shiner in  Kansas, and has found that the Big Blue River is an area of  intergradation between the southwestern subspecies (_deliciosus_)  and the plains subspecies (_missuriensis_). _Notropis d. deliciosus_  prefers cool, rocky habitat, and occurs in small streams of the  Flint Hills, whereas _N. d. missuriensis_ occupies the sandy, turbid  Big Blue and Little Blue rivers. Intergrades occur most frequently  in the Big Blue River, but are found in all habitats.    =Notropis topeka= (Gilbert), Topeka shiner: Meek (1895:136);  Evermann and Cox (1896:403); and Minckley and Cross (in press).  Stations 10-G, 11-G, 12-G, 19-G, 31-G, and 32-G.    This species was common locally in the upland streams. Female Topeka  shiners stripped easily at Station 11-G on July 8, 1958, and adult  _N. topeka_ in high breeding condition were collected at Station  31-G on July 14, 1958. The water temperature at both stations was  77.5 deg.F. Evermann and Cox (1896:403-404) recorded female Topeka  shiners \"nearly ripe\" on June 29, 1893.    =Notropis buchanani= Meek, ghost shiner. Stations 3-S and 4-S. Only  two specimens of _N. buchanani_ were taken, both on August 14, 1957.  These specimens (KU 3833), a female with well-developed ova, and a  tuberculate male, were near a sandbar in the main channel. To my  knowledge, this is the first published record of the ghost shiner  from the Kansas River Basin. Mr. James Booth, State Biological  Survey, collected _N. buchanani_ from two stations on Mill Creek,  Wabaunsee County, Kansas, 1953.    =Hybognathus nuchalis= Agassiz, silvery minnow. Stations 2-S, 3-S,  4-S, 7-G, 8-S, and 16-G.    This species was taken sporadically, but sometimes abundantly, in  the Big Blue River. At Stations 7-G and 16-G a few young-of-the-year  were found.       TABLE 2. COMPARISONS OF THREE SERIES OF _HYBOGNATHUS_, 50 SPECIMENS     EACH, FROM DIFFERENT STREAM SYSTEMS.

In Table 2, I have compared measurements and counts of 50 specimens  of _Hybognathus_ from the Big Blue River, 50 _H. n. placita_ from  the Walnut River, Kansas (Arkansas River Basin), and 50 _H. n.  nuchalis_ from Wisconsin. Measurements and counts were made by  methods described by Hubbs and Lagler (1947:8-15) and measurements  are expressed as thousandths of standard length.    _Hybognathus_ from the Big Blue River tend to have fewer, larger  scales than _H. n. placita_ from the Walnut River, Kansas, but more  and smaller scales than _H. n. nuchalis_ from Wisconsin. In  specimens from the Blue River, the size of the orbit divided by  standard length, and the width of gape divided by standard length  and width of orbit, are also intermediate between the Walnut River  and Wisconsin specimens, but tend toward the former. Specimens from  the Big Blue River resemble _H. n. placita_ from the Walnut River in  body shape, robustness, and in the embedding of scales on the nape.    =Pimephales notatus= (Rafinesque), bluntnose minnow: Meek  (1895:136); and Evermann and Cox (1896:399). Stations 2-S, 3-S, 5-G,  6-S, 8-S, 9-G, 10-G, 11-G, 12-G, 13-G, 16-G, 19-G, 27-G, 29-G, 53-S,  54-G, and 58-G.    The bluntnose minnow preferred the clearer creeks, with gravel or  gravel-silt bottoms, but occurred rarely in the mainstream of the  Big Blue River. Males and females in high breeding condition were  taken on July 14, 1958. The temperature of the water was 75.5 deg. F.    =Pimephales promelas= Rafinesque, fathead minnow: Meek (1895: 136);  and Evermann and Cox (1896:397-398). All stations excepting 1-S,  4-S, 12-G, 30-M, 43-S, 44-S, and 56-S.    Small muddy streams were preferred by _P. promelas_; however, the  fathead minnow was taken in all habitats, and in association with  most other species.    Canfield and Wiebe (1931:6-7) may have recorded _P. promelas_ from  the Big Blue River Basin, Nebraska, as \"blackhead minnows.\"    =Campostoma anomalum plumbeum= (Girard), stoneroller. All stations  excepting 1-S, 2-S, 3-S, 14-S, 15-S, 21-G, 22-G, 28-G, 30-M, 33-M,  34-M, 35-M, 36-M, 37-M, 38-S, 41-S, 44-S, 45-M, 51-M, 52-S, and  55-M.    Stonerollers were usually taken in riffles with gravel-rubble  bottoms. Those individuals collected in areas with mud or sand  bottoms were almost invariably in the current, or in the edge of  currents.    Specimens from the Big Blue River Basin have an average of 47.4  scale-rows around the body (range 42-54).    =Ictalurus melas= (Rafinesque), black bullhead: Evermann and Cox  (1896:387) as _Ameiurus melas_ (Rafines"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3775"],[0,"Napoleon Bonaparte (#6)"],[1,"the same hour in which the fatal  bullet pierced the breast of Desaix, an assassin in Egypt plunged  a dagger into the bosom of Kleber. The spirits of these illustrious  men, these blood-stained warriors, thus unexpectedly met in the  spirit-land. There they wander now. How impenetrable the vail which  shuts their destiny from our view. The soul longs for clearer vision  of that far-distant world, people by the innumerable host of the  mighty dead. There Napoleon now dwells. Does he retain his intellectual  supremacy? Do his generals gather around him with love and homage!  Has his pensive spirit sunk down into gloom and despair, or has  it soared into cloudless regions of purity and peace! The mystery  of death' Death alone can solve it. Christianity, with its lofty  revealings, sheds but dim twilight upon the world off departed  spirits. At St. Helena Napoleon said, \"Of all the general I ever had  under my command Desaix and Kleber possessed the greatest talent.  In particular Desaix, as Kleber loved glory only as the means of  acquiring wealth and pleasure. Desaix loved glory for itself, and  despised every other consideration. To him riches and pleasure were  of no value, nor did he ever give them a moment's thought. He was  a little black-looking man, about an inch shorter than myself,  always badly dressed, sometimes even ragged, and despising alike  comfort and convenience. Enveloped in a cloak, Desaix would throw  himself under a gun and sleep as contentedly as if reposing in a  palace. Luxury had for him no charms. Frank and honest in all his  proceedings, he was denominated by the Arabs Sultan the Just. Nature  intended him to figure as a consummate general. Kleber and Desaix  were irreparable losses to France.\"    It is impossible to describe the dismay, which pervaded the camp  of the Austrians after this terrible defeat. They were entirely  cut from all retreat, and were at the mercy of Napoleon. A council  of war was held by the Austrian officers during the night, and it  was unanimously resolved that capitulation was unavoidable. Early  the next morning a flag of truce was sent to the head-quarters of  Napoleon. The Austrians offered to abandon Italy, if the generosity  of the victor would grant them the boon of not being made prisoners  of war. Napoleon met the envoy with great courtesy, and, according  to his custom, stated promptly and irrevocably the conditions  upon which he was willing to treat. The terms were generous. \"The  Austrian armies,\" said he, \"may unmolested return to their homes;  but all of Italy must be abandoned.\" Melas, who was eighty years  of age, hoped to modify the terms, and again sent the negotiator  to suggest some alterations. \"Monsieur!\" said Napoleon, \"my  conditions are irrevocable. I did not begin to make war yesterday.  Your position is as perfectly comprehended by me as by yourselves.  You are encumbered with dead, sick, and wounded, destitute of  provisions, deprived of the elite of your army, surrounded on every  side, I might exact every thing. But I respect the white hairs of  your general, and the valor of your soldiers. I ask nothing but what  is rigorously justified by the present position of affairs. Take  what steps you may, you will have no other terms.\" The conditions  were immediately signed, and a suspension of arms was agreed upon,  until an answer could be received from Vienna.    Napoleon left Paris for this campaign on the 7th of May. The battle  of Marengo was fought on the 14th of June. Thus in five weeks  Napoleon has scaled the barrier of the Alps: with sixty thousand  soldiers, most of them undisciplined recruits, he had utterly  discomfited an army of one hundred and twenty thousand men, and  regained the whole of Italy. The bosom of every Frenchman throbbed  with gratitude and pride. One wild shout of enthusiasm ascended  from united France. Napoleon had laid the foundation of his throne  deep in the heart of the French nation, and there that foundation  still remains unshaken.    Napoleon now entered Milan in triumph. He remained there ten days,  busy apparently every hour, by day and by night, in re-organizing the  political condition of Italy. The serious and religious tendencies  of his mind are developed by the following note, which four days  after the battle of Marengo, he wrote to the Consuls in Paris:  \"To-day, whatever our atheists may say to it, I go in great state  to the To Deum which is to be chanted in the Cathedral of Milan. *  * The Te Deum , is an anthem of praise, sung in churches on occasion  of thanksgiving. It is so called from the first words \"Te Deum  laudamus,\" Thee God we praise    An unworthy spirit of detraction has vainly sought to wrest from  Napoleon the honor of this victory, and to attribute it all to the  flank charge made by Kellerman. Such attempts deserve no detail  reply. Napoleon had secretly and suddenly called into being an army,  and by its apparently miraculous creation had astounded Europe. He  had effectually deceived the vigilance of his enemies, so as to  leave them entirely in the dark respecting his point of attack.  He had conveyed that army with all its stores, over the pathless  crags of the Great St. Bernard. Like an avalanche he had descended  from the mountains upon the plains of startled Italy. He had  surrounded the Austrian hosts, though they were doubled his numbers,  with a net through which they could not break. In a decisive  battle he had scattered their ranks before him, like chaff by the  whirlwind. He was nobly seconded by those generals whom his genius  had chosen and created. It is indeed true, that without his generals  and his soldiers he could not have gained the victory. Massena  contributed to the result by his matchless defense of Genoa; Moreau,  by holding in abeyance the army of the Rhine; Lannes, by his iron  firmness on the plain of Montebello; Desaix, by the promptness  with which he rushed to the rescue, as soon as his car caught the  far-off thunders of the cannon of Marengo; and Kellerman, by his  admirable flank charge of cavalry. But it was the genius of Napoleon  which planned the mighty combination, which roused and directed  the enthusiasm of the generals, which inspired the soldiers with  fearlessness and nerved them for the strife, and which, through  these efficient agencies, secured the astounding results.    Napoleon established his triumphant army, now increased to eighty  thousand men, in the rich valley of the Po. He assigned to the  heroic Massena the command of this triumphant host, and ordering  all the forts and citadels which blocked the approaches from France  to be blown up, set out, on the 24th of June, for his return to  Paris. In re-crossing the Alps, by the pass of Mt. Cenis, he met  the carriage of Madame Kellerman, who was going to Italy to join  her husband. Napoleon ordered his carriage to be stopped, and  alighting, greeted the lady with great courtesy, and congratulated  her upon the gallant conduct of her husband at Marengo. As he was  riding along one day, Bourrienne spoke of the world-wide renown  which the First Consul had attained.    \"Yes,\" Napoleon thoughtfully replied. \"A few more events like this  campaign, and my name may perhaps go down to posterity.\"    \"I think,\" Bourrienne rejoined, \"that you have already done enough  to secure a long and lasting fame.\"    \"Done enough!\" Napoleon replied. \"You are very good! It is true  that in less than two years I have conquered Cairo, Paris, Milan.  But were I to die to-morrow, half a page of general history would  be all that would be devoted to my exploits.\"    Napoleon's return to Paris, through the provinces of France, was  a scene of constant triumph. The joy of the people amounted almost  to frenzy. Bonfires, illuminations, the pealing of bells, and the  thunders of artillery accompanied him all the way. Long lines of  young maidens, selected for their grace and beauty, formed avenues  of loveliness and smiles through which he was to pass, and carpeted  his path with flowers. He arrived in Paris at midnight the 2d of  July, having been absent but eight weeks.    The enthusiasm of the Parisians was unbounded and inexhaustible.  Day after day, and night after night, the festivities continued.  The Palace of the Tuileries was ever thronged with a crowd, eager  to catch a glimpse of the preserver of France. All the public bodies  waited upon him with congratulations. Bells rung, cannon thundered,  bonfires and illuminations blazed, rockets and fire-works,  in meteoric splendor filled the air, bands of music poured forth  their exuberant strains, and united Paris, thronging the garden of  the Tuileries and flooding back into the Elysian Fields, rent the  heavens with deafening shouts of exultation. As Napoleon stood at  the window of his palace, witnessing this spectacle of a nation's  gratitude, he said, \"The sound of these acclamations is as sweet  to me, as the voice of Josephine. How happy I am to be beloved by  such a people.\" Preparations were immediately made for a brilliant  and imposing solemnity in commemoration of the victory. \"Let  no triumphal arch be raised to me,\" said Napoleon. \"I wish for no  triumphal arch but the public satisfaction.\"    It is not strange that enthusiasm and gratitude should have glowed  in the ardent bosoms of the French. In four months Napoleon had  raised France from an abyss of ruin to the highest pinnacle of  prosperity and renown. For anarchy he had substituted law, for bankruptcy  a well-replenished treasury, for ignominious defeat resplendent  victory, for universal discontent as universal satisfaction. The  invaders were driven from France, the hostile alliance broken, and  the blessings of peace were now promised to the war-harassed nation.    During this campaign there was presented a very interesting  illustration of Napoleon's wonderful power of anticipating the  progress of coming events. Bourrienne, one day, just"]]]
