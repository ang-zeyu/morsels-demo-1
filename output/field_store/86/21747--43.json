Why didn't he make us BOTH  white?\"    \"I don't know; try to go to sleep, and you will feel better in the  morning,\" was all the reply he could make to her knotty queries. It was  a long time before she fell asleep; and a number of days before James  felt in a mood to visit and entertain old associates and friends.          CHAPTER V. DEPARTURES.        Life is a strange avenue of various trees and flowers;      Lightsome at commencement, but darkening to its end in a distant,      massy portal.        It beginneth as a little path, edged with the violet and primrose,      A little path of lawny grass and soft to tiny feet.      Soon, spring thistles in the way.        TUPPER.        JAMES' visit concluded. Frado had become greatly attached to him, and  with sorrow she listened and joined in the farewells which preceded his  exit. The remembrance of his kindness cheered her through many a weary  month, and an occasional word to her in letters to Jack, were like \"cold  waters to a thirsty soul.\" Intelligence came that James would soon  marry; Frado hoped he would, and remove her from such severe treatment  as she was subject to. There had been additional burdens laid on her  since his return. She must now MILK the cows, she had then only to  drive. Flocks of sheep had been added to the farm, which daily claimed a  portion of her time. In the absence of the men, she must harness the  horse for Mary and her mother to ride, go to mill, in short, do the work  of a boy, could one be procured to endure the tirades of Mrs. Bellmont.  She was first up in the morning, doing what she could towards breakfast.  Occasionally, she would utter some funny thing for Jack's benefit, while  she was waiting on the table, provoking a sharp look from his mother, or  expulsion from the room.    On one such occasion, they found her on the roof of the barn. Some  repairs having been necessary, a staging had been erected, and was not  wholly removed. Availing herself of ladders, she was mounted in high  glee on the topmost board. Mr. Bellmont called sternly for her to come  down; poor Jane nearly fainted from fear. Mrs. B. and Mary did not care  if she \"broke her neck,\" while Jack and the men laughed at her  fearlessness. Strange, one spark of playfulness could remain amid such  constant toil; but her natural temperament was in a high degree  mirthful, and the encouragement she received from Jack and the hired  men, constantly nurtured the inclination. When she had none of the  family around to be merry with, she would amuse herself with the  animals. Among the sheep was a willful leader, who always persisted in  being first served, and many times in his fury he had thrown down Nig,  till, provoked, she resolved to punish him. The pasture in which the  sheep grazed was founded on three sides by a wide stream, which flowed  on one side at the base of precipitous banks. The first spare moments at  her command, she ran to the pasture with a dish in her hand, and  mounting the highest point of land nearest the stream, called the flock  to their mock repast. Mr. Bellmont, with his laborers, were in sight,  though unseen by Frado. They paused to see what she was about to do.  Should she by any mishap lose her footing, she must roll into the  stream, and, without aid, must drown. They thought of shouting; but they  feared an unexpected salute might startle her, and thus ensure what they  were anxious to prevent. They watched in breathless silence. The willful  sheep came furiously leaping and bounding far in advance of the flock.  Just as he leaped for the dish, she suddenly jumped to one side, when  down he rolled into the river, and swimming across, remained alone till  night. The men lay down, convulsed with laughter at the trick, and  guessed at once its object. Mr. Bellmont talked seriously to the child  for exposing herself to such danger; but she hopped about on her toes,  and with laughable grimaces replied, she knew she was quick enough to  \"give him a slide.\"    But to return. James married a Baltimorean lady of wealthy parentage, an  indispensable requisite, his mother had always taught him. He did not  marry her wealth, though; he loved HER, sincerely. She was not unlike  his sister Jane, who had a social, gentle, loving nature, rather TOO  yielding, her brother thought. His Susan had a firmness which Jane  needed to complete her character, but which her ill health may in a  measure have failed to produce. Although an invalid, she was not  excluded from society. Was it strange SHE should seem a desirable  companion, a treasure as a wife?    Two young men seemed desirous of possessing her. One was a neighbor,  Henry Reed, a tall, spare young man, with sandy hair, and blue, sinister  eyes. He seemed to appreciate her wants, and watch with interest her  improvement or decay. His kindness she received, and by it was almost  won. Her mother wished her to encourage his attentions. She had counted  the acres which were to be transmitted to an only son; she knew there  was silver in the purse; she would not have Jane too sentimental.    The eagerness with which he amassed wealth, was repulsive to Jane; he  did not spare his person or beasts in its pursuit. She felt that to such  a man she should be considered an incumbrance; she doubted if he would  desire her, if he did not know she would bring a handsome patrimony. Her  mother, full in favor with the parents of Henry, commanded her to accept  him. She engaged herself, yielding to her mother's wishes, because she  had not strength to oppose them; and sometimes, when witness of her  mother's and Mary's tyranny, she felt any change would be preferable,  even such a one as this. She knew her husband should be the man of her  own selecting, one she was conscious of preferring before all others.  She could not say this of Henry.    In this dilemma, a visitor came to Aunt Abby's; one of her  boy-favorites, George Means, from an adjoining State. Sensible, plain  looking, agreeable, talented, he could not long be a stranger to any one  who wished to know him. Jane was accustomed to sit much with Aunt Abby  always; her presence now seemed necessary to assist in entertaining this  youthful friend. Jane was more pleased with him each day, and silently  wished Henry possessed more refinement, and the polished manners of  George. She felt dissatisfied with her relation to him. His calls while  George was there, brought their opposing qualities vividly before her,  and she found it disagreeable to force herself into those attentions  belonging to him. She received him apparently only as a neighbor.    George returned home, and Jane endeavored to stifle the risings of  dissatisfaction, and had nearly succeeded, when a letter came which  needed but one glance to assure her of its birthplace; and she retired  for its perusal. Well was it for her that her mother's suspicion was not  aroused, or her curiosity startled to inquire who it came from. After  reading it, she glided into Aunt Abby's, and placed it in her hands, who  was no stranger to Jane's trials.    George could not rest after his return, he wrote, until he had  communicated to Jane the emotions her presence awakened, and his desire  to love and possess her as his own. He begged to know if his affections  were reciprocated, or could be; if she would permit him to write to her;  if she was free from all obligation to another.    \"What would mother say?\" queried Jane, as she received the letter from  her aunt.    \"Not much to comfort you.\"    \"Now, aunt, George is just such a man as I could really love, I think,  from all I have seen of him; you know I never could say that of Henry\"--    \"Then don't marry him,\" interrupted Aunt Abby.    \"Mother will make me.\"    \"Your father won't.\"    \"Well, aunt, what can I do? Would you answer the letter, or not?\"    \"Yes, answer it. Tell him your situation.\"    \"I shall not tell him all my feelings.\"    Jane answered that she had enjoyed his company much; she had seen  nothing offensive in his manner or appearance; that she was under no  obligations which forbade her receiving letters from him as a friend and  acquaintance. George was puzzled by the reply. He wrote to Aunt Abby,  and from her learned all. He could not see Jane thus sacrificed, without  making an effort to rescue her. Another visit followed. George heard  Jane say she preferred HIM. He then conferred with Henry at his home. It  was not a pleasant subject to talk upon. To be thus supplanted, was not  to be thought of. He would sacrifice everything but his inheritance to  secure his betrothed.    \"And so you are the cause of her late coldness towards me. Leave! I will  talk no more about it; the business is settled between us; there it will  remain,\" said Henry.    \"Have you no wish to know the real state of Jane's affections towards  you?\" asked George.    \"No! Go, I say! go!\" and Henry opened the door for him to pass out.    He retired to Aunt Abby's. Henry soon followed, and presented his cause  to Mrs. Bellmont.    Provoked, surprised, indignant, she summoned Jane to her presence, and  after a lengthy tirade upon Nab, and her satanic influence, told her she  could not break the bonds which held her to Henry; she should not.  George Means was rightly named; he was, truly, mean enough; she knew his  family of old; his father had four wives, and five times as many  children.    \"Go to your room, Miss Jane,\" she continued. \"Don't let me know of your  being in Nab's for one while.\"    The storm was now visible to all beholders. Mr. Bellmont sought Jane.  She told him her objections to Henry; showed him George's letter; told  her answer, the occasion of his visit. He bade her not make herself  sick; he would see that she was not compelled to violate her free choice  in so important a transaction."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5844"],[0,"The Adventures of Johnny Chuck (#6)"],[1,"had left the Green  Meadows. No, indeed! He loved them too well for that. But he loved Polly  Chuck more, and although he had grumbled a little, he had followed her  up to the old orchard, and now they were going to stay there. Sometimes  Johnny shivered when he thought how near were Farmer Brown and Farmer  Brown's boy and Bowser the Hound.    He had never been so far from his old home on the Green Meadows before,  and it was all very strange up here. It was very lovely, too. Besides,  it was in this very old orchard that Polly Chuck had been born, and she  knew every part of it. Johnny felt better when he found that out. So  he set to work to build a home, and this time he meant business. Polly  Chuck could change her mind as many times as she pleased; that was going  to be their home and that was where they were going to live.    Now Johnny Chuck had grown wise in the ways of the world since he first  ran away from the home where he was born. Twice since then he had built  a new home, and now this would be better than either of the others. He  paid no heed to Polly, when she pouted because he did not dig where she  wanted him to. He went from tree to tree, big old apple-trees they were,  and at the very last tree, way down in a corner near a tumbled-down  stone wall, he found what he wanted--two spreading roots gave him a  chance to dig between them.    Polly watched him get ready for work and she pouted some more.    \"It would be a lot nicer out in that grassy place, and a lot easier to  dig,\" said she.    Johnny Chuck smiled and made the dirt fly. \"It certainly would be easier  to dig,\" said he, when he stopped for breath, \"easier for me and easier  for Bowser the Hound or for old Granny Fox, if either wanted to dig us  out. Now, these old roots are just far enough apart for us to go in  and out. They make a beautiful doorway. But Bowser the Hound cannot get  through if he tries, and he can't make our doorway any larger. Don't you  see how safe it is?\"    Polly Chuck had to own up that it was safer than a home in the open  could possibly be, and Johnny went on digging. He made a long hall down  to the snuggest of bedrooms, deep, deep down under ground. Then he made  a long back hall, and all the sand from this he carried out the front  way. By and by he made a back door at the end of the back hall, and  it opened right behind a big stone fallen from the old stone wall. You  would never have guessed that there was a back door there.    His new house was finished now, and Johnny Chuck and Polly Chuck sat on  the door-step and watched jolly, round, red Mr. Sun go to bed behind the  Purple Hills and were happy.          XV. SAMMY JAY FINDS THE NEW HOME      Johnny Chuck was missed from his old home on the Green Meadows. If he  had known how much he was missed, he certainly would have tried to go  back for at least a call on his old neighbors. There had been great  surprise when it had been discovered that Jimmy Skunk was living in  Johnny's old house, and at first some of the little meadow people were  inclined to look at Jimmy a wee bit distrustfully when he told how  Johnny Chuck had given away his house.    When Johnny sent back word by the Merry Little Breezes that it was true,  they believed Jimmy Skunk and forgot the unpleasant things that they  had begun to hint at about him. But they one and all thought that Johnny  Chuck must be crazy. Yes, Sir, they thought that Johnny Chuck must be  crazy. They were sure of it when the Merry Little Breezes brought word  of how Johnny had started out to see the world.    But everybody was so busy about their own affairs in the beautiful  bright spring-time that they couldn't spend much time wondering about  Johnny Chuck. They missed him every time they passed his old house and  then forgot him; that is, most of the little meadow people did.    Peter Rabbit didn't. Peter used to stop every day to gossip with Johnny  Chuck and tell him all the news, and now that Johnny Chuck was no longer  there, Peter missed him greatly. Jimmy Skunk was always asleep or off  somewhere. Besides, he was such a traveler that he knew all the news  almost as soon as Peter himself.    The Merry Little Breezes told Peter that Johnny Chuck was still on the  Green Meadows, hunting for a new home, so Peter made up his mind that  just as soon as Johnny got settled, Peter would hunt him up and call.  You see, he never dreamed that Johnny would leave the Green Meadows, and  he thought that of course the Merry Little Breezes would tell him just  where Johnny Chuck's new house was, whenever it was built. But there is  where Peter made a mistake.    The Merry Little Breezes are the friends of all the little meadow and  forest people, but they wouldn't be very long if they told everything  that they find out.         Their merry tongues they guard full well       And things they shouldn't never tell,       For long ago they learned the way       To keep a secret night and day.    And so when they found Johnny Chuck's new house in the corner of Farmer  Brown's old orchard, they promised Johnny that they wouldn't tell  anybody, and they didn't. So it was a long time before any one else  found out what had become of Johnny Chuck, for no one thought of looking  in the corner of the old orchard.    The Merry Little Breezes used to come every day and bring Johnny Chuck  the news, and he and Polly Chuck would laugh and tickle, as they thought  of Peter Rabbit hunting and hunting and never finding them.    Then one morning, as Johnny Chuck sat on his door-step, half dozing in  the sun with his heart filled with contentment, he happened to look up  straight into two sharp eyes peering down at him from among the leaves  of the apple-tree under which he had built his house. He knew those  eyes. They were such sharp eyes that they were unpleasant. He didn't  even have to look for the blue and white coat of the owner to know who  had found his snug home. But he pretended to keep right on dozing, and  pretty soon the owner of the eyes disappeared without making a sound.    \"Oh, dear,\" sighed Johnny Chuck, \"now the whole world will know where  we live, for that was Sammy Jay.\" Then his face brightened as he added:  \"Anyway, he didn't see Polly Chuck, and he doesn't know anything about  her, so I'll keep twice as sharp a watch as before.\"          XVI. SAMMY JAY PLANS MISCHIEF           Mischief may not mean to be really truly bad,       But somehow it seems to make other people sad;       Does a mean unpleasant thing and tries to think it fun;       Then, alas, it runs away when trouble has begun.    Of all the little people who live in the Green Forest and on the Green  Meadows, none is more mischievous than Sammy Jay. It seems sometimes as  if there was more mischief under that pert little cap Sammy Jay wears  than in the heads of all the other little meadow and forest people put  together. When he isn't actually in mischief, Sammy Jay is planning  mischief. You see it has grown to be a habit with Sammy Jay, and habits,  especially bad habits, have a way of growing and growing.    Now Sammy Jay had no quarrel with Johnny Chuck. Oh, my, no! He would  have told you that he liked Johnny Chuck. Everybody likes Johnny Chuck.  But just as soon as Sammy Jay found Johnny Chuck's new house, he began  to plan mischief. He didn't really want any harm to come to Johnny  Chuck, but he wanted to make Johnny uncomfortable. That is Sammy Jay's  idea of fun--seeing somebody else uncomfortable. So he slipped away to  a thick hemlock-tree in the Green Forest to try to think of some plan to  tease Johnny Chuck and make him uncomfortable.    Of course he knew that Johnny had hidden his new house in the corner  of Farmer Brown's old orchard because he wanted it to be a secret. He  didn't know why Johnny wanted it a secret and he didn't care. If Johnny  wanted it a secret, it would be fun to tell everybody about it. As he  sat wondering who he should tell first; he saw Reddy Fox trotting down  the Lone Little Path.    \"Hi, Reddy Fox!\" he shouted.    Reddy looked up. \"Hello, Sammy Jay! What have you got on your mind this  morning?\" said Reddy.    \"Nothing much,\" replied Sammy Jay. \"What's the news?\"    Reddy grinned. \"There isn't any news,\" said he. \"I was just going to ask  you the same thing.\"    It was Sammy Jay's turn to grin, \"Just as if I could tell you any news,  Reddy Fox! Just as if I could tell you any news!\" he exclaimed. \"Why,  everybody knows that you are so smart that you find out everything as  soon as it happens.\"    Reddy Fox felt flattered. You know people who do a great deal of  flattering themselves are often the very easiest to flatter if you know  how. Reddy pretended to be very modest; but no one likes to be thought  smart and important more than Reddy Fox does, and it pleased him greatly  that Sammy Jay should think him so smart that no one could tell him any  news. Sammy knew this perfectly well, and he chuckled to himself as he  watched Reddy Fox pretending to be so modest.    \"Have you called on Johnny Chuck at his new home yet?\" asked Sammy Jay,  in the most matter-of-fact way.    \"No,\" replied Reddy, \"but I mean to, soon.\" He said this just as if he  knew all about Johnny Chuck's new home, when all the time he hadn't  the remotest idea in the world where it was. In fact he had hunted and  hunted for it, but hadn't found a trace of it. And all the time Sammy  Jay knew that Reddy didn't know where it was. But Sammy didn't let on  that he knew.    \"I just happened to be up in Farmer Brown's old orchard this morning, so  I thought I'd pay Johnny Chuck a call,\" said Sammy, and chuckled as he  saw Reddy's ears prick up. \"By the way, he thinks you don't know where  he lives now.\"    \"Huh!\" said Reddy Fox. \"As if Johnny Chuck could fool me! Well, I must  be moving along. Good-by, Sammy Jay.\"    Reddy trotted off towards the Green Meadows, but the minute he was out  of sight of Sammy Jay, he turned towards"]]]
