Near  them were placed some other pieces of Squarcione also in _terra verde_,  which were defaced in the time of Algarotti, who regrets their loss in  one of his elegant and pleasing letters. Their style is altogether  analogous to that of his school; animated figures, neat in the folds,  foreshortenings not usual in works of that age, and attempts, though yet  immature, at approaching towards the style of the ancient Greeks.    Proceeding from Padua, in the direction of Germany, we meet with some  anonymous paintings, in the districts of Trevigi and Friuli, which  ought, apparently, to be referred to this epoch; so far removed are they  in style from the nobler method, we shall shortly have to describe. The  name of Antonio is well known in Treviso, an artist who produced a S.  Cristoforo, of gigantic stature, tolerably well executed, in San  Niccolo, and that of Liberale da Campo, author of a _Presepio_, which is  placed in the cathedral. Superior to both of these must have been  Giorgio da Trevigi, if we are to believe Rossetti, where he mentions his  introduction into Padua, in 1437, in order to paint the celebrated tower  of the Horologe. There exist other pictures of the fourteenth century,  more or less perfect, interspersed throughout the Marca Trevigiana, and  more particularly in Serravalle. Other places in Italy, indeed, bear the  same name, derived from the inclosed form of the mountains; this,  however, is the largest of the whole, being a rich and ornate city,  where Titian was in the habit of spending some months in the year at the  house of his son-in-law, by way of amusement, and has left there several  memorials of his art. But the whole of the church of the Battuti appears  ornamented in a more antique taste, executed in such a manner, that I  was assured, by a person who witnessed it, that it most of all resembled  a sacred museum of art. The whole must have been the work of the same  artists that we have just been recording in other cities, inasmuch as  the names of no natives are known beyond the single one of Valentina.  He, indeed, verged upon the improved age; but in Ceneda, that boasts  various altarpieces of his hand, as well as in Serravalle itself, where  he painted another, with some saints of the Holy Family, he still  appears a disciple of the ancients, and a copyist of Squarcione, of  Padua. We shall soon discover more celebrated artists rising up in this  province, after the introduction into the Trevigiana, of the method of  the Bellini.    The artists of Friuli availed themselves of it less early, not having  sufficiently imbibed the principles of modern taste, even as late as the  year 1500, either, in the opinion of Rinaldis, from the secluded  situation of the place, or from the disturbed and revolutionary  character of the times. Hence it is that the provincial painters of that  period are to be referred wholly to this, not to the subsequent era of  the art. To such belongs Andrea Bellunello, of San Vito, whose  masterpiece is a Crucifixion, among various saints, with the date of  1475, exhibited in the great council chamber at Udine. It has some merit  in regard to the size, and the distribution of its figures; but displays  neither beauty of forms, nor colour, and we might almost pronounce it an  ancient piece of tapestry, when placed by the side of a beautiful  picture. Nevertheless, in his own district, he was considered the Zeuxis  and Apelles of his age.[23] Contemporary with him, was Domenico di  Tolmezzo, who painted an altarpiece in various compartments for the  cathedral of Udine; a Madonna, in the taste of those times, with some  saints, figures which all partake of the ancient Venetian style, even to  the colouring, insomuch that one might believe him to have been a  disciple of that school. He has attached his name and the year, 1479,  and it would appear that there belonged to the same piece, exhibiting a  figure of the blessed Bertrando, Patriarch of Aquileja, two oblong  tablets, one of which represents his offering of alms, the other the  circumstances of the death he suffered. The whole of these paintings,  which I have noticed, are tolerably executed, in particular the two  histories, and are preserved in two chambers of the Canonica. Not far  from the same place is seen a figure of the saint, in fresco, painted by  Francesco de Alessiis, in 1494, and placed over the door of a house,  formerly the college of S. Girolamo.    While the schools of the state thus continued to advance, a knowledge of  design became more general in Venice; and in the latter part of the  century, its artists, for the most part, had acquired a taste similar to  what I have already described as influencing those of other places--a  taste rather removed from the antique coarseness, than adorned with the  elegance of the moderns. Although the use of canvass had been already  adopted in Venice, like that of boards elsewhere, a circumstance for  which Vasari accounts, in treating of the Bellini, there was no  composition besides water colours, or distemper; excellent, indeed, for  the preservation of tints, as we perceive from unfaded specimens in the  present day, but unfriendly to the production of union, smoothness, and  softness. At length appeared the secret of colouring in oils from  Flanders, a discovery conferring a happier era upon the Italian Schools,  and in particular upon that of Venice, which availed itself of it above  every other, and apparently the very first of all. In the Florentine  School I have described the origin of this invention, ascribing it,  along with Vasari, to Giovanni Van Eych, and both there and in the  Neapolitan, I have also shewn that the first who communicated it to  Italy was Antonello da Messina, having been instructed in it by Giovanni  himself in Flanders. The historical account of this Messinese, as I have  repeatedly before observed, has never been sufficiently elucidated.  Vasari and Ridolfi state such facts respecting him as are not easily  reconcilable to the period of life in general assigned to him, reaching  only to forty-nine years; and I have proved, in collecting memorials, to  which they had no access, alluded to in the Neapolitan School, that  there were two distinct visits made by Antonello to Venice. The first,  it appears to me, must have taken place soon after his return into  Italy; at which time he concealed the discovery from every one, except  it were Domenico Veneziano, who is known to have availed himself of it  for many years, both in Venice and elsewhere. During that period  Antonello visited other places, and more especially Milan, whence he  returned to Venice for the second time, and as it is said, _received a  public salary_, and then he divulged the method of painting in oils to  the Venetian professors; a circumstance which, according to the  superscriptions attached to his pictures, appears to have taken place  about the year 1474. Other signatures are to be met with as late as  1490, insomuch that he must have run a longer career than that which has  above been assigned him. And we are here arrived at an era, at once the  happiest and most controverted of any. But of the Venetians we shall  treat presently, after alluding to the works of this foreign artist  apart. Two altarpieces by his hand are recorded, which were painted for  the two churches of the Dominante, besides several Madonnas, and other  holy pieces intended for private houses, together with some few  productions in fresco. There is no doubt but he also produced many  others, both at the instance of natives and of foreigners, relieving  himself from the multiplicity of his commissions by the aid of Pino di  Messina, the same who is commended in the memoirs of Hackert, as the  pupil and companion of Antonello's labours at Venice. It is not  mentioned whether he produced any specimens of his art in Sicily, nor am  I certain whether he returned thither. In many Venetian collections,  however, they are still preserved, and display a very correct taste,  united to a most delicate command of the pencil; and among others is a  portrait in the possession of the family Martinengo, bearing the  inscription _Antonellus Messaneus me fecit, 1474_.    In the council hall of the Ten is also to be seen one of his pictures of  a Pieta, half-length, subscribed, _Antonius Messinensis_. The features  of the countenances, though animated, are not at all select, nor have  much of the Italian expression; and his colours in this and other of his  productions that I have seen, are less vivid than in some Venetian  artists of that age, who carried the perfection of colouring to its  highest pitch.    There is good authority for believing that, together with Antonello, or  very near the same period, there flourished in Venice one of the best  Flemish disciples of Giovanni Van Eych; called by Vasari, Ruggieri da  Bruggia. There appears, in the Palazzo Nani, adorned by its present  owner in the hereditary taste of his noble family, with the most  splendid monuments of antiquity, a San Girolamo between two holy  virgins, a picture, as is shewn from the following inscription, by his  hand,--_Sumus Rugerii manus_. It is drawn with more merit in point of  colouring than of design, upon Venetian pine wood, not upon Flemish oak;  and for this reason it is considered by Zanetti, as the production of a  native artist. But if the Venetians had really possessed a painter of so  much merit, towards the year 1500, how is it possible that he should be  distinguished only by this solitary specimen of his powers. Even the  very imposing formula he made use of in subscribing his name, contrary  to the usual practice of those times, without mention either of family  or of place, is it not altogether like that of an artist who feels and  displays his own celebrity?[24] To me it does not appear at all  improbable that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3470"],[0,"Such Is Life (#6)"],[1,"Mosey.  \"The other feller he left  the shed three days ahead of us; an' when we drawed out, an' camped  at the Four-mile Tank, this feller's wagon was standin' there yet;  an' no sign o' him nor his carrion.  I was thinkin' he'd have some fun  with Pilot, 'specially on account of havin' to do his bullick-huntin' on foot;  for he could n't afford to git another horse till he delivered.  Well, I never seen him agen till to-day when we stopped for dinner;  but the feller at the Bilby Well he told me about it when we was goin' back  to Bargoona, nex' trip.\"    \"Seems, the other feller he goes out in the mornin' on foot,  thinkin' to fine his carrion among that mulgar in the corner to yer left;  an' when he got to the corner, there was a hole in the fence,  an' the tracks through.  Course, he runs the tracks; he runs 'em all day,  an' at night he lays down, an' I s'pose he swears his self to sleep.  Nex' mornin', off he scoots agen, an' jist before sundown he hears the bells,  an' he pipes the tail end o' the string ahead; an' the front end  was jist at the Bilby Well--sixty good mile, if it's an inch,  an' scrub all the road.  Pilot he had n't thought worth while to go roun'  by the Boundary Tank, to git on the wool track; he jist went ahead  like a surveyor, an' the fences was like spiders' webs to him.  It was blazing hot weather; and the other fellow he never seen tucker  nor water all the trip, for he wouldn't leave the track.  Laugh?  Lord!  I thought I'd 'a' busted when the bloke at the well told me.  I noticed the other feller was a bit narked when he seen me  on the horse to-day.  He's got red o' Pilot.\"    \"Look here, Mosey,\" said Thompson slowly:  \"I'd rather--so help me God--  I'd rather cut my own throat than do a trick like that.  Are n't you frightened of bringing a curse on yourself?\"    \"I ain't (adj.) fool enough to believe in curses,\" replied Mosey--  his altered tone nevertheless belying his bravado.    \"Simply because you don't keep your eyes open,\" retorted Thompson.  \"Is n't it well known that a grog-seller's money never gets to his children?  Is n't it well known that if you mislead a woman, a curse'll follow you  like your shadow?  Isn't it well known that if you're disobedient  to your parents, something'll happen to you?  Is n't it well known  that Sabbath-breaking brings a curse on a man that he can't shake off  till he reforms?  Now you stole that horse in the dirtiest way;  and stealing--well, anything except grass or water--brings as heavy a curse  as anything you can do.  Mark my words.\"    \"The Jackdaw of Rheims is a case in point,\" remarked Willoughby aside to me.    \"Well,\" said Price emphatically, and qualifying every word  that would bear qualification, \"so fur as workin' on Sundays goes,  I'm well sure I allus worked on Sundays, an' I'm well sure I allus will;  an' I'm well sure 'ere ain't no cuss on me.  Why, I dunno  what the (complicated expletive) a cuss is! I'll get a blanket fer to lay on,\"  he added; \"this ground's sorter damp.\" And he went across to his wagon.    \"He's got a curse on him as big as Mount Macedon, and he does n't know it,\"  muttered Thompson.    \"Bearing out the prophecy,\" said I aside to Willoughby, \"that the sinner,  being a hundred years old, shall be accursed.\"    \"You ought to show him a bit more respect, Mosey,\" remarked Cooper gravely.    \"Well, to tell you the truth,\" replied Mosey frankly,  \"I got no patience with the ole bunyip.  Can't suffer fools, no road.\"    \"Well, I don't want to be shovin' in my jor, but I'd take him to be more rogue  than fool,\" suggested Bum.    \"Time he was thinkin' about repentin', anyhow,\" observed Dixon.    \"Now, really Thompson--do you believe in these special malisons?\"  asked Willoughby, as Price rejoined the company.  \"Are you so superstitious?  I should n't have thought it.\"    \"I've good reason to believe in them,\" replied Thompson.  \"You asked me  this morning why I did n't have two teams.  Now I'll tell you the reason.  It's because I'm not allowed to keep two teams.  I've got a curse on me.  Many a long year ago, when I finished my second season, I found myself  at Moama, with a hundred and ten notes to the good, and the prospect  of going straight ahead, like the cube root--or the square of the hypotenuse,  is it?  I forget the exact term, but no matter.  Well, the curse came on me  in this way:  Charley Webber, the young fellow I was travelling with,  got a letter from some relations in New Zealand, advising him to settle there;  so he offered me his plant for two-thirds of its value--fifty notes down  and fifty more when he would send for it.  Sheer good-nature of him,  for he knew he could have the lot if he liked.  But there's not many fellows  of Charley's stamp.  So I paid him the fifty notes and we parted.  He was to send me his address as soon as he reached New Zealand;  but he never got there.  The vessel was wrecked on some place they call  the North Spit; and Charley was one of the missing.  Never heard of him  from that day to this.\"    \"Good (ensanguined) shot!\" remarked Mosey.  \"I wish that same specie  of a curse would come on me.\"    \"My (ensanguined) colonial!\" assented Dixon and Bum, with one accord.    \"Well, nobody knows anything about the geography of New Zealand,\"  continued Thompson, \"and I purposely forgot the address of Charley's people.  Any honest man would have hunted them up, but that was n't my style;  I was n't a wheat-sample; I was a tare.  Compromised with my conscience.  Thought there was no time to lose in making an independence--making haste  to be rich, and considering not that's there's many a slip between the cup  and the lip, as Solomon puts it.  I said to myself, 'That's all right;  I'll pay it some time.' Now see the consequence----\"    \"Just two years after I bid the poor fellow good-bye-two years to the very day,  and not very lucky years neither--I found myself in the middle  of the Death Track, with flour for Wilcannia; one wagon left behind,  and the bullocks dropping off like fish out of water; bullocks worth ten notes  going as if they were n't worth half-a-crown.  It was like the retreat  from Moscow.  Finally, I lost fourteen on the trip--exactly the number  I had got dishonestly.  As for the second wagon, I gave it to Baxter  for fetching the load the last fifty mile.  I thought this might clear away  the curse, so I didn't fret over it.  I felt as if Charley  had got satisfaction.  But I wasn't going to get off so cheap.  Two years afterward--you remember, Dixon?--I bought that thin team  and the Melbourne wagon from Pribble, the contractor.  Dixon, here,  was driving for Pribble at that very time, and he can tell you  how Dick the Devil cleaned me out of my fine old picked team and the new wagon,  leaving me to begin afresh with the remains of Pribble's skeletons  and my own old wagon.  Then a year or two afterward, I went in debt  to buy that plant of Mulligan's--him that was killed off the colt at Mossgiel--  and that same winter the pleuro broke out in my lot, and they went  like rotten sheep till fourteen were gone; and then, of course,  the plague was stopped.  Not having any use for Mulligan's wagon,  I swapped her for a new thirty-by-twenty-four wool-rag, and a Wagga pot,  good for eight or ten mile on a still night; and, within a month,  Ramsay's punt went down with my wagon; she's in the bottom  of the Murrumbidgee now, with eight ton of bricks to steady her,  and the tarpaulin and bell to keep her company.  She'll be fetching  the most critical planks out of a steamer some of these times,  and I'll get seven years for leaving her there.  Afterward,  when I was hauling logs for pontooning, on the Goulburn, I kept  buying up steers and breaking them in, till I had two twelves; and one day  I left sixteen of them standing in yoke while I went looking round  for a good log; and suddenly I heard a crash that rattled back and forward  across the river for a quarter of an hour.  I had a presentiment  that Providence was on the job again, and I wasn't disappointed.  One of the fallers had left a tree nearly through when he went to dinner;  and a gust of wind sent it over, and it carried a couple of other trees  before it, right on the spot where my team was folded up in the shade.  Eight of them went that trip, between killed and crippled,  leaving me with sixteen.  My next piece of luck was to lose  that new Yankee wagon in the Eight-mile Mallee, on Birrawong.  Then I could see plain enough that Providence had taken up Charley's case,  and was prepared to block me of keeping two teams; so I determined  to have one good one.  Now, I've always stood pretty well with the agents  and squatters, and I know my way round Riverina, so I can turn over  as much money as any single-team man on the track, bar Warrigal Alf  (I beg your pardon, Cooper; I forgot)--but what's the use of money to me?  Only vanity and vexation of spirit, as Shakespear says.  I get up  to a certain point, and then I'm knocked stiff.  Mind, I've only given you  a small, insignificant sample of the misfortunes I've had since I cheated  that dead man; but if they don't prove there's a curse on me,  then there's no such thing as proof in this world.\"    Price cleared his throat.  \"Them misforcunes was invidiously owin'  to yer own (adj.) misjudgment,\" he said dogmatically.    \"Serve you right for not havin' better luck,\" added Dixon.    \"Learn you sense, anyhow,\" remarked Mosey.    \"Misforcunes does some people good,\" hazarded Bum.    \"Yes,\" replied Thompson gently.  \"I've had my turn.  I hope I take it  like a man.  Your turns will come sooner or later, as sure as you've got heads  on your bodies--perhaps next year; perhaps next week; perhaps to-morrow.  Let's see how you'll take it.  Mind, there's a curse on every one of us.  And look here--we had no business to travel to-day; there was a bite of feed  in the Patagonia Swamp, if it came to the worst.  Now we're in for it.  I've"]]]
