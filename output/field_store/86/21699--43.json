Objects seen by one and the same eye appear sometimes large, and  sometimes small.    28.    The motion of a spectator who sees an object at rest often makes it  seem as though the object at rest had acquired the motion of the  moving body, while the moving person appears to be at rest.    ON PAINTING.    Objects in relief, when seen from a short distance with one eye,  look like a perfect picture. If you look with the eye _a_, _b_ at  the spot _c_, this point _c_ will appear to be at _d_, _f_, and if  you look at it with the eye _g_, _h_ will appear to be at _m_. A  picture can never contain in itself both aspects.    29.    Let the object in relief _t_ be seen by both eyes; if you will look  at the object with the right eye _m_, keeping the left eye _n_ shut,  the object will appear, or fill up the space, at _a_; and if you  shut the right eye and open the left, the object (will occupy the)  space _b_; and if you open both eyes, the object will no longer  appear at _a_ or _b_, but at _e_, _r_, _f_. Why will not a picture  seen by both eyes produce the effect of relief, as [real] relief  does when seen by both eyes; and why should a picture seen with one  eye give the same effect of relief as real relief would under the  same conditions of light and shade?    [Footnote: In the sketch, _m_ is the left eye and _n_ the right,  while the text reverses this lettering. We must therefore suppose  that the face in which the eyes _m_ and _n_ are placed is opposite  to the spectator.]    30.    The comparative size of the image depends on the amount of light  (30-39).    The eye will hold and retain in itself the image of a luminous body  better than that of a shaded object. The reason is that the eye is  in itself perfectly dark and since two things that are alike cannot  be distinguished, therefore the night, and other dark objects cannot  be seen or recognised by the eye. Light is totally contrary and  gives more distinctness, and counteracts and differs from the usual  darkness of the eye, hence it leaves the impression of its image.    31.    Every object we see will appear larger at midnight than at midday,  and larger in the morning than at midday.    This happens because the pupil of the eye is much smaller at midday  than at any other time.    32.    The pupil which is largest will see objects the largest. This is  evident when we look at luminous bodies, and particularly at those  in the sky. When the eye comes out of darkness and suddenly looks up  at these bodies, they at first appear larger and then diminish; and  if you were to look at those bodies through a small opening, you  would see them smaller still, because a smaller part of the pupil  would exercise its function.    [Footnote: 9. _buso_ in the Lomb. dialect is the same as _buco_.]    33.    When the eye, coming out of darkness suddenly sees a luminous body,  it will appear much larger at first sight than after long looking at  it. The illuminated object will look larger and more brilliant, when  seen with two eyes than with only one. A luminous object will appear  smaller in size, when the eye sees it through a smaller opening. A  luminous body of an oval form will appear rounder in proportion as  it is farther from the eye.    34.    Why when the eye has just seen the light, does the half light look  dark to it, and in the same way if it turns from the darkness the  half light look very bright?    35.    ON PAINTING.    If the eye, when [out of doors] in the luminous atmosphere, sees a  place in shadow, this will look very much darker than it really is.  This happens only because the eye when out in the air contracts the  pupil in proportion as the atmosphere reflected in it is more  luminous. And the more the pupil contracts, the less luminous do the  objects appear that it sees. But as soon as the eye enters into a  shady place the darkness of the shadow suddenly seems to diminish.  This occurs because the greater the darkness into which the pupil  goes the more its size increases, and this increase makes the  darkness seem less.    [Footnote 14: _La luce entrerà_. _Luce_ occurs here in the sense of  pupil of the eye as in no 51: C. A. 84b; 245a; I--5; and in many  other places.]    36.    ON PERSPECTIVE.    The eye which turns from a white object in the light of the sun and  goes into a less fully lighted place will see everything as dark.  And this happens either because the pupils of the eyes which have  rested on this brilliantly lighted white object have contracted so  much that, given at first a certain extent of surface, they will  have lost more than 3/4 of their size; and, lacking in size, they  are also deficient in [seeing] power. Though you might say to me: A  little bird (then) coming down would see comparatively little, and  from the smallness of his pupils the white might seem black! To this  I should reply that here we must have regard to the proportion of  the mass of that portion of the brain which is given up to the sense  of sight and to nothing else. Or--to return--this pupil in Man  dilates and contracts according to the brightness or darkness of  (surrounding) objects; and since it takes some time to dilate and  contract, it cannot see immediately on going out of the light and  into the shade, nor, in the same way, out of the shade into the  light, and this very thing has already deceived me in painting an  eye, and from that I learnt it.    37.    Experiment [showing] the dilatation and contraction of the pupil,  from the motion of the sun and other luminaries. In proportion as  the sky is darker the stars appear of larger size, and if you were  to light up the medium these stars would look smaller; and this  difference arises solely from the pupil which dilates and contracts  with the amount of light in the medium which is interposed between  the eye and the luminous body. Let the experiment be made, by  placing a candle above your head at the same time that you look at a  star; then gradually lower the candle till it is on a level with the  ray that comes from the star to the eye, and then you will see the  star diminish so much that you will almost lose sight of it.    [Footnote: No reference is made in the text to the letters on the  accompanying diagram.]    38.    The pupil of the eye, in the open air, changes in size with every  degree of motion from the sun; and at every degree of its changes  one and the same object seen by it will appear of a different size;  although most frequently the relative scale of surrounding objects  does not allow us to detect these variations in any single object we  may look at.    39.    The eye--which sees all objects reversed--retains the images for  some time. This conclusion is proved by the results; because, the  eye having gazed at light retains some impression of it. After  looking (at it) there remain in the eye images of intense  brightness, that make any less brilliant spot seem dark until the  eye has lost the last trace of the impression of the stronger light.    _II.    Linear Perspective.    We see clearly from the concluding sentence of section 49, where the  author directly addresses the painter, that he must certainly have  intended to include the elements of mathematics in his Book on the  art of Painting. They are therefore here placed at the beginning. In  section 50 the theory of the \"Pyramid of Sight\" is distinctly and  expressly put forward as the fundamental principle of linear  perspective, and sections 52 to 57 treat of it fully. This theory of  sight can scarcely be traced to any author of antiquity. Such  passages as occur in Euclid for instance, may, it is true, have  proved suggestive to the painters of the Renaissance, but it would  be rash to say any thing decisive on this point.    Leon Battista Alberti treats of the \"Pyramid of Sight\" at some  length in his first Book of Painting; but his explanation differs  widely from Leonardo's in the details. Leonardo, like Alberti, may  have borrowed the broad lines of his theory from some views commonly  accepted among painters at the time; but he certainly worked out its  application in a perfectly original manner.    The axioms as to the perception of the pyramid of rays are followed  by explanations of its origin, and proofs of its universal  application (58--69). The author recurs to the subject with endless  variations; it is evidently of fundamental importance in his  artistic theory and practice. It is unnecessary to discuss how far  this theory has any scientific value at the present day; so much as  this, at any rate, seems certain: that from the artist's point of  view it may still claim to be of immense practical utility.    According to Leonardo, on one hand, the laws of perspective are an  inalienable condition of the existence of objects in space; on the  other hand, by a natural law, the eye, whatever it sees and wherever  it turns, is subjected to the perception of the pyramid of rays in  the form of a minute target. Thus it sees objects in perspective  independently of the will of the spectator, since the eye receives  the images by means of the pyramid of rays \"just as a magnet  attracts iron\".    In connection with this we have the function of the eye explained by  the Camera obscura, and this is all the more interesting and  important because no writer previous to Leonardo had treated of this  subject_ (70--73). _Subsequent passages, of no less special interest,  betray his knowledge of refraction and of the inversion of the image  in the camera and in the eye_ (74--82).    _From the principle of the transmission of the image to the eye and  to the camera obscura he deduces the means of producing an  artificial construction of the pyramid of rays or--which is the same  thing--of the image. The fundamental axioms as to the angle of sight  and the vanishing point are thus presented in a manner"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50133"],[0,"The Dunwich Horror (#6)"],[1,"ther.      7    Yet all this was only the prologue of the actual Dunwich horror.  Formalities were gone through by bewildered officials, abnormal details  were duly kept from press and public, and men were sent to Dunwich  and Aylesbury to look up property and notify any who might be heirs  of the late Wilbur Whateley. They found the countryside in great  agitation, both because of the growing rumblings beneath the domed  hills, and because of the unwonted stench and the surging, lapping  sounds which came increasingly from the great empty shell formed by  Whateley's boarded-up farmhouse. Earl Sawyer, who tended the horse and  cattle during Wilbur's absence, had developed a wofully acute case  of nerves. The officials devised excuses not to enter the noisome  boarded place; and were glad to confine their survey of the deceased's  living quarters, the newly mended sheds, to a single visit. They filed  a ponderous report at the court-house in Aylesbury, and litigations  concerning heirship are said to be still in progress amongst the  innumerable Whateleys, decayed and undecayed, of the upper Miskatonic  valley.    An almost interminable manuscript in strange characters, written in a  huge ledger and adjudged a sort of diary because of the spacing and  the variations in ink and penmanship, presented a baffling puzzle to  those who found it on the old bureau which served as its owner's  desk. After a week of debate it was sent to Miskatonic University,  together with the deceased's collection of strange books, for study  and possible translation; but even the best linguists soon saw that it  was not likely to be unriddled with ease. No trace of the ancient gold  with which Wilbur and Old Whateley always paid their debts has yet been  discovered.    It was in the dark of September ninth that the horror broke loose.  The hill noises had been very pronounced during the evening, and dogs  barked frantically all night. Early risers on the tenth noticed a  peculiar stench in the air. About 7 o'clock Luther Brown, the hired boy  at George Corey's, between Cold Spring Glen and the village, rushed  frenziedly back from his morning trip to Ten-Acre Meadow with the cows.  He was almost convulsed with fright as he stumbled into the kitchen;  and in the yard outside the no less frightened herd were pawing and  lowing pitifully, having followed the boy back in the panic they shared  with him. Between gasps Luther tried to stammer out his tale to Mrs.  Corey.    \"Up thar in the rud beyont the glen, Mis' Corey--they's suthin' ben  thar! It smells like thunder, an' all the bushes an' little trees is  pushed back from the rud like they'd a haouse ben moved along of it.  An' that ain't the wust, nuther. They's _prints_ in the rud, Mis'  Corey--great raound prints as big as barrel-heads, all sunk daown deep  like a elephant had ben along, _only they's a sight more nor four feet  could make_. I looked at one or two afore I run, an' I see every one  was covered with lines spreadin' aout from one place, like as if big  palm-leaf fans--twict or three times as big as any they is--hed of ben  paounded daown into the rud. An' the smell was awful, like what it is  araound Wizard Whateley's ol' haouse....\"    Here he faltered, and seemed to shiver afresh with the fright that had  sent him flying home. Mrs. Corey, unable to extract more information,  began telephoning the neighbors; thus starting on its rounds the  overture of panic that heralded the major terrors. When she got Sally  Sawyer, housekeeper at Seth Bishop's, the nearest place to Whateley's,  it became her turn to listen instead of transmit; for Sally's boy  Chauncey, who slept poorly, had been up on the hill toward Whateley's,  and had dashed back in terror after one look at the place, and at the  pasturage where Mr. Bishop's cows had been left out all night.    \"Yes, Mis' Corey,\" came Sally's tremulous voice over the party wire,  \"Cha'ncey he just come back a-post-in', and couldn't haff talk fer  bein' scairt! He says Ol' Whateley's haouse is all blowed up, with  the timbers scattered raound like they'd ben dynamite inside; only  the bottom floor ain't through, but is all covered with a kind o'  tarlike stuff that smells awful an' drips daown offen the aidges onto  the graoun' whar the side timbers is blowed away. An' they's awful  kinder marks in the yard, tew--great raound marks bigger raound than a  hogshead, an' all sticky with stuff like is on the blowed-up haouse.  Cha'ncey he says they leads off into the medders, whar a great swath  wider'n a barn is matted daown, an' all the stun walls tumbled every  which way wherever it goes.    \"An' he says, says he, Mis' Corey, as haow he sot to look fer Seth's  caows, frighted ez he was; an' faound 'em in the upper pasture nigh the  Devil's Hop Yard in an awful shape. Haff on 'em's clean gone, an' nigh  haff o' them that's left is sucked most dry o' blood, with sores on 'em  like they's ben on Whateley's cattle ever senct Lavinny's black brat  was born. Seth he's gone aout naow to look at 'em, though I'll vaow he  wun't keer ter git very nigh Wizard Whateley's! Cha'ncey didn't look  keerful ter see whar the big matted-daown swath led arter it leff the  pasturage, but he says he thinks it p'inted towards the glen rud to the  village.    \"I tell ye, Mis' Corey, they's suthin' abroad as hadn't orter be  abroad, an' I fer one think that black Wilbur Whateley, as come to  the bad eend he desarved, is at the bottom of the breedin' of it. He  wa'n't all human hisself, I allus says to everybody; an' I think he an'  Ol' Whateley must a raised suthin' in that there nailed-up haouse as  ain't even so human as he was. They's allus ben unseen things araound  Dunwich--livin' things--as ain't human an' ain't good fer human folks.    \"The graoun' was a'talkin' lass night, an' towards mornin' Cha'ncey  he heerd the whippoorwills so laoud in Col' Spring Glen he couldn't  sleep none. Then he thought he heerd another faintlike saound over  towards Wizard Whateley's--a kinder rippin' or tearin' o' wood, like  some big box or crate was bein' opened fur off. What with this an'  that, he didn't git to sleep at all till sunup, an' no sooner was he  up this mornin', but he's got to go over to Whateley's an' see what's  the matter. He see enough, I tell ye, Mis' Corey! This dun't mean no  good, an' I think as all the men-folks ought to git up a party an'  do suthin'. I know suthin' awful's abaout, an' feel my time is nigh,  though only Gawd knows jest what it is.    \"Did your Luther take accaount o' whar them big tracks led tew? No?  Wal, Mis' Corey, ef they was on the glen rud this side o' the glen,  an' ain't got to your haouse yet, I calc'late they must go into the  glen itself. They would do that. I allus says Col' Spring Glen ain't no  healthy nor decent place. The whippoorwills an' fireflies there never  did act like they was creaters o' Gawd, an' they's them as says ye kin  hear strange things a-rushin' an' a-talkin' in the air daown thar ef ye  stand in the right place, atween the rock falls an' Bear's Den.\"           *       *       *       *       *    By that noon fully three-quarters of the men and boys of Dunwich were  trooping over the roads and meadows between the new-made Whateley ruins  and Cold Spring Glen; examining in horror the vast, monstrous prints,  the maimed Bishop cattle, the strange, noisome wreck of the farmhouse,  and the bruised, matted vegetation of the fields and road-sides.  Whatever had burst loose upon the world had assuredly gone down into  the great sinister ravine; for all the trees on the banks were bent and  broken, and a great avenue had been gouged in the precipice-hanging  underbrush. It was as though a house, launched by an avalanche, had  slid down through the tangled growths of the almost vertical slope.  From below no sound came, but only a distant, undefinable fetor; and  it is not to be wondered at that the men preferred to stay on the edge  and argue, rather than descend and beard the unknown Cyclopean horror  in its lair. Three dogs that were with the party had barked furiously  at first, but seemed cowed and reluctant when near the glen. Someone  telephoned the news to the _Aylesbury Transcript_; but the editor,  accustomed to wild tales from Dunwich, did no more than concoct a  humorous paragraph about it; an item soon afterward reproduced by the  Associated Press.    That night everyone went home, and every house and barn was barricaded  as stoutly as possible. Needless to say, no cattle were allowed to  remain in open pasturage. About 2 in the morning a frightful stench and  the savage barking of the dogs awakened the household at Elmer Frye's,  on the eastern edge of Cold Spring Glen, and all agreed that they  could hear a sort of muffled swishing or lapping sound from somewhere  outside. Mrs. Frye proposed telephoning the neighbors, and Elmer was  about to agree when the noise of splintering wood burst in upon their  deliberations. It came, apparently, from the barn; and was quickly  followed by a hideous screaming and stamping amongst the cattle. The  dogs slavered and crouched close to the feet of the fear-numbed family.  Frye lit a lantern through force of habit, but knew it would be death  to go out into that black farmyard. The children and the women-folk  whimpered, kept from screaming by some obscure, vestigial instinct  of defense which told them their lives depended on silence. At last  the noise of the cattle subsided to a pitiful moaning, and a great  snapping, crashing, and crackling ensued. The Fryes, huddled together  in the sitting-room, did not dare to move until the last echoes died  away far down in Cold Spring Glen. Then, amidst the dismal moans from  the stable and the demoniac piping of late whippoorwills in the glen,  Selina Frye tottered to the telephone and spread what news she could of  the second phase of the horror.    The next day all the countryside was in a panic; and"]]]
