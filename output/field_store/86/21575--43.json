[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38032"],[0,"Game Birds and Game Fishes of the Pacific Coast (#6)"],[1,")]      THE MONGOLIAN PHEASANT    (Phasianus torquatus)    While the wild turkey is the only representative of the =Phasianidae=  found native to the American continent, the Mongolian pheasant has  been so successfully acclimatized in Oregon and Washington that it  must now be recognized as an established resident species.    After it became an established fact that these pheasants were proving  a success in Oregon, there became a demand for their introduction into  California, and thousands of dollars were spent for a number of years  in an unsuccessful effort to acclimatize them. The pheasant, like the  grouse, is a cold country bird, and the mild and dry climate of  California does not appeal to their peculiar tastes or the  requirements of their physical being. Oregon, however, possesses the  climatic, floral and entomic conditions for which nature has fitted  them. Green vegetation lasts during the whole season in which they  rear their young, thus furnishing them with that abundance of insects  necessary to the health and nourishment of the young chicks. They are  endowed with certain physical attributes for which the cold of winter  is necessary to preserve a continued healthful condition, and this,  too, they find in Oregon. In fact this constitutional demand for the  cold of winter has been by nature so strongly implanted within them  that the rearing of thirty generations in the comparatively mild  climate of Oregon has not effaced it, and obeying this primal instinct  they have migrated through Washington and into the better-loved and  colder winters of British Columbia.    Therefore, while California undoubtedly may have an abundance of wild  turkeys, quail in unlimited numbers and of two or three more species  than we have at present, the timber and the plain tinamus of South  America, and possibly the sand grouse of southern Europe, she will  never have pheasants unless they be of the extreme southern varieties,  and never have more than a limited supply of grouse.    North of the mountains of southern Oregon and through Washington into  British Columbia pheasants are plentiful and furnish the principal  sport of the lovers of upland shooting of that section of the Pacific  Coast. The Mongolian pheasant as a game bird has his merits and  demerits. As a large, beautiful plumaged bird to grace the game bag  the pheasant stands without a rival. As a table bird the pheasant is  only surpassed in delicacy of flavor by the wild turkey. As an  aggravating runner from the dog the pheasant is in a class by itself,  and as an evader of all pursuit when wounded, \"the Chinaman,\" as they  are generally called in Oregon, can give odds to the gambel quail.  Though the pheasant is a large bird and able to carry off a good deal  of shot, it starts so slow to one accustomed to the rapid flight of  the California quail that a reasonably fair shot will find no  difficulty in getting the limit with a sixteen gauge.    They are slow starters, caused by their habit of rising at an angle of  forty-five to fifty degrees until they reach a height of about ten  feet before their rapid flight begins, but when once on the wing they  are quite swift flyers.    While I have said that the pheasants are aggravating runners, this is  principally so in the latter part of the season. In the earlier parts  they are commonly found in the stubble fields, potato and other  vegetable patches, and usually in single broods. At such times I have  found them to lie quite well to the dog, not flushing until closely  approached, and running but little except when winged. They are then  easy shooting, but the fine size of the bird and the beautiful plumage  of the cocks give a zest to the sport and a pleasant distinctiveness  which every sportsman will be pleased to add to the list of upland  shooting he has engaged in.    To those who wish to spend a season on these handsome birds, Oregon,  especially, offers an attraction which goes far beyond its good supply  of pheasants. During the open pheasant season the climate of Oregon is  as near perfect as one can ask. That season of the eastern states that  has been idealized in verse, and is known as Indian summer, finds its  superlative in the early fall of Oregon. The sun shines brightly, but  with its rays softened by its sub-equinoctial position; the air is  mild, clear and invigorating, and the golden hues of the stubble  field, the yet bright green of the grassy pastures, the rich tints of  the dying autumn leaves, all framed in the blue-green fringe of the  near-by pines and firs, produce a picture strikingly beautiful and  always enjoyed. It is in this delightful season with such a picture on  every side, heightened by an occasional glimpse of some towering  mountain peak with its crown of eternal snows, that the sportsman of  Oregon lays aside the cares of life and lives in an elysium during his  pheasant-shooting days. The setting of the stage is as much to the  play as the acting. So with our days after game. The invigorating air  we breathe, the beauty of the landscape, the stateliness of the  forest, the rugged grandeur of the mountains, the soul-inspiring  picture of our dogs on point and back, lends more to the real  enjoyment of the day than does the size of the bag we carry home.    =Color=--Male--The male of the Mongolian pheasant can not be  confounded with any other game bird in America. Its very long tail  feathers--from fifteen to twenty inches--will always prove a  distinguishing mark. Its rich metallic colors of black, cinnamon,  chestnut and ocher give it a combination of hues surpassing that of  any other of our game birds.    Female--Nor should the female ever be mistaken for any other bird. It  partakes much of the general colors of the male, but much subdued and  more of a general ochreous hue, the plumage being buff mottled with  brown. The tail, however, is not more than one-fourth the length of  that of the male.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest is generally a depression on the ground, but  often in the hollow of some log. The eggs number from 12 to 18 and are  of a dark ochre in color.    =Measurements=--The measurements of a Mongolian pheasant are  practically useless on account of the larger portion of it being the  tail, which greatly varies in length.          THE PIGEONS AND DOVES      The family =Columbidae= is represented on the Pacific Coast by three  genera which are considered, to more or less extent, legitimate game,  though they can not be termed game birds in the generally accepted use  of the term. Still as they are hunted to a very considerable extent by  the sportsmen of the Coast, they rightfully belong in a work of this  kind. I shall, therefore, give them a place, and briefly treat each  species that is pursued as game within the territory under  consideration.        [Illustration:      MOURNING DOVE         BANDED PIGEON      WHITE-WINGED DOVE      (Zenaidura macroura)  (Columba faciata)  (Melopelia leucoptera)]      THE WILD PIGEON    (Columba faciata)    The wild, or banded pigeon, is a mountain dweller, found principally  in the southern half of the territory covered by this work. They visit  the valleys in the fall and winter months to feed on the oak mast, and  at such times they are seen in large flocks in the Sacramento, San  Joaquin and coast valleys of California. They are found in good  numbers in parts of Arizona, and are common along both sides of the  Sierra Madres of Mexico. When visiting the valleys they afford good  sport, as they are swift flyers and capable of carrying off a good  deal of shot. They have no migrations like the passenger pigeon once  so plentiful in the eastern states, nor do they congregate in such  immense flocks.    =Color=--About the same as the darker colored tame pigeon; the tail is  a trifle longer than the tame bird and a little lighter than the rest  of the plumage with a dark band across the middle of it; a small patch  of white feathers at the back of the head. Both sexes are alike.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest is built in the trees of small twigs and  grass. Two eggs are layed at a time, and a pair of young birds are  produced about every six weeks from April to August.    =Measurements=--A trifle more than the tame pigeon.      THE MOURNING DOVE    (Zenaidura macroura)    The mourning dove is a cosmopolitan species found in greater or less  numbers in all sections. They have a slight migratory movement from  the higher to the lower altitudes, but they cannot be called a  migratory bird. A large number of these birds begin their nesting  season in the mountains at altitudes of from 2000 to 4000 feet,  raising one brood at that height, then moving down and nesting again,  and moving again until they reach the lower valleys, where they remain  all winter, congregating in certain places in flocks of hundreds.  Many, however, remain in the valleys all the year and nest around the  fields and along the streams.    The mourning dove is so well known in every country that a description  of it is unnecessary.    =Nest and Eggs=--The nest is generally built in the small trees and  lined with any soft article that they can find. The eggs number two  and a pair of the young birds are hatched about every six weeks from  May to September.      THE WHITE-WINGED DOVE    (Melopelia leucoptera)    The white-winged dove is nearly one-half larger than the common  mourning dove. They range from Mexico through southern Arizona to the  Colorado desert in southeastern California. In some parts of Arizona  and in Mexico they are found in large numbers, and afford good  shooting. Their habits are the same as the common dove, both as to  food and nesting, though in parts of Mexico it nests in the pitahaya  plants--a species of cactus--of whose fruit it is very fond.    This species can easily be distinguished from any other member of the  dove family by the broad patch of white on the wings.
