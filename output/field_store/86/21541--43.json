The African feeds upon foliage and the succulent  roots of the mimosa and other trees, which it digs up with its powerful  tusks; the forests are generally evergreen, and being full of sap, the  bark is easier to masticate than the skeleton trees of India during the  hottest season. Both the Indian and African varieties have only four  teeth, composed of laminae of intensely hard enamel, divided by a softer  substance which prevents the surface from becoming smooth with age; the  two unequal materials retain their inequality in wear, therefore the  rough grinding surface is maintained notwithstanding the work of many  years. A gland at the posterior of the jaw supplies a tooth-forming  matter, and the growth of fresh laminae is continuous throughout life;  the younger laminae form into line, and march forward until incorporated  and solidified in the tooth.    It is impossible to define exactly the limit of old age, as there can be  little doubt that captivity shortens the duration of life to a great  degree. We can only form an opinion from the basis of growth when young.  As an elephant cannot be fully developed in the perfection of ivory  until the age of forty, I should accept that age in a wild animal as the  period of a starting-point in life, and I should imagine that the term  of existence would be about a hundred and fifty years.    The life of an elephant in captivity is exactly opposed to its natural  habits. A wild Indian elephant dreads the sun, and is seldom to be found  exposed in the open after dawn of day. It roams over the country in all  directions during night, and seeks the shelter of a forest about an hour  before the sun rises. It feeds heartily, but wastefully, tearing down  branches, half of which it leaves untouched; it strips the bark off  those trees which it selects as tasteful, but throws wilfully away a  considerable portion. Throughout the entire night the elephant is  feeding, and it is curious to observe how particular this animal is in  the choice of food. Most wild animals possess a certain amount of  botanical knowledge which guides them in their grazing; the only  exception is the camel, who would poison himself through sheer ignorance  and depraved appetite, but the elephant is most careful in its selection  of all that is suitable to its requirements. It is astonishing how few  of the forest trees are attractive to this animal. Some are tempting  from their foliage, others from their bark (vide the powerfully  astringent Catechu), some from the succulent roots, and several  varieties from the wood, which is eaten like the sugar-cane. There is  one kind of tree the wood of which alone is eaten after the rind has  been carefully stripped off.    The elephant, being in its wild state a nocturnal animal, must be able  to distinguish the various qualities of trees by the senses of smell and  touch, as in the darkness of a forest during night it would be  impossible to distinguish the leaves. There are few creatures who  possess so delicate a sense of smell; wild elephants will wind an enemy  at a distance of a thousand yards, or even more, should the breeze be  favourable. The nerves of the trunk are peculiarly sensitive, and  although the skin is thick, the smallest substance can be discovered,  and picked up by the tiny proboscis at the extremity.    A wound upon any portion of the trunk must occasion intense pain, and  the animal instinctively coils the lower portion beneath its chest when  attacked by a tiger. This delicacy of nerve renders the elephant  exceedingly timid after being wounded, and it is a common and  regrettable occurrence that an elephant which has been an excellent  shikar animal before it has been injured, becomes useless to face a  tiger after it has been badly clawed. I cannot understand the  carelessness of an owner who thus permits a good elephant to work  unprotected. In ancient days the elephants were armoured for warlike  purposes to protect them from spears and javelins, and nothing can be  easier than to arrange an elastic protective hood, which would  effectually safeguard the trunk and head from the attack of any animal.    I had an excellent hood arranged for a large tusker which was lent to me  by the Commissariat. The first layer of material was the soft but thick  buff leather of sambur deer. This entirely covered the head, and was  laced beneath the throat; at the same time it was secured by a broad  leather strap and buckle around the neck. A covering for about three  feet from the base of the trunk descended from the face and was also  secured by lacing. The lower portion of the trunk was left unprotected,  as the animal would immediately guard against danger by curling it up  when attacked. Upon this groundwork of buff leather I had plates of  thick and hard buffalo hide, tanned, overlapping like slates upon a  roof. This armour was proof against either teeth or claws, as neither  could hold upon the slippery and yielding hard surface of the leather  tiles; at the same time the elephant could move its trunk with ease. Two  circular apertures were cut out for the eyes, about six inches in  diameter.    An elephant, if well trained, would be sufficiently sagacious to  appreciate this protection should it find itself unharmed after a home  charge by a tiger or other dangerous beast; and such a quality of armour  would add immensely to its confidence and steadiness.    Although the elephant is of enormous strength it is more or less a  delicate animal, and is subject to a variety of ailments. A common  disease is a swelling in the throat, which in bad cases prevents it from  feeding. Another complaint resembles gout in the legs, which swell to a  distressing size, and give exquisite pain, especially when touched. This  attack is frequently occasioned by allowing elephants, after a long  march under a hot sun, to wade belly-deep in cool water in order to  graze upon the aquatic vegetation.    Few animals suffer more from the sun's rays than the elephant, whose  nature prompts it to seek the deepest shade. Its dark colour and immense  surface attract an amount of heat which becomes almost insupportable to  the unfortunate creature when forced to carry a heavy load during the  hot season in India. Even without a greater weight than its rider, the  elephant exhibits signs of distress when marching after 9 a.m. At such  times it is disagreeable, as the animal has a peculiar habit of sucking  water through the trunk from a supply contained within the stomach, and  this it syringes with great force between its fore legs, and against its  flanks to cool its sides with the ejected spray. The rider receives a  portion of the fluid in his face, and as the action is repeated every  five minutes, or less, the operation is annoying.    It is a curious peculiarity in the elephant that it is enabled to suck  up water at discretion simply by doubling the trunk far down the throat,  and the fluid thus procured has no disagreeable smell, although taken  direct from the creature's stomach. In every way the elephant is  superior to most animals in the freedom from any unpleasant odour. Its  skin is sweet, and the hand retains no smell whatever, although you may  have caressed the trunk or any other portion of the body. It is well  known that a horse is exceedingly strong in odour, and that nothing is  more objectionable than the close proximity of a stable, or even of a  large number of horses picqueted in the open,--I have frequently been  camped where fifty or sixty elephants were for several days in the same  position within a hundred yards of the tents, and still there was no  offensive scent.    The food of an elephant is always fresh and clean, and the digestive  functions are extremely rapid. The mastication is a rough system of  grinding, and the single stomach and exceedingly short intestines  simplify the process of assimilation. The rapidity of the food passage  necessitates a consumption of a large amount, and no less than six  hundred pounds of fodder is the proper daily allowance for an elephant.    There have been frequent discussions upon the important subject of  elephant-feeding. Mr. G. P. Sanderson, the superintendent of the keddah  department in Assam, has declared against the necessity of allowing a  ration of grain in addition to the usual fodder. This must naturally  depend upon the quality of the green food. If the locality abounds in  plantains, the stems of those plants are eagerly devoured, and every  portion except the outside rind is nourishing. Even then the waste is  excessive should the stems be heedlessly thrown down before the animal.  It will immediately proceed to strip long fibrous ribbons from the stem  by placing one foot upon the extremity, and then tearing off the  alternate layers like the skin of an onion. These it converts into  playthings, throwing them over its back and neck until it is dressed in  dangling necklaces, which by degrees, after serving as toys, are  ultimately devoured. The proper method of feeding an elephant with  plantains where an allowance of rice is added, is by splitting the  entire stem through the centre, and then cutting it into transverse  sections about two feet in length. As each layer is detached, it  resembles a delicately coloured trough, nearly white; this is doubled up  in the centre and it at once forms a hollow tube, similar to a very  thick drain tile. A handful of rice is placed within, and it is secured  by tying with a fibrous strip from the plantain stem. A large pile of  these neat packages is prepared for every elephant, and, when ready, the  mahout sits by the heap and hands the parcels one by one to the  ever-expectant trunk.    The delicacy of an elephant's palate is extraordinary, and the whims of  the creature are absurd in the selection or rejection of morsels which  it prefers or dislikes.
