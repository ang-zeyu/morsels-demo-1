The ridges of this group of mountains  start from a common centre, take opposite directions, and form the  valleys whence flow, to the north, the Allier and the Loire; to the  west, the Dordogne, the Lot, the Aveyron, and the Tarn; to the south,  the Ardeche, the Gard, and the Herault.    The valleys, watered by navigable rivers, presented--thanks to the  fruitfulness of their soil and to their easy access--natural ways of  communication, favourable both to commerce and to war. To the north, the  valley of the Meuse; to the east, the valley of the Rhine, conducting to  that of the Saone, and thence to that of the Rhone, were the grand  routes which armies followed to invade the south. Strabo, therefore,  remarks justly that Sequania (_Franche-Comte_) has always been the road  of the Germanic invasions from Gaul into Italy.[42] From east to west  the principal chain of the watershed might easily be crossed in its less  elevated parts, such as the plateau of Langres and the mountains of  Charolais, which have since furnished a passage to the Central Canal.  Lastly, to penetrate from Italy into Gaul, the great lines of invasion  were the valley of the Rhone and the valley of the Garonne, by which the  mountainous mass of the Cevennes, Auvergne, and Forez is turned.    Gaul presented the same contrast of climates which we observe between  the north and south of France. While the Roman province enjoyed a mild  temperature and an extreme fertility,[43] the central and northern part  was covered with vast forests, which rendered the climate colder than it  is at present;[44] yet the centre produced in abundance wheat, rye,  millet, and barley.[45] The greatest of all these forests was that of  the Ardennes. It extended, beginning from the Rhine, over a space of two  hundred miles, on one side to the frontier of the Remi, crossing the  country of the Treviri; and, on another side, to the Scheldt, across the  country of the Nervii.[46] The \"Commentaries\" speak also of forests  existing among the Carnutes,[47] in the neighbourhood of the Saone,[48]  among the Menapii[49] and the Morini,[50] and among the Eburones.[51] In  the north the breeding of cattle was the principal occupation,[52] and  the pastures of Belgic Gaul produced a race of excellent horses.[53] In  the centre and in the south the richness of the soil was augmented by  productive mines of gold, silver, copper, iron, and lead.[54]    The country was, without any doubt, intersected by carriage roads, since  the Gauls possessed a great number of all sorts of wagons,[55] since  there still remain traces of Celtic roads, and since Caesar makes known  the existence of bridges on the Aisne,[56] the Rhone,[57] the Loire,[58]  the Allier,[59] and the Seine.[60]    It is difficult to ascertain exactly the number of the population; yet  we may presume, from the contingents furnished by the different states,  that it amounted to more than seven millions of souls.[61]      [Sidenote: Political Divisions.]    II. Gaul, according to Caesar, was divided into three great regions,  distinct by language, manners, and laws: to the north, Belgic Gaul,  between the Seine, the Marne, and the Rhine; in the centre, Celtic Gaul,  between the Garonne and the Seine, extending from the ocean to the Alps,  and comprising Helvetia; to the south, Aquitaine, between the Garonne  and the Pyrenees.[62] (_See Plate 2._) We must, nevertheless, comprise  in Gaul the Roman province, or the Narbonnese, which began at Geneva, on  the left bank of the Rhone, and extended in the south as far as  Toulouse. It answered, as nearly as possible, to the limits of the  countries known in modern times as Savoy, Dauphine, Provence, Lower  Languedoc, and Roussillon. The populations who inhabited it were of  different origins: there were found there Aquitanians, Belgae, Ligures,  Celts, who had all long undergone the influence of Greek civilisation,  and especially establishments founded by the Phocaeans on the coasts of  the Mediterranean.[63]    These three great regions were subdivided into many states, called  _civitates_--an expression which, in the \"Commentaries,\" is synonymous  with _nations_[64]--that is, each of these states had its organisation  and its own government. Among the peoples mentioned by Caesar, we may  reckon twenty-seven in Belgic Gaul, forty-three in Celtic, and twelve in  Aquitaine: in all, eighty-two in Gaul proper, and seven in the  Narbonnese. Other authors, admitting, no doubt, smaller subdivisions,  carry this number to three or four hundred;[65] but it appears that  under Tiberius there were only sixty-four states in Gaul.[66] Perhaps,  in this number, they reckoned only the sovereign, and not the dependent,  states.    1. _Belgic Gaul._ The Belgae were considered more warlike than the other  Gauls,[67] because, strangers to the civilisation of the Roman province  and hostile to commerce, they had not experienced the effeminating  influence of luxury. Proud of having escaped the Gaulish enervation,  they claimed with arrogance an origin which united them with the Germans  their neighbours, with whom, nevertheless, they were continually at  war.[68] They boasted of having defended their territory against the  Cimbri and the Teutones, at the time of the invasion of Gaul. The memory  of the lofty deeds of their ancestors inspired them with a great  confidence in themselves, and excited their warlike spirit.[69]    The most powerful nations among the Belgae were the Bellovaci,[70] who  could arm a hundred thousand men, and whose territory extended to the  sea,[71] the Nervii, the Remi, and the Treviri.    2. _Celtic Gaul._[72] The central part of Gaul, designated by the Greek  writers under the name of _Celtica_, and the inhabitants of which  constituted in the eyes of the Romans the Gauls properly so named  (_Galli_), was the most extensive and most populous. Among the most  important nations of Celtic Gaul were reckoned the Arverni, the AEdui,  the Sequani, and the Helvetii. Tacitus informs us that the Helvetii had  once occupied a part of Germany.[73]    These three first peoples often disputed the supremacy of Gaul. As to  the Helvetii, proud of their independence, they acknowledged no  authority superior to their own. In the centre and south of Celtic Gaul  dwelt peoples who had also a certain importance. On the west and  north-west were various maritime populations designated under the  generic name of _Armoricans_, an epithet which had, in the Celtic  tongue, the meaning of maritime. Small Alpine tribes inhabited the  valleys of the upper course of the Rhone, at the eastern extremity of  Lake Lemon, a country which now forms the Valais.    3. _Aquitaine._[74] Aquitaine commenced on the left bank of the  Garonne: it was inhabited by several small tribes, and contained none of  those agglomerations which were found among the Celts and the Belgae. The  Aquitanians, who had originally occupied a vast territory to the north  of the Pyrenees, having been pushed backward by the Celts, had but a  rather limited portion of it in the time of Caesar.    The three regions which composed Gaul were not only, as already stated,  divided into a great number of states, but each state (_civitas_) was  farther subdivided into _pagi_,[75] representing, perhaps, the same  thing as the tribe among the Arabs. The proof of the distinct character  of these agglomerations is found in the fact that in the army each of  them had its separate place, under the command of its own chieftains.  The smallest subdivision was called _vicus_.[76] Such, at least, are the  denominations employed in the \"Commentaries,\" but which were certainly  not those of the Celtic language. In each state there existed principal  towns, called indifferently by Caesar _urbs_ or _oppidum_;[77] yet this  last name was given by preference to considerable towns, difficult of  access and carefully fortified, placed on heights or surrounded by  marshes.[78] It was to these _oppida_ that, in case of attack, the Gauls  transported their grain, their provisions, and their riches.[79] Their  habitations, established often in the forests or on the bank of a river,  were constructed of wood, and tolerably spacious.[80]      [Sidenote: Manners.]    III. The Gauls were tall in stature, their skin was white, their eyes  blue, their hair fair or chestnut, which they dyed, in order to make the  colour more brilliant.[81] They let their beard grow; the nobles alone  shaved, and preserved long moustaches.[82] Trousers or breeches, very  wide among the Belgae, but narrower among the southern Gauls, and a  shirt with sleeves, descending to the middle of the thighs, composed  their principal dress.[83] They were clothed with a mantle or  _saie_,[84] magnificently embroidered with gold or silver among the  rich,[85] and held about the neck by means of a metal brooch. The lowest  classes of the people used instead an animal's skin. The Aquitanians  covered themselves, probably according to the Iberic custom, with cloth  of coarse wool unshorn.[86]    The Gauls wore collars, earrings, bracelets, and rings for the arms, of  gold or copper, according to their rank; necklaces of amber, and rings,  which they placed on the third finger.[87]    They were naturally agriculturists, and we may suppose that the  institution of private property existed among them, because, on the one  hand, all the citizens paid the tax, except the Druids,[88] and, on the  other, the latter were judges of questions of boundaries.[89] They were  not unacquainted with certain manufactures. In some countries they  fabricated serges, which were in great repute, and cloths or felts;[90]  in others they worked the mines with skill, and employed themselves in  the fabrication of metals. The Bituriges worked in iron, and were  acquainted with the art of tinning.[91] The artificers of Alesia plated  copper with leaf-silver, to ornament horses' bits and trappings.[92]    The Gauls fed "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45542"],[0,"Eighteen Months in the War Zone (#6)"],[1,"on I was asked to send a card to his mother. It was difficult  to know what to say, but \"Your son, though a prisoner and wounded, is  safe and being well cared for,\" seemed to meet the occasion. Suddenly  without a word he seized the scissors from my belt. Recalling tales of  vindictive prisoners, I stepped back. The precaution was unnecessary,  for the little Hun was only cutting a button off his coat pocket.    \"Hier, Sie haben ja nichts genommen\" (\"Here, you have not taken  anything\"), he exclaimed, Teuton boorishness veiling the kindliness as  he handed me the \"souvenir.\"    A strangely human incident occurred a little later.    A group of Tommies were watching a Boche having a bayoneted hand  dressed. He spoke quite good English, but was apparently too frightened  to answer any of their sallies. Presently, however, he turned to me  with a request that he might be allowed to send a line to his wife to  say he was alive.    \"'E's young to 'ave a wife, Sister,\" suggested a lame man, the  maintenance of whose large family apparently proved a burden to him.    \"'Ow old are yer? _You?_\" he added, addressing the prisoner.    The Hun pulled out an old letter-case and abstracted the portrait of a  pretty English-looking girl in a garden arbour.    \"My vife,\" he exclaimed. \"She has seventeen years, I nineteen. Ve was  married two days when I come away!\"    In a moment the hostile crowd round him was turned to one of  sympathisers. \"Poor beggar! After all, he probably doesn't want to  fight any more than we do,\" said the lame man.     [Illustration: A WARD IN THE SUGAR-SHED CLEARING STATION]    \"No,\" replied the prisoner, and all the racial antagonism of Saxon  versus Prussian showed itself in his words, \"Ve Saxons not want war--ve  want peace--but they not ask us!\"      _October 31st._ Who could believe, had they not seen for themselves,  the manifold horrors of war? The vermin, against which there is no  coping, vermin that in ordinary times one never saw. The men are alive  with them, so are we, a fact which necessitates a tremendous \"search\"  at every available opportunity. Even amputated limbs are found to be  crawling.    The girl who was working single-handed in this barn until we arrived  was walking along the quay yesterday when a feeble voice called her  from a stretcher. It was her brother. He died in the night, but she is  on duty all the same.    All day long the rush continues. The question \"Shrapnel or bullet?\"  rings incessantly in our ears as each man comes up to get his dressing  done.    One boy of nineteen had no fewer than six bullet wounds in one arm and  two in each leg. It took two of us an hour to dress his wounds, and  afterwards, as I washed his beardless face in response to a gentle  request, I could scarce refrain from sending up a prayer of gratitude  that my own brothers are dead and not mutilated like these boys.    Towards sunset I was called to the side of a youthful Saxon already  rigid with tetanus.    Through his clenched teeth he could still groan to the orderly's  command to lie still: \"Ich kann nicht still liegen\" (\"I can't lie  still\").    At seven o'clock (after nearly twelve hours' work) we went home to  dinner, and, it being our turn to take night shift, were back again  at our posts, with clean aprons and a satisfied inner man, two hours  later. The orderly officer called for any who had not yet had their  second anti-typhoid injection, and I, being one of them, was injected  on the spot.    During the long night, as we hurried from patient to patient in the  darkened cry-haunted ward, covering the restless sleeping figures,  moving them into more comfortable positions, with a prayer for each  one's mother, I could screw up no feeling of resentment towards the  dying Saxon boy, in spite of the cries of our men, but only against  that vile Prussianism that brought up its children to regard rapine  and slaughter as a divine necessity. By midnight things were quiet  enough to allow us to cut up dressings as best we might. By this time,  owing to there not being a chair in the place, I confess my legs were  almost giving way. Moreover, the injection took speedy effect, and a  stiffening arm and rising temperature do not facilitate work of this  kind. Frankly, I do not think any of us will ever be as busy again, and  our one prayer was for strength to \"carry on.\" Many of the men were  tormented by coughs that kept the others awake. All we had to give  them was lukewarm water and the rinsings of a condensed milk tin. (For  euphony we called it \"milk.\")    Those who could not sleep for vermin lit cigarette after cigarette  until their supply ran out. At 2 A.M. we retired to the nurses'  \"bunk\"--a whitewashed, rat-ridden, ill-smelling partitioned  compartment, whose sole furniture consisted of two shelves--until  someone was inspired to fetch the \"dressing-table\" (two empty  boxes--oh, joy of joys! upon which we took it in turns to sit)--and  a coke fire, on which we boiled eggs for our midnight meal. Half-way  through my egg the orderly called me: \"The prisoner can't last much  longer. Will you come and speak to him, Sister?\" It seemed as if the  ward were one huge battlefield, for cries greeted me on all sides.  \"Get at 'em, lads!\" shouted the burly Scot in the corner as he urged  forward his comrades in his sleep. \"Christ help us!\" groaned an armless  dragoon, coming round from the anaesthetic.    I soothed the dying German as best I could when the awful spasms came,  and through his clenched teeth he signified the pain in the \"kreuz\"  (small of the back). What could I say but \"Guter Junge--bleib still. Es  dauert nicht mehr lange!\" (\"Good boy--lie still. It will not last long  now!\") With his remaining hand he pressed mine as I wiped the pouring  sweat from his brow. After all, suffering is a great leveller.    The orderly, an old South African campaigner, looked at the light that  began to flood the sky.    \"They usually go West at this hour,\" he remarked grimly, with a  shudder. I shuddered too; the place was alive with spirits.    For a moment we seemed to hear the sigh of the departing, feel the  rushing of many wings as they brushed past. Then a gaunt, muffled  figure appeared at the door bearing a lantern, for all the world like a  hoary figure of \"Time,\" and we awoke to reality.    \"I've brought down a trainload,\" he said. \"A round dozen of them are  urgent cases and must have beds.\"    Perforce we had to shift the sleeping forms on to the concrete floor,  all bruised and torn and bleeding though they were, cutting shorter  their all too short rest.    An officer was brought in wounded in the abdomen, but cheerfully  talking of getting home. He, too, passed away before eight o'clock.      From the nursing point of view the work is most unsatisfactory, as  disinfectants, to say nothing of dressings, are continually at low ebb.  To-day the iodine ran out. One of the surgeons came round and signified  his intention to dress a bad femur case. I had got together what things  I could when he called for iodine. There being none to be had, he  sighed resignedly, and with \"Then we will leave the dressings for the  present,\" walked off, only to return an hour later with a quantity he  had found in the town.    Of course there can be no attempt at asepsis in a place so ill  ventilated, or, rather, not ventilated at all, for there are no side  windows, and, although the skylight is sufficient for lighting  purposes, the ventilation is effected by means of the excessively  draughty entrances.    It is distinctly unhealthy, and the odours in the place are  indescribable and never to be forgotten. There is no lavatory  accommodation--although latrines are situated along the quay, whither  the blind are led by the armless, the lame carried on orderlies' backs.    Refuse of all sorts that cannot be burned in the incinerator is  disposed of in the sea, and it is good to note that the sacks of straw  are being gradually replaced by _real_ beds and the supply of blankets  is greatly augmented.    Unsatisfactory, too, from the nursing point of view is the fact that  the men pass through the clearing station so rapidly that we seldom do  the same dressing twice; and though there _are_ days when, owing to  rough seas or overladen boats, we are able to watch the progress of the  patients, for the most part it is only the immovable cases that remain,  and the rest are hurried through, leaving one wondering how they will  get on.    Did I say _hurried_ through? There is no need to hurry the men who are  to go home, for no sooner is a boat announced than a general scramble  ensues, and they will leave their breakfast, clothing, even their  treasured trophies behind, in order not to be late.    \"Just a bit of 'ome, and we'll be twice as strong for the next bit o'  fightin',\" they say.    There follows the inspection of labels (for each man is labelled for  his destination: blue for England, yellow for Havre, white for a  convalescent depot), and sad indeed are the faces of those to whom the  medical officer has not vouchsafed the coveted blue ticket.      Just as day dawned, with a last spasm, more awful than the others, the  little Saxon prisoner died. As his close-clenched jaws relaxed the  orderly remarked: \"Not bad-looking for a corpse, Sister; must have been  a pretty child!\"    I asked for his corpse number, but it was not to be found. In my heart  I wished the boy's mother could have known he died well cared for.    It is all very primitive; we have no screens to hide what once was  mortal from the others.    We came off duty at 10 A.M., just as another batch of 1,100 men began  to arrive, and on our way home caught a glimpse of K. of K., who is  paying an incognito visit, as he stepped from a destroyer.
