[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5342"],[0,"The Story Girl (#6)"],[1," we gave our warmest love. We felt that we always had a  friend at court in Uncle Alec, no matter what we did or left undone. And  we never had to turn HIS speeches inside out to discover their meaning.    The social life of juvenile Carlisle centred in the day and Sunday  Schools. We were especially interested in our Sunday School, for we were  fortunate enough to be assigned to a teacher who made our lessons so  interesting that we no longer regarded Sunday School attendance as  a disagreeable weekly duty; but instead looked forward to it with  pleasure, and tried to carry out our teacher's gentle precepts--at least  on Mondays and Tuesdays. I am afraid the remembrance grew a little dim  the rest of the week.    She was also deeply interested in missions; and one talk on this subject  inspired the Story Girl to do a little home missionary work on her own  account. The only thing she could think of, along this line, was to  persuade Peter to go to church.    Felicity did not approve of the design, and said so plainly.    \"He won't know how to behave, for he's never been inside a church door  in his life,\" she warned the Story Girl. \"He'll likely do something  awful, and then you'll feel ashamed and wish you'd never asked him to  go, and we'll all be disgraced. It's all right to have our mite boxes  for the heathen, and send missionaries to them. They're far away and we  don't have to associate with them. But I don't want to have to sit in a  pew with a hired boy.\"    But the Story Girl undauntedly continued to coax the reluctant Peter. It  was not an easy matter. Peter did not come of a churchgoing stock; and  besides, he alleged, he had not yet made up his mind whether to be a  Presbyterian or a Methodist.    \"It isn't a bit of difference which you are,\" pleaded the Story Girl.  \"They both go to heaven.\"    \"But one way must be easier or better than the other, or else they'd all  be one kind,\" argued Peter. \"I want to find the easiest way. And I've  got a hankering after the Methodists. My Aunt Jane was a Methodist.\"    \"Isn't she one still?\" asked Felicity pertly.    \"Well, I don't know exactly. She's dead,\" said Peter rebukingly. \"Do  people go on being just the same after they're dead?\"    \"No, of course not. They're angels then--not Methodists or anything, but  just angels. That is, if they go to heaven.\"    \"S'posen they went to the other place?\"    But Felicity's theology broke down at this point. She turned her back on  Peter and walked disdainfully away.    The Story Girl returned to the main point with a new argument.    \"We have such a lovely minister, Peter. He looks just like the picture  of St. John my father sent me, only he is old and his hair is white.  I know you'd like him. And even if you are going to be a Methodist it  won't hurt you to go to the Presbyterian church. The nearest Methodist  church is six miles away, at Markdale, and you can't attend there just  now. Go to the Presbyterian church until you're old enough to have a  horse.\"    \"But s'posen I got too fond of being Presbyterian and couldn't change if  I wanted to?\" objected Peter.    Altogether, the Story Girl had a hard time of it; but she persevered;  and one day she came to us with the announcement that Peter had yielded.    \"He's going to church with us to-morrow,\" she said triumphantly.    We were out in Uncle Roger's hill pasture, sitting on some smooth, round  stones under a clump of birches. Behind us was an old gray fence, with  violets and dandelions thick in its corners. Below us was the Carlisle  valley, with its orchard-embowered homesteads, and fertile meadows. Its  upper end was dim with a delicate spring mist. Winds blew up the field  like wave upon wave of sweet savour--spice of bracken and balsam.    We were eating little jam \"turnovers,\" which Felicity had made for us.  Felicity's turnovers were perfection. I looked at her and wondered why  it was not enough that she should be so pretty and capable of making  such turnovers. If she were only more interesting! Felicity had not a  particle of the nameless charm and allurement which hung about every  motion of the Story Girl, and made itself manifest in her lightest word  and most careless glance. Ah well, one cannot have every good gift! The  Story Girl had no dimples at her slim, brown wrists.    We all enjoyed our turnovers except Sara Ray. She ate hers but she  knew she should not have done so. Her mother did not approve of snacks  between meals, or of jam turnovers at any time. Once, when Sara was in a  brown study, I asked her what she was thinking of.    \"I'm trying to think of something ma hasn't forbid,\" she answered with a  sigh.    We were all glad to hear that Peter was going to church, except  Felicity. She was full of gloomy forebodings and warnings.    \"I'm surprised at you, Felicity King,\" said Cecily severely. \"You ought  to be glad that poor boy is going to get started in the right way.\"    \"There's a great big patch on his best pair of trousers,\" protested  Felicity.    \"Well, that's better than a hole,\" said the Story Girl, addressing  herself daintily to her turnover. \"God won't notice the patch.\"    \"No, but the Carlisle people will,\" retorted Felicity, in a tone which  implied that what the Carlisle people thought was far more important.  \"And I don't believe that Peter has got a decent stocking to his name.  What will you feel like if he goes to church with the skin of his legs  showing through the holes, Miss Story Girl?\"    \"I'm not a bit afraid,\" said the Story Girl staunchly. \"Peter knows  better than that.\"    \"Well, all I hope is that he'll wash behind his ears,\" said Felicity  resignedly.    \"How is Pat to-day?\" asked Cecily, by way of changing the conversation.    \"Pat isn't a bit better. He just mopes about the kitchen,\" said the  Story Girl anxiously. \"I went out to the barn and I saw a mouse. I had  a stick in my hand and I fetched a swipe at it--so. I killed it stone  dead. Then I took it in to Paddy. Will you believe it? He wouldn't even  look at it. I'm so worried. Uncle Roger says he needs a dose of physic.  But how is he to be made take it, that's the question. I mixed a powder  in some milk and tried to pour it down his throat while Peter held him.  Just look at the scratches I got! And the milk went everywhere except  down Pat's throat.\"    \"Wouldn't it be awful if--if anything happened to Pat?\" whispered  Cecily.    \"Well, we could have a jolly funeral, you know,\" said Dan.    We looked at him in such horror that Dan hastened to apologize.    \"I'd be awful sorry myself if Pat died. But if he DID, we'd have to give  him the right kind of a funeral,\" he protested. \"Why, Paddy just seems  like one of the family.\"    The Story Girl finished her turnover, and stretched herself out on the  grasses, pillowing her chin in her hands and looking at the sky. She was  bare headed, as usual, and her scarlet ribbon was bound filletwise about  her head. She had twined freshly plucked dandelions around it and the  effect was that of a crown of brilliant golden stars on her sleek, brown  curls.    \"Look at that long, thin, lacy cloud up there,\" she said. \"What does it  make you think of, girls?\"    \"A wedding veil,\" said Cecily.    \"That is just what it is--the Wedding Veil of the Proud Princess. I  know a story about it. I read it in a book. Once upon a time\"--the Story  Girl's eyes grew dreamy, and her accents floated away on the summer  air like wind-blown rose petals--\"there was a princess who was the most  beautiful princess in the world, and kings from all lands came to woo  her for a bride. But she was as proud as she was beautiful. She laughed  all her suitors to scorn. And when her father urged her to choose one of  them as her husband she drew herself up haughtily--so--\"    The Story Girl sprang to her feet and for a moment we saw the proud  princess of the old tale in all her scornful loveliness--    \"and she said,    \"'I will not wed until a king comes who can conquer all kings. Then I  shall be the wife of the king of the world and no one can hold herself  higher than I.'    \"So every king went to war to prove that he could conquer every one  else, and there was a great deal of bloodshed and misery. But the proud  princess laughed and sang, and she and her maidens worked at a wonderful  lace veil which she meant to wear when the king of all kings came. It  was a very beautiful veil; but her maidens whispered that a man had died  and a woman's heart had broken for every stitch set in it.    \"Just when a king thought he had conquered everybody some other king  would come and conquer HIM; and so it went on until it did not seem  likely the proud princess would ever get a husband at all. But still  her pride was so great that she would not yield, even though everybody  except the kings who wanted to marry her, hated her for the suffering  she had caused. One day a horn was blown at the palace gate; and there  was one tall man in complete armor with his visor down, riding on a  white horse. When he said he had come to marry the princess every one  laughed, for he had no retinue and no beautiful apparel, and no golden  crown.    \"'But I am the king who conquers all kings,' he said.    \"'You must prove it before I shall marry you,' said the proud princess.  But she trembled and turned pale, for there was something in his voice  that frightened her. And when he laughed, his laughter was still more  dreadful.    \"'I can easily prove it, beautiful princess,' he said, 'but you must  go with me to my kingdom for the proof. Marry me now, and you and I and  your father and all your court will ride straightway to my kingdom; and  if you are not satisfied then that I am the king who conquers all kings  you may give me back my ring and return home free of me forever more.'    \"It was a strange wooing and the friends of the princess begged her to  refuse. But her pride whispered that it would be such a wonderful thing  to be the queen of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53499"],[0,"Martin Luther (#6)"],[1,"e.\" She was an  efficient housekeeper and thrifty manager of what little they possessed  at the outset. Neither had any money. Luther refused pay for his  writing, although the publishers grew rich, nor did he receive any tax  revenues from the cloister since he had laid aside his cowl.    Things improved when the elector gave Luther the cloister for a home,  and adjacent to it a vegetable garden with a small brew house where  Kathie prepared the family beverage. His small salary as professor was  augmented somewhat when they took in boarding students attending the  university.    The Luthers had six children. Two of them died in childhood, but  otherwise the family enjoyed a merry, wholesome life. The house was  always full of visitors--some of them more or less permanent--including  traveling dignitaries, numerous aunts and relatives, monks and nuns  seeking a permanent residence, and four orphaned children from among  their kinsfolk. Because it was large and suitable, the cloister  sometimes was used as a hospital, and it was not unusual for the  \"family\" to number as many as twenty-five. Guests who stayed for any  length of time were expected to take part in household duties,  participate in daily prayers, catechetical study, and family devotions.  Music, singing, chess, and outdoor bowling were forms of recreation.  Through Kathie's economy, improvements were made in the Luther house. An  orchard, hop garden, and finally a farm were purchased.    When Luther worried about his children's future he overcame it with  faith. A pious training is most important, he wrote. It is good to leave  an inheritance, but preparing children to manage wisely is more  important. We parents are fools if we don't train them to fear God, to  control themselves, and to live honorably.        [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]          A CHURCH REBORN                              The National Conscience    The people at Wittenberg and in other cities of influence were gradually  learning to think of the church as separate from the Roman hierarchy.  Now there was need for reorganization. A steady supply of ministers was  essential and arrangements had to be made for their training and  support. A bond of some sort was necessary to establish unity of  endeavor, and mission work was imperative in areas where conviction had  lapsed into indifference.    Luther didn't care for organizational work. The thought that the new  church might degenerate into a system of laws and regulations haunted  him. Although his revised order of worship was finding its way into use  he felt that still more urgent matters demanded attention. Proper  instruction of young and old was essential and to accomplish it there  had to be some sort of oversight.    The bishops had neglected instruction of the laymen and the princes were  loath to reinstitute it. Luther, therefore, laid the task directly upon  the congregations and in some cases the city councils to select  competent men as pastors, establish pastoral districts, and set up  schools. To advise and assist in this work, visitation committees  comprising learned laymen and theologians traveled throughout Saxony  beginning in 1527. The visitation was carried on in other areas of  Germany too, and in this way the groundwork for future organization  began.    In the meantime two distinct factions had developed among the princes of  Germany. One espoused the Roman cause, the other the Reformation. From  1525 to 1529 a series of diets and assemblies was held. The rival  princes concerned themselves largely with attempts at, and opposition  to, the invoking of the ban against Luther, his works, and his cohorts  which had been executed at Worms. At Speyer in 1529 the Catholic  princes, with the emperor's backing, tried to force a resolution  preventing the spread of Luther's teachings in any new areas, but the  Reformation princes protested. Matters concerning salvation were of an  individual nature and could not be legislated. Conscience bound them to  oppose the resolution. Principles which the Wittenberg monk had declared  only eight years before were becoming the national mind.                              The Augsburg Confession    Sparks of the Reformation had caught fire elsewhere in Europe developing  into Reformed, Mennonite, Anabaptist, and other denominations. A major  purpose of the diet called by Emperor Charles at Augsburg in 1530 was to  harmonize these various groups and attempt a final reconciliation with  Rome. To this end each body was to define its teaching in a statement or  confession, but not all were represented at the diet and only three were  actually submitted.    As usual the papists were laying for the Lutherans. They had prejudiced  the emperor against a fair hearing and were reserving their best  ammunition for the Saxon \"heretics,\" fully confident that a Lutheran  defeat would speedily bring the downfall of the others.    Still under imperial ban, Luther could not attend the diet but stayed at  a castle in Coburg from which he advised Melanchthon and others  appearing before the emperor. The confession, a series of twenty-eight  articles setting forth the Lutheran position, was read on June 25. The  first twenty-one present fundamental doctrines of the Scriptures  regarding God, Original Sin, the Son of God, Justification, the Church,  the Sacraments, Civil Affairs, the Freedom of Will, the Cause of Sin,  Good Works, and the Worship of Saints; while the last seven treat of  Roman abuses which contradict the Word of God.    The emperor commissioned the Roman theologians to prepare a refutation.  On the basis of it he rejected the Lutheran confession, ordered church  property restored to Roman bishops, and forbade witnessing and the  printing or sale of Lutheran writings.    Dejected by their failure to reform the church, the Lutherans went home  in the fall of 1530 unaware that their confession would become a basic  creed of the largest Protestant body in the world.    Threatened with coercion by the Romanists in Germany, they joined with  other Protestants in 1531 to form the League of Schmalkalden. War was  averted when the emperor enlisted both groups to meet the Turkish  invasion of Austria, and armed conflict over religious principles was  delayed until the summer of 1546. Luther didn't see it. A few months  earlier he went to stand before the Judge he had learned to love instead  of fear.                                  Back to Eisleben    The circuit of Luther's life was completed in Eisleben, his birthplace,  where he had gone to mediate between the princes of Mansfeld. He died  early on the morning of February 18, 1546, after fervently committing  himself to God's keeping and reaffirming the doctrines he had preached.    Luther's lifetime was marked with concern--concern first about himself  and God. It wasn't selfish; a man has to find his treasure before he can  share it. Luther had searched through lonely tormented hours in a  monastery; he brushed aside centuries of proud speculation until he  found the truth. It was written in a book, the record of God's  revelation of himself to man--the Bible. From it he learned that God is  love instead of wrath; that no one, pope or king, can stand between man  and that love, or gain it for another; that one can't even win it for  himself. It is God's free gift.    Then his concern was for others. This treasure was too priceless to  keep; he had to give it away. He preached it, though all the forces of  evil railed against him. He printed it, though emperors ordered him to  stop the press. He sang it and helped the church to sing--in tones so  soft they lull a child to sleep; in battlecries resounding from the  ramparts of his mighty-fortress God.    \"The devil prefers blockheads,\" he said, therefore, \"the school must be  the next thing to the church.\" Concern led him to teach. Professor was  the only job he held--but that for all his life. He hated those who  arrogantly claimed sole right to knowledge. So that each might know the  truth himself, and in that truth be free, he translated the sacred  Scriptures. Matthew to Revelation first, and then the Old Testament were  translated, not in high-sounding phrase or platitude, but in majestic  simplicity--the words of Hans and Hilda. The lords and ladies would  understand it that way too.    The principles of faith which Luther proclaimed, brought fame and the  promise of power. But the words addressed to the nobles at Worms recount  the humility of his service: \"I seek nothing beyond reforming the church  in conformity with the Scriptures. I reserve nothing but to bear witness  to the Word of God alone.\"                                         CHRONOLOGY        1483   November 10       Martin Luther born at Eisleben    1484                     Family moves to Mansfeld    1497                     Luther goes to Magdeburg school    1498                     Luther goes to Eisenach school    1501                     Enters University of Erfurt    1505                     Receives master of arts degree           July 2            Vows to become a monk           July 17           Enters Augustinian cloister at Erfurt    1507   April 4           Ordained to priesthood    1508                     Teaches at Wittenberg    1509                     Lectures at University of Erfurt    1510   November          Begins journey to Rome    1511                     Returns to Wittenberg as professor    1512   October 18-19     Receives doctor of sacred scripture                             degree    1517   October 31        Posts ninety-five theses    1518   August            Pope wants Luther brought to Rome    1519   July 4-14         Luther debates with Eck at Leipzig    1520   June 15           Papal bull signed           October 10        Luther receives bull           December 10       Luther burns bull    1521   January 27        Diet of Worms begins           April 16          Arrives at"]]]
