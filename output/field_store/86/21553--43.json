[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37206"],[0,"Sea and Sardinia (#6)"],[1,"r. The hills behind Palermo prick up their ears on the  sky-line. The city lies unseen, near us and level. There--a big ship is  coming in: the Naples boat.    And the little boats keep putting off from the near quay, and coming to  us. We watch. A stout officer, cavalry, in grayey-green, with a big  dark-blue cloak lined with scarlet. The scarlet lining keeps flashing.  He has a little beard, and his uniform is not quite clean. He has big  wooden chests, tied with rope, for luggage. Poor and of no class. Yet  that scarlet, splendid lining, and the spurs. It seems a pity they must  go second-class. Yet so it is, he goes forward when the dock porter has  hoisted those wooden boxes. No fellow-passenger yet.    Boats still keep coming. Ha-ha! Here is the commissariat! Various sides  of kid, ready for roasting: various chickens: fennel like celery: wine  in a bottiglione: new bread: packages! Hand them up, hand them up. \"Good  food!\" cries the q-b in anticipation.    It must be getting near time to go. Two more passengers--young thick men  in black broad-cloth standing up in the stern of a little boat, their  hands in their pockets, looking a little cold about the chin. Not quite  Italian, too sturdy and manly. Sardinians from Cagliari, as a matter of  fact.           *       *       *       *       *    We go down from the chill upper-deck. It is growing full day. Bits of  pale gold are flying among delicate but cold flakes of cloud from the  east, over Monte Pellegrino, bits of very new turquoise sky come out.  Palermo on the left crouches upon her all-harbour--a little desolate,  disorderly, end-of-the-world, end-of-the-sea, along her quay front. Even  from here we can see the yellow carts rattling slowly, the mules  nodding their high weird plumes of scarlet along the broad weary  harbour-side. Oh painted carts of Sicily, with all history on your  panels!           *       *       *       *       *    Arrives an individual at our side. \"The captain fears it will not be  possible to start. There is much wind outside. Much wind!\"    How they _love_ to come up with alarming, disquieting, or annoying news!  The joy it gives them. What satisfaction on all the faces: of course all  the other loafers are watching us, the street-corner loungers of this  deck. But we have been many times bitten.    \"Ah ma!\" say I, looking at the sky, \"not so much wind as all that.\"    An air of quiet, shrugging indifference is most effectual: as if you  knew all about it, a good deal more than they knew.    \"Ah si! Molto vento! Molto vento! Outside! Outside!\"    With a long face and a dramatic gesture he points out of the harbour, to  the grey sea. I too look out of the harbour at the pale line of sea  beyond the mole. But I do not trouble to answer, and my eye is calm. So  he goes away, only half triumphant.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Things seem to get worse and worse!\" cries the American friend. \"What  will you do on such a boat if you have an awful time out in the  Mediterranean here? Oh no--will you risk it, really? Won't you go from  Civita Vecchia?\"    \"How awful it will be!\" cries the q-b, looking round the grey harbour,  the many masts clustering in the grey sky on the right: the big Naples  boat turning her posterior to the quay-side a little way off, and  cautiously budging backwards: the almost entirely shut-in harbour: the  bits of blue and flying white cloud overhead: the little boats like  beetles scuttling hither and thither across the basin: the thick crowd  on the quay come to meet the Naples boat.           *       *       *       *       *    Time! Time! The American friend must go. She bids us goodbye, more than  sympathetically.    \"I shall be awfully interested to hear how you get on.\"    So down the side she goes. The boatman wants twenty francs--wants  more--but doesn't get it. He gets ten, which is five too much. And so,  sitting rather small and pinched and cold-looking, huddled in her  sweater, she bibbles over the ripply water to the distant stone steps.  We wave farewell. But other traffic comes between us. And the q-b,  feeling nervous, is rather cross because the American friend's ideas of  luxury have put us in such a poor light. We feel like the poorest of  poor sea-faring relations.           *       *       *       *       *    Our ship is hooting for all she's worth. An important last-minuter comes  surging up. The rope hawsers are being wound clankily in. Seagulls--they  are never very many in the Mediterranean--seagulls whirl like a few  flakes of snow in the upper chill air. Clouds spin. And without knowing  it we are evaporating away from the shore, from our mooring, between the  great _City of Trieste_ and another big black steamer that lies like a  wall. We breathe towards this second black wall of steamer: distinctly.  And of course an individual in an official cap is standing on the bottom  of our departure ladder just above the water, yelling Barca!  Barca!--shouting for a boat. And an old man on the sea stands up to his  oars and comes pushing his clumsy boat with gathering speed between us  and the other black wall. There he stands away below there, small,  firing his clumsy boat along, remote as if in a picture on the dark  green water. And our black side insidiously and evilly aspires to the  other huge black wall. He rows in the canyon between, and is nearly  here.    When lo, the individual on the bottom step turns in the other direction.  Another boat from the open basin is sweeping up: it is a race: she is  near, she is nearer, she is up. With a curvet the boat from the open  rounds up at the ladder. The boat between the gulf backs its oars. The  official individual shouts and waves, the old man backing his oars in  the gulf below yells expostulation, the boat from the open carries off  its prey, our ship begins slowly to puddle-puddle-puddle, working her  screw, the man in the gulf of green water rows for his life--we are  floating into the open basin.    Slowly, slowly we turn round: and as the ship turns, our hearts turn.  Palermo fades from our consciousness: the Naples boat, the disembarking  crowds, the rattling carriages to the land--the great _City of  Trieste_--all fades from our heart. We see only the open gap of the  harbour entrance, and the level, pale-grey void of the sea beyond. There  are wisps of gleamy light--out there.    And out there our heart watches--though Palermo is near us, just behind.  We look round, and see it all behind us--but already it is gone, gone  from our heart. The fresh wind, the gleamy wisps of light, the running,  open sea beyond the harbour bars.           *       *       *       *       *    And so we steam out. And almost at once the ship begins to take a long,  slow, dizzy dip, and a fainting swoon upwards, and a long, slow, dizzy  dip, slipping away from beneath one. The q-b turns pale. Up comes the  deck in that fainting swoon backwards--then down it fades in that  indescribable slither forwards. It is all quite gentle--quite, quite  gentle. But oh, so long, and so slow, and so dizzy.    \"Rather pleasant!\" say I to the q-b.    \"Yes. Rather lovely _really_,\" she answers wistfully. To tell the truth  there is something in the long, slow lift of the ship, and her long,  slow slide forwards which makes my heart beat with joy. It is the motion  of freedom. To feel her come up--then slide slowly forward, with a sound  of the smashing of waters, is like the magic gallop of the sky, the  magic gallop of elemental space. That long, slow, waveringly rhythmic  rise and fall of the ship, with waters snorting as it were from her  nostrils, oh God what a joy it is to the wild innermost soul. One is  free at last--and lilting in a slow flight of the elements, winging  outwards. Oh God, to be free of all the hemmed-in life--the horror of  human tension, the absolute insanity of machine persistence. The agony  which a train is to me, really. And the long-drawn-out agony of a life  among tense, resistant people on land. And then to feel the long, slow  lift and drop of this almost empty ship, as she took the waters. Ah God,  liberty, liberty, elemental liberty. I wished in my soul the voyage  might last forever, that the sea had no end, that one might float in  this wavering, tremulous, yet long and surging pulsation while ever time  lasted: space never exhausted, and no turning back, no looking back,  even.           *       *       *       *       *    The ship was almost empty--save of course for the street-corner louts  who hung about just below, on the deck itself. We stood alone on the  weather-faded little promenade deck, which has old oak seats with old,  carved little lions at the ends, for arm-rests--and a little cabin  mysteriously shut, which much peeping determined as the wireless office  and the operator's little curtained bed-niche.           *       *       *       *       *    Cold, fresh wind, a black-blue, translucent, rolling sea on which the  wake rose in snapping foam, and Sicily on the left: Monte Pellegrino, a  huge, inordinate mass of pinkish rock, hardly crisped with the faintest  vegetation, looming up to heaven from the sea. Strangely large in mass  and bulk Monte Pellegrino looks: and bare, like a Sahara in heaven: and  old-looking. These coasts of Sicily are very imposing, terrific,  fortifying the interior. And again one gets the feeling that age has  worn them bare: as if old, old civilisations had worn away and exhausted  the soil, leaving a terrifying blankness of rock, as at Syracuse in  plateaus, and here in a great mass.           *       *       *       *       *    There seems hardly any one on board but ourselves: we alone on the  little promenade deck. Strangely lonely, floating on a bare old ship  past the great bare shores, on a rolling sea, stooping and rising in the  wind. The wood of the fittings is all bare and weather-silvered, the  cabin, the seats, even the little lions of the seats."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3721"],[0,"France and England in North America, Part I: Pioneers of France in the New World (#6)"],[1,"the Atlantic, and on the  thirtieth of April, in the latitude of twenty-nine and a half degrees,  saw the long, low line where the wilderness of waves met the wilderness  of woods. It was the coast of Florida. They soon descried a jutting  point, which they called French Cape, perhaps one of the headlands of  Matanzas Inlet. They turned their prows northward, coasting the fringes  of that waste of verdure which rolled in shadowy undulation far to the  unknown West.    On the next morning, the first of May, they found themselves off the  mouth of a great river. Riding at anchor on a sunny sea, they lowered  their boats, crossed the bar that obstructed the entrance, and floated  on a basin of deep and sheltered water, \"boyling and roaring,\" says  Ribaut, \"through the multitude of all kind of fish.\" Indians were  running along the beach, and out upon the sand-bars, beckoning them  to land. They pushed their boats ashore and disembarked,--sailors,  soldiers, and eager young nobles. Corselet and morion, arquebuse and  halberd, flashed in the sun that flickered through innumerable leaves,  as, kneeling on the ground, they gave thanks to God, who had guided  their voyage to an issue full of promise. The Indians, seated gravely  under the neighboring trees, looked on in silent respect, thinking that  they worshipped the sun. \"They be all naked and of a goodly stature,  mightie, and as well shapen and proportioned of body as any people in ye  world; and the fore part of their body and armes be painted with pretie  deuised workes, of Azure, red, and blacke, so well and so properly as  the best Painter of Europe could not amende it.\" With their squaws and  children, they presently drew near, and, strewing the earth with laurel  boughs, sat down among the Frenchmen. Their visitors were much pleased  with them, and Ribaut gave the chief, whom he calls the king, a robe of  blue cloth, worked in yellow with the regal fleur-de-lis.    But Ribaut and his followers, just escaped from the dull prison of their  ships, were intent on admiring the wild scenes around them. Never had  they known a fairer May-day. The quaint old narrative is exuberant with  delight. The tranquil air, the warm sun, woods fresh with young verdure,  meadows bright with flowers; the palm, the cypress, the pine, the  magnolia; the grazing deer; herons, curlews, bitterns, woodcock, and  unknown water-fowl that waded in the ripple of the beach; cedars bearded  from crown to root with long, gray moss; huge oaks smothering in the  folds of enormous grapevines;--such were the objects that greeted them  in their roamings, till their new-discovered land seemed \"the fairest,  fruitfullest, and pleasantest of al the world.\"    They found a tree covered with caterpillars, and hereupon the ancient  black-letter says: \"Also there be Silke wormes in meruielous number, a  great deale fairer and better then be our silk wormes. To bee short, it  is a thing vnspeakable to consider the thinges that bee seene there, and  shalbe founde more and more in this incomperable lande.\"  [9]    Above all, it was plain to their excited fancy that the country was rich  in gold and silver, turquoises and pearls. One of these last, \"as great  as an Acorne at ye least,\" hung from the neck of an Indian who stood  near their boats as they re-embarked. They gathered, too, from the signs  of their savage visitors, that the wonderful land of Cibola, with its  seven cities and its untold riches, was distant but twenty days' journey  by water. In truth, it was two thousand miles westward, and its wealth a  fable.    They named the river the River of May. It is now the St. John's. \"And  on the next morning,\" says Ribault, \"we returned to land againe,  accompanied with the Captaines, Gentlemen, and Souldiers, and others of  our small troope, carrying with us a Pillour or columne of harde stone,  our king's armes graved therein, to plant and set the same in the  enterie of the Porte; and being come thither we espied on the south  syde of the River a place very fitte for that purpose upon a little  hill compassed with Cypres, Bayes, Paulmes, and other trees, with sweete  smelling and pleasant shrubbes.\" Here they set the column, and then,  again embarking, held their course northward, happy in that benign  decree which locks from mortal eyes the secrets of the future.    Next they anchored near Fernandina, and to a neighboring river, probably  the St. Mary's, gave the name of the Seine. Here, as morning broke on  the fresh, moist meadows hung with mists, and on broad reaches of inland  waters which seemed like lakes, they were tempted to land again, and  soon \"espied an innumerable number of footesteps of great Hartes and  Hindes of a wonderfull greatnesse, the steppes being all fresh and new,  and it seemeth that the people doe nourish them like tame Cattell.\" By  two or three weeks of exploration they seem to have gained a clear idea  of this rich semi-aquatic region. Ribaut describes it as \"a countrie  full of hauens, riuers, and Ilands, of such fruitfulnes as cannot with  tongue be expressed.\" Slowly moving northward, they named each river, or  inlet supposed to be a river, after some stream of France,--the Loire,  the Charente, the Garonne, the Gironde. At length, opening betwixt flat  and sandy shores, they saw a commodious haven, and named it Port Royal.    On the twenty-seventh of May they crossed the bar where the war-ships of  Dupont crossed three hundred years later, passed Hilton Head, and held  their course along the peaceful bosom of Broad River. [10] On the left  they saw a stream which they named Libourne, probably Skull Creek; on  the right, a wide river, probably the Beaufort. When they landed, all  was solitude. The frightened Indians had fled, but they lured them back  with knives, beads, and looking-glasses, and enticed two of them on  board their ships. Here, by feeding, clothing, and caressing them, they  tried to wean them from their fears, thinking to carry them to France,  in obedience to a command of Catherine de Medicis; but the captive  warriors moaned and lamented day and night, and at length made their  escape.    Ranging the woods, they found them full of game, wild turkeys and  partridges, bears and lynxes. Two deer, of unusual size, leaped from the  underbrush. Cross-bow and arquebuse were brought to the level; but  the Huguenot captain, \"moved with the singular fairness and bigness of  them,\" forbade his men to shoot.    Preliminary exploration, not immediate settlement, had been the object  of the voyage; but all was still rose-color in the eyes of the voyagers,  and many of their number would gladly linger in the New Canaan. Ribaut  was more than willing to humor them. He mustered his company on deck,  and made them a harangue. He appealed to their courage and their  patriotism, told them how, from a mean origin, men rise by enterprise  and daring to fame and fortune, and demanded who among them would stay  behind and hold Port Royal for the King. The greater part came forward,  and \"with such a good will and joly corage,\" writes the commander, \"as  we had much to do to stay their importunitie.\" Thirty were chosen, and  Albert de Pierria was named to command them.    A fort was begun on a small stream called the Chenonceau, probably  Archer's Creek, about six miles from the site of Beaufort. [11]  They named it Charlesfort, in honor of the unhappy son of Catherine  de Medicis, Charles the Ninth, the future hero of St. Bartholomew.  Ammunition and stores were sent on shore, and on the eleventh of June,  with his diminished company, Ribaut again embarked and spread his sails  for France.    From the beach at Hilton Head, Albert and his companions might watch  the receding ships, growing less and less on the vast expanse of blue,  dwindling to faint specks, then vanishing on the pale verge of the  waters. They were alone in those fearful solitudes. From the north pole  to Mexico there was no Christian denizen but they.    The pressing question was how they were to subsist. Their thought was  not of subsistence, but of gold. Of the thirty, the greater number were  soldiers and sailors, with a few gentlemen; that is to say, men of the  sword, born within the pale of nobility, who at home could neither labor  nor trade without derogation from their rank. For a time they busied  themselves with finishing their fort, and, this done, set forth in quest  of adventures.    The Indians had lost fear of them. Ribaut had enjoined upon them to use  all kindness and gentleness in their dealing with the men of the woods;  and they more than obeyed him. They were soon hand and glove with  chiefs, warriors, and squaws; and as with Indians the adage that  familiarity breeds contempt holds with peculiar force, they quickly  divested themselves of the prestige which had attached at the outset  to their supposed character of children of the Sun. Good-will, however,  remained, and this the colonists abused to the utmost.    Roaming by river, swamp, and forest, they visited in turn the villages  of five petty chiefs, whom they called kings, feasting everywhere on  hominy, beans, and game, and loaded with gifts. One of these chiefs,  named Audusta, invited them to the grand religious festival of his  tribe. When they arrived, they found the village alive with preparation,  and troops of women busied in sweeping the great circular area where the  ceremonies were to take place. But as the noisy and impertinent guests  showed a disposition to undue merriment, the chief shut them all in  his wigwam, lest their Gentile eyes should profane the mysteries.  Here, immured in darkness, they listened to the howls, yelpings, and  lugubrious songs that resounded from without. One of them, however, by  some artifice, contrived to escape, hid behind a bush, and saw the  whole solemnity,--the procession of the medicinemen and the bedaubed  and befeathered warriors; the drumming, dancing, and"]]]
