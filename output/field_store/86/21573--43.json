It  must, therefore, follow from some attribute of God, in so far as  the said attribute is considered as in some way modified; for  substance and modes make up the sum total of existence (by Ax. i.  and Def. iii., v.), while modes are merely modifications of the  attributes of God.  But from God, or from any of his attributes,  in so far as the latter is modified by a modification infinite  and eternal, a conditioned thing cannot follow.  Wherefore it  must follow from, or be conditioned for, existence and action by  God or one of his attributes, in so far as the latter are  modified by some modification which is finite, and has a  conditioned existence.  This is our first point.  Again, this  cause or this modification (for the reason by which we  established the first part of this proof) must in its turn be  conditioned by another cause, which also is finite, and has a  conditioned existence, and, again, this last by another (for the  same reason); and so on (for the same reason) to infinity.  Q.E.D.    Note.--As certain things must be produced immediately by God,  namely those things which necessarily follow from his absolute  nature, through the means of these primary attributes, which,  nevertheless, can neither exist nor be conceived without God, it  follows:--1. That God is absolutely the proximate cause of those  things immediately produced by him.  I say absolutely, not after  his kind, as is usually stated.  For the effects of God cannot  either exist or be conceived without a cause (Prop. xv. and Prop.  xxiv. Coroll.).  2. That God cannot properly be styled the remote  cause of individual things, except for the sake of distinguishing  these from what he immediately produces, or rather from what  follows from his absolute nature.  For, by a remote cause, we  understand a cause which is in no way conjoined to the effect.  But all things which are, are in God, and so depend on God, that  without him they can neither be nor be conceived.    PROP. XXIX.  Nothing in the universe is contingent, but all  things are conditioned to exist and operate in a particular  manner by the necessity of the divine nature.    Proof.--Whatsoever is, is in God (Prop. xv.).  But God cannot  be called a thing contingent.  For (by Prop. xi.) he exists  necessarily, and not contingently.  Further, the modes of the  divine nature follow therefrom necessarily, and not contingently  (Prop. xvi.); and they thus follow, whether we consider the  divine nature absolutely, or whether we consider it as in any way  conditioned to act (Prop. xxvii.).  Further, God is not only the  cause of these modes, in so far as they simply exist (by Prop.  xxiv, Coroll.), but also in so far as they are considered as  conditioned for operating in a particular manner (Prop. xxvi.).  If they be not conditioned by God (Prop. xxvi.), it is  impossible, and not contingent, that they should condition  themselves; contrariwise, if they be conditioned by God, it is  impossible, and not contingent, that they should render  themselves unconditioned. Wherefore all things are conditioned by  the necessity of the divine nature, not only to exist, but also  to exist and operate in a particular manner, and there is nothing  that is contingent.  Q.E.D.    Note.--Before going any further, I wish here to explain, what  we should understand by nature viewed as active (natura  naturans), and nature viewed as passive (natura naturata).  I say  to explain, or rather call attention to it, for I think that,  from what has been said, it is sufficiently clear, that by nature  viewed as active we should understand that which is in itself,  and is conceived through itself, or those attributes of  substance, which express eternal and infinite essence, in other  words (Prop. xiv., Coroll. i., and Prop. xvii., Coroll. ii) God,  in so far as he is considered as a free cause.    By nature viewed as passive I understand all that which  follows from the necessity of the nature of God, or of any of the  attributes of God, that is, all the modes of the attributes of  God, in so far as they are considered as things which are in God,  and which without God cannot exist or be conceived.    PROP. XXX.  Intellect, in function (actu) finite, or in function  infinite, must comprehend the attributes of God and the  modifications of God, and nothing else.    Proof.--A true idea must agree with its object (Ax. vi.); in  other words (obviously), that which is contained in the intellect  in representation must necessarily be granted in nature.  But in  nature (by Prop. xiv., Coroll. i.) there is no substance save  God, nor any modifications save those (Prop. xv.) which are in  God, and cannot without God either be or be conceived.  Therefore  the intellect, in function finite, or in function infinite, must  comprehend the attributes of God and the modifications of God,  and nothing else.  Q.E.D.    PROP. XXXI.  The intellect in function, whether finite or  infinite, as will, desire, love, &c., should be referred to  passive nature and not to active nature.    Proof.--By the intellect we do not (obviously) mean absolute  thought, but only a certain mode of thinking, differing from  other modes, such as love, desire, &c., and therefore (Def. v.)  requiring to be conceived through absolute thought.  It must (by  Prop. xv. and Def. vi.), through some attribute of God which  expresses the eternal and infinite essence of thought, be so  conceived, that without such attribute it could neither be nor be  conceived.  It must therefore be referred to nature passive  rather than to nature active, as must also the other modes of  thinking.  Q.E.D.    Note.--I do not here, by speaking of intellect in function,  admit that there is such a thing as intellect in potentiality:  but, wishing to avoid all confusion, I desire to speak only of  what is most clearly perceived by us, namely, of the very act of  understanding, than which nothing is more clearly perceived.  For  we cannot perceive anything without adding to our knowledge of  the act of understanding.    PROP. XXXII.  Will cannot be called a free cause, but only a  necessary cause.    Proof.--Will is only a particular mode of thinking, like  intellect; therefore (by Prop. xxviii.) no volition can exist,  nor be conditioned to act, unless it be conditioned by some cause  other than itself, which cause is conditioned by a third cause,  and so on to infinity.  But if will be supposed infinite, it must  also be conditioned to exist and act by God, not by virtue of his  being substance absolutely infinite, but by virtue of his  possessing an attribute which expresses the infinite and eternal  essence of thought (by Prop. xxiii.).  Thus, however it be  conceived, whether as finite or infinite, it requires a cause by  which it should be conditioned to exist and act.  Thus (Def.  vii.) it cannot be called a free cause, but only a necessary or  constrained cause.  Q.E.D.    Coroll. I.--Hence it follows, first, that God does not act  according to freedom of the will.    Coroll. II.--It follows, secondly, that will and intellect  stand in the same relation to the nature of God as do motion, and  rest, and absolutely all natural phenomena, which must be  conditioned by God (Prop. xxix.) to exist and act in a particular  manner.  For will, like the rest, stands in need of a cause, by  which it is conditioned to exist and act in a particular manner.  And although, when will or intellect be granted, an infinite  number of results may follow, yet God cannot on that account be  said to act from freedom of the will, any more than the infinite  number of results from motion and rest would justify us in saying  that motion and rest act by free will.  Wherefore will no more  appertains to God than does anything else in nature, but stands  in the same relation to him as motion, rest, and the like, which  we have shown to follow from the necessity of the divine nature,  and to be conditioned by it to exist and act in a particular  manner.    PROP. XXXIII.  Things could not have been brought into being by  God in any manner or in any order different from that which has  in fact obtained.    Proof--All things necessarily follow from the nature of God  (Prop. xvi.), and by the nature of God are conditioned to exist  and act in a particular way (Prop. xxix.).  If things, therefore,  could have been of a different nature, or have been conditioned  to act in a different way, so that the order of nature would have  been different, God's nature would also have been able to be  different from what it now is; and therefore (by Prop. xi.) that  different nature also would have perforce existed, and  consequently there would have been able to be two or more Gods.  This (by Prop. xiv., Coroll. i.) is absurd.  Therefore things  could not have been brought into being by God in any other  manner, &c.  Q.E.D.    Note I.--As I have thus shown, more clearly than the sun at  noonday, that there is nothing to justify us in calling things  contingent, I wish to explain briefly what meaning we shall  attach to the word contingent; but I will first explain the  words necessary and impossible.    A thing is called necessary either in respect to its essence  or in respect to its cause; for the existence of a thing  necessarily follows, either from its essence and definition, or  from a given efficient cause.  For similar reasons a thing is  said to be impossible; namely, inasmuch as its essence or  definition involves a contradiction, or because no external cause  is granted, which is conditioned to produce such an effect; but  a thing can in no respect be called contingent, save in relation  to the imperfection of our knowledge.

Their eggs  number from four to eight, are dull white in color, and are usually  covered by the bird with a portion of the nesting material when it  leaves its home. Grebes occasionally rest on the shore, but are rarely  found far from the water. When on land they may lie flat on their  breasts or sit erect on their tails and entire foot, or tarsus. Their  progress on land, as a rule, is awkward and they may use their wings  as fore feet to assist them. In diving, Grebes sometimes spring partly  from the water and then plunge downward head first, or they may  quietly sink with scarce a ripple to mark the place of their  disappearance.    Loons generally pass the summer on some large lake, and in the winter  many of them live at sea. They nest, as a rule, on the shore, but so  near the water that the parent bird may slide off its two dark brown,  mottled eggs into its favorite element. Like the Grebes, Loons are  expert divers, and birds of both families so often seek safety under  the water rather than in the air that it is frequently difficult to  make them fly. The young of both Grebes and Loons are born covered  with feathers and take to the water shortly after birth, often using  the back of the parent bird as an ever present island on which they  may rest at will.    The Auks, Murres, and Puffins are sea birds which nest usually in  large colonies on isolated islets or rocky, inaccessible shores of the  northern part of the northern hemisphere. They lay one or two eggs,  sometimes in an exposed position among the rocks with no attempt at  nest-building, sometimes at the end of a burrow excavated by the  birds. In the latter case, the young are reared in the nest; in the  former, they sometimes enter the water at an early age.    The one egg laid by Murres is remarkable both in color and in shape.  In color it varies from bluish green to buff, and is usually heavily  scrawled with black. In outline it is pyriform or pear-shaped. When  moved it does not roll away as would a hen's egg but revolves about  its own tip. In this manner it retains its place on the narrow ledges  often chosen by Murres for nesting-sites.
