Some clever sea rudder and engine throttling by the  pilot soon brought the Catalina close enough for the boys to catch the  line that came singing out through the hull door. Another couple of  moments and they were both way out on the Swordfish's left lower wing  and scrambling aboard the Catalina.    \"Dawson and Farmer, of course?\" asked the sergeant gunner who helped  them aboard.    \"Check!\" Dave gulped. \"And were we glad to see this job. We were  getting the feeling that we'd soon be food for those sharks that were  gathering around.\"    \"Nasty devils, those man eaters in these waters, sir,\" the Sergeant  said, and stepped around Dave. \"Stand clear, sir. I'm tossing a little  time bomb into the Fairey. No sense having it float around for some  johnny to run into. There! There we are.\"    A pang of sadness touched Dave's heart as he watched the small time  bomb arc from the Sergeant's hand and plop down into the cockpit of  the Fairey Swordfish. True, the seaplane was a total loss. The engine  was a tangled mass of junk, and not worth salvage efforts. Besides,  the pontoon was filling fast, and it wouldn't be long before the craft  would be three quarters submerged and a menace to navigation in those  waters. Yes, it was best to blow it up and sink it below the surface  of the China Sea. Yet a plane had always been to Dave something that  was almost alive, and human. It always hurt a little bit to see one of  man's air creations destroyed. Yes, even when destruction was necessary.    And so as the time bomb plopped down into the cockpit Dave swallowed  hard, gave the doomed plane a quick little salute of honor, and then  faced the Sergeant again.    \"Say, is Air Vice Marshal Bostworth at Singapore, Sergeant?\" he asked.  \"Boy, I've got the yen to tear a mile wide strip off him when we meet.  We've been floating around for over five hours. Did you know that? He  said that.... What's the matter?\"    Dave stopped short and asked the last because the Sergeant had suddenly  stiffened and gone pale under the heavy tan on his face.    \"Fancy you can speak to the Air Vice Marshal personally, sir,\" the  Sergeant said in a hoarse whisper. \"He's just behind you, waiting in  the navigation compartment.\"    \"He's _what_?\" Dave gasped and felt his knees go rubbery and weak.          CHAPTER FIVE    _Official Explanations_      It was only the matter of a couple of seconds, but it seemed to Dave  Dawson that it was a hundred years before he could dig up strength  enough to turn around. When he did he saw the tall, thin faced figure  of Air Vice Marshal Bostworth seated in the navigator's chair not ten  feet from where he stood. The high ranking officer's eyes were slightly  narrowed, and there was a glittering chill in their depths that made  Dave wonder if he hadn't better just push open the Catalina's hull door  and jump out to the sharks. Maybe they would be easier on him.    \"Come in, you two, and shut the door!\" the senior officer suddenly  snapped. Then looking past the two rescued pilots, he added, \"That's  all, Sergeant. Tell Flight Lieutenant Baker to take off and go to  maximum ceiling and cruise about until further orders. Hop to it, man!\"    The Sergeant sprang into action, and so did Dave and Freddy. They  stepped quickly into the navigation room and closed the door behind  them. Dave gulped a couple of times and took the plunge.    \"Sorry, sir, I guess I spoke out of turn,\" he said lamely. \"It was  dumb.\"    Air Vice Marshal Bostworth gave him a look that could cut right through  steel.    \"Very dumb, Flight Lieutenant, to use your native tongue!\" he snapped.  Then wiping the anger from his face, and grinning, he said, \"But, I  can't say I blame you. Would have been a bit put out, myself, if I'd  been in your place. However, it was something that couldn't be helped.  But sit down, sit down, you two. A spot of coffee, or tea, or rum, or  something? It must have been a bit of an ordeal for you.\"    \"Nothing for me, sir,\" Freddy spoke up. \"I'm quite all right, sir.\"    \"Me, too,\" Dave said with a nod. \"But, holy.... I mean, it was  certainly a surprise to learn that you were out here, sir. I thought  the Harkness' captain was kidding me at first. And as for what's  happened since he told us, well.... Well, we're both in a sweet flat  spin.\"    The senior officer started to speak but checked himself as there came  the faint _crump_ of the exploding time bomb above the roar of the  Catalina's engines as the pilot up forward took her off the water and  aloft. As though by mutual agreement all three in the navigation room  glanced down out of the porthole at the disc of frothy white water that  marked where the Fairey Swordfish had met her end.    \"Well, that's one less plane England has,\" Air Vice Marshal Bostworth  said with a sad note in his voice.    \"And I'd rather not meet up with Captain Standers for a while,\" Dave  grunted. \"Darn that submarine! It....\"    He cut himself off short as the Air Vice Marshal whirled around and  stared at him wide eyed.    \"Submarine?\" the senior officer echoed sharply. \"What the devil are  you talking about? Weren't you shot down by plane? A plane with R.A.F.  markings? That's what I imagined.\"    \"Plane?\" Dave himself echoed. \"Gosh, no! We saw some signals, and  wondered what....\"    \"Wait a minute,\" the Air Vice Marshal stopped him. \"Perhaps you'd  better begin at the beginning, and tell me everything. Every little  detail, and don't leave out a thing. Start with when Captain Standers,  of the Harkness, summoned you to his quarters to give you my orders  for a two hour patrol.\"    Dave glanced at Freddy, but the English youth shook his head.    \"You tell it, Dave,\" he said.    Dave shrugged, stared at his two hands for a moment to get things  arranged in his own mind, and then told detail for detail of their  movements and actions from the time they were summoned by the commander  of the Harkness, right up to when they scrambled aboard the patrol  Catalina. Air Vice Marshal Bostworth listened in silence, but the frown  on his face deepened as Dave talked along. And by the time the Yank  born R.A.F. ace had finished his little speech there was both anger  and worry glowing in the senior officer's eyes. Even when Dave finally  stopped talking he didn't say a thing for several long moments. He sat  puffing hard on a thin stemmed pipe he clutched between his teeth and  scowled darkly at the clouds of blue smoke that curled upward.    \"Damnedest thing ever!\" he finally muttered. \"A Jap sub, eh? Of course  it was a Jap, right enough. We've suspected that they've been sneaking  close into these waters whenever they got the chance. But to come to  the surface and blast away at you chaps! Well.... Well, I'll be blessed  if that isn't a new one. Quite sure you couldn't make head nor tail  out of their heliograph signals, eh?\"    \"Quite, sir,\" Freddy said quietly.    \"Not a single blink meant a thing,\" Dave said with a curt shake of his  head. \"They certainly weren't any Morse letters or numbers that I ever  learned.\"    \"A code of their own, no doubt,\" Air Vice Marshal Bostworth grunted.  \"Well, before I start my little tale let me explain why you had to  float around so long. Only I and the Admiral commanding knew that I'd  radioed those orders to the Harkness, you see? I had expected to be  at the Air Base to meet you but I got tied up on an inspection tour  of some emergency fields on the Johore side, and didn't get back  until long after I expected to. It gave me a bit of a start, I can  tell you, not to find you waiting, and to see the Harkness riding at  anchor in the Strait. Went aboard at once and received another start  when I learned you had taken off. So I hurried ashore, routed out this  Catalina crew, and came hunting for you. Thank God, we got to you in  time!\"    \"We were beginning to feel less happy by the second, sir,\" Dave said  with an apologetic grin. \"But one thing I can't figure is, why weren't  there patrol planes out? Why didn't some other plane pick us up long  before then? But we didn't see a single plane or surface ship during  the whole time. We.... Hey! England's not at war with Japan, is she?\"    \"Not a declared war by either side, anyway,\" Air Vice Marshal Bostworth  replied gravely. \"However, we are watching each other like a couple of  strange cats. And if you want my opinion on the matter I think the Japs  are going to have a go at us inside of ten days at the most.\"    Dave stiffened slightly and glanced at the calendar hanging on the  compartment wall. It told him that today was the sixth of December,  Nineteen Hundred and Forty-One. He looked at Freddy and gave him a sly  wink, and then turned to the Air Vice Marshal.    \"Then that's why you came out from England in a hurry, eh?\" he  murmured. \"The Japs are actually going to be saps, huh?\"    The Air Intelligence officer smiled faintly at Dawson's remark, but  shook his head and raised a cautioning finger.    \"That is the spirit, Dawson,\" he said, \"but don't be carried away by  the belief that the Japs would ... would be push-overs, as they say in  your country. As a matter of fact, the one mistake we have made most in  this blasted war, and during the years leading up to it, too, has been  to underestimate the strength and ability of the enemy. The Japs may be  saps, as you say, but that won't stop them from attacking if they think  they hold the winning hand. And I'm afraid they do believe they hold  it.\"    \"But they would be bashing their crazy heads against a stone wall!\"  Freddy Farmer protested. \"I mean if they dared to have a go at  Singapore. I've always been told that Singapore is every bit as  impregnable as Gibraltar.\"    \"From sea attack, yes,\" Air Vice Marshal Bostworth said. \"But from  the air? That is something else again. And as far"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5067"],[0,"The Rainbow Trail (#6)"],[1,"ford, indicating the Indian.    \"Nas Ta Bega,\" answered the Indian.    \"Navajo?\"    The Indian bowed with what seemed pride and stately dignity.    \"My name John Shefford. Come far way back toward rising sun. Come stay  here long.\"    Nas Ta Bega's dark eyes were fixed steadily upon Shefford. He reflected  that he could not remember having felt so penetrating a gaze. But  neither the Indian's eyes nor face gave any clue to his thoughts.    \"Navajo no savvy Jesus Christ,\" said the Indian, and his voice rolled  out low and deep.    Shefford felt both amaze and pain. The Indian had taken him for a  missionary.    \"No!... Me no missionary,\" cried Shefford, and he flung up a  passionately repudiating hand.    A singular flash shot from the Indian's dark eyes. It struck Shefford  even at this stinging moment when the past came back.    \"Trade--buy wool--blanket?\" queried Nas Ta Bega.    \"No,\" replied Shefford. \"Me want ride--walk far.\" He waved his hand to  indicate a wide sweep of territory. \"Me sick.\"    Nas Ta Bega laid a significant finger upon his lungs.    \"No,\" replied Shefford. \"Me strong. Sick here.\" And with motions of his  hands he tried to show that his was a trouble of the heart.    Shefford received instant impression of this Indian's intelligent  comprehension, but he could not tell just what had given him the  feeling. Nas Ta Bega rose then and walked away into the shadow. Shefford  heard him working around the dead cedar-tree, where he had probably gone  to get fire-wood. Then Shefford heard a splintering crash, which was  followed by a crunching, bumping sound. Presently he was astounded to  see the Indian enter the lighted circle dragging the whole cedar-tree,  trunk first. Shefford would have doubted the ability of two men to drag  that tree, and here came Nas Ta Bega, managing it easily. He laid the  trunk on the fire, and then proceeded to break off small branches, to  place them advantageously where the red coals kindled them into a blaze.    The Indian's next move was to place his saddle, which he evidently meant  to use for a pillow. Then he spread a goat-skin on the ground, lay  down upon it, with his back to the fire, and, pulling a long-haired  saddle-blanket over his shoulders, he relaxed and became motionless. His  sister, Glen Naspa, did likewise, except that she stayed farther away  from the fire, and she had a larger blanket, which covered her well. It  appeared to Shefford that they went to sleep at once.    Shefford felt as tired as he had ever been, but he did not think he  could soon drop into slumber, and in fact he did not want to.    There was something in the companionship of these Indians that he had  not experienced before. He still had a strange and weak feeling--the  aftermath of that fear which had sickened him with its horrible icy  grip. Nas Ta Bega's arrival had frightened away that dark and silent  prowler of the night; and Shefford was convinced the Indian had saved  his life. The measure of his gratitude was a source of wonder to him.  Had he cared so much for life? Yes--he had, when face to face with  death. That was something to know. It helped him. And he gathered from  his strange feeling that the romantic quest which had brought him  into the wilderness might turn out to be an antidote for the morbid  bitterness of heart.    With new sensations had come new thoughts. Right then it was very  pleasant to sit in the warmth and light of the roaring cedar fire. There  was a deep-seated ache of fatigue in his bones. What joy it was to rest!  He had felt the dry scorch of desert thirst and the pang of hunger.  How wonderful to learn the real meaning of water and food! He had just  finished the longest, hardest day's work of his life! Had that anything  to do with a something almost like peace which seemed to hover near in  the shadows, trying to come to him? He had befriended an Indian girl,  and now her brother had paid back the service. Both the giving and  receiving were somehow sweet to Shefford. They opened up hitherto vague  channels of thought. For years he had imagined he was serving people,  when he had never lifted a hand. A blow given in the defense of an  Indian girl had somehow operated to make a change in John Shefford's  existence. It had liberated a spirit in him. Moreover, it had worked its  influence outside his mind. The Indian girl and her brother had followed  his trail to return his horse, perhaps to guide him safely, but,  unknowingly perhaps, they had done infinitely more than that for him. As  Shefford's eye wandered over the dark, still figures of the sleepers he  had a strange, dreamy premonition, or perhaps only a fancy, that there  was to be more come of this fortunate meeting.    For the rest, it was good to be there in the speaking silence, to feel  the heat on his outstretched palms and the cold wind on his cheek, to  see the black wall lifting its bold outline and the crags reaching for  the white stars.          III. KAYENTA      The stamping of horses awoke Shefford. He saw a towering crag, rosy  in the morning light, like a huge red spear splitting the clear blue  of sky. He got up, feeling cramped and sore, yet with unfamiliar  exhilaration. The whipping air made him stretch his hands to the fire.  An odor of coffee and broiled meat mingled with the fragrance of wood  smoke. Glen Naspa was on her knees broiling a rabbit on a stick over the  red coals. Nas Ta Bega was saddling the ponies. The canyon appeared  to be full of purple shadows under one side of dark cliffs and golden  streaks of mist on the other where the sun struck high up on the walls.    \"Good morning,\" said Shefford.    Glen Naspa shyly replied in Navajo.    \"How,\" was Nas Ta Bega's greeting.    In daylight the Indian lost some of the dark somberness of face that had  impressed Shefford. He had a noble head, in poise like that of an eagle,  a bold, clean-cut profile, and stern, close-shut lips. His eyes were the  most striking and attractive feature about him; they were coal-black  and piercing; the intent look out of them seemed to come from a keen and  inquisitive mind.    Shefford ate breakfast with the Indians, and then helped with the few  preparations for departure. Before they mounted, Nas Ta Bega pointed  to horse tracks in the dust. They were those that had been made by  Shefford's threatening visitor of the night before. Shefford explained  by word and sign, and succeeded at least in showing that he had been  in danger. Nas Ta Bega followed the tracks a little way and presently  returned.    \"Shadd,\" he said, with an ominous shake of his head. Shefford did not  understand whether he meant the name of his visitor or something else,  but the menace connected with the word was clear enough.    Glen Naspa mounted her pony, and it was a graceful action that pleased  Shefford. He climbed a little stiffly into his own saddle. Then Nas Ta  Bega got up and pointed northward.    \"Kayenta?\" he inquired.    Shefford nodded and then they were off, with Glen Naspa in the lead.  They did not climb the trail which they had descended, but took one  leading to the right along the base of the slope. Shefford saw down into  the red wash that bisected the canyon floor. It was a sheer wall of  red clay or loam, a hundred feet high, and at the bottom ran a swift,  shallow stream of reddish water. Then for a time a high growth of  greasewood hid the surroundings from Shefford's sight. Presently the  trail led out into the open, and Shefford saw that he was at the neck of  a wonderful valley that gradually widened with great jagged red peaks on  the left and the black mesa, now a mountain, running away to the right.  He turned to find that the opening of the Sagi could no longer be seen,  and he was conscious of a strong desire to return and explore that  canyon.    Soon Glen Naspa put her pony to a long, easy, swinging canter and her  followers did likewise. As they got outward into the valley Shefford  lost the sense of being overshadowed and crowded by the nearness of  the huge walls and crags. The trail appeared level underfoot, but at a  distance it was seen to climb. Shefford found where it disappeared over  the foot of a slope that formed a graceful rising line up to the  cedared flank of the mesa. The valley floor, widening away to the north,  remained level and green. Beyond rose the jagged range of red peaks,  all strangely cut and slanting. These distant deceiving features of  the country held Shefford's gaze until the Indian drew his attention  to things near at hand. Then Shefford saw flocks of sheep dotting  the gray-green valley, and bands of beautiful long-maned, long-tailed  ponies.    For several miles the scene did not change except that Shefford imagined  he came to see where the upland plain ended or at least broke its level.  He was right, for presently the Indian pointed, and Shefford went on to  halt upon the edge of a steep slope leading down into a valley vast in  its barren gray reaches.    \"Kayenta,\" said Nas Ta Bega.    Shefford at first saw nothing except the monotonous gray valley reaching  far to the strange, grotesque monuments of yellow cliff. Then close  under the foot of the slope he espied two squat stone houses with red  roofs, and a corral with a pool of water shining in the sun.    The trail leading down was steep and sandy, but it was not long.  Shefford's sweeping eyes appeared to take in everything at once--the  crude stone structures with their earthen roofs, the piles of dirty  wool, the Indians lolling around, the tents, and wagons, and horses,  little lazy burros and dogs, and scattered everywhere saddles, blankets,  guns, and packs.    Then a white man came out of the door. He waved a hand and shouted.  Dust and wool and flour were thick upon him. He was muscular and  weather-beaten, and appeared young in activity rather than face. A gun  swung at his hip and a row of brass-tipped cartridges showed in his  belt. Shefford looked"]]]
