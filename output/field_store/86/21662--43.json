You have great need, learned Doctor,           To be sent again to school.    _Faust._ Leave me!    _Mep._   Deign first to listen for a moment,           To the speech she rehearses to the stars.           Dear master, delay. She opens her window.

The night-bird's song,           The evening breeze,           All nature's sounds together say,           \"He loves thee!\"           Ah! sweet, sweet indeed           Now is this life to me!           Another world it seems;           The very ecstasy of love is this!           With to-morrow's dawn,           Haste thee, oh dear one,           Haste thee to return! Yes, come!    _Faust._           (rushing to the window, and grasping her hand).               Marguerite!    MAR.

Marguerite!    _Mar._   Siebel!    _Sie._                What, weeping still!    _Mar._   Alas! thou alone art kind to me.    _Sie._   A mere youth am I.           And yet I have a manly heart,           And I will sure avenge thee.           The seducer's life shall forfeit pay.    _Mar._                    Whose life?    _Sie._   Need I name him? The wretch           Who thus hast deserted thee!    _Mar._   In mercy, speak not thus!    _Sie._   Dost love him still, then?    _Mar._   Ay, I love him still!           But not to you, good Siebel, should I repeat this tale.    _Sie._                          I.           When all was young, and pleasant May was blooming,           I, thy poor friend, took part with thee in play;           Now that the cloud of autumn dark is glooming,           Now is for me, too, mournful the day.           Hope and delight have passed from life away.                            II.           We were not born with true love to trifle,           Nor born to part because the wind blows cold.           What though the storm the summer garden rifle,           Oh, Marguerite! oh, Marguerite!           Still on the bough is left a leaf of gold.    _Mar._   Bless you, my friend, your sympathy is sweet.           The cruel ones who wrong me thus           Cannot close against me           The gates of the holy temple.           Thither will I go to pray           For him and for our child.

Permit thy lowly handmaiden           To prostrate herself before thine altar.    _Mep._   No, thou shalt not pray!           Spirits of evil, haste ye at my call,           And drive this woman hence!    _Cho. of Demons._    Marguerite!    _Mar._   Who calls me?    _Cho._   Marguerite!    _Mar._   I tremble!--oh, heaven!           My last hour is surely nigh!        (The tomb opens and discloses MEPHISTOPHELES,    who bends over to MARGUERITE's ear.)    _Mep._   Remember the glorious days           When an angel's wings           Protected thy young heart.           To church thou camest then to worship,           Nor hadst thou then sinned 'gainst heaven.           Thy prayers then issued           From an unstained heart           And on the wings of faith           Did rise to the Creator.           Hear'st thou their call?           'Tis hell that summons thee!           Hell claims thee for its own!           Eternal pain, and woe, and tribulation,           Will be thy portion!    _Mar._   Heaven! what voice is this           That in the shade doth speak to me?           What mysterious tones are these!    _Religious Cho._ When the last day shall have come,           The cross in heaven shall shine forth,           This world to dust shall crumble.    _Mar._   Ah me! more fearful still becomes their song.    _Mep._   No pardon hath heaven left for thee!           For thee e'en heaven hath no more light!    _Religious Cho._ What shall we say unto high heav'n?           Who shall protection find           When innocence such persecution meets?    _Mar._   A heavy weight my breast o'erpowers,--           I can no longer breathe!    _Mep._   Nights of love, farewell!           Ye days of joy, adieu!           Lost, lost for aye art thou!    _Mar. and Cho._           Heav'n! hear thou the prayer           Of a sad, broken heart!           A bright ray send thou           From the starry sphere           Her anguish to allay!    _Mep._   Marguerite, lost, lost art thou!    _Mar._                           Ah!

Sorrowing mothers no longer           Will bewail their absent sons.                *       *       *       *       *      SCENE IV.

(embracing him).           And Marguerite?    _Sie._          (confused).           Perhaps she's yonder at the church.    _Val._   She doubtless prays for my return.           Dear girl, how pleased           She'll be to hear me tell           My warlike deeds!    _Cho._   Glory to those who in battle fall,           Their bright deeds we can with pride recall.           May we, then, honor and fame acquire,           Their glorious deeds our hearts will inspire!           For that dear native land where we first drew breath,           Her sons, at her command proudly brave e'en death.           At their sacred demand who on us depend,           Our swords we will draw, their rights to defend.           Homeward our steps we now will turn,--           Joy and peace await us there!           On, on at once, nor loiter here;           On, then, our lov'd ones to embrace,--           Affection calls, fond love doth summon us,           Yes, many a heart will beat           When they our tale shall hear.    _Val._   Come, Siebel, we'll to my dwelling           And o'er a flask of wine hold converse.               (Approaching MARGUERITE'S house.)    _Sie._   Nay, enter not!    _Val._   Why not, I pray?--Thou turn'st away;           Thy silent glance doth seek the ground--           Speak, Siebel--what hath happened?    _Sie._                  (with an effort.)           No! I cannot tell thee!    _Val._ What mean'st thou?                 (Rushing toward house.)      _Sie._                    (withholding him.)           Hold, good Valentine, take heart!    _Val._   What is't thou mean'st!                    (Enters the house.)    _Sie._   Forgive her!           Shield her, gracious Heaven!

I grieve to think that I           Brought shame and sorrow hither.    _Mep._   Why see her again, then, after leaving her?           Some other sight might be more pleasing.           To the sabbath let us on.    _Faust_                       (sighing).           Oh, Marguerite!    _Mep._   My advice, I know,           Availeth but little           Against thy stubborn will.           Doctor, you need my voice!       (Throwing back his mantle, and accompanying himself on the guitar.)                            I.           Maiden, now in peace reposing,           From thy sleep awake,           Hear my voice with love imploring,           Wilt thou pity take?           But beware how thou confidest           Even in thy friend,           Ha! ha! ha!           If not for thy wedding finger           He a ring doth send.                            II.           Yes, sweet maiden, I implore thee,--           Oh, refuse not this,--           Smile on him who doth adore thee,           Bless him with thy kiss.

PHILO was proceeding in this vehement manner, somewhat between jest and  earnest, as it appeared to me, when he observed some signs of impatience  in CLEANTHES, and then immediately stopped short. What I had to suggest,  said CLEANTHES, is only that you would not abuse terms, or make use of  popular expressions to subvert philosophical reasonings. You know, that  the vulgar often distinguish reason from experience, even where the  question relates only to matter of fact and existence; though it is  found, where that reason is properly analysed, that it is nothing but a  species of experience. To prove by experience the origin of the universe  from mind, is not more contrary to common speech, than to prove the  motion of the earth from the same principle. And a caviller might raise  all the same objections to the Copernican system, which you have urged  against my reasonings. Have you other earths, might he say, which you  have seen to move? Have...    Yes! cried PHILO, interrupting him, we have other earths. Is not the moon  another earth, which we see to turn round its centre? Is not Venus  another earth, where we observe the same phenomenon? Are not the  revolutions of the sun also a confirmation, from analogy, of the same  theory? All the planets, are they not earths, which revolve about the  sun? Are not the satellites moons, which move round Jupiter and Saturn,  and along with these primary planets round the sun? These analogies and  resemblances, with others which I have not mentioned, are the sole proofs  of the COPERNICAN system; and to you it belongs to consider, whether you  have any analogies of the same kind to support your theory.    In reality, CLEANTHES, continued he, the modern system of astronomy is  now so much received by all inquirers, and has become so essential a part  even of our earliest education, that we are not commonly very scrupulous  in examining the reasons upon which it is founded. It is now become a  matter of mere curiosity to study the first writers on that subject, who  had the full force of prejudice to encounter, and were obliged to turn  their arguments on every side in order to render them popular and  convincing. But if we peruse GALILEO's famous Dialogues concerning the  system of the world, we shall find, that that great genius, one of the  sublimest that ever existed, first bent all his endeavours to prove, that  there was no foundation for the distinction commonly made between  elementary and celestial substances. The schools, proceeding from the  illusions of sense, had carried this distinction very far; and had  established the latter substances to be ingenerable, incorruptible,  unalterable, impassable; and had assigned all the opposite qualities to  the former. But GALILEO, beginning with the moon, proved its similarity  in every particular to the earth; its convex figure, its natural darkness  when not illuminated, its density, its distinction into solid and liquid,  the variations of its phases, the mutual illuminations of the earth and  moon, their mutual eclipses, the inequalities of the lunar surface, &c.  After many instances of this kind, with regard to all the planets, men  plainly saw that these bodies became proper objects of experience; and  that the similarity of their nature enabled us to extend the same  arguments and phenomena from one to the other.    In this cautious proceeding of the astronomers, you may read your own  condemnation, CLEANTHES; or rather may see, that the subject in which you  are engaged exceeds all human reason and inquiry. Can you pretend to show  any such similarity between the fabric of a house, and the generation of  a universe? Have you ever seen nature in any such situation as resembles  the first arrangement of the elements? Have worlds ever been formed under  your eye; and have you had leisure to observe the whole progress of the  phenomenon, from the first appearance of order to its final consummation?  If you have, then cite your experience, and deliver your theory.          PART 3      How the most absurd argument, replied CLEANTHES, in the hands of a man of  ingenuity and invention, may acquire an air of probability! Are you not  aware, PHILO, that it became necessary for Copernicus and his first  disciples to prove the similarity of the terrestrial and celestial  matter; because several philosophers, blinded by old systems, and  supported by some sensible appearances, had denied this similarity? but  that it is by no means necessary, that Theists should prove the  similarity of the works of Nature to those of Art; because this  similarity is self-evident and undeniable? The same matter, a like form;  what more is requisite to show an analogy between their causes, and to  ascertain the origin of all things from a divine purpose and intention?  Your objections, I must freely tell you, are no better than the abstruse  cavils of those philosophers who denied motion; and ought to be refuted  in the same manner, by illustrations, examples, and instances, rather  than by serious argument and philosophy.    Suppose, therefore, that an articulate voice were heard in the clouds,  much louder and more melodious than any which human art could ever reach:  Suppose, that this voice were extended in the same instant over all  nations, and spoke to each nation in its own language and dialect:  Suppose, that the words delivered not only contain a just sense and  meaning, but convey some instruction altogether worthy of a benevolent  Being, superior to mankind: Could you possibly hesitate a moment  concerning the cause of this voice? and must you not instantly ascribe it  to some design or purpose? Yet I cannot see but all the same objections  (if they merit that appellation) which lie against the system of Theism,  may also be produced against this inference.    Might you not say, that all conclusions concerning fact were founded on  experience: that when we hear an articulate voice in the dark, and thence  infer a man, it is only the resemblance of the effects which leads us to  conclude that there is a like resemblance in the cause: but that this  extraordinary voice, by its loudness, extent, and flexibility to all  languages, bears so little analogy to any human voice, that we have no  reason to suppose any analogy in their causes: and consequently, that a  rational, wise, coherent speech proceeded, you know not whence, from some  accidental whistling of the winds, not from any divine reason or  intelligence? You see clearly your own objections in these cavils, and I  hope too you see clearly, that they cannot possibly have more force in  the one case than in the other.    But to bring the case still nearer the present one of the universe, I  shall make two suppositions, which imply not any absurdity or  impossibility. Suppose that there is a natural, universal, invariable  language, common to every individual of human race; and that books are  natural productions, which perpetuate themselves in the same manner with  animals and vegetables, by descent and propagation. Several expressions  of our passions contain a universal language: all brute animals have a  natural speech, which, however limited, is very intelligible to their own  species. And as there are infinitely fewer parts and less contrivance in  the finest composition of eloquence, than in the coarsest organised body,  the propagation of an Iliad or Aeneid is an easier supposition than that  of any plant or animal.    Suppose, therefore, that you enter into your library, thus peopled by  natural volumes, containing the most refined reason and most exquisite  beauty; could you possibly open one of them, and doubt, that its original  cause bore the strongest analogy to mind and intelligence? When it  reasons and discourses; when it expostulates, argues, and enforces its  views and topics; when it applies sometimes to the pure intellect,  sometimes to the affections; when it collects, disposes, and adorns every  consideration suited to the subject; could you persist in asserting, that  all this, at the bottom, had really no meaning; and that the first  formation of this volume in the loins of its original parent proceeded  not from thought and design? Your obstinacy, I know, reaches not that  degree of firmness: even your sceptical play and wantonness would be  abashed at so glaring an absurdity.    But if there be any difference, PHILO, between this supposed case and the  real one of the universe, it is all to the advantage of the latter. The  anatomy of an animal affords many stronger instances of design than the  perusal of LIVY or TACITUS; and any objection which you start in the  former case, by carrying me back to so unusual and extraordinary a scene  as the first formation of worlds, the same objection has place on the  supposition of our vegetating library. Choose, then, your party, PHILO,  without ambiguity or evasion; assert either that a rational volume is no  proof of a rational cause, or admit of a similar cause to all the works  of nature.    Let me here observe too, continued CLEANTHES, that this religious  argument, instead of being weakened by that scepticism so much affected  by you, rather acquires force from it, and becomes more firm and  undisputed. To exclude all argument or reasoning of every kind, is either  affectation or madness. The declared profession of every reasonable  sceptic is only to reject abstruse, remote, and refined arguments; to  adhere to common sense and the plain instincts of nature; and to assent,  wherever any reasons strike him with so full a force that he cannot,  without the greatest violence, prevent it. Now the arguments for Natural  Religion are plainly of this kind; and nothing but the most perverse,  obstinate metaphysics can reject them. Consider, anatomise the eye;  survey its structure and contrivance; and tell me, from your own feeling,  if the idea of a"]]]
