Then she multiplied that by the number of wounded men in  each car, and so she knew how many thousands had been badly wounded. But  how was she to get that number across the line?\"    \"Paste it on her spectacle,\" suggested Tillie.    \"Not this time, she didn't,\" Alice smiled. \"She wrote it on a paper and  hid it. You'd never guess where.\"    \"In her shoe--in her glove--in her hair,\" Tillie exploded.    \"Nope. None of these.\" Alice shook her head. \"Let me tell you all about  it, then you may guess.\"    \"Al--all right.\" Tillie drew a long breath as she settled back.    \"You see,\" said Alice, \"Louise was going down a dark road in the night.  In one hand she carried her bag of laces, in the other a lantern. It was  a tin lantern. The tin was all full of holes. Inside a candle flickered.  It didn't give much light, just enough. Suddenly a gruff voice  commanded:    \"'Halt!'    \"Louise was taken to a rough cabin where a short broad German spy woman  lived. Everyone called her Le Grenouille, the frog. Louise and Charlotte  feared and hated her.    \"'Take off your clothes', that's what the Frog said to Louise.    \"Before obeying, Louise carefully blew out the candle in her lantern,  then set it in the corner.    \"All her clothes were taken off. Everything was searched,--dress,  stockings, shoes,--everything. Nothing was found.    \"'All right. You may dress and be gone,' said the Frog.    \"When Louise had dressed she went on her way. That night our High  Commander way across the line in France knew how many Germans had been  wounded in that battle.\"    \"Louise, the spy, had told him,\" Peggy whispered.    \"She showed them the paper on which the number had been written,\" said  Alice. \"Where do you think it was hidden?\"    \"In her basket!\" Tillie cried.    \"No.\"    \"In her hair,\" Tillie guessed again.    \"I know!\" Peggy jumped up and down. \"In her candle!\"    \"Good! That's right! How did you guess?\" Alice's face shone.    \"She--\" Peggy did not finish. At that instant old Flash leapt from his  corner, dashed up to the window which was above his head, and barked  angrily.    At the same instant Tillie cried: \"We do have a spy on our farm! I saw  his face in the window! Saw him plain as day!\"    They all rushed to the kitchen where the others were talking. A few  excited words and the boys, with Flash at their heels, were out  searching in the night.    But for one thing they might have succeeded in making a capture. The  moment they stepped outside, the sky was lit by a sudden flash. Then  came the roar of an explosion.    \"They're at it again,\" Young Lord murmured.    \"Here Flash!\" Brand called. \"Go find him!\" But Flash only whined at his  feet. The roar of that distant explosion had paralyzed him. And so, in  the end they returned empty handed.    \"Aunt Alice,\" Peggy whispered as she was being tucked in bed, \"will you  tell us more about those lady spies?\"    \"Sometime perhaps,\" was the quiet reply.                                       _Chapter_ VII                               Enemy Sighted      After they returned from the futile search the three of them, Dave,  Brand and the Young Lord stood for a time beside the car. They had  talked for a moment. Then Brand walked away to the barn for one more  look about before he retired for the night. It had been a strange,  exciting and momentous day. Nothing quite like it had ever happened at  Ramsey Farm before. He felt restless and ill at ease.    After he had gone the Young Lord asked Dave a strange question:    \"What are you doing in England?\"    \"Why--I--nothing really,\" Dave hesitated. \"You see my uncle is in the  news service here. He was coming over in the Clipper. He invited me to  come along. So here I am. Perhaps it wasn't quite as simple as all that,  but he fixed it up.\"    \"I see,\" the Young Lord murmured.    Did he? Dave doubted that. He made a second start. \"You see I've had two  years in college. Didn't like it any too well, the class-room part. Oh,  math was well enough. In fact I really liked it. But the rest,\" he  heaved a sigh. \"Well, I majored mostly in football, basketball, tennis  and golf. So--oo,\"    \"So they didn't care much whether you stayed on?\"    \"I suppose not. Anyway, all the colleges in America have been crammed  with fellows who haven't anything else to do but go to college now,--\"    \"All that will change fast,\" said the Young Lord. \"The way things are  going over there now those boys are going to have things to do. Ever do  any flying?\" he asked abruptly.    \"Yes--a little--quite a bit in fact. Uncle was a flyer in the World War.  Not an ace exactly, but he got to like flying. He's always had a flying  crate or two about, and naturally I had to have a turn at them.\"    The Young Lord guessed, and quite shrewdly too, that Dave was being too  modest about his flying.    \"I'm trying out a new plane tomorrow,\" he said slowly. \"It's a  two-seater. Want to go up? Just a little sky patrol. Nothing's likely to  happen.\"    Dave seemed to see that Tomahawk of the afternoon plunging downward  apparently headed for destruction. He wanted to say \"no\". For some  reason his tongue wouldn't form the word. So he said:    \"Yes. Sure. I'd like to.\"    \"Righto.\" The Young Lord reached for the door of his big old English  car. \"I'll be after you in this bus at 10:00 A. M.\"    His motor roared. He was away.    \"Now why did I say that?\" Dave asked himself aloud.    \"Say what?\" He started. Brand was at his side.    \"I promised to go up with Applegate tomorrow.\"    \"Sayee! That's corking! Just what I'd like to do! In fact,\" Brand's tone  was sober, \"I want to join up. Since this afternoon I want to more than  ever. Mother objects. Says I'm needed to manage the farm. Says the army  needs our butter and fat cattle. This farm! Of course, we love it. All  of us do. But when all of England is threatened--when the others are  doing their bit--to be tied to the sail! God!\" Brand stamped his foot.    \"It's all the way you think, I guess.\" Dave laughed lightly. \"Well, I'll  be up having a look at your native land from the clouds in the morning.  So, goodnight.\" Half an hour later, in his bed beneath the rafters of  that ancient house, Dave was asking himself: \"Why did I come to  England?\"    The answer seemed simple enough. This war was too big to miss--that  is--miss seeing. But why had he persuaded Cherry to go with him to  London where bombs were falling? Why had he promised to go up with the  Young Lord in the morning? He did not know the answers. All he knew was  that he felt like a fly caught in a web. The web did not have a very  strong hold on him yet. He could break away if he wished. But did he  wish? Not knowing the answer, he fell asleep.    In another corner of that broad upstairs, her door leading into the  children's room ajar, Alice was hearing a shrill childish voice cry:    \"You're a spy, a little lady spy. I'm a frog, a great big black frog.  I'm going to swallow you--swallow you right down. Here I come!\"    This was followed by a low, half-suppressed exclamation, a giggle, then  a loud \"Shish.\" After that all was silent.    Alice was nearly asleep when suddenly from far overhead there came the  roar of powerful motors. London was in for one more beating. Would those  terrible bombings never end?    It was with a strange thrill tickling his spine that Dave climbed into  the rear of the lord's two-seater plane the next day. This, he knew, was  a fighting plane, his very first. This plane carried a sting in its  nose, eight guns capable of firing nearly ten thousand shots per minute.    \"Of course,\" he thought, \"this is broad daylight. Not much chance of  picking up an enemy. And yet, there's yesterday.\"    After fastening his safety belt with great care, he waited for the  takeoff. It came with a roar. They were in the air. Some ship!    He studied it with great care. It had a dual control. If something  happened, just happened to go wrong with the Young Lord, he could bring  the ship to earth. He might, in a pinch, do a great deal more. The  firing of those guns seemed simple. He had had a great deal more flying  experience than he was willing to admit,--at least 200 hours.    Seeming to read his thoughts, Applegate gave a slight squeeze at his  firing button. In no uncertain tones the guns spoke. Dave was thrilled  to his fingertips.    He began studying the electric switches, the emergency boost, the petrol  switch, the air-speed indicator, the directional gyro, the climb  indicator, and all the other instruments. A born mechanic, he could  study these out one by one, eliminate the ones least needed, then  picture himself guiding the ship.    Watching a mirror, studying his face, Applegate nodded in approval to  the sky. As they climbed to 10,000 feet Dave saw London in the distance.  Smoke hung over it. There had been a bombing, fires started. Homes of  simple, honest, hard-working people who had not asked for this war had  been destroyed. He hated all that.    White clouds, like distant snowbanks, were drifting through the blue as  blue sky.    \"Take her for a minute, will you?\" The Young Lord spoke in a  matter-of-fact voice.    Dave's hands trembled as he gripped the controls. He kept the ship going  on an even keel while his companion, after unstrapping heavy binoculars,  studied the sky.    Suddenly Applegate threw out a hand. Swinging it to the right, he  directed Dave into a fluffy white cloud.    \"That's it,\" he approved. \"Now just lurk around in here for a bit.\"    With a tickling sensation at the back of his neck Dave \"loitered round\".  At the same time he was asking himself, \"Why did I let myself in for  this?\"    Twice they came out of the cloud, but on the wrong side. At last, after  one more wave of the lord's hand, Dave headed straight out, on the side  from which they had entered.    He caught his breath sharply as, on breaking out into blue sky, he  sighted an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4932"],[0,"A Knight of the White Cross: A Tale of the Siege of Rhodes (#6)"],[1,"soon. We must hope that he will not  be able to do this. He cannot tell whether we intend to march direct to  London, or to join Pembroke in Wales, or to march north, and until he  divines our purpose, he will hardly dare to move lest we should, by some  rapid movement, interpose between himself and London. If he gives us a  month, our success is certain. If he can give battle in a fortnight, no  one can say how the matter will end.\"    Edward, indeed, was losing no time. He stayed but a few days in London  after his victory at Barnet, and on the 19th of April left for Windsor,  ordering all his forces to join him there. The Lancastrians had  endeavoured to puzzle him as to their intended movements by sending  parties out in various directions; but as soon as he had gathered a  force, numerically small, but composed of veteran soldiers, he hurried  west, determined to bring on a battle at the earliest opportunity. The  queen's advisers determined to move first to Wells, as from that point  they could either go north or march upon London. Edward entered Abingdon  on the 27th, and then, finding the Lancastrians still at Wells, marched  to the northwest, by which means he hoped to intercept them if they  moved north, while he would be able to fall back and bar their road  to London if they advanced in that direction. He therefore moved to  Cirencester, and waited there for news until he learned that they had  visited Bristol and there obtained reinforcements of men and supplies of  money and cannon, and had then started on the high road to Gloucester.    He at once sent off messengers to the son of Lord Beauchamp, who held  the Castle of Gloucester for him, assuring him that he was following at  full speed, and would come to his aid forthwith. The messengers  arrived in time, and when the queen, after a long march, arrived before  Gloucester, she found the gates shut in her face. The governor had taken  steps to prevent her numerous adherents in the town from rising on  her behalf, and, manning the walls, refused to surrender. Knowing that  Edward was coming up rapidly, it was evident that there was no time to  spare in an attempt to take the town, and the queen's army therefore  pressed on, without waiting, to Tewkesbury. Once across the river they  would speedily be joined by the Earl of Pembroke, and Edward would be  forced to fall back at once.    By the time they reached the river, however, they were thoroughly  exhausted. They had marched thirty-six miles without rest, along bad  roads and through woods, and were unable to go farther. The queen urged  that the river should be crossed, but the leaders of the force were of  opinion that it was better to halt. Edward would be able to follow them  across the river, and were he to attack them when in disorder, and  still further wearied by the operation of making the passage, he would  certainly crush them. Moreover, a further retreat would discourage the  soldiers, and as a battle must now be fought, it was better to fight  where they were, especially as they could choose a strong position. The  queen gave way, and the army encamped on a large field in front of the  town. The position was well calculated for defence, for the country  around was so broken and intercepted with lanes and deep hedges and  ditches, that it was extremely difficult of approach.    In the evening Edward came up, his men having also marched some  six-and-thirty miles, and encamped for the night within three miles of  the Lancastrian position. The queen's troops felt confident of victory.  In point of numbers they were superior to their antagonists, and had the  advantage of a strong position. Sir Thomas Tresham had, as he proposed,  left his wife and son at Exeter when the force marched away.    \"Do not be despondent, love,\" he said to his weeping wife, as he bade  her goodbye. \"Everything is in our favour, and there is a good hope of a  happy termination to this long struggle. But, win or lose, be assured it  is the last time I will draw my sword. I have proved my fidelity to the  House of Lancaster; I have risked life and fortune in their cause; but  I feel that I have done my share and more, and whichever way Providence  may now decide the issue of the struggle, I will accept it. If we lose,  and I come scatheless through the fight, I will ride hither, and we will  embark at Plymouth for France, and there live quietly until the time  comes when Edward may feel himself seated with sufficient firmness on  the throne to forgive past offences and to grant an amnesty to all who  have fought against him. In any other case, dear, you know my wishes,  and I bid you carry them out within twenty-four hours of your receiving  news of a defeat, without waiting longer for my appearance.\"    As soon as it was light, Edward advanced to the attack. The Duke of  Gloucester was in command of the vanguard. He himself led the centre,  while the rear was commanded by the Marquis of Dorset and Lord Hastings.  The most advanced division of Lancastrians was commanded by the Duke of  Somerset and his brother. The Grand Prior of the Order of St. John and  Lord Wenlock were stationed in the centre, the Earl of Devon with  the reserve. Refreshed by their rest, the queen's troops were in good  spirits. While awaiting the attack, she and the prince rode among the  ranks, encouraging the men with fiery speeches, and promising large  rewards to all in case of victory.    Gloucester made his advance with great difficulty. The obstacles to his  progress were so many and serious that his division was brought to  a halt before it came into contact with the defenders. He therefore  brought up his artillery and opened a heavy cannonade upon Somerset's  position, supporting his guns with flights of arrows, and inflicting  such heavy loss upon him that the duke felt compelled to take the  offensive.    Having foreseen that he might be obliged to do so, he had, early in the  morning, carefully examined the ground in front of him, and had found  some lanes by which he could make a flank attack on the enemy. Moving  his force down these lanes, where the trees and hedges completely hid  his advance from the Yorkists, he fell suddenly upon Edward's centre,  which, taken by surprise at the unexpected attack, was driven in  confusion up the hill behind it. Somerset was quick to take advantage  of his success, and wheeling his men round fell upon the Duke of  Gloucester's division, and was equally successful in his attack upon  it. Had the centre, under Lord Wenlock, moved forward at once to his  support, the victory would have been assured; but Wenlock lay inactive,  and Somerset was now engaged in conflict with the whole of Edward's  force. But even under these circumstances he still gained ground, when  suddenly the whole aspect of the battle was changed.    Before it began Edward had sent two hundred spearmen to watch a wood  near the defenders' lines, as he thought that the Lancastrians might  place a force there to take him in flank as he attacked their front. He  ordered them, if they found the wood unoccupied, to join in the fight  as opportunity might offer. The wood was unoccupied, and the spearmen,  seeing the two divisions of their army driven backwards, and being  thereby cut off from their friends, issued from the wood and, charging  down in a body, fell suddenly upon Somerset's rear.    Astounded and confused by an attack from such a quarter, and believing  that it was an act of treachery by one of their own commanders,  Somerset's men, who had hitherto been fighting with the greatest  bravery, fell into confusion. Edward's quick eye soon grasped the  opportunity, and rallying his troops he charged impetuously down upon  the Lancastrians, seconded hotly by Gloucester and his division.    The disorder in Somerset's lines speedily grew into a panic, and the  division broke up and fled through the lanes to the right and left.  Somerset, after in vain trying to stop the panic, rode furiously back  into the camp, followed by his principal officers, and riding up to  Lord Wenlock he cleft his head in two with a battleaxe. His resentment,  although justified by the inactivity of this nobleman at such a crisis,  was yet disastrous, as it left the centre without a leader, and threw  it into a state of disorganization, as many must have supposed that  Somerset had turned traitor and gone over to the enemy. Before any  disposition could be made, Edward and Gloucester poured their forces  into the camp, and the Lancastrians at once broke and fled. Many of  their leaders took refuge in the church, an asylum which they deemed  inviolable, and which the Lancastrians had honourably respected in their  hour of triumph.    Among them were the Duke of Somerset, the Grand Prior of the Order  of St. John, Sir Humphrey Audely, Sir Gervis of Clifton, Sir William  Gainsby, Sir William Cary, Sir Henry Rose, Sir Thomas Tresham, and seven  esquires. Margaret of Anjou fell into the hands of the victors. As to  the fate of the young prince, accounts differ. Some authorities say that  he was overtaken and slain on the field, but the majority related that  he was captured and taken before Edward, who asked him, \"What brought  you to England?\" On his replying boldly, \"My father's crown and mine own  inheritance,\" Edward struck him in the mouth with his gauntlet, and his  attendants, or some say his brothers, at once despatched the youth with  their swords.    The king, with Gloucester and Clarence, then went to the church at  Tewkesbury, where the knights had taken refuge, burst open the doors,  and entered it. A priest, bearing the holy vessels, threw himself before  the king, and would not move until he promised to pardon all who had  taken sanctuary there. The king then retired, and trusting in the royal  word, the gentlemen made no attempt to escape, although it is said that  they could easily have done so. Two days later a party of"]]]
