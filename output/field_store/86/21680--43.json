[15]    In 1865 the Palestine Exploration fund was opened, and excavations were  begun in Jerusalem, and have continued, with some interruptions, until  now. Since then researches have followed in the south, east and north  of Palestine. Geological investigations have been made, natural history  collections have been formed, enquiries into nationalities and customs  carried on, towns, villages, hills, valleys, water courses, wells,  cisterns, notable trees and other land marks have been located. In  1868 a party of engineering experts left England to make a scientific  survey of the Sinaitic Peninsula. This they effected, making plans and  models, taking three thousand copies of inscriptions with collections  of specimens bearing on the zoology, botany and geology of the country.  [16]    The results of these explorations and discoveries, in the valley of  the Euphrates, in Palestine and the Sinaitic Peninsula, have been  even more fruitful, in the production of materials which tend to  confirm the truth of the Bible narrative and general credibility, than  the discoveries so far made in Egypt. The confirmation of the Bible  narrative of ancient events is remarkable. So, too, the confirmation  of its location of cities, mountains, rivers, plains and, indeed,  the whole geography of the scriptures. The confirmation given of the  Bible's incidental allusions to the manners and customs of neighboring  and contemporary nations is no less remarkable; together with what is  said of reigning kings and dynasties, and the incidental allusions  that the Bible makes to their invasions of each other's territories,  their alliances, their victories, and their defeats. The following are  a few of the special Bible incidents which receive confirmation from  the results of these researches condensed from the article of Professor  Sayce:        CREATION: One of the accounts of creation in cuneiform characters      found on the tablets very nearly resembles the first chapter of      Genesis. It commences with the statement that \"in the beginning\"      all was a chaos of waters, called the deep (Tiamat, the Hebrew      tehom). Then the Upper and Lower Firmaments were created, and the      Gods came into existence. After that comes a long account of the      struggle between Bel-Merodach and the \"Dragon\" of chaos, \"Timaat,\"      \"the serpent of evil,\" with her allies, the forces of anarchy      and darkness. It ended in the victory of the god of light, who      thereupon created the present world by the power of his \"word.\" The      fifth tablet or book of the poem describes the appointment of the      heavenly bodies for signs and seasons, and the sixth (or perhaps      the seventh) the creation of animals and reptiles. The latter part      of the poem, in which the creation of man was doubtless described,      has not yet been recovered. But we learn from other texts that man      was regarded as having been formed out of the \"dust\" of the ground.        THE SABBATH: From the tablets it is also learned that the      Babylonians observed a day of rest, which is called Sabbattu and      described as \"a day of rest for the heart.\" On it, it was forbidden      to eat cooked meat, to put on fresh clothes, to offer sacrifices,      to ride in a chariot, etc. The Sabbattu fell on the 7th, 14th,      19th, 21st, and 28th days of the month.        THE GARDEN OF EDEN: The \"plain\" of Babylonia was called Edin in      the ancient Sumerian language of the country, and the word was      adopted by the Semitic Babylonians, in the form of Edinu. Eridu,      the early seaport of Babylonia, was the chief center of primitive      Babylonian religion and culture, and in its neighborhood was a      garden, wherein, \"in a holy place,\" according to an ancient poem,      was a mysterious tree whose roots were planted in the \"deep,\"      while its branches reached to heaven. The tree of life is often      represented in Assyria sculptures between two winged cherubim who      have sometimes the heads of eagles, sometimes of men, and sometimes      stand, sometimes kneel. Eri-Aku or Arioch (Gen. 14:1) calls      himself \"the executor of the oracle of the holy tree of Eridu.\" In      Sumerian, wine was called ges-din, \"the draught of life.\" A second      tree is mentioned in Babylonian hymns on whose heart the name of      the god of wisdom is said to be inscribed.        THE FLOOD: In 1872 George Smith discovered the Babylonian account      of the deluge, which strikingly resembles that of Genesis. It is      contained in a long poem which was composed in the age of Abraham,      but the Chaldean tradition of the deluge, of which the account      in the poem is but one out of many, must go back to a very much      earlier date. Xisuthros, the Chaldean Noah was rescued along with      his family, servants, and goods, on account of his righteousness.      The god Ea warned him in a dream of the coming flood, and ordered      him to build a ship, into which he should take every kind of animal      so that \"the seed of life\" might be preserved.        UR OF THE CHALDEES: \"Ur\" is now identified as Mugheir. This was      the early home of Abraham and his forefathers spoken of in Genesis      (12:27-32). It was situated on the west side of the Euphrates. The      name means \"the city\" in Babylonia. It is proven now that there was      such a city, and that it is identical with Mugheir, the ruins of      which have been thoroughly explored. It was the seat of a dynasty      of kings who reigned before the age of Abraham, and was famous for      its temple of the moon-god, whose other famous temple was at Haran      in Mesopotamia.        ABRAHAM: Contract-tablets show that in the age of Abraham,      Canaanites--or \"Amorites,\" as the Babylonians called them--were      settled in Babylonia, and that a district outside the walls of      Sippara had been assigned to them. Several of the names are      distinctly Hebrew, and, in a tablet dated in the reign of the      grandfather of Amraphel (Gen. 14:1), one of the witnesses is called      \"the Amorite, the son of Abi-ramu,\" or Abram.        CAMPAIGN OF CHEDORLAOMER: The records on the tablets that this      event (described in Genesis 14) is in accordance with the national      movements of that age.        SHISHAK'S INVASION OF JUDAH: On the southern wall of the temple      of Karnak, Shishak (Shashang in Egypt) the founder of the      twenty-second Egyptian dynasty, has given a list of the places he      captured in Palestine. Most of them were in Judea, but there are      few (e. g. Megiddo and Taanach) which belonged to the northern      kingdom.        THE MOABITE STONE: The Moabite stone was discovered by Rev.      F. Klein, at Dhiban in the land of Moab, on August 19, 1868.      It measures three feet ten inches, by two feet, by one foot      two inches; and is inscribed with thirty-four lines of text.      The language of the inscription hardly differs from Hebrew in      vocabulary, grammar, or expression. The stone gives the Moabite      account of the war of Mesha, king of Moab, about 860 B. C., against      Omri, Ahab, and other kings of Israel, and confirms to quite an      extent the history of the same war as given in II Kings, chapter 3.      [17]    Very naturally those believers in the Bible who regard it as the  very word of God, those believers who regard the Bible's historical  statements as substantially true, allowing only for such errors as  may have crept in through the carelessness of copyists, or perchance  here and there an error through additions or omissions on the  part of copyists or designing custodians--such believers rejoice  at the confirmation the scriptures receive from the inscriptions  upon monuments and tablets brought to light by the researches and  scholarship of the nineteenth century. It is a pious sentiment, this  rejoicing over the confirmation of the word of God; and one can only  regret that the evidences supplied by these modern discoveries are not  sufficiently voluminous or explicit to silence altogether the unbelief  of modern times in the Bible. But they are not sufficient; for in spite  of them unbelievers not only exist in Christian lands, but increase  daily.    Footnotes    1. _The Bible as Literature_.

What is here called the  \"Literary Method,\" is identical with what is called \"Higher Criticism;\"  the terms are used interchangeably. Higher Criticism may be said  to stand in contradistinction to what is called Lower Criticism in  this, that it concerns itself with writings as a whole, whereas Lower  Criticism concerns itself with the integrity or character of particular  passages or parts; and is sometimes called \"Textual Criticism.\" \"The  term 'Literary' or 'Higher Criticism' designates that type of Biblical  criticism which proposes to investigate the separate books of the Bible  in their internal peculiarities, and to estimate them historically.  It discusses the questions concerning their origin, the time and  place, the occasion and object of their composition, and concerning  their position and value in the entire body of revelation. . . . . The  'Higher Criticism' has been so often employed for the overthrow of  long-cherished beliefs that the epithet 'destructive' has frequently  been applied to it; and hence it has become an offense to some orthodox  ears.\" (_The Mosaic Authorship of the Pentateuch_, Charles Elliott, D.

As early as 1866 he had already expressed  himself in a letter to Kuenen November 12) as follows:-- \"Vous me  faites pressentir une solution de cette enigme...c'est que les  parties elohistiques de la Genese seraient posterieures aux parties  jehovistiques.\"  Compare Kuenen, Theol. Tijdschrift (1870), p.412.  Graf had also in this respect followed Reuss, who (ut supra,  p. 24) says of himself: \"Le cote faible de ma critique a ete que,  a l'egard de tout ce qui ne rentrait pas dans les points enumeres  ci-dessus, je restais dans l'orniere tracee par mes devanciers,  admettant sans plus ample examen que le Pentateuque etait  l'ouvrage de l'HISTORIEN elohiste, complete par l'HISTORIEN  jehoviste, et ne me rendant pas compte de la maniere dont l'element  legal, dont je m'etais occupe exclusivement, serait venu se  joindre a l'element historique.  ***************************    The foundations were now laid; it is Kuenen who has since done most  for the further development of the hypothesis./2/    **************************  2.

Tijdschr.(1870), pp. 391-426.  **************************    The defenders of the prevailing opinion maintained their ground as well  as they could, but from long possession had got somewhat settled  on their lees.  They raised against the assailants a series of  objections, all of which, however, laboured more or less under the  disadvantage that they rested upon the foundation which had  already been shattered.  Passages were quoted from Amos and Hosea  as implying an acquaintance with the Priestly Code, but they were  not such as could make any impression on those who were already  persuaded that the latter was the more recent.  Again it was  asserted, and almost with violence, that the Priestly Code could  not be later than Deuteronomy, and that the Deuteronomist actually  had it before him.  But the evidences of this proved extremely  problematical, while, on the other hand, the dependence of  Deuteronomy, as a whole, on the Jehovist came out with the utmost  clearness.  Appeal was made to the latest redaction of the entire  Hexateuch, a redaction which was assumed to be Deuteronomistic;  but this yielded the result that the deuteronomistic redaction  could nowhere be traced in any of the parts belonging to the  Priestly Code.  Even the history of the language itself was  forced to render service against Graf: it had already been too  much the custom to deal with that as if it were soft wax.  To say  all in a word, the arguments which were brought into play as a  rule derived all their force from a moral conviction that the  ritual legislation must be old, and could not possibly have been  committed to writing for the first time within the period of  Judaism; that it was not operative before then, that it did not  even admit of being carried into effect in the conditions that  prevailed previous to the exile, could not shake the conviction--  all the firmer because it did not rest on argument--that at least  it existed previously.    The firemen never came near the spot where the conflagration  raged; for it is only within the region of religious antiquities  and dominant religious ideas,--the region which Vatke in his  Biblische Theologie had occupied in its full breadth, and where the  real battle first kindled--that the controversy can be brought to a  definite issue.  In making the following attempt in this direction,  I start from the comparison of the three constituents of the  Pentateuch,--the Priestly Code, Deuteronomy, and the work of the  Jehovist.  The contents of the first two are, of course,  legislation, as we have seen; those of the third are narrative;  but, as the Decalogue (Exodus xx.), the Law of the two Tables  (Exodus xxxiv.), and the Book of the Covenant (Exodus xxi.-xxiii.)  show, the legislative element is not wholly absent from the  Jehovist, and much less is the historical absent from the Priestly  Code or Deuteronomy.  Further, each writer's legal standpoint is  mirrored in his account of the history, and conversely; thus there  is no lack either of indirect or of direct points of comparison.  Now it is admitted that the three constituent elements are  separated from each other by wide intervals; the question then  arises, In what order?  Deuteronomy stands in a relation of  comparative nearness both to the Jehovist and to the Priestly  Code; the distance between the last two is by far the  greatest,--so great that on this ground alone Ewald as early as  the year 183I (Stud. u. Krit., p. 604) declared it impossible  that the one could have been written to supplement the other.  Combining this observation with the undisputed priority of the  Jehovist over Deuteronomy, it will follow that the Priestly Code  stands last in the series.  But such a consideration, although, so  far as I know, proceeding upon admitted data, has no value as long  as it confines itself to such mere generalities.  It is necessary  to trace the succession of the three elements in detail, and at  once to test and to fix each by reference to an independent  standard, namely, the inner development of the history of Israel  so far as that is known to us by trustworthy testimonies, from  independent sources.    The literary and historical investigation on which we thus enter  is both wide and difficult.  It falls into three parts.  In the  first, which lays the foundations, the data relating to sacred  archaeology are brought together and arranged in such a way as to  show that in the Pentateuch the elements follow upon one another  and from one another precisely as the steps of the development  demonstrably do in the history.  Almost involuntarily this  argument has taken the shape of a sort of history of the  ordinances of worship.  Rude and colourless that history must be  confessed to be,--a fault due to the materials, which hardly allow  us to do more than mark the contrast between pre-exilic and  post-exilic, and, in a secondary measure, that between  Deuteronomic and pre-Deuteronomic.  At the same time there is this  advantage arising out of the breadth of the periods treated: they  cannot fail to distinguish themselves from each other in a tangible  manner; it must be possible in the case of historical, and even of  legal works, to recognise whether they were written before or  after the exile.  The second part, in many respects dependent on  the first, traces the influence of the successively prevailing  ideas and tendencies upon the shaping of historical tradition, and  follows the various phases in which that was conceived and set  forth.  It contains, so to speak, a history of tradition. The  third part sums up the critical results of the preceding two, with  some further determining considerations, and concludes with a more  general survey.    The assumptions I make will find an ever-recurring justification  in the course of the investigation; the two principal are, that  the work of the Jehovist, so far as the nucleus of it is concerned,  belongs to the course of the Assyrian period, and that Deuteronomy  belongs to its close.  Moreover, however strongly I am convinced  that the latter is to be dated in accordance with 2Kings xxii., I  do not, like Graf, so use this position as to make it the fulcrum  for my lever.   Deuteronomy is the starting-point, not in the  sense that without it it would be impossible to accomplish  anything, but only because, when its position has been  historically ascertained, we cannot decline to go on, but must  demand that the position of the Priestly Code should also be fixed  by reference to history.  My inquiry proceeds on a broader basis  than that of Graf, and comes nearer to that of Vatke, from whom  indeed I gratefully acknowledge myself to have learnt best and  most.        A. HISTORY OF THE ORDINANCES OF WORSHIP.    \" Legem non habentes natura faciunt legis opera.\"--Romans ii.    [ \"(When Gentiles) who do not have the law, do instinctively  what the law requires....\"  Romans 2:14 NRSV ]        CHAPTER I. THE PLACE OF WORSHIP.      As we learn from the New Testament, the Jews and the Samaritans in  the days of Jesus were not agreed on the question which was the  proper place of worship, but that there could be only one was  taken to be as certain as the unity of God Himself.  The Jews  maintained that place to be the temple at Jerusalem, and when it  was destroyed they ceased to sacrifice.  But this oneness of the  sanctuary in Israel was not originally recognised either in fact  or in law; it was a slow growth of time.  With the help of the Old  Testament we are still quite able to trace the process.  In doing  so, it is possible to distinguish several stages of development.  We shall accordingly proceed to inquire whether the three  constituent parts of the Pentateuch give tokens of any  relationship to one or other of these; whether and how they fall  in with the course of the historical development which we are able  to follow by the aid of the historical and prophetic books from  the period of the Judges onwards.    I.I.1.  For the earliest period of the history of Israel, all  that precedes the building of the temple, not a trace can be found  of any sanctuary of exclusive legitimacy.  In the Books of Judges  and Samuel hardly a place is mentioned at which we have not at  least casual mention of an altar and of sacrifice.  In great  measure this multiplicity of sanctuaries was part of the heritage  taken over from the Canaanites by the Hebrews; as they  appropriated the towns and the culture generally of the previous  inhabitants, so also did they take possession of their sacred  piaces.  The system of high places (Bamoth), with all the  apparatus thereto belonging, is certainly Canaanite originally  (Deut. xii.2, 30; Num. xxxiii.52; Exodus xxxiv.1"]]]
