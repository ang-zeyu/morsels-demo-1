[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37872"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 2, No. 1, December, 1850 (#6)"],[1," much later date, supposing the historical tablets  to refer to the Assyrian kings mentioned in Scripture--(Shalmaneser,  Sennacherib, &c.). I do not agree with either one of these calculations  or the other. I am inclined to place the earliest inscriptions from  Nimroud between 1350 and 1200 before the Christian era; because, in the  first place, they had a limit to antiquity; for in the earliest  inscriptions there was a notice of the seaports of Phoenicia, of Tyre  and Sidon, of Byblus, Arcidus, &c.; and it was well known that these  cities were not founded more than 1500 years before the Christian era.  We have every prospect of a most important accession to our materials,  for every letter I get from the countries now being explored announces  fresh discoveries of the utmost importance. In Lower Chaldea, Mr.  Loftus, the geologist to the commission appointed to fix the boundaries  between Turkey and Persia, has visited many cities which no European had  ever reached before, and has everywhere found the most extraordinary  remains. At one place (Senkereh) he had come on a pavement, extending  from half an acre to an acre, entirely covered with writing, which was  engraved upon baked tiles, &c. At Wurka (or Ur of the Chaldees), whence  Abraham came out, he had found innumerable inscriptions; they were of no  great extent, but they were exceedingly interesting, giving many royal  names previously unknown. Wurka (Ur or Orchoe) seemed to be a holy city,  for the whole country, for miles upon miles, was nothing but a huge  necropolis. In none of the excavations of Assyria had coffins ever been  found, but in this city of Chaldea there were thousands upon thousands.  The story of Abraham's birth at Wurka did not originate with the Arabs,  as had sometimes been conjectured, but with the Jews; and the Orientals  had numberless fables about Abraham and Nimroud. Mr. Layard in  excavating beneath the great pyramid at Nimroud, had penetrated a mass  of masonry, within which he _had discovered the tomb and statue of_  Sardanapalus, accompanied by full annals of the monarch's reign engraved  on the walls! He had also found tablets of all sorts, all of them being  historical; but the crowning discovery he had yet to describe. The  palace at Nineveh, or Koynupih, had evidently been destroyed by fire,  but one portion of the building seemed to have escaped its influence;  and Mr. Layard, in excavating in this part of the palace, had found a  large room filled with what appeared to be the archives of the empire,  ranged in successive tablets of terra cotta, the writings being as  perfect as when the tablets were first stamped. They were piled in huge  heaps from the floor to the ceiling. From the progress already made in  reading the inscriptions, I believe we shall be able pretty well to  understand the contents of these tablets; at all events, we shall  ascertain their general purport, and thus gain much valuable  information. A passage might be remembered in the book of Ezra where the  Jews, having been disturbed in building the Temple, prayed that search  might be made in the house of records for the edict of Cyrus permitting  them to return to Jerusalem. The chamber recently found there might be  presumed to be the house of records of the Assyrian kings, where copies  of the royal edicts were duly deposited. When these tablets have been  examined and deciphered, I believe that we shall have a better  acquaintance with the history, the religion, the philosophy, and the  jurisprudence of Assyria, 1500 years before the Christian era, than we  have of Greece or Rome during any period of their respective histories.\"    Besides the gigantic figures of which we have copied engravings in the  preceding pages, Dr. Layard has sent to the British Museum a large  number of other sculptures, some of which are still more interesting for  the light they reflect upon ancient Assyrian history. For these, as for  the Grecian marbles and Egyptian antiquities, a special gallery is being  fitted up.      [Illustration: JONATHAN SWIFT.]    DEAN SWIFT'S CHARACTER AND HIS AMOURS.    The name of Swift is one of the most familiar in English history. Of the  twenty octavo volumes in which his works are printed, only a part of one  volume is read; but this part of a volume is read by everybody, and  admired by everybody, though singularly enough not one in a thousand  ever thinks of its real import, or appreciates it for what are and what  were meant to be its highest excellences. As the author of \"Gulliver's  Travels,\" Swift is a subject of general interest; and this interest is  deepened, but scarcely diffused, by the chain of enigmas which has  puzzled so many of his biographers.    The most popular life of Dean Swift is Mr. Roscoe's, but since that was  written several works have appeared, either upon his whole history or in  elucidation of particular portions of it: one of which was a careful  investigation and discussion of his madness, published about two years  ago. In the last number of _The International_ we mentioned the curious  novel of \"Stella and Vanessa,\" in which a Frenchman has this year  essayed his defense against the common judgment in the matter of his  amours, and we copy in the following pages an article from the London  _Times_, which was suggested by this performance.    M. De Wailly's \"Stella and Vanessa\" is unquestionably a very ingenious  and brilliant fiction--in every sense only a fiction--for its hypotheses  are all entirely erroneous. Even Mr. Roscoe, whose Memoir has been  called an elaborate apology, and who, as might have been expected from a  man of so amiable and charitable a character, labors to put the best  construction upon all Swift's actions,--even he shrinks from the  vindication of the Dean's conduct toward Miss Vanhomrigh and Mrs.  Johnson. In treating of the charges which are brought against Swift  while he was alive, or that have since been urged against his  reputation, the elegant historian calls to his aid every palliating  circumstance; and where no palliating circumstances are to be found,  seeks to enlist our benevolent feelings in behalf of a man deeply  unfortunate, persecuted by his enemies, neglected by his friends, and  haunted all his life by the presentiment of a fearful calamity, by which  at length in his extreme old age he was assaulted and overwhelmed. On  some points Mr. Roscoe must be said to have succeeded in this advocacy,  so honorable alike to him and to its subject; but the more serious  charges against Swift remain untouched, and probably will forever remain  so, by whatever ability, or eloquence, or generous partiality, combated.  To speak plainly, Swift was an irredeemably bad man, devoured by vanity  and selfishness, and so completely dead to every elevated and manly  feeling, that he was always ready to sacrifice those most devotedly  attached to him for the gratification of his unworthy passion for power  and notoriety.    Swift's life, though dark and turbulent, was nevertheless romantic. He  concealed the repulsive odiousness of an unfeeling heart under manners  peculiarly fascinating, which conciliated not only the admiration and  attachment of more than one woman, but likewise the friendship of  several eminent men, who were too much dazzled by the splendor of his  conversation to detect the base qualities which existed in the  background. But these circumstances only enhance the interest of his  life. At every page there is some discussion which strongly interests  our feelings: some difficulty to be removed, some mystery to keep alive  curiosity. We neither know, strictly speaking, who Swift was, what were  the influences which raised him to the position he occupied, by what  intricate ties he was connected with Stella, or what was the nature of  that singular grief, which, in addition to the sources of sorrow to  which we have alluded, preyed on him continually, and at last  contributed largely to the overthrow of his reason. On this account it  is not possible to proceed with indifference through the circumstances  of his life, though very few careful examiners will be able to interpret  them in a lenient and charitable spirit.    Mr. Roscoe appears to believe that everybody who regards unfavorably  Swift's genius and morals, must be actuated by envy or party spirit, but  very few of the later or earlier critics are of his opinion. In the  first place, most honorable men would rather remain unknown through  eternity than accept the Dean's reputation. As Savage Landor says, he  was \"irreverential to the great and to God: an ill-tempered, sour,  supercilious man, who flattered some of the worst and maligned some of  the best men that ever lived.\" Whatever services he performed for the  party from which he apostatized, there is nothing in his more permanent  writings which can be of the slightest advantage to English toryism.  Indeed, in politics and in morals, he appears never to have had any  fixed principles. He served the party which he thought most likely to  make him a bishop, and deserted it when he discovered that it was losing  ground. He studied government not as a statesman but as a partisan, as a  hardy, active, and unscrupulous Swiss, who could and would do much dirty  work for a minister, if he saw reason to anticipate a liberal  compensation. He however always extravagantly exaggerated his own  powers, and so have his biographers, and so has the writer of the  following article from _The Times_, who seems to have accepted with too  little scrutiny the estimate he made of himself. The complacency with  which he frequently refers to his supposed influence over the ministers  is simply ludicrous. He entirely loses sight of both his own position  and theirs. Shrewd as he shows himself under other circumstances, he is  here as verdant as the greenest peasant from the forest. \"I use the  ministers like dogs,\" he says in a letter to Stella, but in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3788"],[0,"Haydn (#6)"],[1," and their extraneous passages (particularly those  of Bach of Hamburg) so inimitably burlesqued, that they all felt the  poignancy of his musical wit, confessed its truth, and were silent.\"  Further on we read that the sonatas of Ops. 13 and 14 were \"expressly  composed in order to ridicule Bach of Hamburg.\" All this is manifestly  a pure invention. Many of the peculiarities of Emanuel Bach's style are  certainly to be found in Haydn's works--notes wide apart, pause bars,  surprise modulations, etc., etc.--but if every young composer who adopts  the tricks of his model is to be charged with caricature, few can hope  to escape. The truth is, of course, that every man's style, whether in  music or in writing, is a \"mingled yarn\" of many strands, and it serves  no good purpose to unravel it, even if we could.    Violin Studies    Haydn's chief instrument was the clavier, but in addition to that  he diligently practiced the violin. It was at this date that he took  lessons on the latter instrument from \"a celebrated virtuoso.\" The name  is not mentioned, but the general opinion is that Dittersdorf was the  instructor. This eminent musician obtained a situation as violinist in  the Court Orchestra at Vienna in 1760; and, curiously enough, after many  years of professional activity, succeeded Haydn's brother, Michael,  as Capellmeister to the Bishop of Groswardein in Hungary. He wrote an  incredible amount of music, and his opera, \"Doctor and Apotheker,\" by  which he eclipsed Mozart at one time, has survived up to the present.  Whether or not he gave Haydn lessons on the violin, it is certain that  the pair became intimate friends, and had many happy days and some  practical jokes together. One story connected with their names sounds  apocryphal, but there is no harm in quoting it. Haydn and Dittersdorf  were strolling down a back street when they heard a fiddler scraping  away in a little beer cellar. Haydn, entering, inquired, \"Whose minuet  is that you are playing?\" \"Haydn's,\" answered the fiddler. \"It's a--bad  minuet,\" replied Haydn, whereupon the enraged player turned upon him and  would have broken his head with the fiddle had not Dittersdorf dragged  him away.    Attempts at Programme Music    It seems to have been about this time--the date, in fact, was 1751--that  Haydn, still pursuing his serenading practices, directed a performance  of a quintet of his own composition under the windows of Felix Kurz, a  well-known Viennese comedian and theatrical manager. According to an  old writer, Kurz amused the public by his puns, and drew crowds to his  theatre by his originality and by good opera-buffas. He had, moreover,  a handsome wife, and \"this was an additional reason for our nocturnal  adventurers to go and perform their serenades under the harlequin's  windows.\" The comedian was naturally flattered by Haydn's attention. He  heard the music, and, liking it, called the composer into the house to  show his skill on the clavier. Kurz appears to have been an admirer of  what we would call \"programme\" music. At all events he demanded that  Haydn should give him a musical representation of a storm at sea.  Unfortunately, Haydn had never set eyes on the \"mighty monster,\" and was  hard put to it to describe what he knew nothing about. He made several  attempts to satisfy Kurz, but without success. At last, out of all  patience, he extended his hands to the two ends of the harpsichord,  and, bringing them rapidly together, exclaimed, as he rose from the  instrument, \"The devil take the tempest.\" \"That's it! That's it!\" cried  the harlequin, springing upon his neck and almost suffocating him. Haydn  used to say that when he crossed the Straits of Dover in bad weather,  many years afterwards, he often smiled to himself as he thought of the  juvenile trick which so delighted the Viennese comedian.    His First Opera    But the comedian wanted more from Haydn than a tempest on the keyboard.  He had written the libretto of an opera, \"Der Neue Krumme Teufel,\" and  desired that Haydn should set it to music. The chance was too good to  be thrown away, and Haydn proceeded to execute the commission with  alacrity, not a little stimulated, doubtless, by the promise of 24  ducats for the work. There is a playfulness and buoyancy about much  of Haydn's music which seems to suggest that he might have succeeded  admirably in comic opera, and it is really to be regretted that while  the words of \"Der Neue Krumme Teufel\" have been preserved, the music has  been lost. It would have been interesting to see what the young  composer had made of a subject which--from Le Sage's \"Le Diable Boiteux\"  onwards--has engaged the attention of so many playwrights and musicians.  The opera was produced at the Stadt Theatre in the spring of 1752,  and was frequently repeated not only in Vienna, but in Berlin, Prague,  Saxony and the Breisgau.    An Aristocratic Appointment    An event of this kind must have done something for Haydn's reputation,  which was now rapidly extending. Porpora seems also to have been of  no small service to him in the way of introducing him to aristocratic  acquaintances. At any rate, in 1755, a wealthy musical amateur, the  Baron von Furnberg, who frequently gave concerts at his country house  at Weinzierl, near Vienna, invited him to take the direction of these  performances and compose for their programmes. It was for this nobleman  that he wrote his first string quartet, the one in B flat beginning--    [figure: a musical score excerpt]    This composition was rapidly followed by seventeen other works of the  same class, all written between 1755 and 1756.    Taken for an Impostor    Haydn's connection with Furnberg and the success of his compositions  for that nobleman at once gave him a distinction among the musicians and  dilettanti of Vienna. He now felt justified in increasing his fees,  and charged from 2 to 5 florins for a month's lessons. Remembering the  legend of his unboylike fastidiousness, and the undoubted nattiness  of his later years, it is curious to come upon an incident of directly  opposite tendency. A certain Countess von Thun, whose name is associated  with Beethoven, Mozart and Gluck, met with one of his clavier sonatas  in manuscript, and expressed a desire to see him. When Haydn presented  himself, the countess was so struck by his shabby appearance and uncouth  manners that it occurred to her he must be an impostor! But Haydn soon  removed her doubts by the pathetic and realistic account which he gave  of his lowly origin and his struggles with poverty, and the countess  ended by becoming his pupil and one of his warmest friends.    A Count's Capellmeister    Haydn is said to have held for a time the post of organist to the Count  Haugwitz; but his first authenticated fixed engagement dates from  1759, when, through the influence of Baron Furnberg, he was appointed  Capellmeister to the Bohemian Count Morzin. This nobleman, whose country  house was at Lukavec, near Pilsen, was a great lover of music, and  maintained a small, well-chosen orchestra of some sixteen or eighteen  performers. It was for him that Haydn wrote his first Symphony in D--    [Figure: a musical score excerpt]    Falls in Love    We now approach an interesting event in Haydn's career. In the course of  some banter at the house of Rogers, Campbell the poet once remarked that  marriage in nine cases out of ten looks like madness. Haydn's case was  not the tenth. His salary from Count Morzin was only 20 pounds with  board and lodging; he was not making anything substantial by his  compositions; and his teaching could not have brought him a large  return. Yet, with the proverbial rashness of his class, he must needs  take a wife, and that, too, in spite, of the fact that Count Morzin  never kept a married man in his service! \"To my mind,\" said Mozart,  \"a bachelor lives only half a life.\" It is true enough; but Mozart had  little reason to bless the \"better half,\" while Haydn had less. The lady  with whom he originally proposed to brave the future was one of his own  pupils--the younger of the two daughters of Barber Keller, to whom he  had been introduced when he was a chorister at St Stephen's. According  to Dies, Haydn had lodged with the Kellers at one time. The statement is  doubtful, but in any case his good stars were not in the ascendant when  it was ordained that he should marry into this family.    Marries    It was, as we have said, with the younger of the two daughters that he  fell in love. Unfortunately, for some unexplained reason, she took the  veil, and said good-bye to a wicked world. Like the hero in \"Locksley  Hall,\" Haydn may have asked himself, \"What is that which I should do?\"  But Keller soon solved the problem for him. \"Barbers are not the most  diffident people of the world,\" as one of the race remarks in \"Gil  Blas,\" and Keller was assuredly not diffident. \"Never mind,\" he said to  Haydn, \"you shall have the other.\" Haydn very likely did not want the  other, but, recognizing with Dr Holmes's fashionable lady that \"getting  married is like jumping overboard anyway you look at it,\" he resolved to  risk it and take Anna Maria Keller for better or worse.    His Wife    The marriage was solemnized at St Stephen's on November 26, 1760, when  the bridegroom was twenty-nine and the bride thirty-two. There does not  seem to have been much affection on either side to start with; but Haydn  declared that he had really begun to \"like\" his wife, and would have  come to entertain a stronger feeling for her if she had behaved in a  reasonable way. It was, however, not in Anna Maria's nature to behave in  a reasonable way. The diverting Marville says that the majority of women  married to men of genius are so vain of the abilities of their husbands  that they are frequently insufferable. Frau Haydn was not a woman of  that kind. As Haydn himself sadly remarked, it did not matter to her  whether he were a cobbler"]]]
