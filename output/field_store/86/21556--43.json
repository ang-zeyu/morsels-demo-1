I stopped by that way as I came along, and they called out to  me from up stairs how you were practising drawing, and that you gave Mr.  Dog some dancing lessons the other day, and then made a fine picture of  him just as he looked when he danced into the hot coals, so I hurried  right over here for just to see that picture.\"    Poor Mr. Rabbit! He didn't know what to do. He knew right away that the  Hollow Tree people had told about the picture to get rid of Mr. Polecat,  and he made up his mind that he'd get even with them some day for  getting him in such a fix. But some day was a long ways off and Mr.  Polecat was right there under his nose, so Mr. Rabbit said, just as  quick as he could say it, that the Hollow Tree people were always  making jokes, and that the picture was just as poor as it could be, and  that he'd be ashamed to show it to anybody, much more to a talented  gentleman like Mr. Polecat. But that made Mr. Polecat all the more  anxious to see it, for he was sure Mr. Rabbit was only modest, and  pretty soon he happened to spy the edge of the picture frame under Mr.  Rabbit's bed, and just reached under and pulled it out, before Mr.  Rabbit could help himself.    Well, he picked up that picture and looked at it a minute, and Jack  Rabbit began to back off toward the door and say a few soothing words,  when all at once Mr. Polecat leaned back and commenced to laugh and  laugh at the funny picture Mr. Dog made where Mr. Rabbit called to him,  \"Dance! Mr. Dog; dance!\" And then, of course, Mr. Rabbit felt better,  for if his company thought it was funny and laughed there wasn't so much  danger.    \"Why,\" said Mr. Polecat, \"it's the best thing I ever saw! You could  almost imagine that Mr. Dog himself was right here, howling and barking  and dancing.\"    \"Oh, no, hardly that,\" said Mr. Rabbit. \"Of course I suppose it is a  little like him, but it's not at all as if he were here, you know--not  at all--and he's ever so far off, I'm sure, and won't come again for a  long time. You know, he's--\"    \"Oh, yes, it is!\" declared Mr. Polecat. \"It's just as if he were right  here. And I can just hear him howl and bark, and--\"    And right there Mr. Polecat stopped and Mr. Rabbit stopped, and both of  them held their breath and listened, for sure enough they did hear Mr.  Dog howling and barking and coming toward the house as straight as he  could come.    Jack Rabbit gave a jump right up in the air, and hollered, \"Run! Mr.  Polecat, run! and go the back way!\" But Mr. Polecat never runs from  anybody--he doesn't have to--he just opens up that perfume of his and  the other people do the running. So Mr. Rabbit gave one more jump, and  this time he jumped straight up the chimney, and didn't stop till he  got to the roof, where he found a loose board and put it over the  chimney quick and sat down on it. Then he called to Mr. Dog, who was  coming lickety split through the woods:--    \"Why, how are you, Mr. Dog? Glad to see you! Walk right in. There's  company down stairs; just make yourself at home till I come down.\" You  see there was no use to stop him now, because Mr. Rabbit could tell by  what was coming up the chimney that it was too late, and he wanted Mr.  Dog to get a good dose of it as well as himself.    And Mr. Dog did come just as hard as he could tear, for the wind was  blowing toward the house and he couldn't detect anything wrong until he  gave a great big jump into Mr. Rabbit's sitting room and right into the  midst of the most awful smell that was ever turned loose in the Big Deep  Woods.    Well, it took Mr. Dog so suddenly that he almost fainted away. Then he  gave a howl, as if a wagon had run over his tail, and tumbled out of  that sitting room and set out for home without once stopping to look  behind him. Then Mr. Rabbit laughed and laughed, and called:--    \"Come back, Mr. Dog! Come back and stay with us. Mr. Polecat's going to  spend a week with me. Come back and have a good time.\"    But Mr. Dog didn't stop, and he didn't seem to hear, and by and by Mr.  Polecat called up that he was going home and that Mr. Rabbit could come  down now, for Mr. Dog was gone and wouldn't come back, he guessed. But  Mr. Rabbit said no, he didn't feel very well yet, and guessed he'd stay  where he was for the present, and that if Mr. Polecat was going he might  leave both doors open and let the wind draw through the house, because  he always liked to air his house after Mr. Dog had been to see him. Then  Mr. Polecat took his basket and went, and Jack Rabbit didn't come down  for a long time, and when he did he couldn't stay in his house for the  awful smell. So he went over to stay a week with the Hollow Tree people,  and his clothes didn't smell nice, either, but they had to stand it, and  Mr. Rabbit said it served them right for getting him into such a fix. It  was over a week before he could go back to his house again, and even  then it wasn't just as he wanted it to be, and he aired it every day for  a long time.    But there was one thing that made him laugh, and that was when he heard  from Mr. Robin how Mr. Dog got home and Mr. Man wouldn't have him about  the house or even in the yard, but made him stay out in the woods for as  much as ten days, until he had got rid of every bit of Mr. Polecat's  nice perfumery.          MR. 'POSSUM EXPLAINS    HOW UNCLE SILAS TRIED TO PLEASE AUNT MELISSY      WELL, you remember that the Hollow Tree people took four of their  friends to live with them and called it the Hollow Tree Inn. Mr. Robin  came, and Mr. Turtle, also Jack Rabbit and Mr. Squirrel, and they made a  jolly crowd after they got settled and knew about each getting his own  things to eat, because the Hollow Tree people--the 'Coon and 'Possum and  the Old Black Crow--found they couldn't suit their guests exactly when  it came to a steady diet. So they all kept house together, and used to  go out days (and nights, too, sometimes) and get nice things. Then  they'd bring them in and fix them to suit themselves, and have them all  on the big table down stairs, nice and comfortable, where they could sit  and talk as long as they pleased.    It was a good deal like a big family when they were all together that  way, and they used to say how nice it was, and once Mr. 'Possum said he  always did think a big family was nice, anyway. Then Jack Rabbit laughed  and said he should think Mr. 'Possum was just the kind of a man for a  big family, being fond of good things to eat and not very fond of  getting them for himself, and mostly fat and sleepy like. He said if  there was just a nice, spry Mrs. 'Possum, now, to keep house and look  after things he should think it would be ever so much better than living  in bachelor quarters, or, rather, thirds, with Mr. 'Coon and Mr. Crow,  and not having things very orderly. Of course, with himself, Jack Rabbit  said, it was different, but even at his house it got lonesome, too, now  and then.    [Illustration: SHE TIED HIS TIE FOR HIM]    Well, Mr. 'Possum thought a minute, and then he said that there was such  a thing as folks being too spry, and that it was because he had always  been afraid of getting that kind that he had been pretty well satisfied  to live in the Hollow Tree just as he was. He said that he had once had  an uncle that something happened to in that line, and whenever he  thought about poor Uncle Lovejoy he didn't seem to care much about  trying anything he wasn't used to. Then they all wanted him to tell  about Uncle Lovejoy and what happened to him. So Mr. 'Possum did tell,  and it went this way:--    \"Once upon a time,\" he said, \"Uncle Lovejoy--we always called him Uncle  Silas then--he was uncle on my mother's side, and lived with Aunt  Melissy in a nice place just beyond the Wide Paw-paw Hollows--once upon  a time, as I was saying, he had to go to town on some business, and that  was something that never happened to Uncle Lovejoy before.    [Illustration: COUSIN GLENWOOD MET HIM AT THE STATION]    \"Well, Aunt Melissy was always a spry woman, as I said, and  stirring--very stirring, and primpy, too. But she was never as stirring  and spry and primpy as she was the day that Uncle Silas started for  town. She dressed him all up neat and proper in his very best things,  and tied his tie for him, and while she was tying it she says:--    [Illustration: COUSIN GLEN TOOK UNCLE LOVEJOY TO THE STORES]    \"'Now, Silas,' she says, 'when you get to town you buy a few little  articles right away and put them on. You don't want folks to see that  you come from the country, you know, and you don't want Cousin Glenwood  to be ashamed of you before folks. Cousin Glen will know just what  things you need and where to get them.' Then she told him not to get run  over by anything, or blow out the gas, or let anybody see that he wasn't  used to things, because, you see, Aunt Melissy was proud, being a  Glenwood herself. Then Uncle Lovejoy promised all those things, and that  he would use his napkin and not eat pie out of his hand or drink out of  his finger bowl, and a lot more things that Aunt Melissy remembered at  the last minute. So you see by the time he got on the train he had a  good deal to think about, and he kept thinking about it until by the  time he got to the city he'd made up his mind he'd try to do for once  everything she told him to and give her a pleasant surprise with the way  he had fixed up and improved his manners when he got back. Uncle Lovejoy  was good natured, and always anxious to please folks, especially Aunt  Melissy.    [Illustration: WHERE THERE WAS A MIRROR UNCLE LOVEJOY WOULD STAND BEFORE  IT AND ADMIRE HIMSELF]    \"Well, Cousin Glenwood met him at the station, and about the first thing  Uncle Silas said was to ask him where he got his clothes, and to tell  him that Aunt Melissy had said he was to fix up, so's folks wouldn't"]]]
