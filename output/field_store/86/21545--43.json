I have not seen a badger make more than two such excursions by daylight,  but have no doubt that after dark a considerable number of such  journeys may be accomplished. For weeks together, on any morning, you  may see the litter of bracken and grass strewing the way to his home and  down the various entrances.    And now let me again, with all possible respect, put some of our  scientific friends right. It is not often that an amateur can; but a man  who is not able to tell you everything, as these learned men do, about  every living creature, may from a country life and experience be able to  correct some errors in respect of one animal at least. M. Buffon, the  immortal and wonderful natural historian, tells us that the badger is a  solitary animal. This is the reverse of truth; he is less solitary than  the fox. He is fond of company; he is monogamous, and clings closely and  faithfully to his own wife. With badgers, as with the human race, the  sexes are not precisely equal in numbers, and often, from the force of  circumstances, a badger has to remain a celibate, but he is not a  bachelor by choice. He may become a widower, but in either case he will  travel far to seek a partner to share his shelter and his lot. It is not  altogether rare to find an old solitary dog badger, who has loved and  lost, or taken in late age to a hermit's cell; but he, as often as not,  when he has failed to secure the companionship of the gentler sex, has  found some other male to share his home, when they can live comfortably  _en garcon_.    Nor do the married pair shun the society of their kind. I have often  seen large badger \"sets\" almost as full of badgers as a warren is of  rabbits. One evening, near my house, I waited an hour of midge-plagued  time to watch the badgers come out from a small \"set,\" and was rewarded  by seeing a procession of seven full-grown badgers emerge from a single  hole, and I had them all in full view for something like twenty minutes.  As this was in July they could hardly be one family. They were every one  more than a year old, and a badger's family is usually two in number,  sometimes three, and never more than four; and this last is exceedingly  rare in my experience. In no sense, therefore, is the badger solitary.  Indeed I have actually known myself several instances of a badger and  fox living in apparent amity in the same earth, whilst I hardly ever saw  a badger \"earth\" that was not either itself or the immediate vicinity  tenanted by rabbits. As to the consistency of any friendship that exists  between badgers and foxes and rabbits, I shall have more to say later  on. I have, however, taken a badger and rabbit out of the same hole  lying side by side. The badger is said to be the protector of the  rabbit. He does not altogether deserve this title, and the rabbit enjoys  the immunity in a badger's earth chiefly from the fact that the badger  cannot follow it in the smaller holes without digging, an effort which  in his estimation is, as a rule, not worth the candle.    Buffon dwells on the cleanliness of the badger. He certainly is not the  stinking animal he is accused of being. His house and himself are as a  rule bright and cleanly looking, and it is only when in confinement,  and deprived of the sanitary arrangements to which he is accustomed,  that he becomes offensive. Writers are not correct in saying that he  never deposits his dung in his earth, but as a rule he does not, and his  habit is to go some little distance from his home, dig a hole, and there  leave his excrement. He will use the same hole for a few days, and then  cover it up with earth and make a new one. There is a smell about a  badger \"earth,\" but it is not disagreeable, and nothing like so rank and  strong as that of a fox's. He is, however, often troubled with lice and  ticks, so that it is desirable when your dogs have been to ground  carefully to wash them. But in this respect a badger is not worse than  sheep and goats, and with such a coat as he has it is no wonder that it  is sometimes tenanted. The same distinguished authority states that the  badger produces its young in summer, but I have never known this happen.  March is the usual month, and the rule is not earlier than February nor  later than April. A naturalist at Cambridge told me that he knew of a  badger bitch that was many months in confinement (I think he said  eighteen months), and gave birth to cubs--but I was not convinced of the  accuracy of his statement that she had never had access to one of her  kind. It is only fair to mention that Vyner, in his _Notitia Venatica_,  states that \"It is a fact perhaps not generally known, nevertheless  curious, that badgers go twelve months with young. This fact I _learned  from a neighbour of mine in Warwickshire_, who some years ago dug out in  the spring a sow badger. She was confined in an outhouse for twelve  months, at about which period she produced one young one. During her  confinement it was impossible for her to have been visited by a male.\"    That an animal of this size should go with young for such a period is so  extraordinary, and so great an exception to the ordinary provisions of  nature, that the theory requires much greater support than mere hearsay  evidence. If it were a fact, or if it were the rule, the evidence to  support the theory of twelve months' gestation should be overwhelming,  considering the number of badgers that are in confinement. I have had  many in confinement for long periods, and have never known them to give  any evidence in support of this theory. I have kept a pair for a long  period, but, like many other wild animals in confinement, they never  bred. All sorts of theories exist as to the period of gestation in  badgers, but I think I shall be very near the mark when I say that they  go with young about nine weeks, and I conceive that the mistake made by  those who have thought that they go over a year is due to the fact,  which I have noticed, that a pair of badgers do not breed every year. I  cannot decide whether there is any precise rule, but am inclined to  think that they breed once every two years. There are so many accounts  of single badgers kept in confinement bringing forth young after a much  longer period of gestation that it appears possible that the female has  the power known to be possessed by the Roe-deer doe of postponing the  operation of parturition for a considerable time.    The badger is not by nature a ferocious animal, though the female will  repel with the greatest savagery any approach when she has young, but so  will a hen with chickens. The temperament of the badger is a gentle,  shrinking one. No animal prefers a more quiet life, loving a warm bed in  a dry dark corner of earth or rocks. He loves to sleep and meditate in  peace for the greater part of the twenty-four hours. He lies not far  within his entrance hall during the spring and summer, and on a hot day  he will sometimes come to the mouth of his hole. In the evening, in June  or July, he will come outside, sit looking into the wood or shuffle  round the bushes, stretch himself against the tree-stems, or have a  clumsy romp with his wife and little ones; and when the daylight dies he  will hurry off, rushing through the covert for his nightly ramble. In  the summer months he will travel as far as six miles from home, but he  is in bed again an hour before sunrise.    It is only at this time of the year that he can be hunted above ground.  This can be done with a few beagles or harriers on a moonlight night,  when, finding him in the open, they will give a merry chase and fine  cry, and a run of several miles without a check. If his earths are  stopped, and he finds no other refuge, he will be brought to bay. In  some districts I have known sacks put into the mouths of the most used  holes of a set, the open end of each sack having a running noose pegged  into the ground, thus providing an astonishing reception on his return  as he charges in, disturbed or pursued in his midnight ramble. By this  means he is taken alive and unhurt, being bagged and secured in his  attempt to enter. At other times of the year, when the days are short  and the nights longer, he comes out later in the evening, waits for a  moment at the mouth of his earth, takes a preliminary sniff round, and  then rushes off at the top speed into the covert.    The badger is easily domesticated if brought up by hand, and proves an  interesting and charming companion. I had at one time two that I could  do anything with, and which followed me so closely that they would bump  against my boots each step I took, and come and snuggle in under my coat  when I sat down. I was very much attached to them, but having to leave  for the London season, I came home after a prolonged absence to find  that they had reverted to their natural disposition, and had forgotten  him who had been a foster-parent to them. As I could not fondle them  without a pair of hedging-gloves on, and they no longer walked at my  heel, I made them a home in the woods, where the thought of their  happiness has helped me to bear my loss.    Many interesting stories are told of tame badgers. Here is one taken  from the _Field_: \"A few months ago, a farmer in the Cotswolds unearthed  a badger and one youngster about two months old, which were sent to Mr.  Barry Burge, Northleach, who only kept the former a few weeks, when she  died. The orphan was petted very much by its owner. In a short time it  would follow Mr. Burge through the fields and streets, and answer to  the call like a dog. It is an amusing sight to see the badger along with  its master riding a bicycle. A short time ago Mr. Burge had a fox cub,  which he has succeeded in taming. This fox has taken a great fancy to an  Irish terrier, with which she plays continually. The badger, which is  now about seven months old, is loose about the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36844"],[0,"In New England Fields and Woods (#6)"],[1,"of the pool you see only a  half-dozen concentric circles of wavelets, widening from central points,  where as many musicians have modestly withdrawn beneath the transparent  curtain.    Wait, silent and motionless, and they will reappear. A brown head is  thrust above the surface, and presently your last summer's familiar of  the garden and doorstep crawls slowly out upon a barren islet of  cobble-stone, and, assured that no intruder is within the precincts  sacred to the wooing of the toads, she inflates her throat and tunes up  her long, monotonous chant. Ere it ceases, another and another take it  up, and from distant pools you hear it answered, till all the air is  softly shaken as if with the clear chiming of a hundred swift-struck,  tiny bells. They ring in the returning birds, robin, sparrow, finch and  meadow lark, and the first flowers, squirrelcup, arbutus, bloodroot,  adder-tongue and moose-flower.    When the bobolink has come to his northern domain again and the oriole  flashes through the budding elms and the first columbine droops over the  gray ledges, you may still hear an occasional ringing of the toads, but  a little later the dignified and matronly female, having lost her voice  altogether, has returned to her summer home, while her little mate has  exchanged his trill for a disagreeable and uncanny squawk, perhaps a  challenge to his rivals, who linger about the scenes of their courtship  and make night hideous until midsummer. Then a long silence falls on the  race of toads--a silence which even hibernation scarcely deepens.          XII    MAY DAYS      The lifeless dun of the close-cropped southward slopes and the tawny  tangles of the swales are kindling to living green with the blaze of the  sun and the moist tinder of the brook's overflow.    The faithful swallows have returned, though the faithless season delays.  The flicker flashes his golden shafts in the sunlight and gladdens the  ear with his merry cackle. The upland plover wails his greeting to the  tussocked pastures, where day and night rings the shrill chorus of the  hylas and the trill of the toads continually trembles in the soft air.    The first comers of the birds are already mated and nest-building, robin  and song sparrow each in his chosen place setting the foundations of his  house with mud or threads of dry grass. The crow clutters out his  softest love note. The flicker is mining a fortress in the heart of an  old apple-tree.    The squirrels wind a swift ruddy chain about a boll in their love chase,  and even now you may surprise the vixen fox watching the first gambols  of her tawny cubs by the sunny border of the woods.    The gray haze of undergrowth and lofty ramage is turning to a misty  green, and the shadows of opening buds knot the meshed shadows of twigs  on the brown forest floor, which is splashed with white moose-flowers  and buds of bloodroot, like ivory-tipped arrows, each in a green quiver,  and yellow adder-tongues bending above their mottled beds, and rusty  trails of arbutus leaves leading to the secret of their hidden bloom,  which their fragrance half betrays.    Marsh marigolds lengthen their golden chain, link by link, along the  ditches. The maples are yellow with paler bloom, and the graceful  birches are bent with their light burden of tassels. The dandelion  answers the sun, the violet the sky. Blossom and greenness are  everywhere; even the brown paths of the plough and harrow are greening  with springing grain.    We listen to the cuckoo's monotonous flute among the white drifts of  orchard bloom and the incessant murmur of bees, the oriole's half  plaintive carol as of departed joys in the elms, and the jubilant song  of the bobolink in the meadows, where he is not an outlaw but a welcome  guest, mingling his glad notes with the merry voices of flower-gathering  children, as by and by he will with the ringing cadence of the scythe  and the vibrant chirr of the mower. Down by the flooded marshes the  scarlet of the water maples and the flash of the starling's wing are  repeated in the broad mirror of the still water. The turtle basks on the  long incline of stranded logs.    Tally-sticks cast adrift are a symbol that the trapper's warfare against  the muskrats is ended and that the decimated remnant of the tribe is  left in peace to reestablish itself. The spendthrift waste of untimely  shooting is stayed. Wild duck, plover, and snipe have entered upon the  enjoyment of a summer truce that will be unbroken, if the collector is  not abroad at whose hands science ruthlessly demands mating birds and  callow brood.    Of all sportsmen only the angler, often attended by his winged brother  the kingfisher, is astir, wandering by pleasant waters where the bass  lurks in the tangles of an eddy's writhing currents, or the perch poises  and then glides through the intangible golden meshes that waves and  sunlight knit, or where the trout lies poised beneath the silver domes  of foam bells.    The loon laughs again on the lake. Again the freed waves toss the  shadows of the shores and the white reflections of white sails, and  flash back the sunlight or the glitter of stars and the beacon's  rekindled gleam.    Sun and sky, forest, field, and water, bird and blossom, declare the  fullness of spring and the coming of summer.          XIII    THE BOBOLINK      The woods have changed from the purple of swelling buds to the tender  grayish green of opening leaves, and the sward is green again with new  grass, when this pied troubadour, more faithful to the calendar than  leaf or flower, comes back from his southern home to New England meadows  to charm others than his dusky ladylove with his merry song. He seldom  disappoints us by more than a day in the date of his arrival, and never  fails to receive a kindly welcome, though the fickle weather may be  unkind.    \"The bobolinks have come\" is as joyful a proclamation as announces the  return of the bluebird and robin. Here no shotted salute of gun awaits  him, and he is aware that he is in a friendly country. Though he does  not court familiarity, he tolerates approach; and permits you to come  within a dozen yards of the fence stake he has alighted on, and when  you come nearer he goes but to the next, singing the prelude or finale  of his song as he flies. Fewer yards above your head he poises on wing  to sing it from beginning to end, you know not whether with intent to  taunt you or to charm you, but he only accomplishes the latter. He seems  to know that he does not harm us and that he brings nothing that we  should not lose by killing him. Yet how cunningly he and his mate hide  their nest in the even expanse of grass. That is a treasure he will not  trust us with the secret of, and, though there may be a dozen in the  meadow, we rarely find one.    Our New England fathers had as kindly a feeling for this blithe comer to  their stumpy meadows, though they gave him the uncouth and malodorous  name of skunk blackbird. He sang as sweetly to them as he does to us,  and he too was a discoverer and a pioneer, finding and occupying meadows  full of sunshine where had only been the continual shade of the forest,  where no bobolink had ever been before. Now he has miles of grassy  sunlit fields wherein he sings violet and buttercup, daisy and clover  into bloom and strawberries into ripeness, and his glad song mingles  with the happy voices of the children who come to gather them, and also  chimes with the rarer music of the whetted scythe.    Then, long before the summer is past, he assumes the sober dress of his  mate and her monosyllabic note, and fades so gradually out of our sight  and hearing that he departs without our being aware of it. Summer still  burns with unabated fervor, when we suddenly realize that there are no  bobolinks. Nor are there any under the less changeful skies whither our  changed bird has flown to be a reed-bird or rice-bird and to find  mankind his enemies. He is no longer a singer but a gourmand and valued  only as a choice morsel, doubtless delicious, yet one that should choke  a New Englander.          XIV    THE GOLDEN-WINGED WOODPECKER      The migrant woodpecker whose cheery cackle assures us of the certainty  of spring is rich in names that well befit him. If you take to  high-sounding titles for your humble friends, you will accept _Colaptes  auratus_, as he flies above you, borrowing more gold of the sunbeams  that shine through his yellow pinions, or will be content to call him  simply golden-winged. When he flashes his wings in straight-away flight  before you, or sounds his sharp, single note of alarm, or peers down  from the door of his lofty tower, or hangs on its wooden wall, or  clinging to a fence stake displays his mottled back, you recognize the  fitness of each name the country folk have given him--flicker,  yellow-hammer, yarrup, highhole or highholder, and what Thoreau often  termed him, partridge-woodpecker. It is a wonder that the joyous cackle  wherewith he announces his return from his winter sojourn in the South  has not gained him another, and that love note, so like the slow  whetting of a knife upon a steel, still another. Perhaps it is because  they are especially sounds of spring and seldom if ever heard after the  season of joyful arrival and love-making.    During the same season you frequently hear him attuning his harsh sharp  voice to its softest note of endearment, a long-drawn and modulated  variation of his cackle. When household cares begin, the lord and lady  of the wooden tower, like too many greater and wiser two-legged folk,  give over singing and soft words. At home and abroad their deportment is  sober and business-like, and except for an occasional alarm-cry they are  mostly silent.    As you wander through the orchard of an early midsummer day and pause  beside an old apple-tree to listen to the cuckoo's flute or admire the  airy fabric of the wood pewee's nest, a"]]]
