I'm the Daughter of the Rainbow.\"    \"Oh!\" said Dorothy with a gasp; \"I didn't know the Rainbow had  children.  But I MIGHT have known it, before you spoke.  You couldn't  really be anything else.\"    \"Why not?\" inquired Polychrome, as if surprised.    \"Because you're so lovely and sweet.\"    The little maiden smiled through her tears, came up to Dorothy, and  placed her slender fingers in the Kansas girl's chubby hand.    \"You'll be my friend--won't you?\" she said, pleadingly.    \"Of course.\"    \"And what is your name?\"    \"I'm Dorothy; and this is my friend Shaggy Man, who owns the Love  Magnet; and this is Button-Bright--only you don't see him as he really  is because the Fox-King carelessly changed his head into a fox head.  But the real Button-Bright is good to look at, and I hope to get him  changed back to himself, some time.\"    The Rainbow's Daughter nodded cheerfully, no longer afraid of her new  companions.    \"But who is this?\" she asked, pointing to Toto, who was sitting before  her wagging his tail in the most friendly manner and admiring the  pretty maid with his bright eyes.  \"Is this, also, some enchanted  person?\"    \"Oh no, Polly--I may call you Polly, mayn't I?  Your whole name's awful  hard to say.\"    \"Call me Polly if you wish, Dorothy.\"    \"Well, Polly, Toto's just a dog; but he has more sense than  Button-Bright, to tell the truth; and I'm very fond of him.\"    \"So am I,\" said Polychrome, bending gracefully to pat Toto's head.    \"But how did the Rainbow's Daughter ever get on this lonely road, and  become lost?\" asked the shaggy man, who had listened wonderingly to all  this.    \"Why, my father stretched his rainbow over here this morning, so that  one end of it touched this road,\" was the reply; \"and I was dancing  upon the pretty rays, as I love to do, and never noticed I was getting  too far over the bend in the circle.  Suddenly I began to slide, and I  went faster and faster until at last I bumped on the ground, at the  very end.  Just then father lifted the rainbow again, without noticing  me at all, and though I tried to seize the end of it and hold fast, it  melted away entirely and I was left alone and helpless on the cold,  hard earth!\"    \"It doesn't seem cold to me, Polly,\" said Dorothy; \"but perhaps you're  not warmly dressed.\"    \"I'm so used to living nearer the sun,\" replied the Rainbow's Daughter,  \"that at first I feared I would freeze down here.  But my dance has  warmed me some, and now I wonder how I am ever to get home again.\"    \"Won't your father miss you, and look for you, and let down another  rainbow for you?\"    \"Perhaps so, but he's busy just now because it rains in so many parts  of the world at this season, and he has to set his rainbow in a lot of  different places.  What would you advise me to do, Dorothy?\"    \"Come with us,\" was the answer.  \"I'm going to try to find my way to  the Emerald City, which is in the fairy Land of Oz.  The Emerald City  is ruled by a friend of mine, the Princess Ozma, and if we can manage  to get there I'm sure she will know a way to send you home to your  father again.\"    \"Do you really think so?\" asked Polychrome, anxiously.    \"I'm pretty sure.\"    \"Then I'll go with you,\" said the little maid; \"for travel will help  keep me warm, and father can find me in one part of the world as well  as another--if he gets time to look for me.\"    \"Come along, then,\" said the shaggy man, cheerfully; and they started  on once more.  Polly walked beside Dorothy a while, holding her new  friend's hand as if she feared to let it go; but her nature seemed as  light and buoyant as her fleecy robes, for suddenly she darted ahead  and whirled round in a giddy dance.  Then she tripped back to them with  sparkling eyes and smiling cheeks, having regained her usual happy mood  and forgotten all her worry about being lost.    They found her a charming companion, and her dancing and laughter--for  she laughed at times like the tinkling of a silver bell--did much to  enliven their journey and keep them contented.          6.  The City Of Beasts      When noon came they opened the Fox-King's basket of luncheon, and found  a nice roasted turkey with cranberry sauce and some slices of bread and  butter.  As they sat on the grass by the roadside the shaggy man cut up  the turkey with his pocket-knife and passed slices of it around.    \"Haven't you any dewdrops, or mist-cakes, or cloudbuns?\" asked  Polychrome, longingly.    \"'Course not,\" replied Dorothy.  \"We eat solid things, down here on the  earth.  But there's a bottle of cold tea.  Try some, won't you?\"    The Rainbow's Daughter watched Button-Bright devour one leg of the  turkey.    \"Is it good?\" she asked.    He nodded.    \"Do you think I could eat it?\"    \"Not this,\" said Button-Bright.    \"But I mean another piece?\"    \"Don't know,\" he replied.    \"Well, I'm going to try, for I'm very hungry,\" she decided, and took a  thin slice of the white breast of turkey which the shaggy man cut for  her, as well as a bit of bread and butter.  When she tasted it  Polychrome thought the turkey was good--better even than mist-cakes;  but a little satisfied her hunger and she finished with a tiny sip of  cold tea.    \"That's about as much as a fly would eat,\" said Dorothy, who was making  a good meal herself.  \"But I know some people in Oz who eat nothing at  all.\"    \"Who are they?\" inquired the shaggy man.    \"One is a scarecrow who's stuffed with straw, and the other a woodman  made out of tin.  They haven't any appetites inside of 'em, you see; so  they never eat anything at all.\"    \"Are they alive?\" asked Button-Bright.    \"Oh yes,\" replied Dorothy; \"and they're very clever and very nice, too.  If we get to Oz I'll introduce them to you.\"    \"Do you really expect to get to Oz?\" inquired the shaggy man, taking a  drink of cold tea.    \"I don't know just what to 'spect,\" answered the child, seriously; \"but  I've noticed if I happen to get lost I'm almost sure to come to the  Land of Oz in the end, somehow 'r other; so I may get there this time.  But I can't promise, you know; all I can do is wait and see.\"    \"Will the Scarecrow scare me?\" asked Button-Bright.    \"No; 'cause you're not a crow,\" she returned.  \"He has the loveliest  smile you ever saw--only it's painted on and he can't help it.\"    Luncheon being over they started again upon their journey, the shaggy  man, Dorothy and Button-Bright walking soberly along, side by side, and  the Rainbow's Daughter dancing merrily before them.    Sometimes she darted along the road so swiftly that she was nearly out  of sight, then she came tripping back to greet them with her silvery  laughter.  But once she came back more sedately, to say:    \"There's a city a little way off.\"    \"I 'spected that,\" returned Dorothy; \"for the fox-people warned us  there was one on this road.  It's filled with stupid beasts of some  sort, but we musn't be afraid of 'em 'cause they won't hurt us.\"    \"All right,\" said Button-Bright; but Polychrome didn't know whether it  was all right or not.    \"It's a big city,\" she said, \"and the road runs straight through it.\"    \"Never mind,\" said the shaggy man; \"as long as I carry the Love Magnet  every living thing will love me, and you may be sure I shan't allow any  of my friends to be harmed in any way.\"    This comforted them somewhat, and they moved on again.  Pretty soon  they came to a signpost that read:    \"HAF A MYLE TO DUNKITON.\"      \"Oh,\" said the shaggy man, \"if they're donkeys, we've nothing to fear  at all.\"    \"They may kick,\" said Dorothy, doubtfully.    \"Then we will cut some switches, and make them behave,\" he replied.  At  the first tree he cut himself a long, slender switch from one of the  branches, and shorter switches for the others.    \"Don't be afraid to order the beasts around,\" he said; \"they're used to  it.\"    Before long the road brought them to the gates of the city.  There was  a high wall all around, which had been whitewashed, and the gate just  before our travelers was a mere opening in the wall, with no bars  across it.  No towers or steeples or domes showed above the enclosure,  nor was any living thing to be seen as our friends drew near.    Suddenly, as they were about to boldly enter through the opening, there  arose a harsh clamor of sound that swelled and echoed on every side,  until they were nearly deafened by the racket and had to put their  fingers to their ears to keep the noise out.    It was like the firing of many cannon, only there were no cannon-balls  or other missiles to be seen; it was like the rolling of mighty  thunder, only not a cloud was in the sky; it was like the roar of  countless breakers on a rugged seashore, only there was no sea or other  water anywhere about.    They hesitated to advance; but, as the noise did no harm, they entered  through the whitewashed wall and quickly discovered the cause of the  turmoil.  Inside were suspended many sheets of tin or thin iron, and  against these metal sheets a row of donkeys were pounding their heels  with vicious kicks.    The shaggy man ran up to the nearest donkey and gave the beast a sharp  blow with his switch.    \"Stop that noise!\" he shouted; and the donkey stopped kicking the metal  sheet and turned its head to look with surprise at the shaggy man.  He  switched the next donkey, and made him stop, and then the next, so that  gradually the rattling of heels ceased and the awful noise subsided.  The donkeys stood in a group and eyed the strangers with fear and  trembling.    \"What do you mean by making such a racket?\" asked the shaggy man,  sternly.    \"We were scaring away the foxes,\" said one of the donkeys, meekly.  \"Usually they run fast enough when they hear the noise, which makes  them afraid.\"    \"There are no foxes here,\" said the shaggy man.    \"I beg to differ with "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/486"],[0,"Ozma of Oz (#6)"],[1," the feast upon the rock beside her and began her dinner,  first offering some of it to Tiktok, who declined because, as he said,  he was merely a machine.  Afterward she offered to share with Billina,  but the hen murmured something about \"dead things\" and said she  preferred her bugs and ants.    \"Do the lunch-box trees and the dinner-pail trees belong to the  Wheelers?\" the child asked Tiktok, while engaged in eating her meal.    \"Of course not,\" he answered.  \"They be-long to the roy-al fam-il-y of  Ev, on-ly of course there is no roy-al fam-il-y just now be-cause King  Ev-ol-do jumped in-to the sea and his wife and ten chil-dren have been  trans-formed by the Nome King.  So there is no one to rule the Land of  Ev, that I can think of.  Per-haps it is for this rea-son that the  Wheel-ers claim the trees for their own, and pick the lunch-eons and  din-ners to eat them-selves.  But they be-long to the King, and you  will find the roy-al \"E\" stamped up-on the bot-tom of ev-er-y din-ner  pail.\"    Dorothy turned the pail over, and at once discovered the royal mark  upon it, as Tiktok had said.    \"Are the Wheelers the only folks living in the Land of Ev?\" enquired  the girl.    \"No; they on-ly in-hab-it a small por-tion of it just back of the  woods,\" replied the machine.  \"But they have al-ways been mis-chiev-ous  and im-per-ti-nent, and my old mas-ter, King Ev-ol-do, used to car-ry a  whip with him, when he walked out, to keep the crea-tures in or-der.  When I was first made the Wheel-ers tried to run o-ver me, and butt me  with their heads; but they soon found I was built of too sol-id a  ma-ter-i-al for them to in-jure.\"    \"You seem very durable,\" said Dorothy.  \"Who made you?\"    \"The firm of Smith & Tin-ker, in the town of Evna, where the roy-al  pal-ace stands,\" answered Tiktok.    \"Did they make many of you?\" asked the child.    \"No; I am the on-ly au-to-mat-ic me-chan-i-cal man they ev-er  com-plet-ed,\" he replied.  \"They were ver-y won-der-ful in-ven-tors,  were my mak-ers, and quite ar-tis-tic in all they did.\"    \"I am sure of that,\" said Dorothy.  \"Do they live in the town of Evna  now?\"    \"They are both gone,\" replied the machine.  \"Mr. Smith was an art-ist,  as well as an in-vent-or, and he paint-ed a pic-ture of a riv-er which  was so nat-ur-al that, as he was reach-ing a-cross it to paint some  flow-ers on the op-po-site bank, he fell in-to the wa-ter and was  drowned.\"    \"Oh, I'm sorry for that!\" exclaimed the little girl.    \"Mis-ter Tin-ker,\" continued Tiktok, \"made a lad-der so tall that he  could rest the end of it a-gainst the moon, while he stood on the  high-est rung and picked the lit-tle stars to set in the points of the  king's crown.  But when he got to the moon Mis-ter Tin-ker found it  such a love-ly place that he de-cid-ed to live there, so he pulled up  the lad-der af-ter him and we have nev-er seen him since.\"    \"He must have been a great loss to this country,\" said Dorothy, who was  by this time eating her custard pie.    \"He was,\" acknowledged Tiktok.  \"Also he is a great loss to me.  For if  I should get out of or-der I do not know of an-y one a-ble to re-pair  me, be-cause I am so com-pli-cat-ed.  You have no i-de-a how full of  ma-chin-er-y I am.\"    \"I can imagine it,\" said Dorothy, readily.    \"And now,\" continued the machine, \"I must stop talk-ing and be-gin  think-ing a-gain of a way to es-cape from this rock.\"  So he turned  half way around, in order to think without being disturbed.    \"The best thinker I ever knew,\" said Dorothy to the yellow hen, \"was a  scarecrow.\"    \"Nonsense!\" snapped Billina.    \"It is true,\" declared Dorothy.  \"I met him in the Land of Oz, and he  traveled with me to the city of the great Wizard of Oz, so as to get  some brains, for his head was only stuffed with straw.  But it seemed  to me that he thought just as well before he got his brains as he did  afterward.\"    \"Do you expect me to believe all that rubbish about the Land of Oz?\"  enquired Billina, who seemed a little cross--perhaps because bugs were  scarce.    \"What rubbish?\" asked the child, who was now finishing her nuts and  raisins.    \"Why, your impossible stories about animals that can talk, and a tin  woodman who is alive, and a scarecrow who can think.\"    \"They are all there,\" said Dorothy, \"for I have seen them.\"    \"I don't believe it!\" cried the hen, with a toss of her head.    \"That's 'cause you're so ign'rant,\" replied the girl, who was a little  offended at her friend Billina's speech.    \"In the Land of Oz,\" remarked Tiktok, turning toward them, \"an-y-thing  is pos-si-ble.  For it is a won-der-ful fair-y coun-try.\"    \"There, Billina! what did I say?\" cried Dorothy.  And then she turned  to the machine and asked in an eager tone: \"Do you know the Land of Oz,  Tiktok?\"    \"No; but I have heard a-bout it,\" said the cop-per man.  \"For it is  on-ly sep-a-ra-ted from this Land of Ev by a broad des-ert.\"    Dorothy clapped her hands together delightedly.    \"I'm glad of that!\" she exclaimed.  \"It makes me quite happy to be so  near my old friends.  The scarecrow I told you of, Billina, is the King  of the Land of Oz.\"    \"Par-don me.  He is not the king now,\" said Tiktok.    \"He was when I left there,\" declared Dorothy.    \"I know,\" said Tiktok, \"but there was a rev-o-lu-tion in the Land of  Oz, and the Scare-crow was de-posed by a sol-dier wo-man named  Gen-er-al Jin-jur.  And then Jin-jur was de-posed by a lit-tle girl  named Oz-ma, who was the right-ful heir to the throne and now rules the  land un-der the ti-tle of Oz-ma of Oz.\"    \"That is news to me,\" said Dorothy, thoughtfully.  \"But I s'pose lots  of things have happened since I left the Land of Oz.  I wonder what has  become of the Scarecrow, and of the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion.  And I wonder who this girl Ozma is, for I never heard of her before.\"    But Tiktok did not reply to this.  He had turned around again to resume  his thinking.    Dorothy packed the rest of the food back into the pail, so as not to be  wasteful of good things, and the yellow hen forgot her dignity far  enough to pick up all of the scattered crumbs, which she ate rather  greedily, although she had so lately pretended to despise the things  that Dorothy preferred as food.    By this time Tiktok approached them with his stiff bow.    \"Be kind e-nough to fol-low me,\" he said, \"and I will lead you a-way  from here to the town of Ev-na, where you will be more com-for-ta-ble,  and al-so I will pro-tect you from the Wheel-ers.\"    \"All right,\" answered Dorothy, promptly.  \"I'm ready!\"          6.  The Heads of Langwidere      They walked slowly down the path between the rocks, Tiktok going first,  Dorothy following him, and the yellow hen trotting along last of all.    At the foot of the path the copper man leaned down and tossed aside  with ease the rocks that encumbered the way.  Then he turned to Dorothy  and said:    \"Let me car-ry your din-ner-pail.\"    She placed it in his right hand at once, and the copper fingers closed  firmly over the stout handle.    Then the little procession marched out upon the level sands.    As soon as the three Wheelers who were guarding the mound saw them,  they began to shout their wild cries and rolled swiftly toward the  little group, as if to capture them or bar their way.  But when the  foremost had approached near enough, Tiktok swung the tin dinner-pail  and struck the Wheeler a sharp blow over its head with the queer  weapon.  Perhaps it did not hurt very much, but it made a great noise,  and the Wheeler uttered a howl and tumbled over upon its side.  The  next minute it scrambled to its wheels and rolled away as fast as it  could go, screeching with fear at the same time.    \"I told you they were harm-less,\" began Tiktok; but before he could say  more another Wheeler was upon them.  Crack! went the dinner-pail  against its head, knocking its straw hat a dozen feet away; and that  was enough for this Wheeler, also.  It rolled away after the first one,  and the third did not wait to be pounded with the pail, but joined its  fellows as quickly as its wheels would whirl.    The yellow hen gave a cackle of delight, and flying to a perch upon  Tiktok's shoulder, she said:    \"Bravely done, my copper friend! and wisely thought of, too.  Now we  are free from those ugly creatures.\"    But just then a large band of Wheelers rolled from the forest, and  relying upon their numbers to conquer, they advanced fiercely upon  Tiktok.  Dorothy grabbed Billina in her arms and held her tight, and  the machine embraced the form of the little girl with his left arm, the  better to protect her.  Then the Wheelers were upon them.    Rattlety, bang! bang! went the dinner-pail in every direction, and it  made so much clatter bumping against the heads of the Wheelers that  they were much more frightened than hurt and fled in a great panic.  All, that is, except their leader.  This Wheeler had stumbled against  another and fallen flat upon his back, and before he could get his  wheels under him to rise again, Tiktok had fastened his copper fingers  into the neck of the gorgeous jacket of his foe and held him fast.    \"Tell your peo-ple to go a-way,\" commanded the machine.    The leader of the Wheelers hesitated to give this order, so Tiktok  shook him as a terrier dog does a rat, until the Wheeler's teeth  rattled together with a noise like hailstones on a window pane.  Then,  as soon as the creature could get its breath, it shouted to the others  to roll away, which they immediately did.    \"Now,\" said Tiktok, \"you shall come with us and tell me what I want to  know.\"    \"You'll be sorry for treating me in this way,\" whined the Wheeler.  \"I'm a terribly fierce person.\"    \"As for that,\" answered Tiktok, \"I am only a ma-chine, and can-not feel  sor-row or joy, no mat-ter what hap-pens.  But you are wrong to think  your-self ter-ri-ble or fierce.\"    \"Why so?\" asked the Wheeler.    \"Be-cause no one else thinks as"]]]
