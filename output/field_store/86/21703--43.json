We  must not count upon our personal qualities, however admirable and  commendable, to gain us admission into the divine presence. Man's  proper attitude, as a seeker for salvation, is one of humility, not of  self-righteousness. When the Pharisee and the Publican prayed in the  Temple at Jerusalem, the former thanking the Lord that he was better  than other men, and the latter meekly murmuring: \"God be merciful to  me, a sinner,\" the Savior, pointing to the Publican, said: That man is  justified, rather than the other, \"for every one that exalteth himself  shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted\" (Luke  18:13,14).    Obedience Better Than Sacrifice.--\"Obedience is better than sacrifice.\"  So said obedient Samuel to disobedient Saul. Adam's obedience in  offering sacrifice without knowing why, simply because the Lord had  commanded him (Moses 5:6) Abraham's obedience in offering Isaac--for  the same reason--was far more precious in the sight of heaven than the  sacrifice itself. In Abraham's case the will was taken for the deed,  and the Father of the Faithful was blessed as abundantly as if the  sacrifice had been consummated.    Dead Letter and Living Oracle.--Suppose, however, that Abraham had  not obeyed the Lord's second command, \"Lay not thy hand upon the  lad.\" In that event he would have been in transgression, and could  not have been blessed any more than if he had disobeyed in the first  instance. In the face of that second command, he could not have pleaded  consistently that he was under obligation to obey the first. \"My word  is my law,\" saith the Lord, and his latest word, even though it seem to  contradict an earlier behest from the same source, must always be given  precedence. The choice in such a case is between the dead letter and  the living oracle.    All Blessings Come by Obedience.--It is the rod of power which smites  the rock of divine providence, causing it to flow with the waters of  human weal.    The Justice of God.--When the Savior uttered his exhortation: \"Be ye  therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect,\"  and added, \"For he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the  good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust\" (Matt. 5:45),  he did not mean that the Lord makes no distinction between the two  classes; but meant that he is just to both--just even to the unjust,  upon whom he sends his rain and sunshine, causing their orchards to  bloom and their vineyards to bear equally with those of the righteous.  Nevertheless, all who receive such blessings must merit them. If the  unjust (unjust here) had not kept their first estate, thereby showing  some degree of obedience to divine law, they would not have been given  a second estate, where the sunlight and the rains could reach them. In  this second estate, however, further obedience is requisite, in order  that greater benefits may follow.    Blessings Bestowed by Law.--God's blessings are temporal as well as  spiritual, and their bestowal is regulated by law. A bad man may be  a good farmer or a good artisan, and reap reward for obedience to  the law of industry in the exercise of his vocation. But there are  greater blessings than those which come from the workshop and the  harvest field; and they can be had only by obedience to the higher laws  governing their distribution. One cannot become a member of the Church  of Christ by being an expert tiller of the soil. It requires more than  the skill of a mechanic to get into the kingdom of heaven. There is but  one way into that kingdom--a way pointed out by the finger of God--and  any person who tries to get in by picking the lock or by climbing over  the wall, will be treated as a trespasser, as a would-be thief and  robber.    What Must Man Do for Himself?--What particular acts of obedience are  required of man, in order that God, who redeemed him, may likewise save  and exalt him? What must he do for himself, that he may profit fully  by the great things done in his behalf? How shall this alien become  naturalized? The ladder having been let down into the pit, how shall  the fallen avail himself of the divine assistance offered?    The answer is plain: He must climb, if he would get out. While there  was no ladder, he could not, and all his intelligence and skill were  unavailing. But now, if he will use his God-given powers and the means  provided, he may climb from earth to heaven, round by round. If he  refuses to climb, who but himself is responsible for his remaining in  the pit?    The Most Important Personage.--This gospel code--this way into the  kingdom--what is it? What does it consist of? What are the divine laws  of naturalization? What requirements are made of those who would be  identified with the Church of Christ--who would be saved in this world  and in the world to come? The man who can answer, to the spiritually  unenlightened, such questions as these, is easily the most important  personage of his generation. Such a man was the Apostle Peter, and such  another was the Prophet Joseph Smith.    The Pentecostal Proclamation.--When Peter, on the day of Pentecost,  preached \"Christ and him crucified,\" and the conscience-stricken  multitude cried out: \"Men and brethren, what shall we do?\" a question  was propounded which the most learned philosophers of that age could  not answer. Caesar, sitting upon the throne of the world, would have  been mystified had the question been put to him: What shall men do to  be saved? Not so Peter, the Galilean fisherman. He knew what men must  do, and he straightway told them what to do:    \"Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus  Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the  Holy Ghost\" (Acts 2:38).    [Footnote A: An idea advanced by President George Q. Cannon.]        CHAPTER II.    Faith.    The First Requirement.--Faith, however, not repentance, is the first  requirement. The probable reason why Peter omitted to mention faith  at that time, was because he perceived that the multitude already  had faith, already believed what he had told them of the crucified  Redeemer. Had it been otherwise, they would not have been \"pricked in  their heart.\" and would not have anxiously inquired, \"What shall we  do?\" Belief was the first requirement made by the Savior, through his  chosen twelve, when he sent them \"into all the world\" to \"preach the  gospel to every creature\" (Mark 16:16). He declared salvation dependent  on faith and works: \"He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved,  and he that believeth not shall be damned.\" For faith is shown by works  (James 2:18), and each is dead without the other.    The Foundation of All Righteousness.--Faith, according to the Doctrine  and Covenants, is \"the first principle in revealed religion, and the  foundation of all righteousness.\" There are few things more lucid in  our literature than the Lectures on Faith which form the fore part of  that sacred volume--one of the four doctrinal standards of the Church;  the other three being the Bible, the Book of Mormon, and the Pearl  of Great Price. Beginning with the text, \"Now faith is the substance  [assurance] of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen\" (Heb.  11:1), the lecturer goes on to say:    The Moving Cause of All Action.--\"If men were duly to consider  themselves, and turn their thoughts and reflections to the operations  of their own minds, they would readily discover that it is faith, and  faith only, which is the moving cause of all action in them; that  without it both mind and body would be in a state of inactivity, and  all their exertions would cease, both physical and mental.\"    \"Were this class to go back and reflect upon the history of their  lives, from the period of their first recollection, and ask themselves  what principle excited them to action, or what gave them energy and  activity in all their lawful avocations, callings, and pursuits, what  would be the answer? Would it not be that it was the assurance which  they had of the existence of things which they had not seen as yet?  Was it not the hope which you had in consequence of your belief in the  existence of unseen things, which stimulated you to action and exertion  in order to obtain them? Are you not dependent on your faith, or  belief, for the acquisition of all knowledge, wisdom, and intelligence?  Would you exert yourselves to obtain wisdom and intelligence, unless  you did believe that you could obtain them? Would you have ever sown,  if you had not believed that you would reap? Would you ever planted,  if you had not believed that you would gather? Would you have ever  asked, unless you had believed that you would receive? Would you have  ever sought, unless you had believed that you would have found? Or,  would have been opened unto you? In a word, is there anything that you  would have done, either physical or mental, if you had not previously  believed? Are not all your exertions of every kind, dependent on your  faith? Or, may we not ask, what have you, or what do you possess which  you have not obtained by reason of your faith? Your food, your raiment,  your lodgings, are they not all by reason of your faith? Reflect, and  ask yourselves if these things are not so. Turn your thoughts on your  own minds, and see if faith is not the moving cause of all action in  yourselves; and, if the moving cause in you, is it not in all other  intelligent beings?\" * * * *    A Principle of Power.--\"As we receive by faith all temporal blessings  that we do receive, so we in like manner receive by faith all spiritual  blessings that we do receive. But faith is not only the principle of  action, but of power also, in all intelligent beings, whether in heaven  or on earth. Thus says the author of the epistle to the Heb. 11:3:  `Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word  of God; so that things which are seen"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5061"],[0,"The Children's Book of Christmas Stories (#6)"],[1,"she went away Miss Bennett asked her to come again,  a thing she had never been known to do before, for she was not fond of  young people in general.    \"But, then, Hetty's different,\" she said to herself, when wondering at  her own interest.    \"Did you thank kind Miss Bennett?\" was her mother's question as Hetty  opened the door.    Hetty stopped as if struck, \"Why, no! I don't think I did.\"    \"And stayed so long, too? Whatever did you do? I've heard she isn't fond  of people generally.\"    \"We talked; and--I think she's ever so nice. She asked me to come again;  may I?\"    \"Of course you may, if she cares to have you. I should be glad to do  something to please her.\"    That visit of Hetty's was the first of a long series. Almost every day  she found her way to the lonely cottage, where a visitor rarely came,  and a strange intimacy grew up between the old and the young. Hetty  learned of her friend to knit, and many an hour they spent knitting  while Miss Bennett ransacked her memory for stories to tell. And then,  one day, she brought down from a big chest in the garret two of the  books she used to have when she was young, and let Hetty look at them.    One was \"Thaddeus of Warsaw,\" and the other \"Scottish Chiefs.\" Poor  Hetty had not the dozens of books you have, and these were treasures  indeed. She read them to herself, and she read them aloud to Miss  Bennett, who, much to her own surprise, found her interest almost as  eager as Hetty's.    All this time Christmas was drawing near, and strange, unusual feelings  began to stir in Miss Bennett's heart, though generally she did not  think much about that happy time. She wanted to make Hetty a happy day.  Money she had none, so she went into the garret, where her youthful  treasures had long been hidden. From the chest from which she had  taken the books she now took a small box of light-coloured wood, with  a transferred engraving on the cover. With a sigh--for the sight of it  brought up old memories--Miss Bennett lifted the cover by its loop of  ribbon, took out a package of old letters, and went downstairs with the  box, taking also a few bits of bright silk from a bundle in the chest.    \"I can fit it up for a workbox,\" she said, \"and I'm sure Hetty will like  it.\"    For many days after this Miss Bennett had her secret work, which she  carefully hid when she saw Hetty coming. Slowly, in this way, she made  a pretty needle-book, a tiny pincushion, and an emery bag like a big  strawberry. Then from her own scanty stock she added needles, pins,  thread, and her only pair of small scissors, scoured to the last extreme  of brightness.    One thing only she had to buy--a thimble, and that she bought for a  penny, of brass so bright it was quite as handsome as gold.    Very pretty the little box looked when full; in the bottom lay a quilted  lining, which had always been there, and upon this the fittings she  had made. Besides this, Miss Bennett knit a pair of mittens for each of  Hetty's brothers and sisters.    The happiest girl in town on Christmas morning was Hetty Stanley. To  begin with, she had the delight of giving the mittens to the children,  and when she ran over to tell Miss Bennett how pleased they were, she  was surprised by the present of the odd little workbox and its pretty  contents.    Christmas was over all too soon, and New Year's, and it was about the  middle of January that the time came which, all her life, Miss Bennett  had dreaded--the time when she should be helpless. She had not money  enough to hire a girl, and so the only thing she could imagine when that  day should come was her special horror--the poorhouse.    But that good deed of hers had already borne fruit, and was still  bearing. When Hetty came over one day, and found her dear friend lying  on the floor as if dead, she was dreadfully frightened, of course, but  she ran after the neighbours and the doctor, and bustled about the house  as if she belonged to it.    Miss Bennett was not dead--she had a slight stroke of paralysis; and  though she was soon better, and would be able to talk, and probably to  knit, and possibly to get about the house, she would never be able to  live alone and do everything for herself, as she had done.    So the doctor told the neighbours who came in to help, and so Hetty  heard, as she listened eagerly for news.    \"Of course she can't live here any longer; she'll have to go to a  hospital,\" said one woman.    \"Or to the poorhouse, more likely,\" said another.    \"She'll hate that,\" said the first speaker. \"I've heard her shudder over  the poorhouse.\"    \"She shall never go there!\" declared Hetty, with blazing eyes.    \"Hoity-toity! who's to prevent?\" asked the second speaker, turning a  look of disdain on Hetty.    \"I am,\" was the fearless answer. \"I know all Miss Bennett's ways, and  I can take care of her, and I will,\" went on Hetty indignantly; and  turning suddenly, she was surprised to find Miss Bennett's eyes fixed on  her with an eager, questioning look.    \"There! she understands! she's better!\" cried Hetty. \"Mayn't I stay and  take care of you, dear Miss Bennett?\" she asked, running up to the bed.    \"Yes, you may,\" interrupted the doctor, seeing the look in his patient's  face; \"but you mustn't agitate her now. And now, my good women\"--turning  to the others--\"I think she can get along with her young friend here,  whom I happen to know is a womanly young girl, and will be attentive and  careful.\"    They took the hint and went away, and the doctor gave directions to  Hetty what to do, telling her she must not leave Miss Bennett. So she  was now regularly installed as nurse and housekeeper.    Days and weeks rolled by. Miss Bennett was able to be up in her chair,  to talk and knit, and to walk about the house, but was not able to be  left alone. Indeed, she had a horror of being left alone; she could  not bear Hetty out of her sight, and Hetty's mother was very willing to  spare her, for she had many mouths to fill.    To provide food for two out of what had been scrimping for one was a  problem; but Miss Bennett ate very little, and she did not resume her  tea so they managed to get along and not really suffer.    One day Hetty sat by the fire with her precious box on her knee, which  she was putting to rights for the twentieth time. The box was empty, and  her sharp young eyes noticed a little dust on the silk lining.    \"I think I'll take this out and dust it,\" she said to Miss Bennett, \"if  you don't mind.\"    \"Do as you like with it,\" answered Miss Bennett; \"it is yours.\"    So she carefully lifted the silk, which stuck a little.    \"Why, here's something under it,\" she said--\"an old paper, and it has  writing on.\"    \"Bring it to me,\" said Miss Bennett; \"perhaps it's a letter I have  forgotten.\"    Hetty brought it.    \"Why, it's father's writing!\" said Miss Bennett, looking closely at  the faded paper; \"and what can it mean? I never saw it before. It says,  'Look, and ye shall find'--that's a Bible text. And what is this under  it? 'A word to the wise is sufficient.' I don't understand--he must have  put it there himself, for I never took that lining out--I thought it was  fastened. What can it mean?\" and she pondered over it long, and all day  seemed absent-minded.    After tea, when they sat before the kitchen fire, as they always did,  with only the firelight flickering and dancing on the walls while they  knitted, or told stories, or talked, she told Hetty about her father:  that they had lived comfortably in this house, which he built, and that  everybody supposed that he had plenty of money, and would leave enough  to take care of his only child, but that when he died suddenly nothing  had been found, and nothing ever had been, from that day to this.    \"Part of the place I let to John Thompson, Hetty, and that rent is all  I have to live on. I don't know what makes me think of old times so  to-night.\"    \"I know,\" said Hetty; \"it's that paper, and I know what it reminds me  of,\" she suddenly shouted, in a way very unusual with her. \"It's  that tile over there,\" and she jumped up and ran to the side of the  fireplace, and put her hand on the tile she meant.    On each side of the fireplace was a row of tiles. They were Bible  subjects, and Miss Bennett had often told Hetty the story of each one,  and also the stories she used to make up about them when she was young.  The one Hetty had her hand on now bore the picture of a woman standing  before a closed door, and below her the words of the yellow bit of  paper: \"Look, and ye shall find.\"    \"I always felt there was something different about that,\" said Hetty  eagerly, \"and you know you told me your father talked to you about  it--about what to seek in the world when he was gone away, and other  things.\"    \"Yes, so he did,\" said Miss Bennett thoughtfully; \"come to think of it,  he said a great deal about it, and in a meaning way. I don't understand  it,\" she said slowly, turning it over in her mind.    \"I do!\" cried Hetty, enthusiastically. \"I believe you are to seek here!  I believe it's loose!\" and she tried to shake it. \"It IS loose!\" she  cried excitedly. \"Oh, Miss Bennett, may I take it out?\"    Miss Bennett had turned deadly pale. \"Yes,\" she gasped, hardly knowing  what she expected, or dared to hope.    A sudden push from Hetty's strong fingers, and the tile slipped out  at one side and fell to the floor. Behind it was an opening into the  brickwork. Hetty thrust in her hand.    \"There's something in there!\" she said in an awed tone.    \"A light!\" said Miss Bennett hoarsely.    There was not a candle in the house, but Hetty seized a brand from the  fire, and held it up and looked in.    \"It looks like bags--tied up,\" she cried. \"Oh, come here yourself!\"    The old woman hobbled over and thrust her hand into the hole, bringing  out what was once a bag, but which crumpled to pieces in her hands, and  with it--oh, wonder!--a handful of gold pieces, which"]]]
