One can find examples of such conditions  almost any summer's day by a little searching of trees or shrubs.    This law of counter-shading, however, is really only the basis for the  coloration of caterpillars or other animals. It tends, chiefly, to  make the creature appear as a flat plane when seen from the side, and  may be said in a way to prepare the canvas upon which Nature paints  her more distinctive pictures. A great many examples of color markings  that tend to conceal the caterpillar amid its natural surroundings may  be found by any one who will study the subject and it offers one of  the most interesting fields for investigation. The chapter on  caterpillars in the above-mentioned book by Mr. Thayer should serve as  a starting point for any one taking up the subject.    Butterflies differ from caterpillars and from most other animals in  the fact that their coloring is chiefly shown upon the flat surfaces  of the wings. Consequently, there is less opportunity for the various  phases of counter-shading which is so commonly shown in the larger  caterpillars. The bodies of nearly all butterflies do exhibit this  phenomenon, but these bodies are relatively so small that  counter-shading plays but a little part in the general display.    Upon the outstretched membranes of the butterflies' wings Nature  through the long ages of development has painted a great variety of  pictures. Those which tend to protect the insect by concealment amid  its surroundings are most commonly spread on the under surface of the  wings. Especially is this true in the case of those species which pass  the winter as adults or which have the habit of resting upon the bark  of trees, the sides of rocks, or the surface of the ground. We here  find some of the most interesting examples of obliterative coloring  that occur in nature. Some butterflies have taken on the look of tree  bark, others the sombre appearance of weathered rocks, while still  others are painted with the images of flowerets and their stems.      _Dazzling and Eclipsing Colors_    Many of the butterflies, especially the Angle-wings, which are marked  on the under surface in various protective colors, are admirable  examples of that phase of animal coloring which is spoken of as  _dazzling coloration_. This is apparently one of the most important  protective devices to be found in Nature and the validity of it is now  generally conceded by naturalists. One phase of it, which may be  called eclipsing coloration, seems to have been first definitely  formulated by the late Lord Walsingham, a famous English entomologist  who enunciated it in an address as president of the Entomological  Society of London. The most significant paragraphs in that address  were these:    \"My attention was lately drawn to a passage in Herbert Spencer's  'Essay on the Morals of Trade.' He writes: 'As when tasting different  foods or wines the palate is disabled by something strongly flavored  from appreciating the more delicate flavor of another thing afterward  taken, so with the other organs of sense a temporary disability  follows an excessive stimulation. This holds not only with the eyes in  judging of colors, but also with the fingers in judging of texture.'    \"Here, I think, we have an explanation of the principle on which  protection is undoubtedly afforded to certain insects by the  possession of bright coloring on such parts of their wings or bodies  as can be instantly covered and concealed at will. It is an undoubted  fact, and one which must have been observed by nearly all collectors  of insects abroad, and perhaps also in our own country, that it is  more easy to follow with the eye the rapid movements of a more  conspicuous insect soberly and uniformly colored than those of an  insect capable of changing in an instant the appearance it presents.  The eye, having once fixed itself upon an object of a certain form and  color, conveys to the mind a corresponding impression, and, if that  impression is suddenly found to be unreliable, the instruction which  the mind conveys to the eye becomes also unreliable, and the rapidity  with which the impression and consequent instruction can be changed  cannot always compete successfully with the rapid transformation  effected by the insect in its effort to escape.\"    Lord Walsingham then goes on to suggest that this intermittent play of  bright colors probably has as confusing effect upon birds and other  predaceous vertebrates as upon man; and that on this hypothesis such  colors can be accounted for more satisfactorily than upon any other  yet suggested. Since then the significance of this theory has been  repeatedly pointed out by Professor Poulton, Mr. Abbott H. Thayer, and  various other authorities upon animal coloring. The terms _dazzling_  and _eclipsing_ have been applied to the phenomenon.    Shortly after Lord Walsingham propounded this theory I called  attention [A] to its fitness in explaining some of the most interesting  color phases shown by American insects, notably the moths and locusts  which have brilliantly colored under wings and protectively colored  upper wings.       [A] _Popular Science Monthly_, 1898, \"A Game of Hide and Seek.\"         Reprinted in the _Insect World_, 1899.    The animals of the north show numberless color phases of interest. One  of the most curious of these is exhibited by several families of  insects in which the outer wings are protectively colored in dull hues  and the under wings brightly colored. For example, there are many  species of moths belonging to the genus Catocala found throughout the  United States. These are insects of good size, the larger ones  measuring three inches in expanse of wings, and the majority of them  being at least two thirds that size. Most of them live during the day  on the bark of trees, with their front wings folded together over the  back. The colors and markings of these wings, as well as of the rest  of the exposed portions of the body, are such as to assimilate closely  with the bark of the tree upon which the insect rests. In such a  situation it requires a sharp eye to detect the presence of the moth,  which, unless disturbed, flies only at night, remaining all day  exposed to the attacks of many enemies. Probably the most important of  these are the birds, especially species like the woodpeckers, which  are constantly exploring all portions of the trunks of trees.    The chief beauty of these Catocalas, as they are seen spread out in  the museum cabinet, lies in the fact that the hind wings, which, when  the moth is at rest in life, are concealed by the front ones, are  brightly colored in contrasting hues of black, red, and white in  various brilliant combinations. These colors, in connection with the  soft and blended tones of the front wings, make a very handsome  insect.    It is easy to see that when one of these Underwing Moths is driven to  flight by a woodpecker or other bark-searching bird it would show  during its rapid, irregular flight the bright colors of the under  wings which would be instantly hidden upon alighting and the very  different coloring of the upper wings blending with the bark would be  substituted. Consequently, the bird would be very likely to be baffled  in its pursuit.      _Coloration of Locusts_    On the rocky hills and sandy plains of New England there are several  species of grasshoppers or locusts that also illustrate these  principles. If you walk along a strip of sandy land in summer, you  start to flight certain locusts which soon alight, and when searched  for will be found closely to assimilate in color the sand upon which  they rest. On a neighboring granite-ribbed hill you will find few if  any of this species of locust, but instead there occur two or three  quite different species, which when at rest closely resemble the  lichen-covered rocks. This resemblance is very striking, and is found  in all stages of the insect's existence. If now you go to a lowland  meadow, still another color phase will be found to prevail--the green  grass is swarming with the so-called \"long-horned\" grasshoppers,  which are green throughout with linear bodies, and long, slender legs  and antennae.    Each of these three groups of insects is adapted to its particular  habitat. All are constantly persecuted by birds, and have been so  persecuted for unnumbered ages in the past. In every generation the  individuals have varied, some toward closer resemblance to  environment, others in an opposite direction. The more conspicuous  insects have been constantly taken, and the least conspicuous as  constantly left to reproduce. Were the three groups to change places  to-day, the green grasshoppers from the meadows going to sandy  surfaces, the sand-colored locusts going to rocky hills, and the  \"mossbacks\" from the hills to the lowland meadows, each would become  conspicuous, and the birds would have such a feast as is seldom spread  before them.    The species living on sand and rocks are often \"flushed\" by birds.  Those which flew but a few feet would be likely to be captured by the  pursuing bird; those which flew farther would stand a better chance of  escaping. Similarly, those which flew slowly and in a straight line  would be more likely to be caught than those which flew rapidly and  took a zigzag course. As a consequence of the selection thus brought  about through the elimination of those which flew slowly along the  straight and narrow way that led to death, you will find that most  locusts living in exposed situations when startled fly some distance  in a rapid, zigzag manner.    But still another element of safety has been introduced by some  species of these locusts through the adoption of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3708"],[0,"An Introduction to Chemical Science (#6)"],[1,", add  more HCl. Collect several receivers of the gas over water, adding  small quantities of HCl when necessary. Observe the black  floating residuum; it is carbon, lead, etc. With a glass plate  remove the receivers, keeping them inverted (Fig. 11), or the H  will escape.    32. The Chemical Change is as follows:--    Zinc + hydrogen chloride = zinc chloride + hydrogen.    Zn + 2 HCl = ZnCl2 + 2H.    Complete by adding the weights, and explain. Notice that the  water does not take part in the change; it is added to dissolve  the ZnCl2 formed, and thus keep it from coating the Zn and  preventing further action of the acid. Note also that Zn has  simply changed places with H, one atom of the former having  driven off two atoms of the latter. The H, having nothing to  unite with, is set free as a gas, and collected over water. Of  course Zn must have a stronger chemical affinity for Cl than H  has, or the change could not have taken place. Why one Zn atom  replaces two H atoms will be explained later, asfar as an  explanation is possible. This equation, should be studied  carefully, as a type of all equations. The left-hand member shows  what were taken, i.e. the factors; the right-hand shows what were  obtained, i.e. the products. H2SO4 might have been used instead  of HCl. In that case the reaction, or equation, would have been:  --    Zinc + hydrogen sulphate = zinc sulphate + hydrogen.    Zn + H2SO4 = ZnSO4 + 2H.    Iron might have been used instead of zinc, in which case the  reactions would have been:--    Iron + hydrogen chloride = iron chloride + hydrogen.    Fe + 2 HCl = FeCl2 + 2 H.    Iron + hydrogen sulphate = iron sulphate + hydrogen.    Fe + H2SO4 = FeSO4 + 2 H.    Write the weights and explain the equations. The latter should be  memorized.    33. Properties.    Experiment 21.--Lift with the left hand a receiver of H, still  inverted, and insert a burning splinter with the right (Fig. 12).  Does the splinter continue to burn? Does the gas burn?  If so,  where?  Is the light brilliant? Note the color of the flame. Is  there any explosion? Try this experiment with several receivers.  Is the gas a supporter of combustion? i.e. will carbon burn in  it? Is it combustible? i.e. does it burn?  If so, it unites with  some part of the air. With what part?34. Collecting H by Upward  Displacement.    Experiment 22.--Pass a d.t. from a H generator to the top of a  receiver or t.t. (Fig. 13). The escaping H being so much lighter  than air will force the latter down. To obtain the gas unmixed  with air, the d.t. should tightly fit a cardboard placed under  the mouth of the receiver. When filled, the receiver can be  removed, inverted as usual, and the gas tested. In this and other  experiments for generating H, a thistle-tube, the end of which  dips under the liquid, can be used for pouring in acid, as in  Figure 13.    35. Philosopher's Lamp and Musical Flame.    Experiment 23.--Fit to a cork a piece of glass tubing 10 or 15  cm. long, having the outer end drawn out to a point with a small  opening, and insert it in the H generator. Before igniting the  gas at the end of the tube take the, precaution to collect a t.t.  of it by upward displacement, and bring this in contact with a  flame. If a sharp explosion ensues, air is not wholly expelled  from the generator, and it would be dangerous to light the gas.  When no sound, or very little, follows, light the escaping gas.  The generation of H must not be too rapid, neither should the  t.t. be held under the face, as the cork is liable to be forced  out by the pressure of H. A safety-tube, similar to the thistle-  tube above, will prevent this. This apparatus is called the  \"philosopher's lamp.\"  Thrust the flame into a long glass tube 1-  1/2 to 3 cm. in diameter, as shown in Figure 14, and listen for a  musical note.    36. Product of Burning H in Air.    Experiment 24.--Fill a tube 2 or 3 cm. in diameter with calcium  chloride, CaCl2, and connect one end with a generator of H (Fig.  15). At the other end have a philosopher's lamp-tube.Observing  the usual precautions, light the gas and hold over it a receiver,  till quite a quantity of moisture collects. All water was taken  from the gas by the dryer, CaCl2. What is, therefore, the product  of burning H in air? Complete this equation and explain it: 2H +  O = ? Figure 16 shows a drying apparatus arranged to hold CaCl2.    [Fig. 15][Fig. 16]    37. Explosiveness of H.    Experiment 25. -- Fill a soda-water bottle of thick glass with  water, invert it in a pneumatic trough, and collect not over 1/4  full of H. Now remove the bottle, still inverted, letting air in  to fill the other 3/4. Mix the air and H by covering the mouth of  the bottle with the hand, and shaking well; then hold the mouth  of the bottle, slightly inclined, in a flame. Explain the  explosion which follows. If 3/4 was air, what part was O? What  use did the N serve? Note any danger in exploding H mixed with  pure O. What proportions of O and H by volume would be most  dangerously explosive? What proportion by weight?    By the rapid union of the two elements, the high temperature  suddenly expanded the gaseous product, which immediately  contracted; both expansion and contraction produced the noise of  explosion.    38. Pure H Is a Gas without Color, Odor, or Taste.    --It is the lightest of the elements, 14 1/2 times as light  asair. It occurs uncombined in coal-mines, and some other places,  but the readiness with which it unites with other elements,  particularly O, prevents its accumulation in large quantities. It  constitutes two-thirds of the volume of the gases resulting from  the decomposition of water, and one-ninth of the weight. Compute  the latter from its symbol. It is a constituent of plants and  animals, and some rocks. Considering the volume of the ocean, the  total amount of H is large. It can be separated from H2O by  electrolysis, or by C, as in the manufacture of water gas.    When burned with O it forms H2O. Pure O and H when burning give  great heat, but little light. The oxy-hydrogen blow-pipe (Fig.  17) is a device for producing the highest temperatures of  combustion. It has O in the inner tube and H in the outer. Why  would it not be better the other way? These unite at the end, and  are burned, giving great heat. A piece of lime put into the flame  gives the brilliant Drummond or calcium light.    Chapter IX. UNION BY WEIGHT.    39. In the Equation --    Zn + 2 HCl = ZnCl2 + 2 H  65 + 73    = 136   + 2    65 parts by weight of Zn are required to liberate 2 parts by weight of  H; or, by using 65 g Zn with 73 g HCl, we obtain 2 g H. If twice as  much Zn (130 g) were used, 4 g H could be obtained, with, of course,  twice as much HCl. With 260 g. Zn, how much H could be liberated?  A proportion may be made as follows:--    Zn given : Zn required :: H given : H required.  65       : 260         :: 2       : x.    [footnote: Given, as here used, means the weight called for by the  equation; required means that called for by the question.]    Solving, we have 8 g H.    How much H is obtainable by using 5 g Zn, as in the experiment?    To avoid error in solving similar problems, the best plan is as  follows:--    Zn + 2HCl = ZnCl2 + 2 H  |      65:5::2:x  65               2  |      65 x = 10  5               x  |      x = 10/65 = 2/13 Ans. 2/13 g.    The equation should first be written; next, the atomic or molecular  weights which you wish to use, and only those, to avoid confusion;  then, on the third line, the quantity of the substance to be used, with  underneath the substance wanted. The example above will best  how this. This plan will prevent the possibility of error. The proportion  will then be:--    a given : a required :: b given : b required.    How much Zn is required to produce 30 g. H?    Zn + 2HCl = ZnCl2 + 2H    |    2:30::65:x  65                   2    |     2x = 1950   x                  30    |      x = 975    Ans. 975 g. Zn.    Solve:--    (1) How much Zn is necessary for 14 g. H?    (2) How many pounds of Zn are necessary for 3 pounds of H?    (3) How many grams of H from 17 g. of Zn?    (4) How many tons of H from 1/2 ton of Zn?    Suppose we wish to find how much chlorhydric acid--pure gas--  will give 12 g. H. The question involves only HCl and H. Arrange  as follows:--    Zn + 2HCl = ZnCl2 + 2 H   |  H giv. : H req. :: HCl giv. : HCl req.         73             2   |    2    :   12   ::  73          x          x            12   |       2x=876                x=438                                                      Ans. 438 g. HCl.    Solve:--    (1) How much HCl is needed to produce 100 g. H?    (2) How much H in 10 g. HCl?    (3) How much ZnCl2 is formed by using 50 g. HCl? The question  is now between HCl and ZnCl2.    Zn + 2HC1 = ZnCl2 + 2H         73     136       |  Arrange the proportion, and solve.         50       x    Suppose we have generated H by using H2S04: the equation is  Zn + H2S04 = ZnSO4 + 2 H. There is the same relation as before  between the quantities of Zn and of H, but the H2S04 and ZnS04 are  different.    How much H2SO4 is needed to generate 12 g. H?    Zn + H2SO4 = ZnS04 + 2 H          98             2     |   Make the proportion, and solve           x            12    Solve:--    (1) How much H in 200 g. H2S04?    (2) How much ZnS04 is produced from 200 g. H2S04?  (3) How much H2S04 is needed for 7 1/2 g H?  (4) How much Zn will 40 g. H2SO4 combine with?  (5) How much Fe will 40 g. H2SO4 combine with?  (6) How much H can be obtained by using 75 g Fe?    These principles apply to all reactions. Suppose, for example, we  wish to get l0 g. of O: how much KClO3 will it be necessary to use?  The reaction is:--    KClO3 = KCl + O3   |     48 : 10 :: 122.5 : x  122.5        48   |  x       10   |     Ans. 25.5+ g. KClO3.    The pupil should be required to make up problems of his own,  using various reactions, and to solve them.    CHAPTER X.    CARBON.    Examine graphite, "]]]
