[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47703"],[0,"Wilford Woodruff, Fourth President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day (#6)"],[1," the foregoing  peculiar circumstances which I have experienced in life. A summary of  what is here given may be briefly stated thus: I have broken both legs,  one of them in two places; both arms, both ankles, my breastbone, and  three ribs; I have been scalded, frozen, and drowned; I have been in  two water wheels while turning under a full head; I have passed through  a score of other hairbreadth escapes. The repeated deliverances from  all these remarkable dangers I ascribe to the mercies of my Heavenly  Father. In recalling them to mind I always feel impressed to render the  gratitude of my heart, with {12} thanksgiving and joy, to the Lord.  I pray that the remainder of my days may pass in His service, in the  building up of His kingdom.\"    When one stops to reflect upon the character of the accidents and the  manner of escape, he is impressed by the thought that they came along  as part of the remarkable incidents of his life. They are marvels  to be sure, but the whole life of Wilford Woodruff is a marvel. He  was on the spot when the danger arrived. He never seems to have been  disconcerted by it. He was so serene in his faith that he always had  an assurance that all would end well, and he, consequently, is never  found in a complainly mood, even when undergoing the severest pain. His  patience, therefore, was a powerful factor in bringing to his life a  large measure of confidence in the ultimate goodness of an overruling  Providence.    {13}        CHAPTER 3.    A REMARKABLE PREPARATION.    \"Coming Events.\"--Wilford Woodruff's Interest in Religion.--Existing  Religious Denominations.--Teachings of Scripture.--Father Mason, a  Prophet.--Peculiar Process of Preparation.    Wilford Woodruff belonged to a group of men whose advent into the world  characterized the first two decades of the nineteenth century. Though  in their own day, humble and obscure and held in contempt by mankind  generally, their importance and the work accomplished by them grow in  significance to the Latter-day Saints who are and have been for the  past half century the greatest history makers in the world. Such men  as Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, Lorenzo  Snow, and Joseph F. Smith, whose administration of the affairs of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has given them a prominent  place in the world as well as in the Church, grow in historical  magnitude as time goes on. Their respective administrations constitute  distinguished landmarks in the history of a great people.    There has been a mysterious something about North America, and indeed  of the whole American continent, that has made it not only inviting to  discoverers and adventurers, but an asylum to those who sought enlarged  religious freedom and the development of institutions in harmony  with the ideals of progressive religious thought. What has been more  remarkable to the welfare of this nation than the character of the men,  who, standing upon foreign shores looked forward to it as a land of  grand opportunities, were the men, the early patriots who gave to its  government the highest wisdom of the age, and to social institution  a broad foundation upon which all classes could securely rest their  hopes, their ambitions, and their religious convictions.    The institutions of our country have nevertheless grown as time went  on, and little by little conditions derogatory to the well-being and  happiness of the people have given way to higher and better standards  of life. The opposition to slavery and its downfall enlarged the  conceptions of individual liberty and of {14} human rights. The  traditions of ages have given way before the progress of modern  enlightenment, and the country has afforded better opportunities for  progressive and changing institutions than any other nation of the  civilized world. The whole drift of American history has been in the  direction of religious enlightenment and political freedom. True, such  enlightenment and freedom have met with stubborn resistance and have  cost the best blood of the nation. The United States has been a country  peculiarly marked for the greatest human endeavor. It has not, however,  reached the acme of its possibilities nor has its work, however  progressive, reached a finished state. If the lessons of the past in  American history are important in any one respect, more than another,  it is in the great truth that it is to be the standard bearer, and the  first in religion and government.    In religion the nation is brought face to face daily more and more with  the great religious problem known to the civilized world as Mormonism.  The men who were instrumentalities of that new religion grow in  importance as it makes its way in religious and theological history.  The lives therefore of such men as Wilford Woodruff not only have a  distinct place in the lives and thoughts of their religious associates,  but will also have an important position in the future history and  development of religious thought.    How such men as Wilford Woodruff came upon the stage at the particular  time in the history of the Church, and what external influences brought  them into its folds are matter of peculiar interest to every student  of Church history. What he himself thought of the new movement and how  he was prepared to receive it is given here and there throughout his  private journals in a manner to make the story of his life one of the  most interesting in all the annals of the Church.    He says: \"At an early age my mind began to be exercised upon religious  subjects, but I never made a profession of religion until 1830 when  I was twenty-three years of age. I did not then join any church for  the reason that I could not find a body of people, denomination,  or church that had for its doctrine, faith, and practices those  principles, ordinances, and gifts which constituted the gospel of  Jesus Christ as taught by Him and His apostles. Neither did I find  anywhere the manifestations of the {15} Holy Ghost with its attendant  gifts and graces. When I conversed with the ministers of the various  denominations or sects, they would always tell me that prophets,  apostles, revelations, healing, etc., were given to establish Jesus  Christ and His doctrine, but that they have ever since been done away  with because no longer needed in the Church and Kingdom of God. Such  a declaration I never could and never would believe. I did believe,  however, that revelation, the gifts and graces, and the faith once  delivered to the Saints--a faith which they have enjoyed in all ages  when God has had an acknowledged people on the earth--could be done  away with only through the disobedience and unbelief of the children  of men. I believed every gift, office, and blessing to be just as  necessary now to constitute the true Church of Christ and Kingdom of  God as in any age of the world.    \"This belief was firmly fixed upon my mind for two reasons: first,  from the study of the Bible I found that the principle of cause and  effect was the same in all ages, and that the divine promises made  were to all generations. At the same time, I found no changes in the  gospel in the days of Christ and the apostles, or that there would be  any change in the plan of salvation in the last days. I learned also  from the Scriptures that many of the ancient prophets, that Christ and  His apostles foresaw by inspiration and revelation that the Gentile  nations would apostatize and turn away from the true faith and from the  Church and Kingdom of God as the Jews had anciently done; that there  would be a falling away from the apostolic faith, from its doctrines  and ordinances; that other systems would arise; that when these false  systems should reach their fullness, the God of heaven would set up His  Kingdom; that an angel would restore the gospel; and that it should be  preached in all the world for a witness before the Savior should come  to reign. I further believed that the gospel had been taken from the  Jews and given to the Gentiles; that the Gentiles had, as foretold by  the prophets, fallen into apostasy; and that in the last days Israel  should be restored and the promises concerning that people should be  fulfilled. All these things I learned from the Scriptures and they made  a lasting impression upon my mind.    \"The second reason for my peculiar belief in such principles, {16}  teachings, and doctrines was that in the days of my youth I was  taught by an aged man named Robert Mason, who lived in Sainsbury,  Connecticut. By many he was called a prophet; to my knowledge, many of  his prophecies have been fulfilled. The sick were healed by him through  the laying on of hands in the name of Jesus Christ, and devils were  cast out. His son was a raving maniac. After praying and fasting for  him nine days, he arose on the ninth day and commanded in the name of  Jesus Christ the devil to come out of him. The devil obeyed and the boy  was made whole from that very hour. This man instilled these principles  into my mind as well as into the mind of my oldest brother Azmon.    \"Father Mason did not claim that he had any authority to officiate in  the ordinances of the gospel, nor did he believe that such authority  existed on the earth. He did believe, however, that it was the  privilege of any man who had faith in God to fast and pray for the  healing of the sick by the laying on of hands. He believed it his right  and the right of every honest-hearted man or woman to receive light and  knowledge, visions, and revelations by the prayer of faith. He told  me that the day was near when the Lord would establish His Church and  Kingdom upon the earth with all its ancient gifts and blessings. He  said that such a work would commence upon the earth before he died,  but that he would not live to partake of its blessings. He said that I  should live to do so, and that I should become a conspicuous"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47707"],[0,"History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Volume 3 (#6)"],[1,"to free people of color to settle in  Jackson county! Whereupon an extra was published to the July number of  the _Star_ on the sixteenth of the month, which said: \"The intention in  publishing the article, \"Free People of Color,\" was not only to stop  free people of color from immigrating to Missouri, but to prevent them  from being admitted as members of the Church. * * * * * To be short, we  are opposed to having free people of color admitted into the State.\" [7]    But in the face of all this the Missourians still claimed that the  article was merely published to give directions and cautions to be  observed by \"colored brethren,\" to enable them upon their arrival  in Missouri, to \"claim and exercise the rights of citizenship.\"  \"Contemporaneous with the appearance of this article\"--the above  article in the {XXVI} _Star_--continued the charge published in the  _Western Monitor_--\"was the expectation among the brethren, that a  considerable number of this degraded caste were only waiting this  information before they should set out on their journey.\" [8] And  this base falsehood was used to inflame the minds of the old settlers  against the Saints.    I do not refer to this question of slavery in connection with the  persecution of the Saints in Missouri in order to set it down as one  of the causes of that persecution; because, as a matter of fact, the  views of the Saints, and especially of the leading Elders of the Church  on that question were such that they could never be truthfully charged  with being a menace to that institution. The Prophet Joseph himself,  at the time of the Jackson county troubles and subsequently, held very  conservative views on the subject of slavery, surprisingly conservative  views when his own temperament and environment are taken into account,  of which fact any one may convince himself by reading his paper on the  subject of abolition in Volume II of the Church History, pages 436-40.    Finally, it was given by the inspiration of God to the Prophet first to  utter the most statesman-like word upon this vexed question of slavery,  and had the nation and people of the United States but given heed to  his recommendations it would have settled the question in harmony with  the convictions of the people of the North, and without injustice to  the South. Here follows his statesman-like word, published throughout  the United States in 1844--eleven years before Ralph Waldo Emerson made  substantially the same recommendation, and for which the philosopher  received no end of praise:--    \"Petition, also, ye goodly inhabitants of the slave states, your  legislators to abolish slavery by the year 1850, or now, and save  the abolitionist from reproach and ruin, and infamy and shame. Pray  Congress to pay every man a reasonable price for his slaves out of the  surplus revenue arising from the sale of the public lands, and from the  deduction of pay from the members of Congress. Break off the shackles  from the poor black man, and hire him to labor like other human beings;  for an hour of virtuous liberty is worth a whole eternity of bondage.\"  [9]    But now to return to the course of the Missourians in misrepresenting  the views of the Saints on the subject of slavery. Notwithstanding  the explicit denials through the \"_Evening and Morning Star_,\" that  the article on \"Free People of Color\" was intended to invite such a  class into the state; and the further declaration that the Saints were  opposed to such persons coming into the state; as also the fact that  it is {XXVII} doubtful if there were any free negroes who were members  of the Church--notwithstanding all this, their enemies continued to  misrepresent them, and their views on the subject of slavery. They saw  in the fact that many of them were from New England, where abolition  sentiment was rife, their opportunity to charge them with abolition  sentiments and intention to interfere with slavery, with every prospect  of having it quite generally believed--hence the charge was made and  became a pretext if not a cause of acts of aggression upon the Saints,  and as such is a factor that must be taken account of in these pages.    _Political Fears_.    I know of no circumstances which developed what the political faith of  the Saints really was during their sojourn in the state of Missouri;  and doubt if any data exists from which it could be determined whether  a majority of them were Whigs or Republican-Democrats, as the party now  designated as the Democratic party was then called. In fact, politics,  local or national, concerned the Saints but very little during their  stay in Missouri. Their minds were occupied by quite other, and I may  say, larger and higher things; and their activities were concerned  with other issues than those political. They were concerned about the  redemption of Zion, her establishment, the proclamation of the Gospel,  the salvation of men, the preparation of the earth for the incoming  of that Kingdom whose King is the Lord. Their mission encompassed the  whole world, it was not confined to the state of Missouri and her petty  political affairs; nor even to the political affairs of the United  States, important as they were. \"Mormonism\" was a world-movement, not  merely a national one. It concerned itself with the deeper and broader  subject of religion, rather than with the principles and methods of  the administration of government, state or national. Still, in common  with other people of the county, state and nation of which they were  citizens, they possessed civil and political rights and privileges,  accompanied as such rights and privileges always are in a republic  with certain duties both to the state and themselves, among which the  exercise of the elective franchise. As this made them a power in the  community, their actual and prospective influence in the affairs of the  counties where they resided, and in the state, was a matter of frequent  discussion among the old settlers in Missouri. I do not know that it  was ever charged that they were Whigs, and that by acting with that  party in Missouri they could wrest the control of the state from the  Republican-Democratic party then in power; though that they were Whigs  might have been inferred from the fact of their being chiefly from New  England and other northern states; yet this was not charged. {XXVIII}  There was repeatedly expressed, however, a fear of their political  power. In the document issued by the mob meeting at Independence on the  20th of July, 1833, it is said: \"When we reflect on the extensive field  in which the sect is operating, and that there exists in every country  a leaven of superstition that embraces with avidity, notions the most  extravagant and unheard of, and that whatever can be gleaned by them  from the purlieus of vice and the abodes of ignorance, is to be cast  like a waif into our social circle, it requires no gift of prophecy to  tell that the day is not far distant when the civil government of the  county will be in their hands; when the sheriff, the justices, and the  county judges will be Mormons, or persons wishing to court their favor  from motives of interest or ambition.\"    It was an effort to prevent members of the Church from voting at an  election at Gallatin, Daviess county, in August, 1838, which led  to the commencement of those acts of hostility against the Saints  which ended ultimately in their expulsion from that state. There was  no political offense even charged against the Saints; only that if  permitted to exercise the franchise they would in time obtain control  of the counties where they resided, so rapidly were they increasing  in numbers; and the old settlers would lose the offices; and as these  old settlers were dear lovers of office, it was political jealousy  born of fear which prompted in part the acts of aggression against the  Saints. When such jealousy is awakened, pretexts for the justification  of its existence are not difficult to find, and in this instance the  old settlers in Missouri relied upon the false charges of ignorance,  superstition, and general unworthiness of the Saints to be considered  good citizens of the state. The charge was not that they were all of  one political faith; or that they voted solidly; or that they were  under the political dictation of their religious leaders; or that  religious influence was dragged into political affairs. None of these  charges were made: it was simply a fear that the old settlers would  lose the offices, and the new settlers, the Saints, being in the  majority, would hold them. How much justification there was for this  \"fear\" may not be determined, since it was based upon no accomplished  fact, but regarded as the natural outcome of the operation of the  political system obtaining in the United States; namely, the right of  the majority to choose the public officers; and if the Saints happened  to be in the majority it was regarded as likely that they would elect  their friends to office, among whom, at least, would have been some  members of their own faith. How the matter would have terminated in the  event of the Saints having been permitted to remain in Missouri--what  would have been the political alignment of {XXIX} the members of the  Church I mean, no one can say. The only political utterance made by any  Church leader was that given out by the Prophet Joseph soon after his  arrival in Missouri, and called at the time \"_The Political Motto of  the Church_.\" I quote it:    \"_The Constitution of our country formed by the Fathers of Liberty;  peace and good order in society; love to God, and good will to man.  All good and wholesome laws; virtue and truth above all things, and  Aristarchy_ [a government by good men] _live for ever: but woe to  tyrants, mobs, aristocracy, anarchy and toryism, and all those who  invent or seek out unrighteous or evasive law suits, under the pretext  and color of law"]]]
