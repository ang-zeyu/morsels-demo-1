Half the time these crazy Greasers are on one side,  then on the other. If you didn't starve or get shot in ambush, or die  of thirst, some Greaser would knife you in the back for you belt buckle  or boots.  There are a good many Americans with the rebels eastward  toward Agua, Prieta and Juarez.  Orozco is operating in Chihuahua, and  I guess he has some idea of warfare.  But this is Sonora, a mountainous  desert, the home of the slave and the Yaqui.  There's unorganized  revolt everywhere.  The American miners and ranchers, those who could  get away, have fled across into the States, leaving property.  Those  who couldn't or wouldn't come must fight for their lives, are fighting  now.\"    \"That's bad,\" said Gale.  \"It's news to me.  Why doesn't the government  take action, do something?\"    \"Afraid of international complications.  Don't want to offend the  Maderists, or be criticized by jealous foreign nations.  It's a  delicate situation, Dick.  The Washington officials know the gravity of  it, you can bet.  But the United States in general is in the dark, and  the army--well, you ought to hear the inside talk back at San Antonio.  We're patrolling the boundary line.  We're making a grand bluff.  I  could tell you of a dozen instances where cavalry should have pursued  raiders on the other side of the line.  But we won't do it.  The  officers are a grouchy lot these days.  You see, of course, what  significance would attach to United States cavalry going into Mexican  territory.  There would simply be hell.  My own colonel is the sorest  man on the job.  We're all sore.  It's like sitting on a powder  magazine.  We can't keep the rebels and raiders from crossing the line.  Yet we don't fight.  My commission expires soon.  I'll be discharged in  three months.  You can bet I'm glad for more reasons than I've  mentioned.\"    Thorne was evidently laboring under strong, suppressed excitement. His  face showed pale under the tan, and his eyes gleamed with a dark fire.  Occasionally his delight at meeting, talking with Gale, dominated the  other emotions, but not for long.  He had seated himself at a table  near one of the doorlike windows leading into the street, and every  little while he would glance sharply out.  Also he kept consulting his  watch.    These details gradually grew upon Gale as Thorne talked.    \"George, it strikes me that you're upset,\" said Dick, presently.  \"I  seem to remember you as a cool-headed fellow whom nothing could  disturb. Has the army changed you?\"    Thorne laughed.  It was a laugh with a strange, high note.  It was  reckless--it hinted of exaltation.  He rose abruptly; he gave the  waiter money to go for drinks; he looked into the saloon, and then into  the street.  On this side of the house there was a porch opening on a  plaza with trees and shrubbery and branches.  Thorne peered out one  window, then another.  His actions were rapid.  Returning to the table,  he put his hands upon it and leaned over to look closely into Gale's  face.    \"I'm away from camp without leave,\" he said.    \"Isn't that a serious offense?\" asked Dick.    \"Serious?  For me, if I'm discovered, it means ruin.  There are rebels  in town.  Any moment we might have trouble.  I ought to be ready for  duty--within call.  If I'm discovered it means arrest. That means  delay--the failure of my plans--ruin.\"    Gale was silenced by his friend's intensity.  Thorne bent over closer  with his dark eyes searching bright.    \"We were old pals--once?\"    \"Surely,\" replied Dick.    \"What would you say, Dick Gale, if I told you that you're the one man  I'd rather have had come along than any other at this crisis of my  life?\"    The earnest gaze, the passionate voice with its deep tremor drew Dick  upright, thrilling and eager, conscious of strange, unfamiliar  impetuosity.    \"Thorne, I should say I was glad to be the fellow,\" replied Dick.    Their hands locked for a moment, and they sat down again with heads  close over the table.    \"Listen,\" began Thorne, in low, swift whisper, \"a few days, a week  ago--it seems like a year!--I was of some assistance to refugees  fleeing from Mexico into the States.  They were all women, and one of  them was dressed as a nun.  Quite by accident I saw her face. It was  that of a beautiful girl.  I observed she kept aloof from the others.  I suspected a disguise, and, when opportunity afforded, spoke to her,  offered my services.  She replied to my poor efforts at Spanish in  fluent English.  She had fled in terror from her home, some place down  in Sinaloa.  Rebels are active there.  Her father was captured and held  for ransom.  When the ransom was paid the rebels killed him. The leader  of these rebels was a bandit named Rojas.  Long before the revolution  began he had been feared by people of class--loved by the peons.  Bandits are worshiped by the peons. All of the famous bandits have  robbed the rich and given to the poor. Rojas saw the daughter, made off  with her.  But she contrived to bribe her guards, and escaped almost  immediately before any harm befell her.  She hid among friends.  Rojas  nearly tore down the town in his efforts to find her.  Then she  disguised herself, and traveled by horseback, stage, and train to  Casita.    \"Her story fascinated me, and that one fleeting glimpse I had of her  face I couldn't forget.  She had no friends here, no money. She knew  Rojas was trailing her.  This talk I had with her was at the railroad  station, where all was bustle and confusion.  No one noticed us, so I  thought.  I advised her to remove the disguise of a nun before she left  the waiting-room.  And I got a boy to guide her.  But he fetched her to  his house.  I had promised to come in the evening to talk over the  situation with her.    \"I found her, Dick, and when I saw her--I went stark, staring, raving  mad over her.  She is the most beautiful, wonderful girl I ever saw.  Her name is Mercedes Castaneda, and she belongs to one of the old  wealthy Spanish families.  She has lived abroad and in Havana.  She  speaks French as well as English.  She is--but I must be brief.    \"Dick, think, think!  With Mercedes also it was love at first sight. My  plan is to marry her and get her farther to the interior, away from the  border.  It may not be easy.  She's watched.  So am I. It was  impossible to see her without the women of this house knowing. At  first, perhaps, they had only curiosity--an itch to gossip.  But the  last two days there has been a change.  Since last night there's some  powerful influence at work.  Oh, these Mexicans are subtle, mysterious!  After all, they are Spaniards.  They work in secret, in the dark.  They  are dominated first by religion, then by gold, then by passion for a  woman.  Rojas must have got word to his friends here; yesterday his  gang of cutthroat rebels arrived, and to-day he came.  When I learned  that, I took my chance and left camp.  I hunted up a priest.  He  promised to come here.  It's time he's due.  But I'm afraid he'll be  stopped.\"    \"Thorne, why don't you take the girl and get married without waiting,  without running these risks?\" said Dick.    \"I fear it's too late now.  I should have done that last night. You  see, we're over the line--\"    \"Are we in Mexican territory now?\" queried Gale, sharply.    \"I guess yes, old boy.  That's what complicates it.  Rojas and his  rebels have Casita in their hands.  But Rojas without his rebels would  be able to stop me, get the girl, and make for his mountain haunts.  If  Mercedes is really watched--if her identity is known, which I am sure  is the case--we couldn't get far from this house before I'd be knifed  and she seized.\"    \"Good Heavens!  Thorne, can that sort of thing happen less than a  stone's throw from the United States line?\" asked Gale, incredulously.    \"It can happen, and don't you forget it.  You don't seem to realize the  power these guerrilla leaders, these rebel captains, and particularly  these bandits, exercise over the mass of Mexicans. A bandit is a man of  honor in Mexico.  He is feared, envied, loved. In the hearts of the  people he stands next to the national idol--the bull-fighter, the  matador.  The race has a wild, barbarian, bloody strain.  Take  Quinteros, for instance.  He was a peon, a slave. He became a famous  bandit.  At the outbreak of the revolution he proclaimed himself a  leader, and with a band of followers he devastated whole counties.  The  opposition to federal forces was only a blind to rob and riot and carry  off women.  The motto of this man and his followers was:  'Let us enjoy  ourselves while we may!'    \"There are other bandits besides Quinteros, not so famous or such great  leaders, but just as bloodthirsty.  I've seen Rojas.  He's a handsome,  bold sneering devil, vainer than any peacock.  He decks himself in gold  lace and sliver trappings, in all the finery he can steal.  He was one  of the rebels who helped sack Sinaloa and carry off half a million in  money and valuables.  Rojas spends gold like he spills blood.  But he  is chiefly famous for abducting women. The peon girls consider it an  honor to be ridden off with.  Rojas has shown a penchant for girls of  the better class.\"    Thorne wiped the perspiration from his pale face and bent a dark gaze  out of the window before he resumed his talk.    \"Consider what the position of Mercedes really is.  I can't get any  help from our side of the line.  If so, I don't know where. The  population on that side is mostly Mexican, absolutely in sympathy with  whatever actuates those on this side.  The whole caboodle of Greasers  on both sides belong to the class in sympathy with the rebels, the  class that secretly respects men like Rojas, and hates an aristocrat  like Mercedes.  They would conspire to throw her into his power.  Rojas  can turn all the hidden underground influences to his ends.  Unless I  thwart him "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/503"],[0,"The Blue Fairy Book (#6)"],[1," \"It is I, and this is she who should  have had the Prince who lives in the castle which lies east of the sun  and west of the moon. And now she wishes to ask you if you have ever  been there, and can tell her the way, for she would gladly find him  again.\"    \"Yes,\" said the North Wind, \"I know where it is. I once blew an aspen  leaf there, but I was so tired that for many days afterward I was not  able to blow at all. However, if you really are anxious to go there, and  are not afraid to go with me, I will take you on my back, and try if I  can blow you there.\"    \"Get there I must,\" said she; \"and if there is any way of going I will;  and I have no fear, no matter how fast you go.\"    \"Very well then,\" said the North Wind; \"but you must sleep here  to-night, for if we are ever to get there we must have the day before  us.\"    The North Wind woke her betimes next morning, and puffed himself up, and  made himself so big and so strong that it was frightful to see him, and  away they went, high up through the air, as if they would not stop until  they had reached the very end of the world. Down below there was such a  storm! It blew down woods and houses, and when they were above the sea  the ships were wrecked by hundreds. And thus they tore on and on, and  a long time went by, and then yet more time passed, and still they were  above the sea, and the North Wind grew tired, and more tired, and at  last so utterly weary that he was scarcely able to blow any longer, and  he sank and sank, lower and lower, until at last he went so low that the  waves dashed against the heels of the poor girl he was carrying. \"Art  thou afraid?\" said the North Wind. \"I have no fear,\" said she; and it  was true. But they were not very, very far from land, and there was just  enough strength left in the North Wind to enable him to throw her on to  the shore, immediately under the windows of a castle which lay east of  the sun and west of the moon; but then he was so weary and worn out that  he was forced to rest for several days before he could go to his own  home again.    Next morning she sat down beneath the walls of the castle to play with  the golden apple, and the first person she saw was the maiden with the  long nose, who was to have the Prince. \"How much do you want for that  gold apple of yours, girl?\" said she, opening the window. \"It can't be  bought either for gold or money,\" answered the girl. \"If it cannot be  bought either for gold or money, what will buy it? You may say what you  please,\" said the Princess.    \"Well, if I may go to the Prince who is here, and be with him to-night,  you shall have it,\" said the girl who had come with the North Wind. \"You  may do that,\" said the Princess, for she had made up her mind what she  would do. So the Princess got the golden apple, but when the girl went  up to the Prince's apartment that night he was asleep, for the Princess  had so contrived it. The poor girl called to him, and shook him, and  between whiles she wept; but she could not wake him. In the morning, as  soon as day dawned, in came the Princess with the long nose, and drove  her out again. In the daytime she sat down once more beneath the windows  of the castle, and began to card with her golden carding-comb; and then  all happened as it had happened before. The Princess asked her what she  wanted for it, and she replied that it was not for sale, either for gold  or money, but that if she could get leave to go to the Prince, and be  with him during the night, she should have it. But when she went up to  the Prince's room he was again asleep, and, let her call him, or shake  him, or weep as she would, he still slept on, and she could not put any  life in him. When daylight came in the morning, the Princess with the  long nose came too, and once more drove her away. When day had quite  come, the girl seated herself under the castle windows, to spin with  her golden spinning-wheel, and the Princess with the long nose wanted to  have that also. So she opened the window, and asked what she would  take for it. The girl said what she had said on each of the former  occasions--that it was not for sale either for gold or for money, but if  she could get leave to go to the Prince who lived there, and be with him  during the night, she should have it.    \"Yes,\" said the Princess, \"I will gladly consent to that.\"    But in that place there were some Christian folk who had been carried  off, and they had been sitting in the chamber which was next to that of  the Prince, and had heard how a woman had been in there who had wept and  called on him two nights running, and they told the Prince of this. So  that evening, when the Princess came once more with her sleeping-drink,  he pretended to drink, but threw it away behind him, for he suspected  that it was a sleeping-drink. So, when the girl went into the Prince's  room this time he was awake, and she had to tell him how she had come  there. \"You have come just in time,\" said the Prince, \"for I should have  been married to-morrow; but I will not have the long-nosed Princess, and  you alone can save me. I will say that I want to see what my bride can  do, and bid her wash the shirt which has the three drops of tallow on  it. This she will consent to do, for she does not know that it is you  who let them fall on it; but no one can wash them out but one born of  Christian folk: it cannot be done by one of a pack of trolls; and then  I will say that no one shall ever be my bride but the woman who can do  this, and I know that you can.\" There was great joy and gladness between  them all that night, but the next day, when the wedding was to take  place, the Prince said, \"I must see what my bride can do.\" \"That you may  do,\" said the stepmother.    \"I have a fine shirt which I want to wear as my wedding shirt, but three  drops of tallow have got upon it which I want to have washed off, and  I have vowed to marry no one but the woman who is able to do it. If she  cannot do that, she is not worth having.\"    Well, that was a very small matter, they thought, and agreed to do it.  The Princess with the long nose began to wash as well as she could,  but, the more she washed and rubbed, the larger the spots grew. \"Ah! you  can't wash at all,\" said the old troll-hag, who was her mother. \"Give it  to me.\" But she too had not had the shirt very long in her hands before  it looked worse still, and, the more she washed it and rubbed it, the  larger and blacker grew the spots.    So the other trolls had to come and wash, but, the more they did, the  blacker and uglier grew the shirt, until at length it was as black as if  it had been up the chimney. \"Oh,\" cried the Prince, \"not one of you is  good for anything at all! There is a beggar-girl sitting outside the  window, and I'll be bound that she can wash better than any of you! Come  in, you girl there!\" he cried. So she came in. \"Can you wash this shirt  clean?\" he cried. \"Oh! I don't know,\" she said; \"but I will try.\" And  no sooner had she taken the shirt and dipped it in the water than it  was white as driven snow, and even whiter than that. \"I will marry you,\"  said the Prince.    Then the old troll-hag flew into such a rage that she burst, and the  Princess with the long nose and all the little trolls must have burst  too, for they have never been heard of since. The Prince and his bride  set free all the Christian folk who were imprisoned there, and took away  with them all the gold and silver that they could carry, and moved far  away from the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon.(1)      (1) Asbjornsen and Moe.          THE YELLOW DWARF      Once upon a time there lived a queen who had been the mother of a great  many children, and of them all only one daughter was left. But then  _she_ was worth at least a thousand.    Her mother, who, since the death of the King, her father, had nothing in  the world she cared for so much as this little Princess, was so terribly  afraid of losing her that she quite spoiled her, and never tried to  correct any of her faults. The consequence was that this little person,  who was as pretty as possible, and was one day to wear a crown, grew  up so proud and so much in love with her own beauty that she despised  everyone else in the world.    The Queen, her mother, by her caresses and flatteries, helped to make  her believe that there was nothing too good for her. She was dressed  almost always in the prettiest frocks, as a fairy, or as a queen going  out to hunt, and the ladies of the Court followed her dressed as forest  fairies.    And to make her more vain than ever the Queen caused her portrait to be  taken by the cleverest painters and sent it to several neighboring kings  with whom she was very friendly.    When they saw this portrait they fell in love with the Princess--every  one of them, but upon each it had a different effect. One fell ill, one  went quite crazy, and a few of the luckiest set off to see her as soon  as possible, but these poor princes became her slaves the moment they  set eyes on her.    Never has there been a gayer Court. Twenty delightful kings did  everything they could think of to make themselves agreeable, and after  having spent ever so much money in giving a single entertainment thought  themselves very lucky if the Princess said \"That's pretty.\"    All this admiration vastly pleased the Queen. Not a day passed but  she received seven or eight thousand sonnets, and as many elegies,  madrigals, and songs, which were sent her by all the poets in the  world. All the prose and the poetry that was written just then was about  Bellissima--for that was the Princess's name--and all the bonfires that  they had were made of these verses, which crackled and sparkled better  than any other sort of wood.    Bellissima was already fifteen years old, and every one of the Princes  wished to marry her, but not one dared to say so. How could they when  they knew that any "]]]
