Although the two kinds have at times been considered  conspecific, they differ in voice, hooting mechanism, and characters  of the downy young, and so far no actual intergradation between the  two has been shown (Grinnell and Miller, 1944:113). These grouse thus  seem to offer additional evidence for a Pleistocene, possibly  Wisconsinan, separation of the boreal fauna into a Rocky Mountain and  a Pacific coastal segment.    A notable sidelight on these data is the frequency with which species  in the Sierra Nevada have their closest relatives in the Rocky  Mountains, rather than in the geographically nearer Cascades or  coastal areas. This similarity in fauna of the Sierra Nevada and the  Rockies was noted long ago by Merriam (1899:86).          RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER SPECIES      During the Sangamonian interval, isolated segments of the once  widespread ancestral _Sorex vagrans_ quite possibly persisted in such  places as the Sierra Nevada, coastal southern California, the  mountains of Arizona, New Mexico, and southern Mexico, and in the  Black Hills (see fig. 6). One might expect that by Wisconsinan time  these populations would have become reproductively isolated from their  parent stock. They would therefore have remained specifically distinct  when Wisconsinan _Sorex vagrans_, reoccupied these outlying areas, and  may still be found isolated in places peripheral to the range of the  ancestral species.       [Illustration: FIG. 10. Probable distribution of        _S. veraepacis_, _S. longirostris_, and the _S. ornatus_ group        (stipple) and of their Wisconsinan ancestors (lines). Heavy        line indicates limits of Wisconsinan glaciation.]    In fact, we do find species closely related to _Sorex vagrans_ in just  such places today (fig. 10). Probably _Sorex ornatus_, including  members of the _ornatus_ group such as _S. trigonirostris_, _S.  sinuosus_, _S. willeti_, _S. tenellus_, and _S. nanus_, and also _S.  veraepacis_, arose by separation from the ancestral _vagrans_ stock in  Sangamonian time. Probably the eastern _S. longirostris_ arose in a  like manner. The ancestor of _S. ornatus_ may have been isolated in  southwestern California during Sangamonian time, spread north and  south during the Wisconsinan age, and afterward given rise to _S.  trigonirostris_ and the modern _S. ornatus_ complex of California and  Baja California. In at least one place reproductive isolation between  _ornatus_ and the invading _S. vagrans_ has broken down (Rudd, 1953);  the place is a salt marsh along San Pablo Bay, where a hybrid  population between _S. vagrans_ and _S. sinuosus_, an _ornatus_  derivative, has formed. _Sorex tenellus_ may have been isolated in the  Sierra Nevada in the Sangamonian interval, moved into the valleys  east of the mountains during the Wisconsinan age, and become  restricted to its present range since the retreat of the last ice.  _Sorex nanus_ may have occurred in the Black Hills and isolated  mountains of Arizona and New Mexico during the Sangamonian interval  and remained in these general areas during the Wisconsinan age. Its  present range is peripheral to the main body of the Rockies and the  Colorado Plateau.    The eastern species _Sorex longirostris_ has many similarities with  shrews of the _ornatus-vagrans_ stock. _S. l. longirostris_ is close  in many ways to _S. nanus_. Indeed, the differences between the  species _S. nanus_, _S. ornatus_, and _S. longirostris_ seem to me to  be of the same magnitude and indicate a similar period of  differentiation from a common ancestor. The ancestor of _S.  longirostris_ may have gained access to the eastern United States in  the Illinoian Age _via_ the northern Great Plains south of the glacial  boundary (fig. 7). The ancestor of _Sorex veraepacis_ of southern  Mexico probably reached that area in Illinoian time as part of the  ancestral _vagrans_ stock and probably attained its differentiation  during the Sangamonian interval.    All the kinds of shrews so far discussed, including the _S. vagrans_  complex, might thus be thought of as having had a common ancestor in  the Illinoian Age. This entire group of shrews has the third unicuspid  smaller than the fourth, a pigmented ridge from the apex to the  cingulum of each upper unicuspid, and, in most individuals, lacks a  post-mandibular foramen in the lower jaw (Findley, 1953:636-637). The  pigment is not always prominent in _S. longirostris_.    Two other species of North American shrews,_ Sorex palustris_, the  water shrew, and _Sorex bendiri_, the marsh shrew, show these three  characters to a greater or lesser degree, and it seems that these two  species and the _vagrans-ornatus-veraepacis_ group had a common  ancestor, probably before Illinoian time for reasons stated beyond. I  judge, however, that far from being subgenerically distinct as they  have been considered to be, _S. palustris_ and _S. bendiri_ are  actually closely related species of the same subgenus and may have  differentiated from one another because of separation into eastern  (_palustris_) and western (_bendiri_) segments in the Sangamonian  interval, much as has been postulated concerning the eastern and  western stocks of _Sorex vagrans_. Indeed, Jackson (1928:192) has  noted that in the Pacific northwest the characters of the two kinds  approach one another and become differences of degree only.    The widespread species _Sorex cinereus_ resembles all the foregoing  species in the ridges on the unicuspid teeth and in the lack of a  post-mandibular foramen, but differs from those other species in  having the third upper unicuspid larger than the fourth. The  subspecies _S. cinereus ohionensis_, however, often has the sizes of  these teeth reversed. With _S. cinereus_ I include _S. preblei_  (eastern Oregon) and _S. lyelli_ (Sierra Nevada), both obviously  closely related to _cinereus_ as Jackson (1928:37) recognized when he  included them in the _cinereus_ group. _Sorex milleri_ (Coahuila and  central western Nuevo Leon) seems to me to resemble _S. cinereus_ more  than it does other species of North American _Sorex_, and I judge that  it also belongs to the _cinereus_ group. _Sorex cinereus_ and its  close relatives seem more closely related to the species which have  thus far been discussed than they do to such other North American  species as _S. arcticus_, _S. fumeus_, _S. trowbridgii_, _S. merriami_,  and the members of the _S. saussurei_ group; most of these five  species last mentioned possess a post-mandibular foramen, lack  pigmented unicuspid ridges, and have the third unicuspid larger than  the fourth. Because of the morphological resemblances mentioned  above, it seems likely to me that _S. cinereus_ and the  _vagrans-ornatus-veraepacis-palustris_ complex had a common ancestor  in early Pleistocene time. _Sorex cinereus_ has recently been  considered to be conspecific with the Old World_ S. caecutiens_  Laxmann (Van den Brink, 1953) which name, being the older, would apply  to the circumpolar species.    Hibbard (1944:719) recovered _S. cinereus_ and a species of _Neosorex_  (a name formerly applied to the water shrew) from the Pleistocene  (late Kansan) Cudahy Fauna. This indicates that the ancestors of the  modern _S. cinereus_ and of the water shrew had diverged from one  another before that time. Brown (1908:172) recorded _S. cinereus_ and  _S. obscurus_ from the Conard Fissure in Arkansas. These materials  were deposited probably at a later time than was the Cudahy Fauna. The  _S. obscurus_ from Conard Fissure probably represents the ancestral  _S. vagrans_ stock which I think reached eastern United States in  Illinoian time and gave rise to _S. longirostris_. The Conard Fissure  material was deposited at a time (Illinoian?) when northern faunas  extended farther south than they do today.    All of the species mentioned as having structural characters in common  with _S. vagrans_ seem to have arisen from a common ancestor which had  already differentiated from the ancestor of such species as _S.  arcticus_, _S. saussurei_, and others. Consequently all are here  included in a single subgenus. The oldest generic name applied to a  shrew of this group, other than the name _Sorex_, is _Otisorex_ DeKay,  1842, type species _Otisorex platyrhinus_ DeKay, a synonym of _Sorex  cinereus_. The subgenus can be characterized as follows.      Subgenus =Otisorex= DeKay    1842. _Otisorex_ DeKay, Zoology of New York, pt. 1, Mammalia, p. 22,  and pl. 5, fig. 1. Type, _Otisorex platyrhinus_ DeKay (= _Sorex  cinereus_ Kerr).    Third unicuspid usually smaller than fourth; upper unicuspids usually  with pigmented ridge extending from apices medially to cingula,  uninterrupted by antero-posterior groove; post-mandibular foramen  usually absent. Includes the species _S. cinereus, S. longirostris, S.  vagrans, S. ornatus, S. tenellus, S. trigonirostris, S. nanus, S.  juncensis, S. willeti, S. sinuosus, S. veraepacis, S. palustris, S.  bendiri, S. alaskanus_, and _S. pribilofensis_.       [Illustration: FIGS. 11-14. Characters of the subgenera _Sorex_        and _Otisorex_.       FIG. 11. Medial view of right ramus of _Sorex (Otisorex)        vagrans_. x 14.       FIG. 12.

This individual was calling from a low bush in the clearing at Chinaja.  None was found in the pond in the forest at Toocog. Stuart (1935:38) and  Duellman (1960:63) noted that _Hyla staufferi_ breeds early in the rainy  season. Nevertheless, I think early breeding habits do not account for  the near absence of this species in our collections from southern El  Peten. In early July, 1960, a few individuals were heard at a pond on  the savanna at La Libertad. In mid-July of the same year they were  calling sporadically from temporary ponds in the lower Motagua Valley.  Possibly the individual collected at Chinaja was accidentally  transported there in cargo from Toocog, from which camp at the edge of  the savanna planes fly to Chinaja weekly. My observations on this  species throughout its range in Mexico and Central America indicate that  it inhabits savannas and semi-arid forests and usually is absent from  heavy rainforest. Stuart (1948:34) obtained this species at Cubilquitz  in the lowlands of Alta Verapaz.      =Phyllomedusa callidryas taylori= Funkhouser          Toocog, 25.    Between June 30 and July 2 this species was abundant at a pond in the  forest at Toocog. Calling males were as high as five meters in bushes  and trees around the pond. At dusk males were observed descending a  vine-covered tree at the edge of the pond; this strongly suggests that  the frogs retreat to this tree and others like it for diurnal seclusion.  Clasping pairs were found on branches and leaves above the water. The  eggs are deposited in clumps usually on vertical leaves, but sometimes  on horizontal leaves or on branches, vines, and aerial roots above the  water. Twenty-six clutches of eggs contained from 14 to 44 (average 29)  eggs. In a clutch in which the eggs are in yolk plug stage the average  diameter of the embryos is 2.3 mm. and that of the vitelline membranes,  3.4 mm. Most of the eggs are in the external part of the gelatinous  mass; the jelly is clear. The yolk is pale green, and the animal pole is  brown. As development ensues, the yolk becomes yellow and the embryo  first dark brown and then pale grayish tan. Upon hatching the tadpoles  wriggle free of the jelly and drop into the water. One clutch of 19 eggs  was observed to hatch in three minutes. Apparently, on dropping into the  water the hatchling tadpoles go to the bottom of the pond, for one or  two minutes pass from the time they enter the water until they reappear  near the surface. The average total length of seven hatchling tadpoles  is 7.4 mm. There is a moderate amount of yolk, but this does not form a  large ventral bulge. Large tadpoles congregate in the sunny parts of the  pond, where they were observed just beneath the surface. Many had their  mouths at the surface. Except for constant fluttering of the tip of the  tail, they lie quietly with the axis of the body at an angle of about 45  degrees with the surface of the water.    Description of tadpole (KU 60006): total length, 24.5 mm.; tail-length,  15.4 mm.; body broader than deep; head moderately flattened; snout  viewed from above blunt; nostrils close to snout and directed dorsally;  eyes of moderate size and directed laterally; mouth directed  anteroventrally; anus median; spiracle ventral, its opening just to left  of midline slightly more than one-half distance from tip of snout to  vent. Tail-fin slightly more than twice as deep as tail musculature,  which curves upward posteriorly; tail-fin narrowly extending to tip of  tail (Fig. 4). Color in life pale gray; in preservative white with  scattered melanophores; tail-fin transparent.    [Illustration: FIG. 4. Tadpole of _Phyllomedusa callidryas taylori_ (KU  60006) from Toocog, El Peten, Guatemala. x 4.]    Upper lip having single row of papillae laterally, but none medially;  lower lip having single row of papillae; no lateral indentation of lips;  two or more rows of papillae at lateral corners of lips; tooth-rows 2/3;  second upper tooth row as long as first, interrupted medially; inner  lower tooth-row as long as upper rows, interrupted medially; second and  third lower rows decreasingly shorter; upper beak moderate in size and  having long lateral projections; lower beak moderate in size; both beaks  finely serrate (Fig. 5).    [Illustration: FIG. 5.

NNW of Chinaja, 42; Rio de la Pasion, 1;        Rio San Roman, 5; Sayaxche; Toocog, 2.    Individuals of this species were found at night sitting on bushes and  small trees in the forest in February and March and again in June and  July. One was in the axil of a leaf of a _Xanthosoma_. In June and July  males were heard nearly every night. The series of specimens from 20  kilometers north-northwest of Chinaja was taken from a breeding  congregation in a shallow muddy pool in the forest. Tadpoles of this  species were in small, often muddy pools in the forest. To my knowledge  _Smilisca baudini_ is the only hylid to breed in these pools at Chinaja,  although perhaps _Smilisca phaeota_ also utilizes them. The only other  amphibian at Chinaja known to breed in the pools is _Bufo valliceps  valliceps_. Although two specimens were on bushes at night at Toocog,  _Smilisca baudini_ was not present at the pond where five other species  of hylids were breeding. Nevertheless, _Smilisca baudini_ was calling  from two ponds on the savannas near La Libertad. All of the specimens  from southern El Peten have yellow or yellowish white flanks and  ventrolateral surfaces.      =Smilisca phaeota cyanosticta= (Smith)          Chinaja, 4; 10 km. NNW of Chinaja, 1.    All specimens were found in February and March. Those from Chinaja were  obtained from _Xanthosoma_ and bromeliads; the individual from 10  kilometers north-northwest of Chinaja is an adult male that was calling  from a puddle in a fallen tree on March 13. A juvenile having a  snout-vent length of 34.7 mm. lacks the pale blue spots on the thighs;  instead, the anterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs are bright  red.      =Hypopachus cuneus nigroreticulatus= Taylor          Toocog, 1.    An adult male having a snout-vent length of 41.7 mm. was found at night  on the forest floor at the edge of a temporary pond. In life the dorsum  was dark brown with chocolate brown markings; the stripe on the side of  the head was white; the middorsal stripe was pale orange; the belly was  black and white, and the iris was a bronze color.    Characteristically this species inhabits savannas and open forest; thus,  its occurrence in the rainforest at Toocog is surprising. This is the  southernmost record for the species in El Peten; to the south in the  highlands it is replaced by the smaller _Hypopachus inguinalis_, having  rounded, instead of compressed, metatarsal tubercles.      =Rana palmipes= Spix          Chinaja, 11; 15 km. NW of Chinaja, 1; 20 km. NNW of Chinaja,        1.    With the exception of one recently metamorphosed juvenile having a  snout-vent length of 30.7 mm. that was found on the forest floor by day  on June 24, and one that was found beside a pool in a cave, all  individuals were found at temporary woodland pools or along sluggish  streams at night. The largest specimen is a female having a snout-vent  length of 107 mm.      =Rana pipiens= Schreber          Chinaja, 1; 20 km. NNW of Chinaja, 1; Rio San Roman, 1;        Toocog, 1.    All specimens were found near water at night. The largest individual is  a female having a snout-vent length of 112.5 mm.      =Crocodylus moreleti= Dumeril and Dumeril          Chinaja, 1; Rio San Roman, 1.    One specimen was obtained from a quiet pool in the Rio San Roman at  night; another was found in a small sluggish stream at Chinaja. Two  large individuals were seen in tributaries to the Rio San Roman. On the  savannas at Toocog two small individuals were obtained in the dry  season, at which time the crocodiles apparently were migrating to water.  The local name for this species is _lagarto_.      =Chelydra rossignoni= (Bocourt)          Chinaja, 1; 20 km. NNW of Chinaja, 1.    The paucity of specimens of _Chelydra_ from Central America has resulted  in rather inadequate diagnoses of various populations. The present  specimens have carapace lengths of 250 and 238 mm. and plastral lengths  of 185 and 176 mm. The length of carapace/bridge ratio is 6.0 and 6.1  per cent. Each individual has four barbels, the median pair of which are  extremely long. In KU 55977 the lateral pair of barbels is forked at the  base. The relative length of the plastral bridge in these specimens  compares favorable with the ratio (.06-.08) given by Schmidt (1946:4)  for five specimens from Honduras. _Chelydra serpentina_, which may occur  sympatrically with _C. rossignoni_ in some parts of Central America, has  a narrower plastral bridge and only two barbels beneath the chin.  Furthermore, _C. rossignoni_ and _C. osceola_ in Florida have long, flat  tubercles on the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the neck, whereas _C.  serpentina_ has short, round tubercles.    The specimen from Chinaja was found in a small sluggish stream; the  other individual was in a muddy pool in the forest. The local name is  _sambodanga_.      =Claudius angustatus= Cope          20 km. NNW of Chinaja, 1.    One specimen was unearthed from the bank of a small muddy stream by a  bulldozer. This individual represents the second record for the species  in Guatemala; the first was provided by specimens, likewise found in  muddy waters, at Tikal (Stuart, 1958:19). The local name is _caiman_.      =Kinosternon acutum= Gray          20 km. NNW of Chinaja, 4; 30 km. NNW of "]]]
