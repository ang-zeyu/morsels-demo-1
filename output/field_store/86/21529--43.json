Now, it is a fact  well known that this empire waxed exceedingly great for some time  after the death of Daniel, pushing its conquests westward, northward,  and southward, so that none could stand before it; until Alexander,  the king of Grecia, came from the west, with a small army of chosen  men, and attacked the Persians upon the banks of the river, and  plunging his horse in, and his army following, they crossed, and  attacked the Persians, who stood to oppose them on the bank with many  times their number; but, notwithstanding their number, and their  advantage of the ground, they were totally routed, and the Grecians  proceeded to overrun and subdue the country, beating the Persians in a  number of pitched battles, until they were entirely subdued. It is  also well known that Alexander, the king of Greece, went forth from  nation to nation, subduing the world before him, until, having  conquered the world, he died at Babylon, at the age of thirty-two  years. And thus, when he had waxed strong, the great horn was broken,  and for it came up four notable ones towards the four winds of heaven.  His kingdom was divided among four of his generals, who never attained  unto his power. Now, in the latter time of their kingdom, when the  transgression of the Jewish nation was come to the full, the Roman  power destroyed the Jewish nation, took Jerusalem, caused the daily  sacrifice to cease, and not only that, bat afterwards destroyed the  mighty and holy people, that is, the Apostles and primitive  Christians, who were slain by the authorities at Rome.    Now, let me inquire, Does the history of these United States give a  plainer account of past events than Daniel's wisdom did of events  which were then future, and some of them reaching down the stream of  time for several hundred years, unfolding events which no human  sagacity could possibly have foreseen? Man, by his own sagacity, may  accomplish many things; he may plough the trackless ocean without wind  or tide in his favor; he may soar aloft amid the clouds without the  aid of wings; he may traverse the land with astonishing velocity  without the aid of beasts; or he may convey his thoughts to his  fellows by the aid of letters. But there is a principle which he can  never attain to; no, not even by the wisdom of ages combined; money  will not purchase it; it comes from God only, and is bestowed upon man  as a free gift. Says the Prophet to the idols, \"_Tell us what shall  be, thai we may know that ye are gods_.\"    We will now proceed to show how exactly the prophecies were fulfilled  _literally_ in the person of Jesus Christ. \"Behold,\" said the Prophet,  \"a virgin shall conceive and bear a son.\" Again, Bethlehem should be  the place of his birth, and Egypt, where he sojourned with his  parents, the place out of which he was to be called. He turned aside  to Nazareth, for it was written, \"He shall be called a Nazarene.\" He  rode into Jerusalem upon a colt, the foal of an ass, because the  Prophet had said, \"Behold thy King cometh, meek and lowly, riding upon  a colt,\" etc. And again, saith the Prophet: \"He shall be afflicted and  despised; he shall be a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; he  shall be led as a lamb to the slaughter, and, like a sheep dumb before  his shearers, so he opened not his mouth; in his humiliation his  judgment was taken away; and who shall declare his generation, for his  life is taken from the earth. He was wounded for our transgressions,  and by his stripes we are healed; he was numbered with the  transgressors; he made his grave with the rich.\" Not a bone of him is  broken; they divide his raiment; cast lots for his vesture; give him  gall and vinegar to drink; betray him for thirty pieces of silver; and  finally, when it was finished, he rested in the tomb until the third  day, and then rose triumphant, without seeing corruption. Now, kind  reader, had you walked up and down with our dear Redeemer during his  whole sojourn in the flesh, and had you taken pains to record the  particular circumstances of his life and death, as they occurred from  time to time, your history would not be a plainer one than the  Prophets gave of him hundreds of years before he was born. There is  one thing we would do well to notice concerning the manner in which  the Apostles interpreted prophecy, and that is this--they simply  quoted it, and recorded its literal fulfilment. By pursuing this  course, they were enabled to bring it home to the hearts of the people  in the Jewish synagogues, with such convincing proof that they were  constrained to believe the supposed impostor whom they had crucified  was the Messiah. But had they once dreamed of rendering a  spiritualizing or uncertain application, like the teachers of the  present day, all would have been uncertainty and doubt, and  demonstration would have vanished from the earth.    Having taken a view of the Old Testament Prophets, concerning prophecy  and its fulfilment, and having shown clearly that nothing but a  literal fulfilment was intended, the objector may inquire whether the  same mode will apply to the predictions contained in the New  Testament. We will therefore bring a few important instances of  prophecy, and its fulfilment, from the New Testament; after which we  shall be prepared to enter the vast field which is still future. One  of the most remarkable prophecies in sacred writ is recorded by Luke,  chap, xxi, 20-24: \"And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with  armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh. Then let them  which are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let them which are in  the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries  enter thereinto; for these be the days of vengeance, that all things  which are written may be fulfilled. But woe unto them that are with  child, and to them that give suck in those days; for there shall be  great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people; and they shall  fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all  nations; and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until  the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.\" This prophecy involves the  fate of Jerusalem and the temple, and the whole Jewish nation, for at  least eighteen hundred years. About the year seventy, the Roman army  compassed Jerusalem. The disciples remembered the warning which had  been given them by their Lord and Master forty years before, and fled  to the mountains. The city of Jerusalem was taken, after a long and  tedious siege, in which the Jews suffered the extreme of famine,  pestilence and the sword; filling houses with the dead, for want of a  place to bury them, while women ate their own children, for want of  all things. In this struggle there perished, in Judea, near one  million and a half of Jews, besides those taken captive. Their country  was laid waste, their city burned, their temple destroyed, and the  miserable remnant dispersed abroad into all the nations of the earth;  in which situation they have continued ever since, being driven from  one nation to another, often falsely accused of the worst of crimes,  for which they have been banished and their goods confiscated. Indeed,  they have been mostly accounted as outlaws among the various nations;  the soles of their feet have found no rest, and they have been a hiss  and a byword; and people have said, \"These are the people of the Lord,  and are gone forth out of his land.\"    During all this time the Gentiles have possessed the land of Canaan,  and trodden under foot the holy city where their forefathers  worshipped the Lord. Now, in this long captivity, the Jews have never  lost sight of the promises respecting their return. Their eyes have  watched and failed with longing for the day, when they might possess  again that blessed inheritance bequeathed to their forefathers; when  they might again rear their city and temple, and re-establish their  priesthood, and worship as in days of old. Indeed they have made  several attempts to return, but were always frustrated in all their  attempts; for it was an unalterable decree, that Jerusalem should be  trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles should  be fulfilled. On the subject of this long dispersion, Moses and the  Prophets have written very plainly; indeed, Moses even mentioned the  particulars of their eating their children secretly in the siege and  in the straitness, wherewith their enemies should besiege them in all  their gates. Whoever will read the twenty-eighth of Deuteronomy, will  read the history of what has befallen the Jews, foretold by Moses with  all the clearness that characterizes the history of past events, and  all this thousands of years before its accomplishment.    Our next is found in Acts xxi, 10, 11, where a Prophet named Agabus  took Paul's girdle and bound his own hands and feet, and said: \"Thus  saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that  owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the  Gentiles.\" The fulfilment of this prediction is too well known to need  any description. We therefore proceed to notice a prophecy of Paul,  recorded in 2 Tim. iv, 3, 4: \"For the time will come, when they will  not endure sound doctrine, but, after their own lusts, shall they heap  to themselves teachers, having itching"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3567"],[0,"Memoirs of Napoleon Bonaparte — Complete (#6)"],[1," the requisite age for entering the army. Lucien was not received into  the College of Brienne, at least not until his brother had quitted the  Military School of Paris.    Bonaparte was undoubtedly a man of good family. I have seen an authentic  account of his genealogy, which he obtained from Tuscany. A great deal  has been said about the civil dissensions which forced his family to  quit Italy and take refuge in Corsica. On this subject I shall say  nothing.    Many and various accounts have been given of Bonaparte's youth.         --[The following interesting trait of Napoleon's childhood is     derived from the 'Memoirs of the Duchesse d'Arbranes':--\"He was one     day accused by one of his sisters of having eaten a basketful of     grapes, figs, and citrons, which had come from the garden of his     uncle the Canon. None but those who were acquainted with the     Bonaparte family can form any idea of the enormity of this offence.     To eat fruit belonging to the uncle the Canon was infinitely more     criminal than to eat grapes and figs which might be claimed by     anybody else. An inquiry took place. Napoleon denied the fact,     and was whipped. He was told that if he would beg pardon he should     be forgiven. He protested that he was innocent, but he was not     believed. If I recollect rightly, his mother was at the time on a     visit to M. de Marbeuf, or some other friend. The result of     Napoleon's obstinacy was, that he was kept three whole days on bread     and cheese, and that cheese was not 'broccio'. However, he would     not cry: he was dull, but not sulky. At length, on the fourth day     of his punishment a little friend of Marianne Bonaparte returned     from the country, and on hearing of Napoleon's disgrace she     confessed that she and Marianne had eaten the fruit. It was now     Marianne's turn to be punished. When Napoleon was asked why he had     not accused his sister, he replied that though he suspected that she     was guilty, yet out of consideration to her little friend, who had     no share in the falsehood, he had said nothing. He was then only     seven years of age\" (vol. i. p. 9, edit. 1883).]--    He has been described in terms of enthusiastic praise and exaggerated  condemnation. It is ever thus with individuals who by talent or  favourable circumstances are raised above their fellow-creatures.  Bonaparte himself laughed at all the stories which were got up for the  purpose of embellishing or blackening his character in early life. An  anonymous publication, entitled the 'History of Napoleon Bonaparte',  from his Birth to his last abdication, contains perhaps the greatest  collection of false and ridiculous details about his boyhood. Among  other things, it is stated that he fortified a garden to protect himself  from the attacks of his comrades, who, a few lines lower down, are  described as treating him with esteem and respect. I remember the  circumstances which, probably, gave rise to the fabrication inserted in  the work just mentioned; they were as follows.    During the winter of 1783-84, so memorable for heavy falls of snow,  Napoleon was greatly at a loss for those retired walks and outdoor  recreations in which he used to take much delight. He had no alternative  but to mingle with his comrades, and, for exercise, to walk with them up  and down a spacious hall. Napoleon, weary of this monotonous promenade,  told his comrades that he thought they might amuse themselves much  better with the snow, in the great courtyard, if they would get shovels  and make hornworks, dig trenches, raise parapets, cavaliers, etc. \"This  being done,\" said he, \"we may divide ourselves into sections, form a  siege, and I will undertake to direct the attacks.\" The proposal, which  was received with enthusiasm, was immediately put into execution. This  little sham war was carried on for the space of a fortnight, and did not  cease until a quantity of gravel and small stones having got mixed with  the snow of which we made our bullets, many of the combatants, besiegers  as well as besieged, were seriously wounded. I well remember that I was  one of the worst sufferers from this sort of grapeshot fire.    It is almost unnecessary to contradict the story about the ascent in  the balloon. It is now very well known that the hero of that headlong  adventure was not young Bonaparte, as has been alleged, but one of his  comrades, Dudont de Chambon, who was somewhat eccentric. Of this his  subsequent conduct afforded sufficient proofs.    Bonaparte's mind was directed to objects of a totally different kind. He  turned his attention to political science. During some of his vacations  he enjoyed the society of the Abby Raynal, who used to converse with him  on government, legislation, commercial relations, etc.    On festival days, when the inhabitants of Brienne were admitted to our  amusements, posts were established for the maintenance of order. Nobody  was permitted to enter the interior of the building without a card  signed by the principal, or vice-principal. The rank of officers or  sub-officers was conferred according to merit; and Bonaparte one day  had the command of a post, when the following little adventure occurred,  which affords an instance of his decision of character.    The wife of the porter of the school,         --[This woman, named Haute, was afterwards placed at Malmaison, with     her husband. They both died as concierges of Malmaison. This shows     that Napoleon had a memory.--Bourrienne.]--    who was very well known, because she used to sell milk, fruit, etc., to  the pupils, presented herself one Saint Louis day for admittance to the  representation of the 'Death of Caesar, corrected', in which I was to  perform the part of Brutus. As the woman had no ticket, and insisted on  being admitted without one, some disturbance arose. The serjeant of the  post reported the matter to the officer, Napoleon Bonaparte, who in an  imperious tone of voice exclaimed: \"Send away that woman, who comes here  with her camp impudence.\" This was in 1782.    Bonaparte and I were eight years of, age when our friendship commenced.  It speedily became very intimate, for there was a certain sympathy of  heart between us. I enjoyed this friendship and intimacy until 1784,  when he was transferred from the Military College of Brienne to that  of Paris. I was one among those of his youthful comrades who could best  accommodate themselves to his stern character. His natural reserve, his  disposition to meditate on the conquest of Corsica, and the impressions  he had received in childhood respecting the misfortunes of his country  and his family, led him to seek retirement, and rendered his general  demeanour, though in appearance only, somewhat unpleasing. Our equality  of age brought us together in the classes of the mathematics and 'belles  lettres'. His ardent wish to acquire knowledge was remarkable from the  very commencement of his studies. When he first came to the college he  spoke only the Corsican dialect, and the Sieur Dupuis,         --[He afterwards filled the post of librarian to Napoleon at     Malmaison.]--    who was vice-principal before Father Berton, gave him instructions in  the French language. In this he made such rapid progress that in a short  time he commenced the first rudiments of Latin. But to this study he  evinced such a repugnance that at the age of fifteen he was not out of  the fourth class. There I left him very speedily; but I could never get  before him in the mathematical class, in which he was undoubtedly the  cleverest lad at the college. I used sometimes to help him with his  Latin themes and versions in return for the aid he afforded me in the  solution of problems, at which he evinced a degree of readiness and  facility which perfectly astonished me.    When at Brienne, Bonaparte was remarkable for the dark color of  his complexion (which, subsequently, the climate of France somewhat  changed), for his piercing and scrutinising glance, and for the style  of his conversation both with his masters and comrades. His conversation  almost always bore the appearance of ill-humour, and he was certainly  not very amiable. This I attribute to the misfortunes his family had  sustained and the impressions made on his mind by the conquest of his  country.    The pupils were invited by turns to dine with Father Berton, the head of  the school. One day, it being Bonaparte's turn to enjoy this indulgence,  some of the professors who were at table designedly made some  disrespectful remarks on Paoli, of whom they knew the young Corsican was  an enthusiastic admirer. \"Paoli,\" observed Bonaparte, \"was a great man;  he loved his country; and I will never forgive my father, who was his  adjutant, for having concurred in the union of Corsica with France. He  ought to have followed Paoli's fortune, and have fallen with him.\"         --[The Duchesse d'Abrantes, speaking of the personal characteristics     of Bonaparte in youth and manhood, says, \"Saveria told me that     Napoleon was never a pretty boy, as Joseph was, for example: his     head always appeared too large for his body, a defect common to the     Bonaparte family. When Napoleon grew up, the peculiar charm of his     countenance lay in his eye, especially in the mild expression it     assumed in his moments of kindness. His anger, to be sure, was     frightful, and though I am no coward, I never could look at him in     his fits of rage without shuddering. Though his smile was     captivating, yet the expression of his mouth when disdainful or     angry could scarcely be seen without terror. But that forehead     which seemed formed to bear the crowns of a whole world; those     hands, of which the most coquettish women might have been vain, and     whose white skin covered muscles of iron; in short, of all that     personal beauty which distinguished Napoleon as a young man, no     traces were"]]]
