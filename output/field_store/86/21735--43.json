Soon the soil of Illinois was free from \"Mormon\" tread; Nauvoo  was deserted, her 20,000 inhabitants expatriated.  Colonel Thomas  L. Kane, a conspicuous figure at this stage of our country's  history, was traveling eastward at the time, and reached Nauvoo  shortly after its evacuation.  In a lecture before the Historical  Society of Pennsylvania, he related his experience in this  sometime abode of the Saints.  I paraphrase a portion of his  eloquent address.    Sighting the city from the western shore of the mighty  Mississippi, as it nestled in the river's encircling embrace, he  crossed to its principal wharf, and, there to his surprise, found  no soul to meet him.  The stillness that everywhere prevailed was  painful, broken only by an occasional faint echo of boisterous  shout or ribald song from a distance.  The town was in a dream,  and the warrior trod lightly lest he wake it in affright, for he  plainly saw that it had not slumbered long.  No grass grew in the  pavement joints; recent footprints were still distinct in the  dusty thoroughfares.  The visitor made his way unmolested into  work-shops and smithies; tools lay as last used; on the  carpenter's bench was the unfinished frame, on the floor were the  shavings fresh and odorous; the wood was piled in readiness  before the baker's oven; the blacksmith's forge was cold, but the  shop looked as though the occupant had just gone off for a  holiday.  The gallant soldier entered gardens unchallenged by  owner, human guard, or watchful dog; he might have supposed the  people hidden or dead in their houses; but the doors were not  fastened, and he entered to explore, there were fresh ashes on  the hearth; no great accumulation of the dust of time was on  floors or furniture; the awful quiet compelled him to tread  a-tip-toe as if threading the aisles of an unoccupied cathedral.  He hastened to the graveyard, though surely the city had not been  depopulated by pestilence.  No; there were a few stones newly  set, some sods freshly turned in this sacred acre of God, but  where can you find a cemetery of a living town with no such  evidence of recent interment?  There were fields of heavy grain,  the bounteous harvest rotting on the ground; there were orchards  dropping their rich and rosy fruit to spoil beneath; not a hand  to gather or save.    But in a suburban corner, he came across the smoldering embers of  a barbecue fire, with fragments of flesh and other remnants of a  feast.  Hereabout houses had been demolished; and there beyond,  around the great temple that had first attracted his attention  from the Iowa shore, armed men were bivouacked.  This worthy  representative of our country's service was challenged by the  drunken crowd, and made to give an account of himself, and to  answer for having crossed the river without a permit from the  head of the band.  Finding that he was a stranger, they related  to him in fiendish glee their recent exploits of pillage, rapine,  and murder.  They conducted him through the temple; everywhere  were marks of their brutish acts; its altars of prayer were  broken; the baptismal font had been so \"diligently desecrated as  to render the apartment in which it was contained too noisome to  abide in.\"  There in the steeple close by the \"scar of divine  wrath\" left by a recent thunderbolt, were broken covers of liquor  and drinking vessels.    Sickened with the sight, disgusted with this spectacle of  outrage, the colonel recrossed the river at nightfall, beating  upward, for the wind had freshened.  Attracted by a faint light  near the bank, he approached the spot, there to find a few  haggard faces surrounding one who seemed to be in the last stages  of fever.  The sufferer was partially protected by something like  a tent made from a couple of bed sheets; and amid such  environment, the spirit was pluming itself for flight.  Making  his way through this camp of misery, he heard the sobbings of  children hungry and sick; there were men and women dying from  wounds or disease, without a semblance of shelter or other  physical comfort; wives in the pangs of maternity, ushering into  the world innocent babes doomed to be motherless from their  birth.  And at intervals, to the ears of those outcasts, the sick  and the dying, the wind brought the soul-piercing sounds of the  reveling mob in the distant city, the scrap of vulgar song, the  shocking oath, shrieked from the temple tower in the madness of  drunken orgies.    This, however, was but the rear remnant of the' expatriated  Christian band.  The van was already far on its way toward the  inviting wilderness of the all but unknown west.  But the  wanderers were not wholly without friends; certain Indian tribes,  the Omahas and the Potawatomis, welcomed them to their lands,  inviting them to camp within their territory during the coming  winter.  \"Welcome,\" said these children of the forest, \"we too  have been driven from our pleasant homes east of the great river,  to these damp and unhealthful bottoms; you now, white men, have  been driven forth to the prairies; we are fellow-sufferers.  Welcome, brothers.\"    In return much assistance was rendered by the white refugees to  their, shall I say savage friends?  If it was civilization the  wanderers had left, then indeed might the red men of the forest  have felt proud of their distinction.  But the Indian agent, a  Christian gentleman, ordered the \"Mormons\" to move on and leave  the reservation which a kind government had provided for its red  children.  An order from President Polk, who had been appealed to  by Colonel Kane, gave the people permission to remain for a short  season.  The government of Iowa had courteously assured them  protection while passing through that territory.  As soon as the  people were well under way, a thorough organization was effected.  Remembering the toilsome desert march from Egypt to Canaan, the  people assumed the name, \"Camp of Israel.\"  The camp consisted of  two main divisions, and each was sub-divided into companies of  hundreds, fifties, and tens, with captains to direct.  An officer  with one hundred volunteers went ahead of the main body to select  a route and prepare a road.  At this time, there were over one  thousand wagons of the \"Mormons\" rolling westward, and the line  of march soon reached from the Mississippi to Council Bluffs.  There were in the company not half enough draft animals for the  arduous march, and but an insufficient number of able-bodied men  to tend the camps.  The women had to assist in driving teams and  stock, and in other labors of the journey.  Yet with their  characteristic cheerfulness the people made the best, and that  proved to be a great deal, out of their lot.  When the camp  halted, a city seemed to spring as if by magic from the prairie  soil.  Concerts and social gatherings were usual features of the  evening rests.    But another great event disturbed the equanimity of the camp.  War had broken out between Mexico and the United States.  General  Taylor's victories in the early stages of the strife had been all  but decisive, but the Republic was on march to the western ocean  and the provinces of New Mexico and California were in her path.  These two provinces comprised in addition to the territory now  designated by those names, Utah, Nevada, portions of Wyoming and  Colorado, as also Arizona; while Oregon, then claimed by Great  Britain, included Washington, Idaho, and portions of Montana and  Wyoming.  It was the plan of the national administration to  occupy these provinces at the earliest moment possible; and a  call was made upon the \"Mormon\" refugees to contribute to the  general force by furnishing a battalion of five hundred men to  take part in the war with Mexico.  The surprise which the message  of the government officer produced in the camp amounted almost to  dismay.  Five hundred men fit to bear arms to be drafted from  that camp!  What would become of the rest?  Already women and  boys had been pressed into service to do the work of men; already  the sick and the halt had been neglected; and many graves marked  the path they had traversed, whose tenants had passed to their  last sleep through lack of care.    But how long did they hesitate?  Scarcely an hour; it was the  call of their country.  True, they were even then leaving the  national soil, but not of their own will.  To them their country  was and is the promised land, the Lord's chosen place, the land  of Zion.  \"You shall have your battalion,\" said Brigham Young to  Captain Allen, the muster officer, \"and if there are not young  men enough, we will take the old men, and if they are not enough,  we will take the women.\"  Within a week from the time President  Polk's message was received, the entire force, in all five  hundred and forty-nine souls, was on the march to Fort  Leavenworth.  Their path from the Missouri to the Pacific led  them over two thousand miles, much of this distance being  measured through deserts, which prior to that time had not been  trodden by civilized foot.    Colonel Cooke, the commander of the \"Mormon\" Battalion, declared,  \"History may be searched in vain for an equal march of infantry.\"  Many were disabled through the severity of the march, and  numerous cases of sickness and death were chronicled.  General  Kearney and his successor, Governor R. B. Mason, as military  commandants of California, spoke in high praise of this  organization, and in their official reports declared that they  had made efforts to prolong the battalion's term of service; but  most of the men chose to rejoin their families as soon as they  could secure their honorable discharge.

I've seen them,\" cried Mr. King with a shrewd air, \"and I'm  going now to give them a little pleasure.\"    Marian said nothing, but let him have the comfort of doing all the  talking, which he now enjoyed to his heart's content.    \"Whether the other chaps have done well, I don't know. Davie may have  kept at it, but I suspect the rest of the boys haven't killed  themselves with hard study. But they shall have a good home-coming, at  any rate.\"    Mrs. Whitney smiled, and he proceeded:    \"Now I'm going to send out these invitations\"--he pushed the list  toward her--\"I shall have the drawing-room and music-room floors  covered, and all extra seats arranged, give Turner carte blanche as to  flowers, if he can't furnish enough out of our own conservatories--and  the evening will end with a handsome 'spread,' as Jasper calls it. In  short, I shall recognize their attempt to make it pleasant for the  boys' holiday, by helping them out on the affair all I can.\" The old  gentleman now leaned back in his big chair and studied his daughter's  face.    \"And you'll never regret it, father,\" she cried, with an enthusiasm  that satisfied him, \"for these young people will all repay you a  thousand-fold, I do believe, in the time to come.\"    \"Don't I know it?\" cried Mr. King, getting out of his chair hastily to  pace the floor. \"Goodness me! they repay me already. They're fine young  things, every one of them--Whitneys, Peppers and my boy--as fine as  they are made. And whoever says they're not, doesn't know a good piece  of work when it's before his eyes. Bless me!\" pulling out his  handkerchief to mop his face violently, \"I don't want to see any finer.\"    \"I hope I shall have a sight of Jasper's and Polly's faces when you  tell them what you intend to do,\" said Mrs. Whitney; \"where are your  cards, father?\"    \"Tell them? I shan't tell them at all,\" cried the old gentleman; \"I'm  going to have a surprise, too. No one must know it but you and Mrs.  Pepper.\"    \"Oh!\" said Mrs. Whitney. \"It was very stupid in me not to understand  that. It will be all right, father; Mrs. Pepper and I will keep our  secret, you needn't fear.\"    \"If you can only keep HER out of the way,\" exclaimed Mr. King, pointing  irascibly in the direction of Mrs. Chatterton's apartments, \"all will  be well. But I doubt if you can; her meddlesome ears and tongue will be  at work as usual,\" he added in extreme vexation.    \"Here comes Jasper,\" exclaimed Mrs. Whitney, which had the satisfactory  result of bringing her father out of his irritation, into a flutter  over the concealment of the party preparations.    \"Jasper,\" cried Polly that evening, as they ran into the music-room to  play a duet, \"we're all right about everything now, as your father says  we may invite the girls and your friends.\"    \"And he said when I asked him if we ought not to have cake and coffee,  'I'll attend to that,'\" said Jasper, \"so everything is all straight as  far as I can see, Polly.\"    \"The private boxes trouble me, I must confess,\" said Polly, drumming  absently on the keys, while Jasper spread the sheet of music on the  rack. \"You know there must be two; one for dear Mr. King and one for  the boys as guests of honor. Now how shall we manage them?\"    She took her hand off suddenly from the keys and folded it over its  fellow on her knee, to study his face anxiously.    \"It's pretty hard to get them up, that's a fact,\" said Jasper  truthfully, \"but then, you know, Polly, we've always found that when a  thing had to be done, it was done. You know the little brown house  taught us that.\"    \"So it did,\" said Polly, brightening up. \"Dear little old brown house,  how could I ever forget it! Well, I suppose,\" with a sigh, \"it will  come to us as an inspiration when it's time to fix them.\"    \"I suppose so too,\" said Mrs. Pepper, passing the door, as usual with  her mending basket, \"and when two people start to play a duet, I think  they much better put their minds on that, and not waste precious time  on all sorts of questions that will take care of themselves when the  time comes.\"    \"You are right, Mrs. Pepper,\" cried Jasper with a laugh, and seating  himself before the piano. \"Come, Polly!\"    \"Mamsie is always right, isn't she, Jasper?\" cried Polly with pride,  putting her hands down for the first chords.    \"Indeed she is,\" responded the boy heartily. \"Here now, Polly,  remember, you slipped up a bit on that first bar. Now!\"    The twenty-first of December came all too soon for Polly and Jasper,  whose school duties had engrossed them till two days before, but after  hard work getting up the stage properties, and the many rehearsals,  everything was at last pronounced ready, the drawing-room and  music-room locked, the keys given to Mrs. Whitney who promised  faithfully to see that no one peeped in who should not, and Polly  hurried into her hat and jacket, to go to the station with Jasper to  meet the boys.    Thomas drove furiously, as they were a bit late, and they arrived only  a minute before the train puffed in.    \"Here they are!\" cried Polly, and \"Here they are!\" cried Jasper,  together, in great excitement, on the platform.    \"Halloo, Polly!\" cried Joel, prancing out of the car first, and \"How  d'ye do, Polly?\" as they all hurried after. \"Halloo, Jasper!\"    \"Oh, Polly! it's good to see you!\" This from Davie, not ashamed to set  a kiss on her red lips.    Van and Percy looked as if they wanted to, but contented themselves  with wringing her hand nearly off, while Joel declared he would look  after the luggage.    \"No, I will,\" cried Van, dropping Polly's hand.    \"You forget,\" said Percy quietly, \"I hold the checks, I'll attend to it  myself.\" He unclosed his brown traveling glove, and Van, at sight of  them, turned back.    \"Go along, do, then,\" he cried; \"I don't want to, I'm sure; I'd much  rather stay with Polly. How d'ye do, Thomas?\" he called carelessly to  the coachman on his box, who was continually touching his hat and  indulging in broad smiles of content.    Polly was tiptoeing in very delight, holding Davie's hand closely while  her eyes roved from one to the other of the boys, and her tongue ran  fast indeed. A group of girls, who had also come down to the station to  meet friends, stopped a bit as they came laughing and chatting by.    \"How d'ye, boys?\" they said carelessly to the three home-comers. \"Oh,  Polly! won't it be entrancing to-night?\" cried one of them, seizing her  arm as she spoke.    \"Hush!\" said Polly, as she tried to stop her.    \"May I bring Elsie Fay? she's come on the train to stay over Christmas  with her aunt. May I, Polly?\" begged another girl eagerly.    \"Yes, yes,\" said Polly in a paroxysm of fear lest Joel, who was  crowding up between them, should catch a word; \"do be still,\" she  whispered. \"Bring anybody; only stop, Alexia.\"    \"He won't hear,\" said Alexia carelessly; \"that boy doesn't mind our  talking; his head's full of skating and coasting.\"    \"You're going to have something to-night that you don't want me to know  about,\" declared Joel, his chubby face set defiantly, and crowding  closer; \"so there; now I'm going to find out what it is.\"    \"If we don't want you to know, you ought not to try to find out, Joel  Pepper,\" cried Alexia. \"And you shan't, either.\"    \"There, now you see,\" cried Polly, unable to keep still, while her face  grew red too. \"O dear! what shall we do?\"    \"You are--you are,\" cried Joel, capering up and down the platform, his  black eyes shining with delight. \"Now I know for certain, and it's at  our house, too, for you asked Polly if you might bring some other girl,  Elsie somebody or other, so! Oh! I'll soon know.\"    \"Joel,\" exclaimed Jasper suddenly, clapping him on the shoulder, \"I'm  going round to the gymnasium; want to go with me?\"    Joel stopped his capering at once, this new idea thrusting out the old  one.    \"Don't I, though!\" he cried, with a nod at Polly and her friends. \"But  I'll find out when I do get home,\" the nod declared plainly.    But Jasper also nodded. He said, \"He won't get home till late; depend  on me.\" And then \"Come on, Joe,\" he cried; \"I'm going to walk,\" and  they were off.    Alexia pinched Polly's gray woolen jacket sleeve convulsively. \"What an  escape,\" she breathed.    \"Here comes Percy,\" cried Polly nervously, and she broke away from her  and the other girls, and ran to meet him, and the two boys following.    \"Where's Jasper?\" asked Percy, rendered quite important in air and  step, from his encounter with the baggage officials.    \"Oh! he isn't going home with us,\" said Polly. \"Come, do let us get  in,\" and she scampered off to the carriage and climbed within.    \"That's funny,\" said Percy, jumping in after.    Van opened his lips to tell where Jasper had gone, but remembering  Percy's delight in such an expedition, he closed them quickly, and  added himself to the company in the carriage. Davie followed, and  closed the door quickly.    \"Stop! where's Joel?\" asked Percy. \"Thomas, we've forgotten Joe,\"  rapping on the glass to the coachman.    \"No, we haven't; he isn't going to drive,\" said Polly.    \"Oh!\" and Percy, thinking that Joel had stolen a march on them on his  good strong legs, now cried lustily, \"Go on, Thomas; get ahead as fast  as you can,\" and presently he was lost in the babel of laughter and  chatter going on in the coach.    \"I've a piece of news,\" presently cried Van in a lull. \"Davie's  bringing home a prize; first in classics, you know.\"    \"Oh, Davie!\" screamed Polly, and she leaned over to throw her arms  around him; \"Mamsie will be so glad."]]]
