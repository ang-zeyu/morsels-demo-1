Here, on  their departure for Ladybrand, they left 12 officers and 70 men, who had  been wounded in the fray, and whom they doubtless considered might be an  encumbrance to their future movements. These were conveyed by ambulance  to Bloemfontein.    [Illustration: MAP ILLUSTRATING THE MILITARY OPERATIONS TO THE S. AND E.  OF BLOEMFONTEIN.]    As an instance of Boer treachery, it was stated that the Free State  commandant Pretorius, whose farm overlooked the spruit wherein the  ambuscade was arranged, had given up arms and taken the oath to retire  to his farm. Yet on the day of the disaster he led the Boers to the  attack, while the members of his family were prominent among the looters  of the wrecked waggons. Other tales of cruelty and ill-treatment and  treachery on the part of the Boers were well authenticated. It is  useless to repeat them, but the circumstances are merely noted to give  an explanation for a change of policy which was necessitated by the  actions of the enemy--a change which was, unfortunately, adopted only  when many martyrs had been made in the cause of forbearance.      THE REDDERSBURG MISHAP    The Boers, triumphant with their success at Koorn Spruit, scurried to  Dewetsdorp, drove out the British detachment which had been posted there  by General Gatacre, and on the 4th of April came in for another piece of  luck, for which we had to pay by the loss of three companies of Royal  Irish Rifles and two companies of the Northumberland Fusiliers.    The unfortunate occurrence took place near Reddersburg, somewhat to the  east of Bethanie Railway Station. A party of infantry, consisting of  three companies of Royal Irish Rifles and two companies of the  Northumberland Fusiliers, who had been in occupation of Dewetsdorp, and  engaged on a pacification mission on the east of the Free State, were  ordered on the 3rd to retire to Reddersburg, a place situated some  thirty-seven miles from Bloemfontein and fifty miles from Springfontein,  where General Gatacre had taken up his head-quarters. In their  retirement the troops, it is said, took a somewhat unusual detour, and  thus, if they did not court, ran risk of disaster. Anyway, they had  travelled about four miles to the east of their destination when, at  Mosterts Hok, they were surprised to discover a strong force of some  2500 Boers. They were still more surprised to find that, while they  themselves were unaccompanied by artillery, and were possessed of little  reserve ammunition, the Dutchmen were provided with three or four  formidable guns. Thus, the situation from the first was alarming. Our  men, comparatively defenceless, saw themselves hedged in by an  overmastering horde. They quickly occupied a position on a peaked hill  rising in the centre of ground sliced and seamed with dry nullahs. These  popular havens of refuge were at once seized by the Boers and deftly  made use of. The Dutchmen, under cover of the dongas, crept cautiously  up on all sides of the kopje, surrounding it and pouring cascades of  rifle-fire on the small exposed force. In no time the chance of retreat  was barred on all sides, and there was no resource but to fight through.  But unfortunately, as British ammunition was limited and the Boers  warily kept well out of range, all that could be done was to prolong  hostilities in the hope that delay would enable reinforcements from  Bethanie to come to the rescue. But these did not arrive. The Boers,  grasping the situation, gathered courage and approached nearer and  nearer. With the dusk coming on and some 2500 of the foe enfilading them  from three sides, the British position, as may be imagined, was not a  hopeful one. Nevertheless, the Royal Irish Rifles displayed the national  spirit of dare-devilry--\"fought like bricks,\" some one said--never  losing heart under the persistent attacks of shot and shell that  continued till nightfall.    [Illustration: THE REDDERSBURG MISHAP: MEN OF THE IRISH RIFLES AND  MOUNTED INFANTRY DELIVERING UP THEIR ARMS    Facsimile of a Sketch by Melton Prior, War Artist]    Hoping and waiting and fighting; so passed the dreadful hours of dark.  Then, with the dawn, the enemy, flushed with triumph, commenced to pound  their prey with redoubled vigour, while our parched and almost  ammunitionless troops, in a ghastly quandary, alternately fought and  prayed for relief!    Meanwhile the news of the affair having reached Lord Roberts, General  Gatacre, on the afternoon of the 3rd, was ordered to proceed from  Springfontein to the spot, while the Cameron Highlanders were despatched  from Bloemfontein to Bethanie.    General Gatacre, with his main body and an advance guard of mounted  infantry under Colonel Sitwell, then marched _via_ Edenburg to the  succour of the detachment. On the morning of the 4th, Colonel Sitwell  having arrived at Bethanie, some fifteen miles from Mosterts Hok, heard  sounds of artillery in the distance, and believing that the engagement  was going on, prepared to rush to the rescue. But with the small force  at his disposal, he deemed it impossible to try a frontal attack, and  decided to make an attempt to get round the enemy's right flank. The  manoeuvre was unsuccessful, for a party of hidden Boers, from a kopje  north-west of Reddersburg, assailed him and forced him to retire and  wait till the main column should come to his assistance. But by the time  General Gatacre had reached the scene (10.30 A.M. on the 4th) the drama  had been enacted, the curtain had descended on the tragedy. The small  and valorous party on Mosterts Hok, which for thirty hours had been  fighting and were at last sans water, sans ammunition, sans everything  in fact, had been forced to surrender. No sign of them was to be seen.  The unfortunate band--many of them the survivors of the fatal exploit at  Stormberg--were now on their way to that aristocratical  prison-house--the Model School at Pretoria.    General Gatacre, finding further effort useless, then occupied the town  of Reddersburg. There, the Boers had hoisted the Free State flag, and  were making themselves generally objectionable. Quickly the Boer banner  was torn down and the Union Jack run up, though during the operations  the General narrowly escaped assassination. He was fired at from a  house, but fortunately escaped with only a scratch on the shoulder.    By evening, acting on instructions from Bloemfontein, and owing to the  fact that the enemy was massed in all directions and surrounding the  town, the force and its prisoners returned to Bethanie, and there  encamped to mount guard over the rail. Details regarding the movements  of the troops on this grievous day were given by a correspondent, in the  _Daily Telegraph_, whose version throws a somewhat depressing light on  the sufficiently depressing affair. The writer declared that:--    \"A large British force, with a brigade division of artillery (eighteen  guns), on the march to Bloemfontein, was at Bethanie, about eleven miles  from Reddersburg, on the night of April 3, and got the news of the  above-mentioned infantry being surrounded about 11 P.M. The men  immediately saddled up, got under arms, and remained all night ready to  move off in relief, but did not receive orders to do so until 8 A.M. on  April 4, and then were only permitted to proceed at a walk, constantly  halting to water the horses. The result of the delay was that the column  arrived just too late, and was then not even allowed to pursue the enemy  and release the prisoners, who were dead beat and could not possibly  have been hurried along. The relief column was manoeuvred outside the  town of Reddersburg during most of the day, and then was ordered to  return to Bethanie, but, when within a few miles of camp, with the  horses and men tired out, a complete change of instructions were issued,  and the column was wheeled about and told to march back and take the  town of Reddersburg. The Cameron Highlanders, who had just come off a  troopship from Egypt, and were, consequently, quite unfit, could hardly  move, but all had to turn, for no apparent reason, and march to the  ground they had left. The mounted infantry and artillery trotted back  and occupied Reddersburg about dusk, with only one casualty, viz. an  officer of mounted infantry, and the force bivouacked, with very little  food, just outside the town.    \"About midnight, the order was given to return to Bethanie again, and  the men, who could hardly crawl, were awakened, the march resumed, and  Bethanie was reached about 7 A.M. on April 5, after great and  unnecessary distress both to men and animals, while no object was  gained, the whole expedition being a miserable fiasco, disheartening and  humiliating to every one present.    \"To whom blame is attributable it is difficult to say, as the officer in  command seemed not to have a free hand, but to be directed by wires  received at intervals, which must have taken five or six hours to reach  him. Either the relief ought never to have been attempted, or it ought  to have been carried out expeditiously and with determination.\"    Mr. Purves, who, as a lance-corporal with one of the Ambulance Corps,  was in the thick of the fray, gave a graphic description of the unhappy  affair:--         \"Reaching Dewetsdorp on the morning of Sunday, April 1st, we       first became aware that our progress was being watched by the       Boers. Just as we were about to camp outside the dorp, our       scouts exchanged a few shots with those of the enemy. Beyond a       temporary disarrangement of our plans, nothing happened, as the       main body of the enemy did not show at all, and things quieted       down till nightfall, when another alarm was caused by the       arrival of the Mounted Infantry (Royal Irish Rifles and       Northumberland Fusiliers), who were mistaken by our people for       Boers, as their arrival was unexpected,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41085"],[0,"The New Life (La Vita Nuova) (#6)"],[1,"her, all my senses were  overpowered by the great lordship that Love obtained, finding himself  so near unto that most gracious being, until nothing but the spirits  of sight remained to me; and even these remained driven out of their  own instruments because Love entered in that honoured place of theirs,  that so he might the better behold her. And although I was other than  at first, I grieved for the spirits so expelled, which kept up a sore  lament, saying: \"If he had not in this wise thrust us forth, we also  should behold the marvel of this lady.\" By this, many of her friends,  having discerned my confusion, began to wonder; and together with  herself, kept whispering of me and mocking me. Whereupon my friend, who  knew not what to conceive, took me by the hands, and drawing me forth  from among them, required to know what ailed me. Then, having first  held me at quiet for a space until my perceptions were come back to me,  I made answer to my friend: \"Of a surety I have now set my feet on that  point of life, beyond the which he must not pass who would return.\"[19]      [19] It is difficult not to connect Dante's agony at this         wedding-feast with our knowledge that in her twenty-first year         Beatrice was wedded to Simone de' Bardi. That she herself was         the bride on this occasion might seem out of the question,         from the fact of its not being in any way so stated: but on         the other hand, Dante's silence throughout the _Vita Nuova_         as regards her marriage (which must have brought deep sorrow         even to his ideal love) is so startling, that we might almost         be led to conceive in this passage the only intimation of it         which he thought fit to give.    Afterwards, leaving him, I went back to the room where I had wept  before; and again weeping and ashamed, said: \"If this lady but knew  of my condition, I do not think that she would thus mock at me; nay,  I am sure that she must needs feel some pity.\" And in my weeping I  bethought me to write certain words, in the which, speaking to her, I  should signify the occasion of my disfigurement, telling her also how  I knew that she had no knowledge thereof: which, if it were known, I  was certain must move others to pity. And then, because I hoped that  peradventure it might come into her hearing, I wrote this sonnet:--        Even as the others mock, thou mockest me;        Not dreaming, noble lady, whence it is        That I am taken with strange semblances,      Seeing thy face which is so fair to see:      For else, compassion would not suffer thee        To grieve my heart with such harsh scoffs as these.        Lo! Love, when thou art present, sits at ease,      And bears his mastership so mightily,      That all my troubled senses he thrusts out,        Sorely tormenting some, and slaying some,          Till none but he is left and has free range          To gaze on thee. This makes my face to change        Into another's; while I stand all dumb,      And hear my senses clamour in their rout.    _This sonnet I divide not into parts, because a division is only  made to open the meaning of the thing divided: and this, as it is  sufficiently manifest through the reasons given, has no need of  division. True it is that, amid the words whereby is shown the occasion  of this sonnet, dubious words are to be found; namely, when I say  that Love kills all my spirits, but that the visual remain in life,  only outside of their own instruments. And this difficulty it is  impossible for any to solve who is not in equal guise liege unto Love;  and, to those who are so, that is manifest which would clear up the  dubious words. And therefore it were not well for me to expound this  difficulty, inasmuch as my speaking would be either fruitless or else  superfluous._    A while after this strange disfigurement, I became possessed with a  strong conception which left me but very seldom, and then to return  quickly. And it was this: \"Seeing that thou comest into such scorn by  the companionship of this lady, wherefore seekest thou to behold her?  If she should ask thee this thing, what answer couldst thou make unto  her? yea, even though thou wert master of all thy faculties, and in  no way hindered from answering.\" Unto the which, another very humble  thought said in reply: \"If I were master of all my faculties, and in  no way hindered from answering, I would tell her that no sooner do I  image to myself her marvellous beauty than I am possessed with a desire  to behold her, the which is of so great strength that it kills and  destroys in my memory all those things which might oppose it; and it  is therefore that the great anguish I have endured thereby is yet not  enough to restrain me from seeking to behold her.\" And then, because  of these thoughts, I resolved to write somewhat, wherein, having  pleaded mine excuse, I should tell her of what I felt in her presence.  Whereupon I wrote this sonnet:--        The thoughts are broken in my memory,        Thou lovely Joy, whene'er I see thy face;        When thou art near me, Love fills up the space,      Often repeating, \"If death irk thee, fly.\"      My face shows my heart's colour, verily,        Which, fainting, seeks for any leaning-place;        Till, in the drunken terror of disgrace,      The very stones seem to be shrieking, \"Die!\"      It were a grievous sin, if one should not        Strive then to comfort my bewildered mind          (Though merely with a simple pitying)      For the great anguish which thy scorn has wrought        In the dead sight o' the eyes grown nearly blind,          Which look for death as for a blessed thing.    _This sonnet is divided into two parts. In the first, I tell the cause  why I abstain not from coming to this lady. In the second, I tell  what befalls me through coming to her; and this part begins here \"When  thou art near.\" And also this second part divides into five distinct  statements. For, in the first, I say what Love, counselled by Reason,  tells me when I am near the lady. In the second, I set forth the state  of my heart by the example of the face. In the third, I say how all  ground of trust fails me. In the fourth, I say that he sins who shows  not pity of me, which would give me some comfort. In the last, I say  why people should take pity: namely, for the piteous look which comes  into mine eyes; which piteous look is destroyed, that is, appeareth not  unto others, through the jeering of this lady, who draws to the like  action those who peradventure would see this piteousness. The second  part begins here, \"My face shows;\" the third, \"Till, in the drunken  terror;\" the fourth, \"It were a grievous sin;\" the fifth, \"For the  great anguish.\"_    Thereafter, this sonnet bred in me desire to write down in verse four  other things touching my condition, the which things it seemed to me  that I had not yet made manifest. The first among these was the grief  that possessed me very often, remembering the strangeness which Love  wrought in me; the second was, how Love many times assailed me so  suddenly and with such strength that I had no other life remaining  except a thought which spake of my lady; the third was, how, when Love  did battle with me in this wise, I would rise up all colourless, if  so I might see my lady, conceiving that the sight of her would defend  me against the assault of Love, and altogether forgetting that which  her presence brought unto me; and the fourth was, how, when I saw her,  the sight not only defended me not, but took away the little life that  remained to me. And I said these four things in a sonnet, which is  this:--        At whiles (yea oftentimes) I muse over        The quality of anguish that is mine        Through Love: then pity makes my voice to pine,      Saying, \"Is any else thus, anywhere?\"      Love smiteth me, whose strength is ill to bear;        So that of all my life is left no sign        Except one thought; and that, because 'tis thine,      Leaves not the body but abideth there.      And then if I, whom other aid forsook,        Would aid myself, and innocent of art          Would fain have sight of thee as a last hope,      No sooner do I lift mine eyes to look        Than the blood seems as shaken from my heart,          And all my pulses beat at once and stop.    _This sonnet is divided into four parts, four things being therein  narrated; and as these are set forth above, I only proceed to  distinguish the parts by their beginnings. Wherefore I say that the  second part begins, \"Love smiteth me;\" the third, \"And then if I;\" the  fourth, \"No sooner do I lift.\"_    After I had written these three last sonnets, wherein I spake unto  my lady, telling her almost the whole of my condition, it seemed to  me that I should be silent, having said enough concerning myself. But  albeit I spake not to her again, yet it behoved me afterward to write  of another matter, more noble than the foregoing. And for that the  occasion of what I then wrote may be found pleasant in the hearing, I  will relate it as briefly as I may.    Through the sore change in mine aspect, the secret of my heart was  now understood of many. Which thing being thus, there came a day when  certain ladies to whom it was well known (they having been with me  at divers times in my trouble) were met together for the pleasure of  gentle company. And as I was going that way by chance, (but I think  rather by the will of fortune,) I heard one of them call unto me, and  she that called was a lady of very sweet speech. And when I had come  close up with them, and perceived that they had not among them mine  excellent lady, I was reassured; and saluted them, asking of their  pleasure. The ladies were many; divers of whom were laughing one to  another, while divers gazed at me as though I should speak anon. But  when I still spake not, one of them, who before had been talking with  another, addressed me"]]]
