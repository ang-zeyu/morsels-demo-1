The sea serpent at once observed this opening and the head left the  roof of glass only to reappear presently at the round hole. Through  this he slowly crawled until his head was just beneath the throne of  Queen Aquareine, who said to him:    \"Good morning, your Majesty. I hope you are quite well?\"    \"Quite well, thank your Majesty,\" answered Anko; and then he turned  to the strangers. \"I suppose these are the earth folks you were  expecting?\"    \"Yes,\" returned the Queen. \"The girl is named Mayre and the man  Cap'n Bill.\"    While the sea serpent looked at the visitors, they ventured to look  at him. He certainly was a queer creature, yet Trot decided he was  not at all frightful. His head was round as a ball, but his ears  were sharp-pointed and had tassels at the ends of them. His nose was  flat, and his mouth very wide indeed, but his eyes were blue and  gentle in expression. The white, stubby hairs that surrounded his  face were not thick like a beard, but scattered and scraggly. From  the head, the long, brown body of the sea serpent extended to the  hole in the coral wall, which was just big enough to admit it; and  how much more of the body remained outside the child could not tell.  On the back of the body were several fins, which made the creature  look more like an eel than a serpent.    \"The girl is young and the man is old,\" said King Anko in a soft  voice. \"But I'm quite sure Cap'n Bill isn't as old as I am.\"    \"How old are you?\" asked the sailor.    \"I can't say exactly. I can remember several thousands of years  back, but beyond that my memory fails me. How's your memory, Cap'n  Bill?\"    \"You've got me beat,\" was the reply. \"I'll give in that you're older  than I am.\"    This seemed to please the sea serpent. \"Are you well?\" he asked.    \"Pretty fair,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"How's yourself?\"    \"Oh, I'm very well, thank you,\" answered Anko. \"I never remember to  have had a pain but three times in my life. The last time was when  Julius Sneezer was on earth.\"    \"You mean Julius Caesar,\" said Trot, correcting him.    \"No, I mean Julius Sneezer,\" insisted the Sea Serpent. \"That was his  real name--Sneezer. They called him Caesar sometimes just because he  took everything he could lay hands on. I ought to know, because I  saw him when he was alive. Did you see him when he was alive, Cap'n  Bill?\"    \"I reckon not,\" admitted the sailor.    \"That time I had a toothache,\" continued Anko, \"but I got a lobster  to pull the tooth with his claw, so the pain was soon over.\"    \"Did it hurt to pull it?\" asked Trot.    \"Hurt!\" exclaimed the Sea Serpent, groaning at the recollection. \"My  dear, those creatures have been called lobsters ever since! The  second pain I had way back in the time of Nevercouldnever.\"    \"Oh, I s'pose you mean Nebuchadnezzar,\" said Trot.    \"Do you call him that now?\" asked the Sea Serpent as if surprised.  \"He used to be called Nevercouldnever when he was alive, but this  new way of spelling seems to get everything mixed up. Nebuchadnezzar  doesn't mean anything at all, it seems to me.\"    \"It means he ate grass,\" said the child.    \"Oh no, he didn't,\" declared the Sea Serpent. \"He was the first to  discover that lettuce was good to eat, and he became very fond of  it. The people may have called it grass, but they were wrong. I  ought to know, because I was alive when Nevercouldnever lived. Were  you alive, then?\"    \"No,\" said Trot.    \"The pain I had then,\" remarked Anko, \"was caused by a kink in my  tail about three hundred feet from the end. There was an old octopus  who did not like me, and so he tied a knot in my tail when I wasn't  looking.\"    \"What did you do?\" asked Cap'n Bill.    \"Well, first I transformed the octopus into a jellyfish, and then I  waited for the tide to turn. When my tail was untied, the pain  stopped.\"    \"I--I don't understand that,\" said Trot, somewhat bewildered.    \"Thank you, my dear,\" replied the Sea Serpent in a grateful voice.  \"People who are always understood are very common. You are sure to  respect those you can't understand, for you feel that perhaps they  know more than you do.\"    \"About how long do you happen to be?\" inquired Cap'n Bill.    \"When last measured, I was seven thousand four hundred and  eighty-two feet, five inches and a quarter. I'm not sure about the  quarter, but the rest is probably correct. Adam measured me when  Cain was a baby.\"    \"Where's the rest of you, then?\" asked Trot.    \"Safe at home, I hope, and coiled up in my parlor,\" answered the Sea  Serpent. \"When I go out, I usually take along only what is needed.  It saves a lot of bother and I can always find my way back in the  darkest night by just coiling up the part that has been away.\"    \"Do you like to be a sea serpent?\" inquired the child.    \"Yes, for I'm King of my Ocean, and there is no other sea serpent to  imagine he is just as good as I am. I have two brothers who live in  other oceans, but one is seven inches shorter than I am, and the  other several feet shorter. It's curious to talk about feet when we  haven't any feet, isn't it?\"    \"Seems so,\" acknowledged Trot.    \"I feel I have much to be proud of,\" continued Anko in a dreamy  tone. \"My great age, my undisputed sway, and my exceptional length.\"    \"I don't b'lieve I'd care to live so long,\" remarked Cap'n Bill  thoughtfully.    \"So long as seven thousand four hundred and eighty-two feet, five  inches and a quarter?\" asked the Sea Serpent.    \"No, I mean so many years,\" replied the sailor.    \"But what can one do if one happens to be a sea serpent?\" Anko  inquired. \"There is nothing in the sea that can hurt me, and I  cannot commit suicide because we have no carbolic acid or firearms  or gas to turn on. So it isn't a matter of choice, and I'd about as  soon be alive as dead. It does not seem quite so monotonous, you  know. But I guess I've stayed about long enough, so I'll go home to  dinner. Come and see me when you have time.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Trot, and Merla added, \"I'll take you over to his  majesty's palace when we go out and let you see how he lives.\"    \"Yes, do,\" said Anko. And then he slowly slid out of the hole, which  immediately closed behind him, leaving the coral wall as solid as  before.    \"Oh!\" exclaimed Trot. \"King Anko forgot to tell us what his third  pain was about.\"    \"So he did,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"We must ask him about that when we  see him. But I guess the ol' boy's mem'ry is failin', an' he can't  be depended on for pertic'lars.\"          CHAPTER 6    EXPLORING THE OCEAN      The queen now requested her guests to recline upon couches that they  might rest themselves from their long swim and talk more at their  ease. So the girl and the sailor allowed themselves to float  downward until they rested their bodies on two of the couches  nearest the throne, which were willingly vacated for them by the  mermaids who occupied them until then.    The visitors soon found themselves answering a great many questions  about their life on the earth, for although the queen had said she  kept track of what was going on on the land, there were many details  of human life in which all the mermaids seemed greatly interested.    During the conversation several sea-maids came swimming into the  room bearing trays of sea apples and other fruit, which they first  offered to the queen, and then passed the refreshments around to the  company assembled. Trot and Cap'n Bill each took some, and the  little girl found the fruits delicious to eat, as they had a richer  flavor than any that grew upon land. Queen Aquareine was much  pleased when the old sailor asked for more, but Merla warned him  dinner would soon be served and he must take care not to spoil his  appetite for that meal. \"Our dinner is at noon, for we have to cook  in the middle of the day when the sun is shining,\" she said.    \"Cook!\" cried Trot. \"Why, you can't build a fire in the water, can  you?\"    \"We have no need of fires,\" was the reply. \"The glass roof of our  kitchen is so curved that it concentrates the heat of the sun's  rays, which are then hot enough to cook anything we wish.\"    \"But how do you get along if the day is cloudy, and the sun doesn't  shine?\" inquired the little girl.    \"Then we use the hot springs that bubble up in another part of the  palace,\" Merla answered. \"But the sun is the best to cook by.\" So it  was no surprise to Trot when, about noon, dinner was announced and  all the mermaids, headed by their queen and their guests, swam into  another spacious room where a great, long table was laid. The dishes  were of polished gold and dainty-cut glass, and the cloth and  napkins of fine gossamer. Around the table were ranged rows of  couches for the mermaids to recline upon as they ate. Only the  nobility and favorites of Queen Aquareine were invited to partake of  this repast, for Clia explained that tables were set for the other  mermaids in different parts of the numerous palaces.    Trot wondered who would serve the meal, but her curiosity was soon  satisfied when several large lobsters came sliding into the room  backward, bearing in their claws trays loaded with food. Each of  these lobsters had a golden band behind its neck to show it was the  slave of the mermaids.    These curious waiters were fussy creatures, and Trot found much  amusement in watching their odd motions. They were so spry and  excitable that at times they ran against one another and upset the  platters of food, after which they began to scold and argue as to  whose fault it was, until one of the mermaids quietly rebuked them  and asked them to be more quiet and more careful.    The queen's guests had no cause to complain of the dinner provided.  First the lobsters served bowls of turtle soup, which proved hot and  deliciously flavored. Then came salmon steaks fried in fish oil,  with a fungus bread that tasted much like field mushrooms.

Having seen the terrible effect of the  electric tube they wisely fell back and allowed the boy to pass.    He marched through their lines with a fine air of dignity, although he  was fearful lest some of the blacks should stick a spear into him or  bump his head with a war-club.  But they were awed by the wonders they  had seen and were still inclined to believe him a god, so he was not  molested.    When he found himself outside the village he made for the high plateau  in the center of the island, where he could be safe from the cannibals  while he collected his thoughts.  But when he reached the place he  found the sides so steep he could not climb them, so he adjusted the  indicator to the word \"up\" and found it had still had enough power to  support his body while he clambered up the rocks to the level,  grass-covered space at the top.    Then, reclining upon his back, he gave himself up to thoughts of how he  might escape from his unpleasant predicament.    \"Here I am, on a cannibal island, hundreds of miles from civilization,  with no way to get back,\" he reflected.  \"The family will look for me  every day, and finally decide I've broken my neck.  The Demon will call  upon me when the week is up and won't find me at home; so I'll miss the  next three gifts.  I don't mind that so much, for they might bring me  into worst scrapes than this.  But how am I to get away from this  beastly island?  I'll be eaten, after all, if I don't look out!\"    These and similar thoughts occupied him for some time, yet in spite of  much planning and thinking he could find no practical means of escape.    At the end of an hour he looked over the edge of the plateau and found  it surrounded by a ring of the black cannibals, who had calmly seated  themselves to watch his movements.    \"Perhaps they intend to starve me into surrender,\" he thought; \"but  they won't succeed so long as my tablets hold out.  And if, in time,  they should starve me, I'll be too thin and tough to make good eating;  so I'll get the best of them, anyhow.\"    Then he again lay down and began to examine his electrical traveling  machine.  He did not dare take it apart, fearing he might not be able  to get it together again, for he knew nothing at all about its  construction.  But he discovered two little dents on the edge, one on  each side, which had evidently been caused by the pressure of the rope.    \"If I could get those dents out,\" he thought, \"the machine might work.\"    He first tried to pry out the edges with his pocket knife, but the  attempt resulted in failure,  Then, as the sides seemed a little bulged  outward by the dents, he placed the machine between two flat stones and  pressed them together until the little instrument was nearly round  again.  The dents remained, to be sure, but he hoped he had removed the  pressure upon the works.    There was just one way to discover how well he had succeeded, so he  fastened the machine to his wrist and turned the indicator to the word  \"up.\"    Slowly he ascended, this time to a height of nearly twenty feet.  Then  his progress became slower and finally ceased altogether.    \"That's a little better,\" he thought.  \"Now let's see if it will go  sidewise.\"    He put the indicator to \"north-west,\"--the direction of home--and very  slowly the machine obeyed and carried him away from the plateau and  across the island.    The natives saw him go, and springing to their feet began uttering  excited shouts and throwing their spears at him.  But he was already so  high and so far away that they failed to reach him, and the boy  continued his journey unharmed.    Once the branches of a tall tree caught him and nearly tipped him over;  but he managed to escape others by drawing up his feet.  At last he was  free of the island and traveling over the ocean again.  He was not at  all sorry to bid good-by to the cannibal island, but he was worried  about the machine, which clearly was not in good working order.  The  vast ocean was beneath him, and he moved no faster than an ordinary  walk.    \"At this rate I'll get home some time next year,\"  he grumbled.  \"However, I suppose I ought to be glad the machine works at all.\"  And  he really was glad.    All the afternoon and all the long summer night he moved slowly over  the water.  It was annoying to go at \"a reg'lar jog-trot,\" as Rob  called it, after his former swift flight; but there was no help for it.    Just as dawn was breaking he saw in the distance a small vessel,  sailing in the direction he was following, yet scarcely moving for lack  of wind.  He soon caught up with it, but saw no one on deck, and the  craft had a dingy and uncared-for appearance that was not reassuring.  But after hovering over it for some time Rob decided to board the ship  and rest for a while.  He alighted near the bow, where the deck was  highest, and was about to explore the place when a man came out of the  low cabin and espied him.    This person had a most villainous countenance, and was dark-skinned,  black-bearded and dressed in an outlandish, piratical costume.  On  seeing the boy he gave a loud shout and was immediately joined by four  companions, each as disagreeable in appearance as the first.    Rob knew there would be trouble the moment he looked at this evil crew,  and when they drew their daggers and pistols and began fiercely  shouting in an unknown tongue, the boy sighed and took the electric  tube from his coat pocket.    The buccaneers did not notice the movement, but rushed upon him so  quickly that he had to press the button at a lively rate.  The tube  made no noise at all, so it was a strange and remarkable sight to see  the pirates suddenly drop to the deck and lie motionless.  Indeed, one  was so nearly upon him when the electric current struck him that his  head, in falling, bumped into Rob's stomach and sent him reeling  against the side of the vessel.    He quickly recovered himself, and seeing his enemies were rendered  harmless, the boy entered the cabin and examined it curiously.  It was  dirty and ill-smelling enough, but the corners and spare berths were  heaped with merchandise of all kinds which had been taken from those so  unlucky as to have met these cruel and desperate men.    After a short inspection of the place he returned to the deck and again  seated himself in the bow.    The crippled condition of his traveling machine was now his chief  trouble, and although a good breeze had sprung up to fill the sails and  the little bark was making fair headway, Rob knew he could never expect  to reach home unless he could discover a better mode of conveyance than  this.    He unstrapped the machine from his wrist to examine it better, and  while holding it carelessly in his hand it slipped and fell with a bang  to the deck, striking upon its round edge and rolling quickly past the  cabin and out of sight.  With a cry of alarm he ran after it, and after  much search found it lying against the bulwark near the edge of a  scupper hole, where the least jar of the ship would have sent it to the  bottom of the ocean.  Rob hastily seized his treasure and upon  examining it found the fall had bulged the rim so that the old dents  scarcely showed at all.  But its original shape was more distorted than  ever, and Rob feared he had utterly ruined its delicate mechanism.  Should this prove to be true, he might now consider himself a prisoner  of this piratical band, the members of which, although temporarily  disabled, would soon regain consciousness.    He sat in the bow, sadly thinking of his misfortunes, until he noticed  that one of the men began to stir.  The effect of the electric shock  conveyed by the tube was beginning to wear away, and now the buccaneer  sat up, rubbed his head in a bewildered fashion and looked around him.  When he saw Rob he gave a shout of rage and drew his knife, but one  motion of the electric tube made him cringe and slip away to the cabin,  where he remained out of danger.    And now the other four sat up, groaning and muttering in their  outlandish speech;  But they had no notion of facing Rob's tube a  second time, so one by one they joined their leader in the cabin,  leaving the boy undisturbed.    By this time the ship had begun to pitch and toss in an uncomfortable  fashion, and Rob noticed that the breeze had increased to a gale.  There being no one to look after the sails, the vessel was in grave  danger of capsizing or breaking her masts.  The waves were now running  high, too, and Rob began to be worried.    Presently the captain of the pirates stuck his head out of the cabin  door, jabbered some unintelligible words and pointed to the sails.  The  boy nodded, for he understood they wanted to attend to the rigging.  So  the crew trooped forth, rather fearfully, and began to reef the sails  and put the ship into condition to weather the storm.    Rob paid no further attention to them.  He looked at his traveling  machine rather doubtfully and wondered if he dared risk its power to  carry him through the air.  Whether he remained in the ship or trusted  to the machine, he stood a good chance of dropping into the sea at any  moment.  So, while he hesitated, he attached the machine to his wrist  and leaned over the bulwarks to watch the progress of the storm.  He  might stay in the ship until it foundered, he thought, and then take  his chances with the machine.  He decided to wait until a climax  arrived.    The climax came the next moment, for while he leaned over the bulwarks  the buccaneers stole up behind him and suddenly seized him in their  grasp.  While two of them held his arms the others searched his"]]]
