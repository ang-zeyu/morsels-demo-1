Through the smoke, his eyes could be seen slowly  widening.    \"But about this villa,\" said Jimmy. \"I am always interested even in  the humblest sides of the profession. Now, tell me, supposing you  were going to break into a villa, what time of night would you do  it?\"    \"I always t'inks it's best either late like dis or when de folks is  in at supper,\" said Spike, respectfully.    Jimmy smiled a faint, patronizing smile, and nodded.    \"Well, and what would you do?\"    \"I'd rubber around some to see isn't dere a window open somewheres,\"  said Spike, diffidently.    \"And if there wasn't?\"    \"I'd climb up de porch an' into one of de bedrooms,\" said Spike,  almost blushing. He felt like a boy reading his first attempts at  original poetry to an established critic. What would this master  cracksman, this polished wielder of the oxy-acetylene blow-pipe,  this expert in toxicology, microscopy and physics think of his  callow outpourings!    \"How would you get into the bedroom?\"    Spike hung his head.    \"Bust de catch wit' me jemmy,\" he whispered, shamefacedly.    \"Burst the catch with your jemmy?\"    \"It's de only way I ever learned,\" pleaded Spike.    The expert was silent. He seemed to be thinking. The other watched  his face, humbly.    \"How would youse do it, boss?\" he ventured timidly, at last.    \"Eh?\"    \"How would youse do it?\"    \"Why, I'm not sure,\" said the master, graciously, \"whether your way  might not do in a case like that. It's crude, of course, but with a  few changes it would do.\"    \"Gee, boss! Is dat right?\" queried the astonished disciple.    \"It would do,\" said the master, frowning thoughtfully; \"it would do  quite well--quite well!\"    Spike drew a deep breath of joy and astonishment. That his methods  should meet with approval from such a mind...!    \"Gee!\" he whispered--as who would say, \"I and Napoleon.\"          CHAPTER VI    AN EXHIBITION PERFORMANCE      Cold reason may disapprove of wagers, but without a doubt there is  something joyous and lovable in the type of mind that rushes at the  least provocation into the making of them, something smacking of the  spacious days of the Regency. Nowadays, the spirit seems to have  deserted England. When Mr. Asquith became Premier of Great Britain,  no earnest forms were to be observed rolling peanuts along the  Strand with a toothpick. When Mr. Asquith is dethroned, it is  improbable that any Briton will allow his beard to remain unshaved  until the Liberal party returns to office. It is in the United  States that the wager has found a home. It is characteristic of some  minds to dash into a wager with the fearlessness of a soldier in a  forlorn hope, and, once in, to regard it almost as a sacred trust.  Some men never grow up out of the schoolboy spirit of \"daring.\"    To this class Jimmy Pitt belonged. He was of the same type as the  man in the comic opera who proposed to the lady because somebody bet  him he wouldn't. There had never been a time when a challenge, a  \"dare,\" had not acted as a spur to him. In his newspaper days, life  had been one long series of challenges. They had been the essence of  the business. A story had not been worth getting unless the getting  were difficult.    With the conclusion of his newspaper life came a certain flatness  into the scheme of things. There were times, many times, when Jimmy  was bored. He hungered for excitement, and life appeared to have so  little to offer! The path of the rich man was so smooth, and it  seemed to lead nowhere! This task of burgling a house was like an  unexpected treat to a child. With an intensity of purpose that  should have touched his sense of humor, but, as a matter of fact,  did not appeal to him as ludicrous in any way, he addressed himself  to the work. The truth was that Jimmy was one of those men who are  charged to the brim with force. Somehow, the force had to find an  outlet. If he had undertaken to collect birds' eggs, he would have  set about it with the same tense energy.    Spike was sitting on the edge of his chair, dazed but happy, his  head still buzzing from the unhoped-for praise. Jimmy looked at his  watch. It was nearly three o'clock. A sudden idea struck him. The  gods had provided gifts: why not take them?    \"Spike!\"    \"Huh?\"    \"Would you care to come and crack a crib with me, now?\"    Reverential awe was written on the red-haired one's face.    \"Gee, boss!\"    \"Would you?\"    \"Surest t'ing you know, boss.\"    \"Or, rather,\" proceeded Jimmy, \"would you care to crack a crib while  I came along with you? Strictly speaking, I am here on a vacation,  but a trifle like this isn't real work. It's this way,\" he  explained. \"I've taken a fancy to you, Spike, and I don't like to  see you wasting your time on coarse work. You have the root of the  matter in you, and with a little coaching I could put a polish on  you. I wouldn't do this for everyone, but I hate to see a man  bungling who might do better! I want to see you at work. Come right  along, and we'll go up-town, and you shall start in. Don't get  nervous. Just work as you would if I were not there. I shall not  expect too much. Rome was not built in a day. When we are through, I  will criticize a few of your mistakes. How does that suit you?\"    \"Gee, boss! Great! An' I know where dere's a peach of a place, boss.  Regular soft proposition. A friend of mine told me. It's--\"    \"Very well, then. One moment, though.\"    He went to the telephone. Before he had left New York on his  travels, Arthur Mifflin had been living at a hotel near Washington  Square. It was probable that he was still there. He called up the  number. The night-clerk was an old acquaintance of his.    \"Hello, Dixon,\" said Jimmy, \"is that you? I'm Pitt--Pitt! Yes, I'm  back. How did you guess? Yes, very pleasant. Has Mr. Mifflin come in  yet? Gone to bed? Never mind, call him up, will you? Good.\"  Presently, the sleepy and outraged voice of Mr. Mifflin spoke at the  other end of the line.    \"What's wrong? Who the devil's that?\"    \"My dear Arthur! Where you pick up such expressions I can't think--not  from me.\"    \"Is that you, Jimmy? What in the name of--!\"    \"Heavens! What are you kicking about? The night's yet young. Arthur,  touching that little arrangement we made--cracking that crib, you  know. Are you listening? Have you any objection to my taking an  assistant along with me? I don't want to do anything contrary to our  agreement, but there's a young fellow here who's anxious that I  should let him come along and pick up a few hints. He's a  professional all right. Not in our class, of course, but quite a  fair rough workman. He--Arthur! Arthur! These are harsh words! Then,  am I to understand you have no objection? Very well. Only, don't say  later on that I didn't play fair. Good-night.\"    He hung up the receiver, and turned to Spike.    \"Ready?\"    \"Ain't youse goin' to put on your gum-shoes, boss?\"    Jimmy frowned reflectively, as if there was something in what this  novice suggested. He went into the bedroom, and returned wearing a  pair of thin patent-leather shoes.    Spike coughed tentatively.    \"Won't youse need your gun?\" he hazarded.  Jimmy gave a short laugh.    \"I work with brains, not guns,\" he said. \"Let us be going.\"    There was a taxi-cab near by, as there always is in New York. Jimmy  pushed Spike in, and they drove off. To Jimmy, New York stopped  somewhere about Seventy-Second Street. Anything beyond that was  getting on for the Middle West, and seemed admirably suited as a  field for the cracksman. He had a vague idea of up-town as a remote,  desolate district, badly lighted--if lighted at all--and sparsely  dotted with sleepy policemen.    The luxury of riding in a taxi-cab kept Spike dumb for several  miles. Having arrived at what seemed a sufficiently remote part of  America, Jimmy paid the driver, who took the money with that  magnificently aloof air which characterizes the taxi-chauffeur. A  lesser man might have displayed some curiosity about the ill-matched  pair. The chauffeur, having lighted a cigarette, drove off without  any display of interest whatsoever. It might have been part of  his ordinary duties to drive gentlemen in evening clothes and  shock-headed youths in parti-colored sweaters about the city at three  o'clock in the morning.    \"We will now,\" said Jimmy, \"stroll on and prospect. It is up to you,  Spike. Didn't you say something about knowing a suitable house  somewhere? Are we anywhere near it?\"    Spike looked at the number of the street.    \"We got some way to go, boss,\" he said. \"I wisht youse hadn't sent  away de cab.\"    \"Did you think we were going to drive up to the door? Pull yourself  together, my dear man.\"    They walked on, striking eastward out of Broadway. It caused Jimmy  some surprise to find that the much-enduring thoroughfare extended  as far as this. It had never occurred to him before to ascertain  what Broadway did with itself beyond Times Square.    It was darker now that they had moved from the center of things, but  it was still far too light for Jimmy's tastes. He was content,  however, to leave matters entirely to his companion. Spike probably  had his methods for evading publicity on these occasions.    Spike plodded on. Block after block he passed, until finally the  houses began to be more scattered.    At last, he halted before a fair-sized detached house.    \"Dis is de place,\" he said. \"A friend of mine tells me of it. I  didn't know he was me friend, dough, before he puts me wise about  dis joint. I t'ought he'd got it "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40780"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage: King AEthelbert - King George III, 600 A.D. - 1776 (#6)"],[1,". The wealthy ate  wheat bread and others ate barley bread. Ale made from barley was  passed around in a cup. Mead made from honey was also drunk.            Men wore long-sleeved wool and linen garments reaching almost  to the knee, around which they wore a belt tied in a knot. Men often  wore a gold ring on the fourth finger of the right hand. Leather shoes  were fastened with leather thongs around the ankle. Their hair was  parted in the middle and combed down each side in waving ringlets. The  beard was parted in the middle of the chin, so that it ended in two  points. The clergy did not wear beards. Great men wore gold-embroidered  clothes, gilt buckles and brooches, and drank from drinking horns  mounted in silver gilt or in gold. Well- to-do women wore brightly  colored robes with waist bands, headbands, necklaces, gem bracelets,  and rings. Their long hair was in ringlets and they put rouge on their  cheeks. They had beads, pins, needles, tweezers of bronze, and  workboxes of bronze, some highly ornamented. They were often doing  needlework. Silk was affordable only by the wealthy.            Most families kept a pig and pork was the primary meat. There  were also sheep, goats, cows, deer, hare, and fowl. Fowl was obtained  by fowlers who trapped them. The inland waters yielded eels, salmon,  and trout. In the fall, meat was salted to preserve it for winter  meals. There were orchards growing figs, nuts, grapes, almonds, pears,  and apples. Also produced were beans, lentils, onions, eggs, cheese,  and butter. Pepper and cinnamon were imported.            Fishing from the sea yielded herrings, sturgeon, porpoise,  oysters, crabs, and other fish. Sometimes a whale was driven into an  inlet by a group of boats. Whale skins were used to make ropes.            The roads were not much more than trails. They were often so  narrow that two pack horses could hardly pass each other. The pack  horses each carried two bales or two baskets slung over their backs,  which balanced each other. The soft soil was compacted into a deep  ditch which rains, floods, and tides, if near the sea, soon turned into  a river. Traveling a far distance was unsafe as there were robbers on  the roads. Traveling strangers were distrusted. It was usual to wash  one's feet in a hot tub after traveling and to dry them with a rough  wool cloth.            There were superstitions about the content of dreams, the  events of the moon, and the flights and voices of birds were often seen  as signs or omens of future events. Herbal mixtures were drunk for  sickness and maladies. From the witch hazel plant was made a mild  alcoholic astringent, which was probably used to clean cuts and sooth  abrasions.            In the peaceful latter part of the 600s, Theodore, who had been  a monk in Rome, was appointed archbishop and visited all the island  speaking about the right rule of life and ordaining bishops to oversee  the priests. Each kingdom was split up into dioceses each with one  bishop. Thereafter, bishops were selected by the king and his witan,  usually after consulting the clergy and even the people of the diocese.  The bishops came to be the most permanent element of society. They had  their sees in villages or rural monasteries. The bishops came to have  the same wergeld as an eorldorman: 1200s., which was the price of about  500 oxen. A priest had the wergeld as a landholding farmer [thegn], or  300s. The bishops spoke Latin, but the priests of the local parishes  spoke English. Theodore was the first archbishop whom all the English  church obeyed. He taught sacred and secular literature, the books of  holy writ, ecclesiastical poetry, astronomy, arithmetic, and sacred  music. Theodore discouraged slavery by denying Christian burial to the  kidnapper and forbidding the sale of children over the age of seven. A  slave became entitled to two loaves a day and to his holydays. A slave  was allowed to buy his or his children's freedom. In 673, Theodore  started annual national ecclesiastical assemblies, for instance for the  witnessing of important actions. The bishops, some abbots, the king,  and the eorldormen were usually present. From them the people learned  the benefit of common national action. There were two archbishops: one  of Canterbury in the south and one of York in the north. They governed  the bishops and could meet with them to issue canons that would be  equally valid all over the land. A bishop's house contained some  clerks, priests, monks, and nun and was a retreat for the weary  missionary and a school for the young. The bishop had a deacon who  acted as a secretary and companion in travel, and sometimes as an  interpreter. Ink was made from the outer husks of walnuts steeped in  vinegar.            The learned ecclesiastical life flourished in monastic  communities, in which both monks and nuns lived. Hilda, a noble's  daughter, became the first nun in Northumbria and abbess of one of its  monasteries. There she taught justice, piety, chastity, peace, and  charity. Several monks taught there later became bishops. Kings and  princes often asked her advice. Many abbesses came to run monastic  communities; they were from royal families. Women, especially from  royal families, fled to monasteries to obtain shelter from unwanted  marriage or to avoid their husbands. Kings and eorldormen retired to  them.            Danish Vikings made several invasions in the 800s, so the witan  imposed a danegeld tax on land that was assessed on everyone every ten  to twenty years for maintaining forces sufficient to clear the British  seas of Danish pirates or to buy off the ravages of the Danish It was  1s. and later 2s. upon every hide of land, where a hide was probably  the amount of land which could support a family or household for a year  or as much land as could be tilled annually by a single plough. It was  stored in a strong box under the King's bed. King Alfred the Great, who  had lived for awhile in Rome, unified the country to defeat the  invaders. He established fortifications called \"burhs\", usually on hill  tops or other strategic locations on the borders to control the main  road and river routes into his realm. The burhs were seminal towns.  They were typically walled enclosures with towers and an outer ditch  and mound, instead of the hedge or fence enclosure of a tun. Inside  were several wooden thatched huts and a couple of churches, which were  lit by earthen oil lamps. The populace met at burhgemotes. The land  area protected by each burh became known as a \"shire\", which means a  share of a larger whole. The shire or local landowners were responsible  for repairing the burh fortifications. There were about thirty shires.            Alfred gathered together fighting men who were at his disposal,  which included eorldormen with their hearthbands (retinues of men each  of whom had chosen to swear to fight to the death for their eorldorman,  and some of whom were of high rank), the King's thegns, shire thegns  (local landholding farmers, who were required to bring fighting  equipment such as swords, helmets, chain mail, and horses), and  ordinary freemen, i.e. ceorls (who carried food, dug fortifications,  and sometimes fought). Since the King was compelled to call out the  whole population to arms, the distinction between the king's thegns  from other landholders disappeared. Some great lords organized men  under them, whom they provisioned. These vassals took a personal oath  to their lord \"on condition that he keep me as I am willing to deserve,  and fulfill all that was agreed on when I became his man, and chose his  will as mine.\" Alfred had a small navy of longships with 60 oars to  fight the Viking longships.            Alfred divided his army into two parts so that one half of the  men were fighting while the other half was at home sowing and  harvesting for those fighting. Thus, any small-scale independent  farming was supplanted by the open-field system, cultivation of common  land, more large private estates headed by a lord, and a more  stratified society in which the king and important families more  powerful and the peasants more curtailed. The witan became mere  witnesses. Many free coerls of the older days became bonded. The  village community tended to become a large private estate headed by a  lord. But the lord does not have the power to encroach upon the rights  of common that exist within the community.            In 886, a treaty between Alfred and the Vikings divided the  country along the war front and made the wergeld of every free farmer,  whether English or Viking, 200s. Men of higher rank were given a  wergeld of 4 1/2 marks of pure gold. A mark was probably a Viking  denomination and a mark of gold was equal to nine marks of silver in  later times and probably in this time. The word \"earl\" replaced the  word \"eorldormen\" and the word \"thegn\" replaced the word \"aetheling\"  after the Danish settlement. The ironed pleats of Viking clothing  indicated a high status of the wearer. The Vikings brought combs and  the practice of regular hair-combing to England.            King Alfred gave land with jurisdictional powers within its  boundaries such as the following: \"This is the bequest which King  Alfred make unequivocally to Shaftesbury, to the praise of God and St.  Mary and all the saints of God, for the benefit of my soul, namely a  hundred hides as they stand with their produce and their men, and my  daughter AEthelgifu to the convent along with the inheritance, since  she took the veil on account of bad health; and the jurisdiction to the  convent, which I myself possessed, namely obstruction and attacks on a  man's house and breach of protection. And the estates which I have  granted to the foundation are 40 hides at Donhead and Compton, 20 hides  at Handley and Gussage 10 hides at Tarrant, 15 hides at Iwerve and 15  hides at Fontmell.            The witnesses of this are Edward my son and "]]]
