The fact was, the pickets had been attacked and driven in, and the  enemy occupied the range which commanded the British troops. Presently  the early morning was humming with shot and shell, the Boers now having  brought four big guns and a pom-pom to bear on the unfortunate camp and  the bald plain that surrounded it. Valiantly the militiamen, raw and  unfledged warriors as they were, fought; long, bloody, and disastrous  hours passed, and they, falling thick as autumn leaves, continued to hold  out in a completely defenceless position till the plain was littered with  dead and wounded--more than eighty of them now lying in a trap from which  it was impossible to escape. Colonel Baird-Douglas,[1] wounded in four  places, fought like a lion, encouraging his men, and vowing to shoot the  first who should display a white flag. Then he dropped exhausted and  breathed his last. Finally 420 prisoners were taken, including the  following officers of the 4th Derbyshire Regiment:--         Captain J. Humber, Captain C. P. Piers, Captain A. M. W.       Mohun-Harris, Captain E. M. Wilmot, Captain R. C. Fenwick,       Captain and Adjutant R. Britten, Lieutenant P. C. Shepard,       Second-Lieutenant A. C. Hewitt, Second-Lieutenant J. L.       Heymann, Second-Lieutenant H. L. Napier, Second-Lieutenant H.       M. Milward, Second-Lieutenant J. H. W. Becke, Second-Lieutenant       J. H. Mathias, Second-Lieutenant H. S. Anderson,       Second-Lieutenant E. N. T. Collin, Hon. Lieutenant and       Quartermaster M. M'Guire. Among the killed       were:--Lieutenant-Colonel Baird-Douglas and Lieutenant Horley.       Among the wounded:--Colonel Wilkinson, Captain Bailey,       Second-Lieutenants Hall and Lawder, Lieutenant Blanchard,       Canadian Infantry (attached to 4th Derbyshire).    It was said that after the capture the commandants, on bringing the  prisoners to the station, were seen cordially shaking hands with a  railway official as though exchanging congratulations. This circumstance  was one of many which bore witness to the innumerable acts of treachery  and duplicity with which commanding officers had to contend.    [Illustration:    Colour-Sergeant. Sergeant-Major.    THE GRENADIER GUARDS.    Photo by Gregory & Co., London.]    On the same day, in the same locality, there was another engagement,  which resulted in the capture of a number of the Railway Pioneer Corps.  According to an account in the _Bloemfontein Post_, the corps was  awakened at 5.26 in the morning by an unusual stir among the sentries. A  moment afterwards a voice was heard asking, \"Can any one speak Dutch?\" A  man, evidently a burgher, approached Captain Grant McDonnel and  Lieutenants Blanchard and Hayes with a note from the Boer commandant in  the vicinity, stating that he had 1200 men and five guns with him, and  adding that he would give the British force ten minutes in which to  surrender. The bearer, after delivering the note, went back to a large  body of Boers mounted on horses, who had by this time approached so close  as to be plainly visible.    The Pioneer Corps, realising their dangerous position, endeavoured  hastily to improvise a barricade with a number of railway trucks, and  also requisitioned a large quantity of biscuit and meat tins for the  purpose. The orders of Captain Gale were speedily carried out, and soon  his little force, numbering 160, were completely sheltered behind the  barricade. The Boers, after waiting the specified ten minutes, and  perceiving the efforts of the British to offer resistance, immediately  opened fire, pouring volley after volley on the force. Captain Gale and  two pioneers fell from the rifle fire, while shrapnel shells bursting  near killed three men. The enemy then directed their heavy artillery on  the barricades and station buildings, the latter being practically  destroyed. The Boers were now only fourteen hundred yards away, and well  hidden. An endeavour was made to have the wounded conveyed to safety  behind a large tank, but a shell from the Boer guns exploded among the  horses and the animals stampeded.    Firing from heavy guns was afterwards heard coming from the opposite  direction to the Boers. Hopes were high among the gallant force that  relief was at last arriving from Kroonstad. The pioneers, however, soon  became too painfully aware that the firing came from another body of the  enemy, who had surrounded the 4th Derbyshire Regiment the same morning.  Although the firing continued, an outlying patrol attempted to reach the  pioneers. The whole of the Boer guns were now worked with increased  energy, and soon the want of ammunition compelled the British force to  surrender. The report then went on to say that Commandant De Wet, mounted  on an English charger, advanced and asked the number of British killed.  Looking at the dead body of Captain Gale, the Boer commandant remarked  sympathetically, \"Poor man. Very sad. Bury him at once.\" He also  courteously allowed the body to be wrapped in a Union Jack. De Wet is a  tall, heavily built man, with a brown beard. He wore a tweed suit and an  overcoat, and carried a rifle and bandolier. Attached to his gold chain  was a medal, on which was a representation of Kruger's head. De Wet was  very polite to his captives, and kindly expressed his sorrow at having  to destroy two thousand bags of mails. Unless he did so, he added, the  young Boers would open the letters.    The bags were afterwards ripped open, and the Boers looted the baggage.  One burgher found a number of bank notes as part of his spoil, while  others obtained tobacco, cigars, and various medical comforts. Lieutenant  Thurston, Cape Pioneer Railway Regiment, and Lieutenant Staffkett, Cape  Pioneer Railway Regiment, were made prisoners. Some of the prisoners were  called together and made to take off parts of their dress, which the  Boers then donned. The British wounded were well attended to, and were  subsequently removed to the Yeomanry Hospital at Kroonstad.    As a consequence of these attacks De Wet obtained possession of the line,  which became so twisted and uptorn as to resemble unfinished Jacob's  ladders to heaven, while Pretoria found itself minus its longed-for home  letters, and standing hourly in fear of running short of food. Still  affairs were going on as though nothing had happened. The Town Council  temporarily continued its duties. An English Burgomaster was chosen, and  a new Court of Justice was established. Colonel Maxse became the head of  the police, and many Colonials who volunteered for civil employment were  given posts of importance. Owing to the many acts of duplicity practised  by the Boers who had surrendered, more stringent regulations regarding  oath-breakers were promulgated. The publication of malicious and false  reports was forbidden, and a sharp look-out was kept over the movements  of the spies with which the capital was still swarming.    One hundred and forty-eight officers, and 3039 men were released, and  these were rearmed from the 2000 stands of arms which were given up in  Pretoria on and after the British occupation. The list of the officers  who had been suffering imprisonment at the hands of the Boers is a long  one, and dates almost from the outset of the war:--         18th Hussars--Lieutenant-Colonel B. D.

Yes, he  had done right. She had recovered herself in time, but she had taken a  little bit of life from the colonel, and from him. She had broken his  ideal--the ideal he had always hoped for, and had sought for, but had  never found, and he told himself that now she was no better than the  girl of the hyacinth letter, whose golden beauty and eyes as clear as an  angel's had concealed this same deceit that wrecked men's lives. M'sieur  Janette's clean, white skull and the story of how and why M'sieur  Janette had died would not be too great a punishment for her.    He resumed his journey, striving to concentrate his mind on other  things. Seven or eight miles to the south and west was the cabin of  Jacques Pierrot, a half-breed, who had a sledge and dogs. He would hire  Jacques to accompany him on his patrol in place of Bucky Nome. Then  he would return to Nelson House and send in his report of Bucky Nome's  desertion, since he knew well enough after the final remarks of that  gentleman that he did not intend to sever his connection with the  Northwest Mounted in the regular way. After that--He shrugged his  shoulders as he thought of the fourteen months' of service still ahead  of him. Until now his adventure as a member of the Royal Mounted had not  grown monotonous for an hour. Excitement, action, fighting against odds,  had been the spice of life to him, and he struggled to throw off  the change that had taken hold of him the moment he had opened the  hyacinth-scented letter of Mrs. Becker. \"You're a fool,\" he argued.  \"You're as big a fool as Bucky Nome. My God--you--Phil Steele--letting a  married woman upset you like this!\"    It was near midnight when he came to Pierrot's cabin, but a light was  still burning in the half-breed's log home. Philip kicked off his snow  shoes and knocked at the door. In a moment Pierrot opened it, stepped  back, and stared at the white figure that came in out of the storm.    \"Mon Dieu--it ees you--Mee-sair Philip!\"    Philip held out his hand to Jacques, and shot a quick glance about him.  There had been a change in the cabin since he had visited it last. One  of Pierrot's hands was done up in a sling, his face was thin and pale,  and his dark eyes were sunken and lusterless. In the little wilderness  home there was an air of desertion and neglect, and Philip wondered  where Pierrot's rosy-cheeked, black-haired wife and his half dozen  children had gone.    \"Mon Dieu--it ees you, Mee-sair Philip,\" cried Pierrot again, his face  lighting up with pleasure. \"You come late. You are hongree?\"    \"I've had supper,\" replied Philip. \"I've just come from Lac Bain.  But what's up, old man--?\" He pointed to Pierrot's hand, and looked  questionably about the cabin again.    \"Eh--Iowla--my wife--she is at Churchill, over on the bay,\" groaned  Jacques. \"And so are the children. What! You did not hear at Lac Bain?  Iowla is taken seek--ver' seek--with a strange thing which--ugh!--has to  be fixed with a knife, Mee-sair Philip. An' so I take her to the doctor  over at Churchill, an' he fix her--an' she is growing well now, an' will  soon come home. She keep the children with her. She say they mak'  her think of Jacques, on his trap-line. Eh--it ees lonely--dam'--dam'  lonely, and I have been gone from my Iowla but two weeks to-morrow.\"    \"You have been with her at Fort Churchill?\" asked Philip, taking off his  pack and coat.    \"Oui, M'sieur,\" said Jacques, falling into his French. \"I have been  there since November. What! They did not tell you at Lac Bain?\"    \"No--they did not tell me. But I was there but a few hours, Jacques.  Listen--\" He pulled out his pipe and began filling it, with his back to  the stove. \"You saw people--strangers--at Fort Churchill, Jacques? They  came over on the London ship, and among them there was a woman--\"    Pierrot's pale face flashed up with sudden animation.    \"Ah--zee angel!\" he cried. \"That is what my Iowla called her, M'sieur.  See!\" He pointed to his bandaged hand. \"Wan day that bete--the Indian  dog of mine--did that, an' w'en I jumped up from the snow in front  of the company's store, the blood running from me, I see her standing  there, white an' scared. An' then she run to me with a little scream,  an' tear something from her neck, an' tie it round my hand. Then she go  with me to my cabin, and every day after that she come to see my Iowla  an' the children. She wash little Pierre, an' cut his hair. She wash  Jean an' Mabelle. She laugh an' sing an' hol' the baby, an' my Iowla  laugh an' sing; an' she takes down my Iowla's hair, which is so long  that it falls to her knees, an' does it up in a wonderful way an' says  she would give everything she got if she could have that hair. An' my  Iowla laugh at her, because her hair is like an angel's--like fire w'en  the sun is on it; an' my Iowla tak' hers down, all red an' gold, an' do  it up in the Cree way. And w'en she brings the man with her--he laughs  an' plays with the kids, an' says he knows the doctor and that there  will be nothing to pay for all that he is done. Ah--she ees wan  be-e-eautiful-l-l angel! An' this--this is w'at she tied around my  hand.\"    With new life Pierrot went to a covered box nailed against one of the  log walls and a moment later placed in Philip's hands a long, white,  silken neck-scarf. Once more there rose to his nostrils the sweet, faint  scent of hyacinth, and with a sudden low cry Philip crushed the dainty  fabric in a mass to his face. In that moment it seemed as though the  sweetness of the woman herself was with him, stirring him at last to  confess the truth--the thing which he had fought against so fiercely in  those few hours at Lac Bain; and the knowledge that he had surrendered  to himself, that in going from Lac Bain he was leaving all that the  world held for him in the way of woman and love, drew his breath from  him in another broken, stifled cry.    When he lowered the scarf his face was white. Pierrot was staring at  him.    \"It makes me think--of home,\" he explained lamely. \"Sometimes I get  lonely, too. There's a girl--down there--who wears a scarf like this,  and what she wears smells like a flower, just as this does--\"    \"Oui, I understand,\" said Pierrot softly. \"It is the way I feel when my  Iowla is gone.\"    He replaced the scarf in the box, and when he returned to the stove  Philip explained why he had come to his cabin. With Pierrot's promise  to accompany him with dogs and sledge on his patrol the next day he  prepared to go to bed. Pierrot also was undressing, and Philip said to  him casually,    \"This woman--at Churchill--Jacques--what if some one should tell you  that she is not so much of an angel after all--that she is, perhaps,  something like--like the woman over at Lac la Biche, who ran away with  the Englishman?\"    Pierrot straightened as though Philip had thrust a knife-point into his  back. He broke forth suddenly into French.    \"I would call him a liar, M'sieur,\" he cried fiercely. \"I would call him  a liar, once-twice--three times, and then if he said it again I would  fight him. Mon Dieu, but it would be no sin to kill one with a mouth  like that!\"    Philip was conscious of the hot blood rushing to his face as he bent  over his bunk. The depths of Pierrot's faith shamed him, and he crawled  silently between the blankets and turned his face to the wall. Pierrot  extinguished the light, and a little later Philip could hear his deep  breathing. But sleep refused to close his own eyes, and he lay on his  back, painfully awake. In spite of the resolution he had made to  think no more of the woman at Lac Bain, his mind swept him back to her  irresistibly. He recalled every incident that had occurred, every word  that she had spoken, since he had first looked upon her beautiful  face out on the Churchill trail. He could find nothing but purity and  sweetness until he came with her for that fatal hour or two into the  company of Bucky Nome. And then, again, his blood grew hot. But--after  all--was there not some little excuse for her? He thought of the  hundreds of women he had known, and wondered if there was one among them  all who had not at some time fallen into this same little error as Mrs.  Becker. For the first time he began to look at himself. Mrs. Becker had  laughed with Bucky Nome, her cheeks had grown a little flushed, her eyes  had shone radiantly--but were those things a sin? Had those same eyes  not looked up into his own, filled with a sweetness that thrilled him,  when he bent over her beside the fire out on the Churchill trail? Was  there not that same lovely flush in her face when his lips had almost  touched her hair? And had not the colonel's sudden return brought a  flush into both their faces? He smiled to himself, and for a moment he  thrilled ecstatically. The reaction came like a shock. In an instant  other scenes--other faces--flashed upon him, and again he saw the  luring, beautiful face of Eileen Hawkins, who smiled on men as Mrs.  Becker had smiled on Bucky Nome and on him.    He closed his eyes and tried to force himself into sleep, but failed.  At last he rose silently from his bunk, filled his pipe, and sat down  in the darkness beside the stove. The storm had increased to a gale,  wailing and moaning over the cabin outside, and the sound carried  him back to the last night in the cabin far to the south, when he had  destroyed the hyacinth-scented letter. The thought of the letter moved  him restlessly. He listened to Pierrot's breathing, and knew that the  half-breed was asleep. Then he rose to his feet and laid his pipe on the  table. A curious feeling of guilt came over him as he moved toward  the box in which Jacques had placed the silken scarf. His breath came  quickly; in the dark his eyes shone; a tingling thrill of strange  pleasure"]]]
