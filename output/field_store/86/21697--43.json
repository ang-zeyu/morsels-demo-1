Stuart also conducted  some minor explorations before he undertook his greater one. He and  McKinlay were South Australia's heroes, and are still venerated there  accordingly. He died in England not long after the completion of his  last expedition.    We now come to probably the most melancholy episode in the long  history of Australian exploration, relating to the fate of Burke and  Wills. The people and Government of the colony of Victoria determined  to despatch an expedition to explore Central Australia, from Sturt's  Eyre's Creek to the shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria at the mouth of  the Albert River of Stokes's, a distance in a straight line of not  more than six hundred miles; and as everything that Victoria  undertakes must always be on the grandest scale, so was this. One  colonist gave 1000 pounds; 4000 pounds more was subscribed, and then  the Government took the matter in hand to fit out the Victorian  Exploring Expedition. Camels were specially imported from India, and  everything was done to ensure success; when I say everything, I mean  all but the principal thing--the leader was the wrong man. He knew  nothing of bush life or bushmanship, navigation, or any art of travel.  Robert O'Hara Burke was brave, no doubt, but so hopelessly ignorant of  what he was undertaking, that it would have been the greatest wonder  if he had returned alive to civilisation. He was accompanied by a  young man named Wills as surveyor and observer; he alone kept a diary,  and from his own statements therein he was frequently more than a  hundred miles out of his reckoning. That, however, did not cause his  or Burke's death; what really did so was bad management. The money  this expedition cost, variously estimated at from 40,000 to 60,000  pounds, was almost thrown away, for the map of the route of the  expedition was incorrect and unreliable, and Wills's journal of no  geographical value, except that it showed they had no difficulty with  regard to water. The expedition was, however, successful in so far  that Burke crossed Australia from south to north before Stuart, and  was the first traveller who had done so. Burke and Wills both died  upon Cooper's Creek after their return from Carpentaria upon the field  of their renown. Charles Gray, one of the party, died, or was killed,  a day or two before returning thither, and John King, the sole  survivor, was rescued by Alfred Howitt. Burke's and Stuart's lines of  travel, though both pushing from south to north, were separated by a  distance of over 400 miles in longitude. These travellers, or heroes I  suppose I ought to call them, were neither explorers nor bushmen, but  they were brave and undaunted, and they died in the cause they had  undertaken.    When it became certain in Melbourne that some mishap must have  occurred to these adventurers, Victoria, South Australia, and  Queensland each sent out relief parties. South Australia sent John  McKinlay, who found Gray's grave, and afterwards made a long  exploration to Carpentaria, where, not finding any vessel as he  expected, he had an arduous struggle to reach a Queensland cattle  station near Port Dennison on the eastern coast. Queensland sent  Landsborough by sea to Carpentaria, where he was landed and left to  live or die as he might, though of course he had a proper equipment of  horses, men, and gear. He followed up the Flinders River of Stokes,  had a fine country to traverse; got on to the head of the Warrego, and  finally on to the Darling River in New South Wales. He came across no  traces whatever of Burke. Victoria sent a relief expedition under  Walker, with several Queensland black troopers. Walker, crossing the  lower Barcoo, found a tree of Leichhardt's marked L, being the most  westerly known. Walker arrived at Carpentaria without seeing any  traces of the missing Burke and Wills; but at the mouth of the Albert  River met the master of the vessel that had conveyed Landsborough; the  master had seen or heard nothing of Burke. Another expedition fitted  out by Victoria, and called the Victorian Contingent Relief  Expedition, was placed under the command of Alfred Howitt in 1861. At  this time a friend of mine, named Conn, and I were out exploring for  pastoral runs, and were in retreat upon the Darling, when we met  Howitt going out. When farther north I repeatedly urged my companion  to visit the Cooper, from which we were then only eighty or ninety  miles away, in vain. I urged how we might succour some, if not all, of  the wanderers. Had we done so we should have found and rescued King,  and we might have been in time to save Burke and Wills also; but Conn  would not agree to go. It is true we were nearly starved as it was,  and might have been entirely starved had we gone there, but by good  fortune we met and shot a stray bullock that had wandered from the  Darling, and this happy chance saved our lives. I may here remark that  poor Conn and two other exploring comrades of those days, named  Curlewis and McCulloch, were all subsequently, not only killed but  partly eaten by the wild natives of Australia--Conn in a place near  Cooktown on the Queensland coast, and Curlewis and McCulloch on the  Paroo River in New South Wales in 1862. When we were together we had  many very narrow escapes from death, and I have had several similar  experiences since those days. Howitt on his arrival at Cooper's Creek  was informed by the natives that a white man was alive with them, and  thus John King, the sole survivor, was rescued.    Between 1860-65 several short expeditions were carried on in Western  Australia by Frank Gregory, Lefroy, Robinson, and Hunt; while upon the  eastern side of Australia, the Brothers Jardine successfully explored  and took a mob of cattle through the region that proved so fatal to  Kennedy and his companions in 1848. The Jardines traversed a route  more westerly than Kennedy's along the eastern shores of the Gulf of  Carpentaria to Cape York.    In 1865, Duncan McIntyre, while on the Flinders River of Stokes and  near the Gulf of Carpentaria, into which it flows, was shown by a  white shepherd at an out sheep station, a tree on which the letter L  was cut. This no doubt was one of Landsborough's marks, or if it was  really carved by Leichhardt, it was done upon his journey to Port  Essington in 1844, when he crossed and encamped upon the Flinders.  Mcintyre reported by telegraph to Melbourne that he had found traces  of Leichhardt, whereupon Baron von Mueller and a committee of ladies  in Melbourne raised a fund of nearly 4000 pounds, and an expedition  called \"The Ladies' Leichhardt Search Expedition,\" whose noble object  was to trace and find some records or mementoes, if not the persons,  and discover the last resting-place of the unfortunate traveller and  his companions, was placed under McIntyre's command. About sixty  horses and sixteen camels were obtained for this attempt. The less  said about this splendid but ill-starred effort the better.  Indignation is a mild term to apply to our feelings towards the man  who caused the ruin of so generous an undertaking. Everything that its  promoters could do to ensure its success they did, and it deserved a  better fate, for a brilliant issue might have been obtained, if not by  the discovery of the lost explorers, at least by a geographical  result, as the whole of the western half of Australia lay unexplored  before it. The work, trouble, anxiety, and expense that Baron von  Mueller went through to start this expedition none but the initiated  can ever know. It was ruined before it even entered the field of its  labours, for, like Burke's and Wills's expedition, it was  unfortunately placed under the command of the wrong man. The collapse  of the expedition occurred in this wise. A certain doctor was  appointed surgeon and second in command, the party consisting of about  ten men, including two Afghans with the camels, and one young black  boy. Their encampment was now at a water-hole in the Paroo, where  Curlewis and McCulloch had been killed, in New South Wales. The  previous year McIntyre had visited a water-hole in the Cooper some  seventy-four or seventy-five miles from his camp on the Paroo, and now  ordered the whole of his heavily-laden beasts and all the men to start  for the distant spot. The few appliances they had for carrying water  soon became emptied. About the middle of the third day, upon arrival  at the wished-for relief, to their horror and surprise they found the  water-hole was dry--by no means an unusual thing in Australian travel.  The horses were already nearly dead; McIntyre, without attempting to  search either up or down the channel of the watercourse, immediately  ordered a retreat to the last water in the Paroo. After proceeding a  few miles he left the horses and white men, seven in number, and went  on ahead with the camels, the Afghans and the black boy, saying he  would return with water for the others as soon as he could. His  brother was one of the party left behind. Almost as soon as McIntyre's  back was turned, the doctor said to the men something to the effect  that they were abandoned to die of thirst, there not being a drop of  water remaining, and that he knew in which packs the medical brandy  was stowed, certain bags being marked to indicate them. He then added,  \"Boys, we must help ourselves! the Leichhardt Search Expedition is a  failure; follow me, and I'll get you something to drink.\" Taking a  knife, he ripped open the marked bags while still on the choking  horses' backs, and extracted the only six bottles there were. One  white man named Barnes, to whom all honour, refused to touch the  brandy, the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4975"],[0,"Spinifex and Sand (#6)"],[1,"wells had been neglected, making it impossible, from their  depth, for me to get any water. I was fortunate in falling in with a  teamster and his waggon--a typical one of his class; on first sight they  are the most uncouth and foul-tongued men that it is possible to imagine.  But on further acquaintance one finds that the language is as superficial  as the dirt with which they cannot fail to be covered, since they are  always walking in a cloud of dust. My friend on this occasion was  apostrophising his horses with oaths that made my flesh creep, to help  them up a steep hill. The top reached, he petted and soothed his team in  most quaint language. At the bottom of the slope he was a demon of  cruelty, at its summit a kind-hearted human being! I lunched with him,  sitting under his waggon for shade, and found him most entertaining--nor  was the old pony neglected, for he was given a fine feed of chaff and  oats.    In due time I reached Coolgardie, where Lord Douglas and our new partner,  Mr. Driffield (since drowned in a boating accident on the Swan River),  joined me. They had engaged the services of one Luck and his camels, and  had ridden up from the Cross. The rush to Kurnalpi had just broken out,  so Driffield, Luck, and I joined the crowd of fortune-hunters; and a  queer-looking crowd they were too, for every third or fourth swagman  carried on his shoulder a small portable condenser, the boiler hanging  behind him and the cooler in front; every party, whether with horses,  carts, or camels, carried condensers of one shape or another; for the  month was January, no surface water existed on the track, and only salt  water could be obtained, by digging in the salt lakes which the road  passed. The nearest water to the scene of the rush was a salt lake seven  miles distant, and this at night presented a strange appearance.  Condensers of every size and capacity fringed the two shores of a narrow  channel; under each was a fire, and round each all night long could be  seen figures, stoking the burning wood or drawing water, and in the  distance the sound of the axe could be heard, for at whatever time a party  arrived they had forthwith to set about \"cooking water.\" The clattering  and hammering the incessant talking, and the figures flitting about in the  glare, reminded one of a crowded open-air market with flaring lamps and  frequent coffee stalls. Kurnalpi was known at first as \"Billy-Billy,\" or  as \"The Tinker's Rush\"--the first name was supposed by some to be of  native origin, by others to indicate the amount of tin used in the  condensing plants--\"Billy,\" translated for those to whom the bush is  unfamiliar, meaning a tin pot for boiling tea in, and other such uses.    Certainly there was plenty of tin at Kurnalpi, and plenty of alluvial gold  as well for the lucky ones--amongst which we were not numbered. Poor  Driffield was much disgusted; he had looked upon gold-finding as the  simplest thing in the world--and so it is if you happen to look in the  right place! and when you do so it's a hundred to one that you think your  own cleverness and knowledge guided you to it! Chance? Oh dear, no! From  that time forth your reputation is made as \"a shrewd fellow who knows a  thing or two\"; and if your find was made in a mine, you are an \"expert\"  at once, and can command a price for your report on other mines  commensurate with the richness of your own!    As the gold would not come to us, and my partner disliked the labour of  seeking it, we returned to Coolgardie, and set about looking after the  mines we already had. Financial schemes or business never had any charms  for me; when therefore I heard that the Company had cabled out that a  prospecting party should be despatched at once, I eagerly availed myself  of the chance of work so much to my taste. As speed was an object, and  neither camels nor men procurable owing to the rush, we did not waste any  time in trying to form a large expedition, such as the soul of the London  director loveth, but contented ourselves with the camels already to hand.    On March 24, 1894, we started; Luck, myself, and three camels--Omerod,  Shimsha, and Jenny by name--with rations for three months, and  instructions to prospect the Hampton Plains as far as the supply of  surface water permitted; failing a long stay in that region I could go  where I thought best.    To the east and north-east of Coolgardie lie what are known as the Hampton  Plains--so named by Captain Hunt, who in 1864 led an expedition past York,  eastward, into the interior. Beyond the Hampton Plains he was forced back  by the Desert, and returned to York with but a sorry tale of the country  he had seen. \"An endless sea of scrub,\" was his apt description of the  greater part of the country. Compared to the rest, the Hampton Plains were  splendid pastoral lands. Curiously enough, Hunt passed and repassed close  to what is now Coolgardie, and, though reporting quartz and ironstone,  failed to hit upon any gold. Nor was he the only one; Coolgardie had  several narrow squeaks of being found out.    Giles and Forrest both traversed districts since found to be gold-bearing,  and though, like Hunt, reporting, and even bringing back specimens of  quartz and ironstone, had the bad luck to miss finding even a \"colour.\"    Alexander Forrest, Goddard, and Lindsay all passed within appreciable  distance of Coolgardie without unearthing its treasures, though in  Lindsay's journal the geologist to the expedition pronounced the country  auriferous. When we come to consider how many prospectors pass over gold,  it is not so wonderful that explorers, whose business is to see as much  country as they can, in as short a time as possible, should have failed to  drop on the hidden wealth.    Bayley and Ford, its first discoverers, were by no means the first  prospectors to camp at Coolgardie. In 1888 Anstey and party actually found  colours of gold, and pegged out a claim, whose corner posts were standing  at the time of the first rush; but nobody heeded them, for the quartz was  not rich enough.    In after years George Withers sunk a hole and \"dry blew\" the wash not very  far from Bayley's, yet he discovered no gold. Macpherson, too, poked out  beyond Coolgardie, and nearly lost his life in returning, and, indeed, was  saved by his black-boy, who held him on the only remaining horse.    Other instances could be given, all of which show that Nature will not be  bustled, and will only divulge her secrets when the ordained time has  arrived. It has been argued that since Giles, for example, passed the  Coolgardie district without finding gold, therefore there is every  probability of the rest of the country through which he passed being  auriferous. It fails to occur to those holding this view, that a man may  recognise possible gold-bearing country without finding gold, or to read  the journals of these early travellers, in which they would see that the  Desert is plainly demarcated, and the change in the nature of the country,  the occurrence of quartz, and so forth, always recorded. These folk who so  narrowly missed the gold were not the only unfortunate ones; those  responsible for the choosing for their company of the blocks of land on  the Hampton Mains were remarkably near securing all the plums.    Bayley's is one and a half miles from their boundary, Kalgoorlie twelve  miles, Kurnalpi seven miles, and a number of other places lie just on the  wrong side of the survey line to please the shareholders, though had all  these rich districts been found on their land, I fancy there would have  been a pretty outcry from the general public.    At the time of which I am writing this land was considered likely to be as  rich as Ophir. Luck and I were expected to trip up over nuggets, and come  back simply impregnated with gold. Unfortunately we not only found no  gold, but formed a very poor idea of that part of the property which we  were able to traverse, though, given a good supply of water, it should  prove valuable stock country. Before we had been very long started on our  journey we met numerous parties returning from that region, though legally  they had no right to prospect there; each told us the same story--every  water was dry; and since every one we had been to was all but dry, we  concluded that they were speaking the truth; so when we arrived at Yindi,  a large granite rock with a cavity capable of holding some twenty  thousand gallons of water, and found Yindi dry, we decided to leave the  Hampton Plains and push out into new country.    Queen Victoria Spring, reported permanent by Giles, lay some seventy  miles to the eastward, and attracted our attention; for Lindsay had  reported quartz country near the Ponton, not far from the Spring, and the  country directly between the Spring and Kurnalpi was unknown.    On April 15th we left Yindi, having seen the last water twenty-six miles  back near Gundockerta, and passed Mount Quinn, entering a dense thicket of  mulga, which lasted for the next twenty miles. It was most awkward country  to steer through, and I often overheard Luck muttering to himself that I  was going all wrong, for he was a first-rate bushman and I a novice. I had  bought a little brumby from a man we met on the Plains, an excellent pony,  and most handy in winding his way through the scrub. Luck rode Jenny and  led the other two camels. Hereabouts we noticed a large number of old  brush fences--curiously I have never once seen a new one--which the  natives had set up for catching wallabies. The fences run out in long  wings, which meet in a point where a hole is dug. Neither wallabies nor  natives were to be seen, though occasionally we noticed where \"bardies\"  had been dug out, and a little further on a native grave, a hole about  three feet square by three feet deep, lined at the bottom with gum leaves  and strips of bark, evidently ready to receive the deceased. Luck, who  knew a "]]]
