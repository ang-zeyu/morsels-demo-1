I  knelt down and raised the night sight of my .450, and fired at the  moving form. The white soil and the bright moon actually enabled me to  distinguish the yellow color of its skin. A loud growl answered the  report of my rifle, and I could see the white salt of the plain fly as  the lion ran round and round in a circle, like a kitten after its tail.  I fired my second barrel and the lion disappeared. The wildbeest had  made off at the first shot. I tried, in the eagerness of youth, to  follow the lion in the bush; but soon common sense came to my rescue,  and warned me that in this dark growth the chances were decidedly in  favor of the lion's getting me, and so gave up the chase. Now, if I had  only waited till the great cat had got one of the wildbeest, I feel  pretty sure I should have been able to dispose of it at my leisure. When  I returned to camp, I ungratefully lost sight of the good luck I had  had, and gnashed my teeth at the thought that I had missed bringing home  a lion and an elephant. I was not destined to see a lion again on this  journey, but my annoyance at my ill fortune was often whetted by hearing  them roar.    However, by good luck and by George's help, I succeeded in securing one  elephant. The story of how this happened shall be the last hunting  adventure recorded in this article. We had left Ngiri and were camped at  the next water, some ten miles to the west. I had been out after  giraffes and had not been unsuccessful, and therefore had reached camp  in high good humor, when George came to me and said things were going  badly in camp--that the men had decided to desert me should I try to  push further on into the country; and that both head men seemed to think  further progress was useless with the men in such temper. I was puzzled  what to do, but wasted no time about making up my mind to do something.  I went into the tent and called the two head men to me. After a little  delay, they came, greeted me solemnly and at a motion from me crouched  on their hams. There is but little use in allowing a negro to state a  grievance, particularly if you know it is an imaginary one. The mere act  of putting their fancied wrongs into words magnifies them in their own  minds, and renders them less likely to listen to reason. My knowledge of  Swahili at this time did not permit me to address them in their own  language, so I spoke to them in English, knowing that they understood at  least a few words of that tongue. I told them that I was determined to  push on; that I knew that porters were like sheep and were perfectly  under the control of the head men; consequently, should anything happen,  I would know on whom to fix the blame. I repeated this several times,  and emphasized it with dreadful threats, then motioned for them to leave  the tent. I cannot say that I passed a comfortable night. Instead of  songs and laughter, an ominous stillness reigned in the camp, and,  though my words had been brave, I knew that I was entirely at the mercy  of the men.    Before dawn we were under way, keeping a strict watch for any signs of  mutiny. But, though the men were sullen, they showed no signs of turning  back. Our road lay over a wide plain, everywhere covered thickly with  lava, the aspect of which was arid in the extreme.    No more green buffalo bush, no more acacias, tall and beautiful, but in  their place rose columns of dust, whirled hither and thither by the  vagrant wind. Two of my men had been over this part of the road before,  but they professed to be ignorant of the whereabouts of the next water  place. Any hesitation on my part would have been the signal for a  general retreat, so there was nothing for it but to assume a look of the  utmost indifference, and to assure them calmly that we should find  water. At noon the appearance of the country had not changed. My men,  who had incautiously neglected to fill their water bottles in the  morning, were beginning to show signs of distress.    Suddenly my gun-bearer, pointing to the left, showed me two herds of  elephants approaching us. The larger herd, composed principally of  bulls, was nearer to us, and probably got our wind; for they at once  turned sharply to their right and increased their pace. The other herd  moved on undisturbed. I halted the caravan, told the men to sit down and  went forward to meet the elephants, with my servant and two gun-bearers.  I carried a .577, my servant carried the old 12-bore by Lang, his  cartridges crammed to the muzzle with powder. We were careful to avoid  giving the elephants our wind, so we advanced parallel to them, but in a  direction opposite to that in which they were going. As they passed us  we crouched, and they seemed unconscious of our presence. They went  about 400 yards past us, and then halted at right angles to the route  they had been pursuing. There were five elephants in this herd--four  large, and one small one, bringing up the rear. Some 60 yards on their  right flank was a small skeleton bush, and, making a slight detour, we  directed our course toward that. The leading animal was the largest, so  I decided to devote our attention to that one. I told George to fire at  the leg and I would try for the heart. We fired simultaneously, George  missing and my shot taking effect altogether too high.    Two things resulted from the discharge of our rifles: the gun-bearers  bolted with their weapons and the elephants charged toward us in line of  battle. As far as I can calculate, an elephant at full speed moves 100  yards in about ten seconds, so my readers can judge how much time  elapsed before the elephants were upon us. We fired again. My shot did  no execution, but George, who had remained in a kneeling position, broke  the off foreleg of the leading animal at the knee. It fell, and the  others at once stopped. We then made off, and watched from a little  distance a most interesting sight.    The condition of the wounded elephant seemed to be known to the others,  for they crowded about her and apparently offered her assistance. She  placed her trunk on the back of one standing in front of her and raised  herself to her feet, assisted by those standing around. They actually  moved her for some distance, but soon got tired of their kindly efforts.  We fired several shots at them, which only had the effect of making two  of the band charge in our direction and then return to their stricken  comrade. Cover there was none, and with our bad marksmanship it would  have been (to say the least) brutal to blaze away at the gallant little  herd. Besides, cries of \"water!\" \"water!\" were heard coming from my  thirsty caravan. So there was nothing for it but to leave the elephant,  take the people to water, if we could find it, and then return and put  the wounded animal out of its misery.    An hour and a half later we reached water, beautiful and clear, welling  up from the side of a small hill. This is called Masimani. On reaching  the water, all signs of discontent among my people vanished, and those  among them who were not Mahomedans, and therefore had no scruples about  eating elephant meat, raised a cheerful cry of _tembo tamu_--elephant  is sweet. I did not need a second hint, but returned, and, finding the  poor elephant deserted by its companions, put it out of its misery. It  was a cow with a fine pair of tusks. The sun was setting, and my men,  knowing that activity was the only means of saving their beloved  elephant meat from hyenas, attacked the body with fury--some with axes,  others with knives and one or two with sword bayonets. It was a terrible  sight, and I was glad to leave them at it and return to camp, well  satisfied with my day's work.    From Masimani, for the next four days, the road had never been trodden  by even an Arab caravan. I had no idea of the whereabouts of water, nor  had my men; but, having made a success of the first day's march, the men  followed me cheerfully, believing me possessed of magic power and  certain to lead them over a well-watered path. A kind providence did  actually bring us to water each night. The country was so dry that it  was absolutely deserted by the inhabitants, the Masai, and great was the  surprise of the Kibonoto people when we reached there on the fourth day.  They thought that we had dropped from the clouds, and said there could  not have been any water over the road we had just come. These Kibonoto  people had never been visited by an European, but received us kindly.  The people of Kibonoto are the westernmost inhabitants on the slopes of  Kilimanjaro.    From there to Taveta our road was an easy one, lying through friendly  peoples. After a brief rest at Taveta, I returned to the coast, reaching  Zanzibar a little over six months after I had set out from it.    Perhaps a word about the climate of the part of the country through  which I passed will not be amiss. Both my servant and myself suffered  from fever, but not to any serious extent. If a sedentary life is  avoided--and this is an easy matter while on a journey--if one avoids  morning dews and evening damps, and protects his head and the back of  his neck from the sun, I do not think the climate of East Africa would  be hurtful to any ordinarily healthy person. For my part, I do not think  either my servant or myself have suffered any permanent ill effects from  our venture; and yet the ages of twenty-one and seventeen are not those  best suited for travels in the tropics.    _W. A. Chanler._          [Illustration: A MOUNTAIN SHEEP.]    To the Gulf of Cortez      About a year ago, my brother, who is a very sagacious physician, advised  me to take the fresh liver of a mountain sheep for certain nervous  symptoms which were troublesome. None of the local druggists could fill  the prescription, and so it was decided that I should seek the materials  in person."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37151"],[0,"Habits, Haunts and Anecdotes of the Moose and Illustrations from Life (#6)"],[1,"l,  I'll tell you a little story and then you can judge for yourself. I started  out on the river one afternoon with a man from Boston, to look for moose.  It was a nice, quiet afternoon, and a good one to get game. We dropped down  stream with the current, and the first thing we knew there was a big bull  moose right out in the centre of the stream, sousing his head under  water, and feeding on the lily roots. Mr. A. was paralyzed at the sight,  for he never attempted to shoot. I held the canoe by putting my paddle down  to the bottom, to give him a chance to recover his nerve, and after a while  he realized what was expected of him, raised his rifle and fired. The shot  did not go any where near the moose, and the animal just raised his head  and stood there, looking back over its shoulder. I whispered to Mr. A.:  'You missed. Shoot again.' As it happened, my paddle slipped off into deep  water, and we were floating down on the moose and getting a good deal  closer than necessary. Mr. A. raised his gun and shot again, and then, as  the moose started to walk towards the bank, he got the action limbered up  and fired four more shots as quick as he could work the lever. None of them  touched the moose, and it moved off into the bushes, without seeming to  mind the racket very much. The moose wasn't nearly as rattled as Mr. A.  That man was completely prostrated with excitement. Nothing would do but we  must go straight back to camp. He said his nerves were too badly broken up  to stand anything more of the kind that day.    \"Well, sir, we hadn't gone more than three hundred yards on our return  trip, when I saw another bull on the bog adjacent to the stream. I paddled  Mr. A. within good, easy range, and he tried his luck again, but the bullet  struck the water twenty feet to the right. With that he began to swear, and  he threw his rifle down on the bottom of the canoe, cussing it and  everything else in sight. The moose gave a sudden jump and disappeared in  the alders. I reckon the swearing scared it more than the shooting.    [Illustration: MOOSE CALVES LEAVING WATER.    (Mud Pond Region.)    Photographed from Life.]    \"We hadn't more than a mile to go to reach camp, when Providence, just to  tantalize that man, gave him another opportunity. As we came around the  last bend, there stood a bull and a cow on the bank, not a great way off.  Mr. A. shot twice at the bull, as he stood there, and never touched a hair.  ''T ain't no use trying,' he said, 'I can shoot at a paper target all  right, but when it comes to game it's a different matter.' If all the  hunters who go into Maine could shoot as well in the woods as they can at  a mark there wouldn't be a decent head left in the State.    \"Now, there is a sample of your city sportsmen. That man fired nine shots  at those moose and he never drew blood, and I could have hit the larger  majority of them with a brick. Yes, sir; if I'd had a good brick I could  have swatted any one of those animals in the short ribs.\"    [Illustration: COW MOOSE SWIMMING MOOSEHEAD LAKE    Photographed from Life.]    One of the most amusing incidents to others than the participants, and a  most painful one to them, was the experience of two young moose hunters  from far off Oregon, who tried their luck in the lower Dead River region of  Maine with a jack. The night selected was one of exceptional darkness, the  scene, a large bog about five miles from camp, and all conditions pointed  to a most successful first attempt at this most unsportsmanlike branch of  hunting. Supper over, with both eager for the fray, an early start was in  order, and soon the silent craft with its over-anxious freight left the  bank and started down stream. The intense stillness of an early summer  night was not broken save by an occasional muskrat hurrying to its home in  the bank or the ripples playing round the bow of their canoe. Mile after  mile was reeled off, when suddenly a loud splashing was heard dead ahead in  the stream. It was a simple matter for the man with the jack to light it,  but his experience with the instrument in question was limited, and he had  not discovered the slide arrangement by which the light is quickly covered  without extinguishing it. The splashing continued, and both were undecided  whether to back out of their present position or light up and see what the  real cause of the disturbance was. The man in the stern suggested that the  lamp had better remain in the bottom of the canoe, while his friend in the  bow considered it far better to have a little light on the subject and  therefore be able to get their bearings. By scratching a match and  connecting it with the wick, the jack threw a strong light far ahead on the  silent waters. It required but a second to see a large dark object ten rods  ahead, waist deep in the water, and standing head on. Moose fever had  attacked both of the men, and they sat motionless as the large black  object cautiously moved nearer, wondering at each step who was challenging  him in his woodland retreat. By a superhuman effort the stern man, in a  voice scarcely above a whisper, told his friend to extinguish the light, as  the animal would be upon them in a short space of time. The animal, which  proved to be a large bull moose, decided that a closer inspection of these  trespassers was in order. He was now scarce a rod away, and the light from  the jack being exceedingly bright made him somewhat bewildered, with the  result that he charged the canoe. The water, being shallow at this point,  favored the men and prevented a possible catastrophe. His lordship jumped  in and the men jumped out of the canoe. They crawled to the bank and  secreted themselves as best they could under a neighboring tree, while the  animal made short work of the frail craft he had suddenly taken possession  of. A reasonable time having expired, the guides at the camp became  somewhat anxious as to the safety of their charges, and started in search.  At the approach of another craft the moose trotted off into the woods,  leaving the thoroughly frightened sportsmen in their undesirable position,  where they were found and taken back to camp, two sadder, and I might add,  wiser Oregonians.    [Illustration: TWO MAGNIFICENT TROPHIES OF THE CHASE.    The one on the left formerly held the Maine Record.]    [Illustration: YOUNG BULL MOOSE CAUGHT IN DEEP SNOW.    (Northern Aroostook.)    Photographed from Life.]      A NOBLE ANIMAL--BUT 'TWAS JUNE.    The waters of Black Pond, which but a scarce hour before had been lashed  into foam by a southwardly breeze, were silent. In the west the myriad  tints of a golden sunset were disappearing and the tiny stars were  beginning to peep through their blanket of blue. Against this majestic  picture, in the foreground, stood tall pines, rising like sentinels from  the bog in which for years they had found their growth. Far out on the lake  could be heard the solitary cry of a loon calling to his mate. What can be  more sublime, more entertaining, to the true sportsman than to be left  alone with nature in this paradise? A suggestion from the guide that we  skirt the shore and see if there be any game in the pond brought hearty  approval from his employer, and seating myself in the bow, we were soon  under way. Such music the tiny ripples make as they frolic and dance at the  bow, as the craft glides noiselessly along, the whirr of many wings, and a  large flock of wild ducks are up and away at our approach. The moon is on  the rise, and lights this woodland paradise with its shining rays. Suddenly  a loud splashing was heard down the shore not many rods distant, and the  guide sheers off so as to approach the forest denizen from the side. Again  the splashing, and twenty rods distant can be seen a large moose, throwing  the water from off his sides, unconscious of any human intruders. Such a  picture as he made, standing side on, fearless and brave. The guide had  stopped paddling, and the momentum gained was carrying us nearer every  second. Suddenly, coming into his line of vision, he turned his head in our  direction and showed us a most magnificent pair of velvet-covered antlers.  In his eye was the look of defiance, and, with his great head lifted high  in the air, the water still dripping from his brown coat, he seemed to say,  \"Well, it's June, what are you going to do about it?\" And so it was. We  left him, and slowly paddled back to camp, wishing that the seasons for a  scarce minute had changed,--that October had been June, that June had been  October,--and most of all that we could have used a rifle.    [Illustration: COW MOOSE ON SHORE OF ALLAGASH LAKE.    Photographed from Life.]      THE ABLEST ROMANCE IN MOOSE HISTORY IS THUS DESCRIBED:    The man who tells it says he was hunting in the mountains of Nova Scotia,  when he saw a huge bull moose grazing on a patch of moss, a hundred yards  away. He up and fired but when the smoke had cleared away, there stood the  moose grazing as before.    Again he fired, and again he was chagrined to see that the moose didn't  seem to mind it. A third shot, and the moose disappeared. Much excited, the  hunter ran to the moss patch, and there, on the further slope, lay three  dead moose. Pretty risky story to tell in Maine.    THE END."]]]
