Thin electric flex descended from somewhere inside the case down one  of the legs of the pedestal, and through a neatly drilled hole in the  floor, evidently placed there to accommodate it.    \"Burglar alarm!\" he muttered.    The opening of this case, and doubtless of any of the others, would  set alarm bells ringing. This was not an unimportant discovery, but it  brought him very little nearer to a solution of the chief problem which  engaged his mind. Assuming that Cohen had opened one of the cases and  had alarmed old Huang Chow, what steps had the latter taken to deal with  the intruder which had resulted in so ghastly a death? And how had he  disposed of the body?    As Durham stood there musing and looking down through the plate-glass at  the delicate porcelain beneath, a faint sound intruded itself upon the  stillness. It gave him another idea. Part of the floor was stone-paved,  but part was wood.    Upon a portion of the latter, where no carpet rested, Durham dropped  flat, pressing his ear to the floor.    A faint swishing and trickling sound was perceptible from some place  beneath.    \"Ah!\" he murmured.    Remembering that the premises almost overhung the Thames, he divined  that the cellars were flooded at high tide, or that there was some kind  of drain or cutting running underneath the house.    He stood up again, listening intently for any sound within the building.  He thought he had detected something, and now, as he stood there alert,  he heard it again--a faint scuffling, which might have been occasioned  by rats or even mice, but which, in some subtle and very unpleasant way,  did not suggest the movements of these familiar rodents.    Even as he perceived it, it ceased, leaving him wondering, and  uncomfortably conscious of a sudden dread of his surroundings. He  wondered in what part of this mysterious house Lala resided, and  recognizing that his departure must leave traces, he determined to  prosecute his inquiries as far as possible, since another opportunity  might not arise.    He was baffled but still hopeful. Something there was in the smell of  the place which threatened to unnerve him; or perhaps in its silence,  which remained quite unbroken save when, by acute listening, one  detected the dripping of water.    That unexplained scuffling sound, too, which he had failed to trace  or identify, lingered in his memory insistently, and for some reason  contained the elements of fear.    He crossed the room and began softly to mount the stair. It creaked only  slightly, and the door at the top proved to be ajar. He peeped in, to  find the place empty. It was a typical Chinese apartment, containing  very little furniture, the raised desk being the most noticeable item,  except for a small shrine which faced it on the other side of the room.    He mounted the steps to the desk and inspected a number of loose papers  which lay upon it. Without exception they were written in Chinese.  A sort of large, dull white blotting-pad lay upon the table, but its  surface was smooth and glossy.    Over it was suspended what looked like a lampshade, but on inspection it  proved to contain no lamp, but to communicate, by a sort of funnel, with  the ceiling above.    At this contrivance Durham stared long and curiously, but without coming  to any conclusion respecting its purpose. He might have investigated  further, but he became aware of a dull and regular sound in the room  behind him.    He turned in a flash, staring in the direction of two curtains draped  before what he supposed to be a door.    On tiptoe he crossed and gently drew the curtains aside.    He looked into a small, cell-like room, lighted by one window, where  upon a low bed Huang Chow lay sleeping peacefully!    Durham almost held his breath; then, withdrawing as quietly as he had  approached, he descended the stair. At the foot his attention was again  arrested by the faint scuffling sound. It ceased as suddenly as it  had begun, leaving him wondering and conscious anew of a chill of  apprehension.    He had already made his plans for departure, but knew that they must  leave evidence, when discovered, of his visit.    A large and solid table stood near the divan, and he moved this  immediately under the trap. Upon it he laid a leopard-skin to deaden  any noise he might make, and then upon the leopard-skin he set a massive  chair: he replaced his torch in his pocket and drew himself up on to the  roof again. Reclosing the trap by means of the awl which he had screwed  into it, he removed the awl and placed it in his pocket.    Then, sliding gently down the sloping roof, he dropped back into the  deserted court.          VIII    A CAGE OF BIRDS        \"No,\" said Lala, \"we have never had robbers in the house.\" She looked up  at Durham naively. \"You are not a thief, are you?\" she asked.    \"No, I assure you I am not,\" he answered, and felt himself flushing to  the roots of his hair.    They were seated in a teashop patronized by the workers of the district;  and as Durham, his elbows resting on the marble-topped table, looked  into the dark eyes of his companion, he told himself again that whatever  might be the secrets of old Huang Chow, his daughter did not share them.    The Chinaman had made no report to the authorities, although the piled  up furniture beneath the skylight must have afforded conclusive evidence  that a burglarious entry had been made into the premises.    \"I should feel very nervous,\" Durham declared, \"with all those valuables  in the house.\"    \"I feel nervous about my father,\" the girl answered in a low voice. \"His  room opens out of the warehouse, but mine is shut away in another part  of the building. And Ah Fu sleeps behind the office.\"    \"Were you not afraid when you suspected that Cohen was a burglar? You  told me yourself that you did suspect him.\"    \"Yes, I spoke to my father about it.\"    \"And what did he say?\"    \"Oh\"--she shrugged her shoulders--\"he just smiled and told me not to  worry.\"    \"And that was the last you heard about the matter?\"    \"Yes, until you told me he was dead.\"    Again he questioned the dark eyes and again was baffled. He felt  tempted, and not for the first time, to throw up the case. After all, it  rested upon very slender data--the mysterious death of a Chinaman  whose history was unknown and the story of a crook whose word was worth  nothing.    Finally he asked himself, as he had asked himself before, what did it  matter? If old Huang Chow had disposed of these people in some strange  manner, they had sought to rob him. The morality of the case was  complicated and obscure, and more and more he was falling under the  spell of Lala's dark eyes.    But always it was his professional pride which came to the rescue.  Murder had been done, whether justifiably or otherwise, and to him had  been entrusted the discovery of the murderer. It seemed that failure  was to be his lot, for if Lala knew anything she was a most consummate  actress, and if she did not, his last hope of information was gone.    He would have liked nothing better than to be rid of the affair,  provided he could throw up the case with a clear conscience. But when  presently he parted from the attractive Eurasian, and watched her slim  figure as, turning, she waved her hand and disappeared round a corner,  he knew that rest was not for him.    He had discovered the emporium of a Shadwell live-stock dealer with whom  Ah Fu had a standing order for newly fledged birds of all descriptions.  Purchases apparently were always made after dusk, and Ah Fu with his  birdcage was due that evening.    A scheme having suggested itself to Durham, he now proceeded to put it  into execution, so that when dusk came, and Ah Fu, carrying an empty  birdcage, set out from the house of Huang Chow, a very dirty-looking  loafer passed the corner of the street at about the time that the  Chinaman came slinking out.    Durham had mentally calculated that Ah Fu would be gone about half an  hour upon his mysterious errand, but the Chinaman travelled faster than  he had calculated.    Just as he was about to climb up once more on to the sloping roof,  he heard the pattering footsteps returning to the courtyard, although  rather less than twenty minutes had elapsed since the man had set out.    Durham darted round the corner and waited until he heard the door  closed; then, returning, he scrambled up on to the roof, creeping  forward until he was lying looking down through the skylight into the  darkened room below.    For ten minutes or more he waited, until he began to feel cramped and  uncomfortable. Then that happened which he had hoped and anticipated  would happen. The place beneath became illuminated, not fully, by means  of the hanging lamps, but dimly so that distorted shadows were cast  about the floor. Someone had entered carrying a lantern.    Durham's view-point limited his area of vision, but presently, as the  light came nearer and nearer, he discerned Ah Fu, carrying a lantern  in one hand and a birdcage in the other. He could hear nothing, for the  trap fitted well and the glass was thick. Moreover, it was very dirty.  He was afraid, however, to attempt to clean a space.    Ah Fu apparently had set the lantern upon a table, and into the radius  of its light there presently moved a stooping figure. Durham recognized  Huang Chow, and felt his heart beats increasing in rapidity.    Clutching the framework of the trap with his hands, he moved his head  cautiously, so that presently he was enabled to see the two Chinamen.  They were standing beside the lacquered coffin upon its dragon-legged  pedestal. Durham stifled an exclamation.

The   economy rebounded in 1993-94 after a severe depression accompanying   the collapse of the previous centrally planned system in 1990 and   1991. Stabilization policies - including a strict monetary policy,   public sector layoffs, and reduced social services - have improved the   government's fiscal situation and reduced inflation. The recovery was   spurred by the remittances of some 20% of the population which works   abroad, mostly in Greece and Italy. These remittances supplement GDP   and help offset the large foreign trade deficit. Foreign assistance   and humanitarian aid also supported the recovery. Most agricultural   land was privatized in 1992, substantially improving peasant incomes.   Albania's limited industrial sector, now less than one-sixth of GDP,   continued to decline in 1994. A sharp fall in chromium prices reduced   hard currency receipts from the mining sector. Large segments of the   population, especially those living in urban areas, continue to depend   on humanitarian aid to meet basic food requirements. Unemployment   remains a severe problem accounting for approximately one-fifth of the   work force. Growth is expected to continue in 1995, but could falter   if Albania becomes involved in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia,   workers' remittances from Greece are reduced, or foreign assistance   declines.
