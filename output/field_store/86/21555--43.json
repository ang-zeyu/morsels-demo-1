As consecrated ground there was not in extent sufficient to provide tombs  for the vast multitude of corpses which day and night, and almost every  hour, were brought in eager haste to the churches for interment, least of  all, if ancient custom were to be observed and a separate resting-place  assigned to each, they dug, for each graveyard, as soon as it was full, a  huge trench, in which they laid the corpses as they arrived by hundreds at a  time, piling them up as merchandise is stowed in the hold of a ship, tier  upon tier, each covered with a little earth, until the trench would hold no  more. But I spare to rehearse with minute particularity each of the woes  that came upon our city, and say in brief, that, harsh as was the tenor of  her fortunes, the surrounding country knew no mitigation, for there--not to  speak of the castles, each, as it were, a little city in itself--in  sequestered village, or on the open champaign, by the wayside, on the farm,  in the homestead, the poor hapless husbandmen and their families, forlorn of  physicians' care or servants' tendance, perished day and night alike, not as  men, but rather as beasts. Wherefore, they too, like the citizens, abandoned  all rule of life, all habit of industry, all counsel of prudence; nay, one  and all, as if expecting each day to be their last, not merely ceased to aid  Nature to yield her fruit in due season of their beasts and their lands and  their past labours, but left no means unused, which ingenuity could devise,  to waste their accumulated store; denying shelter to their oxen, asses,  sheep, goats, pigs, fowls, nay, even to their dogs, man's most faithful  companions, and driving them out into the fields to roam at large amid the  unsheaved, nay, unreaped corn. Many of which, as if endowed with reason,  took their fill during the day, and returned home at night without any  guidance of herdsman. But enough of the country! What need we add, but  (reverting to the city) that such and so grievous was the harshness of  heaven, and perhaps in some degree of man, that, what with the fury of the  pestilence, the panic of those whom it spared, and their consequent neglect  or desertion of not a few of the stricken in their need, it is believed  without any manner of doubt, that between March and the ensuing July upwards  of a hundred thousand human beings lost their lives within the walls of the  city of Florence, which before the deadly visitation would not have been  supposed to contain so many people! How many grand palaces, how many stately  homes, how many splendid residences, once full of retainers, of lords, of  ladies, were now left desolate of all, even to the meanest servant! How many  families of historic fame, of vast ancestral domains, and wealth proverbial,  found now no scion to continue the succession! How many brave men, how many  fair ladies, how many gallant youths, whom any physician, were he Galen,  Hippocrates, or Aesculapius himself, would have pronounced in the soundest  of health, broke fast with their kinsfolk, comrades and friends in the  morning, and when evening came, supped with their forefathers in the other  world.    Irksome it is to myself to rehearse in detail so sorrowful a history.  Wherefore, being minded to pass over so much thereof as I fairly can, I say,  that our city, being thus well-nigh depopulated, it so happened, as I  afterwards learned from one worthy of credit, that on a Tuesday morning  after Divine Service the venerable church of Santa Maria Novella was almost  deserted save for the presence of seven young ladies habited sadly in  keeping with the season. All were connected either by blood or at least as  friends or neighbours and fair and of good understanding were they all, as  also of noble birth, gentle manners, and a modest sprightliness. In age none  exceeded twenty-eight, or fell short of eighteen years. Their names I would  set down in due form, had I not good reason to with hold them, being  solicitous lest the matters which here ensue, as told and heard by them,  should in after time be occasion of reproach to any of them, in view of the  ample indulgence which was then, for the reasons heretofore set forth,  accorded to the lighter hours of persons of much riper years than they, but  which the manners of to-day have somewhat restricted; nor would I furnish  material to detractors, ever ready to bestow their bite where praise is due,  to cast by invidious speech the least slur upon the honour of these noble  ladies. Wherefore, that what each says may be apprehended without confusion,  I intend to give them names more or less appropriate to the character of  each. The first, then, being the eldest of the seven, we will call Pampinea,  the second Fiammetta, the third Filomena, the fourth Emilia, the fifth we  will distinguish as Lauretta, the sixth as Neifile, and the last, not  without reason, shall be named Elisa.    'Twas not of set purpose but by mere chance that these ladies met in the  same part of the church; but at length grouping themselves into a sort of  circle, after heaving a few sighs, they gave up saying paternosters, and  began to converse (among other topics) on the times.    So they continued for awhile, and then Pampinea, the rest listening in  silent attention, thus began:--\"Dear ladies mine, often have I heard it  said, and you doubtless as well as I, that wrong is done to none by whoso  but honestly uses his reason. And to fortify, preserve, and defend his life  to the utmost of his power is the dictate of natural reason in everyone that  is born. Which right is accorded in such measure that in defence thereof men  have been held blameless in taking life. And if this be allowed by the laws,  albeit on their stringency depends the well-being of every mortal, how much  more exempt from censure should we, and all other honest folk, be in taking  such means as we may for the preservation of our life? As often as I bethink  me how we have been occupied this morning, and not this morning only, and  what has been the tenor of our conversation, I perceive--and you will  readily do the like--that each of us is apprehensive on her own account; nor  thereat do I marvel, but at this I do marvel greatly, that, though none of  us lacks a woman's wit, yet none of us has recourse to any means to avert  that which we all justly fear. Here we tarry, as if, methinks, for no other  purpose than to bear witness to the number of the corpses that are brought  hither for interment, or to hearken if the brothers there within, whose  number is now almost reduced to nought, chant their offices at the canonical  hours, or, by our weeds of woe, to obtrude on the attention of every one  that enters, the nature and degree of our sufferings.    \"And if we quit the church, we see dead or sick folk carried about, or we  see those, who for their crimes were of late condemned to exile by the  outraged majesty of the public laws, but who now, in contempt of those laws,  well knowing that their ministers are a prey to death or disease, have  returned, and traverse the city in packs, making it hideous with their  riotous antics; or else we see the refuse of the people, fostered on our  blood, becchini, as they call themselves, who for our torment go prancing  about here and there and everywhere, making mock of our miseries in  scurrilous songs. Nor hear we aught but:--Such and such are dead; or, Such  and such art dying; and should hear dolorous wailing on every hand, were  there but any to wail. Or go we home, what see we there? I know not if you  are in like case with me; but there, where once were servants in plenty, I  find none left but my maid, and shudder with terror, and feel the very hairs  of my head to stand on end; and turn or tarry where I may, I encounter the  ghosts of the departed, not with their wonted mien, but with something  horrible in their aspect that appals me. For which reasons church and street  and home are alike distressful to me, and the more so that none, methinks,  having means and place of retirement as we have, abides here save only we;  or if any such there be, they are of those, as my senses too often have  borne witness, who make no distinction between things honourable and their  opposites, so they but answer the cravings of appetite, and, alone or in  company, do daily and nightly what things soever give promise of most  gratification. Nor are these secular persons alone; but such as live recluse  in monasteries break their rule, and give themselves up to carnal pleasures,  persuading themselves that they are permissible to them, and only forbidden  to others, and, thereby thinking to escape, are become unchaste and  dissolute. If such be our circumstances--and such most manifestly they  are--what do we here? what wait we for? what dream we of? why are we less  prompt to provide for our own safety than the rest of the citizens? Is life  less dear to us than to all other women? or think we that the bond, which  unites soul and body is stronger in us than in others, so that there is no  blow that may light upon it, of which we need be apprehensive? If so, we  err, we are deceived. What insensate folly were it in us so to believe! We  have but to call to mind the number and condition of those, young as we, and  of both sexes, who have succumbed to this cruel pestilence, to find therein  conclusive evidence to the contrary. And lest from lethargy or indolence we  fall into the vain imagination that by some lucky accident we may in some  way or another, when we would, escape--I know not if your opinion accord  with mine--I should deem it most wise in us, our case being what it is, if,  as many others have done before us, and are still doing, we were to quit  this place, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37329"],[0,"The Domestic Cat (#6)"],[1,"stitution--all that ever I knew were so, at least, and I  daresay my readers can corroborate what I say.    _Merits_.--Their extreme gentleness is one merit, and their tractability  and teachability are others.  A pure blue cat is very rare, and they are  greatly prized by their owners.    _Points_.--1.  _Size_: They are rather under-sized, never being much  larger than the pure tortoiseshell.    2.  _Head_: The head is small and round, and the eyes are prettiest when  of a beautiful orange-yellow.  The nose should be tipped with black.    3.  _Pelage_: Moderately long and delightfully soft and sheeny.    4.  _Colour_: This is the principal point.  It is, as I said, a nice  cool, slate-grey, and, like the black cat, our blue pussy must be all  one colour, without a hair of white anywhere.  _Even her whiskers_ must  be of the same colour as her fur.    Points of the Blue Cat.    Size, 5.    Head, 5.    Pelage, 10.    Colour, 30.    Total, 50.    We now come to the Tabbies--the real old English cats--the playmates of  our infant days and sharers of our oatmeal porridge.  They are the  commonest of all cats, and justly so, too, for there is hardly anything  they don't know, and nothing they can't be taught, bar conic sections,  perhaps, the _Pons Asinorum_, and a few trifles of that ilk.  You will  find a tabby cat wherever you go, and you will find her equally at home  wherever she is--whether sitting on the footstool on the cosy hearthrug,  singing duets with the tea-kettle; catching birds and rabbits in the  woods, or mice in the barn; conducting a concert for your especial  benefit on the neighbouring tiles at twelve o'clock at night; examining  the flower seeds you lately sowed in the garden to see if they are  budding yet; or locked, quite by accident, into the pigeon loft.    The first cat of the Tabby kind which claims our attention is the Red or  Sandy Tabby.    This is a very beautiful animal, and quite worthy of a place in the best  drawing-rooms in the land.  Although they do not grow to the immense  size of some of our brown tabbies, still they are better hunters, much  fiercer, and of a hardier constitution.  They much prefer out-of-door  sport, and will attack and slay even the polecat and weasel; and  instances have been known of their giving battle to the wild cat  himself.    _Merits_.--They are the prettiest of pets, and the honestest of all cat  kind.  They are such good ratters that neither mice nor rats will  frequent the house they inhabit.    _Points_.--1.  _Size_: They ought to be as large as possible, and not  clumsy; they are generally neater cats all over than the Brown Tabbies.    2.  _Head_: The head should be large and broad, with rather shortish  ears, well placed, and the face ought to beam with intelligence and good  nature.  The eyes should be deep set, and a nice yellow colour.    3.  _Pelage_: The coat is generally short in nearly all the Tabbies, but  ought to be sleek and glossy.    4.  _Colour and markings_: The colour is a light sandy red, barred and  striped with red of a darker, deeper hue.  No white.  The stripes or  markings ought to be the same on both sides, and even the legs ought to  be marked with cross bars, and one beautiful swirl, at least, across the  chest.  This is called the Lord Mayor's Chain, and when the cat has two,  give him extra points.    Points of the Red Tabby.    Size, 10.    Head, 5.    Colour and markings, 30.    Pelage, 5.    Total, 50.    Next comes the Brown Tabby.    This is the largest of all breeds of cats, fourteen, seventeen, and even  twenty pounds a common weight.  They are also, when well marked and  striped, exceedingly beautiful.  Of all cats they are the best adapted  for house-hunting, being less addicted to wandering than some breeds.    _Merits_.--Their hunting proclivities.  Their fondness for children is  sometimes quite remarkable.  I have known many instances of Brown Tom  Tabbies, so fierce that scarce any one dare lay a finger on them  unscathed, but a little child of four years of age could do anything  with them, lug them about anyhow, and even carry them head down, over  its shoulder by the tail.  They are, moreover, nice, loving,  kind-hearted pets, and exceedingly fond of their master and mistress.  They are the cats of all cats to make a family circle look cosy and  complete around the fire of a winter's night.    _Points_.--1.  _Size_: It will be observed below that I give fifteen  points for size.  The bigger your Brown Tom Tabby is the better he  looks, _if_ the one-half of it isn't fat, for if so he won't be  graceful, and that is one essential point.  I can find a Tabby at this  moment who weighs over twenty pounds, and who will spring from the  floor, without scrambling, mind you, clean on to the top of the parlour  door, and that is little short of seven feet.  I like to see a tabby  with a graceful carriage then, and shortish in forelegs, with  beautifully well-fitted and rounded limbs, and with a tiger-like walk  and mien.    2.  _Head_: Very large and broad and round, ears short, eyes dark, and  muzzle broad, not lean, and thin and long.  This latter certainly gives  him more killing power, but it brings him too near the wild cat.  I  don't care how savagely he behaves in a cage at a show, for well I know  he is quite a different animal at his own fireside, asleep on the rug in  little Alice's arms, or purring in bed on old Maid Mudge's virgin bosom.    3.  _Colour_: A nice dark brown or grey ground, and the workings as  deeply black as possible.  No white.    4.  _Markings_: Like a Bengal tiger, and even prettier.  The tail and  legs likewise barred.  The head striped perpendicularly down the brow,  and the marks going swirling round the cheeks.  Nose black or brown, and  the eyes as dark as possible, and full of fire.    5.  _Pelage_: Short and glossy.    Points of the Brown Tabby.    Size, 15.    Head, 5.    Colour, 10.    Markings, 15.    Pelage, 5.    Total, 50.    Lastly, we have the Silver Tabby and the Spotted Tabby, and in almost  all points these may be judged alike.    The Silver Tabby is a sweetly pretty cat.  Perhaps the prettiest of all  pussies.  They are a size smaller than even the best Red Tabbies, and  are infinitely more graceful, and quicker in all their motions.  They  are proud, elegant, aristocratic cats, fond to love and quick to resent  an injury.    _Merits_.--Their special merit is their exceeding beauty.  They are  somewhat rare, however.  Here is a bit of advice to any one who would  like to have four really pretty cats about the house, each to show the  others to advantage.  Get a pure white kitten, a pure black one, a red  tabby, and a silver ditto.  Take great care in the training of them, be  careful in feeding and housing them, and you will have your reward.    The Spotted Tabby is also very pretty.  He ought to be a good, sizeable  animal, with broad head, short ears, and a loving face; ground colour a  dark grey, one dark stripe, and down the spine, and diverging from this  stripes of black broken up into spots.    _Points_.--The Silver Tabby ought to be--    1.  _In size_, less than or about the size of the Red Tabby, and very  quick and graceful.    2.  _Head_: Large and shapely, but not so blunt as the Brown Tabby's;  ears short and eyes light.    3.  _Colour and markings_: Of a deep Aberdeen granite, grey in the  ground-work, and the markings very dark and beautifully arranged.  Don't  forget the Mayor's Chains.    4.  _Pelage_: Longish, if anything; but not so long as to make the judge  suspect crossing with the Persian.    Points of Silver and Spotted Tabbies.    Size, 10.    Head, 5.    Colour and markings, 30.    Pelage, 5.    Total, 50.    There are one or two fancy cats I have not mentioned, as the  Red-and-white, etc; but I believe I have said enough to make anyone,  with a little study and attention, a good judge of the points and  qualities of the different breeds of the English domestic cat.    CHAPTER SEVEN.    ASIATIC CATS.    When I was a little boy at school, floundering through Herodotus, and  getting double doses of fum-fum daily for my Anabasis--for my old  teacher, when he couldn't get enough Greek into one end of me, took  jolly good care to put it in at the other--there was no man I had  greater respect for than Alexander the Great, owing to his having done  that Gordian knot business so neatly.  I practised afterwards on the  dominie's tawse (i.e., the fum-fum strap); I tied a splendid knot on it,  and then cut it through with a jack-knife; but, woe's me! the plaguy  dominie caught me in the very act, and--and I had to take my meals  standing for a week.    But ever since then I have always been a don at knots; and I give myself  no small credit, whether you do or not, reader, for the dexterous manner  in which I have polished off the cat-classification knot.  There it lay  before me, interminable, intricate, incensing; and bother the end could  I see to it at all at all.  \"Draw the sword of Scotland.\"  Swish!  There  it lies, the short-haired European pussies on the one hand, and the  Asiatic or long-haired on the other.    Among these latter you will find exactly the same colours, and the same  variety of markings, as among the European cats proper.  We give their  points in a general way.    1.  _Size_: The blue cats and the pure white are usually of the smallest  dimensions; next comes the black, and lastly the tabbies.  Some of these  latter grow to immense sizes, and are animals of a beauty which is at  times magnificent.  The cat that belonged to Troppman, the distinguished  French murderer, and now, or lately, possessed by Mr Hincks, of  Birmingham, is worth going a day's journey to behold.  Yet, although  very large, they are very graceful, too, and can spring enormous  distances.  Fierce enough, too, they can be when there is any occasion,  especially to strangers or dogs.    2.  _Head_: The heads of the white, blue, and black ought"]]]
