The letters of Heloise have been read and imitated throughout the whole  of the last nine centuries. Some have found in them the utterances of a  woman whose love of love was greater than her love of God and whose  intensity of passion nothing could subdue; and so these have condemned  her. But others, like Chateaubriand, have more truly seen in them a  pure and noble spirit to whom fate had been very cruel; and who was,  after all, writing to the man who had been her lawful husband.    Some of the most famous imitations of her letters are those in the  ancient poem entitled, \"The Romance of the Rose,\" written by Jean de  Meung, in the thirteenth century; and in modern times her first letter  was paraphrased by Alexander Pope, and in French by Colardeau. There  exist in English half a dozen translations of them, with Abelard's  replies. It is interesting to remember that practically all the other  writings of Abelard remained unpublished and unedited until a very  recent period. He was a remarkable figure as a philosopher and scholar;  but the world cares for him only because he was loved by Heloise.          QUEEN ELIZABETH AND THE EARL OF LEICESTER      History has many romantic stories to tell of the part which women have  played in determining the destinies of nations. Sometimes it is a  woman's beauty that causes the shifting of a province. Again it is  another woman's rich possessions that incite invasion and lead to  bloody wars. Marriages or dowries, or the refusal of marriages and the  lack of dowries, inheritance through an heiress, the failure of a male  succession--in these and in many other ways women have set their mark  indelibly upon the trend of history.    However, if we look over these different events we shall find that it  is not so much the mere longing for a woman--the desire to have her as  a queen--that has seriously affected the annals of any nation. Kings,  like ordinary men, have paid their suit and then have ridden away  repulsed, yet not seriously dejected. Most royal marriages are made  either to secure the succession to a throne by a legitimate line of  heirs or else to unite adjoining states and make a powerful kingdom out  of two that are less powerful. But, as a rule, kings have found greater  delight in some sheltered bower remote from courts than in the castled  halls and well-cared-for nooks where their own wives and children have  been reared with all the appurtenances of legitimacy.    There are not many stories that hang persistently about the love-making  of a single woman. In the case of one or another we may find an episode  or two--something dashing, something spirited or striking, something  brilliant and exhilarating, or something sad. But for a woman's whole  life to be spent in courtship that meant nothing and that was only a  clever aid to diplomacy--this is surely an unusual and really wonderful  thing.    It is the more unusual because the woman herself was not intended by  nature to be wasted upon the cold and cheerless sport of chancellors  and counselors and men who had no thought of her except to use her as a  pawn. She was hot-blooded, descended from a fiery race, and one whose  temper was quick to leap into the passion of a man.    In studying this phase of the long and interesting life of Elizabeth of  England we must notice several important facts. In the first place, she  gave herself, above all else, to the maintenance of England--not an  England that would be half Spanish or half French, or even partly Dutch  and Flemish, but the Merry England of tradition--the England that was  one and undivided, with its growing freedom of thought, its bows and  bills, its nut-brown ale, its sturdy yeomen, and its loyalty to crown  and Parliament. She once said, almost as in an agony:    \"I love England more than anything!\"    And one may really hold that this was true.    For England she schemed and planned. For England she gave up many of  her royal rights. For England she descended into depths of treachery.  For England she left herself on record as an arrant liar, false,  perjured, yet successful; and because of her success for England's sake  her countrymen will hold her in high remembrance, since her scheming  and her falsehood are the offenses that one pardons most readily in a  woman.    In the second place, it must be remembered that Elizabeth's courtships  and pretended love-makings were almost always a part of her diplomacy.  When not a part of her diplomacy they were a mere appendage to her  vanity. To seem to be the flower of the English people, and to be  surrounded by the noblest, the bravest, and the most handsome  cavaliers, not only of her own kingdom, but of others--this was,  indeed, a choice morsel of which she was fond of tasting, even though  it meant nothing beyond the moment.    Finally, though at times she could be very cold, and though she made  herself still colder in order that she might play fast and loose with  foreign suitors who played fast and loose with her--the King of Spain,  the Duc d'Alencon, brother of the French king, with an Austrian  archduke, with a magnificent barbarian prince of Muscovy, with Eric of  Sweden, or any other Scandinavian suitor--she felt a woman's need for  some nearer and more tender association to which she might give freer  play and in which she might feel those deeper emotions without the  danger that arises when love is mingled with diplomacy.    Let us first consider a picture of the woman as she really was in order  that we may understand her triple nature--consummate mistress of every  art that statesmen know, and using at every moment her person as a  lure; a vain-glorious queen who seemed to be the prey of boundless  vanity; and, lastly, a woman who had all a woman's passion, and who  could cast suddenly aside the check and balance which restrained her  before the public gaze and could allow herself to give full play to the  emotion that she inherited from the king, her father, who was himself a  marvel of fire and impetuosity. That the daughter of Henry VIII. and  Anne Boleyn should be a gentle, timid maiden would be to make heredity  a farce.    Elizabeth was about twenty-five years of age when she ascended the  throne of England. It is odd that the date of her birth cannot be given  with precision. The intrigues and disturbances of the English court,  and the fact that she was a princess, made her birth a matter of less  account than if there had been no male heir to the throne. At any rate,  when she ascended it, after the deaths of her brother, King Edward VI.,  and her sister, Queen Mary, she was a woman well trained both in  intellect and in physical development.    Mr. Martin Hume, who loves to dwell upon the later years of Queen  Elizabeth, speaks rather bitterly of her as a \"painted old harridan\";  and such she may well have seemed when, at nearly seventy years of age,  she leered and grinned a sort of skeleton smile at the handsome young  courtiers who pretended to see in her the queen of beauty and to be  dying for love of her.    Yet, in her earlier years, when she was young and strong and impetuous,  she deserved far different words than these. The portrait of her by  Zucchero, which now hangs in Hampton Court, depicts her when she must  have been of more than middle age; and still the face is one of beauty,  though it be a strange and almost artificial beauty--one that draws,  attracts, and, perhaps, lures you on against your will.    It is interesting to compare this painting with the frank word-picture  of a certain German agent who was sent to England by his emperor, and  who seems to have been greatly fascinated by Queen Elizabeth. She was  at that time in the prime of her beauty and her power. Her complexion  was of that peculiar transparency which is seen only in the face of  golden blondes. Her figure was fine and graceful, and her wit an  accomplishment that would have made a woman of any rank or time  remarkable. The German envoy says:    She lives a life of such magnificence and feasting as can hardly be  imagined, and occupies a great portion of her time with balls,  banquets, hunting, and similar amusements, with the utmost possible  display, but nevertheless she insists upon far greater respect being  shown her than was exacted by Queen Mary. She summons Parliament, but  lets them know that her orders must be obeyed in any case.    If any one will look at the painting by Zucchero he will see how much  is made of Elizabeth's hands--a distinctive feature quite as noble with  the Tudors as is the \"Hapsburg lip\" among the descendants of the house  of Austria. These were ungloved, and were very long and white, and she  looked at them and played with them a great deal; and, indeed, they  justified the admiration with which they were regarded by her  flatterers.    Such was the personal appearance of Elizabeth. When a young girl, we  have still more favorable opinions of her that were written by those  who had occasion to be near her. Not only do they record swift glimpses  of her person, but sometimes in a word or two they give an insight into  certain traits of mind which came out prominently in her later years.    It may, perhaps, be well to view her as a woman before we regard her  more fully as a queen. It has been said that Elizabeth inherited many  of the traits of her father--the boldness of spirit, the rapidity of  decision, and, at the same time, the fox-like craft which often showed  itself when it was least expected.    Henry had also, as is well known, a love of the other sex, which has  made his reign memorable. And yet it must be noted that while he loved  much, it was not loose love. Many a king of England, from Henry II. to  Charles II., has offended far more than Henry VIII. Where Henry loved,  he married; and it was the unfortunate result of these royal marriages  that has made him seem unduly fond of women. If, however, we examine  each"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4693"],[0,"Famous Affinities of History: The Romance of Devotion. Vol 1-4, Complete (#6)"],[1,"of her character. She made friends as easily as Abelard made  enemies. Even Bernard, who had overthrown her husband, sought out  Heloise to ask for her advice and counsel.    Abelard died while on his way to Rome, whither he was journeying  in order to undergo a penalty; and his body was brought back to the  Paraclete, where it was entombed. Over it for twenty-two years Heloise  watched with tender care; and when she died, her body was laid beside  that of her lover.    To-day their bones are mingled as she would have desired them to be  mingled. The stones of their tomb in the great cemetery of Pere Lachaise  were brought from the ruins of the Paraclete, and above the sarcophagus  are two recumbent figures, the whole being the work of the artist  Alexandra Lenoir, who died in 1836. The figure representing Heloise  is not, however, an authentic likeness. The model for it was a lady  belonging to a noble family of France, and the figure itself was brought  to Pere Lachaise from the ancient College de Beauvais.    The letters of Heloise have been read and imitated throughout the whole  of the last nine centuries. Some have found in them the utterances of  a woman whose love of love was greater than her love of God and whose  intensity of passion nothing could subdue; and so these have condemned  her. But others, like Chateaubriand, have more truly seen in them a pure  and noble spirit to whom fate had been very cruel; and who was, after  all, writing to the man who had been her lawful husband.
