The people of Palos had hardly hoped to see again those who had  sailed away on so desperate an adventure.  Now, when they saw only  one of the three vessels return their joy was mingled with grief.  When, however, they learned that Columbus returned in triumph, and  that India had been reached, their joy knew no bounds.  Shops were  closed, bells were rung, and all the people in holiday attire thronged  to the harbour, and with shouts and cheers they bore Columbus in  triumph to the church, there to give thanks to God for his safe and  glorious return.  And ere the shouts had died away, a second vessel  was seen approaching.  It was the Pinta which, though parted from the  Nina, had also weathered the storms and now came safely to port.    At once on landing Columbus had sent a letter to the King and  Queen telling them of his return.  Now he received an answer; it  was addressed to Don Christopher Columbus, our Admiral of the Ocean  Sea, Viceroy and Governor of the Islands discovered in the Indies.  It bade him to come at once to court.  It told him that a new expedition  would immediately be fitted out; so with a heart overflowing with  joy and pride, Columbus set forth to Barcelona where the King and  Queen then were.    The great news of his voyage and discovery had outsped him, and  the people of Barcelona received him with every mark of respect  and honour.  As he passed through the streets, riding on a splendid  horse and surrounded by the greatest nobles of Spain, they cheered  him again and again.  They gazed in wonder also at the dark-skinned  savages, the gaily coloured parrots, and other strange things he  had brought with him from out the Sea of Darkness.    Sitting on a throne of state beneath a canopy of cloth of gold,  with the young Prince of Spain beside them , the King and Queen  received Columbus.  At his approach they rose, and standing they  welcomed back to their realm as a mighty prince he who had gone  forth a simple sailor.  And as Columbus would have knelt to kiss  their hands they raised him, and bade him be seated beside them as  an equal.  Seldom did the haughty rulers of Spain show such great  honour even to the proudest nobles in the land.    And so while King, and Queen, and courtiers listened breathlessly  Columbus told of all he had done, of all the marvels he had seen,  of the richness and fairness of the lands he had found and claimed  for Spain.  And when he had finished the King and Queen fell upon  their knees, and clasping their hands they raised eyes filled with  tears of joy to heaven, giving thanks to God for His great mercies.  The courtiers too fell upon their knees and joined their prayers  to those of the King and Queen, while over all the triumphant notes  of the Te Deum rang out.    So ended the great voyage of Columbus.  He had shown the way across  the Sea of Darkness; he had proved that all the stories of its  monsters and other dangers were false.  But even he had no idea  of the greatness of his discovery.  He never realised that he had  shown the way to a new world; he believed to the day of his death  that he had indeed found new islands, but that his greatest feat  was that of finding a new way to the Old World.  Yet now being made  a noble, he took for his coat of arms a, group of golden islands  in an azure sea, and for motto the words, \"To Castile and Leon,  Columbus gave a New World.\"    Now began a time of pomp and splendour for Columbus.  He who had  gone forth a penniless sailor now rode abroad in gorgeous array;  often he might be seen with the Queen on one hand and John, the  young Prince of Spain, on the other.  Sometimes even the King himself  would ride with him, and seeing him so high in royal favour all the  greatest and proudest nobles of the land were eager to make much  of him.  So they feted him, flattered him, and spread banquets for  him.  But some were jealous of the great fame of Columbus, and they  made light of his discoveries.    It is told how, one day at a banquet when every one talked of these  wonderful deeds, one of the guests spoke slightingly of them. \"It  is all very well,\" he said to Columbus, \"but in a great country like  Spain, where there are such numbers of daring sailors and learned  folk besides, many another man might have done the same as you.  We  should have found the Indies even if you had not.\"    To this speech Columbus answered nothing, but he asked for an egg  to be brought to him.  When it was brought he placed it on the table  saying, \"Sirs, I will lay a wager with any of you that you cannot  make this egg stand up without anything at all to support it.\"    One after the other they tried, but no one could do it.  At length  it came round to Columbus again.  And he, taking it in his hand,  struck it sharply on the table so that one end was chipped a little,  and it stood upright.    \"That, my lord, is my answer, \" he said, looking at the courtier  who had scoffed.  And all the company were silent.  For they saw he  was well answered.  Columbus had shown that after a deed is once done  it is simple, and every one knows how to do it.  What he had done  in sailing across the Sea of Darkness was only wonderful because  no one ,else had thought of doing it.    Portugal was now very jealous of Spain's success, and King Ferdinand  of Spain was fearful lest King John of Portugal should seize the  new islands which Columbus had discovered.  So he appealed to the  Pope to settle the matter.  And the Pope decided that all new lands  discovered west of an imaginary line drawn through the Atlantic  Ocean west of the Azores and from pole to pole should belong to  Spain.  All discoveries east of this line should belong to Portugal.  If you will look at a map of the world you will see that this gave  to Spain all the Americas with their islands (except a little bit  of Brazil) and to Portugal the whole of Africa.    But almost before this matter was settled Columbus had set forth  again on another voyage across the great ocean, now no longer the Sea  of Darkness: this time he had no difficulty in getting a company.  For every one was eager to go with him, even many of the sons of  great nobles.  This time too the passage was made without any doubts  and fears, but with joyful expectations.    Columbus had hoped great things of the little colony that he had  left behind him.  But when he cast anchor one night before the fort  his heart sank.  All was dark and silent on shore.  Yet still hoping,  he ordered two cannon to be fired as a signal to the colonists.  The cannon boomed through the still, warm darkness of the night,  and slowly the echoes died away.  But there was no answer save the  sighing of the sea, and the scream of the startled birds.  From  the fort there came no sound or any sign of life, and with sad  forebodings the Spaniards waited for the dawn.    Then it was seen that the fort was a ruin.  It had been burned and  sacked.  Torn clothing and broken vessels were strewn around, but  as the Spaniards wandered sadly among the ruins they found no trace  of their companions save eleven graves with the grass growing above  them.    At first no natives would come near the white men, for they feared  their anger.  But at length, tempted by the offer of gifts and  other friendly signs, they came.  They told how the Spaniards had  quarreled amongst themselves, how the fort had been attacked by  unfriendly Indians from another island, and how all the white men  had been slain.    Thus ended the first white colony ever planted in Western lands.  All traces of it have vanished, and upon the spot where La Navida  stood there is now a little fishing village called Petit Anse.    Columbus founded other colonies, but they succeeded no better than  the first one.  In all he made four voyages across the Atlantic,  and in the third he landed upon the coast of South America, near  the mouth of the Orinoco.  But Columbus did not know that at last  he had discovered the great double Continent of America.  He thought  that he had merely discovered another island, and he named it La  Isla Santa.  Afterwards he was so delighted at the beauty of the  land that he thought he must have found the Garden of Eden, so he  became certain that he had landed on the eastern corner of Asia.    In 1506 Columbus died.  And it is sad to think that he who, by his  great faith and great daring, led the way across the Sea of Darkness,  and gave a New World to the Old died in poverty and neglect.  The  men who had wept for joy at the news of his discovery shed no tear  over his grave.  He died \"unwept, unhonoured and unsung.\" Years passed  before men recognised what a great man had dwelt among them: years  passed before any monument was raised to his memory.  But indeed he  had scarce need of any, for as has been well said, \"The New World  is his monument.\" And every child of the New World must surely  honour that monument and seek never to deface it.    __________          Chapter 5 - How America Was Named            \"The New World is his monument.\" And yet the New World does not  bear the name of Columbus.  So in this chapter I am going to tell  you how America was named.    As soon as Columbus had shown the way across the Sea of Darkness  many were eager to follow in his footsteps. \"There is not a man,\"  he says himself, \"down to the very tailors, who does not beg to be  allowed to become a discoverer.\" Among the many who longed to sail  the seas there was a man named Amerigo Vespucci.    Like Columbus, Amerigo Vespucci was an Italian.  He was born in  Florence and there for nearly forty years he lived quietly, earning  his living as a clerk in the great merchant house of Medici.  But  although he was diligent at business his thoughts were not wholly  taken up with it, and in his leisure hours he loved to read books  of geography, and pore over maps and charts.
