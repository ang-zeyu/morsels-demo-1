If we deprive him  of this work, which is the only one which can be called his own, what  can he have executed in all this time? In this house there is no other  picture that can be assigned to him, although Vasari asserts that he  there painted other rooms. A most beautiful picture by Genga, and of the  greatest rarity, is to be seen in S. Caterina da Siena in Rome; the  subject is the Resurrection of our Saviour.    Of the other scholars of Perugino we have no distinct account; but we  find some notice of them in the life of their master. Giovanni  Spagnuolo, named Lo Spagna, was one of the many _oltramontani_ whom  Perugino instructed. The greater part of these introduced his manner  into their own countries, but Giovanni established himself at Spoleti,  at which place, and in Assisi, he left his best works. In the opinion of  Vasari the colouring of Perugino survived in him more than in any of his  fellow scholars. In a chapel of the Angioli, below Assisi, there remains  the picture described by Vasari, in which are the portraits of the  brotherhood of S. Francis, who closed his days on this spot, and,  perhaps, no other pupil of this school has painted portraits with more  truth, if we except Raffaello himself, with whom no other painter is to  be compared.    A more memorable person is Andrea Luigi di Assisi, a competitor of  Raffaello, although of more mature years, who, from his happy genius was  named L'Ingegno. He assisted Perugino in the Sala del Cambio, and in  other works of more consequence; and he may be said to be the first of  that school who began to enlarge the style, and soften the colouring.  This is observable in several of his works, and singularly so in the  sybils and prophets in fresco in the church of Assisi; if they are by  his hand, as is generally believed. It is impossible to behold his  pictures without a feeling of compassion, when we recollect that he was  visited with blindness at the most valuable period of his life. Domenico  di Paris Alfani also enlarged the manner of his master, and even more  than him Orazio his son, and not his brother, as has been imagined. This  artist bears a great resemblance to Raffaello. There are some of his  pictures in Perugia, which, if it were not for a more delicate  colouring, and something of the suavity of Baroccio, might be assigned  to the school of Raffaello; and there are pictures on which a question  arises whether they belong to that school or to Orazio; particularly  some Madonnas, which are preserved in various collections. I have seen  one in the possession of the accomplished Sig. Auditor Frigeri in  Perugia; and there is another in the ducal gallery in Florence. The  reputation of the younger Alfani has injured that of the other; and even  in Perugia some fine pieces were long considered to be by Orazio, which  have since been restored to Domenico. An account of these, and other  works of eminent artists, may be found in modern writers; and  particularly in Mariotti, who mentions the altarpiece of the  Crucifixion, between S. Apollonia and S. Jerome, at the church of the  Conventuals, a work by the two Alfanis, father and son. In commendation  of the latter he adds, that he was the chief of the academy for design,  which was founded in 1573, and which, after many honourable struggles,  has been revived in our own time.    There are other artists of less celebrity in Perugia, though not omitted  by Vasari. Eusebio da S. Giorgio painted in the church of S. Francesco  di Matelica, a picture with several saints, and on the grado, part of  the history of S. Anthony, with his name, and the year 1512. We may  recognize in it the drawing of Perugino, but the colouring is feeble.  His picture of the Magi at S. Agostino is better coloured, and in this  he followed Paris. The works of Giannicola da Perugia, a good colourist,  and therefore willingly received by Pietro to assist him in his labours,  however inferior to that artist in design and perspective, are  recognized in the Cappella del Cambio, which is near the celebrated sala  of Perugino, and was painted by him with the life of John the Baptist.  In the church of S. Thomas, is his picture of that Apostle about to  touch the wounds of our Saviour, and excepting a degree of sameness in  the heads, it possesses much of the character of Perugino. Giambatista  Caporali, erroneously called Benedetto by Vasari, Baldinucci, and  others, holds likewise a moderate rank in this school, and is more  celebrated among the architects. Giulio, his natural son, afterwards  legitimatized, also cultivated the same profession.    The succeeding names belonging to this school are not mentioned by  Vasari; a circumstance which does not prove the impropriety of their  admission, as there are many deserving of notice. Mariotti, our guide in  the chronology of this age, and a correct judge of the conformity of  style, notices Mariano di Ser Eusterio, whom Vasari calls Mariano da  Perugia (tom. iv. p. 162), referring to a picture in the church of S.  Agostino in Ancona, which is \"not of much interest.\" In opposition to  this opinion of Vasari, however, Mariotti adduces another picture, of a  respectable class, by Mariano, to be found in S. Domenico di Perugia;  whence we may conclude that this painting is deserving of a place in the  history of art. He also mentions Berto di Giovanni, whom Raffaello  engaged as his assistant to paint a picture for the monks of Monteluci  (of which we shall speak in our notice of Penni) and who was appointed  in this contract by Raphael himself to paint the grado. This grado is in  the sacristy, and is so entirely in the manner of Raffaello, in the  history of the virgin which it represents, that we may conclude either  that Raffaello made the design, or that it was painted by one of his  school. If it was by Berto, it proves him to have been one of those who  exchanged the school of Perugino for that of Raffaello; and if he did  not paint it, he must always be held in consideration for the regard he  received from the master of the art. Of this artist more information may  be obtained from Bianconi, in the Antologia Romana, vol. iii. p. 121.  Mariotti enumerates also Sinibaldo da Perugia, who must be esteemed an  excellent painter from his works in his native place, and more so from  those in the cathedral at Gubbio, where he painted a fine picture in  1505, and a gonfalon still more beautiful, which would rank him among  the first artists of the ancient school. To the above painters Pascoli  adds a female artist of the name of Teodora Danti, who painted cabinet  pictures in the style of Perugino and his scholars.    From tradition, as well as conjecture, we may notice in Citta di  Castello a Francesco of that city, a scholar of Perugino, who, in an  altarpiece in the church of the Conventuals, left an Annunciation with a  fine landscape. He is named in the Guida di Roma, in the account of the  chapel of S. Bernardino in Ara Caeli, where he is supposed to have  worked with Pinturicchio and Signorelli. There is a conjecture, though  no decided proof, that a Giacomo di Guglielmo was a pupil of Pietro,  who, at Castel della Pieve, his native place, painted a gonfalon,  estimated by good judges in Perugia at sixty-five florins; and also a  Tiberio di Assisi, who, in many of the coloured lunettes in the convent  degli Angeli, containing the history of the Life of S. Francis, shews  clearly that Perugino was his prototype, though he had not talent enough  to imitate him. Besides Tiberio, some have assigned to the instructions  of Perugino, the most eminent painter of Assisi, Adone (or Dono) Doni,  not unknown to Vasari, who often mentions him, and particularly in his  life of Gherardi (vol. v. p. 142). He is there called of Ascoli, an  opinion which Bottari maintains against Orlandi, who, on the best  grounds, changed it to Assisi. In Ascoli he is not at all known, but he  is well known in Perugia by a large picture of the Last Judgment in the  church of S. Francis, and still better in Assisi, where he painted in  fresco, in the church of the Angeli, the life of the founder, and of S.  Stephen, and many other pieces, which, for a long period, served as a  school for youth. He had very little of the ancient manner; the truth of  his portraits is occasionally wonderful; his colouring is that of the  latest of the scholars of Perugino; and he appears to be an artist of  more correctness than spirit. I find also a Lattanzio della Marca, of  the school of Perugino, commemorated by Vasari in the above mentioned  life. He is thought to be the same as Lattanzio da Rimino, of whom  Ridolfi makes mention, among the scholars of Giovanni Bellino, as  painting a picture in Venice in rivalship with Conegliano.[24] We are  enabled more correctly to ascertain this from a document in the  possession of Mariotti, of which we shall shortly speak, from which we  not only learn to a certainty his native place, but further, that he was  the son of Vincenzo Pagani, a celebrated painter, as will hereafter be  seen, and that both were living in the year 1553. It appears, therefore,  very probable that Lattanzio was instructed by his father, and that we  may doubt of his being under Bellini, who died about 1516, or under  Perugino, among whose disciples he is not enumerated by the very  accurate Mariotti. It seems certain, that on the death of Vannucci he  succeeded to his fame, and obtained for himself some of the most  important orders in Perugia, as, for instance, the great work of  painting the chambers in the castle. He accomplished this task by the  assistance of Raffaellino del Colle, Gherardi, Doni, and Paperello. He  there commenced the picture of S. Maria del Popolo, and executed the  lower part, where there is a great number of persons in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34604"],[0,"Middle American Frogs of the Hyla microcephala Group (#6)"],[1,"(12), 90884 (46), 90885 (39),  90886 (20); *Finca Tinaja, BYU 16032; Panzos, UMMZ 90889 (2).

Hist., 17:348, July 14, 1966.      _Diagnosis._--Brown lateral stripe wide, including loreal region and  entire tympanum, extending to groin, bordered above by narrow white  line; dorsum unicolor or with pair of dark lines (or rows of dashes)  usually extending only to the sacral region; shanks having dark flecks,  no transverse bars; interorbital bar lacking.    _Description and Variation._--Males attain a maximum snout-vent length  of 26.4 mm. in Oaxaca, whereas in a sample from Acacoyagua, Chiapas,  the largest male has a snout-vent length of 25.7 mm., and from La  Trinidad, Guatemala, 24-6 mm. Specimens from the western part of the  range (eastern Oaxaca) have slightly smaller heads and proportionately  larger tympani than the more eastern populations (Table 1).    The color pattern shows little variation, except in the nature of the  dorsal markings. In a few specimens from throughout the range, but  especially in the eastern part of the range, the dorsum lacks markings  between the dorsolateral white lines. In most specimens the dorsal  pattern consists of flecks or dashes arranged in two parallel  longitudinal rows, and in some specimens the marks are fused into  parallel lines. Small brown flecks are present on the dorsal surfaces  of the shanks; in some specimens these flecks tend to form a  longitudinal stripe on the shank. An interorbital dark mark is  invariably absent.    When active at night _Hyla robertmertensi_ is pale yellow above with a  white dorsolateral line and pale brown lateral stripe; the dorsal  markings are faint. By day the dorsum is yellowish tan with brown  markings. The dorsolateral stripe is creamy white, and the lateral  stripe is dark brown (Pl. 14). The venter is white, and the iris is  dull bronze. In breeding males the vocal sac is yellow.    _Remarks._--Although this species superficially resembles _Hyla  microcephala microcephala_, the latter is easily distinguished by the  narrow brown lateral stripe, as compared with the much wider stripe  in _H. robertmertensi_. No other hylids in northern Central America  and southern Mexico can be confused with this species.    _Distribution._--_Hyla robertmertensi_ inhabits the Pacific slopes (to  elevations of 700 meters) and lowlands from eastern Oaxaca (east of  the Plains of Tehuantepec) southeastward to central El Salvador. The  species also occurs in the Cintalapa Valley (Atlantic drainage) in  southwestern Chiapas (Fig. 2.) The distribution seems to be limited on  the northwest and southeast by arid environments. The region in which  _Hyla robertmertensi_ lives is characterized by higher rainfall and  more luxuriant vegetation than occur on the Plains of Tehuantepec or  on the Pacific lowlands of eastern El Salvador and southern Honduras.  In addition to the localities listed below, Mertens (1952:30)  recorded the species from Hacienda Cuyan-Cuya, Depto. Sonsonate, El  Salvador.        [Illustration: Fig. 2.
