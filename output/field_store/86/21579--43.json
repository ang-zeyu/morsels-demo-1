These people are Christians of the doctrine of the blessed Saint  Bartholomew, as they say; and their baptism is in three kinds, of  blood, fire, and water: that is to say, that they circumcise  themselves, and mark themselves on the temples and forehead with  fire, and also in water, like the Catholic Christians. Many of them  are deficient in our true faith, because the country is very large,  and whilst in the principal city of Babel Malech, where Prester John  resides, they may be Christians, in many other distant parts they  live in error and without being taught; so that they are only  Christians in name.      BABEL MELECH.    In the interior of this country is the great city of Babel  Melech,[42] where Prester John holds his residence. The Moors call  him the great King of the Habeshys: he is Christian, and lord of  many extensive countries and numerous people, with whom he makes  subject many great kings. He is very rich, and possesses more gold  than any other prince. This Prester John holds a very large court,  and he keeps many men at arms continually in his pay, whom he takes  about with him. He goes out very rarely from his dwelling; many  kings and great lords come to visit him. In this city a great feast  takes place in the month of August, for which so many kings and  nobles come together, and so many people that they are innumerable:  and on this day of the feast in August they take an image out of a  church, which is believed to be that of Our Lady, or that of St.  Bartholomew, which image is of gold and of the size of a man; its  eyes are of very large and beautiful rubies of great value, and the  whole of it is adorned with many precious stones of much value, and  placing it in a great chariot of gold, they carry it in procession  with very great veneration and ceremony, and Prester John goes in  front of this car in another gold car, very richly dressed in cloth  of gold with much jewellery. And they begin to go out thus in the  morning, and go in procession through all the city with much music  of all sorts of instruments, until the evening, when they go home.  And so many people throng to this procession, that in order to  arrive at the car of the image many die of being squeezed and  suffocated; and those who die in this wise are held as saints and  martyrs; and many old men and old women go with a good will to die  in this manner.      SUEZ.    Leaving this country of Prester John and the coast of the sea of  Arabia Felix, and turning to the other part of the Red Sea, which is  also called Arabia, and the Moors call it Barra Arab, there is a  village, a seaport called Suez,[43] and thither the Moors of Guida,  the port of Mecca, bring all the spices, drugs, precious stones,  seed pearl, amber, musk, and other merchandise of great value from  the parts about India; and from there they load them on camels to  carry them by land to Cairo, and from Cairo other merchants carry  them to Alexandria; and from there the Venetians and other  Christians usually export them. And this trade now, in a great  measure, ceases on account of the Portuguese, whose fleets prohibit  the navigation of the Moors from India to the Red Sea.[44] And the  Great Sultan, lord of Cairo, who loses most by this, ordered a fleet  to be built in the port of Suez, for which he had the wood and  artillery, and other equipments transported by land, in which much  money was expended; and this fleet was of ships and galleys, in  order to pass with it to India and there forbid the Portuguese from  cruising. And when this fleet was built many people of different  nations went with it to the first India, which is the Kingdom of  Cambay; and the Captain of it was Amir Ucen,[45] and with this fleet  they met that of Portugal in front of a city named Dyu, and there  they fought vigorously, and many people were killed, and at last the  Moors, Turks, and Mamelukes were conquered and all their fleet was  taken and part of it burned, and on this account and several other  victories which the Portuguese gained over the before-mentioned  Moors, they lost their navigation in the Red Sea, and the said port  of Suez remains without the trade in spices.      MOUNT SINAI.    Near the said city of Suez there is in the country of Arabia on the  Red Sea, the mountain of Sinai, where lies the blessed Saint  Catharine in a church, in which there are Christian friars, under  the lordship of the Sultan, to which building the devout of all  Christian countries come in pilgrimage, and the chief part of those  that throng thither are from the country of Prester John and  Armenia, Babilonia, Constantinople, and Jerusalem.      ELIOBON AND MEDINA.    Having passed Mount Sinai, which the Moors call Tur, along the coast  of the Red Sea going out of it, there is a village of the Moors, a  seaport called Eliobon,[46] and it is a port where they disembark  for Medina, which is another town of the Moors, up the country at  three days' journey from the port, and the body of Mahomed is buried  in it.      GUIDA PORT OF MECA.    Leaving the port of Eliobon to go out of the Red Sea, there is a  town of the Moors, called Guida, and it is the port of Mecca,  whither the ships used to come every year from India with spices and  drugs, and they returned thence to Calicut with much copper,  quicksilver, vermillion, saffron, rose-water, scarlet silks,  camelots, tafetans and other goods, of stuffs used in India, and  also with much gold and silver; and the trade was very great and  profitable. And from this port of Guida these spices and drugs were  transported in small vessels to Suez, as has been already said.      MECA.    At one day's journey up the country from the port of Guida is the  great city of Meca, in which there is a very large mosque, to which  all the Moors from all parts go in pilgrimage, and they hold for  certain that they are saved by washing with the water of a well  which is in this mosque: and they carry it away from there in  bottles to their countries as a great relic. In the aforesaid Guida  port of Mecca a fortress has been lately built by Emir Hussein, the  Moorish captain of the ships of the Sultan, which the Portuguese  destroyed in India: this captain when he saw himself defeated, did  not dare return to his country without performing some service to  his king, and he decided on begging of the King of Cambay (who is  called Sultan Mahamud) assistance in money, and so also from the  nobles and merchants of his kingdom and from other Moorish kings, in  order to construct this fortress, saying: that since the Portuguese,  (whom they call Franks) were so powerful, it would not be wonderful  if they were to come into this port and were to go and destroy the  house of Mahomet. And these Moorish kings and people hearing his  petition, and seeing the power of the King of Portugal, it seemed to  them that this might come to pass, and thus all gave him great  gifts, by means of which he loaded three ships with spices and other  merchandise, and went with them to the Red Sea, and arrived at  Guida, where he sold them, and with the money he made the said  fortress, and during the time that he was building it, the  Portuguese were making another inside the town of Calicut,[47] and  the King of Calicut begged the Captain Major of the King of Portugal  to give him permission to send then a ship laden with spices to  Mecca. And this permission was given him, and the ship was sent. And  there went in it as captain an honourable person of the Moors named  Califa, and he arrived at Guida the port of Mecca, where he came on  shore very well dressed out, along with his people, and he found  Emir Hussein building his fortress, and was asked by him news of the  Portuguese. And this Califa answered him, telling him how they were  in great peace at Calicut, and making a handsome fortress. And Emir  Hussein asked him, how dare you come to Mecca being a friend of the  Portuguese? Califa answered him, I am a merchant and am unable to do  anything, but you who are a captain of the great Sultan if you go to  India to turn them out of it, how came you to leave them there, and  to make a fortress here? At which Emir Hussein was much put out, and  ordered Califa immediately, and well dressed as he was, to take  stones and mortar, he and his people, and help to build the  fortress: and he made him work for the space of an hour.[48] And  Califa related this in Calicut later when he returned there.[49]      JAZAN, HALI, ALHOR.    Leaving Jiddah the port of Mekkah, to go out of the Red Sea there  are three towns of the Moors, which have got kings over them, one is  called Jazan,[50] another Hali, and the other Alhor; in these there  are many horses and plenty of provisions. This king does not obey  the Sultan nor any other king whatever; he holds many countries  under him in which he has many towns with many sea ports, from which  the Moorish merchants used to export a few horses to India in their  merchant ships, because there they are worth a good deal.      HODEYDA, MAHA, BABEL MENDE.    Having passed these places and kingdom, there are three places  further on the coast which belong to the kingdom of Aden; the one  they call Hodeyda, the other Maha,[51] the other Babelmende, which  is in the mouth of the strait of the Red Sea where the ships enter  it, and at this place the ships take pilots as far as Jiddah, who  live by it.      ISLAND OF CAMARON.    In the sea of these other places, there is a small island called  Camaron,[52] inhabited by Moors, in which the ships were accustomed  to take refreshments when they passed by it to Jiddah. This island  was ravaged by Alonso de Alboquerque, captain of the King of  Portugal; and he staid there for some days repairing his fleet in  order to leave the Red Sea, for the season did not allow him to go  as far as Jiddah, to which he wished "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3829"],[0,"Love Among the Chickens (#6)"],[1,"mother makes it. What an infernal noise those birds are making. I  suppose they don't feel at home in the yard. Wait till they see the A1  compact residential mansions we're going to put up for them. Finished  breakfast? Then let's go out. Come along, Millie.\"    The red-headed Beale, discovered leaning in an attitude of thought on  the yard gate and observing the feathered mob below with much interest,  was roused from his reflections and despatched to the town for the wire  and sugar boxes. Ukridge, taking his place at the gate, gazed at the  fowls with the affectionate air of a proprietor.    \"Well, they have certainly taken you at your word,\" I said, \"as far as  variety is concerned.\"    The man with the manners of a marquess seemed to have been at great  pains to send a really representative selection of fowls. There were  blue ones, black ones, white, grey, yellow, brown, big, little,  Dorkings, Minorcas, Cochin Chinas, Bantams, Wyandottes. It was an  imposing spectacle.    The Hired Man returned towards the end of the morning, preceded by a  cart containing the necessary wire and boxes; and Ukridge, whose  enthusiasm brooked no delay, started immediately the task of fashioning  the coops, while I, assisted by Beale, draped the wire-netting about  the chosen spot next to the paddock. There were little  unpleasantnesses--once a roar of anguish told that Ukridge's hammer had  found the wrong billet, and on another occasion my flannel trousers  suffered on the wire--but the work proceeded steadily. By the middle of  the afternoon, things were in a sufficiently advanced state to suggest  to Ukridge the advisability of a halt for refreshments.    \"That's the way to do it,\" he said, beaming through misty pince-nez  over a long glass. \"That is the stuff to administer to 'em! At this  rate we shall have the place in corking condition before bedtime. Quiet  efficiency--that's the wheeze! What do you think of those for coops,  Beale?\"    The Hired Man examined them woodenly.    \"I've seen worse, sir.\"    He continued his examination.    \"But not many,\" he added. Beale's passion for the truth had made him  unpopular in three regiments.    \"They aren't so bad,\" I said, \"but I'm glad I'm not a fowl.\"    \"So you ought to be,\" said Ukridge, \"considering the way you've put up  that wire. You'll have them strangling themselves.\"    In spite of earnest labour the housing arrangements of the fowls were  still in an incomplete state at the end of the day. The details of the  evening's work are preserved in a letter which I wrote that night to my  friend Lickford.      \"... Have you ever played a game called Pigs in Clover? We have just  finished a merry bout of it, with hens instead of marbles, which has  lasted for an hour and a half. We are all dead tired, except the Hired  Man, who seems to be made of india-rubber. He has just gone for a  stroll on the beach. Wants some exercise, I suppose. Personally, I feel  as if I should never move again. You have no conception of the  difficulty of rounding up fowls and getting them safely to bed. Having  no proper place to put them, we were obliged to stow some of them in  the cube sugar-boxes and the rest in the basement. It has only just  occurred to me that they ought to have had perches to roost on. It  didn't strike me before. I shan't mention it to Ukridge, or that  indomitable man will start making some, and drag me into it, too. After  all, a hen can rough it for one night, and if I did a stroke more work  I should collapse.    \"My idea was to do the thing on the slow but sure principle. That is to  say, take each bird singly and carry it to bed. It would have taken  some time, but there would have been no confusion. But you can imagine  that that sort of thing would not appeal to Stanley Featherstonehaugh!  He likes his manoeuvres to be on a large, dashing, Napoleonic scale. He  said, 'Open the yard gate and let the blighters come out into the open;  then sail in and drive them in mass formation through the back door  into the basement.' It was a great idea, but there was one fatal flaw  in it. It didn't allow for the hens scattering. We opened the gate, and  out they all came like an audience coming out of a theatre. Then we  closed in on them to bring off the big drive. For about thirty seconds  it looked as if we might do it. Then Bob, the Hired Man's dog, an  animal who likes to be in whatever's going on, rushed out of the house  into the middle of them, barking. There was a perfect stampede, and  Heaven only knows where some of those fowls are now. There was one in  particular, a large yellow bird, which, I should imagine, is nearing  London by this time. The last I saw of it, it was navigating at the  rate of knots in that direction, with Bob after it, barking his  hardest. The fowl was showing a rare turn of speed and gaining rapidly.  Presently Bob came back, panting, having evidently given the thing up.  We, in the meantime, were chasing the rest of the birds all over the  garden. The affair had now resolved itself into the course of action I  had suggested originally, except that instead of collecting them  quietly and at our leisure, we had to run miles for each one we  captured. After a time we introduced some sort of system into it. Mrs.  Ukridge stood at the door. We chased the hens and brought them in.  Then, as we put each through into the basement, she shut the door on  it. We also arranged Ukridge's sugar-box coops in a row, and when we  caught a fowl we put it in the coop and stuck a board in front of it.  By these strenuous means we gathered in about two-thirds of the lot.  The rest are all over England. A few may be still in Dorsetshire, but I  should not like to bet on it.    \"So you see things are being managed on the up-to-date chicken farm on  good, sound Ukridge principles. It is only the beginning. I look with  confidence for further interesting events. I believe if Ukridge kept  white mice he would manage to get feverish excitement out of it. He is  at present lying on the sofa, smoking one of his infernal brand of  cigars, drinking whisky and soda, and complaining with some bitterness  because the whisky isn't as good as some he once tasted in Belfast.  From the basement I can hear faintly the murmur of innumerable fowls.\"        CHAPTER VI    MR. GARNET'S NARRATIVE--HAS TO DO WITH A REUNION    The day was Thursday, the date July the twenty-second. We had been  chicken-farmers for a whole week, and things were beginning to settle  down to a certain extent. The coops were finished. They were not  masterpieces, and I have seen chickens pause before them in deep  thought, as who should say, \"Now what?\" but they were coops within the  meaning of the Act, and we induced hens to become tenants.    The hardest work had been the fixing of the wire-netting. This was the  department of the Hired Man and myself, Ukridge holding himself proudly  aloof. While Beale and I worked ourselves to a fever in the sun, the  senior partner of the firm sat on a deck-chair in the shade, offering  not unkindly criticism and advice and from time to time abusing his  creditors, who were numerous. For we had hardly been in residence a day  before he began to order in a vast supply of necessary and unnecessary  things, all on credit. Some he got from the village, others from  neighbouring towns. Axminster he laid heavily under contribution. He  even went as far afield as Dorchester. He had a persuasive way with  him, and the tradesmen seemed to treat him like a favourite son. The  things began to pour in from all sides,--groceries, whisky, a piano, a  gramophone, pictures. Also cigars in great profusion. He was not one of  those men who want but little here below.    As regards the financial side of these transactions, his method was  simple and masterly. If a tradesman suggested that a small cheque on  account would not be taken amiss, as one or two sordid fellows did, he  became pathetic.    \"Confound it, sir,\" he would say with tears in his voice, laying a hand  on the man's shoulders in a wounded way, \"it's a trifle hard, when a  gentleman comes to settle in your neighbourhood, that you should dun  him for money before he has got the preliminary expenses about the  house off his back.\" This sounded well, and suggested the disbursement  of huge sums for rent. The fact that the house had been lent him rent  free was kept with some care in the background. Having weakened the man  with pathos, he would strike a sterner note. \"A little more of this,\"  he would go on, \"and I'll close my account. Why, damme, in all my  experience I've never heard anything like it!\" Upon which the man would  apologise, and go away, forgiven, with a large order for more goods.    By these statesmanlike methods he had certainly made the place very  comfortable. I suppose we all realised that the things would have to be  paid for some day, but the thought did not worry us.    \"Pay?\" bellowed Ukridge on the only occasion when I ventured to bring  up the unpleasant topic, \"of course we shall pay. Why not? I don't like  to see this faint-hearted spirit in you, old horse. The money isn't  coming in yet, I admit, but we must give it time. Soon we shall be  turning over hundreds a week, hundreds! I'm in touch with all the big  places,--Whiteley's, Harrod's, all the nibs. Here I am, I said to them,  with a large chicken farm with all the modern improvements. You want  eggs, old horses, I said: I supply them. I will let you have so many  hundred eggs a week, I said; what will you give for them? Well, I'll  admit their terms did not come up to my expectations altogether, but we  must not sneer at small prices at first.    \"When we get a connection, we shall be able to name our terms. It  stands to reason, laddie. Have you ever seen a man, woman, or child who  wasn't eating an egg or just going to eat an egg or just coming away  from eating an egg? I tell you, the good old egg is the foundation of"]]]
