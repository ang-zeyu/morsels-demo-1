[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34607"],[0,"Woodcraft and Camping (#6)"],[1,"head logs  define the limits of your forest dwelling; within which you may pile  fragrant hemlock browse as thick as you please, and renew it from day to  day. It is the perfect camp.    You may put it up with less care and labor, and make it do very well.  But I have tried to explain how to do it in the best manner; to make it  all sufficient for an entire season. And it takes longer to tell it on  paper than to do it.    When I go to the woods with a partner, and we arrive at our camping  ground, I like him to get his fishing rig together, and start out for a  half day's exercise with his favorite flies, leaving me to make the camp  according to my own notions of woodcraft. If he will come back about  dusk with a few pounds of trout, I will have a pleasant camp and a  bright fire for him. And if he has enjoyed wading an icy stream more  than I have making the camp--he has had a good day.    Perhaps it may not be out of place to say that the camp, made as above,  calls for fifteen bits of timber, posts, rods, etc., a few shingle  nails, and some six-penny wrought nails, with a paper of six-ounce  tacks. Nails and tacks will weigh about five ounces, and are always  useful. In tacking the cloth, turn the raw edge in until you have four  thicknesses, as a single thickness is apt to tear. If you desire to  strike camp, it takes about ten minutes to draw and save all the nails  and tacks, fold the cloth smoothly, and deposit the whole in your  knapsack. If you wish to get up a shelter tent on fifteen minutes'  notice, cut and sharpen a twelve-foot pole as for the Indian camp, stick  one end in the ground, the other in the rough bark of a large  tree--hemlock is best--hang the cloth on the pole, fasten the sides to  rods, and the rods to the ground with inverted crotches, and your  shelter tent is ready for you to creep under.    [Illustration: SHANTY-TENT AND CAMP-FIRE]    The above description of the shanty-tent may seem a trifle elaborate,  but I hope it is plain. The affair weighs just three pounds, and it  takes a skillful woodsman about three hours of easy work to put it in  the shape described. Leaving out some of the work, and only aiming to  get it up in square shape as quickly as possible, I can put it up in an  hour. The shanty as it should be, is shown in the illustration very  fairly. And the shape of the cloth when spread out, is shown in the  diagram on page 26. On the whole, it is the best form of close-side tent  I have found. It admits of a bright fire in front, without which a  forest camp is just no camp at all to me. I have suffered enough in  close, dark, cheerless, damp tents.    More than thirty years ago I became disgusted with the clumsy, awkward,  comfortless affairs that, under many different forms, went under the  name of camps. Gradually I came to make a study of \"camping out.\" It  would take too much time and space, should I undertake to describe all  the different styles and forms I have tried. But I will mention a few of  the best and worst.    [Sidenote: _Other Camps_]    The old Down East \"coal cabin\" embodied the principle of the Indian  camp. The frame was simply two strong crotches set firmly in the ground  at a distance of eight feet apart, and interlocking at top. These  supported a stiff ridge-pole fifteen feet long, the small end sharpened  and set in the ground. Refuse boards, shooks, stakes, etc., were placed  thickly from the ridge-pole to the ground; a thick layer of straw was  laid over these, and the whole was covered a foot thick with earth and  sods, well beaten down. A stone wall five feet high at back and sides  made a most excellent fireplace; and these cabins were weather-proof and  warm, even in zero weather. But they were too cumbersome, and included  too much labor for the ordinary hunter and angler. Also, they were open  to the objection, that while wide enough in front, they ran down to a  dismal, cold peak at the far end. Remembering, however, the many  pleasant winter nights I had passed with the coal-burners, I bought a  supply of oil-cloth and rigged it on the same principle. It was a  partial success, and I used it for one season. But that cold, peaked,  dark space was always back of my head, and it seemed like an iceberg. It  was in vain that I tied a handkerchief about my head, or drew a stocking  leg over it. That miserable, icy angle was always there. And it would  only shelter one man anyhow. When winter drove me out of the woods I  gave it to an enthusiastic young friend, bought some more oil-cloth, and  commenced a shanty-tent that was meant to be perfect. A good many  leisure hours were spent in cutting and sewing that shanty, which proved  rather a success. It afforded a perfect shelter for a space 7x4 feet,  but was a trifle heavy to pack, and the glazing began to crack and peel  off in a short time. I made another and larger one of stout drilling,  soaked in lime-water and alum; and this was all that could be asked when  put up properly on a frame. But, the sides and ends being sewed to the  roof made it unhandy to use as a shelter, when shelter was needed on  short notice. So I ripped the back ends of the sides loose from the  flap, leaving it, when spread out, as shown in the diagram. This was  better; when it was necessary to make some sort of shelter in short  order, it could be done with a single pole as used in the Indian camp,  laying the tent across the pole, and using a few tacks to keep it in  place at sides and center. This can be done in ten minutes, and makes a  shelter-tent that will turn a heavy rain for hours.    [Illustration]    On the whole, for all kinds of weather, the shanty-tent is perhaps the  best style of camp to be had at equal expense and trouble.    For a summer camp, however, I have finally come to prefer the simple  lean-to or shed roof. It is the lightest, simplest and cheapest of all  cloth devices for camping out, and I have found it sufficient for all  weathers from June until the fall of the leaves. It is only a sheet of  strong cotton cloth 9x7 feet, and soaked in lime and alum-water as the  other. The only labor in making it is sewing two breadths of sheeting  together. It needs no hemming, binding, loops or buttons, but is to be  stretched on a frame as described for the brush shanty, and held in  place with tacks. The one I have used for two seasons cost sixty cents,  and weighs 2-1/4 pounds. It makes a good shelter for a party of three;  and if it be found a little too breezy for cool nights, a sufficient  windbreak can be made by driving light stakes at the sides and weaving  in a siding of hemlock boughs.    [Sidenote: _Sparks_]    Lastly, whatever cloth structure you may elect to use for a camp, do not  fail to cover the roof with a screen of green boughs before building  your camp-fire. Because there will usually be one fellow in camp who has  a penchant for feeding the fire with old mulchy deadwood and brush, for  the fun of watching the blaze, and the sparks that are prone to fly  upward; forgetting that the blazing cinders are also prone to drop  downward on the roof of the tent, burning holes in it.    I have spoken of some of the best camps I know. The worst ones are the A  and wall tents, with all closed camps in which one is required to  seclude himself through the hours of sleep in damp and darkness, utterly  cut off from the cheerful, healthful light and warmth of the camp-fire.          Chapter IV         CAMP-FIRES AND THEIR IMPORTANCE--THE WASTEFUL WRONG WAY THEY       ARE USUALLY MADE, AND THE RIGHT WAY TO MAKE THEM      Hardly second in importance to a warm, dry camp, is the camp-fire. In  point of fact, the warmth, dryness, and healthfulness of a forest camp  are mainly dependent on the way the fire is managed and kept up. No  asthmatic or consumptive patient ever regained health by dwelling in a  close, damp tent. I once camped for a week in a wall tent, with a  Philadelphia party, and in cold weather. We had a little sheet iron  fiend, called a camp-stove. When well fed with bark, knots and chips, it  would get red hot, and, heaven knows, give out heat enough. By the time  we were sound asleep, it would subside; and we would presently awake  with chattering teeth to kindle her up again, take a smoke and a nip,  turn in for another nap--to awaken again half frozen. It was a poor  substitute for the open camp and bright fire. An experience of fifty  years convinces me that a large percentage of the benefit obtained by  invalids from camp life is attributable to the open camp and  well-managed camp-fire. And the latter is usually handled in a way that  is too sad, too wasteful; in short, badly botched. For instance.    [Sidenote: _The \"Guides' Camp\"_]    It happened in the summer of '81 that I was making a canoe trip in the  Northern Wilderness, and as Raquette Lake is the largest and about the  most interesting lake in the North Woods, I spent about a week paddling,  fishing, etc. I made my headquarters at Ed. Bennett's woodland hostelry,  \"Under the Hemlocks.\" As the hotel was filled with men, women and  crying children, bitten to agony by punkies and mosquitoes, I chose to  spread my blanket in a well-made bark shanty, which a sign-board in  black and white said was the \"Guides' Camp.\"    And this camp was a very popular institution. Here it was that every  evening, when night had settled down on forest and lake, the guests of  the hotel would gather to lounge on the bed of fresh balsam browse,  chat, sing and enjoy the huge camp-fire.    No woodland hotel will long remain popular that does not keep up a  bright, cheery, out-o'-door fire. And the fun of it--to an old  woodsman--is in noting how like a lot of school children they all act  about the fire. Ed. Bennett had a man, a North Woods trapper, in his  employ, whose chief business was to furnish plenty of wood for the  guides' camp, and start a good fire every evening by sundown.

And after that Moses began to take  measures for the education of his daughter, who was to be brought up  according to old established usage. Esther learned to cook, to pray, and  to count--that was enough for the house, for heaven, and for life. And  what could her father have taught her in addition to this? Polish and  German, perhaps? She could speak both languages, and he, like every  other Jew in Barnow, regarded reading and writing as needless luxuries  for a girl. He had learned both in order that he might write his  business letters, and understand the book of civil law; his daughter did  not need to do either. Besides that, would greater knowledge make her a  better or happier woman? \"When a Jewish girl knows how to pray\"--has  come to be a proverb among these stern-natured men--\"she needs nothing  more to make her good and happy!\" And yet little Esther was to learn to  read German, and much more besides!...    \"It was in an hour of weakness,\" murmurs the old man, as he rises with  the rest of the congregation to take part in the long prayer, during  which all must stand--\"of weakness and folly that I gave way. Woe unto  me for consenting, and cursed be he who led me astray!\"    How can you say so, Moses Freudenthal! However much your misfortunes may  have enlightened you, and taught you to know your own heart, you can not  even yet see that it was a sin you were committing in shutting out the  light of the world from your child, and that you did right when you  consented to permit another to reveal it to her. Oh, how you sin, old  man, when, hardening your heart in egotism and ignorance, you say, \"That  was the cause of her misfortunes and of mine also! From that time  forward her mind was poisoned, and turned away from me and my God!  Cursed, cursed be that hour!\"    ... But all this happened on a warm bright summer evening thirteen years  ago.... The moonlight lay on the houses and streets, and the very dust  on the road seemed to glitter like silver. Moses Freudenthal was sitting  on the stone seat at his door lost in thought. He felt strangely soft  hearted that evening; for whether he would or not, he could not help  living over again in memory the occurrences of his former life, and  thinking of his dead wife Rosele. His daughter, who was now nine years  old, was sitting beside him, gazing wide-eyed into the moonlit night.  Suddenly a man came up the street and stood looking at them. Moses did  not at once recognize him, but little Esther sprang to her feet with a  cry of joy--\"Uncle Schlome! How glad I am that you have come to see us,  Uncle Schlome!\"    Moses now recognized the stranger, and rose in astonishment. What did  Schlome Gruenstein want with him, and how had his daughter become  acquainted with the \"Meschumed?\" He was Rosele's brother, and had been  his playfellow in his boyhood, but Moses had not spoken to him for  twenty years; for a pious Jew could hold no communication with a  Meschumed, an apostate from the faith--and Schlome was an apostate in  the eyes of the Ghetto. And yet the pale, delicate-looking man, with the  gentle dreamy expression, had always remained a Jew, and had lived  quietly and peacefully among his neighbors, spending his wealth in works  of charity and mercy. But the name and the shame had cleaved to him from  his youth upward.    His had been a strange boyhood. As he had been a shy, thoughtful child,  living only in his books, and showing no talent except in literary  things, his father determined to make him a Rabbi. Schlome was pleased  with this decision, and studied so hard to fit himself for his future  calling that he not only injured his health, but soon got beyond his  teacher. The delicate boy was consumed by an unquenchable thirst for  knowledge. And this thirst became the cause of his destruction, the  curse of his life. By means of money and passionate entreaties combined,  he induced the Christian schoolmaster of the place to teach him at night  and in secret. Thus he learned High German, the forbidden and much-hated  language of the Gentiles around him, and also \"Christian theology.\" Of  the latter branch of learning the schoolmaster himself knew very little;  so he helped out his ignorance by lending his unwearied pupil many books  belonging to the Dominican library, and this he did before Schlome had  got over all the difficulties of learning to read. In this way the boy  read all manner of strange books, one on the top of the other, and often  enough, no doubt, put sufficiently curious interpretations upon them. At  last one day a book fell into his hands, which nearly drove him mad. The  form and tone were well known to him, for did they not enforce obedience  to the holy Thora (Law)? But the spirit that breathed in its pages was  another and--the youth's very blood seemed to freeze in his veins--a  milder and better than what he had known. For this book was the New  Testament. Its teaching seemed to him like the mild beauty of a spring  day, and yet his hair stood on end with horror. This, then, was the  idol-worship of the Christians,--this was the history of the life and  labors of that Man whom his father crucified, and from whose likeness he  had been taught to turn away his head in hatred and contempt! The blow  was too severe. Schlome became very ill, and lay for many weeks  dangerously sick of a fever. Often and often in his delirium the  unconscious youth wept and talked of the pale Nazarene, of the cross,  and of that ill-starred book. His parents and neighbors listened to his  ravings in horror; they searched into their cause, and at length  discovered Schlome's secret studies. Soon afterward a strange rumor was  circulated in the Ghetto, to the effect that Schlome Gruenstein had  wished to become a Christian, and that as a punishment for this sin God  had visited him with madness. In course of time the youth recovered, and  went about among his brethren in the faith as usual; but henceforth he  seemed paler, shyer, and more depressed than before. No one knew what  inward conflicts he had to wage; but every child in the Jewish quarter  called him a Meschumed, and told how he had sworn a holy oath to his  father that he would only remain a Jew on two conditions--first, that  he might buy and read whatever books he chose; and second, that he might  remain unmarried. He kept his oath, even when the death of his parents  made him rich and independent. Thus he passed his life in the narrow,  gloomy Ghetto. He had only one friend, David Blum, a man who devoted his  life to tending the sick, and whose own story was both strange and sad.  But then he did not make him his friend till late in life, and lost him  soon afterward; for David Blum died, whether of low fever or of a broken  heart it were difficult to say. The Meschumed mourned his loss deeply.  It seemed to him as though a bit of his own heart had been buried with  his friend. And yet these men differed from each other as much in  character as in the circumstances that had moulded their lives. David  was strong and high-hearted, but quick-tempered and fantastic, so that  he broke down once for all when fate aimed a heavy blow at him; Schlome,  on the contrary, was weak and gentle, and endowed with a great power of  endurance which enabled him to bend under the blows of fate instead of  being broken by them. Thus he lived on in the midst of men and yet  terribly alone--the poor even hesitated to accept charity at his hands.  Still he loved all men, but especially children; and these alone  returned his affection, although they could seldom show it from fear of  their parents. He almost idolized little Esther, the only child of his  dead sister; and she loved him better than her grave, reserved father.    Such was the man who came up to the bench on which Moses Freudenthal and  his daughter were seated on that lovely summer evening.    \"I want to speak to you, brother,\" he said, as Moses rose and looked at  him with a coldly questioning gaze. He then requested the child to go to  bed, and after she had left them, continued: \"I want to speak to you  about many important things. Sit down beside me.... You needn't be  afraid! There isn't a creature to be seen in the street....\"    Moses sat down hesitatingly.    \"It is about the child,\" resumed the Meschumed. \"I have been thinking  long and earnestly about her, and when I chanced to see you this evening  as I was passing, I determined to say what I had to say at once. You  see, brother, the child is growing a big girl. She will be beautiful one  day; but what is more to the purpose at present, is, that her goodness  and intelligence are surprising in one so young. You have scarcely any  idea of the sort of questions she asks, and of the kind of thoughts that  little head contains--you'd hardly believe it, brother.\"    \"And how do you know?\" interrupted Moses, in a harsh stern voice. \"Did I  ever give you leave?...\"    \"Don't let us discuss that point, if you please,\" replied Schlome,  raising his hand in deprecation, \"don't let us discuss that point. I  could answer you boldly that Esther is my sister's child, and that I  have a right to love and care for her. But I will not answer you thus;  we have been kept apart long enough by angry words. And even if you tell  me that I am a stranger in your house, and by my own fault, too, I will  answer you nothing. Love is not alone induced by ties of blood, and the  world is not so rich in love that one can afford to cast any aside.  But--it isn't that you mean. You fear danger for your child; you fear  that I should try to undermine her faith. You feel less confidence in me  than in the lowest servant in your house.\"    He ceased, but Moses made no reply. And yet the hard man's heart was  really touched when he once more heard the voice that had been so dear  to him in his boyhood. But he shook off his emotion, and when Schlome  repeated"]]]
