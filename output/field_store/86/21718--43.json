No more lupin skins and whiffs of fried polenta, but food enough and to  spare; such food as he had not dreamt of before, and always as much as  he could eat.    Filippo was as happy as the day was long. He had always been a merry  little soul even when life had been hard and food scarce, and now he  would not have changed his lot with the saints in Paradise.    But the good brothers began to think it was time Filippo should do  something besides play and eat.    'Let us see what the child is fit for,' they said.    So Filippo was called in to sit on the bench with the boys and learn  his A B C. That was dreadfully dull work. He could never remember the  names of those queer signs. Their shapes he knew quite well, and he  could draw them carefully in his copy-book, but their names were too  much for him. And as to the Latin which the good monks tried to teach  him, they might as well have tried to teach a monkey.    All the brightness faded from Filippo's face the moment a book was put  before him, and he looked so dull and stupid that the brothers were in  despair. Then for a little things seemed to improve. Filippo suddenly  lost his stupid look as he bent over the pages, and his eyes were  bright with interest.    'Aha!' said one brother nudging the other, 'the boy has found his  brains at last.'    But great indeed was their wrath and disappointment when they looked  over his shoulder. Instead of learning his lessons, Filippo had been  making all sorts of queer drawings round the margin of the page. The  A's and B's had noses and eyes, and looked out with little grinning  faces. The long music notes had legs and arms and were dancing about  like little black imps. Everything was scribbled over with the naughty  little figures.    This was really too much, and Filippo must be taken at once before the  prior.    'What, in disgrace again?' asked the kindly old man. 'What has the  child done now?'    'We can teach him nothing,' said the brother, shaking a severe finger  at Filippo, who hung his head. 'He cannot even learn his A B C. And  besides, he spoils his books, ay, and even the walls and benches, by  drawing such things as these upon them.' And the indignant monk held  out the book where all those naughty figures were dancing over the page.    The prior took the book and looked at it closely.    'What makes thee do these things?' he asked the boy, who stood first on  one foot and then on the other, twisting his rope in his fingers.    At the sound of the kind voice, the boy looked up, and his face broke  into a smile.    'Indeed, I cannot help it, Father,' he said. 'It is the fault of  these,' and he spread out his ten little brown fingers.    The prior laughed.    'Well,' he said, 'we will not turn thee out, though they do say thou  wilt never make a monk. Perhaps we may teach these ten little rascals  to do good work, even if we cannot put learning into that round head of  thine.'    So instead of books and Latin lessons, the good monks tried a different  plan. Filippo was given as a pupil to good Brother Anselmo, whose work  it was to draw the delicate pictures and letters for the convent  prayer-books.    This was a different kind of lesson, indeed. Filippo's eyes shone with  eagerness as he bent over his work and tried to copy the beautiful  lines and curves which the master set for him.    There were other boys in the class as well, and Filippo looked at their  work with great admiration. One boy especially, who was bigger than  Filippo, and who had a kind merry face, made such beautiful copies that  Filippo always tried to sit next him if possible. Very soon the boys  became great friends.    Diamante, as the elder boy was called, was pleased to be admired so  much by the little new pupil; but as time went on, his pride in his own  work grew less as he saw with amazement how quickly Filippo's little  brown fingers learned to draw straighter lines and more beautiful  curves than any he could manage. Brother Anselmo, too, would watch the  boy at work, and his saintly old face beamed with pleasure as he looked.    'He will pass us all, and leave us far behind, this child who is too  stupid to learn his A B C,' he would say, and his face shone with  unselfish joy.    Then when the boys grew older, they were allowed to go into the church  and watch those wonderful frescoes, which grew under the hand of the  great awkward painter, 'Ugly Tom,' as he was called.    Together Filippo and Diamante stood and watched with awe, learning  lessons there which the good father had not been able to teach. Then  they would begin to put into practice what they had learned, and try to  copy in their own pictures the work of the great master.    'Thou hast the knack of it, Filippo,' Diamante would say as he looked  with envy at the figures Filippo drew so easily.    'Thy pictures are also good,' Filippo would answer quickly, 'and thou  thyself art better than any one else in the convent.'    There was no complaint now of Filippo's dullness. He soon learned all  that the painter-monks could teach him, and as years passed on the  prior would rub his hands in delight to think that here was an artist,  one of themselves, who would soon be able to paint the walls of the  church and convent, and make them as famous as the convent of San Marco  had been made famous by its angelical painter.    Then one day he called Filippo to him.    'My son,' he said, 'you have learned well, and it is time now to turn  your work to some account. Go into the cloister where the walls have  been but newly whitewashed, and let us see what kind of pictures thou  canst paint.'    With burning cheeks and shining eyes, Filippo began his work. Day after  day he stood on the scaffolding, with his brown robe pinned back and  his bare arm moving swiftly as he drew figure after figure on the  smooth white wall.    He did not pause to think what he would draw, the figures seemed to  grow like magic under his touch. There were the monks in their brown  and white robes, fat and laughing, or lean and anxious-minded. There  were the people who came to say their prayers in church, little  children clinging to their mothers' skirts, beggars and rich folks,  even the stray dog that sometimes wandered in. Yes, and the pretty  girls who laughed and talked in whispers. He drew them all, just as he  had often seen them. Then, when the last piece of wall was covered, he  stopped his work.    The news soon spread through all the convent that Brother Filippo had  finished his picture, and all the monks came hurrying to see. The  scaffolding was taken down, and then they all stood round, gazing with  round eyes and open mouths. They had never seen anything like it  before, and at first there was silence except for one long drawn 'ah-h.'    Then one by one they began to laugh and talk, and point with eager,  excited fingers. 'Look,' cried one, 'there is Brother Giovanni; I would  know his smile among a hundred.'    'There is that beggar who comes each day to ask for soup,' cried  another.    'And there is his dog,' shouted a third.    'Look at the maid who kneels in front,' said Fra Diamante in a hushed  voice, 'is she not as fair as any saint?'    Then suddenly there was silence, and the brothers looked ashamed of the  noise they had been making, as the prior himself looked down on them  from the steps above.    'What is all this?' he asked. And his voice sounded grave and  displeased as he looked from the wall to the crowd of eager monks. Then  he turned to Filippo. 'Are these the pictures I ordered thee to paint?'  he asked. 'Is this the kind of painting to do honour to God and to our  Church? Will these mere human figures help men to remember the saints,  teach them to look up to heaven, or help them with their prayers?  Quick, rub them out, and paint your pictures for heaven and not for  earth.'    Filippo hung his head, the crowd of admiring monks swiftly disappeared,  and he was left to begin his work all over again.    It was so difficult for Filippo to keep his thoughts fixed on heaven,  and not to think of earth. He did so love the merry world, and his  fingers, those same ten brown rascals which had got him into trouble  when he was a child, always longed to draw just the faces that he saw  every day. The pretty face of the little maid kneeling at her prayers  was so real and so delightful, and the Madonna and angels seemed so  solemn and far off.    Still no one would have pictures which did not tell of saints and  angels, so he must paint the best he could. After all, it was easy to  put on wings and golden haloes until the earthly things took on a  heavenly look.    But the convent life grew daily more and more wearisome now to Filippo.  The world, which he had been so willing to give up for a piece of good  white bread when he was eight years old, now seemed full of all the  things he loved best.    The more he thought of it, the more he longed to see other places  outside the convent walls, and other faces besides the monks and the  people who came to church.    And so one dark night, when all the brothers were asleep and the bells  had just rung the midnight hour, Fra Filippo stole out of his cell,  unlocked the convent door, and ran swiftly out into the quiet street.    How good it felt to be free! The very street itself seemed like an old  friend, welcoming him with open arms. On and on he ran until he came to  the city gates of San Frediano, there to wait until he could slip  through unnoticed when the gates were opened at the dawn of day. Then  on again until Florence and the convent were left behind and the whole  world lay before him.    There was no difficulty about living, for the people gave him food and  money, and good-natured countrymen would stop their carts and offer him  a lift along the straight white dusty roads. So by and by he reached  Ancona and saw for the first time the sea.    Filippo gazed and gazed,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5307"],[0,"The Letters of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart — Volume 01 (#6)"],[1,"fuori della finestra vedo la casa dove lei abito  quando lei fu in Venezia.

I write  this in the house of Signor Wider, who is an excellent man and exactly  what you wrote to me, yesterday we finished the Carnival in his house.  We supped there and then danced, and went afterwards, in company with  the 'pearls,' to the new masquerade, which amused me immensely.

My  compliments to your father and mother, brothers and sisters, and all my  friends. Adieu!\"]        31.    Venice, Feb. 20, 1771.    I AM still well, and, thank God, in the land of the living. Madame de'  Amicis has been singing at S. Benedetto. Say to Herr Johannes that the  Widerischen Berlein family are constantly speaking of him (particularly  Madlle. Catherine), so he must soon return to Vienna to encounter the  attacca--that is, in order to become a true Venetian, you must allow  yourself to be bumped down on the ground. They wished to do this to me  also, but though seven women tried it, the whole seven together did not  succeed in throwing me down. Addio!    The travellers arrived again at home towards the end of March, 1771. The  marriage of the Archduke Ferdinand with the Princess of Modena,  which took place in the October of that year, was attended with great  festivities, and recalled the father and son to Italy in the course of  a few months, Wolfgang having received a command from the Empress Maria  Theresa to compose a dramatic serenata in honor of these nuptials.        32.    Verona, August 18, 1771.    DEAREST SISTER,--    I have not slept more than half an hour, for I don't like to sleep  after eating. You may hope, believe, think, be of opinion, cherish the  expectation, desire, imagine, conceive, and confidently suppose, that we  are in good health; but I can tell you so to a certainty. Wish Herr von  Heffner a happy journey from me, and ask him if he has seen Annamindl?    [Wolfgang, who was then fifteen, had taken advantage of his leisure  during their short stay in Salzburg to fall in love for the first time.  We shall find frequent allusions to this subject. See also No. 25.]        33.    Milan, August 23, 1771.    MY VERY DEAR SISTER,--    We suffered much from heat in the course of our journey, and the dust  constantly dried us up so impertinently that we should have been choked,  or died of thirst, if we had not been too sensible for that. For a whole  month past (say the Milanese) there has been no rain here; to-day a  slight drizzle began, but the sun has now come out again, and it is once  more very warm. What you promised me (you well know my meaning, you  kind creature!) don't fail to perform, I entreat. I shall be indeed very  grateful to you. I am at this moment actually panting from the heat--I  tear open my waistcoat! Addio--good-bye!    WOLFGANG.    Above us we have a violinist, below us is another, next to us a  singing-master, who gives lessons, and, in the room opposite, a  hautboy-player. This is famous for a composer--it inspires so many fine  thoughts.        34.    Milan, August 31, 1771.    MY DEAREST SISTER,--    We are quite well, thank God! I have been eating quantities of fine  pears, peaches, and melons in your place. My greatest amusement is to  talk by signs to the dumb, which I can do to perfection. Herr Hasse [the  celebrated opera composer] arrived here yesterday, and to-day we are  going to pay him a visit. We only received the book of the Serenata  last Thursday. [Footnote: It was \"Ascanio in Alba\" that Wolfgang got to  compose for Milan; and it was this music which made Hasse exclaim, \"This  boy will cause us all to be forgotten.\"] I have very little to write  about. Do not, I entreat, forget about THE ONE OTHER, where no other can  ever be. You understand me, I know.        35.    Milan, Sept. 13, 1771.    DEAR SISTER,--    I write only for writing's sake. It is indeed very inconvenient, because  I have a severe cold. Say to Fraulein W. von Molk that I rejoice at the  thoughts of Salzburg, in the hope that I may again receive the same  kind of present for the minuets which was bestowed on me at a similar  concert. She knows all about it.        36.    Milan, Sept. 21, 1771.    I AM well, God be praised! I can't write much. 1st, I have nothing to  say. 2d, my fingers ache from writing. I often whistle an air, but no  one responds. Only two arias of the Serenata are still wanting, and  then it will be finished. I have no longer any fancy for Salzburg; I am  afraid I might go mad too. [He had heard that several persons there had  lost their reason.]        37.    Milan, Oct. 5, 1771.    I AM in good health, but always sleepy. Papa has snatched from my pen  all that I had to write about, which is, that he has already written  everything. Signora Gabrielli is here, and we are soon going to see her,  as we wish to become acquainted with all distinguished singers.        38.    Milan, Oct. 26, 1771.    MY work being now completed, I have more time to write, but have nothing  to say, as papa has written you all I could have said. I am well, thank  God! but have no news, except that in the lottery the numbers 35, 59,  60, 61, and 62 have turned up prizes, so if we had selected these we  should have won; but as we did not put in at all we neither won nor  lost, but only laughed at those who did the latter. The two arias  encored in the Serenata were those of Manzuoli, and Girelli, the prima  donna, I hope you may be well amused in Triebenbach with shooting, and  (weather permitting) with walking.        39.    Milan, Nov. 2, 1771.    Papa says that Herr Kerschbaumer travels with profit and observation,  and we can testify that he conducts himself very judiciously; at all  events he can give a more satisfactory account of his journey than some  of his friends, one of whom said that he could not see Paris properly  because the houses there were too high. To-day Hasse's opera is to be  given; as papa, however, is not going, I can't go either. [FOOTNOTE:  Hasse had also a festal opera to compose, but Leopold Mozart writes, \"I  am sorry to say that Wolfgang's Serenata has totally eclipsed Hasse's  opera.\"] Fortunately I know all the airs thoroughly by heart, so I can  see and hear them in my own thoughts at home.        40.    Milan, Nov. 24, 1771.    DEAREST SISTER,--    Herr Manzuoli, the musico, who has always been considered and esteemed  as the best of his class, has in his old age given a proof of his folly  and arrogance. He was engaged at the opera for the sum of 500 gigliati  (ducats), but as no mention was made in the contract of the Serenata, he  demanded 500 ducats more for singing in it, making 1000. The court only  sent him 700 and a gold box, (and enough too, I think,) but he returned  the 700 ducats and the box, and went away without anything. I don't know  what the result of this history will be--a bad one, I fear!        41.    Milan, Nov. 30, 1771.    That you may not suppose I am ill, I write you a few lines. I saw four  fellows hanged in the Dom Platz. They hang here just as they do in  Lyons.    We now find the father and son once more in Salzburg, in the middle of  December, 1771. Archbishop Sigismund died, and on the 14th of March,  1772, Archbishop Hieronymus was elected, who was destined to cause much  sorrow to Mozart. Soon after, in honor of the procession and homage of  the new prince, he composed the allegorical azione teatrale \"Il sogno  di Scipione.\" In October he resumed his travels, having undertaken the  scrittura for the approaching Carnivals both at Milan and at Venice.        42.    Bologna, Oct. 28, 1772.    We have got to Botzen already. Already? rather not till now. I am  hungry, thirsty, sleepy, and lazy, but I am quite well. We saw  the monastery in Hall, and I played the organ there. When you see  Nadernannerl, tell her I spoke to Herr Brindl (her lover), and he  charged me to give her his regards. I hope that you kept your promise  and went last Sunday to D----N----[in cipher]. Farewell! write me some  news. Botzen--a pig-sty!        43.    Milan, Nov. 7, 1772.    Don't be startled at seeing my writing instead of papa's. These are the  reasons: first, we are at Herr von Oste's, and the Herr Baron Christiani  is also here, and they have so much to talk about, that papa cannot  possibly find time to write; and, secondly, he is too lazy. We arrived  here at 4 o'clock this afternoon, and are both well. All our good  friends are in the country or at Mantua, except Herr von Taste and his  wife, who send you and my sister their compliments. Herr Misliweczeck [a  young composer of operas from Paris] is still here. There is not a word  of truth either in the Italian war, which is so eagerly discussed in  Germany, or in the castles here being fortified. Forgive my bad writing.    Address your letters direct to us, for it is not the custom here, as in  Germany, to carry the letters round; we are obliged to go ourselves to  fetch them on post-days. There is nothing new here; we expect news from  Salzburg.    Not having a word more to say, I must conclude. Our kind regards to all  our friends. We kiss mamma 1,000,000,000 times (I have no room for more  noughts); and as for my sister, I would rather embrace her in persona  than in imagination.        44.    CARISSIMA SORELLA,--    Spero che voi sarete stata dalla Signora, che voi gia sapete. Vi prego,  se la videte di farla un Complimento da parte mia."]]]
