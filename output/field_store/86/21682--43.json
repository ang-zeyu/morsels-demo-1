Nor are the objections often raised in a new  community against the importation of the last, heard against the first.  A wide experience has shown that children are eagerly sought by farmers,  and are \"placed out\" with ease. The remarkable success Dr. Barnardo has  had in Canada, to which country he has sent between twelve and thirteen  thousand children, has proved this. The number of failures has been only  about 1 per cent. Nor is this a haphazard statement. Watch and ward have  been kept over the fortunes of the youngsters. They have been carefully  placed after due negotiation and correspondence, and each has been  reported upon after settlement. The success obtained is best gauged by  the ever-increasing number of applications for just such boys and girls  as have been previously \"located.\" Every year of late years there have  been three great parties sent across the Atlantic, and the cry is ever  for more to come. In spring, in midsummer, and in \"the fall,\" the  children have been taken out. Entrained on arriving in Canada, the  farmers have come down to meet them at the various stations, and they  have been at once taken to their new homes, where they have almost  uniformly given satisfaction to their employers. They are growing up  hearty, happy Canadians, and many hundred letters arrive from them at  Stepney where they were trained, telling how they are \"getting on.\"  Every penny spent on their teaching in England has had a double return  in making room when they go for another boy or girl to be similarly  brought up, and in providing Canada and Britain with a small citizen  \"cut out of whole cloth,\" as the Americans say, ready to fight for the  Empire whether in Canada, in Europe, or in Africa.    Now though the East End philanthropist has the greatest number from  which to draw his recruits, he does not stand alone. There is Mr.  Quarrier, near Alloa in Scotland, who is doing similar work. In London  no child who knocks at the door of the many institutions is refused.  Each is admitted, and the change in a year is marvellous. The child has  already become a good little mechanic or workman of some kind or other.  He is cleanly, disciplined, and has many an example ahead of him and  around him, to make him follow in the good road on which he has been  set. In London Â£5000 is now asked for by Dr. Barnardo for the African  scheme. The greatest care is to be taken to watch over the children sent  out. They are to be carefully placed where climate and water is good,  and there, after a course of instruction in all that is most useful in  South Africa, they will be placed out as in Canada with farmers, with  miners, with mechanics, and with any who want them, if the employers can  only show that a good home is provided. But until a good home is  provided by the Colonists, they are to have a good home out there of  their own. There are opportunities of education in the local farming  pursuits that \"make the mouth water,\" to have children thus placed. The  pastoral work of dairying, as well as the healthy occupations of  gardening and produce-raising will all be studied and taught on the  spot. What a happy change from the crowded thoroughfares of the east of  London! And if these children succeed, as they assuredly will, why  should not the Government do a little useful work of the same kind as  that undertaken by Dr. Barnardo and by Mr. Quarrier on its own account?  Why not utilise for Africa some of the industrial school children? They,  if settled together, and sent to English-speaking farmers, will not  forget that they are English. They will not make their farms when they  get them, after their useful school career, resound only with the  expressive but illiterate \"Taal\" tongue. Good Saxon (even if shorn of a  few h's) will be heard in their homesteads in the future. They will add  a good reinforcement to those who know that freedom is not to be got by  racial separation, and the condemnation of everything British. They will  permeate the districts where they grow up to manhood and womanhood with  the British idea and practice of common obedience to law and justice as  the best security for freedom.

SOUTH AFRICAN FEDERATION    VIEWS OF COLONIAL PREMIERS    BY E. B. OSBORN    _Author of \"Greater Canada\"_      I    Unification has always been an ideal of South African statesmen, and  twice, at least, it has been within measurable distance of realisation.  In 1858 Sir George Grey, who had federated the New Zealand settlements  despite the intensity of their local jealousies, promulgated the first  practical scheme of South African Federation. So well had he ruled the  Kaffir tribes on the eastern border of Cape Colony, that the Free State,  weary of warfare with the Basutos, made overtures for a federal  alliance, and the proposition of the Volksraad was actually laid before  the Cape Parliament by Sir George Grey, before the opinion of the  British Ministry in regard to his scheme of federation on New Zealand  lines and their sanction for the course actually pursued had been  received. Sir George Grey was recalled; though on his arrival off the  British coast he found that he had been reinstated by a new Secretary of  State, the delay led to the loss of an excellent opportunity for  carrying through a measure comparable in importance with the Act which  brought about the legislative union of Upper and Lower Canada.    [Illustration: Photo: Elliott & Fry, London.    HON. SIR W. F. HELY HUTCHINSON,    Governor of Cape Colony.]    For many years after the failure of Sir George Grey's attempt,  unification was a little-regarded counsel of perfection. It is true that  the Duke of Buckingham, Secretary of State for the Colonies in the  Disraeli Ministry of 1868, admitted that it would be politic to consider  seriously any further overtures for a federal alliance from the Boers,  but the Free State was no longer in the mood to make them, our  annexation of Basutoland being resented, and the discovery of diamonds  on its western border in 1867 having created fresh causes of irritation.  When the second Disraeli Ministry came into power, and Lord Carnarvon,  who had collaborated with the Canadian Fathers of Federation (he himself  may be described as the Godfather of the Dominion), undertook the charge  of colonial affairs, the plan proposed by Sir Henry Barkly for a  confederation of South Africa, which should be the logical  consequence of the grant of autonomy to Cape Colony, was cordially  received. Unfortunately the Free State held aloof, the Cape Ministry  remembered only too well the object lessons in anti-Imperialism received  from Lord Carnarvon's predecessors, and a _grain de sable_--the  tactlessness of Mr. Froude--caused a vast amount of friction. Even then,  but for the revival at home of the belief that political quietism and a  policy of non-interference with Colonial affairs would enable Great  Britain to retain the commercial hegemony of the world, Lord Carnarvon's  hopes might have been realised; for he had grasped the all-important  fact that South Africa was, and must always remain, a single-minded  community, whenever the native question was discussed, and that this  unity of opinion was a stronger motive for unification than any or all  of those political or commercial considerations which had already led to  the making of the Dominion, and seemed certain, sooner or later, to  bring about the federation of the Australian Colonies.    In more recent years three men of commanding influence have, each in his  own way, attempted to realise the ideal of unity. Mr. Kruger's attempt  to lay the foundation of a Dutch confederacy, the future greatness of  which would have been based (can we doubt it?) on some form of slavery,  may be dismissed as an instance of the adage, _corruptio optimi  pessima_. Mr. Cecil Rhodes worked for a federation on the model of the  United States; since the Cape was half Dutch, the Transvaal was to be  made half British, and the settlement of Rhodesia was to insure the  preponderance of Imperial ideas in the Union of the future. He saw that  the Boers must be persuaded to co-operate, and for that reason he allied  himself to Mr. Hofmeyr, the unofficial leader of the Boer party in Cape  Colony, who also had his federal scheme. Had the two Boer leaders agreed  to work loyally together in their disloyalty, it is conceivable that  they might have brought about an act of federation in the Boer interest,  and have constitutionally demanded from Great Britain the removal of her  garrisons from South Africa, a naval station at Simon's Bay being  conceded in order to retain the essential measure of Imperial  protection. Such, at any rate, seems to have been Mr. Hofmeyr's dream.  But, instead of being content to widen and deepen the influence of the  Afrikander Bond until such time as the term \"suzerainty\" should have  been interpreted by the heirs to Mr. Gladstone's South African policy,  Mr. Kruger decided to make use of his hoarded armaments, and the future  of his great raid involved the failure of Mr. Hofmeyr's long-meditated  plan of--shall we call it?--constitutional disloyalty. Nevertheless the  twofold ideal of unity, which inspired the acts both of those who  deserved and those who did not deserve to succeed, has survived all  these vicissitudes, and was never more strong than at the present  moment. Indeed it is obvious that not only the British and Dutch  inhabitants of South Africa, but also all responsible politicians and  competent publicists in Canada and Australia, are now of opinion that  complete solutions of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4747"],[0,"The River's End (#6)"],[1," the farther side of the clearing  he turned and looked back. Duggan stood in the open roadway, his hands  thrust deep in his pockets, staring after him. Keith waved his hand,  but Duggan did not respond. He stood like a sphinx, his big red beard  glowing in the early sun, and watched Keith until he was gone.    To Keith this first experiment in the matter of testing an identity was  a disappointment. It was not only disappointing but filled him with  apprehension. It was true that Duggan had not recognized him as John  Keith, BUT NEITHER HAD HE RECOGNIZED HIM AS DERWENT CONNISTON! And  Duggan was not a man to forget in three or four years--or half a  lifetime, for that matter. He saw himself facing a new and unexpected  situation. What if McDowell, like Duggan, saw in him nothing more than  a stranger? The Englishman's last words pounded in his head again like  little fists beating home a truth, \"You win or lose the moment McDowell  first sets his eyes on you.\" They pressed upon him now with a deadly  significance. For the first time he understood all that Conniston had  meant. His danger was not alone in the possibility of being recognized  as John Keith; it lay also in the hazard of NOT being recognized as  Derwent Conniston.    If the thought had come to him to turn back, if the voice of fear and a  premonition of impending evil had urged him to seek freedom in another  direction, their whispered cautions were futile in the thrill of the  greater excitement that possessed him now. That there was a third hand  playing in this game of chance in which Conniston had already lost his  life, and in which he was now staking his own, was something which gave  to Keith a new and entirely unlooked-for desire to see the end of the  adventure. The mental vision of his own certain fate, should he lose,  dissolved into a nebulous presence that no longer oppressed nor  appalled him. Physical instinct to fight against odds, the inspiration  that presages the uncertainty of battle, fired his blood with an  exhilarating eagerness. He was anxious to stand face to face with  McDowell. Not until then would the real fight begin. For the first time  the fact seized upon him that the Englishman was wrong--he would NOT  win or lose in the first moment of the Inspector's scrutiny. In that  moment he could lose--McDowell's cleverly trained eyes might detect the  fraud; but to win, if the game was not lost at the first shot, meant an  exciting struggle. Today might be his Armageddon, but it could not  possess the hour of his final triumph.    He felt himself now like a warrior held in leash within sound of the  enemy's guns and the smell of his powder. He held his old world to be  his enemy, for civilization meant people, and the people were the  law--and the law wanted his life. Never had he possessed a deeper  hatred for the old code of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth  than in this hour when he saw up the valley a gray mist of smoke rising  over the roofs of his home town. He had never conceded within himself  that he was a criminal. He believed that in killing Kirkstone he had  killed a serpent who had deserved to die, and a hundred times he had  told himself that the job would have been much more satisfactory from  the view-point of human sanitation if he had sent the son in the  father's footsteps. He had rid the people of a man not fit to live--and  the people wanted to kill him for it. Therefore the men and women in  that town he had once loved, and still loved, were his enemies, and to  find friends among them again he was compelled to perpetrate a clever  fraud.    He remembered an unboarded path from this side of the town, which  entered an inconspicuous little street at the end of which was a barber  shop. It was the barber shop which he must reach first He was glad that  it was early in the day when he came to the street an hour later, for  he would meet few people. The street had changed considerably. Long,  open spaces had filled in with houses, and he wondered if the  anticipated boom of four years ago had come. He smiled grimly as the  humor of the situation struck him. His father and he had staked their  future in accumulating a lot of \"outside\" property. If the boom had  materialized, that property was \"inside\" now--and worth a great deal.  Before he reached the barber shop he realized that the dream of the  Prince Albertites had come true. Prosperity had advanced upon them in  mighty leaps. The population of the place had trebled. He was a rich  man! And also, it occurred to him, he was a dead one--or would be when  he reported officially to McDowell. What a merry scrap there would be  among the heirs of John Keith, deceased!    The old shop still clung to its corner, which was valuable as \"business  footage\" now. But it possessed a new barber. He was alone. Keith gave  his instructions in definite detail and showed him Conniston's  photograph in his identification book. The beard and mustache must be  just so, very smart, decidedly English, and of military neatness, his  hair cut not too short and brushed smoothly back. When the operation  was over, he congratulated the barber and himself. Bronzed to the color  of an Indian by wind and smoke, straight as an arrow, his muscles  swelling with the brute strength of the wilderness, he smiled at  himself in the mirror when he compared the old John Keith with this new  Derwent Conniston! Before he went out he tightened his belt a notch.  Then he headed straight for the barracks of His Majesty's Royal  Northwest Mounted Police.    His way took him up the main street, past the rows of shops that had  been there four years ago, past the Saskatchewan Hotel and the little  Board of Trade building which, like the old barber shop, still hung to  its original perch at the edge of the high bank which ran precipitously  down to the river. And there, as sure as fate, was Percival Clary, the  little English Secretary! But what a different Percy!    He had broadened out and straightened up. He had grown a mustache,  which was immaculately waxed. His trousers were immaculately creased,  his shoes were shining, and he stood before the door of his now  important office resting lightly on a cane. Keith grinned as he  witnessed how prosperity had bolstered up Percival along with the town.  His eyes quested for familiar faces as he went along. Here and there he  saw one, but for the most part he encountered strangers, lively looking  men who were hustling as if they had a mission in hand. Glaring real  estate signs greeted him from every place of prominence, and  automobiles began to hum up and down the main street that stretched  along the river--twenty where there had been one not so long ago.    Keith found himself fighting to keep his eyes straight ahead when he  met a girl or a woman. Never had he believed fully and utterly in the  angelhood of the feminine until now. He passed perhaps a dozen on the  way to barracks, and he was overwhelmed with the desire to stop and  feast his eyes upon each one of them. He had never been a lover of  women; he admired them, he believed them to be the better part of man,  he had worshiped his mother, but his heart had been neither glorified  nor broken by a passion for the opposite sex. Now, to the bottom of his  soul, he worshiped that dozen! Some of them were homely, some of them  were plain, two or three of them were pretty, but to Keith their  present physical qualifications made no difference. They were white  women, and they were glorious, every one of them! The plainest of them  was lovely. He wanted to throw up his hat and shout in sheer joy. Four  years--and now he was back in angel land! For a space he forgot  McDowell.    His head was in a whirl when he came to barracks. Life was good, after  all. It was worth fighting for, and he was bound fight. He went  straight to McDowell's office. A moment after his knock on the door the  Inspector's secretary appeared.    \"The Inspector is busy, sir,\" he said in response to Keith's inquiry.  \"I'll tell him--\"    \"That I am here on a very important matter,\" advised Keith. \"He will  admit me when you tell him that I bring information regarding a certain  John Keith.\"    The secretary disappeared through an inner door. It seemed not more  than ten seconds before he was back. \"The Inspector will see you, sir.\"    Keith drew a deep breath to quiet the violent beating of his heart. In  spite of all his courage he felt upon him the clutch of a cold and  foreboding hand, a hand that seemed struggling to drag him back. And  again he heard Conniston's dying voice whispering to him, \"REMEMBER,  OLD CHAP, YOU WIN OR LOSE THE MOMENT MCDOWELL FIRST SETS HIS EYES ON  YOU!\"    Was Conniston right?    Win or lose, he would play the game as the Englishman would have played  it. Squaring his shoulders he entered to face McDowell, the cleverest  man-hunter in the Northwest.          V      Keith's first vision, as he entered the office of the Inspector of  Police, was not of McDowell, but of a girl. She sat directly facing him  as he advanced through the door, the light from a window throwing into  strong relief her face and hair. The effect was unusual. She was  strikingly handsome. The sun, giving to the room a soft radiance, lit  up her hair with shimmering gold; her eyes, Keith saw, were a clear and  wonderful gray--and they stared at him as he entered, while the poise  of her body and the tenseness of her face gave evidence of sudden and  unusual emotion. These things Keith observed in a flash; then he turned  toward McDowell.    The Inspector sat behind a table covered with maps and papers, and  instantly Keith was conscious of the penetrating inquisition of his  gaze. He felt, for an instant, the disquieting tremor of the criminal.  Then he met McDowell's eyes squarely. They were, as Conniston had  warned him, eyes that could see through boiler-plate. Of an indefinable  color and deep set behind"]]]
