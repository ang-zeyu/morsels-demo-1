She liked the appearance of her new home  very much.  It seemed to have the atmosphere of Green Gables and the  flavor of her old traditions.    \"I think I would have found Miss Elizabeth Russell a 'kindred spirit,'\"  she murmured when she was alone in her room.  There were two windows in  it; the dormer one looked out on the lower harbor and the sand-bar and  the Four Winds light.        \"A magic casement opening on the foam      Of perilous seas in fairy lands forlorn,\"    quoted Anne softly.  The gable window gave a view of a little  harvest-hued valley through which a brook ran.  Half a mile up the  brook was the only house in sight--an old, rambling, gray one  surrounded by huge willows through which its windows peered, like shy,  seeking eyes, into the dusk.  Anne wondered who lived there; they would  be her nearest neighbors and she hoped they would be nice.  She  suddenly found herself thinking of the beautiful girl with the white  geese.    \"Gilbert thought she didn't belong here,\" mused Anne, \"but I feel sure  she does.  There was something about her that made her part of the sea  and the sky and the harbor.  Four Winds is in her blood.\"    When Anne went downstairs Gilbert was standing before the fireplace  talking to a stranger.  Both turned as Anne entered.    \"Anne, this is Captain Boyd.  Captain Boyd, my wife.\"    It was the first time Gilbert had said \"my wife\" to anybody but Anne,  and he narrowly escaped bursting with the pride of it.  The old captain  held out a sinewy hand to Anne; they smiled at each other and were  friends from that moment.  Kindred spirit flashed recognition to  kindred spirit.    \"I'm right down pleased to meet you, Mistress Blythe; and I hope you'll  be as happy as the first bride was who came here.  I can't wish you no  better than THAT.  But your husband doesn't introduce me jest exactly  right.  'Captain Jim' is my week-a-day name and you might as well begin  as you're sartain to end up--calling me that.  You sartainly are a nice  little bride, Mistress Blythe.  Looking at you sorter makes me feel  that I've jest been married myself.\"    Amid the laughter that followed Mrs. Doctor Dave urged Captain Jim to  stay and have supper with them.    \"Thank you kindly.  'Twill be a real treat, Mistress Doctor.  I mostly  has to eat my meals alone, with the reflection of my ugly old phiz in a  looking-glass opposite for company.  'Tisn't often I have a chance to  sit down with two such sweet, purty ladies.\"    Captain Jim's compliments may look very bald on paper, but he paid them  with such a gracious, gentle deference of tone and look that the woman  upon whom they were bestowed felt that she was being offered a queen's  tribute in a kingly fashion.    Captain Jim was a high-souled, simple-minded old man, with eternal  youth in his eyes and heart.  He had a tall, rather ungainly figure,  somewhat stooped, yet suggestive of great strength and endurance; a  clean-shaven face deeply lined and bronzed; a thick mane of iron-gray  hair falling quite to his shoulders, and a pair of remarkably blue,  deep-set eyes, which sometimes twinkled and sometimes dreamed, and  sometimes looked out seaward with a wistful quest in them, as of one  seeking something precious and lost.  Anne was to learn one day what it  was for which Captain Jim looked.    It could not be denied that Captain Jim was a homely man.  His spare  jaws, rugged mouth, and square brow were not fashioned on the lines of  beauty; and he had passed through many hardships and sorrows which had  marked his body as well as his soul; but though at first sight Anne  thought him plain she never thought anything more about it--the spirit  shining through that rugged tenement beautified it so wholly.    They gathered gaily around the supper table.  The hearth fire banished  the chill of the September evening, but the window of the dining room  was open and sea breezes entered at their own sweet will.  The view was  magnificent, taking in the harbor and the sweep of low, purple hills  beyond.  The table was heaped with Mrs. Doctor's delicacies but the  piece de resistance was undoubtedly the big platter of sea trout.    \"Thought they'd be sorter tasty after travelling,\" said Captain Jim.  \"They're fresh as trout can be, Mistress Blythe.  Two hours ago they  were swimming in the Glen Pond.\"    \"Who is attending to the light tonight, Captain Jim?\" asked Doctor Dave.    \"Nephew Alec.  He understands it as well as I do.  Well, now, I'm real  glad you asked me to stay to supper.  I'm proper hungry--didn't have  much of a dinner today.\"    \"I believe you half starve yourself most of the time down at that  light,\" said Mrs. Doctor Dave severely.  \"You won't take the trouble to  get up a decent meal.\"    \"Oh, I do, Mistress Doctor, I do,\" protested Captain Jim.  \"Why, I live  like a king gen'rally.  Last night I was up to the Glen and took home  two pounds of steak.  I meant to have a spanking good dinner today.\"    \"And what happened to the steak?\" asked Mrs. Doctor Dave.  \"Did you  lose it on the way home?\"    \"No.\"  Captain Jim looked sheepish.  \"Just at bedtime a poor, ornery  sort of dog came along and asked for a night's lodging.  Guess he  belonged to some of the fishermen 'long shore.  I couldn't turn the  poor cur out--he had a sore foot.  So I shut him in the porch, with an  old bag to lie on, and went to bed.  But somehow I couldn't sleep.  Come to think it over, I sorter remembered that the dog looked hungry.\"    \"And you got up and gave him that steak--ALL that steak,\" said Mrs.  Doctor Dave, with a kind of triumphant reproof.    \"Well, there wasn't anything else TO give him,\" said Captain Jim  deprecatingly.  \"Nothing a dog'd care for, that is.  I reckon he WAS  hungry, for he made about two bites of it.  I had a fine sleep the rest  of the night but my dinner had to be sorter scanty--potatoes and point,  as you might say.  The dog, he lit out for home this morning.  I reckon  HE weren't a vegetarian.\"    \"The idea of starving yourself for a worthless dog!\" sniffed Mrs.  Doctor.    \"You don't know but he may be worth a lot to somebody,\" protested  Captain Jim.  \"He didn't LOOK of much account, but you can't go by  looks in jedging a dog.  Like meself, he might be a real beauty inside.  The First Mate didn't approve of him, I'll allow.  His language was  right down forcible. But the First Mate is prejudiced.  No use in  taking a cat's opinion of a dog.  'Tennyrate, I lost my dinner, so this  nice spread in this dee-lightful company is real pleasant. It's a great  thing to have good neighbors.\"    \"Who lives in the house among the willows up the brook?\" asked Anne.    \"Mrs. Dick Moore,\" said Captain Jim--\"and her husband,\" he added, as if  by way of an afterthought.    Anne smiled, and deduced a mental picture of Mrs. Dick Moore from  Captain Jim's way of putting it; evidently a second Mrs. Rachel Lynde.    \"You haven't many neighbors, Mistress Blythe,\" Captain Jim went on.  \"This side of the harbor is mighty thinly settled.  Most of the land  belongs to Mr. Howard up yander past the Glen, and he rents it out for  pasture.  The other side of the harbor, now, is thick with  folks--'specially MacAllisters.  There's a whole colony of MacAllisters  you can't throw a stone but you hit one.  I was talking to old Leon  Blacquiere the other day.  He's been working on the harbor all summer.  'Dey're nearly all MacAllisters over thar,' he told me.  'Dare's Neil  MacAllister and Sandy MacAllister and William MacAllister and Alec  MacAllister and Angus MacAllister--and I believe dare's de Devil  MacAllister.'\"    \"There are nearly as many Elliotts and Crawfords,\" said Doctor Dave,  after the laughter had subsided.  \"You know, Gilbert, we folk on this  side of Four Winds have an old saying--'From the conceit of the  Elliotts, the pride of the MacAllisters, and the vainglory of the  Crawfords, good Lord deliver us.'\"    \"There's a plenty of fine people among them, though,\" said Captain Jim.  \"I sailed with William Crawford for many a year, and for courage and  endurance and truth that man hadn't an equal.  They've got brains over  on that side of Four Winds.  Mebbe that's why this side is sorter  inclined to pick on 'em.  Strange, ain't it, how folks seem to resent  anyone being born a mite cleverer than they be.\"    Doctor Dave, who had a forty years' feud with the over-harbor people,  laughed and subsided.    \"Who lives in that brilliant emerald house about half a mile up the  road?\" asked Gilbert.    Captain Jim smiled delightedly.    \"Miss Cornelia Bryant.  She'll likely be over to see you soon, seeing  you're Presbyterians.  If you were Methodists she wouldn't come at all.  Cornelia has a holy horror of Methodists.\"    \"She's quite a character,\" chuckled Doctor Dave.  \"A most inveterate  man-hater!\"    \"Sour grapes?\" queried Gilbert, laughing.    \"No, 'tisn't sour grapes,\" answered Captain Jim seriously.  \"Cornelia  could have had her pick when she was young.  Even yet she's only to say  the word to see the old widowers jump.  She jest seems to have been  born with a sort of chronic spite agin men and Methodists.  She's got  the bitterest tongue and the kindest heart in Four Winds.  Wherever  there's any trouble, that woman is there, doing everything to help in  the tenderest way.  She never says a harsh word about another woman,  and if she likes to card us poor scalawags of men down I reckon our  tough old hides can stand it.\"    \"She always speaks well of you, Captain Jim,\" said Mrs. Doctor.    \"Yes, I'm afraid so.  I don't half like it.  It makes me feel as if  there must be something sorter unnateral about me.\"        CHAPTER 7    THE SCHOOLMASTER'S BRIDE    \"Who was the first bride who came to this house, Captain Jim?\" Anne  asked, as they sat around the fireplace after supper.    \"Was she a part of the story I've heard"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5449"],[0,"Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt — Complete (#6)"],[1,"have sworn to act after that knowledge. To bind  the crowd to the faith and the institutions of the fathers is your  duty--is the duty of every priest. Times have changed, my son; under the  old kings the fire, of which I spoke figuratively to you--the poet--was  enclosed in brazen walls which the people passed stupidly by. Now I see  breaches in the old fortifications; the eyes of the uninitiated have  been sharpened, and one tells the other what he fancies he has spied,  though half-blinded, through the glowing rifts.\"    A slight emotion had given energy to the tones of the speaker, and while  he held the poet spell-bound with his piercing glance he continued:    \"We curse and expel any one of the initiated who enlarges these  breaches; we punish even the friend who idly neglects to repair and  close them with beaten brass!\"    \"My father!\" cried Pentaur, raising his head in astonishment while the  blood mounted to his cheeks. The high-priest went up to him and laid  both hands on his shoulders.    They were of equal height and of equally symmetrical build; even the  outline of their features was similar. Nevertheless no one would have  taken them to be even distantly related; their countenances were so  infinitely unlike in expression.    On the face of one were stamped a strong will and the power of firmly  guiding his life and commanding himself; on the other, an amiable desire  to overlook the faults and defects of the world, and to contemplate life  as it painted itself in the transfiguring magic-mirror of his poet's  soul. Frankness and enjoyment spoke in his sparkling eye, but the subtle  smile on his lips when he was engaged in a discussion, or when his soul  was stirred, betrayed that Pentaur, far from childlike carelessness, had  fought many a severe mental battle, and had tasted the dark waters of  doubt.    At this moment mingled feelings were struggling in his soul. He felt as  if he must withstand the speaker; and yet the powerful presence of the  other exercised so strong an influence over his mind, long trained to  submission, that he was silent, and a pious thrill passed through him  when Ameni's hands were laid on his shoulders.    \"I blame you,\" said the high-priest, while he firmly held the young man,  \"nay, to my sorrow I must chastise you; and yet,\" he said, stepping back  and taking his right hand, \"I rejoice in the necessity, for I love you  and honor you, as one whom the Unnameable has blessed with high gifts  and destined to great things. Man leaves a weed to grow unheeded or  roots it up but you are a noble tree, and I am like the gardener who  has forgotten to provide it with a prop, and who is now thankful to  have detected a bend that reminds him of his neglect. You look at me  enquiringly, and I can see in your eyes that I seem to you a severe  judge. Of what are you accused? You have suffered an institution of  the past to be set aside. It does not matter--so the short-sighted and  heedless think; but I say to you, you have doubly transgressed, because  the wrong-doer was the king's daughter, whom all look up to, great and  small, and whose actions may serve as an example to the people. On whom  then must a breach of the ancient institutions lie with the darkest  stain if not on the highest in rank? In a few days it will be said the  paraschites are men even as we are, and the old law to avoid them as  unclean is folly. And will the reflections of the people, think you, end  there, when it is so easy for them to say that he who errs in one point  may as well fail in all? In questions of faith, my son, nothing is  insignificant. If we open one tower to the enemy he is master of the  whole fortress. In these unsettled times our sacred lore is like a  chariot on the declivity of a precipice, and under the wheels thereof a  stone. A child takes away the stone, and the chariot rolls down into the  abyss and is dashed to pieces. Imagine the princess to be that child,  and the stone a loaf that she would fain give to feed a beggar. Would  you then give it to her if your father and your mother and all that is  dear and precious to you were in the chariot? Answer not! the princess  will visit the paraschites again to-morrow. You must await her in the  man's hut, and there inform her that she has transgressed and must crave  to be purified by us. For this time you are excused from any further  punishment.    \"Heaven has bestowed on you a gifted soul. Strive for that which is  wanting to you--the strength to subdue, to crush for One--and you know  that One--all things else--even the misguiding voice of your heart, the  treacherous voice of your judgment.--But stay! send leeches to the house  of the paraschites, and desire them to treat the injured girl as though  she were the queen herself. Who knows where the man dwells?\"    \"The princess,\" replied Pentaur, \"has left Paaker, the king's pioneer,  behind in the temple to conduct the leeches to the house of Pinem.\"    The grave high-priest smiled and said. \"Paaker! to attend the daughter  of a paraschites.\"    Pentaur half beseechingly and half in fun raised his eyes which he had  kept cast down. \"And Pentaur,\" he murmured, \"the gardener's son! who is  to refuse absolution to the king's daughter!\"    \"Pentaur, the minister of the Gods--Pentaur, the priest--has not to do  with the daughter of the king, but with the transgressor of the sacred  institutions,\" replied Ameni gravely. \"Let Paaker know I wish to speak  with him.\"    The poet bowed low and quitted the room, the high priest muttered to  himself: \"He is not yet what he should be, and speech is of no effect  with him.\"    For a while he was silent, walking to and fro in meditation; then he  said half aloud, \"And the boy is destined to great things. What gifts of  the Gods doth he lack? He has the faculty of learning--of thinking--of  feeling--of winning all hearts, even mine. He keeps himself undefiled  and separate--\" suddenly the prelate paused and struck his hand on the  back of a chair that stood by him. \"I have it; he has not yet felt the  fire of ambition. We will light it for his profit and our own.\"          CHAPTER III.    Pentauer hastened to execute the commands of the high-priest. He sent  a servant to escort Paaker, who was waiting in the forecourt, into the  presence of Ameni while he himself repaired to the physicians to impress  on them the most watchful care of the unfortunate girl.    Many proficients in the healing arts were brought up in the house of  Seti, but few used to remain after passing the examination for the  degree of Scribe.       [What is here stated with regard to the medical schools is     principally derived from the medical writings of the Egyptians     themselves, among which the \"Ebers Papyrus\" holds the first place,     \"Medical Papyrus I.\" of Berlin the second, and a hieratic MS. in     London which, like the first mentioned, has come down to us from the     18th dynasty, takes the third. Also see Herodotus II. 84. Diodorus     I. 82.]    The most gifted were sent to Heliopolis, where flourished, in the great  \"Hall of the Ancients,\" the most celebrated medical faculty of the whole  country, whence they returned to Thebes, endowed with the highest  honors in surgery, in ocular treatment, or in any other branch of  their profession, and became physicians to the king or made a living by  imparting their learning and by being called in to consult on serious  cases.    Naturally most of the doctors lived on the east bank of the Nile, in  Thebes proper, and even in private houses with their families; but each  was attached to a priestly college.    Whoever required a physician sent for him, not to his own house, but to  a temple. There a statement was required of the complaint from which the  sick was suffering, and it was left to the principal medical staff of  the sanctuary to select that of the healing art whose special knowledge  appeared to him to be suited for the treatment of the case.    Like all priests, the physicians lived on the income which came to  them from their landed property, from the gifts of the king, the  contributions of the laity, and the share which was given them of the  state-revenues; they expected no honorarium from their patients, but the  restored sick seldom neglected making a present to the sanctuary whence  a physician had come to them, and it was not unusual for the priestly  leech to make the recovery of the sufferer conditional on certain gifts  to be offered to the temple.    The medical knowledge of the Egyptians was, according to every  indication, very considerable; but it was natural that physicians, who  stood by the bed of sickness as \"ordained servants of the Divinity,\"  should not be satisfied with a rational treatment of the sufferer,  and should rather think that they could not dispense with the mystical  effects of prayers and vows.    Among the professors of medicine in the House of Seti there were men  of the most different gifts and bent of mind; but Pentaur was not for  a moment in doubt as to which should be entrusted with the treatment  of the girl who had been run over, and for whom he felt the greatest  sympathy.    The one he chose was the grandson of a celebrated leech, long  since dead, whose name of Nebsecht he had inherited, and a beloved  school-friend and old comrade of Pentaur.    This young man had from his earliest years shown high and hereditary  talent for the profession to which he had devoted himself; he had  selected surgery       [Among the six hermetic books of medicine mentioned by Clement of     Alexandria, was one devoted to surgical instruments: otherwise the     very badly-set fractures found in some of the mummies do little     honor to the Egyptian surgeons.]    for his special province at Heliopolis, and would certainly have  attained the dignity of teacher there if an impediment in his speech had  not debarred him from the viva voce recitation of formulas and"]]]
