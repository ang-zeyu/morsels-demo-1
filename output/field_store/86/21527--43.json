In short, we find  the Church itself apostate, boasting of temporal power, making its own  laws, teaching its own dogmas, preserving only a form of godliness,  while denying the power thereof.--(See II Tim. 3:1-6.)    **Specific Predictions of the Apostasy**.    19. The Lord foresaw the great and general departure from the  principles of righteousness, and from the beginning knew that men  would set up their own forms of worship, wrongfully claiming divine  authority for the same. Through the mouths of His chosen prophets He  has repeatedly predicted the inevitable event.--(See note 3, end of  chapter.)    20. Among the prophecies antedating the birth of Christ the following  may be noted. Isaiah beheld in vision the condition of the earth in  the era of spiritual darkness, a period in which all classes would be  involved in a general condition of unrighteousness, a time when the  world of mankind would be in a helpless and practically hopeless  condition. He pictures the earth mourning and languishing in  desolation and assigns the reason for the sad condition as follows:  \"The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they  have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the  everlasting covenant.\"--(Isaiah 24:5; read verses 1 to 6 inclusive.)    21. It may be thought that this prophecy has reference to a violation  of the law of Moses under which ancient Israel lived. Let it be  remembered, however, that the Mosaic law is nowhere called an  everlasting covenant. The covenant between the Lord and Abraham  antedated the giving of the law by four hundred and thirty years, and,  as pointed out by Paul,--(Galatians 3:17; read the entire chapter.) In  his epistle to the Galatians, whom he designates as foolish because of  their confusing the law of Moses and the gospel of Christ, the law  could not nullify the earlier covenant the fulfillment of which could  come only through Christ. The \"law,\" by which the inspired apostle  plainly means the Mosaic statutes, was but a preparation for the  \"faith,\" by which latter expression the gospel as revealed by Christ  is clearly intended. \"But before faith came,\" says Paul, \"we were kept  under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be  revealed. Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto  Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after that faith is  come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster. For ye are the children  of God by faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as have been  baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor  Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor  female: for ye are all one in Jesus Christ. And if ye be Christ's then  are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.\"--(Verses  23-29.)    22. It is evident from the tenor of the entire chapter, that while the  gospel was preached unto Abraham, and covenant made with him relating  to the coming of the Messiah through his posterity, the gospel did not  abide with Israel, and this because of transgression;--(Verse 19.) but  in lieu thereof the Mosaic law was instituted as a disciplinary  measure, temporary in character, destined to be superseded by the  gospel of Christ, and assuredly not an everlasting covenant. On the  other hand, the blood of Christ, through the shedding of which the  atoning sacrifice was wrought, is distinctively called \"the blood of  the everlasting covenant,\"--(Hebrews 13:20.)    23. It is evident then that Isaiah's fateful prophecy relating to the  breaking of the everlasting covenant could have no reference to a  departure from the Mosaic requirements, but must refer to a then  future condition of apostasy following the establishment of the  everlasting covenant. Moreover, part of the great prediction,  referring to the burnings and widespread calamities,--(See Isaiah  24:6.) yet awaits its complete fulfillment.    24. Another prediction applicable to the period when there should be  no Church of Christ to be found, and when, in consequence there should  be lamentation and suffering, is that of Amos. \"Behold, the days come,  saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a  famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of  the Lord: And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north  even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the  Lord, and shall not find it.\"--(Amos 8:11, 12.)    25. Christ instructed His followers in terms at once direct and  conclusive, as to the apostasy then impending. In reply to certain  inquiries concerning the signs by which His second advent would be  heralded, He said: \"Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall  come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.\"--(Matt.  24:4, 5.) Then He told of approaching wars and political disturbances,  and added: \"And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one  another, and shall hate one another. And many false prophets shall  rise and shall deceive many. And because iniquity shall abound, the  love of many shall wax cold. But he that shall endure unto the end,  the same shall be saved.\"--(Verses 10-13. See note 4, end of chapter.)    26. Further specifying the conditions incident to the growing  apostasy, Christ declared to His disciples: \"Then shall they deliver  you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of  all nations for my name's sake.\"--(Verse 9.) And again: \"Then if any  man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not.  For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall  shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that if it were possible, they  shall deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before.  Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go  not forth; behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it  not.\"--(Verses 23-26.)    27. After the departure of Christ from earth His apostles continued to  warn the people of the darkness to come. In that memorable address to  the elders of Ephesus, when, as he told them, they were looking upon  his face for the last time, Paul reminded his hearers of the  instructions he had previously given them, and then charged them with  this solemn warning: \"For I know this, that after my departing shall  grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. Also of  your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw  away disciples after them.\"--(Acts 20:29, 30; read verses 17 to 31  incl.)    28. Not only would outsiders ingratiate themselves with the saints for  purposes of selfish gain,--wolves entering in, and not sparing the  flock,--but schisms and divisions were imminent; and these dissensions  were to come through some then present,--men who would aspire to  leadership, and who would set up their own doctrines, thus drawing  disciples away from the Church and unto themselves.    29. The same apostle warns Timothy of the approaching apostasy, and  refers to some of the erroneous teachings that would be impressed upon  misguided people,--teachings which he calls \"doctrines of devils.\" He  admonishes Timothy to put the brethren in remembrance of these things,  as is becoming in a good minister of Christ, \"nourished up in the  words of faith and of good doctrine.\" Note the inspired prediction:  \"Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some  shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and  doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their  conscience seared with a hot iron; forbidding to marry, and commanding  to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with  thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.\"--(I Tim.  4:1-3. See Note 5, end of chapter.)    30. In a second epistle to his beloved Timothy, while laboring under  the premonition that his martyrdom was near at hand, Paul urges zeal  and energy in the preaching of the gospel; for the shadows of the  apostasy were gathering about the Church. His admonition is pathetic  in its earnestness: \"I charge thee therefore, before God, and the Lord  Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing  and his kingdom; Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season;  reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine. For the  time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after  their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching  ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be  turned unto fables.\"--(II Tim. 4:1-4.)    31. In addressing the Thessalonian saints, Paul warns them against the  error strongly advocated by some that the day of Christ's second  advent was then near at hand. It appears that deception was being  practiced, and that even forgery was suspected, for the apostle  instructs the people that they be not deceived \"by word nor by letter  as from us.\" The admonition is forceful: \"Now we beseech you,  brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering  together unto Him, That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled,  neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the  day of Christ is at hand. Let no man deceive you by any means: for  that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and  that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and  exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped;  so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that  he is God.\"--(II Thess. 1:2-14.) We shall see how painfully literal  has been the fulfilment of this prophecy in the blasphemous  assumptions of the apostate church, centuries later.    32. The Apostle Peter prophesied in language so plain that none "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35534"],[0,"How to be Happy Though Married: Being a Handbook to Marriage (#6)"],[1,"  When he was elected Professor of Logic and Metaphysics, and had no  lectures on stock, his wife sat up with him night after night to write  out a fair copy of the lectures from the rough sheets which he had  drafted in the adjoining room. \"The number of pages in her handwriting  still preserved is,\" says Sir William's biographer, \"perfectly  marvellous.\"    Equally effective as a literary helper was Lady Napier, the wife of Sir  William Napier, historian of the Peninsular War. She translated and  epitomized the immense mass of original documents, many of them in  cipher, on which it was in a great measure founded. When Wellington was  told of the art and industry she had displayed in deciphering King  Joseph's portfolios, and the immense mass of correspondence taken at  Vittoria, he at first would hardly believe it, adding: \"I would have  given L20,000 to any person who could have done this for me in the  Peninsula.\" Sir William Napier's handwriting being almost illegible,  Lady Napier made out his rough interlined manuscript, which he himself  could scarcely read, and wrote out a fair copy for the printer; and all  this vast labour she undertook and accomplished, according to the  testimony of her husband, without having for a moment neglected the care  and education of a large family.    The help and consolation that Hood received from his wife during a life  that was a prolonged illness is one of the most affecting things in  biography. He had such confidence in her judgment that he read and  re-read and corrected with her assistance all that he wrote. He used to  trust to her ready memory for references and quotations. Many wives  deserve, but few receive, such an I.O.U. as that which the grateful  humorist gave to his wife in one of his letters when absent from her  side. \"I never was anything, Dearest, till I knew you, and I have been a  better, happier, and more prosperous man ever since. Lay by that truth  in lavender, Sweetest, and remind me of it when I fail. I am writing  warmly and fondly, but not without good cause.... Perhaps there is an  afterthought that, whatever may befall me, the wife of my bosom will  have the acknowledgment of her tenderness, worth, excellence--all that  is wifely or womanly--from my pen.\"    Mr. Froude says of Carlyle's wife that \"her hardest work was a delight  to her when she could spare her husband's mind an anxiety or his stomach  an indigestion. While he was absorbed in his work and extremely  irritable as to every ailment or discomfort, her life was devoted to  shield him in every possible way.\" In the inscription upon her tombstone  Carlyle bore testimony that he owed to his wife a debt immense of  gratitude. \"In her bright existence she had more sorrows than are  common, but also a soft invincibility, a capacity of discernment, and a  noble loyalty of heart which are rare. For forty years she was the true  and loving helpmate of her husband, and by act and word unweariedly  forwarded him as none else could in all of worthy that he did or  attempted. She died at London, April 21st, 1866, suddenly snatched away  from him, and the light of his life as if gone out.\"    What an influence women have exercised upon teachers of religion and  philosophy! When no one else would encourage Mahomet, his wife Kadijah  listened to him with wonder, with doubt. At length she answered: \"Yes,  it was true this that he said.\" We can fancy, as does Carlyle, the  boundless gratitude of Mahomet, and how, of all the kindnesses she had  done him, this of believing the earnest struggling word he now spoke was  the greatest. \"It is certain,\" says Novalis, \"my conviction gains  infinitely the moment another soul will believe in it.\" It is a  boundless favour. He never forgot this good Kadijah. Long afterwards,  Ayesha, his young favourite wife, a woman who indeed distinguished  herself among the Moslem by all manner of qualities, through her whole  long life, this young brilliant Ayesha was one day questioning him: \"Now  am I not better than Kadijah? she was a widow; old, and had lost her  looks: you love me better than you did her?\" \"No, by Allah!\" answered  Mahomet: \"No, by Allah! She believed in me when none else would believe.  In the whole world I had but one friend, and she was that!\"    It will suffice to hint at the scientific value of the little that has  been disclosed respecting Madame Clothilde de Vaux in elucidating the  position of Auguste Comte as a teacher. Some may think that John Stuart  Mill first taught his wife and then admired his own wisdom in her. His  own account of the matter is very different, as we learn from the  dedication of his essay \"On Liberty\":    \"To the beloved and deplored memory of her who was the inspirer, and in  part the author, of all that is best in my writings--the friend and wife  whose exalted sense of truth and right was my strongest incitement, and  whose approbation was my chief reward--I dedicate this volume. Like all  that I have written for many years, it belongs as much to her as to me;  but the work as it stands has had, in a very insufficient degree, the  inestimable advantage of her revision; some of the most important  portions having been reserved for a more careful re-examination, which  they are now never destined to receive. Were I but capable of  interpreting to the world one-half the great thoughts and noble feelings  which are buried in her grave, I should be the medium of a greater  benefit to it than is ever likely to arise from anything that I can  write, unprompted and unassisted by her all but unrivalled wisdom.\"    In a speech upon woman's rights, a lady orator is said to have  exclaimed, \"It is well known that Solomon owed his wisdom to the number  of his wives!\" This is too much; nevertheless, Sir Samuel Romilly gave  the experience of many successful men when he said that there was  nothing by which through life he had more profited than by the just  observations and the good opinion of his wife.    Most people are acquainted with husbands who have lost almost all  self-reliance and self-help because their wives have been only too  helpful to them. Trollope and George Eliot faithfully portrayed real  life in their stories when they put the reins into the hands of good  wives and made them drive the domestic coach, to the immense advantage  and comfort of the husbands, who never suspected the real state of the  case. No man has so thoroughly as Trollope brought into literature the  idea which women have of men--creatures that have to be looked after as  grown-up little boys; interesting, piquant, indispensable, but  shiftless, headstrong, and at bottom absurd.    But this consciousness which good wives have of the helplessness of  husbands renders them all the more valuable in their eyes. Before  Weinsberg surrendered to its besiegers, the women of the place asked  permission of the captors to remove their valuables. The permission was  granted, and shortly after the women were seen issuing from the gates  carrying their husbands on their shoulders. Indeed it would be  impossible to relate a tenth part of the many ways in which good wives  have shown affection for and actively assisted their wedded lords.  Knowing this to be the case, we were not surprised to read some time  since the following piece of Irish news: \"An inquiry was held at  Mullingar on Wednesday respecting Mr. H. Smythe's claim of L10,000 as  compensation for the loss of his wife, who was shot whilst returning  from church. The claim was made under the nineteenth section of the  Crime Preservation Act, Ireland.\" The result of the inquiry we do not  know, but for ourselves we think that L10,000 would barely compensate  for the loss of a really good article in wives.    Some one told an old bachelor that a friend had gone blind. \"Let him  marry, then,\" was the crusty reply; \"let him marry, and if that doesn't  open his eyes, then his case is indeed hopeless.\" But this, we must  remember, was not the experience of a married man.    A friend was talking to Wordsworth of De Quincey's articles about him.  Wordsworth begged him to stop; he hadn't read them, and did not wish to  ruffle himself about them. \"Well,\" said the friend, \"I'll tell you only  one thing he says, and then we'll talk of other things. He says your  wife is too good for you.\" The old poet's dim eyes lighted up, and he  started from his chair, crying with enthusiasm, \"And that's true! There  he's right!\" his disgust and contempt visibly moderating. Many a man  whose faith in womankind was weak before marriage can a few years  afterwards sympathize most fully with this pathetic confession of the  old poet.    A Scotch dealer, when exhorting his son to practise honesty on the  ground of its being the \"best policy,\" quietly added, \"I hae tried  _baith_.\" So is it in reference to matrimony and celibacy. The majority  of those who have \"tried baith\" are of opinion that the former is the  best policy.    It would be absurd to assert that the marriage state is free from care  and anxiety; but what of that? Is not care and trouble the condition of  any and every state of life? He that will avoid trouble must avoid the  world. \"Marriage,\" says Dr. Johnson, \"is not commonly unhappy, but as  life is unhappy.\" And the summing up, so to speak, of this great  authority is well known--\"Marriage has many pains, but celibacy no  pleasures.\"          CHAPTER IV.    THE CHOICE OF A WIFE.      \"Go, draw aside the curtains, and discover    The several caskets to this noble prince:--    Now make your choice.\"--_Shakespeare._         \"If, as Plutarch adviseth, one must eat _modium salis_, a bushel       of salt, with him before he choose his friend, what care should       be had in choosing a wife--his second self! How solicitous should       he be to know her qualities and behaviour! and, when he is       assured of them, not to prefer birth, fortune, beauty, before       bringing up and good conditions.\"--_Rob"]]]
