Cats, properly trained, will not touch anything, alive or dead, on the  premises to which they are attached. I have known them to sport with  tame rabbits, to romp and jump in frolicsome mood this way, then that,  which both seemed greatly to enjoy, yet they would bring home wild  rabbits they had killed, and not touch my little chickens or ducklings.    [Illustration: \"THE OLD LADY.\"]    When I built a house in the country, fond as I am of cats, I determined  _not_ to keep any there, because they would destroy the birds' nests and  drive my feathered friends away, and I liked to watch and feed these  from the windows. Things went pleasantly for awhile. The birds were fed,  and paid for their keep with many and many a song. There were the old  ones and there the young, and oft by the hour I watched them from the  window; and they became so tame as scarcely caring to get out of my way  when I went outside with more food. But--there is always a but--but one  day, or rather evening, as I was \"looking on,\" a rat came out from the  rocks, and then another. Soon they began their repast on the remains of  the birds' food. Then in the twilight came mice, the short-tailed and  the long, scampering hither and thither. This, too, was amusing. In the  autumn I bought some filberts, and put them into a closet upstairs, went  to London, returned, and thought I would sleep in the room adjoining the  closet. No such thing. As soon as the light was out there was a sound of  gnawing--curb--curb--sweek!--squeak--a rushing of tiny feet here, there,  and everywhere; thump, bump--scriggle, scraggle--squeak--overhead, above  the ceiling, behind the skirting boards, under the floor, and--in the  closet. I lighted a candle, opened the door, and looked into the  repository for my filberts. What a hustling, what a scuffling, what a  scrambling. There they were, mice in numbers; they \"made for\" some holes  in the corners of the cupboard, got jammed, squeaked, struggled,  squabbled, pushed, their tails making circles; push--push--squeak!--more  jostling, another effort or two--squeak--squeak--gurgle--squeak--more  struggling--and they were gone. Gone? Yes! but not for long. As soon as  the light was out back they came. No! oh, dear no! sleep! no more sleep.  Outside, I liked to watch the mice; but when they climbed the ivy and  got inside, the pleasure entirely ceased. Nor was this all; they got  into the vineries and spoilt the grapes, and the rats killed the young  ducks and chickens, and undermined the building also, besides storing  quantities of grain and other things under the floor. The result number  one was, three cats coming on a visit. Farmyard cats--cats that knew the  difference between chickens, ducklings, mice, and rats. Result number  two, that after being away a couple of weeks, I went again to my  cottage, and I slept undisturbed in the room late the play-ground of the  mice. My chickens and ducklings were safe, and soon the cats allowed the  birds to be fed in front of the window, though I could not break them of  destroying many of the nests. I never NOTICED more fully the very great  use the domestic cat is to man than on that occasion. All day my cats  were indoors, dozy, sociable, and contented. At night they were on guard  outside, and doubtless saved me the lives of dozens of my \"young  things.\" One afternoon I saw one of my cats coming towards me with  apparent difficulty in walking. On its near approach I found it was  carrying a large rat, which appeared dead. Coming nearer, the cat put  down the rat. Presently I saw it move, then it suddenly got up and ran  off. The cat caught it again. Again it feigned death, again got up and  ran off, and was once more caught. It laid quite still, when, perceiving  the cat had turned away, it got up, apparently quite uninjured, and ran  in another direction, and I and the cat--lost it! I was not sorry. This  rat deserved his liberty. Whether it was permanent I know not, as  \"Little-john,\" the cat, remained, and I left.    The cat is not only a very useful animal about the house and premises,  but is also ornamental. It is lithe and beautiful in form, and graceful  in action. Of course there are cats that are ugly by comparison with  others, both in form, colour, and markings; and as there are now cat  shows, at which prizes are offered for varieties, I will endeavour to  give, in succeeding chapters, the points of excellence as regards form,  colour, and markings required and most esteemed for the different  classes. I am the more induced to define these as clearly as possible,  owing to the number of mistakes that often occur in the entries.    [Illustration]          LONG-HAIRED CATS.      These are very diversified, both in form, colour, and the quality of the  hair, which in some is more woolly than in others; and they vary also in  the shape and length of the tail, the ears, and size of eyes. There are  several varieties--the Russian, the Angora, the Persian, and Indian.  Forty or fifty years ago they used all to be called French cats, as they  were mostly imported from Paris--more particularly the white, which were  then the fashion, and, if I remember rightly, they, as a rule, were  larger than those of the present day. Coloured long-haired cats were  then rare, and but little cared for or appreciated. The pure white, with  long silky hair, bedecked with blue or rose-colour ribbon, or a silver  collar with its name inscribed thereon or one of scarlet leather studded  with brass, might often be seen stretching its full lazy length on  luxurious woollen rugs--the valued, pampered pets of \"West End\" life.    [Illustration]    A curious fact relating to the white cat of not only the long but also  the short-haired breed is their deafness. Should they have blue eyes,  which is the fancy colour, these are nearly always deaf; although I have  seen specimens whose hearing was as perfect as that of any other colour.  Still deafness in white cats is not always confined to those with blue  eyes, as I too well know from purchasing a very fine male at the Crystal  Palace Show some few years since. The price was low and the cat \"a  beauty,\" both in form, coat, and tail, his eyes were yellow, and he had  a nice, meek, mild, expressive face. I stopped and looked at him, as he  much took my fancy. He stared at me wistfully, with something like  melancholy in the gaze of his _amber_-coloured eyes. I put my hand  through the bars of the cage. He purred, licked my hand, rubbed against  the wires, put his tail up, as much as to say, \"See, here is a beautiful  tail; am I not a lovely cat?\" \"Yes,\" thought I, \"a very nice cat.\" When  I looked at my catalogue and saw the low price, \"something is wrong  here,\" said I, musingly. \"Yes, there _must_ be something wrong. The  price is misstated, or there is something not right about this cat.\" No!  it was a beauty--so comely, so loving, so gentle--so very gentle.  \"Well,\" said I to myself, \"if there is no misstatement of price, I will  buy this cat,\" and, with a parting survey of its excellences, I went to  the office of the show manager. He looked at the letter of entry. No;  the price was quite right--\"two guineas!\" \"I will buy it,\" said I. And  so I did; but at two guineas I bought it dearly. Yes! very dearly, for  when I got it home I found it was \"stone\" deaf. What an unhappy cat it  was! If shut out of the dining-room you could hear its cry for admission  all over the house; being so deaf the poor wretched creature never knew  the noise it made. I often wish that it had so known--very, very often.  I am satisfied that a tithe would have frightened it out of its life.  And so loving, so affectionate. But, oh! horror, when it called out as  it sat on my lap, its voice seemed to acquire at least _ten cat power_.  And when, if it lost sight of me in the garden, its voice rose to the  occasion, I feel confident it might have been heard miles off. Alas! he  never knew what that agonised sound was like, but I did, and I have  never forgotten it, and I never shall. I named him \"The Colonel\" on  account of his commanding voice.    One morning a friend came--blessed be that day--and after dinner he saw  \"the beauty.\" \"What a lovely cat!\" said he. \"Yes,\" said I, \"he is very  beautiful, quite a picture.\" After a while he said, looking at \"Pussy\"  warming himself before the fire, \"I think I never saw one I liked more.\"  \"Indeed,\" said I, \"if you really think so, I will give it to you; but he  has a fault--he is 'stone' deaf.\" \"Oh, I don't mind that,\" said he. He  took him away--miles and miles away. I was glad it was so many miles  away for two reasons. One was I feared he might come back, and the other  that his voice might come resounding on the still night air. But he  never came back nor a sound.--A few days after he left \"to better  himself,\" a letter came saying, would I wish to have him back? They  liked it very much, all but its voice. \"No,\" I wrote, \"no, you are very  kind, no, thank you; give him to any one you please--do what you will  with 'the beauty,' but it must not return, never.\" When next I saw my  friend, I asked him how \"the beauty\" was. \"You dreadful man!\" said he;  \"why, that cat nearly drove us all mad--I never heard anything like it.\"  \"Nor I,\" said I, sententiously. \"Well,\" said my friend, \"'all is well  that ends well;' I have given it to a very deaf old lady, and so both  are happy.\" \"Very, I trust,\" said I.    The foregoing is by way of advice; in buying a white cat--or, in fact,  any other--ascertain for a _certainty_ that it is _not deaf_.      [Illustration]    A short time since I saw a white Persian cat with deep blue eyes sitting  at the door of a tobacconist's, at the corner of the Haymarket, London.  On inquiry I found that the cat could hear perfectly, and was in no way  deficient of health and strength; and this is by no means a solitary  instance. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35470"],[0,"Key to the Science of Theology (#6)"],[1,"and Elijah, or of Paul and Silas.    Their oneness consists of a oneness of spirit, intelligence,  attributes, knowledge, or power.    If Enoch, Elijah, Abraham, Peter, Paul, and millions of others ever  attain to the immortal life, and their fleshly tabernacles be  quickened by a fulness of celestial life and light, intelligence and  power, then it can be said of them, _they are one, as the Father and  Son are one_.    It could then be said of each of them, in him dwells all the fulness  of the powers and attributes of the Eternal God, or, in other words,  he possesses endless life, together with all intelligence, knowledge,  light, and power. He therefore has the same mind as all the others--is  in communication and in perfect union with each and all of them.    All these are Gods, or sons of God--they are the Kings, Princes,  Priests, and Nobles of Eternity. But over them all there is a  Presidency or Grand Head, who is the Father of all. And next unto him  is Jesus Christ, the eldest born, and first heir of all the realms of  light.    Every person knows, by reflection, that intelligence may be imparted  without diminishing the store possessed by the giver. Therefore it  follows, that millions of individual beings may each receive all the  attributes of eternal life, and light, and power.    Again it follows, that in the use of this power, by consent and  authority of the head, any one of these Gods may create, organize,  people, govern, control, exalt, glorify and enjoy worlds on worlds,  and the inhabitants thereof; or, in other words, each of them can find  room in the infinitude of space, and unoccupied chaotic elements in  the boundless storehouse of eternal riches, with which to erect for  himself thrones, principalities, and powers, over which to reign in  still increasing might, majesty and dominion, for ever and ever.    All these are kingdoms which, together with their Kings, are in  subordination to the great Head and Father of all, and to Jesus Christ  the first born, and first heir, among the sons of God.    All these kingdoms, with all their intelligences, are so many  acquisitions to _His_ dominion who is Lord of lords, and King of  kings, and of whom it is written, by the Prophet Isaiah, \"Of the  increase of his kingdom there shall be no end.\"    All these are so many colonies of our race, multiplied, extended,  transplanted, and existing for ever and ever, as occupants of the  numberless planetary systems which do now exist, or which will roll  into order, and be peopled by the operations of the Holy Spirit, in  obedience to the mandates of the sons of God.    These kingdoms present every variety and degree in the progress of the  great science of life, from the lowest degradation amid the realms of  death, or the rudimental stages of elementary existence, upward  through all the ascending scale, or all the degrees of progress in the  science of eternal life and light, until some of them in turn arise to  thrones of eternal power.    Each of these Gods, including Jesus Christ and his Father, being in  possession of not merely an organized spirit, but a glorious immortal  body of flesh and bones, is subject to the laws which govern, of  necessity, even the most refined order of physical existence.    All physical element, however embodied, quickened, or refined, is  subject to the general laws necessary to all existence.    Some of these laws are as follows--    First. Each atom, or embodiment of atoms, necessarily occupies a  certain amount of space.    Second. No atom, or embodiment of atoms, can occupy the identical  space occupied by other atoms or bodies.    Third. Each individual organized intelligence must possess the power  of self motion to a greater or less degree.    Fourth. All voluntary motion implies an inherent will, to originate  and direct such motion.    Fifth. Motion, of necessity, implies that a certain amount of time is  necessary, in passing from one portion of space to another.    These laws are absolute and unchangeable in their nature, and apply to  all intelligent agencies which do or can exist.    They, therefore, apply with equal force to the great, supreme, eternal  Father of the heavens and of the earth, and to His meanest subjects.    It is, therefore, an absolute impossibility for God the Father, or  Jesus Christ, to be everywhere personally present.    The omnipresence of God must therefore be understood in some other way  than of His bodily or personal presence.    This leads to the investigation of that substance called the Holy  Spirit.    As the mind passes the boundaries of the visible world, and enters  upon the confines of the more refined and subtle elements, it finds  itself associated with certain substances in themselves invisible to  our gross organs, but clearly manifested to our intellect by their  tangible operations and effects.    The very air we breathe, although invisible to our sight, is clearly  manifested to our sense of feeling. Its component parts may be  analyzed. Nay more, the human system itself is an apparatus which  performs a chemical process upon that element. It is received into the  system by the act of respiration, and there immediately undergoes the  separation of its component parts.    The one part, retained and incorporated in the animal system, diffuses  life and animation, by supplying the necessary animal heat, &c., while  the other part, not adapted to the system, is discharged from the  lungs to mingle with its native element.    There are several of these subtle, invisible substances but little  understood as yet by man, and their existence is only demonstrated by  their effects. Some of them are recognized under the several terms,  electricity, galvanism, magnetism, animal magnetism, spiritual  magnetism, essence, spirit, &c.    The purest, most refined and subtle of all these substances, and the  one least understood, or even recognized, by the less informed among  mankind, is that substance called the Holy Spirit.    This substance, like all others, is one of the elements of material or  physical existence, and therefore subject to the necessary laws which  govern all matter, as before enumerated.    Like the other elements, its whole is composed of individual  particles. Like them, each particle occupies space, possesses the  power of motion, requires time to move from one part of space to  another, and can in no wise occupy two spaces at once. In all these  respects it differs nothing from all other matter.    This substance is widely diffused among the elements of space. This  Holy Spirit, under the control of the Great Eloheim, is the grand  moving cause of all intelligences, and by which they act.    This is the great, positive, controlling element of all other  elements. It is omnipresent by reason of the infinitude of its  particles, and it comprehends all things.    It is the controlling agent or executive, which organizes and puts in  motion all worlds, and which, by the mandate of the Almighty, or of  any of His commissioned agents, performs all the mighty wonders, signs  and miracles, ever manifested in the name of the Lord--the turning of  the earth backward on its axis, the dividing of the sea, the removing  of a mountain, the raising of the dead, or the healing of the sick.    It penetrates the pores of the most solid substances, pierces the  human system to its most inward recesses, discerns the thoughts and  intents of the heart. It has power to move through space with an  inconceivable velocity, far exceeding the tardy motions of  electricity, or of physical light.    It comprehends the past, present, and future, in all their fulness.  Its inherent properties embrace all the attributes of intelligence and  affection.    It is endowed with knowledge, wisdom, truth, love, charity, justice,  and mercy, in all their ramifications.    In short, it is the attributes of the eternal power and Godhead.    Those beings who receive of its fulness are called sons of God,  because they are perfected in all its attributes and powers, and being  in communication with it, can, by its use, perform all things.    Those beings who receive not a fulness, but a measure of it, can know  and perform some things, but not all.    This is the true light, which in some measure illuminates all men. It  is, in its less refined particles, the physical light which reflects  from the sun, moon, and stars, and other substances; and by reflection  on the eye, makes visible the truths of the outward world.    It is, also, in its higher degrees, the intellectual light of our  inward and spiritual organs, by which we reason, discern, judge,  compare, comprehend and remember the subjects within our reach.    Its inspiration constitutes instinct in animal life, reason in man,  vision in the Prophets, and is continually flowing from the Godhead  throughout all His creatures.    Such is the Godhead, as manifested in His words, and in His works. He  dwells in His own eternal palaces of precious stones and gold, in the  Royal City of the heavenly Jerusalem.    He sits enthroned in the midst of all His creations, and is filled and  encircled with light unapproachable by those of the lower spheres.    He associates with myriads of His own begotten sons and daughters who,  by translation or resurrection, have triumphed over death.    His ministers are sent forth from His presence to all parts of His  dominions.    His Holy Spirit centres in His presence, and communicates with, and  extends to the utmost verge of His dominions, comprehending and  controlling all things under the immediate direction of His own will,  and the will of all those in communication with Him, in worlds without  end!
