[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5430"],[0,"Preface to a Dictionary of the English Language (#6)"],[1,"the manners,  corrupts the language; they that have frequent intercourse with  strangers, to whom they endeavour to accommodate themselves, must  in time learn a mingled dialect, like the jargon which serves the  traffickers on the Mediterranean and Indian coasts. This will not  always be confined to the exchange, the warehouse, or the port,  but will be communicated by degrees to other ranks of the people,  and be at last incorporated with the current speech.    There are likewise internal causes equally forcible. The language  most likely to continue long without alteration, would be that of  a nation raised a little, and but a little above barbarity, secluded  from strangers, and totally employed in procuring the conveniencies  of life; either without books, or, like some of the Mahometan  countries, with very few: men thus busied and unlearned, having only  such words as common use requires, would perhaps long continue to  express the same notions by the same signs. But no such constancy  can be expected in a people polished by arts, and classed by  subordination, where one part of the community is sustained and  accommodated by the labour of the other. Those who have much leisure  to think, will always be enlarging the stock of ideas, and every  increase of knowledge, whether real or fancied, will produce new  words, or combinations of words. When the mind is unchained from  necessity, it will range after convenience; when it is left at  large in the fields of speculation, it will shift opinions; as any  custom is disused, the words that expressed it must perish with it;  as any opinion grows popular, it will innovate speech in the same  proportion as it alters practice.    As by the cultivation of various sciences, a language is amplified,  it will be more furnished with words deflected from original sense;  the geometrician will talk of a courtier's zenith, or the excentrick  virtue of a wild hero, and the physician of sanguine expectations  and phlegmatick delays. Copiousness of speech will give opportunities  to capricious choice, by which some words will be preferred,  and others degraded; vicissitudes of fashion will enforce the use  of new, or extend the signification of known terms. The tropes of  poetry will make hourly encroachments, and the metaphorical will  become the current sense: pronunciation will be varied by levity  or ignorance, and the pen must at length comply with the tongue;  illiterate writers will at one time or other, by publick infatuation,  rise into renown, who, not knowing the original import of words,  will use them with colloquial licentiousness, confound distinction,  and forget propriety. As politeness increases, some expressions will  be considered as too gross and vulgar for the delicate, others as  too formal and ceremonious for the gay and airy; new phrases are  therefore adopted, which must, for the same reasons, be in time  dismissed. Swift, in his petty treatise on the English language,  allows that new words must sometimes be introduced, but proposes  that none should be suffered to become obsolete. But what makes  a word obsolete, more than general agreement to forbear it? and  how shall it be continued, when it conveys an offensive idea, or  recalled again into the mouths of mankind, when it has once become  unfamiliar by disuse, and unpleasing by unfamiliarity?    There is another cause of alteration more prevalent than any other,  which yet in the present state of the world cannot be obviated. A  mixture of two languages will produce a third distinct from both,  and they will always be mixed, where the chief part of education,  and the most conspicuous accomplishment, is skill in ancient or  in foreign tongues. He that has long cultivated another language,  will find its words and combinations croud upon his memory; and haste  and negligence, refinement and affectation, will obtrude borrowed  terms and exotick expressions.    The great pest of speech is frequency of translation. No book  was ever turned from one language into another, without imparting  something of its native idiom; this is the most mischievous and  comprehensive innovation; single words may enter by thousands, and  the fabrick of the tongue continue the same, but new phraseology  changes much at once; it alters not the single stones of the building,  but the order of the columns. If an academy should be established  for the cultivation of our stile, which I, who can never wish to  see dependance multiplied, hope the spirit of English liberty will  hinder or destroy, let them, instead of compiling grammars and  dictionaries, endeavour, with all their influence, to stop the  licence of translatours, whose idleness and ignorance, if it be  suffered to proceed, will reduce us to babble a dialect of France.    If the changes that we fear be thus irresistible, what remains but  to acquiesce with silence, as in the other insurmountable distresses  of humanity? It remains that we retard what we cannot repel, that  we palliate what we cannot cure. Life may be lengthened by care,  though death cannot be ultimately defeated: tongues, like governments,  have a natural tendency to degeneration; we have long preserved  our constitution, let us make some struggles for our language.    In hope of giving longevity to that which its own nature forbids  to be immortal, I have devoted this book, the labour of years,  to the honour of my country, that we may no longer yield the palm  of philology, without a contest, to the nations of the continent.  The chief glory of every people arises from its authours: whether  I shall add any thing by my own writings to the reputation of  English literature, must be left to time: much of my life has been  lost under the pressures of disease; much has been trifled away;  and much has always been spent in provision for the day that was  passing over me; but I shall not think my employment useless or  ignoble, if by my assistance foreign nations, and distant ages,  gain access to the propagators of knowledge, and understand the  teachers of truth; if my labours afford light to the repositories  of science, and add celebrity to Bacon, to Hooker, to Milton, and  to Boyle.    When I am animated by this wish, I look with pleasure on my book,  however defective, and deliver it to the world with the spirit of  a man that has endeavoured well. That it will immediately become  popular I have not promised to myself: a few wild blunders, and  risible absurdities, from which no work of such multiplicity was  ever free, may for a time furnish folly with laughter, and harden  ignorance in contempt; but useful diligence will at last prevail,  and there never can be wanting some who distinguish desert; who  will consider that no dictionary of a living tongue ever can be  perfect, since while it is hastening to publication, some words are  budding, and some falling away; that a whole life cannot be spent  upon syntax and etymology, and that even a whole life would not be  sufficient; that he, whose design includes whatever language can  express, must often speak of what he does not understand; that  a writer will sometimes be hurried by eagerness to the end, and  sometimes faint with weariness under a task, which Scaliger compares  to the labours of the anvil and the mine; that what is obvious is  not always known, and what is known is not always present; that sudden  fits of inadvertency will surprize vigilance, slight avocations  will seduce attention, and casual eclipses of the mind will darken  learning; and that the writer shall often in vain trace his memory  at the moment of need, for that which yesterday he knew with intuitive  readiness, and which will come uncalled into his thoughts tomorrow.    In this work, when it shall be found that much is omitted, let  it not be forgotten that much likewise is performed; and though  no book was ever spared out of tenderness to the authour, and the  world is little solicitous to know whence proceeded the faults of  that which it condemns; yet it may gratify curiosity to inform it,  that the English Dictionary was written with little assistance of  the learned, and without any patronage of the great; not in the  soft obscurities of retirement, or under the shelter of academick  bowers, but amidst inconvenience and distraction, in sickness and  in sorrow. It may repress the triumph of malignant criticism to  observe, that if our language is not here fully displayed, I have  only failed in an attempt which no human powers have hitherto  completed. If the lexicons of ancient tongues, now immutably fixed,  and comprised in a few volumes, be yet, after the toil of successive  ages, inadequate and delusive; if the aggregated knowledge, and  co-operating diligence of the Italian academicians, did not secure  them from the censure of Beni; if the embodied criticks of France,  when fifty years had been spent upon their work, were obliged to  change its oeconomy, and give their second edition another form,  I may surely be contented without the praise of perfection, which,  if I could obtain, in this gloom of solitude, what would it avail  me? I have protracted my work till most of those whom I wished to  please have sunk into the grave, and success and miscarriage are  empty sounds: I therefore dismiss it with frigid tranquillity,  having little to fear or hope from censure or from praise."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54331"],[0,"Life of a Pioneer: Being the Autobiography of James S.
