Nevertheless, Narcisso was madam's chosen  attendant at her curtain side, where occasionally Cicada would detect  some movement, or the shadow of one, which convinced him that the two  were in stealthy communication. Indeed, he had posted himself where he  was, with no other purpose than to watch for such a sign.    Once he saw the hem of the curtain lift ever so slightly, and Narcisso  at the same instant respond, with a secret movement of his hand, towards  the place.  Something glittered momentarily, and was extinguished.  Cicada stretched himself in his saddle, and began to whistle.    Presently he pushed ahead once more and joined his master.  Opening with  some jest, he led him away, and they fell into an amble together.  Afterwards it was apparent to some of Messer Lanti's following that, as  the morning advanced, their lord's brow darkened from its early rude  frankness, and began to exhibit certain tokens of a wakening devil with  which they had plenty of reason to be familiar.  Perhaps he wanted his  dinner. Perhaps the near-approaching termination of his summer  idyll--for they were long now in the great Lombardy plain, and the  towers of Milan were growing, low and small, out of the horizon--was  depressing him.  Anyhow, his first condescension was all gone by noon,  when they halted, a league short of the city, to rest and dine at the  'Angel and Tower,' a prosperous inn of the suburbs set among mellowing  vineyards.    Of all the company Bernardo was perhaps the only one unconscious of the  threatening atmosphere.  Wonderful thoughts were kindling in him at the  near prospect of this, the goal to all his hopes and ambitions.  Milan!  It was Milan at last--the capital of his promised estate of love.  Blue  and small, swimming far away in the sun mists of the plains, he felt  that he could clasp it all in his arms, and carry it to the foot of the  Throne.  His eyes brightened with clear tears: this salvage of the dark,  dead ages reclaimed to God!  '_Domine!_' he exclaimed in ecstasy,  clasping his hands: '_Emitte lucem tuam et veritatem tuam_!  O Lord,  touch mine eyes, that they may penetrate even where Thy light shineth  like a glow-worm in deep mosses!'    Carlo roughly shouted him to their meal.  His heart was throbbing with  an emotional rapture as he obeyed. The table was served in a trellised  alley, under hanging stalactites of grapes.  Beatrice flagged on a bench  at the end of the board, her shoulders sunk into a bower all crushed of  sunshine and green shadows.  It was the vine-goddess come home, soft,  sensual, making a lust of fatigue.  Her lids were half-closed; her teeth  showed in a small, indolent smile; light, reflected from the purple  clusters, slept on the warm ivory of her skin.  Bernardo, coming  opposite her, stood transfixed before a vision of such utter animal  loveliness.  His breath seemed to mount quicker as he gazed.  Carlo  drummed on the board, where he sat hunched over it.  Looking from one to  the other, he puffed out a little ironic laugh.    'Wonderest what is passing there, boy?' said he. 'Wilt never know.  Not  a hair would she turn though, like Althea, she were to find herself in  child with a firebrand.'    Bernardo lowered his eyes with a blush.    'Nay,' said he, 'my thoughts of Madonna were more tempered.  I coveted  only her beauty for heaven.'    'Anon, Messer, anon!' cried the other banteringly: 'be not so free with  my property.  I hold her yet about the waist, seest, with a silver  fetter?  If there be a prior claim to mine----'    'Ay, Chastity's,' put in the boy.    Lanti hooted.    'Tempt her, if thou wilt, with such a suitor.  She will follow him as  she would the hangman.  Wilt throw off thy belt, Beatrice?  I gave a  thousand scudi for it.  See what Chastity here will offer thee in its  room.'    'I will answer, if I may examine it,' said Bembo gravely.  'Will you  tell her to unclasp it, Carlo, and let me look?  I see it is all hinged  of antique coins.  There was a Father at San Zeno collected such  things.'    'What, ladies' girdles!'    'Now, Carlo! you know I mean the coins.  Methinks I recognise a text in  one of them.'    Beatrice shrugged her shoulders, with a little yawn expressive of  intolerable boredom.    'Well,' quoth Lanti impatiently, 'let him see it, you and he shall  parable us for grace to meat, while these laggard dogs'--he looked over  his shoulder, growling for his dinner.    Beatrice unclasped the cincture without a word, and flung it  indifferently across the table.  She had lain as impassive throughout  her own discussing by the others as a slave being negotiated in a  market.  Not a tremor of her eyelids had acknowledged either her lord's  rudeness or Bembo's provisional compliment.    The boy took up the belt and examined it.  He was conscious of a sweet  perfume that had come into his hands with the trinket.  His lips were  parted a little, his cheeks flushed.  Presently he put it down softly,  and looked across at Beatrice.    'It is what I thought,' said he--'the coin, I mean--a denarius of  Tiberius, in the thirty-first year of Our Lord Shall I tell you what it  says to me, Madonna?'    She did not take the trouble to answer.    'Yes,' roared Carlo.    Bembo slung his lute to the front, and began coaxing forth one of those  odd, shy accompaniments of his, into which, a moment later, his voice  melted:--        'When Tiberius was Emperor,      For thirty silver pieces bearing his image      Did Judas betray his Lord;      Then, himself betrayed to blood-guilt, cast them ringing      On the flags of the Temple, and maddened forth and died.      But the Jew elders eyed askance      The sleek, round coins, accurst and yet no whit      Depreciated as currency,      And ogling them and each other, were silent, till one spoke:      \"Ill come; well sped.  We need a place to bury the dead.      Let the Potter take these, and in return      Change us his field, o'er which we long have haggled.      So shall this outlay bring us two-fold profit,      Yet leave us conscience-clean before the Lord.\"        Thus, gentles dear, was bought \"The Field of Blood\";      And thus the wicked, damned price returned      Into the veins of traffic, there to circulate      And poison where it ran.      One piece found Hope, and changed was for Despair;      And Charity one led to hoard for self;      And one reached Faith, and Faith became a whore.      But, most of all, what had betrayed Love sore,      Sweet Love was used to betray for evermore.'      His voice broke on a long-drawn wailing chord.  A little silence  succeeded.  Then, like one spent, he took up the belt and offered it to  Beatrice.    'O Madonna!' he said, 'it is a denarius of the Caesar that betrayed  Love.  Take back thy wages.'    She dragged down a spray of vine-leaves, and fanned herself furiously  with it, making no other response.    'So!  I am Judas!' cried Carlo; and began to bite his moustache,  mouthing and glowering.    'Love!' he sputtered, 'love!  Is there no love in nature?  You talk of  the human God, you----'    Beatrice broke in scornfully:--    'It is the world-wisdom of the monastery.  He shall sing you love only  by the Litany.  His queen shall be a virgin immaculate, and her bosom a  shrine for the white lambs of chastity to fold in.  A fine proselyte for  passion's understanding!  I would not be so converted for all  Palestine.'    Carlo laughed, with some fierce recovery to good-humour.    'Hearest her, Bernardo?  Thou shalt not prevail there, unless by  convincing that thou speak'st from experience.'    Bembo had sunk down upon the bench, where, resting languidly, he still  fingered the strings of his lute.  Now suddenly, steadfastly, he looked  across at the girl, and began to sing again:--        'Love kept me an hour      From all hours that pass;      In her breast, like a flower,      She stored it, sweet, fragrant,      Of all time the vagrant,        Alas, and alas!        Of all time the flower,      Of all hours that pass,      For me was that hour,      When I cared claim it,      And kiss it and shame it,        Alas, and alas!        I dared not, sweet hour--      I let thee go pass;      And heaven is my dower.      My crown is stars seven:      I am a saint in heaven,        Alas, and alas!'      He never took his eyes, while he sang, off the wondering face opposite  him.  It was strangely transformed by the end--flesh startled out of  ivory--the face of a wakened Galatea.  Narcisso coming at the moment to  place the first dishes of the meal before the company, she sat up, her  hands to her bosom, with a quick, agitated movement.    'It is well,' she said.  'I am thy convert, saint in heaven!'  She  lifted the dish before her, and held it out with a nervous smile.  'Let  us exchange pledges, by the token.  Give me thy meat, and take mine.'    Carlo, watching and listening, knitted his brow in a sudden frown, and  his hand stole down to his belt.    'Give me thy dish,' said Beatrice, almost with entreaty.    Bernardo laughed.  With the finish of his madrigal he had pushed his  lute, in a hurry of pink shame, to his shoulder.    'Nay, Madonna,' he protested.  'Like the simplest doctor, I but spoke my  qualifications.  Feeling is half-way to curing, and the best recommended  physician is he who hath practised on himself.  I ask no reward but thy  forbearance.'    'Give it me,' she still said.  She was on her feet.  She kissed the rim  of the dish.  'Wilt thou refuse now? Bid him to, Carlo.'    'Not I,' said Lanti.  'Hath not, no more than myself, been whipped into  the classics for nothing?  _Quod ali cibus est aliis fuat acre venenum_.  We know what that means, he and I.'    She seemed to turn very pale.
