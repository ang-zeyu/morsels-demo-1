The special terminology peculiar to the different groups is  dealt with in the separate introductions to each of the three parts of  this volume.      (I.)    No group of animals offers greater difficulty than the sponges,  hydroids, and polyzoa (and especially the freshwater representatives of  these three groups) as regards the question \"What is a species?\" and the  kindred questions, \"What is a subspecies?\" \"What is a variety?\" and  \"What is a phase?\" Genera can often be left to look after themselves,  but the specific and kindred questions are answered in so many different  ways, if they are even considered, by different systematists, especially  as regards the groups described in this volume, that I feel it necessary  to state concisely my own answers to these questions, not for the  guidance of other zoologists but merely to render intelligible the  system of classification here adopted. The following definitions should  therefore be considered in estimating the value of \"species,\" etc.,  referred to in the following pages.    _Species._--A group of individuals differing in constant characters of a  definite nature and of systematic[I] importance from all others in the  same genus.         [Footnote I: \"What characters are of systematic importance?\"       is a question to which different answers must be given in       the case of different groups.]    _Subspecies._--An isolated or local race, the individuals of which  differ from others included in the same species in characters that are  constant but either somewhat indefinite or else of little systematic  importance.    _Variety._--A group of individuals not isolated geographically from  others of the same species but nevertheless exhibiting slight, not  altogether constant, or indefinite differences from the typical form of  the species (_i. e._, the form first described).    _Phase._--A peculiar form assumed by the individuals of a species which  are exposed to peculiarities in environment and differ from normal  individuals as a direct result.    There are cases in which imperfection of information renders it  difficult or impossible to distinguish between a variety and a  subspecies. In such cases it is best to call the form a variety, for  this term does not imply any special knowledge as regards its  distribution or the conditions in which it is found.    I use the term \"form\" in a general sense of which the meaning or  meanings are clear without explanation.      (II.)    The question of type specimens must be considered briefly. There are two  schools of systematists, those who assert that one specimen and one only  must be the type of a species, and those who are willing to accept  several specimens as types. From the theoretical point of view it seems  impossible to set up any one individual as the ideal type of a species,  but those who possess collections or are in charge of museums prefer,  with the natural instinct of the collector, to have a definite single  type (of which no one else can possibly possess a duplicate) in their  possession or care, and there is always the difficulty that a zoologist  in describing a species, if he recognizes more than one type, may  include as types specimens that really belong to more than one species.  These difficulties are met by some zoologists by the recognition of  several specimens as paratypes, all of equal value; but this, after all,  is merely a terminological means of escaping from the difficulty,  calculated to salve the conscience of a collector who feels unwilling to  give up the unique type of a species represented by other specimens in  his collection. The difficulty as regards the confounding of specimens  of two or more species as the types of one can always be adjusted if the  author who discovers the mistake redescribes one of the species under  the original name and regards the specimen that agrees with his  description as the type, at the same time describing a new species with  another of the specimens as its type. Personally I always desire to  regard the whole material that forms the basis of an original  description of a species as the type, but museum rules often render this  impossible, and the best that can be done is to pick out one specimen  that seems particularly characteristic and to call it the type, the rest  of the material being termed co-types. A peculiar difficulty arises,  however, as regards many of the sponges, coelenterates, and polyzoa,  owing to the fact that they are often either compound animals, each  specimen consisting of more than one individual, or are easily divisible  into equivalent fragments. If the single type theory were driven to its  logical conclusion, it would be necessary to select one particular polyp  in a hydroid colony, or even the part of a sponge that surrounded a  particular osculum as the type of the species to which the hydroid or  the sponge belonged. Either by accident or by design specimens of  Spongillidae, especially if kept dry, are usually broken into several  pieces. There is, as a matter of fact, no reason to attribute the  peculiarly sacrosanct nature of a type to one piece more than another.  In such cases the biggest piece may be called the type, while the  smaller pieces may be designated by the term \"schizotype.\"    The more precise definition of such terms as topotype, genotype, _et  hujus generis omnis_ is nowadays a science (or at any rate a form of  technical industry) by itself and need not be discussed here.      (III.)    In 1908 an influential committee of British zoologists drew up a  strenuous protest against the unearthing of obsolete zoological names  (see 'Nature,' Aug. 1908, p. 395). To no group does this protest apply  with greater force than to the three discussed in this volume. It is  difficult, however, to adopt any one work as a standard of nomenclature  for the whole of any one of them. As regards the Spongillidae it is  impossible to accept any monograph earlier than Potts's \"Fresh-Water  Sponges\" (P. Ac. Philad., 1887), for Bowerbank's and Carter's earlier  monographs contained descriptions of comparatively few species. Even  Potts's monograph I have been unable to follow without divergence, for  it seems to me necessary to recognize several genera and subgenera that  he ignored. The freshwater polyzoa, however, were dealt with in so  comprehensive a manner by Allman in his \"Fresh-Water Polyzoa\" (London,  1856) that no difficulty is experienced in ignoring, so far as  nomenclature is concerned, any earlier work on the group; while as  regards other divisions of the polyzoa I have followed Hincks's \"British  Marine Polyzoa\" (1880), so far as recent researches permit. In most  cases I have not attempted to work out an elaborate synonymy of species  described earlier than the publication of the works just cited, for to  do so is a mere waste of time in the case of animals that call for a  most precise definition of species and genera and yet were often  described, so far as they were known earlier than the dates in question,  in quite general terms. I have been confirmed in adopting this course by  the fact that few of the types of the earlier species are now in  existence, and that a large proportion of the Indian forms have only  been described within the last few years.      MATERIAL.    The descriptions in this volume are based on specimens in the collection  of the Indian Museum, the Trustees of which, by the liberal manner in  which they have permitted me to travel in India and Burma on behalf of  the Museum, have made it possible not only to obtain material for study  and exchange but also to observe the different species in their natural  environment. This does not mean to say that specimens from other  collections have been ignored, for many institutions and individuals  have met us generously in the matter of gifts and exchanges, and our  collection now includes specimens of all the Indian forms, named in  nearly all cases by the author of the species, except in those of  species described long ago of which no authentic original specimens can  now be traced. Pieces of the types of all of the Indian Spongillidae  described by Carter have been obtained from the British Museum through  the kind offices of Mr. R. Kirkpatrick. The Smithsonian Institution has  sent us from the collection of the United States National Museum  specimens named by Potts, and the Berlin Museum specimens named by  Weltner, while to the Imperial Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg we  owe many unnamed but interesting sponges. Dr. K. Kraepelin and Dr. W.  Michaelsen have presented us with specimens of most of the species and  varieties of freshwater polyzoa described by the former in his great  monograph and elsewhere. We owe to Dr. S. F. Harmer, formerly of the  Cambridge University Museum and now Keeper in Zoology at the British  Museum, to Professor Max Weber of Amsterdam, Professor Oka of Tokyo, and  several other zoologists much valuable material. I would specially  mention the exquisite preparations presented by Mr. C. Rousselet.  Several naturalists in India have also done good service to the Museum  by presenting specimens of the three groups described in this volume,  especially Major H. J. Walton, I.M.S., Major J. Stephenson, I.M.S., Dr.  J. R. Henderson and Mr. G. Matthai of Madras, and Mr. R. Shunkara  Narayana Pillay of Trivandrum.    The following list shows where the types of the various species,  subspecies, and varieties are preserved, so far as it has been possible  to trace them. I have included in this list the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36564"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 4, No. 3, October, 1851 (#6)"],[1,"I have been talking about, are       always ready, when the world generally has awarded the       honors of successful authorship to any of our mad tribe, to       come in and confirm the award, and _buy_, if not read, the       popular book. And so they are not wholly without their uses       in this world. But woe to him who seeks to _climb_ amongst       them. An author must avoid them until he is already mounted       on the platform, and can look down on them, and make them       ashamed to show their dulness by keeping their hands in       their breeches pockets, whilst the rest of the world are       taking theirs out to give money or to applaud with. I am       wasting my letter with these people, but for fear you may       think I am chagrined or cut by what I abuse them for, I must       say that they suit one half of my character, moods, and       pursuits, in being good kindly men, rare table companions,       many of them great in field sports, and most of them rather       deficient in letters than mind; and that, in an every-day       sense of the words, I love and am beloved by them.\"    Soon afterward he wrote:         \"Mr. Kennedy's assurance that you would find a publisher for       my poems leaves me without any further excuse for not       collecting them. If not the most devoted, truly you are the       most serviceable, of my friends, but it is because Mr.       Kennedy has overpraised me to you. Your letter makes me feel       as if I had always known you intimately, and I have a       presentiment that you will counteract my idleness and       good-for-nothingness, and that, hoisted on your shoulders I       shall not be lost under the feet of the crowd, nor left       behind in a fence corner. I am profoundly grateful for the       kindness which dictated what you have done, and to show you       that I will avail myself of it, I inclose a proem to the       pieces of which I wrote you in my last.\"    The poem referred to was so beautiful that we asked and obtained permission  to put it in Graham's Magazine, of which we were at that time editor. The  author's name was not given, and it excited much curiosity, as but two or  three of our poets were thought capable of such a performance, and there  was no reason why one of them should print any thing anonymously. It was  most commonly, however, attributed to Mr. Willis, at which Mr. Cooke was  highly gratified. The piece, which was entitled \"Emily,\" contained about  three hundred lines, and was a feigned history of the composition of tales  designed to follow it, exquisitely told, and sprinkled all along with gems  that could have come from only a mine of surpassing richness. For examples:        Young Emily has temples fair      Caress'd by locks of dark brown hair.      A thousand sweet humanities      Speak wisely from her hazel eyes.      Her speech is ignorant of command,      And yet can lead you like a hand.      Her white teeth sparkle, when the eclipse      Is laughter-moved, of her red lips.      She moves, all grace, with gliding limbs      As a white-breasted cygnet swims.        I know some wilds, where tulip trees,      Full of the singing toil of bees,      Depend their loving branches over      Great rocks, which honeysuckles cover      In rich and liberal overflow.      In the dear time of long ago      When I had woo'd young Emily,      And she had told her love to me,      I often found her in these bowers,      Quite rapt away in meditation,      Or giving earnest contemplation      To leaf, or bird, or wild-wood flowers;      And once I heard the maiden singing,      Until the very woods were ringing----      Singing an old song to the hours!    One jocund morn:        I found her where a flowering tree      Gave odors and cool shade. Her cheek      A little rested on her hand;      Her rustic skill had made a band      Of rare device which garlanded      The beauty of her bending head;      Some maiden thoughts most kind and wise      Were dimly burning in her eyes.      When I beheld her--form and face      So lithe, so fair--the spirit race,      Of whom the better poets dream'd,      Came to my thought, and I half deem'd      My earth-born mistress, pure and good,      Was some such lady of the wood,      As she who work'd at spell, and snare,      With Huon of the dusky hair,      And fled, in likeness of a doe,      Before the fleet youth Angelo.      But these infirm imaginings      Flew quite away on instant wings.      I call'd her name. A swift surprise      Came whitely to her face, but soon      It fled before some daintier dyes,      And, laughing like a brook in June,      With sweet accost she welcomed me.      It was a golden day to me,      And its great bliss is with me yet,      Warming like wine my inmost heart----      For memories of happy hours      Are like the cordials press'd from flowers,      And madden sweetly.    Then the poet recited ancient lays which tell some natural tales; and then:        Pity look'd lovely in the maiden;      Her eyes were softer, when so laden      With the bright dew of tears unshed.      But I was somewhat envious      That other bards should move her thus,      And oft within myself had said,      \"Yea--I will strive to touch her heart      With some fair songs of mine own art\"----      And many days before the day      Whereof I speak, I made essay      At this bold labor. In the wells      Of Froissart's life-like chronicles      I dipp'd for moving truths of old.      A thousand stories, soft and bold,      Of stately dames, and gentlemen,      Which good Lord Berners, with a pen      Pompous in its simplicity,      Yet tipt with charming courtesy,      Had put in English words, I learn'd;      And some of these I deftly turn'd      Into the forms of minstrel verse.      I know the good tales are the worse--      But, sooth to say, it seems to me      My verse has sense and melody----      Even that its measure sometimes flows      With the brave pomp of that old prose.    It was a good while before the promised contents of the book were sent to  us, and Cooke wrote of the delay to a friend:         \"Procrastination is a poison of my very marrow. Moreover,       since 'the first wisping of the leaf,' my whole heart has       been in the woods and the waters--every rising sun that       could be seen, _I have seen_, and I never came in from my       sport until too much used up to do more than adopt this       epitaph of Sardanapalus: 'Eat, drink,' &c. Moreover (2d),       Mr. Kennedy and others were poking me in the ribs eternally       about my poems; and I was driven to the labor of finishing       them. I groaned and did it, and sent them to Griswold, and       have left the task of carrying them through the press to       him; and only lie passive, saying with Don Juan (in the       slave-market of Adrianople, or some other place), 'would to       God somebody would buy me.'\"    At length through his cousin and friend, John P. Kennedy--(a name that  makes one in charity with all mankind)--the MS. of all the poems was sent  to us. It makes a book about the size of the printed volume, written with a  regular elegance to match that of the old copyists. In an accompanying  letter he says:         ... \"They are certainly not in the high key of a man warm       with his subject, and doing the thing finely; I wrote them       with the reluctance of a turkey-hunter kept from his       sport--only Mr. Kennedy's urgent entreaty and remonstrance       whipped me up to the labor. You will hardly perceive how       they should be called \"Ballads.\" You are somewhat       responsible for the name. I designed (originally) to make       them short poems of the old understood ballad cast. I sent       you the proem, which you published as a preface to the       \"Froissart Ballads.\" Words in print bore a look of       perpetuity (or rather of fixedness) about them, and what I       would have changed if only my pen and portfolio had been       concerned, your type deterred me from changing. The term       \"Froissart Ballads,\" however, is after all correct, even       with the poems as they are. The Master of Bolton is as much       a _song_ as the Lay of the Last Minstrel, although I have no       prologue, interludes, &c., to show how it was sung; and as       for Orthone, &c. Sir John Froissart may as easily be       imagined chanting them as talking them.\"    Again he wrote:         \"You will find them beneath your sanguine prognostic. They       are mere narrative poems, designed for the crowd. Poetic       speculation, bold inroads upon the debatable land--\"the wild       weird clime, out of space out of time\"--I have not here       attempted. I _will_ hereafter merge myself in the nobler       atmosphere; in the mean time I have stuck to the ordinary       level, and endeavored to write interesting stories in verse,       with grace and spirit. I repeat my fear that in writing for       the cold, I have failed to touch the quick and warm--in       writing for a dozen hunting comrades, who have been in the       habit of making my verse a _post prandium_ entertainment,       and never endured an audacity of thought or word, I have       tamed myself out of your approbation.\"    The book was at length published, but though reviewed very favorably by the  late Judge Beverly Tucker, in the Southern Literary Messenger, and by Mr.  Poe, in the American Review, and much quoted and praised elsewhere, it was,  on the whole, not received according to its merits or our expectations. Yet  the result aroused the author's ambition, and after a few weeks he remarked  in a letter:         \"My literary life opens now. If the world manifest any       disposition to hear my 'utterances,' it will be abundantly       gratified. I am thirty: until forty literature shall be my       calling--avoiding however to rely upon it pecuniarily--then       (after forty) politics will be "]]]
