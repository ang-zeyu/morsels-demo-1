[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37215"],[0,"The Argus Pheasant (#6)"],[1," the  junk must have observed the figure of his fellow countryman on the hill,  for he also shaded his eyes with his arm.    Cho Seng looked quickly to the right--to the left. There was no one  stirring. The sentinel at the gate drowsed against the carriage of the  saucy brass cannon. Shading his eyes once more with a quick gesture, Cho  Seng walked ten paces ahead. Then he walked back five paces. Making a  sharp angle he walked five paces to one side. Then he turned abruptly  and faced the jungle.    The watcher on the junk gave no sign that he had seen this curious  performance. But as Cho Seng scuttled back into the house, he  disappeared into the bowels of the ugly hulk.    An hour passed before Cho Seng reappeared on the veranda. He cast only  a casual glance at the junk and saw that it was being provisioned. After  listening for a moment to the rhythmic snoring that came from the  chamber above--Mynheer Muller's apartment--he turned the corner of the  house and set off at a leisurely pace toward the tangle of mangroves,  banyan, bamboo cane, and ferns that lay a quarter of a mile inland on  the same elevation on which the settlement and stockade stood.    There was nothing in his walk to indicate that he had a definite  objective. He strolled along in apparent aimlessness, as though taking a  morning's constitutional. Overhead hundreds of birds created a terrific  din; green and blue-billed gapers shrilled noisily; lories piped their  matin lays, and the hoarse cawing of the trogons mingled discordantly  with the mellow notes of the mild cuckoos. A myriad insect life buzzed  and hummed around him, and scurried across his pathway. Pale white  flowers of the night that lined the wall shrank modestly into their  green cloisters before the bold eye of day. But Cho Seng passed them by  unseeing, and unhearing. Nature had no existence for him except as it  ministered unto his physical needs. Only once did he turn aside--a  quick, panicky jump--and that was when a little spotted snake glided in  front of him and disappeared into the underbrush.    When he was well within the shadows of the mangroves, Cho Seng suddenly  brightened and began to look about him keenly. Following a faintly  defined path, he walked along in a circuitous route until he came to a  clearing under the shade of a huge banyan tree whose aerial roots rose  over his head. After peering furtively about and seeing no one he  uttered a hoarse, guttural call, the call the great bird of paradise  utters to welcome the sunrise--\"Wowk, wowk, wowk.\"    There was an immediate answer--the shrill note of the argus pheasant. It  sounded from the right, near by, on the other side of a thick tangle of  cane and creeper growth. Cho Seng paused in apparent disquietude at the  border of the thicket, but as he hesitated, the call was repeated more  urgently. Wrenching the cane apart, he stepped carefully into the  underbrush.    His progress through it was slow. At each step he bent low to make  certain where his foot fell. He had a mortal fear of snakes--his  nightmares were ghastly dreams of a loathsome death from a serpent's  bite.    There was a low ripple of laughter--girlish laughter. Cho Seng  straightened quickly. To his right was another clearing, and in that  clearing there was a woman, a young woman just coming into the bloom of  a glorious beauty. She was seated on a gnarled aerial root. One leg was  negligently thrown over the other, a slender, shapely arm reached  gracefully upward to grasp a spur from another root, a coil of silky  black hair, black as tropic night, lay over her gleaming shoulder. Her  sarong, spotlessly white, hung loosely about her wondrous form and was  caught with a cluster of rubies above her breasts. A sandal-covered  foot, dainty, delicately tapering, its whiteness tanned with a faint  tint of harvest brown, was thrust from the folds of the gown. At her  side, in a silken scabbard, hung a light, skilfully wrought kris. The  handle was studded with gems.    \"Good-morning, Cho Seng,\" the woman greeted demurely.    Cho Seng, making no reply, snapped the cane aside and leaped through.  Koyala laughed again, her voice tinkling like silver bells. The  Chinaman's laborious progress through the cane had amused her. She knew  why he stepped so carefully.    \"Good-morning, Cho Seng,\" Koyala repeated. Her mocking dark brown eyes  tried to meet his, but Cho Seng looked studiedly at the ground, in the  affected humility of Oriental races.    \"Cho Seng here,\" he announced. \"What for um you wantee me?\" He spoke  huskily; a physician would instantly have suspected he was tubercular.    Koyala's eyes twinkled. A woman, she knew she was beautiful. Wherever  she went, among whites or Malays, Chinese, or Papuans, she was admired.  But from this stolid, unfathomable, menial Chinaman she had never been  able to evoke the one tribute that every pretty woman, no manner how  good, demands from man--a glance of admiration.    \"Cho Seng,\" she pouted, \"you have not even looked at me. Am I so ugly  that you cannot bear to see me?\"    \"What for um you wantee me?\" Cho Seng reiterated. His neck was crooked  humbly so that his eyes did not rise above the hem of her sarong, and  his hands were tucked inside the wide sleeves of his jacket. His voice  was as meek and mild and inoffensive as his manner.    Koyala laughed mischievously.    \"I asked you a question, Cho Seng,\" she pointed out.    The Chinaman salaamed again, even lower than before. His face was  imperturbable as he repeated in the same mild, disarming accents:    \"What for um you wantee me?\"    Koyala made a moue.    \"That isn't what I asked you, Cho Seng,\" she exclaimed petulantly.    The Chinaman did not move a muscle. Silent, calm as a deep-sea bottom,  his glance fixed unwaveringly on a little spot of black earth near  Koyala's foot, he awaited her reply.    Leveque's daughter shrugged her shoulders in hopeless resignation. Ever  since she had known him she had tried to surprise him into expressing  some emotion. Admiration, fear, grief, vanity, cupidity--on all these  chords she had played without producing response. His imperturbability  roused her curiosity, his indifference to her beauty piqued her, and,  womanlike, she exerted herself to rouse his interest that she might  punish him. So far she had been unsuccessful, but that only gave keener  zest to the game. Koyala was half Dyak, she had in her veins the blood  of the little brown brother who follows his enemy for months, sometimes  years, until he brings home another dripping head to set on his  lodge-pole. Patience was therefore her birthright.    \"Very well, Cho Seng, if you think I am ugly--\" She paused and arched an  eyebrow to see the effect of her words. Cho Seng's face was as rigid as  though carved out of rock. When she saw he did not intend to dispute  her, Koyala flushed and concluded sharply:    \"--then we will talk of other things. What has happened at the residency  during the past week?\"    Cho Seng shot a furtive glance upward. \"What for um?\" he asked  cautiously.    \"Oh, everything.\" Koyala spoke with pretended indifference. \"Tell me,  does your _baas_, the _mynheer_, ever mention me?\"    \"Mynheer Muller belly much mad, belly much drink _jenever_ (gin), belly  much say 'damn-damn, Cho Seng,'\" the Chinaman grunted.    Koyala's laughter rang out merrily in delicious peals that started the  rain-birds and the gapers to vain emulation. Cho Seng hissed a warning  and cast apprehensive glances about the jungle, but Koyala, mocking the  birds, provoked a hubbub of furious scolding overhead and laughed again.    \"There's nobody near to hear us,\" she asserted lightly.    \"Mebbe him in bush,\" Cho Seng warned.    \"Not when the southeast monsoon ceases to blow,\" Koyala negatived.  \"Mynheer Muller loves his bed too well when our Bornean sun scorches us  like to-day. But tell me what your master has been doing?\"    She snuggled into a more comfortable position on the root. Cho Seng  folded his hands over his stomach.    \"Morning him sleep,\" he related laconically. \"Him eat. Him speakee  _orang kaya_, Wobanguli, drink _jenever_. Him speakee Kapitein Van  Slyck, drink _jenever_. Him sleep some more. Bimeby when sun so-so--\"  Cho Seng indicated the position of the sun in late afternoon--\"him go  speakee Mynheer Blauwpot, eat some more. Bimeby come home, sleep. Plenty  say 'damn-damn, Cho Seng.'\"    \"Does he ever mention me?\" Koyala asked. Her eyes twinkled coquettishly.    \"Plenty say nothing,\" Cho Seng replied.    Koyala's face fell. \"He doesn't speak of me at all?\"    Cho Seng shot a sidelong glance at her.    \"Him no speakee Koyala, him plenty drink _jenever_, plenty say  'damn-damn, Cho Seng.'\" He looked up stealthily to see the effect of his  words.    Koyala crushed a fern underfoot with a vicious dab of her sandaled toes.  Something like the ghost of a grin crossed the Chinaman's face, but it  was too well hidden for Koyala to see it.    \"How about Kapitein Van Slyck? Has he missed me?\" Koyala asked. \"It is a  week since I have been at the residency. He must have noticed it.\"    \"Kapitein Van Slyck him no speakee Koyala,\" the Chinaman declared.    Koyala looked at him sternly. \"I cannot believe that, Cho Seng,\" she  said. \"The captain must surely have noticed that I have not been in  Amsterdam. You are not telling me an untruth, are you, Cho Seng?\"    The Chinaman was meekness incarnate as he reiterated:    \"Him no speakee Koyala.\"    Displeasure gathered on Koyala's face like a storm-cloud. She leaped  suddenly from the aerial root and drew herself upright. At the same  moment she seemed to undergo a curious transformation. The light,  coquettish mood passed away like dabs of sunlight under a fitful April  sky, an imperious light gleamed in her eyes and her voice rang with  authority as she said:    \"Cho Seng, you are the eyes and the ears of Ah Sing in Bulungan--\"    The Chinaman interrupted her with a sibilant hiss. His "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3725"],[0,"Famous Men of the Middle Ages (#6)"],[1,"   They were continually invading countries belonging to the Romans  and their warlike raids were dreaded by the emperors of the Eastern  Roman Empire, who lived at Constantinople. One emperor gave them  land and money, and thus stopped their invasions for a time.    The most famous of the Ostrogoth kings was The-od'or-ic the Great.  He was the son of The-od'e-mir, who was also a king of the Ostrogoths.  When Theodoric was eight years old he was sent to Constantinople to  be held as a hostage by Leo, the Emperor of the East. In former  times, when kings made treaties with one another, it was customary  for one to give to the other a pledge or security that he would  fulfill the conditions of the treaty. The pledge usually given  was some important person or persons, perhaps the king's son or a  number of his chief men. Persons so given as a security were called  hostages. When Theodoric was a boy he was given as a hostage for  his father's good faith in carrying out a treaty with the Emperor  and was sent to Constantinople to live. Here the youth was well  treated by Leo. He was educated with great care and trained in  all the exercises of war.    Theodemir died in 475, and then Theodoric returned to his own country  and became king of the Ostrogoths. At this time he was eighteen  years of age. He was handsome and brave and people loved him, for  in those days a man who was tall and strong and brave was liked  by everybody.    II    For some years after he became king Theodoric had frequent wars  with other Gothic kings and also with the Roman Emperor Ze'no.  He was nearly always successful in battle, and at last Zeno began  to think it would be better to try to make friends with him. So  he gave Theodoric some rich lands and made him commander of the  Imperial Guard of Constantinople.    But the Emperor soon became tired of having the Ostrogoth king at  his court, and to get rid of him he agreed that Theodoric should  go with his army to Italy, and take that country from O-do-a'-cer.  Theodoric was delighted at the proposal and began at once to make  his preparations.    Odoacer was at that time king of Italy. Before he became king he  had been a general in the army of Romulus Augustulus, the Western  Roman Emperor. The soldiers of the army were not satisfied with  their pay, and when they asked for more they did not get it. Then  they drove Romulus Augustulus from the throne, and chose Odoacer  to succeed him. But Odoacer would not take the name of emperor.  He was called the \"patrician\" of Italy, and he ruled the country  well.    Theodoric started for Italy, not only with a great army, but with  all the people of his country. He meant to take Italy and be its  king and settle in it with all his Ostrogoths. When he set out he  had with him two hundred and fifty thousand persons--men, women,  and children--with a great number of horses and wagons to carry  them and their things. He had also an army of sixty thousand brave  soldiers.    It was a long and weary journey from the shores of the Black Sea  overland to the foot of the Alps Mountains and across the Alps  into Italy. Here and there on the way they met savage tribes that  tried to stop them, but Theodoric defeated the savages and took  a great many of them prisoners. He made these prisoners, women  as well as men, help carry the baggage and do other work.    [Illustration: INVASION OF BARBARIANS]    The journey took months, but at last the Ostrogoths reached the  top of the Alps. Then they could see, stretched out before them,  the beautiful land of Italy. They were all delighted. They shouted  and danced with joy, and Theodoric cried out:    \"There is the country which shall be our home. Let us march on.  It certainly shall be ours.\"    Then they passed quickly down, and soon they were in Italy. Odoacer  had heard of their coming and he got ready an army to drive them  away. Theodoric also got his fighting men ready. The two armies  met, and there was a great battle near the town of Aquileia. Odoacer  was defeated. Then he tried to get Theodoric to leave Italy by  offering him a large sum of money.    \"I will give you,\" said he, \"thousands of pounds of gold and silver  if you agree to go back to your own country.\"    But Theodoric would not go. He said he had as good a right to be  king of Italy as Odoacer, and he would remain and conquer the country  and be its king. Soon after there was another battle, near Verona,  and Odoacer was again defeated.    Theodoric came very near being killed in battle. He was saved only  by the courage of his mother. She was in his camp, and at one time  she saw a number of the Ostrogoths running away from that part  of the battle-field where her son was fighting, thus leaving him  without support. The mother rushed forward and stopped the fleeing  men. She made them feel that it was a shame for them to desert  their leader, and they at once returned to the field and fought  beside their king until the battle was won.    After the battle of Verona, Odoacer went with his army to the city  of Ravenna, and remained there for some time. Theodoric followed  with his Ostrogoths and tried to take the city, but there was a  very strong wall around it, and the Ostrogoths could not capture  it. Although Theodoric was not able to take Ravenna, he did not  remain idle. He marched off to other parts of the country, and  took possession of towns and districts wherever he went.    After a while Odoacer got together a better army than he had before,  and made another effort to defeat Theodoric. But he again failed.  Theodoric defeated him in another great battle, which was fought  on the banks of the River Adda. After this battle Odoacer again  fled to Ravenna. Theodoric followed again and laid siege to the  city. This time his army surrounded it and kept provisions from  being sent in, and at last, when there was no food in the city  for the soldiers or the people to eat, Odoacer had to surrender.    A treaty was then made between the two kings and both agreed that  they should rule together over Italy, each to have equal power. But  a few days afterwards Theodoric murdered Odoacer while sitting at  a banquet, and then made himself the sole king of Italy. He divided  one-third of the land of the country among his own followers. So the  Ostrogoths settled in Italy, and Ostrogoths, Romans, and Visigoths  were governed by Theodoric as one people.    Theodoric died at the age of seventy-one after ruling Italy for  thirty-three years.          CLOVIS    KING FROM 481-511 A.D.    I    While the power of the Roman Empire was declining there dwelt on  the banks of the River Rhine a number of savage Teuton tribes called  Franks. The word Frank means _free_, and those tribes took pride  in being known as Franks or freemen.    The Franks occupied the east bank of the Rhine for about two hundred  years. Then many of the tribes crossed the river in search of new  homes. The region west of the river was at that time called Gaul.  Here the Franks established themselves and became a powerful people.  From their name the country was afterwards called _France_.    Each tribe of the Franks had its own king. The greatest of all  these kings was Chlodwig, or Clovis, as we call him, who became  ruler of his tribe in the year 481, just six years after Theodoric  became king of the Ostrogoths. Clovis was then only sixteen years  of age. But though he was so young he proved in a very short time  that he could govern as well as older men. He was intelligent and  brave. No one ever knew him to be afraid of anything even when  he was but a child. His father, who was named Chil'der-ic, often  took him to wars which the Franks had with neighboring tribes, and  he was very proud of his son's bravery. The young man was also a  bold and skillful horseman. He could tame and ride the most fiery  horse.    When Clovis became king of the Franks a great part of Gaul still  belonged to Rome. This part was then governed by a Roman general,  named Sy-ag'ri-us. Clovis resolved to drive the Romans out of the  country, and he talked over the matter with the head men of his  army.    \"My desire,\" said he, \"is that the Franks shall have possession of  every part of this fair land. I shall drive the Romans and their  friends away and make Gaul the empire of the Franks.\"    II    At this time the Romans had a great army in Gaul. It was encamped  near the city of Soissons (_swah-son'_) and was commanded by Syagrius.  Clovis resolved to attack it and led his army at once to Soissons.  When he came near the city he summoned Syagrius to surrender. Syagrius  refused and asked for an interview with the commander of the Franks.  Clovis consented to meet him, and an arrangement was made that  the meeting should take place in the open space between the two  armies. When Clovis stepped out in front of his own army, accompanied  by some of his savage warriors, Syagrius also came forward. But  the moment he saw the king of the Franks he laughed loudly and  exclaimed:    \"A boy! A boy has come to fight me! The Franks with a boy to lead  them have come to fight the Romans.\"    Clovis was very angry at this insulting language and shouted back:    \"Ay, but this boy will conquer you.\"    Then both sides prepared for battle. The Romans thought that they  would win the victory easily, but they were mistaken. Every time  that they made a charge upon the Franks they were beaten back by  the warriors of Clovis. The young king himself fought bravely at  the head of his men and with his own sword struck down a number  of the Romans. He tried to find Syagrius and fight with him; but  the Roman commander was nowhere to be found. Early in the battle  he had fled from the field, leaving his men to defend themselves  as best they could.    The Franks gained a great victory. With their gallant boy king  leading them on they drove the Roman's before them, and when the  battle was over they took possession of"]]]
