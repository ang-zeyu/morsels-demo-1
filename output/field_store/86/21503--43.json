The first stages of the development of life in the egg of a bird may be  observed by holding the eggs before a strong light in a darkened room.  White-shelled eggs are the best for this purpose. In about thirty-six  hours from the beginning of incubation it will be found that the germ  has turned red, and little red veins radiate from it somewhat like the  legs of a spider. For several days the egg is quite translucent and the  yolk shows plainly. As the germ grows, the contents of the egg become  clouded and dense, and the air space at the large end of the egg is  clearly defined, the density being greatest near it. From the time that  the egg becomes dense, observations of development must be made by  breaking one or more eggs daily or every few days, according to the  number available for observation.    [Illustration: Fig. 10. Egg before exclusion and partially excluded  chick]    [Illustration: Fig. 11. Light Brahma (day old)]    The embryo grows until it fills the egg. The mere application of heat to  the egg has gradually transformed that little germ and the yellow and  white of egg into bones, flesh, skin (and, in some cases, down), and all  the organs of a living creature. When the embryo has filled the shell,  it lies curled up, usually with the head at the large end of the egg and  the beak almost touching the shell, at about one third of the distance  from the large to the small end of the egg. At the point of the beak of  the young bird on the curved tip of the upper mandible is a small horny  scale. Without this scale it would be hard for the embryo to break the  shell because it cannot, as it lies, strike it a direct blow with the  point of its beak. This scale is a remarkable character. Its only use is  to help the bird out of the shell. A few days after exclusion it  disappears.    If you take a hen's egg about the eighteenth or the nineteenth day of  incubation and hold it closely in your hand, you may be able to feel the  chick move. If your hand is a little bit cold, the chick is much more  likely to squirm in the egg and may utter a peep. If, with the egg in a  warm hand, you hold it to your ear, you will about this time hear an  occasional tap, tap, caused by the chicken striking its beak against the  shell. The tapping is kept up more or less steadily until the shell  cracks where the point of the beak strikes it and a little piece is  broken out. The chick usually rests awhile now,--perhaps for some  hours,--then resumes the attack on the shell. It turns in the shell,  breaking out little pieces as it turns, until there is a crack nearly  all the way around, when, by pushing with its head and feet, it forces  the shell apart and sprawls out of it.    The process is the same for all birds, except that those that take  longest to develop in the shell take a longer rest after first breaking  it. The young of aerial birds, which are naked when hatched, are ugly  little things. Young poultry, too, are almost repulsive with their  sprawling forms and the wet down plastered to the skin, but in a few  hours they grow strong, the down dries and becomes fluffy, the bright  little eyes seem to take in everything, and they are the most attractive  of all baby animals.          CHAPTER III    SPECIES AND THEIR DIVISIONS IN DOMESTIC BIRDS      The three general classes of domestic birds include few species but many  varieties, and, outside of the distinct varieties, an indefinite number  of individual types. Where varieties are as numerous as in the fowl,  which has about three hundred, and the pigeon, which has a much greater  number, the differences between them are often very slight. Sometimes  the form of a single small character is the only distinguishing feature.  But, if this is a fixed character, the variety is distinct. Where there  are so many varieties it is hard to make short, appropriate descriptive  names for all, if considered simply as varieties. For such diversity  there must be a more extended classification. Such a classification,  growing gradually with the increase in the number of varieties, will not  be consistent throughout. Hence to understand clearly the relations of  the artificial divisions of species in domestication we must know what a  species is and how these divisions arise.    =Definition of species.= Species are the natural divisions of living  things. Each plant and animal species retains its distinctive character  through long ages because the individuals composing it can produce  perfect offspring only (if asexual) of themselves, or (if bisexual) with  others of their species.    The self-isolation of species is well illustrated when similar plants  grow together, as grasses in the same field and practically on the same  spot; yet year after year all the old kinds are found and no new ones  such as might come from a mixture of two kinds, if they would mix. In  the higher animals, where the parent forms are of different sexes, they  choose mates of their own kind, and so each species remains distinct;  but if in a species there are many different types, such as we find in  domestic fowls, the members of the species, when free to do so, mate as  readily with types quite different from their own as with individuals  exactly like them, and produce offspring of intermediate types with all  the essential characters of the species. In domestication individuals of  distinct yet similar species are sometimes mated and produce offspring  called hybrids, but these are sterile. The mule, which is a hybrid  between the ass and the mare, is the most familiar animal of this kind.  Hybrid, or mule, cage birds are produced by crossing the canary with  several allied species. Among other domestic birds hybrids are almost  unknown.    =Origin of species.= Until near the close of the last century it was  commonly believed that each species had been created in perfect form and  that species were unchangeable; but long before that time some keen  students of the natural sciences and close observers of the changes that  take place in plants and animals in domestication had discovered that  species were not perfectly stable and were changing slowly. Geologists  established the fact that the earth, instead of being only a few  thousand years old, had existed for countless centuries. Among fossil  remains of creatures unlike any now known they had found also other  forms which appeared to be prototypes of existing species. The idea that  the forms of life now on the earth had come from earlier and somewhat  different forms had occurred to several scientists more than a hundred  years ago, but it was not until about 1860 that a satisfactory  explanation of progressive development of forms of life was given to the  world. This mode of creation is called evolution.    The theory of evolution is that partly through their own inherent  tendency to vary and partly through the influence of external things  which affect them, all organisms change slowly; that things of the same  kind, separated and living under different conditions, may in time so  change that they become separate species; and that this process may be  repeated indefinitely, the number of species constantly increasing and  becoming more diversified and more highly developed.    Such a theory would not be entitled to serious consideration unless it  was known that the earth was millions of years old, because we know that  races of fowls separated for over three thousand years (and perhaps  twice as long) and developed into quite different varieties will breed  together as readily as those of the same variety. But when it is certain  that the earth is so old that there has been ample time for changes in  living forms that would require periods of time beyond our  comprehension, some of the relations of varieties and species of birds  have an important bearing on the theory of evolution.    As in the case of fowls just noted, we find that domestic ducks of the  same species, after a separation of several thousand years, breed freely  together. But our domestic ducks are not, like the fowls, all of the  same species, and if individuals of different species are paired they  produce only a few weak hybrids. Our domestic geese are probably  descended from two wild varieties, but races that were not brought  together for thousands of years after they were domesticated are  perfectly fertile together, while when mated with the American Wild  Goose, which is not domesticated but will breed in captivity, they  produce only hybrids. The general resemblance between geese and ducks is  very striking, yet they will not breed together at all.    A comparison of these facts indicates that while three thousand, or even  five or six thousand, years of separation may not be enough to break  down the natural affinity of varieties of the same species, separation  and difference of development will eventually make of varieties distinct  species, a union of which will produce only hybrids, while a longer  separation and further increase of differences makes the break between  the species absolute and they will not breed together at all.    =Natural varieties.= A species having developed as a variety of an  earlier species will continue to develop as one variety or as several  varieties, according to conditions. If a part of a species becomes so  separated from the rest that intercourse ceases, each division of the  species may become a well-defined variety.    =Varieties in domestication.= How a species when domesticated breaks up  into varieties is well illustrated by the case of the fowl. The original  wild species has long disappeared, but there is good reason to suppose  that in size and color it was something between a Brown Pit Game and a  Brown Leghorn. The birds were smaller than most fowls seen in this  country to-day. The prevailing color was a dull brown, because that  color best conceals a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34465"],[0,"A Little Book of Christmas (#6)"],[1," end of the shop began to rattle off  melodious tunes and funny jokes, in spite of the instructions he had  received, off he pattered as fast as his little legs would carry him to  investigate. After that, forgetful of everything else, finding himself  caught in the constantly moving stream of Christmas shoppers, he was  borne along in the resistless current until he found himself at last out  upon the street--alone, free, and independent.    It was great fun, at first. By and by, however, the afternoon waned; the  sun, as if anxious to hurry along the dawn of Christmas Day, sank early  to bed; and the electric lights along the darkening highway began to pop  out here and there, like so many merry stars come down to earth to  celebrate the gladdest time of all the year. Little Billee began to grow  tired; and then he thought of his mama, and tried to find the shop where  he had promised to remain quiet until her return. Up and down the  street he wandered until his little legs grew weary; but there was no  sign of the shop, nor of the beloved face he was seeking.    Once again, and yet once again after that, did the little fellow  traverse that crowded highway, his tears getting harder and harder to  keep back, and then--joy of joys--whom should he see walking slowly  along the sidewalk but Santa Claus himself! The saint was strangely  decorated with two queer-looking boards, with big red letters on them,  hung over his back and chest; but there was still that same kindly,  gray-bearded face, the red cloak with the fur trimmings, and the same  dear old cap that the children's friend had always worn in the pictures  of him that Little Billee had seen.    [Illustration: He thought it very strange that Santa Claus's hand should  be so red and cold and rough. _Page_ 91.]    With a glad cry of happiness, Little Billee ran to meet the old fellow,  and put his hand gently into that of the saint. He thought it very  strange that Santa Claus's hand should be so red and cold and rough, and  so chapped; but he was not in any mood to be critical. He had been face  to face with a very disagreeable situation. Then, when things had seemed  blackest to him, everything had come right again; and he was too glad to  take more than passing notice of anything strange and odd.    Santa Claus, of course, would recognize him at once, and would know just  how to take him back to his mama at home--wherever that might be.  Little Billee had never thought to inquire just where home was. All he  knew was that it was a big gray stone house on a long street somewhere,  with a tall iron railing in front of it, not far from the park.    \"Howdidoo, Mr. Santa Claus?\" said Little Billee, as the other's hand  unconsciously tightened over his own.    \"Why, howdidoo, kiddie?\" replied the old fellow, glancing down at his  new-found friend, with surprise gleaming from his deep-set eyes. \"Where  did you drop from?\"    \"Oh, I'm out,\" said Little Billee bravely. \"My mama left me a little  while ago while she went off about something, and I guess I got  losted.\"    \"Very likely,\" returned the old saint with a smile. \"Little two-by-four  fellows are apt to get losted when they start in on their own hook,  specially days like these, with such crowds hustlin' around.\"    \"But it's all right now,\" suggested Little Billee hopefully. \"I'm found  again, ain't I?\"    \"Oh, yes, indeedy, you're found all right, kiddie,\" Santa Claus agreed.    \"And pretty soon you'll take me home again, won't you?\" said the child.    \"Surest thing you know!\" answered Santa Claus, looking down upon the  bright but tired little face with a comforting smile. \"What might your  address be?\"    \"My what?\" asked Little Billee.    \"Your address,\" repeated Santa Claus. \"Where do you live?\"    The answer was a ringing peal of childish laughter.    \"As if you didn't know that!\" cried Little Billee, giggling.    \"Ha, ha!\" laughed Santa Claus. \"Can't fool you, can I? It would be funny  if, after keeping an eye on you all these years since you was a babby, I  didn't know where you lived, eh?\"    \"Awful funny,\" agreed Little Billee. \"But tell me, Mr. Santa Claus, what  sort of a boy do you think I have been?\" he added with a shade of  anxiety in his voice.    \"Pretty good--pretty good,\" Santa Claus answered, turning in his steps  and walking back again along the path he had just traveled--which Little  Billee thought was rather a strange thing to do. \"You've got more white  marks than black ones--a good many more--a hundred and fifty times as  many, kiddie. Fact is, you're all right--'way up among the good boys;  though once or twice last summer, you know--\"    \"Yes, I know,\" said Little Billee meekly, \"but I didn't mean to be  naughty.\"    \"That's just what I said to the bookkeeper,\" said Santa Claus, \"and so  we gave you a gray mark--half white and half black--that doesn't count  either way, for or against you.\"    \"Thank you, sir,\" said Little Billee, much comforted.    \"Don't mention it; you are very welcome, kiddie,\" said Santa Claus,  giving the youngster's hand a gentle squeeze.    \"Why do you call me 'kiddie' when you know my name is Little Billee?\"  asked the boy.    \"Oh, that's what I call all good boys,\" explained Santa Claus. \"You see,  we divide them up into two kinds--the good boys and the naughty  boys--and the good boys we call kiddies, and the naughty boys we call  caddies, and there you are.\"    Just then Little Billee noticed for the first time the square boards  that Santa Claus was wearing.    \"What are you wearing those boards for, Mr. Santa Claus?\" he asked.    If the lad had looked closely enough, he would have seen a very unhappy  look come into the old man's face; but there was nothing of it in his  answer.    \"Oh, those are my new-fangled back-and-chest protectors, my lad,\" he  replied. \"Sometimes we have bitter winds blowing at Christmas, and I  have to be ready for them. It wouldn't do for Santa Claus to come down  with the sneezes at Christmas-time, you know--no, sirree! This board in  front keeps the wind off my chest, and the one behind keeps me from  getting rheumatism in my back. They are a great protection against the  weather.\"    \"I'll have to tell my papa about them,\" said Little Billee, much  impressed by the simplicity of this arrangement. \"We have a glass board  on the front of our ortymobile to keep the wind off Henry--he's our  shuffer--but papa wears a fur coat, and sometimes he says the wind goes  right through that. He'll be glad to know about these boards.\"    \"I shouldn't wonder,\" smiled Santa Claus. \"They aren't very becoming,  but they are mighty useful. You might save up your pennies and give your  papa a pair like 'em for his next Christmas.\"    Santa Claus laughed as he spoke; but there was a catch in his voice  which Little Billee was too young to notice.    \"You've got letters printed there,\" said the boy, peering around in  front of his companion at the lettering on the board. \"What do they  spell? You know I haven't learned to read yet.\"    \"And why should you know how to read at your age?\" said Santa Claus.  \"You're not more than--\"    \"Five last month,\" said Little Billee proudly. It was such a great age!    \"My, as old as that?\" cried Santa Claus. \"Well, you are growing fast!  Why, it don't seem more than yesterday that you was a pink-cheeked  babby, and here you are big enough to be out alone! That's more than my  little boy is able to do.\"    Santa Claus shivered slightly, and Little Billee was surprised to see a  tear glistening in his eye.    \"Why, have you got a little boy?\" he asked.    \"Yes, Little Billee,\" said the saint. \"A poor white-faced little chap,  about a year older than you, who--well, never mind, kiddie--he's a  kiddie, too--let's talk about something else, or I'll have icicles in my  eyes.\"    \"You didn't tell me what those letters on the boards spell,\" said Little  Billee.    \"'Merry Christmas to Everybody!'\" said Santa Claus. \"I have the words  printed there so that everybody can see them; and if I miss wishing  anybody a merry Christmas, he'll know I meant it just the same.\"    \"You're awful kind, aren't you?\" said Little Billee, squeezing his  friend's hand affectionately. \"It must make you very happy to be able to  be so kind to everybody!\"      II    Santa Claus made no reply to this remark, beyond giving a very deep  sigh, which Little Billee chose to believe was evidence of a great  inward content. They walked on now in silence, for Little Billee was  beginning to feel almost too tired to talk, and Santa Claus seemed to be  thinking of something else. Finally, however, the little fellow spoke.    \"I guess I'd like to go home now, Mr. Santa Claus,\" he said. \"I'm tired,  and I'm afraid my mama will be wondering where I've gone to.\"    \"That's so, my little man,\" said Santa Claus, stopping short in his walk  up and down the block. \"Your mother will be worried, for a fact; and  your father, too--I know how I'd feel if my little boy got losted and  hadn't come home at dinner-time. I don't believe you know where you  live, though--now, honest! Come! 'Fess up, Billee, you don't know where  you live, do you?\"    \"Why, yes, I do,\" said Little Billee. \"It's in the big gray stone house  with the iron fence in front of it, near the park.\"    \"Oh, that's easy enough!\" laughed Santa Claus nervously. \"Anybody could  say he lived in a gray stone house with a fence around it, near the  park; but you don't know what street it's on, nor the number, either.  I'll bet fourteen wooden giraffes against a monkey-on-a-stick!\"    \"No, I don't,\" said Little Billee frankly; \"but I know the number of our  ortymobile. It's 'N. Y.'\"    \"Fine!\" laughed Santa Claus. \"If you really were lost, it would be a  great help to know that; but not being lost, as you ain't, why, of  course, we can get along without it. It's queer you don't know your last  name, though.\"    \"I do, too, know my last name!\" blurted Little Billee. \"It's Billee.  That's"]]]
