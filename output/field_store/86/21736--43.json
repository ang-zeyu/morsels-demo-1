Why doest thou  complaine of me and of destinie? Doe we offer thee any wrong? is it  for thee to direct us, or for us to governe thee? Although thy age  be not come to her period, thy life is. A little man is a whole man  as well as a great man. Neither men nor their lives are measured by  the Ell. Chiron refused immortalitie, being informed of the  conditions thereof, even by the God of time and of continuance,  Saturne his father. Imagine truly how much an ever-during life would  be lesse tolerable and more painfull to a man, than is the life  which I have given him. Had you not death you would then uncessantly  curse, and cry out against me, that I had deprived you of it. I have  of purpose and unwittingly blended some bitternesse amongst it, that  so seeing the commoditie of its use, I might hinder you from over-  greedily embracing, or indiscreetly calling for it. To continue in  this moderation that is, neither to fly from life nor to run to  death (which I require of you) I have tempered both the one and  other betweene sweetnes and sowrenes. I first taught Thales, the  chiefest of your Sages and Wisemen, that to live and die were  indifferent, which made him answer one very wisely, who asked him  wherefore he died not: \"Because,\" said he, \"it is indifferent. The  water, the earth, the aire, the fire, and other members of this my  universe, are no more the instruments of thy life than of thy death.  Why fearest thou thy last day? He is no more guiltie, and conferreth  no more to thy death, than any of the others. It is not the last  step that causeth weariness: it only declares it. All daies march  towards death, only the last comes to it.\" Behold heere the good  precepts of our universall mother Nature. I have oftentimes  bethought my self whence it proceedeth, that in times of warre, the  visage of death (whether wee see it in us or in others) seemeth  without all comparison much lesse dreadful and terrible unto us,  than in our houses, or in our beds, otherwise it should be an armie  of Physitians and whiners, and she ever being one, there must needs  bee much more assurance amongst countrie-people and of base  condition, than in others. I verily believe, these fearefull lookes,  and astonishing countenances wherewith we encompass it, are those  that more amaze and terrifie us than death: a new forme of life; the  out cries of mothers; the wailing of women and children; the  visitation of dismaid and swouning friends; the assistance of a  number of pale-looking, distracted, and whining servants; a darke  chamber; tapers burning round about; our couch beset round with  Physitians and Preachers; and to conclude, nothing but horror and  astonishment on every side of us: are wee not already dead and  buried? The very children are afraid of their friends, when they see  them masked; and so are we. The maske must as well be taken from  things as from men, which being removed, we shall find nothing hid  under it, but the very same death, that a seely[Footnote: weak,  simple] varlet, or a simple maid-servant, did latterly suffer  without amazement or feare. Happie is that death which takes all  leasure from the preparations of such an equipage.          OF THE INSTITUTION AND EDUCATION OF CHILDREN; TO THE LADIE DIANA OF  FOIX, COUNTESSE OF GURSON    I never knew father, how crooked and deformed soever his sonne were,  that would either altogether cast him off, or not acknowledge him  for his owne: and yet (unlesse he be meerely besotted or blinded in  his affection) it may not be said, but he plainly perceiveth his  defects, and hath a feeling of his imperfections. But so it is, he  is his owne. So it is in my selfe. I see better than any man else,  that what I have set downe is nought but the fond imaginations of  him who in his youth hath tasted nothing but the paring, and seen  but the superficies of true learning: whereof he hath retained but a  generall and shapelesse forme: a smacke of every thing in generall,  but nothing to the purpose in particular: After the French manner.  To be short, I know there is an art of Phisicke; a course of lawes;  foure parts of the Mathematikes; and I am not altogether ignorant  what they tend unto. And perhaps I also know the scope and drift of  Sciences in generall to be for the service of our life. But to wade  further, or that ever I tired my selfe with plodding upon Aristotle  (the Monarch of our moderne doctrine 1) or obstinately continued in  search of any one science: I confesse I never did it. Nor is there  any one art whereof I am able so much as to draw the first  lineaments. And there is no scholler (be he of the lowest forme)  that may not repute himselfe wiser than I, who am not able to oppose  him in his first lesson: and if I be forced to it, I am constrained  verie impertinently to draw in matter from some generall discourse,  whereby I examine, and give a guesse at his naturall judgement: a  lesson as much unknowne to them as theirs is to me. I have not dealt  or had commerce with any excellent booke, except Plutarke or Seneca,  from whom (as the Danaides) I draw my water, uncessantly filling,  and as fast emptying: some thing whereof I fasten to this paper, but  to my selfe nothing at all. And touching bookes: Historie is my  chiefe studie, Poesie my only delight, to which I am particularly  affected: for as Cleanthes said, that as the voice being forciblie  pent in the narrow gullet of a trumpet, at last issueth forth more  strong and shriller, so me seemes, that a sentence cunningly and  closely couched in measure keeping Posie, darts it selfe forth more  furiously, and wounds me even to the quicke. And concerning the  naturall faculties that are in me (whereof behold here an essay), I  perceive them to faint under their owne burthen; my conceits,  [Footnote: Ideas.] and my judgement march but uncertaine, and as it  were groping, staggering, and stumbling at every rush: And when I  have gone as far as I can, I have no whit pleased my selfe: for the  further I saile the more land I descrie, and that so dimmed with  fogges, and overcast with clouds, that my sight is so weakned, I  cannot distinguish the same. And then undertaking to speake  indifferently of all that presents it selfe unto my fantasie, and  having nothing but mine owne naturall meanes to imploy therein, if  it be my hap (as commonly it is) among good Authors, to light upon  those verie places which I have undertaken to treat off, as even now  I did in Plutarke reading his discourse of the power of imagination,  wherein in regard of those wise men, I acknowledge my selfe so weake  and so poore, so dull and grose-headed, as I am forced both to  pittie and disdaine my selfe, yet am I pleased with this, that my  opinions have often the grace to jump with theirs, and that I follow  them a loofe-off, [Footnote: At a distance.] and thereby possesse at  least, that which all other men have not; which is, that I know the  utmost difference betweene them and my selfe: all which  notwithstanding, I suffer my inventions to run abroad, as weake and  faint as I have produced them, without bungling and botching the  faults which this comparison hath discovered to me in them. A man  had need have a strong backe, to undertake to march foot to foot  with these kind of men. The indiscreet writers of our age, amidst  their triviall [Footnote: Commonplace.] compositions, intermingle  and wrest in whole sentences taken from ancient Authors, supposing  by such filching-theft to purchase honour and reputation to  themselves, doe cleane contrarie. For, this infinite varietie and  dissemblance of lustres, makes a face so wan, so il-favored, and so  uglie, in respect of theirs, that they lose much more than gaine  thereby. These were two contrarie humours: The Philosopher  Chrisippus was wont to foist-in amongst his bookes, not only whole  sentences and other long-long discourses, but whole bookes of other  Authors, as in one, he brought in Euripides his Medea. And  Apollodorus was wont to say of him, that if one should draw from out  his bookes what he had stolne from others, his paper would remaine  blanke. Whereas Epicurus cleane contrarie to him in three hundred  volumes he left behind him, had not made use of one allegation.  [Footnote: Citation.] It was my fortune not long since to light upon  such a place: I had languishingly traced after some French words, so  naked and shallow, and so void either of sense or matter, that at  last I found them to be nought but meere French words; and after a  tedious and wearisome travell, I chanced to stumble upon an high,  rich, and even to the clouds-raised piece, the descent whereof had  it been somewhat more pleasant or easie, or the ascent reaching a  little further, it had been excusable, and to be borne with-all; but  it was such a steepie downe-fall, and by meere strength hewen out of  the maine rocke, that by reading of the first six words, me thought  I was carried into another world: whereby I perceive the bottome  whence I came to be so low and deep, as I durst never more adventure  to go through it; for, if I did stuffe any one of my discourses with  those rich spoiles, it would manifestly cause the sottishnesse  [Footnote: Foolishness.] of others to appeare. To reprove mine owne  faults in others, seemes to me no more unsufferable than to  reprehend (as I doe often) those of others in my selfe. They ought  to be accused every where, and have all places of Sanctuarie taken  from them: yet do I know how over boldly, at all times I adventure  to equall my selfe unto my filchings, and to march hand in hand with  them; not without a fond hardie hope, that I may perhaps be able to  bleare the eyes of the Judges from discerning them. But it is as  much for the benefit of my application, as for the good of mine  invention and force.

By devoting themselves to his service, through prayer and  supplication incessantly strengthening their faith in him, until, like  Enoch, the brother of Jared, and Moses, they obtain a manifestation of  God to themselves. [§ II. ¶ 55.]    Q. Is the knowledge of the existence of God a matter of mere  tradition, founded upon human testimony alone, until persons receive a  manifestation of God to themselves?    A. It is.    Q. How do you prove it?    A. From the whole of the first and second lectures.        LECTURE THIRD.    Of Faith.    Section III.    1. In the second lecture it was shown, how it was that the knowledge  of the existence of God, came into the world, and by what means the  first thoughts were suggested to the minds of men, that such a Being  did actually exist: and that it was by reason of the knowledge of his  existence that there was a foundation laid for the exercise of faith  in him, as the only Being in whom faith could center for life and  salvation. For faith could not center in a Being of whose existence we  have no idea; because the idea of his existence in the first instance,  is essential to the exercise of faith in him. Rom. 10:14 How then shall  they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they  believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear  without a preacher? (or one sent to tell them?) So then faith comes by  hearing the word of God. [New Translation.]    2. Let us here observe, that three things are necessary, in order that  any rational and intelligent being may exercise faith in God unto life  and salvation.    3. First, the idea that he actually exists.    4. Secondly, A _correct_ idea of his character, perfections, and  attributes.    5. Thirdly, An actual knowledge that the course of life which he is  pursuing, is according to his will.--For without an acquaintance with  these three important facts, the faith of every rational being must be  imperfect and unproductive; but with this understanding it can become  perfect and fruitful, abounding in righteousness, unto the praise and  glory of God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.    6.
