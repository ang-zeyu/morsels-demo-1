It is  surrounded by low, heavily-forested hills, which rise almost from  the seashore, and the fine mass of its old castle does not display  its dilapidation at a distance.  Moreover, the three stone forts of  Victoria, William, and Macarthy, situated on separate hills  commanding the town, add to the general appearance of permanent  substantialness so different from the usual ramshackledom of West  Coast settlements.  Even when you go ashore and have had time to  recover your senses, scattered by the surf experience, you find this  substantialness a true one, not a mere visual delusion produced by  painted wood as the seeming substantialness of Sierra Leone turns  out to be when you get to close quarters with it.  It causes one  some mental effort to grasp the fact that Cape Coast has been in  European hands for centuries, but it requires a most unmodern power  of credence to realise this of any other settlement on the whole  western seaboard until you have the pleasure of seeing the beautiful  city of San Paul de Loanda, far away down south, past the Congo.    My experience of Cape Coast on this occasion was one of the hottest,  but one of the pleasantest I have ever been through on the Gold  Coast.  The former attribute was due to the climate, the latter to  my kind friends, Mr. Batty, and Mr. and Mrs. Dennis Kemp.  I was  taken round the grand stone-built houses with their high stone-  walled yards and sculpture-decorated gateways, built by the  merchants of the last century and of the century before, and through  the great rambling stone castle with its water-tanks cut in the  solid rock beneath it, and its commodious accommodation for slaves  awaiting shipment, now almost as obsolete as the guns it mounts, but  not quite so, for these cool and roomy chambers serve to house the  native constabulary and their extensive families.    This being done, I was taken up an unmitigated hill, on whose summit  stands Fort William, a pepper-pot-like structure now used as a  lighthouse.  The view from the top was exceedingly lovely and  extensive.  Beneath, and between us and the sea, lay the town in the  blazing sun.  In among its solid stone buildings patches of native  mud-built huts huddled together as though they had been shaken down  out of a sack into the town to serve as dunnage.  Then came the  snow-white surf wall, and across it the blue sea with our steamer  rolling to and fro on the long, regular swell, impatiently waiting  until Sunday should be over and she could work cargo.  Round us on  all the other sides were wooded hills and valleys, and away in the  distance to the west showed the white town and castle of Elmina and  the nine-mile road thither, skirting the surf-bound seashore, only  broken on its level way by the mouth of the Sweet River.  Over all  was the brooding silence of the noonday heat, broken only by the  dulled thunder of the surf.    After seeing these things we started down stairs, and on reaching  ground descended yet lower into a sort of stone-walled dry moat, out  of which opened clean, cool, cellar-like chambers tunnelled into the  earth.  These, I was informed, had also been constructed to keep  slaves in when they were the staple export of the Gold Coast.  They  were so refreshingly cool that I lingered looking at them and their  massive doors, ere being marched up to ground level again, and down  the hill through some singularly awful stenches, mostly arising from  rubber, into the big Wesleyan church in the middle of the town.  It  is a building in the terrible Africo-Gothic style, but it compares  most favourably with the cathedral at Sierra Leone, particularly  internally, wherein, indeed, it far surpasses that structure.  And  then we returned to the Mission House and spent a very pleasant  evening, save for the knowledge (which amounted in me to remorse)  that, had it not been for my edification, not one of my friends  would have spent the day toiling about the town they know only too  well.  The Wesleyan Mission on the Gold Coast, of which Mr. Dennis  Kemp was at that time chairman, is the largest and most influential  Protestant mission on the West Coast of Africa, and it is now, I am  glad to say, adding a technical department to its scholastic and  religious one.  The Basel Mission has done a great deal of good work  in giving technical instruction to the natives, and practically  started this most important branch of their education.  There is  still an almost infinite amount of this work to be done, the African  being so strangely deficient in mechanical culture; infinitely more  so, indeed, in this than in any other particular.    After leaving Cape Coast our next port was Accra which is one of the  five West Coast towns that look well from the sea.  The others don't  look well from anywhere.  First in order of beauty comes San Paul de  Loanda; then Cape Coast with its satellite Elmina, then Gaboon, then  Accra with its satellite Christiansborg, and lastly, Sierra Leone.    What there is of beauty in Accra is oriental in type.  Seen from the  sea, Fort St. James on the left and Christiansborg Castle on the  right, both almost on shore level, give, with an outcrop of sandy  dwarf cliffs, a certain air of balance and strength to the town,  though but for these and the two old castles, Accra would be but a  poor place and a flimsy, for the rest of it is a mass of rubbishy  mud and palm-leaf huts, and corrugated iron dwellings for the  Europeans.    Corrugated iron is my abomination.  I quite understand it has  points, and I do not attack from an aesthetic standpoint.  It really  looks well enough when it is painted white.  There is, close to  Christiansborg Castle, a patch of bungalows and offices for  officialdom and wife that from a distance in the hard bright  sunshine looks like an encampment of snow-white tents among the coco  palms, and pretty enough withal.  I am also aware that the  corrugated-iron roof is an advantage in enabling you to collect and  store rain-water, which is the safest kind of water you can get on  the Coast, always supposing you have not painted the aforesaid roof  with red oxide an hour or two before so collecting, as a friend of  mine did once.  But the heat inside those iron houses is far greater  than inside mud-walled, brick, or wooden ones, and the alternations  of temperature more sudden:  mornings and evenings they are cold and  clammy; draughty they are always, thereby giving you chill which  means fever, and fever in West Africa means more than it does in  most places.    Going on shore at Accra with Lady MacDonald gave me opportunities  and advantages I should not otherwise have enjoyed, such as the  hospitality of the Governor, luxurious transport from the landing  place to Christiansborg Castle, a thorough inspection of the  cathedral in course of erection, and the strange and highly  interesting function of going to a tea-party at a police station to  meet a king,--a real reigning king,--who kindly attended with his  suite and displayed an intelligent interest in photographs.  Tackie  (that is His Majesty's name) is an old, spare man, with a subdued  manner.  His sovereign rights are acknowledged by the Government so  far as to hold him more or less responsible for any iniquity  committed by his people; and as the Government do not allow him to  execute or flagellate the said people, earthly pomp is rather a  hollow thing to Tackie.    On landing I was taken in charge by an Assistant Inspector of  Police, and after a scrimmage for my chief's baggage and my own,  which reminded me of a long ago landing on the distant island of  Guernsey, the inspector and I got into a 'rickshaw, locally called a  go-cart.  It was pulled in front by two government negroes and  pushed behind by another pair, all neatly attired in white jackets  and knee breeches, and crimson cummerbunds yards long, bound round  their middles.  Now it is an ingrained characteristic of the  uneducated negro, that he cannot keep on a neat and complete garment  of any kind.  It does not matter what that garment may be; so long  as it is whole, off it comes.  But as soon as that garment becomes a  series of holes, held together by filaments of rag, he keeps it upon  him in a manner that is marvellous, and you need have no further  anxiety on its behalf.  Therefore it was but natural that the  governmental cummerbunds, being new, should come off their wearers  several times in the course of our two mile trip, and as they wound  riskily round the legs of their running wearers, we had to make  halts while one end of the cummerbund was affixed to a tree-trunk  and the other end to the man, who rapidly wound himself up in it  again with a skill that spoke of constant practice.    The road to Christiansborg from Accra, which runs parallel to the  sea and is broad and well-kept, is in places pleasantly shaded with  pepper trees, eucalyptus, and palms.  The first part of it, which  forms the main street of Accra, is remarkable.  The untidy, poverty-  stricken native houses or huts are no credit to their owners, and a  constant source of anxiety to a conscientious sanitary inspector.  Almost every one of them is a shop, but this does not give rise to  the animated commercial life one might imagine, owing, I presume, to  the fact that every native inhabitant of Accra who has any money to  get rid of is able recklessly to spend it in his own emporium.  For  these shops are of the store nature, each after his kind, and seem  homogeneously stocked with tin pans, loud-patterned basins, iron  pots, a few rolls of cloth and bottles of American rum.  After  passing these there are the Haussa lines, a few European houses, and  the cathedral; and when nearly into Christiansborg, a cemetery on  either side of the road.  That to the right is the old cemetery, now  closed, and when I was there, in a disgracefully neglected state:  a  mere jungle of grass infested with snakes."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59"],[0,"Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One's Reason and of Seeking Truth (#6)"],[1,"myself worthy of the reputation accorded to me; and it is now exactly  eight years since this desire constrained me to remove from all those  places where interruption from any of my acquaintances was possible,  and betake myself to this country, in which the long duration of the  war has led to the establishment of such discipline, that the armies  maintained seem to be of use only in enabling the inhabitants to enjoy  more securely the blessings of peace and where, in the midst of a great  crowd actively engaged in business, and more careful of their own  affairs than curious about those of others, I have been enabled to live  without being deprived of any of the conveniences to be had in the most  populous cities, and yet as solitary and as retired as in the midst of  the most remote deserts.        PART IV    I am in doubt as to the propriety of making my first meditations in the  place above mentioned matter of discourse; for these are so  metaphysical, and so uncommon, as not, perhaps, to be acceptable to  every one.  And yet, that it may be determined whether the foundations  that I have laid are sufficiently secure, I find myself in a measure  constrained to advert to them.  I had long before remarked that, in  relation to practice, it is sometimes necessary to adopt, as if above  doubt, opinions which we discern to be highly uncertain, as has been  already said; but as I then desired to give my attention solely to the  search after truth, I thought that a procedure exactly the opposite was  called for, and that I ought to reject as absolutely false all opinions  in regard to which I could suppose the least ground for doubt, in order  to ascertain whether after that there remained aught in my belief that  was wholly indubitable.  Accordingly, seeing that our senses sometimes  deceive us, I was willing to suppose that there existed nothing really  such as they presented to us; and because some men err in reasoning,  and fall into paralogisms, even on the simplest matters of geometry, I,  convinced that I was as open to error as any other, rejected as false  all the reasonings I had hitherto taken for demonstrations; and  finally, when I considered that the very same thoughts (presentations)  which we experience when awake may also be experienced when we are  asleep, while there is at that time not one of them true, I supposed  that all the objects (presentations) that had ever entered into my mind  when awake, had in them no more truth than the illusions of my dreams.  But immediately upon this I observed that, whilst I thus wished to  think that all was false, it was absolutely necessary that I, who thus  thought, should be somewhat; and as I observed that this truth, I  think, therefore I am (COGITO ERGO SUM), was so certain and of such  evidence that no ground of doubt, however extravagant, could be alleged  by the sceptics capable of shaking it, I concluded that I might,  without scruple, accept it as the first principle of the philosophy of  which I was in search.    In the next place, I attentively examined what I was and as I observed  that I could suppose that I had no body, and that there was no world  nor any place in which I might be; but that I could not therefore  suppose that I was not; and that, on the contrary, from the very  circumstance that I thought to doubt of the truth of other things, it  most clearly and certainly followed that I was; while, on the other  hand, if I had only ceased to think, although all the other objects  which I had ever imagined had been in reality existent, I would have  had no reason to believe that I existed; I thence concluded that I was  a substance whose whole essence or nature consists only in thinking,  and which, that it may exist, has need of no place, nor is dependent on  any material thing; so that \"I,\" that is to say, the mind by which I am  what I am, is wholly distinct from the body, and is  even more easily  known than the latter, and is such, that although the latter were not,  it would still continue to be all that it is.    After this I inquired in general into what is essential to the truth  and certainty of a proposition; for since I had discovered one which I  knew to be true, I thought that I must likewise be able to discover the  ground of this certitude.  And as I observed that in the words I think,  therefore I am, there is nothing at all which gives me assurance of  their truth beyond this, that I see very clearly that in order to think  it is necessary to exist, I concluded that I might take, as a general  rule, the principle, that all the things which we very clearly and  distinctly conceive are true, only observing, however, that there is  some difficulty in rightly determining the objects which we distinctly  conceive.    In the next place, from reflecting on the circumstance that I doubted,  and that consequently my being was not wholly perfect (for I clearly  saw that it was a greater perfection to know than to doubt), I was led  to inquire whence I had learned to think of something more perfect than  myself; and I clearly recognized that I must hold this notion from some  nature which in reality was more perfect.  As for the thoughts of many  other objects external to me, as of the sky, the earth, light, heat,  and a thousand more, I was less at a loss to know whence these came;  for since I remarked in them nothing which seemed to render them  superior to myself, I could believe that, if these were true, they were  dependencies on my own nature, in so far as it possessed a certain  perfection, and, if they were false, that I held them from nothing,  that is to say, that they were in me because of a certain imperfection  of my nature.  But this could not be the case with-the idea of a nature  more perfect than myself; for to receive it from nothing was a thing  manifestly impossible; and, because it is not less repugnant that the  more perfect should be an effect of, and dependence on the less  perfect, than that something should proceed from nothing, it was  equally impossible that I could hold it from myself: accordingly, it  but remained that it had been placed in me by a nature which was in  reality more perfect than mine, and which even possessed within itself  all the perfections of which I could form any idea; that is to say, in  a single word, which was God.  And to this I added that, since I knew  some perfections which I did not possess, I was not the only being in  existence (I will here, with your permission, freely use the terms of  the schools); but, on the contrary, that there was of necessity some  other more perfect Being upon whom I was dependent, and from whom I had  received all that I possessed; for if I had existed alone, and  independently of every other being, so as to have had from myself all  the perfection, however little, which I actually possessed, I should  have been able, for the same reason, to have had from myself the whole  remainder of perfection, of the want of which I was conscious, and thus  could of myself have become infinite, eternal, immutable, omniscient,  all-powerful, and, in fine, have possessed all the perfections which I  could recognize in God.  For in order to know the nature of God (whose  existence has been established by the preceding reasonings), as far as  my own nature permitted, I had only to consider in reference to all the  properties of which I found in my  mind some idea, whether their  possession was a mark of perfection; and I was assured that no one  which indicated any imperfection was in him, and that none of the rest  was awanting.  Thus I perceived that doubt, inconstancy,  sadness, and  such like, could not be found in God, since I myself would have been  happy to be free from them.  Besides, I had ideas of many sensible and  corporeal things; for although I might suppose that I was dreaming, and  that all which I saw or imagined was false, I could not, nevertheless,  deny that the ideas were in reality in my thoughts.  But, because I had  already very clearly recognized in myself that the intelligent nature  is distinct from the corporeal, and as I observed that all composition  is an evidence of dependency, and that a state of dependency is  manifestly a state of imperfection, I therefore determined that it  could not be a perfection in God to be compounded of these two natures  and that consequently he was not so compounded; but that if there were  any bodies in the world, or even any intelligences, or other natures  that were not wholly perfect, their existence depended on his power in  such a way that they could not subsist without him for a single moment.    I was disposed straightway to search for other truths and when I had  represented to myself the object of the geometers, which I conceived to  be a continuous body or a space indefinitely extended in length,  breadth, and height or depth, divisible into divers parts which admit  of different figures and sizes, and of being moved or transposed in all  manner of ways (for all this the geometers suppose to be in the object  they contemplate), I went over some of their simplest demonstrations.  And, in the first place, I observed, that the great certitude which by  common consent is accorded to these demonstrations, is founded solely  upon this, that they are clearly conceived in accordance with the rules  I have already laid down In the next place, I perceived that there was  nothing at all in these demonstrations which could assure me of the  existence of their object: thus, for example, supposing a triangle to  be given, I distinctly perceived that its three angles were necessarily  equal to two right angles, but I did not on that account perceive  anything which could assure me that any triangle existed:  while, on  the contrary, recurring to the examination of the idea of a Perfect  Being, I found that the existence of the Being was comprised in the  idea in the same way that the equality of"]]]
