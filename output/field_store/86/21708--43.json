[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/512"],[0,"Mosses from an Old Manse, and Other Stories (#6)"],[1,", until suddenly, in a gloomy hollow of the road, Goodman  Brown sat himself down on the stump of a tree and refused to go any  farther.    \"Friend,\" said he, stubbornly, \"my mind is made up. Not another step  will I budge on this errand. What if a wretched old woman do choose to  go to the devil when I thought she was going to heaven: is that any  reason why I should quit my dear Faith and go after her?\"    \"You will think better of this by and by,\" said his acquaintance,  composedly. \"Sit here and rest yourself a while; and when you feel like  moving again, there is my staff to help you along.\"    Without more words, he threw his companion the maple stick, and was as  speedily out of sight as if he had vanished into the deepening gloom.  The young man sat a few moments by the roadside, applauding himself  greatly, and thinking with how clear a conscience he should meet the  minister in his morning walk, nor shrink from the eye of good old  Deacon Gookin. And what calm sleep would be his that very night, which  was to have been spent so wickedly, but so purely and sweetly now, in  the arms of Faith! Amidst these pleasant and praiseworthy meditations,  Goodman Brown heard the tramp of horses along the road, and deemed it  advisable to conceal himself within the verge of the forest, conscious  of the guilty purpose that had brought him thither, though now so  happily turned from it.    On came the hoof tramps and the voices of the riders, two grave old  voices, conversing soberly as they drew near. These mingled sounds  appeared to pass along the road, within a few yards of the young man's  hiding-place; but, owing doubtless to the depth of the gloom at that  particular spot, neither the travellers nor their steeds were visible.  Though their figures brushed the small boughs by the wayside, it could  not be seen that they intercepted, even for a moment, the faint gleam  from the strip of bright sky athwart which they must have passed.  Goodman Brown alternately crouched and stood on tiptoe, pulling aside  the branches and thrusting forth his head as far as he durst without  discerning so much as a shadow. It vexed him the more, because he could  have sworn, were such a thing possible, that he recognized the voices  of the minister and Deacon Gookin, jogging along quietly, as they were  wont to do, when bound to some ordination or ecclesiastical council.  While yet within hearing, one of the riders stopped to pluck a switch.    \"Of the two, reverend sir,\" said the voice like the deacon's, \"I had  rather miss an ordination dinner than to-night's meeting. They tell me  that some of our community are to be here from Falmouth and beyond, and  others from Connecticut and Rhode Island, besides several of the Indian  powwows, who, after their fashion, know almost as much deviltry as the  best of us. Moreover, there is a goodly young woman to be taken into  communion.\"    \"Mighty well, Deacon Gookin!\" replied the solemn old tones of the  minister. \"Spur up, or we shall be late. Nothing can be done, you know,  until I get on the ground.\"    The hoofs clattered again; and the voices, talking so strangely in the  empty air, passed on through the forest, where no church had ever been  gathered or solitary Christian prayed. Whither, then, could these holy  men be journeying so deep into the heathen wilderness? Young Goodman  Brown caught hold of a tree for support, being ready to sink down on  the ground, faint and overburdened with the heavy sickness of his  heart. He looked up to the sky, doubting whether there really was a  heaven above him. Yet there was the blue arch, and the stars  brightening in it.    \"With heaven above and Faith below, I will yet stand firm against the  devil!\" cried Goodman Brown.    While he still gazed upward into the deep arch of the firmament and had  lifted his hands to pray, a cloud, though no wind was stirring, hurried  across the zenith and hid the brightening stars. The blue sky was still  visible, except directly overhead, where this black mass of cloud was  sweeping swiftly northward. Aloft in the air, as if from the depths of  the cloud, came a confused and doubtful sound of voices. Once the  listener fancied that he could distinguish the accents of towns-people  of his own, men and women, both pious and ungodly, many of whom he had  met at the communion table, and had seen others rioting at the tavern.  The next moment, so indistinct were the sounds, he doubted whether he  had heard aught but the murmur of the old forest, whispering without a  wind. Then came a stronger swell of those familiar tones, heard daily  in the sunshine at Salem village, but never until now from a cloud of  night There was one voice of a young woman, uttering lamentations, yet  with an uncertain sorrow, and entreating for some favor, which,  perhaps, it would grieve her to obtain; and all the unseen multitude,  both saints and sinners, seemed to encourage her onward.    \"Faith!\" shouted Goodman Brown, in a voice of agony and desperation;  and the echoes of the forest mocked him, crying, \"Faith! Faith!\" as if  bewildered wretches were seeking her all through the wilderness.    The cry of grief, rage, and terror was yet piercing the night, when the  unhappy husband held his breath for a response. There was a scream,  drowned immediately in a louder murmur of voices, fading into far-off  laughter, as the dark cloud swept away, leaving the clear and silent  sky above Goodman Brown. But something fluttered lightly down through  the air and caught on the branch of a tree. The young man seized it,  and beheld a pink ribbon.    \"My Faith is gone!\" cried he, after one stupefied moment. \"There is no  good on earth; and sin is but a name. Come, devil; for to thee is this  world given.\"    And, maddened with despair, so that he laughed loud and long, did  Goodman Brown grasp his staff and set forth again, at such a rate that  he seemed to fly along the forest path rather than to walk or run. The  road grew wilder and drearier and more faintly traced, and vanished at  length, leaving him in the heart of the dark wilderness, still rushing  onward with the instinct that guides mortal man to evil. The whole  forest was peopled with frightful sounds--the creaking of the trees,  the howling of wild beasts, and the yell of Indians; while sometimes  the wind tolled like a distant church bell, and sometimes gave a broad  roar around the traveller, as if all Nature were laughing him to scorn.  But he was himself the chief horror of the scene, and shrank not from  its other horrors.    \"Ha! ha! ha!\" roared Goodman Brown when the wind laughed at him.    \"Let us hear which will laugh loudest. Think not to frighten me with  your deviltry. Come witch, come wizard, come Indian powwow, come devil  himself, and here comes Goodman Brown. You may as well fear him as he  fear you.\"    In truth, all through the haunted forest there could be nothing more  frightful than the figure of Goodman Brown. On he flew among the black  pines, brandishing his staff with frenzied gestures, now giving vent to  an inspiration of horrid blasphemy, and now shouting forth such  laughter as set all the echoes of the forest laughing like demons  around him. The fiend in his own shape is less hideous than when he  rages in the breast of man. Thus sped the demoniac on his course,  until, quivering among the trees, he saw a red light before him, as  when the felled trunks and branches of a clearing have been set on  fire, and throw up their lurid blaze against the sky, at the hour of  midnight. He paused, in a lull of the tempest that had driven him  onward, and heard the swell of what seemed a hymn, rolling solemnly  from a distance with the weight of many voices. He knew the tune; it  was a familiar one in the choir of the village meeting-house. The verse  died heavily away, and was lengthened by a chorus, not of human voices,  but of all the sounds of the benighted wilderness pealing in awful  harmony together. Goodman Brown cried out, and his cry was lost to his  own ear by its unison with the cry of the desert.    In the interval of silence he stole forward until the light glared full  upon his eyes. At one extremity of an open space, hemmed in by the dark  wall of the forest, arose a rock, bearing some rude, natural  resemblance either to an altar or a pulpit, and surrounded by four  blazing pines, their tops aflame, their stems untouched, like candles  at an evening meeting. The mass of foliage that had overgrown the  summit of the rock was all on fire, blazing high into the night and  fitfully illuminating the whole field. Each pendent twig and leafy  festoon was in a blaze. As the red light arose and fell, a numerous  congregation alternately shone forth, then disappeared in shadow, and  again grew, as it were, out of the darkness, peopling the heart of the  solitary woods at once.    \"A grave and dark-clad company,\" quoth Goodman Brown.    In truth they were such. Among them, quivering to and fro between gloom  and splendor, appeared faces that would be seen next day at the council  board of the province, and others which, Sabbath after Sabbath, looked  devoutly heavenward, and benignantly over the crowded pews, from the  holiest pulpits in the land. Some affirm that the lady of the governor  was there. At least there were high dames well known to her, and wives  of honored husbands, and widows, a great multitude, and ancient  maidens, all of excellent repute, and fair young girls, who trembled  lest their mothers should espy them. Either the sudden gleams of light  flashing over the obscure field bedazzled Goodman Brown, or he  recognized a score of the church members of Salem village famous for  their especial sanctity. Good old Deacon Gookin had arrived, and waited  at the skirts of that venerable saint, his revered pastor. But,  irreverently consorting with these grave, reputable, and pious people,  these elders of the church, these chaste dames and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51233"],[0,"The Marching Morons (#6)"],[1," to translate it to \"Let the buyer beware.\"  He didn't, he stated, give a damn about either the morons or their  intelligent slaves; he'd told them his price and that was all he was  interested in.    Would they meet it or wouldn't they?    The Polar President offered to resign in his favor, with certain  temporary emergency powers that the Polar Congress would vote him if  he thought them necessary. Barlow demanded the title of World Dictator,  complete control of world finances, salary to be decided by himself,  and the publicity campaign and historical writeup to begin at once.    \"As for the emergency powers,\" he added, \"they are neither to be  temporary nor limited.\"    Somebody wanted the floor to discuss the matter, with the declared hope  that perhaps Barlow would modify his demands.    \"You've got the proposition,\" Barlow said. \"I'm not knocking off even  ten per cent.\"    \"But what if the Congress refuses, sir?\" the President asked.    \"Then you can stay up here at the Pole and try to work it out  yourselves. I'll get what I want from the morons. A shrewd operator  like me doesn't have to compromise; I haven't got a single competitor  in this whole cockeyed moronic era.\"    Congress waived debate and voted by show of hands. Barlow won  unanimously.    \"You don't know how close you came to losing me,\" he said in his first  official address to the joint Houses. \"I'm not the boy to haggle;  either I get what I ask or I go elsewhere. The first thing I want is  to see designs for a new palace for me--nothing _un_ostentatious,  either--and your best painters and sculptors to start working on my  portraits and statues. Meanwhile, I'll get my staff together.\"    He dismissed the Polar President and the Polar Congress, telling them  that he'd let them know when the next meeting would be.    A week later, the program started with North America the first target.    Mrs. Garvy was resting after dinner before the ordeal of turning on  the dishwasher. The TV, of course, was on and it said: \"Oooh!\"--long,  shuddery and ecstatic, the cue for the _Parfum Assault Criminale_ spot  commercial. \"Girls,\" said the announcer hoarsely, \"do you want your  man? It's easy to get him--easy as a trip to Venus.\"    \"Huh?\" said Mrs. Garvy.    \"Wassamatter?\" snorted her husband, starting out of a doze.    \"Ja hear that?\"    \"Wha'?\"    \"He said 'easy like a trip to Venus.'\"    \"So?\"    \"Well, I thought ya couldn't get to Venus. I thought they just had that  one rocket thing that crashed on the Moon.\"    \"Aah, women don't keep up with the news,\" said Garvy righteously,  subsiding again.    \"Oh,\" said his wife uncertainly.    And the next day, on _Henry's Other Mistress_, there was a new  character who had just breezed in: Buzz Rentshaw, Master Rocket Pilot  of the Venus run. On _Henry's Other Mistress_, \"the broadcast drama  about you and your neighbors, _folksy_ people, _ordinary_ people,  _real_ people\"! Mrs. Garvy listened with amazement over a cooling cup  of coffee as Buzz made hay of her hazy convictions.    MONA: Darling, it's so good to see you again!    BUZZ: You don't know how I've missed you on that dreary Venus run.    SOUND: _Venetian blind run down, key turned in door lock._    MONA: Was it _very_ dull, dearest?    BUZZ: Let's not talk about my humdrum job, darling. Let's talk about us.    SOUND: _Creaking bed._    Well, the program was back to normal at last. That evening Mrs. Garvy  tried to ask again whether her husband was sure about those rockets,  but he was dozing right through _Take It and Stick It_, so she watched  the screen and forgot the puzzle.    She was still rocking with laughter at the gag line, \"Would you buy it  for a quarter?\" when the commercial went on for the detergent powder  she always faithfully loaded her dishwasher with on the first of every  month.           *       *       *       *       *    The announcer displayed mountains of suds from a tiny piece of the  stuff and coyly added: \"Of course, Cleano don't lay around for you to  pick up like the soap root on Venus, but it's pretty cheap and it's  almost pretty near just as good. So for us plain folks who ain't lucky  enough to live up there on Venus, Cleano is the real cleaning stuff!\"    Then the chorus went into their \"Cleano-is-the-stuff\" jingle, but Mrs.  Garvy didn't hear it. She was a stubborn woman, but it occurred to her  that she was very sick indeed. She didn't want to worry her husband.  The next day she quietly made an appointment with her family freud.    In the waiting room she picked up a fresh new copy of _Readers Pablum_  and put it down with a faint palpitation. The lead article, according  to the table of contents on the cover, was titled \"The Most Memorable  Venusian I Ever Met.\"    \"The freud will see you now,\" said the nurse, and Mrs. Garvy tottered  into his office.    His traditional glasses and whiskers were reassuring. She choked out  the ritual: \"Freud, forgive me, for I have neuroses.\"    He chanted the antiphonal: \"Tut, my dear girl, what seems to be the  trouble?\"    \"I got like a hole in the head,\" she quavered. \"I seem to forget all  kinds of things. Things like everybody seems to know and I don't.\"    \"Well, that happens to everybody occasionally, my dear. I suggest a  vacation on Venus.\"    The freud stared, open-mouthed, at the empty chair. His nurse came in  and demanded, \"Hey, you see how she scrammed? What was the matter with  _her_?\"    He took off his glasses and whiskers meditatively. \"You can search  me. I told her she should maybe try a vacation on Venus.\" A momentary  bafflement came into his face and he dug through his desk drawers  until he found a copy of the four-color, profusely illustrated journal  of his profession. It had come that morning and he had lip-read it,  though looking mostly at the pictures. He leafed through to the article  _Advantages of the Planet Venus in Rest Cures_.    \"It's right there,\" he said.    The nurse looked. \"It sure is,\" she agreed. \"Why shouldn't it be?\"    \"The trouble with these here neurotics,\" decided the freud, \"is that  they all the time got to fight reality. Show in the next twitch.\"    He put on his glasses and whiskers again and forgot Mrs. Garvy and her  strange behavior.    \"Freud, forgive me, for I have neuroses.\"    \"Tut, my dear girl, what seems to be the trouble?\"           *       *       *       *       *    Like many cures of mental disorders, Mrs. Garvy's was achieved largely  by self-treatment. She disciplined herself sternly out of the crazy  notion that there had been only one rocket ship and that one a failure.  She could join without wincing, eventually, in any conversation on the  desirability of Venus as a place to retire, on its fabulous floral  profusion. Finally she went to Venus.    All her friends were trying to book passage with the Evening Star  Travel and Real Estate Corporation, but naturally the demand was  crushing. She considered herself lucky to get a seat at last for the  two-week summer cruise. The space ship took off from a place called  Los Alamos, New Mexico. It looked just like all the spaceships on  television and in the picture magazines, but was more comfortable than  you would expect.    Mrs. Garvy was delighted with the fifty or so fellow-passengers  assembled before takeoff. They were from all over the country and  she had a distinct impression that they were on the brainy side. The  captain, a tall, hawk-faced, impressive fellow named Ryan-Something  or other, welcomed them aboard and trusted that their trip would be a  memorable one. He regretted that there would be nothing to see because,  \"due to the meteorite season,\" the ports would be dogged down. It was  disappointing, yet reassuring that the line was taking no chances.    There was the expected momentary discomfort at takeoff and then two  monotonous days of droning travel through space to be whiled away in  the lounge at cards or craps. The landing was a routine bump and the  voyagers were issued tablets to swallow to immunize them against any  minor ailments. When the tablets took effect, the lock was opened and  Venus was theirs.    It looked much like a tropical island on Earth, except for a blanket  of cloud overhead. But it had a heady, other-worldly quality that was  intoxicating and glamorous.    The ten days of the vacation were suffused with a hazy magic. The soap  root, as advertised, was free and sudsy. The fruits, mostly tropical  varieties transplanted from Earth, were delightful. The simple shelters  provided by the travel company were more than adequate for the balmy  days and nights.    It was with sincere regret that the voyagers filed again into the ship,  and swallowed more tablets doled out to counteract and sterilize any  Venus illnesses they might unwittingly communicate to Earth.           *       *       *       *       *    Vacationing was one thing. Power politics was another.    At the Pole, a small man was in a soundproof room, his face deathly  pale and his body limp in a straight chair.    In the American Senate Chamber, Senator Hull-Mendoza (Synd., N. Cal.)  was saying: \"Mr. President and gentlemen, I would be remiss in my duty  as a legislature if'n I didn't bring to the attention of the au-gust  body I see here a perilous situation which is fraught with peril.  As is well known to members of this au-gust body, the perfection of  space flight has brought with it a situation I can only describe  as fraught with peril. Mr. President and gentlemen, now that swift  American rockets now traverse the trackless void of space between this  planet and our nearest planetarial neighbor in space--and, gentlemen, I  refer to Venus, the star of dawn, the brightest jewel in fair Vulcan's  diadome--now, I say, I want to inquire what steps are being taken  to colonize Venus with a vanguard of patriotic citizens like those  minutemen of yore.    \"Mr. President and gentlemen! There are in this world nations, envious  nations--I do not"]]]
