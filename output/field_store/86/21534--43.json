In regard to the antinomy,  pointed out by him, of liberty and government,--whether the latter be  monarchic, aristocratic, or democratic in form,--Proudhon, whose chief  desire was to preserve liberty, naturally sought the solution in the  free contract. But though the free contract may be a practical solution  of purely economical questions, it cannot be made use of in politics.  Proudhon recognized this ten years later, when his beautiful study on  \"War and Peace\" led him to find in the FEDERATIVE PRINCIPLE the exact  equilibrium of liberty and government.    \"The Social Revolution Demonstrated by the Coup d' Etat\" appeared in  1852, a few months after his release from prison. At that time, terror  prevailed to such an extent that no one was willing to publish his  book without express permission from the government. He succeeded in  obtaining this permission by writing to Louis Bonaparte a letter which  he published at the same time with the work. The latter being offered  for sale, Proudhon was warned that he would not be allowed to publish  any more books of the same character. At that time he entertained the  idea of writing a universal history entitled \"Chronos.\" This project was  never fulfilled.    Already the father of two children, and about to be presented with a  third, Proudhon was obliged to devise some immediate means of gaining a  living; he resumed his labors, and published, at first anonymously, the  \"Manual of a Speculator in the Stock-Exchange.\" Later, in 1857, after  having completed the work, he did not hesitate to sign it, acknowledging  in the preface his indebtedness to his collaborator, G. Duchene.    Meantime, he vainly sought permission to establish a journal, or review.  This permission was steadily refused him. The imperial government  always suspected him after the publication of the \"Social Revolution  Demonstrated by the Coup d'Etat.\"    Towards the end of 1853, Proudhon issued in Belgium a pamphlet entitled  \"The Philosophy of Progress.\" Entirely inoffensive as it was, this  pamphlet, which he endeavored to send into France, was seized on the  frontier. Proudhon's complaints were of no avail.    The empire gave grants after grants to large companies. A financial  society, having asked for the grant of a railroad in the east of France,  employed Proudhon to write several memoirs in support of this demand.  The grant was given to another company. The author was offered an  indemnity as compensation, to be paid (as was customary in such cases)  by the company which received the grant. It is needless to say that  Proudhon would accept nothing. Then, wishing to explain to the public,  as well as to the government, the end which he had in view, he  published the work entitled \"Reforms to be Effected in the Management of  Railroads.\"    Towards the end of 1854, Proudhon had already begun his book on  \"Justice,\" when he had a violent attack of cholera, from which he  recovered with great difficulty. Ever afterwards his health was  delicate.    At last, on the 22d of April, 1858, he published, in three large  volumes, the important work upon which he had labored since 1854. This  work had two titles: the first, \"Justice in the Revolution and in the  Church;\" the second, \"New Principles of Practical Philosophy, addressed  to His Highness Monseigneur Mathieu, Cardinal-Archbishop of Besancon.\"  On the 27th of April, when there had scarcely been time to read the  work, an order was issued by the magistrate for its seizure; on the  28th the seizure was effected. To this first act of the magistracy,  the author of the incriminated book replied on the 11th of May in a  strongly-motived petition, demanding a revision of the concordat of  1802; or, in other words, a new adjustment of the relations between  Church and State. At bottom, this petition was but the logical  consequence of the work itself. An edition of a thousand copies being  published on the 17th of May, the \"Petition to the Senate\" was regarded  by the public prosecutor as an aggravation of the offence or offences  discovered in the body of the work to which it was an appendix, and was  seized in its turn on the 23d. On the first of June, the author appealed  to the Senate in a second \"Petition,\" which was deposited with the  first in the office of the Secretary of the Assembly, the guardian and  guarantee, according to the constitution of 1852, of the principles  of '89. On the 2d of June, the two processes being united, Proudhon  appeared at the bar with his publisher, the printer of the book, and  the printer of the petition, to receive the sentence of the police  magistrate, which condemned him to three years' imprisonment, a fine of  four thousand francs, and the suppression of his work. It is needless  to say that the publisher and printers were also condemned by the sixth  chamber.    Proudhon lodged an appeal; he wrote a memoir which the law of 1819, in  the absence of which he would have been liable to a new prosecution,  gave him the power to publish previous to the hearing. Having decided  to make use of the means which the law permitted, he urged in vain the  printers who were prosecuted with him to lend him their aid. He then  demanded of Attorney-General Chaix d'Est Ange a statement to the effect  that the twenty-third article of the law of the 17th of May, 1819,  allows a written defence, and that a printer runs no risk in printing  it. The attorney-general flatly refused. Proudhon then started for  Belgium, where he printed his defence, which could not, of course, cross  the French frontier. This memoir is entitled to rank with the best of  Beaumarchais's; it is entitled: \"Justice prosecuted by the Church;  An Appeal from the Sentence passed upon P. J. Proudhon by the Police  Magistrate of the Seine, on the 2d of June, 1858.\" A very close  discussion of the grounds of the judgment of the sixth chamber, it was  at the same time an excellent resume of his great work.    Once in Belgium, Proudhon did not fail to remain there. In 1859, after  the general amnesty which followed the Italian war, he at first thought  himself included in it. But the imperial government, consulted by his  friends, notified him that, in its opinion, and in spite of the contrary  advice of M. Faustin Helie, his condemnation was not of a political  character. Proudhon, thus classed by the government with the authors  of immoral works, thought it beneath his dignity to protest, and waited  patiently for the advent of 1863 to allow him to return to France.    In Belgium, where he was not slow in forming new friendships, he  published in 1859-60, in separate parts, a new edition of his great work  on \"Justice.\" Each number contained, in addition to the original text  carefully reviewed and corrected, numerous explanatory notes and some  \"Tidings of the Revolution.\" In these tidings, which form a sort of  review of the progress of ideas in Europe, Proudhon sorrowfully  asserts that, after having for a long time marched at the head of the  progressive nations, France has become, without appearing to suspect it,  the most retrogressive of nations; and he considers her more than once  as seriously threatened with moral death.    The Italian war led him to write a new work, which he published in 1861,  entitled \"War and Peace.\" This work, in which, running counter to  a multitude of ideas accepted until then without examination, he  pronounced for the first time against the restoration of an aristocratic  and priestly Poland, and against the establishment of a unitary  government in Italy, created for him a multitude of enemies. Most of  his friends, disconcerted by his categorical affirmation of a right  of force, notified him that they decidedly disapproved of his new  publication. \"You see,\" triumphantly cried those whom he had always  combated, \"this man is only a sophist.\"    Led by his previous studies to test every thing by the question of  right, Proudhon asks, in his \"War and Peace,\" whether there is a real  right of which war is the vindication, and victory the demonstration.  This right, which he roughly calls the right of the strongest or the  right of force, and which is, after all, only the right of the most  worthy to the preference in certain definite cases, exists, says  Proudhon, independently of war. It cannot be legitimately vindicated  except where necessity clearly demands the subordination of one will to  another, and within the limits in which it exists; that is, without ever  involving the enslavement of one by the other. Among nations, the right  of the majority, which is only a corollary of the right of force, is  as unacceptable as universal monarchy. Hence, until equilibrium is  established and recognized between States or national forces, there must  be war. War, says Proudhon, is not always necessary to determine which  side is the strongest; and he has no trouble in proving this by examples  drawn from the family, the workshop, and elsewhere. Passing then to the  study of war, he proves that it by no means corresponds in practice to  that which it ought to be according to his theory of the right of force.  The systematic horrors of war naturally lead him to seek a cause for  it other than the vindication of this right; and then only does the  economist take it upon himself to denounce this cause to those who, like  himself, want peace. The necessity of finding abroad a compensation  for the misery resulting in every nation from the absence of economical  equilibrium, is, according to Proudhon, the ever real, though ever  concealed, cause of war. The pages devoted to this demonstration and to  his theory of poverty, which he clearly distinguishes from misery and  pauperism, shed entirely new light upon the philosophy of history. As  for the author's conclusion, it is a very simple one.

Prine, Mobile, Alabama_    _NELSON BIRDSONG REMEMBERS HIS MASTER_    Nelson Birdsong, who lives on Front Street in the old suburb of  Summerville, about three miles from Mobile, Alabama, was born a slave. A  tall dark Negro man, with white hair and whiskers, he says he was born  at Montgomery Hill, Alabama in Baldwin County, and that his people and  he were owned by Mr. Tom Adkins.    Nelson said he was very small at the time of the Surrender, and could  not tell very much about slavery days. In fact, he adds, \"You know,  missie, old folks in dem days did'nt 'low chillun to stan' 'roun' when  dey was talking. We chillun was lack a shot out of a gun when anybody  come in. We was glad when folks come in 'cause we c'ud run out an' play.  Chillun now-a-days knows as much as we did when we was twenty-five years  old.\"    Nelson does remember his \"massa\" saying he neber was going to 'let dat  little nigger work.'    He did not remember much about coming to Mobile, but \"seemed lack\" his  \"mammy worked for Mrs. Dunn on Monroe street, and later dey moved out in  old Napoleonville\" (which is now Crichton, Alabama, a suburb of Mobile).  He said his \"Pa and Mammy den worked fo' gris' mill out dere, and also  owned a big gris' mill in de fork whar de big fire station is now\"  (which is located at the intersection of St. Francis street and  Washington Avenue, the latter formerly Wilkinson street). This grist  mill was burned in the 1870's.    Nelson says the first work he remembered doing was \"nussing a baby boy  of Mr. Bramwell Burden, a gran'son of old man Burden.\"    Nelson has owned his little farm and three-room house until the past two  or three years. He said he scuffled and tried to pay de taxes, but had  got so old and his \"knees had give out on him, and I seed I was agoin'  to lose mah place so I turned it over to a man to keep up mah taxes, so  I'd have a place to lib. De relief gibes me a little he'p now, an' me  an' my wife makes out de bes' we can.\"    The house is the familiar type of two-room Negro house, with a porch  across the front, and a shed room on the back. The bedroom had been  papered with scraps of wallpaper of varied designs and so old that most  of it had fallen off. The mantel is covered with the colored comics  section, cut in a fancy pattern of scallops. At the entrance of the  house is a sack nailed to the floor and used for a foot mat, and at the  two upper corners of the door are horse shoes for good luck. Nelson said  he is a member of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, and has  been a Methodist all his life; that he and his wife Virginia \"had only  two chillun' and dey were bofe dead.\"    Nelson's wife, Virginia, came from a family of slaves, although she was  not one herself. She said her folks were owned by Mr. Joe Pickett of  Camden, Wilcox County, Alabama. She said she just can remember Mr. Joe  taking her in his buggy, and she called him \"Toe-Toe,\" as she couldn't  say his name plainly. She also said as she grew older she always spoke  of Mr. Joe, as \"my Papa,\" instead of \"my master,\" for \"he sho' was good  to me.\" She remembers her mother being chambermaid on the \"Old  Eleanora,\" a boat on the Alabama river, and as a small child going back  and forth on the boat with her. When they finally settled in Mobile, her  mother worked for the family of Dr. Heustis who lived in the corner  house now occupied by the new Federal Court House and Custom House, at  St. Louis and St. Joseph streets.

GABR'EL BLOW LOUD!_    When \"Gabr'el take his silver trump,\" he is going to blow soft for the  saved and loud for the lost souls, according to Ank Bishop who was born  into slavery eighty-nine years ago, and lives in Livingston, Alabama.  The days before the war were as good as the present, Ank believes. He  tells of them in the following story of his life:    \"My name is Ank Bishop, en I was born in 1849, August 16th, at Ward,  Alabama. My mother's name was Amy Larken, an' my father was Tom Bishop.  I had three brothers, Alf, Volen an' Jim, an' two sisters, Cely an'  Matildy. Us belonged to Lady Liza Larkin at Ward, right nigh Coke's  Chapel.    \"My mother was brought out from South Car'lina in a speculator drove,  an' Lady Liza bought her at de auction at Coke's Chapel. She lef' her  mammy an' daddy back dere in South Car'lina an' never did see 'em no  more in dis life. She was bidded off an' Lady Liza got her, jes' her one  from all her family. She was got fer Lady Liza's house gal. But  sometimes she cooked or was de washer, den ag'in de milker. 'Twas my job  for to min' de ca'ves. Sometimes I went to Mr. Ed Western's sto' at  Gaston, three miles from us house, to see iffen was any mail for Lady  Liza, but 'twa'n't none.    \"Dey was good to us 'caze Lady Liza's son, Mr. Willie Larkin, was de  overseer for his ma, but co'se sometime dey git among 'em an' thrashed  'em out. One time one de niggers runned away, old Caesar Townsy, an' dey  sarnt for Dick Peters to come an' bring his \"nigger dogs.\" Dem dogs was  trained to ketch a nigger same as rabbit dogs is trained to ketch a  rabbit. So Mr. Willie Larkin told Stuart for to say to old man Dick  Peters when he come, 'I'm gone,' but for him to come on. 'I'm gwineter  keep de road,' he say, 'an' cross 'Bigbee at Moscow landin'.' So ol'  Dick Peters, he kept de road lack he tole him to, an' he cross 'Bigbee  at Moscow landin' over in de cane-brake. But dem nigger dogs didn't  never ketch ol' man Caesar. He stayed right wharever he was at 'twell  after S'render, an' de War done ceased. Den he come out, but iffen he  had a been caught, dey'd a used him up pretty rough, but he stayed hid  twell de time done passed.    \"All de women on Lady Liza's place had to go to de fiel' ev'y day an'  dem what had suckerlin' babies would come in 'bout nine o'clock in de  mawnin' an' when de bell ring at twelve an' suckerlin' 'em. One woman  tended to all of 'em in one house. Her name was Ellie Larkin, an' dey  call her 'Mammy Larkin.' She all time sarnt me down in de fiel' for to  git 'em come suckle de chillen, 'caze dat made hit hard on her when dey  gets hongry an' cry.    \"Us didn't get to go to church none, an' us wa'n't larnt nothin'.
