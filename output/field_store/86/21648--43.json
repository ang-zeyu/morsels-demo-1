It is for our readers to say how much weight is  to be given to that portion of the fulmination of the Prophet put forth  under such circumstances.    At this first session of the Legislature, Brigham proceeded to give, in  his Message, his views in relation to African slavery, fully indorsing  it, and prescribing regulations for its establishment in the Territory.  His views upon this subject may be gathered from the following  extract:--         \"Thus while servitude may and should exist, and that too upon       those who are naturally designed to occupy the position of       servant of servants, yet we should not fall into the other       extreme, and make them as beasts of the field, regarding not       the humanity that is in the colored race; nor elevating them,       as some seem disposed, to an equality with those whom nature       and nature's God has indicated to be their masters, their       superiors.\"    In accordance with the foregoing suggestions, the Legislature passed a  law regulating slavery in the Territory, and it has existed in full  force and effect to the present time. There are now a considerable  number of African slaves in the Territory, and a large number of  Indians, \"held to service.\"    During the same session, the Legislature memorialized the President,  setting forth that the federal officers had abandoned the Territory;  reciting the formation of the provisional government of Deseret, and  complaining that \"all the authorities of the Territory, including the  governor and both houses of the Assembly, and marshal, had been set at  naught as exercising their functions illegally and unconstitutionally.\"    The causes which led to this petition were as follows:--    When the Territory was organized, in the winter of 1850-51, the  following named officers were appointed:--Brigham Young, Governor;  Lemuel C. Brandenburg, Chief Justice; Perry E. Brochus and Zerubbabel  Snow, Associate Justices; Seth M. Blair, Attorney General, and B. D.  Harris, Secretary. These officers did not arrive in Utah until July,  1851. Previous to their arrival, Brigham Young had issued a proclamation  ordering an election for delegate to Congress and members of the  Legislature, and providing for taking the census.    The Secretary considered that Young had exceeded his authority, and on  this ground refused to pay over the moneys in his hands for the expenses  of the Legislature.    The Supreme Court being then in session, Harris applied to the court for  an injunction to stay the proceedings of the Legislature, which the  court granted. This order, however, was nugatory, as the court had no  power to enforce its judgments. This, of course, enraged the Mormons;  and the Governor instructed Blair, the District Attorney, who was a  Mormon, to sue out a writ of injunction upon the Secretary, to prevent  him from taking the money out of the Territory. The court decided  against the injunction, thus again sustaining the Secretary.    Again, Congress had appropriated $20,000 for the erection of suitable  buildings at the capital of the Territory. Brigham and his tools, the  members of the Legislature, attempted to appropriate this money, and in  exchange, palm off upon the government, for $20,000, a building which  never cost over $8,000.    These circumstances engendered much feeling between the Mormons and the  gentile officers; and this was in nowise lessened by an incident which  occurred about this time.    Hon. Perry E. Brochus, one of the Supreme Judges, in some remarks made  in a Mormon assembly, commented rather severely upon the peculiar  institution. He commenced by addressing the women upon the subject of  spiritual wife-ism; pointing out to them its wickedness and the unhappy  results that must follow to them and to their children, if the practice  should be persisted in. He said it was against the laws of man and God.  This was undoubtedly the first time, at Salt Lake, that a gentile had  ever spoken in public against Mormon institutions.    The women were excited; the most of them were in tears, before he had  spoken many minutes. The men were astonished and enraged, and one word  of encouragement from their leader would have brought on a collision.  Brigham, with his usual shrewdness, saw this, and was equal to the  occasion. When the Judge sat down, he rose, and by one of those strong,  nervous appeals, for which he is so famous among his brethren, restored  the equilibrium of the audience. Those who, but a moment before, were  bathed in tears, now responded to his broad sarcasm and keen wit, in  screams of laughter; and having fully restored the spirits of the  audience, he turned to the Judge, and administered the following rebuke:  \"I will kick you,\" he said, \"or any other gentile Judge from this stand,  if you or they again attempt to interfere with the affairs of our Zion.\"    The Judge saw that he was beaten, and finding his life threatened and in  danger, soon after left the Territory.    After his departure, Brigham preached the following sermon:--         \"I am at the defiance of the rulers of the greatest nations on       the earth, with the United States all put together, to produce       a more loyal people than the Latter Day Saints. Have they, as       a people, broken any law? No, they have not. Have the United       States? Yes. They have trampled the Constitution under their       feet with impunity, and ridden recklessly over all law, to       persecute and drive this people. Admit, for argument's sake,       that the Mormon elders have more wives than one, yet our       enemies never have proved it. If I had forty wives in the       United States, they did not know it, and could not       substantiate it; neither did I ask any lawyer, judge, or       magistrate for them. I live above law, and so do this people.       Do the laws of the United States require us to crouch and bow       down to the miserable wretches who violate them? No!         \"I defy the world to prove that we have infringed upon that       law. You may circumscribe the whole earth, and pass through       every Christian nation, so called, and what do you find? If       you tell them a 'Mormon' has two wives, they are shocked, and       call it dreadful blasphemy. If you whisper such a thing in the       ears of a gentile, who takes a fresh woman every night, he is       thunderstruck with the enormity of the crime. . . . .         \"Now, let me tell you the great, killing story. 'Governor       Young has sixteen wives and fourteen babies.' Now, they did       not see that sight, but the circumstance was as follows: I       took some of my neighbors into the large carriage, and rode       down to Father Chase's to eat watermelons. When driving out of       the gate, in the evening, Brother Babbitt walks up, and I       invited him into the carriage, and he rode up into the city       with me, and I suppose he told the United States officers.       That, I believe, is the way the story of the sixteen wives and       fourteen children first came into circulation.         \"But this does not begin to be the extent of my possessions,       for I am enlarging on the right hand and on the left; and       shall soon be able, Abraham-like, to muster the strength of my       house, and _take my rights_, asking no favors of judges or       secretaries.\"    At another time he used the following language:--         \"When the officers returned from this Territory to the States,       did we send them away? We did not. I will tell you what I did,       and what I will do again. I did chastise the poor, mean       ruffian,--the poor, miserable creature who came here by the       name of Brochus,--when he arose before this people, to preach       to them, and tell them of meanness which he supposed they were       guilty of, and traduce their characters.         \"It is true, as it is said in the report of these officers, if       I had crooked my little finger he would have been used up. But       I did not bend it. If I had, the sisters alone felt indignant       enough to have chopped him in pieces. I did not do it,       however, but suffered him to fill up the measure of his shame       and iniquity, until his cup is running over.         \"I have no fears whatever of Franklin Pierce excusing me from       office, and saying that another man shall be the Governor of       this Territory. At the beginning of our settlements, when we       sent Almon W. Babbitt to Washington with our constitution for       a State government, and to ask leave to adopt it, he requested       that I should not sign my name to it as Governor; 'for,' said       he, 'if you do, it will thwart all our plans.' I said, 'My       name will go as it is in that document, and stay there, from       this time henceforth and forever. Now,' I continued, 'if you       do not believe it, you may go to Washington, and give those       papers to Dr. Bernheisel, and operate against him, and against       our getting a State government, and you cannot hinder it.'         \"I will be Governor still, after you have done everything you       possibly can to prevent it. We have got a Territorial       Government, and I am and will be Governor, and no power can       hinder it, until the Lord Almighty says, 'Brigham, you need       not be Governor any longer;' and then I am willing to yield to       another Governor.\"    This \"sermon\" was preached at Great Salt Lake City, June 19, 1853, and  is published in the \"Journal of Discourses,\" vol. i. p. 188.    Brigham had appointed his second counsellor, Willard Richards, to fill  the vacancy occasioned by the departure of Secretary Harris. So the  saints had fairly succeeded in ridding themselves"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/446"],[0,"A Book of Remarkable Criminals (#6)"],[1,"on that  of George Peabody. It may have been thought that the contrast was too  glaring, that even the exigencies of national biography had no right  to make the philanthropist Peabody rub shoulders with man's constant  enemy, Peace. To the memory of Peace these few pages can make but  poor amends for the supreme injustice, but, by giving a particular and  authentic account of his career, they may serve as material for  the correction of this grave omission should remorse overtake those  responsible for so undeserved a slur on one of the most unruly of  England's famous sons.    From the literary point of view Peace was unfortunate even in the hour  of his notoriety. In the very year of his trial and execution, the  Annual Register, seized with a fit of respectability from which it  has never recovered, announced that \"the appetite for the strange and  marvellous\" having considerably abated since the year 1757 when the  Register was first published, its \"Chronicle,\" hitherto a rich mine of  extraordinary and sensational occurrences, would become henceforth a  mere diary of important events. Simultaneously with the curtailment  of its \"Chronicle,\" it ceased to give those excellent summaries of  celebrated trials which for many years had been a feature of its  volumes. The question whether \"the appetite for the strange and  marvellous\" has abated in an appreciable degree with the passing of time  and is not perhaps keener than it ever was, is a debatable one. But  it is undeniable that the present volumes of the Annual Register have  fallen away dismally from the variety and human interest of their  predecessors. Of the trial and execution of Peace the volume for 1879  gives but the barest record.    Charles Peace was not born of criminal parents. His father, John  Peace, began work as a collier at Burton-on-Trent. Losing his leg in an  accident, he joined Wombwell's wild beast show and soon acquired some  reputation for his remarkable powers as a tamer of wild animals. About  this time Peace married at Rotherham the daughter of a surgeon in  the Navy. On the death of a favourite son to whom he had imparted  successfully the secrets of his wonderful control over wild beasts of  every kind, Mr. Peace gave up lion-taming and settled in Sheffield as a  shoemaker.    It was at Sheffield, in the county of Yorkshire, already famous in the  annals of crime as the county of John Nevison and Eugene Aram, that  Peace first saw the light. On May 14, 1832, there was born to John Peace  in Sheffield a son, Charles, the youngest of his family of four. When he  grew to boyhood Charles was sent to two schools near Sheffield, where  he soon made himself remarkable, not as a scholar, but for his singular  aptitude in a variety of other employments such as making paper models,  taming cats, constructing a peep-show, and throwing up a heavy ball of  shot which he would catch in a leather socket fixed on to his forehead.    The course of many famous men's lives has been changed by what appeared  at the time to be an unhappy accident. Who knows what may have been the  effect on Charles Peace's subsequent career of an accident he met with  in 1846 at some rolling mills, in which he was employed? A piece of red  hot steel entered his leg just below the knee, and after eighteen months  spent in the Sheffield Infirmary he left it a cripple for life. About  this time Peace's father died. Peace and his family were fond of  commemorating events of this kind in suitable verse; the death of John  Peace was celebrated in the following lines:         \"In peace he lived;           In peace he died;       Life was our desire,           But God denied.\"      Of the circumstances that first led Peace to the commission of crime we  know nothing. How far enforced idleness, bad companionship, according to  some accounts the influence of a criminally disposed mother, how far  his own daring and adventurous temper provoked him to robbery, cannot  be determined accurately. His first exploit was the stealing of an old  gentleman's gold watch, but he soon passed to greater things. On October  26, 1851, the house of a lady living in Sheffield was broken into and a  quantity of her property stolen. Some of it was found in the possession  of Peace, and he was arrested. Owing no doubt to a good character for  honesty given him by his late employer Peace was let off lightly with a  month's imprisonment.    After his release Peace would seem to have devoted himself for a time to  music, for which he had always a genuine passion. He taught himself to  play tunes on a violin with one string, and at entertainments which he  attended was described as \"the modern Paganini.\" In later life when he  had attained to wealth and prosperity the violin and the harmonium were  a constant source of solace during long winter evenings in Greenwich and  Peckham. But playing a one-stringed violin at fairs and public-houses  could not be more than a relaxation to a man of Peace's active temper,  who had once tasted what many of those who have practised it, describe  as the fascination of that particular form of nocturnal adventure known  by the unsympathetic name of burglary. Among the exponents of the art  Peace was at this time known as a \"portico-thief,\" that is to say one  who contrived to get himself on to the portico of a house and from that  point of vantage make his entrance into the premises. During the  year 1854 the houses of a number of well-to-do residents in and about  Sheffield were entered after this fashion, and much valuable property  stolen. Peace was arrested, and with him a girl with whom he was keeping  company, and his sister, Mary Ann, at that time Mrs. Neil. On October  20, 1854, Peace was sentenced at Doncaster Sessions to four years' penal  servitude, and the ladies who had been found in possession of the  stolen property to six months apiece. Mrs. Neil did not long survive her  misfortune. She would seem to have been married to a brutal and drunken  husband, whom Peace thrashed on more than one occasion for ill-treating  his sister. After one of these punishments Neil set a bulldog on to  Peace; but Peace caught the dog by the lower jaw and punched it into a  state of coma. The death in 1859 of the unhappy Mrs. Neil was lamented  in appropriate verse, probably the work of her brother:         \"I was so long with pain opprest           That wore my strength away;       It made me long for endless rest           Which never can decay.\"      On coming out of prison in 1858, Peace resumed his fiddling, but it was  now no more than a musical accompaniment to burglary. This had become  the serious business of Peace's life, to be pursued, should necessity  arise, even to the peril of men's lives. His operations extended beyond  the bounds of his native town. The house of a lady living in Manchester  was broken into on the night of August 11, 1859, and a substantial booty  carried away. This was found the following day concealed in a hole in  a field. The police left it undisturbed and awaited the return of  the robber. When Peace and another man arrived to carry it away, the  officers sprang out on them. Peace, after nearly killing the officer  who was trying to arrest him, would have made his escape, had not other  policemen come to the rescue. For this crime Peace was sentenced to six  years' penal servitude, in spite of a loyal act of perjury on the part  of his aged mother, who came all the way from Sheffield to swear that he  had been with her there on the night of the crime.    He was released from prison again in 1864, and returned to Sheffield.  Things did not prosper with him there, and he went back to Manchester.  In 1866 he was caught in the act of burglary at a house in Lower  Broughton. He admitted that at the time he was fuddled with whisky;  otherwise his capture would have been more difficult and dangerous.  Usually a temperate man, Peace realised on this occasion the value  of sobriety even in burglary, and never after allowed intemperance to  interfere with his success. A sentence of eight years' penal servitude  at Manchester Assizes on December 3, 1866, emphasised this wholesome  lesson.    Whilst serving this sentence Peace emulated Jack Sheppard in a daring  attempt to escape from Wakefield prison. Being engaged on some repairs,  he smuggled a small ladder into his cell. With the help of a saw made  out of some tin, he cut a hole through the ceiling of the cell, and was  about to get out on to the roof when a warder came in. As the latter  attempted to seize the ladder Peace knocked him down, ran along the  wall of the prison, fell off on the inside owing to the looseness of the  bricks, slipped into the governor's house where he changed his clothes,  and there, for an hour and a half, waited for an opportunity to escape.  This was denied him, and he was recaptured in the governor's bedroom.  The prisons at Millbank, Chatham and Gibraltar were all visited by Peace  before his final release in 1872. At Chatham he is said to have taken  part in a mutiny and been flogged for his pains.    On his liberation from prison Peace rejoined his family in Sheffield.  He was now a husband and father. In 1859 he had taken to wife a widow  of the name of Hannah Ward. Mrs. Ward was already the mother of a  son, Willie. Shortly after her marriage with Peace she gave birth to a  daughter, and during his fourth term of imprisonment presented him with  a son. Peace never saw this child, who died before his release. But,  true to the family custom, on his return from prison the untimely death  of little \"John Charles\" was commemorated by the printing of a funeral  card in his honour, bearing the following sanguine verses:         \"Farewell, my dear son, by us all beloved,       Thou art gone to dwell in the mansions above.       In the bosom of Jesus Who sits on the throne       Thou art anxiously waiting to welcome us home.\"      Whether from a"]]]
