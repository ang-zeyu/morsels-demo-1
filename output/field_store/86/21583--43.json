The translation of the      whole volume appears to be good.\"    The note from the \"Voyage of La Perouse\" and the remarks of Lallemant  are as follows:--        \"A LA PEROUSE.--C'est a vous que l'Europe est redevable de la      publication de cet ouvrage, dont le manuscrit fut trouve parmi      les papiers du Gouverneur du fort du Prince de Galles, lorsque      vous vous rendites maitre des etablissements anglais dans la      Baie de Hudson. En le remettant a son auteur, a la condition      expresse de le faire imprimer et publier, jamais vainqueur      n'exerca plus utilement son droit de conquete et n'imposa au      vaincu une condition plus honorable.[12] Elle etait digne du      marin aussi genereux qu'eclaire qui devait, quelques annees      apres, entreprendre un voyage non moins important, et dont      aujourd'hui nous deplorons la perte.        \"Pourquoi faut-il, brave et excellent _Dupetit-Thouars_, que      vous nous ayez ete aussi ravi! vous qui m'excitates avec tant      d'ardeur a traduire la relation de _Samuel Hearne_, et qui,      apres avoir tout sacrifie pour aller redemander _la Perouse_ aux      iles de la mer du Sud, soupiriez apres la paix pour reprendre      vos projets de decouvertes. Accable par le nombre au combat      d'_Aboukir_, une mort glorieuse vous a enleve a votre patrie, a      deux soeurs cheries, a l'amitie, aux sciences, et il ne nous est      revenu de vous que cette reponse heroique a l'ennemi: '_Voyez      mon pavillon; on ne le deplacera qu'en m'otant la vie._'        \"_La Perouse_, vous l'eussiez pleure comme nous! il etait si      attache a son pays, a son metier, et si passionne pour leur      gloire. Il avait une ame si forte et un coeur si sensible; un      esprit si cultive et des dehors si modestes. Il etait ami si      vrai et frere si tendre. _Perpetue, Felicite_, j'en appele a      votre douleur profonde!        \"En associant son nom au votre, _la Perouse_, permettez qu'il      partage avec vous l'hommage d'une traduction a laquelle je me      suis empresse de consacrer mes veilles pour concourir a vos vues      respectives d'utilite. Puisse ce monument etre digne de vous      deux!        \"LALLEMANT,      \"l'un des Secretaires de la Marine.\"    Hearne intimates on page 32 that the map here reproduced differs  slightly from those which he had previously published, a reference  doubtless to the one in Cook's \"Voyage,\" but he claims that this one is  the most accurate, since he had revised it with great care. Both maps  are here given; further explorations in the northern country alone can  determine which is the more correct.    Fort Prince of Wales, from which place Hearne started on his expedition,  was built by the Hudson's Bay Company in the years 1733 to 1771. It is  said to have been designed by English military engineers, and, according  to Joseph Robson, was built under the direction of the resident  Governor, though Robson himself had much to do with its construction.    The fort, which is one of the most interesting military ruins on the  continent, stands on Eskimo Point, just west of the mouth of Churchill  River, and though some parts of the walls have fallen, it was, when I  visited it, in much the same condition as when built, except that the  houses within it had been gutted by fire. It is 310 feet long on the  north and south sides, and 317 feet long on the east and west sides,  measured from corner to corner of the bastions. The walls are from 37 to  42 feet thick, and 16 feet 9 inches high to the top of the parapet,  which is 5 feet high and 6 feet 3 inches wide. On the outside the wall  was faced with dressed stone, except towards the river, while on the  inside undressed stone was used. The interior of the wall is a rubble of  boulders, held together by a poor mortar. In the parapet are forty  embrasures and forty guns, from six to twenty-four pounders, are lying  on the wall near them, now partly hidden by low willows, currant and  gooseberry bushes. The three store-houses and the magazine, which once  occupied the centres of the bastions, have disappeared. Within the  square enclosure are the stone walls of a house 103 feet long, 33 feet  wide, and 17 feet high, which is said to have had a flat roof covered  with lead. The small observatory used by Mr. Wales in 1769 was situated  on the south-east bastion.    [Illustration: PLAN OF FORT PRINCE OF WALES.  By J. B. TYRRELL. 1894. Walls, 37 to 42 feet thick, 16 feet 9 inches  high. Scale: 80 feet = 1 inch.]    This new edition is a reprint of the quarto edition of 1795. The  pagination of the original has been inserted, enclosed within square  brackets, at the proper places in the text, and the notes are given as  in the original volume. The notes of the present editor are indicated by  Arabic numerals.    Most of the photographs here reproduced were taken by the editor in 1893  and 1894, but those of Artillery Lake were taken by Mr. J. W. Tyrrell in  1900, and the Eskimo implements of native copper were obtained by him at  that time.    Several additional maps have been added. Among these are the portions of  Cook's and Pennant's maps of parts of North America showing the first  published records of Hearne's courses; a map of the Coppermine River as  surveyed by Sir John Franklin in 1821; and a general map of Northern  Canada drawn on the same scale and projection as Hearne's large map, and  with his routes laid down as correctly as it has been possible for me to  determine them. The latter map is much more easily compared with  Hearne's original map than one drawn on the polyconic projection in  common use at the present time.    I wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr. Edward A. Preble of the  Biological Survey, Washington, D.C., U.S.A., author of \"A Biological  Investigation of the Hudson Bay Region\" and \"A Biological Investigation  of the Athabaska-Mackenzie Region,\" who has so kindly annotated Chapter  X. on the fauna and flora of Hudson Bay, and has also added the notes to  which his initials are attached in other parts of the volume.

It gives me the impression that it is a story  written from memory years after the journey was performed, but his  general description of the country on the Red Deer River just north of  the Province of Manitoba, and of the plains of Saskatchewan to the  south-west of it, is too clear to be mistaken. I am indebted to  Professor W. H. Holmes, Director of the United States Bureau of  Ethnology, for assistance in identifying the \"Naywatamee poets\" with the  Mandan Indians.    [9] As farther evidence that this expedition was undertaken solely for  the purpose of obtaining a knowledge of the whereabouts of the copper  deposits, Edward Umfreville, who was employed as a writer at York  Factory in Hearne's time, makes the following interesting statement:  \"Some years since, the Company being informed that the Indians  frequently brought fine pieces of copper to their Settlements on  Churchill River, they took into consideration, and appointed a person  (S. Hearne) with proper assistants, to survey and examine the river  where the valuable acquisition was supposed to be concealed.\"--_The  Present State of Hudson's Bay_, by Edward Umfreville, p. 45.

It is stated  by Beckles Willson in \"The Great Company\" that short accounts of his  journey had been published in 1773 and again in 1778-80, but though  diligent search has been made for these accounts in the British Museum  and elsewhere, no trace of them can be found.    [12] \"Le Gouverneur _Hearne_ avait fait, en 1772, un voyage par terre  vers le Nord, en partant du fort Churchill dans la Baie de Hudson,  '_Samuel Hearne partit du fort du Prince de Galles le 7 Decembre 1770_,'  voyage dont on attend les details avec impatience; le journal manuscrit  en fut trouve par _la Perouse_ dans les papiers de ce Gouverneur, qui  insista pour qu'il lui fut laisse comme sa propriete particuliere.

Calhoun, joint resolutions of annexation were passed by both houses of  Congress, subject to concurrence of the Congress of the new republic.  Strange as it may seem, the resolutions that added to the territory of the  United States more than the New England and Middle States combined, and  which eventually led to extension to the Pacific coast and hundreds of  miles north, only passed the lower house by twenty-two majority, and the  Senate by a majority of two.    When the resolution was passed, the minister from Mexico to our  government, General Almonte, demanded his passports, and diplomatic  relations between the governments ceased. On July 4, 1845, the Texas  Congress accepted and ratified the resolutions of annexation by unanimous  vote, and Texas was a State of the Union.    General Taylor's little army of observation was ordered to Corpus Christi,  Texas, and became \"The Army of Occupation.\" All other available forces  were ordered to join him, including General Worth and his forces in  Florida. At the time there were in the line of the army eight regiments of  infantry, four of artillery, and two of dragoons, stationed along the  northern frontier from Fort Kent in the northeast of Maine to the west end  of Lake Superior, and along the western frontier from Fort Snelling to  Fort Leavenworth, and southward to Fort Jessup in Louisiana.    By the middle of October, 1846, three thousand eight hundred and sixty men  of all arms had concentrated at Corpus Christi. Seven companies of the  Second Dragoons had marched from Fort Jessup to San Patricio on the Nueces  River, about twenty-eight miles up from Corpus Christi; the other three  companies were halted at San Antonio, Texas. Near our camps were extensive  plains well adapted to military manoeuvres, which were put to prompt use  for drill and professional instruction. There were many advantages too in  the way of amusement, game on the wild prairies and fish in the broad gulf  were plentiful, and there was the salt water for bathing. On one occasion  during the winter a violent north wind forced the waters over the beach,  in some places far enough to disturb our camps, and when they receded,  quantities of fish were found in the little puddles left behind, and  turtles more than enough to supply the army.    The officers built a theatre, depending upon their own efforts to  reimburse them. As there was no one outside the army except two rancheros  within a hundred miles, our dramatic company was organized from among the  officers, who took both male and female characters. In farce and comedy we  did well enough, and soon collected funds to pay for the building and  incidental expenses. The house was filled every night. General Worth  always encouraging us, General Taylor sometimes, and General Twiggs  occasionally, we found ourselves in funds sufficient to send over to New  Orleans for costumes, and concluded to try tragedy. The \"Moor of Venice\"  was chosen, Lieutenant Theoderic Porter[1] to be the Moor, and Lieutenant  U. S. Grant to be the daughter of Brabantio. But after rehearsal Porter  protested that male heroines could not support the character nor give  sentiment to the hero, so we sent over to New Orleans and secured Mrs.  Hart, who was popular with the garrisons in Florida. Then all went well,  and life through the winter was gay.    Formal diplomatic relations between the republics were suspended, but  quasi negotiations were continued, seeking a course by which war might be  averted. The authorities of Mexico were not averse to the settlement  according to the claims of Texas,--the Rio Grande frontier,--but the  political affairs of the country were such that they could not agree.  Excitement in the United States increased as the suspense continued. But  the authorities, having confidence in their negotiations or wishing to  precipitate matters, ordered General Taylor to march across to the Rio  Grande at Matamoras in the spring of 1846. The execution of the order  precipitated war.    The move from Corpus Christi to the Rio Grande made necessary a change of  base from St. Joseph's Island to Point Isabel and Brazos Santiago, near  the mouth of the Rio Grande. Supplies were sent by sea, under charge of  Major Munroe, with a siege train and field battery, and the army took up  its march on the 9th of March, 1846, the advance under General Twiggs,  consisting of the dragoons and Ringgold's field battery. The army was well  instructed, under good discipline, and fully prepared for field work, the  weather was fine, and the firm turf of the undulating prairies made the  march easy. Wild horses and cattle, and deer and antelope, were often seen  in the distance as they scampered away to hide themselves. On the 19th the  head of the column approached Arroyo Colorado, one hundred and thirty  miles from Corpus Christi. The arroyo was about three feet deep, of salt  water. Mexican lancers were on the southern side, and gave notice that  they had orders to resist our further advance. On the 21st the army was up  and deployed along the high banks of the arroyo, the field batteries in  position. General Worth was ordered to make the crossing, and rode at the  head of the column. We looked with confidence for a fight and the flow of  blood down the salt water before we could cross, but the Mexicans had no  artillery, and could not expose their cavalry to the fire of our  batteries; they made their formal protest, however, that the crossing  would be regarded as a declaration of war.    On the 24th of March the column reached the road leading from Point Isabel  to Matamoras. General Taylor ordered Worth to march the greater part of  the army towards Matamoras and halt at the first good camping-ground, and  rode towards Point Isabel to meet the detachment ordered there under Major  Munroe. He found them already landed, and the Mexicans fired their little  hamlets and fled. After ordering construction of protection for his  supplies and defensive works for the troops, General Taylor returned to  the army, and rode with General Worth towards the Rio Grande. As the army  approached the river the Mexicans on the Matamoras side made some display  of forces, manned their works on that side, and prepared to resist us,  under the impression that we would cross at once. General Worth was sent  over, and was met by General La Vega, on the part of General Mejia,  commanding on that side. He was told that Mexico had not declared war,  that the American consul was in the exercise of his functions; but Worth's  request to see the consul was refused, which was denounced as a  belligerent act, and he cautioned General La Vega against passing Mexicans  to the north side of the river.    Camps were pitched in range of the Mexican works about Matamoras, grounds  staked for constructing defensive works, and large details put out to work  on them. The Mexican forces at this time were three thousand, and they  were soon joined by two thousand more.    Political affairs with them were confused. President Herrera was thought  to favor the claims of Texas to the Rio Grande border. General Paredes  made pronunciamento, overthrew the president's government, and had  authority as war president. He sent General Ampudia to the frontier to  take charge, but the appointment was not satisfactory on the border, and  General Arista was assigned. There was discord over there between the  authorities and the generals, while General Taylor was too far from his  government to be bothered. His army was all that he could wish, except in  numbers.    Marauding parties came over occasionally and made trouble about the  ranches on the American side. One party killed Colonel Cross, our chief  quartermaster, on the 10th of April. Scouting parties were sent out to  look for the intruders. Lieutenant Theoderic Porter, in command of one  party, and one of his men were caught in ambush and killed. Captain  Walker, of the Texan Rangers, while out on a scout lost his camp guard of  five men, surprised and killed, and later Captains Thornton and Hardee, of  the dragoons, were met at Rancho Carricitos by a large cavalry force and  some infantry under General Torrijon, who took captive or killed the  entire party. Captains Thornton and Hardee and Lieutenant Kane were made  prisoners. The other commissioned officer of the command, George T. Mason,  of my class, refused to surrender; being a superior swordsman, he tried to  cut his way out, and was killed. This affair was taken as open war, and  General Taylor called on the governors of Texas and Louisiana--under his  authority from Washington--for volunteers of infantry and cavalry.    The capture of Thornton and Hardee created great excitement with the  people at home. Fanning's massacre and the Alamo at San Antonio were  remembered, and it was reported of General Ampudia, who on a recent  occasion had captured a general in Yucatan, that he boiled his head in  oil. So it was thought he would give no quarter; but in a day or two we  heard from the officers that they received great kindness from their  captors, and that General Ampudia had ordered that his government should  allow them their full pay and every liberty consistent with their  safe-keeping. They declined, however, to accept pay, and were held as the  guests of Generals Arista and Ampudia.    On the 1st of May our tents were struck, wagons parked, assembly sounded,  and the troops were under arms at three A.M., marched at four o'clock, and  bivouacked within ten miles of Point Isabel. No one was advised of the  cause of movements, but all knew that our general understood his business.  He had been informed that General Arista, with his movable forces, had  marched to Rancho de Longoreno, some leagues below us on the river,  intending to cross and cut us off from the"]]]
