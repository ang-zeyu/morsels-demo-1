[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39996"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 5 (of 6) (#6)"],[1," of his education in his own country; that then passing into  Tuscany, he formed himself, not by _the voice_, but, as Vasari avers, upon  the pictures of Lippi and Gozzoli; and that finally seeking Bologna, he  painted for the Bentivogli, and resided also with Francia rather in quality  of an assistant than a pupil. A farther proof I gather from Malvasia  himself; that in the journals of Francesco, in which he read the names of  two hundred and twenty pupils, he found no mention of Costa. In the rest,  however, I concur; as to his having availed himself of the works of  Francia, in imitation of whom a number of Madonnas are seen in the  collections at Bologna, much inferior to the paintings of the supposed  master; but occasionally not unworthy of being compared with them. Such is  an altar-piece, divided into several compartments, removed from Faenza into  the Casa Ercolani; a production characterized by Crespi, in his annotations  to Baruffaldi, as being executed \"with a fervour, a refinement, softness,  and a warmth which may be pronounced altogether Raffaellesque.\" He  particularly shone in his countenances of men, as may be seen from those of  the apostles at S. Petronio, and from his San Girolamo, which there offers  the finest specimen of his art. He was less employed in his own country  than in Bologna, though he gave several pupils to the former; among others  the celebrated Dosso and Ercole of Ferrara. He mostly resided at Mantua, at  which court he was highly appreciated, although Mantegna had been his  immediate predecessor, and Giulio Romano succeeded him. I may refer to what  I there wrote respecting this artist.    A less doubtful pupil of Francia's was Girolamo Marchesi da Cotignola. His  portraits are much praised by Vasari, but his compositions much less so. He  was by no means happy in all; and in particular one which he produced at  Rimini, is severely criticised by the historian. There are various  altar-pieces by him at Bologna and elsewhere, all of the usual composition  of the quattrocentisti, which goes to redeem his fault. One of these,  exhibiting very beautiful perspective, is in possession of the Serviti at  Pesaro, where the Virgin is seen on a throne, before which, in a kneeling  posture, is the Marchesa Ginevra Sforza, with her son Constantius II.; nor  is this the only specimen of his works conducted in the service of royal  houses. The design is rather dry, but the colour very pleasing; the heads  grand, the draperies well disposed; and in short, were it the only  production of his hand, he would well deserve to rank among the most  illustrious painters in the old style. That he obtained no reputation at  Rome, or Naples, as Vasari observes, was owing to his arriving in those  cities too late, namely, in the pontificate of Paul III.; so that his style  being then regarded merely in the light of an article out of fashion, he  was unable to make his way. He died during the same pontificate, between  the interval of 1534 and 1549. Orlandi, who brings in the decease of  Cotignola as early as 1518, is not only refuted by the above dates marked  by Vasari, and, with slight difference, by Baruffaldi, but moreover by a  picture of S. Girolamo at the church of the conventual friars of S. Marino,  executed in 1520.    Amico Aspertini is enrolled by Malvasia (pp. 58, 59) in the school of  Francia, a fact that Vasari did not choose to notice, being wholly bent on  amusing posterity with a portrait of the person and manners of \"Mastro  Amico,\" who was indeed a compound of pleasantry, eccentricity, and madness.  He had adopted a maxim in painting, which in regard to literature, was  commonly received in that age; to wit, that every individual ought to  impress upon his works the image of his own genius; and, like Erasmus, who  exposed to ridicule Cicero's imitators in writing, this artist was fond of  deriding those of Raffaello in painting. It was his leading principle to  take the tour of Italy, to copy here and there, without discrimination,  whatever most pleased him, and afterwards to form a style of his own, \"like  an experienced inventor,\" to preserve an expression of Vasari. Conducted on  this plan is a Pieta by him, in the church of S. Petronio, which may be  compared with the trecentisti in point of forms, the attitudes, and the  grouping of the figures. We may add, however, with Guercino, that this  artist seemed to handle two pencils; with one of which he painted for low  prices, or out of despite, or for revenge; and this he made use of in S.  Petronio and several other pieces; the other he practised only on behalf of  those who remunerated him honourably for his labours, and were cautious how  they provoked him; and with this he displayed his art in various facades of  palaces, commended by Vasari himself; in the church of S. Martino; and in  many other works cited by Malvasia, who describes him as a good imitator of  Giorgione.    He had an elder brother of the name of Guido, a youth who employed uncommon  diligence and care, carried perhaps to excess, in his art. He died at the  age of thirty-five, and was lamented by his more poetical fellow citizens  in elegiac strains. Malvasia is of opinion, that, had he survived, he would  have equalled the fame of Bagnacavallo; such was the promise held forth by  a painting of the Crucifixion under the portico of S. Pietro, and by his  other works. According to the same biographer, it was Vasari's malice which  led him to assign Ercole of Ferrara for Guido's master, being jealous of  affording M. Amico the fame of forming such a pupil. I feel persuaded, with  Vasari, no less from the age of Guido than from his taste, and from the  date of 1491, which he inscribed on this highly commended picture, that  assuredly it cannot belong to the pupil of a pupil formed by Francia.  Similar critical errors we have already noticed in Baldinucci; and they are  not very easily to be avoided where a party spirit is apt to prevail.    Gio. Maria Chiodarolo, a rival of the preceding, and subsequently of  Innocenzo da Imola, in the palace of Viola, left behind him a name above  the generality of this school. Malvasia mentions twenty-four other scholars  of Francesco Francia, in which he was followed by Orlandi, when treating of  Lorenzo Gandolfi. By some mistake these pupils are referred by him to  Costa; while Bottari, misled by Orlandi, fell into the same error, although  he laments \"that men, in order to spare trouble, are apt to follow one  another like sheep or cranes.\" Yet in very extensive and laborious works it  is difficult sometimes not to nod; nor should I occasionally note down  others' inequalities, except in the hope of finding readers considerate  enough to extend the same liberality towards mine. The forementioned names  will prove of much utility to those who, in Milan, in Pavia, in Parma, and  other places in Italy, may turn their attention to works in the ancient  Bolognese style, and may hear them attributed, as it often happens, to  Francia, instead of the pupils formed by him to practice in those  districts, and invariably tenacious of his manner. He had also others, who  from their intercourse with more modern artists, claim place in a better  epoch; and for such we shall reserve them.    We must previously however take a survey of some cities of Romagna, and  select what seems to belong to our present argument. We shall commence with  Ravenna, a city that preserved design during periods of barbarism better  than any other in Italy. Nor do we elsewhere meet with works in mosaic so  well composed, and in ivory, or in marble, cut in so able a manner; all  vestiges of a power and grandeur worthy of exciting the jealousy of Rome,  when the seat of her princes and exarchs was removed to Ravenna. This city  too having fallen from its splendour, and after many vicissitudes being  governed by the Polentani, was no less indebted to them for an illustrious  poet in the person of Dante, than a great painter in Giotto.[6] This artist  painted in the church called Porto di Fuori, several histories from the  evangelists, which still remain there; and at S. Francesco and other places  in the city, we may trace reliques of his pencil, or at least of his style.  The Polentani being expelled, and the state brought under the subjection of  Venice, from this last capital the city of Ravenna derived the founder of a  new school.         Footnote 6: It is remarkable that, a century previous to the       arrival of Giotto, we find in Ravenna one _Johannes Pictor_;       a fact supplied by the learned Count Fantuzzi, to whom both       Ravenna and the public owe so much valuable information. See       his \"_Monumenti Ravennati_, during the middle ages, for the       most part inedited,\" vol. i. p. 347. In vol. ii. p. 210,       there is mention of a parchment of 1246, in which one       Graziadeo, a notary, orders that in the Portuense church       there be made \"imagines magnae et spatiosae ad aurum,\" which       means mosaic, or painting upon a gold ground, a custom so       much practised in those times.    This was Niccolo Rondinello, mentioned by Vasari as one \"who, above all  others, imitated Gian Bellini, his master, to whom he did credit, and  assisted him in all his works.\" In the life of Bellini, and in that of  Palma, Vasari gives a list of his best paintings, exhibited in Ravenna. In  these his progress is very perceptible. He displays most of the antique in  his picture of S. Giovanni, placed in that church, for which he also  executed one of the Virgin, upon a gold ground. His taste is more modern in  the larger altar-piece of San Domenico; whose composition rises above the  monotony of the age, giving a representation of saints in great variety of  attitudes and situations. The design is exact, though always inclining to  dryness, the countenances less select, and the colouring less vivid than  those of his master; with equal care in his "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4011"],[0,"Epicoene; Or, The Silent Woman (#6)"],[1," another on facile  and ready genius, and translates it, adapting it to his  recollection of his fellow-playwright, Shakespeare.  To call such  passages -- which Jonson never intended for publication --  plagiarism, is to obscure the significance of words.  To disparage  his memory by citing them is a preposterous use of scholarship.  Jonson's prose, both in his dramas, in the descriptive comments of  his masques, and in the \"Discoveries,\" is characterised by clarity  and vigorous directness, nor is it wanting in a fine sense of form  or in the subtler graces of diction.    When Jonson died there was a project for a handsome monument to his  memory. But the Civil War was at hand, and the project failed.  A  memorial, not insufficient, was carved on the stone covering his  grave in one of the aisles of Westminster Abbey:    \"O rare Ben Jonson.\"    FELIX E. SCHELLING.

This makes that I now number you, not only in the names  of favour, but the names of justice to what I write; and do presently  call you to the exercise of that noblest, and manliest virtue; as  coveting rather to be freed in my fame, by the authority of a judge,  than the credit of an undertaker. Read, therefore, I pray you, and  censure. There is not a line, or syllable in it, changed from the  simplicity of the first copy. And, when you shall consider, through the  certain hatred of some, how much a man's innocency may be endangered by  an uncertain accusation; you will, I doubt not, so begin to hate the  iniquity of such natures, as I shall love the contumely done me, whose  end was so honourable as to be wiped off by your sentence.

PROLOGUE       Truth says, of old the art of making plays     Was to content the people; and their praise     Was to the poet money, wine, and bays.       But in this age, a sect of writers are,     That, only, for particular likings care,     And will taste nothing that is popular.       With such we mingle neither brains nor breasts;     Our wishes, like to those make public feasts,     Are not to please the cook's taste, but the guests'.       Yet, if those cunning palates hither come,     They shall find guests' entreaty, and good room;     And though all relish not, sure there will be some,       That, when they leave their seats, shall make them say,     Who wrote that piece, could so have wrote a play,     But that he knew this was the better way.       For, to present all custard, or all tart,     And have no other meats, to bear a part.     Or to want bread, and salt, were but course art.       The poet prays you then, with better thought     To sit; and, when his cates are all in brought,     Though there be none far-fet, there will dear-bought,       Be fit for ladies: some for lords, knights, 'squires;     Some for your waiting-wench, and city-wires;     Some for your men, and daughters of Whitefriars.       Nor is it, only, while you keep your seat     Here, that his feast will last; but you shall eat     A week at ord'naries, on his broken meat:       If his muse be true,       Who commends her to you.          ANOTHER.       The ends of all, who for the scene do write,     Are, or should be, to profit and delight.     And still't hath been the praise of all best times,     So persons were not touch'd, to tax the crimes.     Then, in this play, which we present to-night,     And make the object of your ear and sight,     On forfeit of yourselves, think nothing true:     Lest so you make the maker to judge you,     For he knows, poet never credit gain'd     By writing truths, but things (like truths) well feign'd.     If any yet will, with particular sleight     Of application, wrest what he doth write;     And that he meant, or him, or her, will say:     They make a libel, which he made a play.

PAGE: It will get you the dangerous name of a poet in town, sir;     besides me a perfect deal of ill-will at the mansion you wot of,     whose lady is the argument of it; where now I am the welcomest     thing under a man that comes there.       CLER: I think, and above a man too, if the truth were rack'd out     of you.       PAGE: No, faith, I'll confess before, sir. The gentlewomen play with     me, and throw me on the bed; and carry me in to my lady; and she     kisses me with her oil'd face; and puts a peruke on my head; and     asks me an I will wear her gown? and I say, no: and then she     hits me a blow o' the ear, and calls me Innocent! and lets me go.       CLER: No marvel if the door be kept shut against your master, when     the entrance is so easy to you--well sir, you shall go there no     more, lest I be fain to seek your voice in my lady's rushes, a     fortnight hence. Sing, sir.       PAGE [SINGS]: Still to be neat, still to be drest--       [ENTER TRUEWIT.]       TRUE: Why, here's the man that can melt away his time and never     feels it! What between his mistress abroad, and his ingle at     home, high fare, soft lodging, fine clothes, and his fiddle; he     thinks the hours have no wings, or the day no post-horse. Well,     sir gallant, were you struck with the plague this minute, or     condemn'd to any capital punishment to-morrow, you would begin     then to think, and value every article of your time, esteem it     at the true rate, and give all for it.       CLER: Why what should a man do?       TRUE: Why, nothing; or that which, when it is done, is as idle.
