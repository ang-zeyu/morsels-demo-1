What dreadful words are these--and even  worse were at the tip of your tongue! Mother--Mother Neforis! Your name  means kindness, but you can be cruel, bitterly cruel!\"    Still he drew her fondly to him, and kissed her hair and brow and cheeks  with eager haste, in a vehemence of feeling which came over him like a  revulsion after the shock he had gone through; and when they parted  he had given her leave to negotiate for little Katharina's hand on his  behalf, and she had promised in return that it should be not on the  morrow but the day after at soonest. This delay seemed to him a sort  of victory and when he found himself alone and reflected on what he had  done in yielding to his mother, though his heart bled from the wounds of  which he himself knew not the depth, he rejoiced that he had not bound  Paula by any closer tie. His eyes had indeed told her much, but the word  \"Love\" had not passed his lips--and yet that was what it came to.--But  surely a cousin might be allowed to kiss the hand of a lovely relation.  She was a desirable woman--ah, how desirable!--and must ever be: but  to quarrel with his parents for the sake of a girl, were she Aphrodite  herself, or one of the Muses or the Graces--that was impossible! There  were thousands of pretty women in the world, but only one mother; and  how often had his heart beat high and won another heart, taken all it  had to give, and then easily and quickly recovered its balance.    This time however, it seemed more deeply hit than on former occasions;  even the lovely Persian slave for whose sake he had committed the  wildest follies while yet scarcely more than a school-boy--even the  bewitching Heliodora at Constantinople for whom he still had a tender  thought, had not agitated him so strongly. It was hard to give up this  Paula; but there was no help for it. To-morrow he must do his best to  establish their intercourse on a friendly and fraternal footing; for he  could have no hope that she would be content to accept his love only,  like the gentle Heliodora, who was quite her equal in birth. Life would  have been fair, unutterably fair, with this splendid creature by his  side! If only he could take her to the Capital he felt sure that all the  world would stand still to turn round and gaze at her. And if she loved  him--if she met him open-armed.... Oh, why had spiteful fate made her  a Melchite? But then, alas, alas! There must surely be something wrong  with her nature and temper; would she not otherwise have been able in  two years to gain the love, instead of the dislike, of his excellent and  fond mother?--Well, after all, it was best so; but Paula's image haunted  him nevertheless and spoilt his sleep, and his longing for her was not  to be stilled.    Neforis, meanwhile, did not return at once to her husband but went to  find Paula. This business must be settled on all sides and at once.  If she could have believed that her victory would give the invalid  unqualified pleasure she would have hastened to him with the good news,  for she knew no higher joy than to procure him a moment's happiness; but  the Mukaukas had agreed to her choice very reluctantly. Katharina  seemed to him too small and childish for his noble son, whose mental  superiority had been revealed to him unmistakably and undeniably, in  many long discussions since his return, to the delight of his father's  heart. \"The water-wagtail,\" though he wished her every happiness, did  not satisfy him for Orion. To him, the father, Paula would have been  a well-beloved daughter-in-law, and he had often found pleasure in  picturing her by Orion's side. But she was a Melchite; he knew too how  ill-affected his wife was towards her, so he kept his wish locked in  his own breast in order not to vex the faithful companion who lived,  thought, and felt for him alone; and Dame Neforis knew or guessed all  this, and said to herself that it would cost him his night's rest if he  were to be told at once what a concession Orion had made.    With Paula it was different. The sooner she learnt that she had nothing  to expect from their son, the better for her.    That very morning she and Orion had greeted each other like a couple  of lovers and just now they had parted like a promised bride and  bridegroom. She would not again be witness to such vexatious doings;  so she went to the young girl's room and confided to her with much  satisfaction the happy prospects her son had promised them,--only Paula  must say nothing about it till the day after to-morrow.    The moment she entered the room Paula inferred from her beaming  expression that she had something to say unpleasant to herself, so she  preserved due composure. Her face wore a look of unmoved indifference  while she submitted to the overflow of a too-happy mother's heart; and  she wished the betrothed couple joy: but she did so with a smile that  infuriated Neforis.    She was not on the whole spiteful; but face to face with this girl, her  nature was transformed, and she rather liked the idea of showing her,  once more in her life, that in her place humility would beseem her. All  this she said to herself as she quitted Paula's room; but perhaps this  woman, who had much that was good in her, might have felt some ruth, if  in the course of the next few hours she could but have looked into the  heart of the orphan entrusted to her protection. Only once did Paula  sob aloud; then she indignantly dried her tears, and sat for a long time  gazing at the floor, shaking her pretty head again and again as though  something unheard-of and incredible had befallen her.    At last, with a bitter sigh, she went to bed; and while she vainly  strove for sleep, and for strength to pray and be silently resigned,  Time seemed to her a wild-beast chase, Fate a relentless hunter, and the  quarry he was pursuing was herself.          CHAPTER IV.    On the following evening Haschim, the merchant, came to the governor's  house with a small part of his caravan. A stranger might have taken  the mansion for the home of a wealthy country-gentleman rather than the  official residence of a high official; for at this hour, after sunset,  large herds of beasts and sheep were being driven into the vast  court-yard behind the house, surrounded on three sides by out-buildings;  half a hundred horses of choice breed came, tied in couples, from  the watering-place; and in a well-sanded paddock enclosed by hurdles,  slaves, brown and black, were bringing fodder to a large troop of  camels.    The house itself was well-fitted by its unusually palatial size and  antique splendor to be the residence of the emperor's viceroy, and the  Mukaukas, to whom it all belonged, had in fact held the office for a  long time. After the conquest of the country by the Arabs they had left  him in possession, and at the present date he managed the affairs of  his Egyptian fellow-countrymen, no more in the name of the emperor at  Byzantium, but under the authority of the Khaliff at Medina and his  great general, Amru. The Moslem conquerors had found him a ready and  judicious mediator; while his fellow-Christians and country-men obeyed  him as being the noblest and wealthiest of their race and the descendant  of ancestors who had enjoyed high distinction even under the Pharaohs.    Only the governor's residence was Greek--or rather Alexandrian-in style;  the court-yards and out-buildings on the contrary, looked as though  they belonged to some Oriental magnate-to some Erpaha (or prince of a  province) as the Mukaukas' forefathers had been called, a rank which  commanded respect both at court and among the populace.    The dragoman had not told the merchant too much beforehand of the  governor's possessions: he had vast estates, in both Upper and Lower  Egypt, tilled by thousands of slaves under numerous overseers. Here in  Memphis was the centre of administration of his property, and besides  the offices for his private affairs were those he needed as a state  official.    Well-kept quays, and the wide road running along the harbor side,  divided his large domain from the river, and a street ran along the wall  which enclosed it on the north. On this side was the great gate, always  wide open by day, by which servants or persons on business-errands  made their entrance; the other gate, a handsome portal with Corinthian  columns opening from the Nile-quay, was that by which the waterparty had  returned the evening before. This was kept closed, and only opened  for the family, or for guests and distinguished visitors. There was  a guardhouse at the north gate with a small detachment of Egyptian  soldiers, who were entrusted with the protection of the Mukaukas'  person.    As soon as the refreshing evening breeze came up from the river after  the heat of the day there was a stir in the great court-yard. Men, women  and girls came trooping out of the retainers' dwellings to breathe the  cooler air. Waiting-maids and slaves dipped for water into enormous  earthen vessels and carried it away in graceful jars; the free-men of  the household rested in groups after the fatigues of the day, chatting,  playing and singing. From the slaves' quarters in another court-yard  came confused sounds of singing hymns, with the shrill tones of the  double pipe and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/560"],[0,"Mr. Standfast (#6)"],[1,"a conscientious objector who had refused to do any sort of work  whatever, and had got quodded for his pains. They were immensely proud  of him and used to relate his sufferings in Dartmoor with a gusto which  I thought rather heartless. Art was their great subject, and I am  afraid they found me pretty heavy going. It was their fashion never to  admire anything that was obviously beautiful, like a sunset or a pretty  woman, but to find surprising loveliness in things which I thought  hideous. Also they talked a language that was beyond me. This kind of  conversation used to happen.--MISS WEEKES: 'Don't you admire Ursula  Jimson?' SELF: 'Rather!' MISS W.: 'She is so John-esque in her lines.'  SELF: 'Exactly!' MISS W.: 'And Tancred, too--he is so full of nuances.'  SELF: 'Rather!' MISS W.: 'He suggests one of Degousse's countrymen.'  SELF: 'Exactly!'    They hadn't much use for books, except some Russian ones, and I  acquired merit in their eyes for having read Leprous Souls. If you  talked to them about that divine countryside, you found they didn't  give a rap for it and had never been a mile beyond the village. But  they admired greatly the sombre effect of a train going into Marylebone  station on a rainy day.    But it was the men who interested me most. Aronson, the novelist,  proved on acquaintance the worst kind of blighter. He considered  himself a genius whom it was the duty of the country to support, and he  sponged on his wretched relatives and anyone who would lend him money.  He was always babbling about his sins, and pretty squalid they were. I  should like to have flung him among a few good old-fashioned  full-blooded sinners of my acquaintance; they would have scared him  considerably. He told me that he sought 'reality' and 'life' and  'truth', but it was hard to see how he could know much about them, for  he spent half the day in bed smoking cheap cigarettes, and the rest  sunning himself in the admiration of half-witted girls. The creature  was tuberculous in mind and body, and the only novel of his I read,  pretty well turned my stomach. Mr Aronson's strong point was jokes  about the war. If he heard of any acquaintance who had joined up or was  even doing war work his merriment knew no bounds. My fingers used to  itch to box the little wretch's ears.    Letchford was a different pair of shoes. He was some kind of a man, to  begin with, and had an excellent brain and the worst manners  conceivable. He contradicted everything you said, and looked out for an  argument as other people look for their dinner. He was a  double-engined, high-speed pacificist, because he was the kind of  cantankerous fellow who must always be in a minority. If Britain had  stood out of the war he would have been a raving militarist, but since  she was in it he had got to find reasons why she was wrong. And jolly  good reasons they were, too. I couldn't have met his arguments if I had  wanted to, so I sat docilely at his feet. The world was all crooked for  Letchford, and God had created him with two left hands. But the fellow  had merits. He had a couple of jolly children whom he adored, and he  would walk miles with me on a Sunday, and spout poetry about the beauty  and greatness of England. He was forty-five; if he had been thirty and  in my battalion I could have made a soldier out of him.    There were dozens more whose names I have forgotten, but they had one  common characteristic. They were puffed up with spiritual pride, and I  used to amuse myself with finding their originals in the _Pilgrim's  Progress_. When I tried to judge them by the standard of old Peter,  they fell woefully short. They shut out the war from their lives, some  out of funk, some out of pure levity of mind, and some because they  were really convinced that the thing was all wrong. I think I grew  rather popular in my role of the seeker after truth, the honest  colonial who was against the war by instinct and was looking for  instruction in the matter. They regarded me as a convert from an alien  world of action which they secretly dreaded, though they affected to  despise it. Anyhow they talked to me very freely, and before long I had  all the pacifist arguments by heart. I made out that there were three  schools. One objected to war altogether, and this had few adherents  except Aronson and Weekes, C.O., now languishing in Dartmoor. The  second thought that the Allies' cause was tainted, and that Britain had  contributed as much as Germany to the catastrophe. This included all  the adherents of the L.D.A.--or League of Democrats against  Aggression--a very proud body. The third and much the largest, which  embraced everybody else, held that we had fought long enough and that  the business could now be settled by negotiation, since Germany had  learned her lesson. I was myself a modest member of the last school,  but I was gradually working my way up to the second, and I hoped with  luck to qualify for the first. My acquaintances approved my progress.  Letchford said I had a core of fanaticism in my slow nature, and that I  would end by waving the red flag.    Spiritual pride and vanity, as I have said, were at the bottom of most  of them, and, try as I might, I could find nothing very dangerous in it  all. This vexed me, for I began to wonder if the mission which I had  embarked on so solemnly were not going to be a fiasco. Sometimes they  worried me beyond endurance. When the news of Messines came nobody took  the slightest interest, while I was aching to tooth every detail of the  great fight. And when they talked on military affairs, as Letchford and  others did sometimes, it was difficult to keep from sending them all to  the devil, for their amateur cocksureness would have riled Job. One had  got to batten down the recollection of our fellows out there who were  sweating blood to keep these fools snug. Yet I found it impossible to  be angry with them for long, they were so babyishly innocent. Indeed, I  couldn't help liking them, and finding a sort of quality in them. I had  spent three years among soldiers, and the British regular, great follow  that he is, has his faults. His discipline makes him in a funk of  red-tape and any kind of superior authority. Now these people were  quite honest and in a perverted way courageous. Letchford was, at any  rate. I could no more have done what he did and got hunted off  platforms by the crowd and hooted at by women in the streets than I  could have written his leading articles.    All the same I was rather low about my job. Barring the episode of the  ransacking of my effects the first night, I had not a suspicion of a  clue or a hint of any mystery. The place and the people were as open  and bright as a Y.M.C.A. hut. But one day I got a solid wad of comfort.  In a corner of Letchford's paper, the _Critic_, I found a letter which  was one of the steepest pieces of invective I had ever met with. The  writer gave tongue like a beagle pup about the prostitution, as he  called it, of American republicanism to the vices of European  aristocracies. He declared that Senator La Follette was a  much-misunderstood patriot, seeing that he alone spoke for the toiling  millions who had no other friend. He was mad with President Wilson, and  he prophesied a great awakening when Uncle Sam got up against John Bull  in Europe and found out the kind of standpatter he was. The letter was  signed 'John S. Blenkiron' and dated 'London, 3 July'.    The thought that Blenkiron was in England put a new complexion on my  business. I reckoned I would see him soon, for he wasn't the man to  stand still in his tracks. He had taken up the role he had played  before he left in December 1915, and very right too, for not more than  half a dozen people knew of the Erzerum affair, and to the British  public he was only the man who had been fired out of the Savoy for  talking treason. I had felt a bit lonely before, but now somewhere  within the four corners of the island the best companion God ever made  was writing nonsense with his tongue in his old cheek.    There was an institution in Biggleswick which deserves mention. On the  south of the common, near the station, stood a red-brick building  called the Moot Hall, which was a kind of church for the very undevout  population. Undevout in the ordinary sense, I mean, for I had already  counted twenty-seven varieties of religious conviction, including three  Buddhists, a Celestial Hierarch, five Latter-day Saints, and about ten  varieties of Mystic whose names I could never remember. The hall had  been the gift of the publisher I have spoken of, and twice a week it  was used for lectures and debates. The place was managed by a committee  and was surprisingly popular, for it gave all the bubbling intellects a  chance of airing their views. When you asked where somebody was and  were told he was 'at Moot,' the answer was spoken in the respectful  tone in which you would mention a sacrament.    I went there regularly and got my mind broadened to cracking point. We  had all the stars of the New Movements. We had Doctor Chirk, who  lectured on 'God', which, as far as I could make out, was a new name he  had invented for himself. There was a woman, a terrible woman, who had  come back from Russia with what she called a 'message of healing'. And  to my joy, one night there was a great buck nigger who had a lot to say  about 'Africa for the Africans'. I had a few words with him in Sesutu  afterwards, and rather spoiled his visit. Some of the people were  extraordinarily good, especially one jolly old fellow who talked about  English folk songs and dances, and wanted us to set up a Maypole. In  the debates which generally followed I began to join, very coyly at  first, but presently with some confidence. If my time at Biggleswick  did nothing else it taught me to argue on my feet.    The first big effort I made was on a full-dress occasion, when  Launcelot Wake came down to"]]]
