Disheartened at his unpropitious  reception, he was about to leave a city where he could see no prospect  of making an opening. In this spirit he called on Mr. Taylor to say  farewell.    Mr Taylor's turning shop adjoined his house, and it was here that  Elder Pratt found him. While talking to him, valise in hand ready to  depart, a Mrs. Walton called on Mrs. Taylor in the adjoining room. The  latter told Mrs. Walton about Elder Pratt and his strange mission, and  how, failing to get an opportunity to preach, he was on the eve of  departing. \"He may be a man of God,\" said Leonora, \"I am sorry to have  him depart.\"    At this Mrs. Walton expressed her willingness to open her house for  Elder Pratt to preach in, and proposed to lodge and feed him. Here at  last was an opening. He began holding meetings at Mrs. Walton's, and  was soon afterwards introduced to the investigation meetings held by  Mr. Taylor and his religious friends.    They were delighted with his preaching. He taught them faith in God,  and in Jesus Christ; called upon them to repent of their sins, and to  be baptized in the likeness of Christ's burial, for the remission of  them, and promised them the Holy Ghost through the laying on of hands,  together with a full enjoyment of all its gifts and blessings. All  this, and much more that he taught, was in strict harmony with what  they themselves believed; but what he had to say about Joseph Smith and  the Book of Mormon perplexed a great many, and some of their members  even refused to investigate the Book of Mormon, or examine the claims  of Apostle Pratt to having divine authority to preach the gospel and  administer in the ordinances thereof.    It was at this juncture that the noble independence and boldness of  spirit, so conspicuous in John Taylor throughout his life, asserted  itself. He addressed the assembly to the following effect:    \"We are here, ostensibly in search of truth. Hitherto we have fully  investigated other creeds and doctrines and proven them false. Why  should we fear to investigate Mormonism? This gentleman, Mr. Pratt, has  brought to us many doctrines that correspond with our own views. We  have endured a great deal and made many sacrifices for our religious  convictions. We have prayed to God to send us a messenger, if He has  a true Church on earth. Mr. Pratt has come to us under circumstances  that are peculiar; and there is one thing that commends him to our  consideration; he has come amongst us without purse or scrip, as the  ancient apostles traveled; and none of us are able to refute his  doctrine by scripture or logic. I desire to investigate his doctrines  and claims to authority, and shall be very glad if some of my friends  will unite with me in this investigation. But if no one will unite with  me, be assured I shall make the investigation alone. If I find his  religion true, I shall accept it, no matter what the consequences may  be; and if false, then I shall expose it.\"    After this, John Taylor began the investigation of Mormonism in  earnest. He wrote down eight sermons which Apostle Pratt preached, and  compared them with the scripture. He also investigated the evidences  of the divine authenticity of the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and  Covenants. \"I made a regular business of it for three weeks,\" he says,  \"and followed Brother Parley from place to place.\" The result of his  thorough investigation was conviction; and on the 9th of May, 1836,  himself and wife were baptized. \"I have never doubted any principle  of Mormonism since,\" was the comment he made in relating, when well  advanced in life, how he came to accept the gospel.

ORDINATION--APPOINTED TO PRESIDE--VISIT TO KIRTLAND--MEETS THE  PROPHET--DEFENDS HIM--ARRIVAL OF AN IMPOSTER--EXPOSED BY THE  PROPHET--SPREAD OF THE WORK--A PROPHECY AND ITS FULFILLMENT--THE WORK  SPREADS INTO ENGLAND.    Shortly after his baptism, John Taylor was ordained an Elder in the  Church, and began his labors in the ministry. He was now preaching the  gospel in America in fulfillment of the revelation he received in his  youth.    So rapidly did the work spread in Canada, that Apostles Orson Hyde and  Orson Pratt were sent to assist Parley. The country was excited on the  subject of \"Mormonism,\" and the ministers alarmed. Public discussions  were frequent and the truth everywhere triumphed. All through the  summer of 1836, Elder Taylor was actively engaged in the ministry; and  when in the autumn the apostles departed for Kirtland, he was appointed  to preside over the churches they had founded.    In March of the following year, Elder Taylor visited Kirtland, and  there met the Prophet Joseph Smith, who entertained him at his house  and gave him many items of information pertaining to the work of the  Lord in this dispensation. At that time there was a bitter spirit of  apostasy rife in Kirtland. A number in the quorum of the Twelve were  disaffected towards the Prophet, and the Church seemed on the point  of disintegration. Among others, Parley P. Pratt was floundering in  darkness, and coming to Elder Taylor told him of some things wherein  he considered the Prophet Joseph in error. To his remarks Elder Taylor  replied:    \"I am surprised to hear you speak so, Brother Parley. Before you left  Canada you bore a strong testimony to Joseph Smith being a Prophet of  God, and to the truth of the work he has inaugurated; and you said you  knew these things by revelation, and the gift of the Holy Ghost. You  gave to me a strict charge to the effect that though you or an angel  from heaven was to declare anything else I was not to believe it.  Now Brother Parley, it is not man that I am following, but the Lord.  The principles you taught me led me to Him, and I now have the same  testimony that you then rejoiced in. If the work was true six months  ago, it is true today; if Joseph Smith was then a prophet, he is now a  prophet.\"    To the honor of Parley, be it said, he sought no further to lead Elder  Taylor astray; nor did he use much argument in the first place. \"He  with many others,\" says Elder Taylor, \"were passing under a dark cloud;  he soon made all right with the Prophet Joseph, and was restored to  full fellowship.\"    It was about this time that Elder Taylor first came prominently before  the Church. The apostates met frequently in the temple, and on one of  these occasions, on a Sunday--the Prophet Joseph was absent--Warren  Parrish made a violent attack upon the character of the Prophet, which  was warmly sustained by many of those present. Towards the close of the  meeting, Elder Taylor asked the privilege of speaking. It was granted  him. He referred, in opening his remarks, to the ancient Israelites,  and to their murmurings against God and Moses, and then asked:    \"From whence do we get our intelligence, and knowledge of the laws,  ordinances and doctrines of the kingdom of God? Who understood even the  first principles of the doctrines of Christ? Who in the Christian world  taught them? If we, with our learning and intelligence, could not find  out the first principles, which was the case with myself and millions  of others, how can we find out the mysteries of the kingdom? It was  Joseph Smith, under the Almighty, who developed the first principles,  and to him we must look for further instructions. If the spirit which  he manifests does not bring blessings, I am very much afraid that the  one manifested by those who have spoken, will not be very likely to  secure them. The children of Israel, formerly, after seeing the power  of God manifested in their midst, fell into rebellion and idolatry, and  there is certainly very great danger of us doing the same thing.\"    While the apostates were neither convinced nor silenced by the remarks  of Elder Taylor, the faithful Saints were strengthened, and saw in that  fearless defender of the prophet, a champion of innocence and truth.  While on his part, in commenting on this circumstance, Elder Taylor  remarks: \"I was pained on the one hand to witness the hard feelings and  severe expressions of apostates; while on the other, I rejoiced to see  the firmness, faith, integrity and joy of the faithful.\"    Elder Taylor returned to Canada in company with Isaac Russell and  others. Being detained in Queenstown on Sunday, the brethren determined  to hold meeting. Before seeking for a place to preach in, at the  suggestion of Elder Taylor, the party repaired to a secluded spot under  a high cliff, just below Niagara Falls. While engaged in prayer, there,  within hearing of the mighty cataract, Elder Taylor spoke in tongues  for the first time. Comforted by this manifestation of the power of God  which was with them, the party, full of joy, re-entered Queenstown,  secured a place to meet in, and Elder Taylor preached. Next day they  continued their journey and arrived at Toronto.    Not long after Elder Taylor's return to Canada, Doctor Sampson Avard,  a high priest, presented himself in Toronto, and by virtue of an  appointment signed by his quorum, claimed the right to preside over  the churches in that district. Elder Taylor was absent from Toronto  when Avard arrived, but that officious person at once assumed the  responsibility of presiding; and boasted of his great power, and  what marvelous things he intended to accomplish. Elder Taylor had  been cautioned by the apostles, before their departure, not to allow  any person to take his place, unless he came commissioned by proper  authority. But when on his return Avard showed his authority from the  high priest's quorum, Elder Taylor thought that sufficient, gave up his  presidency and went into Whitby County to preach.    It was in August of that year, 1837, that the Prophet Joseph,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4532"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Photo Telephone or the Picture That Saved a Fortune (#6)"],[1,"en?\"    \"Oh, Shallock Peters, with his big red boat, ran into us!\" said  Ned, sharply.    \"Ha, Peters; eh?\" exclaimed the boatman. \"That's the second craft  he's damaged inside a week with his speed mania. There's Bert  Johnson's little speeder over there,\" and he pointed to one over  which some men were working. \"Had to put a whole new stern in her,  and what do you think that man Peters did?\"    \"What?\" asked Tom, as he bent down to see how much damage his  craft had sustained.    \"He wouldn't pay young Johnson a cent of money for the repairs,\"  went on Mr. Houston, the boatman. \"It was all Peters's fault,  too.\"    \"Couldn't he make him pay?\" asked Tom.    \"Well, young Johnson asked for it--no more than right, too; but  Peters only sneered and laughed at him.\"    \"Why didn't he sue?\" asked Ned.    \"Costs too much money to hire lawyers, I reckon. So he played you  the same trick; eh, Tom?\"    \"Pretty much, yes. But he won't get off so easily, I can tell you  that!\" and there was a grim and determined look on the face of the  young inventor. \"How long will it take to fix my boat, Mr.  Houston?\"    \"Nigh onto two weeks, Tom. I'm terrible rushed now.\"    Tom whistled ruefully.    \"I could do it myself quicker, if I could get her back to my  shop,\" he said. \"But she'd sink on the home trip. All right, do  the best you can, Mr. Houston.\"    \"I will that, Tom.\"    The two chums walked out of the boat-repair place.    \"What are you going to do, Tom?\" asked Ned, as they strolled  along.    \"Well, since we can't go motor boating, I guess I may as well go  back and see if that new supply of selenium has come. I do want to  get my photo telephone working, Ned.\"    \"And that's all the outing you're going to take--less than an  hour!\" exclaimed Ned, reproachfully.    \"Oh, well, all you wanted to do was to get me out of a rut, as you  called it,\" laughed Tom. \"And you've done it--you and Mr. Peters  together. It jolted up my brain, and I guess I can think better  now. Come on back and watch me tinker away, Ned.\"    \"Not much! I'm going to stay out and get some fresh air while I  can. You'd better, too.\"    \"I will, later.\"    So Tom turned back to his workshop, and Ned strolled on into the  country, for his day's work at the bank was over. And for some  time after that--until far into the night--Tom Swift worked at the  knotty problem of the photo telephone.    But the young inventor was baffled. Try as he might, he could not  get the image to show on the metal plate, nor could he get any  results by using a regular photographic plate, and developing it  afterward.    \"There is something wrong with the transmission of the light waves  over the wire,\" Tom confessed to his father.    \"You'll never do it, Tom,\" said the aged inventor. \"You are only  wasting a whole lot of time.\"    \"Well, as I haven't anything else to do now, it isn't much loss,\"  spoke Tom, ruefully. \"But I'm going to make this work, Dad!\"    \"All right, son. It's up to you. Only I tell you it can't be  done.\"    Tom, himself, was almost ready to admit this, when, a week later,  he seemed to be no nearer a solution of the problem than he was at  first. He had tried everything he could think of, and he had  Eradicate and Koku, the giant, almost distracted, by making them  stay in small telephone booths for hours at a time, while the  young inventor tried to get some reflection of one face or the  other to come over the wire.    Koku finally got so nervous over the matter, that he flatly  refused to \"pose\" any longer, so Tom was forced to use Eradicate.  As for that elderly man of all work, after many trials, all  unsuccessful, he remarked:    \"Massa Tom, I reckon I knows what's wrong.\"    \"Yes, Rad? Well, what is it?\"    \"Mah face am too black--dat's de trouble. You done want a  white-complected gen'man to stand in dat booth an' look at dat lookin'  glass plate. I'se too black! I suah is!\"    \"No, that isn't it, Rad,\" laughed Tom, hopelessly. \"If the thing  works at all it will send a black man's face over the wire as well  as a white man's. I guess the truth of it is that you're like  Koku. You're getting tired. I don't know as I blame you. I'm  getting a bit weary myself. I'm going to take a rest. I'll send  for another kind of selenium crystals I've heard of, and we'll try  them. In the meanwhile--I'll take a little vacation.\"    \"Get out my small airship, Rad, and I'll take a little flight.\"    \"Dat's de way to talk, Massa Tom,\" was the glad rejoinder.    \"I'm going over to see Mr. Damon, Father,\" announced Tom to Mr.  Swift a little later, when his speedy monoplane was waiting for  him. \"I haven't seen him in some time, and I'd like to get at the  truth of what Mr. Halling said about Mr. Damon's fortune being in  danger. I'll be back soon.\"    \"All right, Tom. And say--\"    \"Yes, Dad, what is it?\" asked Tom, as he paused in the act of  getting in the seat.    \"If he wants any ready cash, you know we've got plenty.\"    \"Oh, sure. I was going to tell him we'd help him out.\"    Then, as Koku spun the propeller blades, Tom grasped the steering  wheel, and, tilting the elevating rudder, he was soon soaring into  the air, he and his craft becoming smaller and smaller as they  were lost to sight in the distance, while the rattle and roar of  the powerful motor became fainter.    In a comparatively short time Tom had made a successful landing in  the big yard in front of Mr. Damon's house, and, walking up the  path, kept a lookout for his friend.    \"I wonder why he didn't come out to meet me?\" mused Tom, for  usually when the eccentric man heard the throbbing of Tom's motor,  he was out waiting for the young inventor. But this time it was  not the case.    \"Is Mr. Damon in?\" Tom asked of the maid who answered his ring.    \"Yes, Mr. Swift. You'll find him in the library,\" and she ushered  him in.    \"Oh, hello, Tom,\" greeted Mr. Damon, but the tone was so listless,  and his friend's manner so gloomy that the young inventor was  quite embarrassed.    \"Have a chair,\" went on Mr. Damon. \"I'll talk to you in a minute,  Tom. I've got to finish this letter, and it's a hard one to write,  let me tell you.\"    Now Tom was more astonished than ever. Not once had Mr. Damon  \"blessed,\" anything, and when this did not happen Tom was sure  something was wrong. He waited until his friend had sealed the  letter, and turned to him with a sigh. Then Tom said boldly:    \"Mr. Damon, is it true that you're having hard luck--in money  matters?\"    \"Why, yes, Tom, I'm afraid I am,\" was the quick answer. \"But who  told you?\"    \"Grant Halling. He was over to get me to fix his airship,\" and Tom  briefly related what had happened.    \"Oh, yes, I did mention the matter to him,\" went on Mr. Damon, and  his tone was still listless. \"So he told you; did he? Well,  matters aren't any better, Tom. In fact, they're worse. I just had  to write to a man who was asking for help, and I had to refuse  him, though he needs it very much. The truth is I hadn't the  money. Tom, I'm afraid I'm going to be a very poor man soon.\"    \"Impossible, Mr. Damon! Why, I thought your investments--\"    \"I've made some bad ones of late, Tom. I've been pretty foolish,  I'm afraid. I drew out some money I had in government bonds, and  invested in certain stocks sold by a Mr. Shallock Peters.\"    \"Shallock Peters!\" cried Tom, almost jumping out of his chair.  \"Why, I know him--I mean I've met him.\"    \"Have you, Tom? Well, then, all I've got to say is to steer clear  of him, my boy. Don't have anything to do with him,\" and, with  something of a return of his usual energy Mr. Damon banged his  fist down on his desk. \"Give him a wide berth, Tom, and if you see  him coming, turn your back. He'd talk a miser into giving him his  last cent. Keep away from Shallock Peters, Tom. Bless my necktie,  he's a scoundrel, that's what he is!\" and again Mr. Damon banged  his desk forcibly.            CHAPTER VII    SOFT WORDS      \"Well, I'm glad of one thing!\" exclaimed Tom, when the ink bottle  and the paper cutter on Mr. Damon's desk had ceased rattling,  because of the violence of the blow. \"I'm glad of one thing.\"    \"What's that, Tom?\" asked his friend.    \"I heard you bless something at last--the first time since I came  in.\"    \"Oh!\" and Mr. Damon laughed. \"Well, Tom, I haven't been blessing  things lately--that's a fact. I haven't had the heart for it.  There are too many business complications. I wish I'd never met  this Peters.\"    \"So do I,\" said Tom. \"My motor boat would not have been damaged  then.\"    \"Did he do that, Tom?\"    \"He certainly did, and then he accused me of being at fault.\"    \"That would be just like him. Tell me about it, Tom.\"    When the young inventor finished the story of the collision Mr.  Damon sat silent for a moment. Then he remarked slowly:    \"That's just like Peters. A big bluff--that's what he is. I wish  I'd discovered that fact sooner--I'd be money in pocket. But I  allowed myself to be deceived by his talk about big profits. At  first he seemed like a smart business man, and he certainly had  fine recommendations. But I am inclined to believe, now, that the  recommendations were forged.\"    \"What did he do to you, Mr. Damon?\" asked Tom, with ready  sympathy.    \"It's too complicated to go into details over, Tom, but to make a  long story short, he got me to invest nearly all my fortune in  some enterprises that, I fear, are doomed to failure. And if they  do fail, I'll be a ruined man.\"    \"No, you won't!\" exclaimed Tom. \"That's one reason why I came here  to-day. Father told me to offer you all the ready money you needed  to get out of your trouble. How much do you need, Mr. Damon?\"    \"Bless my collar button! That's like your father, Tom,\" and now  Mr. Damon seemed more like his old self. \"Bless my shoes, a man  never knows who his real friends are until trouble comes. I can't  say how I thank you and your father, Tom. But I'm not going to  take advantage of him.\"    \"It wouldn't be"]]]
