No high  effort of mind could be born amid such circumstances. A stage without  authors soon ceases to have actors. When actors and authors both are  wanting an audience will not easily be found. Thus it was, thus it had  been in Italy through many troubled years. The opera,--the seductive,  but enervating opera,--carried to great perfection by Metastasio, was  almost alone in possession of the popular taste.... Alfieri's first  thought was to improve the taste of his countrymen, by blending the  amusement they were accustomed to with something better.... Instead of  attempting reform by easy stages, he determined to attempt everything at  once.... It was something more than an improvement of the stage that he  attempted; it was the improvement of his countrymen; the regeneration of  his country!... Throughout nearly all his tragedies and his prose works,  the leading idea by which he was animated stood plainly out. Several  pieces he specially calls tragedies of liberty. They well deserve the  name. He never tired in his denunciations of tyranny, in his invectives  against oppression. These were themes upon which the more he spoke, the  more eloquent he became.\"    The dramas themselves, built in strict accordance with the three  unities of classic taste, may seem strangely stiff and unemotional  to us, but they carried an immense appeal to the Italian of the last  century. They spoke a new voice and stirred a new spirit in their  hearers. The voice once heard, the spirit once born, the new idea grew  rapidly. Within a few years after Alfieri's death eighteen editions of  his works had passed through the press. Two great theaters, one at Milan  and one at Bologna, were built by men eager to present his tragedies.  The influence of his writings was tremendous; the minds of Italians from  Piedmont to Sicily were stirred to a higher pitch than they had been for  many centuries.    Alfieri's character had many defects, at best his life was unmoral,  but having regard to the society into which he was born and the  early training he received, more was scarcely to be looked for. He  was passionate, reckless, and untutored in all self-control, yet he  harnessed himself to a work which possessed his fancy and in its service  became the devotee of study and control. Like his life his writings  lack peace and broad philosophy, but on the other hand they gain from  his peculiar nature a certain domineering force. Giuseppe Arnaud in his  criticism on the patriotic poets of Italy says, \"Whoever should say that  Alfieri's tragedies, in spite of many eminent merits, were constructed  on a theory opposed to grand scenic effects and to one of the two bases  of tragedy, namely, compassion, would certainly not say what was far  from the truth. And yet, with all this, Alfieri will still remain the  dry, harsh blast which swept away the noxious miasmas with which the  Italian air was infected. He will still remain that poet who aroused  his country from its dishonorable slumber, and inspired its heart with  intolerance of servile conditions and with regard for its dignity. Up to  this time we had bleated and he roared.\"    Let me only add the striking words of his fellow countryman, the gifted  poet-statesman Massimo d'Azeglio. \"In fact,\" he wrote, \"one of the  merits of that proud heart was to have found Italy Metastasian and left  it Alfierian; and his first and greatest merit was, to my thinking, that  he discovered Italy, so to speak, as Columbus discovered America, and  initiated the idea of Italy as a nation. I place this merit far beyond  that of his verses and his tragedies.\"    Alfieri reminded Italians that they had a native voice.          [Illustration: MANZONI]          MANZONI, THE MAN OF LETTERS      The position of Manzoni in modern Italian life and literature is  doubly interesting, both because his work in poetry and the drama  marks the vital turning point in the historic battle of Classicism  with Romanticism, and because his romance \"I Promessi Sposi\" is the  greatest achievement in all Italian letters in the field of the novel.  Walter Scott gave the country north of Tweed a history in the \"Waverley  Novels,\" and Alessandro Manzoni's writing a little later, at a time  when Scott's work was a great factor in European literature, gave Italy  a history in the same sense. The inestimable service that the Waverley  Novels did Scotland \"I Promessi Sposi\" did the disrupted states of Italy.    The spirit of the French Revolution was all-engrossing, as subversive of  the old religions, philosophies, and literatures, as it was of the old  politics. It represented the actual thoughts of the men of that era, but  it developed so rapidly and fell into such excesses that its downfall  was sudden and complete. Then the reaction set in, which, as De Sanctis  in his history of the movement says, was \"as rapid and violent as the  revolution.... The white terror succeeded to the red.\"    The same critic goes on to show that there were at this period two  great philosophic principles, materialism and skepticism, and that  in opposition to them there rose a spirituality which was carried to  the heights of idealism. This spirituality approached the mysticism  of mediaeval days. \"To the right of nature,\" he says, \"was opposed the  divine right, to popular sovereignty legitimacy, to individual rights  the State, to liberty authority and order. The middle ages returned in  triumph.... Christianity, hitherto the target of all offense, became the  center of every philosophical investigation, the banner of all social  and religious progress.... The criterions of art were changed. There was  a pagan art and a Christian art, where highest expression was sought in  the Gothic, in the glooms, the mysteries, the vague, the indefinite,  in a beyond which was called the ideal, in an inspiration towards the  infinite, incapable of fruition and therefore melancholy.... To Voltaire  and Rousseau succeeded Chateaubriand, De Stael, Lamartine, Victor Hugo,  Lamennais. And in 1815 appeared the Sacred Hymns of the young Manzoni.\"    This spirit of idealism became the incentive for the new school  of Romance in literature and the drama, in contrast to the drab  materialism of the Revolutionary age. This school of Romance is not,  however, to be considered as diametrically opposed to the Classical  School, for they had much in common, and the contrast between them  lay not so much in the spirit which animated them as in the strict  regard of Classicism for the time-hallowed unities of time, place, and  action, and the willingness of the Romantic School to sacrifice all  these for freedom of movement and effect. The new school wished to find  its poems in the experiences of men of that day, to write its dramas  about any comedy or tragedy without regard to their classic form, it  wished freedom to grow as its own spirit might dictate. In Germany and  England great Romanticists were ripening into power, Goethe and Burger,  Scott and Byron were being widely read in Italy, and the dramas of both  Schiller and Shakespeare were continually translated and reproduced  in Italian verse. The restoration of the Austrians and Bourbons after  the Napoleonic downfall made any chance to speak political truths  impossible, even in the half-veiled militant form used earlier by  Alfieri. The Romantic School therefore, confined in its modern scope,  turned backward, became retrospective, and sought its outlet in the  glories of that mediaeval world which had been so nearly akin in spirit  to the modern sentiment. It turned from recent atheistic tendencies to  a mood of great devotion, from lax morality to a high degree of upright  conduct, from the regard of liberty as the greatest good to that of  responsibility to mankind as the goal. Only distantly and secondarily  political, this Romantic movement was first of all moral, and taught  Italians that in order to be good citizens they must be good men first.  As in all literary history the movement had a deep philosophic meaning,  and this sense of moral responsibility was at the base of all Manzoni's  great creative efforts.    First of all, then, the literary movement which succeeded the  Revolutionary era in Italy was idealistic as compared with the  materialism of the days of the Napoleonic occupation, and secondly,  it was Romantic in contradistinction to the Classicism of the earlier  times. Greek and Roman themes for artistic expression were abandoned  for the stories of national mediaevalism, the Papacy became the center  of its poetic aspiration, and its spirit, though highly ardent, was far  more truly modern than that of Classicism had been. Our former critic,  De Sanctis, says that in this new movement religion \"is no longer a  creed, it is an artistic motive.... It is not enough that there are  saints, they must be beautiful: the Christian idea returns as art....  Providence comes back to the world, the miracle reappears in story,  hope and prayer revive, the heart softens, it opens itself to gentle  influences.... Manzoni reconstructs the ideal of the Christian Paradise  and reconciles it with the modern spirit. Mythology goes, the classic  remains; the eighteenth century is denied, its ideas prevail.\"    Manzoni stood first for that new movement which opposed morality to  license in national development, secondly for the temper which derided  the classic limits of the three unities and held that a purely national  event was as suitable for the purpose of artistic representation as  the stories of classic history. In addition to this he first adopted  that form of the Romantic spirit which was rising so rapidly into use  in England in the novels of Walter Scott, in France in the writings  of Victor Hugo and Lamennais, and in Germany in those of Goethe and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4361"],[0,"Memoirs of General William T.

At Portsmouth Mr. Stanberry took a boat up the river, and I one  down to Cincinnati.  There I found my brothers Lampson and Hoyt  employed in the \"Gazette\" printing-office, and spent much time with  them and Charles Anderson, Esq., visiting his brother Larz, Mr.  Longworth, some of his artist friends, and especially Miss Sallie  Carneal, then quite a belle, and noted for her fine voice,    On the 20th I took passage on the steamboat Manhattan for St.  Louis; reached Louisville, where Dr. Conrad, of the army, joined  me, and in the Manhattan we continued on to St. Louis, with a mixed  crowd.  We reached the Mississippi at Cairo the 23d, and St. Louis,  Friday, November 24, 1843.  At St. Louis we called on Colonel S. W.  Kearney and Major Cooper, his adjutant-general, and found my  classmate, Lieutenant McNutt, of the ordnance, stationed at the  arsenal; also Mr. Deas, an artist, and Pacificus Ord, who was  studying law.  I spent a week at St. Louis, visiting the arsenal,  Jefferson Barracks, and most places of interest, and then became  impressed with its great future.  It then contained about forty  thousand people, and my notes describe thirty-six good steamboats  receiving and discharging cargo at the levee.    I took passage December 4th in the steamer John Aull for New  Orleans.  As we passed Cairo the snow was falling, and the country  was wintery and devoid of verdure.  Gradually, however, as we  proceeded south, the green color came; grass and trees showed the  change of latitude, and when in the course of a week we had reached  New Orleans, the roses were in full bloom, the sugar-cane just  ripe, and a tropical air prevalent.  We reached New Orleans  December 11, 1843, where I spent about a week visiting the  barracks, then occupied by the Seventh Infantry; the theatres,  hotels, and all the usual places of interest of that day.    On the 16th of December I continued on to Mobile in the steamer  Fashion by way of Lake Pontchartrain; saw there most of my personal  friends, Mr. and Mrs. Bull, Judge Bragg and his brother Dunbar,  Deshon, Taylor, and Myers, etc., and on the 19th of December took  passage in the steamboat Bourbon for Montgomery, Alabama, by way of  the Alabama River.  We reached Montgomery at noon, December 23d,  and took cars at 1 p. m. for Franklin, forty miles, which we reached  at 7 p. m., thence stages for Griffin, Georgia, via La Grange and  Greenville.  This took the whole night of the 23d and the day of  the 24th.  At Griffin we took cars for Macon, and thence to  Savannah, which we reached Christmas-night, finding Lieutenants  Ridgley and Ketchum at tea, where we were soon joined by Rankin and  Beckwith.    On the 26th I took the boat for Charleston, reaching my post, and  reported for duty Wednesday morning, December 27, 1843.    I had hardly got back to my post when, on the 21st of January,  1844, I received from Lieutenant R. P. Hammond, at Marietta,  Georgia, an intimation that Colonel Churchill, Inspector-General of  the Army, had applied for me to assist him in taking depositions in  upper Georgia and Alabama; concerning certain losses by volunteers  in Florida of horses and equipments by reason of the failure of the  United States to provide sufficient forage, and for which Congress  had made an appropriation.  On the 4th of February the order came  from the Adjutant-General in Washington for me to proceed to  Marietta, Georgia, and report to Inspector-General Churchill.  I  was delayed till the 14th of February by reason of being on a  court-martial, when I was duly relieved and started by rail to  Augusta, Georgia, and as far as Madison, where I took the  mail-coach, reaching Marietta on the 17th.  There I reported for  duty to Colonel Churchill, who was already engaged on his work,  assisted by Lieutenant R. P. Hammond, Third Artillery, and a  citizen named Stockton.  The colonel had his family with him,  consisting of Mrs. Churchill, Mary, now Mrs. Professor Baird, and  Charles Churchill, then a boy of about fifteen years of age.    We all lived in a tavern, and had an office convenient.  The duty  consisted in taking individual depositions of the officers and men  who had composed two regiments and a battalion of mounted  volunteers that had served in Florida.  An oath was administered to  each man by Colonel Churchill, who then turned the claimant over to  one of us to take down and record his deposition according to  certain forms, which enabled them to be consolidated and tabulated.  We remained in Marietta about six weeks, during which time I  repeatedly rode to Kenesaw Mountain, and over the very ground where  afterward, in 1864, we had some hard battles.    After closing our business at Marietta the colonel ordered us to  transfer our operations to Bellefonte, Alabama.  As he proposed to  take his family and party by the stage, Hammond lent me his  riding-horse, which I rode to Allatoona and the Etowah River.  Hearing of certain large Indian mounds near the way, I turned to  one side to visit them, stopping a couple of days with Colonel  Lewis Tumlin, on whose plantation these mounds were.  We struck up  such an acquaintance that we corresponded for some years, and as I  passed his plantation during the war, in 1864, I inquired for him,  but he was not at home.  From Tumlin's I rode to Rome, and by way  of Wills Valley over Sand Mountain and the Raccoon Range to the  Tennessee River at Bellefonte, Alabama.  We all assembled there in  March, and continued our work for nearly two months, when, having  completed the business, Colonel Churchill, with his family, went  North by way of Nashville; Hammond, Stockton, and I returning South  on horseback, by Rome, Allatoona, Marietta, Atlanta, and Madison,  Georgia.  Stockton stopped at Marietta, where he resided.  Hammond  took the cars at Madison, and I rode alone to Augusta, Georgia,  where I left the horse and returned to Charleston and Fort Moultrie  by rail.    Thus by a mere accident I was enabled to traverse on horseback the  very ground where in after-years I had to conduct vast armies and  fight great battles.  That the knowledge thus acquired was of  infinite use to me, and consequently to the Government, I have  always felt and stated.    During the autumn of 1844, a difficulty arose among the officers of  Company B, Third Artillery (John R. Yinton's), garrisoning Augusta  Arsenal, and I was sent up from Fort Moultrie as a sort of  peace-maker.  After staying there some months, certain transfers of  officers were made, which reconciled the difficulty, and I returned  to my post, Fort Moultrie.  During that winter, 1844-'45, I was  visiting at the plantation of Mr. Poyas, on the east branch of the  Cooper, about fifty miles from Fort Moultrie, hunting deer with his  son James, and Lieutenant John F. Reynolds, Third Artillery.  We  had taken our stands, and a deer came out of the swamp near that of  Mr. James Poyas, who fired, broke the leg of the deer, which turned  back into the swamp and came out again above mine.  I could follow  his course by the cry of the hounds, which were in close pursuit.  Hastily mounting my horse, I struck across the pine-woods to head  the deer off, and when at full career my horse leaped a fallen log  and his fore-foot caught one of those hard, unyielding pineknots  that brought him with violence to the ground.  I got up as quick as  possible, and found my right arm out of place at the shoulder,  caused by the weight of the double-barrelled gun.    Seeing Reynolds at some distance, I called out lustily and brought  him to me.  He soon mended the bridle and saddle, which had been  broken by the fall, helped me on my horse, and we followed the  coarse of the hounds.  At first my arm did not pain me much, but it  soon began to ache so that it was almost unendurable.  In about  three miles we came to a negro hut, where I got off and rested till  Reynolds could overtake Poyas and bring him back.  They came at  last, but by that time the arm was so swollen and painful that I  could not ride.  They rigged up an old gig belonging to the negro,  in which I was carried six miles to the plantation of Mr. Poyas,  Sr.  A neighboring physician was sent for, who tried the usual  methods of setting the arm, but without success; each time making  the operation more painful.  At last he sent off, got a set of  double pulleys and cords, with which he succeeded in extending the  muscles and in getting the bone into place.  I then returned to  Fort Moultrie, but being disabled, applied for a short leave and  went North.    I started January 25,1845; went to Washington, Baltimore, and  Lancaster, Ohio, whence I went to Mansfield, and thence back by  Newark to Wheeling, Cumberland, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New  York, whence I sailed back for Charleston on the ship Sullivan,  reaching Fort Moultrie March 9, 1845.    About that time (March 1, 1845) Congress had, by a joint  resolution, provided for the annexation of Texas, then an  independent Republic, subject to certain conditions requiring the  acceptance of the Republic of Texas to be final and conclusive.  We  all expected war as a matter of course.  At that time General  Zachary Taylor had assembled a couple of regiments of infantry and  one of dragoons at Fort Jessup, Louisiana, and had orders to extend  military protection to Texas against the Indians, or a \"foreign  enemy,\" the moment the terms of annexation were accepted.  He  received notice of such acceptance July 7th, and forthwith  proceeded to remove his troops to Corpus Christi, Texas, where,  during the summer and fall of 1845, was assembled that force with  which, in the spring of 1846, was begun the Mexican War.    Some time during that summer came to Fort Moultrie orders for  sending Company E, Third Artillery, Lieutenant Bragg, to New  Orleans, there to receive a battery of field-"]]]
