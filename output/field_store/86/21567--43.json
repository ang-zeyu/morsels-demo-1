It scarce entered the head of a French nobleman  a generation back that the mass of the people had any feelings or  wishes, much less rights. They were useful in their way, just as  the animals are, but needed no more consideration. They have never  counted for anything.    \"In England the people have rights and liberties; they won them  years ago. It would be well for us in the present day had they  done so in France. I fancy the next generation will have to adapt  themselves to changed circumstances, and the ideas that Ernest and  Jules will learn from this English lad will be a great advantage  to them, and will fit them for the new state of things.\"    It was only during lessons, when their gouvernante was always  present, at meal times, and in the salon in the evening, that  Harry had any communication with the young ladies of the family. If  they met in the grounds they were saluted by the boys with as much  formal courtesy as if they had been the most distant acquaintances,  returning the bows with deep curtsies.    These meetings were a source of great amusement to Harry, who could  scarcely preserve his gravity at these formal and distant greetings.  On one occasion, however, the even course of these meetings was  broken. The boys had just left  the tennis-court where they had  been playing, and had laid aside the swords which they carried when  walking or riding.    The tennis-court was at some little distance from the house, and  they were walking across the garden when they heard a scream.  At  a short distance was the governess with her two young charges.  She  had thrown her arms round them, and stood the picture of terror,  uttering loud screams.    Looking round in astonishment to discover the cause of her terror,  Harry saw a large wolf-hound running towards them at a trot.  Its  tongue was hanging out, and there was a white foam on its jaws.  He  had heard M. du Tillet tell the marquis on the previous day that  this dog, which was a great favourite, seemed strange and unquiet,  and he had ordered it to be chained up. It had evidently broken  its fastening, for it was dragging a piece of chain some six feet  long behind it.      It flashed across him at once that the animal was mad, but without  an instant's hesitation he dashed off at full speed and threw himself  in front of the ladies before the dog reached them. Snatching off  his coat, and then kneeling on one knee, he awaited the animal's  attack. Without deviating from its course the hound sprang at him  with a short snarling howl. Harry threw his coat over its head and  then grasped it round the neck.    The impetus of the spring knocked him over, and they rolled together  on the ground. The animal struggled furiously, but Harry retained  his grasp round its neck. In vain the hound tried to free itself  from its blinding encumbrance, or to bite his assailant through  it, and struggled to shake off his hold with its legs and claws.  Harry maintained his grasp tightly round its neck, with his head  pressed closely against one of its ears. Several times they rolled  over and over.  At last Harry made a great effort when he was  uppermost, and managed to get his knees upon the animal's belly, and  then, digging his toes in the ground, pressed with all his weight  upon it.    There was a sound as of cracking of bones, then the dog's struggles  suddenly ceased, and his head fell over, and Harry rose to his  feet by the side of the dead hound just as a number of men, with  pitch-forks and other weapons, ran up to the spot from the stables,  while the marquis, sword in hand, arrived from the house.    The gouvernante, too, paralysed by fear, had stood close by with  her charges while the struggle was going on. Ernest had come up, and  was standing in front of his sisters, ready to be the next victim  if the dog had overpowered Harry. Less accustomed to running than  the English boy, and for a moment rooted to the ground with horror  at his sisters' danger, he had not arrived at the spot until the  struggle between Harry and the dog was half over, and had then seen  no way of rendering assistance; but believing that the dog was sure  to be the conqueror, he had placed himself before his sisters to  bear the brunt of the next assault.    Seeing at a glance that his daughters were untouched, the marquis  ran on to Harry, who was standing panting and breathless, and threw  his arms round him.    \"My brave boy,\" he exclaimed, \"you have saved my daughters from a  dreadful death by your courage and devotion. How can I and their  mother ever thank you? I saw it all from the terrace--the speed  with which you sprang to their assistance--the quickness of thought  with which you stripped off your coat and threw it over its head.  After that I could see nothing except your rolling over and over  in a confused mass. You are not hurt, I trust?\"    \"Not a bit, sir,\" Harry said.    \"And you have killed it--wonderful!\"    \"There was nothing in that, sir. I have heard my father, who is a  doctor, say that a man could kill the biggest dog if he could get  it down on its back and kneel on it. So when I once managed to get  my knees on it I felt it was all right.\"    \"Ah, it is all very well for you to speak as if it were nothing!\"  the marquis said. \"There are few men, indeed, who would throw  themselves in the way of a mad dog, especially of such a formidable  brute as that. You too have behaved with courage, my son, and I  saw you were ready to give your life for your sisters; but you had  not the quickness and readiness of your friend, and would have been  too late.\"    \"It is true, father,\" Ernest said in a tone of humility. \"I should  have been too late, and, moreover, I should have been useless, for  he would have torn me down in a moment, and then fallen upon my  sisters.  M. Sandwith,\" he said frankly, \"I own I have been wrong.  I have thought the games of which you spoke, and your fighting, rough  and barbarous; but I see their use now. You have put me to shame.  When I saw that dog I felt powerless, for I had not my sword with  me; but you--you rushed to the fight without a moment's hesitation,  trusting in your strength and your head. Yes, your customs have  made a man of you, while I am a boy still.\"    \"You are very good to say so,\" Harry said; \"but I am quite sure that  you would be just as quick and ready as me in most circumstances,  and if it had been a matter of swords, very much more useful; but I  am glad you see there is some advantage in our rough English ways.\"    The marquis had put his hand approvingly upon Ernest's shoulder  when he addressed Harry, and then turned to his daughters.  The  governess had sunk fainting to the ground when she saw that the  danger was over. Virginie had thrown herself down and was crying  loudly; while Jeanne stood pale, but quiet, beside them.    The marquis directed one of the men to run up to the chateau and  bid a female servant bring down water and smelling-salts for the  governess, and then lifted Virginie up and tried to soothe her,  while he stretched out his other hand to Jeanne.    \"You are shaken, my Jeanne,\" he said tenderly, \"but you have borne  the trial well. I did not hear you cry out, though madame, and the  little one screamed loudly enough.\"    \"I was frightened enough, father,\" she said simply, \"but of course  I wasn't going to cry out; but it was very terrible; and oh, how  noble and brave he was! And you know, papa, I feel ashamed to think  how often I have been nearly laughing because he was awkward in  the minuet. I feel so little now beside him.\"    \"You see, my dear, one must not judge too much by externals,\" her  father said soothingly as she hid her face against his coat, and he  could feel that she was trembling from head to foot. \"Older people  than you often do so, and are sorry for it afterwards; but as I am  sure that you would never allow him to see that you were amused no  harm has been done.\"    \"Shall I thank him, papa?\"    \"Yes, presently, my dear; he has just gone off with Ernest to see  them bury the dog.\"    This incident caused a considerable change in Harry's position in  the family. Previously he had been accepted in consequence of the  orders of the marquis. Although compelled to treat him as an equal  the two boys had in their hearts looked upon him as an inferior,  while the girls had regarded him as a sort of tutor of their  brothers, and thus as a creature altogether indifferent to them.  But henceforth he appeared in a different light. Ernest acted up to  the spirit of the words he had spoken at the time, and henceforth  treated him as a comrade to be respected as well as liked. He tried  to learn some of the English games, but as most of these required  more than two players he was forced to abandon them. He even asked  him to teach him to box, but Harry had the good sense to make  excuses for not doing so.  He felt that Ernest was by no means his  match in strength, and that, with all his good-will, he would find  it difficult to put up good-naturedly with being knocked about. He  therefore said that it could not be done without boxing-gloves, and  these it would be impossible to obtain in France; and that in the  next place he should hardly advise him to learn even if he procured  the gloves, for that in such contests severe bruises often were  given.    \"We think nothing of a black eye,\" he said laughing, \"but I am  sure madame your mother would not be pleased to see you so marked;  besides, your people would not understand your motive in undertaking  so rough an exercise, and you might lose somewhat of their respect.  Be content, Count Ernest; you are an excellent swordsman, and  although I am improving under M. du Tillet's tuition I shall never  be your match.

The species averages threequarters of a  pound to one pound and a half in the streams, and one pound to three  pounds in the lakes and ponds. It occurs between latitude 32-1/2 deg. and  55 deg., in the lakes and streams of the Atlantic watershed, near the  sources of a few rivers flowing into the Mississippi and the Gulf of  Mexico, and some of the southern affluents of Hudson Bay, its range  being limited by the western foothills of the Alleghanies, extending  about three hundred miles from the coast, except about the Great  Lakes, in the northern tributaries of which it abounds. It also  inhabits the headwaters of the Chattahoochee, in the southern spurs of  the Georgia Alleghanies, and tributaries of the Catawba in North  Carolina and clear waters of the great islands of the Gulf of St.  Lawrence--Anticosti, Cape Breton, Prince Edward, and Newfoundland; and  abounds in New York, Michigan, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Maine. Long  Island, Canada, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts.    My favorite rod for stream trout fishing is a cork-handled,  all-lancewood rod of three or four ounces in weight and eight feet in  length, or a rod of similar length weighing four or five ounces and  made of split bamboo--the best split bamboo of the best workmanship.  The cheap, so-called split bamboo of the dry-goods store bargain (?)  counter, retailed for a price that would not pay for the mere wrapping  of the correct article, is a flimsy, decorative thing, and would  collapse, or, worse still, bend one way and stay that way, if used on  the stream. The fly-rod material must be springy and resiliently so,  and the rod must be constructed so as to permit of this condition.    The reel I favor is a small, narrow, light, all-rubber or narrow  aluminum common-click reel, holding twenty-five yards of the  thinnest-calibered silk, waterproof-enameled line.    My leader is a brown-stained one of silk gut, twelve feet in length.  The leader should be fresh and firm, flexible and fine, not a  dried-up, brittle, unyielding, snappy snarl of the salesman's  discarded sample box that breaks at the mere touch, or releases the  flies at the first cast or parts at the first strike--if by some  miraculous mischance you get this far with it. The leaders, a  half-dozen of them, should be carried, when not in actual use, in a  flat, aluminum, pocket-fitting box between two dampened flannel mats  (though not preserved this way in close season), so as to have them  thoroughly limp from being water soaked, that you may more readily and  more safely adjust them, for break they surely will if handled in a  dry state.    The willow creel, in which the spoil of the day is deposited, should  be, I think, about the size of a small hand-satchel. To this is  fastened a leather strap, with a broad, shoulder-protecting band of  stout canvas. This I sling over the right shoulder, allowing the creel  to hang above the back part of the left hip where it will least  interfere with me during the fight with _fontinalis_.    The landing net I use is a little one of egg shape, made of cane with  no metal whatsoever, and it has a linen mesh about ten inches in width  and eighteen inches in length. The handle is a trifle over one foot  in length. To this I tie one end of a stout but light-weight flexible  and small-calibered cord, or a stretch of small rubber tube, and the  other end of this I tie to a button on my coat under my chin, throwing  the net over my left shoulder to lie on my back until called into  service.    The clothing should be of dark-gray wool of light weight. I wear a  lightly woven gray sweater under my coat when the weather is cool.    I have plenty of pockets in my trouting coat, and I make it a practice  to tie a string to nearly everything I carry in them--shears,  hook-file, knife, match-box, tobacco-pouch, pipe, purse,  field-glasses, fly-book, etc.--so that I will not mislay them  ordinarily, or drop them in the rushing current during some exciting  moment.    The headgear I like is a gray, soft felt hat of medium brim to protect  my eyes in the sun and to sit upon in the shade.    The footwear may consist of waterproof ankle shoes attached to rubber  or canvas trousers, or of a pair of light, close-fitting hip rubber  boots. Some Anglers wear rubber waterproof combined trousers and  stockings and any sort of well-soled shoes. In warm weather, I affect  nothing beyond a pair of old shoes with holes cut in both sides to let  the water run freely in and out, the holes not big enough to admit  sand and pebbles.    The artificial flies are of many hundreds of patterns. I have a  thousand or two, but half a hundred, of sizes four to six for the  lakes and ponds, and six to fourteen for the small streams, are enough  to select from during a season; two dozen are sufficient for a single  trip, half a dozen will do to carry to the stream for a day,--if you  don't lose many by whipping them off or getting them caught in a  tree,--and two are all I use for the cast, though a cast of three  flies is the favorite of many fishermen. I amuse myself by presuming  to have a special list for each month, week, day, and hour, but the  extravagantly erratic notions of the trout forbid my recommending it  to brother rodmen. Trout that show a preference for certain flies one  day may the next day favor entirely different patterns. Sometimes they  will take an imitation of the natural fly upon the water and at other  times, being gorged with the natural insect, will only strike at some  oddly colored concoction of no resemblance to any living thing in  nature; this in play, or in anger, and at other times out of pure  curiosity. An Angler doesn't need a great number of flies--if he knows  just what fly the game is taking. You can't very well determine this  half a hundred miles from the fishing; so you take a variety with you  and experiment. The flies should be of the best make and freshest  quality, tied by a practical hand--some honest maker who is himself an  Angler--not the cheap, dried-up, wall-decorative, bastard butterflies  of the ladies' dry-goods shop, that hybrid mess of gaudy waste  ribbon-silk and barnyard feather, the swindling output of the  catch-penny shopman whose sweat help do not know--upon my word--the  name or the purpose of the thing they make.    Any six of the following list will kill well enough for a single day's  pleasant fishing in any water at any time during the legal season:  Dark Coachman, Gray and Green Palmer, Ginger Palmer, Alder, Scarlet  Ibis, Abbey, Imbrie, Professor, Conroy, Reuben Wood, March Brown,  Orvis, White Miller, Coachman. Royal Coachman, Codun, Brown and Red  Palmer, Brown Hen, Queen of the Water, King of the Water. Squires,  Black Gnat, Grizzly King, Quaker.    I use, as a rule, dark colors in clear water, and on bright days and  early in the season; lighter shades in dull water and on dark days, in  the evening, and as the season grows warmer; but many Anglers  philosophize just the reverse--use light colors for early season  fishing and somber hues for midsummer play--hence the endless  arguments and experiments described as one of the charms of the craft.    I prefer, as I have said, two flies on the leader, and my favorite of  favorites for all times and all places is a cast made up of gnat-size  pattern of dark-gray wing and pale-blue body, and another of a  peculiar drab-cream shade.    In throwing or casting the fly I never \"whip\" or \"flail\" the rod, and  I never cast with a long line when a short one will answer the  purpose. Distance alone may count in a fly-casting contest, but in the  wild stream a careful short cast is more effective than a clumsy long  one.    I angle with my shadow behind me, and in casting the flies endeavor to  allow only the flies to touch the water. The line frightens the game,  and if a trout should take a fly on a loose, wavy line, he will not  hook himself and he will blow the fly from his mouth before the Angler  is able to hook him.    In learning to cast the fly, the young Angler should start with the  leader alone, as I believe all fly-fishing is begun by old and young,  and as he lifts the flies from the water after the forward cast to  make the backward motion he should simultaneously draw from the reel a  half-yard of line and allow time for the flies to complete the whole  circuit back of him. In fly-fishing the cast is not made from the  reel as in bait-casting; the line is drawn from the reel a half-yard  at a time with the left hand. The line must fully straighten itself  behind the Angler ere it can be sent out straight before him. The  flies and at most only a little part of the leader should fall lightly  upon the surface--as we imagine two insects, entangled in a delicate  cobweb, might fall from a tree branch--and be drawn smartly but gently  in little jerks a second or two in imitation of two tiny live-winged  bugs fluttering in the water; and then, as the Angler steps slowly,  firmly, but silently and softly in the current downstream, he should  repeat the lifting of the flies, the drawing off of more line from the  reel, and the circling backward cast that takes up the slack and gives  the line its forward force. Thus he should continue, deftly placing  the lure in every likely spot ahead of him in the center of the brook  and along its moss-lined, flower-decked, rock-bound or grass-fringed  banks.    The Angler is careful not to let the trout see him, see his shadow, or  see the rod, and not to let this wisest, most watchful species of all  the finny tribes hear him or feel the vibration of his body.    In hooking the trout the Angler strikes the second the fish  strikes--not by a violent arm movement, but by a mere instantaneous  nervous backward twist of the wrist, as one would instinctively draw  up his hand from the pierce of a needle point. Many trout are hooked  the instant the leader is lifted for a new cast, and many hook"]]]
