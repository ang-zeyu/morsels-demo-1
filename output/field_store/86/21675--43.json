He is the philanderer of the nations. But a man may have learnt  much about women in flirtations, and still be ignorant of first love; a  man may have known as many lands as Ulysses, and still be ignorant of  patriotism.    Mr. Rudyard Kipling has asked in a celebrated epigram what they can  know of England who know England only.  It is a far deeper and sharper  question to ask, \"What can they know of England who know only the  world?\" for the world does not include England any more than it  includes the Church.  The moment we care for anything deeply, the  world--that is, all the other miscellaneous interests--becomes our  enemy. Christians showed it when they talked of keeping one's self  \"unspotted from the world;\" but lovers talk of it just as much when  they talk of the \"world well lost.\"  Astronomically speaking, I  understand that England is situated on the world; similarly, I suppose  that the Church was a part of the world, and even the lovers  inhabitants of that orb.  But they all felt a certain truth--the truth  that the moment you love anything the world becomes your foe. Thus Mr.  Kipling does certainly know the world; he is a man of the world, with  all the narrowness that belongs to those imprisoned in that planet. He  knows England as an intelligent English gentleman knows Venice. He has  been to England a great many times; he has stopped there for long  visits.  But he does not belong to it, or to any place; and the proof  of it is this, that he thinks of England as a place. The moment we are  rooted in a place, the place vanishes. We live like a tree with the  whole strength of the universe.    The globe-trotter lives in a smaller world than the peasant. He is  always breathing, an air of locality.  London is a place, to be  compared to Chicago; Chicago is a place, to be compared to Timbuctoo.  But Timbuctoo is not a place, since there, at least, live men who  regard it as the universe, and breathe, not an air of locality, but the  winds of the world.  The man in the saloon steamer has seen all the  races of men, and he is thinking of the things that divide men--diet,  dress, decorum, rings in the nose as in Africa, or in the ears as in  Europe, blue paint among the ancients, or red paint among the modern  Britons.  The man in the cabbage field has seen nothing at all; but he  is thinking of the things that unite men--hunger and babies, and the  beauty of women, and the promise or menace of the sky.  Mr. Kipling,  with all his merits, is the globe-trotter; he has not the patience to  become part of anything. So great and genuine a man is not to be  accused of a merely cynical cosmopolitanism; still, his cosmopolitanism  is his weakness. That weakness is splendidly expressed in one of his  finest poems, \"The Sestina of the Tramp Royal,\" in which a man declares  that he can endure anything in the way of hunger or horror, but not  permanent presence in one place.  In this there is certainly danger.  The more dead and dry and dusty a thing is the more it travels about;  dust is like this and the thistle-down and the High Commissioner in  South Africa.  Fertile things are somewhat heavier, like the heavy  fruit trees on the pregnant mud of the Nile.  In the heated idleness of  youth we were all rather inclined to quarrel with the implication of  that proverb which says that a rolling stone gathers no moss.  We were  inclined to ask, \"Who wants to gather moss, except silly old ladies?\"  But for all that we begin to perceive that the proverb is right. The  rolling stone rolls echoing from rock to rock; but the rolling stone is  dead.  The moss is silent because the moss is alive.    The truth is that exploration and enlargement make the world smaller.  The telegraph and the steamboat make the world smaller. The telescope  makes the world smaller; it is only the microscope that makes it  larger.  Before long the world will be cloven with a war between the  telescopists and the microscopists. The first study large things and  live in a small world; the second study small things and live in a  large world.  It is inspiriting without doubt to whizz in a motor-car  round the earth, to feel Arabia as a whirl of sand or China as a flash  of rice-fields. But Arabia is not a whirl of sand and China is not a  flash of rice-fields. They are ancient civilizations with strange  virtues buried like treasures. If we wish to understand them it must  not be as tourists or inquirers, it must be with the loyalty of  children and the great patience of poets. To conquer these places is to  lose them.  The man standing in his own kitchen-garden, with fairyland  opening at the gate, is the man with large ideas.  His mind creates  distance; the motor-car stupidly destroys it.  Moderns think of the  earth as a globe, as something one can easily get round, the spirit of  a schoolmistress. This is shown in the odd mistake perpetually made  about Cecil Rhodes. His enemies say that he may have had large ideas,  but he was a bad man. His friends say that he may have been a bad man,  but he certainly had large ideas.  The truth is that he was not a man  essentially bad, he was a man of much geniality and many good  intentions, but a man with singularly small views.  There is nothing  large about painting the map red; it is an innocent game for children.  It is just as easy to think in continents as to think in cobble-stones.  The difficulty comes in when we seek to know the substance of either of  them. Rhodes' prophecies about the Boer resistance are an admirable  comment on how the \"large ideas\" prosper when it is not a question of  thinking in continents but of understanding a few two-legged men. And  under all this vast illusion of the cosmopolitan planet, with its  empires and its Reuter's agency, the real life of man goes on concerned  with this tree or that temple, with this harvest or that drinking-song,  totally uncomprehended, totally untouched. And it watches from its  splendid parochialism, possibly with a smile of amusement, motor-car  civilization going its triumphant way, outstripping time, consuming  space, seeing all and seeing nothing, roaring on at last to the capture  of the solar system, only to find the sun cockney and the stars  suburban.        IV.  Mr. Bernard Shaw    In the glad old days, before the rise of modern morbidities, when  genial old Ibsen filled the world with wholesome joy, and the kindly  tales of the forgotten Emile Zola kept our firesides merry and pure, it  used to be thought a disadvantage to be misunderstood. It may be  doubted whether it is always or even generally a disadvantage. The man  who is misunderstood has always this advantage over his enemies, that  they do not know his weak point or his plan of campaign. They go out  against a bird with nets and against a fish with arrows. There are  several modern examples of this situation.  Mr. Chamberlain, for  instance, is a very good one.  He constantly eludes or vanquishes his  opponents because his real powers and deficiencies are quite different  to those with which he is credited, both by friends and foes. His  friends depict him as a strenuous man of action; his opponents depict  him as a coarse man of business; when, as a fact, he is neither one nor  the other, but an admirable romantic orator and romantic actor. He has  one power which is the soul of melodrama--the power of pretending, even  when backed by a huge majority, that he has his back to the wall. For  all mobs are so far chivalrous that their heroes must make some show of  misfortune--that sort of hypocrisy is the homage that strength pays to  weakness.  He talks foolishly and yet very finely about his own city  that has never deserted him. He wears a flaming and fantastic flower,  like a decadent minor poet. As for his bluffness and toughness and  appeals to common sense, all that is, of course, simply the first trick  of rhetoric. He fronts his audiences with the venerable affectation of  Mark Antony--      \"I am no orator, as Brutus is;     But as you know me all, a plain blunt man.\"    It is the whole difference between the aim of the orator and the aim of  any other artist, such as the poet or the sculptor. The aim of the  sculptor is to convince us that he is a sculptor; the aim of the  orator, is to convince us that he is not an orator. Once let Mr.  Chamberlain be mistaken for a practical man, and his game is won.  He  has only to compose a theme on empire, and people will say that these  plain men say great things on great occasions. He has only to drift in  the large loose notions common to all artists of the second rank, and  people will say that business men have the biggest ideals after all.  All his schemes have ended in smoke; he has touched nothing that he did  not confuse. About his figure there is a Celtic pathos; like the Gaels  in Matthew Arnold's quotation, \"he went forth to battle, but he always  fell.\" He is a mountain of proposals, a mountain of failures; but still  a mountain.  And a mountain is always romantic.    There is another man in the modern world who might be called the  antithesis of Mr. Chamberlain in every point, who is also a standing  monument of the advantage of being misunderstood. Mr. Bernard Shaw is  always represented by those who disagree with him, and, I fear, also  (if such exist) by those who agree with him, as a capering humorist, a  dazzling acrobat, a quick-change artist. It is said that he cannot be  taken seriously, that he will defend anything or attack anything, that  he will do anything to startle and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47109"],[0,"Gospel Doctrine: Selections from the Sermons and Writings of Joseph F.

We talk of the \"everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ,\" which \"is the  power of God unto salvation,\" and these principles in and of themselves  are eternal principles, and will last while life, or thought, or being  last, or immortality endures.--_Oct.

A._    DEAR SISTER: The First Presidency have nothing to advance concerning  pre-existing states but that which is contained in the revelations to  the Church. The written standards of scripture show that all people  who come to this earth and are born in mortality had a pre-existent,  spiritual personality as the sons or daughters of the Eternal Father.  (See _Pearl of Great Price,_ Chap. 3, verses 5-7.) Jesus Christ was the  Firstborn. A spirit born of God is an immortal being. When the body  dies the spirit does not die. In the resurrected state the body will  be immortal as well as the spirit. Speculations as to the career of  Adam before he {15} came to the earth are of no real value. We learn  by revelation that he was Michael, the Archangel, and that he stands  at the head of his posterity on earth (_Doctrine and Covenants,_ Sec.  107:53-56.) Dogmatic assertions do not take the place of revelation,  and we should be satisfied with that which is accepted as doctrine, and  not discuss matters that, after all disputes, are merely matters of  theory.    Your brethren,    JOSEPH F. SMITH,    ANTHON H. LUND,    CHARLES W. PENROSE,    First Presidency.    --_Young Woman's Journal,_ Vol. 23, pp. 162, 163, 1912.    SPIRIT MEMORIES. (Letter written to Elder O. F. Whitney who was a  missionary in England.) I heartily endorse your sentiments respecting  congeniality of spirits. Our knowledge of persons and things before we  came here, combined with the divinity awakened within our souls through  obedience to the gospel, powerfully affects, in my opinion, all our  likes and dislikes, and guides our preferences in the course of this  life, provided we give careful heed to the admonitions of the Spirit.    All those salient truths which come home so forcibly to the head and  heart seem but the awakening of the memories of the spirit. Can we know  anything here that we did not know before we came? Are not the means of  knowledge in the first estate equal to those of this? I think that the  spirit, before and after this probation, possesses greater facilities,  aye, manifold greater, for the acquisition of knowledge, than while  manacled and shut up in the prison-house of mortality.    Had we not known before we came the necessity of our coming, the  importance of obtaining tabernacles, the glory to be achieved in  posterity, the grand object to be {16} attained by being tried  and tested--weighed in the balance, in the exercise of the divine  attributes, god-like powers and free agency with which we are endowed;  whereby, after descending below all things, Christ-like, we might  ascend above all things, and become like our Father, Mother and Elder  Brother, Almighty and Eternal!--we never would have come; that is, if  we could have stayed away.    I believe that our Savior is the ever-living example to all flesh  in all these things. He no doubt possessed a foreknowledge of all  the vicissitudes through which he would have to pass in the mortal  tabernacle, when the foundations of this earth were laid, \"when the  morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.\"  When he conversed with the brother of Jared, on the Mount, in his  spiritual body, he understood his mission, and knew the work he had to  do, as thoroughly as when he ascended from the Mount of Olives before  the wondering gaze of the Jewish disciples, with his resurrected,  glorious and immortal body.    And yet, to accomplish the ultimatum of his previous existence,  and consummate the grand and glorious object of his being, and the  salvation of his infinite brotherhood, he had to come and take upon  him flesh. He is our example. The works he did, we are commanded to  do. We are enjoined to follow him, as he followed his Head; that  where he is, we may be also; and being with him, may be like him. If  Christ knew beforehand, so did we. But in coming here, we forgot all,  that our agency might be free indeed, to choose good or evil, that  we might merit the reward of our own choice and conduct. But by the  power of the Spirit, in the redemption of Christ, through obedience,  we often catch a spark from the awakened memories of the immortal  soul, which lights up our whole being as with the glory of our former  home.--_Contributor,_ 1883, Vol. 4, pp. 114, 115.    THE IMMORTALITY OF MAN. We are called mortal beings {17} because in  us are seeds of death, but in reality we are immortal beings, because  there is also within us the germ of eternal life. Man is a dual  being, composed of the spirit which gives life, force, intelligence  and capacity to man, and the body which is the tenement of the spirit  and is suited to its form, adapted to its necessities, and acts in  harmony with it, and to its utmost capacity yields obedience to the  will of the spirit. The two combined constitute the soul. The body is  dependent upon the spirit, and the spirit during its natural occupancy  of the body is subject to the laws which apply to and govern it in the  mortal state. In this natural body are the seeds of weakness and decay,  which, when fully ripened or untimely plucked up, in the language  of scripture, is called \"the temporal death.\" The spirit is also  subject to what is termed in the scriptures and revelations from God,  \"spiritual death.\" The same as that which befell our first parents,  when, through disobedience and transgression, they became subject to  the will of Satan, and were thrust out from the presence of the Lord  and became spiritually dead, which the Lord says, \"is the first death,  even that same death which is the last death, which is spiritual,  which shall be pronounced upon the wicked when I shall say, Depart, ye  cursed!\" And the Lord further says, \"But behold, I say unto you, that I  the Lord God gave unto Adam and unto his seed that they should not die  as to the temporal death, until I the Lord God should send forth angels  to declare unto them repentance and redemption (from the first death),  through faith on the name of mine Only Begotten Son. And thus did I,  the Lord God, appoint unto man the days of his probation; that by his  natural death he might be raised in immortality unto eternal life,  even as many as would believe; and they that believe not, unto eternal  damnation, for they cannot be redeemed from their spiritual fall,  because they repent not.\" From the natural death, that is the death of  the body, and {18} also from the first death, \"which is spiritual,\"  there is redemption through belief on the name of the Only Begotten  Son, in connection with repentance and obedience to the ordinances of  the gospel, declared by holy angels, for if one \"believe,\" he must also  obey; but from the \"second death,\" even that same death which is the  first death, \"which is spiritual,\" and from which man may be redeemed  through faith and obedience, and which will again be pronounced upon  the wicked when God shall say, \"depart, ye cursed,\" there is no  redemption, so far as light on this matter has been revealed.    It is written that \"all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven  unto men\" who receive me and repent; \"but the blasphemy against the  Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven unto men.\" If men will not repent  and come unto Christ, through the ordinances of his gospel, they  cannot be redeemed from their spiritual fall, but must remain forever  subject to the will of Satan and the consequent spiritual darkness  or death unto which our first parents fell, subjecting all their  posterity thereto, and from which none can be redeemed but by belief or  faith on the name of the Only Begotten Son and obedience to the laws  of God. But, thanks be to the eternal Father, through the merciful  provisions of the gospel, all mankind will have the opportunity of  escape, or deliverance, from this spiritual death, either in time or in  eternity, for not until they are freed from the first can they become  subject unto the second death, still if they repent not \"they cannot  be redeemed from their spiritual fall,\" and will continue subject to  the will of Satan, the first spiritual death, so long as \"they repent  not, and thereby reject Christ and his gospel;\" but what of those who  do believe, repent of their sins, obey the gospel, enter into its  covenants, receive the keys of the priesthood and the knowledge of the  truth by revelation and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and afterwards turn  away wholly from that light and knowledge? They \"become {19} a law unto  themselves,\" and \"will to abide in sin;\" of such it is written, \"whoso  breaketh this covenant, after he hath received it, and altogether  turneth therefrom, shall not have forgiveness in this world nor in the  world to come.\" And again, \"Thus saith the Lord, concerning all those  who know my power, and have been made partakers thereof, and suffered  themselves, through the power of the devil, to be overcome, and to  deny the truth and defy my power--they are they who are the sons of  perdition, of whom I say that it had been better for them never to have  been born, for they are vessels of wrath, doomed to suffer the wrath of  God, with the devil and his angels in eternity; concerning whom I have  said there is no forgiveness in this world nor in the world to come,  having denied the Holy Spirit after having received it, and having  denied the Only Begotten Son of the Father--having crucified him unto  themselves, and put him to an open shame.\"--_Doc. and Cov._ 76:31-35.
