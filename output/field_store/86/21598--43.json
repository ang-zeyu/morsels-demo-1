They were almost equally impelled  to good conduct by the state of dependence on the company into which  they had been brought. Once they had subsisted and clothed themselves  from the spoils of the rivers and forest; since they had tasted of the  tree of knowledge of good and evil, they could no more return to skins  for raiment, nor to game alone for food. Blankets and flour, beads,  guns, and ammunition had become dear to their hearts: for all these  things they must love and obey the Hudson's Bay Company. Another fine  stroke of policy in the Company was to destroy the chieftain-ships in  the various tribes; thus weakening them by dividing them and preventing  dangerous coalitions of the leading spirits: for in savage as well as  civilized life, the many are governed by the few.    It may not be uninteresting in this place to give a few anecdotes of the  manner in which conflicts with the Indians were prevented, or offences  punished by the Hudson's Bay Company. In the year 1828 the ship _William  and Ann_ was cast away just inside the bar of the Columbia, under  circumstances which seemed to direct suspicion to the Indians in that  vicinity. Whether or not they had attacked the ship, not a soul was  saved from the wreck to tell how she was lost. On hearing that the ship  had gone to pieces, and that the Indians had appropriated a portion of  her cargo, Dr. McLaughlin sent a message to the chiefs, demanding  restitution of the stolen goods. Nothing was returned by the messenger  except one or two worthless articles. Immediately an armed force was  sent to the scene of the robbery with a fresh demand for the goods,  which the chiefs, in view of their spoils, thought proper to resist by  firing upon the reclaiming party. But they were not unprepared; and a  swivel was discharged to let the savages know what they might expect in  the way of firearms. The argument was conclusive, the Indians fleeing  into the woods. While making search for the goods, a portion of which  were found, a chief was observed skulking near, and cocking his gun; on  which motion one of the men fired, and he fell. This prompt action, the  justice of which the Indians well understood, and the intimidating power  of the swivel, put an end to the incipient war. Care was then taken to  impress upon their minds that they must not expect to profit by the  disasters of vessels, nor be tempted to murder white men for the sake of  plunder. The _William and Ann_ was supposed to have got aground, when  the savages seeing her situation, boarded her and murdered the crew for  the cargo which they knew her to contain. Yet as there were no positive  proofs, only such measures were taken as would deter them from a similar  attempt in future. That the lesson was not lost, was proven two years  later, when the _Isabella_, from London, struck on the bar, her crew  deserting her. In this instance no attempt was made to meddle with the  vessel's cargo; and as the crew made their way to Vancouver, the goods  were nearly all saved.    In a former voyage of the _William and Ann_ to the Columbia River, she  had been sent on an exploring expedition to the Gulf of Georgia to  discover the mouth of Frazier's River, having on board a crew of forty  men. Whenever the ship came to anchor, two sentries were kept constantly  on deck to guard against any surprise or misconduct on the part of the  Indians; so adroit, however, were they in the light-fingered art, that  every one of the eight cannon with which the ship was armed was robbed  of its ammunition, as was discovered on leaving the river! Such  incidents as these served to impress the minds of the Company's officers  and servants with the necessity of vigilance in their dealings with the  savages.    Not all their vigilance could at all times avail to prevent mischief.  When Sir George Simpson, Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, was on a  visit to Vancouver in 1829, he was made aware of this truism. The  Governor was on his return to Canada by way of the Red River Settlement,  and had reached the Dalles of the Columbia with his party. In making the  portage at this place, all the party except Dr. Tod gave their guns into  the charge of two men to prevent their being stolen by the Indians, who  crowded about, and whose well-known bad character made great care  needful. All went well, no attempt to seize either guns or other  property being made until at the end of the portage the boats had been  reloaded. As the party were about to re-embark, a simultaneous rush was  made by the Indians who had dogged their steps, to get possession of the  boats. Dr. Tod raised his gun immediately, aiming at the head chief,  who, not liking the prospect of so speedy dissolution, ordered his  followers to desist, and the party were suffered to escape. It was soon  after discovered that every gun belonging to the party in the boat had  been wet, excepting the one carried by Dr. Tod; and to the fact that the  Doctor did carry his gun, all the others owed their lives.    The great desire of the Indians for guns and ammunition led to many  stratagems which were dangerous to the possessors of the coveted  articles. Much more dangerous would it have been to have allowed them a  free supply of these things; nor could an Indian purchase from the  Company more than a stated supply, which was to be used, not for the  purposes of war, but to keep himself in game.    [Illustration: A STATION OF THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY.]    Dr. McLaughlin was himself once quite near falling into a trap of the  Indians, so cunningly laid as to puzzle even him. This was a report  brought to him by a deputation of Columbia River Indians, stating the  startling fact that the fort at Nesqually had been attacked, and every  inmate slaughtered. To this horrible story, told with every appearance  of truth, the Doctor listened with incredulity mingled with apprehension.  The Indians were closely questioned and cross-questioned, but did not  conflict in their testimony. The matter assumed a very painful aspect.  Not to be deceived, the Doctor had the unwelcome messengers committed to  custody while he could bring other witnesses from their tribe. But they  were prepared for this, and the whole tribe were as positive as those  who brought the tale. Confounded by this cloud of witnesses, Dr.  McLaughlin had almost determined upon sending an armed force to  Nesqually to inquire into the matter, and if necessary, punish the  Indians, when a detachment of men arrived from that post, and the plot  was exposed! The design of the Indians had been simply to cause a  division of the force at Vancouver, after which they believed they might  succeed in capturing and plundering the fort. Had they truly been  successful in this undertaking, every other trading-post in the country  would have been destroyed. But so long as the head-quarters of the  Company remained secure and powerful, the other stations were  comparatively safe.    An incident which has been several times related, occurred at fort  Walla-Walla, and shows how narrow escapes the interior traders sometimes  made. The hero of this anecdote was Mr. McKinlay, one of the most  estimable of the Hudson's Bay Company's officers, in charge of the fort  just named. An Indian was one day lounging about the fort, and seeing  some timbers lying in a heap that had been squared for pack saddles,  helped himself to one and commenced cutting it down into a whip handle  for his own use. To this procedure Mr. McKinlay's clerk demurred, first  telling the Indian its use, and then ordering him to resign the piece of  timber. The Indian insolently replied that the timber was his, and he  should take it. At this the clerk, with more temper than prudence,  struck the offender, knocking him over, soon after which the savage left  the fort with sullen looks boding vengeance. The next day Mr. McKinlay,  not being informed of what had taken place, was in a room of the fort  with his clerk when a considerable party of Indians began dropping  quietly in until there were fifteen or twenty of them inside the  building. The first intimation of anything wrong McKinlay received was  when he observed the clerk pointed out in a particular manner by one of  the party. He instantly comprehended the purpose of his visitors, and  with that quickness of thought which is habitual to the student of  savage nature, he rushed into the store room and returned with a powder  keg, flint and steel. By this time the unlucky clerk was struggling for  his life with his vindictive foes. Putting down the powder in their  midst and knocking out the head of the keg with a blow, McKinlay stood  over it ready to strike fire with his flint and steel. The savages  paused aghast. They knew the nature of the \"perilous stuff,\" and also  understood the trader's purpose. \"Come,\" said he with a clear,  determined voice, \"you are twenty braves against us two: now touch him  if you dare, and see who dies first.\" In a moment the fort was cleared,  and McKinlay was left to inquire the cause of what had so nearly been a  tragedy. It is hardly a subject of doubt whether or not his clerk got a  scolding. Soon after, such was the powerful influence exerted by these  gentlemen, the chief of the tribe flogged the pilfering Indian for the  offence, and McKinlay became a great brave, a \"big heart\" for his  courage.    It was indeed necessary to have courage, patience, and prudence in  dealing with the Indians. These the Hudson's Bay officers generally  possessed. Perhaps the most irascible of them all in the Columbia  District, was their chief, Dr. McLaughlin; but such was his goodness and  justice that even the savages recognized it, and he was _hyas tyee_, or  great chief, in all respects to them.

The general resemblance of this species with _Papilio Jairus_ of Fabricius  is so great, that it might pass on a cursory view as a mere variety, did  not the form of the anterior wings at once point out the difference. In the  present insect the posterior and exterior margins are of equal length,  giving a narrow appearance to the wings, much resembling some of the true  _Papilionidae_; but in _P. Jairus_, these wings are much broader, more  obtuse, and the length of the posterior margin much greater; other minor  differences exist in the colouring and markings. My valued friend A. H.  Haworth, Esq., F.L.S., &c. possesses a fine pair of the true _P. Jairus_ in  his rich and extensive collection; and the liberality with which it is  constantly and freely opened to me, deserves my warmest thanks.    From these two species I have formed the present genus, the characters of  which will distinguish it from that of _Haetera_ (Fabr.), a scanty genus  confined to South America; and this seems to occupy its place in India:  both will come in the natural family of _Hipparchidae_. Only one specimen  (a male) exists in Dr. Horsfield's collections; I could not therefore  dissect the mouth, &c. On the inner borders of the inferior wings is a  lengthened tuft of fine hairs: the _anus_ beneath has on each side an  obtuse lengthened process, partially attached, and which appears to supply  the place of the lateral valves. It is represented on a sprig of    GAERTNERA _racemosa_,    which, although differing slightly from the figure of Dr. Roxburgh's  Coromandel Plants, p. 19. t. 18, Dr. Horsfield considers as the same plant.

The stiff bristles at the corner of the mouth are nearly the length of the  bill, which is quite flattened: the tail is even, and the whole bird in  every respect but colour closely resembles the bearded Flycatcher (_Musc.  barbata_ Lath.).    Cuvier and other modern zoologists have done much in distributing the  Linnaean _Muscicapae_ into their natural families; but as we are acquainted  with a great number from descriptions only, the arrangement is by no means  perfect.    The generic characters now given of the genus _Platyrhynchos_ (very  slightly noticed by Vieillot) will be found perfectly applicable to the  separate divisions here formed; the first comprising the _Todus  Platyrhynchos_ of Gmelin, and a few others having the bill larger and more  dilated than the second division, which includes the present species,  together with _M. barbata_, _caerulea_, _cuneata_, and no doubt many  others. The construction of the bill in all these birds will be found  precisely the same, though more or less developed in each division, and  even in the species; it thus becomes impossible to draw the line of  demarcation without refining too much on generic distinctions. Their bills,  although so broad, are by no means stout; thus enabling them to prey with  greater readiness on the _Lepidoptera_ and other large winged insects with  soft bodies; while the long stiff bristles at the base of the bill seem  intended to confine the resistance their prey would otherwise make by their  wings. The illustrious Cuvier has well observed, that the true Flycatchers  have the bill longer, narrowed, less compressed, and the tip but slightly  bent.           *       *       *       *       *      Pl. 14    [Illustration]    PICUS rubiginosus.    _Brown Woodpecker._           *       *       *       *       *    GENERIC CHARACTER.        _Rostrum polyedrum, rectum, in apicem compressum, cuneatum, attenuatum.
