The gifts are variously exercised, sometimes in the  way of prophecy, or in tongues; sometimes in discerning of spirits, or  interpretation of tongues. The ordinance of baptism, together with the  imposition of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, is administered  as occasion may require. Thus you will perceive that our worship  differs from what we both have been accustomed to in times that are  past.--Anxious seats and inquiry meetings, &c., are not in use at  all with us; although converts to our faith have swelled our numbers  greatly in every year that is past, yet we are very far from employing  any blustering effort to convert men. The spirit of God attends the  truth with sufficient power to save the upright; while those that hold  the truth in unrighteousness, and contend with it, are beyond the  legitimate exercise of divine power to save, and are led captive by the  devil at his will.    Our worship differs from that of other religious people, inasmuch as  we have the knowledge of God, and the true doctrine and order of his  kingdom, beyond all perplexing doubt and diversity of opinion. It is  utterly impossible for intelligent and devoted sectarian clergy to lead  their hearers into any considerable knowledge of God, for this very  potent reason, that they neither know much of him themselves, nor,  indeed, have they the means of knowing him. For this they are not at  all culpable; but the fact is, nevertheless, incontrovertible.    I do not now speak to please men, nor to mortify them, but I know it to  be true, my brother, and therefore speak it boldly. Are you offended?  Will you stop here and throw down my letter with contempt, as though an  ignorant upstart had abused you? If I write plainly, it is with deep  and painful emotions. While writing I can hardly suppress a flood of  tears. I know the dilemma in which many of my religious brethren are  placed, and the extreme difficulty of approaching them; but whether  they hear or forbear, I must tell them that it is out of their power to  attain to any considerable knowledge of the true and living God. But,  say they, have we not got the good old Bible, which makes men wise unto  salvation? You have, indeed, those venerable truths which have many  ages since made men wise unto salvation; and those truths will teach  you, if you take heed to them, that the Gentiles have been broken off  from the covenant favour of God as the Jews were. But these scriptures  cannot impart to you the gifts of the Holy Ghost; they cannot ordain  and qualify you to teach and preach the gospel, and administer the  ordinances; they cannot give you promises and revelations that are  expressly for _you_.    When the apostle Paul was in danger of being shipwrecked with his crew  (see Acts of Apostles), it would have been poor consolation to him  to read the ancient history of Jonah's shipwreck, and pray over the  subject in order to know how the voyage would result to him; but how  much greater his consolation, and how much more certain his knowledge,  when God ministers to him by visions and angels, and promises both him  and the crew preservation. Philip wanted no better assurance of his  duty to go to Gaza, than for an angel of God to tell him to go; but if  he had pored over ancient revelations, with prayerful anxiety, in order  to know the same, it would have been a poor guide. The New Testament  Saints did not lean upon Old Testament revelations for the knowledge of  present duties, or for aid in their present contingencies; they looked  directly to God for present fresh instruction and aid--they obtained  what they looked for.    The ancient Jews (contemporary with Christ), that leaned on the  venerated sayings of Abraham and Moses, and other old prophets, abode  in darkness, and became the prey of foul spirits, while the advocates  of present revelations were mighty through God, in signs and wonders,  and marvellous deeds.    Now, let the religious people of this day depend exclusively upon the  ancient scriptures, rejecting present revelations, and they will be  filled with ignorance, and the spirit of unrighteousness will possess  them; and they cannot act with that certainty and power that those can,  who know for themselves by immediate revelation. But I have said it is  impossible for them to know much of the true God: the careful observer  knows, that what one sect or denomination teaches for doctrine, another  will controvert and deny. There is not that power in the doctrine of  any one sect that gives them much ascendancy over any other sect. The  doctrines of all sects, though adverse to each other, are about equally  weighty and plausible; no one gets any considerable ascendancy; if  there appears to be light in one sect over another sect, it shows an  equal amount of an opposite character.    It is an acknowledged duty of parents, in this church, to teach their  children the elementary principles of religion, training them up in  the way they should go. You ask if they are instructed in learning.  As a people we aim most diligently to give our children learning. Our  persecutions, oppressions, and poverty have operated greatly to the  disadvantage of our children; still we have a chartered University,  that promises much benefit to us; and common schools are extensively  multiplying throughout the city.    The present population of the city is from ten to twelve thousand. You  ask, \"What is their condition, occupation, and general character?\" The  condition of the people is as prosperous as circumstances will permit.  Many of them, like Jacob of old, have left a good patrimony at home  that they are not benefitted from, by reason of their being every where  spoken against; but though they had nothing but their staff in hand,  and a little bundle upon their back when they came, they have now in  many instances a comfortable cottage, a flourishing garden, and a good  cow. There are many instances of families being subject to privations,  beyond what they were accustomed to in early days; and there are some  instances of deep penury, through sickness, persecution, and other  uncontrollable causes; and there are also instances of wealth; but  be assured, sir, there is not a more contented and cheerful people  to be found. Families will consent to let father and brother go out  preaching, when their daily bread is barely supplied for a few months.    Believing as we do, that these are the last days, and that signal  matters await this generation; and that the harvest must be gathered  soon, if at all, you must not marvel if we do not all at once become  rich, and build large houses, and enclose productive farms. If riches  were our object, we might readily gratify the most ambitious grasp.  We possess every facility for being rich, but we long to behold the  beauty of the Lord, and inquire in his holy temple. The place of his  sanctuary, which we greatly desire to beautify, is a site of surpassing  natural beauty. Upon it stands the incomplete structure of a temple;  in dimensions, a little over one hundred and twenty-eight feet long,  by eighty-eight feet wide, to be elevated in height a little under  sixty feet; the walls are made of a well-wrought handsome stone. The  inhabitants are very industrious, being occupied in agriculture and the  various mechanical arts.    Our people are mostly the working class of the community, from the  United States, and Great Britain and her Provinces. They are a very  intelligent people, especially so far as common sense and a general  knowledge of men and things are concerned.    Our Elders are versed in religious polemics, from discussions in the  pulpit, stage, bar-room, canal, and steam-boat, of the fireside and  highway side: and, perhaps, you are not aware that many, very many, are  from the most enlightened portion of New England; men that have been  rocked in the cradle of orthodoxy and liberty; accustomed to fatigue,  privation, and opposition; and knowing that their religion has more  light and truth, and the power of the Holy Ghost to support it, than  any other that has existed since the days of the apostles, they are  prepared to endure all things with the assurance that their reward is  great in heaven.    You wish to know the general character of the people. There is probably  less profanity, drunkenness, lewdness, theft, fighting, gambling, and  tavern-haunting, than in any other city of the same magnitude.    But I must close my answer to your many and minute inquiries, having  already protracted them beyond my original design. Your letter contains  many important inquiries, similar indeed to what I have received from  other distinguished friends from different parts of the Union. You will  accept my apology for not answering at an earlier date; and though I  design this epistle to be a general answer to all similar inquiries,  yet shall hereafter readily reciprocate all private communications in  the usual method of friendship and affection.    Most sincerely and truly yours,    ORSON SPENCER.        LETTER II.    IMMEDIATE REVELATION.    _Liverpool, May_ 15, 1847.    Reverend Sir,--Agreeable to promise made in my first answer to your  letter, I now resume my pen to inform you, in a series of letters, of  the distinguishing tenets of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints, according to the faith which I myself do entertain, with all  sobriety and integrity of heart, before God and all good men. I had  hoped, however, that more leisure would have favoured me, not only that  I might more minutely and perspicuously maintain the primitive faith,  but also do it in such conciseness and embellishment of diction, as  both to please and enlighten.    The first subject to which I will invite your attention will be that  of IMMEDIATE REVELATION. It shall be my direct aim to show in this  letter, that no person ever did partake of the gospel of salvation, or  ever will "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45899"],[0,"Studies of Travel: Italy (#6)"],[1,"their keepers  would not have learned the common, but shabby, trick of keeping them  covered, in hopes of earning a _lira_ by uncovering them. May we make  the confession that we became aware--or, to speak more delicately,  that we were reminded--of the existence of the colony at once Julian  and Flavian by the description in the generally excellent German  guide-book of Gsell-fels? And may we further add that, though we feel  thoroughly thankful to its author for sending us to Spello at all,  yet his description is not quite so orderly as is usual with him, and  that, though he is perfectly accurate in his enumeration of the Roman  monuments, yet his account led us to expect to find them in a more  perfect state than they actually are? On the whole, except for the  wonderful prospect which Spello shares with Perugia and Assisi, we  should hardly send anybody to Spello except a very zealous antiquary;  but a very zealous antiquary we certainly should send thither. There is  no one object of first-rate importance of any date in the place; but  there are the remains of a crowd of objects which have been of some  importance. There is also the site; there is the general look of the  place, which is akin to that of the other hill-towns, but which, as  Spello is the smallest and least frequented of the group, is there less  untouched and modernized in any way than even at Cortona or Assisi.  We except of course the fashion of mercilessly spoiling the mediaeval  houses which has gone on as merrily at Spello as at Perugia and Assisi.  But that is no fashion of yesterday. The general old-world air, strong  in some parts of Perugia, stronger at Assisi, is strongest of all at  Spello, while at Spello there seems less eagerness than at Cortona to  seize the stranger and make a prey of him. The look-out is perhaps the  finest of all; it takes in as prominent objects sharp-peaked mountains  and ranges deep with snow, which barely come into the other views,  and the long series of hill-towns is pleasantly broken by the towers  and cupolas of Foligno in the plain. The mediaeval walls and towers,  at all events on the south-eastern side, form a line which is not  easily surpassed; the walk outside Spello, though it lacks both the  antiquity and the wildness of the walk outside Cortona, outdoes it in  mere picturesque effect. The particular objects at Spello are perhaps  a little disappointing: Spello itself, as a whole, is certainly not  disappointing.    At Spello we have reached an Italian town which is not a bishop's see;  even in Italy it was not likely to be so, with Assisi so close on one  hand and Foligno on the other. There is therefore no _duomo_, nor is  there any other church of much architectural importance. The best are  two small forsaken Romanesque churches outside the walls, one on each  side of the town. One of them, that of St. Claudius, forms one building  of a group by which we pass on the road from Assisi to Spello, a group  lying in the plain, with Spello on its height rising above them. There  is a large modern villa which seems to be built on Roman foundations;  by its side lies the little Romanesque church; nearly opposite is the  amphitheatre of Hispellum, keeping some fragments of its walls and with  its marked shape deeply impressed on the ground. Here the amphitheatre  is down in the plain; at Assisi it stands in the higher part of the  present city; in both it lies, according to rule, outside the original  Roman enclosure. It shows the passionate love for these sports wherever  the influence of Rome spread, that two amphitheatres could be needed  with so small a distance between them as that which parts Assisi from  Spello. More nearly opposite to the villa are other Roman fragments  which are said to have been part of a theatre; but the form of the  building is certainly not so clearly stamped on the ground as that of  its bloodier neighbour. Indeed we are in a region of Roman remains;  other fragments lie by the roadside between Assisi and Spello, and when  we reach the latter town, we find that, next to its general effect, it  is its Roman remains which form its chief attraction.    As we draw near from Assisi, the Julian colony of Hispellum, the Flavia  Constans of a later day, is becomingly entered by a Roman gateway which  bears the name of Porta Consolare. But on the road from Foligno the  consular gate is reached only through a mediaeval one, which bears, as  we have said, all the names of the town prominently set forth for the  stranger's benefit. The consular gate stands at the bottom of the hill:  for Spello thoroughly occupies the whole of its hill; there is plenty  of climbing to be done in its streets; but it has all to be done in  continuous streets within the town walls. The consular gate has been  patched in later times; but the Roman arch is perfect. It is a single  simple arch, plain enough, and of no great height, a marked contrast to  the lofty arch of Perugia. Another gateway on the side towards Assisi,  known as _Porta Veneris_, must have been a far more elaborate design.  But the whole is imperfect and broken down; one arch of the double  entrance is blocked, and the other is supplanted by a later arch. Yet  there is a good effect about the whole, owing to the bold polygonal  towers of later date which flank the Roman gateway. Another gateway,  higher up on the same side, is cut down to the mere stones of an arch  hanging in the air. This is locally known as the _arco di trionfo_. Of  the _arco di Augusto_ within the town, said to be a triumphal arch of  Macrinus, there is nothing left but a single jamb. In short the Roman  remains of Hispellum, though considerable in number, are slight and  fragmentary in actual extent. Yet there is a pleasure in tracing them  out. Conceive them perfect, and Hispellum would come near to rival  Verona, not as it was, but as it is. But, after all, there is a certain  perverse turn of thought which is better pleased with tracing out what  has been than with simply admiring what still is. Spello will make the  end of a mid-Italian series seen after the great snow-tide to match  the mid-French series seen before it. Everything cannot be seen in one  journey. All roads lead to Rome; but thirty-seven days are enough to  spend on any one of them. From the colony of Hispellum then we must  hurry on to _aurea Roma_ herself, even though we have to rush by many a  town and fortress on its hill-top, by Trevi and Spoleto, and, proudest  of all, by         ... that grey crag where, girt with towers,       The fortress of Nequinum lowers           O'er the pale waves of Nar.    Marry, Narni is somewhat; but Rome is more. Rome, too, at each visit,  presents fresh objects, old and new. The oldest and the newest seem to  have come together, when one set of placards on the wall invites the  Roman people to meet on the Capitol, and when the Quaestor Bacchus--it  is taking a liberty with a living man and magistrate, but we cannot  help Latinizing the _Questore Bacco_--puts out another set of placards  to forbid the meeting. We are inclined to turn to others among  our memories, to others among our lays. We might almost look for a  secession; we might almost expect to see once more         ... the tents which in old time whitened the Sacred Hill.    But those who were forbidden to meet on the Capitol did not secede  even to the Aventine; the secession was done within doors, in the _Sala  Dante_.          Veii.      The student of what M. Ampere calls \"L'Histoire Romaine a Rome\" must  take care not to confine his studies to Rome only. The local history  of Rome--and the local history of Rome is no small part of the  oecumenical history--is not fully understood unless we fully take in  the history and position of the elder sites among which Rome arose.  With Rome we must compare and contrast the cities of her enemies and  her allies, the cities which she swept away, the cities which she made  part of herself, the cities which simply withered away before her. And  first on the list may well come the city which was before all others  the rival of Rome, and where she did indeed sweep with the besom of  destruction. A short journey from the Flaminian Gate, a journey through  a country which might almost pass for a border shire of England, with  the heights of Wales in the distance, brings us to a city which has  utterly perished, where no permanent human dwelling-place is left  within the ancient circuit. In a basin, as it were, unseen until we  are close beneath or above it, hedged in by surrounding hills as by  a rampart, stands all that is left of the first great rival of Rome,  an inland Carthage on the soil of Etruria. There once was Veii, the  first great conquest of Rome, the Italian Troy, round whose ten years'  siege wonders have gathered almost as round the Achaian warfare by the  Hellespont. There are no monuments of the departed life of Veii such  as are left of not a few cities which have passed out of the list of  living things no less utterly. Of the greatest city of southern Etruria  nothing remains beyond a site which can never be wiped out but by some  convulsion of nature, a few scraps to show that man once dwelled there,  and tombs not a few to show that those who dwelled there belonged to a  race with whom death counted for more than life.    A sight of the spot which once was Veii makes us better understand  some points in early Italian history. We see why Veii was the rival  of Rome, and why she was the unsuccessful rival of Rome. Above all,  we understand better than anywhere else how deep must have been the  hatred with which the old-established cities of Italy must have looked  on the upstart settlement by the Tiber, which grew up to so strange  a greatness and threatened to devour them one by one. Veii, the  great border city of Etruria, was the only one among Rome's immediate  neighbours which could contend with her on equal terms."]]]
