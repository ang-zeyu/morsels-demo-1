[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38207"],[0,"On the Origin and Metamorphoses of Insects (#6)"],[1,"order Trichoptera are well known in their larval  condition, under the name of caddis worms. These larvae are not  altogether unlike caterpillars in form, but they live in water--which is  the case with very few lepidopterous larvae--and form for themselves  cylindrical cases or tubes, built up of sand, little stones, bits of  stick, leaves, or even shells. They generally feed on vegetable  substances, but will also attack minute freshwater animals. When full  grown, the larva fastens its case to a stone, the stem of a plant, or  some other fixed substance, and closes the two ends with an open grating  of silken threads, so as to admit the free access of water, while  excluding enemies. It then turns into a pupa which bears some  resemblance to the perfect insect, \"except that the antennae, palpi,  wings, and legs are shorter, enclosed in separate sheaths, and arranged  upon the breast.\" The pupa remains quiet in the tube until nearly ready  to emerge, when it comes to the surface, and in some cases creeps out of  the water. It is not therefore so completely motionless as the pupae of  Lepidoptera.    The Diptera, or Flies, comprise insects with two wings only, the hinder  pair being represented by minute club-shaped organs called \"halteres.\"  Flies quit the egg generally in the form of fat, fleshy, legless grubs.  They feed principally on decaying animal or vegetable matter, and are no  doubt useful as scavengers. Other species, as the gadflies, deposit  their eggs on the bodies of animals, within which the grubs feed, when  hatched. The mouth is generally furnished with two hooks which serve  instead of jaws. The pupae of Diptera are of two kinds. In the true  flies, the outer skin of the full-grown larva is not shed, but contracts  and hardens, thus assuming the appearance of an oval brownish shell or  case, within which the insect changes into a chrysalis. The pupae of the  gnats, on the contrary, have the limbs distinct and enclosed in sheaths.  They are generally inactive, but some of the aquatic species continue to  swim about.    One group of Flies, which is parasitic on horses, sheep, bats, and other  animals, has been called the Pupipara, because it was supposed that they  were not born until they had arrived at the condition of pupae. They come  into the world in the form of smooth, ovate bodies, much resembling  ordinary dipterous pupae, but as Leuckart has shown,[11] they are true,  though abnormal, larvae.    The next order, that of the Aphaniptera, is very small in number,  containing only the different species of Flea. The larva is long,  cylindrical, and legless; the chrysalis is motionless, and the perfect  insect is too well known, at least, as regards its habits, to need any  description.    The Heteroptera, unlike the preceding orders of insects, quit the egg in  a form differing from that of the perfect insect principally in the  absence of wings, which are gradually acquired. In their metamorphoses  they resemble the Orthoptera, and are active through life. The majority  are dull in colour, though some few are very beautiful. The species  constituting this group, though very numerous, are generally small, and  not so familiarly known to us as those of the other large orders, with  indeed one exception, the well-known Bug. This is not, apparently, an  indigenous insect, but seems to have been introduced. The word is indeed  used by old writers, but either as meaning a bugbear, or in a general  sense, and not with reference to this particular insect. In this country  it never acquires wings, but is stated to do so sometimes in warmer  climates. The Heteroptera cannot exactly be said either to sting or  bite. The jaws, of which, as usual among insects, there are two pairs,  are like needles, which are driven into the flesh, and the blood is then  sucked up the lower lip, which has the form of a tube. This peculiar  structure of the mouth prevails throughout the whole order; consequently  their nutriment consists almost entirely of the juices of animals or  plants. The Homoptera agree with the Heteroptera in the structure of the  mouth, and in the metamorphoses. They differ principally in the front  wings, which in Homoptera are membranous throughout, while in the  Heteroptera, the front part is thickened and leathery. As in the  Heteroptera, however, so also in the Homoptera, some species do not  acquire wings. The Cicada, celebrated for its chirp, and the lanthorn  fly, belong to this group. So also does the so-called Cuckoo-spit, so  common in our gardens, which has the curious faculty of secreting round  itself a quantity of frothy fluid which serves to protect it from its  enemies. But the best known insects of this group are the Aphides or  Plant-lice; while the most useful belong to the Coccidae, or scale  insects, from one species of which we obtain the substance called lac,  so extensively used in the manufacture of sealing-wax and varnish.  Several species also have been used in dyeing, especially the Cochineal  insect of Mexico, a species which lives on the cactus. The male _Coccus_  is a minute, active insect, with four large wings; while the female, on  the contrary, never acquires wings, but is very sluggish, broad, more or  less flattened, and in fact, when full grown, looks like a small brown,  red, or white scale.    The larva of the order Lepidoptera are familiar to us all, under the  name of caterpillars. The insects of this order in their larval  condition are almost all phytophagous, and are very uniform both in  structure and in habits. The body is long and cylindrical, consisting of  thirteen segments; the head is armed with powerful jaws; the three  following segments, the future prothorax, mesothorax, and meta-thorax,  each bears a pair of simple articulated legs. Of the posterior segments,  five also bear false or pro-legs, which are short, unjointed, and  provided with a number of hooklets. A caterpillar leads a dull and  uneventful life; it eats ravenously, and grows rapidly, casting its skin  several times during the process, which generally lasts only a few  weeks; though in some cases, as for instance that of the goat-moth, it  extends over a period of two or three years, after which the larva  changes into a quiescent pupa or chrysalis.          CHAPTER II.    _THE INFLUENCE OF EXTERNAL CONDITIONS ON THE FORM AND STRUCTURE OF  LARVAE._      The facts recapitulated briefly in the preceding chapter show, that the  forms of insect larvae depend greatly on the group to which they belong.  Thus the same tree may harbour larvae of Diptera, Hymenoptera,  Coleoptera, and Lepidoptera; each presenting the form typical of the  family to which it belongs.    If, again, we take a group, such, for instance, as the Lamellicorn  beetles, we shall find larvae extremely similar in form, yet very  different in habits. Those, for instance, of the common cockchafer (Fig.  1) feed on the roots of grass; those of _Cetonia aurata_ (Fig. 2)  inhabit ants' nests; the larvae of the genus _Trox_ (Fig. 3) are found on  dry animal substances; of _Oryctes_ (Fig. 4) in tan-pits; of _Aphodius_  (Fig. 5) in dung; of _Lucanus_ (the stag-beetle, Fig. 6) in wood.    [Illustration: FIG. 1, Larva of the Cockchafer (_Melolontha_).  (Westwood, Int. to the Modern Classification of Insects, vol. i. p.  194.). 2, Larva of _Cetonia_. 3, Larva of _Trox_. 4, Larva of _Oryctes_.  5, Larva of _Aphodius_ (Chapuis and Candeze, Mem. Soc. Roy. Liege,  1853). 6, Larva of _Lucanus_. (Packard, Guide to the Study of Insects,  Fig. 403).]    On the other hand, in the present chapter it will be my object to show  that the form of the larva depends very much on the conditions of its  life. Thus, those larvae which are internal parasites, whether in  animals or plants, are vermiform, as are those which live in cells, and  depend on their parents for food. On the other hand, larvae which burrow  in wood have strong jaws and generally somewhat weak thoracic legs;  whilst those which feed on leaves have the thoracic legs more developed,  but less so than the carnivorous species. Now, the Hymenoptera, as a  general rule, belong to the first category: the larvae of the Ichneumons,  &c., which live in animals,--those of the Cynipidae, inhabiting  galls,--and those of ants, bees, wasps, &c., which are fed by their  parents, are fleshy, apodal grubs; though the remarkable fact that the  embryos of bees in one stage of their development possess rudiments of  thoracic legs which subsequently disappear, seems to show, not indeed  that the larvae of bees were ever hexapod, but that bees are descended  from ancestors which had hexapod larvae, and that the present apod  condition of these larvae is not original, but results from their mode of  life.    On the other hand, the larvae of _Sirex_ (Fig. 14) being wood-burrowers,  possess well-developed thoracic legs. Again, the larvae of the  Tenthredinidae, which feed upon leaves, closely resemble the caterpillars  of Lepidoptera, even to the presence of abdominal pro-legs.    [Illustration: FIG. 7, Larva of _Brachytarsus_ (Ratzeburg, Forst.  Insecten). 8, Larva of _Crioceris_ (Westwood, loc. cit.).]    The larvae of most Coleoptera (Beetles) are active, hexapod, and more or  less flattened: but those which live inside vegetable tissues, such as  the weevils, are apod fleshy grubs, like those of Hymenoptera. Pl. II.,  Fig. 6, represents the larva of the nut-weevil, _Balaninus_ (Pl. I., Fig.  6), and it will be seen that it closely resembles Pl. II., Fig. 5, which  represents that of a fly (_Anthrax_), Pl. I., Fig. 5, and Pl. II., Figs.  7, 8, and 9, which represent respectively those of a _Cynips_ or gall-fly  (Pl. I., Fig. 7), an ant (Pl. I., Fig. 8), and wasp (Pl. I., Fig. 9).  Nor is _Balaninus_ the only genus of Coleoptera which affords us examples  of this fact. Thus in the genus _Scolytus_ (Pl. I., Fig. 4), the larvae  (Pl. II., Fig. 4), which, as already mentioned, feed on the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38233"],[0,"Birds Every Child Should Know (#6)"],[1,"hissed into his ears until he is thankful  enough to escape.        THE LITTLE BROWN WREN        From \"Boy's Book of Rhyme,\" by Clinton Scollard      There's a little brown wren that has built in our tree,    And she's scarcely as big as a big bumble-bee;    She has hollowed a house in the heart of a limb,    And made the walls tidy and made the floors trim    With the down of the crow's foot, with tow, and with straw    The cosiest dwelling that ever you saw.      This little brown wren has the brightest of eyes    And a foot of a very diminutive size.    Her tail is as trig as the sail of a ship.    She's demure, though she walks with a hop and a skip;    And her voice--but a flute were more fit than a pen    To tell of the voice of the little brown wren.      One morning Sir Sparrow came sauntering by    And cast on the wren's house an envious eye;    With a strut of bravado and toss of his head,    \"I'll put in my claim here,\" the bold fellow said;    So straightway he mounted on impudent wing,    And entered the door without pausing to ring.      An instant--and swiftly that feathery knight    All towsled and tumbled, in terror took flight,    While there by the door on her favourite perch,    As neat as a lady just starting for church.    With this song on her lips, \"He will not call again    Unless he is asked,\" sat the little brown wren.    If the bluebirds had her courage and hot, quick temper, they would  never let the sparrows drive them away from their boxes. Unfortunately  a hole large enough to admit a {37} bluebird will easily admit those  grasping monopolists; but Jenny Wren is safe, if she did but know it,  in her house with its tiny front door. It is amusing to see a sparrow  try to work his shoulders through the small hole of an empty wren  house, pushing and kicking madly, but all in vain.    What rent do the wrens pay for their little houses? No man is clever  enough to estimate the vast numbers of insects on your place that they  destroy. They eat nothing else, which is the chief reason why they are  so lively and excitable. Unable to soar after flying insects because  of their short, round wings, they keep, as a rule, rather close to the  ground which their finely barred brown feathers so closely match.  Whether hunting for grubs in the wood-pile, scrambling over the brush  heap after spiders, searching among the trees to provide a dinner for  their large families, or creeping, like little feathered mice, in  queer nooks and crannies among the outbuildings on the farm, they are  always busy in your interest which is also theirs. It certainly pays,  in every sense, to encourage wrens.      THE CAROLINA WREN    The house wrens have a tiny cousin, a mite of a bird, called the  winter wren, that is so shy {38} and retiring you will probably never  become well acquainted with it. It delights in mossy, rocky woods near  running water. But a larger chestnut brown cousin, the Carolina wren,  with a prominent white eyebrow, a bird which is quite common in the  Middle and Southern States, sometimes nests in outbuildings and in all  sorts of places about the farm. However, he too really prefers the  forest undergrowths near water, fallen logs, half decayed stumps, and  mossy rocks where insects lurk but cannot hide from his sharp, peering  eyes. Now here, now there, appearing and disappearing, never at rest,  even his expressive tail being in constant motion, he seems more  nervously active than Jenny Wren's fidgety husband.    Some people call him the mocking wren, but I think he never  deliberately tries to imitate other birds. Why should he? It is true  that his loud-ringing, three-syllabled whistle, _\"Tea-ket-tle,  Tea-ket-tle, Tea-ket-tle\"_ suggests the crested titmouse's _\"peto\"_ of  two syllables, but in quality only; and some have thought that his  whistled notes are difficult to distinguish from the one-syllabled,  but oft-repeated, long-drawn _quoit_ of the cardinal. These three  birds are frequently to be heard in the same neighbourhood and you may  easily compare their voices; but if you listen carefully, I think you  will not accuse the wren of trying to mock either of the {39} others.  In addition to his ringing, whistled notes, he can make other sounds  peculiarly his own: trills and quavers, scolding _cacks_, rattling  _kringggs_, something like the tree toad's, besides the joyful,  lyrical melody that has given him his reputation as a musician. Even  these do not complete his repertoire. To deliver his famous song, he  chooses a conspicuous position in the top of some bush or low tree;  then, with head uplifted and tail drooping--a favourite posture of all  these lively singers--he makes us very glad indeed that we heard him.  Happily he sings almost as many months in the year as the most  cheerful bird we have, the song sparrow.      THE MARSH WREN    Hidden among the tall grasses and reeds along the creeks and rivers,  lives the long-billed marsh wren, a nervous, active little creature  that you know at a glance. With tail cocked up and even tilted forward  toward her head in the extreme of wren fashion, or suddenly jerked  downward to help keep her balance, she sways with the grass as it  blows in the wind--a dainty little sprite. With no desire to make your  acquaintance, she flies with a short, jerky motion (because of her  short wings) a few rods away, {40} then drops into the grasses which  engulf her as surely as if she had dropped into the sea. You may  search in vain to find her now. Like the rails, she has her paths and  runways among the tall sedges and cat-tails, where not even a boy in  rubber boots may safely follow.    But she does not live alone. Withdraw, sit down quietly for awhile and  wait for the excitement of your visit to subside; for every member of  the wren colony, peering sharply at you through the grasses, was  watching you long before you saw the first wren. Presently you hear a  rippling, bubbling song from one of her neighbours; then another and  another and still another from among the cat-tails which, you now  suspect, conceal many musicians. The song goes off like a small  explosion of melody whose force often carries the tiny singer up into  the air. One explosion follows another, and between them there is much  wren talk--a scolding chatter that is as great a relief to the birds'  nervous energy as the exhaust from its safety valve is to a steam  engine. The rising of a red-winged blackbird from his home in the  sedges, the rattle of the kingfisher on his way up the creek, or the  leisurely flapping of a bittern over the marshes is enough to start  the chattering chorus.    Why are the birds so excited? This is their nesting season, May, and  really they are too {41} busy to be bothered by visitors. Most birds  are content to make one nest a year but not these, who, in their  excess of wren energy, keep on building nest after nest in the  vicinity of the one preferred for their chocolate brown eggs. Bending  down the tips of the rushes they somehow manage to weave them, with  the weeds and grasses they bring, into a bulky ball suspended between  the rushes and firmly attached to them. In one side of this green  grassy globe they leave an entrance through which to carry the finer  grasses for the lining and the down from last season's bursted  cat-tails. When a nest is finished, its entrance is often cleverly  concealed. If there are several feet of water below the high and dry  cradle, so much the better, think the wrens--fewer enemies can get at  them; but they do sometimes build in meadows that are merely damp. In  such meadows the short-billed marsh wren, a slightly smaller sprite,  prefers to live.      THE BROWN THRASHER    _Called also: Brown Thrush; Long Thrush;  Ground Thrush; Red Thrush; French Mocking-bird; Mavis._      People who are not very well acquainted with the birds about them  usually mistake the {42} long-tailed brown thrasher for a thrush  because he has a rusty back and a speckled white breast, which they  seem to think is an exclusive thrush characteristic, which it  certainly is not. The oven-bird and several members of the sparrow  tribe, among other birds, have speckled and streaked breasts, too. The  brown thrasher is considerably larger than a thrush and his habits are  quite different. Watch him nervously twitch his long tail, or work it  up and down like one end of a see-saw, or suddenly jerk it up erect  while he sits at attention in the thicket, then droop it when, after  mounting to a conspicuous perch, he lifts his head to sing, and you  will probably \"guess right the very first time\" that he is a near  relative of the wrens, not a thrush at all. As a little sailor-boy  once said to me, \"He carries his tell-tail on the stern.\"    Like his cousin, the catbird, the brown thrasher likes to live in  bushy thickets overgrown with vines. Here, running over the ground  among the fallen leaves, he picks up with his long slender bill,  worms, May beetles and scores of other kinds of insects that, but for  him, would soon find their way to the garden, orchard, and fields. Yet  few farmers ever thank him. Because they don't often see him picking  up the insects in their cultivated land, they wrongly conclude that he  does them no benefit, only mischief, {43} because, occasionally, he  does eat a little fruit. It seems to be a dreadful sin for a fellow in  feathers to help himself to a strawberry or a cherry or a little grain  now and then, although, having eaten quantities of insects that, but  for him, would have destroyed them, who has earned a better right to a  share of the profits?    Do you think the brown thrasher looks any more like a cuckoo than he  does like a thrush? Simply because he is nearly as long as the dull  brownish cuckoo and has a brown back, though of quite a different  tawny shade, some boys and girls say it is difficult to tell the two  birds apart. The cuckoo glides through the air as easily"]]]
