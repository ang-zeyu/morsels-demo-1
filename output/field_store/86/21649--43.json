I have already stated that intolerance is always an accompaniment  of powerful religious beliefs.  Political and religious  revolutions furnish us with numerous proofs of this fact, and  show us also that the mutual intolerance of sectaries of the same  religion is always much greater than that of the defenders  of remote and alien faiths, such as Islamism and Christianity.  In fact, if we consider the faiths for whose sake France was so  long rent asunder, we shall find that they did not differ on any  but accessory points.  Catholics and Protestants adored exactly  the same God, and only differed in their manner of adoring Him.  If reason had played the smallest part in the elaboration of  their belief, it could easily have proved to them that it must be  quite indifferent to God whether He sees men adore Him in this  fashion or in that.    Reason being powerless to affect the brain of the convinced,  Protestants and Catholics continued their ferocious conflicts.  All the efforts of their sovereigns to reconcile them were in  vain.  Catherine de Medicis, seeing the party of the Reformed  Church increasing day by day in spite of persecution, and  attracting a considerable number of nobles and magistrates,  thought to disarm them by convoking at Poissy, in 1561, an  assembly of bishops and pastors with the object of fusing the two  doctrines.  Such an enterprise indicated that the queen, despite  her subtlety, knew nothing of the laws of mystic logic.  Not in  all history can one cite an example of a belief destroyed or  reduced by means of refutation.  Catherine did not even know that  although toleration is with difficulty possible between  individuals, it is impossible between collectivities.  Her  attempt failed completely.  The assembled theologians hurled  texts and insults at one another's heads, but no one was moved.  Catherine thought to succeed better in 1562 by promulgating an  edict according Protestants the right to unite in the public  celebration of their cult.    This tolerance, very admirable from a philosophical point of  view, but not at all wise from the political standpoint, had no  other result beyond exasperating both parties.  In the Midi,  where the Protestants were strongest, they persecuted the  Catholics, sought to convert them by violence, cut their throats  if they did not succeed, and sacked their cathedrals.  In the  regions where the Catholics were more numerous the Reformers  suffered like persecutions.    Such hostilities as these inevitably engendered civil war.  Thus  arose the so-called religious wars, which so long spilled the  blood of France.  The cities were ravaged, the inhabitants  massacred, and the struggle rapidly assumed that special quality  of ferocity peculiar to religious or political conflicts, which,  at a later date, was to reappear in the wars of La Vendee.    Old men, women, and children, all were exterminated.  A certain  Baron d'Oppede, first president of the Parliament of Aix, had  already set an example by killing 3,000 persons in the space of  ten days, with refinements of cruelty, and destroying three  cities and twenty-two villages.  Montluc, a worthy forerunner of  Carrier, had the Calvinists thrown living into the wells until  these were full.  The Protestants were no more humane.  They did  not spare even the Catholic churches, and treated the tombs and  statues just as the delegates of the Convention were to treat the  royal tombs of Saint Denis.    Under the influence of these conflicts France was progressively  disintegrated, and at the end of the reign of Henri III. was  parcelled out into veritable little confederated municipal  republics, forming so many sovereign states.  The royal power was  vanishing.  The States of Blois claimed to dictate their wishes  to Henri III., who had fled from his capital.  In 1577 the  traveller Lippomano, who traversed France, saw important cities--  Orleans, Tours, Blois, Poitiers--entirely devastated, the  cathedrals and churches in ruins, and the tombs shattered.  This  was almost the state of France at the end of the Directory.    Among the events of this epoch, that which has left the darkest  memory, although it was not perhaps the most murderous, was the  massacre of St. Bartholomew in 1572, ordered, according to the  historians, by Catherine de Medicis and Charles IX.    One does not require a very profound knowledge of psychology to  realise that no sovereign could have ordered such an event.  St.  Bartholomew's Day was not a royal but a popular crime.  Catherine  de Medicis, believing her existence and that of the king  threatened by a plot directed by four or five Protestant leaders  then in Paris, sent men to kill them in their houses, according  to the summary fashion of the time.  The massacre which followed  is very well explained by M. Battifol in the following terms:--    ``At the report of what was afoot the rumour immediately ran  through Paris that the Huguenots were being massacred; Catholic  gentlemen, soldiers of the guard, archers, men of the people, in  short all Paris, rushed into the streets, arms in hand, in order  to participate in the execution, and the general massacre  commenced, to the sound of ferocious cries of `The  Huguenots! Kill, kill!'  They were struck down, they were  drowned, they were hanged.  All that were known as heretics were  so served.  Two thousand persons were killed in Paris.''    By contagion, the people of the provinces imitated those of  Paris, and six to eight thousand Protestants were slain.    When time had somewhat cooled religious passions, all the  historians, even the Catholics, spoke of St. Bartholomew's Day  with indignation.  They thus showed how difficult it is for the  mentality of one epoch to understand that of another.    Far from being criticised, St. Bartholomew's Day provoked an  indescribable enthusiasm throughout the whole of Catholic Europe.    Philip II. was delirious with joy when he heard the news, and the  King of France received more congratulations than if he had won a  great battle.    But it was Pope Gregory XIII. above all who manifested the  keenest satisfaction.  He had a medal struck to commemorate the  happy event,[2] ordered joy-fires to be lit and cannon fired,  celebrated several masses, and sent for the painter Vasari to  depict on the walls of the Vatican the principal scenes of  carnage.  Further, he sent to the King of France an ambassador  instructed to felicitate that monarch upon his fine action.  It  is historical details of this kind that enable us to comprehend  the mind of the believer.  The Jacobins of the Terror had a  mentality very like that of Gregory XIII.        [2] The medal must have been distributed pretty widely, for the  cabinet of medals at the Bibliotheque Nationale possesses  three examples: one in gold, one in silver, and one in copper.  This medal, reproduced by Bonnani in his Numism. Pontific.  (vol. i. p. 336), represents on one side Gregory XIII., and on  the other an angel striking Huguenots with a sword.  The exergue  is Ugonotorum strages, that is, Massacre of the Huguenots.  (The word strages may be translated by carnage or massacre, a  sense which it possesses in Cicero and Livy; or again by  disaster, ruin, a sense attributed to it in Virgil and Tacitus.)        Naturally the Protestants were not indifferent to such a  hecatomb, and they made such progress that in 1576 Henri III. was  reduced to granting them, by the Edict of Beaulieu, entire  liberty of worship, eight strong places, and, in the Parliaments,  Chambers composed half of Catholics and half of Huguenots.    These forced concessions did not lead to peace.  A Catholic  League was created, having the Duke of Guise at its head, and the  conflict continued.  But it could not last for ever.  We know how  Henri IV. put an end to it, at least for a time, by his  abjuration in 1593, and by the Edict of Nantes.    The struggle was quieted but not terminated.  Under Louis XIII.  the Protestants were still restless, and in 1627 Richelieu was  obliged to besiege La Rochelle, where 15,000 Protestants  perished.  Afterwards, possessing more political than religious  feeling, the famous Cardinal proved extremely tolerant toward the  Reformers.    This tolerance could not last.  Contrary beliefs cannot come into  contact without seeking to annihilate each other, as soon as one  feels capable of dominating the other.  Under Louis XIV. the  Protestants had become by far the weaker, and were forced to  renounce the struggle and live at peace.  Their number was then  about 1,200,000, and they possessed more than 600 churches,  served by about 700 pastors.  The presence of these  heretics on French soil was intolerable to the Catholic clergy,  who endeavoured to persecute them in various ways.  As these  persecutions had little result, Louis XIV. resorted to  dragonnading them in 1685, when many individuals perished, but  without further result.  Under the pressure of the clergy,  notably of Bossuett, the Edict of Nantes was revoked, and the  Protestants were forced to accept conversion or to leave France.  This disastrous emigration lasted a long time, and is said to  have cost France 400,000 inhabitants, men of notable energy,  since they had the courage to listen to their conscience rather  than their interests.      6.  The results of Religious Revolutions.      If religious revolutions were judged only by the gloomy story of  the Reformation, we should be forced to regard them as highly  disastrous.  But all have not played a like part, the civilising  influence of certain among them being considerable.    By giving a people moral unity they greatly increase its material  power.  We see this notably when a new faith, brought by  Mohammed, transforms the petty and impotent tribes of Arabia into  a formidable nation.    Such a new religious belief does not merely render a people  homogeneous.  It "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44896"],[0,"The Autobiography of Parley Parker Pratt (#6)"],[1,"this I ran nearly the whole distance  on foot, and in about two hours had him by the hand. He was much  surprised, although he had heard of a man of my name living in the  neighborhood; but could not believe it was me. We had each of us  taken our chance amid the hardships and toils of a new country for  years, and at last found ourselves together about six hundred miles  from our starting point.    This was a joyful and unexpected meeting of two brothers. He  immediately accompanied me home, and was introduced to my wife and  our little farm in the wilderness, where we spent some days  together. He admired my wife; but above all my farm. \"Brother  Parley,\" said he, \"how have you done all this? When we were last  together you had no wife, no farm, no house, no orchard, and now  you are here with everything smiling around you.\" I replied that  hard work had accomplished it all. And, continued I, we are now  about to leave this quiet home which we have toiled so hard to  make, and perhaps, never see it again. \"How so?\" said he, with much  surprise, and somewhat of disappointment. I then unfolded to him  the gospel and prophecies as they had been opened to me, and told  him that the spirit of these things had wrought so powerfully on my  mind of late that I could not rest; that I could no longer be  contented to dwell in quiet and retirement on my farm, while I had  light to impart to mankind, of which I knew they were in a great  measure ignorant. \"But,\" said he, \"if I had fifty acres of land, a  comfortable house, a fine orchard, a beautiful garden, with meadow  land, grain, and above all, such beautiful flowers and so valuable  a housekeeper as you have, and all these things the work of our own  hands, I am sure I would stay and enjoy the same while I lived; and  the world might go on its own jog, and its own way, for all me.  Besides, how are you to get your living? This is your all; you have  toiled for years to obtain it, and why not now continue to enjoy  it?\" \"William,\" said I, \"I see plainly you know but little of my  circumstances if the changes which have taken place with me since  we parted five years ago, nor how vastly wealthy I have become  within that time. Why, sir, I have bank bills enough, on the very  best institutions in the world, to sustain myself and family while  we live.\"    \"Indeed,\" said he, \"well, I should like to see some of them; I  hope they are genuine.\" \"Certainly,\" I replied, \"there is no doubt  of that. They are true bills and founded on capital that will never  fail, though heaven and earth should pass away. Of this I will  convince you in a moment.\"    I then unlocked my treasury and drew from thence a large pocket  book, fall of promissory notes like the following: _\"Whoever  shall forsake father or mother, brethren or sisters, houses or  lands, wife or children, for my sake and the gospel's, shall  receive an hundred fold in this life, and in the world to come lie  everlasting.\" \"If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, you  shall ask what you will in my name and I will give it you.\" \"All  things are possible to him that believeth.\"_    \"Now, William,\" said I, \"are these the words of Jesus Christ, or  are they not?\" \"They certainly are,\" said he, \"I always believed  the New Testament.\"    \"Then you admit they are genuine bills?\"    \"I do.\"    \"Is the signer able to meet his engagements?\"    \"He certainly is.\"    \"Is he willing?\"    \"He is.\"    \"Well, then, I am going to fulfil the conditions to the letter  on my part. I feel called upon by the Holy Ghost to forsake my  house and home for the gospel's sake; and I will do it, placing  both feet firm on these promises with nothing else to rely upon.\"    \"If I sink, they are false.\"    \"If I am sustained, they are true. I will put them to the test.  Experiment shall now establish the truth of Christ's promises, or  the truth of infidelity.\"    \"Well,\" said he, \"try it, if you will; but, for my part,  although I always believed the Bible, I would not dare believe it  _literally_, and really stand upon its promises, with no  other prop.\"    We parted. He to his business, I to my preparations for a  mission which should only end with my life.    In August, 1830, I had closed my business, completed my  arrangements, and we bid adieu to our wilderness home and never saw  it afterwards.    On settling up, at a great sacrifice of property, we had about  ten dollars left in cash. With this small sum, we launched forth  into the wide world, determining first to visit our native place,  on our mission, and then such other places as I might be led to by  the Holy Spirit.    We made our way to Cleveland, 30 miles. We then took passage on  a schooner for Buffalo, a distance of 200 miles. We had a fair  wind, and the captain, being short of hands, gave me the helm, the  sails being all set, and turned in. I steered the vessel the most  of the day, with no other person on deck. Of course, our passage  cost us little besides my labor. Landing in Buffalo, we engaged our  passage for Albany on a canal boat, distance 360 miles. This,  including board, cost all our money and some articles of clothing.    Arriving at Rochester, I informed my wife that, notwithstanding  our passage being paid through the whole distance, yet I must leave  the boat and her to pursue her passage to our friends; while I  would stop awhile in this region. Why, I did not know; but so it  was plainly manifest by the Spirit to me. I said to her, \"We part  for a season; go and visit our friends in our native place; I will  come soon, but how soon I know not; for I have a work to do in this  region of country, and what it is, or how long it will take to  perform it, I know not; but I will come when it is performed.\"    My wife would have objected to this; but she had seen the hand  of God so plainly manifest in His dealings with me many times, that  she dare not oppose the things manifest to me by His spirit.    She, therefore, consented; and I accompanied her as far as  Newark, a small town upwards of 100 miles from Buffalo, and then  took leave of her, and of the boat.    It was early in the morning, just at the dawn of day, I walked  ten miles into the country, and stopped to breakfast with a Mr.  Wells. I proposed to preach in the evening. Mr. Wells readily  accompanied me through the neighborhood to visit the people, and  circulate the appointment.    We visited an old Baptist deacon by the name of Hamlin. After  hearing of our appointment for evening, he began to tell of a  _book_, a STRANGE BOOK, a _VERY STRANGE BOOK_! in his possession,  which had been just published. This book, he said, purported  to have been originally written on plates either of gold  or brass, by a branch of the tribes of Israel; and to have been  discovered and translated by a young man near Palmyra, in the State  of New York, by the aid of visions, or the ministry of angels. I  inquired of him how or where the book was to be obtained. He  promised me the perusal of it, at his house the next day, if I  would call. I felt a strange interest in the book. I preached that  evening to a small audience, who appeared to be interested in the  truths which I endeavored to unfold to them in a clear and lucid  manner from the Scriptures. Next morning I called at his house,  where, for the first time, my eyes beheld the \"BOOK OF MORMON\"--  that book of books--that record which reveals the antiquities of  the \"_New World_\" back to the remotest ages, and which unfolds the  destiny of its people and the world for all time to come;--that  Book which contains the fulness of the gospel of a crucified and  risen Redeemer;--that Book which reveals a lost remnant of Joseph,  and which was the principal means, in the hands of God, of  directing the entire course of my future life.    I opened it with eagerness, and read its title page. I then read  the testimony of several witnesses in relation to the manner of its  being found and translated. After this I commenced its contents by  course. I read all day; eating was a burden, I had no desire for  food; sleep was a burden when the night came, for I preferred  reading to sleep.    As I read, the spirit of the Lord was upon me, and I knew and  comprehended that the book was true, as plainly and manifestly as a  man comprehends and knows that he exists. My joy was now full, as  it were, and I rejoiced sufficiently to more than pay me for all  the sorrows, sacrifices and toils of my life. I soon determined to  see the young man who had been the instrument of its discovery and  translation.    I accordingly visited the village of Palmyra, and inquired for  the residence of Mr. Joseph Smith. I found it some two or three  miles from the village. As I approached the house at the close of  the day I overtook a man who was driving some cows, and inquired of  him for Mr. Joseph Smith, the translator of the \"_Book of Mormon  _.\" He informed me that he now resided in Pennsylvania; some  one hundred miles distant. I inquired for his father, or for any of  the family. He told me that his father had gone a journey; but that  his residence was a small house just before me; and, said he, I am  his brother. It was Mr. Hyrum Smith. I informed him of the interest  I felt in the Book, and of my desire to learn more about it. He  welcomed me to his house, and we spent the night together; for  neither of us felt disposed to sleep. We conversed most of the  night, during which I unfolded to him much of my experience in my  search after truth, and my success so far; together with that which  I felt was lacking, viz: a commissioned priesthood, or apostleship  to minister in the ordinances of God.    He also unfolded to me the particulars of the discovery of the  Book; its translation; the rise of the Church of Latter-day Saints,  and the commission of his brother Joseph, and others, by revelation  and the ministering of angels, by which the apostleship and  authority had been again"]]]
