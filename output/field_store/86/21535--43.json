Dixon, Winnsboro, S.C._    Adeline Hall's husband was Tom Johnson but she prefers to be called  \"Hall\", the name of her old master. Adeline lives with her daughter,  Emma, and Emma's six children, about ten miles southeast of Winnsboro,  S.C., in a three-room frame house on the Durham place, a plantation  owned by Mr. A.M. Owens of Winnsboro. The plantation contains 1,500  acres, populated by over sixty Negroes, run as a diversified farm, under  the supervision of a white overseer in the employ of Mr. Owens.    The wide expanse of cotton and corn fields, the large number of dusky  Negro laborers working along side by side in the fields and singing  Negro spirituals as they work, give a fair presentation or picture of  what slavery was like on a well conducted Southern plantation before the  Civil War. Adeline fits into this picture as the old Negro \"Mauma\" of  the plantation, respected by all, white and black, and tenderly cared  for. She has her clay pipe and stick ever with and about her. There is a  spacious pocket in her dress underneath an apron. In that pocket is a  miscellany of broken pieces of china, crumbs of tobacco, a biscuit, a  bit of wire, numerous strings of various colors, and from time to time  the pipe becomes the warm individual member of the varied assortment.    Her eyes are bright and undimmed by age and the vigor with which she can  telegraph her wants to the household by the rappings of that stick on  the plank floor is interesting and amusing.    She is confident that she will round out a century of years, because:  \"Marse Arthur Owens done tell me I'll live to be a hundred, if I stay on  his place and never 'lope away wid any strange young buck nigger.    \"I's not so feeble as I might 'pear, white folks. Long time I suffer for  sight, but dese last years I see just as good as I ever did. Dats a  blessin' from de Lord!    \"Who I b'long to in slavery time? Where I born?

Him have lands in  Chester and Fairfield counties, Georgia and Florida, and one place on de  Red River in Arkansas. He also had a plantation, to raise brown suger  on, in old Louisiana. Then him and his brudder, Daniel, built and give  Bethesda Church, dats standin' yet, to de white Methodis' of Mitford,  for them to 'tend and worship at. He 'membered de Lord, you see, in all  his ways and de Lord guide his steps.    \"I never have to do no field work; just stayed 'round de house and wait  on de mistress, and de chillun.

I clear de  table and help wash de dishes. When dat finish, I cleans up de rooms.  Then I acts as maid and waitress at dinner and supper. I warms up de  girls' room, where they sleep, after supper. Then go home to poppy John  and Mauma Anne. Dat was a happy time, wid happy days!    \"Dat was a happy family.

When Marse Daniel go, Marse William come in dere where me and de  mistress was and say: 'Tom's run away from school'. (Dats one of Marse  Daniel's boys dat 'tended school at Mt.

White folks been laughin' 'bout it ever since. Special talk  'bout it since Marse Tom's grandson b'come a United State Judge. Bet  Marse Dan Hall told you 'bout it. Want me to go ahead and tell you it my  way? Well, 'twas dis a way: Marse Tom and Marse Joe Caldwell fell out  'bout a piece of soap when they was roomin' together at school. Boys  crowd 'round them and say: 'Fight it out!' They hit a lick or two, and  was parted. Then de older boys say dere must be a duel. Marse Joe git  seconds. Marse Tom git seconds. They load guns wid powder but put no  bullets in them. Tell Marse Joe 'bout it but don't tell Marse Tom. Then  they go down town, fix up a bag of pokeberry juice, and have it inside  Marse Joe's westcoat, on his breast. Took them out in a field, face  them, and say: 'One, two, three, fire!' Guns went off, Marse Joe slap  his hand on his chest, and de bag bust. Red juice run all over him.  Older boys say: 'Run Tom and git out de way.' Marse Tom never stop 'til  him git to Liverpool, England. Marse William and Marse Daniel find him  dere, sent money for to fetch him home and him laugh 'bout it when he  git back.

Calculated values, therefore,  represent physiologically possible, not ecologically possible,  intrinsic rates of increase (Hennemann, 1983, 1984; Hayssen, 1984;  McNab, 1984b). Values of n were derived from longevity records for  captive animals, and as these were all large values of similar  duration (14-16 years), they had very little effect on r_{max}. All  species considered have one litter per year, and because their sex  ratios at birth are about 50:50, variation in b was due to differences  in litter size. Therefore, age of first reproduction and litter size  had the greatest effect on r_{max}. Intrinsic rate of increase scales  to body mass (Fenchel, 1974), and we removed this effect by comparing  each calculated r_{max} with the value expected (r_{maxe}) on the  basis of body mass (Hennemann, 1983).        COMPARISON OF ADAPTIVE UNITS      Dimensionless numbers for each of the four variables used in  calculating composite scores were derived as follows. Ratios of  measured to predicted values were used for basal metabolism (H_{br})  and minimum wet thermal conductance (C_{mwr}). Thermoregulatory  ability at low temperatures is closely related to the ratio  H_{br}/C_{mwr} (McNab, 1966). This ratio was used, therefore, to gauge  each species' cold tolerance. For D_{d} we used the ratio of food  categories actually used by a species to the total number of food  categories taken by all species tested (D_{dr}). The ratio of  calculated to expected intrinsic rates of natural increase was used to  derive r_{maxr}. Composite scores were calculated as     Composite score = [(H_{br}/C_{mwr}) + D_{dr} + r_{maxr}]/3     Eq. 3    The correlation between number of climates these species occupy and  their composite scores was tested by linear regression.          $Results$        BODY MASS      According to monthly live-trapping records, the body mass of  free-ranging female raccoons increased from 3.6 +-0.6 kg during summer  to 5.6 +-0.8 kg in early winter, and the mass of free-ranging males  increased from 4.0 +-0.5 to 6.7 +-0.9 kg during the same interval. These  seasonal changes in body mass were due to fluctuations in the amount  of body fat and represent a mechanism for storing energy during fall  for use in winter. In summer, captive and trapped male and captive  female raccoons had the same body mass (4.73 +-0.61, 4.41 +-0.70, and  4.67 +-0.88 kg, respectively, Table 2). Mass of captive females did  not change between seasons, whereas captive males were heavier in  winter than summer (p<0.005; Table 2). This seasonal change in mass of  our captive males was of a much smaller magnitude (0.6 kg) than that  observed for wild males (2.7 kg). During winter, captive males (5.34  +-1.39 kg) were heavier than captive females (4.49 +-0.98 kg; p<0.005;  Table 2). Thus, our captive animals maintained a body mass throughout  the year that was intermediate to the range of values found for wild  raccoons in the same area.

Ratios of these measured values to those predicted by  the Kleiber (1932, 1961:206) equation are 1.28, 1.12, 1.02, 1.17, and  1.09, respectively. To minimize the effect of body size (Mellen, 1963)  and to facilitate comparisons between sexes and seasons and between  captive and trapped animals, basal metabolism also was calculated as a  function of metabolic body size (mL O_{2}.kg^{-0.75}.h^{-1}; Table 2).  Based on this analysis, trapped summer males had a higher basal  metabolism than captive males (p<0.025) or females (p<0.005) in either  season (Table 2). There was no difference in basal metabolism between  captive males and females in either summer or winter, and there was no  seasonal difference in their basal metabolic rates (Table 2).        MINIMUM THERMAL CONDUCTANCE      Minimum wet and dry thermal conductances were calculated using Eqs. 4  and 5     C_{mw} = [.H]_{r} / (T_{b} - T_{a})                            Eq. 4     C_{md} = ([.H]_{r} - [.E]_{eq}) / (T_{b} - T_{a})              Eq. 5    where C_{mw} is wet and C_{md} is dry conductance  (mL O_{2}.g^{-1}.h^{-1}. deg.C^{-1}); [.H]_{r} is the lowest resting  metabolic rate measured at each temperature (mL O_{2}.g^{-1}.h^{-1});  [.E]_{eq} is oxygen equivalent for heat lost by evaporation  [[.E]_{eq} = mL O_{2}.g^{-1}.h^{-1} = [.E].[lambda]/[gamma], where  [.E] is evaporative water loss (mg.g^{-1}.h^{-1}), [lambda] is heat of  vaporization for water (2.43 J/mg), and [gamma] is heat equivalent for  oxygen (20.097 J/mL)]; T_{b} is body temperature ( deg.C); and T_{a} is  chamber air temperature ( deg.C). Only data from animals equipped with  temperature-sensitive radio transmitters were used for these  calculations.

Because evaporative  water loss was not measured at temperatures below freezing, C_{md}  was calculated only from metabolic determinations made at air  temperatures between T_{lc} and 0 deg.C. There was no difference  between males and females in summer for either C_{mw} or C_{md}  (mL O_{2}.g^{-1}.h^{-1}. deg.C^{-1}). Data for each sex were combined  to give a summer average of 0.0256 +-0.0028 for C_{mw}, and 0.0246  +-0.0019 for C_{md} (Table 3). These summer conductances were 49% higher  (p<0.005) than those calculated for winter females (0.0172 +-0.0023, and  0.0161 +-0.0027 for C_{mw} and C_{md}, respectively; Table 3). C_{mw} and  C_{md} were not different from each other in either summer or winter,  which indicated that in both seasons evaporative water loss contributed  very little to heat dissipation at temperatures below T_{n}. Comparisons  of thermal conductances calculated on the basis of metabolic body size  (Mellen, 1963) gave the same results.        EVAPORATIVE WATER LOSS      Evaporative water loss increased as chamber temperature increased in  both summer and winter (Figures 4, 5). In summer, the pattern of  increase was different for females and males. Polynomial regressions  for trapped and captive males produced equations that describe a  concave relationship between T_{a} and evaporative water loss, whereas  the equation for females describes a sigmoid curve (Table 4; Figure 4).  For females, water loss increased rapidly at temperatures above 25 deg.C  (Figure 4). The intercepts and coefficients of the X, X squared, and X cubed terms  of the polynomial regression equations (Table 4) were compared  (_t_-tests) to determine if they differed from each other. The  coefficients in the equation for trapped males differed from those for  captive females in the X squared (p<0.05) and X cubed (p<0.025) terms. The  intercept and coefficients of the equation for captive males, however,  were not different from those for either captive females or trapped  males. Although this lack of difference is understandable in the case  of trapped males, where the shape "]]]
