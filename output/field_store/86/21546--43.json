In a few modest sentences Mr. Churchill       good-humouredly narrated some of the more prominent episodes of       his exploit, and a start was made for his hotel, the       ricksha-boy being assisted more or less by some fifty amateur       ricksha-men and escorted by a majority of the crowd. After       picking up the editor of the _Natal Mercury_ on the way, and       installing him in state by the side of Mr. Churchill, the hotel       was at last reached, and the demand for another speech having       been acceded to, Mr. Churchill was permitted at four o'clock to       retire from the public gaze. The same night he left Durban for       the front.\"    The following is a copy of the letter written by Mr. Winston Churchill  to Mr. de Souza prior to escaping from prison:--        \"STATE SCHOOLS PRISON, PRETORIA.         \"DEAR MR. DE SOUZA,--I do not consider that your Government was       justified in holding me, a press correspondent and a       non-combatant, as a prisoner, and I have consequently resolved       to escape. The arrangements I have succeeded in making with my       friends outside are such as to give me every confidence. But I       wish, in leaving you thus hastily and unceremoniously, to once       more place on record my appreciation of the kindness which has       been shown me and the other prisoners by you, by the       commandant, and by Dr. Gunning, and my admiration of the       chivalrous and humane character of the Republican forces. My       views on the general question of the war remain unchanged, but       I shall always retain a feeling of high respect for the several       classes of the Burghers I have met, and on reaching the British       lines I will set forth a truthful and impartial account of my       experiences in Pretoria. In conclusion, I desire to express my       obligations to you, and to hope that when this most grievous       and unhappy war shall have come to an end, a state of affairs       may be created which shall preserve the national pride of the       Boers and the security of the British, and put a final stop to       the rivalry and enmity of both races. Regretting that       circumstances have not permitted me to bid you a personal       farewell, believe me, yours very sincerely,             \"WINSTON CHURCHILL.         \"_December 11, 1899._\"      CHRISTMAS AT THE CAPE AND NATAL    We had arrived at what might be termed a breathing spell. There was no  serious movement in the direction of the Modder River, and Lord Methuen  was evidently biding his time. General Gatacre felt himself too weak to  take up any very active or offensive step, while General French  contented himself with such harassing and cleverly annoying operations  as kept the enemy, like a man with a mosquito round his nose, from  napping. There was great hope of better things, however, for it was  known that the _Dunottar Castle_ had left England and was conveying to  the Cape--in addition to Lord Roberts--Lord Kitchener and Major-General  T. Kelly-Kenny, the Commander of the Sixth Division. Besides these were  the following officers of Lord Roberts's Staff:--Major-General G. T.  Pretyman; Colonel Viscount Downe, C.I.E.; Major H. V. Cowan; Captain A.  C. M. Waterfield; Major J. F. R. Henderson; Major C. V. Hume;  Brevet-Major G. F. Gorringe, D.S.O.; Colonel Lord Erroll; Commander the  Hon. S. J. Fortescue (Naval Adviser to Lord Roberts); Captain Lord  Herbert Scott; Captain Lord Settrington.    This showed that when at last we set to work we did so with a will. The  forces in South Africa before the war had amounted to 25,000, which  number was augmented by 55,000 on the arrival of the First Army Corps.  Late in December came the Fifth Division of about 11,000, under Sir  Charles Warren, followed by the Sixth Division of 10,000 men. The  Seventh and Eighth Divisions of 10,000 men respectively were shortly to  increase the forces at the disposal of Lord Roberts, together with some  2000 additional Cavalry, 10,000 Yeomanry, 9000 Volunteers, seven  battalions of Militia, drafts for regiments at the front amounting to  10,000, and about 20,000 local forces. The first Colonial contingents  consisted of about 2500 men, and these were to be followed by second  contingents of like strength. The Naval Brigade was composed of about  1000; so that in all, roughly estimated, we were on the eve of putting  184,000 men into the field.    Christmas day at the Cape was solemnised with much speechifying, both  from Dutch pulpits and Dutch partisans, and not a few peacefully  disposed persons in this time of general goodwill lugged in Sir Henry  Campbell-Bannerman by the ears and quoted him to suit their purpose.  That amiable worthy had said the war could have been avoided, and that  cheap and incontrovertible statement the Bond got hold of and chewed and  rolled on the tongue as an accompaniment to its plum-pudding and  mince-pies. Of course, the war could have been avoided. Of course, it  would have been quite possible to voluntarily retire from the Cape and  allow South Africa to become entirely Dutch. In the same way we could  give up governing India and hand it over to Russia and confine our  expenses and our energies to Great Britain, the water supply, the  development of national cookery, and the propagation of cabbages. But  peace with dishonour was fortunately not to the taste of the British  public, and those who spent their Yuletide in active service were far  too devoted to the sacred duty of maintaining the prestige of the Empire  to sigh for the domestic hearth and regal sirloin that might have been  theirs had the Government extended its accommodating apathy a few months  longer.    There were no holly decorations and displays of bunting, no rubbings of  hands and vigorous snow-balling, because the South African sun blazed  with the glare of beaten brass, and the thermometer stood to the height  of some 100 degrees at midday. But there was a vast amount of  joke-making and hearty goodwill nevertheless, and many prayers for  friends and family and Queen.    In Natal there were lively doings in honour of the festal season. At a  time when even cracker manufacturers wax poetic, the journalistic poets  thought it their duty to burst into rhyme. The Natal papers indulged in  some jocose doggerel, which would have been comic had it not been deeply  tragic. The lines ran thus: \"To Ladysmith\"--the only lines, by-the-bye,  that did run there--        \"'Hold the Fort, for I am coming,'        Says the helio--      Quick as light the answer flashes,        'Ain't you coming slow?'\"    But Tommy was pleased and thought the stanza a capital joke. He meant to  get there directly, and merely quoted the proverb about \"slow and  shure\"--there were so many Irishmen about, fine fellows, who believed in  themselves and they were shure about everything. They had nothing to do  with doubt, for doubt, after all, is the mother of diffidence!    And some of these rollicking youngsters managed to retain their native  good-humour in most distressing circumstances. A good story was told of  one gallant private in hospital who had lost his leg but persisted in  apostrophising the missing limb whenever it ached. \"Be aisy wid ye.  Can't ye be quiet? Ye'll niver take me into the foight again. Ohovo!\"    Other examples of amazing good-temper and pluck on the part of the  wounded filled all eye-witnesses with pathetic admiration. One man, a  quondam music-hall singer, carried his jocose art into his sick-bed. A  Boer prisoner had lost his arms, and the poor fellow helplessly shook  his head when offered tobacco. But the music-hall singer saw the shake  of the head and tearful eye that accompanied it. In a moment, with  gymnastic dexterity, he had placed his arms round the Boer and performed  the office of the missing ones, giving the fellow the advantage of a  good smoke. Another of our men who had lost his right arm co-operated  with a Boer who had lost his left, and between them they rolled  cigarettes to the great satisfaction of both. While they were in  hospital another sufferer pretended to be in no way depressed by the  loss of his arm, and ventured on mild whimsicalities regarding the  economy of being able to share a single pair of gloves with any  right-handed man who might also have lost a limb!    [Illustration: LIEUT.-GENERAL FORRESTIER WALKER, K.C.B.    Commanding the Lines of Communication.    Photo by Elliott & Fry, London.]    On the whole, well or ill, Tommy was temporarily in clover. The fat of  the land was being sent out by fervent admirers at home. Indeed he was  getting somewhat inundated with worsted goods which the fair hands of  his countrywomen had been devotedly manufacturing. Jack Tar, despite his  magnificent work, was not so highly distinguished, at least so he  thought, and occasionally vented his disgust into private ears. But,  as one of them said, they'd had a treat for Christmas--the treat of a  wash! It was bathing under difficulties, however, for one half of the  men had to keep guard with loaded rifles while the other half wallowed  in water that, in harmony with the general scheme of things in camp, was  also of kharki hue!    Tommy at the front was externally scarcely the Tommy of our  acquaintance. His bright spick and span exterior was gone. Kharki had  sobered him and planed down his individuality. His uniform no longer sat  without a crease. It was washed and worn and shrunken from hard and  honourable usage, and his carriage was no longer the carriage of Tommy  on parade. He seemed to have taken a leaf out of Jack's book, and the  slight slouch became him well. It gave him the air of a workman and an  individual, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3689"],[0,"Letters of Franz Liszt -- Volume 1 (#6)"],[1,"weeks to two months I shall send you my twelve Studies and  a half-dozen of \"Fantasiestucke\" (\"Impressions et Poemes\")--I  consider them less bad than others of my making. I shall be happy  to think that they do not displease you.    May I confess to you that I was not very much struck with  Henselt's Studies, and that I found them not up to their  reputation? I don't know whether you share my opinion, but they  appear to me, on the whole, very careless. They are pretty to  listen to, they are very pretty to look at, the effect is  excellent, the edition (thanks to our friend Hofmeister) is most  carefully done; but, all counted, I question whether H. is  anything but a distinguished mediocrity. [How highly Liszt  thought, later on, of Henselt's Concerto and other of his  compositions is well known, and is spoken of in a subsequent  letter to Baroness Wrangel, in May, 1883.] For the rest, he is  very young, and will doubtless develop. Let us, at least, hope  so.    I am extremely sorry that I cannot come and pay you a little  visit at Leipzig at present. It is one of my keenest desires to  make your personal acquaintance and to pass some days with you.  But as that is not possible now, let us, at least, try not to be  entirely separated, and let us combat, as far as we can, the  laziness about writing, which is, I think, equally in us both.    In a fortnight I am returning to Venice. I shall be back in Milan  at the time of the coronation (towards the end of August). Next  winter I expect to pass in Rome, if the cholera or some other  plague does not stop it. I will not induce you to come to Italy.  Your sympathies would be too deeply wounded there. If they have  even heard that Beethoven and Weber ever existed, it is as much  as they have done.    Will you not have what you have sent me printed? Haslinger would  have it gladly, I think, and it would be a great pleasure to me  to see my name associated with yours.    If I might make a request, I would ask you to write some trios,  or a quintet or septet. It seems to me that you would do that  admirably, and for a long time nothing remarkable in that line  has been published. If ever you determine to do so, let me know  at once, as I should be anxious to have the honor of making them  known to the public. Adieu, my dear Monsieur Schumann; keep me  always in affectionate remembrance, and accept once more my warm  sympathy and devotion.    F. Liszt        14. To the \"Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde\" in Vienna    [Society of Musical Dilettanti, or Amateur Musical Society.  Autograph in the Archives of the Society in Vienna]    Gentlemen,    I am extremely grateful for the honor you have done me in  admitting me among you as a member of the Vienna Musik-Verein  [Musical Union]. I cannot, unfortunately, flatter myself that I  have as yet deserved this distinction, but allow me to say that  it will not be my fault if I do not become worthy of it.    If ever the occasion should offer in which I can be agreeable or  useful to the Society of the Musik-Verein, be assured that I  shall gladly avail myself of it, and that you will henceforth  have a claim on my gratitude and devotion.    I have the honor to be, gentlemen,    Yours faithfully,    F. Liszt    Venice, June 1st, 1838        15. To Simon Lowy in Vienna    [Autograph in the possession of Herr O. A. Schulz, bookseller in  Leipzig.--Addressed to a Vienna banker, an intimate friend of  Liszt The \"Soirees de Vienne,\" composed on Schubert Valses, are  dedicated to him.]    I am very sensible, my dear sir, of your friendly remembrance.  Your kind letter found me in the midst of the official hurly-  burly of the coronation fetes. What business on earth had I to do  with such an affair? I have not the least idea. Thank Heaven we  are now at the end of it all, safe and sound, rejoicing, and  sated with amusement!    I found at Milan a certain number of my Vienna connections. One  or two of the persons whom you will not mention to me (and whose  anonymity I respect) were also there. I know that a great many of  the people who approach me with a smile on their lips, and  protestations of friendship on their tongues, have nothing better  to do than to pull me to pieces as best they can as soon as they  are outside my door. It is, moreover, the fate of all the world.  I resign myself to it willingly, as I do to all the absurd and  odious necessities of this lower world. There is, besides, just  this much good in these sad experiences of various relations with  men--which is, that one learns to relish and appreciate better  the devotion of the few friends whom chance has thrown in your  path.    In a few days from now I shall start for Bologna, Florence, and  Rome. In spite of all my desire to return to Vienna, where people  have been so kind and indulgent to me, I do not yet see when I  shall be able to get there. However this journey may be put off,  I hope, nevertheless, my dear sir, that you will continue till  then the affectionate feelings you so kindly entertain towards  me. Receive in return my assurances of consideration and  affectionate devotion.    F. Liszt    Milan, September 22nd, 1838    Will you be so good as to give the enclosed note to the charming  woman who is good enough to remember me so kindly?        16. To M. Pacini, Music Publisher in Paris    [Autograph in the possession of M. Alfred Bovet at Valentigney.]    My Dear Monsieur Pacini,    In two or three days at latest from now you will receive the  manuscript for which you asked me for the book of the Hundred and  One. [A collective work with contributions by celebrities of the  day.] Mr. Hugot has kindly undertaken to bring it to you.    As the title implies, it is an Etude (di Bravura) after Paganini.  [Bravura Studies on Paganini's Capricci, arranged for the  pianoforte, brought out by Haslinger, Vienna, in 1839. A second,  newly arranged edition, dedicated to Clara Schumann, \"Grandes  Etudes de Paganini,\" was brought out by Breitkopf and Hartel in  1851.] You will oblige me by recommending the engraver to engrave  it very spaciously. In addition, you had better, I think, reprint  directly afterwards this Etude facilitee, which I have also sent  you. This second arrangement is by M. Schumann, a young composer  of very great merit. It is more within the reach of the general  public, and also more exact than my paraphrase.    Many apologies for having kept you waiting so long for such a  small thing, and kind remembrances to Emilien.    Yours affectionately,    F. Liszt    Please send the corrected proofs of this study to Haslinger,  musical editor to the Court, at Graben, Vienna.    I must have at least two corrected proofs. Prego! Prego!! [I  beg!] leave only such mistakes as are absolutely necessary in  order that an edition may be supposed to be correct.    Padua, September 30th, 1838        17. To Breitkopf and Hartel.    [This is the first of the Liszt letters extant in the archives of  the firm.]    I am really grieved, gentlemen, at the trouble you have been good  enough to take about these unlucky Symphonies, and I hardly know  how to express my acknowledgments. As I have already had the  honor of telling you, Mr. Mori had been previously engaged to  publish these Symphonies, and, as the steps you have taken have  not been crowned with success, I will keep to this first  publisher, with whom I have every reason to be satisfied up to  now.    You can then publish this work in two or three months from now.  [Pianoforte scores of the C minor and Pastoral Symphonies of  Beethoven.] Only it is essential that I should correct the last  proof, so that the edition may be absolutely correct. I also wish  to add the fingering to several passages, to make them easier for  amateurs. Be so good, therefore, as to send me, through the  Embassy (or by any other opportunity which is not too expensive),  two proofs to Rome, where I shall be in about twelve days, and  where I expect to remain till the middle of March.    I hope, gentlemen, that you will not have cause to regret the  obliging advances that you have made to me in this matter, and  for which I am sincerely grateful to you. If you will be so good  as to add to the proofs of the Beethoven Symphonies such of the  songs of Beethoven (or Weber) as you would like me to transcribe  for piano solo, I will then give you a positive answer as to that  little work, which I shall be delighted to do for you, but to  which I cannot assent beforehand, not knowing of which songs you  are the proprietors. If \"Leyer und Schwert\" was published by you,  I will do that with pleasure. I think that these songs, or at any  rate four or five of them, would be rather satisfactory for the  piano.    Accept, gentlemen, the expression of my high esteem.    F. Liszt    Florence, January 3rd, 1839        18. To Princess Christine Belgiojoso in Paris    [Autograph in the possession of M. Alfred Bovet at Valentigney.--  Addressed to the celebrated writer and patriot. In 1837 a charity  concert took place in her salons, at which Liszt and Thalberg  both played.]    It would be self-conceit in me, Princess, to complain of your  silence. Your letters have always been for me a favor, a charm. I  am not meaning to say that I have the slightest right to them.  Nevertheless, as you do not reply to me any more, I hope you will  at least permit me to tell you how very much I feel the very  slightest marks of your kindness, and what a price I set upon  your remembrance.    Some numbers of the Gazette or Revue Musicale, which have  accidentally fallen into my hands at the house of one of my  Russian friends (for in this happy country of the Arts, and of  music in particular, you can well imagine that no one is foolish  enough to spend a thirty francs' subscription on the Revue  Musicale), have informed me that you had decidedly raised altar  for altar, and made your charming salon echo with magnificent  harmonies. I confess that this"]]]
