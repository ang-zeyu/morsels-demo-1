You will notice that the threads have all the beautiful glitter and  luster of the emeralds from which they are made, and so Ozma's new  dress will be the most magnificent the world has ever seen, and quite  fitting for our lovely Ruler of the Fairyland of Oz.\"    Dorothy's eyes were fairly dazed by the brilliance of the emerald  cloth, some of which the girls had already woven.    \"I've never seen ANYthing so beautiful!\" she said, with a sigh.  \"But  tell me, Glinda, what can I give our lovely Ozma on her birthday?\"    The good Sorceress considered this question for a long time before she  replied.  Finally she said:    \"Of course there will be a grand feast at the Royal Palace on Ozma's  birthday, and all our friends will be present.  So I suggest that you  make a fine big birthday cake of Ozma, and surround it with candles.\"    \"Oh, just a CAKE!\" exclaimed Dorothy, in disappointment.    \"Nothing is nicer for a birthday,\" said the Sorceress.    \"How many candles should there be on the cake?\" asked the girl.    \"Just a row of them,\" replied Glinda, \"for no one knows how old Ozma  is, although she appears to us to be just a young girl--as fresh and  fair as if she had lived but a few years.\"    \"A cake doesn't seem like much of a present,\" Dorothy asserted.    \"Make it a surprise cake,\" suggested the Sorceress.  \"Don't you  remember the four and twenty blackbirds that were baked in a pie?  Well, you need not use live blackbirds in your cake, but you could have  some surprise of a different sort.\"    \"Like what?\" questioned Dorothy, eagerly.    \"If I told you, it wouldn't be YOUR present to Ozma, but MINE,\"  answered the Sorceress, with a smile.  \"Think it over, my dear, and I  am sure you can originate a surprise that will add greatly to the joy  and merriment of Ozma's birthday banquet.\"    Dorothy thanked her friend and entered the Red Wagon and told the  Sawhorse to take her back home to the palace in the Emerald City.    On the way she thought the matter over seriously of making a surprise  birthday cake and finally decided what to do.    As soon as she reached home, she went to the Wizard of Oz, who had a  room fitted up in one of the high towers of the palace, where he  studied magic so as to be able to perform such wizardry as Ozma  commanded him to do for the welfare of her subjects.    The Wizard and Dorothy were firm friends and had enjoyed many strange  adventures together.  He was a little man with a bald head and sharp  eyes and a round, jolly face, and because he was neither haughty nor  proud he had become a great favorite with the Oz people.    \"Wizard,\" said Dorothy, \"I want you to help me fix up a present for  Ozma's birthday.\"    \"I'll be glad to do anything for you and for Ozma,\" he answered.  \"What's on your mind, Dorothy?\"    \"I'm going to make a great cake, with frosting and candles, and all  that, you know.\"    \"Very good,\" said the Wizard.    \"In the center of this cake I'm going to leave a hollow place, with  just a roof of the frosting over it,\" continued the girl.    \"Very good,\" repeated the Wizard, nodding his bald head.    \"In that hollow place,\" said Dorothy, \"I want to hide a lot of monkeys  about three inches high, and after the cake is placed on the banquet  table, I want the monkeys to break through the frosting and dance  around on the table-cloth.  Then, I want each monkey to cut out a piece  of cake and hand it to a guest.\"    \"Mercy me!\" cried the little Wizard, as he chuckled with laughter.  \"Is  that ALL you want, Dorothy?\"    \"Almost,\" said she.  \"Can you think of anything more the little monkeys  can do, Wizard?\"    \"Not just now,\" he replied.  \"But where will you get such tiny monkeys?\"    \"That's where you're to help me,\" said Dorothy.  \"In some of those wild  forests in the Gillikin Country are lots of monkeys.\"    \"Big ones,\" said the Wizard.    \"Well, you and I will go there, and we'll get some of the big monkeys,  and you will make them small--just three inches high--by means of your  magic, and we'll put the little monkeys all in a basket and bring them  home with us.  Then you'll train them to dance--up here in your room,  where no one can see them--and on Ozma's birthday we'll put 'em into  the cake and they'll know by that time just what to do.\"    The Wizard looked at Dorothy with admiring approval, and chuckled again.    \"That's really clever, my dear,\" he said, \"and I see no reason why we  can't do it, just the way you say, if only we can get the wild monkeys  to agree to it.\"    \"Do you think they'll object?\" asked the girl.    \"Yes; but perhaps we can argue them into it.  Anyhow it's worth trying,  and I'll help you if you'll agree to let this Surprise Cake be a  present to Ozma from you and me together.  I've been wondering what I  could give Ozma, and as I've got to train the monkeys as well as make  them small, I think you ought to make me your partner.\"    \"Of course,\" said Dorothy; \"I'll be glad to do so.\"    \"Then it's a bargain,\" declared the Wizard.  \"We must go to seek those  monkeys at once, however, for it will take time to train them and we'll  have to travel a good way to the Gillikin forests where they live.\"    \"I'm ready to go any time,\" agreed Dorothy.  \"Shall we ask Ozma to let  us take the Sawhorse?\"    The Wizard did not answer that at once.  He took time to think of the  suggestion.    \"No,\" he answered at length, \"the Red Wagon couldn't get through the  thick forests and there's some danger to us in going into the wild  places to search for monkeys.  So I propose we take the Cowardly Lion  and the Hungry Tiger.  We can ride on their backs as well as in the Red  Wagon, and if there is danger to us from other beasts, these two  friendly champions will protect us from all harm.\"    \"That's a splendid idea!\" exclaimed Dorothy.  \"Let's go now and ask the  Hungry Tiger and the Cowardly Lion if they will help us.  Shall we ask  Ozma if we can go?\"    \"I think not,\" said the Wizard, getting his hat and his black bag of  magic tools.  \"This is to be a surprise for her birthday, and so she  mustn't know where we're going.  We'll just leave word, in case Ozma  inquires for us, that we'll be back in a few days.\"          7.  The Forest of Gugu      In the central western part of the Gillikin Country is a great tangle  of trees called Gugu Forest.  It is the biggest forest in all Oz and  stretches miles and miles in every direction--north, south, east and  west.  Adjoining it on the east side is a range of rugged mountains  covered with underbrush and small twisted trees.  You can find this  place by looking at the Map of the Land of Oz.    Gugu Forest is the home of most of the wild beasts that inhabit Oz.  These are seldom disturbed in their leafy haunts because there is no  reason why Oz people should go there, except on rare occasions, and  most parts of the forest have never been seen by any eyes but the eyes  of the beasts who make their home there.  The biggest beasts inhabit  the great forest, while the smaller ones live mostly in the mountain  underbrush at the east.    Now, you must know that there are laws in the forests, as well as in  every other place, and these laws are made by the beasts themselves,  and are necessary to keep them from fighting and tearing one another to  pieces.  In Gugu Forest there is a King--an enormous yellow leopard  called \"Gugu\"--after whom the forest is named.  And this King has three  other beasts to advise him in keeping the laws and maintaining  order--Bru the Bear, Loo the Unicorn and Rango the Gray Ape--who are  known as the King's Counselors.  All these are fierce and ferocious  beasts, and hold their high offices because they are more intelligent  and more feared then their fellows.    Since Oz became a fairyland, no man, woman or child ever dies in that  land nor is anyone ever sick.  Likewise the beasts of the forests never  die, so that long years add to their cunning and wisdom, as well as to  their size and strength.  It is possible for beasts--or even people--to  be destroyed, but the task is so difficult that it is seldom attempted.  Because it is free from sickness and death is one reason why Oz is a  fairyland, but it is doubtful whether those who come to Oz from the  outside world, as Dorothy and Button-Bright and Trot and Cap'n Bill and  the Wizard did, will live forever or cannot be injured.  Even Ozma is  not sure about this, and so the guests of Ozma from other lands are  always carefully protected from any danger, so as to be on the safe  side.    In spite of the laws of the forests there are often fights among the  beasts; some of them have lost an eye or an ear or even had a leg torn  off.  The King and the King's Counselors always punish those who start  a fight, but so fierce is the nature of some beasts that they will at  times fight in spite of laws and punishment.    Over this vast, wild Forest of Gugu flew two eagles, one morning, and  near the center of the jungle the eagles alighted on a branch of a tall  tree.    \"Here is the place for us to begin our work,\" said one, who was  Ruggedo, the Nome.    \"Do many beasts live here?\" asked Kiki Aru, the other eagle.    \"The forest is full of them,\" said the Nome.  \"There are enough beasts  right here to enable us to conquer the people of Oz, if we can get them  to consent to join us.  To do that, we must go among them and tell them  our plans, so we must now decide on what shapes we had better assume  while in the forest.\"    \"I suppose we must take the shapes of beasts?\" said Kiki.    \"Of course.  But that requires some thought.  All kinds of beasts live  here, and a yellow leopard is King.  If we become leopards, the King  will be jealous of us.  If we take the forms of some of the other  beasts, we shall not command proper respect.\"    \"I wonder if the beasts will attack us?\" asked Kiki.    \"I'm a Nome, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41934"],[0,"Idling in Italy: Studies of literature and of life (#6)"],[1," When the  heroine dies the mother realizes her sin in having borne the child and  in having betrayed her.    It would be difficult to imagine anything more disagreeable than the  story. The only thing that can be said is that it is well told, but what  does it advantage one to read it? As Henry James said, no one is  compelled to admire any particular sort of writing, but surely there  must be compulsion to make one write them. And as Flaubert, whom Oriani  probably called master, wrote: \"Such books are false; nature is not like  that.\"    Oriani lived a singularly isolated life, having little contact with his  fellow workers and little recognition. But he was a thinker and  idealist, and it is unfortunate that he did not choose more attractive  media to present his thought and project his aspirations. Only after his  death did he begin to get any measure of appreciation. The four wars  against Austria, the final charge against the Alps, foreseen and invoked  by Oriani, were the conditions of his recognition by the Italian people.    The most widely read of all Italian writers of this period was Edmondo  de Amicis (1846-1908). His books, \"Bozzetti Militari\" (\"Military Life\"),  which appeared shortly after his period of service in the army, and the  book for boys entitled \"Cuore\" (\"Heart\"), had a tremendous sale and  still have. They were also widely read outside of Italy. He wrote many  books of travel, some poetry, literary portraits, and short stories.  However, he made no particular impression upon the literary period of  his time.    Guido Mazzoni, born in 1859, was, and perhaps still is, professor at the  University of Florence. He has been for many years secretary of the  Crusca and senator of the realm. His critical work is \"L'Ottocento.\" His  poetry is of the familiar variety. \"Sewing-machine\" is one of them. He  is an excellent example of the culture of the Italians, but he has made  no lasting impression upon Italian letters. He is best known in this  country from Papini's gibes at him and at the Crusca. His recent  contributions, \"The Lament of Achilles\" and \"Con Gli Alpini\" (\"With the  Alpini\"), are of the eminently respectable, commendable, poet-laureate  variety, called forth by valorous deeds of Italy's soldier sons.    Nothing shows the flight from romanticism to realism that took place at  the end of the nineteenth century so clearly as its stage literature.  The dominating figure of that period was Giuseppe Giacosa. He was not  alone the most prolific contributor to the literature of the theatre,  but a man who early excited and kept the admiration and affection of  fellow artists. He can truthfully be called the literary mirror of that  period in Italy.    The lamp of enthusiasm was flickering when he first put secure steps  upon the literary road, but it lighted him to a great success in \"Una  Partita a Scacchi\" (\"A Game of Chess\"). Then the car of realism came  along with a rush, as if it would carry everything in its wake, and he  threw a great bouquet into the tonneau in the shape of \"Surrender at  Discretion.\" But his ear was always to the ground, and, when he sensed  the advent of a new literary period and learned of the existence of  readers that did not know just what they wanted but thought they would  like to have the truth, the naked truth of life as depicted in fiction,  he wrote \"Sad Loves.\" But the Veristic period did not last long, and  Giacosa took leave of it without a tear. Pascoli and D'Annunzio had not  only entered idealistic realism in the literary race, but they were  shouting in the most vociferous way for the latter especially to win.  When Giacosa became fully cognizant of the favorite colors he was quick  to make his entry with \"As the Leaves\" and \"Il Piu Forte\" (\"The  Stronger\").    The play to which he owed his first success, \"A Game of Chess,\" had a  remarkable career in Italy, and it still makes leading appeal to  extravagant youth and romantic maturity, who see, in the lovely Iolande  or in the dashing Fernando, prototypes who solve perplexing problems of  life with an ease and readiness that is soul-satisfying. They also see  in their experiences the smouldering or dying embers of their own  passions, whose articulate breathings cause them to glow consumingly and  pleasantly.    Its success turned the author from law, which he despised, to  literature, which he adored.    His next play, \"Il Trionfe d'Amore\" (\"The Triumph of Love\"), was along  the same lines: life without sorrow or strife save such as make  pleasure--which bulks large in life--sweeter. Within a few years Giacosa  began to depict life as it really was, is, or should be, and the first  indication of it was \"Il Conte rosso\" (\"The Red Count\"), and for a  decade he gave himself to the production of historical plays none of  which can be used to-day as a wreath on the monument to his memory. It  was not until he wrote \"Resa a Discrezione\" (\"Surrender at Discretion\"),  that he came into the field which he finally tilled so profitably,  holding up to the contemptuous, scornful gaze of the people the useless,  iniquitous, pernicious existences of a certain class, the noble. In this  he did the same thing that he had done in his masterpiece, \"As the  Leaves.\" But here he portrayed flesh and blood confronted with problems  conditioned by life, called chance. Instead of desperation and whetted  appetite for sensuous appeasement, we see latent character budding and  flowering under the stimulus of adversity; virtue which does not lose  its aroma from enforced tarry in putrid milieu; the deadly sins, rooted  in ancestral emotions and nurtured by environment displayed in the  conduct of human beings of our acquaintance and our intimacy; we see the  exaltation and the deprecation of viciousness just as we see it and  accomplish it in real life. The literary features of the lines, the  crispness and naturalness of the dialogue, the fidelity with which he  reflected the handling of problems likely to confront any one show the  finished artist.    Giacosa was a conspicuous literary figure of yesterday's Italy, friend  of poets and philosopher, journalist, essayist, lecturer, man of the  world, mirror of one side of its mental and emotional activity.    Next to Verga the Verists found their chief exponent in Luigi Capuana, a  Sicilian born in 1839 and still living. He wrote romances, short  stories, plays, and criticisms, none of which save the latter had great  vogue, though one of his plays, \"Malia\" (\"Enchantment\"), gave such  offense to Mrs. Grundy that it had great popularity. Like Verga he knows  his countrymen and women, particularly their emotional reactions and the  conduct conditioned by it, by their inheritancy, and by their  environment. Many of his short stories are gems of construction and of  narrative. For instance, \"Passa l'Amore,\" in \"Il buon Pastore\" (\"The  Good Pastor\"), is a masterly delineation of the struggle between what is  usually called good and evil in the person of a saintly old priest. Love  had been an abstract conception for the good pastor until he essayed to  reclaim a lamb who had been driven from the fold by the efforts of a  cruel father intensively to prepare her for sacrifice at the hands of  Cavalier Ferro. Perhaps if Capuana had not been content with merely  interesting and diverting the public, as he counselled Bracco to be, and  had tried to teach them and lead them he would have greater renown. As  it is he is one of the best short-story writers of Italy, a discerning,  trustworthy critic, who has written an interesting volume of studies in  contemporary literature, and several plays, the last of which, \"Il  Paraninfo\" (\"The Best-man\"), has recently been published. Nevertheless  he must be considered a writer whose potentialities were but partially  realized.    Two realistic writers of the end of the nineteenth century must be  mentioned, though their work scarcely merits discussion and to do so may  be unjust to others. They are Gerolamo Rovetta and Marco Praga. Although  the former wrote criticisms, interpretations, and romances, some of  which had much success, the contributions by which he is best known are  his plays. Rovetta studied contemporary life and depicted it for the  stage. His first success, the one upon which his reputation as a man of  letters most solidly rests, \"La Trilogia di Dorina\" (\"Dorina's  Trilogy\"), presents the public pie, upper and lower crust and middle,  quite as Zola might have made it. His favorite theme was that man is but  a reaction to his environment, expounded particularly in \"I Disonesti\"  (\"Dishonest Men\"), though his greatest popular success was  \"Romanticismo\" (\"Romanticism\"), which was a contribution to \"idealistic  reaction\" which would turn us from ugly verities of life. It has been  said by competent authorities to be a faithful presentation of public  and private sentiment existing in northern Italy previous to her  deliverance from tyrannical Austria.    Marco Praga is the son of Emilio Praga, who was the best-known Bohemian  poet of Italy in his day (1839-1875), but who abandoned writing to teach  dramatic literature in the Conservatory of Music in Milan. He professes  to be the dramatic mirror held up to life and to tell the truth as he  sees it, that he cannot be persuaded to camouflage it, and that when it  is depicted on the stage it shall amuse rather than distress. That is  what makes his most successful plays, such as \"Le Vergini\" (\"The  Virgins\") and \"La Moglie Ideale\" (\"The Ideal Wife\"), depressing reading.  Such conduct as they depict and such exchange of thought and sentiment  as they report undoubtedly exist, but the less one knows of it and comes  in contact with it the happier he or she is likely to be. If adultery  could only be made a virtue for a few years, it would lose its  attractiveness and many writers would have to earn their living.
