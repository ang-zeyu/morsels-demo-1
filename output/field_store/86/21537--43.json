In the same year he was appointed secretary to the commission  for treating with the Indian tribes at Chicago, and on the conclusion  of his labors published his sixth work, entitled Travels in the  Central Portions of the Mississippi Valley, in which he described the  country between the regions of which he had given an account in his  previous works. His reputation was now widely and firmly established  as an explorer, and as a man of science and letters. From this time  his attention was devoted principally to the Red Race, though he still  cultivated natural history, and wrote occasionally for the reviews and  magazines.    In 1822 he was appointed by President Monroe agent for Indian Affairs,  to reside at St. Mary's, at the foot of Lake Superior. In the years  1825, 1826, and 1827, he attended the important convocations of the  north-west tribes at Prairie du Chien, Pont du Lac, and Buttes des  Morts. In 1831 he was sent on a special embassy, accompanied by  troops, to conciliate the Sioux and Ojibwas, and bring the existing  war between them to a close. In 1832 he proceeded in the same capacity  to the tribes near the head waters of the Mississippi, and availed  himself of the opportunity to trace that river, in small canoes, from  the point where Pike stopped in 1807 and Cass in 1820 to its true  source in Itasca Lake, upon which he entered on the thirteenth of  July, the one hundred and forty-ninth anniversary of the discovery of  the mouth of the river by La Salle. His account of this tour was  published in New-York in 1834, under the title of An Expedition to  Itasca Lake, and attracted much attention in all parts of the country.    From 1827 to 1831 Mr. Schoolcraft was a member of the legislative  council of Michigan. In 1828 he organized the Michigan Historical  Society, in which he was elected president, on the removal of General  Cass to Washington, in 1831. In the fall of the same year he set on  foot the Algic Society at Detroit, before which he delivered a course  of lectures on the grammatical construction of the Indian  languages,[1] and at its first anniversary a poem on The Indian  Character. Guided by patriotism and good taste, he took a successful  stand in the west against the absurd nomenclature which has elsewhere  made such confusion in geography by repeating over and over the names  of European places and characters, giving us Romes, Berlins, and  Londons in the wilderness, and Hannibals, Scipios, Homers, and  Hectors, wherever there was sufficient learning to make its possessors  ridiculous. He submitted to the legislature of the territory a system  of county and township names based upon the Indian vocabularies with  which he was familiar, and happily secured its general adoption.    At Sault Ste. Marie Mr. Schoolcraft became acquainted with Mr. John  Johnston, a gentleman from the north of Ireland, who had long resided  there, and in the person of his eldest daughter married a descendant  of the hereditary chief of Lake Superior, or Lake Algoma, as it is  known to the Indians. She had been educated in Europe, and was an  accomplished and highly interesting woman. After a residence there of  eleven years he removed to Michilimackinac, and assumed the joint  agency of the two districts. In 1836 he was appointed by President  Jackson a commissioner to treat with the north-west tribes for their  lands in the region of the upper lakes, and succeeded in effecting a  cession to the United States of some sixteen millions of acres. In the  same year he was appointed acting Superintendent of Indian Affairs for  the Northern Department, and in 1839 principal disbursing agent for  the same district.    In the last mentioned year he published two volumes of Algic  Researches, comprising Indian Tales and Legends, and soon after,  having passed more than twenty years as a traveller or resident on the  frontiers, he removed to the city of New-York, intending to prepare  for the press the great mass of his original papers which he had  accumulated in this long period. In 1841 he issued proposals for an  Indian Cyclopedia, geographical, historical, philological, etc., of  which only one number was printed, no publisher appearing willing to  undertake so costly and extensive a work of such a description. In  1842 he visited England, France, Germany, Prussia, and Holland. During  his absence his wife died, at Dundee, in Canada West, where she was  visiting her sister. Soon after his return he made another journey to  the west, to examine some of the great mounds, respecting which he has  since communicated a paper to the Royal Geographical Society of  Denmark, of which he was many years ago elected an honorary member,  and soon after published a collection of his poetical writings, under  the title of Alhalla, or the Lord of Talladega, a Tale of the Creek  War, with some miscellanies, chiefly of early date. In 1844 he  commenced in numbers the publication of Oneota, or the Red Race in  America, their History, Traditions, Customs, Poetry, Picture Writing,  etc., in extracts from Notes, Journals, and other unpublished  writings, of which one octavo volume has been completed. In 1845 he  delivered an address before a society known as the \"Was-ah  Ho-de-no-sonne, or New Confederacy of the Iroquois,\" and published  Observations on the Grave Creek Mound in Western Virginia, in the  Transactions of the American Ethnological Society; and early in the  following year presented in the form of a Report to the legislature of  his native state, his Notes on the Iroquois, or Contributions to the  Statistics, Aboriginal History, and General Ethnology of Western  New-York.    The last and most important of Mr. Schoolcraft's works, the crowning  labor of his life, for the composition of which all his previous  efforts were but notes of preparation, is the Historical and  Statistical Information respecting the History, Condition, and  Prospects of the Indian Tribes of the United States: Collected and  prepared under the Direction of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, per act  of March 3, 1847. The initial volume of this important national  publication, profusely illustrated with engravings from drawings by  Captain Eastman, of the Army, has lately been issued in a very large  and splendid quarto, by Lippincott. Grambo & Co., of Philadelphia,  under authority of Congress. It embraces the general, national, and  tribal history of the Indian race, with their traditions, manners,  customs, languages, mythology, &c., and when completed will probably  extend to six or seven volumes. Until more of it is published, it will  not be possible to form any exact judgment of it, except such as is  warranted by a knowledge of the author's previous works: but such a  judgment must be in the highest degree favorable.    Mr. Schoolcraft's ethnological writings are among the most important  contributions that have been made to the literature of this country.  His long and intimate connection with the Indian tribes, and the  knowledge possessed by his wife and her family of the people from whom  they were descended by the maternal side, with his power of examining  their character from the European point of view, have enabled him to  give us more authentic and valuable information respecting their  manners, customs, and physical traits, and more insight into their  moral and intellectual constitution, than can be derived, perhaps,  from all other authors. His works abound in materials for the future  artist and man of letters, and will on this account continue to be  read when the greater portion of the popular literature of the day is  forgotten. With the forests which they inhabited, the red race have  disappeared with astonishing rapidity. Until recently they have rarely  been the subjects of intelligent study; and it began to be regretted,  as they were seen fading from our sight, that there was so little  written respecting them that had any pretensions to fidelity. I would  not be understood to undervalue the productions of Eliot, Loskiel,  Heckewelder, Brainerd, and other early missionaries, but they were  restricted in design, and it is not to be denied that confidence in  their representations has been much impaired, less perhaps from doubts  of their integrity than of their ability and of the advantages of the  points of view from which they made their observations. The works on  Indian philology by Roger Williams and the younger Edwards are more  valuable than any others of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,  but it now appears that these authors knew very little of the  philosophy of the American language. Du Ponceau's knowledge was still  more superficial, and excepting Mr. Gallatin and the late Mr.  Pickering, who made use of the imperfect data furnished by others, I  believe no one besides Mr. Schoolcraft has recently produced any thing  on the subject worthy of consideration. Something has been done by  General Cass, and Mr. McKenny and Mr. Catlin have undoubtedly  accomplished much in this department of ethnography; but allowing all  that can reasonably be claimed for these artist-travellers, Mr.  Schoolcraft must still be regarded as the standard and chief authority  respecting the Algic tribes.    The influence which the original and peculiar myths and historical  traditions of the Indians is to have on our imaginative literature,  has been recently more than ever exhibited in the works of our  authors. The tendency of the public taste to avail itself of the  American mythology as a basis for the exhibition of \"new lines of  fictitious creations\" has been remarked by Mr. Schoolcraft himself in  Oneota, and he refers to the tales of Mrs. Oakes Smith, and to the  Wild Scenes in the Forest and the Prairie, and the Vigil of Faith, by  Mr. Charles F. Hoffman, as works in which this tendency is most  distinctly perceptible. In the writings of W. H. C. Hosmer, the  legends of Mr. Whittier, and some of the poems of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3623"],[0,"The Golden Bough: A Study of Magic and Religion (#6)"],[1,"the  sequence of events throughout the world, it may be called  Theoretical Magic: regarded as a set of precepts which human beings  observe in order to compass their ends, it may be called Practical  Magic. At the same time it is to be borne in mind that the  primitive magician knows magic only on its practical side; he never  analyses the mental processes on which his practice is based, never  reflects on the abstract principles involved in his actions. With  him, as with the vast majority of men, logic is implicit, not  explicit: he reasons just as he digests his food in complete  ignorance of the intellectual and physiological processes which are  essential to the one operation and to the other. In short, to him  magic is always an art, never a science; the very idea of science  is lacking in his undeveloped mind. It is for the philosophic  student to trace the train of thought which underlies the  magician's practice; to draw out the few simple threads of  which the tangled skein is composed; to disengage the abstract  principles from their concrete applications; in short, to discern  the spurious science behind the bastard art.    If my analysis of the magician's logic is correct, its two great  principles turn out to be merely two different misapplications of  the association of ideas. Homoeopathic magic is founded on the  association of ideas by similarity: contagious magic is founded on  the association of ideas by contiguity. Homoeopathic magic commits  the mistake of assuming that things which resemble each other are  the same: contagious magic commits the mistake of assuming that  things which have once been in contact with each other are always in  contact. But in practice the two branches are often combined; or, to  be more exact, while homoeopathic or imitative magic may be  practised by itself, contagious magic will generally be found to  involve an application of the homoeopathic or imitative principle.  Thus generally stated the two things may be a little difficult to  grasp, but they will readily become intelligible when they are  illustrated by particular examples. Both trains of thought are in  fact extremely simple and elementary. It could hardly be otherwise,  since they are familiar in the concrete, though certainly not in the  abstract, to the crude intelligence not only of the savage, but of  ignorant and dull-witted people everywhere. Both branches of magic,  the homoeopathic and the contagious, may conveniently be  comprehended under the general name of Sympathetic Magic, since both  assume that things act on each other at a distance through a secret  sympathy, the impulse being transmitted from one to the other by  means of what we may conceive as a kind of invisible ether, not  unlike that which is postulated by modern science for a precisely  similar purpose, namely, to explain how things can physically affect  each other through a space which appears to be empty.    It may be convenient to tabulate as follows the branches of  magic according to the laws of thought which underlie them:                       Sympathetic Magic                     (Law of Sympathy)                             |              -------------------------------              |                             |      Homoeopathic Magic             Contagious Magic      (Law of Similarity)            (Law of Contact)      I will now illustrate these two great branches of sympathetic  magic by examples, beginning with homoeopathic magic.        2. Homoeopathic or Imitative Magic    PERHAPS the most familiar application of the principle that like  produces like is the attempt which has been made by many peoples in  many ages to injure or destroy an enemy by injuring or destroying an  image of him, in the belief that, just as the image suffers, so does  the man, and that when it perishes he must die. A few instances out  of many may be given to prove at once the wide diffusion of the  practice over the world and its remarkable persistence through the  ages. For thousands of years ago it was known to the sorcerers of  ancient India, Babylon, and Egypt, as well as of Greece and Rome,  and at this day it is still resorted to by cunning and malignant  savages in Australia, Africa, and Scotland. Thus the North American  Indians, we are told, believe that by drawing the figure of a person  in sand, ashes, or clay, or by considering any object as his body,  and then pricking it with a sharp stick or doing it any other  injury, they inflict a corresponding injury on the person  represented. For example, when an Ojebway Indian desires to work  evil on any one, he makes a little wooden image of his enemy and  runs a needle into its head or heart, or he shoots an arrow into it,  believing that wherever the needle pierces or the arrow strikes the  image, his foe will the same instant be seized with a sharp pain in  the corresponding part of his body; but if he intends to kill the  person outright, he burns or buries the puppet, uttering certain  magic words as he does so. The Peruvian Indians moulded images of  fat mixed with grain to imitate the persons whom they disliked or  feared, and then burned the effigy on the road where the intended  victim was to pass. This they called burning his soul.    A Malay charm of the same sort is as follows. Take parings of nails,  hair, eyebrows, spittle, and so forth of your intended victim,  enough to represent every part of his person, and then make them up  into his likeness with wax from a deserted bees' comb. Scorch the  figure slowly by holding it over a lamp every night for seven  nights, and say:       \"It is not wax that I am scorching,    It is the liver, heart, and spleen of So-and-so that I scorch.\"      After the seventh time burn the figure, and your victim will die.  This charm obviously combines the principles of homoeopathic and  contagious magic; since the image which is made in the likeness of  an enemy contains things which once were in contact with him,  namely, his nails, hair, and spittle. Another form of the Malay  charm, which resembles the Ojebway practice still more closely, is  to make a corpse of wax from an empty bees' comb and of the length  of a footstep; then pierce the eye of the image, and your enemy is  blind; pierce the stomach, and he is sick; pierce the head, and his  head aches; pierce the breast, and his breast will suffer. If you  would kill him outright, transfix the image from the head downwards;  enshroud it as you would a corpse; pray over it as if you were  praying over the dead; then bury it in the middle of a path where  your victim will be sure to step over it. In order that his blood  may not be on your head, you should say:          \"It is not I who am burying him,       It is Gabriel who is burying him.\"      Thus the guilt of the murder will be laid on the shoulders of the  archangel Gabriel, who is a great deal better able to bear it than  you are.    If homoeopathic or imitative magic, working by means of images, has  commonly been practised for the spiteful purpose of putting  obnoxious people out of the world, it has also, though far more  rarely, been employed with the benevolent intention of helping  others into it. In other words, it has been used to facilitate  childbirth and to procure offspring for barren women. Thus among the  Bataks of Sumatra a barren woman, who would become a mother, will  make a wooden image of a child and hold it in her lap, believing  that this will lead to the fulfilment of her wish. In the Babar  Archipelago, when a woman desires to have a child, she invites a man  who is himself the father of a large family to pray on her behalf to  Upulero, the spirit of the sun. A doll is made of red cotton, which  the woman clasps in her arms, as if she would suckle it. Then the  father of many children takes a fowl and holds it by the legs to the  woman's head, saying, \"O Upulero, make use of the fowl; let fall,  let descend a child, I beseech you, I entreat you, let a child fall  and descend into my hands and on my lap.\" Then he asks the woman,  \"Has the child come?\" and she answers, \"Yes, it is sucking already.\"  After that the man holds the fowl on the husband's head, and mumbles  some form of words. Lastly, the bird is killed and laid, together  with some betel, on the domestic place of sacrifice. When the  ceremony is over, word goes about in the village that the woman has  been brought to bed, and her friends come and congratulate her. Here  the pretence that a child has been born is a purely magical rite  designed to secure, by means of imitation or mimicry, that a child  really shall be born; but an attempt is made to add to the efficacy  of the rite by means of prayer and sacrifice. To put it otherwise,  magic is here blent with and reinforced by religion.    Among some of the Dyaks of Borneo, when a woman is in hard labour,  a wizard is called in, who essays to facilitate the delivery in a  rational manner by manipulating the body of the sufferer. Meantime  another wizard outside the room exerts himself to attain the same  end by means which we should regard as wholly irrational. He, in  fact, pretends to be the expectant mother; a large stone attached to  his stomach by a cloth wrapt round his body represents the child in  the womb, and, following the directions shouted to him by his  colleague on the real scene of operations, he moves this  make-believe baby about on his body in exact imitation of the  movements of the real baby till the infant is born.    The same principle of make-believe, so dear to children, has led  other peoples to employ a simulation of birth as a form of adoption,  and even as a mode of restoring a supposed dead person to life. If  you pretend to give birth to a boy, or even to a great bearded man  who has not a drop of your blood in his veins, then, in the eyes of  primitive law and philosophy, that boy or man is really your son to  all intents and purposes. Thus Diodorus "]]]
