[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3819"],[0,"The Euahlayi Tribe: A Study of Aboriginal Life in Australia (#6)"],[1,", in the first place, is to the Euahlayi what the 'Alcheringa' or  'Dream time' is to the Arunta. Asked for the reason why of anything,  the Arunta answer, 'It was so in the Alcheringa.' Our tribe have a  subsidiary myth corresponding to that of the Alcheringa. There was an  age, in their opinion, when only birds and beasts were on earth; but a  colossal man and two women came from the remote north-east, changed  birds and beasts into men and women, made other folk of clay or stone,  taught them everything, and left laws for their guidance, then  returned whence they came. This is a kind of 'Alcheringa' myth, but  whether this colossal man was Byamee or not, our tribe give, as the  final answer to any question about the origin of customs, 'Because  Byamee say so.' Byamee declared his will, and that was and is enough  for his children. At the Boorah, or initiatory ceremonies, he is  proclaimed as 'Father of All, whose laws the tribes are now obeying.'  Byamee, at least in one myth (told also by the Wir djuri), is the  original source of all totems, and of the law that people of the same  totem may not intermarry, 'however far apart their hunting-grounds.' I  heard first in a legend, then received confirmation from all old  blacks, that Byamee had a totem name for every part of his body, even  to a different one for each finger and toe. And when he was passing on  to fresh fields, he gave each kinship of the tribe he was leaving one  of his totems. The usual version is, that to such as were metamorphosed  from birds and animals he gave as totem the animal or whatever it was  from which they were evolved. But no one dreams of claiming Byamee as a  relation belonging to one clan; he is one apart and yet the father of  all, even as Birrahgnooloo is mother of all and not related to any one  clan; Cunnumbeillee, his other wife, had only one totem.    Certainly woman is given a high place in their sacred lore. The chief  wife of Byamee, Birrahgnooloo, is claimed as the mother of all, for  she, like him, had a totem for each part of her body; no one totem can  claim her, but all do.    Mother of all, though mother of none in particular, she was not to be  vulgarised by ordinary domestic relations, For those purposes  Cunnumbeillee was at hand, as a bearer of children and a caterer. Yet  it was Birrahgnooloo whom Byamee best loved and made his companion,  giving her power and position which no other held. She too, like him,  is partially crystallised in the sky-camp, where they are together; the  upper parts of their bodies are as on earth; to her, those who want  floods go, and when willing to grant their requests, she bids  Cunnumbeillee start the flood-ball of flood rolling down the mountains.  Cunnumbeillee, as has been said, had but one totem which her children  derived from her.    Byamee is the originator of things less archaic and important than  totemism. There is a large stone fish-trap at Brewarrina, on the Barwan  River. It is said to have been made by Byamee and his gigantic sons,  just as later Greece attributed the walls of Tiryns to the Cyclops, or  as Glasgow Cathedral has been explained in legend as the work of the  Picts. Byamee also established the rule that there should be a common  camping-ground for the various tribes, where, during the fishing  festival, peace should be strictly kept, all meeting to enjoy the fish,  and do their share towards preserving the fisheries.    Byamee still exists. I have been told by an old native, as will be  shown later, that prayers for the souls of the dead used to be  addressed to Byamee at funerals; certainly not a practice derived from  Protestant missionaries.    Byamee is supposed to listen to the cry of an orphan for rain. Such an  one has but to run out when the clouds are overhead, and, looking at  the sky, call aloud    'Gullee boorboor. Gullee boorboor.'    'Water come down. Water come down.'    Or should it be raining too much, the last possible child of a woman  can stop it by burning Midjeer wood.    Bootha told me after one rain that she had sent one of her tutelary  spirits to tell Boyjerh--Byamee is called by women and children  Boyjerh--that the country wanted rain. In answer he had taken up a  handful of crystal pebbles and thrown them from the sky down into the  water in a stone basin on the top of the sacred mountain; as the  pebbles fell in, the water splashed up into the clouds above, whence it  descended as the desired rain.    It is told to me, that at some initiatory rites the oldest medicine  man, or Wirreenun, present addresses a prayer to Byamee, asking him to  give them long life, as they have kept his law.    The tribesmen do not profess to pray, or to have prayed, to Byamee on  any occasions except at funerals, and at the conclusion of the Boorah.    As for Byamee's relation to ethics, it will be stated in the chapter on  the tribal ceremonies, while the stories as to the rewards and  punishments of the future life will be given in their place. Baiame's  troubles with a kind of disobedient deputy, Darramulun, will also be  narrated: the myth is current, too, among the Wir djuri tribe.    Other particulars about Byamee will occur in the course of later  chapters: here I have tried to give a general summary of the native  beliefs. The reader may interpret them in his own fashion, and may  decide as to whether the beliefs do or do not indicate a kind of  'religion,' whether 'a recognised religion' or not. There is  necessarily, of course, an absence of temples and of priests, and I  have found no trace or vestige of sacrifice. What may be said on the  affirmative side as to the religious aspect of the belief, the reader  can supply from the summary of facts. Other potent beings occur in  native myth, as we shall show, but there appears to exist between them  and mankind no relation of affection, reverence, or duty, as in the  case of Byamee.    Here it seems necessary to advert to a remark of Mr. Howitt's which  appears to be erroneous. He says 'that part of Australia which I have  indicated as the habitat of that belief' (namely, in an All Father),'  is also the area where there has been the advance from group marriage  to individual marriage; from descent in the female line to that in the  male line; where the primitive organisation under the class system has  been more or less replaced by an organisation based on locality; in  fact, where these advances have been made to which I have more than  once drawn attention.'[Howitt, NATIVE TRIBES OF SOUTH-EAST AUSTRALIA,  p. 500.]    Mr. Howitt forgets that he himself attributes the early system of  descent through women, and also the belief in an All Father (Nurelli),  to the Wiimbaio tribe [IBID. p. 489] to the Wotjobaluk tribe,[NATIVE  TRIBES OF SOUTH-EAST AUSTRALIA, pp. 120, 490.] to the Kamilaroi, to the  Ta-Ta-thi,[IBID. p. 494] while female descent and the belief in Baiame  mark the Euahlayi and Wir djuri. [JOURNAL, ANTHROPOLOGICAL INSTITUTE,  XXV., p. 297.]    These tribes cover an enormous area of country, and, though they have  not advanced to male kinship, they all possess the belief in an All  Father. That belief does not appear to be in any way associated with  advance in social organisation, for Messrs. Spencer and Gillen cannot  find a trace of it in more than one of the central and northern tribes,  which have male kinship, and a kind of local self-government. On the  other hand, it does occur among southern tribes, like the Kurnai, which  have advanced almost altogether out of totemism.    In short, we have tribes with female descent, such as the Dieri and  Urabunna, to whom all knowledge of an All Father is denied. We have  many large and important tribes with female descent who certainly  believe in an All Father. We have tribes of the highest social  advancement who are said to show no vestige of the belief, and we have  tribes also socially advanced who hold the belief with great vigour. In  these circumstances, authenticated by Mr. Howitt himself, it is  impossible to accept the theory that belief in an All Father is only  reached in the course of such advance to a higher social organisation  as is made by tribes who reckon descent in the male line.          CHAPTER III    RELATIONSHIPS AND TOTEMS      Some savants question the intellectual ability of the blacks because  they have not elaborate systems of numeration and notation, which in  their life were quite unneeded. Such as were needed were supplied. They  are often incorporate in one word-noun and qualifying numerical  adjective, as for example--    Gundooee      A SOLITARY EMU    Booloowah     TWO EMUS    Oogle oogle   FOUR EMUS    Gayyahnai     FIVE OR SIX EMUS    Gonurrun      FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN EMUS.    I fancy the brains that could have elaborated their marriage rules were  capable of workaday arithmetic if necessary, and few indeed of us know  our family trees as the blacks know theirs.    Even the smallest black child who can talk seems full of knowledge as  to all his relations, animate and inanimate, the marriage taboos, and  the rest of their complicated system.    The first division among this tribe is a blood distinction (I  phratries'):--    Gwaigulleeah  LIGHT BLOODED    Gwaimudthen   DARK BLOODED.    This distinction is not confined to the human beings of the tribe, who  must be of one or the other, but there are the Gwaigulleeah and  Gwaimudthen divisions in all things. The first and chief division in  our tribe, as regards customary marriage law, is the partition of all  tribes-folk into these 'phratries,' or 'exogamous moieties.' While in  most Australian tribes the meanings of the names of phratries are lost,  where the meanings are known they are usually names of animals--Eagle,  Hawk, and Crow, White Cockatoo and Black Cockatoo, and so forth. Among  the great Kamilaroi tribe, akin in speech to the Euahlayi, the names of  phratries, DILBI and KUPATHIN, are of unknown significance. The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/382"],[0,"Edinburgh: Picturesque Notes (#6)"],[1,"thoughts about religion would  condescend to worship God under the same roof!  But there are the chalk  lines.  And which is to pocket pride, and speak the foremost word?          CHAPTER V. GREYFRIARS.      It was Queen Mary who threw open the gardens of the Grey Friars: a new  and semi-rural cemetery in those days, although it has grown an antiquity  in its turn and been superseded by half-a-dozen others.  The Friars must  have had a pleasant time on summer evenings; for their gardens were  situated to a wish, with the tall castle and the tallest of the castle  crags in front.  Even now, it is one of our famous Edinburgh points of  view; and strangers are led thither to see, by yet another instance, how  strangely the city lies upon her hills.  The enclosure is of an irregular  shape; the double church of Old and New Greyfriars stands on the level at  the top; a few thorns are dotted here and there, and the ground falls by  terrace and steep slope towards the north.  The open shows many slabs and  table tombstones; and all round the margin, the place is girt by an array  of aristocratic mausoleums appallingly adorned.    Setting aside the tombs of Roubiliac, which belong to the heroic order of  graveyard art, we Scotch stand, to my fancy, highest among nations in the  matter of grimly illustrating death.  We seem to love for their own sake  the emblems of time and the great change; and even around country  churches you will find a wonderful exhibition of skulls, and crossbones,  and noseless angels, and trumpets pealing for the Judgment Day.  Every  mason was a pedestrian Holbein: he had a deep consciousness of death, and  loved to put its terrors pithily before the churchyard loiterer; he was  brimful of rough hints upon mortality, and any dead farmer was seized  upon to be a text.  The classical examples of this art are in Greyfriars.  In their time, these were doubtless costly monuments, and reckoned of a  very elegant proportion by contemporaries; and now, when the elegance is  not so apparent, the significance remains.  You may perhaps look with a  smile on the profusion of Latin mottoes--some crawling endwise up the  shaft of a pillar, some issuing on a scroll from angels' trumpets--on the  emblematic horrors, the figures rising headless from the grave, and all  the traditional ingenuities in which it pleased our fathers to set forth  their sorrow for the dead and their sense of earthly mutability.  But it  is not a hearty sort of mirth.  Each ornament may have been executed by  the merriest apprentice, whistling as he plied the mallet; but the  original meaning of each, and the combined effect of so many of them in  this quiet enclosure, is serious to the point of melancholy.    Round a great part of the circuit, houses of a low class present their  backs to the churchyard.  Only a few inches separate the living from the  dead.  Here, a window is partly blocked up by the pediment of a tomb;  there, where the street falls far below the level of the graves, a  chimney has been trained up the back of a monument, and a red pot looks  vulgarly over from behind.  A damp smell of the graveyard finds its way  into houses where workmen sit at meat.  Domestic life on a small scale  goes forward visibly at the windows.  The very solitude and stillness of  the enclosure, which lies apart from the town's traffic, serves to  accentuate the contrast.  As you walk upon the graves, you see children  scattering crumbs to feed the sparrows; you hear people singing or  washing dishes, or the sound of tears and castigation; the linen on a  clothes-pole flaps against funereal sculpture; or perhaps the cat slips  over the lintel and descends on a memorial urn.  And as there is nothing  else astir, these incongruous sights and noises take hold on the  attention and exaggerate the sadness of the place.                              [Picture: Greyfriars]    Greyfriars is continually overrun by cats.  I have seen one afternoon, as  many as thirteen of them seated on the grass beside old Milne, the Master  Builder, all sleek and fat, and complacently blinking, as if they had fed  upon strange meats.  Old Milne was chaunting with the saints, as we may  hope, and cared little for the company about his grave; but I confess the  spectacle had an ugly side for me; and I was glad to step forward and  raise my eyes to where the Castle and the roofs of the Old Town, and the  spire of the Assembly Hall, stood deployed against the sky with the  colourless precision of engraving.  An open outlook is to be desired from  a churchyard, and a sight of the sky and some of the world's beauty  relieves a mind from morbid thoughts.    I shall never forget one visit.  It was a grey, dropping day; the grass  was strung with rain-drops; and the people in the houses kept hanging out  their shirts and petticoats and angrily taking them in again, as the  weather turned from wet to fair and back again.  A grave-digger, and a  friend of his, a gardener from the country, accompanied me into one after  another of the cells and little courtyards in which it gratified the  wealthy of old days to enclose their old bones from neighbourhood.  In  one, under a sort of shrine, we found a forlorn human effigy, very  realistically executed down to the detail of his ribbed stockings, and  holding in his hand a ticket with the date of his demise.  He looked most  pitiful and ridiculous, shut up by himself in his aristocratic precinct,  like a bad old boy or an inferior forgotten deity under a new  dispensation; the burdocks grew familiarly about his feet, the rain  dripped all round him; and the world maintained the most entire  indifference as to who he was or whither he had gone.  In another, a  vaulted tomb, handsome externally but horrible inside with damp and  cobwebs, there were three mounds of black earth and an uncovered thigh  bone.  This was the place of interment, it appeared, of a family with  whom the gardener had been long in service.  He was among old  acquaintances.  'This'll be Miss Marg'et's,' said he, giving the bone a  friendly kick.  'The auld ---!'  I have always an uncomfortable feeling  in a graveyard, at sight of so many tombs to perpetuate memories best  forgotten; but I never had the impression so strongly as that day.  People had been at some expense in both these cases: to provoke a  melancholy feeling of derision in the one, and an insulting epithet in  the other.  The proper inscription for the most part of mankind, I began  to think, is the cynical jeer, _cras tibi_.  That, if anything, will stop  the mouth of a carper; since it both admits the worst and carries the war  triumphantly into the enemy's camp.    Greyfriars is a place of many associations.  There was one window in a  house at the lower end, now demolished, which was pointed out to me by  the gravedigger as a spot of legendary interest.  Burke, the resurrection  man, infamous for so many murders at five shillings a-head, used to sit  thereat, with pipe and nightcap, to watch burials going forward on the  green.  In a tomb higher up, which must then have been but newly  finished, John Knox, according to the same informant, had taken refuge in  a turmoil of the Reformation.  Behind the church is the haunted mausoleum  of Sir George Mackenzie: Bloody Mackenzie, Lord Advocate in the  Covenanting troubles and author of some pleasing sentiments on  toleration.  Here, in the last century, an old Heriot's Hospital boy once  harboured from the pursuit of the police.  The Hospital is next door to  Greyfriars--a courtly building among lawns, where, on Founder's Day, you  may see a multitude of children playing Kiss-in-the-Ring and Round the  Mulberry-bush.  Thus, when the fugitive had managed to conceal himself in  the tomb, his old schoolmates had a hundred opportunities to bring him  food; and there he lay in safety till a ship was found to smuggle him  abroad.  But his must have been indeed a heart of brass, to lie all day  and night alone with the dead persecutor; and other lads were far from  emulating him in courage.  When a man's soul is certainly in hell, his  body will scarce lie quiet in a tomb however costly; some time or other  the door must open, and the reprobate come forth in the abhorred garments  of the grave.  It was thought a high piece of prowess to knock at the  Lord Advocate's mausoleum and challenge him to appear.  'Bluidy  Mackingie, come oot if ye dar'!' sang the fool-hardy urchins.  But Sir  George had other affairs on hand; and the author of an essay on  toleration continues to sleep peacefully among the many whom he so  intolerantly helped to slay.    [Picture: The Grassmarket] For this _infelix campus_, as it is dubbed in  one of its own inscriptions--an inscription over which Dr. Johnson passed  a critical eye--is in many ways sacred to the memory of the men whom  Mackenzie persecuted.  It was here, on the flat tombstones, that the  Covenant was signed by an enthusiastic people.  In the long arm of the  church-yard that extends to Lauriston, the prisoners from Bothwell  Bridge--fed on bread and water and guarded, life for life, by vigilant  marksmen--lay five months looking for the scaffold or the plantations.  And while the good work was going forward in the Grassmarket, idlers in  Greyfriars might have heard the throb of the military drums that drowned  the voices of the martyrs.  Nor is this all: for down in the corner  farthest from Sir George, there stands a monument dedicated, in uncouth  Covenanting verse, to all who lost their lives in that contention.  There  is no moorsman shot in a snow shower beside Irongray or Co'monell; there  is not one of the two hundred who were drowned off the Orkneys; nor so  much as a poor, over-driven, Covenanting slave in the American  plantations; but can lay claim to a share in that memorial, and, if such  things interest just men among the shades, can boast he has a monument on  earth as well as Julius Caesar"]]]
