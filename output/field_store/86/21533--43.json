(#6)"],[1,"case of helium is one of particular interest; this element was recognized  by a very bright yellow line in the solar prominences before it was known  to exist on the Earth; indeed, it received the name _helium_ because it  then seemed to be a purely solar constituent. Now it is seen as a strong  absorption line in the spectrum of many stars; but for some reason it is  not in general seen as an absorption line over the Sun's disc, and if our  Sun were removed to such distance so as to appear to us only as a star, we  should have no evidence that it contained any helium at all. So far, then,  as the evidence of the spectroscope goes, the elements present in the  Earth are present throughout the whole extent of the universe within our  view: the same elements and with the same qualities. For the lines of the  spectrum of an element are the revelation of its innermost molecular  structure, so that we can confidently affirm that hydrogen and oxygen on  Sirius, Arcturus, or the Sun, are essentially the same elements as  hydrogen and oxygen on the Earth. On a planet attached to any of these  stars, the two gases would combine together to form water under just the  same conditions as they do here on the Earth; and at suitable  temperatures that water would be a neutral liquid, capable of dissolving  just the same chemical substances that it does here. It would freeze as it  does here; it would evaporate as it does here; it would be water as  completely in all its qualities and conditions as earthly water is. And  what applies to one element or compound applies to all. Throughout the  whole extent of space, the same building materials have been employed, and  throughout they retain the same qualities.    Hydrogen is seen in the spectra of nearly all stars, and also in those of  nebulae. The elemental lines of oxygen are not indeed seen in stellar  spectra, but that the element is present is shown by the flutings of  titanium oxide which distinguish stars like Antares. Nitrogen and carbon  again are not recognized by their elemental lines, but the lines of  cyanogen are seen in the spectra of comets and of sunspots, and  hydrocarbon flutings in the spectra of comets and red stars; while in a  few of the hottest stars even sulphur has recently been identified.[10]  All the five organo-genetic elements are therefore abundantly diffused  through space; the materials for protoplasm, \"the albuminous substance  with water,\" are at hand everywhere. This being so, it is reasonable to  infer that if organic life exists elsewhere than on this Earth, its  essential feature, there as here, is the metabolism of nitrogenous carbon  compounds in association with protoplasm.    But it is objected that \"we are not yet able to identify all the lines in  solar or stellar spectra; may not some of these lines be due to elements  of which we know nothing here, and may not such new elements form complex  and unstable compounds with each other, or with some of those familiar to  us, that would take the place of the five organo-generators, and so give  rise to a physical basis of life, different from that we know on this  Earth?\"    But the development of Mendeleeff's Periodic Law has shown that the  elements are not to be regarded as disconnected entities. The Law as given  in Mendeleeff's own words, runs: \"The properties of the elements as well  as the forms and properties of their compounds are in periodic dependence  on, or (expressing ourselves algebraically) form a periodic function of  the atomic weights of the elements.\" In other words, they form a series,  not only as it regards their atomic weights, but also as it regards their  own properties and the forms and properties of their compounds. We are no  longer at liberty, as we might have been many years ago, to call into  fancied existence new elements having no relation in their properties and  compounds to those with which we are acquainted. New elements, no doubt,  will be discovered in the future, as in the past; and indeed we may be  able to discover them and learn their atomic weights and properties  without ever being able to handle them in a terrestrial laboratory.    In a series of remarkable papers communicated to the Royal Astronomical  Society during the past year (1911-1912), Dr. J. W. Nicholson has given  the result of his computation of the positions of the spectral lines of  two elements of simple structure, and has found that the resulting lines  correspond, for one dynamical system, to the chief unidentified lines  observed in the spectra of nebulae, and for the other, to the chief  unidentified lines in the spectrum of the corona. The latter element is  probably associated with the halogens, but of much lower atomic weight  (namely, 1.3), than fluorine; he therefore gives it the name of  _Protofluorine_. The other element, to which he gives the name _Nebulium_,  will have an atomic weight of 2.1. Prof. Max Wolf, of Heidelberg, has  recently pointed out[11] the evidence of the presence of two other unknown  gases in the Ring nebula in Lyra, and there is no reason to suppose that  the process of discovery has come to an end. But we cannot imagine that we  shall discover any new elements that are more abundant and more  universally diffused than the five which give us protoplasm--\"the physical  basis of life.\" To take an analogy from the solar system: many hundreds of  planetoids have now been discovered between the orbits of Mars and  Jupiter, and probably many hundreds more remain to be discovered; but of  one thing we are certain, that none of the planetoids yet to be discovered  will be of the same rank as either of those two guardians, Mars and  Jupiter, who revolve on the confines of the planetoidal zone. Indeed,  Ceres, the planetoid first discovered, has a greater mass than the  aggregate of all discovered since, and probably of all that exist in the  zone.    Water is essential for life here, but the quality in water which restricts  the range of terrestrial life is that it freezes at 0 deg. Centigrade, and  boils at 100 deg. Centigrade; it is only in the liquid state during the  intermediate range of 100 degrees. In order to extend the range for living  organisms, we should have, therefore, to discover a new vehicle, that,  possessing all the other qualities of water, is not restricted to the  liquid state within the same limits. But we are at once met with the  difficulty that the first essential for the vehicle is that it should be  abundant, and there are no other elements more abundant than hydrogen and  oxygen. This new vehicle must, like water, be both neutral and stable, or  it would itself interfere with the highly unstable compounds that are a  necessity for metabolism. And, if we could find this new vehicle, liquid  at temperatures outside the 0 deg. to 100 deg. Centigrade, have we any reason to  suppose that protoplasm itself would be able to endure these outlying  temperatures? Looking through the range of substances available, we can  only say that none other presents itself as approaching water in  suitability for its essential office. If we, ourselves, were able to  create a vehicle, could we imagine one more perfectly suited?          CHAPTER V    THE MOON      The Sun and Moon offer to our sight almost exactly the same apparent  diameters; to the eye, they look the same size. But as we know the Sun to  be 400 times as distant as the Moon, it is necessarily 400 times as large;  its surface must exceed that of the Moon by the square of 400, or 160,000;  its volume by the cube of 400, or 64,000,000. As the Sun is of low mean  density, its mass does not exceed that of the Moon in quite the same high  ratio; but it is equal in mass to      27,000,000 moons.    Compared with the Sun, the Moon is therefore an insignificant little  ball--a mere particle; but as a world for habitation it possesses some  advantages over the Sun. The first glance at it in a telescope is  sufficient to assure the observer that he is looking at a solid,  substantial globe. It is not only substantial, it is rugged; its surface  is broken up into mountains, hills, valleys, and plains; the mountains  stand out in sensible relief; it looks like a ball of solid silver boldly  embossed and chased.    So far all is to the good for the purpose of habitation. Wherever men  are, they must have a solid platform on which to stand; they must have a  stable terrene whereon their food may grow, and this the Moon could  supply. \"The Earth's gloom of iron substance\" is necessary for man here,  and the Moon appears to offer a like stability.    Another favourable condition is that we know that the Moon receives from  the Sun a sufficient supply of light and heat. Each square yard of its  surface receives, on the average, the same amount of light and heat that  would fall upon a square yard on the Earth that was presented towards the  Sun at the same inclination; and we know from our own experience that this  is sufficient for the maintenance of life.    And the Moon is near enough for us to subject her to a searching scrutiny.  Every part of the hemisphere turned toward us has been repeatedly  examined, measured, and photographed; to that extent our knowledge of its  topography is more complete than of the world on which we live. There are  no unexplored regions on our side of the Moon. The great photographs taken  in recent years at the observatories of Paris and of the University of  Chicago have shown thousands of \"crater-pits,\" not more than a mile  across; and narrow lines on the Moon's surface have been detected with a  breadth less than one-tenth of this. An elevation on the Moon, if it rose  up abruptly from an open plain, would make its presence apparent by the  shadow which it would cast soon after sunrise or near sunset; in this way  an isolated building, if it were as large as the great pyramid of Ghizeh,  would also show itself, and all our great towns and cities would"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35993"],[0,"The History of Don Quixote de la Mancha (#6)"],[1,"ng, than if I had been born to  nothing else. My life is fast drawing to a close; and from the state  of my pulse, I think I can scarcely outlive Sunday next at the utmost;  so that I hardly think I shall profit by the acquaintance so  fortunately made. But adieu, my merry friends all; for I am going to  die; and I hope to see you again ere long in the next world as happy  as hearts can desire.' With that, we found ourselves at the bridge of  Toledo, by which we entered the city; and the student took leave of  us, having to go round by the bridge of Segovia.\"    This is all that we know of the last sickness of Cervantes: it was  dropsy, and this dropsy, according to his own prediction to the  student, increased so rapidly, that a few days after, on the 18th of  April, 1616, he was considered to be past recovery, and it was thought  advisable for him to receive the last sacrament of extreme unction,  which he accordingly did with all the devotion of a pious Catholic.    He died on the 23d day of April, 1616, in the sixty-ninth year of his  age; and was buried in the habit of the Franciscans, whose order he  had entered some time previous to his decease. It is a coincidence  worth remembering, that _Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra_ terminated his  mortal course in Spain on the very same day that _William Shakspere_  died in England.      As regards style of composition, Cervantes is without a rival in the  Spanish language. For the purity of his writing, he is even to this  day acknowledged, not only to be first, but to have no one who can  come near enough to be called second to him. But this is not his  greatest praise. He must ever be remembered as the originator of a  kind of writing, which the greatest of men since his time have thought  it an honour, of whatever country they may have been, to imitate. All  modern romance-writers, and novel-writers (and what a mighty host are  they!) must be content to be accounted the followers of Miguel de  Cervantes.    With regard to _Don Quixote_, it need hardly be said that its object is  satire upon the books of knight-errantry, which were so much used in the  time of Cervantes, and especially by the Spanish. He conceived that these  books were likely to give his countrymen false ideas of the world; to  fill them all, but especially the young, with fanciful notions of life,  and so make them unfit to meet its real difficulties and hardships. In  order to exhibit the absurdity of such works (it must be remembered too,  that the more famous books of knighthood had given rise to a host of  spurious imitations, with all their faults and none of their beauties),  the author of Don Quixote represents a worthy gentleman with his head  turned by such reading, and then sallying forth and endeavouring to act  in this plain matter-of-fact world (where there are windmills, and not  giants--inns, and not castles--good honest hosts and hostesses, and not  lords and ladies--chambermaids, and not peerless beauties--estates to be  got by hard labour, and not islands to be given away to one's dependants  as if by enchantment), endeavouring to act, we say, as if all that was  said in _Amadis de Gaul_, and _Palmerin of England_, and _Olivante de  Laura_, were really true. The absurdities into which the poor gentleman's  madness constantly hurries him, the stern and bitter satire which is  conveyed in these against the books which caused them all, did more  towards putting down the extravagances of knight-errantry than many  volumes of the bitterest invective. We of this present day cannot be  really alive to all the great genius displayed in Don Quixote. The books  which it satirises are now almost unknown; many who have heard of Amadis  de Gaul have never read it, and still less have they read all the lineage  of the Amadis. Besides, in some of the first of the chivalrous romances,  such as Palmerin of England, the _Morte d'Arthur_, and others, there was  undoubtedly very much talent and beauty of sentiment: and it was as such  that Southey thought it right to translate them and present them to the  English public some years ago; and deeply indebted are we all to him for  his labours, which revived among us somewhat of the taste for the old and  stately prose of the ancient romances--a taste which in our day has given  rise to those beautiful editions in English of the tales of De la Motte  Fouque. But we must ever remember that it was not for the purpose of  ridiculing those and similar books that Cervantes wrote his  \"history\"--one so keenly alive to the beauty of the poetry of the  mediaeval writing as he was, never could have intended such a thing: it  was to exterminate the race of miserable imitators, who, at his time,  deluged Europe with sickening caricatures of the old romance. It has even  been thought that he had intended another course in order to cure the  disease, namely, that of himself composing a model romance in the style  of Amadis, which, from its excellence, would make manifest the follies of  men who had endeavoured to imitate that almost inimitable work. But the  disease was past cure; the limb was obliged to be amputated; books of  knight-errantry could not be reformed, he thought; and so rather than let  them continue their mischief in their present shape, they must be quite  destroyed; and this the satire of Don Quixote was by its author  considered the most proper means of effecting.    This was indeed a daring remedy; and, as may be supposed, by some it  has been thought that Cervantes, in lopping off an excrescence, did  also destroy a healthy limb,--that, in destroying knight-errantry, he  destroyed also the holy spirit of self-devotion and heroism. The Count  Segur, we are told by an ingenious writer of the present time,[2] who  joins the Count in his opinion, laments that the fine spirit of  chivalry should have lost its empire, and that the romance of Don  Quixote, by its success and its philosophy, concealed under an  attractive fiction, should have completed the ruin by fixing ridicule  even upon its memory--a sentence indeed full of error; for real  philosophy needs not to be concealed to be attractive. And Sir William  Temple quotes the saying of a worthy Spaniard, who told him \"that the  History of Don Quixote had ruined the Spanish monarchy; for since that  time men had grown ashamed of honour and love, and only thought of  pursuing their fortune and satisfying their lust.\"    [2] Kenelm Digby, Esq., in his beautiful book entitled _Godefridus_,  one of the volumes of the _Broad Stone of Honour_.    But surely such censure is misdirected--surely the downfall of Spain  may be traced to other causes. It is not the spirit of heroism, or of  Christian self-devotion, which Cervantes would put down. His manly  writing can never be accused of that: misfortune had taught him too  well in his own earlier days how to appreciate such a virtue. In  nothing is his consummate skill perceived more than in the way in  which he prevents us from confounding the follies of the  knights-errant, and of the debased books of romance, with the generous  heart and actions of the true Christian gentleman. In spite of all his  hallucination, who can help respecting Don Quixote himself? We laugh,  indeed, at the ludicrous situations into which his madness is for ever  getting him; but we must reverence the good Christian cavalier who,  amidst all, never thinks less of any thing than of himself and of his  own interest. What is his character? It is that of one possessing  virtue, imagination, genius, kind feeling,--all that can distinguish  an elevated soul, and an affectionate heart. He is brave, faithful,  loyal, always keeping his word; he contends only for virtue and glory.  Does he wish for kingdoms? it is only that he may give them to his  good squire Sancho Panza. He is a constant lover, a humane warrior, an  affectionate master, an accomplished gentleman. It is not, then, by  describing such a man that Cervantes desired to ridicule real heroism;  surely not: he would only shew that, even with all these good  qualities, if they were misdirected or spoiled by vain imaginations,  the most noble could only become ridiculous. He would teach us, that  this is a world of _action_, and not of _fancy_; that it will not do  for us to go out of ourselves and out of the world, and lead an ideal  life: our duties are around us and within us; and we need not leave  our own homes in order to seek adventures wherein those duties may be  acceptably performed. He perceived that by knight-errantry and  romances some of the holiest aspirations of the human heart were,  according to the adage, which affirms that \"there is but one step from  the sublime to the ridiculous,\" by over-description and fulsome  language, in danger of being exposed to ridicule, and so of being  crushed; and he resolved, by excess of satire, to put a stop at once  to such a danger,--to crush those books which were daily destroying  that which he held most dear--the true spirit of chivalry, the true  devotion of the Christian gentleman. \"When the light of chivalry was  expiring, Cervantes put his extinguisher upon it, and drove away the  moths that alone still fluttered around it. He loved chivalry too well  to be patient when he saw it parodied and burlesqued; and he perceived  that the best way of preserving it from shame was, to throw over it  the sanctity of death.\"[3]    [3] Vide _Guesses at Truth_.

With what degree of judgment the  \"cumbrous matter\" has been removed, must be left to the public to  determine.
