From  England he went to Spain, where he modelled a statue of the Virgin for a  great nobleman. Not receiving the pay he expected, he broke his work to  pieces; for which act of sacrilege the Inquisition sent him to prison,  where he starved himself to death in 1522. Such at least is the legend  of his end.    Note 2. The cartoons to which Cellini here alludes were made by Michel  Angelo and Lionardo for the decoration of the Sala del Gran Consiglio in  the Palazzo Vecchio at Florence. Only the shadows of them remain to this  day; a part of Michel Angelos, engraved by Schiavonetti, and a  transcript by Rubens from Lionardos, called the Battle of the Standard.    Note 3. The Sistine Chapel in the Vatican.    XIII    NOW let us return to Piero Torrigiani, who, with my drawing in his hand,  spoke as follows: This Buonarroti and I used, when we were boys, to go  into the Church of the Carmine, to learn drawing from the chapel of  Masaccio. [1] It was Buonarrotis habit to banter all who were drawing  there; and one day, among others, when he was annoying me, I got more  angry than usual, and clenching my fist, gave him such a blow on the  nose, that I felt bone and cartilage go down like biscuit beneath my  knuckles; and this mark of mine he will carry with him to the grave.  [2] These words begat in me such hatred of the man, since I was always  gazing at the masterpieces of the divine Michel Agnolo, that although I  felt a wish to go with him to England, I now could never bear the sight  of him.    All the while I was at Florence, I studied the noble manner of Michel  Agnolo, and from this I have never deviated. About that time I  contracted a close and familiar friendship with an amiable lad of my own  age, who was also in the goldsmiths trade. He was called Francesco, son  of Filippo, and grandson of Fra Lippo Lippi, that most excellent  painter. [3] Through intercourse together, such love grew up between us  that, day or night, we never stayed apart. The house where he lived was  still full of the fine studies which his father had made, bound up in  several books of drawings by his hand, and taken from the best  antiquities of Rome. The sight of these things filled me with passionate  enthusiasm; and for two years or thereabouts we lived in intimacy. At  that time I fashioned a silver bas-relief of the size of a little  childs hand. It was intended for the clasp to a mans belt; for they  were then worn as large as that. I carved on it a knot of leaves in the  antique style, with figures of children and other masks of great beauty.  This piece I made in the workshop of one Francesco Salimbene; and on its  being exhibited to the trade, the goldsmiths praised me as the best  young craftsman of their art.    There was one Giovan Battista, surnamed Il Tasso, a wood-carver,  precisely of my own age, who one day said to me that if I was willing to  go to Rome, he should be glad to join me. [4] Now we had this  conversation together immediately after dinner; and I being angry with  my father for the same old reason of the music, said to Tasso: You are  a fellow of words, not deeds. He answered: I too have come to anger  with my mother; and if I had cash enough to take me to Rome, I would not  turn back to lock the door of that wretched little workshop I call  mine. To these words I replied that if that was all that kept him in  Florence I had money enough in my pockets to bring us both to Rome.  Talking thus and walking onwards, we found ourselves at the gate San  Piero Gattolini without noticing that we had got there; whereupon I  said: Friend Tasso, this is Gods doing that we have reached this gate  without either you or me noticing that we were there; and now that I am  here, it seems to me that I have finished half the journey. And so,  being of one accord, we pursued our way together, saying, Oh, what will  our old folks say this evening? We then made an agreement not to think  more about them till we reached Rome. So we tied our aprons behind our  backs, and trudged almost in silence to Siena. When we arrived at Siena,  Tasso said (for he had hurt his feet) that he would not go farther, and  asked me to lend him money to get back. I made answer: I should not  have enough left to go forward; you ought indeed to have thought of this  on leaving Florence; and if it is because of your feet that you shirk  the journey, we will find a return horse for Rome, which will deprive  you of the excuse. Accordingly I hired a horse; and seeing that he did  not answer, I took my way toward the gate of Rome. When he knew that I  was firmly resolved to go, muttering between his teeth, and limping as  well as he could, he came on behind me very slowly and at a great  distance. On reaching the gate, I felt pity for my comrade, and waited  for him, and took him on the crupper, saying: What would our friends  speak of us to-morrow, if, having left for Rome, we had not pluck to get  beyond Siena? Then the good Tasso said I spoke the truth; and as he was  a pleasant fellow, he began to laugh and sing; and in this way, always  singing and laughing, we travelled the whole way to Rome. I had just  nineteen years then, and so had the century.    When we reached Rome, I put myself under a master who was known as Il  Firenzuola. His name was Giovanni, and he came from Firenzuola in  Lombardy, a most able craftsman in large vases and big plate of that  kind. I showed him part of the model for the clasp which I had made in  Florence at Salimbenes. It pleased him exceedingly; and turning to one  of his journeymen, a Florentine called Giannotto Giannotti, who had been  several years with him, he spoke as follows: This fellow is one of the  Florentines who know something, and you are one of those who know  nothing. Then I recognised the man, and turned to speak with him; for  before he went to Rome, we often went to draw together, and had been  very intimate comrades. He was so put out by the words his master flung  at him, that he said he did not recognise me or know who I was;  whereupon I got angry, and cried out: O Giannotto, you who were once my  friend-for have we not been together in such and such places, and drawn,  and ate, and drunk, and slept in company at your house in the country? I  dont want you to bear witness on my behalf to this worthy man, your  master, because I hope my hands are such that without aid from you they  will declare what sort of a fellow I am.    Note 1. The Chapel of the Carmine, painted in fresco by Masaccio and  some other artist, possibly Filippino Lippi, is still the most important  monument of Florentine art surviving from the period preceding Raphael.    Note 2. The profile portraits of Michel Angelo Buonarroti confirm this  story. They show the bridge of his nose bent in an angle, as though it  had been broken.    Note 3. Fra Filippo Lippi was a Carmelite monk, whose frescoes at Prato  and Spoleta and oil-paintings in Florence and elsewhere are among the  most genial works of the pre-Raphaelite Renaissance. Vasari narrates his  love-adventures with Lucrezia Buti, and Robert Browning has drawn a  clever portrait of him in his Men and Women. His son, Filippo or  Filippino, was also an able painter, some of whose best work survives in  the Strozzi Chapel of S. Maria Novella at Florence, and in the Church of  S. Maria Sopra Minerva at Rome.    Note 4. Tasso was an able artist, mentioned both by Vasari and Pietro  Aretino. He stood high in the favour of Duke Cosimo de Medici, who took  his opinion on the work of other craftsmen.    XIV    WHEN I had thus spoken, Firenzuola, who was a man of hot spirit and  brave, turned to Giannotto, and said to him: You vile rascal, arent  you ashamed to treat a man who has been so intimate a comrade with you  in this way? And with the same movement of quick feeling, he faced  round and said to me: Welcome to my workshop; and do as you have  promised; let your hands declare what man you are.    He gave me a very fine piece of silver plate to work on for a cardinal.  It was a little oblong box, copied from the porphyry sarcophagus before  the door of the Rotonda. Beside what I copied, I enriched it with so  many elegant masks of my invention, that my master went about showing it  through the art, and boasting that so good a piece of work had been  turned out from his shop. [1] It was about half a cubit in size, and was  so constructed as to serve for a salt-cellar at table. This was the  first earning that I touched at Rome, and part of it I sent to assist my  good father; the rest I kept for my own use, living upon it while I went  about studying the antiquities of Rome, until my money failed, and I had  to return to the shop for work. Battista del Tasso, my comrade, did not  stay long in Rome, but went back to Florence.    After undertaking some new commissions, I took it into my head, as soon  as I had finished them, to change my master; I had indeed been worried  into doing so by a certain Milanese, called Pagolo Arsago. [2] My first  master, Firenzuola, had a great quarrel about this with Arsago, and  abused him in my presence; whereupon I took up speech in defence of my  new master. I said that I was born free, and free I meant to live, and  that there was no reason to complain of him, far less of me, since some  few crowns of wages were still due to me; also that I chose to go, like  a free journeyman, where it pleased me, knowing I did wrong to no man.  My new master then put in with his excuses, saying that he had not asked  me to come, and that I should gratify him by returning with Firenzuola.  To this I replied that I was not aware of wronging the latter in any  way, and as I had completed his commissions, I chose to be my own master  and not the man of others, and that he who wanted me must beg me of  myself. Firenzuola"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4035"],[0,"Greek Studies: a Series of Essays (#6)"],[1," To illustrate this, think what the effect would be, if you could  associate, by some trick of memory, a certain group of natural  objects, in all their varied perspective, their changes of colour and  tone in varying light and shade, with the being and image of an  actual person.  You travelled through a country of clear rivers and  wide meadows, or of high windy places, or of lowly grass and willows,  or of the Lady of the Lake; and all the complex impressions of these  objects wound themselves, as a second animated body, new and more  subtle, around the person of some one left there, so that they no  longer come to recollection apart from each other.  Now try to  conceive the image of an actual person, in whom, somehow, all those  impressions of the vine and its fruit, as the highest type of the  life of the green sap, had become incorporate;--all the scents and  colours of its flower and fruit, and [38] something of its curling  foliage; the chances of its growth; the enthusiasm, the easy flow of  more choice expression, as its juices mount within one; for the image  is eloquent, too, in word, gesture, and glancing of the eyes, which  seem to be informed by some soul of the vine within it: as Wordsworth  says,    Beauty born of murmuring sound  Shall pass into her face--    so conceive an image into which the beauty, \"born\" of the vine, has  passed; and you have the idea of Dionysus, as he appears, entirely  fashioned at last by central Greek poetry and art, and is consecrated  in the Oinophoria and the Anthestêria,+ the great festivals of the  Winepress and the Flowers.    The word wine, and with it the germ of the myth of Dionysus, is older  than the separation of the Indo-Germanic race.  Yet, with the people  of Athens, Dionysus counted as the youngest of the gods; he was also  the son of a mortal, dead in childbirth, and seems always to have  exercised the charm of the latest born, in a sort of allowable  fondness.  Through the fine-spun speculations of modern ethnologists  and grammarians, noting the changes in the letters of his name, and  catching at the slightest historical records of his worship, we may  trace his coming from Phrygia, the birthplace of the more mystical  elements of [39] Greek religion, over the mountains of Thrace.  On  the heights of Pangaeus he leaves an oracle, with a perpetually  burning fire, famous down to the time of Augustus, who reverently  visited it.  Southwards still, over the hills of Parnassus, which  remained for the inspired women of Boeotia the centre of his  presence, he comes to Thebes, and the family of Cadmus.  From Boeotia  he passes to Attica; to the villages first; at last to Athens; at an  assignable date, under Peisistratus; out of the country, into the  town.    To this stage of his town-life, that Dionysus of \"enthusiasm\" already  belonged; it was to the Athenians of the town, to urbane young men,  sitting together at the banquet, that those expressions of a sudden  eloquence came, of the loosened utterance and finer speech, its  colour and imagery.  Dionysus, then, has entered Athens, to become  urbane like them; to walk along the marble streets in frequent  procession, in the persons of noble youths, like those who at the  Oschophoria bore the branches of the vine from his temple, to the  temple of Athene of the Parasol, or of beautiful slaves; to  contribute through the arts to the adornment of life, yet perhaps  also in part to weaken it, relaxing ancient austerity.  Gradually,  his rough country feasts will be outdone by the feasts of the town;  and as comedy arose out of those, so these will give rise to tragedy.  For his entrance upon this new stage of his career, his coming into  the town, is from the [40] first tinged with melancholy, as if in  entering the town he had put off his country peace.  The other  Olympians are above sorrow.  Dionysus, like a strenuous mortal hero,  like Hercules or Perseus, has his alternations of joy and sorrow, of  struggle and hard-won triumph.  It is out of the sorrows of Dionysus,  then,--of Dionysus in winter--that all Greek tragedy grows; out of  the song of the sorrows of Dionysus, sung at his winter feast by the  chorus of satyrs, singers clad in goat-skins, in memory of his rural  life, one and another of whom, from time to time, steps out of the  company to emphasise and develope this or that circumstance of the  story; and so the song becomes dramatic.  He will soon forget that  early country life, or remember it but as the dreamy background of  his later existence.  He will become, as always in later art and  poetry, of dazzling whiteness; no longer dark with the air and sun,  but like one eskiatrofêkôs+--brought up under the shade of Eastern  porticoes or pavilions, or in the light that has only reached him  softened through the texture of green leaves; honey-pale, like the  delicate people of the city, like the flesh of women, as those old  vase-painters conceive of it, who leave their hands and faces  untouched with the pencil on the white clay.  The ruddy god of the  vineyard, stained with wine-lees, or coarser colour, will hardly  recognise his double, in the white, graceful, mournful figure,  weeping, chastened, lifting up his arms in yearning+ [41] affection  towards his late-found mother, as we see him on a famous Etruscan  mirror.  Only, in thinking of this early tragedy, of these town-  feasts, and of the entrance of Dionysus into Athens, you must  suppose, not the later Athens which is oftenest in our thoughts, the  Athens of Pericles and Pheidias; but that little earlier Athens of  Peisistratus, which the Persians destroyed, which some of us perhaps  would rather have seen, in its early simplicity, than the greater  one; when the old image of the god, carved probably out of the stock  of an enormous vine, had just come from the village of Eleutherae to  his first temple in the Lenaeum--the quarter of the winepresses, near  the Limnae--the marshy place, which in Athens represents the cave of  Nysa; its little buildings on the hill-top, still with steep rocky  ways, crowding round the ancient temple of Erechtheus and the grave  of Cecrops, with the old miraculous olive-tree still growing there,  and the old snake of Athene Polias still alive somewhere in the  temple court.    The artists of the Italian Renaissance have treated Dionysus many  times, and with great effect, but always in his joy, as an embodiment  of that glory of nature to which the Renaissance was a return.  But  in an early engraving of Mocetto there is for once a Dionysus treated  differently.  The cold light of the background displays a barren  hill, the bridge and towers of [42] an Italian town, and quiet water.  In the foreground, at the root of a vine, Dionysus is sitting, in a  posture of statuesque weariness; the leaves of the vine are grandly  drawn, and wreathing heavily round the head of the god, suggest the  notion of his incorporation into it.  The right hand, holding a great  vessel languidly and indifferently, lets the stream of wine flow  along the earth; while the left supports the forehead, shadowing  heavily a face, comely, but full of an expression of painful  brooding.  One knows not how far one may really be from the mind of  the old Italian engraver, in gathering from his design this  impression of a melancholy and sorrowing Dionysus.  But modern  motives are clearer; and in a Bacchus by a young Hebrew painter, in  the exhibition of the Royal Academy of 1868, there was a complete and  very fascinating realisation of such a motive; the god of the  bitterness of wine, \"of things too sweet\"; the sea-water of the  Lesbian grape become somewhat brackish in the cup.  Touched by the  sentiment of this subtler, melancholy Dionysus, we may ask whether  anything similar in feeling is to be actually found in the range of  Greek ideas;--had some antitype of this fascinating figure any place  in Greek religion?  Yes; in a certain darker side of the double god  of nature, obscured behind the brighter episodes of Thebes and Naxos,  but never quite forgotten, something corresponding to this deeper,  more refined idea, [43] really existed--the conception of Dionysus  Zagreus; an image, which has left, indeed, but little effect in Greek  art and poetry, which criticism has to put patiently together, out of  late, scattered hints in various writers; but which is yet  discernible, clearly enough to show that it really visited certain  Greek minds here and there; and discernible, not as a late after-  thought, but as a tradition really primitive, and harmonious with the  original motive of the idea of Dionysus.  In its potential, though  unrealised scope, it is perhaps the subtlest dream in Greek religious  poetry, and is, at least, part of the complete physiognomy of  Dionysus, as it actually reveals itself to the modern student, after  a complete survey.    The whole compass of the idea of Dionysus, a dual god of both summer  and winter, became ultimately, as we saw, almost identical with that  of Demeter.  The Phrygians believed that the god slept in winter and  awoke in summer, and celebrated his waking and sleeping; or that he  was bound and imprisoned in winter, and unbound in spring.  We saw  how, in Elis and at Argos, the women called him out of the sea, with  the singing of hymns, in early spring; and a beautiful ceremony in  the temple at Delphi, which, as we know, he shares with Apollo,  described by Plutarch, represents his mystical resurrection.  Yearly,  about the time of the shortest day, just as the light begins to  increase, [44] and while hope is still tremulously strung, the  priestesses of Dionysus were wont to assemble with many lights at his  shrine, and there, with songs and dances, awoke the new-born child  after his wintry sleep, waving in a sacred cradle, like the great  basket used for winnowing corn, a symbolical image, or perhaps a real  infant.  He is twofold then--a Döppelganger; like"]]]
