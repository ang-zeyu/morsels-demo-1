We think of matter as having existed long before there  were any minds, and it is hard to think of it as a mere product of  mental activity. But whether true or false, idealism is not to be  dismissed as obviously absurd.    We have seen that, even if physical objects do have an independent  existence, they must differ very widely from sense-data, and can only  have a _correspondence_ with sense-data, in the same sort of way in  which a catalogue has a correspondence with the things catalogued. Hence  common sense leaves us completely in the dark as to the true intrinsic  nature of physical objects, and if there were good reason to regard them  as mental, we could not legitimately reject this opinion merely because  it strikes us as strange. The truth about physical objects _must_ be  strange. It may be unattainable, but if any philosopher believes that  he has attained it, the fact that what he offers as the truth is strange  ought not to be made a ground of objection to his opinion.    The grounds on which idealism is advocated are generally grounds derived  from the theory of knowledge, that is to say, from a discussion of the  conditions which things must satisfy in order that we may be able to  know them. The first serious attempt to establish idealism on such  grounds was that of Bishop Berkeley. He proved first, by arguments which  were largely valid, that our sense-data cannot be supposed to have an  existence independent of us, but must be, in part at least, 'in' the  mind, in the sense that their existence would not continue if there were  no seeing or hearing or touching or smelling or tasting. So far, his  contention was almost certainly valid, even if some of his arguments  were not so. But he went on to argue that sense-data were the only  things of whose existence our perceptions could assure us; and that  to be known is to be 'in' a mind, and therefore to be mental. Hence he  concluded that nothing can ever be known except what is in some mind,  and that whatever is known without being in my mind must be in some  other mind.    In order to understand his argument, it is necessary to understand his  use of the word 'idea'. He gives the name 'idea' to anything which  is _immediately_ known, as, for example, sense-data are known. Thus a  particular colour which we see is an idea; so is a voice which we hear,  and so on. But the term is not wholly confined to sense-data. There will  also be things remembered or imagined, for with such things also we have  immediate acquaintance at the moment of remembering or imagining. All  such immediate data he calls 'ideas'.    He then proceeds to consider common objects, such as a tree, for  instance. He shows that all we know immediately when we 'perceive' the  tree consists of ideas in his sense of the word, and he argues that  there is not the slightest ground for supposing that there is anything  real about the tree except what is perceived. Its being, he says,  consists in being perceived: in the Latin of the schoolmen its '_esse_'  is '_percipi_'. He fully admits that the tree must continue to exist  even when we shut our eyes or when no human being is near it. But this  continued existence, he says, is due to the fact that God continues to  perceive it; the 'real' tree, which corresponds to what we called the  physical object, consists of ideas in the mind of God, ideas more or  less like those we have when we see the tree, but differing in the fact  that they are permanent in God's mind so long as the tree continues  to exist. All our perceptions, according to him, consist in a  partial participation in God's perceptions, and it is because of this  participation that different people see more or less the same tree. Thus  apart from minds and their ideas there is nothing in the world, nor is  it possible that anything else should ever be known, since whatever is  known is necessarily an idea.    There are in this argument a good many fallacies which have been  important in the history of philosophy, and which it will be as well to  bring to light. In the first place, there is a confusion engendered by  the use of the word 'idea'. We think of an idea as essentially something  in somebody's mind, and thus when we are told that a tree consists  entirely of ideas, it is natural to suppose that, if so, the tree  must be entirely in minds. But the notion of being 'in' the mind is  ambiguous. We speak of bearing a person in mind, not meaning that the  person is in our minds, but that a thought of him is in our minds. When  a man says that some business he had to arrange went clean out of his  mind, he does not mean to imply that the business itself was ever in his  mind, but only that a thought of the business was formerly in his mind,  but afterwards ceased to be in his mind. And so when Berkeley says that  the tree must be in our minds if we can know it, all that he really has  a right to say is that a thought of the tree must be in our minds. To  argue that the tree itself must be in our minds is like arguing that a  person whom we bear in mind is himself in our minds. This confusion  may seem too gross to have been really committed by any competent  philosopher, but various attendant circumstances rendered it possible.  In order to see how it was possible, we must go more deeply into the  question as to the nature of ideas.    Before taking up the general question of the nature of ideas, we must  disentangle two entirely separate questions which arise concerning  sense-data and physical objects. We saw that, for various reasons of  detail, Berkeley was right in treating the sense-data which constitute  our perception of the tree as more or less subjective, in the sense that  they depend upon us as much as upon the tree, and would not exist if the  tree were not being perceived. But this is an entirely different point  from the one by which Berkeley seeks to prove that whatever can be  immediately known must be in a mind. For this purpose arguments of  detail as to the dependence of sense-data upon us are useless. It is  necessary to prove, generally, that by being known, things are shown to  be mental. This is what Berkeley believes himself to have done. It  is this question, and not our previous question as to the difference  between sense-data and the physical object, that must now concern us.    Taking the word 'idea' in Berkeley's sense, there are two quite distinct  things to be considered whenever an idea is before the mind. There is  on the one hand the thing of which we are aware--say the colour of my  table--and on the other hand the actual awareness itself, the mental act  of apprehending the thing. The mental act is undoubtedly mental, but is  there any reason to suppose that the thing apprehended is in any sense  mental? Our previous arguments concerning the colour did not prove it to  be mental; they only proved that its existence depends upon the relation  of our sense organs to the physical object--in our case, the table. That  is to say, they proved that a certain colour will exist, in a certain  light, if a normal eye is placed at a certain point relatively to  the table. They did not prove that the colour is in the mind of the  percipient.    Berkeley's view, that obviously the colour must be in the mind, seems  to depend for its plausibility upon confusing the thing apprehended  with the act of apprehension. Either of these might be called an 'idea';  probably either would have been called an idea by Berkeley. The act  is undoubtedly in the mind; hence, when we are thinking of the act,  we readily assent to the view that ideas must be in the mind. Then,  forgetting that this was only true when ideas were taken as acts of  apprehension, we transfer the proposition that 'ideas are in the mind'  to ideas in the other sense, i.e. to the things apprehended by our acts  of apprehension. Thus, by an unconscious equivocation, we arrive at the  conclusion that whatever we can apprehend must be in our minds. This  seems to be the true analysis of Berkeley's argument, and the ultimate  fallacy upon which it rests.    This question of the distinction between act and object in our  apprehending of things is vitally important, since our whole power of  acquiring knowledge is bound up with it. The faculty of being acquainted  with things other than itself is the main characteristic of a mind.  Acquaintance with objects essentially consists in a relation between the  mind and something other than the mind; it is this that constitutes the  mind's power of knowing things. If we say that the things known must be  in the mind, we are either unduly limiting the mind's power of knowing,  or we are uttering a mere tautology. We are uttering a mere tautology if  we mean by '_in_ the mind' the same as by '_before_ the mind', i.e. if  we mean merely being apprehended by the mind. But if we mean this, we  shall have to admit that what, _in this sense_, is in the mind,  may nevertheless be not mental. Thus when we realize the nature of  knowledge, Berkeley's argument is seen to be wrong in substance as well  as in form, and his grounds for supposing that 'ideas'--i.e. the objects  apprehended--must be mental, are found to have no validity whatever.  Hence his grounds in favour of idealism may be dismissed. It remains to  see whether there are any other grounds.    It is often said, as though it were a self-evident truism, that we  cannot know that anything exists which we do not know. It is inferred  that whatever can in any way be relevant to our experience must be at  least capable of being known by us; whence it follows that if matter  were essentially something with which we could not become acquainted,  matter would be something which we could not know to exist, and which  could have for us no importance whatever.

She must have gone away in the clothes she wore when  she came to us.  In white, policeman.  A woman in white.\"    \"I haven't seen her, sir.\"    \"If you or any of your men meet with the woman, stop her, and send her  in careful keeping to that address.  I'll pay all expenses, and a fair  reward into the bargain.\"    The policeman looked at the card that was handed down to him.    \"Why are we to stop her, sir? What has she done?\"    \"Done! She has escaped from my Asylum.  Don't forget; a woman in white.  Drive on.\"        V    \"She has escaped from my Asylum!\"    I cannot say with truth that the terrible inference which those words  suggested flashed upon me like a new revelation.  Some of the strange  questions put to me by the woman in white, after my ill-considered  promise to leave her free to act as she pleased, had suggested the  conclusion either that she was naturally flighty and unsettled, or that  some recent shock of terror had disturbed the balance of her faculties.  But the idea of absolute insanity which we all associate with the very  name of an Asylum, had, I can honestly declare, never occurred to me,  in connection with her.  I had seen nothing, in her language or her  actions, to justify it at the time; and even with the new light thrown  on her by the words which the stranger had addressed to the policeman,  I could see nothing to justify it now.    What had I done? Assisted the victim of the most horrible of all false  imprisonments to escape; or cast loose on the wide world of London an  unfortunate creature, whose actions it was my duty, and every man's  duty, mercifully to control?  I turned sick at heart when the question  occurred to me, and when I felt self-reproachfully that it was asked  too late.    In the disturbed state of my mind, it was useless to think of going to  bed, when I at last got back to my chambers in Clement's Inn.  Before  many hours elapsed it would be necessary to start on my journey to  Cumberland.  I sat down and tried, first to sketch, then to read--but  the woman in white got between me and my pencil, between me and my  book.  Had the forlorn creature come to any harm? That was my first  thought, though I shrank selfishly from confronting it.  Other thoughts  followed, on which it was less harrowing to dwell.  Where had she  stopped the cab? What had become of her now? Had she been traced and  captured by the men in the chaise? Or was she still capable of  controlling her own actions; and were we two following our widely  parted roads towards one point in the mysterious future, at which we  were to meet once more?    It was a relief when the hour came to lock my door, to bid farewell to  London pursuits, London pupils, and London friends, and to be in  movement again towards new interests and a new life. Even the bustle  and confusion at the railway terminus, so wearisome and bewildering at  other times, roused me and did me good.        My travelling instructions directed me to go to Carlisle, and then to  diverge by a branch railway which ran in the direction of the coast.  As a misfortune to begin with, our engine broke down between Lancaster  and Carlisle.  The delay occasioned by this accident caused me to be  too late for the branch train, by which I was to have gone on  immediately.  I had to wait some hours; and when a later train finally  deposited me at the nearest station to Limmeridge House, it was past  ten, and the night was so dark that I could hardly see my way to the  pony-chaise which Mr. Fairlie had ordered to be in waiting for me.    The driver was evidently discomposed by the lateness of my arrival.  He  was in that state of highly respectful sulkiness which is peculiar to  English servants.  We drove away slowly through the darkness in perfect  silence.  The roads were bad, and the dense obscurity of the night  increased the difficulty of getting over the ground quickly.  It was,  by my watch, nearly an hour and a half from the time of our leaving the  station before I heard the sound of the sea in the distance, and the  crunch of our wheels on a smooth gravel drive.  We had passed one gate  before entering the drive, and we passed another before we drew up at  the house.  I was received by a solemn man-servant out of livery, was  informed that the family had retired for the night, and was then led  into a large and lofty room where my supper was awaiting me, in a  forlorn manner, at one extremity of a lonesome mahogany wilderness of  dining-table.    I was too tired and out of spirits to eat or drink much, especially  with the solemn servant waiting on me as elaborately as if a small  dinner party had arrived at the house instead of a solitary man.  In a  quarter of an hour I was ready to be taken up to my bedchamber.  The  solemn servant conducted me into a prettily furnished room--said,  \"Breakfast at nine o'clock, sir\"--looked all round him to see that  everything was in its proper place, and noiselessly withdrew.    \"What shall I see in my dreams to-night?\" I thought to myself, as I put  out the candle; \"the woman in white? or the unknown inhabitants of this  Cumberland mansion?\" It was a strange sensation to be sleeping in the  house, like a friend of the family, and yet not to know one of the  inmates, even by sight!        VI    When I rose the next morning and drew up my blind, the sea opened  before me joyously under the broad August sunlight, and the distant  coast of Scotland fringed the horizon with its lines of melting blue.    The view was such a surprise, and such a change to me, after my weary  London experience of brick and mortar landscape, that I seemed to burst  into a new life and a new set of thoughts the moment I looked at it.  A  confused sensation of having suddenly lost my familiarity with the  past, without acquiring any additional clearness of idea in reference  to the present or the future, took possession of my mind.  Circumstances that were but a few days old faded back in my memory, as  if they had happened months and months since.  Pesca's quaint  announcement of the means by which he had procured me my present  employment; the farewell evening I had passed with my mother and  sister; even my mysterious adventure on the way home from  Hampstead--had all become like events which might have occurred at some  former epoch of my existence.  Although the woman in white was still in  my mind, the image of her seemed to have grown dull and faint already.    A little before nine o'clock, I descended to the ground-floor of the  house.  The solemn man-servant of the night before met me wandering  among the passages, and compassionately showed me the way to the  breakfast-room.    My first glance round me, as the man opened the door, disclosed a  well-furnished breakfast-table, standing in the middle of a long room,  with many windows in it.  I looked from the table to the window  farthest from me, and saw a lady standing at it, with her back turned  towards me.  The instant my eyes rested on her, I was struck by the  rare beauty of her form, and by the unaffected grace of her attitude.  Her figure was tall, yet not too tall; comely and well-developed, yet  not fat; her head set on her shoulders with an easy, pliant firmness;  her waist, perfection in the eyes of a man, for it occupied its natural  place, it filled out its natural circle, it was visibly and  delightfully undeformed by stays.  She had not heard my entrance into  the room; and I allowed myself the luxury of admiring her for a few  moments, before I moved one of the chairs near me, as the least  embarrassing means of attracting her attention.  She turned towards me  immediately. The easy elegance of every movement of her limbs and body  as soon as she began to advance from the far end of the room, set me in  a flutter of expectation to see her face clearly.  She left the  window--and I said to myself, The lady is dark.  She moved forward a  few steps--and I said to myself, The lady is young.  She approached  nearer--and I said to myself (with a sense of surprise which words fail  me to express), The lady is ugly!    Never was the old conventional maxim, that Nature cannot err, more  flatly contradicted--never was the fair promise of a lovely figure more  strangely and startlingly belied by the face and head that crowned it.  The lady's complexion was almost swarthy, and the dark down on her  upper lip was almost a moustache.  She had a large, firm, masculine  mouth and jaw; prominent, piercing, resolute brown eyes; and thick,  coal-black hair, growing unusually low down on her forehead.  Her  expression--bright, frank, and intelligent--appeared, while she was  silent, to be altogether wanting in those feminine attractions of  gentleness and pliability, without which the beauty of the handsomest  woman alive is beauty incomplete.  To see such a face as this set on  shoulders that a sculptor would have longed to model--to be charmed by  the modest graces of action through which the symmetrical limbs  betrayed their beauty when they moved, and then to be almost repelled  by the masculine form and masculine look of the features in which the  perfectly shaped figure ended--was to feel a sensation oddly akin to  the helpless discomfort familiar to us all in sleep, when we recognise  yet cannot reconcile the anomalies and contradictions of a dream.    \"Mr. Hartright?\" said the lady interrogatively, her dark face lighting  up with a smile, and softening and growing womanly the moment she began  to speak.  \"We resigned all hope of you last night, and went to bed as  usual.  Accept my apologies for our apparent want of attention; and  allow me to introduce myself as one of your pupils.  Shall we shake  hands? I suppose we must come to it sooner or later--and why not  sooner?\"    These odd words of welcome were spoken in a clear, ringing, pleasant  voice.  The"]]]
