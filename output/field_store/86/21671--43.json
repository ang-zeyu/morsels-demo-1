These animals were  about fourteen hands high and averaged less than nine hundred pounds in  weight. A former blacksmith for the Company who was at one time located  at Seneca, Kansas, recalls that one of these native ponies often had to  be thrown and staked down with a rope tied to each foot before it could  be shod. Then, before the smith could pare the hoofs and nail on the  shoes, it was necessary for one man to sit astride the animal's head,  and another on its body, while the beast continued to struggle and  squeal. To shoe one of these animals often required a half day of  strenuous work.    As might be expected, the horse as well as rider traveled very light.  The combined weight of the saddle, bridle and saddle bags did not exceed  thirteen pounds. The saddle-bag used by the pony rider for carrying mail  was called a mochila; it had openings in the center so it would fit  snugly over the horn and tree of the saddle and yet be removable without  delay. The mochila had four pockets called cantinas in each of its  corners one in front and one behind each of the rider's legs. These  cantinas held the mail. All were kept carefully locked and three were  opened en route only at military posts--Forts Kearney, Laramie,  Bridger, Churchill and at Salt Lake City. The fourth pocket was for the  local or way mail-stations. Each local station-keeper had a key and  could open it when necessary. It held a time-card on which a record of  the arrival and departure at the various stations where it was opened,  was kept. Only one mochila was used on a trip; it was transferred by the  rider from one horse to another until the destination was reached.    Letters were wrapped in oil silk to protect them from moisture, either  from stormy weather, fording streams, or perspiring animals. While a  mail of twenty pounds might be carried, the average weight did not  exceed fifteen pounds. The postal charges were at first, five dollars  for each half-ounce letter, but this rate was afterward reduced by the  Post Office Department to one dollar for each half ounce. At this figure  it remained as long as the line was in business. In addition to this  rate, a regulation government envelope costing ten cents, had to be  purchased. Patrons generally made use of a specially light tissue paper  for their correspondence. The large newspapers of New York, Boston,  Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco were among the best customers of  the service. Some of the Eastern dailies even kept special  correspondents at St. Joseph to receive and telegraph to the home office  news from the West as soon as it arrived. On account of the enormous  postage rates these newspapers would print special editions of Civil War  news on the thinnest of paper to avoid all possible mailing bulk.    Mr. Frank A. Root of Topeka, Kansas, who was Assistant Postmaster and  Chief Clerk in the post office at Atchison during the last two months of  the line's existence, in 1861, says that during that period the Express,  which was running semi-weekly, brought about three hundred and fifty  letters each trip from California[10]. Many of these communications were  from government and state officials in California and Oregon, and  addressed to the Federal authorities at Washington, particularly to  Senators and Representatives from these states and to authorities of the  War Department. A few were addressed to Abraham Lincoln, President of  the United States. A large number of these letters were from business  and professional men in Portland, San Francisco, Oakland, and  Sacramento, and mailed to firms in the large cities of the East and  Middle West. Not to mention the rendering of invaluable help to the  Government in retaining California at the beginning of the War, the Pony  Express was of the greatest importance to the commercial interests of  the West.    The line was frequently used by the British Government in forwarding its  Asiatic correspondence to London. In 1860, a report of the activities of  the English fleet off the coast of China was sent through from San  Francisco eastward over this route. For the transmission of these  dispatches that Government paid one hundred and thirty-five dollars Pony  Express charges.    Nor did the commercial houses of the Pacific Coast cities appear to mind  a little expense in forwarding their business letters. Mr. Root says  there would often be twenty-five one dollar \"Pony\" stamps and the same  number of Government stamps--a total in postage of twenty-seven dollars  and fifty cents--on a single envelope. Not much frivolity passed  through these mails.    Pony Express riders received an average salary of from one hundred  dollars to one hundred and twenty-five dollars a month. A few whose  rides were particularly dangerous or who had braved unusual dangers  received one hundred and fifty dollars. Station men and their assistants  were paid from fifty to one hundred dollars monthly.    Of the eighty riders usually in the service, half were always riding in  either direction, East and West. The average \"run\" was seventy-five  miles, the men going and coming over their respective divisions on each  succeeding day. Yet there were many exceptions to this rule, as will be  shown later. At the outset, although facilities for shorter relays had  been provided, it was planned to run each horse twenty-five miles with  an average of three horses to the rider; but it was soon found that a  horse could rarely continue at a maximum speed for so great a distance.  Consequently, it soon became the practice to change mounts every ten or  twelve miles or as nearly that as possible. The exact distance was  governed largely by the nature of the country. While this shortening of  the relay necessitated transferring the mochila many more times on each  trip, it greatly facilitated the schedule; for it was at once seen that  the average horse or pony in the Express service could be crowded to the  limit of its speed over the reduced distance.    One of the station-keeper's most important duties was to have a fresh  horse saddled and bridled a half hour before the Express was due. Only  two minutes time was allowed for changing mounts. The rider's approach  was watched for with keen anxiety. By daylight he could generally be  seen in a cloud of dust, if in the desert or prairie regions. If in the  mountains, the clear air made it possible for the station men to detect  his approach a long way off, provided there were no obstructions to hide  the view. At night the rider would make his presence known by a few  lusty whoops. Dashing up to the station, no time was wasted. The courier  would already have loosed his mochila, which he tossed ahead for the  keeper to adjust on the fresh horse, before dismounting. A sudden  reining up of his foam-covered steed, and \"All's well along the road,  Hank!\" to the station boss, and he was again mounted and gone, usually  fifteen seconds after his arrival. Nor was there any longer delay when a  fresh rider took up the \"run.\"    Situated at intervals of about two hundred miles were division  points[11] in charge of locally important agents or superintendents.  Here were kept extra men, animals, and supplies as a precaution against  the raids of Indians, desperadoes, or any emergency likely to arise.  Division agents had considerable authority; their pay was as good as  that received by the best riders. They were men of a heroic and even in  some instances, desperate character, in spite of their oath of service.  In certain localities much infested with horse thievery and violence it  was necessary to have in charge men of the fight-the-devil-with-fire  type in order to keep the business in operation. Noted among this class  of Division agents, with headquarters at the Platte Crossing near Fort  Kearney, was Jack Slade[12], who, though a good servant of the Company,  turned out to be one of the worst \"bad\" men in the history of the West.  He had a record of twenty-six \"killings\" to his credit, but he kept his  Division thoroughly purged of horse thieves and savage marauders, for he  knew how to \"get\" his man whenever there was trouble.    The schedule was at first fixed at ten days for eight months of the year  and twelve days during the winter season, but this was soon lowered to  eight and ten days respectively. An average speed of ten miles an hour  including stops had to be maintained on the summer schedule. In the  winter the run was sustained at eight miles an hour; deep snows made the  latter performance the more difficult of the two.    The best record made by the Pony Express was in getting President  Lincoln's inaugural speech across the continent in March, 1861. This  address, outlining as it did the attitude of the new Chief Executive  toward the pending conflict, was anticipated with the deepest anxiety by  the people on the Pacific Coast. Evidently inspired by the urgency of  the situation, the Company determined to surpass all performances.  Horses were led out, in many cases, two or three miles from the  stations, in order to meet the incoming riders and to secure the supreme  limit of speed and endurance on this momentous trip. The document was  carried through from St. Joseph to Sacramento--1966 miles--in just  seven days and seventeen hours, an average speed of ten and six-tenths  miles an hour. And this by flesh and blood, pounding the dirt over the  plains, mountains, and deserts! The best individual performance on this  great run was by \"Pony Bob\" Haslam who galloped the one hundred and  twenty miles from Smith's Creek to Fort Churchill in eight hours and ten  minutes, an average of fourteen and seven-tenths miles per hour. On this  record-breaking trip the message was carried the six hundred and  seventy-five miles between St. Joseph and Denver[13] in sixty-nine  hours; the last ten miles of this leg of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4675"],[0,"The Sea-Witch; Or, The African Quadroon: A Story of the Slave Coast (#6)"],[1," have worshipped. She was  strikingly handsome, and there was a brilliancy and spirit in the glance  of her dark eyes that told of much character, and much depth of feeling;  and while you gazed at her now, sitting beneath the broad piazza, you  would have detected a shadow ever and anon cross her brow, as though the  words of him by her side aroused some unpleasant memory, and diverted  her thoughts rather to past scenes than to the consideration of his  immediate remarks.    The gentleman who seemed to be pleading an unsuccessful suit, wore the  undress uniform of the English navy, and in the outer harbor, in view of  the very spot where they sat, there rode a sloop-of-war with St.  George's cross floating at her peak. The officer was young, but bore the  insignia of his rank upon his person, which showed him to be the captain  of yonder proud vessel. He might have been five or six and twenty, but  scarcely more, and bore about him those unmistakable tokens of gentle  birth which will shine through the coarsest as well as the finest  attire. The lady was not regarding him now; her eyes were bent on the  distant sea, but still he pleaded, still urged in gentle tones the suit  he brought.    \"I see, Miss Huntington has some more favored swain on whom to bestow  her favors; but I am sure that she has no truer friend, or more ardent  admirer.\"    \"You are altogether mistaken in your premises,\" she said, coolly, as she  tossed her fragrant fan of sandal wood, perfuming the soft atmosphere  about them.    \"A subject who sues for a favor at court, Miss Huntington, if he is  unsuccessful, thinks himself at least entitled to know the reason why he  is denied.\"    \"But suppose the Court declines to give him a reason,\" said the lady,  still coolly.    \"Its decision admits of no appeal, I must acknowledge,\" replied her  suitor.    \"Then reason I have none, captain; and so pray let that suffice.\"    \"But, Miss Huntington, surely--\"    \"Nay, captain,\" she said, at last, weary of his importunity, \"you know  well my feelings. Far be it from me to play for one moment the  coquette's part. I thank you for the compliment you pay me by these  assurances, but you are fully aware that I can never encourage a suit  that finds no response in my heart. I trust that no word or act of mine  has ever deceived you for one moment.\"    \"No, Miss Huntington, you have ever been thus cold and impassive towards  me, ever turning a deaf ear to my prayer. Why, why can you not love me?\"    \"Nay, captain, we will not enter into particulars; it is needless, it is  worse than needless, and a matter that is exceedingly unpleasant to me.  I must earnestly beg, sir, that you will not again refer to this subject  under any circumstance.\"    \"Your commands are law to me, Miss Huntington,\" answered the discomfited  lover, as he rose from the seat he had occupied by her side, and turned  partially away.    It was well he did so, for had she seen the demoniac expression of his  countenance as he struggled to control the vehemence of his feelings,  she would have feared that he might do either her or himself violence.    \"May I not hope that years of fond attachment, years of continued  assiduity, may yet outweigh your indifference, Miss Huntington?\" he said  earnestly.    \"Indeed, indeed no. You do but pain me by this continuance of a subject  that--Ah, mother!\" she said, interrupting herself, \"I have been looking  at the captain's ship, yonder; is she not a noble craft? And how  daintily she floats upon the waters?\"    \"A ship is always a beautiful sight, my child; and especially so when  she bears the flag that we see flaunting gracefully from that vessel.\"    \"When do you sail, captain?\" asked Mrs. Huntington, who had just joined  her daughter on the piazza, and did not observe the officer's confusion.    \"The ship rides by a single anchor, madam, and only waits her  commander,\" he replied, rather mechanically than otherwise, as he turned  his glance seaward.    \"So soon? I had hoped you were to favor us with a longer stay,\" said she  mother.    The officer looked towards the daughter, as though he wished it had been  her that had expressed such a desire. But she still gazed at the distant  ship, and he saw no change in her handsome features.    \"We officers are not masters of our own time, madam, and can rarely  consult our own wishes as to a cruising ground; but I frankly own that  it was something more than mere accident which brought me this time to  Calcutta.\"    As he said this, his eyes again wandered towards her daughter's face,  but it was still cold, impassive and beautiful as before, while she  gazed on that distant sea. He paused for a moment more, almost trembling  with suppressed emotions of disappointment, chagrin and anger, and  seemed at a loss what to say further; he felt constrained, and wished  that he might have seen the daughter for a moment more alone.    \"Farewell is an unpleasant word to say, ladies,\" he said, at last, still  controlling his feelings with a masterly effort. Then offerings a hand  to the mother, he bowed respectfully and said \"Good-by;\" and to her, who  now turned with evident feeling evinced in her lovely face at the idea  of a long parting, he offered his hand, which was frankly pressed, while  he said: \"I carry away a heavy heart to sea with me, Miss Huntington;  could it be weighed, it would overballast yonder ship.\"    \"Farewell, captain; a happy and safe voyage to you,\" she answered, with  assumed gaiety of tone; but there was no reply. He bowed low and  hastened away, with a spirit of disappointment clouding his sun-burned  features.    The view which might be had from the window commanded a continuous sight  of the road that the young officer must traverse to reach the ship, and  though she had treated him thus coldly, and had so decidedly declined  his suit, yet here lingered some strange interest about him in her mind,  as was evinced by her now repairing to the window, and sitting behind  the broad shadow of its painted screen, where she watched his approach  to she landing, near the city gates, and saw the sturdy boatmen dip  their oars in regular time, propelling the boat with arrow-like speed to  the ship's side, where its master hastened upon deck and disappeared,  while the boat was hoisted to the quarter-davits.    Anon she saw the sheets fall from the ponderous yards, and sheeted home,  the anchor gradually raised to her bow, the yards squared to bring her  with her head to the sea, and then a clear white cloud of smoke burst  from her bows as she gathered steerage-way, and a dull heavy report of  distant ordinance boomed upon the ear of the listening girl, unanswered  by a deep sigh from her own bosom--a sigh not for him who had just left  her, but for some kindred association that his presence aroused.    The villa where we have introduced the reader was that of the late  Edward Huntington, a successful English merchant, who had resided many  years in India and had realized a fortune, which he had proposed to  return to his native land to enjoy with his wife and only child. But  death had stepped in to put an abrupt end to his hopes, and to render  abortive all his well-arranged plans, some twelve months previous to  the period of which we have spoken. Mrs. Huntington, the widow, had  remained in Calcutta to settle up her husband's affairs, and this done,  she determined to embark at once with her daughter for England, where  her relatives, friends and early associations were all located.    Miss Huntington, as the reader may have gathered, was no coquette; her  great beauty and real loveliness of character had challenged the  admiration of many a rich grandee and many an eminent character among  her own countrymen in this distant land. But no one had seemed to mate  the least impression upon her heart; the gayest and wittiest found in  her one quite their equal; the thoughtful and pathetic were equally at  home by her side; but her heart, to them, seemed encased in iron, so  cold and immovable it continued to all the assaults that gallantry made  against its fastness, and yet no one who knew her really doubted the  tenderness of her feelings and the sensibility of her heart.    Her beauty was quite matured--that is she must have numbered at least  twenty years; but there was still a girlish loveliness, a childlike  parity and sincerity in all she said and did, that showed the real  freshness of her heart and innocence of her mind. Far too pure and good  and gentle was she for him who had so earnestly sued for her hand, as we  have seen. Beneath a gentlemanly exterior, that other, whom we have seen  depart from her side under such peculiar circumstances, hid a spirit of  petty meanness and violence of temper, a soul that hardly merited the  name, and which made him enemies everywhere, friends nowhere.    Robert Bramble--for this was he, the same whom the reader has seen as a  boy at home in Bramble Park--had not improved in spirit or manliness by  advance in years. The declining pecuniary fortune of his father's house,  to which we have before alluded, had led him early to seek employment in  the navy, and by dint of influence and attention to his profession, he  had gradually risen to the position in which we have found him, as a  commander in her majesty's service on the India station. That he loved  the widow's daughter was true--that is to say, as sincerely as he was  capable of loving any one; but his soul was too selfish to entertain  true love for another.    The same spirit that had led him to the petty oppressions and the  ceaseless annoyances which he had exercised towards his younger brother  in childhood, still actuated him, and there was not a gleam of that  chivalric spirit which his profession usually inspires in those who  adopt it as a calling, shining within the recesses of his breast.  Entirely unlike Miss Huntington in every particular, we have yet seen  that he exercised "]]]
