And thus it is said how  Zebulun is born.          CAPITULUM IX    HOW ORDAINED SHAME RISETH AND GROWETH IN THE AFFECTION      BUT though all that a soul through grace feel in it perfect hatred  of sin, whether it may yet live without sin? Nay, sikerly;[93] and  therefore let no man presume of himself, when the Apostle saith  thus: \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourself, and  soothfastness is not in us.\"[94] And also saint Austin saith that he  dare well say that there is no man living without sin.[95] And I  pray thee, who is he that sinneth not in ignorance? Yea, and oft  times it falleth that God suffereth those men to fall full  grievously by the which He hath ordained other men's errors to be  righted, that they may learn by their own falling how merciful they  shall be in amending of others. And for that oft times men fall  grievously in those same sins that they most hate, therefore, after  hatred of sin, springeth ordained shame in a man's soul; and so it  is that after Zebulun was Dinah born. As by Zebulun hatred of sin,  so by Dinah is understanden ordained shame of sin. But wete thou  well: he that felt never Zebulun, felt never yet Dinah. Evil men  have a manner of shame, but it is not this ordained shame. For why,  if they had perfect shame of sin, they should not so customably do  it with will and advisement;[96] but they shame more with a foul  cloth on their body, than with a foul thought in their soul. But  what so thou be that weenest that thou hast gotten Dinah, think  whether thee would shame as much if a foul thought were in thine  heart, as thee would if thou were made to stand naked before the  king and all his royalme; and sikerly else wete it thou right well  that thou hast not yet gotten ordained shame in thy feeling, if so  be that thou have less shame with thy foul heart than with thy foul  body, and if thou think more shame with thy foul body in the sight  of men than with thy foul heart in the sight of the King of heaven  and of all His angels and holy saints in heaven.    Lo, it is now said of the seven children of Leah, by the which are  understanden seven manner of affections in a man's soul, the which  may be now ordained and now unordained, now measured and now  unmeasured; but when they are ordained and measured, then are they  virtues; and when they are unordained and unmeasured, then are they  vices. Thus behoveth a man have children[97] that they be not only  ordained, but also measured. Then are they ordained when they are of  that thing that they should be, and then are they unordained when  they are of that thing that they should not be; and then are they  measured when they are as much as they should be, and then are they  unmeasured when they are more than they should be. For why, overmuch  dread bringeth in despair, and overmuch sorrow casteth a man in to  bitterness and heaviness of kind,[98] for the which he is unable to  receive ghostly comfort. And overmuch hope is presumption, and  outrageous love is but flattering and faging,[99] and outrageous  gladness is dissolution and wantonness, and untempered hatred of sin  is woodness.[100] And on this manner, they are unordained and  unmeasured, and thus are they turned in to vices, and then lose they  the name of virtues, and may not be accounted amongst the sons of  Jacob, that is to say, God: for by Jacob is understanden God, as it  is shewed in the figure before.          CAPITULUM X    HOW DISCRETION AND CONTEMPLATION RISE IN THE REASON      Thus it seemeth that the virtue of discretion needeth to be had,  with the which all others may be governed; for without it all  virtues are turned in to vices. This is Joseph, that is the late  born child, but yet his father loveth him more than them all. For  why, without discretion may neither goodness be gotten nor kept, and  therefore no wonder though that virtue be singularly loved, without  which no virtue may be had nor governed. But what wonder though this  virtue be late gotten, when we may not win to the perfection of  discretion without much custom and many travails of these other  affections coming before? For first behoveth us to be used in each  virtue by itself, and get the proof of them all serely,[101] ere we  may have full knowing of them all, or else can deem sufficiently of  them all. And when we use us busily in these feelings and beholdings  before said, oft times we fall and oft times we rise. Then, by our  oft falling, may we learn how much wariness us behoveth have in the  getting and keeping of these virtues. And thus sometime, by long  use, a soul is led into full discretion, and then it may joy in the  birth of Joseph. And before this virtue be conceived in a man's  soul, all that these other virtues do, it is without discretion. And  therefore, in as much as a man presumeth and enforceth him in any of  these feelings beforesaid, over his might and out of measure, in so  much the fouler he falleth and faileth of his purpose. And therefore  it is that, after them all and last, is Dinah born; for often, after  a foul fall and a failing, cometh soon shame. And thus after many  failings and failings, and shames following, a man learneth by the  proof that there is nothing better than to be ruled after counsel,  the which is the readiest getting of discretion. For why, he that  doth all things with counsel, he shall never forthink[102] it; for  better is a sly man than a strong man; yea, and better is list than  lither strength,[103] and a sly man speaketh of victories. And here  is the open skill why that neither Leah nor Zilpah nor Bilhah might  bear such a child, but only Rachel; for, as it is said before, that  of reason springeth right counsel, the which is very discretion,  understanden by Joseph, the first son of Rachel; and then at the  first bring we forth Joseph in our reason when all that we are  stirred to do, we do it with counsel. This Joseph shall not only  know what sins we are most stirred unto, but also he shall know the  weakness of our kind, and after that either asketh, so shall he do  remedy, and seek counsel at wiser than he, and do after them, or  else he is not Joseph, Jacob's son born of Rachel. And also by this  foresaid[104] Joseph a man is not only learned to eschew the deceits  of his enemies, but also oft a man is led by him to the perfect  knowing of himself; and all after that a man knoweth himself,  thereafter he profiteth in the knowing of God, of whom he is the  image and the likeness. And therefore it is that after Joseph is  Benjamin born. For as by Joseph discretion, so by Benjamin we  understand contemplation. And both are they born of one mother, and  gotten of one father. For through the grace of God lightening our  reason, come we to the perfect knowing of ourself and of God, that  is to say, after that it may be in this life. But long after Joseph  is Benjamin born. For why, truly but if it so be that we use us  busily and long in ghostly travails, with the which we are learned  to know ourself, we may not be raised in to the knowing and  contemplation of God. He doth for nought that lifteth up his eye to  the sight of God, that is not yet able to see himself. For first I  would that a man learned him to know the unseeable[105] things of  his own spirit, ere he presume to know the unseeable things of the  spirit of God; and he that knoweth not yet himself and weeneth that  he hath gotten somedeal knowing of the unseeable things of God, I  doubt it not but that he is deceived; and therefore I rede that a  man seek first busily for to know himself, the which is made to the  image and the likeness of God as in soul. And wete thou well that he  that desireth for to see God, him behoveth to cleanse his soul, the  which is as a mirror in the which all things are clearly seen, when  it is clean; and when the mirror is foul, then mayst thou see  nothing clearly therein; and right so it is of thy soul, when it is  foul, neither thou knowest thyself nor God. As when the candle  brenneth, thou mayst then see the self candle[106] by the light  thereof, and other things also; right so, when thy soul brenneth in  the love of God, that is, when thou feelest continually thine heart  desire after the love of God, then, by the light of His grace that  He sendeth in thy reason, thou mayst see both thine own unworthiness  and His great goodness. And therefore cleanse thy mirror and proffer  thy candle to the fire; and then, when thy mirror is cleansed and  thy candle brenning, and it so be that thou wittily behold thereto,  then beginneth there a manner of clarity of the light of God for to  shine in thy soul, and a manner of sunbeam that is ghostly to appear  before thy ghostly sight, through the which the eye of thy soul is  opened to behold God and godly things, heaven and heavenly things,  and all manner of ghostly things. But this sight is but by times,  when God will vouchsafe for to give it to a working[107] soul, the  whiles it is in the battle of this deadly life; but after this life  it shall be everlasting. This light shone in the soul of David, when  he said thus in the psalm: \"Lord, the light of Thy face is marked  upon us; Thou hast given gladness within mine heart.\"[108] The light  of God's face is the shining of His grace, that reformeth in us His  image that hath been disfigured with the darkness of sin; and  therefore a soul that brenneth in desire of His sight,[109] if it  hope for to have that that it desireth, wete it well it hath  conceived Benjamin. And, therefore, what is more healfull[110] than  the sweetness of this sight, or what softer thing may be felt?

The Roman, on the contrary, abandoned to his own sole  responsibility, felt himself free from all shackles; he commanded as  master within the sphere of his attributes. The counterpoise of this  independence was the short duration of his office, and the right, given  to every man, of accusing each magistrate at the end of it.    The preponderance of the high class, then, rested upon a legitimate  superiority, and this class, besides, knew how to work to its advantage  the popular passions. They desired liberty only for themselves, but they  knew how to make the image glitter in the eyes of the multitude, and the  name of the people was always associated with the decrees of the Senate.  Proud of having contributed to the overthrow of the power of one  individual, they took care to cherish among the masses the imaginary  fear of the return of kingly power. In their hands the _hate of tyrants_  will become a weapon to be dreaded by all who shall seek to raise  themselves above their fellows, either by threatening their privileges,  or by acquiring too much popularity by their acts of benevolence. Thus,  under the pretext, renewed incessantly, of aspiring to kingly power,  fell the consul Spurius Cassius, in 269, because he had presented the  first agrarian law; Spurius Melius, in 315, because he excited the  jealousy of the patricians by distributing wheat to the people during a  famine;[90] in 369, Manlius, the saviour of Rome, because he had  expended his fortune in relieving insolvent debtors.[91] Thus will fall  victims to the same accusation the reformer Tiberius Sempronius  Gracchus, and lastly, at a later period, the great Caesar himself.    But if the pretended fear of the return of the ancient _regime_ was a  powerful means of government in the hands of the patricians, the real  fear of seeing their privileges attacked by the plebeians restrained  them within the bounds of moderation and justice.    In fact, if the numerous class, excluded from all office, had not  interfered by their clamours to set limits to the privileges of the  nobility, and thus compelled it to render itself worthy of power by its  virtues, and re-invigorated it, in some sort, by the infusion of new  blood, corruption and arbitrary spirit would, some ages earlier, have  dragged it to its ruin. A caste which is not renewed by foreign elements  is condemned to disappear; and absolute power, whether it belongs to one  man or to a class of individuals, finishes always by being equally  dangerous to him who exercises it. This concurrence of the plebeians  excited in the Republic a fortunate emulation which produced great men,  for, as Machiavelli says:[92] \"The fear of losing gives birth in men's  hearts to the same passions as the desire of acquiring.\" Although the  aristocracy had long defended with obstinacy its privileges, it made  opportunely useful concessions. Skilful in repairing incessantly its  defeats, it took again, under another form, what it had been constrained  to abandon, losing often some of its attributes, but preserving its  prestige always untouched.    Thus, the characteristic fact of the Roman institutions was to form men  apt for all functions. As long as on a narrow theatre the ruling class  had the wisdom to limit its ambition to promoting the veritable  interests of their country, as the seduction of riches and unbounded  power did not come to exalt it beyond measure, the aristocratic system  maintained itself with all its advantages, and overruled the instability  of institutions. It alone, indeed, was capable of supporting long,  without succumbing, a _regime_ in which the direction of the State and  the command of the armies passed annually into different hands, and  depended upon elections the element of which is ever fickle. Besides,  the laws gave rise to antagonisms more calculated to cause anarchy than  to consolidate true liberty. Let us examine, in these last relations,  the constitution of the Republic.      [Sidenote: Institutions of the Republic.]    II. The two consuls were originally generals, judges, and  administrators; equal in powers, they were often in disagreement, either  in the Forum,[93] or on the field of battle.[94] Their dissensions were  repeated many times until the consulate of Caesar and Bibulus; and they  were liable to become the more dangerous as the decision of one consul  was annulled by the opposition of his colleague. On the other hand, the  short duration of their magistracy constrained them either to hurry a  battle in order to rob their successor of the glory,[95] or to interrupt  a campaign in order to proceed to Rome to hold the comitia. The defeats  of the Trebia and Cannae, with that of Servilius Caepio by the Cimbri,[96]  were fatal examples of the want of unity in the direction of war.    In order to lessen the evil effects of a simultaneous exercise of their  prerogatives, the consuls agreed to take in campaign the command  alternately day by day, and at Rome each to have the fasces during a  month; but this innovation had also vexatious consequences.[97] It was  even thought necessary, nine years after the fall of the kings, to have  recourse to the dictatorship; and this absolute authority, limited to  six months, that is, to the longest duration of a campaign, only  remedied temporarily, and under extraordinary circumstances, the want of  power concentrated in a single individual.    This dualism and instability of the supreme authority were not,  therefore, an element of strength; the unity and fixity of direction  necessary among a people always at war had disappeared; but the evil  would have been more serious if the conformity of interests and views of  individuals belonging to the same caste had not been there to lessen it.  The man was worth more than the institutions which had formed him.    The creation of tribunes of the people, whose part became subsequently  so important, was, in 260, a new cause of discord; the plebeians, who  composed the greater part of the army, claimed to have their military  chiefs for magistrates;[98] the authority of the tribunes was at first  limited: we may convince ourselves of this by the following terms of the  law which established the office:[99]--    \"Nobody shall constrain a tribune of the people, like a man of the  commonalty, to do anything against his will; it shall not be permitted  either to strike him, or to cause him to be maltreated by another, or to  slay him or cause him to be slain.\"[100]    We may judge by this the degree of inferiority to which the plebeians  were reduced. The veto of the tribunes could nevertheless put a stop to  the proposal of a law, prevent the decisions of the consuls and Senate,  arrest the levies of troops, prorogue the convocation of the comitia,  and hinder the election of magistrates.[101] From the year 297, their  number was raised to ten, that is, two for each of the five classes  specially subject to the recruitment;[102] but the plebeians profited  little by this measure; the more the number of tribunes was augmented,  the easier it became for the aristocracy to find among them an  instrument for its designs. Gradually their influence increased; in 298,  they laid claim to the right of convoking the Senate, and yet it was  still a long time before they formed part of that body.[103]    As to the comitia, the people had there only a feeble influence. In the  assemblies by centuries, the vote of the first classes, composed of the  richest citizens, as we have seen, prevailed over all the others; in  the comitia by curiae, the patricians were absolute masters; and when,  towards the end of the third century, the plebeians obtained the comitia  by tribes,[104] this concession did not add sensibly to their  prerogatives. It was confined to the power of assembling in the public  places where, divided according to tribes, they placed their votes in  urns for the election of their tribunes and ediles, previously elected  by the centuries;[105] their decisions concerned themselves only, and  entailed no obligations on the patricians; so that the same town then  offered the spectacle of two cities each having its own magistrates and  laws.[106] At first the patricians would not form part of the assembly  by tribes, but they soon saw the advantage of it, and, towards 305,  entered it with their clients.[107]      [Sidenote: Transformation of the Aristocracy.]    III. This political organisation, the reflex of a society composed of so  many different elements, could hardly have constituted a durable order  of things, if the ascendency of a privileged class had not controlled  the causes of dissensions. This ascendency itself would soon have  diminished if concessions, forced or voluntary, had not gradually  lowered the barriers between the two orders.    In fact, the arbitrary conduct of the consuls, who were, perhaps,  originally nominated by the Senate alone,[108] excited sharp  recriminations: \"the consular authority,\" cried the plebeians, \"was, in  reality, almost as heavy as that of the kings. Instead of one master  they had two, invested with absolute and unlimited power, without rule  or bridle, who turned against the people all the threats of the laws,  and all their punishments.\"[109] Although after the year 283 the  patricians and plebeians were subjected to the same judges,[110] the  want of fixed laws left the goods and lives of the citizens delivered  to the will either of the consuls or of the tribunes. It became,  therefore, indispensable to establish the legislation on a solid basis,  and in 303 ten magistrates called _decemvirs_ were chosen, invested with  the double power, consular and tribunitian, which gave them the right of  convoking equally the assemblies by centuries and by tribes. They were  charged with the compilation of a code of laws afterwards known as the  _Laws of the Twelve Tables_, which,"]]]
