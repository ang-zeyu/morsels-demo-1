Wolsey won his way by  his political genius, his quickness, and his vast power of detailed  work. He owed his position entirely to the king, and was responsible to  him alone. The king consulted his Council only about such matters as he  thought fit; foreign affairs were managed almost entirely according to  his own will and pleasure.    The English have never been famous for diplomacy, and Wolsey was ill  supplied with agents for his work. The English residents at foreign  Courts were not men of mark or position. John Stile at the Court of  Ferdinand, and Thomas Spinelly in Flanders seem to have been merchants  carrying on their own business. With Maximilian was a more important  man, Sir Richard Wingfield, a Suffolk knight, who was too self-satisfied  and too dull-witted to understand Wolsey's schemes. For special work  special agents had to be sent, who went unwillingly to a thankless and  laborious task. They were ill paid and ill supported; but even here  Wolsey knew how to choose the right men, and he managed to inspire them  with his own zeal and tenacity of purpose. It is a striking proof of  Wolsey's genius that he knew whom he could trust, and that his trust was  never misplaced.    When Henry VIII. was smarting under his rebuff from Maximilian and  Ferdinand, he concerted with Wolsey how he might avenge himself, and  Wolsey devised his scheme in entire secrecy. Ferdinand and Maximilian  had left England in the lurch by making a truce with France. Wolsey  resolved to outdo them in their own lines. They had elected to maintain  the existing condition of affairs by checking England's aspirations and  lending a cold support to France. Wolsey resolved to turn France into a  firm ally, that so England and France united might form a new  combination, before which the schemes of Ferdinand would be powerless.    Wolsey luckily had the means of approaching Louis XII. without  attracting attention. Amongst the prisoners taken in the Battle of the  Spurs was the young Duke of Longueville, a favourite of the French king.  He had been sent to London, to the sore disturbance of Queen Katharine,  who, being a sensible woman, thought that the best thing to do with a  prisoner was to confine him in the Tower. On Henry's return the Duke of  Longueville was released, and amused himself at Court like any one else.  Through him Wolsey opened up secret communications with Louis XII.,  whose domestic circumstances luckily gave a handle for Wolsey's designs.  In January 1514 the French queen died; and although the widowed husband  had reached the age of fifty-two, it was known that he was looking out  for a young bride.    It has always been one of the most revolting features of dynastic  politics that the private relationships of members of ruling families  have been entirely determined by considerations of dynastic expediency.  In the sixteenth century this was eminently the case. Alliances  were family arrangements, and corresponded to motives of family  aggrandisement rather than to national interests. They were sealed  by marriages, they were broken by divorces. So great were the  responsibilities of royalty that the private life of members of royal  houses was entirely sunk in their official position. They were mere  counters to be moved about the board at will, and disposed of according  to the needs of family politics. Such a victim of circumstances was  Henry VIII.'s younger sister, the Princess Mary, a bright and  intelligent girl of seventeen. She was betrothed to Charles, Prince of  Castile, and it had been arranged that the marriage should take place  when he reached the age of fourteen. The time was come for the  fulfilment of the promise; but Ferdinand did not wish to see his  troublesome grandson more closely united to England, which had shown  such ambitious inclinations. Maximilian, the guardian of Charles,  wavered between his desire to please Henry and Ferdinand, and invented  one excuse after another for not proceeding with his grandson's marriage.    Wolsey allowed Maximilian to go on with his shifty talk, and was only  too glad to see him fall into the trap. His negotiations with France  were progressing, and the outward sign of the new alliance was to be the  marriage of Mary to Louis XII. So secretly were the arrangements made  that Europe was taken by surprise when, at the end of July, it was  gradually known that the alliance between France and England was an  accomplished fact. The marriage contract was soon signed, and in October  Mary went to Abbeville, where she was met by her elderly husband.    The result of this clever diplomacy was to secure England the respect  and envy of Europe. It was clear that henceforth England was a power  which had to be reckoned with. Ferdinand was taught that he could no  longer count on using his dutiful son-in-law as he thought most  convenient to himself. Maximilian sadly reflected that if he needed  English gold in the future he must show a little more dexterity in his  game of playing fast and loose with everybody. Pope Leo X. was not  over-pleased at seeing England develop a policy of her own, and looked  coldly on Wolsey. After the death of Cardinal Bainbridge Henry wrote to  the Pope and begged him to make Wolsey cardinal in his room. \"Such are  his merits,\" said the king, \"that I esteem him above my dearest friends,  and can do nothing of importance without him.\" Leo X. coldly replied  that there were great difficulties in the way of creating a cardinal:  the title, he reminded the king, was much sought after, and admitted its  bearer to the highest rank: he must wait a more suitable time. It would  seem that the Pope wished to have further guarantees of England's  goodwill, and hinted that Wolsey must give pledges of his good behaviour.    England did not long enjoy the diplomatic victory which Wolsey had won  by his brilliant scheme of a French alliance. Henry still had a longing  for military glory, with which Wolsey had little sympathy. He wished to  revenge himself on his perfidious father-in-law, and proposed to Louis  XII. an attack upon Navarre, and even thought of claiming a portion of  the kingdom of Castile, as rightfully belonging to Queen Katharine.  Whatever projects Henry may have had came to an end on the death of  Louis on the 1st of January 1515. The elderly bridegroom, it was said,  tried too well to humour the social disposition of his sprightly bride.  He changed his manner of life, and kept late hours, till his health  entirely gave way, and he sank under his well-meant efforts to renew the  gallantry of youth.           CHAPTER III   THE UNIVERSAL PEACE   1515-1518      The death of Louis XII. was a severe blow to Wolsey. The French alliance  was not popular in England, and was bitterly opposed by the Duke of  Norfolk and the party of the old nobility, who saw with dislike the  growing influence of Wolsey. They now had an opportunity of reversing  his policy and securing his downfall. It required all Wolsey's sagacity  to devise a means of solving the difficulties which the death of Louis  created. The new King of France, Francis I., was aged twenty-one, and  was as ambitious of distinction as was Henry. The treaty between France  and England had not yet been carried out, and it would require much  dexterity to modify its provisions. The kings of the sixteenth century  were keen men of business, and never let money slip through their hands.  The widowed Queen of France must, of course, return to England, but  there were all sorts of questions about her dowry and the jewels which  Louis had given her. Henry claimed that she should bring back with her  everything to which any title could be urged: Francis I. wished to give  up as little as possible. The two monarchs haggled like two hucksters,  and neither of them had any care of the happiness or reputation of the  young girl round whom they bickered. In the background stood Wolsey's  enemies, who saw that if they could create a rupture between France and  England Wolsey's influence would be at an end.    In these dangerous conditions Wolsey had to seek an ally in Charles  Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, and had to trust to his private knowledge of  the character of Queen Mary. She had the strong will of the Tudors, and  had also their craving for admiration. These two qualities seem to have  drawn her in opposite directions. While her marriage with Prince Charles  was talked of she professed the greatest admiration for him, and gazed  with rapture on a very bad portrait of her intended husband. But this  did not prevent her from being attracted by the personal fascinations of  the Duke of Suffolk, as Wolsey knew. When he negotiated the French  alliance he had some difficulty in overcoming Mary's repugnance to an  old husband; but she viewed the proposal in a business-like way, and was  not indifferent to the position of Queen of France. She looked forward  to a speedy widowhood, and extracted from Henry a promise that, if she  undertook to marry for the first time to please him, she might choose  her second husband to please herself. When Mary was free the hopes of  the Duke of Suffolk revived, and Wolsey knowing this, chose him as the  best instrument for clearing away the difficulties raised by Francis I.,  and bringing back Mary honourably to England.    Francis, on his side, used his knowledge of the current rumour to  extract from Mary her confidences about Suffolk, and with this knowledge  approached Suffolk as a friend. By alternately encouraging Suffolk and  terrifying Mary he turned Wolsey's ambassador into an anxious lover.  Still Wolsey trusted that Suffolk would the more bestir himself to bring  Mary back, and would make such terms with Francis as would commend his  suit to Henry. But Wolsey's enemies led Henry to make exorbitant  demands, which Francis met by redoubling his"]]]
