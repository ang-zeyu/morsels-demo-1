The National Union for the Total      Independence of Angola (UNITA), led by Jonas SAVIMBI, has been in insurgency      since 1975, but as a result of the peace accords is now a legally recognized      political party.

Oil production is vital      to the economy, contributing about 60% to GDP. In recent years, a bitter      internal war has severely affected the nonoil economy, and food has to be      imported. For the long run, Angola has the advantage of rich natural      resources in addition to oil, notably gold, diamonds, and arable land. To      realize its economic potential Angola not only must secure domestic peace      but also must reform government policies that have led to distortions and      imbalances throughout the economy.

LOGE          And wherefore, wise one,        Sped not the plan?    MIME      Ah! though the helm I fashioned,    The magic that lurks therein    I foolishly failed to divine.        He who set the task        And seized the fruits--        From him I have learnt,        Alas I but too late!    All the helmet's cunning craft.        From my sight he vanished,        But, viciously lashing,    Swung his arm through unseen.            [_Howling and sobbing._          This, fool that I am,        Was all my thanks!            [_He rubs his back. Wotan and Loge laugh._    LOGE [_To Wotan._          Confess, our task        Will call for skill.    WOTAN          Yet the foe will yield,        Use thou but fraud.    MIME [_Observes the Gods more attentively._          Who are you, ye strangers        That ask all these questions?    LOGE          Friends to thee,        Who from their straits    Will free all the Nibelung folk.    MIME [_Shrinking back in fear when he hears Alberich returning._          Hark! Have a care!        Alberich comes!            [He runs to and fro in terror.    WOTAN          We'll wait for him here.            [_He sits down calmly on a stone. Alberich, who          has taken the Tarnhelm from his head and hung it          on his girdle, is brandishing his scourge and          driving before him a band of Nibelungs from the          gorges below. These are laden with gold and silver          treasure, which, urged on by Alberich, they pile up          so as to form a large heap._    ALBERICH          Hither! Thither!        Héhé! Hoho!        Lazy herd!        Haste and heap        Higher the hoard.        Up with thee there!        On with thee here!        Indolent dolts,        Down with the treasure!        Need ye my urging?        Here with it all!            [_He suddenly perceives Wotan and Loge._          Hey! Who are they        That thus intrude?        Mime! Come here!        Rascally rogue!        Gossiping art        With the pilgriming pair?        Off, thou idler!    Back to thy bellows and beating!            [_Lashing Mime, he chases him into the crowd of          Nibelungs._          Hey! to your labour!        Get ye all hence now!        Swing ye down swift!    From the virgin gorges    Get me the gold!    This whip will follow,    Delve ye not fast!    That labour ye shirk not    Mime be surety,    Or surely the lash    Of my whip will find him;    That where no one would guess    I watch and I wander,    None knows it better than he.    Loitering still?    Lingering there?    [Illustration: Plate 12, Alberich drives in a band of Nibelungs laden with gold  and silver treasure.]            [_He pulls the ring from his finger, kisses it and          stretches it out in menace._          Fear ye and tremble,        O fallen host,        And obey        The ring's dread lord!            [_Howling and shrieking, the Nibelungs, among them          Mime, scatter, and creep down into the clefts in          all directions._    ALBERICH          What seek ye here?            [_Looks long and distrustfully at Wotan and Loge._    WOTAN      From Nibelheim's gloomy realm    Strange tidings have travelled up,        Tales of wonders        Worked here by Alberich;        And, greedy of marvels,    Hither came we as guests.    ALBERICH          By envy urged,        Hither ye hie.        Such doughty guests    I do not mistake.    LOGE          Since I am known,        Ignorant elf,        Say then, with growling        Whom dost thou greet?        In caverns cold        Where once thou didst crouch,        Who gave thee light        And fire for thy comfort,    Had Loge not smiled on thee?        Or what hadst thou fashioned    Had not I heated thy forge?        I am thy kinsman        And once was kind:    Lukewarm, methinks, are thy thanks!    ALBERICH           On light-born elves         Laughs now Loge,         The crafty rogue:     Art thou, false one, their friend     As my friend thou wert once,         Haha! I laugh!     No harm from such need I fear.    LOGE          No cause then for thy distrust.    ALBERICH          I can trust thy falsehood,        Not thy good faith!            [_Taking up a defiant attitude._      Yet I dare you all unflinching.    LOGE          'Tis thy might        That makes thee so bold;        Grimly great        Groweth thy power.    ALBERICH          Seest thou the hoard        Yonder heaped        High by my host?    LOGE      A richer one never was seen.    ALBERICH          A wretched pile        Is this to-day, though.        Boldly mounting,    'Twill be bigger henceforward.    WOTAN      But what is gained by the hoard    In joyless Nibelheim,    Where wealth finds nothing to buy?    ALBERICH          Treasure to gather        And treasure to garner--    Thereto Nibelheim serves.        But with the hoard        In the caverns upheaped    Wonders all wonder surpassing        Will I perform    And win the whole world and its fairness.    WOTAN          But, my friend, how compass that goal?    ALBERICH      Ye who live above and breathe        The balmy, sweet airs,        Love and laugh:        A hand of gold    Ere long, O ye Gods, will have gripped you!    As I forswore love, even so        No one alive        But shall forswear it;        By golden songs wooed,    For gold alone will his greed be.        On hills of delight        Your home is, where gladness        Softly lulls;        The dark elves    Ye despise, O deathless carousers!        Beware!        Beware!        For first your men        Shall bow to my might;        Then your women fair        Who my wooing spurned    The dwarf will force to his will,    Though frowned on by love.            [_Laughing savagely._          Ha! ha! ha! ha!        Mark ye my word?        Beware!    Beware of the hosts of the night,    When rise shall the Nibelung hoard    From silent depths to the day!    WOTAN [_Furiously._          Avaunt, impious fool!    ALBERICH          What says he?    LOGE [_Stepping between them._          Cease from thy folly!            [_To Alberich._      Who would gaze not in wonder,    Beholding Alberich's work?    If only thy skill can achieve    Everything hope has promised,    Almighty I needs must acclaim thee!        For moon and stars        And the sun in his glory,    Forced to do thee obeisance,    Even they must bow down.    But what would seem of most moment        Is that they who serve thee,        The Nibelung hosts,    Bow and bear no hate.    When thy hand held forth a ring    Thy folk were stricken with fear.        But in thy sleep        A thief might slip up    And steal slyly the ring.    Say, how wouldst thou save thyself then?    ALBERICH      Most shrewd to himself seems Loge;        Others always        Figure as fools.        If I had to ask for        Advice or aid        On bitter terms,    How happy the thief would be!        This helmet that hides        I schemed for myself,        And chose for its smith    Mime, finest of forgers.        I am now able        Swift to assume        Any form that I fancy,        Through the helm.        No one sees me,        Search as he will;        Though everywhere hidden,        I always am there.        So, fearing nothing,    Even from thee I am safe,    Most kind, careful of friends!    LOGE          I have met        Full many a marvel,        But one so wondrous        Have never known.        Achievement so matchless        Scarce can I credit.    Were this possible, truly    Thy might indeed were eternal.    ALBERICH          Dost thou believe        I lie, as would Loge?    LOGE          Till it is proved    I must suspect thy word.    ALBERICH          Puffed up with wisdom,        The fool will explode soon:        Of envy then die!    Decide to what I shall change;    In that form I shall stand.    LOGE          Nay, choose for thyself,    But strike me dumb with amaze.    ALBERICH [_Puts the Tarnhelm on his head._          \"Dragon dread,        Wreathe thou and wriggle!\"            [_He immediately disappears. An enormous serpent          writhes on the floor in his place. It rears and          threatens Wotan and Loge with its open jaws._    LOGE [_Pretends to be terrified._          Ohé!    ALBERICH [_Laughing._      Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!    LOGE          Ohé! Ohé!        Horrible dragon,        O swallow me not!    Spare the life of poor Loge!    WOTAN          Good, Alberich!        Well done, rascal!        How swiftly grew    The dwarf to the dragon immense!            [_The dragon disappears and, in its stead, Alberich          is again seen in his own shape._    ALBERICH          He he! Ye scoffers,        Are ye convinced?    [Illustration: Plate 13         \"Ohé! Ohé!          Horrible dragon,          O swallow me not!      Spare the life of poor Loge!\"]    LOGE [_In a trembling voice._      My trembling tells thee how truly.        A giant snake        Thou wert in a trice.        Having beheld,    I just credit the wonder.        Couldest thou turn        To something quite tiny        As well as bigger?    Methinks that way were best    For slyly slipping from foes;    That, though, I fear were too hard!    ALBERICH          For thee, yes;        Thou art so dull!        How small shall I be?    LOGE      The most cramped of crannies must hold thee    That hides the timorous toad.    ALBERICH          Nothing simpler!        Look at me now!            [_He puts the Tarnhelm on his head again._          \"Crooked toad,        Creep and crawl there!\"            [_He vanishes. The Gods see a toad on the rocks          creeping towards them._    LOGE [_To Wotan._          Quick and catch it!        Capture the toad!            [_Wotan sets his foot on the toad. Loge makes a          dash at its head and holds the Tarnhelm in his          hand._    ALBERICH            [_Is suddenly seen in his own shape writhing under          Wotan's"]]]
