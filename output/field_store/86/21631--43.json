[New Series.], August 10, 1878 (#6)"],[1,"h,  like the other, was a capillary tube, carried a scale of divisions on  which might be read the temperature of the depths to which the  instrument had been lowered. This thermometer gave all the results that  might have been expected. The ship Challenger during its polar  expedition had on board a certain number of these instruments. The  report of Capt. G. S. Nares made to the English Admiralty describes all  the benefits that we may hope to reap from a serious study of the  temperature of the ocean at different depths, and not the least of these  are those that pertain to the fishery interest. Notwithstanding the good  results given by this instrument, its inventors have endeavored to  render it still more practical and more within the reach of all by  diminishing the cost of construction, and increasing its compactness.    [Illustration: Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Fig. 3 NEW THERMOMETER FOR OBTAINING THE  TEMPERATURE OF THE OCEAN AT GREAT DEPTHS.]    Fig. 1 represents the thermometer isolated from its case. It is an  ordinary thermometer furnished at A with a little device that M.  Negretti has already made use of in the construction of his larger  instrument, and which allows the liquid to run from the reservoir into  the capillary tube when the temperature rises, without letting it flow  back when it lowers, if moreover the precaution has been taken to  incline the tube slightly, reservoir upward. At B there is a bulge in  the tube in which a certain quantity of mercury may lodge; this bulge is  placed in such a way that the mercury resulting from the dilatation of  the reservoir may come to it and continue its ascension in the capillary  tube when the reservoir is down (the thermometer being vertical), but  cannot get out when the reservoir is upward.    We should add that these thermometers are constructed so as to give the  variations of temperature within determined limits.    The small reservoir, B, is indispensable to the well working of the  apparatus; for in seeking the temperature at a certain depth the  instrument may, on being drawn up, pass through warmer strata, and it is  necessary, therefore, to provide the reservoir with a means of diffusing  the small quantity of mercury resulting from this excess of temperature.  The tube has also a small bulge at its upper extremity at C.    The thermometer is placed in a small wooden case having a double bottom  throughout its length. In this double bottom are placed a certain number  of lead balls that can run from one end of the case to the other, and of  sufficient weight to render the instrument buoyant in sea water. To use  the apparatus, one end of a cord is passed through a hole in the case  under the reservoir of the thermometer, and the other end is tied to the  sounding line at a certain distance from the lead (Fig. 2). While the  line is descending the thermometer will remain reservoir downward (Fig.  2); but when it is again drawn up the thermometer case will take the  position indicated in Fig. 3, and the column of mercury breaking at A  will fall into the capillary tube, the divisions of which, as will be  seen at Fig. 1, are reversed.    As to the thermometer itself, it is important to protect it against the  pressure which becomes so considerable at great depths; to do this the  reservoir is surrounded by an envelope of thick glass about three  quarters full of mercury. The mercury serves to transmit the temperature  to the reservoir, and should the exterior envelope yield to the effects  of pressure, the reservoir proper would not be affected, the mercury not  exactly filling the annular part which surrounds it.           *       *       *       *       *                                     =New Inventions.=    George E. Palmer, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, has patented an improved  Ironing Board, on which the garments may be held in stretched state  while being smoothed with the irons, and readily adjusted thereon to any  required degree of tension by a simple attachment.    William B. Rutherford and Joel T. Hawkins, of Rockdale, Texas, have  patented an improved Bale Tie, which is formed of the plate provided  with a longitudinal groove and cross ribs or loops, and having  projections or keys to adapt it to receive and hold the notched ends of  the bale band.    An improvement in Composition Pavements has been patented by John C.  Russell, of Kensington, Eng. This invention relates to the treatment of  peat and spent tan for the manufacture of an improved product or  material suitable for paving roads and other places and for roofing,  etc. The most important steps in making the composition consist in  drying bruised or finely ground peat or spent tan, heating the same _in  vacuo_ to degree of 150 deg. Fah., and adding sulphur and gas tar, gas  pitch, and stearine pitch in the proportions specified, then kneading  the mixture while heated and adding carbonate of lime and furnace slag.    Louis Blanck, of New York city, has patented an improved Safety Brake or  attachment for locomotives and railroad cars, by which the entire train,  either by a collision with another train or by contact with any  obstruction, is first raised from the rails, and then moved in backward  direction for the distance of a few feet, so that all danger of accident  is avoided, and no other sensation than that of a slight rocking motion  exerted. The attachment is constructed so as to admit of being worked by  the engineer from the cab or the locomotive, or, if desired, from any  car of the train.    An improved Evaporating Pan had been patented by Andrew D. Martin, of  Abbeville, La. This invention consists in a tapering sheet metal tank  having transverse partitions and longitudinal tapering flues that extend  through all of the partitions and terminate at the ends of the tank.    Lloyd Arnold, of Galveston, Texas, has patented an improved Bale Tie,  which is formed of a block of iron, with a space or opening running  longitudinally through its breadth from one end nearly to the other, and  having the alternate edges of the two plates thus formed notched, the  notch of the lower plate being square and of a width equal to or a  little greater than the bale band, and the notch of the upper plate  being narrower at its bottom than the bale band, and with its sides  inclined and beveled to an edge, to adapt it to receive and hold the  bale band.    An improved Tie for Letter Packages has been patented by John Mersellis,  of Knowersville, N. Y. The object of this invention is to provide a tie  by means of which letter packages may be quickly and securely fastened  or tied. It consists in a plate apertured to receive one end of the  string and also to receive the hook upon which the tie is hung when not  in use, and having a button and clasp spring for engaging the string in  the process of tying.    Fred P. Hammond, of Aurora, Ill., has patented an improved Inking Pad,  which consists in a novel arrangement of layers of cloth or felt,  chamois skin, oiled silk, and printing roller composition, which enables  a clean impression of the stamp to be made. The pad retains the desired  rounded surface and proper degree of softness, and is easily manipulated  when necessary to replenish the supply of ink.    William J. Clark and Thomas W. Roberts, of Coffeeville, Miss., have  patented an improved Trap for Catching Fish in streams, which will allow  the fish to be conveniently taken out without taking up the trap.    John W. Cooper, of Salem, Ind., is the inventor of an improved Alcohol  Lamp for soldering and similar purposes; and it consists in a reservoir  pivoted in a supporting frame, and provided with two wick tubes, and an  extinguisher secured to a spring support, and capable of closing the  larger wick tube when it is in a vertical position. It has an  independent extinguisher for the smaller wick tube, and is provided with  a novel device for projecting the wick from the larger tube as it is  moved out of a vertical position.    Benjamin Slater, of Attica, N. Y., has invented a simple and effective  device for Renovating Feathers by the combined action of steam and hot  air. It consists of a cylindrical receptacle, partly surrounded by a  steam jacket, and having a hot air box, a perforated bottom, a cover or  damper for the same, and an aperture in the top, to which is fitted a  perforated cover and a close cover.    An improved Blind Fastening has been patented by George Runton and John  Runton, of Hoboken, N. J. This fastening is so constructed as to fasten  the blind or shutter automatically when swung open, and in such a way as  to prevent all rattling or shaking of the blind or shutter from the  action of the wind.    David R. Nichols, of Alexandria Bay, N. Y., has patented an improved  Animal Trap, which is so constructed as to set itself after each animal  has been caught, and leave no trace of the trapped animal to frighten  away those that may come afterward.    William A. Doherty, of Fall River, Mass., has patented an improved Loom  Shuttle Attachment, by which the weaving of bad cloth is prevented, and  in case any false shed is made by any irregularities in the warp, and  that part of the shed carried lower than usual, the attachment is  released and thrown over the spindle point, so as to render it  impossible to draw out the filling from the shuttle, and thus break it  and stop the loom.    Jonas Bowman, of Somerset, O., has patented an improved Vehicle Spring,  which permits of dispensing with side bars, thus taking less space to  turn on, and by which the tilting and pitching motion usual with springs  as heretofore constructed is avoided.    Hiram Unger, of Germantown, O., is the inventor of an improved Gate  Latch, which is so constructed that the gate cannot be opened  accidentally by being lifted or by rebounding of the catch or latch.    Madison Calhoun, of Ocate, Ter. of New Mex., has patented an improved  Hame Fastening, which is not liable to become "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43289"],[0,"Hänsel and Gretel: A Fairy Opera in Three Acts (#6)"],[1,"l!

Haensel sits near the door, making brooms, and Gretel opposite him by  the fireplace, knitting a stocking._)    GRETEL.        Susy, little Susy, pray what is the news?      The geese are running barefoot, because they've no shoes!      The cobbler has leather, and plenty to spare,      why can't he make the poor goose a new pair?    HAeNSEL.        Then they'll have to go barefoot!      Eia-popeia, pray what's to be done?      Who'll give me milk and sugar, for bread I have none?      I'll go back to bed and I'll lie there all day;      where there's nought to eat, then there's nothing to pay!    GRETEL.        Then we'll have to go hungry!    HAeNSEL.        If mother would only come home again!      Yes, I am so hungry,      I don't know what to do!      For weeks I've eaten nought but bread--      It's very hard, it is indeed!    GRETEL.        Hush, Haensel, don't forget what father said,      when mother, too, wished she were dead:      \"When past bearing is our grief,      Then 'tis Heaven will send relief!\"    HAeNSEL.        Yes, yes, that sounds all very fine,      but you know off maxims we cannot dine!      O Gret, it would be such a treat      if we had something nice to eat!      Eggs and butter and suet paste,      I've almost forgotten how they taste.    (_Nearly crying._)        O Gretel, I wish--    GRETEL.        Hush, don't give way to grumps;      have patience awhile, no doleful dumps!      This woful face, whew! what a sight!      Looks like a horrid old crosspatch fright!            Crosspatch, away!            Leave me, I pray!            Just let me reach you,            quickly I'll teach you            how to make trouble,            soon mount to double!            Crosspatch, crosspatch,            what is the use,            growling and grumbling,            full of abuse?            Off with you, out with you,            shame on you, goose!    HAeNSEL.              Crosspatch, away!            Hard lines, I say.        {HAeNSEL.      {      {    When I am hungry,      {    surely I can say so,      {    cannot allay so,      {    can't chase away so!      {      {GRETEL.      {      {    If I am hungry,      {    I'll never say so,      {    will not give way so,      {    chase it away so!    GRETEL.        That's right. Now, if you leave off complaining,      I'll tell you a most delightful secret!    HAeNSEL.        O delightful! it must be something nice!    GRETEL.        Well, listen, brotherkin--won't you be glad!      Look here in the jug, here is fresh milk,      'twas given to-day by our neighbour,      and mother, when she comes back home,      will certainly make us a rice-blancmange.    HAeNSEL    (_joyfully dances round the room_).        Rice-blancmange!      When blancmange is anywhere near,      then Haensel, Haensel, Haensel, is there!      How thick is the cream on the milk;      let's taste it! O Gemini!      wouldn't I like to drink it!    (_Tasting it._)    GRETEL.        What, Haensel, tasting? Aren't you ashamed?      Out with your fingers quick, greedy boy!    (_Gives him a rap on the fingers._)        Get back to your work again, be quick,      that we may both have done in time!      If mother comes and we haven't done right,      then badly it will fare with us to-night!    HAeNSEL.        Work again? No, not for me!      That's not my idea at all;      it doesn't suit me! It's such a bore!      Dancing is jollier far, I'm sure!    GRETEL (_delighted_).        Dancing, dancing! O yes, that's better far;      and sing a song to keep us in time!      One that our grandmother used to sing us:      sing then, and dance in time to the singing!    (_Claps her hands_.)        Brother, come and dance with me,      both my hands I offer thee;            right foot first,            left foot then,      round about and back again!    HAeNSEL (_tries to do it, but awkwardly_).        I would dance, but don't know how,      when to jump, and when to bow;      show me what I ought to do,      so that I may dance like you.    GRETEL.        With your foot you tap, tap, tap;      with your hands you clap, clap, clap;            right foot first,            left foot then,      round about and back again!    HAeNSEL.        With your hands you clap, clap, clap;      with your foot you tap, tap, tap;            right foot first,            left foot then,      round about and back again!    GRETEL.        That was very good indeed,      O, I'm sure you'll soon succeed!      Try again, and I can see      Haensel soon will dance like me!    (_Claps her hands._)        With your head you nick, nick, nick;      with your fingers you click, click, click;            right foot first,            left foot then,      round about and back again.    HAeNSEL.        With your head you nick, nick, nick;      with your fingers you click, click, click;            right foot first,            left foot then,      round about and back again!    GRETEL.        Brother, watch what next I do,      you must do it with me too.      You to me your arm must proffer,      I shall not refuse your offer!      Come!    BOTH.        What I enjoy is dance and jollity,      love to have my fling;      in fact, I like frivolity,      and all that kind of thing.    GRETEL.        Tralala, tralala, tralala!      Come and have a twirl, my dearest Haensel,      come and have a turn with me, I pray;      come here to me, come here to me,      I'm sure you can't say nay!    HAeNSEL (_gruffly_).        Go away from me, go away from me,      I'm much too proud for you:      with little girls I do not dance,      and so, my dear, adieu!    GRETEL.        Go, stupid Hans, conceited Hans,      you'll see I'll make you dance!      Tralala, tralala, tralala!      Come and have a twirl, my dearest Haensel,      come and have a turn with me, I pray!    HAeNSEL.        O Gretel dear, O sister dear,      your stocking has a hole!    GRETEL.        O Haensel dear, O"]]]
