In several object-glasses that I  have had made for trial, plano-convex, with their inner surfaces  cemented, their diameters the radius of the flint lens, and their  color pretty well corrected, those composed of dense flint and light  plate have had the rays from the longer focus emerging nearly  parallel; and this focus has been not quite three times the distance  of the shorter from the glass: with English flint the rays have had  more convergence, and the shorter focus has borne a rather less  proportion to the longer.    \"If the surfaces are not cemented, a striking effect is produced by  minute differences in their curves. It may give some idea of this,  that in a glass of which nearly the whole disk was covered with color  from contact of the lenses, the addition of a film of varnish, so thin  that this color was not destroyed by it, caused a sensible change in  the spherical correction.    \"I have found that whatever extended the longer aplanatic focus, and  increased the convergence of its rays, diminished the relative length  of the shorter. Thus by turning to the concave lens the flatter  instead of the deeper side of a convex lens, whose radii were to each  other as 31 to 35, the pencil of the longer aplanatic focus, from  being greatly divergent, was brought to converge at a very small  distance behind the glass; and the length of the shorter focus, which  had been one-half that of the longer, became but one-sixth of it.    \"The direction of the aplanatic pencils appears to be scarcely  affected by the differences in the thickness of glasses, if their  state as to color is the same.    \"One other property of the double object-glass remains to be  mentioned, which is, that when the longer aplanatic focus is used, the  marginal rays of a pencil not coincident with the axis of the glass  are distorted, so that a coma is thrown outwards; while the contrary  effect of a coma directed towards the centre of the field is produced  by the rays from the shorter focus. These peculiarities of the coma  seem inseparable attendants on the two foci, and are as conspicuous in  the achromatic meniscus as in the plano-convex object-glass.    [Illustration: Fig. 14.]    \"Of several purposes to which the particulars just given seem  applicable, I must at present confine myself to the most obvious one.  They furnish the means of destroying with the utmost ease both  aberrations in a large focal pencil, and of thus surmounting what has  hitherto been the chief obstacle to the perfection of the microscope.  And when it is considered that the curves of its diminutive  object-glasses have required to be at least as exactly proportioned as  those of a large telescope to give the image of a bright point equally  sharp and colorless, and that any change made to correct one  aberration was liable to disturb the other, some idea may be formed of  what the amount of that obstacle must have been. It will, however, be  evident that if any object-glass is but made achromatic, with its  lenses truly worked and cemented, so that their axes coincide, it may  with certainty be connected with another possessing the same  requisites and of suitable focus, so that the combination shall be  free from spherical error also in the centre of its field. For this  the rays have only to be received by the front glass B (Fig. 14) from  its shorter aplanatic focus F'', and transmitted in the direction of  the longer correct pencil F A of the other glass A. It is desirable  that the latter pencil should neither converge to a very short focus  nor be more than very slightly if at all divergent; and a little  attention at first to the kind of glass used will keep it within this  range, the denser flint being suited to the glasses of shorter focus  and larger angle of aperture.    \"The adjustment of the microscope is then perfected, if necessary, by  slightly varying the distance between the object-glasses; and after  that is done, the length of the tube which carries the eye-pieces may  be altered greatly without disturbing the correction, opposite errors  which balance each other being produced by the change.    \"If the two glasses which in the diagram are drawn at some distance  apart are brought nearer together (if the place of A, for instance, is  carried to the dotted figure), the rays transmitted by B in the  direction of the longer aplanatic pencil of A will plainly be derived  from some point Z more distant than F'', and lying between the  aplanatic foci of B; therefore (according to what has been stated)  this glass, and consequently the combination, will then be spherically  over-corrected. If, on the other hand, the distance between A and B is  increased, the opposite effects are of course produced.    \"In combining several glasses together it is often convenient to  transmit an under-corrected pencil from the front glass, and to  counteract its error by over-correction in the middle one.    \"Slight errors in color may in the same manner be destroyed by  opposite ones; and on the principles described we not only acquire  fine correction for the central ray, but by the opposite effects at  the two foci on the transverse pencil, all coma can be destroyed, and  the whole field rendered beautifully flat and distinct.\"    Mr. Lister's paper enters into further particulars, which are not  essential to the comprehension of the subject. It is sufficient to say  that his investigations and results proved to be of the highest value  to the practical optician, and the progress of improvement was in  consequence extremely rapid. The new principles were applied and  exhibited by Mr. Hugh Powell and Mr. Andrew Ross with a degree of  success which had never been anticipated; so perfect indeed were the  corrections given to the achromatic object-glass--so completely were  the errors of sphericity and dispersion balanced or destroyed--that  the circumstance of covering the object with a plate of the thinnest  glass or talc disturbed the corrections, if they had been adapted to  an uncovered object, and rendered an object-glass which was perfect  under one condition sensibly defective under the other.    This defect, if that should be called a defect which arose out of  improvement, was first discovered by Mr. Ross, who immediately  suggested the means of correcting it, and presented to the Society of  Arts, in 1837, a paper on the subject, which was published in the 51st  volume of their Transactions, and which, as it is, like Mr. Lister's  essential to a full understanding of the ultimate refinements of the  instrument, we shall extract nearly in full:    \"In the course of a practical investigation (says Mr. Ross) with the  view of constructing a combination of lenses for the object-glass of a  compound microscope, which should be free from the effects of  aberration, both for central and oblique pencils of great angle, I  combined the condition of the greatest possible distance between the  object and object-glass; for in object-glasses of short focal length  their closeness to the object has been an obstacle in many cases to  the use of high magnifying powers, and is a constant source of  inconvenience.    \"In the improved combination, the diameter is only sufficient to admit  the proper pencil; the convex lenses are wrought to an edge, and the  concave have only sufficient thickness to support their figure;  consequently the combination is the thinnest possible, and it follows  that there will be the greatest distance between the object and the  object-glass. The focal length is one-eighth of an inch, having an  angular aperture of 60 deg., with a distance of 1-25th of an inch, and a  magnifying power of 970 times linear, with perfect definition on the  most difficult Podura scales. I have made object-glasses 1-16th of an  inch focal length; but as the angular aperture cannot be  advantageously increased, if the greatest distance between the object  and object-glass is preserved, their use will be very limited.    \"The quality of the definition produced by an achromatic compound  microscope will depend upon the accuracy with which the aberrations,  both chromatic and spherical, are balanced, together with the general  perfection of the workmanship. Now, in Wollaston's doublets, and  Holland's triplets, there are no means of producing a balance of the  aberrations, as they are composed of convex lenses only; therefore the  best that can be done is to make the aberrations a minimum; the  remaining positive aberration in these forms produces its peculiar  effect upon objects (particularly the detail of the thin transparent  class), which may lead to misapprehension of their true structure; but  with the achromatic object-glass, where the aberrations are correctly  balanced, the most minute parts of an object are accurately displayed,  so that a satisfactory judgment of their character may be formed.    [Illustration: Fig. 15.]    [Illustration: Fig. 16.]    \"It will be seen by Fig. 15, that when a certain angular pencil A O A'  proceeds from the object O, and is incident on the plane side of the  first lens, if the combination is removed from the object, as in Fig.  16, the extreme rays of the pencil impinge on the more marginal parts  of the glass, and as the refractions are greater here, the aberrations  will be greater also. Now, if two compound object-glasses have their  aberrations balanced, one being situated as in Fig. 15, and the other  as in Fig. 16, and the same disturbing power applied to both, that in  which the angles of incidence and the aberrations are small will not  be so much disturbed as where the angles are great, and where  consequently the aberrations increase rapidly.    \"When an object-glass has its aberrations balanced for viewing an  opaque object, and it is required to examine that object by  transmitted light, the correction will remain; but if it is necessary  to immerse the object in a fluid, or to cover it with glass "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41990"],[0,"The Cid Campeador: A Historical Romance (#6)"],[1," good account of a squadron of Moors who were about  setting fire to the harvests in the country of the Christians.\"    Rodrigo still continued absorbed in his meditations, but Fernan was not  yet vanquished. He had just touched, without effect, one of the chords  which most easily vibrated in the heart of his master--that of war; he  now made up his mind to touch the other--that of love.    \"We shall spend much less time to-night in the journey from Leon to  Vivar, than when you, your father, and I journeyed from Vivar to Leon,  accompanying Do[~n]a Ximena.\"    Rodrigo started on hearing the name of his beloved; and Fernan, whom the  movement did not escape, said to himself--    \"It is certainly Ximena who has bewitched him with those eyes of hers,  which are bright as the morning star. May Mayorica tear out my eyes when  we arrive at Vivar, if it is not of that maiden he is thinking!\"    The good squire was not wrong; the enamoured youth was thinking of his  Ximena, was reflecting on the happiness which he had enjoyed when at her  side, and was considering what were the probabilities of its being  renewed, and of his securing her for himself.    \"How happy,\" he reflected, \"were the days which we passed near each  other, sometimes in my father's mansion at Vivar, sometimes in that of  her father at Gormaz! When we were children we believed that a tightly  tied knot bound us together, although we were ignorant of its nature; we  only knew that we loved each other and could not cease from loving each  other; we grew up, and with our growth our love increased, and then we  began to feel that we knew the names we should have to call each other  by on some future day. Who could have told us then that a day would  come, when the union which our dearest hopes and those of our parents  looked forward to, should become little less than impossible? We were at  a tournament once, and when a knight splintered the lances which he had  to break, in order to be proclaimed victor, Ximena said to me, 'Rodrigo,  when you bind on the sword of a knight, you will combat thus, you will  conquer thus; and thus shall you receive the prize,--then your glory  shall be mine!' And when the queen of the tournament, seated on a  throne, gilt and adorned with garlands of flowers, presented the prize  to the victor, who knelt at the feet of her whose beauty was extolled by  the noblest and bravest cavaliers, I said to my Ximena, 'Some day you  will be the queen of the tournament and I the victor, to whom you will  hand the prize; all will applaud you and admire your beauty, and your  glory will increase that which the victory shall bring to me.' At other  times, swift as the butterflies and joyous as the birds, running through  the gardens which surrounded the castle of your father or of mine, or  seated under the shade of the trees in the woods, casting flowers into  the stream which rushed by them in its rapid course, or standing  together on the ramparts of the castle, gazing on the clear azure of the  sky, and breathing the perfume of the fields which the fresh breezes of  the night bore towards us, we dreamt of a life of love, of glory, and of  almost heavenly happiness.\"    At this point of his reflections Rodrigo Diaz had arrived, when Fernan  interrupted him, pronouncing the name of Ximena. They spoke for some  moments of the day to which the squire referred; however, as the youth  did not consider it prudent to give him any explications regarding his  love affairs, and as he could not well talk of matters therewith  connected, without having to refer to them, he changed the conversation.  Finding that he had to talk of something, as he saw that the squire was  resolved not to remain silent, he reverted to the subject which he  thought would please him, and began to talk of the wars.    Fernan, who of the six-and-thirty years which he counted had passed  twenty on fields of battle, distracted the attention of his master  completely from his amorous meditations. He related to him many  wonderful events, which the chronicler, to whom we owe much of what we  are relating, considered, for the most part, pure fables, but which  Rodrigo evidently believed, becoming at times very enthusiastic, and  breaking out into such exclamations as--\"Ah! Moorish dogs!... By St.  James! that lance thrust was worth a king's treasure!... God's anger!  what a caitiff was that knight!--Oh that someone had been there to cut  off the wretch's head!\"--and others of a similar kind.    About this time morning began to dawn, and the birds to sing in the  trees which overhung the road. Our travellers arrived at an inn, called  the Sign of the Moor. Fernan advised his master to dismount there, with  a view to strengthening a little the stomachs of both riders and horses.  Rodrigo assented, as he considered that, if love had taken away his  appetite, the case was different with regard to his squire and the tired  beasts.    They were just dismounting when they heard a noise, as of horses, in a  dark grove which was opposite the inn, and almost at the same time they  heard a voice which called out to them--    \"To my rescue, cavaliers!\"    \"Halt, villains! for such ye are!\" cried Rodrigo, grasping his sword and  preparing to attack the strangers.    \"By the soul of Beelzebub!\" shouted Fernan, \"do not touch them; your  sword should not be used against this crew of bandits, for such they  must be, and moreover rustics from this neighbourhood. You shall see  what my lance can do with them.\"    Saying this, Fernan rushed on the men who were in the wood. His master  did not accompany him, as he felt that he should not use a knight's  sword, for the first time, in a fight with miserable highway  robbers--the sword with which he had been girt, only the day before, by  the King of Castile and Leon.    Whilst Fernan was fighting in the wood with those whom he considered  bandits, overthrowing each with a thrust of his strong lance, one of  them separated himself from his companions and rode rapidly to the inn.  When he reached it he dismounted hastily, gave a terrible blow to the  door, which caused it to fly into fragments, and entered, issuing forth,  an instant after, carrying another person, who appeared to be a woman.  He leaped on his horse with her, spurred it violently, and just then,  Rodrigo, who stood observing the scene, heard a voice which cried out--    \"For the sake of God, sir knight, save a maiden who has been torn away  from her parents by those miserable ruffians!\"    Rodrigo believed now that the occasion had arrived, when he could fulfil  one of the duties imposed on him by the oath he had sworn when he was  made a knight, which was to defend the weak and oppressed; and, placing  his hand on his sword, he closed with the abductor, who, in his turn,  drew his weapon, holding with his left hand both the bridle of his horse  and the young girl. The combat was fierce and obstinate; the  disadvantage caused to the unknown by having to hold his prey was  equalised by the caution which Rodrigo had to use, in order not to wound  her whom he was endeavouring to save; and, moreover, the leafy trees  dulled the early morning's light. The gallop of a horse was then heard,  which was coming in the direction of the combatants; the bandit turned  his head by an instinctive movement, doubtless to see if it were one of  his companions coming to his aid, and just at that moment the brave  youth thrust his sword through the neck-piece of his armour, causing him  to fall to the ground, pouring forth a stream of blood, and dragging  down with him the maiden, who had just fainted.    At that moment Fernan arrived, brandishing his heavy lance.    \"Well done, sir! well done, I swear!\" exclaimed the valiant squire, when  he saw that his master had triumphed over his adversary. \"You are worthy  of your father, and have given good handsel to your sword; for, as far  as I can see, those traitors were abductors of women. Be off to hell,  villain,\" he continued, turning towards the vanquished man; \"in the wood  two of your comrades lie biting the dust, and you will be able to make  the journey in love and good fellowship.\"    Thus speaking, both the knight and the squire dismounted, in order to  aid the girl. She was, to judge by her dress, a country maiden, and very  beautiful. They bore her to the inn, the owners of which were much  rejoiced to see her free from her persecutors; for, even though they  were not strong enough to succour her, they knew that she must have been  carried away by force. Thanks, now, to the cares lavished on her by the  innkeeper and his wife, the knight, and the squire, she regained  consciousness in a short time, and falling on her knees before the brave  youth who had rescued her, she warmly expressed her gratitude, shedding  tears all the time. They did their utmost to console her, and, as it did  not appear prudent to Rodrigo to leave her in the inn, exposed to the  danger of again falling into the hands of those of her abductors who had  escaped the lance of Fernan, he made up his mind to bring her to Vivar,  where she might recruit her health, which had been seriously impaired in  a few hours. The maiden willingly assented, and when the squire and the  horses had partaken of a hasty meal, they assisted her to mount on the  steed of the man who was lying there, apparently dead, and they all set  out on the road to Vivar, just as the sun was rising in the east, and  the labourers and muleteers, coming from all quarters, were lending life  and animation to the country, solitary till then, with their joyous  songs and friendly talks.
