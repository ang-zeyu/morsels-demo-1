The study of the strata of the earth and of many other  geological phenomena, they assure us, makes it certain that the earth  must have existed much in its present condition for hundreds of  millions of years. During all that time there can have been no great  diminution in the supply of heat radiated by the sun.    The astronomer, in considering this argument, has to admit that he  finds a similar difficulty in connection with the stars and nebulas. It  is an impossibility to regard these objects as new; they must be as old  as the universe itself. They radiate heat and light year after year. In  all probability, they must have been doing so for millions of years.  Whence comes the supply? The geologist may well claim that until the  astronomer explains this mystery in his own domain, he cannot declare  the conclusions of geology as to the age of the earth to be wholly  inadmissible.    Now, the scientific experiments of the last two years have brought this  mystery of the celestial spaces right down into our earthly  laboratories. M. and Madame Curie have discovered the singular metal  radium, which seems to send out light, heat, and other rays  incessantly, without, so far as has yet been determined, drawing the  required energy from any outward source. As we have already pointed  out, such an emanation must come from some storehouse of energy. Is the  storehouse, then, in the medium itself, or does the latter draw it from  surrounding objects? If it does, it must abstract heat from these  objects. This question has been settled by Professor Dewar, at the  Royal Institution, London, by placing the radium in a medium next to  the coldest that art has yet produced--liquid air. The latter is  surrounded by the only yet colder medium, liquid hydrogen, so that no  heat can reach it. Under these circumstances, the radium still gives  out heat, boiling away the liquid air until the latter has entirely  disappeared. Instead of the radiation diminishing with time, it rather  seems to increase.    Called on to explain all this, science can only say that a molecular  change must be going on in the radium, to correspond to the heat it  gives out. What that change may be is still a complete mystery. It is a  mystery which we find alike in those minute specimens of the rarest of  substances under our microscopes, in the sun, and in the vast nebulous  masses in the midst of which our whole solar system would be but a  speck. The unravelling of this mystery must be the great work of  science of the twentieth century. What results shall follow for mankind  one cannot say, any more than he could have said two hundred years ago  what modern science would bring forth. Perhaps, before future  developments, all the boasted achievements of the nineteenth century  may take the modest place which we now assign to the science of the  eighteenth century--that of the infant which is to grow into a man.          III    THE STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE      The questions of the extent of the universe in space and of its  duration in time, especially of its possible infinity in either space  or time, are of the highest interest both in philosophy and science.  The traditional philosophy had no means of attacking these questions  except considerations suggested by pure reason, analogy, and that  general fitness of things which was supposed to mark the order of  nature. With modern science the questions belong to the realm of fact,  and can be decided only by the results of observation and a study of  the laws to which these results may lead.    From the philosophic stand-point, a discussion of this subject which is  of such weight that in the history of thought it must be assigned a  place above all others, is that of Kant in his \"Kritik.\" Here we find  two opposing propositions--the thesis that the universe occupies only a  finite space and is of finite duration; the antithesis that it is  infinite both as regards extent in space and duration in time. Both of  these opposing propositions are shown to admit of demonstration with  equal force, not directly, but by the methods of reductio ad absurdum.  The difficulty, discussed by Kant, was more tersely expressed by  Hamilton in pointing out that we could neither conceive of infinite  space nor of space as bounded. The methods and conclusions of modern  astronomy are, however, in no way at variance with Kant's reasoning, so  far as it extends. The fact is that the problem with which the  philosopher of Konigsberg vainly grappled is one which our science  cannot solve any more than could his logic. We may hope to gain  complete information as to everything which lies within the range of  the telescope, and to trace to its beginning every process which we can  now see going on in space. But before questions of the absolute  beginning of things, or of the boundary beyond which nothing exists,  our means of inquiry are quite powerless.    Another example of the ancient method is found in the great work of  Copernicus. It is remarkable how completely the first expounder of the  system of the world was dominated by the philosophy of his time, which  he had inherited from his predecessors. This is seen not only in the  general course of thought through the opening chapters of his work, but  among his introductory propositions. The first of these is that the  universe--mundus--as well as the earth, is spherical in form. His  arguments for the sphericity of the earth, as derived from observation,  are little more than a repetition of those of Ptolemy, and therefore  not of special interest. His proposition that the universe is spherical  is, however, not based on observation, but on considerations of the  perfection of the spherical form, the general tendency of bodies--a  drop of water, for example--to assume this form, and the sphericity of  the sun and moon. The idea retained its place in his mind, although the  fundamental conception of his system did away with the idea of the  universe having any well-defined form.    The question as attacked by modern astronomy is this: we see scattered  through space in every direction many millions of stars of various  orders of brightness and at distances so great as to defy exact  measurement, except in the case of a few of the nearest. Has this  collection of stars any well-defined boundary, or is what we see merely  that part of an infinite mass which chances to lie within the range of  our telescopes? If we were transported to the most distant star of  which we have knowledge, should we there find ourselves still  surrounded by stars on all sides, or would the space beyond be void?  Granting that, in any or every direction, there is a limit to the  universe, and that the space beyond is therefore void, what is the form  of the whole system and the distance of its boundaries? Preliminary in  some sort to these questions are the more approachable ones: Of what  sort of matter is the universe formed? and into what sort of bodies is  this matter collected?    To the ancients the celestial sphere was a reality, instead of a mere  effect of perspective, as we regard it. The stars were set on its  surface, or at least at no great distance within its crystalline mass.  Outside of it imagination placed the empyrean. When and how these  conceptions vanished from the mind of man, it would be as hard to say  as when and how Santa Claus gets transformed in the mind of the child.  They are not treated as realities by any astronomical writer from  Ptolemy down; yet, the impressions and forms of thought to which they  gave rise are well marked in Copernicus and faintly evident in Kepler.  The latter was perhaps the first to suggest that the sun might be one  of the stars; yet, from defective knowledge of the relative brightness  of the latter, he was led to the conclusion that their distances from  each other were less than the distance which separated them from the  sun. The latter he supposed to stand in the centre of a vast vacant  region within the system of stars.    For us the great collection of millions of stars which are made known  to us by the telescope, together with all the invisible bodies which  may be contained within the limits of the system, form the universe.  Here the term \"universe\" is perhaps objectionable because there may be  other systems than the one with which we are acquainted. The term  stellar system is, therefore, a better one by which to designate the  collection of stars in question.    It is remarkable that the first known propounder of that theory of the  form and arrangement of the system which has been most generally  accepted seems to have been a writer otherwise unknown in  science--Thomas Wright, of Durham, England. He is said to have  published a book on the theory of the universe, about 1750. It does not  appear that this work was of a very scientific character, and it was,  perhaps, too much in the nature of a speculation to excite notice in  scientific circles. One of the curious features of the history is that  it was Kant who first cited Wright's theory, pointed out its accordance  with the appearance of the Milky Way, and showed its general  reasonableness. But, at the time in question, the work of the  philosopher of Konigsberg seems to have excited no more notice among  his scientific contemporaries than that of Wright.    Kant's fame as a speculative philosopher has so eclipsed his scientific  work that the latter has but recently been appraised at its true value.  He was the originator of views which, though defective in detail,  embodied a remarkable number of the results of recent research on the  structure and form of the universe, and the changes taking place in it.  The most curious illustration of the way in which he arrived at a  correct conclusion by defective reasoning is found in his anticipation  of the modern theory of a constant retardation of the velocity with  which the earth revolves on its axis.

Of course, we know hardly anything of these Indians  during the first two centuries of European settlement in America. Not  until the eighteenth century, when Russian traders began to frequent  the Pacific coast and the Spanish and English pushed their voyages into  the North Pacific,--the Tlingit of the far north, the Salish,  Tsimshian, Haida, Kwakiutl-Nootka and Kutenai. It is thought, however,  that nearly all the Pacific Indians belong to one kindred stock. There  are, it is true, many distinct languages between California and Alaska,  but the physical appearance and characteristics of the natives show a  similarity throughout.    The total number of the original Indian population of the continent can  be a matter of conjecture only. There is every reason, however, to  think that it was far less than the absurdly exaggerated figures given  by early European writers. Whenever the first explorers found a  considerable body of savages they concluded that the people they saw  were only a fraction of some large nation. The result was that the  Spaniards estimated the inhabitants of Peru at thirty millions. Las  Casas, the Spanish historian, said that Hispaniola, the present Hayti,  had a population of three millions; a more exact estimate, made about  twenty years after the discovery of the island, brought the population  down to fourteen thousand! In the same way Montezuma was said to have  commanded three million Mexican warriors--an obvious absurdity. The  early Jesuits reckoned the numbers of the Iroquois at about a hundred  thousand; in reality there seem to have been, in the days of Wolfe and  Montcalm, about twelve thousand. At the opening of the twentieth  century there were in America north of Mexico about 403,000 Indians, of  whom 108,000 were in Canada. Some writers go so far as to say that the  numbers of the natives were probably never much greater than they are  to-day. But even if we accept the more general opinion that the Indian  population has declined, there is no evidence to show that the  population was ever more than a thin scattering of wanderers over the  face of a vast country. Mooney estimates that at the coming of the  white man there were only about 846,000 aborigines in the United  States, 220,000 in British America, 72,000 in Alaska, and 10,000 in  Greenland, a total native population of 1,148,000 from the Mississippi  to the Atlantic.    The limited means of support possessed by the natives, their primitive  agriculture, their habitual disinclination to settled life and  industry, their constant wars and the epidemic diseases which, even as  early as the time of Jacques Cartier, worked havoc among them, must  always have prevented the growth of a numerous population. The explorer  might wander for days in the depths of the American forest without  encountering any trace of human life. The continent was, in truth, one  vast silence, broken only by the roar of the waterfall or the cry of  the beasts and birds of the forest.        CHAPTER IV    THE LEGEND OF THE NORSEMEN    There are many stories of the coming of white men to the coasts of  America and of their settlements in America long before the voyage of  Christopher Columbus. Even in the time of the Greeks and Romans there  were traditions and legends of sailors who had gone out into the 'Sea  of Darkness' beyond the Pillars of Hercules--the ancient name for the  Strait of Gibraltar--and far to the west had found inhabited lands.  Aristotle thought that there must be land out beyond the Atlantic, and  Plato tells us that once upon a time a vast island lay off the coasts  of Africa; he calls it Atlantis, and it was, he says, sunk below the  sea by an earthquake. The Phoenicians were wonderful sailors; their  ships had gone out of the Mediterranean into the other sea, and had  reached the British Isles, and in all probability they sailed as far  west as the Canaries. We find, indeed, in classical literature many  references to supposed islands and countries out beyond the Atlantic.  The ancients called these places the Islands of the Blessed and the  Fortunate Isles. It is, perhaps, not unnatural that in the earlier  writers the existence of these remote and mysterious regions should be  linked with the ideas of the Elysian Fields and of the abodes of the  dead. But the later writers, such as Pliny, and Strabo, the geographer,  talked of them as actual places, and tried to estimate how many Roman  miles they must be distant from the coast of Spain.    There were similar legends among the Irish, legends preserved in  written form at least five hundred years before Columbus. They recount  wonderful voyages out into the Atlantic and the discovery of new land.  But all these tales are mixed up with obvious fable, with accounts of  places where there was never any illness or infirmity, and people lived  for ever, and drank delicious wine and laughed all day, and we cannot  certify to an atom of historic truth in them.    Still more interesting, if only for curiosity's sake, are weird stories  that have been unearthed among the early records of the Chinese. These  are older than the Irish legends, and date back to about the sixth  century. According to the Chinese story, a certain Hoei-Sin sailed out  into the Pacific until he was four thousand miles east of Japan. There  he found a new continent, which the Chinese records called Fusang,  because of a certain tree--the fusang tree,--out of the fibres of which  the inhabitants made, not only clothes, but paper, and even food. Here  was truly a land of wonders. There were strange animals with branching  horns on their heads, there were men who could not speak Chinese but  barked like dogs, and other men with bodies painted in strange colours.  Some people have endeavoured to prove by these legends that the Chinese  must have landed in British Columbia, or have seen moose or reindeer,  since extinct, in the country far to the north. But the whole account  is so mixed up with the miraculous, and with descriptions of things  which certainly never existed on the Pacific coast of America, that we  can place no reliance whatever upon it.    The only importance that we can attach to such traditions of the  discovery of unknown lands and peoples on a new continent is their  bearing as a whole, their accumulated effect, on the likelihood of such  discovery before the time of Columbus. They at least make us ready to  attach due weight to the circumstantial and credible records of the  voyages of the Norsemen. These stand upon ground altogether different  from that of the dim and confused traditions of the classical writers  and of the Irish and Chinese legends. In fact, many scholars are now  convinced that the eastern coast of Canada was known and visited by the  Norsemen five hundred years before Columbus.    From time immemorial the Norsemen were among the most daring and  skilful mariners ever known. They built great wooden boats with tall,  sweeping bows and sterns. These ships, though open and without decks,  were yet stout and seaworthy. Their remains have been found, at times  lying deeply buried under the sand and preserved almost intact. One  such vessel, discovered on the shore of Denmark, measured 72 feet in  length. Another Viking ship, which was dug up in Norway, and which is  preserved in the museum at Christiania, was 78 feet long and 17 feet  wide. One of the old Norse sagas, or stories, tells how King Olaf  Tryggvesson built a ship, the keel of which, as it lay on the grass,  was 74 ells long; in modern measure, it would be a vessel of about 942  tons burden. Even if we make allowance for the exaggeration or  ignorance of the writer of the saga, there is still a vast contrast  between this vessel and the little ship Centurion in which Anson sailed  round the world.    It is needless, however, to prove that the Norsemen could have reached  America in their ships. The voyages from Iceland to Greenland which we  know they made continually for four hundred years were just as arduous  as a further voyage from Greenland to the coast of Canada.    The story of the Norsemen runs thus. Towards the end of the ninth  century, or nearly two hundred years before the Norman conquest, there  was a great exodus or outswarming of the Norsemen from their original  home in Norway. A certain King Harold had succeeded in making himself  supreme in Norway, and great numbers of the lesser chiefs or jarls  preferred to seek new homes across the seas rather than submit to his  rule. So they embarked with their seafaring followers--Vikings, as we  still call them--often, indeed, with their wives and families, in great  open ships, and sailed away, some to the coast of England, others to  France, and others even to the Mediterranean, where they took service  under the Byzantine emperors. But still others, loving the cold rough  seas of the north, struck westward across the North Sea and beyond the  coasts of Scotland till they reached Iceland. This was in the year 874.  Here they made a settlement that presently grew to a population of  fifty thousand people, having flocks and herds, solid houses of stone,  and a fine trade in fish and oil with the countries of Northern Europe.  These settlers in Iceland attained to a high standard of civilization.  They had many books, and were fond of tales and stories, as are all  these northern peoples who spend long winter evenings round the  fireside. Some of the sagas, or stories, which they told were true  accounts of the voyages and adventures of their forefathers; others  were fanciful stories, like our modern romances, created by the  imagination; others, again, were a mixture of the two. Thus it is  sometimes hard to distinguish fact and fancy in these early tales of  the Norsemen. We have, however, means of testing the stories. Among the  books written in Iceland there was one called"]]]
