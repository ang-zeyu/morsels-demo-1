As soon as  the lion managed to get him clear of the tent, he sprang at his throat  and after a few vicious shakes the poor bhisti's agonising cries were  silenced for ever. The brute then seized him in his mouth, like a huge  cat with a mouse, and ran up and down the boma looking for a weak spot  to break through. This he presently found and plunged into, dragging  his victim with him and leaving shreds of torn cloth and flesh as  ghastly evidences of his passage through the thorns. Dr. Brock and I  were easily able to follow his track, and soon found the remains about  four hundred yards away in the bush. There was the usual horrible  sight. Very little was left of the unfortunate bhisti--only the skull,  the jaws, a few of the larger bones and a portion of the palm with one  or two fingers attached. On one of these was a silver ring, and this,  with the teeth (a relic much prized by certain castes), was sent to the  man's widow in India.    Again it was decided to move the hospital; and again, before nightfall,  the work was completed, including a still stronger and thicker boma.  When the patients had been moved, I had a covered goods-wagon placed in  a favourable position on a siding which ran close to the site which had  just been abandoned, and in this Brock and I arranged to sit up that  night. We left a couple of tents still standing within the enclosure,  and also tied up a few cattle in it as bait for the lions, who had been  seen in no less than three different places in the neighbourhood during  the afternoon (April 23). Four miles from Tsavo they had attempted to  seize a coolie who was walking along the line. Fortunately, however, he  had just time to escape up a tree, where he remained, more dead than  alive, until he was rescued by the Traffic Manager, who caught sight of  him from a passing train. They next appeared close to Tsavo Station,  and a couple of hours later some workmen saw one of the lions stalking  Dr. Brock as he was returning about dusk from the hospital.    In accordance with our plan, the doctor and I set out after dinner for  the goods-wagon, which was about a mile away from our hut. In the light  of subsequent events, we did a very foolish thing in taking up our  position so late; nevertheless, we reached our destination in safety,  and settled down to our watch about ten o'clock. We had the lower half  of the door of the wagon closed, while the upper half was left wide  open for observation: and we faced, of course, in the direction of the  abandoned boma, which, however, we were unable to see in the inky  darkness. For an hour or two everything was quiet, and the deadly  silence was becoming very monotonous and oppressive, when suddenly, to  our right, a dry twig snapped, and we knew that an animal of some sort  was about. Soon afterwards we heard a dull thud, as if some heavy body  had jumped over the boma. The cattle, too, became very uneasy, and we  could hear them moving about restlessly. Then again came dead silence.  At this juncture I proposed to my companion that I should get out of  the wagon and lie on the ground close to it, as I could see better in  that position should the lion come in our direction with his prey.  Brock, however, persuaded me to remain where I was; and a few seconds  afterwards I was heartily glad that I had taken his advice, for at that  very moment one of the man-eaters--although we did not know it--was  quietly stalking us, and was even then almost within springing  distance. Orders had been given for the entrance to the boma to be  blocked up, and accordingly we were listening in the expectation of  hearing the lion force his way out through the bushes with his prey. As  a matter of fact, however, the doorway had not been properly closed,  and while we were wondering what the lion could be doing inside the  boma for so long, he was outside all the time, silently reconnoitring  our position.    Presently I fancied I saw something coming very stealthily towards us.  I feared, however, to trust to my eyes, which by that time were  strained by prolonged staring through the darkness, so under my breath  I asked Brock whether he saw anything, at the same time covering the  dark object as well as I could with my rifle. Brock did not answer; he  told me afterwards that he, too, thought he had seen something move,  but was afraid to say so lest I should fire and it turn out to be  nothing after all. After this there was intense silence again for a  second or two, then with a sudden bound a huge body sprang at us. \"The  lion!\" I shouted, and we both fired almost simultaneously--not a moment  too soon, for in another second the brute would assuredly have landed  inside the wagon. As it was, he must have swerved off in his spring,  probably blinded by the flash and frightened by the noise of the double  report which was increased a hundredfold by the reverberation of the  hollow iron roof of the truck. Had we not been very much on the alert,  he would undoubtedly have got one of us, and we realised that we had  had a very lucky and very narrow escape. The next morning we found  Brock's bullet embedded in the sand close to a footprint; it could not  have missed the lion by more than an inch or two. Mine was nowhere to  be found.    Thus ended my first direct encounter with one of the man-eaters.          CHAPTER IV    THE BUILDING OF THE TSAVO BRIDGE      During all this troublesome period the construction of the railway had  been going steadily forward, and the first important piece of work  which I had commenced on arrival was completed. This was the widening  of a rock cutting through which the railway ran just before it, reached  the river. In the hurry of pushing on the laying of the line, just  enough of the rock had originally been cut away to allow room for an  engine to pass, and consequently any material which happened to,  project outside the wagons or trucks caught on the jagged faces of the  cutting. I myself saw the door of a guard's van, which had been left  ajar, smashed to atoms in this way; and accordingly I put a gang of  rock-drillers to work at once and soon had ample room made for all  traffic to pass unimpeded. While this was going on, another gang of men  were laying the foundations of a girder bridge which was to span a  gully between this cutting and Tsavo Station. This would have taken too  long to erect when railhead was at the place, so a diversion had been  made round it, the temporary track leading down almost to the bed of  the nullah and up again on the further side. When the foundations and  abutments were ready, the gully was spanned by an iron girder, the  slopes leading up to it banked up on either side, and the permanent way  laid on an easy grade.    Then, also, a water supply had to be established; and this meant some  very pleasant work for me in taking levels up the banks of the river  under the cool shade of the palms. While doing this, I often took my  camp-kit with me, and a luncheon served in the wilds, with occasionally  a friend to share it--when a friend was available--was delightful. On  one occasion in particular, I went a long way up the river and was  accompanied by a young member of my staff. The day had been exceedingly  hot and we were both correspondingly tired when our work was finished,  so my companion suggested that we should build a raft and float  down-stream home. I was rather doubtful, of the feasibility of the  scheme, but nevertheless he decided to give it a trial. Setting to work  with our axes, we soon had a raft built, lashing the poles together  with the fibre which grows in abundance all over the district. When it  was finished, we pushed it out of the little backwater where it had  been constructed, and the young engineer jumped aboard. All went well  until it got out into midstream, when much to my amusement it promptly  toppled gracefully over. I helped my friend to scramble quickly up the  bank out of reach of possible crocodiles, when, none the worse for his  ducking, he laughed as heartily as I at the adventure.    Except for an occasional relaxation of this sort, every moment of my  time was fully occupied. Superintending the various works and a hundred  other duties kept me busy all day long, while my evenings were given up  to settling disputes among the coolies, hearing reports and complaints  from the various jemadars and workpeople, and in studying the Swahili  language. Preparations, too, for the principal piece of work in the  district--the building of the railway bridge over the Tsavo river--were  going on apace. These involved, much personal work on my part; cross  and oblique sections of the river had to be taken, the rate of the  current and the volume of water at flood, mean, and low levels had to  be found, and all the necessary calculations made. These having at  length been completed, I marked out the positions for the abutments and  piers, and the work of sinking their foundations was begun. The two  centre piers in particular caused a great deal of trouble, as the river  broke in several times, and had to be dammed up and pumped dry again  before work could be resumed. Then we found we had to sink much deeper  than we expected in order to reach a solid foundation indeed, the  sinking went on and on, until I began to despair of finding one and was  about to resort to pile-driving, when at last, to my relief, we struck  solid rock on which the huge foundation-stones could be laid with  perfect safety.    Another great difficulty with which we had to contend was the absence  of suitable stone in the neighbourhood. It was not that there was none  to be found, for the whole district abounds in rock, but that it was so  intensely hard as to be almost impossible to work, and a bridge built  of it would have been very costly.

Pl. V. Fig. 5, _e_, exhibits those points in a hair considerably  magnified.    These projections, or serrations, which vary in number in different  specimens of wool, are what it depends on for its felting properties.  They are sharper and more numerous in felting wools than in others,  and the better the felting properties of the wool, the more numerous  the curls; because what induces curling on the animal's back leads  to felting in the hands of the manufacturer. In felting, these  projections catch one upon another, and occasion the hair to move in  one direction, which is invariably root foremost, as we perceive on  giving it a twirling motion between the finger and thumb; and it is  only by the union of curve and serration, that felting can be  accomplished certainly and perfectly.    Woolly fibre consists of a semitransparent stem, or stalk, supposed  to be hollow, as represented at Fig. 4, Pl. V. and is partly  distinguished from hair by the latter being opaque. Next to soundness,  there are few qualities deserving of so much attention as softness,  of which the ancient writers make frequent mention, and for the  prevalence of which in our present wools fashion has done not a  little. It is a quality that tends, in a material degree, to the cheap  and easy working of the cloth, and, as such, is said to render wool 25  per cent. more valuable to the manufacturer than a harsh and brittle  pile. It apparently depends on the fineness of the fibre, which should  not, however, go the length of weakness. Fineness is in turn mainly  connected with the yolk, the secretion of which ought, on that  account, to be promoted by attention to the general management of the  animal, as it is well known to undergo a change of properties by  starvation, exposure, or any neglect whatever.    (32.) _Particular soils injurious to Wool._--Soil, also, has much  influence on the pliability of wool. Chalky lands, which are so  notorious for injuring the fleece, are supposed to act in the manner  of a corrosive, but the correct explanation is, not that the chalky  particles attack the fibre in a direct way, but that they render it  brittle, by absorbing the oily moisture with which it is naturally  imbued. Moreover, the plants growing in such situations cannot but be  injurious to sheep, owing to their impregnation, though a slight one,  with calcareous matter; for grooms know well how soon a horse's coat  becomes disordered by the frequent use of hard or well water, and  prefer, therefore, the river for their steeds.[4]            [4] I am surprized to find it asserted at page 76 of the book          on Sheep, published by the Society for the diffusion of Useful          Knowledge, that the depilatory action of lime-water on raw          hides is a \"_striking elucidation_\" of the injurious effects          of chalk on wool. Lime removes hair from a skin because it is          a powerful caustic, and, as such, speedily decomposes the          animal matter, but the carbonate of lime (chalk) is perfectly          innocuous to wool, except so far as it combines with its oil;          and is as little _corrosive_ to the fleece, as pipe-clay to a          soldier's coat.    (33.) _Felting._--The felting of wool may be defined as a property  depending on the curls and serrations of the fibre, by which it is  allowed to move only with the root foremost, and by which it is  enabled to catch and retain a hold on fibres that are near it, so as  to form a web or cloth. Felting is best brought into operation by  alternate pressure and relaxation, which may be produced in a variety  of ways: the ancient method, and one still pursued by the Tartars, was  to tramp on a mass or layer of moist unwrought wool, so as to form a  coarse cloth or carpet; while the modern, and more perfect plan is,  either, as in hat making, to apply pressure with the hands, or, as in  the finishing of cloth, to pass the fabric repeatedly through rollers.  The way in which a close fabric is formed, by the juxta-position of a  few scattered hairs, gave rise for long, as well it might, to serious  disputations among philosophers; and the favourite theories of each,  unbased as they were on observation, might till now have agitated the  scientific portion of our manufacturers, had not the microscope  brought to light much of what is true and valuable in our researches.    Moisture appears to be of service during the felting of wool, as it  induces it to curl, enabling the fibres to expand, and catch one on  another, after they have been bent and compressed, by the force  applied to them, and is of itself sufficient to felt a fabric, as we  frequently perceive in the instance of stockings, which have been  allowed to remain too long in water, when they become short from  undergoing contraction, and resemble after such treatment an imperfect  cloth. It is for this reason that the hatter, after tumbling over, in  all directions, the fur of which the hat is to be made, wets it before  applying pressure; and, that the woollen manufacturer, after freeing  the web from grease, soaps it before its subjection to the action of  the rollers.    Without felting, cloth would resemble a net, and would unravel on  being cut, from the fibres crossing only in two directions; but the  strokes of the mill put an end to this, by laying the fibres in every  possible direction, and so twining them one with another, as to render  them a coherent mass.    (34.) _Different kinds of Wool._--The wool of this country is divided  into two great classes--long and short: the former varies in length  from three to eight inches, and before being made into stuffs and  worsted goods, requires to be deprived of its felting tendencies, by  passing it through heated iron combs, which remove the feathery parts,  or serrations, and make it resemble silk or cotton.    The shorter combing wools are in general used for hose, and are softer  than the long combing wools. Short wool is employed in the cloth  manufacture, and is, on that account, frequently called clothing wool.  It should approach in colour as much as possible to white, as a clear  white ground is required for all cloths that are to be dyed bright  colours, as well as for those dressed white: grey or black hairs  injure the fleece very much, even though few and minute, as they give  rise to reddish spots where the cloth is stoved. Herefordshire sheep  are entirely free from this defect, and are, therefore, reckoned  particularly valuable for clothing purposes.    (35.) _Alterations induced by Crossing._--The breed exercises  considerable influence on the wool, some sheep, as the merinos, being  distinguished for the softness and beauty of the fleece; while others,  as some of our small northern varieties, are famed for the very  opposite characteristics.    According to the opinion on the continent, any race of ewes, however  coarse and long in the fleece, will, on the fourth cross of the merino  ram, give progeny with short wool equal to the Spanish. The truth of  this proposition is however doubted, in a communication to the Board  of Agriculture, by Dr Parry of Bath; but it is certain, he adds, that  one cross more will in most cases effect the desired purpose. \"If we  suppose,\" he says, \"the result of the admixture of the blood of the  merino ram to be always in an exact arithmetical proportion, and state  the native blood in the ewe as 64, then the first cross would give  32/64 of the merino, the second 48/64, the third 56/64, the fourth  60/64, the fifth 62/64, and so on. In other words, the first cross  would leave 32 parts in 64, or half of the English quality; the second  16 parts, or one-fourth; the third 8 parts, or one-eighth; the fourth  four parts, or one-sixteenth; the fifth 2 parts or one-thirty-second;  the sixth 1 part, or one-sixty-fourth; and so on. Now, if the filament  of the Wiltshire, or any other coarse wool, be in diameter double that  of the Ryeland, it is obvious that, according to the above statement,  it would require exactly one cross more to bring the hybrid wool of  the former to the same fineness as that of the latter. This, I  believe, very exactly corresponds with the fact. The difference  between one-eighth and one-sixteenth is very considerable, and must  certainly be easily perceived, both by a good microscope, and in the  cloth which is manufactured from such wool. In the latter method, it  certainly has been perceived; but I have had hitherto no opportunity  of trying the difference by the former. The fifth cross, as I have  before observed, brings the merino-Wilts wool to the same standard as  the merino-Ryeland.\"    (36.) _Bratting injurious to Wool._--Wool rendered fine by clothing  sheep, is never equal to that which owes its perfection to natural  causes. The Saxon wool, which is principally produced by _artificial_  means, has been compared, from its inelastic sickly appearance, to  grass that has been secluded from the sun. The custom of _bratting_ is  therefore not to be recommended, and indeed is now nearly laid aside.  Housing sheep with the same intentions is also bad, inasmuch as it  must affect their health, and destroy the curl of the fibre. Shelter  is however absolutely necessary from extremes both of heat and cold,  as temperature has much influence on the covering of animals, and in  none more than the sheep.          CHAPTER III.
