He isn't at  all what you consider a miser must be and look like; yet he is always  hoarding money and never spends any. But indeed I do not tell you this  to trouble you, Ruthie. I want you to believe, my dear, that if you  can't stand it at Mr. Potter's you can stand it at Mr. Cameron's--and  you'll be welcome there.    \"Our mother is dead. We talk of her a good deal, just as though she  were living and had gone on a little journey somewhere, and we should  see her again soon. God took her when Tom and I were only a few weeks  old; but Daddy has made himself our playfellow and dear, dear friend;  and there has always been Nurse Babette and Mrs. Murchiston--at  least, Mrs. Murchiston has been with us since we can remember. But  what Daddy says is law, and he said this morning that he'd like to  have a girl like you come to our house to be company for me. It gets  lonely for me sometimes, you see, for Tom doesn't want to play with  girls much, now he is so big. Perhaps next fall I'll go away to  boarding school--won't that be fun?\"    \"It will be fun for you, I hope, Helen,\" said Ruth, with rather a  wistful smile. \"I don't know where I shall go to school.\"    \"There is your uncle now!\" exclaimed Miss Cameron. \"See that man in  the old dusty suit?\"    Ruth had already seen the tall, stoop-shouldered figure, who looked as  though he had been powdered with flour, coming down the short path  from one of the open doors of the mill to the road, where a little,  one horse wagon stood. He bore a bag of meal or flour on his shoulder  which he pitched into the wagon. The man on the seat was speaking as  the automobile came to a stop immediately behind the wagon.    \"Jefers pelters! Ef there's one thing yeou know how to do, it's to  take toll, Jabe. Let the flour be poor, or good, there's little enough  of it comes back to the man that raises the wheat.\"    \"You don't have to bring your wheat here, Jasper Parloe,\" said the  miller, in a strong, harsh voice. \"There is no law compels ye.\"    \"Yah!\" snarled old Parloe. \"We all know ye, Jabe Potter. We know what  ye be.\" Potter turned away. He had not noticed the two girls in the  automobile. But now Jasper Parloe saw them. \"Ho!\" he cried, \"here's  somebody else that will l'arn ter know ye, too. Didn't know you was  ter hev comp'ny; did ye, Jabe? Here's yer niece, Jabe, come ter live  on ye an' be an expense to ye,\" and so, chuckling and screwing up his  mean, sly face, Parloe drove on, leaving the miller standing with arms  akimbo, and staring at Ruth, who was slowly alighting from the  automobile with her bag.    Helen squeezed her hand tightly as she got out \"Don't forget that we  are your friends, Ruthie,\" she whispered. \"I'm coming by again this  afternoon when I drive over to the station for father. If--if  anything happens you be out here--now remember!\"    What could possibly happen to her, Ruth could not imagine. She was not  really afraid of Uncle Jabez. She walked directly to him, as he stood  there, staring gloomily, in front of the Red Mill. He was not only  tall and stoop-shouldered, and very dusty; but his dusty eyebrows  almost met over his light blue eyes. He was lantern-jawed, and it did  seem as though his dry, shaven lips had never in all his life wrinkled  into a smile. His throat was wrinkled and scraggy and his head was  plainly very bald on top, for the miller's cap he wore did not  entirely cover the bald spot.    \"I am Ruth Fielding, from Darrowtown,\" she said, in a voice that she  controlled well. \"I have come to--to live with you, Uncle Jabez.\"    \"Where was you last night?\" demanded the miller, without so much as  returning her greeting. \"Was you with them Camerons?\"    \"I stayed all night with the station master,\" she said, in  explanation.    \"What time did you get to the station?\"    Ruth told him. Never once did his voice change or his grim look relax.    \"I mistook the time of the train,\" he said, without expressing any  sorrow.    \"I--I hope you will be glad to have me come,\" the said. \"Miss True--\"    \"You mean that old maid that wrote to me?\" he asked, harshly.    \"Miss True Pettis. She said she thought you would like to have me here  as we were so near related.\"    \"Not so near related as some,\" was all he said in reply to this. After  a moment, he added: \"You can go along to the house yonder. Aunt Alviry  will show you what to do.\"    Ruth could not have said another word just then without breaking down  and weeping, so she only nodded and turned to walk up a path toward  the house door.    \"One thing,\" urged the old man, before she had gone far. She turned to  look at him and he continued: \"One thing I want you to understand, if  you live here you have got to work. I don't like no laggards around  me.\"    She could only nod again, for her heart seemed to be right in her  throat, and the sting of the tears she wanted to shed, but could not,  almost blinded her as she went on slowly to the house door.      CHAPTER VII     AUNT ALVIRAH'S BACK AND BONES    Ruth came to the kitchen door and found that the lower half was  closed; but she could see over the upper panel that had been flung  wide to let in the sweet Spring air and sunlight. A little old woman  was stooping to brush the rag carpet with a whisk broom and dustpan,  and as she hobbled around the big stove and around the table, which  was already set neatly for dinner, she was crooning to herself:    \"Oh, my back and oh, my bones! Oh, my back and oh, my bones!\"    She was a very neat-looking old lady, with a kerchief crossed on her  breast in the style of the old-fashioned Quakeresses. She was not much  taller than Ruth herself, for when she stood upright--or as upright  as she could stand--her eyes were just about on a level with Ruth's  eyes looking in over the half door.    But the face of the old lady seemed, to the lonely, tear-filled girl,  almost the gentlest, sweetest face she had ever seen, as it slowly  smiled upon her. Aunt Alviry's welcome was like the daybreak.    \"Bless us and save us!\" ejaculated she, rising upright by degrees with  her hand upon the back she had been apostrophizing. \"If here isn't a  pretty little creeter come to see her Aunt Alviry. How-de-do, girl?\"    Ruth had set down her bag. Now she opened the door and stepped in. The  smile of the old lady broke down every bit of fortitude the girl had  left and she walked directly into Aunt Alviry's arms and burst into  tears.    \"There! there! Deary, deary me!\" murmured the little old lady, patting  her shoulder. \"Somebody has been treating you badly, I know. And  you've come right to your Aunt Alviry for comfort. And you've come to  the right place, my pretty girl, for I've got tons of comfort for ye.\"    She found a chair and lowered herself into it, not without the formula  which Ruth had heard before, of \"Oh, my back and oh, my bones!\" Ruth  dropped on her knees before her, hid her face in the old lady's lap,  and had her cry out. Meanwhile Aunt Alvirah seemed to have taken in  several things about her guest that were significant. She touched the  stuff of which Ruth's gown was made, and nodded; even the black  hair-ribbon did not go unnoticed.    \"Now,\" said Ruth, rising after a few moments, \"I guess that's all of  that foolishness. I--I don't usually cry, Aunt Alvirah.\"    \"Pshaw, now! I could tell that,\" said the old lady, comfortably.    \"I am going right to work to help you,\" said the girl. \"I can stoop  better than you can.\"    \"I expect you can, you pretty creeter,\" admitted the old lady.    Ruth had already taken the brush and pan and was at work upon the  floor. The lady said: \"You ain't familiar to me, child. You've lost  some folks lately, I see. Do you live 'round here?\"    The little girl stopped and looked up at her in surprise. \"Why, don't  you know about it?\" she cried.    \"Know about what, child?\"    \"Didn't you know I had come here to live with you?\"    \"Bless us and save us!\" ejaculated Aunt Alvirah. \"How did that  happen?\"    \"Didn't my uncle tell you?\" cried Ruth, much more surprised than the  old lady.    \"Who's your uncle, child?\"    \"Why, Mr. Potter--Uncle Jabez.\"    So astonished did the old lady appear to be that she started from her  chair and her ejaculation was changed to a moan of pain as she  murmured her old formula: \"Oh, my back and oh, my bones!\"    \"Jabez ain't said a word to me about it. Why should he take anybody to  help me? Is he struck with the fear o' his latter end?\"    She said this in no cross-grained way, but because she was so amazed.  She likewise stared harder and harder at her visitor.    \"You ain't come from the poor farm, child?\" she asked, finally.    The flush upon Ruth's cheek and the expression which came into her  face told Aunt Alviry that she was wrong there.    \"Not that you look like poorhouse breed--not at all. You're too  pretty dressed and you're too well fed. I know what they be there, for  I have been there myself. Yes, ma'am! Jabez Potter came after me to  the poor farm. I was sickly, too. There's them that said he went to  Doctor Davison first to find out if I was goin' to git well before he  come arter me; but Jabez ain't never treated me noways but kind. Starn  he is--by natur and by practice; an' clost he is in money matters.  But he's been good to an old woman without a home who warn't neither  kith nor kin to him.\"    Ruth listened to the first good word she had heard of Uncle Jabez, and  the speech comforted her somewhat. Perhaps there was something better  within the rough husk of Uncle Jabez, after all.    \"I did not live near here,\" Ruth said, quietly. \"But my papa and mama  did. I came from Darrowtown.\"    Aunt Alviry opened wide her bright brown eyes, and still stared in  wonder.    \"My mother's name was Mary Potter, and she was Mr. Potter's niece. So  he is my great-uncle.\"    \"Bless us and save us!\" ejaculated Aunt Alviry, again, shaking her  head. \"I never heard a word of it--never! I 'member Mary Potter,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/499"],[0,"Tom Swift in the Land of Wonders; Or, The Underground Search for the Idol of (#6)"],[1,"or.  And, maybe, with Mary, too, though I  think she is loyal to Tom.  But one never can tell.    \"However, I'm glad I know about it.  I'll do all I can to help Tom,  without letting him know that I know.  And if I can do anything to help  in finding that idol of gold for Professor Bumper, and, incidentally,  Tom, I'll do it,\" and he spoke aloud in his enthusiasm.    Ned, who was walking along in the darkness, clapped his open hand down  on Tom's magazine he was carrying home to read again, and the resultant  noise was a sharp crack.  As it sounded a figure jumped from behind a  tree and called tensely:    \"Hold on there!\"    Ned stopped short, thinking he was to be the victim of a holdup, but  his fears were allayed when he beheld one of the police force of  Shopton confronting him.    \"I heard what you said about gettin' the gold,\" went on the officer.  \"I was walkin' along and I heard you talkin'.  Where's your pal?\"    \"I haven't any, Mr. Newbold,\" answered Ned with a laugh, as he  recognized the man.    \"Oh, pshaw! It's Ned Newton!\" exclaimed the disappointed officer.  \"I  thought you was talkin' to a confederate about gold, and figured maybe  you was goin' to rob the bank.\"    \"No, nothing like that,\" answered Ned, still much amused.  \"I was  talking to myself about a trip Tom Swift and I are going to take  and----\"    \"Oh, that's all right,\" responded the policeman.  \"I can understand it,  if it had anything to do with Tom.  He's a great boy.\"    \"Indeed he is,\" agreed Ned, making a mental resolve not to be so public  with his thoughts in the future.  He chatted for a moment with the  officer, and then, bidding him good-night, walked on to his home, his  mind in a whirl with conglomerate visions of buried cities, great  grinning idols of gold, and rival professors seeking to be first at the  goal.    The next few days were busy ones for Tom, Ned and, in fact, the whole  Swift household.  Tom and his father had several consultations and  conducted several experiments in regard to the new stabilizer, the  completion of which was so earnestly desired.  Mr. Swift was sure he  could carry the invention to a successful conclusion.    Ned was engaged in putting the financial affairs of the Swift Company  in shape, so they would practically run themselves during his absence.  Then, too, there was the packing of their baggage which must be seen to.    Of course, the main details of the trip were left to Professor Bumper,  who knew just what to do.  He had told Tom and Ned that all they and  Mr. Damon would have to do would be to meet him at the pier in New  York, where they would find all arrangements made.    One day, near the end of the week (the beginning of the next being set  for the start) Eradicate came shuffling into the room where Tom was  sorting out the possessions he desired to take with him, Ned assisting  him in the task.    \"Well, Rad, what is it?\" asked Tom, with businesslike energy.    \"I done heah, Massa Tom, dat yo' all's gwine off on a long trip once  mo'.  Am dat so?\"    \"Yes, that's so, Rad.\"    \"Well, den, I'se come to ast yo' whut I'd bettah take wif me.  Shall I  took warm clothes or cool clothes?\"    \"Well, if you were going, Rad,\" answered Tom with a smile, \"you'd need  cool clothes, for we're going to a sort of jungle-land.  But I'm sorry  to say you're not going this trip.\"    \"I---- I ain't gwine?  Does yo' mean dat yo' all ain't gwine to take  me, Massa Tom?\"    \"That's it, Rad.  It isn't any trip for you.\"    \"Is certain not!\" broke in the voice of Koku, the giant, who entered  with a big trunk Tom had sent him for.  \"Master want strong man like a  bull.  He take Koku!\"    \"Look heah!\" spluttered Eradicate, and his eyes flashed.  \"Yo'--yo'  giant yo'--yo' may be strong laik a bull, but ya' ain't got as much  sense as mah mule, Boomerang! Massa Tom don't want no sich pusson wif  him.  He's gwine to take me.\"    \"He take me!\" cried Koku, and his voice was a roar while he beat on his  mighty chest with his huge fists.    Tom, seeing that the dispute was likely to be bothersome, winked at Ned  and began to speak.    \"I don't believe you'd like it there, Rad--not where we're going.  It's  a bad country.  Why the mosquitoes there bite holes in you--raise bumps  on you as big as eggs.\"    \"Oh, good land!\" ejaculated the old colored man.  \"Am dat so Massa Tom?\"    \"It sure is.  Then there's another kind of bug that burrows under your  fingernails, and if you don't get 'em out, your fingers drop off.\"    \"Oh, good land, Massa Tom! Am dat a fact?\"    \"It sure is.  I don't want to see those things happen to you, Rad.\"    Slowly the old colored man shook his head.    \"I don't mahse'f,\" he said.  \"I---- I guess I won't go.\"    Eradicate did not stop to ask how Tom and Ned proposed to combat these  two species of insects.    But there remained Koku to dispose of, and he stood smiling broadly as  Eradicate shuffled off.    \"Me no 'fraid bugs,\" said the giant.    \"No,\" said Tom, with a look at Ned, for he did not want to take the big  man on the trip for various reasons.  \"No, maybe not, Koku.  Your skin  is pretty tough.  But I understand there are deep pools of water in the  land where we are going, and in them lives a fish that has a hide like  an alligator and a jaw like a shark.  If you fall in it's all up with  you.\"    \"Dat true, Master Tom?\" and Koku's voice trembled.    \"Well, I've never seen such a fish, I'm sure, but the natives tell  about it.\"    Koku seemed to be considering the matter.  Strange as it may seem, the  giant, though afraid of nothing human and brave when it came to a  hand-to-claw argument with a wild animal, had a very great fear of the  water and the unseen life within it.  Even a little fresh-water crab in  a brook was enough to send him shrieking to shore.  So when Tom told of  this curious fish, which many natives of Central America firmly believe  in, the giant took thought with himself.  Finally, he gave a sigh and  said:    \"Me stay home and keep bad mans out of master's shop.\"    \"Yes, I guess that's the best thing for you,\" assented Tom with an air  of relief.  He and Ned had talked the matter over, and they had agreed  that the presence of such a big man as Koku, in an expedition going on  a more or less secret mission, would attract too much attention.    \"Well, I guess that clears matters up,\" said Tom, as he looked over a  collection of rifles and small arms, to decide which to take.  \"We  won't have them to worry about.\"    \"No, only Professor Beecher,\" remarked Ned, with a sharp look at his  chum.    \"Oh, we'll dispose of him all right!\" asserted Tom boldly.  \"He hasn't  had any experience in business of this sort, and with what you and  Professor Bumper and Mr. Damon know we ought to have little trouble in  getting ahead of the young man.\"    \"Not to speak of your own aid,\" added Ned.    \"Oh, I'll do what I can, of course,\" said Tom, with an air of  indifference.  But Ned knew his chum would work ceaselessly to help get  the idol of gold.    Tom gave no sign that there was any complication in his affair with  Mary Nestor, and of course Ned did not tell anything of what he knew  about it.    That night saw the preparations of Ned and Tom about completed.  There  were one or two matters yet to finish on Tom's part in relation to his  business, but these offered no difficulties.    The two chums were in the Swift home, talking over the prospective  trip, when Mrs. Baggert, answering a ring at the front door, announced  that Mr. Damon was outside.    \"Tell him to come in,\" ordered Tom.    \"Bless my baggage check!\" exclaimed the excitable man, as he shook  hands with Tom and Ned and noted the packing evidences all about.  \"You're ready to go to the land of wonders.\"    \"The land of wonders?\" repeated Ned.    \"Yes, that's what Professor Bumper calls the part of Honduras we're  going to.  And it must be wonderful, Tom.  Think of whole cities, some  of them containing idols and temples of gold, buried thirty and forty  feet under the surface! Wonderful is hardly the name for it!\"    \"It'll be great!\" cried Ned.  \"I suppose you're ready, Mr. Damon--you  and the professor?\"    \"Yes.  But, Tom, I have a bit of unpleasant news for you.\"    \"Unpleasant news?\"    \"Yes.  You know Professor Bumper spoke of a rival--a man named Beecher  who is a member of the faculty of a new and wealthy college.\"    \"I heard him speak of him--yes,\" and the way Tom said it no one would  have suspected that he had any personal interest in the matter.    \"He isn't going to give his secret away,\" thought Ned.    \"Well, this Professor Beecher, you know,\" went on Mr. Damon, \"also  knows about the idol of gold, and is trying to get ahead of Professor  Bumper in the search.\"    \"He did say something of it, but nothing was certain,\" remarked Tom.    \"But it is certain!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon.  \"Bless my toothpick, it's  altogether too certain!\"    \"How is that?\" asked Tom.  \"Is Beecher certainly going to Honduras?\"    \"Yes, of course.  But what is worse, he and his party will leave New  York on the same steamer with us!\"          CHAPTER VII    TOM HEARS SOMETHING      On hearing Mr. Damon's rather startling announcement, Tom and Ned  looked at one another.  There seemed to be something back of the simple  statement--an ominous and portending \"something.\"    \"On the same steamer with us, is he?\" mused Tom.    \"How did you learn this?\" asked Ned.    \"Just got a wire from Professor Bumper telling me.  He asked me to  telephone to you about it, as he was too busy to call up on the long  distance from New York.  But instead of 'phoning I decided to come over  myself.\"    \"Glad you did,\" said Tom, heartily.  \"Did Professor Bumper want us to  do anything special, now that it is certain his rival will be so close  on his trail?\"    \"Yes, he asked me to warn you to be careful what you did and said in  reference to the expedition.\"    \"Then does he fear something?\" asked Ned.    \"Yes, in a way.
