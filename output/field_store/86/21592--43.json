I initially decided to estimate home ranges for animals caught five or  more times and at three or more stations. Of the 282 animals caught and  marked, only 48 were caught five or more times. Because of the small  numbers of _P. maniculatus_ that were caught five or more times, I  wanted to determine whether mice caught four times had an estimated  range that was significantly smaller than that of mice caught five  times. Eight individuals of _P. maniculatus_ were caught four times  each, and it seemed desirable to use the data from these mice if such  use was justified. Data from the 48 mice caught five or more times were  used for this testing.    By means of a T-test, I compared the estimated ranges of those 48 mice  following their fourth capture with ranges estimated after the fifth  capture. The results did not demonstrate significant differences between  the two sets of estimates; therefore, I decided to use data resulting  from four or more captures, and at three or more stations.    Table 3 shows estimations of the home ranges of males and females of  each species of _Peromyscus_. When the inclusive boundary-strip method  is used, the area encompassed by the range tends to be larger than the  area of the same range when estimated by the exclusive boundary-strip  method. Stickel (1954:4) has shown that the inclusive boundary-strip  method overestimates the home range by about 17 percent.      Analysis of Home Range by Inclusive Boundary-Strip Method    When all age groups were considered, the ranges of 16 males of _P.  truei_ averaged 20,000 to 80,000 square feet (ave. 47,333; S. D.  19,286). The sizes of home ranges were not significantly different (P >  0.05) between adult and subadult (including juveniles and young) males.    All females of _P. truei_ (22) had ranges encompassing 16,666 to 83,333  square feet (ave. 40,666; S. D. 17,566). Sizes of home ranges between  adult and non-adult females did not differ significantly. The mean range  of adult males of _P. truei_ did not differ from that of adult females  (P > 0.05).    Fifteen males of _P. maniculatus_ had ranges of 16,666 to 66,666 square  feet (ave. 34,222; S. D. 16,000); six adult males had ranges of 33,333  to 53,333 square feet (ave. 38,666). Sizes of home ranges of adult and  non-adult males of this species did not differ significantly.    Five females of _P. maniculatus_ had ranges of 33,333 to 76,666 square  feet (ave. 51,333; S. D. 15,913); of these, four adults had ranges of  33,333 to 53,333 square feet (ave. 45,000). Sizes of home ranges of  adult males of this species did not differ (P > 0.05) from those of  adult females.    The ranges of adult males of _P. truei_ were compared with ranges of  adult male of _P. maniculatus_; likewise the ranges of adult females of  each species were compared. In each case no difference was demonstrable  in sizes of ranges between the species.    The largest home range of any _P. truei_ was that of animal number 18, a  young male with an estimated home range of 133,333 square feet. This  animal was caught only five times, and his home range appeared  unusually large in relation to that of other young males of this  species; hence some of the widely-spaced sites of capture probably  represent excursions from the animal's center of activity, rather than  the true periphery of his range. These data were, therefore, not used in  further computations. Stickel (1954:13) pointed out the advisability of  removing such records from data to be used in calculations of home  range.    Number eight had the largest home range of any female of _P. truei_; she  was captured ten times, and had a range of 83,333 square feet. The  vegetation within her range was pinyon-juniper woodland with  understories of _Amelanchier_, _Artemisia nova_ and _Purshia_. Most of  her home range was in the western half of unit H, but extended into  parts of units D, I, G and N.    The largest home range for adult males of either species was number  three of _P. truei_; he had a range of 80,000 square feet. The largest  range for an adult of _P. maniculatus_ was 66,666 square feet (Table 3).      Analysis of Home Range by Exclusive Boundary-Strip Method    Stickel (1954:4) has shown that under theoretical conditions the  exclusive boundary-strip method is the most accurate of several methods  of estimating home range. This method overestimates the known range by  only two percent.    Table 3 shows a comparison of home range calculations obtained for each  species, when calculated by inclusive and exclusive boundary-strip  methods.    The data for males and for females of each species were compared in the  same manner as in the inclusive boundary-strip method. The ranges of 16  male individuals of _P. truei_ encompassed 14,000 to 56,666 square feet  (ave. 34,333; S. D. 13,266); of these, the ranges of 10 adult males were  from 23,333 to 53,333 square feet (ave. 39,733). Twenty-two females of  this species had ranges of 13,333 to 50,000 square feet (ave. 27,199; S.  D. 8,820). Eighteen adult females had the same extremes, but the average  size of range, 28,000 square feet, was larger. Sizes of home ranges of  males and females did not differ significantly.    The ranges of fifteen males of _P. maniculatus_ encompassed 13,333 to  46,666 square feet (ave. 26,666; S. D. 10,180). Of these, six adults had  the same extremes in range, but an average size of 31,440 square feet.    The ranges of five females of _P. maniculatus_ varied from 28,000 to  53,333 square feet (ave. 37,199; S. D. 10,140). All but one of these  females were adults. The sizes of home ranges of males and females did  not differ significantly. No differences were found when ranges of adult  males, or adult females, of both species were compared.      Adjusted Length of Home Range    The adjusted length of the range also can be used as an expression of  home range. In this method, one-half the distance to the next trapping  station is added to each end of the line drawn between stations at  either end of the long axis of the range (Stickel, 1954:2).    The average length of home range for 15 males of _P. truei_ was 363 feet  (S. D. 105 ft.); for 22 females of this species 326 feet (S. D. 94 ft.);  for 14 males of _P. maniculatus_ 286 feet long (S. D. 94 ft.); and for  four females of this species 347 feet (S. D. 83 ft.). The mean lengths  of range of males and females differed significantly in _P.  maniculatus_, but not in _P. truei_. However, no difference was  demonstrable in mean sizes of ranges between males, or between females,  of the two species.      Distance Between Captures    The distance between captures has been used by several investigators as  an index of the extent of home range. More short than long distances  tend to be recorded when traps are visited at random, and when inner  traps of the range are more strongly favored (Stickel, 1954:10).

The distances traveled between captures on successive nights were  calculated for all mice. Even animals caught most frequently usually  were caught only once or twice on successive nights. Data from animals  caught less than four times, and hence not usable for calculations of  home range, could be used in calculating the distance between captures  on successive nights. Thus the data were sampled in a more or less  random manner for each species.    The mean distance traveled between captures on successive nights was  determined for adult and non-adult animals (juvenile, young and  subadult) of both sexes. Adult males of _P. maniculatus_ traveled an  average of 151.66 feet (n = 24); young males of this species traveled an  average of 134.28 feet (n = 7). Adult females of _P. maniculatus_  traveled 170.00 feet (n = 4); no data were available for young females.    Adult males of _P. truei_ traveled an average of 169.47 feet (n = 38);  and young males traveled 159.44 feet (n = 18). Adult females of this  species traveled 155.71 feet between captures (n = 35), while young  females traveled 140.66 feet (n = 15).

It is  written in a plain and simple style, gives a most correct account of every  thing seen, and should therefore be in the possession of every person who  attempts the navigation of the strait.    Cordova's account of the climate is very uninviting. Speaking of the  rigours of the summer months (January, February, and March), he says,  \"Seldom was the sky clear, and short were the intervals in which we  experienced the sun's warmth: no day passed by without some rain having  fallen, and the most usual state of the weather was that of constant  rain.\"[10]    The accounts of Wallis and Carteret are still more gloomy. The former  concludes that part of his narrative with the following dismal and  disheartening description: \"Thus we quitted a dreary and inhospitable  region, where we were in almost continual danger of shipwreck for near four  months, having entered the strait on the 17th of December, and quitted it  on the 11th of April 1767: a region where, in the midst of summer, the  weather was cold, gloomy, and tempestuous, where the prospects had more the  appearance of a chaos than of nature; and where for the most part the  valleys were without herbage and the hills without wood.\"    These records of Cordova and Wallis made me feel not a little apprehensive  for the health of the crew, which could not be expected to escape uninjured  through the rigours of such a climate. Nor were the narratives of Byron or  Bougainville calculated to lessen my anxiety. In an account, however, of a  voyage to the strait by M. A. Duclos Guyot, the following paragraph tended  considerably to relieve my mind upon the subject:--\"At length, on Saturday  the 23d of March, we sailed out of that famous Strait, so much dreaded,  after having experienced that there, as well as in other places, it was  very fine, and very warm, and that for three-fourths of the time the sea  was perfectly calm.\"    In every view of the case, our proximity to the principal scene of action  occasioned sensations of a peculiar nature, in which, however, those that  were most agreeable and hopeful {11} preponderated. The officers and crews  of both ships were healthy, and elated with the prospect before them; our  vessels were in every respect strong and sea-worthy; and we were possessed  of every comfort and resource necessary for encountering much greater  difficulties than we had any reason to anticipate.           *       *       *       *       *        There has existed much difference of opinion as to the correct mode of      spelling the name of the celebrated navigator who discovered this      Strait. The French and English usually write it Magellan, and the      Spaniards Magallanes; but by the Portuguese (and he was a native of      Portugal) it is universally written Magalhaens. Admiral Burney and Mr.      Dalrymple spell it Magalhanes, which mode I have elsewhere adopted, but      I have since convinced myself of the propriety of following the      Portuguese orthography for a name which, to this day, is very common      both in Portugal and Brazil.           *       *       *       *       *      {12}    CHAPTER II.      Enter the Straits of Magalhaens (or Magellan), and anchor off Cape    Possession--First Narrow--Gregory Bay--Patagonian Indians--Second    Narrow--Elizabeth Island--Freshwater Bay--Fuegian Indians--Arrival    at Port Famine.    A contrary tide and light winds detained us at anchor near Cape Virgins  until four o'clock in the afternoon, when, with the turn of the tide, a  light air carried us past Dungeness Point, aptly named by Wallis from its  resemblance to that in the English Channel. A great number of seals were  huddled together upon the bank, above the wash of the tide, whilst others  were sporting about in the surf. Cape Possession was in sight, and with the  wind and tide in our favour we proceeded until ten o'clock, when the anchor  was dropped. At daylight we found ourselves six miles to the eastward of  the cape. The anchor was then weighed, and was again dropped at three miles  from the cape until the afternoon, when we made another attempt; but lost  ground, and anchored a third time. Before night a fourth attempt was made,  but the tide prevented our making any advance, and we again anchored.    Mount Aymond[11] and \"his four sons,\" or (according to the old quaint  nomenclature) the Asses' Ears, had been in sight all day, as well as a  small hummock of land on the S.W. horizon, which afterwards proved to be  the peaked hillock upon Cape Orange, at the south side of the entrance to  the First Narrow.    At this anchorage the tide fell thirty feet, but the strength of the  current, compared with the rate at which we afterwards found it to run, was  inconsiderable. Here we first experienced {13} the peculiar tides of which  former navigators have written. During the first half of the flood[12] or  westward tide, the depth decreased, and then, after a short interval,  increased until three hours after the stream of tide had begun to run to  the eastward.    The following morning (21st) we gained a little ground. Our glasses were  directed to the shore in search of inhabitants, for it was hereabouts that  Byron, and Wallis, and some of the Spanish navigators held communication  with the Patagonian Indians; but we saw none. Masses of large sea-weed,[13]  drifting with the tide, floated past the ship. A description of this  remarkable plant, although it has often been given before, may not be  irrelevant here. It is rooted upon rocks or stones at the bottom of the  sea, and rises to the surface, even from great depths. We have found it  firmly fixed to the ground more than twenty fathoms under water, yet  trailing along the surface for forty or fifty feet. When firmly rooted it  shows the set of the tide or current. It has also the advantage of  indicating rocky ground: for wherever there are rocks under water, their  situation is, as it were, buoyed by a mass of sea-weed[14] on the surface  of the sea, of larger extent than that of the danger below. In many  instances perhaps it causes unnecessary alarm, since it often grows in deep  water; but it should not be entered without its vicinity having been  sounded, especially if seen in masses, with the extremities of the stems  trailing along the surface. If there be no tide, or if the wind and tide  are the same way, the plant lies smoothly upon the water, but if the wind  be against the tide, the leaves curl up and are visible at a distance,  giving a rough, rippling appearance to the surface of the water.    During the last two days the dredge had furnished us with a few specimens  of _Infundibulum_ of Sowerby (_Patella trochi-formis_, Lin.), and some dead  shells (_Murex Magellanicus_) were brought up by the sounding-lead.    We made another attempt next morning, but again lost {14} ground, and the  anchor was dropped for the eighth time. The threatening appearances of the  clouds, and a considerable fall of the barometer indicating bad weather,  Captain Stokes agreed with me in thinking it advisable to await the  spring-tides to pass the First Narrow: the ships were therefore made snug  for the expected gale, which soon came on, and we remained several days  wind-bound, with top-masts struck, in a rapid tide-way, whose stream  sometimes ran seven knots. On the 28th, with some appearance of improving  weather, we made an attempt to pass through the Narrow. The wind blowing  strong, directly against us, and strengthening as we advanced, caused a  hollow sea, that repeatedly broke over us. The tide set us through the  Narrow very rapidly, but the gale was so violent that we could not show  more sail than was absolutely necessary to keep the ship under command.  Wearing every ten minutes, as we approached either shore, lost us a great  deal of ground, and as the anchorage we left was at a considerable distance  from the entrance of the Narrows, the tide was not sufficient to carry us  through. At slack water the wind fell, and as the weather became fine, I  was induced to search for anchorage near the south shore. The sight of  kelp, however, fringing the coast, warned me off, and we were obliged to  return to an anchorage in Possession Bay. The Beagle had already anchored  in a very favourable berth; but the tide was too strong to permit us to  reach the place she occupied, and our anchor was dropped a mile astern of  her, in nineteen fathoms. The tide was then running five, and soon  afterwards six miles an hour. Had the western tide set with equal strength,  we should have succeeded in passing the Narrow. Our failure, however,  answered the good purpose of making us more acquainted with the extent of a  bank that lines the northern side of Possession Bay, and with the time of  the turn of tide in the Narrow; which on this day (new moon) took place  within a few minutes of noon.    As we passed Cape Orange, some Indians were observed lighting a fire under  the lee of the hill to attract our notice; but we were too busily engaged  to pay much attention to {15} their movements. Guanacoes also were seen  feeding near the beach, which was the first intimation we had of the  existence of that animal southward of the Strait of Magalhaens.    When day broke (29th) it was discovered that the ship had drifted  considerably during the night. The anchor was weighed, and with a  favourable tide we reached an anchorage a mile in advance of the Beagle. We  had shoaled rather suddenly to eight fathoms, upon which the anchor was  immediately dropped, and on veering cable the depth was eleven fathoms. We  had anchored on the edge of a bank, which soon afterwards, by the tide  falling, was left dry within one hundred yards of the ship. Finding  ourselves so near a shoal, preparations were made to prevent the ship from  touching it. An anchor was dropped"]]]
