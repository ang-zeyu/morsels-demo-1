Almost the only living relative of these early fishes is a  little shark, known as the Port Jackson Shark, living in Australian  waters. Like the old sharks, this one has a spine in front of his back  fins, and, like them, he fortunately has a mouthful of diversely shaped  teeth; fortunately, because through their aid we are enabled to form  some idea of the manner in which some of the teeth found scattered  through the rocks were arranged. For the teeth were not planted in  sockets, as they are in higher animals, but simply rested on the jaws,  from which they readily became detached when decomposition set in after  death. To complicate matters, the teeth in different parts of the jaws  were often so unlike one another that when found separately they would  hardly be suspected of having belonged to the same animal. Besides teeth  these fishes, for purposes of offence and defence, were usually armed  with spines, sometimes of considerable size and strength, and often  elaborately grooved and sculptured. As the soft parts perished the teeth  and spines were left to be scattered by waves and currents, a tooth  here, another there, and a spine somewhere else; so it has often  happened that, being found separately, two or three quite different  names have been given to one and the same animal. Now and then some  specimen comes to light that escaped the thousand and one accidents to  which such things were exposed, and that not only shows the teeth and  spines but the faint imprint of the body and fins as well. And from such  rare examples we learn just what teeth and spines go with one another,  and sometimes find that one fish has received names enough for an entire  school.    These ancient sharks were not the large and powerful fishes that we have  to-day--these came upon the scene later--but mostly fishes of small  size, and, as indicated by their spines, fitted quite as much for  defence as offence. Their rise was rapid, and in their turn they became  the masters of the world, spreading in great numbers through the waters  that covered the face of the earth; but their supremacy was of short  duration, for they declined in numbers even during the Carboniferous  Period, and later dwindled almost to extinction. And while sharks again  increased, they never reached their former abundance, and the species  that arose were swift, predatory forms, better fitted for the struggle  for existence.      _REFERENCES_    _The early fishes make but little show in a museum, both on account of  their small size and the conditions under which they have been  preserved. The Museum of Comparative Zooelogy has a large collection of  these ancient vertebrates, and there is a considerable number of fine  teeth and spines of Carboniferous sharks in the United States National  Museum._    _Hugh Miller's \"The Old Red Sandstone\" contains some charming  descriptions of his discoveries of Pterichthys and related forms, and  this book will ever remain a classic._    [Illustration: Fig. 5.--Pterichthys, the Wing Fish.]          III    IMPRESSIONS OF THE PAST        \"_The weird palimpsest, old and vast,      Wherein thou hid'st the spectral past._\"      The Rev. H. N. Hutchinson commences one of his interesting books with  Emerson's saying, \"that Everything in nature is engaged in writing its  own history;\" and, as this remark cannot be improved on, it may well  stand at the head of a chapter dealing with the footprints that the  creatures of yore left on the sands of the sea-shore, the mud of a  long-vanished lake bottom, or the shrunken bed of some water-course. Not  only have creatures that walked left a record of their progress, but the  worms that burrowed in the sand, the shell-fish that trailed over the  mud when the tide was low, the stranded crab as he scuttled back to the  sea--each and all left some mark to tell of their former presence. Even  the rain that fell and the very wind that blew sometimes recorded the  direction whence they came, and we may read in the rocks, also, accounts  of freshets sweeping down with turbid waters, and of long periods of  drouth, when the land was parched and lakes and rivers shrank beneath  the burning sun.    All these things have been told and retold; but, as there are many who  have not read Mr. Hutchinson's books and to whom Buckland is quite  unknown, it may be excusable to add something to what has already been  said in the first chapter of these impressions of the past.    The very earliest suggestion we have of the presence of animal life upon  this globe is in the form of certain long dark streaks below the  Cambrian of England, considered to be traces of the burrows of worms  that were filled with fine mud, and while this interpretation may be  wrong there is, on the other hand, no reason why it may not be correct.  Plant and animal life must have had very lowly beginnings, and it is not  at all probable that we shall find any trace of the simple and minute  forms with which they started,[2] though we should not be surprised at  finding hints of the presence of living creatures below the strata in  which their remains are actually known to occur.    [2] _Within the last few years what are believed to be indications of  bacteria have been described from carboniferous rocks. Naturally such  announcements must be accepted with great caution, for while there is no  reason why this may not be true, it is much more probable that definite  evidence of the effects of bacteria on plants should be found than that  these simple, single-celled organisms should themselves have been  detected._    Worm burrows, to be sure, are hardly footprints, but tracks are found in  Cambrian rocks just above the strata in which the supposed burrows  occur, and from that time onward there are tracks a-plenty, for they  have been made, wherever the conditions were favorable, ever since  animals began to walk. All that was needed was a medium in which  impressions could be made and so filled that there was imperfect  adhesion between mould and matrix. Thus we find them formed not only by  the sea-shore, in sands alternately dry and covered, but by the  river-side, in shallow water, or even on land where tracks might be left  in soft or moist earth into which wind-driven dust or sand might lodge,  or sand or mud be swept by the mimic flood caused by a thunder shower.    So there are tracks in strata of every age; at first those of  invertebrates: after the worm burrows the curious complicated trails of  animals believed to be akin to the king crab; broad, ribbed, ribbon-like  paths ascribed to trilobites; then faint scratches of insects, and the  shallow, palmed prints of salamanders, and the occasional slender sprawl  of a lizard; then footprints, big and little, of the horde of Dinosaurs  and, finally, miles above the Cambrian, marks of mammals. Sometimes,  like the tracks of salamanders and reptiles in the carboniferous rocks  of Pennsylvania and Kansas, these are all we have to tell of the  existence of air-breathing animals. Again, as with the iguanodon, the  foot to fit the track may be found in the same layer of rock, but this  is not often the case.    Although footprints in the rocks must often have been seen, they seem to  have attracted little or no notice from scientific men until about 1830  to 1835, when they were almost simultaneously described both in Europe  and America; even then, it was some time before they were generally  conceded to be actually the tracks of animals, but, like worm burrows  and trails, were looked upon as the impressions of sea-weeds.    The now famous tracks in the \"brown stone\" of the Connecticut Valley  seem to have first been seen by Pliny Moody in 1802, when he ploughed up  a specimen on his farm, showing small imprints, which later on were  popularly called the tracks of Noah's raven. The discovery passed  without remark until in 1835 the footprints came under the observation  of Dr. James Deane, who, in turn, called Professor Hitchcock's attention  to them. The latter at once began a systematic study of these  impressions, publishing his first account in 1836 and continuing his  researches for many years, in the course of which he brought together  the fine collection in Amherst College. At that time Dinosaurs were  practically unknown, and it is not to be wondered at that these  three-toed tracks, great and small, were almost universally believed to  be those of birds. So it is greatly to the credit of Dr. Deane, who also  studied these footprints, that he was led to suspect that they might  have been made by other animals. This suspicion was partly caused by the  occasional association of four and five-toed prints with the three-toed  impressions, and partly by the rare occurrence of imprints showing the  texture of the sole of the foot, which was quite different from that of  any known bird.    [Illustration: Fig. 6.--Where a Dinosaur Sat Down.]    In the light of our present knowledge we are able to read many things in  these tracks that were formerly more or less obscure, and to see in them  a complete verification of Dr. Deane's suspicion that they were not made  by birds. We see clearly that the long tracks called _Anomoepus_,  with their accompanying short fore feet, mark where some Dinosaur  squatted down to rest or progressed slowly on all-fours, as does the  kangaroo when feeding quietly;[3] and we interpret the curious  heart-shaped depression sometimes seen back of the feet, not as the mark  of a stubby tail, but as made by the ends of the slender pubes, bones  that help form the hip-joints. Then, too, the mark of the inner, or  short first, toe, is often very evident, although it was a long time  before the bones of this toe were actually found, and many of the  Dinosaurs now known to have four toes were supposed to have but three.

This is the last day of the  month; to-morrow the salaries will be paid, consequently--\"    The commissary interrupted him:    \"Were you authorized to draw money whenever you wished to advance the  clerks' pay?\"    \"No; but I knew that M. Fauvel would not have refused me permission to  oblige my friends in the bank. What I did is done everywhere; I have  simply followed my predecessor's example.\"    The banker made a sign of assent.    \"As regards that spent by myself,\" continued the cashier, \"I had a sort  of right to it, all of my savings being deposited in this bank; about  fifteen thousand francs.\"    \"That is true,\" said M. Fauvel; \"M. Bertomy has at least that amount on  deposit.\"    This last question settled, the commissary's errand was over, and his  report might now be made. He announced his intention of leaving, and  ordered to cashier to prepare to follow him.    Usually, this moment when stern reality stares us in the face, when  our individuality is lost and we feel that we are being deprived of our  liberty, this moment is terrible.    At this fatal command, \"Follow me,\" which brings before our eyes the  yawning prison gates, the most hardened sinner feels his courage fail,  and abjectly begs for mercy.    But Prosper lost none of that studied phlegm which the commissary of  police secretly pronounced consummate impudence.    Slowly, with as much careless ease as if going to breakfast with a  friend, he smoothed his hair, drew on his overcoat and gloves, and said,  politely:    \"I am ready to accompany you, monsieur.\"    The commissary folded up his pocket-book, and bowed to M. Fauvel, saying  to Prosper:    \"Come!\"    They left the room, and with a distressed face, and eyes filled with  tears that he could not restrain, the banker stood watching their  retreating forms.    \"Good Heaven!\" he exclaimed: \"gladly would I give twice that sum to  regain my old confidence in poor Prosper, and be able to keep him with  me!\"    The quick-eared Fanferlot overheard these words, and prompted to  suspicion, and ever disposed to impute to others the deep astuteness  peculiar to himself, was convinced they had been uttered for his  benefit.    He had remained behind the others under pretext of looking for an  imaginary umbrella, and, as he reluctantly departed, said he would call  in again to see if it had been found.    It was Fanferlot's task to escort Prosper to prison; but, as they were  about starting, he asked the commissary to leave him at liberty to  pursue another course, a request which his superior granted.    Fanferlot had resolved to obtain possession of Prosper's note, which he  knew to be in Cavaillon's pocket.    To obtain this written proof, which must be an important one, appeared  the easiest thing in the world. He had simply to arrest Cavaillon,  frighten him, demand the letter, and, if necessary, take it by force.    But to what would this disturbance lead? To nothing unless it were an  incomplete and doubtful result.    Fanferlot was convinced that the note was intended, not for the young  clerk, but for a third person.    If exasperated, Cavaillon might refuse to divulge who this person was,  who after all might not bear the name \"Gypsy\" given by the cashier. And,  even if he did answer his questions, would he not lie?    After a mature reflection, Fanferlot decided that it would be  superfluous to ask for a secret when it could be surprised. To quietly  follow Cavaillon, and keep close watch on him until he caught him in the  very act of handing over the letter, was but play for the detective.    This method of proceeding, moreover, was much more in keeping with the  character of Fanferlot, who, being naturally soft and stealthy, deemed  it due to his profession to avoid all disturbance or anything resembling  evidence.    Fanferlot's plan was settled when he reached the vestibule.    He began talking with an office-boy, and, after a few apparently idle  questions, had discovered that the Fauvel bank had no outlet on the Rue  de la Victoire, and that consequently all the clerks were obliged to  pass in and out through the main entrance on the Rue de Provence.    From this moment the task he had undertaken no longer presented a shadow  of difficulty. He rapidly crossed the street, and took up his position  under a gateway.    His post of observation was admirably chosen; not only could he see  everyone who entered and came out of the bank, but also commanded a view  of all the windows, and by standing on tiptoe could look through the  grating, and see Cavaillon bending over his desk.    Fanferlot waited a long time, but did not wax impatient, for he had  often had to remain on watch entire days and nights at a time, with much  less important objects in view than the present one. Besides, his mind  was busily occupied in estimating the value of his discoveries, weighing  his chances, and, like Perrette with her pot of milk, building the  foundation of his fortune upon present success.    Finally, about one o'clock, he saw Cavaillon rise from his desk, change  his coat, and take down his hat.    \"Very good!\" he exclaimed, \"my man is coming out; I must keep my eyes  open.\"    The next moment Cavaillon appeared at the door of the bank; but  before stepping on the pavement he looked up and down the street in an  undecided manner.    \"Can he suspect anything?\" thought Fanferlot.    No, the young clerk suspected nothing; only having a commission to  execute, and fearing his absence would be observed, he was debating with  himself which would be the shortest road for him to take.    He soon decided, entered the Faubourg Montmartre, and walked up the Rue  Notre Dame de Lorette so rapidly, utterly regardless of the grumbling  passers-by whom he elbowed out of his way, that Fanferlot found it  difficult to keep him in sight.    Reaching the Rue Chaptal, Cavaillon suddenly stopped, and entered the  house numbered 39.    He had scarcely taken three steps in the narrow corridor when he felt a  touch on his shoulder, and turning abruptly, found himself face to face  with Fanferlot.    He recognized him at once, and turning very pale he shrank back, and  looked around for means of escape.    But the detective, anticipating the attempt, barred the passage-way.  Cavaillon saw that he was fairly caught.    \"What do you want with me?\" he asked in a voice tremulous with fright.    Fanferlot was distinguished among his confreres for his exquisite  suavity and unequalled urbanity. Even with his prisoners he was the  perfection of courtesy, and never was known to handcuff a man without  first obsequiously apologizing for being compelled to do so.    \"You will be kind enough, my dear monsieur,\" he said, \"to excuse the  great liberty I take; but I really am under the necessity of asking you  for a little information.\"    \"Information! From me, monsieur?\"    \"From you, my dear monsieur; from M. Eugene Cavaillon.\"    \"But I do not know you.\"    \"Ah, yes; you remember seeing me this morning. It is only about a  trifling matter, and you will overwhelm me with obligations if you will  do me the honor to accept my arm, and step outside for a moment.\"    What could Cavaillon do? He took Fanferlot's arm, and went out with him.    The Rue Chaptal is not one of those noisy thoroughfares where  foot-passengers are in perpetual danger of being run over by numberless  vehicles dashing to and fro; there were but two or three shops, and from  the corner of Rue Fontaine occupied by an apothecary, to the entrance of  the Rue Leonie, extended a high, gloomy wall, broken here and there by a  small window which lighted the carpenters' shops behind.    It was one of those streets where you could talk at your ease, without  having to step from the sidewalk every moment. So Fanferlot and  Cavaillon were in no danger of being disturbed by passers-by.    \"What I wished to say is, my dear monsieur,\" began the detective, \"that  M. Prosper Bertomy threw you a note this morning.\"    Cavaillon vaguely foresaw that he was to be questioned about this note,  and instantly put himself on his guard.    \"You are mistaken,\" he said, blushing to his ears.    \"Excuse me, monsieur, for presuming to contradict you, but I am quite  certain of what I say.\"    \"I assure you that Prosper never gave me anything.\"    \"Pray, monsieur, do not persist in a denial; you will compel me to prove  that four clerks saw him throw you a note written in pencil and closely  folded.\"    Cavaillon saw the folly of further contradicting a man so well informed;  so he changed his tactics, and said:    \"It is true Prosper gave me a note this morning; but it was intended for  me alone, and after reading it I tore it up, and threw the pieces in the  fire.\"    This might be the truth. Fanferlot feared so; but how could he assure  himself of the fact? He remembered that the most palpable tricks often  succeed the best, and trusting to his star, he said at hazard:    \"Permit me to observe that this statement is not correct; the note was  intrusted to you to give to Gypsy.\"    A despairing gesture from Cavaillon apprised the detective that he was  not mistaken; he breathed again.    \"I swear to you, monsieur,\" began the young man.    \"Do not swear, monsieur,\" interrupted Fanferlot; \"all the oaths in the  world would be useless. You not only preserved the note, but you came  to this house for the purpose of giving it to Gypsy, and it is in your  pocket now.\"    \"No, monsieur, no!\"    Fanferlot paid no attention to"]]]
