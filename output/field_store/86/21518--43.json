Citizen Sightings    The wolves were seen by many citizens early after their release (Table 5  and 6), no doubt because of the wolves' confusion, their extensive  movements, and their lack of familiarity with the region. They often  traveled near populated areas and probably moved more during the day  than they would have in their native territory. They were known to have  made 14 daytime moves (from citizen reports) in addition to those  observed from the aircraft. In at least five of the citizen reports, the  wolves were observed sitting alongside the road, or otherwise making  little attempt to move away immediately. However, after April 13 the  group of three wolves was reported by citizens only twice, and Wolf No.  10, three times.    _Table 5.

As he was never far away, and was  sometimes only four and a half feet by measure from a chamber window,  all that he did could be seen. He did not catch insects at his holes. He  drank sap and ate bark.    Finally, the theory is not only improbable and inadequate, but in this  instance it is impossible. I do not remember seeing a sapsucker in the  tree in the spring; if he came in the summer, it must have been at rare  intervals; but he was always there in the fall, when the leaves were  dropping. At that season the insect hordes had been dispersed by the  autumnal frosts, so that we know he did not come for insects.    In the many years during which I watched the sapsuckers--for there were  undoubtedly a number of different birds that came, although never more  than one at a time--there was such a curious similarity in their actions  that it is entirely proper to speak as if the same bird returned year  after year. His visits, as I have said, were usually made at the same  season. He would come silently and early, with the evident intention of  making this an all-day excursion. By eight o'clock he would be seen  clinging to a branch and curiously observant of the dining-room window,  which at that hour probably excited both his interest and his alarm.  Early in the day he showed considerable activity, flitting from limb to  limb and sinking a few holes, three or four in a row, usually _above_  the previous upper girdle of the limbs he selected to work upon. After  he had tapped several limbs he would sit waiting patiently for the sap  to flow, lapping it up quickly when the drop was large enough. At first  he would be nervous, taking alarm at noises and wheeling away on his  broad wings till his fright was over, when he would steal quietly back  to his sap-holes. When not alarmed, his only movement was from one row  of holes to another, and he tended them with considerable regularity. As  the day wore on he became less excitable, and clung cloddishly to his  tree-trunk with ever increasing torpidity, until finally he hung  motionless as if intoxicated, tippling in sap, a disheveled, smutty,  silent bird, stupefied with drink, with none of that brilliancy of  plumage and light-hearted gayety which made him the noisiest and most  conspicuous bird of our April woods.    Our mountain ash trees have told us several facts about the sapsucker:--    That he did not come to eat insects.    That he did come to drink sap, and that he probably ate the inner bark  also.    That he drank the sap because he liked it, not for some secondary  object, as insects.    That he could detect difference in the quality or quantity of the sap,  which caused him to prefer a particular tree.    That this difference apparently was in the taste of the sap, and that  the effects of a day's drinking of mountain ash sap seemed to indicate  some intoxicant or narcotic quality in the sap of that particular tree.    That the effect of his work upon the tree was apparently injurious, as  it is the only cause assigned of a healthy tree's dying before a less  healthy one of the same age and species, subject all its life to the  same conditions.    So much we have learned about this sapsucker's habits, and now we should  like to know why his work is harmful, and why that of the other  woodpeckers is not. It is not because he drinks the sap. All the sap he  could eat or waste would not harm the tree, if allowed to run out of a  few holes. Think how many gallons the sugar-makers drain out of a single  tree without killing the tree. But the sugar-maker takes the sap in the  spring, when the crude sap is mounting up in the tree, while the  sapsucker does not begin his work till midsummer or autumn, when the  tree is sending down its elaborated sap to feed the trunk and make it  grow. This accounts for the woodpecker's digging his pits _above_ the  lines of the holes already in the tree. The loss of this elaborated sap  is a greater injury than the waste of a far larger quantity of crude  sap, so that on the season of the year when the sapsucker digs his holes  depends in large measure the amount of damage he does. The injury that  he does to the wood itself is trivial. He is not a wood_pecker_ except  at time of nesting, and most woodpeckers prefer to build in a dead or  dying branch, where their work does no hurt. But we know very well that  a tree may be a wreck, riven from top to bottom by lightning, split open  to the heart by the tempest, entirely hollow the whole length of its  trunk, and yet may flourish and bear fruit. The tree lives in its outer  layers. It may be crippled in almost any way, if the bark is left  uninjured; but if an inch of bark is cut out entirely around the tree,  it will die, for the sap can no longer run up and down to nourish it.    This is the sapsucker's crime: he girdles the tree,--not at his first  coming, nor yet at his second, not with one row of holes, nor yet with  two; but finally, after years perhaps, when row after row of punctures,  each checking a little the flow of sap, have overlapped and offset each  other and narrowed the channels through which it could mount and  descend, until the flow is stopped. Then the tree dies. It is not the  holes he makes, nor the sap he draws, but the way he places his holes  that makes the sapsucker an unwelcome visitor. For an unacceptable  individual he is to the farmer,--_persona non grata_, as kings say of  ambassadors who do not please their majesties. What shall we do with  him, the only black sheep in all the woodpecker flock? Let him alone,  unless we are positively sure that we know him from every other kind of  woodpecker. The damage he does is trifling compared with what we should  do if we made war upon other woodpeckers for some supposed wrong-doing  of the sapsucker.          VIII    EL CARPINTERO      In California and along the southwestern boundary of the United States  lives a woodpecker known among the Mexicans as El Carpintero, the  Carpenter.    Carpentering is both his profession and his pastime, and he seems really  to enjoy the work. When there is nothing more pressing to be done, he  spends his time tinkering around, fitting acorns into holes in such  great numbers and in so workmanlike a fashion that we do not know which  is more remarkable, his patience or his skill. Every acorn is fitted  into a separate hole made purposely for it, every one is placed butt end  out and is driven in flush with the surface, so that a much frequented  tree often appears as if studded with ornamental nails. \"What an  industrious bird!\" we exclaim; but still it takes some time to  appreciate how enormous is the labor of the Carpenter. Whole trees will  sometimes be covered with his work, until a single tree has thousands of  acorns bedded into its bark so neatly and tightly that no other  creature can remove them.    [Illustration: Work of Californian Woodpecker.]    We may take for examination, from specimens of the Carpenter's work, a  piece of spruce bark seven inches long by six wide, containing ten  acorns and two empty holes. As spruce bark is so much harder and rougher  than the pine bark in which he usually stores his nuts,[1] this  specimen looks rough and unfinished, and even shows some acorns driven  in sidewise; but for another reason I have preferred it to  better-looking examples of his work for study. As we shall see later, it  gives us a definite bit of information about the bird.    [Footnote 1: They often use white-oak bark, fence-posts, telegraph  poles, even the stalks of century-plants, when trees are not convenient.  (Merriam, _Auk_, viii. 117.)]    Think of the work of digging these twelve holes. Think of the labor of  carrying these ten large acorns and driving them in so tightly that  after years of shrinking they cannot be removed by a knife without  injuring either the acorn or the bark. Yet how small a part of the  woodpecker's year's work is here! How long could he live on ten acorns?  How many must he gather for his winter's needs? How many must he lose by  forgetting to come back to them? We cannot calculate the work a single  bird does nor the nuts he eats, for several birds usually work in  company and may use the same tree; but all the woodpeckers are large  eaters, and the Californian has been singled out for special mention.    Can we estimate the amount of work required to lay up one day's food?  Judging by the amount of nuts some other birds will eat, I should  think that all ten acorns contained in this piece of bark could be eaten  in one day without surfeit. The estimate seems to me well inside of his  probable appetite. I have experimented on this piece of bark, using a  woodpecker's bill for a tool, and it takes me twenty minutes to dig a  hole as large but not as neat as these. Doubtless it would not take the  woodpecker as long; but at my rate of working, four hours were spent in  digging these twelve holes. Then each acorn had to be hunted up and  brought to the hole prepared for it. This entailed a journey, it may  have been only from one tree to another, or it may have been, and very  likely was, a considerable flight. For these acorns grew on oak-trees,  and we find them driven into the bark of pines and spruces.    [Illustration]    This it is which gives our specimen its particular interest. While oaks  and pines may be intermingled, though they naturally prefer different  soils and situations, and in the Rocky Mountains the pine-belt lies  above the oak region, spruce and oak trees do not grow in the same soil.  The spruce-belt stands higher up than the pine. As these nuts are stored  in the bark of a spruce-tree, we have clear evidence that the bird must  have carried them some distance. For every nut he made the whole  journey back and forth, since he could carry but one at a time,--ten  long trips back"]]]
