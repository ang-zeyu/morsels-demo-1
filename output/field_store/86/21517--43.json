A female (KU 38830, length of body, 1180) that was obtained  on June 2 contained 17 eggs, each approximately 32 mm. long. The  ventrals of two females numbered 223 and 229, and the subcaudals of the  latter 70. Ventrals and subcaudals of five males were, respectively,  211, 213, 214, 215, 216, and 71, 75, 75, 69, 75.    The coloration and pattern of our seven specimens are of interest in  view of the probable intergradation between _E. s. anomala_ and _E. s.  schrencki_ in northern Korea (see comments by Shannon, 1956:46). The  smallest specimen (KU 38831), having a total length of 335 (280 + 55),  was obtained 4 mi. N P'yong-taek on September 24. It is nearly uniform  pale brown (lacks a dorsal pattern) and additionally is characterized as  follows: incomplete pattern on the head; no black postocular band (pale  brown with black posterior border); ventrolateral extensions of the head  pattern that form longitudinal stripes of white on the third row of  scales; a pale whitish stripe on the sixth and seventh scale rows that  extends posteriorly to the level of the fortieth ventral and that has a  narrow black border (sometimes interrupted); small and indistinct  blackish markings and pale stripes on sides (no higher than sixth row of  scales); underside of the head whitish; and venter grayish, having  blackish margins on the ends of ventrals posteriorly. KU 38831 is  unusual and perhaps anomalous in having a pattern that does not conform  to the juvenile pattern of either subspecies.    A female (KU 38830), having a total length of 1390 (1180 + 210), from 5  mi. ESE Seoul conforms to descriptions of _anomala_ in being uniformly  pale brown above and in having indistinct dark smudges on the sides; the  ventral surface is whitish having indistinct dark smudges, brown spots  at the ends of each ventral, and the posterior edge of each ventral  brown. A male (KU 40125), measuring 1090 (890 + 200) in total length,  from 5 mi. E Seoul, is pale brown above and lacks markings on the  anterior part of the body. Indistinct dark markings occur at midbody,  whereas the posterior quarter of the body and tail have well-defined  black bands on a buff background. The black bands posteriorly are  arranged in pairs; each pair of bands is separated by two and a half to  three scales, whereas the bands of each pair are separated by only one  and a half scales. The ventral surface has an obscure marbled pattern.  Our largest specimen, a male (UMMZ 113454) having a total length of 1488  (1230 + 258), from the Central National Forest, resembles KU 40125,  except that pale brown blotches (29 on body, one blackish on neck) and  dark lateral spots occur anteriorly on the body.    Another female (KU 38860, body length, 970) from 4-1/2 mi. W Chip'o-ri,  our northernmost locality of record, has a fairly distinct pattern  dorsally. The 30 dark brown, black-edged blotches that are separated by  a buff background are not arranged in pairs (as in KU 40125); the dorsal  blotches sometimes alternate with small lateral blotches. The ventral  surface is marbled throughout.    Two males from the Central National Forest, having total lengths of 1105  (920 + 185) and 830 (690 + 140), generally resemble one another in  having the head and neck dark brown or blackish and the anterior part of  body dark brown, but discernibly blotched. The posterior part of the  body and tail of each bears well-defined blotches (dark brown or black)  with buffy interspaces; the dorsal blotches are sometimes arranged in  pairs. The ventral surface of each is marbled throughout. These two  males are noteworthy in that the pattern anteriorly is obscure, but the  ground color is dark, not pale as in the two specimens from the vicinity  of Seoul.      =Agkistrodon halys brevicaudus= Stejneger        _Agkistrodon blomhoffii brevicaudus_ Stejneger, Bull.

NW Chip'o-ri, 2 (KU); 16 mi. NE Mosulp'o,      Cheju Do, 1 (UMMZ); 5 mi. E Seoul, 1 (UMMZ); 6 mi. E Seoul, 2 (KU);      7 mi. ESE Seoul, 1 (KU); 7 mi. NNE Sogwi-ri, Cheju Do, 1 (UMMZ).    _Remarks._--Individuals of _Agkistrodon_ were collected on brushy or  wooded hillsides, along rock walls or in piles of rocks, and in damp,  rocky, wooded ravines near streams. Many were docile when captured. One  specimen was infested with nematodes, another with cestodes. One  specimen had eaten a striped field mouse, _Apodemus agrarius_, and  another had eaten a gray hamster, _Cricetulus triton_. One female,  obtained on May 22, 6 mi. E Seoul, contained 14 embryos. Another female,  obtained on August 25 in the Central National Forest, contained three  well-developed embryos.    We have not included descriptive or taxonomic remarks concerning _A.  halys_ because Dr. Howard K. Gloyd, University of Arizona, who currently  is studying the systematics of the genus _Agkistrodon_, has our  specimens on loan.

THE DRAGON FLY    _An Insect adapted to Aerial Life_          _Materials._    Mounted specimens of dragon flies, some moist preserved specimens,  living specimens if practicable, simple lenses.          _Observations._    1. Identify the three regions of the body and note the presence of a  distinct neck. What is the length of the insect? What is its general  form? If you have living specimens, discover what movements the head  and abdomen are capable of making.    2. What is the position and general character of the wings? Explain  how these wings are made very efficient for flying. Why should they  not fold?    3. For what do the legs seem best adapted? Why?    4. Note the size of the eyes and of the antennae? How do you account  for the great size of the eyes and the relatively small antennae?    5. What is the type of mouth parts, biting or sucking? If you have  living dragon flies, try feeding them flies or mosquitoes and note  how they are seized.    6. The food of dragon flies is mosquitoes and flies caught while on  the wing. In what various ways is the dragon fly specialized for  getting food in this manner?          _Summary._    How is the dragon fly fitted for its aerial life with respect to its  body, means and method of locomotion, sense organs, kind of food and  manner of obtaining it?          _Suggested drawing._    a. Dorsal view, showing veining of one wing.      6. THE HONEYBEE    _A Study of Adaptations for Community Life_          _Materials._    Preserved specimens of workers in small vials and in watch glasses,  and some mounted specimens. A demonstration case showing the three  kinds of members of the community, stages in the development of the  workers and queens and the cells in which they are reared, specimens  of the comb. Small pieces of beeswax, a box of honey, and specimens  of comb free for examination. Mounted preparations of mouth parts and  stings. Simple lenses and compound microscopes.          _Observations._    _The Worker Bee._    1. Observe and describe the form, size, regions, and covering of the  bee. What are its colors?    2. Observe and describe the texture, veining, relative size, and  position of the wings. Discover how the fore and hind wings are  hooked together. What advantage in having them hooked together?    3. For what kind of locomotion are the legs best adapted?    4. Find the pollen basket on the tarsus of a hind leg. How is it  fitted for carrying pollen? What are the wax shears?      a. Examine and describe the structure at the posterior end of the    body used for stinging. (Use a mounted preparation for this with    low-power of microscope.)      b. The mouth parts are fitted for both biting and sucking. Find    what makes this possible. (Use mounted preparation.)    5. Describe the antennae and the number, position, and shape of the  eyes. Are the eyes fitted for keen sight? Give reason for answer.    6. The worker bee gathers honey and pollen and defends the entire  community from enemies. What various adaptations fit it for this  work?    _The Community of Bees._    7. How do the workers, drones, and queen differ in general  appearance?    8. Describe the appearance of the comb and the arrangement and shape  of the cells. Why this shape? How are the cells closed when full of  honey?    9. How do the cells used for rearing worker bees differ from those  used for rearing queens? What is the appearance of the larvae? Of the  pupa?    10. Examine and test in various ways a small piece of beeswax. What  are the qualities possessed by this wax which make it suitable for  making comb and protecting the home from storms?      Supplementary Studies of Bees          _Materials._    For this study an observation hive of bees or opportunity to visit an  apiary will be helpful. If neither are practicable, then look up the  answers in books. There are government bulletins on bee-keeping and  much helpful information can be obtained from large dealers in bees  and bee supplies.          _Observations._    1. How do bees protect their hives from rain and storm and light?    2. What are honey boxes? Where are they placed in the hive? Can the  honey be removed late in the fall?    3. How is it safe to approach and handle bees in removing honey and  caring for them?    4. What are their habits in entering and leaving the hive? What is  the appearance of a returning loaded worker bee?    5. How do bees survive the winter? Why are the drones driven away or  killed?    6. Watch bees gathering nectar and pollen from flowers and describe  the process. Try following a bee on its journeys.    7. When the bees are in the hive, how may you know the queen and  drones from the workers?    8. What is swarming? When does it take place? How is the swarm hived?    9. What is the home of wild honeybees? How found?      Summary of the Study of Honeybees      How is the work of the community of bees divided among the bees? How  is each fitted for the work? What do you think of the success of this  kind of life? Give reasons for your answer.      7. GENERAL STUDY OF INSECTS[1]     [1] This study is intended for an alternative study in case it is   not practicable to use the studies of living insects. With slight   adaptation it can be made useful for any insect, either preserved   or living.          _Materials._    Both living and preserved specimens of the insects studied should be  at hand, if practicable. There also should be specimens of the young.          _Observations._    _The Body._    1. What is the shape and size of the insect and the number of regions  in its body? Does the shape seem to be in any way adapted to the mode  of life of the insect? If so, how?    _Locomotion._    2. What methods of locomotion has the insect? Which is the most used?    3. What is the position of the wings when at rest? What is the  texture (_e.g._ thick, smooth, leathery, shell-like, membranous) of  the fore and hind wings?    4. For what kind of locomotion are the legs fitted? How?    _Sense Organs._    5. How many antennae has the insect? What is their character as to  shape and length? How many simple and compound eyes?    _Feeding._    6. What is the food of the insect? How are the mouth parts specially  adapted to obtaining this food?      _Note._--The mouth parts of insects may be jaws for biting, or    may form a tube for sucking, or a beak for piercing and sucking.    _Respiration._    7. Look for movements of the body indicating breathing, and describe  what you find. Discover the location of the spiracles.    _Protection._    8. What are the enemies of this insect? (Among the most important  enemies of insects are birds, certain other insects, and various  small vertebrates such as frogs, snakes, lizards, turtles, etc.) How  does the insect protect itself from these enemies?    9. Describe the shell with respect to thickness and flexibility. What  is the character of the surface as to roughness or smoothness or  covering of hairs or scales?      _Reproduction and Development._      _Note._--It may be necessary to get answers to these questions    from books."]]]
