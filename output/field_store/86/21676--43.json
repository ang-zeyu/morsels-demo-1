FOOTNOTES:    [1] This table represents the columns as they were disposed at  Midsummer 1901.          SOUTH AFRICA AND THE TRANSVAAL WAR    PEACE        \"On her knees, before the glory of the Lord,      Britannia sheathes the lightnings of her sword;            Once again, to utmost ends            Of the Red Line it defends,      She hath peace.\"--SIR EDWIN ARNOLD.    THE SITUATION--FEBRUARY 1901      The reign of His Majesty King Edward VII. began in clouds! There was  no denying that the last half-year had been one of retrogression. In  June 1900, from the Orange River southwards, there had been  comparative quietude. The southern and eastern half of the Orange  River Colony had become fairly settled, while even in some districts  of the Transvaal--towards the south-western area especially--the  inhabitants gave indications of a willingness to accept British rule,  and of a desire to return to their agricultural and peaceful  avocations. But with the end of the year came a deplorable change. The  enemy, broken up into a large number of desultory gangs, commenced  raiding and wrecking, consequently the British forces, in order to  cope with and pursue these vagrant bands, had to be broken up to  correspond. The area of hostility and destruction grew larger daily  and the difficulty of fighting more extreme. The lack of supplies now  drove the Boers, who lived entirely on the country through which they  passed, to spend their time in looting, in pouncing on the farms and  small villages, and in seizing everything they might need. Stores,  clothing, horses, cattle, all were grabbed at the point of the rifle,  if not, as in some cases, delivered up on demand. To frustrate the  tactics of the enemy, the British forces were compelled to denude the  country of every movable thing, and to place whatever could be  conveyed there in refuge camps which were established at points along  the railway lines. But in this operation great loss was entailed,  owing to the difficulty of finding sufficient grass for the number of  collected animals, and of keeping them alive _en route_.    The loss of crops and stock became a still more serious matter than  even the destruction of farm buildings--a measure which had almost  entirely been abandoned. Having regard to the inexpensive character  of these structures, this measure, to quote Sir Alfred Milner, was a  \"comparatively small item\" in the total damage caused by the war to  the agricultural community. But, he said, the wanton and malicious  injury done to the headgear, stamps, and other apparatus of some of  the outlying mines by Boer raiders was a form of destruction for which  there was no excuse. It was a vandalism unjustified by the  requirements of military operations and outside the scope of civilised  warfare. Directly or indirectly, all South Africa, including the  agricultural population, owes its prosperity to the mines, and, of  course, especially to the mines of the Transvaal. To money made in  mining it is indebted for such progress, even in agriculture, as it  has recently made, and the same source will have to be relied upon for  the recuperation of agriculture after the ravages of war. The damage  done to the mines Lord Milner estimated was not large \"relatively to  the vast total amount of the fixed capital sunk in them. The mining  area,\" he said, \"is excessively difficult to guard against purely  predatory attacks having no military purpose, because it is, so to  speak, 'all length and no breadth'--one long thin line, stretching  across the country from east to west for many miles. Still, garrisoned  as Johannesburg now is, it was only possible successfully to attack a  few points in it. Of the raids previously made, and they have been  fairly numerous, only one has resulted in any serious damage. In that  instance the injury done to the single mine attacked amounted to  L200,000, and it is estimated that the mine is put out of working for  two years. This mine is only one out of a hundred, and is not by any  means one of the most important. These facts may afford some  indication of the ruin which might have been inflicted, not only on  the Transvaal and all South Africa, but on many European interests, if  that general destruction of mine works which was contemplated just  before our occupation of Johannesburg had been carried out. However  serious in some respects may have been the military consequences of  our rapid advance to Johannesburg, South Africa owes more than is  commonly recognised to that brilliant dash forward, by which the vast  mining apparatus, the foundation of all her wealth, was saved from the  ruin threatening it.\"    The events of the last six months promised to involve a more vast  amount of repair and a longer period of recuperation, especially for  agriculture, than would have been anticipated at the commencement of  hostilities. Still, having regard to the fact that both the Rand and  Kimberley were virtually undamaged, and that the main engines of  prosperity, when once set going again, would not take very long to get  into working order, the economic consequences of the war, though  grave, did not appear by any means appalling. The country population  it was admitted would need a good deal of help, first to preserve it  from starvation, and then, probably, to supply it with a certain  amount of capital to make a fresh start. And the great industry of the  country would require some little time before it would be able to  render any assistance. But, in a young country with great recuperative  powers, many years would not elapse before the economic ravages of the  war would be effaced.    Still, the moral effect of the recrudescence of the war was  lamentable. Everywhere after the occupation of Pretoria the  inhabitants had seemed resigned to the state of affairs--the feeling  in the colony had been one of acquiescent relief. The rebellious  element was glad of the opportunity to settle down. Had these people  been shut off from communication with the enemy they would have  maintained their calm, and engaged themselves with their former  peaceful pursuits. As it was, while the great advance to Pretoria, and  subsequently to Delagoa Bay, demanded the presence of the British  troops in the north, the country was left open to raiders, who daily  grew more audacious as the small successes of their guerilla leaders  appeared to give promise of a turn of fortune's wheel.    And now came the real tug of war. These raiders, both on the brink of  the Orange Colony and the Southern Transvaal, kept the peaceable  inhabitants of the colony in an unenviable quandary. These, and many  others, on taking the oath of neutrality, instead of being made  prisoners of war, had been permitted to return to their farms. But  under pressure from their old comrades, they now wavered between the  obligations of their oath and the calls of friendship--and many of  them fell. Men who had been exceptionally well treated were again in  arms, sometimes justifying their break of faith by the poor apology  that they had not been \"preserved from the temptation to commit it.\"  Naturally, on the return of the troops to again quell a rising in the  south, their conduct was not marked by the same leniency which had  characterised the original conquest. Still, these parole breakers were  not punished with the severity which might have been meted out to them  in the same circumstances by other nations. Though we were by the  rules of war entitled to shoot men who had broken their parole, we had  not availed ourselves of the right.    We remained as humane as the exigence of discipline would permit.  Efforts were made to check the general demoralisation by establishing  refuge camps for the peaceable along the railway lines, but these  camps were mainly tenanted by the women and children of burghers who  still determined to flout us.    Lord Milner, in speaking of the situation in the new territories and  the Cape Colony, described it as possibly \"the most puzzling that we  have had to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4715"],[0,"An African Millionaire: Episodes in the Life of the Illustrious Colonel Clay (#6)"],[1,"e's handicraft. We were  sorry for the incident; but a man in Sir Charles's position is such  a mark for rogues that, if he did not take means to protect himself  promptly, he would be for ever overrun by them.    When we went up to our salon that evening, Amelia flung herself on  the sofa. \"Charles,\" she broke out in the voice of a tragedy queen,  \"those are real diamonds, and I shall never be happy again till I  get them.\"    \"They are real diamonds,\" Charles echoed. \"And you shall have them,  Amelia. They're worth not less than three thousand pounds. But I  shall bid them up gently.\"    So, next day, Charles set to work to higgle with the curate.  Brabazon, however, didn't care to part with them. He was no  money-grubber, he said. He cared more for his mother's gift and a  family tradition than for a hundred pounds, if Sir Charles were to  offer it. Charles's eye gleamed. \"But if I give you _two_ hundred!\"  he said insinuatingly. \"What opportunities for good! You could  build a new wing to your village school-house!\"    \"We have ample accommodation,\" the curate answered. \"No, I don't  think I'll sell them.\"    Still, his voice faltered somewhat, and he looked down at them  inquiringly.    Charles was too precipitate.    \"A hundred pounds more or less matters little to me,\" he said; \"and  my wife has set her heart on them. It's every man's duty to please  his wife--isn't it, Mrs. Brabazon?--I offer you three hundred.\"    The little Scotch girl clasped her hands.    \"Three hundred pounds! Oh, Dick, just think what fun we could have,  and what good we could do with it! Do let him have them.\"    Her accent was irresistible. But the curate shook his head.    \"Impossible,\" he answered. \"My dear mother's ear-rings! Uncle  Aubrey would be so angry if he knew I'd sold them. I daren't face  Uncle Aubrey.\"    \"Has he expectations from Uncle Aubrey?\" Sir Charles asked of  White Heather.    Mrs. Brabazon laughed. \"Uncle Aubrey! Oh, dear, no. Poor dear old  Uncle Aubrey! Why, the darling old soul hasn't a penny to bless  himself with, except his pension. He's a retired post captain.\"  And she laughed melodiously. She was a charming woman.    \"Then I should disregard Uncle Aubrey's feelings,\" Sir Charles  said decisively.    \"No, no,\" the curate answered. \"Poor dear old Uncle Aubrey! I  wouldn't do anything for the world to annoy him. And he'd be sure  to notice it.\"    We went back to Amelia. \"Well, have you got them?\" she asked.    \"No,\" Sir Charles answered. \"Not yet. But he's coming round, I  think. He's hesitating now. Would rather like to sell them himself,  but is afraid what 'Uncle Aubrey' would say about the matter. His  wife will talk him out of his needless consideration for Uncle  Aubrey's feelings; and to-morrow we'll finally clench the bargain.\"    Next morning we stayed late in our salon, where we always  breakfasted, and did not come down to the public rooms till just  before dejeuner, Sir Charles being busy with me over arrears of  correspondence. When we _did_ come down the concierge stepped  forward with a twisted little feminine note for Amelia. She took  it and read it. Her countenance fell. \"There, Charles,\" she cried,  handing it to him, \"you've let the chance slip. I shall _never_ be  happy now! They've gone off with the diamonds.\"    Charles seized the note and read it. Then he passed it on to me.  It was short, but final:--      \"Thursday, 6 a.m.    \"DEAR LADY VANDRIFT--_Will_ you kindly excuse our having gone off  hurriedly without bidding you good-bye? We have just had a horrid  telegram to say that Dick's favourite sister is _dangerously_ ill of  fever in Paris. I wanted to shake hands with you before we left--you  have all been so sweet to us--but we go by the morning train,  absurdly early, and I wouldn't for worlds disturb you. Perhaps some  day we may meet again--though, buried as we are in a North-country  village, it isn't likely; but in any case, you have secured the  grateful recollection of Yours very cordially, JESSIE BRABAZON.    \"P.S.--Kindest regards to Sir Charles and those _dear_ Wentworths,  and a kiss for yourself, if I may venture to send you one.\"      \"She doesn't even mention where they've gone,\" Amelia exclaimed,  in a very bad humour.    \"The concierge may know,\" Isabel suggested, looking over my  shoulder.    We asked at his office.    Yes, the gentleman's address was the Rev. Richard Peploe Brabazon,  Holme Bush Cottage, Empingham, Northumberland.    Any address where letters might be sent at once, in Paris?    For the next ten days, or till further notice, Hotel des Deux  Mondes, Avenue de l'Opera.    Amelia's mind was made up at once.    \"Strike while the iron's hot,\" she cried. \"This sudden illness,  coming at the end of their honeymoon, and involving ten days' more  stay at an expensive hotel, will probably upset the curate's budget.  He'll be glad to sell now. You'll get them for three hundred. It  was absurd of Charles to offer so much at first; but offered once,  of course we must stick to it.\"    \"What do you propose to do?\" Charles asked. \"Write, or telegraph?\"    \"Oh, how silly men are!\" Amelia cried. \"Is this the sort of business  to be arranged by letter, still less by telegram? No. Seymour must  start off at once, taking the night train to Paris; and the moment  he gets there, he must interview the curate or Mrs. Brabazon. Mrs.  Brabazon's the best. She has none of this stupid, sentimental  nonsense about Uncle Aubrey.\"    It is no part of a secretary's duties to act as a diamond broker.  But when Amelia puts her foot down, she puts her foot down--a fact  which she is unnecessarily fond of emphasising in that identical  proposition. So the self-same evening saw me safe in the train on  my way to Paris; and next morning I turned out of my comfortable  sleeping-car at the Gare de Strasbourg. My orders were to bring back  those diamonds, alive or dead, so to speak, in my pocket to Lucerne;  and to offer any needful sum, up to two thousand five hundred  pounds, for their immediate purchase.    When I arrived at the Deux Mondes I found the poor little curate  and his wife both greatly agitated. They had sat up all night, they  said, with their invalid sister; and the sleeplessness and suspense  had certainly told upon them after their long railway journey. They  were pale and tired, Mrs. Brabazon, in particular, looking ill and  worried--too much like White Heather. I was more than half ashamed  of bothering them about the diamonds at such a moment, but it  occurred to me that Amelia was probably right--they would now have  reached the end of the sum set apart for their Continental trip,  and a little ready cash might be far from unwelcome.    I broached the subject delicately. It was a fad of Lady Vandrift's,  I said. She had set her heart upon those useless trinkets. And she  wouldn't go without them. She must and would have them. But the  curate was obdurate. He threw Uncle Aubrey still in my teeth. Three  hundred?--no, never! A mother's present; impossible, dear Jessie!  Jessie begged and prayed; she had grown really attached to Lady  Vandrift, she said; but the curate wouldn't hear of it. I went up  tentatively to four hundred. He shook his head gloomily. It wasn't  a question of money, he said. It was a question of affection. I saw  it was no use trying that tack any longer. I struck out a new line.  \"These stones,\" I said, \"I think I ought to inform you, are really  diamonds. Sir Charles is certain of it. Now, is it right for a man  of your profession and position to be wearing a pair of big gems  like those, worth several hundred pounds, as ordinary sleeve-links?  A woman?--yes, I grant you. But for a man, is it manly? And you a  cricketer!\"    He looked at me and laughed. \"Will nothing convince you?\" he cried.  \"They have been examined and tested by half a dozen jewellers, and  we know them to be paste. It wouldn't be right of me to sell them  to you under false pretences, however unwilling on my side. I  _couldn't_ do it.\"    \"Well, then,\" I said, going up a bit in my bids to meet him,  \"I'll put it like this. These gems are paste. But Lady Vandrift  has an unconquerable and unaccountable desire to possess them.  Money doesn't matter to her. She is a friend of your wife's. As a  personal favour, won't you sell them to her for a thousand?\"    He shook his head. \"It would be wrong,\" he said,--\"I might even add,  criminal.\"    \"But we take all risk,\" I cried.    He was absolute adamant. \"As a clergyman,\" he answered, \"I feel  I cannot do it.\"    \"Will _you_ try, Mrs. Brabazon?\" I asked.    The pretty little Scotchwoman leant over and whispered. She coaxed  and cajoled him. Her ways were winsome. I couldn't hear what she  said, but he seemed to give way at last. \"I should love Lady  Vandrift to have them,\" she murmured, turning to me. \"She _is_ such  a dear!\" And she took out the links from her husband's cuffs and  handed them across to me.    \"How much?\" I asked.    \"Two thousand?\" she answered, interrogatively. It was a big rise,  all at once; but such are the ways of women.    \"Done!\" I replied. \"Do you consent?\"    The curate looked up as if ashamed of himself.    \"I consent,\" he said slowly, \"since Jessie wishes it. But as a  clergyman, and to prevent any future misunderstanding, I should  like you to give me a statement in writing that you buy them on my  distinct and positive declaration that they are made of paste--old  Oriental paste--not genuine stones, and that I do not claim any  other qualities for them.\"    I popped the gems into my purse, well pleased.    \"Certainly,\" I said, pulling out a paper. Charles, with his  unerring business instinct, had anticipated the request, and given  me a signed agreement to that effect.    \"You will take a cheque?\" I inquired.    He hesitated.    \"Notes of the Bank of France would suit me better,\" he answered.    \"Very well,\" I replied. \"I will go out and get them.\"    How very unsuspicious some people are!"]]]
