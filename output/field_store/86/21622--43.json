The climate of the country surrounding the southern end of  the Gulf of Carpentaria is very hot and trying from November to March,  but genial thenceforward. It is certainly not unhealthy, and the  fevers suffered from in the northern and gulf districts of Queensland  are largely brought on by reckless or needless exposure.    In addition to the foregoing, which has been obtained from head-quarters,  certain questions were submitted by me as to the climatology  of the different colonies. As it will be seen, these interrogations are  somewhat extensive in their scope, and supply knowledge upon points,  which is not ordinarily met with in my descriptions of Australian  climate. In drafting them everything which had a bearing on health was  included as far as possible, and consequently in a work of this kind  they unquestionably deserve a prominent place. In arranging them I  purpose placing the different replies after each question in the  following order, namely, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia,  and Queensland. And in the different answers it should be borne in mind  that Mr. H.C. Russell is responsible for New South Wales; Mr. R.L.J.  Ellery for Victoria; Sir Charles Todd for South Australia; and Mr.  Clement L. Wragge for Queensland.    IS IT NOT A FACT THAT THE TEMPERATURE AND BAROMETRIC PRESSURE ARE  EXPOSED TO SUDDEN AND MARKED CHANGES? HAVE YOU KNOWN THE TEMPERATURE TO  FALL, SAY, AS MUCH AS 22 DEGREES IN 15 MINUTES?    New South Wales.--The temperature sometimes changes rapidly in the  summer, coming with a change from a hot wind to a cold southerly,  although the instances are rare. Once in 30 years I have known such a  change to amount to 20 degrees in 15 minutes. Under ordinary circumstances  the change in temperature from hot to cold wind takes several hours to  amount to 20 degrees. The fluctuations of barometric pressure are  moderate, seldom amounting to half an inch in a day, or an inch in a week.  In England, on the other hand, the pressure sometimes varies quickly to  the extent of two inches.    Victoria.--Yes; the temperature much more so than the barometric  pressure; it has fallen from a high temperature to 20 and even 30  degrees sometimes in as many minutes, when a hot north wind has  suddenly changed to a cold southerly one. But such sudden and great  changes occur very seldom, and then only in the hot summer months, and  are known as \"the change.\" On several occasions in the last 30 years it  has fallen from 105 degrees in the shade to 70 degrees and 65 degrees in  the shade in less than an hour.    South Australia.--Yes, in the summer; but, especially as regards  temperature, rarely in the winter. One notable example occurred on  February 9th, 1887, when during a heavy thunder-storm the temperature  fell 25 degrees in 10 or 15 minutes, followed by a rising temperature. In  other instances the fall of temperature has been almost equally rapid.  From this it will be seen that we are subject to large and quick falls  of temperature following extreme heat. The approach of hot weather is  usually gradual, and the fall abrupt. The barometer has been known to  show a rise of 6/10 of an inch in 24 hours; this, however, is  exceptional.    Queensland.--There is no record of a fall of as much as 22 degrees in 15  minutes. But, on the other hand, a rise of 30 degrees in three hours is a  common feature over the Darling Downs after sunrise. Owing to the  diathermancy of the atmosphere already referred to, it is a fact,  nevertheless, that in the \"continental\" or inland districts of  Southern Queensland the temperature in winter is subject to sudden and  marked changes. Barometric pressure, owing to the comparatively low  latitude, is not exposed to sudden and marked changes, except during  hurricane conditions, which usually affect the central coast-line in  February and March.    AS A COROLLARY TO THE PRECEDING, WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE CLIMATE  IS MARKED BY GREAT VARIABILITY?    New South Wales.--No; just the opposite. Indeed, as regards Sydney  itself. there are few cities in which so much uniformity of temperature  and slow changes, are to be found. The cause of any great change is the  hot wind, and as that seldom comes more than three or four times in the  year, great changes are infrequent. The mean diurnal range in Sydney is  11 1/2  degrees, and taking a series of years it is very unusual for the  range on any day to reach 25 degrees.    Victoria.--No; because these are exceptional phenomena. In the late  Spring and during early summer the climate may be said to be  occasionally subject to sharp and sudden changes, which give it the  character of variability. But the deviations from mean temperature,  except for short periods, are not remarkable.    South Australia.--Yes, in summer; but not in winter.    Queensland.--Certainly not; with the exception of the wide diurnal  range of temperature in winter in the southern \"continental\" districts,  as at Cambooya and Thargomindah. The changes are, according to my  knowledge, far more sudden and marked in the southern colonies (as  during a \"shift\" from N.E. by W., to S.W. for instance, at Melbourne,  and especially at Adelaide) than in Queensland and its coastal  districts.    WITH REGARD TO SUSTAINED, PROLONGED, OR CONTINUED HIGH TEMPERATURES  DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS, FOR HOW MANY DAYS HAVE YOU KNOWN THE  TEMPERATURE REMAIN CONTINUOUSLY AT A HIGH LEVEL? THIS IS A VERY  IMPORTANT QUESTION, AS IT CONCERNS INFANTILE MORTALITY IN NO SMALL  DEGREE; I SHALL BE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR EXPERIENCE?    New South Wales.--Much depends upon what temperature is deemed a \"high  level.\" If we assume that 90 degrees and upwards is a high level, then  such periods are very rare in Sydney; in fact during the past 24 years  there have only been three. In 1868 there were three consecutive hot  days of which the mean temperature was 91.8 degrees; in 1870 a period of  four days with a mean temperature of 91.3 degrees; and in 1874 a period of  four days with a mean temperature of 90.2 degrees. Since then, although  sometimes near it, the temperature has never been for three days over 90  degrees. Taking a lower level, we have one period of nine days in 1870,  the longest on record, during which the mean temperature was 82.6 degrees.  It must, however, be distinctly understood that what is here taken is not  the mean temperature of each 24 hours, but the highest temperature  reached during the day, and which would not as a rule last more than  three or four hours, if so much. If the mean temperature of the day  were taken these temperatures, as given, would have to be reduced at  least 10 per cent.    Victoria.--It is very unusual to have a hot period lasting more than  three days; when it does happen it is generally in February or March.  In the majority of cases high temperatures (over 90 degrees) do not last  more than one or two days. The exceptions generally occur in February or  March, and have sometimes extended to four or five days hot weather,  with a temperature of over 80 degrees with a maximum of about 90 degrees,  has on a few occasions during the last 30 years extended from five to ten  days; and in 1890, a memorable instance, to 12 days (the only case for 37  years).    South Australia.--The longest stretch of continuous heat noted was in  January and February 1857. On January 28th, 29th, and 30th, the  temperature exceeded 100 degrees, and during the whole of February it was  over 90 degrees on 25 days, and above 100 degrees on 12 days, the mean  being 107 degrees. In January 1858 there were 10 consecutive days over 90  degrees, of which eight consecutive days were over 100 degrees. In January  1860 there were in the beginning of the month seven consecutive days,  above 100 degrees (maximum 107.5 degrees). In the middle of the same  month, seven days were over 90 degrees, of which five exceeded 100  degrees, two days reaching 113.7 degrees. These are, however, exceptions  to our usual experience. Although there are several other instances of  great heat, yet the foregoing will suffice to show what we occasionally  suffer without much harm being done.    Queensland.--During the period February 17th to February 23rd, 1891,  the shade temperature at Townsville ranged between 81 degrees and 62  degrees, but at Cairns a range between 82  degrees and 70 degrees is of  frequent occurrence, within at least fortnightly periods.    ANY INFORMATION WITH REGARD TO HUMIDITY OF THE ATMOSPHERE ALSO, WILL BE  OF GREAT VALUE. ALL PHYSICIANS ARE OF OPINION THAT A HIGH TEMPERATURE,  COMBINED WITH MOISTURE, IS VERY IRRITATING TO THE LUNGS OF THOSE  AFFECTED WITH PULMONARY DISEASE.    Before setting forth the different answers in response to this, it will  be desirable to refer briefly to the term \"humidity.\" The humidity of  the atmosphere is defined as the degree of its approach to saturation.  Air completely saturated is represented by 100, and that absolutely  free of vapour by 0. As a matter of fact, however, the latter never  occurs; even in the driest regions of Arabia a humidity of 10 per cent.  is almost unknown. For its estimation the Wet and Dry Bulb thermometers  are employed. These consist of two ordinary thermometers. One has its  bulb exposed so as to register the temperature of the air. The bulb of  the other is covered with muslin; this latter material being kept wet  through its connection with a cotton wick dipping into a vessel of  water. The water ascends from this vessel by capillary attraction,  spreads over the muslin, and evaporates quickly or slowly,  according to the dryness or moistness of the atmosphere. Thus when the  air is driest the difference between the two thermometers will be  greatest, and, on the contrary, when it is completely saturated with  moisture the two readings will be almost identical.

[28] Micah iv, 1-2.    =25.= The bringing forth of the Book of Mormon is held by the  Latter-day Saints to be a direct fulfilment of prophecy.[29] In  predicting the humiliation of Israel, to whom had been committed the  power of the priesthood in early days, Isaiah gave voice to the word  of the Lord in this wise:--\"And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt  speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust,  and thy voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of  the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.\"[30] The  Book of Mormon is verily the voice of a people brought low, speaking  from the dust, for from the dust the book was literally taken. The  volume professes to be the history of but a small division of the  house of Israel,--a part of the family of Joseph indeed, who were led  by a miraculous power to the western continent six centuries prior to  the Christian era. Of the record of Joseph, and its coming forth as a  parallel testimony to that of Judah, or the Bible in part, the Lord  thus spake through the prophet Ezekiel:--\"Moreover, thou son of man,  take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the  children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write  upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of  Israel his companions: And join them one to another into one stick;  and they shall become one in thine hand. And when the children of thy  people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not show us what thou  meanest by these? Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I  will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and  the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even  with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be  one in mine hand.\"[31] The succeeding verses declare that the  gathering and restoration of Israel would immediately follow the  united testimony of the records of Judah and Joseph. The two records  are before the world, a unit in their testimony of the everlasting  Gospel; and the work of gathering is in effective progress.      [29] See Lectures on \"Book of Mormon,\" Article 8, pp. 261-307.      [30] Isa. xxix, 4; see also II Nephi iii, 19.      [31] Ezek. xxxvii, 16-19.    =26.= It is further evident from the scriptures, that the dispensation  of the Gospel in the latter days is to be one of restoration and  restitution, a \"dispensation of the fulness of times\" in very truth.  Paul declares it to be the good pleasure of the Lord, \"That in the  dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one  all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on  earth; even in him.\"[32] This prediction finds a parallel in an  utterance of the prophet Nephi:--\"Wherefore all things which have been  revealed unto the children of men, shall at that day be revealed.\"[33]  And in accord with this is the teaching of Peter: \"Repent ye  therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when  the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; And  he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: Whom  the heavens must receive until the times of restitution of all things,  which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the  world began.\"[34] Now comes Joseph Smith with the declaration that  unto him has been given the authority to open up this, the  dispensation of fulness, restitution, and restoration; and that  through him the Church has been endowed with all the keys and powers  of the priesthood, held and exercised in earlier periods: Unto the  Church \"is the power of this priesthood given, for the last days, and  for the last time, in the which is the dispensation of the fulness of  times, which power you hold in connection with all those who have  received a dispensation at any time from the beginning of  creation.\"[35] The actual possession of these combined and unified  powers is sufficiently proved by the comprehensive work of the Church  in its present scope of operation.      [32] Eph. i, 9-10.      [33] II Nephi xxx, 18.      [34] Acts iii, 19-21.      [35] Doc. & Cov. cxii, 30-32.    =27. II. Joseph Smith's Authority= was conferred upon him by direct  ministrations of heavenly beings, each of whom had once exercised the  same power upon the earth. We have already seen how the angel Moroni,  formerly a mortal prophet among the Nephites, transmitted to Joseph  the appointment to bring forth the record which he, Moroni, had buried  in the earth over fourteen hundred years before. We learn further,  that on the 15th of May, 1829, the lesser or Aaronic Priesthood was  conferred upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery by the hand of John the  Baptist,[36] who came in his immortalized state with that particular  order of priesthood which comprises the keys of the ministrations of  angels, the doctrine of repentance and of baptism for the remission of  sins. This was the same John who, with the voice of one crying in the  wilderness, had preached the self-same doctrine, and had administered  the same ordinance in Judea as the immediate forerunner of the  Messiah. In delivering his message, John the Baptist stated that he  was acting under the direction of Peter, James, and John, apostles of  the Lord, in whose hands reposed the keys of the higher or Melchizedek  Priesthood, which in time would also be given. This promise was  fulfilled a month or so later, when the apostles named manifested  themselves to Joseph and Oliver, ordaining them to the apostleship,[37]  which comprises all the offices of the higher order of priesthood,  and which carries authority to minister in all the established  ordinances of the Gospel.      [36] Doc. & Cov. xiii.      [37] Doc. & Cov. xxvii, 12.    =28.= Then, some time after the Church had been duly organized,  authority for certain special functions was given, the appointing  messenger being in each case the one whose right it was so to  officiate by virtue of the commission which he had held in the days of  his mortality. Thus, as has been seen, Moses conferred the authority  to prosecute the work of gathering; and Elijah, who, not having tasted  death, held a peculiar relation to both the living and the dead,  delivered the authority of vicarious ministry for the departed. To  these appointments by heavenly authority should be added that given by  Elias, who appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, and \"committed  the dispensation of the gospel of Abraham,\" saying as was said of the  Father of the Faithful and his descendants in olden times, that in  them and in their seed should all succeeding generations be  blessed.[38]      [38] Doc. & Cov. cx, 12.    =29.= It is evident, then, that the claims made by the Church with  respect to its authority are complete and consistent as to the source  of the powers professed, and the channels through which such have been  delivered again to earth. Scripture and revelation, both ancient and  modern, support as an unalterable law the principle that no one can  delegate to another an authority which the giver does not possess.    =30. III. Joseph Smith was himself a true Prophet.=--This statement,  if fully substantiated, would be of itself sufficient proof of the  validity of the claims of this modern prophet, and the test is not  difficult of application. In the days of ancient Israel, an effective  method of trying the claims of a professed prophet was prescribed:--  \"When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow  not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not  spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously; thou shalt not  be afraid of him.\"[39] Conversely, if the words of the prophet are  made good by fulfilment, there is at least proof presumptive of his  genuineness. Of the many predictions uttered by Joseph Smith and  already fulfilled or awaiting the set time of their realization, a few  citations will suffice for our present purpose.      [39] Deut. xviii, 22.    =31.= One of the earliest prophecies declared by him, which, while not  his independent utterance but that of the angel Moroni, was  nevertheless given to the world by Joseph Smith, had special reference  to the Book of Mormon, of which the angel said: \"The knowledge that  this record contains will go to every nation, and kindred, and tongue,  and people, under the whole heaven.\"[40] This declaration was made  four years before the work of translation was begun, and fourteen  years before the elders of the Church began their missionary labor in  foreign lands. Since that time the Book of Mormon has been translated  into seventeen foreign languages, and is published in fifteen tongues;  and the work is still in progress.      [40] Times and Seasons, Vol. II, No. 13.    =32.= In August, 1842, while the Church was suffering persecution in  Illinois, and when the western part of the continent was but little  known and only as the territory of an alien nation, Joseph Smith  prophesied \"that the Saints would continue to suffer much affliction,  and would be driven to the Rocky Mountains,\" and that while many then  professing allegiance to the Church would apostatize, and others,  faithful to their testimony, would meet the martyr's fate, some would  live to \"assist in making settlements and build cities and see the  Saints become a mighty people in the midst of the Rocky  Mountains.\"[41] The literal fulfilment of this prediction, uttered in  1842, and it may be added, foreshadowed by an earlier prophecy in  1831,[42] the one five, the other sixteen years before the migration  of the Church to the West, is attested by the common history of the  settlement and development of this once inhospitable region.
