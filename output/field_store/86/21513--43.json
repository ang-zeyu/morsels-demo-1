[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/348"],[0,"Hesiod, the Homeric Hymns, and Homerica (#6)"],[1,"that a date in the  earlier part of the sixth century is most probable.    The \"Hymn to Aphrodite\" is not the least remarkable, from a literary  point of view, of the whole collection, exhibiting as it does in  a masterly manner a divine being as the unwilling victim of an  irresistible force. It tells how all creatures, and even the gods  themselves, are subject to the will of Aphrodite, saving only Artemis,  Athena, and Hestia; how Zeus to humble her pride of power caused her to  love a mortal, Anchises; and how the goddess visited the hero upon Mt.  Ida. A comparison of this work with the Lay of Demodocus (\"Odyssey\"  viii, 266 ff.), which is superficially similar, will show how far  superior is the former in which the goddess is but a victim to forces  stronger than herself. The lines (247-255) in which Aphrodite tells of  her humiliation and grief are specially noteworthy.    There are only general indications of date. The influence of Hesiod is  clear, and the hymn has almost certainly been used by the author of the  \"Hymn to Demeter\", so that the date must lie between these two periods,  and the seventh century seems to be the latest date possible.    The \"Hymn to Dionysus\" relates how the god was seized by pirates and how  with many manifestations of power he avenged himself on them by turning  them into dolphins. The date is widely disputed, for while Ludwich  believes it to be a work of the fourth or third century, Allen and Sikes  consider a sixth or seventh century date to be possible. The story is  figured in a different form on the reliefs from the choragic monument of  Lysicrates, now in the British Museum [1117].    Very different in character is the \"Hymn to Ares\", which is Orphic  in character. The writer, after lauding the god by detailing his  attributes, prays to be delivered from feebleness and weakness of soul,  as also from impulses to wanton and brutal violence.    The only other considerable hymn is that to \"Pan\", which describes how  he roams hunting among the mountains and thickets and streams, how he  makes music at dusk while returning from the chase, and how he joins in  dancing with the nymphs who sing the story of his birth. This, beyond  most works of Greek literature, is remarkable for its fresh and  spontaneous love of wild natural scenes.    The remaining hymns are mostly of the briefest compass, merely hailing  the god to be celebrated and mentioning his chief attributes. The Hymns  to \"Hermes\" (xviii), to the \"Dioscuri\" (xvii), and to \"Demeter\" (xiii)  are mere abstracts of the longer hymns iv, xxxiii, and ii.          The Epigrams of Homer    The \"Epigrams of Homer\" are derived from the pseudo-Herodotean \"Life of  Homer\", but many of them occur in other documents such as the \"Contest  of Homer and Hesiod\", or are quoted by various ancient authors. These  poetic fragments clearly antedate the \"Life\" itself, which seems to have  been so written round them as to supply appropriate occasions for their  composition. Epigram iii on Midas of Larissa was otherwise attributed to  Cleobulus of Lindus, one of the Seven Sages; the address to Glaucus (xi)  is purely Hesiodic; xiii, according to MM. Croiset, is a fragment from a  gnomic poem. Epigram xiv is a curious poem attributed on no very obvious  grounds to Hesiod by Julius Pollox. In it the poet invokes Athena to  protect certain potters and their craft, if they will, according to  promise, give him a reward for his song; if they prove false, malignant  gnomes are invoked to wreck the kiln and hurt the potters.          The Burlesque Poems    To Homer were popularly ascribed certain burlesque poems in which  Aristotle (\"Poetics\" iv) saw the germ of comedy. Most interesting of  these, were it extant, would be the \"Margites\". The hero of the epic is  at once sciolist and simpleton, 'knowing many things, but knowing them  all badly'. It is unfortunately impossible to trace the plan of  the poem, which presumably detailed the adventures of this unheroic  character: the metre used was a curious mixture of hexametric and iambic  lines. The date of such a work cannot be high: Croiset thinks it may  belong to the period of Archilochus (c. 650 B.C.), but it may well be  somewhat later.    Another poem, of which we know even less, is the \"Cercopes\". These  Cercopes ('Monkey-Men') were a pair of malignant dwarfs who went about  the world mischief-making. Their punishment by Heracles is represented  on one of the earlier metopes from Selinus. It would be idle to  speculate as to the date of this work.    Finally there is the \"Battle of the Frogs and Mice\". Here is told the  story of the quarrel which arose between the two tribes, and how they  fought, until Zeus sent crabs to break up the battle. It is a parody  of the warlike epic, but has little in it that is really comic or of  literary merit, except perhaps the list of quaint arms assumed by the  warriors. The text of the poem is in a chaotic condition, and there are  many interpolations, some of Byzantine date.    Though popularly ascribed to Homer, its real author is said by Suidas  to have been Pigres, a Carian, brother of Artemisia, 'wife of Mausonis',  who distinguished herself at the battle of Salamis.    Suidas is confusing the two Artemisias, but he may be right in  attributing the poem to about 480 B.C.          The Contest of Homer and Hesiod    This curious work dates in its present form from the lifetime or shortly  after the death of Hadrian, but seems to be based in part on an earlier  version by the sophist Alcidamas (c. 400 B.C.). Plutarch (\"Conviv. Sept.  Sap.\", 40) uses an earlier (or at least a shorter) version than that  which we possess [1118]. The extant \"Contest\", however, has clearly  combined with the original document much other ill-digested matter on  the life and descent of Homer, probably drawing on the same general  sources as does the Herodotean \"Life of Homer\". Its scope is as follows:  1) the descent (as variously reported) and relative dates of Homer and  Hesiod; 2) their poetical contest at Chalcis; 3) the death of Hesiod;  4) the wanderings and fortunes of Homer, with brief notices of the  circumstances under which his reputed works were composed, down to the  time of his death.    The whole tract is, of course, mere romance; its only values are 1)  the insight it give into ancient speculations about Homer; 2) a certain  amount of definite information about the Cyclic poems; and 3) the epic  fragments included in the stichomythia of the \"Contest\" proper, many of  which--did we possess the clue--would have to be referred to poems of  the Epic Cycle.          BIBLIOGRAPHY    HESIOD.--The classification and numerations of MSS. here followed is  that of Rzach (1913). It is only necessary to add that on the whole  the recovery of Hesiodic papyri goes to confirm the authority of the  mediaeval MSS. At the same time these fragments have produced much that  is interesting and valuable, such as the new lines, \"Works and Days\"  169 a-d, and the improved readings ib. 278, \"Theogony\" 91, 93.

And thus we may safely leave to  ethnologists the task of deciding whether the whole human race descends  from one original couple or from many; for, spiritually speaking,  humanity in any case is one. It is one same spirit that animates it and  is developed in it; and this, the incontestable unity of our race, is  likewise the only unity we need care to insist on. Let us recognize it,  then, since indeed it imposes itself upon us, and let us confess that  the gospel did but anticipate the last word of science in proclaiming  universal fraternity.    And here, Gentlemen, we reach one of those grand generalizations which  must finally win over even those who are still inclined to distrust the  philosophical history of religions as a study that destroys the most  precious possessions of humanity. In setting forth the intellectual and  moral unity of mankind, everywhere directed by the same successive  evolutions and the same spiritual laws, it brings into light the great  principle of _human brotherhood_. In demonstrating that these  evolutions, in spite of all the influences of ignorance, of selfishness  and of grossness, converge towards a sublime, ideal goal, and are no  other than the mysterious but mighty and unbroken attraction to that  unfathomable Power of which the universe is the visible expression, it  founds on a basis of reason the august sentiment of the _divine  fatherhood_. Brother-men and one Father-God!--what more does the thinker  need to raise the dignity of our nature, the promises of the future, the  sublimity of our destiny, into a region where the inconstant waves of a  superficial criticism can never reach them? Such is the vestibule of the  eternal Temple; and in approaching the sanctuary--albeit I may not know  the very title by which best to call the Deity who reigns in it--I bow  my head with that union of humility and of filial trust which  constitutes the pure essence of religion.    But from these general considerations we must return to our more  immediate subject. At our next meeting, Gentlemen, we are to study the  special beliefs and mythology of ancient Mexico.          LECTURE II.    THE DEITIES AND MYTHS OF MEXICO.      LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,    It will be my task to-day to give an account of the Mexican mythology  and religion, resting as it does on the foundation common to the peoples  of Central America, but inspired by the sombre, utilitarian,  matter-of-fact, yet vigorous and earnest, genius of the Aztecs. You will  remember that this name belongs to the warlike and commercial people  that enjoyed, at the beginning of the sixteenth century, a military and  political supremacy in the region that is now called Mexico, after the  Aztec capital of that name.      I.    To begin with, we must note that the ancient Central-American cultus of  the Sun and Moon, considered as the two supreme deities, was by no  means renounced by the Aztecs. Ometecutli (i.e. _twice Lord_) and  Omecihuatl (_twice Lady_), or in other words supreme Lord and Lady, are  the designations under which they are always indicated in the first rank  in the religious formulae. All the Mexicans called themselves \"children  of the Sun,\" and greeted him every morning with hymns and with trumpet  peals, accompanied with offerings. Four times by day and four times by  night, priests who were attached to the various temples addressed their  devotions to him. And yet he had no temple specially consecrated to him.  The fact was that all temples were really his, much as in our own  Christian civilization all the churches are raised in honour of God,  though particular designations are severally given to them. The Sun was  the _teotl_ (i.e. the god) _par excellence_. I am informed that to this  very day the inhabitants of secluded parts of Mexico, as they go to  mass, throw a kiss to the sun before entering the church.    Notwithstanding all this, we have to observe that, by an inconsistency  which again has its analogies in other religions, the cultus of the  supreme deity and his consort was pretty much effaced in the popular  devotions and practices by that of divinities who were perhaps less  august, and in some cases were even derived from the substance of the  supreme deity himself, but in any case seemed to stand nearer to  humanity than he did. More especially, the national deities of the  Aztecs, the guardians of their empire, whose worship they instituted  wherever their arms had triumphed, practically took the first place. It  is with these national deities that we are now to make acquaintance, and  we cannot do better than begin with the two great deities of the city of  Mexico, whose colossal statues were enthroned on its principal temple.    But first we must form some notion of what a Mexican temple was.    The word \"temple,\" if held to imply an enclosed and covered building, is  very improperly applied to the kind of edifice in question. Indeed, a  Mexican temple (and the same may be said of most of the sanctuaries of  Central America) was essentially a gigantic altar, of pyramidal form,  built in several stages, contracting as they approached the summit. The  number of these retreating stories or terraces might vary. There were  never less than three, but there might be as many as five or six, and in  Tezcuco some of these quasi-pyramids even numbered nine. The one that  towered over all the rest in the city of Mexico was built in five  stages. It measured, at its base, about three hundred and seventy-five  feet in length and three hundred in width, and was over eighty feet  high. At a certain point in each terrace was the stair that sloped  across the side of the pyramid to the terrace above; but the successive  ascents were so arranged that it was necessary to make the complete  circuit of the edifice in order to mount from one stage to another, and  consequently the grand processions to which the Mexicans were so much  devoted must have encircled the whole edifice from top to bottom, like a  huge living serpent, before the van could reach the broad platform at  the top, and this must have added not a little to the picturesque effect  of these religious ceremonies. Such an erection was called a _teocalli_  or \"abode of the gods.\" The great teocalli of Mexico commanded the four  chief roads that parted from its base to unite the capital to all the  countries beneath the sceptre of its rulers. It was the palladium of the  empire, and, as at Jerusalem, it was the last refuge of the defenders of  the national independence.    The teocalli which Fernando Cortes and his companions saw at Mexico, and  which the conqueror razed to the ground, to replace it by a Catholic  church, was not of any great antiquity. It had been constructed  thirty-four years before, in the place of another much smaller one that  dated from the time when the Aztecs were but an insignificant tribe; and  it seems that frightful human hecatombs had ensanguined the foundations  of this more recent teocalli. Some authorities speak of seventy-two or  eighty thousand victims, while more moderate calculations reduce the  number to twenty thousand, which is surely terrible enough. In front of  the temple there stretched a spacious court some twelve hundred feet  square. All around were smaller buildings, which served as habitations  for the priests, and store-houses for the apparatus of worship, as well  as arsenals, oratories for the sovereign and the grandees of the  empire, chapels for the inferior deities and so on. Amongst these  buildings was the temple in which, as I have said, the gods of the  conquered peoples were literally imprisoned. In another the Spaniards  could count a hundred and thirty-six thousand symmetrically-piled  skulls. They were the skulls of all the victims that had been sacrificed  since the foundation of the sanctuary. And, by a contrast no less than  monstrous, side by side with this monument of the most atrocious  barbarism there were halls devoted to the care of the poor and sick, who  were tended gratuitously by priests.[7] What a tissue of contradictions  is man!    But the Aztec religion does not allow us to dwell upon the note of  tenderness. In the centre of the broad platform at the summit stood the  _stone of sacrifices_, a monolith about three feet high, slightly ridged  on the surface. Upon this stone the victim was stretched supine, and  while sundry subordinate priests held his head, arms and feet, the  sacrificing pontiff raised a heavy knife, laid open his bosom with one  terrific blow, and tore out his heart to offer it all bleeding and  palpitating to the deity in whose honour the sacrifice was performed.  And here you will recognize that idea, so widely spread in the two  Americas, and indeed almost everywhere amongst uncivilized peoples, that  the heart is the epitome, so to speak, of the individual--his soul in  some sense--so that to appropriate his heart is to appropriate his whole  being.    Finally, there rose on the same platform a kind of chapel in which were  enthroned the two chief deities of the Aztecs, Uitzilopochtli and  Tezcatlipoca.[8] And here I will ask you to accompany Captain Bernal  Diaz in the retinue of his chief, Fernando Cortes, to whom the king  Montezuma himself had seen fit to do the honours of his \"cathedral.\"  For, as you are aware, Montezuma, divided between a rash confidence and  certain apprehensions which I shall presently explain, received Cortes  for a considerable time with the utmost distinction, lodged him in one  of his palaces, and did everything in the world to please him. This,  then, is the narrative of Bernal Diaz:[9]        \"Montezuma invited us to enter a little tower, where in a kind      of chamber, or hall, stood what appeared like two altars covered      with rich embroidery.\" (What Bernal Diaz compared to altars were      the two _Teoicpalli_ (or _seats of the gods_), which were wooden      pedestals, painted azure blue and"]]]
