[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42243"],[0,"The Hour of the Dragon (#6)"],[1," wrenched out his steel with a racking gasp, and staggered back  against the tent-pole. His great limbs trembled, his chest heaved, and  sweat poured down his face and neck. But his eyes flamed with exultant  savagery and he panted: 'Why do you stand afar off, dog of Belverus? I  can't reach you; come in and die!'    Tarascus hesitated, glanced at the remaining man-at-arms, and his  squire, a gaunt, saturnine man in black mail, and took a step forward.  He was far inferior in size and strength to the giant Cimmerian, but he  was in full armor, and was famed in all the western nations as a  swordsman. But his squire caught his arm.    'Nay, your Majesty, do not throw away your life. I will summon archers  to shoot this barbarian, as we shoot lions.'    Neither of them had noticed that a chariot had approached while the  fight was going on, and now came to a halt before them. But Conan saw,  looking over their shoulders, and a queer chill sensation crawled along  his spine. There was something vaguely unnatural about the appearance of  the black horses that drew the vehicle, but it was the occupant of the  chariot that arrested the king's attention.    He was a tall man, superbly built, clad in a long unadorned silk robe.  He wore a Shemitish head-dress, and its lower folds hid his features,  except for the dark, magnetic eyes. The hands that grasped the reins,  pulling the rearing horses back on their haunches, were white but  strong. Conan glared at the stranger, all his primitive instincts  roused. He sensed an aura of menace and power that exuded from this  veiled figure, a menace as definite as the windless waving of tall grass  that marks the path of the serpent.    'Hail, Xaltotun!' exclaimed Tarascus. 'Here is the king of Aquilonia! He  did not die in the landslide as we thought.'    'I know,' answered the other, without bothering to say how he knew.  'What is your present intention?'    'I will summon the archers to slay him,' answered the Nemedian. 'As long  as he lives he will be dangerous to us.'    'Yet even a dog has uses,' answered Xaltotun. 'Take him alive.'    Conan laughed raspingly. 'Come in and try!' he challenged. 'But for my  treacherous legs I'd hew you out of that chariot like a woodman hewing a  tree. But you'll never take me alive, damn you!'    'He speaks the truth, I fear,' said Tarascus. 'The man is a barbarian,  with the senseless ferocity of a wounded tiger. Let me summon the  archers.'    'Watch me and learn wisdom,' advised Xaltotun.    His hand dipped into his robe and came out with something shining--a  glistening sphere. This he threw suddenly at Conan. The Cimmerian  contemptuously struck it aside with his sword--at the instant of contact  there was a sharp explosion, a flare of white, blinding flame, and Conan  pitched senseless to the ground.    'He is dead?' Tarascus' tone was more assertion than inquiry.    'No. He is but senseless. He will recover his senses in a few hours. Bid  your men bind his arms and legs and lift him into my chariot.'    With a gesture Tarascus did so, and they heaved the senseless king into  the chariot, grunting with their burden. Xaltotun threw a velvet cloak  over his body, completely covering him from any who might peer in. He  gathered the reins in his hands.    'I'm for Belverus,' he said. 'Tell Amalric that I will be with him if he  needs me. But with Conan out of the way, and his army broken, lance and  sword should suffice for the rest of the conquest. Prospero cannot be  bringing more than ten thousand men to the field, and will doubtless  fall back to Tarantia when he hears the news of the battle. Say nothing  to Amalric or Valerius or anyone about our capture. Let them think Conan  died in the fall of the cliffs.'    He looked at the man-at-arms for a long space, until the guardsman moved  restlessly, nervous under the scrutiny.    'What is that about your waist?' Xaltotun demanded.    'Why, my girdle, may it please you, my lord!' stuttered the amazed  guardsman.    'You lie!' Xaltotun's laugh was merciless as a sword-edge. 'It is a  poisonous serpent! What a fool you are, to wear a reptile about your  waist!'    With distended eyes the man looked down; and to his utter horror he saw  the buckle of his girdle rear up at him. It was a snake's head! He saw  the evil eyes and the dripping fangs, heard the hiss and felt the  loathsome contact of the thing about his body. He screamed hideously and  struck at it with his naked hand, felt its fangs flesh themselves in  that hand--and then he stiffened and fell heavily. Tarascus looked down  at him without expression. He saw only the leathern girdle and the  buckle, the pointed tongue of which was stuck in the guardsman's palm.  Xaltotun turned his hypnotic gaze on Tarascus' squire, and the man  turned ashen and began to tremble, but the king interposed: 'Nay, we can  trust him.'    The sorcerer tautened the reins and swung the horses around.    'See that this piece of work remains secret. If I am needed, let Altaro,  Orastes' servant, summon me as I have taught him. I will be in your  palace at Belverus.'    Tarascus lifted his hand in salutation, but his expression was not  pleasant to see as he looked after the departing mesmerist.    'Why should he spare the Cimmerian?' whispered the frightened squire.    'That I am wondering myself,' grunted Tarascus.    Behind the rumbling chariot the dull roar of battle and pursuit faded in  the distance; the setting sun rimmed the cliffs with scarlet flame, and  the chariot moved into the vast blue shadows floating up out of the  east.          4    'From What Hell Have You Crawled?'      Of that long ride in the chariot of Xaltotun, Conan knew nothing. He lay  like a dead man while the bronze wheels clashed over the stones of  mountain roads and swished through the deep grass of fertile valleys,  and finally dropping down from the rugged heights, rumbled rhythmically  along the broad white road that winds through the rich meadowlands to  the walls of Belverus.    Just before dawn some faint reviving of life touched him. He heard a  mumble of voices, the groan of ponderous hinges. Through a slit in the  cloak that covered him he saw, faintly in the lurid glare of torches,  the great black arch of a gateway, and the bearded faces of men-at-arms,  the torches striking fire from their spearheads and helmets.    'How went the battle, my fair lord?' spoke an eager voice, in the  Nemedian tongue.    'Well indeed,' was the curt reply. 'The king of Aquilonia lies slain and  his host is broken.'    A babble of excited voices rose, drowned the next instant by the  whirling wheels of the chariot on the flags. Sparks flashed from under  the revolving rims as Xaltotun lashed his steeds through the arch. But  Conan heard one of the guardsmen mutter: 'From beyond the border to  Belverus between sunset and dawn! And the horses scarcely sweating! By  Mitra, they--' Then silence drank the voices, and there was only the  clatter of hoofs and wheels along the shadowy street.    What he had heard registered itself on Conan's brain but suggested  nothing to him. He was like a mindless automaton that hears and sees,  but does not understand. Sights and sounds flowed meaninglessly about  him. He lapsed again into a deep lethargy, and was only dimly aware  when the chariot halted in a deep, high-walled court, and he was lifted  from it by many hands and borne up a winding stone stair, and down a  long dim corridor. Whispers, stealthy footsteps, unrelated sounds surged  or rustled about him, irrelevant and far away.    Yet his ultimate awakening was abrupt and crystal-clear. He possessed  full knowledge of the battle in the mountains and its sequences, and he  had a good idea of where he was.    He lay on a velvet couch, clad as he was the day before, but with his  limbs loaded with chains not even he could break. The room in which he  lay was furnished with somber magnificence, the walls covered with black  velvet tapestries, the floor with heavy purple carpets. There was no  sign of door or window, and one curiously carven gold lamp, swinging  from the fretted ceiling, shed a lurid light over all.    In that light the figure seated in a silver, throne-like chair before  him seemed unreal and fantastic, with an illusiveness of outline that  was heightened by a filmy silken robe. But the features were  distinct--unnaturally so in that uncertain light. It was almost as if a  weird nimbus played about the man's head, casting the bearded face into  bold relief, so that it was the only definite and distinct reality in  that mystic, ghostly chamber.    It was a magnificent face, with strongly chiseled features of classical  beauty. There was, indeed, something disquieting about the calm  tranquility of its aspect, a suggestion of more than human knowledge, of  a profound certitude beyond human assurance. Also an uneasy sensation of  familiarity twitched at the back of Conan's consciousness. He had never  seen this man's face before, he well knew; yet those features reminded  him of something or someone. It was like encountering in the flesh some  dream-image that had haunted one in nightmares.    'Who are you?' demanded the king belligerently, struggling to a sitting  position in spite of his chains.    'Men call me Xaltotun,' was the reply, in a strong, golden voice.    'What place is this?' the Cimmerian next demanded.    'A chamber in the palace of King Tarascus, in Belverus.'    Conan was not surprised. Belverus, the capital, was at the same time the  largest Nemedian city so near the border.    'And where's Tarascus?'    'With the army.'    'Well,' growled Conan, 'if you mean to murder me, why don't you do it  and get it over with?'    'I did not save you from the king's archers to murder you in Belverus,'  answered Xaltotun.    'What the devil did you do to me?' demanded Conan.    'I blasted your consciousness,' answered Xaltotun. 'How, you would not  understand. Call it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4227"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Wireless Message; Or, The Castaways of Earthquake Island (#6)"],[1,"\" said Mr. Jackson. \"He is  vol-planing back to earth!\"    Nearer and nearer came the BUTTERFLY. It would shoot downward, and  then, as Tom tilted the planes, would rise a bit, losing some of the  great momentum. In a series of maneuvers like this, the young  inventor reached the earth, not far from where his father and the  others stood. Down came the BUTTERFLY, the springs of the wheel  frame taking the shock wonderfully well.    \"She's all right--regular bird!\" cried Tom, in enthusiasm, when the  machine had come to a stop after rolling over the ground, and he had  leaped out. \"We'll make a good flight to-morrow, Mr. Damon, if the  weather holds out this way.\"    \"Good!\" cried the eccentric man. \"I shall be delighted.\"    They made the start early the next morning, there being hardly a  breath of wind. There was not a trace of nervousness noticeable  about Mr. Damon, as he took his place in the seat beside Tom. The  lad had gone carefully over the entire apparatus, and had seen to it  that, as far as he could tell, it was in perfect running order.    \"When will you be back, Tom?\" asked his father.    \"To-night, perhaps, or to-morrow morning. I don't know just what Mr.  Fenwick wants me to do. But if it is anything that requires a long  stay, I'll come back, and let you know, and then run down to  Philadelphia again. I may need some of my special tools to work  with. I'll be back to-night perhaps.\"    \"Shall I keep supper for you?\" asked Mrs. Baggert, the housekeeper.    \"I don't know,\" answered Tom, with a laugh. \"Perhaps I'll drop down  at Miss Nestor's, and have some apple turnovers,\" for he had told  them or the incident of hiring the new cook. \"Well,\" he went on to  Mr. Damon, \"are you all ready?\"    \"As ready as I ever shall be. Do you think we'll have to do any  vol-planing, Tom?\"    \"Hard to say, but it's not dangerous when there's no wind. All  right, Garret. Start her off.\"    The engineer whirled the big wooden, built-up propeller, and with a  rattle and roar of the motor, effectually drowning any but the  loudest shouts, the BUTTERFLY was ready for her flight. Tom let the  engine warm up a bit before calling to his friends to let go, and  then, when he had thrown the gasolene lever forward, he shouted a  good-by and cried:    \"All right! Let go!\"    Forward, like a hound from the leash, sprang the little monoplane.  It ran perhaps for five hundred feet, and then, with a tilting of  the wings, to set the air currents against them, it sprang into the  air.    \"We're off!\" cried Mr. Damon, waving his hand to those on the ground  below.    \"Yes, we're off,\" murmured Tom. \"Now for the Quaker City!\"    He had mapped out a route for himself the night before, and now,  picking out the land-marks, he laid as straight a course as possible  for Philadelphia.    The sensation of flying along, two thousand feet high, in a machine  almost as frail as a canoe, was not new to Tom. It was, in a degree,  to Mr. Damon, for, though the latter had made frequent trips in the  large airship, this mode of locomotion, as if he was on the back of  some bird, was much different. Still, after the first surprise, he  got used to it.    \"Bless my finger ring!\" he exclaimed, \"I like it!\"    \"I thought you would,\" said Tom, in a shout, and he adjusted the oil  feed to send more lubricant into the cylinders.    The earth stretched out below them, like some vari-colored relief  map, but they could not stop to admire any particular spot long, for  they were flying fast, and were beyond a scene almost as quickly as  they had a glimpse of it.    \"How long will it take us?\" yelled Mr. Damon into Tom's ear.    \"I hope to do it in three hours,\" shouted back the young inventor.    \"What! Why it takes the train over five hours.\"    \"Yes, I know, but we're going direct, and it's only about two  hundred and fifty miles. That's only about eighty an hour. We're  doing seventy-five now, and I haven't let her out yet.\"    \"She goes faster than the RED CLOUD,\" cried Mr. Damon.    Tom nodded. It was hard work to talk in that rush of air. For an  hour they shot along, their speed gradually increasing. Tom called  out the names of the larger places they passed over. He was now  doing better than eighty an hour as the gage showed. The trip was a  glorious one, and the eyes of the young inventor and his friend  sparkled in delight as they rushed forward. Two hours passed.    \"Going to make it?\" fairly howled Mr. Damon.    Tom nodded again.    \"Be there in time for dinner,\" he announced in a shout.    It lacked forty minutes of the three hours when Tom, pointing with  one hand down below, while with the other he gripped the lever of  the rudder, called:    \"North Philadelphia!\"    \"So soon?\" gasped Mr. Damon. \"Well, we certainly made speed! Where  are you going to land?\"    \"I don't know,\" answered the young inventor, \"I'll have to pick out  the best place I see. It's no fun landing in a city. No room to run  along, after you're down.\"    \"What's the matter with Franklin Field?\" cried Mr. Damon. \"Out where  they play football.\"    \"Good! The very thing!\" shouted Tom.    \"Mr. Fenwick lives near there,\" went on Mr. Damon, and Tom nodded  comprehendingly.    They were now over North Philadelphia, and, in a few minutes more  were above the Quaker City itself. They were flying rather low, and  as the people in the streets became aware of their presence there  was intense excitement. Tom steered for the big athletic field, and  soon saw it in the distance.    With a suddenness that was startling the motor ceased its terrific  racket. The monoplane gave a sickening dip, and Tom had to adjust  the wing tips and rudder quickly to prevent it slewing around at a  dangerous angle.    \"What's the matter?\" cried Mr. Damon, \"Did you shut it off on  purpose?\"    \"No!\" shouted Tom, \"Something's gone wrong!\"    \"Gone wrong! Bless my overshoes! Is there any danger?\"    \"We'll have to vol-plane to earth,\" answered Tom, and there was a  grim look on his face. He had never executed this feat with a  passenger aboard. He was wondering how the BUTTERFLY would behave.  But he would know very soon, for already the tiny monoplane was  shooting rapidly toward the big field, which was now swarming with a  curious crowd.          CHAPTER VI    THE NEW AIRSHIP      For a brief instant after the stopping of the motor, and the  consequent sudden dropping toward the earth of the monoplane, Tom  glanced at Mr. Damon. The latter's face was rather pale, but he  seemed calm and collected. His lips moved slightly, and Tom, even in  those tense moments, wondered if the odd gentleman was blessing  anything in particular, or everything in general.    Tom threw up the tilting plane, to catch more air beneath it, and  bring the BUTTERFLY in a more parallel position to the earth. This,  in a manner, checked the downward flight, and they glided along  horizontally for a hundred feet or more.    \"Is--is there any great danger, Tom?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"I think not,\" answered the young inventor, confidently. \"I have  done this same thing before, and from greater heights. The only  thing that bothers me is that there are several cross-currents of  air up here, which make it difficult to manage the planes and wing  tips. But I think we'll make a good landing.\"    \"Bless my overcoat!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon \"I certainly hope so.\"    Conversation was more easily carried on now, as the motor was not  spitting fire and throbbing like a battery of Gatling guns. Tom  thought perhaps it might start on the spark, as the propeller was  slowly swinging from the force of air against it. He tried, but  there was no explosion. He had scarcely hoped for it, as he realized  that some part of the mechanism must have broken.    Down they glided, coming nearer and nearer to the earth. The crowd  in the big athletic field grew larger. Shouts of wonder and fear  could be heard, and people could be seen running excitedly about. To  Tom and Mr. Damon they looked like dolls.    Reaching the limit of the parallel glide the monoplane once more  shot down on an incline toward the earth with terrible speed. The  ground seemed to rush up to meet Mr. Damon.    \"Look out!\" he cried to Tom. \"We're going to hit something!\"    \"Not yet,\" was the calm answer \"I'm going to try a new stunt. Hold  fast!\"    \"What are you going to do?\"    \"Some spirals. I think that will let us down easier, but the craft  is likely to tilt a bit, so hold on.\"    The young inventor shifted the movable planes and rudder, and, a  moment later, the BUTTERFLY swung violently around, like a polo pony  taking a sudden turn after the ball. Mr. Damon slid to one side of  his seat, and made a frantic grab for one of the upright supports.    \"I made too short a turn!\" cried Tom, easing off the craft, which  righted itself in an instant. \"The air currents fooled me.\"    Under his skillful guidance, the monoplane was soon slowly  approaching the earth in a series of graceful curves. It was under  perfect control, and a smile of relief came on the face of the young  inventor. Seeing it Mr. Damon took courage, and his hands, which had  grasped the uprights with such firmness that his knuckles showed  white with the strain, were now removed. He sat easily in his seat.    \"We're all right now,\" declared Tom. \"I'll take a couple of forward  glides now, and we'll land.\"    He sent the machine straight ahead. It gathered speed in an instant.  Then, with an upward tilt it was slackened, almost as if brakes had  been applied. Once more it shot toward the earth, and once more it  was checked by an up-tilted plane.    Then with a thud which shook up the occupants of the two seats, the  BUTTERFLY came to the ground, and ran along on the three bicycle  wheels. Swiftly it slid over the level ground. A more ideal landing  place would have been hard to find. Scores of willing hands reached  out, and checked the momentum of the little monoplane, and Tom and  Mr. Damon climbed from"]]]
