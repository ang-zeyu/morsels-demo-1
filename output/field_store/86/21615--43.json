This was a prince of intellectual powers far beyond the  common, of untiring industry in affairs, pious, 'chaste as a monk,' and  cold-hearted as a usurer; gifted with all the qualities, in short, that  make a man feared and well served, and with none that make him beloved.  He was not one to risk failure for want of deliberation and foresight,  and his measures were taken with such prudence that by the time he  landed in Italy his victory was almost assured. He found his enemy at  Benevento, in the Neapolitan territory (February 1266). In order to get  time for reinforcements to come up, Manfred sought to enter into  negotiations; but Charles was ready, and knew his advantage. He answered  with the splendid confidence of a man sure of a heavenly if he missed  an earthly triumph. 'Go tell the Sultan of Lucera,'[18] was his reply,  'that to-day I shall send him to Hell, or he will send me to Paradise.'  Manfred was slain, and his body, discovered only after long search, was  denied Christian burial. Yet, excommunicated though he was, and  suspected of being at heart as much Mohammedan as Christian, he, as well  as his great rival, is found by Dante in Purgatory.[19] And, while the  Christian poet pours his invective on the pious Charles,[20] he is at no  pains to hide how pitiful appeared to him the fate of the frank and  handsome Manfred, all whose followers adored him. He, as more than once  it happens in the _Comedy_ to those whose memory is dear to the poet, is  saved from Inferno by the fiction that in the hour of death he sent one  thought heavenward--'so wide is the embrace of infinite mercy.'[21]    To Florence Charles proved a useful if a greedy and exacting protector.  Under his influence as Pacificator of Tuscany--an office created for him  by the Pope--the Guelfs were enabled slowly to return from exile, and  the Ghibelines were gradually depressed into a condition of dependence  on the goodwill of the citizens over whom they had so lately domineered.  Henceforth failure attended every effort they made to lift their heads.  The stubbornly irreconcilable were banished or put to death. Elaborate  provisions were enacted in obedience to the Pope's commands, by which  the rest were to be at peace with their old foes. Now they were to live  in the city, but under disabilities as regarded eligibility to offices;  now they were to be represented in the public councils, but so as to be  always in a minority. The result of the measures taken, and of the  natural drift of things, was that ere many more years had passed there  were no avowed Ghibelines in Florence.    One influence constantly at work in this direction was that of the  _Parte Guelfa_, a Florentine society formed to guard the interests of  the Guelfs, and which was possessed of the greater part of the Ghibeline  property confiscated after the triumph of Charles had turned the balance  of power in Italy. This organisation has been well described as a state  within a state, and it seems as if the part it played in the Florentine  politics of this period were not yet fully known. This much seems sure,  that the members of the Society were mostly Guelf nobles; that its  power, derived from the administration of vast wealth to a political  end, was so great that the Captain of the _Parte Guelfa_ held a place  almost on a level with that of the chief officials of the Commonwealth;  and that it made loans of ready money to Florence and the Pope, on  condition of their being used to the damage of the Ghibelines.[22]    The Commonwealth, busy in resettling its government, was but slightly  interested in much that went on around it. The boy Conradin, grandson of  Frederick, nephew of Manfred, and in a sense the last of the  Hohenstaufens, came to Italy to measure himself with Charles, and paid  for his audacity upon the scaffold.[23] Charles deputed Guy of Montfort,  son of the great Earl Simon, to be his vicar in Florence. The Pope  smiled and frowned in turn on the Florentines, as their devotion to him  waxed and waned; and so he did on his champion Charles, whose ambition  was apt to outrun his piety. All this was of less importance to the  Commonwealth than the promotion of its domestic interests. It saw with  equanimity a check given to Charles by the election of a new Emperor in  Rudolf of Hapsburg (1273), and a further check by the Sicilian Vespers,  which lost him half his kingdom (1283). But Siena and Pisa, Arezzo, and  even Pistoia, were the objects of a sleepless anxiety. Pisa was the  chief source of danger, being both from sentiment and interest  stubbornly Ghibeline. When at length its power was broken by Genoa, its  great maritime rival, in the naval battle of Meloria (1284), there was  no longer any city in Tuscany to be compared for wealth and strength  with Florence.      III.    It was at this period that Dante, reaching the age of manhood, began to  perform the duties that fell to him as a youthful citizen--duties which,  till the age of thirty was reached, were chiefly those of military  service. The family to which he belonged was a branch of the Elisei,  who are included by Villani in the earliest catalogue given by him of  the great Florentine houses. Cacciaguida, one of the Elisei, born in  1106, married a daughter of the Aldighieri, a family of Ferrara. Their  son was christened Aldighiero, and this was adopted by the family as a  surname, afterwards changed to Alighieri. The son of Aldighiero was  Bellincione, father of Aldighiero II., the father of Dante.    It serves no purpose to fill a page of biography with genealogical  details when the hero's course in life was in no way affected by the  accident of who was his grandfather. In the case of Dante, his position  in the State, his political creed, and his whole fashion of regarding  life, were vitally influenced by the circumstances of his birth. He knew  that his genius, and his genius alone, was to procure him fame; he  declares a virtuous and gentle life to be the true proof of nobility:  and yet his family pride is always breaking through. In real life, from  his family's being decayed in wealth and fallen in consideration  compared with its neighbours, he may have been led to put emphasis on  his assertion of gentility; and amid the poverty and humiliations of his  exile he may have found a tonic in the thought that by birth, not to  speak of other things, he was the equal of those who spurned him or  coldly lent him aid. However this may be, there is a tacit claim of  equality with them in the easy grace with which he encounters great  nobles in the world of shades. The bent of his mind in relation to this  subject is shown by such a touch as that when he esteems it among the  glories of Francis of Assisi not to have been ashamed of his base  extraction.[24] In Paradise he meets his great crusading ancestor  Cacciaguida, and feigns contrition for the pleasure with which he  listens to a declaration of the unmixed purity of their common  blood.[25] In Inferno he catches a glimpse, sudden and terrible, of a  kinsman whose violent death had remained unavenged; and, for the nonce,  the philosopher-poet is nothing but the member of an injured Florentine  clan, and winces at the thought of a neglected blood feud.[26] And when  Farinata, the great Ghibeline, and haughtiest of all the Florentines of  the past generation, asks him, 'Who were thine ancestors?' Dante says  with a proud pretence of humility, 'Anxious to obey, I hid nothing, but  told him all he demanded.'[27]    Dante was born in Florence in the May of 1265.[28] A brother of his  father had been one of the guards of the Florentine Caroccio, or  standard-bearing car, at the battle of Montaperti (1260). Whether  Dante's father necessarily shared in the exile of his party may be  doubted. He is said--on slight authority--to have been a jurisconsult:  there is no reason to suppose he was at Montaperti. It is difficult to  believe that Florence was quite emptied of its lawyers and merchants as  a consequence of the Ghibeline victory. In any case, it is certain that  while the fugitive Guelfs were mostly accompanied by their wives, and  did not return till 1267, we have Dante's own word for it that he was  born in the great city by the Arno,[29] and was baptized in the  Baptistery, his beautiful St. John's.[30] At the font he received the  name of Durante, shortened, as he bore it, into Dante. It is in this  form that it finds a place in the _Comedy_,[31] once, and only once,  written down of necessity, the poet says--the necessity of being  faithful in the report of Beatrice's words: from the wider necessity, we  may assume, of imbedding in the work itself the name by which the author  was commonly known, and by which he desired to be called for all time.    When Dante was about ten years old he lost his father. Of his mother  nothing but her Christian name of Bella is known. Neither of them is  mentioned in the _Comedy_,[32] nor indeed are his wife and children.  Boccaccio describes the Alighieri as having been in easy though not in  wealthy circumstances; and Leonardo Bruni, who in the fifteenth century  sought out what he could learn of Dante, says of him that he was  possessed of a patrimony sufficient for an honourable livelihood. That  he was so might be inferred from the character of the education he  received. His studies, says Boccaccio, were not directed to any object  of worldly profit. That there is no sign of their having been directed  by churchmen tends to prove the existence in his native town of a class  of cultivated laymen; and that there was such appears from the ease  with which, when, passing from boyhood to manhood, he felt a craving for  intellectual and congenial society, he found in nobles of the stamp of  Guido Cavalcanti men like-minded with himself. It was indeed"]]]
