[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5308"],[0,"The Paradise Mystery (#6)"],[1,", observation of his late  employer. That Ransford was visibly upset by something was plain enough  to see; his face was still pale, he was muttering to himself, one  clenched fist was pounding the open palm of the other hand--altogether,  he looked like a man who is suddenly confronted with some fearful  difficulty. And when Bryce, having looked long enough to satisfy his  wishes, coughed gently, he started in such a fashion as to suggest that  his nerves had become unstrung.    \"What is it?--what are you doing there?\" he demanded almost fiercely.  \"What do you mean by coming in like that?\"    Bryce affected to have seen nothing.    \"I came to fetch you,\" he answered. \"There's been an accident in  Paradise--man fallen from that door at the head of St. Wrytha's Stair. I  wish you'd come--but I may as well tell you that he's past help--dead!\"    \"Dead! A man?\" exclaimed Ransford. \"What man? A workman?\"    Bryce had already made up his mind about telling Ransford of the  stranger's call at the surgery. He would say nothing--at that time at  any rate. It was improbable that any one but himself knew of the call;  the side entrance to the surgery was screened from the Close by a  shrubbery; it was very unlikely that any passer-by had seen the man call  or go away. No--he would keep his knowledge secret until it could be  made better use of.    \"Not a workman--not a townsman--a stranger,\" he answered. \"Looks like a  well-to-do tourist. A slightly-built, elderly man--grey-haired.\"    Ransford, who had turned to his desk to master himself, looked round  with a sudden sharp glance--and for the moment Bryce was taken aback.  For he had condemned Ransford--and yet that glance was one of apparently  genuine surprise, a glance which almost convinced him, against his  will, against only too evident facts, that Ransford was hearing of the  Paradise affair for the first time.    \"An elderly man--grey-haired--slightly built?\" said Ransford. \"Dark  clothes--silk hat?\"    \"Precisely,\" replied Bryce, who was now considerably astonished. \"Do you  know him?\"    \"I saw such a man entering the Cathedral, a while ago,\" answered  Ransford. \"A stranger, certainly. Come along, then.\"    He had fully recovered his self-possession by that time, and he led  the way from the surgery and across the Close as if he were going on  an ordinary professional visit. He kept silence as they walked rapidly  towards Paradise, and Bryce was silent, too. He had studied Ransford  a good deal during their two years' acquaintanceship, and he knew  Ransford's power of repressing and commanding his feelings and  concealing his thoughts. And now he decided that the look and start  which he had at first taken to be of the nature of genuine astonishment  were cunningly assumed, and he was not surprised when, having reached  the group of men gathered around the body, Ransford showed nothing but  professional interest.    \"Have you done anything towards finding out who this unfortunate  man is?\" asked Ransford, after a brief examination, as he turned to  Mitchington. \"Evidently a stranger--but he probably has papers on him.\"    \"There's nothing on him--except a purse, with plenty of money in it,\"  answered Mitchington. \"I've been through his pockets myself: there isn't  a scrap of paper--not even as much as an old letter. But he's evidently  a tourist, or something of the sort, and so he'll probably have stayed  in the city all night, and I'm going to inquire at the hotels.\"    \"There'll be an inquest, of course,\" remarked Ransford mechanically.  \"Well--we can do nothing, Mitchington. You'd better have the body  removed to the mortuary.\" He turned and looked up the broken stairway  at the foot of which they were standing. \"You say he fell down that?\" he  asked. \"Whatever was he doing up there?\"    Mitchington looked at Bryce.    \"Haven't you told Dr. Ransford how it was?\" he asked.    \"No,\" answered Bryce. He glanced at Ransford, indicating Varner, who had  come back with the constable and was standing by. \"He didn't fall,\" he  went on, watching Ransford narrowly. \"He was violently flung out of that  doorway. Varner here saw it.\"    Ransford's cheek flushed, and he was unable to repress a slight start.  He looked at the mason.    \"You actually saw it!\" he exclaimed. \"Why, what did you see?\"    \"Him!\" answered Varner, nodding at the dead man. \"Flung, head and heels,  clean through that doorway up there. Hadn't a chance to save himself, he  hadn't! Just grabbed at--nothing!--and came down. Give a year's wages if  I hadn't seen it--and heard him scream.\"    Ransford was watching Varner with a set, concentrated look.    \"Who--flung him?\" he asked suddenly. \"You say you saw!\"    \"Aye, sir, but not as much as all that!\" replied the mason. \"I just saw  a hand--and that was all. But,\" he added, turning to the police with a  knowing look, \"there's one thing I can swear to--it was a gentleman's  hand! I saw the white shirt cuff and a bit of a black sleeve!\"    Ransford turned away. But he just as suddenly turned back to the  inspector.    \"You'll have to let the Cathedral authorities know, Mitchington,\" he  said. \"Better get the body removed, though, first--do it now before the  morning service is over. And--let me hear what you find out about his  identity, if you can discover anything in the city.\"    He went away then, without another word or a further glance at the dead  man. But Bryce had already assured himself of what he was certain was  a fact--that a look of unmistakable relief had swept across Ransford's  face for the fraction of a second when he knew that there were no papers  on the dead man. He himself waited after Ransford had gone; waited until  the police had fetched a stretcher, when he personally superintended  the removal of the body to the mortuary outside the Close. And there a  constable who had come over from the police-station gave a faint hint as  to further investigation.    \"I saw that poor gentleman last night, sir,\" he said to the inspector.  \"He was standing at the door of the Mitre, talking to another  gentleman--a tallish man.\"    \"Then I'll go across there,\" said Mitchington. \"Come with me, if you  like, Dr. Bryce.\"    This was precisely what Bryce desired--he was already anxious to acquire  all the information he could get. And he walked over the way with the  inspector, to the quaint old-world inn which filled almost one side  of the little square known as Monday Market, and in at the courtyard,  where, looking out of the bow window which had served as an outer bar  in the coaching days, they found the landlady of the Mitre, Mrs.  Partingley. Bryce saw at once that she had heard the news.    \"What's this, Mr. Mitchington?\" she demanded as they drew near across  the cobble-paved yard. \"Somebody's been in to say there's been an  accident to a gentleman, a stranger--I hope it isn't one of the two  we've got in the house?\"    \"I should say it is, ma'am,\" answered the inspector. \"He was seen  outside here last night by one of our men, anyway.\"    The landlady uttered an expression of distress, and opening a side-door,  motioned them to step into her parlour.    \"Which of them is it?\" she asked anxiously. \"There's two--came together  last night, they did--a tall one and a short one. Dear, dear me!--is it  a bad accident, now, inspector?\"    \"The man's dead, ma'am,\" replied Mitchington grimly. \"And we want to  know who he is. Have you got his name--and the other gentleman's?\"    Mrs. Partingley uttered another exclamation of distress and  astonishment, lifting her plump hands in horror. But her business  faculties remained alive, and she made haste to produce a big visitors'  book and to spread it open before her callers.    \"There it is!\" she said, pointing to the two last entries. \"That's the  short gentleman's name--Mr. John Braden, London. And that's the  tall one's--Mr. Christopher Dellingham--also London. Tourists, of  course--we've never seen either of them before.\"    \"Came together, you say, Mrs. Partingley?\" asked Mitchington. \"When was  that, now?\"    \"Just before dinner, last night,\" answered the landlady. \"They'd  evidently come in by the London train--that gets in at six-forty, as you  know. They came here together, and they'd dinner together, and spent the  evening together. Of course, we took them for friends. But they didn't  go out together this morning, though they'd breakfast together. After  breakfast, Mr. Dellingham asked me the way to the old Manor Mill, and  he went off there, so I concluded. Mr. Braden, he hung about a bit,  studying a local directory I'd lent him, and after a while he asked me  if he could hire a trap to take him out to Saxonsteade this afternoon.  Of course, I said he could, and he arranged for it to be ready at  two-thirty. Then he went out, and across the market towards the  Cathedral. And that,\" concluded Mrs. Partingley, \"is about all I know,  gentlemen.\"    \"Saxonsteade, eh?\" remarked Mitchington. \"Did he say anything about his  reasons for going there?\"    \"Well, yes, he did,\" replied the landlady. \"For he asked me if I thought  he'd be likely to find the Duke at home at that time of day. I said I  knew his Grace was at Saxonsteade just now, and that I should think the  middle of the afternoon would be a good time.\"    \"He didn't tell you his business with the Duke?\" asked Mitchington.    \"Not a word!\" said the landlady. \"Oh, no!--just that, and no more.  But--here's Mr. Dellingham.\"    Bryce turned to see a tall, broad-shouldered, bearded man pass the  window--the door opened and he walked in, to glance inquisitively at the  inspector. He turned at once to Mrs. Partingley.    \"I hear there's been an accident to that gentleman I came in with last  night?\" he said. \"Is it anything serious? Your ostler says--\"    \"These gentlemen have just come about it, sir,\" answered the landlady.  She glanced at Mitchington. \"Perhaps you'll tell--\" she began.    \"Was he a friend of yours, sir?\" asked"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5311"],[0,"Parnassus on Wheels (#6)"],[1,"around. Seems kind of a shame, with a famous  author at the next farm, not to read more, don't it, now?\"    So by the time we got down to Mrs. Mason's squash pie (good pie,  too, I admit, but her hand is a little heavy for pastry), the whole  household was enthusiastic about books, and the atmosphere was  literary enough for even Dr. Eliot to live in without panting. Mrs.  Mason opened up her parlour and we sat there while Mifflin recited  \"The Revenge\" and \"Maud Muller.\"    \"Well, now, ain't that real sweet!\" said Emma Mason. \"It's  surprising how those words rhyme so nicely. Seems almost as though  it was done a-purpose! Reminds me of piece day at school. There  was a mighty pretty piece I learned called the 'Wreck of the  Asperus.'\" And she subsided into a genteel melancholy.    I saw that Mr. Mifflin was well astride his hobby: he had started to  tell the children about Robin Hood, but I had the sense to give him  a wink. We had to be getting along or surely Andrew might be on us.  So while Mifflin was putting Pegasus into the shafts again I picked  out seven or eight books that I thought would fit the needs of the  Masons. Mr. Mason insisted that \"Happiness and Hayseed\" be included  among them, and gave me a crisp five-dollar bill, refusing any  change. \"No, no,\" he said, \"I've had more fun than I get at a grange  meeting. Come round again, Miss McGill; I'm going to tell Andrew  what a good show this travelling theayter of yours gives! And you,  Professor, any time you're here about road-mending season, stop in  an' tell me some more good advice. Well, I must get back to the  field.\"    Bock fell in under the van, and we creaked off down the lane.  Mifflin filled his pipe and was chuckling to himself. I was a little  worried now for fear Andrew might overtake us.    \"It's a wonder Sam Mason didn't call up Andrew,\" I said. \"It must  have looked mighty queer to him for an old farm hand like me to be  around, peddling books.\"    \"He would have done it straight off,\" said Mifflin, \"but you see, I  cut his telephone wire!\"        CHAPTER FIVE      I gazed in astonishment at the wizened little rogue. Here was a  new side to the amiable idealist! Apparently there was a streak of  fearless deviltry in him besides his gentle love of books. I'm bound  to say that now, for the first time, I really admired him. I had  burnt my own very respectable boats behind me, and I rather enjoyed  knowing that he, too, could act briskly in a pinch.    \"Well!\" I said. \"You are a cool hand! It's a good job for you that  you didn't stay a schoolmaster. You might have taught your pupils  some fine deviltries! And at your age, too!\"    I'm afraid my raillery goes a little too far sometimes. He flushed  a bit at my reference to his age, and puffed sharply at his pipe.    \"I say,\" he rejoined, \"how old do you think I am, anyway? Only  forty-one, by the bones of Byron! Henry VIII was only forty-one  when he married Anne Boleyn. There are many consolations in history  for people over forty! Remember that when you get there.    \"Shakespeare wrote 'King Lear' at forty-one,\" he added, more  humorously; and then burst out laughing. \"I'd like to edit a series  of 'Chloroform Classics,' to include only books written after forty.  Who was that doctor man who recommended anaesthetics for us at that  age? Now isn't that just like a medico? Nurse us through the  diseases of childhood, and as soon as we settle down into permanent  good health and worldly wisdom, and freedom from doctors' fees, why  he loses interest in us! Jove! I must note that down and bring it  into my book.\"    He pulled out a memorandum book and jotted down \"Chloroform  Classics\" in a small, neat hand.    \"Well,\" I said (I felt a little contrite, as I was sincerely  sorry to have offended him), \"I've passed forty myself in some  measurements, so youth no longer has any terrors for me.\"    He looked at me rather comically.    \"My dear madam,\" he said, \"your age is precisely eighteen. I think  that if we escape the clutches of the Sage of Redfield you may  really begin to live.\"    \"Oh, Andrew's not a bad sort,\" I said. \"He's absentminded, and hot  tempered, and a little selfish. The publishers have done their best  to spoil him, but for a literary man I guess he's quite human. He  rescued me from being a governess, and that's to his credit. If only  he didn't take his meals quite so much as a matter of course....\"    \"The preposterous thing about him is that he really can _write_,\"  said Mifflin. \"I envy him that. Don't let him know I said so, but  as a matter of fact his prose is almost as good as Thoreau. He  approaches facts as daintily as a cat crossing a wet road.\"    \"You should see him at dinner,\" I thought; or rather I meant to  think it, but the words slipped out. I found myself thinking aloud  in a rather disconcerting way while sitting with this strange  little person.    He looked at me. I noticed for the first time that his eyes were  slate blue, with funny birds' foot wrinkles at the corners.    \"That's so,\" he said. \"I never thought of that. A fine prose style  certainly presupposes sound nourishment. Excellent point that...  And yet Thoreau did his own cooking. A sort of Boy Scout I guess,  with a badge as kitchen master. Perhaps he took Beechnut bacon with  him into the woods. I wonder who cooked for Stevenson--Cummy? The  'Child's Garden of Verses' was really a kind of kitchen garden,  wasn't it? I'm afraid the commissariat problem has weighed rather  heavily on you. I'm glad you've got away from it.\"    All this was getting rather intricate for me. I set it down as I  remember it, inaccurately perhaps. My governess days are pretty  far astern now, and my line is common sense rather than literary  allusions. I said something of the sort.    \"Common sense?\" he repeated. \"Good Lord, ma'am, sense is the most  uncommon thing in the world. I haven't got it. I don't believe your  brother has, from what you say. Bock here has it. See how he trots  along the road, keeps an eye on the scenery, and minds his own  business. I never saw him get into a fight yet. Wish I could say the  same of myself. I named him after Boccaccio, to remind me to read  the 'Decameron' some day.\"    \"Judging by the way you talk,\" I said, \"you ought to be quite a  writer yourself.\"    \"Talkers never write. They go on talking.\"    There was a considerable silence. Mifflin relit his pipe and watched  the landscape with a shrewd eye. I held the reins loosely, and Peg  ambled along with a steady clop-clop. Parnassus creaked musically,  and the mid-afternoon sun lay rich across the road. We passed  another farm, but I did not suggest stopping as I felt we ought to  push on. Mifflin seemed lost in meditation, and I began to wonder,  a little uneasily, how the adventure would turn out. This quaintly  masterful little man was a trifle disconcerting. Across the next  ridge I could see the Greenbriar church spire shining white.    \"Do you know this part of the country?\" I asked finally.    \"Not this exact section. I've been in Port Vigor often, but then I  was on the road that runs along the Sound. I suppose this village  ahead is Greenbriar?\"    \"Yes,\" I said. \"It's about thirteen miles from there to Port Vigor.  How do you expect to get back to Brooklyn?\"    \"Oh, Brooklyn?\" he said vaguely. \"Yes, I'd forgotten about Brooklyn  for the minute. I was thinking of my book. Why, I guess I'll take  the train from Port Vigor. The trouble is, you can never get to  Brooklyn without going through New York. It's symbolic, I suppose.\"    Again there was a silence. Finally he said, \"Is there another town  between Greenbriar and Port Vigor?\"    \"Yes, Shelby,\" I said. \"About five miles from Greenbriar.\"    \"That'll be as far as you'll get to-night,\" he said. \"I'll see you  safe to Shelby, and then make tracks for Port Vigor. I hope there's  a decent inn at Shelby where you can stop overnight.\"    I hoped so, too, but I wasn't going to let him see that with the  waning afternoon my enthusiasm was a little less robust. I was  wondering what Andrew was thinking, and whether Mrs. McNally had  left things in good order. Like most Swedes she had to be watched or  she left her work only three quarters done. And I didn't depend any  too much on her daughter Rosie to do the housework efficiently. I  wondered what kind of meals Andrew would get. And probably he would  go right on wearing his summer underclothes, although I had already  reminded him about changing. Then there were the chickens...    Well, the Rubicon was crossed now, and there was nothing to be done.    To my surprise, little Redbeard had divined my anxiety. \"Now don't  you worry about the Sage,\" he said kindly. \"A man that draws his  royalties isn't going to starve. By the bones of John Murray, his  publishers can send him a cook if necessary! This is a holiday for  you, and don't you forget it.\"    And with this cheering sentiment in my mind, we rolled sedately down  the hill toward Greenbriar.    I am about as hardy as most folks, I think, but I confess I balked a  little at the idea of facing the various people I know in Greenbriar  as the owner of a bookvan and the companion of a literary huckster.  Also I recollected that if Andrew should try to trace us it would be  as well for me to keep out of sight. So after telling Mr. Mifflin  how I felt about matters I dived into the Parnassus and lay down  most comfortably on the bunk. Bock the terrier joined me, and I  rested there in great comfort of mind and body as we ambled down the  grade. The sun shone through the little skylight gilding a tin pan  that hung over the cook stove. Tacked here and there were portraits  of authors, and I noticed a faded newspaper cutting pinned up. The  headlines ran: \"Literary Pedlar Lectures on Poetry.\" I read it  through. Apparently the Professor (so I had begun to call him, as  the aptness of the nickname stuck in my mind) had given a lecture  in Camden, N.J., where"]]]
