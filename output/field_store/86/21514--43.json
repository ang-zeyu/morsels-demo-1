Having set the clock approximately to sidereal time, observe one or two  more stars in the same way as above. The difference between the observed  time and the right ascension, if any is found, is the \"correction\" of  the clock. This correction ought not to exceed a minute if due care has  been taken in the several operations prescribed. The relation of the  clock to the right ascension of the stars is expressed in the following  equation, with which the student should become thoroughly familiar:        A = T ± U    _T_ stands for the time by the clock at which the star crossed the  meridian. _A_ is the right ascension of the star, and _U_ is the  correction of the clock. Use the + sign in the equation whenever the  clock is too slow, and the - sign when it is too fast. _U_ may be found  from this equation when _A_ and _T_ are given, or _A_ may be found when  _T_ and _U_ are given. It is in this way that astronomers measure the  right ascensions of the stars and planets.    Determine _U_ from each star you have observed, and note how the several  results agree one with another.    21. DEFINITIONS.--To define a thing or an idea is to give a description  sufficient to identify it and distinguish it from every other possible  thing or idea. If a definition does not come up to this standard it is  insufficient. Anything beyond this requirement is certainly useless and  probably mischievous.    Let the student define the following geographical terms, and let him  also criticise the definitions offered by his fellow-students: Equator,  poles, meridian, latitude, longitude, north, south, east, west.    Compare the following astronomical definitions with your geographical  definitions, and criticise them in the same way. If you are not able to  improve upon them, commit them to memory:    _The Poles_ of the heavens are those points in the sky toward which the  earth's axis points. How many are there? The one near Polaris is called  the north pole.    _The Celestial Equator_ is a great circle of the sky distant 90° from  the poles.    _The Zenith_ is that point of the sky, overhead, toward which a plumb  line points. Why is the word overhead placed in the definition? Is there  more than one zenith?    _The Horizon_ is a great circle of the sky 90° distant from the zenith.    _An Hour Circle_ is any great circle of the sky which passes through the  poles. Every star has its own hour circle.    _The Meridian_ is that hour circle which passes through the zenith.    _A Vertical Circle_ is any great circle that passes through the zenith.  Is the meridian a vertical circle?    _The Declination_ of a star is its angular distance north or south of  the celestial equator.    _The Right Ascension_ of a star is the angle included between its hour  circle and the hour circle of a certain point on the equator which is  called the _Vernal Equinox_. From spherical geometry we learn that this  angle is to be measured either at the pole where the two hour circles  intersect, as is done in the star map opposite page 124, or along the  equator, as is done in the map opposite page 190. Right ascension is  always measured from the vernal equinox in the direction opposite to  that in which the stars appear to travel in their diurnal motion--i. e.,  from west toward east.    _The Altitude_ of a star is its angular distance above the horizon.    _The Azimuth_ of a star is the angle between the meridian and the  vertical circle passing through the star. A star due south has an  azimuth of 0°. Due west, 90°. Due north, 180°. Due east, 270°.    What is the azimuth of Polaris in degrees?    What is the azimuth of the sun at sunrise? At sunset? At noon? Are these  azimuths the same on different days?    _The Hour Angle_ of a star is the angle between its hour circle and the  meridian. It is measured from the meridian in the direction in which the  stars appear to travel in their diurnal motion--i. e., from east toward  west.    What is the hour angle of the sun at noon? What is the hour angle of  Polaris when it is at the lowest point in its daily motion?    22. EXERCISES.--The student must not be satisfied with merely learning  these definitions. He must learn to see these points and lines in his  mind as if they were visibly painted upon the sky. To this end it will  help him to note that the poles, the zenith, the meridian, the horizon,  and the equator seem to stand still in the sky, always in the same place  with respect to the observer, while the hour circles and the vernal  equinox move with the stars and keep the same place among them. Does the  apparent motion of a star change its declination or right ascension?  What is the hour angle of the sun when it has the greatest altitude?  Will your answer to the preceding question be true for a star? What is  the altitude of the sun after sunset? In what direction is the north  pole from the zenith? From the vernal equinox? Where are the points in  which the meridian and equator respectively intersect the horizon?          CHAPTER III    FIXED AND WANDERING STARS      23. STAR MAPS.--Select from the map some conspicuous constellation that  will be conveniently placed for observation in the evening, and make on  a large scale a copy of all the stars of the constellation that are  shown upon the map. At night compare this copy with the sky, and mark in  upon your paper all the stars of the constellation which are not already  there. Both the original drawing and the additions made to it by night  should be carefully done, and for the latter purpose what is called the  method of allineations may be used with advantage--i. e., the new star  is in line with two already on the drawing and is midway between them,  or it makes an equilateral triangle with two others, or a square with  three others, etc.    A series of maps of the more prominent constellations, such as Ursa  Major, Cassiopea, Pegasus, Taurus, Orion, Gemini, Canis Major, Leo,  Corvus, Bootes, Virgo, Hercules, Lyra, Aquila, Scorpius, should be  constructed in this manner upon a uniform scale and preserved as a part  of the student's work. Let the magnitude of the stars be represented on  the maps as accurately as may be, and note the peculiarity of color  which some stars present. For the most part their color is a very pale  yellow, but occasionally one may be found of a decidedly ruddy  hue--e. g., Aldebaran or Antares. Such a star map, not quite complete,  is shown in Fig. 13.    So, too, a sharp eye may detect that some stars do not remain always of  the same magnitude, but change their brightness from night to night,  and this not on account of cloud or mist in the atmosphere, but from  something in the star itself. Algol is one of the most conspicuous of  these _variable stars_, as they are called.    [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Star map of the region about Orion.]    24. THE MOON'S MOTION AMONG THE STARS.--Whenever the moon is visible  note its position among the stars by allineations, and plot it on the  key map opposite page 190. Keep a record of the day and hour  corresponding to each such observation. You will find, if the work is  correctly done, that the positions of the moon all fall near the curved  line shown on the map. This line is called the ecliptic.    After several such observations have been made and plotted, find by  measurement from the map how many degrees per day the moon moves. How  long would it require to make the circuit of the heavens and come back  to the starting point?    On each night when you observe the moon, make on a separate piece of  paper a drawing of it about 10 centimeters in diameter and show in the  drawing every feature of the moon's face which you can see--e. g., the  shape of the illuminated surface (phase); the direction among the stars  of the line joining the horns; any spots which you can see upon the  moon's face, etc. An opera glass will prove of great assistance in this  work.    Use your drawings and the positions of the moon plotted upon the map to  answer the following questions: Does the direction of the line joining  the horns have any special relation to the ecliptic? Does the amount of  illuminated surface of the moon have any relation to the moon's angular  distance from the sun? Does it have any relation to the time at which  the moon sets? Do the spots on the moon when visible remain always in  the same place? Do they come and go? Do they change their position with  relation to each other? Can you determine from these spots that the moon  rotates about an axis, as the earth does? In what direction does its  axis point? How long does it take to make one revolution about the axis?  Is there any day and night upon the moon?    Each of these questions can be correctly answered from the student's own  observations without recourse to any book.    25. THE SUN AND ITS MOTION.--Examine the face of the sun through a  smoked glass to see if there is anything there that you can sketch.    By day as well as by night the sky is studded with stars, only they can  not be seen by day on account of the overwhelming glare of sunlight, but  the position of the sun among the stars may be found quite as  accurately as was that of the moon, by observing from day to day its  right ascension and declination, and this should be practiced at noon on  clear days by different members of the class.    EXERCISE 10.--The right ascension of the sun may be found by observing  with the sidereal clock the time of its transit over the meridian. Use  the equation in § 20, and substitute in place of _U_ the value of the  clock correction found from observations of stars on a preceding or  following night. If the clock gains or loses _with respect to sidereal  time_, take this into account in the value of _U_.    EXERCISE 11.--To determine the sun's declination, measure its altitude  at the time it crosses the meridian.

Specimens  were taken in the chaparral association in San Antonio Canyon, near  Jackson Lake among yellow pines, and in Mescal Canyon at the upper limit  of the Joshua tree woodland. Bats, probably _volans_, were noted over  sage flats at 8000 feet elevation on Blue Ridge. The only place where  these bats appeared to be numerous was Jackson Lake on the interior  slope; there, on September 19, 1951, _volans_ appeared with the  pipistrelles, and was the most common bat before dark.    An individual of this species taken on October 28, 1951, in a short  mine-shaft in the pinyon belt at the head of Grandview Canyon was slow  in its movements and felt as cold as the walls of the tunnel. It was  late afternoon and the temperature outside the cave was below 40 deg.F. The  floor of the tunnel was covered with the hind wings of large moths of  the genus _Catocala_; _volans_ probably hung in the cave while eating  them.    The series of _volans_ from the San Gabriels shows that the two color  phases of this bat both occur in the area. Two specimens from Jackson  Lake contrast sharply with the rest of the series in their dark  coloration. Benson (1949:50) states that color variation in a series of  _volans_ from a given locality may be striking.    This bat was collected in San Antonio Canyon from 50 minutes after  sundown to two hours and 40 minutes after sundown. In this area these  bats did not visit the ponds in large numbers as they seemed to do on  the desert slope.    A female taken on May 29, 1951, contained one embryo nearly at term.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 9, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: Mescal Canyon, 8 mi. E and 5 mi. S Llano, 4900      ft., 1; 3 mi. W Big Pines, Swarthout Valley, 6000 ft., 3; San      Antonio Canyon, 2800 ft., 5.      =Myotis californicus californicus= (Audubon and Bachman)    California Myotis    On the Pacific face of the mountain range this bat was recorded commonly  below approximately 5000 feet elevation, where it seemed to be most  common in the oak woodland of canyons. On the desert slope it was  collected at Jackson Lake in yellow pine woodland, in Mescal Canyon in  the juniper belt, and bats presumably of this species were observed at  several points in the pinyon-juniper woodland.    Individuals of this species were often observed foraging from five to  ten feet above the ground around the alders and _Baccharis_ near San  Antonio Creek, but they did not fly so low or so near the vegetation as  did _Myotis evotis_. Here they were taken from 18 minutes to 55 minutes  after sunset; this indicates an early and short forage period.    This bat may be active even in winter. On February 8, 1952, in lower San  Antonio Canyon, a bat, probably of this species, was noted foraging; and  collecting in early November, 1951, yielded specimens.    On May 22, 1951, a female obtained in San Antonio Canyon had one  five-millimeter embryo, and subsequently all the females examined had  embryos until June 12, when collecting was discontinued.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 16, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: Mescal Canyon, 4800 ft., 2; Jackson Lake, 6000      ft., 1 (PC); San Antonio Canyon, 3900 ft., 1; San Antonio      Canyon, 2800 ft., 12.      =Pipistrellus hesperus merriami= (Dobson)    Western Pipistrelle    This is the most obvious if not the most common bat of the lower coastal  slopes of the San Gabriels. In the spring and fall of 1951 individuals  were noted from 1700 feet in the coastal sage scrub association to the  white fir forests on Blue Ridge at 8200 feet elevation and were  commonest in the rocky canyons of the lower Pacific slope below 4000  feet, and usually foraged near the steep canyon sides high above the  canyon bottoms.    Pipistrelles were generally the first bats to appear in the evening,  although the times of their appearance were irregular. In April and May,  in lower San Antonio Canyon, they appeared from 28 minutes before sunset  to 30 minutes after sunset, with the average time of appearance eight  and one-half minutes after sunset. Like _Myotis californicus_ this  pipistrelle seemed to have a short and early foraging period. No  pipistrelles were recorded at ponds later than one hour and five minutes  after sunset, and usually they were not seen later than 40 minutes after  sunset. Most of the specimens taken later than one half hour after  sunset had full stomachs. More than 50 pipistrelles were captured at the  ponds in San Antonio Canyon; six were kept for specimens. This species  is probably present in the area throughout the winter. Pipistrelles were  active in early April in Evey Canyon, were observed in early November  in San Antonio Canyon, and on January 26, 1952, an individual was noted  foraging near the mouth of Palmer Canyon. They are probably not active  in winter on the colder desert slope of the mountains.    Pipistrelles often foraged in loose flocks of about half a dozen  individuals. On many occasions these groups were first seen foraging  high up above the canyon bottom, then, as it grew darker, they descended  and foraged within 50 or 100 feet of the floor of the canyon.  Immediately before dark these groups seemed to have forage beats; one  minute several pipistrelles would be overhead, and the next minute none  would be in sight.    A female taken in San Antonio Canyon on June 8, 1951, contained two  five-millimeter embryos.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 6, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: San Antonio Canyon, 2800 ft., 5; Evey Canyon,      2400 ft., 1.      =Pipistrellus hesperus hesperus= (H. Allen)    Western Pipistrelle    This species was common in the spring and autumn of 1951 from the lower  edge of the yellow pine forest down into the belt of Joshua trees. In  early April on the desert slope at 4800 feet in Mescal Canyon,  pipistrelles foraged on evenings when it was windy but not cold. On cold  evenings (when the temperature was below roughly 45 deg.F) none was seen. On  windy nights the pipistrelles often forsook their usual high forage  habits and foraged 15 feet or so above the ground where the vegetation  and outcrops of rock broke the force of the wind. In 1951 no  pipistrelles were noted on the desert slope later than October 15.        _Specimens examined._--Los Angeles County: Mescal Canyon, 4800      ft., 4.      =Eptesicus fuscus bernardinus= Rhoads    Big Brown Bat    This bat was on the coastal slope from the sage scrub association at  1100 feet, up to 8000 feet on Blue Ridge, and on the desert slope down  to the upper edge of the Joshua tree belt at 4800 feet in Mescal Canyon.  It was the most common bat at the ponds in San Antonio Canyon in May and  June of 1951, but in September and October of the same year none was  obtained there.    On the Pacific slope of the San Gabriels the big brown bats segregate  according to sex in the spring, the males occupying the foothills and  mountains and the females the level valley floor at the coastal base  of the range. Of 70 big brown bats captured in May and June of 1951, at  the ponds in San Antonio Canyon, only one was a female. A large colony  of more than 200 individuals in a barn near Covina, in the citrus belt,  was composed of only females.    Times of capture of this bat at the ponds in San Antonio Canyon ranged  from ten minutes after sunset to two hours and thirty minutes after  sunset. Generally these bats came to the ponds in groups of several  individuals, and often more than a dozen were captured in the course of  an evening's collecting.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 7, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: Mescal Canyon, 4800 ft., 1; San Antonio Canyon,      2800 ft., 2; Covina, 1100 ft., 4 (2PC).      =Lasiurus borealis teleotis= (H. Allen)    Red Bat    One female was taken on September 30, 1951, in San Antonio Canyon, at  2800 feet elevation. The descriptions which the citrus growers of the  Claremont and Glendora vicinity give of the bats they find occasionally  hanging in their citrus trees accurately describe this species. Its  seasonal occurrence there is unknown.      =Lasiurus cinereus cinereus= (Pasilot de Beauvois)    Hoary Bat    Specimens were collected in spring in 1951 at elevations of 2800 and  3200 feet in San Antonio Canyon, on the coastal slope, and in Mescal  Canyon at 4900 feet, on the desert slope. Large, fast flying bats,  probably of this species, were seen at Jackson Lake, 6000 feet  elevation, on October 15, 1951.    Hoary bats are present in the San Gabriels in the fall, winter, and  spring. In 1951 the last spring specimen was taken on June 11, in Mescal  Canyon; then collecting was discontinued until late September when the  first hoary bat was taken on the thirtieth of that month. From this date  on into the winter hoary bats were recorded regularly. They seemed to be  as common in early June as in most of April and May; possibly some  remain in the San Gabriels throughout the summer.    In spring these bats seem to segregate by sex; of twelve kept as  specimens and at least an equal number captured and released only one  was a female. All were captured above 2800 feet.    Hoary bats seem to have a long pre-midnight forage period, having been  captured at ponds from 21 minutes after sunset, to three hours and 26  minutes after sunset. Generally those taken early had empty stomachs  and those taken later had full stomachs. On the night of May 24, 1951, a  hoary bat captured two hours and five minutes after sunset had only a  partially full stomach.    On May 25, 1951, an unusual concentration of hoary bats was observed at  a pond at about 3200 feet elevation, in San Antonio Canyon (Vaughan,  1953). The day had been clear and warm, one of the first summerlike days  of spring. Beginning at 30"]]]
