It was,  however, manifest that two somewhat irregular ellipses were nearly  completed in 9 h. Another seedling, 1 ½ in. in height, was then observed  during 23 h.; but the observations were not made at sufficiently short  intervals, as shown by the few dots in Fig. 12, and the tracing was not now  sufficiently enlarged. Nevertheless there could be no doubt about the  circumnutation of the hypocotyl, which described in 12 h. a figure  representing three irregular ellipses of unequal sizes.     The cotyledons are in constant movement up and down during the whole day,  and as they offer the unusual case of moving downwards late in the evening  and in the early part of the night, many observations were made on them. A  filament was fixed along the middle of one, and its movement traced on a  vertical glass; but the tracing is not given, as the hypocotyl was not  secured, so that it was impossible to distinguish clearly between its  movement and that of the cotyledon. The cotyledons rose from 10.30 A.M. to  about 3 P.M.; they then sank till 10 P.M., rising, however, greatly in the  latter part of the night.  [page 23]  The angles above the horizon at which the cotyledons of another seedling  stood at different hours is recorded in the following short table: --    Oct. 20   2.50 P.M...25o above horizon.  Oct. 20   4.20 P.M...22o above horizon.  Oct. 20   5.20 P.M...15o above horizon.  Oct. 20 10.40 P.M...8o above horizon.  Oct. 21   8.40 A.M...28o above horizon.  Oct. 21 11.15 A.M...35o above horizon.  Oct. 21   9.11 P.M...10o below horizon.    The position of the two cotyledons was roughly sketched at various hours  with the same general result.    In the following summer, the hypocotyl of a fourth seedling was secured to  a little stick, and a glass filament with triangles of paper having been  fixed to one of the cotyledons, its movements were traced on a vertical  glass under a double skylight in the house. The first dot was made at 4.20  P.M. June 20th; and the cotyledon fell till 10.15 P.M. in a nearly straight  line. Just past midnight it was found a little lower and somewhat to one  side. By the early morning, at 3.45 A.M., it had risen greatly, but by 6.20  A.M. had fallen a little. During the whole of this day (21st) it fell in a  slightly zigzag line, but its normal course was disturbed by the want of  sufficient illumination, for during the night it rose only a little, and  travelled irregularly during the whole of the following day and night of  June 22nd. The ascending and descending lines traced during the three days  did not coincide, so that the movement was one of circumnutation. This  seedling was then taken back to the hot-house, and after five days was  inspected at 10 P.M., when the cotyledons were found hanging so nearly  vertically down, that they might justly be said to have been asleep. On the  following morning they had resumed their usual horizontal position.    Oxalis rosea (Oxalideae).--The hypocotyl was secured to a little stick, and  an extremely thin glass filament, with two triangles of paper, was attached  to one of the cotyledons, which was .15 inch in length. In this and the  following species the end of the petiole, where united to the blade, is  developed into a pulvinus. The apex of the cotyledon stood only 5 inches  from the vertical glass, so that its movement was not greatly exaggerated  as long as it remained nearly horizontal; but in the course of the day it  both rose considerably above and fell beneath a horizontal position, and  then of course the movement was much exaggerated.  [page 24]  In Fig. 13 its course is shown from 6.45 A.M. on June 17th, to 7.40 A.M. on  the following morning; and we see that during the daytime, in the course of  11 h. 15 m., it travelled thrice down and twice up. After 5.45 P.M. it  moved rapidly downwards, and in an hour or two depended vertically; it thus  remained all night asleep. This position could not be represented on the  vertical glass nor in the figure here given. By 6.40 A.M. on the following  morning (18th) both cotyledons had risen greatly, and they continued to  rise until 8 A.M., when they stood almost horizontally. Their movement was  traced during the whole of this day and until the next morning; but a  tracing is not given, as it was closely similar to Fig. 13, excepting that  the lines were more zigzag. The cotyledons moved 7 times, either upwards or  downwards; and at about 4 P.M. the great nocturnal sinking movement  commenced.    Fig. 13. Oxalis rosea: circumnutation of cotyledons, the hypocotyl being  secured to a stick; illuminated from above. Figure here given one-half of  original scale.    Another seedling was observed in a similar manner during nearly 24 h., but  with the difference that the hypocotyl was left free. The movement also was  less magnified. Between 8.12 A.M. and 5 P.M. on the 18th, the apex of the  cotyledon moved 7 times upwards or downwards (Fig. 14). The nocturnal  sinking movement, which is merely a great increase of one of the diurnal  oscillations, commenced about 4 P.M.    Oxalis Valdiviana.--This species is interesting, as the coty-  [page 25]  ledons rise perpendicularly upwards at night so as to come into close  contact, instead of sinking vertically downwards, as in the case of O.  rosea. A glass filament was fixed to a cotyledon, .17 of an inch in length,  and the hypocotyl was left free. On    Fig. 14. Oxalis rosea: conjoint circumnutation of the cotyledons and  hypocotyl, traced from 8.12 A.M. on June 18th to 7.30 A.M. 19th. The apex  of the cotyledon stood only 3 3/4 inches from the vertical glass. Figure  here given one-half of original scale.    Fig. 15. Oxalis Valdiviana: conjoint circumnutation of a cotyledon and the  hypocotyl, traced on vertical glass, during 24 hours. Figure here given  one-half of original scale; seedling illuminated from above.    the first day the seedling was placed too far from the vertical glass; so  that the tracing was enormously exaggerated and the movement could not be  traced when the cotyledon either rose or sank much; but it was clearly seen  that the cotyledons rose thrice and fell twice between 8.15 A.M. and 4.15  P.M. Early on the following morning (June 19th) the apex of a cotyledon was  [page 26]  placed only 1 7/8 inch from the vertical glass. At 6.40 A.M. it stood  horizontally; it then fell till 8.35, and then rose. Altogether in the  course of 12 h. it rose thrice and fell thrice, as may be seen in Fig. 15.  The great nocturnal rise of the cotyledons usually commences about 4 or 5  P.M., and on the following morning they are expanded or stand horizontally  at about 6.30 A.M. In the present instance, however, the great nocturnal  rise did not commence till 7 P.M.; but this was due to the hypocotyl having  from some unknown cause temporarily bent to the left side, as is shown in  the tracing. To ascertain positively that the hypocotyl circumnutated, a  mark was placed at 8.15 P.M. behind the two now closed and vertical  cotyledons; and the movement of a glass filament fixed upright to the top  of the hypocotyl was traced until 10.40 P.M. During this time it moved from  side to side, as well as backwards and forwards, plainly showing  circumnutation; but the movement was small in extent. Therefore Fig. 15  represents fairly well the movements of the cotyledons alone, with the  exception of the one great afternoon curvature to the left.    Oxalis corniculata (var. cuprea).--The cotyledons rise at night to a  variable degree above the horizon, generally about 45o: those on some  seedlings between 2 and 5 days old were found to be in continued movement  all day long; but the movements were more simple than in the last two  species. This may have partly resulted from their not being sufficiently  illuminated whilst being observed, as was shown by their not beginning to  rise until very late in the evening.    Oxalis (Biophytum) sensitiva.--The cotyledons are highly remarkable from  the amplitude and rapidity of their movements during the day. The angles at  which they stood above or beneath the horizon were measured at short  intervals of time; and we regret that their course was not traced during  the whole day. We will give only a few of the measurements, which were made  whilst the seedlings were exposed to a temperature of 22 1/2o to 24 ½  decrees C. One cotyledon rose 70o in 11 m.; another, on a distinct  seedling, fell 80o in 12 m. Immediately before this latter fall the same  cotyledon had risen from a vertically downward to a vertically upward  position in 1 h. 48 m., and had therefore passed through 180o in under 2 h.  We have met with no other instance of a circumnutating movement of such  great amplitude as 180o; nor of such rapidity of movement as the passage  through 80o in 12 m. The cotyledons of this plant sleep at night by rising  [page 27]  vertically and coming into close contact. This upward movement differs from  one of the great diurnal oscillations above described only by the position  being permanent during the night and by its periodicity, as it always  commences late in the evening.    Tropaeolum minus (?) (var. Tom Thumb) (Tropaeoleae).--The cotyledons are  hypogean, or never rise above the ground. By removing the soil a buried  epicotyl or plumule was found, with its summit arched abruptly downwards,  like the arched hypocotyl of the cabbage previously described. A glass  filament with a bead at its end was affixed to the basal half or leg, just  above the hypogean cotyledons, which were again almost surrounded by loose  earth. The tracing (Fig. 16) shows the course of the bead during 11 h.  After the last dot given in the figure, the bead moved to a great distance,  and finally off the glass, in the direction indicated by the broken line.

Thieves and villains, you shameless things!  Black your record as black your wings.    Tell me, birds of the inky hue,  Plunderous rogues--to-day have you    Seen with mischievous, prying eyes  Lands where earlier suns arise?    Saw you a lazy beck between  Trees that shadow its breast in green,    Teased by obstinate stones that lie  Crossing the current tauntingly?    Fields abloom on the farther side  With purpling clover lying wide--    Saw you there as you circled by,  Vale-environed a cottage lie,    Girt about with emerald bands,  Nestling down in its meadow lands?    Saw you this on your thieving raids?  Speak--you rascally renegades!    Thieved you also away from me  Olden scenes that I long to see?    If, O! crows, you have flown since morn  Over the place where I was born,    Forget will I, how black you were  Since dawn, in feather and character;    Absolve will I, your vagrant band  Ere you enter your slumberland.        THE SONG MY PADDLE SINGS      West wind, blow from your prairie nest,  Blow from the mountains, blow from the west.  The sail is idle, the sailor too;  O! wind of the west, we wait for you.  Blow, blow!  I have wooed you so,  But never a favour you bestow.  You rock your cradle the hills between,  But scorn to notice my white lateen.    I stow the sail, unship the mast:  I wooed you long but my wooing's past;  My paddle will lull you into rest.  O! drowsy wind of the drowsy west,  Sleep, sleep,  By your mountain steep,  Or down where the prairie grasses sweep!  Now fold in slumber your laggard wings,  For soft is the song my paddle sings.    August is laughing across the sky,  Laughing while paddle, canoe and I,  Drift, drift,  Where the hills uplift  On either side of the current swift.    The river rolls in its rocky bed;  My paddle is plying its way ahead;  Dip, dip,  While the waters flip  In foam as over their breast we slip.    And oh, the river runs swifter now;  The eddies circle about my bow.  Swirl, swirl!  How the ripples curl  In many a dangerous pool awhirl!    And forward far the rapids roar,  Fretting their margin for evermore.  Dash, dash,  With a mighty crash,  They seethe, and boil, and bound, and splash.    Be strong, O paddle! be brave, canoe!  The reckless waves you must plunge into.  Reel, reel.  On your trembling keel,  But never a fear my craft will feel.    We've raced the rapid, we're far ahead!  The river slips through its silent bed.  Sway, sway,  As the bubbles spray  And fall in tinkling tunes away.    And up on the hills against the sky,  A fir tree rocking its lullaby,  Swings, swings,  Its emerald wings,  Swelling the song that my paddle sings.        THE CAMPER      Night 'neath the northern skies, lone, black, and grim:  Naught but the starlight lies 'twixt heaven, and him.    Of man no need has he, of God, no prayer;  He and his Deity are brothers there.    Above his bivouac the firs fling down  Through branches gaunt and black, their needles brown.    Afar some mountain streams, rockbound and fleet,  Sing themselves through his dreams in cadence sweet,    The pine trees whispering, the heron's cry,  The plover's passing wing, his lullaby.    And blinking overhead the white stars keep  Watch o'er his hemlock bed--his sinless sleep.        AT HUSKING TIME      At husking time the tassel fades  To brown above the yellow blades,    Whose rustling sheath enswathes the corn    That bursts its chrysalis in scorn  Longer to lie in prison shades.    Among the merry lads and maids  The creaking ox-cart slowly wades  Twixt stalks and stubble, sacked and torn  At husking time.    The prying pilot crow persuades  The flock to join in thieving raids;  The sly racoon with craft inborn  His portion steals; from plenty's horn  His pouch the saucy chipmunk lades  At husking time.        WORKWORN      Across the street, an humble woman lives;  To her 'tis little fortune ever gives;  Denied the wines of life, it puzzles me  To know how she can laugh so cheerily.  This morn I listened to her softly sing,  And, marvelling what this effect could bring  I looked: 'twas but the presence of a child  Who passed her gate, and looking in, had smiled.  But self-encrusted, I had failed to see  The child had also looked and laughed to me.  My lowly neighbour thought the smile God-sent,  And singing, through the toilsome hours she went.  O! weary singer, I have learned the wrong  Of taking gifts, and giving naught of song;  I thought my blessings scant, my mercies few,  Till I contrasted them with yours, and you;  To-day I counted much, yet wished it more--  While but a child's bright smile was all your store,    If I had thought of all the stormy days,  That fill some lives that tread less favoured ways,  How little sunshine through their shadows gleamed,  My own dull life had much the brighter seemed;  If I had thought of all the eyes that weep  Through desolation, and still smiling keep,  That see so little pleasure, so much woe,  My own had laughed more often long ago;  If I had thought how leaden was the weight  Adversity lays at my kinsman's gate,  Of that great cross my next door neighbour bears,  My thanks had been more frequent in my prayers;  If I had watched the woman o'er the way,  Workworn and old, who labours day by day,  Who has no rest, no joy to call her own,  My tasks, my heart, had much the lighter grown.        EASTER      April 1, 1888    Lent gathers up her cloak of sombre shading    In her reluctant hands.  Her beauty heightens, fairest in its fading,    As pensively she stands  Awaiting Easter's benediction falling,    Like silver stars at night,  Before she can obey the summons calling    Her to her upward flight,  Awaiting Easter's wings that she must borrow    Ere she can hope to fly--  Those glorious wings that we shall see to-morrow    Against the far, blue sky.  Has not the purple of her vesture's lining    Brought calm and rest to all?  Has her dark robe had naught of golden shining    Been naught but pleasure's pall?  Who knows? Perhaps when to the world returning    In youth's light joyousness,  We'll wear some rarer jewels we found burning    In Lent's black-bordered dress.  So hand in hand with fitful March she lingers    To beg the crowning grace  Of lifting with her pure and holy fingers    The veil from April's face.  Sweet, rosy April--laughing, sighing, waiting    Until the gateway swings,  And she and Lent can kiss between the grating    Of Easter's tissue wings.  Too brief the bliss--the parting comes with sorrow.    Good-bye dear Lent, good-bye!  We'll watch your fading wings outlined to-morrow    Against the far blue sky.        ERIE WATERS      A dash of yellow sand,  Wind-scattered and sun-tanned;  Some waves that curl and cream along the margin of the strand;  And, creeping close to these  Long shores that lounge at ease,  Old Erie rocks and ripples to a fresh sou'-western breeze.    A sky of blue and grey;  Some stormy clouds that play  At scurrying up with ragged edge, then laughing blow away,  Just leaving in their trail  Some snatches of a gale;  To whistling summer winds we lift a single daring sail.    O! wind so sweet and swift,  O! danger-freighted gift  Bestowed on Erie with her waves that foam and fall and lift,  We laugh in your wild face,  And break into a race  With flying clouds and tossing gulls that weave and interlace.        THE FLIGHT OF THE CROWS      The autumn afternoon is dying o'er    The quiet western valley where I lie  Beneath the maples on the river shore,    Where tinted leaves, blue waters and fair sky    Environ all; and far above some birds are flying by    To seek their evening haven in the breast    And calm embrace of silence, while they sing  Te Deums to the night, invoking rest    For busy chirping voice and tired wing--    And in the hush of sleeping trees their sleeping cradles swing.    In forest arms the night will soonest creep,    Where sombre pines a lullaby intone,  Where Nature's children curl themselves to sleep,    And all is still at last, save where alone    A band of black, belated crows arrive from lands unknown.    Strange sojourn has been theirs "]]]
