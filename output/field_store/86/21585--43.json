Men in every grade of life take a pleasure in  hunting out rare species of plants, animals, or minerals, in the remotest  districts of the globe, which they transmit to their own country, or  publish such observations respecting them as may make them available for  science, handicraft-industry, or commerce. By these incidental voluntary  contributions to the general stock, England now possesses scientific  collections such as hardly any nation can hope to keep up short of an  enormous expense. These endeavours, it is true, are considerably favoured  and supported by the fact of British colonies being scattered over the  entire earth, but even in this respect it must be conceded that it is  through her own meritorious, unselfish policy that circumstances thus  combine to aid her efforts in this peculiar direction.    Wulongong is a hamlet consisting of a few streets, and its principal  resources seem to be in the visits of the Sydneyites, who come hither for  sea-bathing. Already the existence of several hotels, which, considering  the size of the place, are unusually elegant and extensive, but at the  same time extremely costly, shows that Wulongong must be rather  extensively patronized by the inhabitants of the capital, with which it  has regular communication by small steamers, making the voyage in a few  hours. Unfortunately Wulongong has no convenient harbour, but only a small  exposed roadstead, rendered barely safe for a few small vessels by a stone  bulwark, so that in the event of rough weather the landing and embarkation  of visitors is attended with much discomfort.    We alighted at the Brighton Hotel, prettily situated on the sea-coast, and  met here our newly-acquired Australian friend, Mr. Edward Hill, a  brother-in-law of Sir D. Cooper's, who, with his usual kindness and  forethought, had made all possible preparations for ensuring that our  further flying visit to the Illawara district should be one of the most  memorable episodes of our stay in the colony. Mr. Hill, an Australian by  birth, may, through the peculiar circumstances of his life, his striking  observations on and profound sympathy with the blacks, be considered one  of those most profoundly acquainted with that remarkable race, whose  idiom, as spoken in this district, he can converse in with the utmost  fluency. For this gentleman's attention we were indebted not merely for  repeated opportunities of intercourse with the natives, but also for the  excitement, to us thoroughly novel, of a kangaroo-hunt.    A number of natives were living in an improvised sort of settlement  outside the town, and camped around the forest under low sheds of bark. At  a little distance off Mr. Hill uttered a sharp, shrill whistle, which was  immediately responded to from the forest. Presently two young natives made  their appearance, and shook hands with Mr. Hill. An old man with grey hair  remained cowering upon the ground without stirring. There were altogether  four men, two women, and two children, all pretty well made, their skin of  a black or dull brown hue, broad nostrils, and black crisp hair, which,  however, had nothing woolly in its texture. One of the women carried a  child, whose features and complexion were obviously the result of white  parentage on one side. However, she did not seem, as is the case with  other races that are proud of their colour, to be looked down upon on that  account by her own race, who, so low is their standard of morality, rather  consider it an honour for a black woman to bear a child to a white. Men  and women alike showed on their skins the protuberant cicatrices of  artificial incisions, two or three inches long, chiefly on the breast,  arms, and back.    All the male natives with whom we conversed had had the upper central  teeth knocked out, such being one distinguishing mark of their having  attained the dignity of manhood!    The abundance of mustachio and beard of the Australian savages is a marked  peculiarity, which none of their cognate races east or west have in common  with them. We were also told that they value the beard as their highest  ornament, and make it one of the great objects of their life to tend it.  No man of their race dare marry or kill an emu till he can show a beard,  to which also great virtue is attached in battle. None of these natives  understand the use of the Boomerang.[16]    The natives around Port Jackson and in the Illawara district have,  generally speaking, little of the aboriginal about them, and their abject  misery and addiction to drink make them pitiable and disgusting objects;  for their present hopeless state is in great measure attributable to their  contact with civilization, which has made them neither intelligent nor  industrious. The natives, however, of the banks of the Murray, Clarence,  and Brisbane rivers, though of the same race, are of a very different  appearance. They keep up the habits of their ancestors, and seldom come in  contact with civilization, and even then only with its pioneers, the  squatters and shepherds. Among these the customs of circumcision and  unlimited polygamy are universal, each man having as many wives as he can  steal or support. Owing, however, to their nomad life, this system is  practised to but a limited extent. Infanticide, especially of female  children, is of very frequent occurrence. Abortion is also so frequently  practised that they have a word (_Mibra_) to express it! On the other  hand, we read in Count Strzelecki's valuable work that \"the female natives  after illicit commerce with a white man become barren for their own race,\"  which, according to all unbiased observers, is a complete delusion.    In no part of Australia do the natives cultivate the soil. Nomad as is  their mode of life, they live almost exclusively on the products of the  chase, or of the deep, according as they live in the interior or on the  coast. Lizards, snakes, and insects, and some few roots and resinous  substances, form the delicacies of their primitive cookery.    Their dwellings are either natural cavities in the rock, or a few pieces  of bark fixed into the ground at either end, and arched upwards in the  middle. Throughout New South Wales the custom prevails, when a native dies  young, of burying him under a shallow mound of earth, only the elders  possessing the privilege of being consumed with fire. In the latter case  the corpse of the deceased, with his hunting and fishing implements, is  placed on a pile of dry wood about three feet high, with his face towards  the rising sun. This is covered by the surviving relatives with straw and  wood, who then set fire to the funeral pyre. Some days later the ashes and  calcined bones are collected and burnt. The name of the dead is never  again pronounced, any individual of the same tribe, who may also happen to  bear it, being compelled to exchange it for another.    The prevalence of cannibalism is a well-established fact among the natives  of the north. M. Angas, amongst other interesting particulars, mentioned  one case, where a boy died in the vicinity of Moreton Bay, whose head and  skin, according to the savage habits of the natives, were separated from  the rest of his body and dried over a fire. The father and mother were  both present and uttered loud cries. The heart, liver, and entrails were  divided among the warriors, who carried away with them pieces stuck on  their bone-pointed spears; while the upper part of the thigh (apparently  the tit-bit) was roasted and eaten by the parents themselves! The skin,  the skull, and the bones were, on the other hand, carefully packed up and  taken away with them in their grass sacks. It is not unusual for a mother  to devour her own child, that she may thereby regain the strength which  the fruit of her womb has abstracted from her! When a warrior of a hostile  tribe falls into their hands they celebrate his sacrifice with savage  glee, by rubbing their bodies with the fat around their victim's kidneys,  by which means they believe they strengthen their muscles and inspire  their hearts with courage. In the southern parts of Australia the natives  use human skulls as drinking cups, and one instance is on record where a  portion of a human skeleton was habitually used by an entire race as a  tool. Each woman has one of these bone calabashes, which she usually has  hollowed-out and manufactured herself. In the tolerably comprehensive  ethnographic collection of the Australian Museum we saw several examples  of these hideous drinking vessels! With respect to the idea of a future  life, or the immortality of the soul, the natives seem to have very  contracted notions, principally confined to a superstitious dread of evil  spirits, and to the very singular notion that after death they are  converted into whites, and that the Englishmen who now people their  hunting grounds are the spirits of their ancestors thus transformed!    At various parts of the colony, especially among the outlying mountains  and bare rocks adjoining Middle Harbour, Camp Cove, Point Piper, Mossman's  Cove, Lang's Cove, &c., the eye is attracted by numbers of rude sculptures  hewn in the stone, which usually represent terrestrial objects, such as  kangaroos, emus, flying-squirrels, fish, tortoises, and, above all,  numerous representations of natives performing the _Coroborry_. This is a  sort of war-dance, in which those who participate usually paint their  bodies with white lines, like a skeleton, and seen through the obscurity  of night, leaping around a faint fire, have the appearance of a set of  dead bodies dancing.    If we ask any of the black men of the present generation the significance  of these rock sculptures, they usually"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38480"],[0,"Scientific American, Vol. XXXIX.—No. 24. [New Series.], December 14, 1878 (#6)"],[1,"of flavors in  widely different families. Again, the young leaves of cucumbers have a  striking likeness in the way of flavor to that of the fruit. The  same may be affirmed of carrot tops, while in most gardens there is  a prodigious waste of celery flavor in the sacrifice of the external  leaves and their partially blanched footstalks. Scores of celery are  cut up into soup, when the outsides would flavor it equally well or  better. The young leaves of gooseberries added to bottled fruit give  a fresher flavor and a greener color to pies and tarts. The leaves of  the flowering currant give a sort of intermediate flavor between black  currants and red. Orange, citron, and lemon leaves impart a flavoring  equal to that of the fruit and rind combined, and somewhat different  from both. A few leaves added to pies, or boiled in the milk used to  bake with rice, or formed into crusts or paste impart an admirable and  almost inimitable bouquet. In short, leaves are not half so much used  for seasoning purposes as they might be.\"           *       *       *       *       *          NEW SHUTTER FASTENER.      We give herewith an engraving of a new shutter fastener, recently  patented by Mr. P. F. Fernandez, of San Juan, Porto Rico, West Indies.  This fastener is designed for holding doors or window shutters in  position when open, to prevent them from closing or swinging in the  wind.    [Illustration: IMPROVED SHUTTER FASTENER.]    To the wall is secured a plate to which is pivoted the spring-acted  hook, A, and upon the shutter in the proper position for engaging the  hook, A, there is a rigid hook, B. A coil spring is attached to the  plate that supports the hook, A, and when the shutter is open is  engaged by a boss formed on the end of the hook, B. By this means the  hook, B, is pressed forward into close contact with hook, A, thereby  preventing all jarring and rattling.    The hook, A, is provided with an eye for receiving the cord, C, which  extends to the window casing and is within easy reach, so that when  it is desired to close the shutter the hook, A, may be readily  disengaged from the hook, B, by simply pulling the cord.    Further information may be obtained by addressing the inventor as  above.           *       *       *       *       *          AN IMPROVED GARDEN SPRINKLER.      A novel garden sprinkler, which may be carried on the back, is shown  in the accompanying engraving. The cylindrical vessel has a removable  cover, and contains a perforated plunger which is operated by a hand  lever from without. The cylindrical vessel is provided with shoulder  straps, and it has two sprinkling nozzles connected with it by  flexible tubes.    [Illustration: HODEL & STAUBER'S GARDEN SPRINKLER.]    This sprinkler is especially designed for applying insect-destroying  poison to plants. The operator, as he goes through the field or  garden, takes one nozzle in each hand and distributes the liquid upon  the plants. From time to time the liquid will be agitated by moving  the perforated plunger.    This invention was recently patented by Adolf Hodel, of Jefferson, and  F. A. Stauber, of Chicago, Ill.           *       *       *       *       *          A NEW FOOT POWER.      In our issue of November 9 we illustrated and described a sewing  machine having W. F. Lane's improved foot power applied. We give  herewith views of the foot power in detail, Fig. 1 being a side  elevation, and Figs. 2 and 3 sectional views. The device is designed  for application to any light machinery that can be propelled by  foot power. A is the shaft to which motion is to be imparted by the  treadles, B, the latter being pivoted to oscillate on the shaft,  H. Two ratchet wheels, C, are secured to the shaft, A, and are each  worked by pawls, D, which are pivoted to a carrier, E, which turns  loosely on the shaft. The pawls are in the form of an elbow lever, and  the movement of their tooth ends is limited by lugs or shoulders on  the carrier, E. The outer ends of the pawls are received between lugs  that project from the plate, F, which turns loosely on the shaft,  A, and has attached to it the rope pulley, G. When the plate, F, is  turned in one direction the pawls are raised and ride loosely over  the teeth, but when the plate turns in the other direction the pawls  engage the ratchet teeth and carry them and also the shaft, A. A  guide pulley, I, is pivoted below the shaft, A, with its axis at right  angles to the shaft.    The motion from the alternately-oscillated treadles, B, is transmitted  to the pulleys, G, by means of a rope (shown in dotted lines), both  ends of which are fastened by hooks to some fixed point. This rope  runs from one of the hooks down under a pulley pivoted in the toe  of one of the treadles, thence around one of the pulleys, G, thence  around the pulley, I, over the other pulley, G, and downward around  the pulley in the other treadle, and upward to the second fixed hook.  The depression of one of the treadles causes the shaft to rotate, and  also lifts the other treadle into position to be operated.    [Illustration: LANE'S FOOT POWER.]    For further information address Wm. F. Lane, Elgin, Ill.           *       *       *       *       *          NEW INVENTIONS.      Mr. Samuel Heaton, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, has patented an improved  Iron Fence Post, which is particularly adapted for wire fences. It  is formed of a slotted iron bar, constituting the post proper, and a  triangular brace, which is so connected with said bar that it may be  easily adjusted at different angles, corresponding to the undulation  or unevenness of the ground surface where the post is used.    Mr. Thomas S. Alexander, of Meriden, Conn., has patented an improved  Drawer Pull, which is neat, strong, and durable, and is less expensive  than when made in the usual way.    An improved Earth Scraper has been patented by Mr. Benjamin Slusser,  of Sidney, Ohio. This is an improvement in that class of earth  scrapers which are arranged to revolve for the purpose of dumping the  load, and during the intervals, or while being filled, are locked in  rigid position.    An improvement in Wagon Bodies has been patented by Mr. James H.  Paschal, of Camden, Ark. This invention consists, essentially, in a  frame provided with spurs projecting therefrom for engagement with the  bales to prevent them from slipping, and the combination therewith of  removable extension side and end pieces, for enabling the wagon to be  used for other purposes when not employed for hauling cotton bales;  there is an extension of the frame forming a feed trough for the  horses employed to draw the vehicle.    An improved Scraper has been patented by Mr. George Eiteman, of Round  Grove, Ill. This is a double-ended scraper hung at its center on a rod  connected to the handle arms, whereby either end of the scraper may be  used. It has catches to prevent the scraper from revolving backward,  and spring actuated dogs on the handle frame to retain the scraper in  position and prevent it from turning over until released.           *       *       *       *       *          AMATEUR MECHANICS.      For amusement, exercise, and profit we commend, to those who are  mechanically inclined, the practice of working with tools of the  smaller sort, either in wood or other of the softer materials, or in  metals, glass, or stone. This practice renders the hands dexterous,  the muscles strong, and the head clear, with the further advantage of  producing something for either ornament or use. Of course a bench with  a vise and a few wood working and iron working tools will be required;  but the most expensive as well as the most essential tool is a lathe.  With this tool, not only turning in wood, metal, ivory, rubber, etc.,  can be accomplished, but it may also be used for screw-thread cutting,  gear cutting, drilling metals, boring wood, spinning metals, milling,  sawing metal and wood, grinding, polishing, moulding, shaping, and  other purposes. A first class plain lathe of small size cannot be  purchased for less than $50 or $60, and one of inferior quality will  cost $20 to $30.    While the purchase of a lathe is recommended there may be many who  would prefer to make one. A lathe that will do admirably and which  may be easily made is shown in the accompanying engravings, Fig.  1 representing in perspective the lathe complete; Fig. 2 is a  perspective view of the lathe without the table; Fig. 3 is a vertical  longitudinal section of the lathe, showing the manner of securing the  head and tail stocks to the bars which form the bed or shears.    In making this lathe one pattern only will be required for the two  standards of the head stock, and the support of the ends of the bars.  The lower part of the tail stock is made in two parts, so that they  may be clamped tightly together on the shears by means of the bolt  that passes through both parts, and is provided with a nut having  a lever handle. The rest support is also made in two parts, clamped  together on the ways in a similar way.    The patterns may be easily sawed from 11/4 inch pine. The holes that  receive the round bars should be chambered to receive Babbitt metal,  used in making the fit around the bars forming the shears, around the  head and tail spindles, and around the shank of the tool rest. The  smallest diameter of the holes that receive the round bars should be a  little less than that of the bars, so that the several pieces that  are placed on the bars may be fitted to hold them in place while the  Babbitt metal is poured in.    The dimensions of the lathe are as follows:    Length of round bars forming shears, 24 inches; diameter of bars, 1  inch; distance from the upper side of upper bar to center of spindle,  3 inches; between bars, 3/4 inch; between standards that support the  live spindle, 31/2 inches; size of standard above shears, 3/4 x 11/4  inch; diameter of head and tail spindles, 3/4 inch;"]]]
