We'll play that  you can't see me, if you like.\"    \"Well, but we can't,\" said Gerald. \"It's no use getting in a wax. If  you're hiding, as Jimmy says, you'd better come out. If you've  really turned invisible, you'd better make yourself visible again.\"    \"Do you really mean,\" asked a voice quite changed, but still the  Princess's, \"that you can't see me?\"    \"Can't you see we can't?\" asked Jimmy rather unreasonably.    The sun was blazing in at the window; the eight-sided room was  very hot, and everyone was getting cross.    \"You can't see me?\" There was the sound of a sob in the voice of  the invisible Princess.    \"No, I tell you,\" said Jimmy, \"and I want my tea and \"    What he was saying was broken off short, as one might break a  stick of sealing wax. And then in the golden afternoon a really  quite horrid thing happened: Jimmy suddenly leaned backwards,  then forwards, his eyes opened wide and his mouth too. Backward  and forward he went, very quickly and abruptly, then stood still.    \"Oh, he's in a fit! Oh, Jimmy, dear Jimmy!\" cried Kathleen,  hurrying to him. \"What is it, dear, what is it?\"    \"It's not a fit,\" gasped Jimmy angrily. \"She shook me.\"    \"Yes, said the voice of the Princess, \"and I'll shake him again if he  keeps on saying he can't see me.\"    \"You'd better shake me,\" said Gerald angrily. \"I'm nearer your own  size.\"    And instantly she did. But not for long. The moment Gerald felt  hands on his shoulders he put up his own and caught those other  hands by the wrists. And there he was, holding wrists that he  couldn't see. It was a dreadful sensation. An invisible kick made  him wince, but he held tight to the wrists.    \"Cathy,\" he cried, \"come and hold her legs; she's kicking me.\"    \"Where?\" cried Kathleen, anxious to help. \"I don't see any legs.\"    \"This is her hands I've got,\" cried Gerald. \"She is invisible right  enough. Get hold of this hand, and then you can feel your way  down to her legs.\"    Kathleen did so. I wish I could make you understand how very,  very uncomfortable and frightening it is to feel, in broad daylight,  hands and arms that you can't see.    \"I won't have you hold my legs,\" said the invisible Princess,  struggling violently.    \"What are you so cross about?\" Gerald was quite calm. \"You said  you'd be invisible and you are.\"    \"I'm not.\"    \"You are really. Look in the glass.\"    \"I'm not; I can't be.\"    \"Look in the glass,\" Gerald repeated, quite unmoved.    \"Let go, then,\" she said.    Gerald did, and the moment he had done so he found it impossible  to believe that he really had been holding invisible hands.    \"You're just pretending not to see me,\" said the Princess anxiously,  \"aren't you? Do say you are. You've had your joke with me. Don't  keep it up. I don't like it.\"    \"On our sacred word of honour,\" said Gerald, \"you're still invisible.    There was a silence. Then, \"Come,\" said the Princess. \"I'll let you  out, and you can go. I'm tired of playing with you.\"    They followed her voice to the door, and through it, and along the  little passage into the hall. No one said anything. Everyone felt  very uncomfortable.    \"Let's get out of this,\" whispered Jimmy as they got to the end of  the hall.    But the voice of the Princess said: \"Come out this way; it's quicker.  I think you're perfectly hateful. I'm sorry I ever played with you.  Mother always told me not to play with strange children.\"    A door abruptly opened, though no hand was seen to touch it.  \"Come through, can't you!\" said the voice of the Princess.    It was a little ante-room, with long, narrow mirrors between its  long, narrow windows.    \"Good-bye, said Gerald. \"Thanks for giving us such a jolly time.  Let's part friends, he added, holding out his hand.    An unseen hand was slowly put in his, which closed on it,  vice-like.    \"Now,\" he said, \"you've jolly well got to look in the glass and own  that we're not liars.\"    He led the invisible Princess to. one of the mirrors, and held her in  front of it by the shoulders.    \"Now,\" he said, \"you just look for yourself.\" There was a silence,  and then a cry of despair rang through the room.    \"Oh oh oh! I am invisible. Whatever shall I do?\"    \"Take the ring off,\" said Kathleen, suddenly practical.    Another silence.    \"I can't!\" cried the Princess. \"It won't come off. But it can't be the  ring; rings don't make you invisible.\"    \"You said this one did,\" said Kathleen, \"and it has.\"    \"But it can't,\" said the Princess. \"I was only playing at magic. I just  hid in the secret cupboard it was only a game. Oh, whatever shall I  do?\"    \"A game?\" said Gerald slowly; \"but you can do magic  the  invisible jewels, and you made them come visible.\"    \"Oh, it's only a secret spring and the panelling slides up. Oh, what  am I to do?\"    Kathleen moved towards the voice and gropingly got her arms  round a pink-silk waist that she couldn't see. Invisible arms clasped  her, a hot invisible cheek was laid against hers, and warm invisible  tears lay wet between the two faces.    \"Don't cry, dear,\" said Kathleen; \"let me go and tell the King and  Queen.\"    \"The ?\"    \"Your royal father and mother.\"    \"Oh, don't mock me!\" said the poor Princess. \"You know that was  only a game, too, like ,\"    \"Like the bread and cheese,\" said Jimmy triumphantly. \"I knew  that was!\"    \"But your dress and being asleep in the maze, and ,\"    \"Oh, I dressed up for fun, because everyone's away at the fair, and I  put the clew just to make it all more real. I was playing at Fair  Rosamond first, and then I heard you talking in the maze, and I  thought what fun; and now I'm invisible, and I shall never come  right again, never I know I shan't! It serves me right for lying, but I  didn't really think you'd believe it  not more than half, that is,\" she  added hastily, trying to be truthful.    \"But if you're not the Princess, who are you?\" asked Kathleen, still  embracing the unseen.    \"I'm my aunt lives here,\" said the invisible Princess. \"She may be  home any time. Oh, what shall I do?\"    \"Perhaps she knows some charm \"    \"Oh, nonsense!\" said the voice sharply; \"she doesn't believe in  charms. She would be so vexed. Oh, I daren't let her see me like  this!\" she added wildly.    \"And all of you here, too. She'd be so dreadfully cross.\"    The beautiful magic castle that the children had believed in now  felt as though it were tumbling about their ears. All that was left  was the invisibleness of the Princess. But that, you will own, was a  good deal.    \"I just said it, moaned the voice, \"and it came true. I wish I'd never  played at magic I wish I'd never played at anything at all.\"    \"Oh, don't say that,\" Gerald said kindly. \"Let's go out into the  garden, near the lake, where it's cool, and we'll hold a solemn  council. You'll like that, won't you?\"    \"Oh!\" cried Kathleen suddenly, \"the buckle; that makes magic  come undone!\"    \"It doesn't really,\" murmured the voice that seemed to speak  without lips. \"I only just said that.\"    \"You only 'just said' about the ring,\" said Gerald. \"Anyhow, let's  try.\"    \"Not you me,\" said the voice. \"You go down to the Temple of  Flora, by the lake. I'll go back to the jewel-room by myself. Aunt  might see you.\"    \"She won't see you,\" said Jimmy.    \"Don't rub it in,\" said Gerald. \"Where is the Temple of Flora?\"    \"That's the way,\" the voice said; \"down those steps and along the  winding path through the shrubbery. You can't miss it. It's white  marble, with a statue goddess inside.\"    The three children went down to the white marble Temple of Flora  that stood close against the side of the little hill, and sat down in  its shadowy inside. It had arches all round except against the hill  behind the statue, and it was cool and restful.    They had not been there five minutes before the feet of a runner  sounded loud on the gravel. A shadow, very black and distinct, fell  on the white marble floor.    \"Your shadow's not invisible, anyhow,\" said Jimmy.    \"Oh, bother my shadow!\" the voice of the Princess replied. \"We  left the key inside the door, and it's shut itself with the wind, and  it's a spring lock!\"    There was a heartfelt pause.    Then Gerald said, in his most business-like manner: \"Sit down,  Princess, and we'll have a thorough good palaver about it.\"    \"I shouldn't wonder,\" said Jimmy, \"if we was to wake up and find  it was dreams.\"    \"No such luck,\" said the voice.    \"Well,\" said Gerald, \"first of all, what's your name, and if you're  not a Princess, who are you?\"    \"I'm I'm,\" said a voice broken with sobs, \"I'm the  housekeeper's  niece at the castle and my name's Mabel Prowse.\"    \"That's exactly what I thought,\" said Jimmy, without a shadow of  truth, because how could he? The others were silent. It was a  moment full of agitation and confused ideas.    \"Well, anyhow,\" said Gerald, \"you belong here.\"    \"Yes,\" said the voice, and it came from the floor, as though its  owner had flung herself down in the madness of despair. \"Oh yes, I  belong here right enough, but what's the use of belonging  anywhere if you're invisible?\"    Those of my readers who have gone about much with an invisible  companion will not need to be told how awkward the whole  business is. For one thing, however much you may have been  convinced that your companion is invisible, you will, I feel sure,  have found yourself every now and then saying, \"This must be a  dream!\" or \"I know I shall wake up in half a sec!\" And this was the  case with Gerald, Kathleen, and Jimmy as they sat in the white  marble Temple of Flora, looking out through its arches at the  sunshiny park and listening to the voice of the enchanted Princess,  who really was not a Princess at all, but just the housekeeper's  niece, Mabel Prowse; though, as Jimmy said, \"she was enchanted,  right enough.\"    \"It's no use talking,\" she said again and again, and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35409"],[0,"Beauty: Illustrated Chiefly (#6)"],[1," to physiologists  and philosophical artists, whose minds pass rapidly from the beauty of  forms to that locomotive, vital, or mental excellence which it compels  them to suppose.    Goodness and beauty in woman will accordingly be found to bear a strict  relation to each other; and the latter will be seen always to be the  external sign of the former.    There are, however (slightly to anticipate what must afterward be  explained), different kinds, both of beauty and of goodness, which are  confounded by vulgar observers; or rather there are beauty and goodness  belonging to different systems of which the body is composed, and which  ought never to be confounded with each other.    Where, consequently, one of these kinds of beauty and of goodness is  wanting, even in a remarkable degree, others may be found; and, as the  vulgar do not distinguish, it is this which leads to the gross error that  these qualities have no strict relations to their signs.    Want of beauty, then, in any one of the systems of which the body is  composed, indicates want of goodness only in that system; but it is not  less a truth, and scarcely of less importance, on that account.--I will  now illustrate this by brief examples.    There may, in any individual, exist deformity of limbs; and this will  assuredly indicate want of goodness in the locomotive system, of that or  general motion. There may exist coarseness of skin, or paleness of  complexion; and either of these will as certainly indicate want of  goodness in the vital system, or that of nutrition. There may exist a  malformation of the brain, externally evident; and this no less certainly  will indicate want of goodness in the mental system, or that of thought.    It follows that even the different kinds and combinations of beauty, which  are the objects of taste to different persons, are founded upon the same  general principle of organic superiority. Nay, even the preferences which,  in beauty, appear to depend most on fancy, depend in reality on that  cause; and the impression which every degree and modification of beauty  makes on mankind, has as a fundamental rule only their sentiment, more or  less delicate and just, of physical advantage in relation to each  individual. Such is the foundation of all our sentiments of admiration and  of love.    The existence or non-existence of these advantages, and the power of  determining this, or the judgment of beauty, are therefore of transcendent  importance to individuals and to families. Such judgment can be attained  by analysis and classification alone. Nothing, therefore, can more nearly  affect all human interests than that analysis and classification of beauty  which are here proposed.    To place beyond a doubt, and to illustrate more minutely, the  extraordinary importance of this subject, as regards advantages real to  the species, I may anticipate some of the more minute applications of my  doctrine.    If, in the locomotive system of the female, much of the delicacy of form,  and the ease and grace of her movements, depend upon the more perfect  development of the muscles of the pelvis, and its easily adapting itself  to great and remarkable changes, how important must be the ability to  determine, even by walk or gesture, the existence of this condition!    If, in the vital system, the elasticity and freshness of the skin are the  characteristics of health, and their absence warns us that the condition  of woman is unfavorable to the plan of nature relatively to the  maintenance of the species--or, if the capacity of the pelvis, and the  consequent breadth of the haunches, are necessary to all those functions  which are most essentially feminine, impregnation, gestation, and  parturition, without danger either to parent or to child--of what extreme  importance must be the ability to determine this with certainty and ease!    If, in the mental system, the capacity and delicacy of the organs of  sense, and the softness and mobility of the nervous system, are necessary  to the vivid and varying sensibility of woman--if it is in consequence of  this, that woman is enabled to act on man by the continual observation of  all that can captivate his imagination or secure his affection, and by the  irresistible seduction of her manners--if it is these qualities which  enable her to accommodate herself to his taste, to yield, without  constraint, even to the caprice of the moment, and to seize the time when  observations, made as it were accidentally, may produce the effect which  she desires--if it is by these means that she fulfils her first duty,  namely, to please him to whom she has united her days, and to attach him  to her and to home by rendering both delightful--if all this is the case,  of what inexpressible importance must be the ability to determine, in each  individual, the possession of the power and the will to produce such  effects!    If (descending to still more minute inquiries) external indications as to  figure are required as to parts concealed by drapery--if such indications  would obviate deception even with regard to those parts of the figure  which are more exposed to observation by the closer adaptation of  dress--if, even when the face is seen, the deception as to the degree of  beauty, is such that a correct estimate of it is perhaps never formed--if  indications as to mind may be derived from many external circumstances--if  external indications as to the personal habits of women are both numerous  and interesting--if such indications even of age and health are sometimes  essential--if all this be the case, let the reader say what other object  of human inquiry exceeds this in importance.    Let us not then deceive ourselves respecting the source of those  impressions which one sex experiences from the sight of the other. It is  evidently nothing else than the more or less delicate and just perception  of a certain conformity of means with a want which has been created by  nature, and which must be satisfied.    \"It is very obvious,\" says Dr. Pritchard, \"that this peculiarity in the  constitution of man must have considerable effects on the physical  character of the race, and that it must act as a constant principle of  improvement, supplying the place in our own kind of the beneficial control  [in the crossing of races] which we exercise over the brute creation.\" And  he adds: \"This is probably the final cause for which the instinctive  perception of human beauty was implanted by Providence in our nature.\"    We need not wonder, then, that the Greeks should have preferred beauty to  all other advantages, should have placed it immediately after virtue in  the order of their affections, or should have made it an object of  worship.    Even the practical application of this principle to the improvement of the  human race is not a matter of conjecture. We have seen both families and  nations ameliorated by the means which it affords. Of this, the Turks are  a striking example. Nothing, therefore, can better deserve the researches  of the physiologist, or the exertions of the philanthropist, than the fact  that there are laws, of which we have yet only a glimpse, according to  which we may influence the amelioration of the human race in a manner the  most extensive and profound, by acting according to a uniform and  uninterrupted system.    Well might Cabanis exclaim: \"After having occupied ourselves so curiously  with the means of rendering more beautiful and better the races of animals  or of plants which are useful or agreeable--after having remodelled a  hundred times that of horses and dogs--after having transplanted, grafted,  cultivated, in all manners, fruits and flowers--how shameful is it to have  totally neglected the race of man! As if it affected us less nearly! as if  it were more essential to have large and strong oxen than vigorous and  healthy men, highly odorous peaches or finely striped tulips, than wise  and good citizens!\"    I actually know a man who is so deeply interested in the doctrine of  crossing, that every hour of his life is devoted to the improvement of a  race of bantam fowls and curious pigeons, and who yet married a mad  woman, whom he confines in a garret, and by whom he has some insane  progeny.    Let it not be imagined that the discovery of the precise laws of crossing  or intermarriage, and the best direction of physical living forces, in  relation both to the vital faculties and to those of the mind, upon which  knowledge and skill may operate for the improvement of our race, is a  matter of difficulty.    It will be shown in this work, that there exist not only an influence of  beauty and defects on offspring, but peculiar laws regulating the  resemblance of progeny to parents--laws which regard the mode in which the  organization of parents affects that of children, or regulates the organs  which each parent respectively bestows.    It will accordingly be shown, that, as, on the size, form, and proportion,  of the various organs, depend their functions, the importance of such laws  is indescribable--whether we regard intermarriages, and that immunity from  mental or bodily disease which, when well directed, they may ensure, or  the determination of the parentage of a child--or the education of  children, in conformity with their faculties--or the employment of men in  society.    I conclude this brief view in the words of the writer just quoted: \"It is  assuredly time for us to attempt to do for ourselves that which we have  done so successfully for several of our companions in existence, to  review and correct this work of nature--a noble enterprise, which truly  merits all our cares, and which nature itself appears to have especially  recommended to us by the sympathies and the powers which it has given  us.\"          CHAPTER II.
