Ulenspiegel also learnt to carve in wood and in stone, for once a  master-mason came to Damme to carve a stall in the choir of Notre  Dame. And this stall was made in such a way that the Dean--who was an  old man--could sit down when he so desired, yet seem to all appearance  as if he were still standing upright.    It was Ulenspiegel too who made the first carved knife-handle ever  used by the people of Zeeland. He fashioned this handle in the form  of a cage. Inside was a death's head that moved; and above it a hound  couchant. And this was the signification: \"Soul true till death.\"    Thus it was that Ulenspiegel began to fulfil the prophecy that  Katheline had made when she said that he would be painter, sculptor,  workman, nobleman, all in one. For you must know that from father to  son the family of Claes bore arms three pint pots argent au naturel  on a ground bruinbier.    But Ulenspiegel would stick to no one profession, and Claes told him  that if he went on in this good-for-nothing way he would chase him  out of the house.              XIV      On his return from the wars, the Emperor wanted to know why his son  Philip was not there to welcome him.    The Archbishop--the royal Governor--said that the child had refused to  leave his solitude and the books which were the only things he loved.    The Emperor asked where he was to be found at the moment. The Governor  did not know exactly, but said they had better go and look for him  somewhere where it was dark. This they did.    When they had looked through a good number of rooms they came at last  to a kind of closet, unpaved and lit only by a skylight. There they  found a stake stuck into the ground, and a dear little monkey bound  to the stake by a cord round the waist. (Now this monkey had been  sent from the Indies as a present to His Highness to amuse him with  its youthful gambols).... Round the bottom of the stake were some  smoking sticks still glowing, and the closet was filled with a foul  smell as of burning hair.    The poor animal had suffered so much pain while being burnt to death  that its little body no longer looked the body of a living animal,  but seemed rather like the fragment of some root, all wrinkled and  distorted. And its mouth, still open with the death-cry, was filled  with froth mixed with blood; and the face was wet with tears.    \"Who has done this?\" said the Emperor.    The Governor did not dare to answer, and the two men stood there  silent, sad, and angry.    All at once, in the silence, there was heard a sound of feeble coughing  that came from a corner in the shadow behind them. His Majesty turned  and beheld Philip, his son, dressed all in black, sucking an orange.    \"Don Philip,\" he said, \"come and greet your father.\"    The child did not move, but gazed at his father with timid eyes that  showed no spark of love.    \"Is it you,\" asked the Emperor, \"who have burnt alive in the fire  this little animal?\"    The child bowed his head.    But the Emperor: \"If you have been cruel enough to do such a deed,  at least be brave enough to own up to it.\"    The child made no answer.    His Majesty seized the orange from the child's hands, threw it to the  ground, and was about to beat his son, who was shaking with terror,  when the Archbishop restrained him, whispering in his ear:    \"The day will surely come when His Highness shall prove a mighty  burner of heretics.\" The Emperor smiled, and the two of them went away,  leaving Philip alone with the monkey.    But others there were, not monkeys, that were destined to meet their  death in the flames....              XV      November was come, the month of hail-storms, when sufferers from cold  in the head abandon themselves freely to their concerts of coughing  and spitting. This also is the month when the turnip-fields are  filled with gangs of youths that there disport themselves and steal  whatever they can, to the mighty wrath of the peasants, who try in  vain to catch them, chasing after them with sticks and pitchforks.    Well, on an evening when Ulenspiegel was returning home from one of  these raids, he heard close by, in a corner of the hedgerow, a sound  as of groaning. He leant down, and beheld a dog lying stretched out  on the stones.    \"Hallo!\" he cried. \"Poor little beast! What are you doing out here  so late at night?\"    He patted the dog, and found that its back was all wet, as though some  one had been trying to drown it. He took it in his arms to warm it,  and when he had reached home he said:    \"I have brought back a wounded animal. What shall we do with it?\"    \"Dress its wounds,\" said Claes.    Ulenspiegel laid the dog on the table; whereupon he and Claes and  Soetkin saw that it was a little red-haired Luxemburg terrier, and that  it was wounded in the back. Soetkin sponged the wounds, and anointed  them with ointment, and bound them up with linen bandages. Then  Ulenspiegel took the dog and put it in his bed; but Soetkin desired  to have it in her own, saying she was afraid that Ulenspiegel would  hurt the little red-haired thing. For in those days Ulenspiegel was  wont to toss about in his sleep all night like a young devil in a  stoup of holy water. Ulenspiegel, however, had his way, and he took  such care of the dog that in the space of six days it was walking  about like any other dog, and giving itself great airs.    And the village schoolmaster christened him Titus Bibulus Schnouffius:  Titus after a certain good Emperor of the Romans who was fond of  befriending lost dogs; Bibulus because the dog loved beer with all  the passion of a confirmed drunkard; and Schnouffius because he would  always run about sniffing and putting his nose into every rat-hole  and mole-hole he could find.              XVI      The young prince of Spain was now fifteen years old, and his custom was  to wander about the rooms and passages and stairways of the castle. But  chiefly was he to be found prowling around the women's quarters,  trying to pick a quarrel with one of the pages, who themselves were  wont to lurk on the look out, like cats, in the corridors; while  others, again, out in the courtyard, would stand singing some tender  ballad, nose in air. When the young prince heard one singing thus,  he would show himself at one of the windows, and the heart of that  poor page would be stricken with fear as he saw that white face there,  instead of the gentle eyes of his beloved.    Now among the Ladies of the Court there was a gentle dame from Dudzeel  near by Damme in Flanders. Fair-fleshed she was, like fine ripe fruit,  and marvellously beautiful, for she had green eyes and reddish hair  all wavy and gleaming gold. And of a gay humour was she, and of an  ardent complexion, nor did she make any effort to conceal her taste  for that fortunate lord to whom for the time being she was pleased  to grant the freedom of the fair estate of her love. Such a one there  was even now, handsome and proud, and she loved him well. Every day,  at a certain hour, she went to find him--a thing which Philip was  not long in finding out.    So, one day, sitting himself down on a bench that stood against a  window, he lay in wait for her, and there she saw him as she passed  by, with her bright eyes and her mouth half open, all meet for love  and fresh from her bath, with the gear of her dress of yellow brocade  swinging about her as she stepped along. Without rising from his seat,  Philip accosted her.    \"Madame,\" says he, \"could you not spare a moment?\"    Restive as some eager mare, stayed in her course towards the gallant  stallion that is neighing for her in the field, the lady made answer:    \"All here must needs obey the royal will of your Highness.\"    \"Then sit you down by my side,\" said the Prince. And gazing at her  lewdly, harshly, cunningly, he spake again:    \"I would have you recite to me the Pater Noster in Flemish. They  taught it me once, but I no longer remember it.\"    The poor lady did as she was bid; and then the Prince commanded her  to say it all over again, but more slowly. And so on, and so on,  until she had recited it ten times over. After that he began to speak  flatteringly to her, praising her beautiful hair, her fresh complexion,  and her bright eyes. But he dared not to say a word concerning her  lovely shoulders or her rounded throat, or of aught else beside.    When at last she was beginning to hope that she might be able to  get away, and was already scanning anxiously the courtyard where her  lord was awaiting her, the Prince demanded of her if she could rightly  tell him what were the several virtues of woman? She answered nothing,  fearing that she might say something to displease him. He then answered  for her, setting the matter forth in this wise:    \"The virtues of woman are these: chastity, regard for her own honour,  and a modest manner of life.\" And he counselled her, therefore,  that she should dress decently and should always be careful to hide  those things which were meet to be hidden. The lady nodded assent,  saying that for His Hyperborean Highness she would certainly take  care to cover herself with ten bear-skins rather than with a single  length of muslin.    Having put him to shame by this answer, she made off gladly.    But in Philip's heart the fire of youth was alight--not the fiery glow  that dares the souls of the brave to lofty deeds, but a dark fire from  hell itself, the fire of Satan. And it flamed in his grey eyes like  the beam of a winter's moon shining down upon a charnel-house. And  it burned within him cruelly....              XVII      Now this beautiful, gay-hearted lady left Valladolid one day for her  Chateau of Dudzeel in Flanders.    Passing through Damme, with her fat attendant behind her, she noticed  a lad of about fifteen years of age sitting against the wall of a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3760"],[0,"Sybil, Or, The Two Nations (#6)"],[1," age, the temper of the country, the great qualities  and the high character of the minister, indicated a long and prosperous  administration. The only individual in his cabinet who, from a  combination of circumstances rather than from any intellectual supremacy  over his colleagues, was competent to be his rival, was content to be  his successor. In his most aspiring moments, Mr Peel in all probability  aimed at no higher reach; and with youth and the leadership of the House  of Commons, one has no reason to be surprised at his moderation.  The conviction that the duke's government would only cease with the  termination of his public career was so general, that the moment he was  installed in office, the whigs smiled on him; political conciliation  became the slang of the day, and the fusion of parties the babble of  clubs and the tattle of boudoirs.    How comes it then that so great a man, in so great a position, should  have so signally failed? Should have broken up his government, wrecked  his party, and so completely annihilated his political position, that,  even with his historical reputation to sustain him, he can since only  re-appear in the councils of his sovereign in a subordinate, not to say  equivocal, character?    With all those great qualities which will secure him a place in our  history not perhaps inferior even to Marlborough, the Duke of Wellington  has one deficiency which has been the stumbling-block of his civil  career. Bishop Burnet, in speculating on the extraordinary influence of  Lord Shaftesbury, and accounting how a statesman, so inconsistent in  his conduct and so false to his confederates, should have so powerfully  controlled his country, observes, \"HIS STRENGTH LAY IN HIS KNOWLEDGE OF  ENGLAND.\"      Now that is exactly the kind of knowledge which the Duke of Wellington  never possessed.    When the king, finding that in Lord Goderich he had a minister who,  instead of deciding, asked his royal master for advice, sent for the  Duke of Wellington to undertake the government, a change in the carriage  of his grace was perceived by some who had the opportunity to form an  opinion on such a subject. If one might venture to use such a word  in reference to such a man, we might remark, that the duke had been  somewhat daunted by the selection of Mr Canning. It disappointed great  hopes, it baffled great plans, and dispelled for a season the conviction  that, it is believed, had been long maturing in his grace's mind; that  he was the man of the age, that his military career had been only a  preparation for a civil course not less illustrious; and that it was  reserved for him to control for the rest of his life undisputed the  destinies of a country, which was indebted to him in no slight degree  for its European pre-eminence. The death of Mr Canning revived, the rout  of Lord Goderich restored, these views.    Napoleon, at St Helena, speculating in conversation on the future career  of his conqueror, asked, \"What will Wellington do? After all he has  done, he will not be content to be quiet. He will change the dynasty.\"    Had the great exile been better acquainted with the real character of  our Venetian constitution, he would have known that to govern England  in 1820, it was not necessary to change its dynasty. But the Emperor,  though wrong in the main, was right by the bye. It was clear that the  energies that had twice entered Paris as a conqueror, and had made kings  and mediatised princes at Vienna, would not be content to subside into  ermined insignificance. The duke commenced his political tactics early.  The cabinet of Lord Liverpool, especially during its latter term, was  the hot-bed of many intrigues; but the obstacles were numerous, though  the appointing fate, in which his grace believed, removed them. The  disappearance of Lord Castlereagh and Mr Canning from the scene was  alike unexpected. The Duke of Wellington was at length prime minister,  and no individual ever occupied that post more conscious of its power,  and more determined to exercise it.    This is not the occasion on which we shall attempt to do justice to a  theme so instructive as the administration of his grace. Treated with  impartiality and sufficient information, it would be an invaluable  contribution to the stores of our political knowledge and national  experience. Throughout its brief but eccentric and tumultuous annals we  see continual proof, how important is that knowledge \"in which lay Lord  Shaftesbury's strength.\" In twenty-four months we find an aristocracy  estranged, without a people being conciliated; while on two several  occasions, first, the prejudices, and then the pretensions of the middle  class, were alike treated with contumely. The public was astonished  at hearing of statesmen of long parliamentary fame, men round whom the  intelligence of the nation had gathered for years with confidence, or  at least with interest, being expelled from the cabinet in a manner not  unworthy of Colonel Joyce, while their places were filled by second-rate  soldiers, whose very names were unknown to the great body of the people,  and who under no circumstances should have aspired beyond the government  of a colony. This administration which commenced in arrogance ended  in panic. There was an interval of perplexity; when occurred the most  ludicrous instance extant of an attempt at coalition; subordinates were  promoted, while negotiations were still pending with their chiefs; and  these negotiations, undertaken so crudely, were terminated in pique; in  a manner which added to political disappointment personal offence. When  even his parasites began to look gloomy, the duke had a specific that  was to restore all, and having allowed every element of power to escape  his grasp, he believed he could balance everything by a beer bill. The  growl of reform was heard but it was not very fierce. There was yet time  to save himself. His grace precipitated a revolution which might have  been delayed for half a century, and never need have occurred in  so aggravated a form. He rather fled than retired. He commenced his  ministry like Brennus, and finished it like the tall Gaul sent to murder  the rival of Sylla, but who dropped his weapon before the undaunted gaze  of his intended victim.    Lord Marney was spared the pang of the catastrophe. Promoted to a high  office in the household, and still hoping that, by the aid of his party,  it was yet destined for him to achieve the hereditary purpose of his  family, he died in the full faith of dukism; worshipping the duke and  believing that ultimately he should himself become a duke. It was under  all the circumstances an euthanasia; he expired leaning as it were on  his white wand and babbling of strawberry leaves.          Book 1 Chapter 4        \"My dear Charles,\" said Lady Marney to Egremont the morning after the  Derby, as breakfasting with her in her boudoir he detailed some of the  circumstances of the race, \"we must forget your naughty horse. I  sent you a little note this morning, because I wished to see you most  particularly before you went out. Affairs,\" continued Lady Marney, first  looking round the chamber to see whether there were any fairy listening  to her state secrets, \"affairs are critical.\"    \"No doubt of that,\" thought Egremont, the horrid phantom of settling-day  seeming to obtrude itself between his mother and himself; but not  knowing precisely at what she was driving, he merely sipped his tea, and  innocently replied, \"Why?\"    \"There will be a dissolution,\" said Lady Marney.    \"What are we coming in?\"    Lady Marney shook her head.    \"The present men will not better their majority,\" said Egremont.    \"I hope not,\" said Lady Marney.    \"Why you always said, that with another general election we must come  in, whoever dissolved.\"    \"But that was with the court in our favour,\" rejoined Lady Marney  mournfully.    \"What, has the king changed?\" said Egremont. \"I thought it was all  right.\"    \"All was right,\" said Lady Marney. \"These men would have been turned out  again, had he only lived three months more.\"    \"Lived!\" exclaimed Egremont.    \"Yes,\" said Lady Marney; \"the king is dying.\"    Slowly delivering himself of an ejaculation, Egremont leant back in his  chair.    \"He may live a month,\" said Lady Marnev; \"he cannot live two. It is the  greatest of secrets; known at this moment only to four individuals, and  I communicate it to you, my dear Charles, in that absolute confidence  which I hope will always subsist between us, because it is an event that  may greatly affect your career.\"    \"How so, my dear mother?\"    \"Marbury! I have settled with Mr Tadpole that you shall stand for the  old borough. With the government in our hands, as I had anticipated  at the general election, success I think was certain: under the  circumstances which we must encounter, the struggle will be more severe,  but I think we shall do it: and it will be a happy day for me to have  our own again, and to see you in Parliament, my dear child.\"    \"Well, my dear mother, I should like very much to be in Parliament, and  particularly to sit for the old borough; but I fear the contest will be  very expensive,\" said Egremont inquiringly.    \"Oh! I have no doubt,\" said Lady Marney, \"that we shall have  some monster of the middle class, some tinker or tailor, or  candlestick-maker, with his long purse, preaching reform and practising  corruption: exactly as the liberals did under Walpole: bribery was  unknown in the time of the Stuarts; but we have a capital registration,  Mr Tadpole tells me. And a young candidate with the old name will tell,\"  said Lady Marney, with a smile: \"and I shall go down and canvass, and we  must do what we can.\"    \"I have great faith in your canvassing,\" said Egremont; \"but still, at  the same time, the powder and shot--\"    \"Are essential,\" said Lady Marney, \"I know it, in these corrupt days:  but Marney will of"]]]
