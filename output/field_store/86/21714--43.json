His hand plunged  into the drift and touched something that was not snow.  This he seized  and, pulling it gently toward him, found it to be a child. The next  moment he had lifted it in his arms and carried it into the house.    The wind followed him through the door, but Claus shut it out quickly.  He laid the rescued child on the hearth, and brushing away the snow he  discovered it to be Weekum, a little boy who lived in a house beyond  the Valley.    Claus wrapped a warm blanket around the little one and rubbed the frost  from its limbs.  Before long the child opened his eyes and, seeing  where he was, smiled happily.  Then Claus warmed milk and fed it to the  boy slowly, while the cat looked on with sober curiosity.  Finally the  little one curled up in his friend's arms and sighed and fell asleep,  and Claus, filled with gladness that he had found the wanderer, held  him closely while he slumbered.    The wind, finding no more mischief to do, climbed the hill and swept on  toward the north.  This gave the weary snowflakes time to settle down  to earth, and the Valley became still again.    The boy, having slept well in the arms of his friend, opened his eyes  and sat up.  Then, as a child will, he looked around the room and saw  all that it contained.    \"Your cat is a nice cat, Claus,\" he said, at last.  \"Let me hold it.\"    But puss objected and ran away.    \"The other cat won't run, Claus,\" continued the boy.  \"Let me hold that  one.\"  Claus placed the toy in his arms, and the boy held it lovingly  and kissed the tip of its wooden ear.    \"How did you get lost in the storm, Weekum?\" asked Claus.    \"I started to walk to my auntie's house and lost my way,\" answered  Weekum.    \"Were you frightened?\"    \"It was cold,\" said Weekum, \"and the snow got in my eyes, so I could  not see.  Then I kept on till I fell in the snow, without knowing where  I was, and the wind blew the flakes over me and covered me up.\"    Claus gently stroked his head, and the boy looked up at him and smiled.    \"I'm all right now,\" said Weekum.    \"Yes,\" replied Claus, happily.  \"Now I will put you in my warm bed, and  you must sleep until morning, when I will carry you back to your  mother.\"    \"May the cat sleep with me?\" asked the boy.    \"Yes, if you wish it to,\" answered Claus.    \"It's a nice cat!\" Weekum said, smiling, as Claus tucked the blankets  around him; and presently the little one fell asleep with the wooden  toy in his arms.    When morning came the sun claimed the Laughing Valley and flooded it  with his rays; so Claus prepared to take the lost child back to its  mother.    \"May I keep the cat, Claus?\" asked Weekum.  \"It's nicer than real cats.  It doesn't run away, or scratch or bite.  May I keep it?\"    \"Yes, indeed,\" answered Claus, pleased that the toy he had made could  give pleasure to the child.  So he wrapped the boy and the wooden cat  in a warm cloak, perching the bundle upon his own broad shoulders, and  then he tramped through the snow and the drifts of the Valley and  across the plain beyond to the poor cottage where Weekum's mother lived.    \"See, mama!\" cried the boy, as soon as they entered, \"I've got a cat!\"    The good woman wept tears of joy over the rescue of her darling and  thanked Claus many times for his kind act.  So he carried a warm and  happy heart back to his home in the Valley.    That night he said to puss: \"I believe the children will love the  wooden cats almost as well as the real ones, and they can't hurt them  by pulling their tails and ears.  I'll make another.\"    So this was the beginning of his great work.    The next cat was better made than the first.  While Claus sat whittling  it out the Yellow Ryl came in to make him a visit, and so pleased was  he with the man's skill that he ran away and brought several of his  fellows.    There sat the Red Ryl, the Black Ryl, the Green Ryl, the Blue Ryl and  the Yellow Ryl in a circle on the floor, while Claus whittled and  whistled and the wooden cat grew into shape.    \"If it could be made the same color as the real cat, no one would know  the difference,\" said the Yellow Ryl, thoughtfully.    \"The little ones, maybe, would not know the difference,\" replied Claus,  pleased with the idea.    \"I will bring you some of the red that I color my roses and tulips  with,\" cried the Red Ryl; \"and then you can make the cat's lips and  tongue red.\"    \"I will bring some of the green that I color my grasses and leaves  with,\" said the Green Ryl; \"and then you can color the cat's eyes  green.\"    \"They will need a bit of yellow, also,\" remarked the Yellow Ryl; \"I  must fetch some of the yellow that I use to color my buttercups and  goldenrods with.\"    \"The real cat is black,\" said the Black Ryl; \"I will bring some of the  black that I use to color the eyes of my pansies with, and then you can  paint your wooden cat black.\"    \"I see you have a blue ribbon around Blinkie's neck,\" added the Blue  Ryl.  \"I will get some of the color that I use to paint the bluebells  and forget-me-nots with, and then you can carve a wooden ribbon on the  toy cat's neck and paint it blue.\"    So the Ryls disappeared, and by the time Claus had finished carving out  the form of the cat they were all back with the paints and brushes.    They made Blinkie sit upon the table, that Claus might paint the toy  cat just the right color, and when the work was done the Ryls declared  it was exactly as good as a live cat.    \"That is, to all appearances,\" added the Red Ryl.    Blinkie seemed a little offended by the attention bestowed upon the  toy, and that she might not seem to approve the imitation cat she  walked to the corner of the hearth and sat down with a dignified air.    But Claus was delighted, and as soon as morning came he started out and  tramped through the snow, across the Valley and the plain, until he  came to a village.  There, in a poor hut near the walls of the  beautiful palace of the Lord of Lerd, a little girl lay upon a wretched  cot, moaning with pain.    Claus approached the child and kissed her and comforted her, and then  he drew the toy cat from beneath his coat, where he had hidden it, and  placed it in her arms.    Ah, how well he felt himself repaid for his labor and his long walk  when he saw the little one's eyes grow bright with pleasure!  She  hugged the kitty tight to her breast, as if it had been a precious gem,  and would not let it go for a single moment.  The fever was quieted,  the pain grew less, and she fell into a sweet and refreshing sleep.    Claus laughed and whistled and sang all the way home.  Never had he  been so happy as on that day.    When he entered his house he found Shiegra, the lioness, awaiting him.  Since his babyhood Shiegra had loved Claus, and while he dwelt in the  Forest she had often come to visit him at Necile's bower.  After Claus  had gone to live in the Laughing Valley Shiegra became lonely and ill  at ease, and now she had braved the snow-drifts, which all lions abhor,  to see him once more.  Shiegra was getting old and her teeth were  beginning to fall out, while the hairs that tipped her ears and tail  had changed from tawny-yellow to white.    Claus found her lying on his hearth, and he put his arms around the  neck of the lioness and hugged her lovingly.  The cat had retired into  a far corner.  She did not care to associate with Shiegra.    Claus told his old friend about the cats he had made, and how much  pleasure they had given Weekum and the sick girl.  Shiegra did not know  much about children; indeed, if she met a child she could scarcely be  trusted not to devour it.  But she was interested in Claus' new labors,  and said:    \"These images seem to me very attractive.  Yet I can not see why you  should make cats, which are very unimportant animals.  Suppose, now  that I am here, you make the image of a lioness, the Queen of all  beasts.  Then, indeed, your children will be happy--and safe at the  same time!\"    Claus thought this was a good suggestion.  So he got a piece of wood  and sharpened his knife, while Shiegra crouched upon the hearth at his  feet.  With much care he carved the head in the likeness of the  lioness, even to the two fierce teeth that curved over her lower lip  and the deep, frowning lines above her wide-open eyes.    When it was finished he said:    \"You have a terrible look, Shiegra.\"    \"Then the image is like me,\" she answered; \"for I am indeed terrible to  all who are not my friends.\"    Claus now carved out the body, with Shiegra's long tail trailing behind  it.  The image of the crouching lioness was very life-like.    \"It pleases me,\" said Shiegra, yawning and stretching her body  gracefully.  \"Now I will watch while you paint.\"    He brought the paints the Ryls had given him from the cupboard and  colored the image to resemble the real Shiegra.    The lioness placed her big, padded paws upon the edge of the table and  raised herself while she carefully examined the toy that was her  likeness.    \"You are indeed skillful!\" she said, proudly.  \"The children will like  that better than cats, I'm sure.\"    Then snarling at Blinkie, who arched her back in terror and whined  fearfully, she walked away toward her forest home with stately strides.        4.  How Little Mayrie Became Frightened    The winter was over now, and all the Laughing Valley was filled with  joyous excitement.  The brook was so happy at being free once again  that it gurgled more boisterously than ever and dashed so recklessly  against the rocks that it sent showers of spray high in the air.  The  grass thrust its sharp little blades upward through the mat of dead  stalks where it had hidden from the snow, but the flowers were yet too  timid to show themselves, although the Ryls were busy feeding their  roots.  The sun was in remarkably good humor, and sent his rays dancing  merrily throughout the Valley.

Y en Flandes conmigo di,                But in Flanders, unfortunately,  mas con tan negra fortuna               I had an unlucky run  que al mes de encontrarme allí          so that within a month, you see,  todo mi caudal perdí,                   I was no longer rich, as formerly,  dobla a dobla, una por una.             coin by coin, gone, one by one.  En tan total carestía                   Seeing I was in such need  mirándome de dineros,                   of a little ready money,  de mí todo el mundo huía;               everyone fled from me,  mas yo busqué compañia                  but I sought company,  y me uní a unos bandoleros.             and joined the banditry.  Lo hicimos bien, ¡voto a tal!,          We did well, by the devil,  y fuimos tan adelante                   and such a road we went,  con suerte tan colosal                  with such good luck in our revel,  que entramos a saco en Gante            that we entered and sacked, in Ghent,  el palacio episcopal.                   the bishop's episcopal palace.  ¡Qué noche! Por el decoro               What a night! To keep the rule  de la Pascua, el buen obispo            of Easter, the good bishop, the fool,  bajó a presidir el coro,                went down to preside, and school  y aún de alegría me crispo              the choir, and I shiver with                                          joy, can't stop,  al recordar su tesoro.                  when I remember his treasure.  Todo cayó en poder nuestro:             It all fell to us, at the start,  mas mi capitán, avaro,                  but my greedy captain, at leisure,  puso mi parte en secuestro;             confiscated my part:  reñimos, fui yo más diestro             we fought, I had more art,  y le crucé sin reparo.                  I ran him through with pleasure.  Juróme al punto la gente                His men, then, made me stand  capitán, por más valiente.              for Captain, I as the better man.  Juréles yo amistad franca.              I swore to be their friend.  Pero a la noche siguiente               But the following night I ran,  huí, y les dejé sin blanca.             left them not a thing in the end.  Yo me acordé del refrán                 And I remembered the proverb,  de que quien roba al ladrón             'who robs a thief of his ration  ha cien años de perdón,                 gets a hundred-year pardon',  y me arrojé a tal desmán                and I carried it out with nerve  mirando a mi salvación.                 looking to my salvation.  Pasé a Alemania opulento:               I crossed to Germany, now rich,  mas un provincial jerónimo,             but a provincial clerk  hombre de mucho talento,                a man of many gifts,  me conoció, y al momento                recognized and denounced me,  me delató en un anónimo.                in a note he wrote anonymously.  Compré a fuerza de dinero               By means of money, I bought  la libertad y el papel;                 the note and my freedom,  y topando en un sendero                 and running across the clerk  al fraile, le envié certero             on a path, I sent him my thoughts  una bala envuelta en él.                with a bullet wrapped inside them.  Salté a Francia. ¡Buen país!            I jumped over to France, a fine place,  Y como en Nápoles vos                   and like you, in Naples, I too  puse un cartel en París                 posted a sign, in Paris,  diciendo: Aquí hay un don Luis          saying: 'Here is Don Luis  que vale lo menos dos.                  who's worth at least two of you.  Parará aquí algunos meses,              He'll stay here a few months, then,  y no trae más intereses                 and really his only yen,  ni se aviene a más empresas             really his only game, is  que a adorar a las francesas            to adore all the French ladies,  y a reñir con los franceses.            and fight all the French men.'  Esto escribí; y en medio año            I wrote this, and in the half-year,  que mi presencia gozó                   that Paris held me dear,  París, no hubo lance extaño             there was no strange affair,  ni hubo escándalo ni daño               no scandal or public fear,  donde no me hallara yo.                 in which I did not appear.
