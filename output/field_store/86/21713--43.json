The woman suffragist misapprehends--it will be better to assume that  she \"misapprehends\"--when she suggests that we, the male electors,  have framed the laws.    In reality the law which we live under--and the law in those States  which have adopted either the English, or the Roman law--descends from  the past. It has been evolved precedent, by precedent, by the  decisions of generation upon generation of judges, and it has for  centuries been purged by amending statutes. Moreover we, the present  male electors--the electors who are savagely attacked by the  suffragist for our asserted iniquities in connexion with the laws  which regulate sexual relations--have never in our capacity as  electors had any power to alter an old, or to suggest a new law;  except only in so far as by voting Conservative or Liberal we may  indirectly have remotely influenced the general trend of legislation.    \"Well but\"--the suffragist will here rejoin--\"is it not at any rate  true that in the drafting of statutes and the framing of judicial  decisions man has always nefariously discriminated against woman?\"    The question really supplies its own answer. It will be obvious to  every one who considers that the drafting of statutes and the  formulating of legal decisions is almost as impersonal a procedure as  that of drawing up the rules to govern a game; and it offers hardly  more opportunity for discriminating between man and woman.    There are, however, three questions in connexion with which the law  can and does make a distinction between man and woman.    The _first_ is that of sexual relations: rape, divorce, bastardy, and  the age of consent. In connexion with _rape_, it has never been  alleged that the law is not sufficiently severe. It is, or has been,  under colonial conditions, severe up to the point of ferocity. In the  matter of _divorce_ the law of a minority of man-governed States  differentiates in favour of man. It does so influenced by tradition,  by what are held to be the natural equities, and by the fact that a  man is required to support his wife's progeny. The law of _bastardy  [illegitimate childbirth]_ is what it is because of the dangers of  blackmail. The law which fixes the age of consent discriminates  against man, laying him open to a criminal charge in situations where  woman--and it is not certain that she is not a more frequent  offender--escapes scot-free.    The _second_ point in which the law differentiates is in the matter of  exacting personal service for the State. If it had not been that man  is more prone to discriminate in favour of woman than against her,  every military State, when exacting personal military service from  men, would have demanded from women some such equivalent personal  service as would be represented by a similar period of work in an army  clothing establishment, or ordnance factory, or army laundry; or would  at any rate have levied upon woman a ransom in lieu of such service.    The _third_ point in which the law distinguishes between man and woman  is with reference to the suffrage. The object of this book is to show  that this is equitable and in the interests of both.    The suffragist further misapprehends when she regards it as an  indignity to obey laws which she has not herself framed, or  specifically sanctioned. (The whole male electorate, be it remarked,  would here lie under the same dignity as woman.)    But in reality, whether it is a question of the rules of a game, or of  the reciprocal rights and duties of members of a community, it is, and  ought to be, to every reasonable human being not a grievance, but a  matter of felicitation, that an expert or a body of experts should  have evolved a set of rules under which order and harmony are  achieved. Only vanity and folly would counsel amateurs to try to draw  up rules or laws for themselves.    Again, the woman suffragist takes it as a matter of course that she  would herself be able to construct a system of workable laws. In point  of fact, the framing of a really useful law is a question of divining  something which will apply to an infinite number of different cases  and individuals. It is an intellectual feat on a par with the framing  of a great generalisation. And would woman--that being of such short  sight, whose mind is always so taken up with whatever instances lie  nearest to her--be capable of framing anything that could pass muster  as a great generalisation?    Lastly, the suffragist fails to see that the function of framing the  laws is not an essential function of citizenship.    The essential functions of citizenship are the shaping of public  policy, and the control of the administrative Acts of Government.    Such directive control is in a state of political freedom exercised  through two quite different agencies.    It is exercised--and it is of the very essence of political freedom  that this should be the normal method of control--in the first place,  through expressed public opinion. By this are continuously regulated  not only momentous matters of State, such as declarations of war and  the introduction of constitutional changes, but also smaller and more  individual matters, such as the commutation of a capital sentence, or  the forcible feeding of militant suffragists.    In the background, behind the moral compulsion of expressed public  opinion, there is, in the case of a Parliamentary State, also another  instrument of control. I have in view that periodical settlement of  the contested rulership of the State by the force of a majority of  electors which is denoted a general election.    The control exercised by the suffrages of the electors in a general  election is in certain important respects less effective than that  exercised by the everyday public expression of opinion. It falls short  in the respect that its verdicts are, except only in connexion with  the issue as to whether the Government is to be retained in office or  dismissed, ambiguous verdicts; further, in the respect that it comes  into application either before governmental proposals have taken  definite shape, or only after the expiration of a term of years, when  the events are already passing out of memory.    If we now consider the question of woman's franchise from the wider  point of view here opened up, it will be clear that, so far as  concerns the control which is exercised through public opinion on the  Government, the intelligent woman, and especially the intelligent  woman who has made herself an expert on any matter, is already in  possession of that which is a greater power than the franchise. She  has the power which attaches to all intelligent opinion promulgated in  a free State. Moreover, wherever the special interest of women are  involved, any woman may count on being listened to if she is voicing  the opinions of any considerable section of her sex.    In reality, therefore, woman is disfranchised only so far as relates  to the confirmation of a Government in office, or its dismissal by the  _ultima ratio [ultimate reason]_ of an electoral contest. And when we  reflect that woman does not come into consideration as a compelling  force, and that an electoral contest partakes of the nature of a civil  war, it becomes clear that to give her the parliamentary vote would be  to reduce all those trials of strength which take the form of  electoral contests to the level of a farce.    With this I have, I will not say completed the tale of the  suffragist's grievances--that would be impossible--but I have at any  rate dealt with those which she has most acrimoniously insisted upon.      III    ARGUMENTS WHICH TAKE THE FORM OF \"COUNSELS OF PERFECTION\" ADDRESSED TO  MAN    Argument that Woman Requires a Vote for her Protection--Argument that  Woman ought to be Invested with the Responsibilities of Voting in  Order that She May Attain Her Full Intellectual Stature.    There, however, remains still a further class of arguments.  I have in  view here arguments which have nothing to do with elementary natural  rights, nor yet with wounded _amour propre._ They concern ethics, and  sympathy, and charitable feelings.    The suffragist here gives to man \"counsels of perfection.\"    It will be enough to consider here two of these:--the _first_, the  argument that woman, being the weaker vessel, needs, more than man,  the suffrage for her _protection_; the _second_, that woman, being  less than man in relation to public life, ought to be given the vote  for _instructional purposes_.    The first of these appeals will, for instance, take the following  form:--\"Consider the poor sweated East End woman worker. She knows  best where the shoe pinches. You men can't know. Give her a vote; and  you shall see that she will very soon better her condition.\"    When I hear that argument I consider:--We will suppose that woman was  ill. Should we go to her and say: \"You know best, know better than any  man, what is wrong with you. Here are all the medicines and remedies.  Make your own selection, for that will assuredly provide what will be  the most likely to help.\"    If this would be both futile and inhuman, much more would it be so to  seek out this woman who is sick in fortune and say to her, \"Go and  vote for the parliamentary candidate who will be likely to influence  the trend of legislation in a direction which will help.\"    What would really help the sweated woman labourer would, of course, be  to have the best intellect brought to bear, not specially upon the  problem of indigent woman, but upon the whole social problem.    But the aspect of the question which is, from our present point of  view, the fundamentally important one is the following: Granting that  the extension of the suffrage to woman would enable her, as the  suffragist contends, to bring pressure upon her parliamentary  representative, man,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51854"],[0,"The Rat Race (#6)"],[1,"a fishing  schooner. I jumped into the den and slammed the door, while Ponto  sniffed, snapped and grumbled on the far side of my defenses.    \"Tell you what, doctor,\" I called through the panels. \"Take him  upstairs and put him in my room. It's the one to the right at the head  of the stairs. He's just excited. Shut him in and as soon as he's  calmed down I'll make him comfortable.\"    While this rather cowardly solution was being put into effect, I sat  down and thought it over. Apparently Winnie had been the kind of man  whose pet dog tried to rip his throat out. That was puzzling, since  from what I remembered of him at school, he had if anything been  only too amiable. I waited out the vet's last-minute report and  instructions, and then rang the bell for the maid.    \"Mary,\" I said, \"will you help the doctor with his hat and coat and  then take Ponto a bowl of water. The poor old fellow's had a rough  time.\"    The vet departed and I listened while the maid went upstairs. Then  there was a scream, the crash of breaking china and the sound of a door  being slammed. I bounded up the steps to find Mary, white-faced and  trembling, looking stupidly at the broken remains of a white china bowl  and a sizeable puddle of water on the hardwood floor outside my bedroom.    The door of my wife's room burst open and Jimmie appeared with a wild  \"What on earth!\"    \"It's that dog, sir,\" gasped Myrtle. \"When I come--came--in with the  bowl of water like you said, there he was lying on--on--your bed, like  a Human, and--and--\"    \"And what?\" I demanded.    \"And he was wearing your pyjamas, sir,\" she sobbed. \"It's--it's--\"    \"Uncanny,\" Germaine supplied the word.    I gave a hollow laugh. \"He probably remembers that he isn't allowed to  lie on the beds, Mary, and may have dragged my pyjamas up there to lie  on. Whenever I let him up on the furniture I always make him lie on  some of my clothes.\"    \"Oh,\" Myrtle said, suddenly calm. \"Is that it? It was just that it  looked sort of queer to see his legs in the pyjama trousers.\"    \"Well, don't worry about it now, Myrtle,\" my wife remarked firmly.  \"I'm not surprised it gave you a shock. He's such a big dog. I'll go in  and see that he's comfortable. Come on, Winnie! Let's take a look at  him. What's the matter?\" she added, noticing a certain reluctance in my  attitude.    \"Nothing much,\" I martyrized. \"It's only that he flew for my throat  when he got inside the door.\"    \"Nonsense!\" she replied in the firm tone of a woman who knows better  and who, in any case, expects her husband not to be afraid of a mere  infuriated Great Dane. \"You know Ponto always puts his paws on your  shoulders and licks your face every morning, as you taught him.\"    My rollicking laughter was a work of art. \"Of course, that was it,\" I  agreed, \"and he'd been away from us so long that he was over-eager.  Come on, let's see if we can't make the poor beast comfortable.\"    But I let her lead the way.    The poor beast was lying panting on my still unmade bed. The flowered  Chinese silk pyjamas which I had worn at breakfast were indeed  strangely twisted around its gaunt body. The coat was across the  animal's shoulders and both of its hind-legs were sticking through one  of the trouser-legs.    \"There! Ponto! Poor old fellow!\" cooed Jimmie in a voice which would  have charmed snails from their shells.    Ponto gave a self-pitying whine and his tail thumped the pillow like  an overseer's whip across the back of Uncle Tom. My wife patted  the animal's head and Ponto positively drooled at her. She gently  disentangled him from among the pyjamas and hung them up in the closet.  As she turned toward the bed, he jumped to the floor, reared up, put  both paws on her shoulders and licked her face convulsively, giving  little whines and shiverings.    \"Poor old fellow, poor old Ponto!\" she crooned. \"Was he glad to get  home from the nasty old kennel? There!\" And she massaged his ears.  \"Come on now, Ponto,\" she remarked more authoritatively, \"say good  morning to your master.\"    The answer was a grand diapason of a growl and the baring of a thicket  of gleaming white fangs in my direction.    \"Ponto!\" she ordered, as the beast positively cringed. \"Say good  morning to the master!\"    He slumped to the floor with the grace of a pole-axed calf and  approached me slowly, ears back, hair bristling and teeth in evidence.    \"Ponto!\" Germaine's cry was positively totalitarian but the dog lunged  at me and I barely had time to close the door in its face.    A few minutes later, Germaine emerged looking bewildered. \"I've never  known him to behave like this,\" she said. \"I don't like it. It's always  been you he was so fond of and he barely tolerated me. Now he seems all  mixed-up. After you left, he calmed right down and came back and licked  my face all over again. What do you suppose is wrong with him. Can it  be fits?\"    I shook my head. \"He doesn't act like fits,\" I said. \"He's had a bad  go of distemper and is probably suffering from shock. Dogs do get  shock, you know. I remember in Psychology at Harvard they told us about  a very intelligent St. Bernard dog which was shocked into complete  hysteria by the supernatural. That is, they pulled a lamb chop across  the floor by a thread concealed in a crack between the boards. The dog  nearly had heart failure when he saw a chop moving by itself.\"    \"But what can we do?\" she asked. \"Let's send him back to the kennels  until he's cured.\"    \"Nope! From what Dr. Whatsisname--\"    \"Dalrymple.\"    \"From what Dalrymple said, he'd started acting up at the kennels and  he--the vet, that is--thought Ponto would be better off at home.\"    \"But we can't have him going for you every time you use your room.\"    \"Then I won't use it. I'll sleep in the guest-room,\" I added swiftly,  lest she leap to feminine conclusions. \"You might take him another bowl  of water--he's all right with you--and spread the New York Times on  the floor--and a damned good use for it--and bring out my clothes and  things. He seems to have quite a leech for you and we'll just leave him  there to think things over by himself.\"    \"How about his food?\" she asked. \"Shouldn't he have a special diet?\"    \"No. I'll let him go hungry for a day or so. So long as he has plenty  of water it won't hurt him. Then when he's weak enough so as not to  be dangerous I'll bring him some nice dog-biscuits and warm milk and  he'll learn to love me the best way, by the alimentary canal.\"    She looked at me closely, \"You _do_ look rocky,\" she said. \"You've had  a shock, too. Hadn't I better call the doctor?\"    I shook my head. \"No more doctors, please. I'm out of condition, I  guess, and all this dodging Great Danes is hard on the nerves. I'll go  down and mix myself a brandy-and-soda. You might join me when you've  moved my things upstairs. We've got to talk over a lot of things.\"    When I finally managed to settle down in my den with a stiff drink I  felt besieged, bewildered and backed up against the wall. There could  be no reasonable doubt about it--_the dog knew_! Ponto knew that I was  an interloper, that the real Winnie Tompkins no longer existed, that a  stranger was masquerading in his body and clothes. The uncanny instinct  of a dog had led him to the truth when even Winnie's wife had been  deceived.    This was a new twist in the maze. I couldn't imagine the Master of  the Rat-Race watching with scientific detachment to see whether Frank  Jacklin would make it or would be disqualified in the first round. Of  one thing I was certain, unless I could establish some kind of personal  understanding with Ponto, suspicion would gather around me. For the  moment, Germaine did not doubt that I was her husband: my conduct had  puzzled her but she had lived with Winnie so long that it was probable  that she no longer specifically noticed him. Virginia Rutherford would  be more dangerous--she was a woman scorned and she had been tricked  out of an intrigue. She had every motive for digging out or even for  inventing the truth, but I had given myself a good excuse to keep her  at arm's length. She couldn't force her way into my clubs. I would  tell my office staff to keep her away from me, and she couldn't be so  ill-bred as to thrust herself into my home. If I could appease Ponto  and avoid Virginia, I had a fair chance of getting away with it.    \"Beg pardon, sir!\" It was Myrtle.    \"Yes, Mary?\"    \"Mrs. Rutherford is back, sir. She wants to see you.\"    \"Tell her I am not at home,\" I replied in a clear carrying tone. \"And  that I never will be at home to her.\"    \"Oh, yes, you will.\" It was the red-head. She was wearing a long mink  coat and carrying a short automatic pistol. \"Like it or not, Winnie,  _we_ are going to have a talk--now.\" She turned to the startled maid.  \"And don't you try phoning the police, Myrtle,\" she added, \"or the  first thing you will hear is this pistol going pop at Mr. Winfred  Tompkins of New York City and Bedford Hills.\"    \"That's all right, Mary,\" I added. \"Don't call the police. Tell  Mrs. Tompkins that I'm busy. Mrs. Rutherford and I wish to have a  conversation.\"          CHAPTER 5      As the door to the room slammed convulsively behind Myrtle, Mrs.  Rutherford relaxed, laid the automatic on the sofa between us, and  flung back her mink coat. She was an appetizing little number, if you  like 'em red-haired, well-developed and mad through and through.    Instinctively I started to reach for the gun but was checked by her  laugh.    \"Take it, by all means,\" she said. \"It's not loaded. I only needed it  for the maid. Tell me, Winnie, have you got her on your string, too?  The maid made or undone, as they used to say.\"    \"Virginia,\" I said firmly, \"I told you earlier this morning that we  were through. There's nothing more to be said about it. It's finished,  done, kaput! All's well that ends.\"    She laughed again, and looked at me closely. In spite of myself, I  began pulling "]]]
