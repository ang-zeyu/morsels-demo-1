A conjectural  line runs round from the last English to the first Spanish flag, and  there is no sign of the alleged Vespucci discoveries. If it is suggested  that the Florentine himself kept them secret, without any conceivable  object for doing so, there were all his companions to proclaim them,  and there must have been an official report. If those 870 leagues of  coast had been discovered, the discovery must have been shown on the  map of Juan de la Cosa.    The Cantino map furnishes additional evidence against Vespucci of  an interesting kind. This map of the world was compiled for the Duke  of Ferrara by order of Alberto Cantino, to illustrate the voyages of  Corte Real. It was drawn by a Portuguese draughtsman at Lisbon, and was  finished in the autumn of 1502, having been paid for in November of that  year. On the Cantino map, the coast-line discovered by Hojeda in 1499 is  shown. It is not copied from the map of Juan de la Cosa, for most of the  names are different[49]; but the information must have been supplied by  some one who was in Hojeda's expedition. Vespucci was in Lisbon in the  autumn of 1502; it is, therefore, almost certain that this coast-line  was laid down from information supplied by Vespucci.[50] If Vespucci,  in 1497, had discovered a coast-line between 16 deg. and 23 deg. N., and another  coast-line extending from 23 deg. N. for 870 leagues N. W., these marvellous  discoveries would also appear on the Cantino map. But there is not a sign  of them. We may conclude from this that Vespucci had not yet conceived  the idea of the fictitious voyage of 1497, when he assisted Cantino's  draughtsman in the autumn of 1502. The imposture is first hinted at some  six months afterwards in the Medici letter of March 1503. Peter Martyr  gives corroborative evidence that Vespucci assisted the Portuguese  cartographer. He says that he visited Bishop Fonseca, and was shown  \"many of those mappes which are commonly called the shipman cardes,  or cardes of the sea: of the which, one was drawen by the Portugales,  wherunto Americus Vesputius is said to have put his hande, beinge a man  experte in this facultie, and a Florentine borne.\"[51]    Further evidence against Vespucci is furnished by the map which was  prepared in 1511 to illustrate Peter Martyr's _Decades_. This author was  personally acquainted with Vespucci, who was then chief pilot of Spain,  and was intimate with his nephew Giovanni. Yet there is not a sign of  Vespucci's alleged discoveries in 1497 on the map of 1511. There was no  motive for secrecy on the part of Vespucci, or on the part of the captains  and pilots of the four ships; on the contrary, their interest was to  make the discoveries public and get credit for them. Bermuda appears  for the first time on the map of 1511, having been discovered by Juan  Bermudez. But there is no mention of _Iti_. In this same year, Ponce  de Leon obtained a concession for the discovery of that very coast of  Florida which, according to Varnhagen, had been discovered in its whole  extent by Vespucci fourteen years before. The concession was actually  made on the condition that the coast had not been discovered before, and  Vespucci was then chief pilot. It is incredible that Vespucci and all his  companions should have combined to conceal their wonderful discoveries  without any conceivable reason, their silence being most injurious to  themselves. It is still more incredible that the King should have put  such a condition into the concession to Ponce de Leon, if it was true  that the coast in question had been discovered fourteen years before by  an expedition despatched by himself.    The evidence against Vespucci is cumulative and quite conclusive. His  first voyage is a fabrication. He cannot be acquitted of the intention  of appropriating for himself the glory of having first discovered the  mainland. The impartial and upright Las Casas, after carefully weighing  the evidence, found him guilty. This verdict has been, and will continue  to be, confirmed by posterity. He wished to glorify himself in his own  country, whither he intended to retire, and throughout Europe. But he  did not dare to publish his fiction in Spain, and, so far as we know,  it did not reach Spain in print until after his death. He wrote well,  and his stories about a new world excited the enthusiasm of those who  read them. His Latin editor suggested that his new world should be called  America, and the name was adopted by map-makers. It was euphonious and  convenient, and, in spite of the protests of Las Casas and Herrera, it  eventually became general, and Vespucci usurped the honours that rightly  belonged to Columbus. Vespucci may be acquitted of having contemplated  so great an injustice. It is possible that he never intended that his  letters should be published. He may only have desired to increase his  consequence among his own countrymen. But whatever his intention may  have been, he committed a fraud with a dishonest purpose, and it is no  extenuation that he did not contemplate the full extent of the injustice  it has caused.    The investigation of Vespucci's statements contained in the first and  second voyages destroys all confidence in his unsupported word, when we  proceed to examine his account of the voyages alleged to have been made  by him in Portuguese ships.    There is no mention either of Vespucci or of Giocondi, who is alleged  to have brought him the invitation from the King to come to Portugal,  either in the voluminous Portuguese archives, or in the contemporary  chronicle of Damian de Goes. This remarkable silence points to the  conclusion that if Vespucci was really in any Portuguese expedition he  can only have filled some very subordinate post; probably sailing as a  merchant or a volunteer.[52]    Vespucci has given us two accounts of his alleged first voyage with  the Portuguese, which he calls his third voyage. The Medici letter  is entirely devoted to it, while it is also included in the Soderini  letter. The dates and figures seldom agree in the two letters, and  there is evidence throughout them of the random way in which he wrote,  and of his disregard for truth or accuracy. Sailing with three vessels,  on the 10th of March 1501 according to one letter, and on the 15th  according to the other, they came to a place called Bezeguiche, or  Beseghir,[53] on the west coast of Africa, which Vespucci identifies  as Cape Verd, and places in 14 deg. 30' N. in one letter, and in 13 deg.  within the Tropic in the other.[54] Thence they sailed across the ocean  for sixty-seven days, or sixty-three days, on a S.W. 1/4 S. course for  700 leagues, reaching the coast on the 7th or 17th of August, in 5 deg.  S. latitude. In the Soderini letter there is a story of Portuguese being  murdered and eaten; but in the Medici letter there is nothing but friendly  intercourse with the natives, with a long account of their manners and  customs, obviously as fictitious as those in the first voyage which were  commented upon by Las Casas. Among the plants he saw, Vespucci gives  the names of four: cannafistula, Brazil wood, cassia, and myrrh.    From the landfall they sailed eastward for (150) 300 leagues, to a point  of land which was named Cape St. Augustine, and then south and west as  far as 52 deg. S. Vespucci alleges that the command of the fleet was given  to him, and that he continued a southerly course. In the Medici letter  he says that he went south until he was 17 deg. 30' from the Antarctic  Pole, or in 73 deg. 30' S., which is preposterous. In the Soderini letter  he reached only 52 deg. S., got into a gale of wind, sighted some land with  a rocky coast, and ran along it for 20 leagues.[55] Thence the ships  shaped a homeward course, reached Sierra Leone on June 10th--where one  vessel was condemned as unseaworthy, and burnt--the Azores in the end  of July, and Lisbon on September 7th, 1502. Both letters contain some  absurd remarks about the stars in the southern hemisphere, and one has  a long explanation how two men, one in 39 deg. N. and another in 50 deg. S.,  would be standing at right angles to each other.    The second voyage of Vespucci from Lisbon; which he calls his fourth  voyage, was undertaken for the discovery of Malacca, which he believed  to be in 33 deg. S. latitude, instead of 2 deg. 14' N. latitude, its real  position. This is a pretty considerable error! The narrative is full of  spiteful and vindictive remarks about the commander of the expedition,  whose name is not given.[56] One vessel was lost off an island which  appears to have been Fernando Noronha, and two others, with Vespucci,  reached the coast of Brazil and entered a harbour, which was named Bahia  do todos os Santos. They then sailed along the coast for 260 leagues,  where they found another harbour in 18 deg. S. Here they built a fort, and,  leaving a garrison, returned to Lisbon on June 18th, 1504.    The two Portuguese voyages may be authentic, though the absence of all  names, and the silence of the Lisbon archives touching Vespucci, make it  impossible to identify them. The careless and unreliable way in which  Vespucci tells his story renders it worse than useless to speculate  on any of the details, beyond the fact that the Portuguese commanders  appear to have explored a considerable part of the coast of Brazil. Any  theory based on the latitudes given by Vespucci would only mislead,  for, when the places to which they refer can be identified, they are  wrong, and when given in both the letters, they differ. The letter  describing the four voyages was not written for readers acquainted with  the history and progress of discovery, not for Spaniards or Portuguese,  but for the Medicis and Soderinis, the Waldseemuellers and Ringmanns,  to whom these tales were new, wonderful, and mysterious. Accuracy and  truth were of no consequence so long as they believed in Amerigo Vespucci  as the discoverer of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36962"],[0,"My Attainment of the Pole (#6)"],[1,"ps, was held up as visible evidence  that I was a faker! Errors which crept into my newspaper account  because of hasty preparation, and which were not corrected because there  was no time to read proofs, were eagerly seized upon, and long, abstruse  and impressive mathematical dissertations were made on these to prove  how unscrupulous and unreliable I was.    The photograph of the flag at the Pole was put forth by one of Mr.  Peary's friends to prove on _prima facie_ evidence that I had faked.  Inasmuch as the original negative was vague because of the non-actinic  light in the North, the newspaper photographers retouched the print and  painted on it a shadow as being cast from the flag and snow igloos. This  shadow was seized upon avidly, and after long and learned calculations,  was cited as showing that the picture was taken some five hundred miles  from the Pole.    A formidable appearing statement, signed by various members of his  expedition, and copyrighted by the clique of honor-blind boosters, was  issued by Mr. Peary. In this he gave statements of my two Eskimo  companions to the effect that I had not gotten out of sight of land for  more than one or two \"sleeps\" on my trip. I knew that I had encouraged  the delusion of my Eskimos that the mirages and low-lying clouds which  appeared almost daily were signs of land. In their ignorance and their  eagerness to be near land, they believed this, and by this innocent  deception I prevented the panic which seizes every Arctic savage when he  finds himself upon the circumpolar sea out of sight of land. I have  since learned that Mr. Peary's Eskimos became panic-stricken near the  Big Lead on his last journey and that it was only by the  life-threatening announcement to them of his determination to leave  them alone on the ice (to get back to land as best they might or starve  to death) that he compelled them to accompany him.    In any case, I did not consider as important any testimony of the  Eskimos which Mr. Peary might cite, knowing as well as he did that one  can get any sort of desired reply from these natives by certain adroit  questioning, and knowing also that the alleged route on his map which he  said they drew was valueless, inasmuch as an Eskimo out of sight of land  and in an unfamiliar region has no sense of location. I felt the whole  statement to be what it was, a trumped-up document in which my helpers,  perhaps unwittingly, had been adroitly led to affirm what Mr. Peary by  jesuitical and equivocal questioning planned to have them say, and that  it was therefore unworthy of a reply.    I had left my instruments and part of the unreduced reckonings with Mr.  Harry Whitney, a fact which Mr. Whitney himself confirmed in published  press interviews when he first arrived--in the heat of the controversy  and after I left Copenhagen--in Sidney. When interviews came from Mr.  Peary insinuating that I had left no instruments in the North, this  becoming a definite charge which was taken up with great hue and cry,  I bitterly felt this to be a deliberate untruth on Mr. Peary's part.  I have since learned that one of Mr. Peary's officers cross-questioned  my Eskimos, and that by showing them Mr. Peary's own instruments he  discovered just what instruments I had had with me on my trip, and that  by describing the method of using these instruments to E-tuk-i-shook  and Ah-we-lah, Bartlett learned from them that I did take observations.  This information he conveyed to Mr. Peary before his expedition left  Etah for America, and this knowledge Mr. Peary and his party,  deliberately and with malicious intent, concealed on their return. At  the time I had no means of refuting this insinuation; it was simply my  word or Mr. Peary's.    [Illustration: RUDOLPH FRANCKE IN ARCTIC COSTUME]    [Illustration: MIDNIGHT--\"A PANORAMA OF BLACK LACQUER AND SILVER.\"]    I had no extraordinary proofs to offer, but, such as they were, I now  know, by comparison with the published reports of Mr. Peary himself,  they were as good as any offered by anyone. I was perhaps unfortunate in  not having, as Mr. Peary had, a confederate body of financially  interested friends to back me up, as was the National Geographic  Society.    Not satisfied with unjustly attacking my claim, Mr. Peary's associates  proceeded to assail my past career, and I was next confronted by an  affidavit made by my guide, Barrill, to the effect that I had not scaled  Mt. McKinley, an affidavit which, as I later secured evidence, had been  bought. A widely heralded \"investigation\" was announced by a body of  \"explorers\" of which Peary was president. One of Colonel Mann's  muck-rakers was secretary, while its moving spirit was Mr. Peary's press  agent, Herbert L. Bridgman. In a desperate effort to help Peary, a  cowardly side issue was forced through Professor Herschell Parker, who  had been with me on the Mt. McKinley trip but who had turned back after  becoming panic-stricken in the crossing of mountain torrents. Mr. Parker  expressed doubt of my achievements because he differed with me as to the  value of the particular instrument to ascertain altitude which I, with  many other mountain climbers, used. I had offered all possible proofs  as to having climbed the mountain, as full and adequate proofs as any  mountaineer could, or ever has offered.    I resented the meddlesomeness of this pro-Peary group of kitchen  explorers, not one of whom knew the first principles of mountaineering.  From such an investigation, started to help Peary in his black-hand  effort to force the dagger, with the money power easing men's  conscience--as was evident at the time everywhere--no fair result could  be expected. And as to the widely printed Barrill affidavit--this  carried on its face the story of pro-Peary bribery and conspiracy. I  have since learned that for it $1,500 and other considerations were  paid. Here was a self-confessed liar. I did not think that a sane public  therefore could take this underhanded pro-Peary charge as to the climb  of Mt. McKinley seriously. Indeed, I paid little attention to it, but by  using the cutting power of the press my enemies succeeded in inflicting  a wound in my side.    I was thus plunged into the bewildering chaos which friends and enemies  created, and swept for three months through a cyclone of events which I  believe no human being could have stood. Before returning, I felt  weakened mentally and physically by the rigors of the North, where for a  year I barely withstood starvation. I was now whirled about the country,  daily delivering lectures, greeting thousands of people, buffeted by  mobs of well-meaning beings, and compelled to attend dinners and  receptions numbering two hundred in sixty days. The air hissed about me  with the odious charges which came from every direction. I was alone,  helpless, without a single wise counsellor, under the charge of the  enemies' press, mud-charged guns fired from every point of the compass.  Unlimited funds were being consumed in the infamous mill of bribery.    I had not the money nor the nature to fight in this kind of battle--so I  withdrew. At once, howls of execration gleefully rose from the ranks of  my enemies; my departure was heralded gloriously as a confession of  imposture. Advantage was taken of my absence and new, perjured, forged  charges were made to blacken my name. Far from my home and unable to  defend myself, Dunkle and Loose swore falsely to having manufactured  figures and observations under my direction. When I learned of this,  much as it hurt me, I knew that the report which I had sent to  Copenhagen would, if it did anything, disprove by the very figures in it  the malicious lying document published in the New York _Times_. This,  combined with the verdict rendered by the University of Copenhagen--a  neutral verdict which carried no implication of the non-attainment of  the Pole, but which was interpreted as a rejection--helped to stamp me  in the minds of many people as the most monumental impostor the world  has ever seen.    I fully realized that under the circumstances the only verdict of an  unprejudiced body on any such proofs to such a claim must be favorable  or neutral. The members of the University of Copenhagen who examined my  papers were neither personal friends nor members of a body financially  interested in my quest. Their verdict was honest. Mr. Peary's Washington  verdict was dishonest, for two members of the jury admitted a year later  in Congress, under pressure, that in the Peary data there was no  absolute proof.    By the time I determined to return to my native country and state my  case, I had been placed, I am certain, in a position of undeserved  discredit unparalleled in history. No epithet was too vile to couple  with my name. I was declared a brazen cheat who had concocted the most  colossal lie of ages whereby to hoax an entire world for gain. I was  made the subject of cheap jokes. My name in antagonistic newspapers had  become a synonym for cheap faking. I was compelled to see myself held up  gleefully as an impostor, a liar, a fraud, an unscrupulous scoundrel,  one who had tried to steal honors from another, and who, to escape  exposure, had fled to obscurity.    All the scientific work which scientists themselves had accepted as  valuable, all the necessary hardships and the inevitable agonies of my  last Arctic journey were forgotten; I was coupled with the most  notorious characters in history in a press which panders to the lowest  of human emotions and delights in men's shame. When I realized how  egregious, how frightful, how undeserved was all this, my soul writhed;  when I saw clearly, with the perspective which only time can give, how  I, stepping aside, in errors of confused judgment which were purely  human, had seemingly contributed to my unhappy plight, I felt the sting  of ignominy greater than that which has broken stronger men's hearts.
