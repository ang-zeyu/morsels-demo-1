As the Tabernacle had been built under express direction  extending even into minute detail, so the ministrations of the  Priesthood were prescribed and the order of worship was established,  whereby the people should be reminded that amongst them dwelt {28}  Jehovah, before whom they should set none other gods.[14]    The Tabernacle was prepared primarily for migratory service; its parts  therefore were separately finished and so fitted as to permit of easy  putting together or taking apart. When set up within its court, the  Tabernacle occupied the place of honor in the center of the camp.    On the east, and therefore immediately before the entrance to the  court, were the tents of the Priests; while on the other three sides  the Levites were encamped. These, being closest in attendance have been  likened to the body-guard of the Great King[15] whose throne was within  the sanctuary; and beyond them were stationed the other tribes in order  of established precedence. While dismantled and in transit, when the  people were on the march, the Tabernacle still held the central place;  its bearers were the Levites, and the whole army of Israel was its  guard.    Until Israel had become permanently established in the land of promise,  the Tabernacle of the Congregation had but temporary resting places. As  the people moved the sanctuary was carried, until it found a somewhat  more permanent home at Shiloh. There, at the door of the Tabernacle,  the final apportionment of Canaan among the tribes was made.[16]  There it remained during the period of the Judges, and until after  the Ark of God had been allowed to pass from the custody of Israel  to that of the Philistines, because of sin.[17] The glory of the  sanctuary {29} was largely lost, and though the Tabernacle continued  in existence its sacred service was in abeyance. Sadly was the truth  declared, \"The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is  taken.\"[18] There is evidence that for a short time during the reign  of Saul, the Tabernacle was established at Nob; for there we find the  priest Ahimelech maintaining the service of the shew-bread,[19] but  the Ark of the Covenant was certainly not there.[20] We next learn of  the Tabernacle having been set up at Gibeon, though the conditions  resulting in its removal thither are not fully stated.[21] The Ark was  housed in another tent, and finally both were brought into the splendid  Temple of Solomon by which all earlier sanctuaries were superseded.    THE THIRD TABERNACLE    Yet another tent of sanctuary was made and used in Israel prior to the  erection of the great Temple. This we may call for convenience the  Third Tabernacle; it was erected by David the king, in his own city, as  a shelter for the Ark of the Covenant. As already cited, the scriptural  record tells of the capture of the Ark by the Philistines, and of its  return to Israel. This incident occurred during the latter part of the  administration of the Judges, before Israel had bowed to a king in  Canaan.[22]    Throughout the reign of Saul, the Ark remained under the roof of a  private dwelling; wherein, however, a priest was maintained for its  care and ministry. One of the early acts of David after he became king,  was to {30} plan the removal of the Ark to a more suitable situation.  In the course of this removal, Uzzah was stricken, because without  authority he essayed to take hold of the sacred vessel; and this  manifestation of Divine displeasure so affected David that he delayed  his purpose of setting up the Ark in his own city and placed it in  another private house--that of Obed-edom the Gittite.[23] While the Ark  remained beneath that roof the household was blessed and prospered.  In course of time the original plan was carried into effect and the  Ark was set up in a tent specially prepared for its reception in the  City of David: \"And they brought in the ark of the Lord, and set it in  his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for  it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the  Lord.\"[24]    Thus, during the reign of David there were two places regarded as  sanctuaries; and the worship of the people was divided. Solomon  appears to have acknowledged the sanctity of both places--the resting  place of the Ark at Jerusalem and the place of the Tabernacle of the  Congregation at Gibeon.[25] Through him both shrines were again brought  together.[26]    THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON    Scarcely had the Ark of the Covenant been deposited at the capital  of the kingdom--the City of David,--when the king became desirous of  erecting for its accommodation a more enduring shelter than the tent  in which it had {31} been installed with pomp and ceremony. It appears  that the conscience of the king was troubled by the thought that he  was better housed than was the sanctuary of the Lord: \"Now it came to  pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet,  Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the  Lord remaineth under curtains.\"[27] It was David's desire to build a  suitable House for the Lord and Nathan the prophet at first encouraged  the undertaking. The Lord spake to Nathan however, and directed him to  decline the king's proffered gift. Although Jehovah had been without a  fixed place recognized by the people as His, though as He said He had  not dwelt in a house amongst Israel, but had gone from tent to tent  and from one tabernacle to another,[28] though as the context implies,  the Lord had been neglected in the long delay attending the erection  of a house to His name, nevertheless David could not be honored with  the commission or even the permission to build such a house for he  was accounted a man of blood.[29] Let us not undertake to judge the  extent of David's offending; to do so would be to usurp the Divine  prerogative; it is enough for us to know that even the gift of royalty  may be declined if there be aught requiring reconciliation between the  mortal and his God. David, however, was permitted to provide means and  to gather material which afterward should be used in the erection of  the Temple,[30] moreover, the very site on which the great building  was subsequently erected was chosen and sanctified through his agency.  A great pestilence had fallen {32} upon Israel, and the Angel of the  Lord, sent forth with the warrant of destruction, was seen by David,  standing, sword in hand, on Mount Moriah at the threshing floor of  Araunah the Jebusite.[31] That spot, hallowed by the presence of a  heavenly messenger, though that messenger was the Angel of Death, was  marked by the erection of an altar, as the Lord directed through the  prophet Gad.[32]    As David realized that his years of life were few, he laid upon  Solomon, his son and chosen successor, the solemn charge to build the  house he had been forbidden to build. The king dwelt pathetically upon  his own disqualification, and then repeated the Lord's promise of  acceptance at the hand of Solomon. The scriptural record runs thus:        \"So David prepared abundantly before his death.        \"Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an      house for the Lord God of Israel.        \"And David said to Solomon. My son, as for me, it was in my mind to      build an house unto the name of the Lord my God:        \"But the word of the Lord came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood      abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house      unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in      my sight.        \"Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest;      and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his      name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto      Israel in his days.        \"He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I      will be his father: and I will establish the throne of his kingdom      over Israel for ever.        {33} \"Now, my son, the Lord be with thee; and prosper thou, and      build the house of the Lord thy God, as he hath said of thee.        \"Only the Lord give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee      charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the Lord      thy God.        \"Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfill the      statues and judgments which the Lord charged Moses with concerning      Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.        \"Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the      Lord an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand      talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it      is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou      mayest add thereto.        \"Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and      workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for      every manner of work.        \"Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no      number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the Lord be with thee.        \"David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his      son, saying,        \"Is not the Lord your God with you? and hath he not given you rest      on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into      mine hand; and the land is subdued before the Lord, and before his      people.        \"Now set your heart and your soul to seek the Lord your God; arise      therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the Lord God, to bring the      ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the holy vessels of God, into      the house that is to be built to the name of the Lord.\"[33]    David gave Solomon"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4524"],[0,"Familiar Letters on Chemistry, and Its Relation to Commerce, Physiology, and (#6)"],[1," produce steam, and by it a  certain amount of force. If we should assume, (which, however, is  not proved,) that the quantity of force is unequal in these  cases,--that, for instance, we had obtained double or triple the  amount in the galvanic pile, or that in this mode of generating  force less loss is sustained,--we must still recollect the  equivalents of zinc and coal, and make these elements of our  calculation. According to the experiments of Despretz, 6 pounds  weight of zinc, in combining with oxygen, develops no more heat than  1 pound of coal; consequently, under equal conditions, we can  produce six times the amount of force with a pound of coal as with a  pound of zinc. It is therefore obvious that it would be more  advantageous to employ coal instead of zinc, even if the latter  produced four times as much force in a galvanic pile, as an equal  weight of coal by its combustion under a boiler. Indeed it is highly  probable, that if we burn under the boiler of a steam-engine the  quantity of coal required for smelting the zinc from its ores, we  shall produce far more force than the whole of the zinc so obtained  could originate in any form of apparatus whatever.    Heat, electricity, and magnetism, have a similar relation to each  other as the chemical equivalents of coal, zinc, and oxygen. By a  certain measure of electricity we produce a corresponding proportion  of heat or of magnetic power; we obtain that electricity by chemical  affinity, which in one shape produces heat, in another electricity  or magnetism. A certain amount of affinity produces an equivalent of  electricity in the same manner as, on the other hand, we decompose  equivalents of chemical compounds by a definite measure of  electricity. The magnetic force of the pile is therefore limited to  the extent of the chemical affinity, and in the case before us is  obtained by the combination of the zinc and sulphuric acid. In the  combustion of coal, the heat results from, and is measured by, the  affinity of the oxygen of the atmosphere for that substance.    It is true that with a very small expense of zinc, we can make an  iron wire a magnet capable of sustaining a thousand pounds weight of  iron; let us not allow ourselves to be misled by this. Such a magnet  could not raise a single pound weight of iron two inches, and  therefore could not impart motion. The magnet acts like a rock,  which while at rest presses with a weight of a thousand pounds upon  a basis; it is like an inclosed lake, without an outlet and without  a fall. But it may be said, we have, by mechanical arrangements,  given it an outlet and a fall. True; and this must be regarded as a  great triumph of mechanics; and I believe it is susceptible of  further improvements, by which greater force may be obtained. But  with every conceivable advantage of mechanism, no one will dispute  that one pound of coal, under the boiler of a steam-engine, will  give motion to a mass several hundred times greater than a pound of  zinc in the galvanic pile.    Our experience of the employment of electro-magnetism as a motory  power is, however, too recent to enable us to foresee the ultimate  results of contrivances to apply it; and, therefore, those who have  devoted themselves to solve the problem of its application should  not be discouraged, inasmuch as it would undoubtedly be a most  important achievement to supersede the steam-engine, and thus escape  the danger of railroads, even at double their expense.    Professor Weber of Gottingen has thrown out a suggestion, that if a  contrivance could be devised to enable us to convert at will the  wheels of the steam-carriage into magnets, we should be enabled to  ascend and descend acclivities with great facility. This notion may  ultimately be, to a certain extent, realised.    The employment of the galvanic pile as a motory power, however,  must, like every other contrivance, depend upon the question of its  relative economy: probably some time hence it may so far succeed as  to be adopted in certain favourable localities; it may stand in the  same relation to steam power as the manufacture of beet sugar bears  to that of cane, or as the production of gas from oils and resins to  that from mineral coal.    The history of beet-root sugar affords us an excellent illustration  of the effect of prices upon commercial productions. This branch of  industry seems at length, as to its processes, to be perfected. The  most beautiful white sugar is now manufactured from the beet-root,  in the place of the treacle-like sugar, having the taste of the  root, which was first obtained; and instead of 3 or 4 per cent., the  proportion obtained by Achard, double or even treble that amount is  now produced. And notwithstanding the perfection of the manufacture,  it is probable it will ere long be in most places entirely  discontinued. In the years 1824 to 1827, the prices of agricultural  produce were much lower than at present, while the price of sugar  was the same. At that time one malter [1] of wheat was 10s., and one  klafter [2] of wood 18s., and land was falling in price. Thus, food  and fuel were cheap, and the demand for sugar unlimited; it was,  therefore, advantageous to grow beet-root, and to dispose of the  produce of land as sugar. All these circumstances are now different.  A malter of wheat costs 18s.; a klafter of wood, 30s. to 36s. Wages  have risen, but not in proportion, whilst the price of colonial  sugar has fallen. Within the limits of the German commercial league,  as, for instance, at Frankfort-on-the-Maine, a pound of the whitest  and best loaf sugar is 7d.; the import duty is 31/d., or 30s. per  cwt., leaving 31/d. as the price of the sugar. In the year 1827,  then, one malter of wheat was equal to 40 lbs. weight of sugar,  whilst at present that quantity of wheat is worth 70 lbs. of sugar.  If indeed fuel were the same in price as formerly, and 70 lbs. of  sugar could be obtained from the same quantity of the root as then  yielded 40 lbs., it might still be advantageously produced; but the  amount, if now obtained by the most approved methods of extraction,  falls far short of this; and as fuel is double the price, and labour  dearer, it follows that, at present, it is far more advantageous to  cultivate wheat and to purchase sugar.    There are, however, other elements which must enter into our  calculations; but these serve to confirm our conclusion that the  manufacture of beet-root sugar as a commercial speculation must  cease. The leaves and residue of the root, after the juice was  expressed, were used as food for cattle, and their value naturally  increased with the price of grain. By the process formerly pursued,  75 lbs. weight of juice were obtained from 100 lbs. of beet-root,  and gave 5 lbs. of sugar. The method of Schutzenbach, which was  eagerly adopted by the manufacturers, produced from the same  quantity of root 8 lbs. of sugar; but it was attended with more  expense to produce, and the loss of the residue as food for cattle.  The increased expense in this process arises from the larger  quantity of fuel required to evaporate the water; for instead of  merely evaporating the juice, the dry residue is treated with water,  and we require fuel sufficient to evaporate 106 lbs. of fluid  instead of 75 lbs., and the residue is only fit for manure. The  additional 3 lbs. of sugar are purchased at the expense of much  fuel, and the loss of the residue as an article of food.    If the valley of the Rhine possessed mines of diamonds as rich as  those of Golconda, Visiapoor, or the Brazils, they would probably  not be worth the working: at those places the cost of extraction is  28s. to 30s. the carat. With us it amounts to three or four times as  much--to more, in fact, than diamonds are worth in the market. The  sand of the Rhine contains gold; and in the Grand Duchy of Baden  many persons are occupied in gold-washing when wages are low; but as  soon as they rise, this employment ceases. The manufacture of sugar  from beet-root, in the like manner, twelve to fourteen years ago  offered advantages which are now lost: instead, therefore, of  maintaining it at a great sacrifice, it would be more reasonable,  more in accordance with true natural economy, to cultivate other and  more valuable productions, and with them purchase sugar. Not only  would the state be the gainer, but every member of the community.  This argument does not apply, perhaps, to France and Bohemia, where  the prices of fuel and of colonial sugar are very different to those  in Germany.    The manufacture of gas for lighting, from coal, resin, and oils,  stands with us on the same barren ground.    The price of the materials from which gas is manufactured in England  bears a direct proportion to the price of corn: there the cost of  tallow and oil is twice as great as in Germany, but iron and coal  are two-thirds cheaper; and even in England the manufacture of gas  is only advantageous when the other products of the distillation of  coal, the coke, &c., can be sold.    It would certainly be esteemed one of the greatest discoveries of  the age if any one could succeed in condensing coal gas into a  white, dry, solid, odourless substance, portable, and capable of  being placed upon a candlestick, or burned in a lamp. Wax, tallow,  and oil, are combustible gases in a solid or fluid form, which offer  many advantages for lighting, not possessed by gas: they furnish, in  well-constructed lamps, as much light, without requiring the  expensive apparatus necessary for the combustion of gas, and they  are generally more economical. In large towns, or such establishments  as hotels, where coke is in demand, and where losses in stolen tallow  or oil must be considered, together with the labour of snuffing  candles and cleaning lamps, the higher price of gas is compensated.  In places where gas can be manufactured from resin, oil of turpentine,  and"]]]
