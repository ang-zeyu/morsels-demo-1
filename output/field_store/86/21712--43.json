When I could speak with him alone I  said: 'Pray tell me how I can manage to acquire the misfortunes you  have undergone.  Here I have everything that I desire, and it makes me  very unhappy.'    \"The stranger laughed at me, at first; and I found some pleasure in the  humiliation I then felt.  But it did not last long, for presently he  grew sober and advised me to run away from home and seek adventure.    \"'Once away from your father's castle,' said he, 'troubles will fall  upon you thick enough to satisfy even your longings.'    \"'That is what I am afraid of!' I answered.  'I don't want to be  satisfied, even with troubles.  What I seek is unsatisfied longings.'    \"'Nevertheless,' said he, 'I advise you to travel.  Everything will  probably go wrong with you, and then you will be happy.'    \"I acted upon the stranger's advice and ran away from home the next  day.  After journeying a long time I commenced to feel the pangs of  hunger, and was just beginning to enjoy myself when a knight rode by  and gave me a supply of food.  At this rebuff I could not restrain my  tears, but while I wept my horse stumbled and threw me over his head.  I hoped at first I had broken my neck, and was just congratulating  myself upon the misfortune, when a witch-woman came along and rubbed  some ointment upon my bruises, in spite of my protests.  To my great  grief the pain left me, and I was soon well again.  But, as a slight  compensation for my disappointment, my horse had run away; so I began  my journey anew and on foot.    \"That afternoon I stepped into a nest of wasps, but the thoughtless  creatures flew away without stinging me.  Then I met a fierce tiger,  and my heart grew light and gay.  'Surely this will cause me  suffering!' I cried, and advanced swiftly upon the brute.  But the  cowardly tiger turned tail and ran to hide in the bushes, leaving me  unhurt!    \"Of course, my many disappointments were some consolation; but not  much.  That night I slept on the bare ground, and hoped I should catch  a severe cold; but no such joy was to be mine.    \"Yet the next afternoon I experienced my first pleasure.  The thieves  caught me, stripped off all my fine clothes and jewels and beat me  well.  Then they carried me to their cave, dressed me in rags, and  perched me on the top of the casks, where the slightest movement on my  part would send me tumbling among the sword points.  This was really  delightful, and I was quite happy until you came and released me.    \"I thought then that I might gain some pleasure by provoking you to  anger; and our fight was the result.  That blow on the ear was  exquisite, and by forcing me to become your servant you have made me,  for the first time in my life, almost contented.  For I hope in your  company to experience a great many griefs and disappointments.\"    As Nerle concluded his story Prince Marvel turned to him and grasped  his hand.    \"Accept my sympathy!\" said he.  \"I know exactly how you feel, for my  own life during the past few centuries has not been much different.\"    \"The past few centuries!\" gasped Nerle.  \"What do you mean?\"    At this the prince blushed, seeing he had nearly disclosed his secret.  But he said, quickly:    \"Does it not seem centuries when one is unhappy?\"    \"It does, indeed!\" responded Nerle, earnestly.  \"But please tell me  your story.\"    \"Not now,\" said Prince Marvel, with a smile.  \"It will please you to  desire in vain to hear a tale I will not tell.  Yet I promise that on  the day we part company I shall inform you who I am.\"        7.  The Gray Men    The adventurers gave no heed to the path they followed after leaving  the cave of the reformed thieves, but their horses accidentally took  the direction of the foot-hills that led into the wild interior Kingdom  of Spor.  Therefore the travelers, when they had finished their  conversation and begun to look about them, found themselves in a  rugged, mountainous country that was wholly unlike the green plains of  Heg they had left behind.    Now, as I have before said, the most curious and fearful of the island  people dwelt in this Kingdom of Spor.  They held no friendly  communication with their neighbors, and only left their own mountains  to plunder and rob; and so sullen and fierce were they on these  occasions that every one took good care to keep out of their way until  they had gone back home again.    There was much gossip about the unknown king of Spor, who had never yet  been seen by any one except his subjects; and some thought he must be  one of the huge giants of Spor; and others claimed he was a dwarf, like  his tiny but ferocious dart-slingers; and still others imagined him one  of the barbarian tribe, or a fellow to the terrible Gray Men.  But, of  course, no one knew positively, and all these guesses were very wide of  the mark.  The only certainty about this king was that his giants,  dwarfs, barbarians and Gray Men meekly acknowledged his rule and obeyed  his slightest wish; for though they might be terrible to others, their  king was still more terrible to them.    Into this Kingdom of Spor Prince Marvel and Nerle had now penetrated  and, neither knowing nor caring where they were, continued along the  faintly defined paths the horses had found.  Presently, however, they  were startled by a peal of shrill, elfish laughter, and raising their  eyes they beheld a horrid-looking old man seated upon a high rock near  by.    \"Why do you laugh?\" asked Prince Marvel, stopping his horse.    \"Have you been invited?  Tell me--have you been invited?\" demanded the  old man, chuckling to himself as if much amused.    \"Invited where?\" inquired the prince.    \"To Spor, stupid!  To the Kingdom of Spor!  To the land of King  Terribus!\" shrieked the old man, going into violent peals of laughter.    \"We go and come as we please,\" answered Prince Marvel, calmly.    \"Go--yes!  Go if you will.  But you'll never come back--never! never!  never!\" The little old man seemed to consider this such a good joke  that he bent nearly double with laughing, and so lost his balance and  toppled off the rock, disappearing from their view; but they could hear  him laugh long after they had passed on and left him far behind them.    \"A strange creature!\" exclaimed the prince thoughtfully.    \"But perhaps he speaks truth,\" answered Nerle, \"if, in fact, we have  been rash enough to enter the Kingdom of Spor.  Even my father, the  bravest baron in Heg, has never dared venture within the borders of  Spor.  For all men fear its mysterious king.\"    \"In that case,\" replied Prince Marvel, \"it is time some one  investigated this strange kingdom.  People have left King Terribus and  his wild subjects too much to themselves; instead of stirring them up  and making them behave themselves.\"    Nerle smiled at this speech.    \"They are the fiercest people on the Enchanted Island,\" said he, \"and  there are thousands upon thousands who obey this unknown king.  But if  you think we dare defy them I am willing to go on.  Perhaps our  boldness will lead them into torturing me, or starving me to death; and  at the very least I ought to find much trouble and privation in the  Kingdom of Spor.\"    \"Time will determine that,\" said the prince, cheerfully.    They had now ridden into a narrow defile of the mountains, the pathway  being lined with great fragments of rock.  Happening to look over his  shoulder Prince Marvel saw that as they passed these rocks a man  stepped from behind each fragment and followed after them, their  numbers thus constantly increasing until hundreds were silently  treading in the wake of the travelers.    These men were very peculiar in appearance, their skins being as gray  as the rocks themselves, while their only clothing consisted of gray  cloth tunics belted around the waists with bands of gray fox-hide.  They bore no weapons except that each was armed with a fork, having  three sharp tines six inches in length, which the Gray Men carried  stuck through their fox-hide belts.    Nerle also looked back and saw the silent throng following them, and  the sight sent such a cold shiver creeping up his spine that he smiled  with pleasure.  There was no way to avoid the Gray Men, for the path  was so narrow that the horsemen could not turn aside; but Prince Marvel  was not disturbed, and seemed not to mind being followed, so long as no  one hindered his advance.    He rode steadily on, Nerle following, and after climbing upward for a  long way the path began to descend, presently leading them into a  valley of wide extent, in the center of which stood an immense castle  with tall domes that glittered as if covered with pure gold.  A broad  roadway paved with white marble reached from the mountain pass to the  entrance of this castle, and on each side of this roadway stood lines  of monstrous giants, armed with huge axes thrust into their belts and  thick oak clubs, studded with silver spikes, which were carried over  their left shoulders.    The assembled giants were as silent as the Gray Men, and stood  motionless while Prince Marvel and Nerle rode slowly up the marble  roadway.  But all their brows were scowling terribly and their eyes  were red and glaring--as if they were balls of fire.    \"I begin to feel very pleasant,\" said Nerle, \"for surely we shall not  get away from these folks without a vast deal of trouble.  They do not  seem to oppose our advance, but it is plain they will not allow us any  chance of retreat.\"    \"We do not wish to retreat,\" declared the prince.    Nerle cast another glance behind, and saw that the Gray Men had halted  at the edge of the valley, while the giants were closing up as soon as  the horses passed them and now marched in close file in their rear.    \"It strikes me,\" he muttered, softly, \"that this is like to prove our  last adventure.\" But although Prince Marvel might have heard the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5180"],[0,"Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) Ruling (#6)"],[1,"search engines and directories combined.  No currently available  method or combination of methods for collecting URLs can collect  the addresses of all URLs on the Web.  The portion of the Web that is not theoretically indexable  through the use of \"spidering\" technology, because other Web  pages do not link to it, is called the \"Deep Web.\"  Such sites or  pages can still be made publicly accessible without being made  publicly indexable by, for example, using individual or mass  emailings (also known as \"spam\") to distribute the URL to  potential readers or customers, or by using types of Web links  that cannot be found by spiders but can be seen and used by  readers.  \"Spamming\" is a common method of distributing to  potential customers links to sexually explicit content that is  not indexable.  Because the Web is decentralized, it is impossible to say  exactly how large it is.  A 2000 study estimated a total of 7.1  million unique Web sites, which at the Web's historical rate of  growth, would have increased to 11 million unique sites as of  September 2001.  Estimates of the total number of Web pages vary,  but a figure of 2 billion is a reasonable estimate of the number  of Web pages that can be reached, in theory, by standard search  engines.  We need not make a specific finding as to a figure, for  by any measure the Web is extremely vast, and it is constantly  growing.  The indexable Web is growing at a rate of approximately  1.5 million pages per day.  The size of the un-indexable Web, or  the \"Deep Web,\" while impossible to determine precisely, is  estimated to be two to ten times that of the publicly indexable  Web.      In addition to growing rapidly, Web pages and sites are  constantly being removed, or changing their content.  Web sites  or pages can change content without changing their domain name  addresses or IP addresses.  Individual Web pages have an average  life span of approximately 90 days.  3.        The Amount of Sexually Explicit Material on the  Web  There is a vast amount of sexually explicit material  available via the Internet and the Web.  Sexually explicit  material on the Internet is easy to access using any public  search engine, such as, for example, Google or AltaVista.  Although much of the sexually explicit material available on the  Web is posted on commercial sites that require viewers to pay in  order to gain access to the site, a large number of sexually  explicit sites may be accessed for free and without providing any  registration information.  Most importantly, some Web sites that  contain sexually explicit content have innocuous domain names and  therefore can be reached accidentally.  A commonly cited example  is http://www.whitehouse.com.  Other innocent-sounding URLs that  retrieve graphic, sexually explicit depictions include  http://www.boys.com, http://www.girls.com,  http://www.coffeebeansupply.com, and http://www.BookstoreUSA.com.   Moreover, commercial Web sites that contain sexually explicit  material often use a technique of attaching pop-up windows to  their sites, which open new windows advertising other sexually  explicit sites without any prompting by the user.  This technique  makes it difficult for a user quickly to exit all of the pages  containing sexually explicit material, whether he or she  initially accessed such material intentionally or not.      The percentage of Web pages on the indexed Web containing  sexually explicit content is relatively small.  Recent estimates  indicate that no more than 1-2% of the content on the Web is  pornographic or sexually explicit.  However, the absolute number  of Web sites offering free sexually explicit material is  extremely large, approximately 100,000 sites.  4.       American Public Libraries  The more than 9,000 public libraries in the United States  are typically funded (at least in large part) by state or local  governments.  They are frequently overseen by a board of  directors that is either elected or is appointed by an elected  official or a body of elected officials.  We heard testimony from  librarians and library board members working in eight public  library systems in different communities across the country, some  of whom are also plaintiffs in this case.  They hailed from the  following library systems: Fort Vancouver, Washington; Fulton  County, Indiana; Greenville, South Carolina; a regional  consortium of libraries centered in Madison, Wisconsin; Multnomah  County, Oregon; Norfolk, Virginia; Tacoma, Washington; and  Westerville, Ohio.  The parties also took depositions from  several other librarians and library board members who did not  testify during the trial, and submitted a number of other  documents regarding individual libraries' policies.  1.        The Mission of Public Libraries, and Their  Reference and Collection Development Practices        American public libraries operate in a wide variety of  communities, and it is not surprising that they do not all view  their mission identically.  Nor are their practices uniform.  Nevertheless, they generally share a common mission  to provide  patrons with a wide range of information and ideas.  Public libraries across the country have endorsed the  American Library Association's (\"ALA\") \"Library Bill of Rights\"  and/or \"Freedom to Read Statement,\" including every library  testifying on behalf of the defendants in this case.  The  \"Library Bill of Rights,\" first adopted by the ALA in 1948,  provides, among other things, that \"[b]ooks and other library  resources should be provided for the interest, information, and  enlightenment of all people of the community the library serves.\"   It also states that libraries \"should provide materials and  information presenting all points of view on current and  historical issues\" and that library materials \"should not be  proscribed or removed because of partisan or doctrinal  disapproval.\"  The ALA's \"Freedom to Read\" statement, adopted in 1953 and  most recently updated in July 2000, states, among other things,  that \"[i]t is in the public interest for publishers and  librarians to make available the widest diversity of views and  expressions, including those that are unorthodox or unpopular  with the majority.\"  It also states that \"[i]t is the  responsibility of . . . librarians . . . to contest encroachments  upon th[e] freedom [to read] by individuals or groups seeking to  impose their own standards or tastes upon the community at  large.\"      Public libraries provide information not only for  educational purposes, but also for recreational, professional,  and other purposes.  For example, Ginnie Cooper, Director of the  Multnomah County Library, testified that some of the library's  most popular items include video tapes of the British  Broadcasting Corporation's \"Fawlty Towers\" series, and also print  and \"books on tape\" versions of science fiction, romance, and  mystery novels.  Many public libraries include sexually explicit  materials in their print collection, such as The Joy of Sex and  The Joy of Gay Sex.  Very few public libraries, however, collect  more graphic sexually explicit materials, such as XXX-rated  videos, or Hustler magazine.  The mission of public librarians is to provide their patrons  with a wide array of information, and they surely do so.  Reference librarians across America answer more than 7 million  questions weekly.  If a patron has a specialized need for  information not available in the public library, the professional  librarian will use a reference interview to find out what  information is needed to help the user, including the purpose for  which an item will be used.  Reference librarians are trained to  assist patrons without judging the patron's purpose in seeking  information, or the content of the information that the patron is  seeking.      Many public libraries routinely provide patrons with access  to materials not in their collections through the use of  bibliographic access tools and interlibrary loan programs.  Public libraries typically will assist patrons in obtaining  access to all materials except those that are illegal, even if  they do not collect those materials in their physical collection.   In order to provide this access, a librarian may attempt to find  material not included in the library's own collection in other  libraries in the system, through interlibrary loan, or through a  referral, perhaps to a government agency or a commercial  bookstore.  Interlibrary loan is expensive, however, and is  therefore used infrequently.  Public librarians also apply professional standards to their  collection development practices.  Public libraries generally  make material selection decisions and frame policies governing  collection development at the local level.  Collection  development is a key subject in the curricula of Masters of  Library Science programs and is defined by certain practices.  In  general, professional standards guide public librarians to build,  develop and create collections that have certain characteristics,  such as balance in its coverage and requisite and appropriate  quality.  To this end, the goal of library collections is not  universal coverage, but rather to find those materials that would  be of the greatest direct benefit or interest to the community.  In making selection decisions, librarians consider criteria  including the content of the material, its accuracy, the title's  niche in relation to the rest of the collection, the authority of  the author, the publisher, the work's presentation, and how it  compares with other material available in the same genre or on  the same subject.      In pursuing the goal of achieving a balanced collection that  serves the needs and interests of their patrons, librarians  generally have a fair amount of autonomy, but may also be guided  by a library's collection development policy.  These collection  development policies are often drawn up in conjunction"]]]
