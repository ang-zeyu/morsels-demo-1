The rugged frontier of  their highland fief had, in that time, been extended far into the  fertile March of Ancona, until it embraced a compact and influential  state. Saving their subjects, by a gentle and judicious sway, from the  wild ferments that distracted democratic communities, and from the yet  more dire revolutions which from time to time convulsed adjoining  principalities, they so cultivated the arts of war, and so encouraged  the pursuits of peace, that their mountain-land gained a European  reputation as the best nursery of arms, their capital as the favoured  asylum of letters. That glory has now become faint; for the writers by  whom it has been chiefly transmitted belong not to the existing  generation, and command few sympathies in our times. But the echoes of  its fame still linger around the mist-clad peaks of Umbria, and in the  dilapidated palace-halls of the olden race. To gather its evanescent  substance in a form not uninteresting to English readers, is the  object of the present attempt. Should it be so far successful as to  attract some of his countrymen to the history, literature, and arts of  Italy, they will not, perhaps, be ungrateful to the humble pioneer who  has indicated a path to literary treasures hitherto inadequately known  to them. For such an undertaking he possesses no qualification,  beyond a sincere interest in the past ages of that sunny land, and a  warm admiration for her arts during their epoch of brilliancy. But a  residence there of six years has afforded him considerable  opportunities of collecting materials for this work, which he has been  anxious not to neglect.    A great portion of the duchy of Urbino, including its principal towns,  has been thrice visited, and nearly every accessible library of  Central Italy has been examined for unedited matter. To these  researches, time and labour have been freely given; and in the few  instances when his attempts were foiled by jealousy or accident, the  author has generally had the satisfaction of believing that success  would have been comparatively unproductive. To this, two exceptions  should be mentioned. He was prevented by illness from recently  visiting the libraries or archives at Venice; and the Barberini  Library at Rome has been entirely closed for some years, in  consequence of a disgraceful pillage of its treasures. Should the  latter be again made accessible, the MSS. amassed by the Pontiff under  whom Urbino devolved to the Church, and by his nephews, its two first  Legates, can hardly fail to throw much light upon the duchy. The  invaluable treasures of the Vatican archives have been to him, as to  others, a sealed book; but the Urbino MSS. in the Vatican Library,  those of the Oliveriana at Pesaro, and of the Magliabechiana at  Florence, have afforded copious sources of original information, and  have supplied means for rectifying omissions and errors of previous  writers. Some of these materials had been freely drawn upon by Muzio,  Leoni, and Baldi, biographers of the early dukes of Urbino, who have  not, however, by any means exhausted the soil; the amount that  remained for after inquirers may be estimated from the single instance  of Sanzi's almost unnoticed rhyming Chronicle of Duke Federigo, in  about 26,000 lines.    The reigns of Dukes Federigo, Guidobaldo I., and Francesco Maria I.,  from 1443 to 1538, formed the brightest era of Urbino, and included  the most stirring period of Italian history, the golden age of Italian  art; but our regnal series would be incomplete without Dukes  Guidobaldo II. and Francesco Maria II., who prolonged the independence  of the duchy until 1631, when it lapsed to the Holy See. Its history  thus naturally divides itself into five books, representing as many  reigns; yet, as these sovereigns were of two different dynasties, it  will be convenient to consider separately the origin of each, and the  influence which they respectively exercised on literature and the fine  arts, thus giving matter for four additional books. In Book First of  these we shall briefly sketch the early condition of the duchy, with  the establishment of the family of Montefeltro as Counts, and  eventually as Dukes, of Urbino; but, regarding Duke Federigo as the  earliest of them worthy of detailed illustration, we shall, in Book  Second, with his succession, enter upon the immediate scope of our  work.           *       *       *       *       *    Among many interesting publications upon Italy which have recently  issued from the English press, is that of Signor Mariotti.[3] With a  command of our language rarely attained by foreigners, he has clothed  a vast mass of information in an exuberant style, savouring of the  sweet South. As an episode to his sketch of Tasso, he dedicates to the  two dynasties who ruled in Urbino a single page, in which there occur  seven misstatements. John or Giovanni della Rovere was never sovereign  of Camerino; his cousin, Girolamo Riario, held no ecclesiastical  dignity; the \"unrivalled splendour\" of the Montefeltrian reign at  Urbino did not extend over even one century; the wife of Giovanni  della Rovere was neither daughter nor heiress of Guidobaldo I. of  Urbino, nor had she any \"just claim to his throne\"; Duke Francesco  Maria did not remove either his library or treasures of art to Mantua.  These slips, by a writer generally painstaking and correct, surely  indicate some deficiency in the accessible sources of information  regarding a principality which has for centuries been proverbial, in  the words of Tasso, as \"the stay and refuge of gifted men.\"    [Footnote 3: I speak of the first edition of his _Italy_; the reprint  of 1848 is enlarged but not improved.]    The truth is, that although the Dukes of Urbino figure everywhere as  friends of learning and patrons of art, no work has yet appeared  establishing their especial claim to such distinction, in a land where  courts abounded and dilettanteship was a fashion. That of Riposati has  indeed given us the series of these sovereigns, but his biographical  sketches are meagre, and chiefly illustrative of their coinage. The  lives of Dukes Federigo and Francesco Maria I., by Muzio and Leoni,  are excessively rare; Baldi's crude biographies are either recently  and obscurely published, or remain in manuscript. Out of Italy these  authors are scarcely known. This paucity of illustration is not,  however, the only cause why these princes have continued in unmerited  obscurity. Whilst endeavouring to guard himself against undue  hero-worship, and to subject the policy and character of those  sovereigns to the tests within his reach, the author has been obliged  in some instances to assume the functions of an advocate, and to  defend them from charges unjustly or inadvisedly brought. This will be  especially found in the life of Duke Francesco Maria I., who, as the  victim of Leo X., and the opponent of Florence, has met with scanty  justice from the three standard historians of that age in Italy,  France, and England. The patriotism of Guicciardini, as a Florentine,  was inherently provincial; as a partisan of the Medici, he had no  sympathies with a prince whom they hated with the loathing of  ingratitude; as an annalist he never forgot the day when he had  cowered before the lofty spirit at the council-board. All that he has  written of Francesco Maria is therefore tinged with gall, and his  authority has been too implicitly followed by Sismondi, who, uniformly  biassed against princes by his democratic prejudices, and seeing in  Guicciardini an eminent denizen of a nominal republic, and in the Duke  a petty autocrat, decided their respective merits accordingly. Again,  Roscoe could save the consistency and justice of Leo only by  misrepresenting the character of his early friend and eventual victim,  and has not shrunk from the sacrifice. It has thus happened that,  whilst ordinary readers have scanty access to details regarding Urbino  and its dynasties, these names have been unduly excluded from many a  page in Italian annals which they were well qualified to adorn.[4]    [Footnote 4: Better evidence of the deficient information hitherto  accessible could hardly be desired than the fact that ROSCOE, in his  _Life of Lorenzo de' Medici_, ch. viii., entirely mistakes the family  name of the first dynasty of Urbino.]    To separate from the tangled web of Italian story threads of local and  individual interest would be fatal to unity of texture and subject. It  will, therefore, be necessary to treat Urbino and its Dukes as  integral portions of the Ausonian community, and, while distinguishing  every characteristic detail, to view them as subsidiary to the general  current of events. But, since this course offers at every moment  temptations to launch our tiny bark on a stream perilous to its pilot,  prudence will keep us mostly among those eddies which, unheeded by  more skilful mariners, may afford leisure for minute observation. If  it be thought that the martial renown of Federigo and Francesco Maria  I. merited more ample accounts of their campaigns, we may plead that  arms are but a portion of our object. To mankind battle-fields are  instructive chiefly from their results; while foreign and domestic  policy, the progress of civilisation and manners, of letters and art,  are in every respect themes of profitable inquiry.    In a work undertaken with the hope of attracting general readers to  the history and arts of Italy, controversial disquisitions would be  misplaced. The student may detect occasional attempts to reconcile  contradictory narratives and jarring conclusions; but religious  discussion is excluded from these pages.

Then forth in frenzy would they hie,      While wildly loose their red locks fly,      And, dancing round the blazing pile,      They made such barbarous mirth the while,      As best might to the mind recall      The boisterous joys of Odin's hall.\"    Amongst other traces of the northern observances which have descended to  our times, and of which we shall have occasion hereafter to speak, the  name of the festival itself has come down, and is still retained by our  Scottish brethren, as well as in some parts of England.    The Christian festival of the Nativity, with which these ancient  celebrations have been incorporated, appears to have been appointed at a  very early period after the establishment of the new religion. Its first  positive footsteps are met with in the second century, during the reign  of the Emperor Concordius; but the decretal epistles furnish us with  traces of it more remote. At whatever period, however, its formal  institution is to be placed, there can be no doubt that an event so  striking in its manner and so important in itself would be annually  commemorated amongst Christians from the days of the first apostles, who  survived our Lord's resurrection. As to the actual year of the birth of  Christ, as well as the _period_ of the year at which it took place,  great uncertainty seems to exist, and many controversies have been  maintained. One of the theories on the subject, held to be amongst the  most probable, places that event upwards of five years earlier than the  vulgar era, which latter, however, both as regards the year and _season_  of the year, was a tradition of the primitive Church. In the first ages  of that Church, and up till the Council of Nice, the celebration of the  Nativity and that of the Epiphany were united on the 25th of December,  from a belief that the birth of Christ was simultaneous with the  appearance of the star in the East which revealed it to the Gentiles.  The time of the year at which the Nativity fell has been placed, by  contending opinions, at the period of the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles,  at that of the Passover, and again at that of the Feast of the  Expiation, whose date corresponds with the close of our September.  Clemens Alexandrinus informs us that it was kept by many Christians in  April, and by others in the Egyptian month Pachon, which answers to our  May. Amongst the arguments which have been produced against the theory  that places its occurrence in the depth of winter, one has been gathered  from that passage in the sacred history of the event which states that  \"there were shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their  flocks by night.\" It is an argument, however, which does not seem very  conclusive in a pastoral country and Eastern climate. Besides the  employment which this question has afforded to the learned, it has, in  times of religious excitement, been debated with much Puritanical  virulence and sectarian rancor. For the purposes of commemoration,  however, it is unimportant whether the celebration shall fall or not at  the precise anniversary period of the event commemorated; and the  arrangement which assigns to it its place in our calendar fixes it at a  season when men have leisure for a lengthened festivity, and when their  minds are otherwise wholesomely acted upon by many touching thoughts and  solemn considerations.    From the first introduction of Christianity into these islands, the  period of the Nativity seems to have been kept as a season of festival,  and its observance recognized as a matter of state. The Wittenagemots of  our Saxon ancestors were held under the solemn sanctions and beneficent  influences of the time; and the series of high festivities established  by the Anglo-Saxon kings appear to have been continued, with yearly  increasing splendor and multiplied ceremonies, under the monarchs of the  Norman race. From the court the spirit of revelry descended by all its  thousand arteries throughout the universal frame of society, visiting  its furthest extremities and most obscure recesses, and everywhere  exhibiting its action, as by so many pulses, upon the traditions and  superstitions and customs which were common to all or peculiar to each.  The pomp and ceremonial of the royal observance were imitated in the  splendid establishments of the more wealthy nobles, and more faintly  reflected from the diminished state of the petty baron. The revelries of  the baronial castle found echoes in the hall of the old manor-house; and  these were, again, repeated in the tapestried chamber of the country  magistrate or from the sanded parlor of the village inn. Merriment was  everywhere a matter of public concernment; and the spirit which  assembles men in families now congregated them by districts then.    [Illustration: BARONIAL HALL.--_Page 42._]    Neither, however, were the feelings wanting which connected the  superstitions of the season with the tutelage of the roof-tree, and  mingled its ceremonies with the sanctities of home. Men might meet in  crowds to feast beneath the banner of the baron, but the mistletoe hung  over each man's own door. The black-jacks might go round in the hall of  the lord of the manor; but they who could had a wassail-bowl of their  own. The pageantries and high observances of the time might draw men to  common centres or be performed on a common account, but the flame of the  Yule-log roared up all the individual chimneys of the land. Old Father  Christmas, at the head of his numerous and uproarious family, might ride  his goat through the streets of the city and the lanes of the village,  but he dismounted to sit for some few moments by each man's hearth;  while some one or another of his merry sons would break away, to  visit the remote farm-houses or show their laughing faces at many a poor  man's door. For be it observed, this worthy old gentleman and his  kind-hearted children were no respecters of persons. Though trained to  courts, they had ever a taste for a country life. Though accustomed in  those days to the tables of princes, they sat freely down at the poor  man's board. Though welcomed by the peer, they showed no signs of  superciliousness when they found themselves cheek-by-jowl with the  pauper. Nay, they appear even to have preferred the less exalted  society, and to have felt themselves more at ease in the country mansion  of the private gentleman than in the halls of kings. Their reception in  those high places was accompanied, as royal receptions are apt to be, by  a degree of state repugnant to their frank natures; and they seem never  to have been so happy as when they found themselves amongst a set of  free and easy spirits,--whether in town or country,--unrestrained by the  punctilios of etiquette, who had the privilege of laughing just when it  struck them to do so, without inquiring wherefore, or caring how loud.    Then, what a festival they created! The land rang with their joyous  voices, and the frosty air steamed with the incense of the good things  provided for their entertainment. Everybody kept holiday but the cooks;  and all sounds known to the human ear seemed mingled in the merry paean,  save the gobble of the turkeys. _There were no turkeys_,--at least they  had lost their \"most sweet voices.\" The turnspits had a hard time of it,  too. That quaint little book which bears the warm and promising title of  \"Round about our Coal Fire\" tells us that \"by the time dinner was over  they would look as black and as greasy as a Welsh porridge-pot.\" Indeed,  the accounts of that time dwell with great and savory emphasis upon the  prominent share which eating and drinking had in the festivities of the  season. There must have been sad havoc made amongst the live-stock. That  there are turkeys at all in our days is only to be accounted for upon  the supposition of England having been occasionally replenished with  that article from the East; and our present possession of geese must be  explained by the well-known impossibility of extinguishing the race of  the goose. It is difficult to imagine a consumption equal to the  recorded provision. Men's gastronomic capacities appear to have been  enlarged for the occasion, as the energies expand to meet great  emergencies. \"The tables,\" says the same racy authority above quoted,  \"were all spread from the first to the last; the sirloyns of beef, the  minc'd-pies, the plumb-porridge, the capons, turkeys, geese, and  plumb-puddings were all brought upon the board; and all those who had  sharp stomachs and sharp knives eat heartily and were welcome, which  gave rise to the proverb,--        \"'Merry in the hall, when beards wag all!'\"    Now, _all_ men in those days appear to have had good stomachs, and, we  presume, took care to provide themselves with sharp knives. The only  recorded instance in which we find a failure of the latter is that  portentous one which occurred, many a long day since, in the court of  King Arthur, when the Christmas mirth was so strangely disturbed by the  mischievous interference of the Boy with the Mantle. Under the test  introduced by that imp of discord and which appears to have \"taken the  shine out of\" the monarch's own good sword Excalibur itself, there was  found but one knight, of all the hungry knights who sat at that Round  Table, whose weapon was sharp enough to carve the boar's head or hand  steady enough to carry the cup to his lip without spilling the lamb's  wool; and even he had a very narrow escape from the same incapacities.  But then, as we have said, this was at court, and under the influence of  a spell (with whose nature we take it for granted that our readers are  acquainted,--and, if not, we refer them to the Percy Ballads); and it is  probable that, in those early as in later days, tests of such extreme  delicacy were of far more dangerous introduction in the courts of kings  than amongst"]]]
