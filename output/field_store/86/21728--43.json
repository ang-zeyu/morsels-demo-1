In  winter we faced cold northers many mornings, and in the  afternoons, we often faced strong southwesterly winds on our way  home.    As we walked to school, other pupils from other farms joined us,  and then still others.  By the time we arrived at school, there  might be as many as 20 of us in one bunch.  One of the families  whose kids walked with us was the Bruner family.  Papa's younger  brother, Ed, married Eva Bruner.    What do you mean, \"Did we walk that three miles to school?\"    Of course we walked--except maybe two or three times a year when  the weather was extremely bad.    I might as well take time right here to mention another little  incident which took place along our school trail.  It involved  one of the Bruner boys.  And what happened to that boy should  never happen to anyone.  But when you get that many school kids  in one bunch, most anything is apt to happen, and it did this  time.    In the first place, I guess school trails shouldn't cut across  pastures, but they did.  In the second place, I haven't been able  to figure out why God made prickly pears, but He did.  In the  third place, if school kids are going to use the trails which  wind in and out among the thorny bushes and cactus plants, they  should never scuffle near prickly pears, but they did.  And in  the fourth place, if a boy scuffles and falls down, he should  never sit right flat down in a prickly pear, but he did.    After he got up, he went straight home.  His mother took the  tweezers and removed all the large thorns and many of the small  ones.  Then they took him to Mama because, they said, her eyes  were better.  She removed all she could see, which left the boy  in fairly good shape, I suppose, all things considered.    What we now know as kindergarten was unknown when I started to  school.  Beginners started in the Primer, and the Primer was not  a grade in school--it was a book.  As Webster defines it, \"an  elementary book for teaching children to read.\"    We went to school to learn to read, write, spell, and work  arithmetic problems--and to obey the teacher.    We also learned many other things that were not a part of the  regular curriculum and which were not necessarily sanctioned by  those in authority.  We grouped them all together and called them  \"recess.\"    In my first year, I went through the Primer, the first grade, and  far into the second grade.  I was almost ready for the third  grade at the beginning of my second year.  According to my  teacher and my parents, I was smart and well behaved.  I was a  good little boy.    Even at that early age, the teacher granted me special privileges  and I was in love with her.  My love and admiration for all  teachers, especially women teachers, went with me all through  high school and college, at times causing my wife some  displeasure.    During that first year in school, one side of my face became  paralyzed.  I was an ugly sight, especially when I laughed or  smiled.  Half of my face would smile and the other half would  just hang there, doing nothing.    The doctor prescribed some red medicine that Susie carried to  school every day and poured some down me ever-so-often.  It  tasted awful.  I was glad it was a beautiful red color.  I don't  believe I could have stood it if it had been brown.    Anyway, I slowly got over most of my ailment, but I'm sure it was  hard for my family to get rid of the horrible picture my  condition had printed on their memories.    Unfortunately, my paralysis was not my only ugliness.  I was born  with a \"wen\" in the corner of one eye next to my nose.  It was a  lump about the size of the end of my thumb--that of course,  depending on what age I was when you measured the end of my  thumb, and how much of my thumb you included in the measurement.  After all, how much of a thumb can you measure and still call it  the end.    At any rate, I was far from beautiful, even before the sagging of  half my face.    Not so with the rest of my family.  Papa was stately, superior in  quality, as generous as he was elegant, and he was a handsome  man.    Mama was a lovely woman.  I can remember back to when she was  about 33, and I can imagine how beautiful she must have looked to  Will Johnson 15 years earlier.  When I was very young, I liked to  watch her do her long hair up into one big plat, then coil it  round and round on top of her head and pin it so it wouldn't come  down.    Frank was handsome and admirable in the eyes of a younger brother  my age.  Susie was a good-looking girl.  However, all girls  looked good to me--as they were supposed to.  Earl's presence  would improve the looks of almost any group of kids.  And Joel  was downright pretty, that is, for a boy.  Although Albert and  William Robert were younger than I, and at times little more than  pesky little brothers, still I could easily see that they both  had something to be desired far above that which looked back at  me from my mirror.  And of course, Ollie Mae was as beautiful as  anything I had ever seen until I became 18 and fell in love.    The unsightly wen stayed with me until I was about 17--or  whenever it was I started shaving.  I couldn't bear the looks of  me in the mirror as I shaved.  So, one afternoon I drove over to  the Stamford Sanitarium and asked a doctor to remove it.  He got  me on the operating table and then asked me if I wanted him to  put me to sleep.    I told him, \"No, I want to watch what you are going to do to me.\"    So he handed me a mirror and began whittling on me.  And when he  had finished the operation, he sewed me up, stuck a patch over  the place, and told me to let someone else drive me back to  Hamlin.  But since it was only 22 miles, and since I had driven  over there alone, and since there was no one to drive me back, I  drove myself back and I've been disobeying doctors ever since.    But, we're getting ahead of our story.  Let's get back to our  younger days when my little sister was about two years old and  she had two or three brothers who were not much older.  One of  those brothers noticed, as most little brothers do sooner or  later, that there was a difference in his and her ways of  draining water.    For example, when he had to go, he would merely stand behind a  tree or go around behind the smokehouse, let it flow and watch it  fall.  Or he might play fireman up the side of the smokehouse  wall.  Or maybe aim at a beetle or a red ant and watch him  struggle to survive.    On the other hand, his little sister would squat and her dress  would hide the entire operation.  But the day he became curious  about her method of operation and got nosy enough to peep to see  what was taking place, he committed the unpardonable sin.  And it  would have caused extreme pain in the region of the lower hind  part of that small boy if his mother had learned of what he had  done.  What she would have done to him would have been a big  price for a little boy to have to pay for a little knowledge that  most little boys get for free these days.  But he didn't get  caught.  That was the beginning of a lot of secret things that  little boy did throughout his childhood--secrets he didn't share  with anyone.    We four boys went out together most of the time, both to work and  to play.  But at the Exum place, Ollie Mae was getting big enough  to want to go with us when we went to play.  Her presence created  a little problem we boys hadn't had before, especially when there  wasn't a good hiding place.    I remember one day out in the pasture where there were no trees  or bushes to hide behind, one of the smaller boys had to drain  his water and he solved his problem in his own way.  He simply  said, \"Ollie Mae, look the other way.\"  She did, then he turned  his back and minded his little business.    In the fall of the year, we often missed some schooling because  of so much cotton to be picked.  However, we didn't lose as much  time from school as some of the families around us.  Many a time  we would eat an early breakfast, go to the cotton patch and pick  for an hour or two and then go directly from there to school.  In  the afternoons we would go directly from school to the cotton  patch, pick cotton until dark and then go home for supper.    In my boyhood days, eating breakfast or supper in daylight was a  luxury many of us couldn't afford.  Cotton picking often went on  until spring and sometimes we'd have to lose a few days of  schooling in the spring in order to get the last of the cotton  out of the field in time for planting.    But our work was not always hard field work.  Sometimes there was  more pleasant work to be done, like going with Papa in the wagon  to haul a load of wood, or maybe to haul a hog over to a  neighbor's.    That kind of work was more or less dangerous when too many small  boys went along.  So some of us smaller ones would have to stay  home with Mama.    Papa always kept a box of sugar stick candy locked in the bottom  of his trunk for the purpose of bribing us smaller ones on those  occasions.  I really shouldn't call it bribery; rather, it was a  consolation offered to us younger ones who had to stay home.    When Papa would go somewhere alone in the wagon, it didn't hurt  us so much.  Mama would explain that he was going on a mission  where little boys were not supposed to go, and we would accept it  gracefully, since we all had to stay home.  But if one or two of  the boys rode away with him, that was hard for us smaller ones to  bear.    But we couldn't throw a fit, because fits were not allowed in our  family.  We just had to suffer the heartbreak in silence and a  fair amount of dignity.  And as they would drive away, it seems I  can still hear Mama saying to us, \"Come on, children, let's go  get a stick of candy.\"  And of course, that would help our  feelings somewhat, bless our little hearts."]]]
