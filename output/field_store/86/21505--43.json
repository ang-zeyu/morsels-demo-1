They were more common in collections made in larger  rivers (Walnut, Verdigris, and Neosho). In impoundments of this region  shad often become extremely abundant. Schoonover (1954:173) found that  shad comprised 97 per cent by number and 83 per cent by weight of fishes  taken in a survey of Fall River Reservoir.      #Carpiodes carpio carpio# (Rafinesque): Stations A-1, A-2, A-3, W-3,  G-1, C-3.    Hubbs and Lagler (1947:50) stated that the river carpsucker was \"Mostly  confined to large silty rivers.\" Of the stations listed above C-3 least  fits this description being a large shallow pool about 1/3 acre in area  having bedrock bottom and slightly turbid water. The other stations  conform to conditions described by Hubbs and Lagler (_loc. cit._).      #Carpiodes velifer# (Rafinesque): SBS. Three specimens of the highfin  carpsucker (K. U. 177-179) were collected on July 11, 1912, from an  unspecified location on Elk River in Elk County.      #Ictiobus bubalus# (Rafinesque): Stations W-3, G-1, G-2, C-1, C-3, C-4,  C-6, E-1, E-2, E-3.    The smallmouth buffalo shared the downstream proclivities of the river  carpsucker. In half of the collections (G-2, C-1, E-1, E-2, E-3) only  large juveniles were taken; in the other half only young-of-the-year  were found. In one pool at station C-1 hundreds of young buffalo and gar  were observed. This large shallow pool was 100 x 150 feet, with an  average depth of 8 inches. The bottom consisted of bedrock. Station C-6  was a small pool with bedrock bottom, eight feet in diameter, with an  average depth of only 4 inches. Station E-3 was also a small isolated  pool with bedrock bottom and an average depth of 6 inches.      #Ictiobus niger# (Rafinesque): Station C-5.    Only two specimens of the black buffalo were taken. An adult was caught  on spinning tackle, with doughballs for bait. The second specimen was a  juvenile taken by seining one mile below Station C-5 on September 22.      #Ictiobus cyprinella# (Valenciennes): Station G-2.    Two juvenal bigmouth buffalo were taken in a shallow pool, along with  several juvenal smallmouth buffalo.      #Moxostoma aureolum pisolabrum# Trautman and #Moxostoma carinatum#  (Cope): SBS.    Two specimens of _Moxostoma aureolum pisolabrum_ (K. U. 242-243) and one  specimen of _Moxostoma carinatum_ (K. U. 223) were taken from an  unspecified locality on Elk River in Elk County on July 11, 1912. There  are no other records for any of these fish in the collection area. _M.  aureolum pisolabrum_ has been taken in recent years in eastern Kansas  (Trautman, 1951:3) and has been found as far west as the Chikaskia  drainage in northern Oklahoma by Moore and Buck (1953:21). That  occasional northern redhorse enter the larger rivers of the area here  reported on seems probable.    _M. carinatum_ has been reported only a few times from Kansas. The only  recent records are from the Verdigris River (Schelske, 1957:39). Elkins  (1954:28) took four specimens of _M. carinatum_ from cutoff pools on  Salt Creek in Osage County, Oklahoma, in 1954. This recent record  suggests that occurrences in southern Kansas are probable.      #Moxostoma erythrurum# (Rafinesque): Stations G-5, G-7, G-10, G-12, C-4,  C-5, C-6, C-8, C-10, C-11, C-12, C-13, C-15, E-1, E-2, E-4 (C-131,  C-133, C-136).    The golden redhorse was common in several of the streams surveyed, and  utilized the upland parts of streams more extensively than any of the  other catostomids occurring in the area. _M. erythrurum_ and _Ictiobus  bubalus_ were taken together at only two stations. In no case was _I.  bubalus_ taken from a tributary of Grouse Creek or of Big Caney River.  In contrast _M. erythrurum_ reached its greatest concentrations in such  habitat, although it was always a minor component of the total fish  population. Stations C-5 and E-2 were the lowermost environments in  which this redhorse was taken.    The largest relative number of golden redhorse was found at station G-12  on Crab Creek where 7.5 per cent of the fishes taken were of this  species. This station consisted of intermittent pools averaging one foot  in depth. Bottoms were bedrock and rubble and the water was clear and  shaded. The fish were consistently taken in the deeper, open part of  the pool where aquatic vegetation, which covered most of the pool, was  absent.    Another station at which _M. erythrurum_ was abundant was C-12 on Cedar  Creek. Here a long, narrow, clear pool was the habitat, with average  depth of 17 inches, and bottom of bedrock.      #Minytrema melanops# (Rafinesque): Stations G-10, C-4, C-12, E-1.    Occurrences of the spotted sucker were scattered. At stations C-4 and  G-10 single specimens were taken. At station E-1 (July 9) one specimen  was taken at the mouth of a small tributary where water was turbid and  quiet. This specimen (K. U. 3708) was the largest (9-3/8 inches total  length) found, and possessed pits of lost tubercles.      #Cyprinus carpio# Linnaeus: Stations A-1, W-1, W-2, W-3, W-4, G-3, G-4,  G-6, G-8, C-3, C-5, E-4.    Carp were taken most often in downstream habitat. No carp were taken  above station C-5 on Big Caney River.    The earliest date on which young were taken was July 7, when 46  specimens, approximately 1/2 inch in total length, were taken from the  Walnut River at station W-1. The small carp showed a preference for  small shallow pools; adults were found in deeper pools.      #Hybopsis aestivalis tetranemus# (Gilbert): Station A-3.    Only one specimen of the speckled chub was taken. The species has been  recorded from nearby localities in the Arkansas River and its  tributaries both in Kansas and Oklahoma. Its habitat seems to be shallow  water over clean, fine sand, and it occurs in strong current in  mid-channel in the Arkansas River. Suitable habitat does not occur in  other parts of the area covered by this report.      #Notropis blennius# (Girard): Stations A-1, A-2, A-3.    The river shiner was taken only in the Arkansas River and in small  numbers. In all instances _N. blennius_ was found over sandy bottom in  flowing water. Females were gravid at station A-1 on June 14. To my  knowledge there are no published records of this shiner from the  Arkansas River Basin in Kansas. In Oklahoma this species prefers the  large, sandy streams such as the Arkansas River. Cross and Moore  (1952:403) found it in the Poteau River only near the mouth.      #Notropis boops# Gilbert: Stations G-5, G-7, C-3, C-5, C-8, C-9, C-10,  C-11, C-12, C-15, C-16, E-4, E-5, M-1, M-2.    Widespread occurrence of the bigeye shiner in this area seems  surprising. Except for this area it is known in Kansas only from the  Spring River drainage in the southeastern corner of the state (Cross,  1954b:474). _N. boops_ chose habitats that seemed most nearly like  Ozarkian terrain. The largest relative number of bigeye shiners was  taken at C-11 in a clear stream described in the discussion of _Notropis  rubellus_. At this station _N. boops_ comprised 14.11 per cent, and _N.  boops_ and _N. rubellus_ together comprised 24.78 per cent of all fish  taken.    At station G-7 on Grouse Creek the percentage of _N. boops_ was 7.15.  Here, as at station C-11, water was clear. At both stations  _Myriophyllum heterophyllum_ was abundant and at G-7 _Nelumbo lutea_ was  also common. At G-7 _N. boops_ seemed most abundant in the deeper water,  but at C-11 most shiners were found in the shallower part of a large  pool.    Two other collections in which _N. boops_ were common were from Spring  Creek. It is a small, clear Flint Hills brook running swiftly over clean  gravel and rubble. It had, however, been intermittent or completely dry  in its upper portion throughout the winter of 1955-'56 and until June  22, 1956. In collections at C-15 on June 28, _N. boops_ formed 6.5 per  cent of the fish taken. Farther upstream, at C-16 on July 9, in an area  one mile from the nearest pool of water that existed prior to the rains  of June 22, _N. boops_ made up 7.2 per cent of the fish taken.    In streams heading in the hilly area of western Elk County, the relative  abundance of _Notropis boops_ decreased progressively downstream. On  upper Elk River percentages were lower than on upper Grouse Creek and  upper Big Caney River.    Hubbs and Lagler (1947:66) characterize the habitat of this species as  clear creeks of limestone uplands. There are numerous records of the  bigeye shiner from extreme eastern Oklahoma. It has been reported as far  west as Beaver Creek in Osage County, Oklahoma. Beaver Creek originates  in Cowley County, Kansas, near the origin of Cedar Creek and Crab Creek.  Drought had left a few pools of water in Beaver Creek in Kansas at the  time of my survey. The fish-fauna seemed sparse and _N. boops_ was not  among the species taken. Of interest in considering the somewhat  isolated occurrence of the bigeye shiner in the Flint Hills area of  Kansas is a record of it by Ortenburger and Hubbs (1926:126) from  Panther Creek, Comanche County, Oklahoma, in the Wichita Mountain area  of that state.      #Notropis buchanani# Meek: Stations G-1, E-4 (C-131).    At station G-1 the ghost shiner was taken in small numbers in the  shallow end of a long pool (150 x 40 feet.) The three individuals taken  at station E-4 were in an isolated pool (50 x 510 feet) averaging 1-1/2  feet in depth. Water was turbid, and warm due to lack of shade.    The habitat preferences of this species and of the related species _N.  volucellus_ have been described as follows by Hubbs and Ortenburger  (1929b:68): \"It seems probable that _volucellus_ when occurring in the  range of _buchanani_ occupies upland streams, whereas _buchanani_ is  chiefly a form of the large rivers and adjacent creek mouths.\" The  results of this survey and impressions gained from other collections,  some of which are unpublished, are in agreement with this view. A  collection on "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3457"],[0,"The Man of the Forest (#6)"],[1,"gang. You've got fast hosses, eyes  for trackin', an' you can handle a rifle. You're the kind of fellows I'd  want in a tight pinch with a bad gang. Will you stand by me or see me go  alone?\"    Then John Beeman, silently, and with pale face, gave Dale's hand a  powerful grip, and one by one the other brothers rose to do likewise.  Their eyes flashed with hard glint and a strange bitterness hovered  around their thin lips.    \"Milt, mebbe we know what Beasley is better 'n you,\" said John, at  length. \"He ruined my father. He's cheated other Mormons. We boys have  proved to ourselves thet he gets the sheep Anson's gang steals.... An'  drives the herds to Phenix! Our people won't let us accuse Beasley. So  we've suffered in silence. My father always said, let some one else say  the first word against Beasley, an' you've come to us!\"    Roy Beeman put a hand on Dale's shoulder. He, perhaps, was the keenest  of the brothers and the one to whom adventure and peril called most.  He had been oftenest with Dale, on many a long trail, and he was the  hardest rider and the most relentless tracker in all that range country.    \"An' we're goin' with you,\" he said, in a strong and rolling voice.    They resumed their seats before the fire. John threw on more wood, and  with a crackling and sparkling the blaze curled up, fanned by the wind.  As twilight deepened into night the moan in the pines increased to a  roar. A pack of coyotes commenced to pierce the air in staccato cries.    The five young men conversed long and earnestly, considering, planning,  rejecting ideas advanced by each. Dale and Roy Beeman suggested most of  what became acceptable to all. Hunters of their type resembled explorers  in slow and deliberate attention to details. What they had to deal with  here was a situation of unlimited possibilities; the horses and outfit  needed; a long detour to reach Magdalena unobserved; the rescue of a  strange girl who would no doubt be self-willed and determined to ride  on the stage--the rescue forcible, if necessary; the fight and the  inevitable pursuit; the flight into the forest, and the safe delivery of  the girl to Auchincloss.    \"Then, Milt, will we go after Beasley?\" queried Roy Beeman,  significantly.    Dale was silent and thoughtful.    \"Sufficient unto the day!\" said John. \"An' fellars, let's go to bed.\"    They rolled out their tarpaulins, Dale sharing Roy's blankets, and soon  were asleep, while the red embers slowly faded, and the great roar of  wind died down, and the forest stillness set in.        CHAPTER IV    Helen Rayner had been on the westbound overland train fully twenty-four  hours before she made an alarming discovery.    Accompanied by her sister Bo, a precocious girl of sixteen, Helen had  left St. Joseph with a heart saddened by farewells to loved ones at  home, yet full of thrilling and vivid anticipations of the strange life  in the Far West. All her people had the pioneer spirit; love of change,  action, adventure, was in her blood. Then duty to a widowed mother  with a large and growing family had called to Helen to accept this rich  uncle's offer. She had taught school and also her little brothers and  sisters; she had helped along in other ways. And now, though the  tearing up of the roots of old loved ties was hard, this opportunity was  irresistible in its call. The prayer of her dreams had been answered. To  bring good fortune to her family; to take care of this beautiful, wild  little sister; to leave the yellow, sordid, humdrum towns for the great,  rolling, boundless open; to live on a wonderful ranch that was some day  to be her own; to have fulfilled a deep, instinctive, and undeveloped  love of horses, cattle, sheep, of desert and mountain, of trees and  brooks and wild flowers--all this was the sum of her most passionate  longings, now in some marvelous, fairylike way to come true.    A check to her happy anticipations, a blank, sickening dash of cold  water upon her warm and intimate dreams, had been the discovery  that Harve Riggs was on the train. His presence could mean only one  thing--that he had followed her. Riggs had been the worst of many  sore trials back there in St. Joseph. He had possessed some claim or  influence upon her mother, who favored his offer of marriage to Helen;  he was neither attractive, nor good, nor industrious, nor anything that  interested her; he was the boastful, strutting adventurer, not genuinely  Western, and he affected long hair and guns and notoriety. Helen had  suspected the veracity of the many fights he claimed had been his,  and also she suspected that he was not really big enough to be bad--as  Western men were bad. But on the train, in the station at La Junta, one  glimpse of him, manifestly spying upon her while trying to keep out of  her sight, warned Helen that she now might have a problem on her hands.    The recognition sobered her. All was not to be a road of roses to this  new home in the West. Riggs would follow her, if he could not accompany  her, and to gain his own ends he would stoop to anything. Helen felt the  startling realization of being cast upon her own resources, and then  a numbing discouragement and loneliness and helplessness. But these  feelings did not long persist in the quick pride and flash of her  temper. Opportunity knocked at her door and she meant to be at home to  it. She would not have been Al Auchincloss's niece if she had faltered.  And, when temper was succeeded by genuine anger, she could have laughed  to scorn this Harve Riggs and his schemes, whatever they were. Once  and for all she dismissed fear of him. When she left St. Joseph she had  faced the West with a beating heart and a high resolve to be worthy of  that West. Homes had to be made out there in that far country, so Uncle  Al had written, and women were needed to make homes. She meant to be one  of these women and to make of her sister another. And with the thought  that she would know definitely what to say to Riggs when he approached  her, sooner or later, Helen dismissed him from mind.    While the train was in motion, enabling Helen to watch the ever-changing  scenery, and resting her from the strenuous task of keeping Bo well in  hand at stations, she lapsed again into dreamy gaze at the pine forests  and the red, rocky gullies and the dim, bold mountains. She saw the sun  set over distant ranges of New Mexico--a golden blaze of glory, as new  to her as the strange fancies born in her, thrilling and fleeting by.  Bo's raptures were not silent, and the instant the sun sank and the  color faded she just as rapturously importuned Helen to get out the huge  basket of food they had brought from home.    They had two seats, facing each other, at the end of the coach, and  piled there, with the basket on top, was luggage that constituted all  the girls owned in the world. Indeed, it was very much more than they  had ever owned before, because their mother, in her care for them and  desire to have them look well in the eyes of this rich uncle, had spent  money and pains to give them pretty and serviceable clothes.    The girls sat together, with the heavy basket on their knees, and ate  while they gazed out at the cool, dark ridges. The train clattered  slowly on, apparently over a road that was all curves. And it was  supper-time for everybody in that crowded coach. If Helen had not been  so absorbed by the great, wild mountain-land she would have had more  interest in the passengers. As it was she saw them, and was amused  and thoughtful at the men and women and a few children in the car, all  middle-class people, poor and hopeful, traveling out there to the New  West to find homes. It was splendid and beautiful, this fact, yet it  inspired a brief and inexplicable sadness. From the train window, that  world of forest and crag, with its long bare reaches between, seemed so  lonely, so wild, so unlivable. How endless the distance! For hours and  miles upon miles no house, no hut, no Indian tepee! It was amazing, the  length and breadth of this beautiful land. And Helen, who loved brooks  and running streams, saw no water at all.    Then darkness settled down over the slow-moving panorama; a cool night  wind blew in at the window; white stars began to blink out of the blue.  The sisters, with hands clasped and heads nestled together, went to  sleep under a heavy cloak.      Early the next morning, while the girls were again delving into their  apparently bottomless basket, the train stopped at Las Vegas.    \"Look! Look!\" cried Bo, in thrilling voice. \"Cowboys! Oh, Nell, look!\"    Helen, laughing, looked first at her sister, and thought how most of all  she was good to look at. Bo was little, instinct with pulsating life,  and she had chestnut hair and dark-blue eyes. These eyes were flashing,  roguish, and they drew like magnets.    Outside on the rude station platform were railroad men, Mexicans, and  a group of lounging cowboys. Long, lean, bow-legged fellows they were,  with young, frank faces and intent eyes. One of them seemed particularly  attractive with his superb build, his red-bronze face and bright-red  scarf, his swinging gun, and the huge, long, curved spurs. Evidently  he caught Bo's admiring gaze, for, with a word to his companions, he  sauntered toward the window where the girls sat. His gait was singular,  almost awkward, as if he was not accustomed to walking. The long spurs  jingled musically. He removed his sombrero and stood at ease, frank,  cool, smiling. Helen liked him on sight, and, looking to see what effect  he had upon Bo, she found that young lady staring, frightened stiff.    \"Good mawnin',\" drawled the cowboy, with slow, good-humored smile. \"Now  where might you-all be travelin'?\"    The sound of his voice, the clean-cut and droll geniality; seemed new  and delightful to Helen.    \"We go to Magdalena--then take stage for the White Mountains,\" replied  Helen.    The cowboy's still, intent eyes"]]]
