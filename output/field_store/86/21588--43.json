The hero vanquishes her, overcomes her incantations, and annihilates  her. The Vedic hymn sings--\"A manly and heroic undertaking thou hast  accomplished, O Indras, for an evil-doing woman, the daughter of the  heavens, thou hast smitten; the growing daughter of the heaven, the  aurora, O Indras, thou hast destroyed; from the chariot, broken in  pieces, fell the aurora, trembling, because the bull had struck  her.\"[102] Here the mythical animal reappears on the same stage with  the heroes, and for the image of the hero and the heroine there is  substituted that of the cow and the bull.[103]    The sun and the aurora, therefore, do not always seek each other from  promptings of affection only, nor is the hateful part always played by  the aurora. The sun, also appears as a perverse persecutor in his  turn. One Vedic hymn advises the aurora not to stretch out the web  she works at too far, lest the sun, like a robber, with hostile  intention, set fire to and burn her.[104] Another hymn tells us that  the handsome one follows the beautiful one, the brother the sister,  like a lover,[105]--the aurora fleeing from the sun, her brother, out  of shame, and her brother following her, actuated by a brutal  instinct. Finally, a third hymn shows us the Vedic Vulcan, the  blacksmith of the gods, the sun Tvashtar, called also the omniform sun  (_Savita Vicvarupah_), as father of Saranyu, another name for the  aurora, omniform herself, like her father (and, like the cow,  undergoing the triple transmutation at the hands of Tvashtar, _i.e._,  the three brothers, the Ribhavas), creating another form of himself,  that is, the sun _Vivasvant_, to be able to espouse the aurora.  Saranyu, perceiving perhaps that Vivasvant is her father under another  shape, creates another woman like herself, and flees away on the  chariot that flies of itself, and that was before given her by her  father; and thereupon Vivasvant, in order to overtake her, transforms  himself into a horse.[106]    But sometimes the alienation the sun and the aurora, the young husband  and wife, is not due to evil propensities in themselves, but the  decree of fate working through the machinations of monsters. The two  beautiful ones are at bottom united by love and reciprocal gratitude;  for now it is the sun who delivers the aurora, and now the aurora who  liberates the sun; and we have already seen the aurora making the  ambrosial milk drop for the sun from her cows, and the sun drawing up  and delivering the cows of the aurora. There is a hymn in which the  divine girl, the aurora, comes up in the east, with a lascivious air,  smiling, fresh, uncovering her bosom, resplendent, towards the god who  sacrifices himself,[107] that is to say, towards the sun, towards  _Cunahcepas_ (the sun), who, in three verses of another hymn,[108]  invokes her, the well-known legend of which, narrated in the  _Aitareya-Brahmanam_, I shall briefly relate. The aurora has also the  merit of having, with her pure and purifying light, opened the gates  of the gloomy cavern, discomfited the enemies, the shades of night,  and exposed to view the treasures hidden by the darkness (and here we  have Medea again, but this time in a benignant form); she awakens to  activity the sleepers and everything with life (and therefore, among  the living sleepers, the sun, her son, whom one of the hymns  represents as sleeping profoundly in the bosom of the darkness of  night); she is the saviour of mortals,[109] that is to say, she  protects mortals from death, and resuscitates them; she sees and  foresees everything.[110] The awakener is also the awakened; the  illuminator is also the illumined, or the wise; and the illumined or  luminous one is also the beautiful one. From being small, she is  become large[111] (the heroes and heroines of mythology are only small  at birth, and pass at once into fulness of stature); from being infirm  and sombre-visaged, by the grace of Indras and of the Acvinau, she is  cured and restored to strength and clearness.[112] But why was she  dark at first? Because her mother, the night, is the black one; she,  the white one, is born of the black one.[113]    During the night, the young girl was blind, and she recovers her sight  by the grace of a wise one, one who, protected by Indras, another  shape of Indras, has become enamoured of her. We have seen above that  it is the Acvinau who, with the aurora, give back to the sun his  sight; here it is the sun who makes the aurora see, it is the sun who  gives her light; and she who, having been blind, recovers her sight,  becomes the protectress of the blind and preserver of vision,[114]  like St Lucia, virgin and martyr, in the Christian Mythology. Physical  truth and the mythical narration are in perfect accordance.    The night is now the mother, now the sister of the aurora; but the  gloomy night is sometimes her step-mother, sometimes her half-sister.  There is a riddle which celebrates the luminous night and the aurora,  as two diversely beautiful ones who go together, but of whom one goes  while the other comes.[115] Another hymn sings of them thus: \"The  brilliantly-decked one approaches, the white aurora comes; the black  one prepares for her her rooms. The one immortal having joined the  other, the two appear alternately in the heavens. One and eternal is  the path of the two sisters; they follow it, one after the other,  guided by the gods; they do not meet, and they never stand still--the  two good nurses, night and aurora, one in soul yet different in  form.\"[116] The two good nurses, night and aurora, whose hues  alternate eternally, nourish between them one and the same child (the  sun).[117] But the _Rigvedas_ itself tells us that the night is not  always the legitimate sister of the aurora; the latter \"abandons now  the one that is, now the one that is not, properly its sister.\"[118]  Here probably we must understand by the proper sister of the aurora  the luminous or moonlight night, and by the half-sister, the gloomy  night, the night without a moon. This is the sister whom, in a hymn,  the aurora removes, sends far away from her, while she shines to be  seen of her husband;[119] and her half-sister, the night, is obliged  to resign her place to her elder or better sister,[120] the word  _gyeshthas_ meaning not only the eldest, but the best. We have  already seen that the aurora is the first to appear; as such, and as  she who in the evening precedes the night (the evening aurora), she is  the first-born, the eldest, the most experienced, the best; while,  from another point of view, she is represented to us as the little one  who becomes great, and, in this case, as younger sister of the night  (the morning dawn). The dawns, or auroras, are saluted with the  epithet of workwomen,[121] just as the good sister, with respect to  the bad one, is always she who works, doing wonderful work, that is,  spinning or weaving the rosy cloth. But the auroras are not only the  workers, they are also the pure purifying and cleansing ones;[122]  hence one can understand how one of the tasks imposed upon the  youngest sister was that of purifying, purging, or separating the  grain during the night, taking from it all that is impure, in which  task she is assisted sometimes by a good fairy, sometimes by the  Virgin Mary, who, according to all probability, is the moon.    One of the singular qualities of the younger sister is that she  displays her beauty only before the eyes of her husband. The wife  aurora manifests herself in the sight of her husband;[123] united, in  her splendour, with the rays of the sun,[124] like a wife she prepares  the dwelling of the sun.[125] Very brilliant, like a wife cleansed by  her mother, she uncovers her body;[126] like a bather who shows  herself, the shining one unveils her body;[127] she adorns herself  like a dancer, uncovering, like a cow, her breast;[128] she displays  her luminous garments;[129] all-radiant, with beautiful face, she  laughs;[130] and he who has made the aurora laugh, her, the beautiful  princess, who, at first, that is, during the night, did not laugh,  espouses her; the sun espouses the aurora.    The celestial nuptials take place, and the ceremony is minutely  described in the 85th hymn of the 10th book of the _Rigvedas_. But the  marriage of the two celestials is never consummated except under  conditions; these conditions are always accepted and afterwards  forgotten, and it is now the husband who, by forsaking his wife, now  the wife who, by abandoning her husband, violates the promise given.  One of these estrangements, these temporary alienations of husband and  wife, is described in the _Rigvedas_ by the poetical myth of the dawn  _Urvaci_ and her husband _Pururavas_, one of the names given to the  sun. Urvaci says of herself, \"I have arrived like the first of the  auroras;\"[131] thereupon Urvaci suddenly abandons her husband  Pururavas, because he breaks an agreement made between them. We shall  see further on in this chapter what this agreement was. Besides,  having given him a son before her departure, she consoles him by  permitting him to come and find her again in heaven, that is, by  endowing the sun with the immortality she possesses herself. In the  morning the aurora precedes the sun; he follows her too closely, and  she disappears, but leaves a son, _i.e._, the new sun. In the evening  the aurora precedes the sun; he follows her again, and she loses  herself, now in a forest, now in the sea. The same phenomenon, a  divorce of husband from wife, or a separation of brother and sister,  or the flight of a sister from her brother, or again, that of a  daughter from her father, presents itself twice every day (and every  year) in the sky. Sometimes, on the other hand, it is a witch, or the  monster of nocturnal darkness, who takes the place of the radiant  bride, or the aurora,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38750"],[0,"Current History: A Monthly Magazine of the New York Times, May 1918 (#6)"],[1,"not been so much a  matter of formation as of delivering streams of troops at the chosen  point of contact to overwhelm their opponents with superior numbers at  that point. These German tactics were again used in the attacks, begun  on March 21, against the British front from southeast of Arras as far as  La Fere.      FIFTH ARMY'S DISASTER    Here were in position the 3d British Army (General Byng) in the section  toward Arras, and, on the right to the south, the 5th British Army  (General Gough) in the region west of St. Quentin. On March 21 there was  a tremendous bombardment followed by infantry attacks all along the  line, which resulted in winning many first-line positions. This was  nothing more than had been expected, and provision had been made against  it; but, unfortunately, as at Cambrai, the Germans had been enabled to  make an unexpected concentration of superior numbers against positions  of the 5th British Army.[1] The assault of this overwhelming force broke  through the British lines, even to the extent of involving engineers and  laborers behind the lines, as at Cambrai, with the same disastrous  results. This breakdown of the defense forced a retreat from the British  positions far different from the retirement that had been planned--and  it brought about the withdrawal of the whole 5th Army, resulting in what  the British Premier called \"crippling one of our great armies.\"    After such a disaster, it was found necessary to abandon a great amount  of terrain to maintain a junction between the two British armies.  Peronne and Bapaume were soon captured by the Germans, and on March 27  the Germans reported the occupation of Albert. On the same day Roye and  Noyon were taken. On the next day the Germans had pushed as far west as  Pierrepont and taken possession of Montdidier. As was to be expected in  such a retreat, there soon was a large toll of British guns and  prisoners. On March 29 the Germans claimed 1,100 guns and 70,000  prisoners. They had also captured great quantities of material and 100  tanks.    These were heavy losses, but such losses were not the really serious  element in the situation. A study of the map will show that, as the 5th  Army retreated toward the west, there was left an increasingly long  sector south of Noyon and curving north, west of Montdidier to the Avre  River--and it was necessary that this dangerous opening should be  protected by the French reserves. With extraordinary rapidity and  efficiency French troops were rushed to this region, and the almost  impossible task was accomplished of repairing the defense. But the drain  on the French reserves had been heavy, and the necessity to use them for  this purpose had neutralized a force that had been prepared for a  different object against such a German drive.    That these reserves were being held as a mobile army was so generally  known that, it will be remembered, there was daily expectation of a  counterattack by this force. There is no need to point out how great  might have been the results of an assault upon an enemy exhausted by  days of fighting; but any such plan was rendered impossible at the time  by the need to use these troops to defend the new line, which was nearly  as long as the original battle line at the time of the attacks on March  21.      FOCH MADE GENERALISSIMO    Yet, on the other hand, from this battle's costly object lesson in the  weakness of divided commands, came at last the appointment of the French  General, Foch, (March 28,) to absolute command over all the armies of  the Allies on the western front. For a long time a single command has  been the one great need to insure military efficiency, and obtaining  this is an offset against the losses in the battle which brought such a  command into being.    Throughout the war the great outstanding element of failure for the  Allies has been lack of co-ordination. The varying aims of the different  nations in the war have accounted for this to a great degree, but on the  battlefields of France there should have been no delay in giving the  command to the chosen General of the nation which had everything at  stake. All the influence of the United States had been exerted for a  long time in favor of a single command, and at once the unrestricted use  of the American force in France was offered to General Foch.    From what has been said of the course of the battle of Picardy, it can  readily be seen that the task of the new Commander in Chief was one of  the hardest ever given to a General on taking command of an army. After  a disaster that had greatly impaired the availability of the troops of  the Allies, General Foch was obliged to face the culminating effort of  the greatest military machine in all history with a force placed under  his command made up of armies that had never been in co-ordination--and  after the collapse of one of these armies.    Another serious element in the battle in Flanders is the fact that it  has been necessary to send to this front also French troops from General  Foch's reserves, making another drain upon these forces. The appointment  of General Foch to the chief command literally on the battlefield was  formally confirmed by the British and French Governments in the  following notice which appeared in Le Temps April 14:        The British Government and the French Government have agreed to      give General Foch the title of Commander in Chief of the allied      armies operating in France.    The United States, after having greatly helped to bring about General  Foch's command, has given a large part of the American force in France  to be brigaded with the allied troops wherever there are weak spots.  These factors in the military situation may make it possible for General  Foch again to assemble a mobile army for a counterstroke against the  German offensive.      PHASES OF THE BATTLE    The first days of April saw the end of the initial phase of the great  drive. There were other gains that brought the Germans uncomfortably  near Amiens, but the character of the fighting was similar to that of  the last three years on the western front. The new line of battle  extended southwest from Arras, beyond Albert, to the west of Moreuil,  about nine miles south of Amiens. It lay to the west of Pierrepont and  Montdidier, curving to the south of Noyon and to the region of the Oise.  The greatest penetration into the terrain of the Allies had been about  thirty-five miles. The Berlin War Office announced the capture of 90,000  prisoners and 1,300 guns in this first phase of the German offensive.    Through the first week of April there was sharp fighting at different  points in the line, north of Albert, east of Amiens, and on the River  Oise. In this last region the French, in rectifying their new defense,  lost 2,000 prisoners, but there was nothing accomplished in any combat  that meant a tactical change in the general situation. Suddenly, on  April 8, there were heavy bombardments in the region of La Bassee and  Armentieres, which were followed by strong attacks on this front; and on  April 9 General Haig reported: \"Favored by a thick mist which made  observation impossible, the enemy succeeded in forcing his way into the  Allies' positions in the neighborhood of Neuve Chapelle.\" These attacks  developed into a second stage of the great German offensive, and, as  before, the shock of the initial surprise attack seriously impaired the  British positions. Portuguese troops were reported as fighting with the  British troops on this sector. On April 10 General Haig reported that  the Germans had also forced back his line north of Armentieres. These  reverses resulted in the capture of Armentieres on April 11 by the  Germans, as the city was encircled from the north and south. The Germans  claimed the capture of the garrison of 3,000 and forty-five guns. The  battle had spread to a front of about twenty-five miles on April 12,  with the Germans penetrating to Merville, eleven miles southwest of  Armentieres. On this day the German official report claimed 20,000  prisoners and 200 guns.      A HISTORIC ORDER    General Haig issued the following proclamation to his troops on April  12:        Three weeks ago today the enemy began his terrific attacks      against us on a fifty-mile front. His objects are to separate us      from the French, to take the Channel ports, and to destroy the      British Army.        In spite of throwing already 106 divisions into the battle, and      enduring the most reckless sacrifice of human life, he has yet      made little progress toward his goals.        We owe this to the determined fighting and self-sacrifice of our      troops. Words fail me to express the admiration which I feel for      the splendid resistance offered by all ranks of our army under      the most trying circumstances.        Many among us now are tired. To those I would say that victory      will belong to the side which holds out the longest. The French      Army is moving rapidly and in great force to our support. There      is no other course open to us but to fight it out.        Every position must be held to the last man. There must be no      retirement. With our backs to the wall, and believing in the      justice of our cause, each one of us must fight to the end. The      safety of our homes and the freedom of mankind depend alike upon      the conduct of each one of us at this critical moment.    The situation on April 17 was summed up by General Maurice, Director of  War Operations in the British War Office, in these words:        The British Army is playing the role which it often has played      before. It is fighting a Waterloo while Bluecher is marching to      the battlefield.        The British Army is under a terrible hammering, but, providing      we stand that hammering without breaking down, and providing      Bluecher is marching to the battlefield, there is no reason for    "]]]
