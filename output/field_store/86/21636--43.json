[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4352"],[0,"Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic (#6)"],[1,"needed, by which the outer crust of carefully stratified judgments and  firmly established ideas will be lifted, and we shall behold in the  depths of our mind, like a sheet of subterranean water, the flow of an  unbroken stream of images which pass from one into another. This  interpenetration of images does not come about by chance. It obeys  laws, or rather habits, which hold the same relation to imagination  that logic does to thought.    Let us then follow this logic of the imagination in the special case in  hand. A man in disguise is comic. A man we regard as disguised is also  comic. So, by analogy, any disguise is seen to become comic, not only  that of a man, but that of society also, and even the disguise of  nature.    Let us start with nature. You laugh at a dog that is half-clipped, at a  bed of artificially coloured flowers, at a wood in which the trees are  plastered over with election addresses, etc. Look for the reason, and  you will see that you are once more thinking of a masquerade. Here,  however, the comic element is very faint; it is too far from its  source. If you wish to strengthen it, you must go back to the source  itself and contrast the derived image, that of a masquerade, with the  original one, which, be it remembered, was that of a mechanical  tampering with life. In \"a nature that is mechanically tampered with\"  we possess a thoroughly comic theme, on which fancy will be able to  play ever so many variations with the certainty of successfully  provoking the heartiest hilarity. You may call to mind that amusing  passage in Tartarin Sur Les Alpes, in which Bompard makes Tartarin--and  therefore also the reader to some slight extent--accept the idea of a  Switzerland choke-full of machinery like the basement of the opera, and  run by a company which maintains a series of waterfalls, glaciers and  artificial crevasses. The same theme reappears, though transposed in  quite another key, in the Novel Notes of the English humorist, Jerome  K. Jerome. An elderly Lady Bountiful, who does not want her deeds of  charity to take up too much of her time, provides homes within easy  hail of her mansion for the conversion of atheists who have been  specially manufactured for her, so to speak, and for a number of honest  folk who have been made into drunkards so that she may cure them of  their failing, etc. There are comic phrases in which this theme is  audible, like a distant echo, coupled with an ingenuousness, whether  sincere or affected, which acts as accompaniment. Take, as an instance,  the remark made by a lady whom Cassini, the astronomer, had invited to  see an eclipse of the moon. Arriving too late, she said, \"M. de  Cassini, I know, will have the goodness to begin it all over again, to  please me.\" Or, take again the exclamation of one of Gondiinet's  characters on arriving in a town and learning that there is an extinct  volcano in the neighbourhood, \"They had a volcano, and they have let it  go out!\"    Let us go on to society. As we are both in and of it, we cannot help  treating it as a living being. Any image, then, suggestive of the  notion of a society disguising itself, or of a social masquerade, so to  speak, will be laughable. Now, such a notion is formed when we perceive  anything inert or stereotyped, or simply ready-made, on the surface of  living society. There we have rigidity over again, clashing with the  inner suppleness of life. The ceremonial side of social life must,  therefore, always include a latent comic element, which is only waiting  for an opportunity to burst into full view. It might be said that  ceremonies are to the social body what clothing is to the individual  body: they owe their seriousness to the fact that they are identified,  in our minds, with the serious object with which custom associates  them, and when we isolate them in imagination, they forthwith lose  their seriousness. For any ceremony, then, to become comic, it is  enough that our attention be fixed on the ceremonial element in it, and  that we neglect its matter, as philosophers say, and think only of its  form. Every one knows how easily the comic spirit exercises its  ingenuity on social actions of a stereotyped nature, from an ordinary  prize-distribution to the solemn sitting of a court of justice. Any  form or formula is a ready-made frame into which the comic element may  be fitted.    Here, again, the comic will be emphasised by bringing it nearer to its  source. From the idea of travesty, a derived one, we must go back to  the original idea, that of a mechanism superposed upon life. Already,  the stiff and starched formality of any ceremonial suggests to us an  image of this kind. For, as soon as we forget the serious object of a  solemnity or a ceremony, those taking part in it give us the impression  of puppets in motion. Their mobility seems to adopt as a model the  immobility of a formula. It becomes automatism. But complete automatism  is only reached in the official, for instance, who performs his duty  like a mere machine, or again in the unconsciousness that marks an  administrative regulation working with inexorable fatality, and setting  itself up for a law of nature. Quite by chance, when reading the  newspaper, I came across a specimen of the comic of this type. Twenty  years ago, a large steamer was wrecked off the coast at Dieppe. With  considerable difficulty some of the passengers were rescued in a boat.  A few custom-house officers, who had courageously rushed to their  assistance, began by asking them \"if they had anything to declare.\" We  find something similar, though the idea is a more subtle one, in the  remark of an M.P. when questioning the Home Secretary on the morrow of  a terrible murder which took place in a railway carriage: \"The  assassin, after despatching his victim, must have got out the wrong  side of the train, thereby infringing the Company's rules.\"    A mechanical element introduced into nature and an automatic regulation  of society, such, then, are the two types of laughable effects at which  we have arrived. It remains for us, in conclusion, to combine them and  see what the result will be.    The result of the combination will evidently be a human regulation of  affairs usurping the place of the laws of nature. We may call to mind  the answer Sganarelle gave Geronte when the latter remarked that the  heart was on the left side and the liver on the right: \"Yes, it was so  formerly, but we have altered all that; now, we practise medicine in  quite a new way.\" We may also recall the consultation between M. de  Pourceaugnac's two doctors: \"The arguments you have used are so erudite  and elegant that it is impossible for the patient not to be  hypochondriacally melancholic; or, even if he were not, he must surely  become so because of the elegance of the things you have said and the  accuracy of your reasoning.\" We might multiply examples, for all we  need do would be to call up Moliere's doctors, one after the other.  However far, moreover, comic fancy may seem to go, reality at times  undertakes to improve upon it. It was suggested to a contemporary  philosopher, an out-and-out arguer, that his arguments, though  irreproachable in their deductions, had experience against them. He put  an end to the discussion by merely remarking, \"Experience is in the  wrong.\" The truth is, this idea of regulating life as a matter of  business routine is more widespread than might be imagined; it is  natural in its way, although we have just obtained it by an artificial  process of reconstruction. One might say that it gives us the very  quintessence of pedantry, which, at bottom, is nothing else than art  pretending to outdo nature.    To sum up, then, we have one and the same effect, which assumes ever  subtler forms as it passes from the idea of an artificial MECHANISATION  of the human body, if such an expression is permissible, to that of any  substitution whatsoever of the artificial for the natural. A less and  less rigorous logic, that more and more resembles the logic of  dreamland, transfers the same relationship into higher and higher  spheres, between increasingly immaterial terms, till in the end we find  a mere administrative enactment occupying the same relation to a  natural or moral law that a ready-made garment, for instance, does to  the living body. We have now gone right to the end of the first of the  three directions we had to follow. Let us turn to the second and see  where it will lead us.    2. Our starting-point is again \"something mechanical encrusted upon the  living.\" Where did the comic come from in this case? It came from the  fact that the living body became rigid, like a machine. Accordingly, it  seemed to us that the living body ought to be the perfection of  suppleness, the ever-alert activity of a principle always at work. But  this activity would really belong to the soul rather than to the body.  It would be the very flame of life, kindled within us by a higher  principle and perceived through the body, as if through a glass. When  we see only gracefulness and suppleness in the living body, it is  because we disregard in it the elements of weight, of resistance, and,  in a word, of matter; we forget its materiality and think only of its  vitality, a vitality which we regard as derived from the very principle  of intellectual and moral life, Let us suppose, however, that our  attention is drawn to this material side of the body; that, so far from  sharing in the lightness and subtlety of the principle with which it is  animated, the body is no more in our eyes than a heavy and cumbersome  vesture, a kind of irksome ballast which holds down to earth a soul  eager to rise aloft. Then the body will become to the soul what, as we  have just seen, the garment was to the body itself--inert matter dumped  down upon living energy. The impression of the comic will be produced  as soon as we have a clear"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4357"],[0,"American Fairy Tales (#6)"],[1," it was her afternoon  for polishing the silver, so she stayed in the pantry and left Jane  Gladys to amuse herself alone in the big sitting-room upstairs.    The little girl did not mind being alone, for she was working on her  first piece of embroidery--a sofa pillow for papa's birthday  present. So she crept into the big bay window and curled herself up  on the broad sill while she bent her brown head over her work.    Soon the door opened and closed again, quietly. Jane Gladys thought  it was Nora, so she didn't look up until she had taken a couple more  stitches on a forget-me-not. Then she raised her eyes and was  astonished to find a strange man in the middle of the room, who  regarded her earnestly.    He was short and fat, and seemed to be breathing heavily from his  climb up the stairs. He held a work silk hat in one hand and  underneath his other elbow was tucked a good-sized book. He was  dressed in a black suit that looked old and rather shabby, and his  head was bald upon the top.    \"Excuse me,\" he said, while the child gazed at him in solemn  surprise. \"Are you Jane Gladys Brown?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" she answered.    \"Very good; very good, indeed!\" he remarked, with a queer sort of  smile. \"I've had quite a hunt to find you, but I've succeeded at  last.\"    \"How did you get in?\" inquired Jane Gladys, with a growing distrust  of her visitor.    \"That is a secret,\" he said, mysteriously.    This was enough to put the girl on her guard. She looked at the man  and the man looked at her, and both looks were grave and somewhat  anxious.    \"What do you want?\" she asked, straightening herself up with a  dignified air.    \"Ah!--now we are coming to business,\" said the man, briskly. \"I'm  going to be quite frank with you. To begin with, your father has  abused me in a most ungentlemanly manner.\"    Jane Gladys got off the window sill and pointed her small finger at  the door.    \"Leave this room 'meejitly!\" she cried, her voice trembling with  indignation. \"My papa is the best man in the world. He never 'bused  anybody!\"    \"Allow me to explain, please,\" said the visitor, without paying any  attention to her request to go away. \"Your father may be very kind  to you, for you are his little girl, you know. But when he's  down-town in his office he's inclined to be rather severe,  especially on book agents. Now, I called on him the other day and  asked him to buy the 'Complete Works of Peter Smith,' and what do  you suppose he did?\"    She said nothing.    \"Why,\" continued the man, with growing excitement, \"he ordered me  from his office, and had me put out of the building by the janitor!  What do you think of such treatment as that from the 'best papa in  the world,' eh?\"    \"I think he was quite right,\" said Jane Gladys.    \"Oh, you do? Well,\" said the man, \"I resolved to be revenged for the  insult. So, as your father is big and strong and a dangerous man, I  have decided to be revenged upon his little girl.\"    Jane Gladys shivered.    \"What are you going to do?\" she asked.    \"I'm going to present you with this book,\" he answered, taking it  from under his arm. Then he sat down on the edge of a chair, placed  his hat on the rug and drew a fountain pen from his vest pocket.    \"I'll write your name in it,\" said he. \"How do you spell Gladys?\"    \"G-l-a-d-y-s,\" she replied.    \"Thank you. Now this,\" he continued, rising and handing her the book  with a bow, \"is my revenge for your father's treatment of me.  Perhaps he'll be sorry he didn't buy the 'Complete Works of Peter  Smith.' Good-by, my dear.\"    He walked to the door, gave her another bow, and left the room, and  Jane Gladys could see that he was laughing to himself as if very  much amused.    When the door had closed behind the queer little man the child sat  down in the window again and glanced at the book. It had a red and  yellow cover and the word \"Thingamajigs\" was across the front in big  letters.    Then she opened it, curiously, and saw her name written in black  letters upon the first white leaf.    \"He was a funny little man,\" she said to herself, thoughtfully.    She turned the next leaf, and saw a big picture of a clown, dressed  in green and red and yellow, and having a very white face with  three-cornered spots of red on each cheek and over the eyes. While  she looked at this the book trembled in her hands, the leaf crackled  and creaked and suddenly the clown jumped out of it and stood upon  the floor beside her, becoming instantly as big as any ordinary  clown.    After stretching his arms and legs and yawning in a rather impolite  manner, he gave a silly chuckle and said:    \"This is better! You don't know how cramped one gets, standing so  long upon a page of flat paper.\"    Perhaps you can imagine how startled Jane Gladys was, and how she  stared at the clown who had just leaped out of the book.    \"You didn't expect anything of this sort, did you?\" he asked,  leering at her in clown fashion. Then he turned around to take a  look at the room and Jane Gladys laughed in spite of her  astonishment.    \"What amuses you?\" demanded the clown.    \"Why, the back of you is all white!\" cried the girl. \"You're only a  clown in front of you.\"    \"Quite likely,\" he returned, in an annoyed tone. \"The artist made a  front view of me. He wasn't expected to make the back of me, for  that was against the page of the book.\"    \"But it makes you look so funny!\" said Jane Gladys, laughing until  her eyes were moist with tears.    The clown looked sulky and sat down upon a chair so she couldn't see  his back.    \"I'm not the only thing in the book,\" he remarked, crossly.    This reminded her to turn another page, and she had scarcely noted  that it contained the picture of a monkey when the animal sprang  from the book with a great crumpling of paper and landed upon the  window seat beside her.    \"He-he-he-he-he!\" chattered the creature, springing to the girl's  shoulder and then to the center table. \"This is great fun! Now I can  be a real monkey instead of a picture of one.\"    \"Real monkeys can't talk,\" said Jane Gladys, reprovingly.    \"How do you know? Have you ever been one yourself?\" inquired the  animal; and then he laughed loudly, and the clown laughed, too, as  if he enjoyed the remark.    The girl was quite bewildered by this time. She thoughtlessly turned  another leaf, and before she had time to look twice a gray donkey  leaped from the book and stumbled from the window seat to the floor  with a great clatter.    \"You're clumsy enough, I'm sure!\" said the child, indignantly, for  the beast had nearly upset her.    \"Clumsy! And why not?\" demanded the donkey, with angry voice. \"If  the fool artist had drawn you out of perspective, as he did me, I  guess you'd be clumsy yourself.\"    \"What's wrong with you?\" asked Jane Gladys.    \"My front and rear legs on the left side are nearly six inches too  short, that's what's the matter! If that artist didn't know how to  draw properly why did he try to make a donkey at all?\"    \"I don't know,\" replied the child, seeing an answer was expected.    \"I can hardly stand up,\" grumbled the donkey; \"and the least little  thing will topple me over.\"    \"Don't mind that,\" said the monkey, making a spring at the  chandelier and swinging from it by his tail until Jane Gladys feared  he would knock all the globes off; \"the same artist has made my ears  as big as that clown's and everyone knows a monkey hasn't any ears  to speak of--much less to draw.\"    \"He should be prosecuted,\" remarked the clown, gloomily. \"I haven't  any back.\"    Jane Gladys looked from one to the other with a puzzled expression  upon her sweet face, and turned another page of the book.    Swift as a flash there sprang over her shoulder a tawney, spotted  leopard, which landed upon the back of a big leather armchair and  turned upon the others with a fierce movement.    The monkey climbed to the top of the chandelier and chattered with  fright. The donkey tried to run and straightway tipped over on his  left side. The clown grew paler than ever, but he sat still in his  chair and gave a low whistle of surprise.    The leopard crouched upon the back of the chair, lashed his tail  from side to side and glared at all of them, by turns, including  Jane Gladys.    \"Which of us are you going to attack first?\" asked the donkey,  trying hard to get upon his feet again.    \"I can't attack any of you,\" snarled the leopard. \"The artist made  my mouth shut, so I haven't any teeth; and he forgot to make my  claws. But I'm a frightful looking creature, nevertheless; am I  not?\"    \"Oh, yes;\" said the clown, indifferently. \"I suppose you're  frightful looking enough. But if you have no teeth nor claws we  don't mind your looks at all.\"    This so annoyed the leopard that he growled horribly, and the monkey  laughed at him.    Just then the book slipped from the girl's lap, and as she made a  movement to catch it one of the pages near the back opened wide. She  caught a glimpse of a fierce grizzly bear looking at her from the  page, and quickly threw the book from her. It fell with a crash in  the middle of the room, but beside it stood the great grizzly, who  had wrenched himself from the page before the book closed.    \"Now,\" cried the leopard from his perch, \"you'd better look out for  yourselves! You can't laugh at him as you did at me. The bear has  both claws and teeth.\"    \"Indeed I have,\" said the bear, in a low, deep, growling voice. \"And  I know how to use them, too. If you read in that book you'll find  I'm described as a horrible, cruel and remorseless grizzly, whose  only business in life is to eat up little girls--shoes, dresses,  ribbons and all! And then, the author says, I smack my lips and  glory in my wickedness.\"    \"That's awful!\" said the donkey, sitting upon his haunches and  shaking his head sadly. \"What do you suppose possessed the author to  make you so hungry for girls? Do you eat animals, also?\"    \"The author does not mention"]]]
