HYL.  Let me think a little--I do not find that I can.    PHIL.  And can you think it possible that should really exist in nature  which implies a repugnancy in its conception?    HYL.  By no means.    PHIL.  Since therefore it is impossible even for the mind to disunite  the ideas of extension and motion from all other sensible qualities, doth  it not follow, that where the one exist there necessarily the other exist  likewise?    HYL.  It should seem so.    PHIL.  Consequently, the very same arguments which you admitted as  conclusive against the Secondary Qualities are, without any farther  application of force, against the Primary too. Besides, if you will trust  your senses, is it not plain all sensible qualities coexist, or to them  appear as being in the same place? Do they ever represent a motion, or  figure, as being divested of all other visible and tangible qualities?    HYL.  You need say no more on this head. I am free to own, if there be  no secret error or oversight in our proceedings hitherto, that all  sensible qualities are alike to be denied existence without the mind.  But, my fear is that I have been too liberal in my former concessions, or  overlooked some fallacy or other. In short, I did not take time to think.    PHIL.  For that matter, Hylas, you may take what time you please in  reviewing the progress of our inquiry. You are at liberty to recover any  slips you might have made, or offer whatever you have omitted which makes  for your first opinion.    HYL.  One great oversight I take to be this--that I did not sufficiently  distinguish the OBJECT from the SENSATION. Now, though this latter  may not exist without the mind, yet it will not thence follow that the  former cannot.    PHIL.  What object do you mean? the object of the senses?    HYL.  The same.    PHIL.  It is then immediately perceived?    HYL.  Right.    PHIL.  Make me to understand the difference between what is immediately  perceived and a sensation.    HYL.  The sensation I take to be an act of the mind perceiving; besides  which, there is something perceived; and this I call the OBJECT. For  example, there is red and yellow on that tulip. But then the act of  perceiving those colours is in me only, and not in the tulip.    PHIL.  What tulip do you speak of? Is it that which you see?    HYL.  The same.    PHIL.  And what do you see beside colour, figure, and extension?    HYL.  Nothing.    PHIL.  What you would say then is that the red and yellow are coexistent  with the extension; is it not?    HYL.  That is not all; I would say they have a real existence without  the mind, in some unthinking substance.    PHIL.  That the colours are really in the tulip which I see is manifest.  Neither can it be denied that this tulip may exist independent of your  mind or mine; but, that any immediate object of the senses,--that is, any  idea, or combination of ideas--should exist in an unthinking substance,  or exterior to ALL minds, is in itself an evident contradiction. Nor  can I imagine how this follows from what you said just now, to wit, that  the red and yellow were on the tulip you SAW, since you do not pretend  to SEE that unthinking substance.    HYL.  You have an artful way, Philonous, of diverting our inquiry from  the subject.    PHIL.  I see you have no mind to be pressed that way. To return then to  your distinction between SENSATION and OBJECT; if I take you right,  you distinguish in every perception two things, the one an action of the  mind, the other not.    HYL.  True.    PHIL.  And this action cannot exist in, or belong to, any unthinking  thing; but, whatever beside is implied in a perception may?    HYL.  That is my meaning.    PHIL.  So that if there was a perception without any act of the mind, it  were possible such a perception should exist in an unthinking substance?    HYL.  I grant it. But it is impossible there should be such a  perception.    PHIL.  When is the mind said to be active?    HYL.  When it produces, puts an end to, or changes, anything.    PHIL.  Can the mind produce, discontinue, or change anything, but by an  act of the will?    HYL.  It cannot.    PHIL.  The mind therefore is to be accounted ACTIVE in its perceptions  so far forth as VOLITION is included in them?    HYL.  It is.    PHIL.  In plucking this flower I am active; because I do it by the  motion of my hand, which was consequent upon my volition; so likewise in  applying it to my nose. But is either of these smelling?    HYL.  NO.    PHIL.  I act too in drawing the air through my nose; because my  breathing so rather than otherwise is the effect of my volition. But  neither can this be called SMELLING: for, if it were, I should smell  every time I breathed in that manner?    HYL.  True.    PHIL.  Smelling then is somewhat consequent to all this?    HYL.  It is.    PHIL.  But I do not find my will concerned any farther. Whatever more  there is--as that I perceive such a particular smell, or any smell at  all--this is independent of my will, and therein I am altogether passive.  Do you find it otherwise with you, Hylas?    HYL.  No, the very same.    PHIL.  Then, as to seeing, is it not in your power to open your eyes, or  keep them shut; to turn them this or that way?    HYL.  Without doubt.    PHIL.  But, doth it in like manner depend on YOUR will that in looking  on this flower you perceive WHITE rather than any other colour? Or,  directing your open eyes towards yonder part of the heaven, can you avoid  seeing the sun? Or is light or darkness the effect of your volition?    HYL.  No, certainly.    PHIL.  You are then in these respects altogether passive?  HYL.  I am.    PHIL.  Tell me now, whether SEEING consists in perceiving light and  colours, or in opening and turning the eyes?    HYL.  Without doubt, in the former.    PHIL.  Since therefore you are in the very perception of light and  colours altogether passive, what is become of that action you were  speaking of as an ingredient in every sensation? And, doth it not follow  from your own concessions, that the perception of light and colours,  including no action in it, may exist in an unperceiving substance? And is  not this a plain contradiction?    HYL.  I know not what to think of it.    PHIL.  Besides, since you distinguish the ACTIVE and PASSIVE in  every perception, you must do it in that of pain. But how is it possible  that pain, be it as little active as you please, should exist in an  unperceiving substance? In short, do but consider the point, and then  confess ingenuously, whether light and colours, tastes, sounds, &c. are  not all equally passions or sensations in the soul. You may indeed call  them EXTERNAL OBJECTS, and give them in words what subsistence you  please. But, examine your own thoughts, and then tell me whether it be  not as I say?    HYL.  I acknowledge, Philonous, that, upon a fair observation of what  passes in my mind, I can discover nothing else but that I am a thinking  being, affected with variety of sensations; neither is it possible to  conceive how a sensation should exist in an unperceiving substance. But  then, on the other hand, when I look on sensible things in a different  view, considering them as so many modes and qualities, I find it  necessary to suppose a MATERIAL SUBSTRATUM, without which they cannot  be conceived to exist.    PHIL.  MATERIAL SUBSTRATUM call you it? Pray, by which of your senses  came you acquainted with that being?    HYL.  It is not itself sensible; its modes and qualities only being  perceived by the senses.    PHIL.  I presume then it was by reflexion and reason you obtained  the idea of it?    HYL.  I do not pretend to any proper positive IDEA of it. However, I  conclude it exists, because qualities cannot be conceived to exist  without a support.    PHIL.  It seems then you have only a relative NOTION of it, or that  you conceive it not otherwise than by conceiving the relation it bears to  sensible qualities?    HYL.  Right.    PHIL.  Be pleased therefore to let me know wherein that relation  consists.    HYL.  Is it not sufficiently expressed in the term SUBSTRATUM, or  SUBSTANCE?    PHIL.  If so, the word SUBSTRATUM should import that it is spread  under the sensible qualities or accidents?    HYL.  True.    PHIL.  And consequently under extension?    HYL.  I own it.    PHIL.  It is therefore somewhat in its own nature entirely distinct  from extension?    HYL.  I tell you, extension is only a mode, and Matter is something that  supports modes. And is it not evident the thing supported is different  from the thing supporting?    PHIL.  So that something distinct from, and exclusive of, extension is  supposed to be the SUBSTRATUM of extension?    HYL.  Just so.    PHIL.  Answer me, Hylas. Can a thing be spread without extension? or is  not the idea of extension necessarily included in SPREADING?    HYL.  It is.    PHIL.  Whatsoever therefore you suppose spread under anything must have  in itself an extension distinct from the extension of that thing under  which it is spread?    HYL.  It must.    PHIL.  Consequently, every corporeal substance, being the SUBSTRATUM  of extension, must have in itself another extension, by which it is  qualified to be a SUBSTRATUM: and so on to infinity. And I ask whether  this be not absurd in itself, and repugnant to what you granted just now,  to wit, that the SUBSTRATUM was something distinct from and exclusive  of extension?    HYL.  Aye but, Philonous, you take me wrong. I do not mean that Matter  is SPREAD in a gross literal sense under extension. The word  SUBSTRATUM is used only to express in general the same thing with  SUBSTANCE.    PHIL.  Well then, let us examine the relation implied in the term  SUBSTANCE. Is it not that it stands under accidents?    HYL.  The very same."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4731"],[0,"Seven Little Australians (#6)"],[1,"opened the gate.    \"Oh, I say,\" remarked Pip, \"we'll get in an awful row, you know,  Fizz.  I don't think we'd better--I don't really, old girl.\"    \"Not a bit,\" said Judy, stoutly--\"at least, only a bit, and  the Aquarium's worth that.  Look how it's raining; the child will  get croup, or rheumatism, or something if we take him; there's  Father standing over on the green near the tennis-court talking to  a man.  I'll slip quietly along the veranda and into his own room,  and put the coat and the General on the bed; then I'll tell a  soldier to go and tell Father his parcels have come; and while  he's gone I'll fly back to you, and we'll catch the tram  and go to the Aquarium.\"    Pip whistled again softly.  He was used to bold proposals from  this sister of his, but this was beyond everything.  \"B--b--but,\"  he said uneasily, \"but, Judy, whatever would he do with that kid for  two mortal hours?\"    \"Mind him,\" Judy returned promptly.  \"It's a pretty thing if a  father can't mind his own child for two hours.  Afterwards, you  see, when we've been to the Aquarium, we will come back and fetch  him, and we can explain to Father how it was raining, and that we  thought we'd better not take him with us for fear of rheumatism,  and that we were in a hurry to catch the tram, and as he wasn't  in his room we just put him on the bed till he came.  Why, Pip,  it's beautifully simple!\"    Pip still looked uncomfortable.  \"I don't like it, Fizz,\" he said  again; \"he'll be in a fearful wax.\"    Judy gave him one exasperated look.  \"Go and see if that's the  Bondi tram coming,\" she said; and glad of a moment's respite,  he went down the path again to the pavement and looked down  the hill.  When he turned round again she had gone.    He stuck his hands in his pockets and walked up and down the path  a few times.  \"Fizz'll get us hanged yet,\" he muttered, looking  darkly at the door in the wall through which she had disappeared.  He pushed his hat to the back of hiss head and stared gloomily  at his boots, wondering what would be the consequences of this  new mischief.  There was a light footfall beside him.    \"Come on,\" said Judy, pulling his sleeve; \"it's done now, come on,  let's go and have our fun; have you got the money safe?\"    It was two o'clock as they passed out of the gate and turned  their faces up, the hill to the tram stopping-place.  And it was  half-past four when they jumped out of a town-bound tram and  entered the gates again to pick up their charge.    Such an afternoon as they had had!  Once inside the Aquarium,  even Pip had put his conscience qualms on one side, and bent all  his energies to enjoying himself thoroughly.  And Judy was like  a little mad thing.  She spent a shilling of her money on the  switchback railway, pronouncing the swift, bewildering motion  \"heavenly.\"  The first journey made Pip feel sick, so he  eschewed a repetition of it, and watched Judy go off from time to  time, waving gaily from the perilous little car, almost with his  heart in his mouth.  Then they hired a pair of roller skates each,  and bruised themselves black and blue with heavy falls on the  asphalt.  After that they had a ride on the merry-go-round, but  Judy found it tame after the switchback, and refused to squander  a second threepence upon it, contenting herself with watching Pip  fly round, and madly running by his side, to keep up as long as  she could.  They finished the afternoon with a prolonged  inspection of the fish-tanks, a light repast of jam tarts of  questionable freshness, and twopennyworth of peanuts.  And, as  I said, it was half-past four as they hastened up the path again  to the top gate of the Barracks.    \"I hope he's been good,\" Judy said, as she turned the handle.  \"Yes, you come, too, Pip\"--for that young gentleman hung back one  agonized second.  \"Twenty kicks or blows divided by two only make  ten, you see.\"    They went up the long stone veranda and stopped at one door.    There was a little knot of young officers laughing and talking  close by.    \"Take my word, 'twas as good as a play to see Wooly grabbing his  youngster, and stuffing it into a cab, and getting in himself, all  with a look of ponderous injured dignity,\" one said, and laughed  at the recollection.    Another blew away a cloud of cigar smoke.  \"It was a jolly little  beggar,\" he said.  \"It doubled its fists and landed His High  Mightiness one in the eye; and then its shoe dropped off, and  we all rushed to pick it up, and it was muddy and generally  dilapidated, and old Wooly went red slowly up to his ear-tips as  he tried to put it on.\"    A little figure stepped into the middle of the group--a little  figure with an impossibly short and shabby ulster, thin  black-stockinged legs, and a big hat crushed over a tangle of  curls.    \"It is my father you are speaking of,\" she said, her head very  high, her tone haughty, \"and I cannot tell where your amusement is.  Is my father here, or did I hear you say he had gone away?\"    Two of the men looked foolish, the third took off his cap.    \"I am sorry you should have overheard us, Miss Woolcot,\" he  said pleasantly.  \"Still, there is no irreparable harm done, is  there?  Yes, your father has gone away in a cab.  He couldn't  imagine how the little boy came on his bed, and, as he couldn't  keep him here very well, I suppose he has taken him home.\"    Something like a look of shame came into Judy's bright eyes,    \"I am afraid I must have put my father to some inconvenience,\"  she said quietly.  \"It was I who left the Gen--my brother here,  because I didn't know what to do with him for an hour or two.  But I quite meant to take him home myself.  Has he been gone  long?\"    \"About half an hour,\" the officer said, and tried not to look  amused at the little girl's old-fashioned manner.    \"Ah, thank you.  Perhaps we can catch him up.  Come on, Pip,\"  and, nodding in a grave, distant manner, she turned away, and  went down the veranda and through the gate with her brother.    \"A nice hole we're in,\" he said.    Judy nodded.    \"It's about the very awfullest thing we've ever done in our lives.  Fancy the governor carting that child all the way from here!  Oh,  lor'!\"    Judy nodded again.    \"Can't you speak?\" he said irritably.  \"You've got us into this--I  didn't want to do it; but I'll stand by you, of course.  Only  you'll have to think of something quick.\"    Judy bit three finger-tips off her right-hand glove, and looked  melancholy.    \"There's absolutely nothing to do, Pip,\" she said slowly.  \"I  didn't think it would turn out like this.  I suppose we'd better  just go straight back and hand ourselves over for punishment.  He'll be too angry to hear any sort of an excuse, so we'd better  just grin and hear whatever he does to us.  I'm really sorry, too,  that I made a laughing-stock of him up there.\"    Pip was explosive.  He called her a little ass and a gowk and a  stupid idiot for doing such a thing, and she did not reproach him  or answer back once.    They caught a tram and went into Sydney, and afterwards to the  boat.  They ensconced themselves in a corner at the far end, and  discussed the state of affairs with much seriousness.  Then Pip got  up and, strolled about a little to relieve his feelings, coming  back in a second with a white, scared face.    \"He's on the boat,\" he said, in a horrified whisper.    \"Where-where--where? what--what--what?\" Judy cried, unintentionally  mimicking a long-buried monarch.    \"In the cabin, looking as glum as a boiled wallaby, and hanging  on to the poor little General as if he thinks he'll fly away.\"    Judy looked a little frightened for the first time.  \"Can't we  hide?  Don't let him see us.  It wouldn't be any good offering to  take the General now.  We're in for it now, Pip--there'll be no  quarter.\"    Pip groaned; then Judy stood up.    \"Let's creep down as far as the engine,\" she said, \"and see if he  does look very bad.\"    They made their way cautiously along the deck, and took up a  position where they could see without being seen.  The dear  little General was sitting on the seat next to his stern father,  who had a firm hold of the back of his woolly-pelisse.  He was  sucking his little dirty hand, and casting occasional longing  glances at his tan shoe, which he knew was delicious to bite.  Once or twice he had pulled it off and conveyed it to his mouth,  but his father intercepted it, and angrily buttoned it on again  in its rightful place.  He wanted, too, to slither off the horrid  seat, and crawl all over the deck, and explore the ground under  the seats, and see where the puffing noise came from; but there  was that iron grasp on his coat that no amount of wriggling would  move.  No wonder the poor child looked unhappy!    At last the boat stopped at a wharf not far from Misrule, and the  Captain alighted, carrying his small dirty son gingerly in his  arms.  He walked slowly up the red road along which the dogcart  had sped so blithesomely some six or seven hours ago, and Judy  and Pip followed at a respectful--a very respectful--distance.  At the gate he saw them, and gave a large, angry beckon for them  to come up.  Judy went very white, but obeyed instantly, and Pip,  pulling himself together, brought up the rear.    Afterwards Judy only had a very indistinct remembrance of what  happened during the next half-hour.  She knew there was a stormy  scene, in which Esther and the whole family came in for an  immense amount of vituperation.    Then Pip received a thrashing, in spite of Judy's persistent avowal  that it was all her fault, and Pip hadn't done anything.  She  remembered wondering whether she would be treated as summarily as  Pip, so angry was her father's face as he pushed the boy aside  and stood looking at her, riding whip in hand.  But he flung  it, down and laid a heavy hand on her shrinking shoulder.    \"Next Monday,\" he said slowly--\"next Monday morning you will  go to boarding school."]]]
