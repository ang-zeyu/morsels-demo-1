The Scoliae do not dig a burrow which can be compared with that of the  other Hunting Wasps; they have no fixed residence, with an unimpeded  gallery opening on the outer world and giving access to the cells, the  abodes of the larvae. They have no entrance- and exit-doors, no corridor  built in advance. If they have to make their way underground, any point  not hitherto turned over serves their purpose, provided that it be  not too hard for their digging-tools, which, for that matter, are  very powerful; if they have to come out, the point of exit is no less  indifferent. The Scolia does not bore the soil through which she passes:  she excavates and ploughs it with her legs and forehead; and the stuff  shifted remains where it lies, behind her, forthwith blocking the  passage which she has followed. When she is about to emerge into the  outer world, her advent is heralded by the fresh soil which heaps itself  into a mound as though heaved up by the snout of some tiny Mole. The  insect sallies forth; and the mound collapses, completely filling up the  exit-hole. If the Wasp is entering the ground, the digging-operations,  undertaken at an arbitrary point, quickly yield a cavity in which the  Scolia disappears, separated from the surface by the whole track of  shifted material.    I can easily trace her passage through the thickness of the soil by  certain long, winding cylinders, formed of loose materials in the  midst of compact and stable earth. These cylinders are numerous;  they sometimes run to a depth of twenty inches; they extend in all  directions, fairly often crossing one another. Not one of them ever  exhibits so much as a suspicion of an open gallery. They are obviously  not permanent ways of communication with the outer world, but  hunting-trails which the insect has followed once, without going back  to them. What was the Wasp seeking when she riddled the soil with these  tunnels which are now full of running sands? No doubt the food for  her family, the larva of which I possess the empty skin, now an  unrecognizable shred.    I begin to see a little light: the Scoliae are underground workers. I  already expected as much, having before now captured Scoliae soiled with  little earthy encrustations on the joints of the legs. The Wasp, who is  so careful to keep clean, taking advantage of the least leisure to brush  and polish herself, could never display such blemishes unless she were a  devoted earth-worker. I used to suspect their trade, now I know it. They  live underground, where they burrow in search of Lamellicorn-grubs,  just as the Mole burrows in search of the White Worm. (The larva of the  Cockchafer. This grub takes three years or more to arrive at maturity  underground.--Translator's Note.) It is even possible that, after  receiving the embraces of the males, they but very rarely return to the  surface, absorbed as they are by their maternal duties; and this,  no doubt, is why my patience becomes exhausted in watching for their  entrance and their emergence.    It is in the subsoil that they establish themselves and travel to and  fro; with the help of their powerful mandibles, their hard cranium,  their strong, prickly legs, they easily make themselves paths in  the loose earth. They are living ploughshares. By the end of August,  therefore, the female population is for the most part underground,  busily occupied in egg-laying and provisioning. Everything seems to tell  me that I should watch in vain for the appearance of a few females in  the broad daylight; I must resign myself to excavating at random.    The result was hardly commensurate with the labour which I expended on  digging. I found a few cocoons, nearly all broken, like the one which I  already possessed, and, like it, bearing on their side the tattered skin  of a larva of the same Scarabaeid. Two of these cocoons which are still  intact contained a dead adult Wasp. This was actually the Two-banded  Scolia, a precious discovery which changed my suspicions into a  certainty.    I also unearthed some cocoons, slightly different in appearance,  containing an adult inmate, likewise dead, in whom I recognized the  Interrupted Scolia. The remnants of the provisions again consisted of  the empty skin of a larva, also a Lamellicorn, but not the same as the  one hunted by the first Scolia. And this was all. Now here, now there,  I shifted a few cubic yards of soil, without managing to find fresh  provisions with the egg or the young larva. And yet it was the right  season, the egg-laying season, for the males, numerous at the outset,  had grown rarer day by day until they disappeared entirely. My lack of  success was due to the uncertainty of my excavations, in which I had  nothing to guide me over the indefinite area covered.    If I could at least identify the Scarabaeidae whose larvae form the  prey of the two Scoliae, the problem would be half solved. Let us try.  I collect all that the luchet has turned up: larvae, nymphs and adult  Beetles. My booty comprises two species of Lamellicorns: Anoxia villosa  and Euchlora Julii, both of whom I find in the perfect state, usually  dead, but sometimes alive. I obtain a few of their nymphs, a great piece  of luck, for the larval skin which accompanies them will serve me as a  standard of comparison. I come upon plenty of larvae, of all ages.  When I compare them with the cast garment abandoned by the nymphs, I  recognize some as belonging to the Anoxia and the rest to the Euchlora.    With these data, I perceive with absolute certainty that the empty skin  adhering to the cocoon of the Interrupted Scolia belongs to the Anoxia.  As for the Euchlora, she is not involved in the problem: the larva  hunted by the Two-banded Scolia does not belong to her any more than it  belongs to the Anoxia. Then with which Scarabaeid does the empty skin  which is still unknown to me correspond? The Lamellicorn whom I am  seeking must exist in the ground which I have been exploring, because  the Two-banded Scolia has established herself there. Later--oh, very  long afterwards!--I recognized where my search was at fault. In order  not to find a network of roots beneath my luchet and to render the work  of excavation lighter, I was digging the bare places, at some distance  from the thickets of holm-oak; and it was just in those thickets, which  are rich in vegetable mould, that I should have sought. There, near the  old stumps, in the soil consisting of dead leaves and rotting wood, I  should certainly have come upon the larva so greatly desired, as will be  proved by what I have still to say.    Here ends what my earlier investigations taught me. There is reason to  believe that the Bois des Issards would never have furnished me with the  precise data, in the form in which I wanted them. The remoteness of the  spot, the fatigue of the expeditions, which the heat rendered intensely  exhausting, the impossibility of knowing which points to attack would  undoubtedly have discouraged me before the problem had advanced a step  farther. Studies such as these call for home leisure and application,  for residence in a country village. You are then familiar with every  spot in your own grounds and the surrounding country and you can go to  work with certainty.    Twenty-three years have passed; and here I am at Serignan, where I  have become a peasant, working by turns on my writing-pad and my  cabbage-patch. On the 14th of August, 1880, Favier (An ex-soldier who  acted as the author's gardener and factotum.--Translator's Note.)  clears away a heap of mould consisting of vegetable refuse and of leaves  stacked in a corner against the wall of the paddock. This clearance is  considered necessary because Bull, when the lovers' moon arrives, uses  this hillock to climb to the top of the wall and thence to repair to the  canine wedding the news of which is brought to him by the effluvia borne  upon the air. His pilgrimage fulfilled, he returns, with a discomfited  look and a slit ear, but always ready, once he has had his feed, to  repeat the escapade. To put an end to this licentious behaviour, which  has cost him so many gaping wounds, we decided to remove the heap of  soil which serves him as a ladder of escape.    Favier calls me while in the midst of his labours with the spade and  barrow:    \"Here's a find, sir, a great find! Come and look.\"    I hasten to the spot. The find is a magnificent one indeed and of a  nature to fill me with delight, awakening all my old recollections of  the Bois des Issards. Any number of females of the Two-banded Scolia,  disturbed at their work, are emerging here and there from the depth of  the soil. The cocoons also are plentiful, each lying next to the skin  of the victim on which the larva has fed. They are all open but still  fresh: they date from the present generation; the Scoliae whom I unearth  have quitted them not long since. I learnt later, in fact, that the  hatching took place in the course of July.    In the same heap of mould is a swarming colony of Scarabaeidae in the  form of larvae, nymphs and adult insects. It includes the largest of  our Beetles, the common Rhinoceros Beetle, or Oryctes nasicornis. I find  some who have been recently liberated, whose wing-cases, of a glossy  brown, now see the sunlight for the first time; I find others enclosed  in their earthen shell, almost as big as a Turkey's egg. More frequent  is her powerful larva, with its heavy paunch, bent into a hook. I note  the presence of a second bearer of the nasal horn, Oryctes Silenus,  who is much smaller than her kinswoman, and of Pentodon punctatus, a  Scarabaeid who ravages my lettuces.    But the predominant population consists of Cetoniae, or Rosechafers,  most of them enclosed in their egg-shaped shells, with earthen walls  encrusted with dung.

In the last voyage, both Captains Cook and King were of opinion, that  the inhabitants of Sandwich Islands received that distemper from our  people. The great deference I pay to their judgment on every occasion,  will hardly allow me to dissent from it in the present instance; and yet  I must be allowed to say, that the same evidence which proved convincing  to them in this case, did by no means appear so to me, and I will  endeavour to assign my reasons. When we first discovered Sandwich  Islands, in the month of January, 1778, the ships anchored at two of  them (viz. Atowai (Kauai) and Neehaw (Niihau)) where parties were sent  ashore for water, and to purchase provisions of the natives. On this  occasion, I must bear my testimony (for I was then in the \"Resolution\")  to the very particular care taken by Captain Cook, to prevent any of his  people who were not in perfect health, from having communication with  the shore, and also to prevent women from coming on board the ships.  That this humane precaution answered the intended purpose, we had great  reason to believe; for not one of those who did go on shore was  afterwards in the surgeon's list, or known to have any complaint; which  was the most convincing proof we could have, of their being well at the  time. We therefore were under no apprehensions on this head, when we  visited these islands a second time, about eleven months from our first  discovering them. We then fell in with two islands, (viz. Mowee (Maui)  and Ouwhyee (Hawaii)) belonging to the group, which we had not seen  before; and very soon found that the venereal disease was not unknown to  the natives. This excited no little concern and astonishment among us,  and made us anxious to learn whether or no, so dreadful a calamity had  been left at Atowai (Kauai) by our ships, and so propagated to these  islands. But the scanty knowledge we had of their language, made this a  matter of great difficulty, and rendered the best intelligence we could  get, but vague and uncertain. While we were cruising off Ouwhyee  (Hawaii), I was told, that some Indians had visited the \"Resolution\"  with that complaint upon them, and that they seemed to intimate, that  our ships had left it at Atowai (Kauai); whence it had found its way to  this island.    This account, I confess, appeared at once very improbable to me, and  rendered me very desirous of an opportunity to examine some of them  myself: for I found the above story gaining universal belief, and felt  somewhat hurt, that we should take to ourselves the ignominy of such an  imputation, without sufficient proof of its being just. During our stay  at Keragegooah bay (Kealakekua Bay), where we had constant opportunities  of directing our enquiries to the most intelligent of the natives, I met  with none who could give me any information on the subject, nor could I  learn that they had the least idea of our having left it at Atowai  (Kauai), or that it was a new thing amongst them. This circumstance,  added to the very slight reliance, which experience had taught me to  place in any intelligence obtained from the Indians, through the medium  of their language, confirmed me in the opinion I had entertained from  the first, that the meaning of those Indians had been misunderstood on  board the \"Resolution.\" An instance happened soon afterwards which  convinced me, that no credit whatsoever is to be given to such  information. We had not been long arrived at Atowai (Kauai) a second  time, before an Indian came on board the \"Discovery,\" who appeared to  the gentleman who first spoke to him, clearly to charge us with having  left the disease at that island, on our former visit. As I was known to  be an unbeliever, the man was at last referred to me; and, I confess, I  was a little staggered at first with the answers he gave me; but  presently, suspecting from his manner, that he would answer every  question proposed to him in the affirmative, I asked him, if they did  not receive the disease first from Oahoo (Oahu); a neighbouring island,  which we had not touched at, when we were in these parts before: the man  directly answered, that they had; and strenuously persisted in the same,  every time the question was put to him, either by myself, or the  gentleman who had first examined him. Such contradictory accounts as  these, prove nothing, but our ignorance of their language, and  consequently, how apt we are to be misled in enquiries of this sort. I  never put any confidence in them myself, and have often been surprised  to see others put so much. Yet those who have maintained that we left  the disease at Sandwich Islands, have no better foundation than this, to  rest their opinion upon. Whether it be sufficient to support such an  accusation, I will leave others to judge, after what I have related  above; and proceed to point out such other circumstances as tend to  prove, that the disease was not left at these islands by our ships. From  everything we could learn, it appeared, that there is but little  intercourse between Atowai (Kauai) and the islands to windward,  especially Ouwhyee (Hawaii), which is about fifty leagues distant; and  the nearest to Atowai (Kauai), which is Oahoo (Oahu), is five and twenty  leagues. There is generally some misunderstanding between them, and,  excepting for hostile purposes, the inhabitants rarely visit each other.  But were we even to allow, that there is a frequent intercourse between  them, which from the distance alone is highly improbable, yet it is  hardly possible, that the disease should have spread so far, and so  universally, as we found it at Ouwhyee (Hawaii), in the short space of  time which intervened between our first and second visit to the Sandwich  Islands. On the same supposition, it will appear very extraordinary,  that we should have found it more common by far at Ouwhyee (Hawaii) than  at Atowai (Kauai), the place where we are supposed to have first left  it. That this was the case, however, from my situation at that time, as  surgeon of the \"Discovery,\" I am able to pronounce with some certainty.  The priests pretended to be expert at curing it, and seemed to have an  established mode of treatment; which by no means implied, that it was a  recent complaint among them, much less that it was introduced only a few  months before.    Whence, or at what time, the inhabitants of those islands received  disease, or whether or not it be indigenous among them, is what I do not  pretend even to guess: but from the circumstances above-mentioned, I  think myself warranted in saying, that there are by no means sufficient  proofs of our having first introduced it; but that, on the contrary,  there is every reason to believe, that they were afflicted with it  before we discovered those islands.          FOOTNOTES:    [1] I take it for granted, that most of those into whose hands these  pages may fall, have perused Captain Cook's last Voyage, and therefore,  I have all along mentioned the names of the principal actors in this  account, as people with whom they are already acquainted. But as I  differ so much in the orthography of the language of the Sandwich  Islands from that used in the printed Voyage, it becomes necessary for  me to explain the names I use in this narrative, by those already known.  It may appear strange, how we should differ so much; but so it  is:--which is the most accurate, some future visitor may determine.

I was afterwards confirmed in this, by Kaireekea (Keliikia), the  priest, who particularly mentioned the name of the man who gave him the  blow, as well as that of the chief who afterwards struck him with the  dagger. This is a point not worth disputing about: I mention it, as  being solicitous to be accurate in this account, even in circumstances,  of themselves, not very material.
