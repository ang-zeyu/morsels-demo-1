Herbert, we did well to trust in Providence.\"    \"Yes, mother; and we have not trusted in vain.\"    After dinner Herbert did some chores for his mother, and then went to  the hotel to meet his new employer. He found him occupying a large and  pleasant room on the second floor. The table near the window was covered  with books, and there were some thirty or forty volumes arranged on  shelves.    \"I always bring books with me, Herbert,\" said the young man. \"I am very  fond of reading, and hitherto I have occupied too much time, perhaps, in  that way--too much, because it has interfered with necessary exercise.  Hereafter I shall devote my forenoon to some kind of outdoor exercise  in your company, and in the afternoon you can read to me, or we can  converse.\"    \"Shall I read to you now, Mr. Melville?\" asked Herbert.    \"Yes; here is a recent magazine. I will select an article for you to  read. It will rest my eyes, and besides it is pleasanter to have a  companion than to read one's self.\"    The article was one that interested Herbert as well as Mr. Melville, and  he was surprised when he had finished to find that it was nearly five  o'clock.    \"Didn't the reading tire you, Herbert?\" asked Melville.    \"No, sir; not at all.\"    \"It is evident that your lungs are stronger than mine.\"    At five o'clock Melville dismissed his young companion.    \"Do you wish me to come this evening?\" asked Herbert.    \"Oh, no. I wouldn't think of taking up your evenings.\"    \"At the post office I had to stay till eight o'clock.\"    \"Probably it was necessary there; I won't task you so much.\"    \"When shall I come to-morrow?\"    \"At nine o'clock.\"    \"That isn't very early,\" said Herbert, smiling.    \"No, I don't get up very early. My health won't allow me to cultivate  early rising. I shall not be through breakfast much before nine.\"    \"I see you don't mean to overwork me, Mr. Melville.\"    \"No, for it would involve overworking myself.\"    \"I shall certainly have an easy time,\" thought Herbert, as he walked  homeward.    He reflected with satisfaction that he was being paid at the rate of a  dollar a day, which was quite beyond anything he had ever before earned.  Indeed, to-day he had earned sixty cents besides. The sum received for  the fish.    After supper Herbert went to the store to purchase some articles for his  mother. He was waited on by Mr. Graham in person. As the articles called  for would amount to nearly one dollar, the storekeeper said, cautiously:  \"Of course, you are prepared to pay cash?\"    \"Certainly, sir,\" returned Herbert.    \"I mentioned it because I knew your income was small,\" said Ebenezer,  apologetically.    \"It is more than it was last week,\" said Herbert, rather enjoying the  prospect of surprising the storekeeper.    \"Why, you ain't found anything to do, have you?\" asked Mr. Graham, his  face indicating curiosity.    \"Yes, sir; I am engaged as companion by Mr. Melville, who is staying at  the hotel.\"    \"I don't know what he wants of a companion,\" said the storekeeper, with  that disposition to criticise the affairs of his neighbors often found  in country places.    \"He thinks he needs one,\" answered Herbert.    \"And how much does he pay you now?\" queried Ebenezer.    \"Six dollars a week.\"    \"You don't mean it!\" ejaculated the storekeeper. \"Why, the man must be  crazy!\"    \"I don't think he is,\" said Herbert, smiling.    \"Got plenty of money, I take it?\" continued Ebenezer, who had a good  share of curiosity.    \"Yes; he tells me he is rich.\"    \"How much money has he got?\"    \"He didn't tell me that.\"    \"Well, I declare! You're lucky, that's a fact!\"    There was an interested listener to this conversation in the person of  Eben, who had been in the store all day, taking Herbert's place. As  we know, the position by no means suited the young man. He had been  employed in a store in Boston, and to come back to a small country  grocery might certainly be considered a descent. Besides, the small  compensation allowed him was far from satisfying Eben.    He was even more dissatisfied when he learned how fortunate Herbert was.  To be selected as a companion by a rich young man was just what he would  have liked himself, and he flattered himself that he should make a more  desirable companion than a mere boy like Herbert.    As our hero was leaving the store, Eben called him back.    \"What was that you were telling father about going round with a young  man from the city?\" he asked.    Herbert repeated it.    \"And he pays you six dollars a week?\" asked Eben, enviously.    \"Yes; of course, I shouldn't have asked so much, but he fixed the price  himself.\"    \"You think he is very rich?\" said Eben, thoughtfully.    \"Yes, I think so.\"    \"What a splendid chance it would be for me!\" thought Eben. \"If I could  get intimate with a man like that, he might set me up in business some  day; perhaps take me to Europe, or round the world!\" \"How much of the  time do you expect to be with this Mr. Melville?\" he asked.    Herbert answered the question.    \"Does he seem like a man easy to get along with?\"    \"Very much so.\"    Eben inwardly decided that, if he could, he would oust Herbert from his  desirable place, and substitute himself. It was a very mean thought, but  Eben inherited meanness from his father.    \"Herbert,\" he said, \"will you do me a favor?\"    \"What is it?\" asked our hero.    \"Will you take my place in the store this evening? I am not feeling  well, and want to take a walk.\"    \"Yes,\" answered Herbert, \"as soon as I have run home to tell mother  where I am.\"    \"That's a good fellow. You shan't lose anything by it. I'll give you ten  cents.\"    \"You needn't pay me anything, Eben. I'll do it as a favor.\"    \"You're a trump, Herbert. Come back as soon as you can.\"    When Eben was released from the store, he went over to the hotel, and  inquired for Mr. Melville, leaving his unsuspecting young substitute in  the post office.          CHAPTER VIII. EBEN'S ASSURANCE.        \"A young man wishes to see you, Mr. Melville,\" said the servant.    George Melville looked up in some surprise from his book, and said: \"You  may show him up.\"    \"It must be Herbert,\" he thought.    But when the door was opened, and the visitor shown in, Mr. Melville  found it was an older person than Herbert. Eben, for it was he,  distorted his mean features into what he regarded as a pleasant smile,  and, without waiting to receive a welcome, came forward with extended  hand.    \"I believe you are Mr. Melville,\" he said, inquiringly.    \"Yes, that is my name,\" said Melville, looking puzzled; \"I don't  remember you. Have I met you before?\"    \"You saw me in father's store, very likely,\" said Eben. \"I am Eben  Graham, son of Ebenezer Graham, the postmaster.\"    \"Indeed! That accounts for your face looking familiar. You resemble your  father very closely.\"    \"I'm a chip off the old block with modern improvements,\" said Eben,  smirking. \"Father's always lived in the country, and he ain't very  stylish. I've been employed in Boston for a couple of years past, and  got a little city polish.\"    \"You don't show much of it,\" thought Melville, but he refrained from  saying so.    \"So you have come home to assist your father,\" he said, politely.    \"Well, no, not exactly,\" answered Eben, \"I feel that a country store  isn't my sphere.\"    \"Then you propose to go back to the city?\"    \"Probably I shall do so eventually, but I may stay here in Wayneboro a  while if I can make satisfactory arrangements. I assure you that it was  not my wish to take Herbert Carr's place.\"    \"Herbert told me that you had assumed his duties.\"    \"It is only ad interim. I assure you, it is only ad interim. I am quite  ready to give back the place to Herbert, who is better suited to it than  I.\"    \"I wonder what the fellow is driving at,\" thought Melville. Eben did not  long leave him in doubt.    \"Herbert tells me that he has made an engagement with you,\" continued  Eben, desiring to come to his business as soon as possible.    \"Yes, we have made a mutual arrangement.\"    \"Of course, it is very nice for him; and so I told him.\"    \"I think I am quite as much a gainer by it as he is,\" said Melville.    \"Herbert was right. He is easily suited,\" said Eben, to himself.    \"Of course,\" Eben added, clearing his throat, \"Herbert isn't so much of  a companion to you as if he were a few years older.\"    \"I don't know that; it seems to me that he is a very pleasant companion,  young as he is.\"    \"To be sure, Herbert is a nice boy, and father was glad to help him  along by giving him a place, with a larger salary than he ever paid  before.\"    \"What is he driving at?\" thought Melville.    \"To come to the point, Mr. Melville,\" said Eben, \"I have made bold to  call upon you to suggest a little difference in your arrangements.\"    \"Indeed!\" said Melville, coldly. Though he had no idea what his singular  visitor was about to propose, it struck him emphatically that Eben was  interfering in an unwarrantable manner with his affairs.    \"You see,\" continued Eben, \"I'm a good deal nearer your age than  Herbert, and I've had the advantage of residing in the city, which  Herbert hasn't, and naturally should be more company to you. Then,  again, Herbert could do the work in the post office and store, which I  am doing, nearly as well as I can. I'll undertake to get father to give  him back his place, and then I shall be happy to make an arrangement  with you to go hunting and fishing, or anything else that you choose.  I am sure I should enjoy your company, Mr. Melville,\" concluded Eben,  rubbing his hands complacently and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5760"],[0,"Two Trips to Gorilla Land and the Cataracts of the Congo, Volume 1 (#6)"],[1,"a black wall, except where a gleam of grey light  suggested the further end of the Box Tunnel, and cheered our poor  hearts for a short minute, whilst in the distance we heard the  tantalizing song of the wild waves. The boughs on both sides  brushed the boat; we held our hands before our faces to avoid the  sharp stubs threatening ugly stabs, and to fend off the low  branches, ready to sweep us and our belongings into the deep  swirling water. The shades closed in like the walls of the  Italian's dungeon; until our eyes grew to it, the blackness of  Erebus weighed upon our spirits; perspiration poured from our  brows, and in this watery mangrove-lane the pabulum vitæ seemed  to be wanting. After forcing a passage through three vile  \"gates,\" the sheet-lightning announced a second tornado. We  sighed for more vivid flashes, but after twenty minutes they  dimmed and died away, still showing the \"bush\"-silhouette on  either side. The tide rushed out in strength under the amphibious  forest--all who know the West Coast will appreciate the position.  It was impossible to advance or to remain in this devil's den,  the gig bumped at every minute, and the early flood would  probably crush her against the trees. So we dropped down to the  nearest \"open,\" which we reached at 9.30 P.M.    After enduring a third tornado we grounded, and the crew sprang  ashore, saying that they were going to boil plantains on the  bank. I made snug for the night with a wet waterproof and a strip  of muslin, to be fastened round the mouth after the fashion of  Outram's \"fever guard,\" and shut my lips to save my life, by the  particular advice of Dr. Catlin. The first mosquito piped his \"Io  Pæan\" at 8 P.M.; another hour brought legions, and then began the  battle for our blood. I had resolved not to sleep in the fetid  air of the jungle; time, however, moved on wings of lead; a dull  remembrance of a watery moon, stars dimly visible, a southerly  breeze, and heavy drops falling from the trees long haunted me.  About midnight, Prince Paul, who had bewailed the hardship of  passing a night sans mostiquaire in the bush, and whose violent  plungings showed that he failed to manage un somme, proposed to  land and to fetch fire from l'habitation.    \"What habitation?\"    \"Oh! a little village belonging to papa.\"    \"And why the ---didn't you mention it?\"    \"Ah! this is Mponbinda, and you know we're bound for Mbátá!\"    Nothing negrotic now astonishes us, there is nought new to me in  Africa. We landed upon a natural pier of rock ledge, and, after  some 400 yards of good path, we entered a neat little village,  and found our crew snoring snugly asleep. We \"exhorted them,\"  refreshed the fire, and generously recruited exhausted nature  with quinine, julienne and tea, potatoes and potted meats, pipes  and cigars. So sped my annual unlucky day, and thus was spent my  first jungle-night almost exactly under the African line.    At 5 A. M. the new morning dawned, the young tide flowed, the  crabs disappeared, and the gig, before high and dry on the hard  mud, once more became buoyant. Forward again! The channel was a  labyrinthine ditch, an interminable complication of over-arching  roots, and of fallen trees forming gateways; the threshold was a  maze of slimy stumps, stems, and forks in every stage of growth  and decay, dense enough to exclude the air of heaven. In parts  there were ugly snags, and everywhere the turns were so puzzling,  that I marvelled how a human being could attempt the passage by  night. The best time for ascending is half-flood, for descending  half-ebb; if the water be too high, the bush chokes the way; if  too low, the craft grounds. At the Gaboon mouth the tide rises  three feet; at the head of the Mbátá Creek, where it arrests the  sweet water rivulet, it is, of course, higher.    And now the scene improved. The hat-palm, a brab or wild date,  the spine-palm (Phnix spinosa), and the Okumeh or cotton-tree  disputed the ground with the foul Rhizophora. Then clearings  appeared. At Ejéné, the second of two landing-places evidently  leading to farms, we transferred ourselves to canoes, our boat  being arrested by a fallen tree. Advancing a few yards, all  disembarked upon trampled mud, and, ascending the bank, left the  creek which supplies baths and drinking water to our destination.  Striking a fair pathway, we passed westward over a low wave of  ground, sandy and mouldy, and traversed a fern field surrounded  by a forest of secular trees; some parasite-grown from twig to  root, others blanched and scathed by the fires of heaven; these  roped and corded with runners and llianas, those naked and  clothed in motley patches. At 6.30 A.M., after an hour's work,  probably representing a mile, and a total of 7 h. 30 m., or six  miles in a south-south-west direction from Le Plateau, we left  the ugly cul de sac of a creek, and entered Mbátá, which the  French call \"La Plantation.\"    Women and children fled in terror at our approach--and no wonder:  eyes like hunted boars, haggard faces, yellow as the sails at the  Cape Verdes, and beards two days long, act very unlike cosmetics.  A house was cleared for us by Hotaloya, alias \"Andrew,\" of the  Baráka Mission, the lord of the village, who, poor fellow! has  only two wives; he is much ashamed of himself, but his excuse is,  \"I be boy now,\" meaning about twenty-two. After breakfast we  prepared for a sleep, but the popular excitement forbade it; the  villagers had heard that a white greenhorn was coming to bag and  to buy gorillas, and they resolved to make hay whilst the sun  shone.    Prince Paul at once gathered together a goodly crowd of fathers  and mothers, uncles and aunts, brothers and sisters, cousins and  connections. A large and loud-voiced dame, \"Gozeli,\" swore that  she was his \"proper Ngwe,\" being one of his numerous step mas,  and she would not move without a head, or three leaves, of  tobacco. Hotaloya was his brother; Mesdames Azízeh and Asúnye  declared themselves his sisters, and so all. My little stock of  goods began visibly to shrink, when I informed the greedy  applicants that nothing beyond a leaf of tobacco and a demi verre  of tafia would be given until I had seen my way to work.  Presently appeared the chief huntsman appointed by Roi Denis to  take charge of me, he was named Fortuna, a Spanish name corrupted  to Forteune. A dash was then prepared for his majesty and for  Prince Paul. I regret to say that this young nobleman ended his  leave-taking by introducing a pretty woman, with very neat hands  and ankles and a most mutine physiognomy, as his sister,  informing me that she was also my wife pro temp. She did not seem  likely to coiffer Sainte Cathérine, and here she is.    The last thing the prince did was to carry off, without a word of  leave, the mission boat and the three Kru-boys, whom he kept two  days. I was uneasy about these fellows, who, hating and fearing  the Gaboon \"bush,\" are ever ready to bolt.    Forteune and Hotaloya personally knew Mpolo (Paul du Chaillu),  and often spoke to me of his prowess as a chasseur and his  knowledge of their tongue. But reputation as a linguist is easily  made in these regions by speaking a few common sentences. The  gorilla-hunter evidently had only a colloquial acquaintance with  the half-dozen various idioms of the Mpongwe and Mpángwe (Fán)  Bakele, Shekyani, and Cape Lopez people. Yet, despite verbal  inaccuracies, his facility of talking gave him immense advantages  over other whites, chiefly in this, that the natives would deem  it useless to try the usual tricks upon travellers.    Forteune is black, short, and \"trapu;\" curls of the jettiest  lanugo invest all his outward man; bunches of muscle stand out  from his frame like the statues of Crotonian Milo; his legs are  bandy; his hands and feet are large and patulous, and he wants  only a hunch to make an admirable Quasimodo. He has the frank and  open countenance of a sportsman--I had been particularly warned  by the Plateau folk about his skill in cheating and lying.  Formerly a cook at the Gaboon, he is a man of note in his tribe,  as the hunter always is; he holds the position of a country  gentleman, who can afford to write himself M.F.H.; he is looked  upon as a man of valour; he is admired by the people, and he is  adored by his wives--one of them at once took up her station upon  the marital knee. Perhaps the Nimrod of Mbátá is just a little  henpecked--the Mpongwe mostly are--and I soon found out that  soigner les femmes is the royal road to getting on with the men.  He supplies the village with \"beef,\" here meaning not the roast  of Old England, but any meat, from a field-rat to a hippopotamus.  He boasts that he has slain with his own hand upwards of a  hundred gorillas and anthropoid apes, and, since the demand arose  in Europe, he has supplied Mr. R.B.N. Walker and others with an  average of one per month, including a live youngster; probably  most, if not all, of them were killed by his \"bushmen,\" of whom  he can command about a dozen.    Forteune began by receiving his \"dash,\" six fathoms of \"satin  cloth,\" tobacco, and pipes. After inspecting my battery, he  particularly approved of a smooth-bored double-barrel (Beattie of  Regent Street) carrying six to the pound. Like all these people,  he uses an old and rickety trade-musket, and, when lead is  wanting, he loads it with a bit of tile: as many gorillas are  killed with tools which would hardly bring down a wild cat, it is  evident that their vital power cannot be great. He owned to  preferring a charge of twenty buckshot to a single ball, and he  received with joy a little fine gunpowder, which he compared  complimentarily with the blasting article, half charcoal withal,  to which he was accustomed.    Presently a decently dressed, white-bearded man of light  complexion announced himself, with a flourish and a loud call for  a chair, as Prince Koyálá, alias \"Young Prince,\" "]]]
