The considerations which I have set forth seem to me strictly logical:  the Anthrax, owing to the very fact that he is free to take his  nourishment where he pleases on the body of the fostering larva, must,  for his own protection, be made incapable of opening his victim's body.  I am so utterly convinced of this harmonious relation between the eater  and the eaten that I do not hesitate to set it up as a principle. I  will therefore say this: whenever the egg of any kind of insect is not  fastened to the larva destined for its food, the young grub, free to  select the attacking point and to change it at will, is as it were  muzzled and consumes its provisions by a sort of suction, without  inflicting any appreciable wound. This restriction is essential to the  maintenance of the victuals in good condition. My principle is already  supported by examples many and various, whose depositions are all to the  same effect. The witnesses include, after the Anthrax, the Leucospis  [a parasitic insect] and his rivals, whose evidence we shall hear  presently; the Ephialtes mediator [an Ichneumon fly], who feeds, in  the dry brambles, on the larva of the Black Psen [a digger wasp]; the  Myodites, that strange, fly-shaped beetle whose grub consumes the larva  of the cockchafer. All--flies, ichneumon flies and beetles--scrupulously  spare their foster mother; they are careful not to tear her skin, so  that the vessel may keep its liquid good to the last.    The wholesomeness of the victuals is not the only condition imposed:  I find a second, which is no less essential. The substance of the  fostering larva must be sufficiently fluid to ooze through the unbroken  skin under the action of the sucker. Well, the necessary fluidity is  realized as the time of the metamorphosis draws near. When they wished  Medea to restore Pelias to the vigor of youth, his daughters cut the old  king's body to pieces and boiled it in a cauldron, for there can be no  new existence without a prior dissolution. We must pull down before  we can rebuild; the analysis of death is the first step towards the  synthesis of life. The substance of the grub that is to be transformed  into a bee begins, therefore, by disintegrating and dissolving into  a fluid broth. The materials of the future insect are obtained by a  general recasting. Even as the founder puts his old bronzes into the  melting pot in order afterwards to cast them in a mould whence the metal  will issue in a different shape, so life liquefies the grub, a mere  digesting machine, now thrown aside, and out of its running matter  produces the perfect insect, bee, butterfly or beetle, the final  manifestation of the living creature.    Let us open a Chalicodoma grub under the microscope, during the period  of torpor. Its contents consists almost entirely of a liquid broth, in  which swim numberless oily globules and a fine dust of uric acid, a sort  of off-throw of the oxidized tissues. A flowing thing, shapeless and  nameless, is all that the animal is, if we add abundant ramified air  ducts, some nervous filaments and, under the skin, a thin layer  of muscular fibers. A condition of this kind accounts for a fatty  transpiration through the skin when the Anthrax' sucker is at work. At  any other time, when the larva is in the active period or else when the  insect has reached the perfect stage, the firmness of the tissues would  resist the transfusion and the suckling of the Anthrax would become a  difficult matter, or even impossible. In point of fact, I find the grub  of the fly established, in the vast majority of cases, on the sleeping  larva and sometimes, but rarely, on the pupa. Never do I see it on the  vigorous larva eating its honey; and hardly ever on the insect brought  to perfection, as we find it enclosed in its cell all through the autumn  and winter. And we can say the same of the other grub eaters that drain  their victims without wounding them: all are engaged in their death  dealing work during the period of torpor, when the tissues are  fluidified. They empty their patient, who has become a bag of running  grease with a diffused life; but not one, among those I know, reaches  the Anthrax' perfection in the art of extraction.    Nor can any be compared with the Anthrax as regards the means brought  into play in order to leave the cell. These others, when they become  perfect insects, have implements for sapping and demolishing, stout  mandibles, capable of digging the ground, of pulling down clay partition  walls and even of reducing the mason bee's tough cement to powder. The  Anthrax, in her final form, has nothing like this. Her mouth is a short,  soft proboscis, good at most for soberly licking the sugary exudations  of the flowers; her slim legs are so feeble that to move a grain of  sand were an excessive task for them, enough to strain every joint; her  great, stiff wings, which must remain full spread, do not allow her to  slip through a narrow passage; her delicate suit of downy velvet, from  which you take the bloom by merely breathing on it, could not withstand  the rough contact of the gallery of a mine. Unable herself to enter the  Mason bee's cell to lay her egg, she cannot leave it either, when the  time comes to free herself and appear in broad daylight in her wedding  dress. The larva, on its side, is powerless to prepare the way for  the coming flight. That buttery little cylinder, owning no tools but a  sucker so flimsy that it barely arrives at substance and so small that  it is almost a geometrical point, is even weaker than the adult insect,  which at least flies and walks. The Mason bee's cell represents to it  a granite cave. How to get out? The problem would be insoluble to those  two incapables, if nothing else played its part.    Among insects, the nymph, or pupa, the transition stage between the  larval and the adult form, is generally a striking picture of every  weakness of a budding organism. A sort of mummy tight bound in swaddling  clothes, motionless and impassive, it awaits the resurrection. Its  tender tissues flow in every direction; its limbs, transparent as  crystal, are held fixed in their place, along the side, lest a  movement should disturb the exquisite delicacy of the work in course  of accomplishment. Even so, to secure his recovery, is a broken boned  patient held captive in the surgeon's bandages. Absolute stillness is  necessary in both cases, lest they be crippled or even die.    Well, here, by a strange inversion that confuses all our views on life,  a Cyclopean task is laid upon the nymph of the Anthrax. It is the nymph  that has to toil, to strive, to exhaust itself in efforts to burst the  wall and open the way out. To the embryo falls the desperate duty, which  shows no mercy to the nascent flesh; to the adult insect the joy of  resting in the sun. This transposition of functions has as its result  a well sinker's equipment in the nymph, an eccentric, complicated  equipment which nothing suggested in the larva and which nothing recalls  in the perfect insect. The set of tools includes an assortment of  plowshares, gimlets, hooks and spears and of other implements that are  not found in our trades nor named in our dictionaries. Let us do our  best to describe the strange piercing gear.    In a fortnight at most, the Anthrax has consumed the Chalicodoma grub,  whereof naught remains but the skin, gathered into a white granule. By  the time that July is nearly over, it becomes rare to find any nurslings  left upon their nurses. From this period until the following May,  nothing fresh happens. The Anthrax retains its larval shape without any  appreciable change and lies motionless in the mason bee's cocoon, beside  the pellet remains. When the fine days of May arrive, the grub shrivels  and casts its skin and the nymph appears, fully clad in a stout,  reddish, horny hide.    The head is round and large, separated from the thorax by a strangulated  furrow, crowned on top and in front with a sort of diadem of six hard,  sharp, black spikes, arranged in a semicircle whose concave side faces  downward. These spikes decrease slightly in length from the summit to  the ends of the arch. Taken together, they suggest the radial crowns  which we see the Roman emperors of the Decadence wear on the medals.  This six-fold plowshare is the chief excavating tool. Lower down, on the  median line, the instrument is finished off with a separate group of two  small black spikes, placed close together.    The thorax is smooth, the wing cases large, folded under the body like  a scarf and coming almost to the middle of the abdomen. This has nine  segments, of which four, starting with the second, are armed, on the  back, down the middle, with a belt of little horny arches, pale brown in  color, drawn up parallel to one another, set in the skin by their  convex surfaces and finishing at both ends with a hard, black point.  Altogether, the belt thus forms a double row of little thorns, with a  hollow in between. I count about twenty-five twin-toothed arches to one  segment, which gives a total of two hundred spikes for the four rings  thus armed.    The use of this rasp, or grater, is obvious: it gives the nymph a  purchase on the wall of its gallery as the work proceeds. Thus anchored  on a host of points, the stern pioneer is able to hit the obstacle  harder with its diadem of awls. Moreover, to make it more difficult for  the instrument to recoil, long, stiff bristles, pointing backwards,  are scattered here and there among the climbing belts. There are some  besides on the other segments, both on the ventral and the dorsal  surface. On the flanks, they are thicker and arranged as it were in  clusters.    The sixth segment carries a similar belt, but a much less powerful one,  consisting of a single row of unassuming thorns. The belt is weaker  still on the seventh segment; lastly, on the eighth, it is reduced to a  mere "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3424"],[0,"For the Term of His Natural Life (#6)"],[1," cries Blunt. \"We are talking of your eyes, my  dear.\" \"Well, they'll bear talking about, captain, won't they?\" asked  she, turning them full upon him.    \"By the Lord, they will!\" says Blunt, smacking his hand on the table.  \"They're the finest eyes I've seen in my life, and they've got the  reddest lips under 'm that--\"    \"Let me pass, Captain Blunt, if you please. Thank you, doctor.\"    And before the admiring commander could prevent her, she modestly swept  out of the cuddy.    \"She's a fine piece of goods, eh?\" asked Blunt, watching her. \"A spice  o' the devil in her, too.\"    Old Pine took a huge pinch of snuff.    \"Devil! I tell you what it is, Blunt. I don't know where Vickers picked  her up, but I'd rather trust my life with the worst of those ruffians  'tween decks, than in her keeping, if I'd done her an injury.\"    Blunt laughed.    \"I don't believe she'd think much of sticking a man, either!\" he said,  rising. \"But I must go on deck, doctor.\" Pine followed him more slowly.  \"I don't pretend to know much about women,\" he said to himself, \"but  that girl's got a story of her own, or I'm much mistaken. What brings  her on board this ship as lady's-maid is more than I can fathom.\" And  as, sticking his pipe between his teeth, he walked down the now deserted  deck to the main hatchway, and turned to watch the white figure gliding  up and down the poop-deck, he saw it joined by another and a darker one,  he muttered, \"She's after no good, I'll swear.\"    At that moment his arm was touched by a soldier in undress uniform, who  had come up the hatchway. \"What is it?\"    The man drew himself up and saluted.    \"If you please, doctor, one of the prisoners is taken sick, and as the  dinner's over, and he's pretty bad, I ventured to disturb your honour.\"    \"You ass!\" says Pine--who, like many gruff men, had a good heart under  his rough shell--\"why didn't you tell me before?\" and knocking the ashes  out of his barely-lighted pipe, he stopped that implement with a twist  of paper and followed his summoner down the hatchway.    In the meantime the woman who was the object of the grim old fellow's  suspicions was enjoying the comparative coolness of the night air.  Her mistress and her mistress's daughter had not yet come out of their  cabin, and the men had not yet finished their evening's tobacco. The  awning had been removed, the stars were shining in the moonless sky, the  poop guard had shifted itself to the quarter-deck, and Miss Sarah Purfoy  was walking up and down the deserted poop, in close tete-a-tete with no  less a person than Captain Blunt himself. She had passed and repassed  him twice silently, and at the third turn the big fellow, peering into  the twilight ahead somewhat uneasily, obeyed the glitter of her great  eyes, and joined her.    \"You weren't put out, my wench,\" he asked, \"at what I said to you  below?\"    She affected surprise.    \"What do you mean?\"    \"Why, at my--at what I--at my rudeness, there! For I was a bit rude, I  admit.\"    \"I? Oh dear, no. You were not rude.\"    \"Glad you think so!\" returned Phineas Blunt, a little ashamed at what  looked like a confession of weakness on his part.    \"You would have been--if I had let you.\"    \"How do you know?\"    \"I saw it in your face. Do you think a woman can't see in a man's face  when he's going to insult her?\"    \"Insult you, hey! Upon my word!\"    \"Yes, insult me. You're old enough to be my father, Captain Blunt, but  you've no right to kiss me, unless I ask you.\"    \"Haw, haw!\" laughed Blunt. \"I like that. Ask me! Egad, I wish you would,  you black-eyed minx!\"    \"So would other people, I have no doubt.\" \"That soldier officer, for  instance. Hey, Miss Modesty? I've seen him looking at you as though he'd  like to try.\"    The girl flashed at him with a quick side glance.    \"You mean Lieutenant Frere, I suppose. Are you jealous of him?\"    \"Jealous! Why, damme, the lad was only breeched the other day. Jealous!\"    \"I think you are--and you've no need to be. He is a stupid booby, though  he is Lieutenant Frere.\"    \"So he is. You are right there, by the Lord.\"    Sarah Purfoy laughed a low, full-toned laugh, whose sound made Blunt's  pulse take a jump forward, and sent the blood tingling down to his  fingers ends.    \"Captain Blunt,\" said she, \"you're going to do a very silly thing.\"    He came close to her and tried to take her hand.    \"What?\"    She answered by another question.    \"How old are you?\"    \"Forty-two, if you must know.\"    \"Oh! And you are going to fall in love with a girl of nineteen.\"    \"Who is that?\"    \"Myself!\" she said, giving him her hand and smiling at him with her rich  red lips.    The mizen hid them from the man at the wheel, and the twilight of  tropical stars held the main-deck. Blunt felt the breath of this strange  woman warm on his cheek, her eyes seemed to wax and wane, and the hard,  small hand he held burnt like fire.    \"I believe you are right,\" he cried. \"I am half in love with you  already.\"    She gazed at him with a contemptuous sinking of her heavily fringed  eyelids, and withdrew her hand.    \"Then don't get to the other half, or you'll regret it.\"    \"Shall I?\" asked Blunt. \"That's my affair. Come, you little vixen, give  me that kiss you said I was going to ask you for below,\" and he caught  her in his arms.    In an instant she had twisted herself free, and confronted him with  flashing eyes.    \"You dare!\" she cried. \"Kiss me by force! Pooh! you make love like a  schoolboy. If you can make me like you, I'll kiss you as often as you  will. If you can't, keep your distance, please.\"    Blunt did not know whether to laugh or be angry at this rebuff. He was  conscious that he was in rather a ridiculous position, and so decided to  laugh.    \"You're a spitfire, too. What must I do to make you like me?\"    She made him a curtsy.    \"That is your affair,\" she said; and as the head of Mr. Frere appeared  above the companion, Blunt walked aft, feeling considerably bewildered,  and yet not displeased.    \"She's a fine girl, by jingo,\" he said, cocking his cap, \"and I'm hanged  if she ain't sweet upon me.\"    And then the old fellow began to whistle softly to himself as he paced  the deck, and to glance towards the man who had taken his place with no  friendly eyes. But a sort of shame held him as yet, and he kept aloof.    Maurice Frere's greeting was short enough.    \"Well, Sarah,\" he said, \"have you got out of your temper?\"    She frowned.    \"What did you strike the man for? He did you no harm.\"    \"He was out of his place. What business had he to come aft? One must  keep these wretches down, my girl.\"    \"Or they will be too much for you, eh? Do you think one man could  capture a ship, Mr. Maurice?\"    \"No, but one hundred might.\"    \"Nonsense! What could they do against the soldiers? There are fifty  soldiers.\"    \"So there are, but--\"    \"But what?\"    \"Well, never mind. It's against the rules, and I won't have it.\"    \"'Not according to the King's Regulations,' as Captain Vickers would  say.\"    Frere laughed at her imitation of his pompous captain.    \"You are a strange girl; I can't make you out. Come,\" and he took her  hand, \"tell me what you are really.\"    \"Will you promise not to tell?\"    \"Of course.\"    \"Upon your word?\"    \"Upon my word.\"    \"Well, then--but you'll tell?\"    \"Not I. Come, go on.\"    \"Lady's-maid in the family of a gentleman going abroad.\"    \"Sarah, you can't be serious?\" \"I am serious. That was the advertisement  I answered.\"    \"But I mean what you have been. You were not a lady's-maid all your  life?\"    She pulled her shawl closer round her and shivered.    \"People are not born ladies' maids, I suppose?\"    \"Well, who are you, then? Have you no friends? What have you been?\"    She looked up into the young man's face--a little less harsh at  that moment than it was wont to be--and creeping closer to him,  whispered--\"Do you love me, Maurice?\"    He raised one of the little hands that rested on the taffrail, and,  under cover of the darkness, kissed it.    \"You know I do,\" he said. \"You may be a lady's-maid or what you like,  but you are the loveliest woman I ever met.\"    She smiled at his vehemence.    \"Then, if you love me, what does it matter?\" \"If you loved me, you would  tell me,\" said he, with a quickness which surprised himself.    \"But I have nothing to tell, and I don't love you--yet.\"    He let her hand fall with an impatient gesture; and at that moment  Blunt--who could restrain himself no longer--came up.    \"Fine night, Mr. Frere?\"    \"Yes, fine enough.\"    \"No signs of a breeze yet, though.\"    \"No, not yet.\"    Just then, from out of the violet haze that hung over the horizon, a  strange glow of light broke.    \"Hallo,\" cries Frere, \"did you see that?\"    All had seen it, but they looked for its repetition in vain. Blunt  rubbed his eyes.    \"I saw it,\" he said, \"distinctly. A flash of light.\" They strained their  eyes to pierce through the obscurity.    \"Best saw something like it before dinner. There must be thunder in the  air.\"    At that instant a thin streak of light shot up and then sank again.  There was no mistaking it this time, and a simultaneous exclamation  burst from all on deck. From out the gloom which hung over the horizon  rose a column of flame that lighted up the night for an instant, and  then sunk, leaving a dull red spark upon the water.    \"It's a ship on fire,\" cried Frere.          CHAPTER III. THE MONOTONY BREAKS.        They looked again, the tiny spark still burned, and immediately over it  there grew out of the darkness a crimson spot, that hung like a lurid  star in the air. The soldiers and sailors on the forecastle had seen  it also, and in a moment the whole vessel was astir. Mrs. Vickers, with  little Sylvia clinging to her dress, came up to share the new sensation;  and at the sight of her mistress, the modest maid withdrew discreetly  from Frere's side. Not that there was any need to do so; no one heeded  "]]]
