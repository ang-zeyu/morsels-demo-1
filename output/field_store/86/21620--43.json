GRADED SLOPES. Where rocks weather faster than their waste is  carried away, the waste comes at last to cover all rocky ledges.  On the steeper slopes it is coarser and in more rapid movement  than on slopes more gentle, but mountain sides and hills and  plains alike come to be mantled with sheets of waste which  everywhere is creeping toward the streams. Such unbroken slopes,  worn or built to the least inclination at which the waste supplied  by weathering can be urged onward, are known as GRADED SLOPES.    Of far less importance than the silent, gradual creep of waste,  which is going on at all times everywhere about us, are the  startling local and spasmodic movements which we are now to  describe.    AVALANCHES. On steep mountain sides the accumulated snows of  winter often slip and slide in avalanches to the valleys below.  These rushing torrents of snow sweep their tracks clean of waste  and are one of Nature's normal methods of moving it along the  downhill path.    LANDSLIDES. Another common and abrupt method of delivering waste  to streams is by slips of the waste mantle in large masses. After  long rains and after winter frosts the cohesion between the waste  and the sound rock beneath is loosened by seeping water  underground. The waste slips on the rock surface thus lubricated  and plunges down the mountain side in a swift roaring torrent of  mud and stones.    We may conveniently mention here a second type of landslide, where  masses of solid rock as well as the mantle of waste are involved  in the sudden movement. Such slips occur when valleys have been  rapidly deepened by streams or glaciers and their sides have not  yet been graded. A favorable condition is where the strata dip  (i.e. incline downwards) towards the valley (Fig. 11), or are  broken by joint planes dipping in the same direction. The upper  layers, including perhaps the entire mountain side, have been cut  across by the valley trench and are left supported only on the  inclined surface of the underlying rocks. Water may percolate  underground along this surface and loosen the cohesion between the  upper and the underlying strata by converting the upper surface of  a shale to soft wet clay, by dissolving layers of a limestone, or  by removing the cement of a sandstone and converting it into loose  sand. When the inclined surface is thus lubricated the overlying  masses may be launched into the valley below. The solid rocks are  broken and crushed in sliding and converted into waste consisting,  like that of talus, of angular unsorted fragments, blocks of all  sizes being mingled pellmell with rock meal and dust. The  principal effects of landslides may be gathered from the following  examples.    At Gohna, India, in 1893, the face of a spur four thousand feet  high, of the lower ranges of the Himalayas, slipped into the gorge  of the headwaters of the Ganges River in successive rock falls  which lasted for three days. Blocks of stone were projected for a  mile, and clouds of limestone dust were spread over the  surrounding country. The debris formed a dam one thousand feet  high, extending for two miles along the valley. A lake gathered  behind this barrier, gradually rising until it overtopped it in a  little less than a year. The upper portion of the dam then broke,  and a terrific rush of water swept down the valley in a wave  which, twenty miles away, rose one hundred and sixty feet in  height. A narrow lake is still held by the strong base of the dam.    In 1896, after forty days of incessant rain, a cliff of sandstone  slipped into the Yangtse River in China, reducing the width of the  channel to eighty yards and causing formidable rapids.    At Flims, in Switzerland, a prehistoric landslip flung a dam  eighteen hundred feet high across the headwaters of the Rhine. If  spread evenly over a surface of twenty-eight square miles, the  material would cover it to a depth of six hundred and sixty feet.  The barrier is not yet entirely cut away, and several lakes are  held in shallow basins on its hummocky surface.    A slide from the precipitous river front of the citadel hill of  Quebec, in 1889, dashed across Champlain Street, wrecking a number  of houses and causing the death of forty-five persons. The strata  here are composed of steeply dipping slate.    In lofty mountain ranges there may not be a single valley without  its traces of landslides, so common there is this method of the  movement of waste, and of building to grade over-steepened slopes.    ROCK SCULPTURE BY WEATHERING    We are now to consider a few of the forms into which rock masses  are carved by the weather.    BOWLDERS OF WEATHERING. In many quarries and outcrops we may see  that the blocks into which one or more of the uppermost layers  have been broken along their joints and bedding planes are no  longer angular, as are those of the layers below. The edges and  corners of these blocks have been worn away by the weather. Such  rounded cores, known as bowlders of weathering, are often left to  strew the surface.    DIFFERENTIAL WEATHERING. This term covers all cases in which a  rock mass weathers differently in different portions. Any weaker  spots or layers are etched out on the surface, leaving the more  resistant in relief. Thus massive limestones become pitted where  the weather drills out the weaker portions. In these pits, when  once they are formed, moisture gathers, a little soil collects,  vegetation takes root, and thus they are further enlarged until  the limestone may be deeply honeycombed.    On the sides of canyons, and elsewhere where the edges of strata  are exposed, the harder layers project as cliffs, while the softer  weather back to slopes covered with the talus of the harder layers  above them. It is convenient to call the former cliff makers and  the latter slope makers.    Differential weathering plays a large part in the sculpture of the  land. Areas of weak rock are wasted to plains, while areas of hard  rock adjacent are still left as hills and mountain ridges, as in  the valleys and mountains of eastern Pennsylvania. But in such  instances the lowering of the surface of the weaker rock is also  due to the wear of streams, and especially to the removal by them  from the land of the waste which covers and protects the rocks  beneath.    Rocks owe their weakness to several different causes. Some, such  as beds of loose sand, are soft and easily worn by rains; some, as  limestone and gypsum for example, are soluble. Even hard insoluble  rocks are weak under the attack of the weather when they are  closely divided by joints and bedding planes and are thus readily  broken up into blocks by mechanical agencies.    OUTLIERS AND MONUMENTS. As cliffs retreat under the attack of the  weather, portions are left behind where the rock is more resistant  or where the attack for any reason is less severe. Such remnant  masses, if large, are known as outliers. When    Note the rain furrows on the slope at the foot of the monuments.  In the foreground are seen fragments of petrified trunks of trees,  composed of silica and extremely resistant to the weather. On the  removal of the rock layers in which these fragments were imbedded  they are left to strew the surface in the same way as are the  residual flints of southern Missouri. flat-topped, because of the  protection of a resistant horizontal capping layer, they are  termed mesas,--a term applied also to the flat-topped portions of  dissected plateaus (Fig. 129). Retreating cliffs may fall back a  number of miles behind their outliers before the latter are  finally consumed.    Monuments are smaller masses and may be but partially detached  from the cliff face. In the breaking down of sheets of horizontal  strata, outliers grow smaller and smaller and are reduced to  massive rectangular monuments resembling castles (Fig. 17). The  rock castle falls into ruin, leaving here and there an isolated  tower; the tower crumbles to a lonely pillar, soon to be  overthrown. The various and often picturesque shapes of monuments  depend on the kind of rock, the attitude of the strata, and the  agent by which they are chiefly carved. Thus pillars may have a  capital formed of a resistant stratum. Monuments may be undercut  and come to rest on narrow pedestals, wherever they weather more  rapidly near the ground, either because of the greater moisture  there, or--in arid climates--because worn at their base by  drifting sands.    Stony clays disintegrating under the rain often contain bowlders  which protect the softer material beneath from the vertical blows  of raindrops, and thus come to stand on pedestals of some height.  One may sometimes see on the ground beneath dripping eaves pebbles  left in the same way, protecting tiny pedestals of sand.    MOUNTAIN PEAKS AND RIDGES. Most mountains have been carved out of  great broadly uplifted folds and blocks of the earth's crust.  Running water and glacier ice have cut these folds and blocks into  masses divided by deep valleys; but it is by the weather, for the  most part, that the masses thus separated have been sculptured to  the present forms of the individual peaks and ridges.    Frost and heat and cold sculpture high mountains to sharp,  tusklike peaks and ragged, serrate crests, where their waste is  readily removed.    The Matterhorn of the Alps is a famous example of a mountain peak  whose carving by the frost and other agents is in active progress.  On its face \"scarcely a rock anywhere is firmly attached,\" and the  fall of loosened stones is incessant. Mountain climbers who have  camped at its base tell how huge rocks from time to time come  leaping down its precipices, followed by trains of dislodged  smaller fragments and rock dust; and how at night one may trace  the course of the bowlders by the sparks which they strike"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/421"],[0,"Kidnapped (#6)"],[1,"of a night it  is, I'll get it out to ye and call ye in again.\"    I did his will, smiling to myself in my contempt that he should think I  was so easily to be deceived. It was a dark night, with a few stars low  down; and as I stood just outside the door, I heard a hollow moaning  of wind far off among the hills. I said to myself there was something  thundery and changeful in the weather, and little knew of what a vast  importance that should prove to me before the evening passed.    When I was called in again, my uncle counted out into my hand seven and  thirty golden guinea pieces; the rest was in his hand, in small gold and  silver; but his heart failed him there, and he crammed the change into  his pocket.    \"There,\" said he, \"that'll show you! I'm a queer man, and strange wi'  strangers; but my word is my bond, and there's the proof of it.\"    Now, my uncle seemed so miserly that I was struck dumb by this sudden  generosity, and could find no words in which to thank him.    \"No a word!\" said he. \"Nae thanks; I want nae thanks. I do my duty. I'm  no saying that everybody would have done it; but for my part (though  I'm a careful body, too) it's a pleasure to me to do the right by my  brother's son; and it's a pleasure to me to think that now we'll agree  as such near friends should.\"    I spoke him in return as handsomely as I was able; but all the while  I was wondering what would come next, and why he had parted with his  precious guineas; for as to the reason he had given, a baby would have  refused it.    Presently he looked towards me sideways.    \"And see here,\" says he, \"tit for tat.\"    I told him I was ready to prove my gratitude in any reasonable degree,  and then waited, looking for some monstrous demand. And yet, when  at last he plucked up courage to speak, it was only to tell me (very  properly, as I thought) that he was growing old and a little broken, and  that he would expect me to help him with the house and the bit garden.    I answered, and expressed my readiness to serve.    \"Well,\" he said, \"let's begin.\" He pulled out of his pocket a rusty key.  \"There,\" says he, \"there's the key of the stair-tower at the far end of  the house. Ye can only win into it from the outside, for that part of  the house is no finished. Gang ye in there, and up the stairs, and bring  me down the chest that's at the top. There's papers in't,\" he added.    \"Can I have a light, sir?\" said I.    \"Na,\" said he, very cunningly. \"Nae lights in my house.\"    \"Very well, sir,\" said I. \"Are the stairs good?\"    \"They're grand,\" said he; and then, as I was going, \"Keep to the wall,\"  he added; \"there's nae bannisters. But the stairs are grand underfoot.\"    Out I went into the night. The wind was still moaning in the distance,  though never a breath of it came near the house of Shaws. It had fallen  blacker than ever; and I was glad to feel along the wall, till I came  the length of the stairtower door at the far end of the unfinished wing.  I had got the key into the keyhole and had just turned it, when all upon  a sudden, without sound of wind or thunder, the whole sky lighted up  with wild fire and went black again. I had to put my hand over my eyes  to get back to the colour of the darkness; and indeed I was already half  blinded when I stepped into the tower.    It was so dark inside, it seemed a body could scarce breathe; but I  pushed out with foot and hand, and presently struck the wall with the  one, and the lowermost round of the stair with the other. The wall, by  the touch, was of fine hewn stone; the steps too, though somewhat steep  and narrow, were of polished masonwork, and regular and solid underfoot.  Minding my uncle's word about the bannisters, I kept close to the tower  side, and felt my way in the pitch darkness with a beating heart.    The house of Shaws stood some five full storeys high, not counting  lofts. Well, as I advanced, it seemed to me the stair grew airier and a  thought more lightsome; and I was wondering what might be the cause of  this change, when a second blink of the summer lightning came and went.  If I did not cry out, it was because fear had me by the throat; and if I  did not fall, it was more by Heaven's mercy than my own strength. It was  not only that the flash shone in on every side through breaches in the  wall, so that I seemed to be clambering aloft upon an open scaffold, but  the same passing brightness showed me the steps were of unequal length,  and that one of my feet rested that moment within two inches of the  well.    This was the grand stair! I thought; and with the thought, a gust of  a kind of angry courage came into my heart. My uncle had sent me here,  certainly to run great risks, perhaps to die. I swore I would settle  that \"perhaps,\" if I should break my neck for it; got me down upon my  hands and knees; and as slowly as a snail, feeling before me every  inch, and testing the solidity of every stone, I continued to ascend  the stair. The darkness, by contrast with the flash, appeared to have  redoubled; nor was that all, for my ears were now troubled and my mind  confounded by a great stir of bats in the top part of the tower, and the  foul beasts, flying downwards, sometimes beat about my face and body.    The tower, I should have said, was square; and in every corner the step  was made of a great stone of a different shape to join the flights.  Well, I had come close to one of these turns, when, feeling forward  as usual, my hand slipped upon an edge and found nothing but emptiness  beyond it. The stair had been carried no higher; to set a stranger  mounting it in the darkness was to send him straight to his death; and  (although, thanks to the lightning and my own precautions, I was safe  enough) the mere thought of the peril in which I might have stood, and  the dreadful height I might have fallen from, brought out the sweat upon  my body and relaxed my joints.    But I knew what I wanted now, and turned and groped my way down again,  with a wonderful anger in my heart. About half-way down, the wind sprang  up in a clap and shook the tower, and died again; the rain followed; and  before I had reached the ground level it fell in buckets. I put out my  head into the storm, and looked along towards the kitchen. The door,  which I had shut behind me when I left, now stood open, and shed a  little glimmer of light; and I thought I could see a figure standing  in the rain, quite still, like a man hearkening. And then there came  a blinding flash, which showed me my uncle plainly, just where I had  fancied him to stand; and hard upon the heels of it, a great tow-row of  thunder.    Now, whether my uncle thought the crash to be the sound of my fall, or  whether he heard in it God's voice denouncing murder, I will leave you  to guess. Certain it is, at least, that he was seized on by a kind of  panic fear, and that he ran into the house and left the door open behind  him. I followed as softly as I could, and, coming unheard into the  kitchen, stood and watched him.    He had found time to open the corner cupboard and bring out a great case  bottle of aqua vitae, and now sat with his back towards me at the table.  Ever and again he would be seized with a fit of deadly shuddering and  groan aloud, and carrying the bottle to his lips, drink down the raw  spirits by the mouthful.    I stepped forward, came close behind him where he sat, and suddenly  clapping my two hands down upon his shoulders--\"Ah!\" cried I.    My uncle gave a kind of broken cry like a sheep's bleat, flung up his  arms, and tumbled to the floor like a dead man. I was somewhat shocked  at this; but I had myself to look to first of all, and did not hesitate  to let him lie as he had fallen. The keys were hanging in the cupboard;  and it was my design to furnish myself with arms before my uncle should  come again to his senses and the power of devising evil. In the cupboard  were a few bottles, some apparently of medicine; a great many bills and  other papers, which I should willingly enough have rummaged, had I had  the time; and a few necessaries that were nothing to my purpose. Thence  I turned to the chests. The first was full of meal; the second of  moneybags and papers tied into sheaves; in the third, with many  other things (and these for the most part clothes) I found a rusty,  ugly-looking Highland dirk without the scabbard. This, then, I concealed  inside my waistcoat, and turned to my uncle.    He lay as he had fallen, all huddled, with one knee up and one arm  sprawling abroad; his face had a strange colour of blue, and he seemed  to have ceased breathing. Fear came on me that he was dead; then I  got water and dashed it in his face; and with that he seemed to come a  little to himself, working his mouth and fluttering his eyelids. At last  he looked up and saw me, and there came into his eyes a terror that was  not of this world.    \"Come, come,\" said I; \"sit up.\"    \"Are ye alive?\" he sobbed. \"O man, are ye alive?\"    \"That am I,\" said I. \"Small thanks to you!\"    He had begun to seek for his breath with deep sighs. \"The blue phial,\"  said he--\"in the aumry--the blue phial.\" His breath came slower still.    I ran to the cupboard, and, sure enough, found there a blue phial  of medicine, with the dose written on it on a paper, and this I  administered to him with what speed I might.    \"It's the trouble,\" said he, reviving a little; \"I have a trouble,  Davie. It's the heart.\"    I set him on a chair and looked at him. It is true I felt some pity for  a man that looked so sick, but I was full besides of righteous anger;  and I numbered over before him the points on which I wanted explanation:  why he lied to me at every word; why he feared that I should leave him;  why he disliked it to be hinted that he and my father were twins--\"Is  that because it is true?\" I asked; why he had given me money to which I  was convinced I had no claim; and, last of all, why he had tried to kill  "]]]
