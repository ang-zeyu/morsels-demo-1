Those interests, I  contend, authorise the subjection of individual spontaneity to external  control, only in respect to those actions of each, which concern the  interest of other people. If any one does an act hurtful to others,  there is a _prima facie_ case for punishing him, by law, or, where legal  penalties are not safely applicable, by general disapprobation. There  are also many positive acts for the benefit of others, which he may  rightfully be compelled to perform; such as, to give evidence in a court  of justice; to bear his fair share in the common defence, or in any  other joint work necessary to the interest of the society of which he  enjoys the protection; and to perform certain acts of individual  beneficence, such as saving a fellow-creature's life, or interposing to  protect the defenceless against ill-usage, things which whenever it is  obviously a man's duty to do, he may rightfully be made responsible to  society for not doing. A person may cause evil to others not only by his  actions but by his inaction, and in either case he is justly accountable  to them for the injury. The latter case, it is true, requires a much  more cautious exercise of compulsion than the former. To make any one  answerable for doing evil to others, is the rule; to make him answerable  for not preventing evil, is, comparatively speaking, the exception. Yet  there are many cases clear enough and grave enough to justify that  exception. In all things which regard the external relations of the  individual, he is _de jure_ amenable to those whose interests are  concerned, and if need be, to society as their protector. There are  often good reasons for not holding him to the responsibility; but these  reasons must arise from the special expediencies of the case: either  because it is a kind of case in which he is on the whole likely to act  better, when left to his own discretion, than when controlled in any way  in which society have it in their power to control him; or because the  attempt to exercise control would produce other evils, greater than  those which it would prevent. When such reasons as these preclude the  enforcement of responsibility, the conscience of the agent himself  should step into the vacant judgment seat, and protect those interests  of others which have no external protection; judging himself all the  more rigidly, because the case does not admit of his being made  accountable to the judgment of his fellow-creatures.    But there is a sphere of action in which society, as distinguished from  the individual, has, if any, only an indirect interest; comprehending  all that portion of a person's life and conduct which affects only  himself, or if it also affects others, only with their free, voluntary,  and undeceived consent and participation. When I say only himself, I  mean directly, and in the first instance: for whatever affects himself,  may affect others _through_ himself; and the objection which may be  grounded on this contingency, will receive consideration in the sequel.  This, then, is the appropriate region of human liberty. It comprises,  first, the inward domain of consciousness; demanding liberty of  conscience, in the most comprehensive sense; liberty of thought and  feeling; absolute freedom of opinion and sentiment on all subjects,  practical or speculative, scientific, moral, or theological. The liberty  of expressing and publishing opinions may seem to fall under a different  principle, since it belongs to that part of the conduct of an individual  which concerns other people; but, being almost of as much importance as  the liberty of thought itself, and resting in great part on the same  reasons, is practically inseparable from it. Secondly, the principle  requires liberty of tastes and pursuits; of framing the plan of our life  to suit our own character; of doing as we like, subject to such  consequences as may follow: without impediment from our  fellow-creatures, so long as what we do does not harm them, even though  they should think our conduct foolish, perverse, or wrong. Thirdly, from  this liberty of each individual, follows the liberty, within the same  limits, of combination among individuals; freedom to unite, for any  purpose not involving harm to others: the persons combining being  supposed to be of full age, and not forced or deceived.    No society in which these liberties are not, on the whole, respected, is  free, whatever may be its form of government; and none is completely  free in which they do not exist absolute and unqualified. The only  freedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our  own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or  impede their efforts to obtain it. Each is the proper guardian of his  own health, whether bodily, or mental and spiritual. Mankind are greater  gainers by suffering each other to live as seems good to themselves,  than by compelling each to live as seems good to the rest.    Though this doctrine is anything but new, and, to some persons, may have  the air of a truism, there is no doctrine which stands more directly  opposed to the general tendency of existing opinion and practice.  Society has expended fully as much effort in the attempt (according to  its lights) to compel people to conform to its notions of personal, as  of social excellence. The ancient commonwealths thought themselves  entitled to practise, and the ancient philosophers countenanced, the  regulation of every part of private conduct by public authority, on the  ground that the State had a deep interest in the whole bodily and mental  discipline of every one of its citizens; a mode of thinking which may  have been admissible in small republics surrounded by powerful enemies,  in constant peril of being subverted by foreign attack or internal  commotion, and to which even a short interval of relaxed energy and  self-command might so easily be fatal, that they could not afford to  wait for the salutary permanent effects of freedom. In the modern world,  the greater size of political communities, and above all, the separation  between spiritual and temporal authority (which placed the direction of  men's consciences in other hands than those which controlled their  worldly affairs), prevented so great an interference by law in the  details of private life; but the engines of moral repression have been  wielded more strenuously against divergence from the reigning opinion in  self-regarding, than even in social matters; religion, the most powerful  of the elements which have entered into the formation of moral feeling,  having almost always been governed either by the ambition of a  hierarchy, seeking control over every department of human conduct, or by  the spirit of Puritanism. And some of those modern reformers who have  placed themselves in strongest opposition to the religions of the past,  have been noway behind either churches or sects in their assertion of  the right of spiritual domination: M. Comte, in particular, whose social  system, as unfolded in his _Traite de Politique Positive_, aims at  establishing (though by moral more than by legal appliances) a despotism  of society over the individual, surpassing anything contemplated in the  political ideal of the most rigid disciplinarian among the ancient  philosophers.    Apart from the peculiar tenets of individual thinkers, there is also in  the world at large an increasing inclination to stretch unduly the  powers of society over the individual, both by the force of opinion and  even by that of legislation: and as the tendency of all the changes  taking place in the world is to strengthen society, and diminish the  power of the individual, this encroachment is not one of the evils which  tend spontaneously to disappear, but, on the contrary, to grow more and  more formidable. The disposition of mankind, whether as rulers or as  fellow-citizens to impose their own opinions and inclinations as a rule  of conduct on others, is so energetically supported by some of the best  and by some of the worst feelings incident to human nature, that it is  hardly ever kept under restraint by anything but want of power; and as  the power is not declining, but growing, unless a strong barrier of  moral conviction can be raised against the mischief, we must expect, in  the present circumstances of the world, to see it increase.    It will be convenient for the argument, if, instead of at once entering  upon the general thesis, we confine ourselves in the first instance to a  single branch of it, on which the principle here stated is, if not  fully, yet to a certain point, recognised by the current opinions. This  one branch is the Liberty of Thought: from which it is impossible to  separate the cognate liberty of speaking and of writing. Although these  liberties, to some considerable amount, form part of the political  morality of all countries which profess religious toleration and free  institutions, the grounds, both philosophical and practical, on which  they rest, are perhaps not so familiar to the general mind, nor so  thoroughly appreciated by many even of the leaders of opinion, as might  have been expected. Those grounds, when rightly understood, are of much  wider application than to only one division of the subject, and a  thorough consideration of this part of the question will be found the  best introduction to the remainder. Those to whom nothing which I am  about to say will be new, may therefore, I hope, excuse me, if on a  subject which for now three centuries has been so often discussed, I  venture on one discussion more.          CHAPTER II.    OF THE LIBERTY OF THOUGHT AND DISCUSSION.

The usual cap with folded brim had a loose crown, and  we find this began to lengthen and fall over to one side in the 11th  century, and continued to elongate till, in the 15th century, it often  dropped to the knee in a long thin point. In the 14th century it took a  fullness of loose folds, with serrated or foliated edges falling to the  shoulder as in Fig. 15 (see p. 73). A close helmet-shaped cap is seen in  the 12th century, with a falling point from the crown, and the 13th  century brought in the higher crowned hat, with a long peaked front,  turned up at the back. Feathers were worn at the front, back, or side of  hats, and sometimes on the front of the hoods; these increased  their dimensions in height and peak, till the straight-up high hat,  which was often brimless, came in the 15th century. The early hood or  cowl soon began to vary its design, for in the 13th century it was often  a part of, or attached to, a chasuble shape falling back and front, or  with the long front, stopping at a short cape length behind. A note of  interest in the 14th century appears, where the forehead part of the  hood is turned up, showing a coloured lining, and at times the  fashionable serrated edge surrounding the face is seen.    [Illustration: FIG. 14.        _13th century_      _14th century_      _15th century_]    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Fourteenth century.]    [Illustration: Plate VI.--        (_a_) Collar and Cuffs set with Lace. 1600-30.

Embroidered Linen. 1625-50.]    [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Twelfth to thirteenth century.]    The chasuble-shaped garment was a feature often worn over the coat until  the end of the 15th century, and was generally worn long with the  elongated fashion of the 14th century, and short with the shorter tunics  of the 15th century. They are found very wide in the 14th century, and  so fall well down over the shoulder, where they are often laced a short  distance up, creating an interesting feature. Cloaks were not so much in  favour with the heavier cowl and cape, but they were used, fastened by  brooches to either shoulder rather at the back, after the 12th century.    [Illustration: FIG. 17.--Fourteenth century.]    A very tight-fitting suit called Justacorps came into use from the  12th century, and developed a padded round-shaped body towards the end  of the 14th century; the closely-cut body was buttoned up to the throat,  or was set with a high collar for the first time. The tights came over  it, sometimes rather high up the waist, being laced to it. A long tunic  was chiefly favoured during the 10th and 11th centuries with short or  long cuffless sleeves, and a full bell-shaped falling sleeve showed a  close-fitting under one.    These tunics were chiefly open at the neck as in the earlier times,  though a slight difference to be noted is a =V=-shaped opening in the 14th  century, which is developed in the 15th century; they were also split up  the sides, even to the hips. Some were very full in shape, and were  gathered to either side as in the illustration; others had the body  closely fitted and full only in the skirt, but as a rule one finds this  latter shape only reaches just below the knee. They were often tucked  into the belt in front, showing a rich underskirt.    A girdle (besides a belt) was worn on the hips with the longer tunics,  as in Fig. 28 (see p. 94), the dagger and pouch being carried in front  on the girdle, and not the belt. A small dagger was often slung at the  back or front of the neck, as an ornament at the end of the 14th  century.    [Illustration: FIG. 18.--Fourteenth century.]    Tights to the waist were worn with both long and short tunics, and  retained the crossed binding up the legs to the 13th century, in the  various designs of page 53. Parti-coloured tights came in with the 14th  century, carrying out the heraldic character of dress, and this may be  found till about 1530. A sandal shoe was much worn up to the 12th  century, with strappings to various heights up the leg, this even over  the short top-boots, but the usual shoe opened down the front of the  instep to the toe, which was rather pointed in shape, and it was curved  or square at the ankle. The illustration gives a good variety of the  prevalent forms. The stocking-boot is also another characteristic of  this earlier time, as well as the commoners' woollen gaiters, worn as in  Fig. 30, on the seated figure, which were in use to the middle of the  16th century.    [Illustration: FIG. 19.--Twelfth and thirteenth centuries.]    In the illustrations which show no shoe on the tights, it will be  understood that a sole of leather was sewn on to the under part of the  foot. This practice is even seen to-day on the Continent, where the  clog is mostly in use. A soft boot, reaching to the calf, was worn till  the 15th century, with the top folded or trimmed with fur, the latter  being generally laced down the front, even to the instep: the shape of  these only varied in the length of the pointed toes as the style  developed.    The long-pointed shoes began to increase all through the 13th century,  and in the 14th century they reached their greatest length, when the  points were often tied up to a garter just below the knee. Wooden clogs  were much used, and were often considerably raised. Iron circular  supports were also in use at the end of this time; these were the  foretaste of the eccentric chopins of the 16th century, which were more  favoured on the Continent than here. The pointed toes also were made to  curl outwards, giving a splay-footed effect, late in the 14th century.    [Illustration: FIG. 20.--Fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.]          CHAPTER IV      FIFTEENTH CENTURY. FEMALE.    We have now arrived at the height of eccentric fashion in mediaeval  head-dress. The hornlike creations, studded with jewels, and peaks of  wondrous height, both draped with fine muslins and often completely  shutting away the hair from sight, had a supporting cap which mostly  came over ears and cheeks, and a clutch is seen on the forehead, at  times concealed by a jewel. The hair was generally allowed to fall loose  under the back drape, or a long plait is sometimes seen at the back with  the first-named head-dress. The back drape setting from the brow down  the back was well conceived to balance the high spire, but it seems to  have been discarded during the reign of Edward V, and light veil falls  were worn which often came half over the face. In Henry VII's time the  extreme fashion came in the shape of a closely-fitting curved cap,  with a fall of material over the back. The ermine-trimmed jacket was  still in favour to the middle of the last-named reign, when it was worn  low down over the hips.    [Illustration: FIG. 21.--Fifteenth century, 1st half.]    [Illustration: FIG. 22.--Middle of fifteenth century to sixteenth  century.]    [Illustration: Plate VII.--        (_a_) Herald's Coat.

It was wide on the  shoulder, and seems to have been stiffened to set out; the =V= shape was  generally filled in with velvet, and a very wide band encircled the  waist; a girdle is occasionally noted. The keys' pocket and other  requisites were generally carried on the underskirt during these times.  The skirt was full and gathered to the back in a train, the gathers  often running into the bodice; a very wide border is prevalent, even to  the middle of the thigh. Tight sleeves are usual, and hanging sleeves  were worn, mostly set in a very short sleeve, which assume a puff-shape  in Henry VII's reign; long cuffs, almost covering the hand, are seen on  many sleeves.    [Illustration: FIG. 24.--Fifteenth century, 2nd half.]    [Illustration: FIG. 25.--Fifteenth century, 2nd half.]    [Illustration: Plate VIII.--(_a_) (_b_) (_c_) Three Suits. Period  Charles II.]    [Illustration: FIG. 26.--End of fifteenth century.]    Modes of opening the skirt up to the hips occasionally showed  themselves, and even the sides to the hips are seen laced. In the  earlier dress, about 1485, the neck setting of dress became very  square, and was filled with fine-drawn lawn. The square shape rises in a  curved centre before the end of this period, and a close-fitting robe  was worn with a girdle, often opened up the sides. The short upper  sleeve and full outer sleeve so much in vogue gave place to a divided  upper and lower sleeve, laced or tied with ribbon, with puffs of lawn  pulled through the openings at shoulder and elbow, and down the back of  the forearm. Slashes are now seen in most sleeves, and an Italianesque  character pervaded the fashion.    High, soft boots and shoes of a similar shape to the male description  were worn, and changed when the square-toe shoes came in.    Through this period there are many interesting details of costume to  study, while gilt tags, finishing laces, and ribbons are to be remarked  from this period.      FIFTEENTH CENTURY. MALE.    [Illustration: FIG. 27.--Fifteenth century.]    [Illustration: FIG. 28.--Fifteenth century, 1st half.]    [Illustration: FIG. 29.--Middle of fifteenth century.]    The chief shapes to mark in this century in male head-dress is the  increased height of the tall hats which rise to vie with the female  fashions. We still see a round hat with a rolled edge and long fall  over one side, besides shorter folds in the crown, both scalloped or  foliated at the edge, and this shape may be noted till about 1460.
