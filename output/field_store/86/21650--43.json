Study of her cases showed that there was report of previous  mendacity, four had been liars from childhood.  She found in them  the combination of the general habit of lying underneath the more  accentuated form of pseudologia phantastica.  One case had  perverted sex feeling, one was a prostitute at sixteen years.    In her dissertation some points for the differentiation of the  pathological lie have been added to those offered by Delbruck,  Risch, Koppen, and Vogt.  The pathological liar lies, not  according to a plan, but the impulse seizes him suddenly.  This  propensity grows stronger.  Under strict supervision it comes to  only an abortive attack, similar to what happens in cases of  dipsomania, or of tendency to rove in which the repressed  outbreak expresses itself in tormenting psychical and physical  unrest.  While the normal liar and swindler is forced to be on  his guard lest he divulge something of the actual state of  affairs, and is therefore either taciturn or presents an evil and  watchful appearance, or, if a novice at his trade, is hesitating  in his replies, the pathological liar has a cheerful, open, free,  enthusiastic, charming appearance, because he believes in his  stories and wishes their reality.  The inconsequential way in  which such persons go to work is to be explained by the fact that  consciousness of the real situation is partly clouded in their  minds.  In any special act it is impossible to say whether the  consciousness of the lie, fancy, or delusion preponderates.  Inability to remember delinquencies Stemmermann regards also as  added proof of pathological lying.    She speaks of another class of prattlers, chattering people that  might be confounded with pathological liars from the stories they  tell in full detail.  But they have no system which they develop,  often change their subject and do not paint in a lifelike way  because they do not believe their own stories or live in them in  a self-centered manner.    Of the 17 cases Stemmermann studied from the literature  (Delbruck, Hinrichsen, Jorger, Redlich, Koelle, Henneberg ,  Wellenbergh) 10 were periodic.  Of her own 10 cases, 6 were  periodic.  Sex abnormalities were present in 5 out of the 17 in  the literature.  Among possible causes of pathological lying she  places any factor which narrows consciousness and increases  suggestion and weakness, such as pregnancy, overexertion, chronic  alcoholism, monotonous living, long, close work, head injuries.    Concerning prognosis she finds little detailed in the literature.  The general opinion is that such cases arising from a background  of degeneracy are incurable.  One of her cases was free from  attacks for two periods of three years each, and had been  blameless in an honorable position as editor for seven years at  the time of the publication of her monograph.  She suggests that  the profession he has chosen may be particularly suited to the  talents of the pathological liar.  She also ventures to state  that where pathological lying is merely an accompaniment of  puberty it may disappear.    The fact that so many of the cases cited by Stemmermann were  clearly abnormal and found places in insane asylums makes much  citation of them by us, in turn, hardly worth while.  However, a  short summary of a couple of her more normal cases will show the  problems and conditions as she found them.  I. Annie J., 19 years  old, father a tailor, had been employed in several places as a  servant.  Aside from the fact that it was stated she always had  an inclination to lie, nothing more was known about her early  life.  She complained of headaches and fainting attacks, and  mourned over the death of her fiance.  She said he had gone to  Berlin to learn tailoring and had died there of inflammation of  the lungs.  He left her 650 marks which her mother got hold of.  On investigation it was found that this man was still alive and  never had been engaged to her.  She then accused her mother of  taking 50 marks from her and said that a man, purporting to be  her real father, came from another town and told her she had been  brought up by foster parents.  Through the quarreling which arose  from these various stories Annie was taken before the police  physician and pronounced mentally unsound.  Then she told of  another engagement with the brother of her departed fiance, who  had discovered her real mother.  The latter was going to leave  her 30,000 marks.  He had formed a plot with the foster mother to  put Annie out of the way and to divide the money.  He followed  her on the street and threw a drugged cloth over her head.  She  fainted and was carried home.  She said she brought action for  attempt to murder.  (Whether this fiance and the rich mother were  real persons is not known.)  Later in the same year, Annie being  again at large, a new father, der Graf von Woldau, appeared and  bought her beautiful clothes costing 100 marks.  He wanted to  take her away, but quickly disappeared and was not seen again.  When Annie told this story she was employed by a woman who  attempted to get traces of the count, but failed.  Later this  employer missed a sum of money equivalent to that spent for the  clothes.  Annie's responsibility by this time was still more  questioned and she was sent to an insane asylum.  There she was  found normally oriented, orderly, industrious, but suffered from  periodical headaches.  When questioned in the asylum concerning  her tales she hesitated and would say, ``Now I believe them and  now I don't.''  It is remarkable in this case that her different  employers believed all her fabrications and took the girl's part  against the supposed offenders.  For a year she engaged in a sort  of orgy of pathological lying and then this phase of her career  stopped.  After a few months in the asylum she returned home and  later married.  The last report from her mother was that she was  nervous and easily excited, but showed no further signs of  insanity.    II. This was a boy, Johann P., who was studied mentally first  when he was 16 years old.  A thoroughly good history was  forthcoming.  He was brought for examination on account of his  extreme changeableness, his failure in several occupations, his  tendencies to swindling and his extreme lying.  As a young child  his mother had to correct him much for prevarications.  Soon  after he was 9, when both his parents were already dead, he  forged a school certificate and was felt to be a bad influence in  the home of his guardian.  About that time he also stole money  from pockets on a number of occasions.  In school he was regarded  as an undesirable pupil on account of his underhanded behavior,  and one teacher who had observed him for long wrote that he  showed marked inclination towards lying.  At the time he was 15,  he was somewhat retarded in school life, but was told he had to  decide upon an occupation.  After a stormy period he announced he  would become a gardener.  After doing well for a month or so at  his first place he began to tell compromising stories about the  wife of his employer.  He gave himself out to be the son of a  general who was going to inherit a large sum of money.  On the  strength of this he managed to get hold of expensive articles he  desired.  A short time afterward he wrote to his guardian he was  fitted for higher pursuits than that of gardening.  Soon  afterward he ran away to a large town.  He now wrote that the  word freedom sounded like the sweetest music in his ears.  He  acknowledged that he had started on a career of criminality, but  decided to do better.  At this time he attempted to make his way  by offering his compositions at a newspaper office where they  were declined either because his productions were immature or his  authorship was doubted.  One editor loaned him some money, but he  got much more by representing himself to be a collaborator of  this editor.  He soon failed to make his way and attempted other  things, including entrance into the merchant marine.  He finally  turned up again at his guardian's house, and when his box was  opened it was found to contain a very curious lot of material  such as money accounts, business cards, letter heads, catalogues.  It was at this time that he was placed for observation in an  asylum and it was soon found that his alleged compositions were  plagiarized.  He claimed to suffer from headaches.  Outside of  that he was in fine physical condition.  He frequently wrote  sketches in proof of his ability.  A general statement was  finally made that he showed slight traces of hysteria, was a  sufferer from headaches, and showed periodic tendencies to  wandering and lying.  No special defect in the ethical  discriminations was present.  He had good insight into his own  tendencies.  He was finally released to his guardian, and  Stemmermann offered the prognosis that Johann might well develop  into a typical pathological swindler.  He came of a family of  five brothers and sisters, one of whom was incarcerated for a  year on account of stealing.  One sister was noted for her  tendency to prevarication.  Several of them were remarkably  unstable, at least early in life.  All of them are said to have  learned very unwillingly in school.  One brother of the father  was exceedingly nervous.    Jorger[15] presents a case of a boy of poor parents who was from  childhood possessed of the idea of becoming a teacher.  He was  always a solitary child, endowed with great religious fervor.  In  spite of poverty he obtained an education, studied the classics,  and did excellent work.  He developed early religious  eccentricities, became unsound on money matters, boasted of his  father's millions, spent freely as a benefactor, bought expensive  books.  Then developed an outspoken tendency to swindling.  Finally he was adjudged insane and committed to an asylum.  Commenting on this case, Jorger points out the marks of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44941"],[0,"The Government of God (#6)"],[1,"Leroux, and Proudhon,  in Europe, and Fanny Wright in America. The leading object of many of  these people is to have a community of goods and property. Some of them  discard Christianity altogether, and others leave every one to do as  they please; others attach a little importance to it. I would briefly  remark on the first of those, that if scepticism is to be the basis  of the happiness of man, we shall be in a poor situation to improve  the world. It is practical infidelity that has placed the world in its  present position; how far the unblushing profession of it will lead  to restoration and happiness, I must leave my readers to judge. It is  our departure from God, that has brought upon us all our misery. It  is not a very reasonable way to alleviate it by confirming mankind in  scepticism. I am aware that there is much in the world to induce doubt,  and uncertainty on religious affairs, and religious professors have  much to answer for; but there is a very material difference between  the religion of God, and our Lord Jesus Christ, and that of those who  profess His name.    As regards Communism, in the abstract, or on the voluntary principle,  we will examine that briefly. Pick out a number of men in Paris,  London, Berlin, or any other city, associated with all the evils and  corruptions of those cities, and organize them into a community. Will  the mere removal of them from one place to another make them better?  Certainly not. If they were corrupt before, they will be after their  removal; and if they were unhappy before, they will be after. This  temporary change will not make a difference; for men in possession  of different religious, and political, and moral views, never can  be united in harmony. The difficulties that exist in the world on a  large scale, would exist there in miniature; and though prudence,  forbearance, and policy, in smaller circles, might operate for a time,  the evils would still exist; and though they might smoulder and be pent  up, like a volcano, they would only rage with greater fury when they  did burst out.    I have conversed with some who seem to think that all that is necessary  to promote the happiness of man, is, that he have sufficient to eat and  drink, and that through this means it would be obtained. I grant that  the comforts and happiness of men are in a great measure augmented by  these things; but to place them as the root and foundation, is wrong.  In the present situation of Europe, where so much squalid poverty,  wretchedness, and distress abound, it is not to be wondered at that  such feelings should obtain. But, if we cast our eyes abroad in the  world, we shall find that unhappiness is not always associated with  the poor: it revels in the church and state; among kings, potentates,  princes, and rulers: it follows the haunts of the libertine and  profligate, and gnaws in many instances the conscience of the minister:  it rides with lords and ladies in their carriages and chariots, and  revels in splendid saloons and in banquet halls. Many a pleasant  countenance covers an aching heart, and many a gorgeous costume hides  the deadly worm; jealousy, disappointed ambition, blasted hopes, cold  neglect, and conjugal infidelity, produce many a miserable heart; and  rage, envy, malice, and murder, lurk in many instances under the cover  of pomp, splendor, competency, or magnificence; not to mention the  care, anxiety, and trouble of officers of state in these troublous  times. If the poor knew the situation of many of those in different  circumstances, they would not envy their situations.    Again, if we notice the position of some of the southern and western  States of America. They have abundance to eat and to drink, their lands  bring forth bountifully. But does this make them happy? Verily, no. The  same false state of society exists there; men are awfully under the  influence of their depraved passions; men are frequently put to death  by what is called \"Lynch law,\" without judge or jury. The pistol, the  bowie knife, the rifle, and the dirk, are in frequent requisition, and  misery and unhappiness prevail.    In Mexico, where they possess one of the richest countries in the  world, a salubrious climate, a rich soil, abounding also with the most  valuable mineral resources, yet the people are unhappy. Guerillas  plunder the traveller, their streets are crowded with beggars; its men  are without courage or energy, and the country is left a prey to any  nation, who has covetousness or power to oppress it. The Scriptures  say, that \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that  proceedeth from the mouth of God;\" and as they do not exist in this  way, another Scripture tells the story in plain terms, for it says,  \"Where there is no vision the people perish.\" Proverbs xxix. 18.    There is also another political party, who desire, through the  influence of legislation and coercion, to level the world. To say the  least, it is a species of robbery; to some it may appear an honorable  one, but, nevertheless, it is robbery. What right has any private man  to take by force the property of another? The laws of all nations would  punish such a man as a thief. Would thousands of men engaged in the  same business make it more honorable? Certainly not. And if a nation  were to do it, would a nation's act sanctify a wrong deed? No; the  Algerine pirates, or Arabian hordes, were never considered honorable,  on account of their numbers; and a nation, or nations, engaging in  this would only augment the banditti, but could never sanctify the  deed. I shall not, here, enter into the various manners of obtaining  wealth; but would merely state, that any unjust acquisition of it  ought to be punished by law. Wealth is generally the representation of  labour, industry, and talent. If one man is industrious, enterprising,  diligent, careful, and saves property, and his children follow in his  steps, and accumulate wealth; and another man is careless, prodigal,  and lazy, and his children inherit his poverty, I cannot conceive upon  what principles of justice, the children of the idle and profligate  have a right to put their hands into the pockets of those who are  diligent and careful, and rob them of their purse. Let this principle  exist, and all energy and enterprise would be crushed. Men would  be afraid of again accumulating, lest they should again be robbed.  Industry and talent would have no stimulant, and confusion and ruin  would inevitably follow. Again, if you took men's property without  their consent, the natural consequence would be that they would seek to  retake it the first opportunity; and this state of things would only  deluge the world in blood. So that let any of these measures be carried  out, even according to the most sanguine hopes of the parties, they  would not only bring distress upon others, but also upon themselves;  certainly they would not bring about the peace of the world.    One thing more upon this subject, and I have done. In Europe, there  has been of late years a great mania for revolutions--a strong desire  to establish republican governments; but let me remark here, that the  form of government will not materially affect the position of the  people, nor add to the resources of a country. If a country is rich and  prosperous under a monarchy, it will be so under a republic, and _vice  versa_. If poor under one, it will be under another. If nations think  proper to change their form of government, they of course have a right  to do so; but to think that this will ameliorate their condition, and  produce happiness, is altogether a mistake. Happiness and peace are  the gifts of God, and come from Him. Every kind of government has its  good and evil properties. Rome was unhappy under a kingly government,  and also under a republican form. Carthage as a republic was no more  happy than many of its monarchial contemporaries; nor was Corinth,  Holland, or Venice; and republican Genoa has not manifested anything  very much in favor of these principles. France was unhappy under her  emperor, she was unhappy under her kings, and is unhappy as a republic.  America is perhaps some little exception to this; but the difference  lies not so much in her government, as in the extent of her country,  the richness of her soil, and abundance of her resources; for, as I  have already mentioned, \"Lynch law\" prevails to an alarming extent in  the south and west. In the state of New York, in the east, there are  mobs painted as Indians resisting the officers of the law, and doing it  with impunity; and it is a matter of doubt whether persons having paid  for property, shall own it, or be dispossessed by their tenants, not in  law, for the constitution and laws are good, but in practice defective,  through popular clamor and violence. I refer to the estates of Van  Ranseller and others; and, in the west, to Joseph and Hyrum Smith, who  were murdered in Carthage jail, without any redress, although their  murderers were known to the officers of state; and to the inhabitants  of a city, ten thousand in number, together with twenty thousand  others, principally farmers, labourers, and mechanics, occupying a  country about ten miles wide, and thirty long, most of which was  well cultivated and owned by the occupants,--who were all forced by  continual harassing by lawless mobs, to leave a country in which they  could not be protected, and seek an asylum in a far off desert home,  there being no power in the government to give redress.    It is altogether an infatuation to think that a change in government  will mend the circumstances, or increase the resources, when the whole  world is groaning under corruption. If there are twenty men who have  twenty pounds of bread to divide amongst them, it matters but little  whether it is divided by three, ten, or the whole, it will not increase  the amount. I grant, however, that there are flagrant"]]]
