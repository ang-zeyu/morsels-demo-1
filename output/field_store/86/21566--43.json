Our private establishment consisted of ten or twelve servants in all,  including a girl of the Kuki tribe, named Bykoout, who assisted the  ayah; a very small establishment for India. Servants in Assam are  bad and difficult to keep. Most of mine were imported, but, with the  exception of my two faithful Bhooyas, Seewa and Keptie, and a syce  (groom), by name Peewa, they were all soon corrupted, though some had  been with me for years. Seewa once said to me, \"The influence here  is so bad, that we too shall be corrupted if we stay long.\" Seewa was  quite a character. One day I got a letter from one of his relations,  asking me to tell him that his wife was dead. I remembered her well;  it was a love match, and she had run away with him. I feared it would  be such a blow, that I felt quite nervous about telling him, and put it  off till the evening, when, with a faltering voice, I broke the news as  gently as I could. Instead of the outburst of grief I had looked for,  he quietly asked, \"What did she die of?\" I said, \"Fever.\" He replied,  \"Oh, yes, I thought it must be that. Will you write and see that all  her property is made over to my brother, otherwise some of her people  may steal it?\"    The state of things at Samagudting was very discouraging. I resented  seeing the Government and the establishment being charged famine prices  for everything, by the Nagas and Khyahs; also the general squalor which  prevailed, and which I felt need not exist. It was the inheritance  of the hand-to-mouth system in which everything had been commenced  in early days. However, my wife set me an example of cheerfulness,  and I made up my mind to remedy all the evils I could. First, the  supply system was attacked, and I made arrangements with some old  Khyah friends at Golaghat, to send up large supplies of rice and  other kinds of food, and as the season advanced, I encouraged such of  the military police as could be spared to take up land at Dimapur,  and cultivate. For ourselves, I bought two cows at Borpathar, and  established them at Nichu Guard, whence my gardener brought up the milk  every day. In a short time we were more comfortable than could have  been expected, and there was the additional satisfaction of seeing  that the arrangements for cheaper food for the establishment proved  successful. Water was the standing difficulty; we had to depend upon  the caprice of the Naga water-carriers, and frequently my wife's  bath, filled ready for the next morning, had to be emptied in the  evening to provide water for cooking our evening meal! Sometimes I  got clean water for drinking from the Diphoo Panee, otherwise what  we had was as if it had been taken from a dirty puddle. The want  of water prevented our having a garden near our house; we had a few  hardy flowers, including the shoe-flower--a kind of hibiscus--roses,  and passion-flower. Such vegetable-garden as we had was at Nichu Guard,  where the soil was good, and water plentiful.    Our house was watertight, and that was the best that could be said  for it. It was thatched, with walls of split bamboos and strengthened  by wooden posts; there were no glass windows, and the doors and  shutters were of split bamboo tied together; the mud floor was also  covered with thin split bamboos, and had to be swept constantly,  as the dust worked through. We had one sitting-room, a bed-room,  bath-room, pantry, and store-room, the latter full of rats. Snakes  occasionally visited us, and a day or two after we had settled in,  a cat rushed in while we were at breakfast, jumped on my knee and  took away the meat from my plate, and bit and scratched me when I  tried to catch her. My dressing-room was the shade of a tree outside,  where I bathed Anglo-Indian camp fashion, substituting a large hollow  bamboo for the usual mussuk, or skin of water.    We arrived at Samagudting on January 23rd, 1874, and by the beginning  of February felt quite old residents; hill-walking no longer tired me,  and we had made acquaintance with all the Nagas of the village, and of  many others, and were on quite friendly terms with \"Jatsole,\" the chief  of Samagudting, a shrewd far-seeing man, with great force of character.    I have mentioned the Burrail range, and the valley separating  us. Besides Samagudting there were two other villages on our side,  Sitekima, on the opposite bank of the Diphoo Panee Gorge, and  Tesephima, on outlying spurs of Samagudting. I say Samagudting,  as it has become the common appellation, but correctly speaking it  should be Chumookodima.    On the side of the Burrail facing us, were villages belonging to  a tribe we call Kutcha Nagas, a race inferior in fighting power to  the Angamis, but not unlike them in appearance, though of inferior  physique. These villages were formerly inhabited by Cacharees. [8]    On February 4th, I had a letter from Captain Butler, saying that  he would be at Kohima in a day or two, and asking me to meet him  there. He said that three of the police would be a sufficient escort. I  accordingly took three men, and started on the 6th, marching to Piphima  twenty-one miles, and the next morning another twenty-one into Kohima,  two very hard marches. I was glad to renew my acquaintance with Butler,  whom I had known when he first landed in India in 1861, and I was in  Fort William, studying for my Hindustani examination. He was a fine  manly fellow, admirably fitted to conduct an expedition, where pluck  and perseverance were required. Here, I also met Dr. Brown, Political  Agent of Manipur, and Captain (now Colonel) Badgley and Lieutenant  (now Colonel C.B.) Woodthorpe, R.E., of the survey, also Lieutenant  (now Major V.C.) Ridgeway, 44th N.I., I spent a pleasant evening,  discussing various subjects with Captain Butler, and early on the  8th started on my return journey.    Captain Butler had done the whole forty-two miles into Samagudting  in one day, and I determined to attempt it, and succeeded, though  the last 2000 feet of ascent to my house was rather hard, tired as I  was. My wife did not expect me, but I had arranged to fire three shots  from my rifle as a signal, if I arrived at any time by night; this I  did about 500 feet below my house, and I at once saw lanterns appear  far above me, and in a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, I was  at my door. The sound of firing at 9 P.M. created quite a sensation  among the weak-nerved ones on the hill, but it was good practice for  the sentries to be kept on the alert. Ever after, three shots from  a rifle or a revolver, were always my signal when I neared home,  and often in after years were they heard in the dead of night, when  I was thought to be miles away. My wife used to say that it kept the  people in good order, never knowing when to expect me. I think it did.    Life was never monotonous. I took long walks, after our morning  walk round the hill, to inspect roads and bridges--a very important  work. Then I attended Cutcherry (the court of justice) and heard cases,  often with a loaded revolver in my hand, in case of any wild savage  attempting to dispute my authority; then I finished off revenue work,  of which there was little, and went home, had a cup of tea, visited  hospitals and gaol, if I had not already done so; and afterwards  went for an evening walk with my wife, round the hill or through  the village.    Sometimes duty took me to the plains, and we had a most delightful  march to the Nambor hot springs, when I arranged to have a rest  house built at Nowkatta, between Dimapur and Hurreo Jan. We reached  the last place, just after a dreadful catastrophe had occurred. The  rest house was raised on posts, six feet above the ground. One night  when the man carrying the dak (post) had arrived from Borpathar,  he hung up the letter bag under the house on a peg, and having had  his evening meal, retired to rest in the house with one or two other  travellers. Suddenly a huge tiger rushed up the steps, sprang through  the open door, and seizing one of the sleepers, bounded off into  the forest with him. One of my police who was there snatched up his  rifle, pursued the tiger and fired, making him drop the man, but life  was extinct, and when we arrived, there was a huge bloodstain on the  floor, at least a yard long. Strange to say, the letter bag was on one  occasion carried off by a tiger, but afterwards recovered, uninjured  save by tooth marks. The policeman was promoted for his gallantry.    The day after leaving Hurreo Jan, we met a party of Rengma Nagas coming  to see me, with some little presents. They were the men who helped to  kill the panther, that wounded me in 1862, [9] and they brought with  them the son of one of their number, who was killed by the infuriated  beast, a fine lad of fifteen; needless to say, that I rewarded these  friendly people, whom I had not seen for twelve years. We halted a  day or two at the springs, as I had to visit Golaghat on business,  and unfortunately missed seeing a herd of wild elephants caught, a  sight I had wished my wife to see. She did see the stockade, but the  elephants had been already taken out. I hope farther on to describe  an elephant drive.    I do not know a more agreeable place to halt at than the hot springs  in former days. In cold weather before the mosquitoes had arrived  it was perfect rest. A little opening in the tall dark forest, in  the centre some scrub jungle, including fragrant wild lemons and  citrons, with the pool in the midst; a babbling stream flowed all  round the opening, on the other side of which was a high bank. The  bathing was delightful, and could be made quite private for ladies,  by means of a cloth enclosure, well known to the Assamese by the name  of \"Ar Kapor.\" Then the occasional weird cry of the hoolook ape, and  the gambols of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37842"],[0,"Small Horses in Warfare (#6)"],[1," sires--the Byerly Turk imported in 1689, the Darley Arabian in 1706, and  the Godolphin Arabian in 1730: all of them, it may be remarked, horses  under 14 hands.    By going back to the original strain we shall obtain all the useful  qualities our Thoroughbreds possess without those undesired  characteristics, greatly increased size, great speed, delicacy of  constitution and complete inability to lead a natural life which man's  long-maintained endeavours to breed race horses have implanted in them.  In a word, we shall obtain a natural and not an artificial horse; the  modern race-horse is practically everything the mounted infantry cob  must not be, saving only in respect of speed, and speed for only a  short distance is of no great use to mounted infantry. By using the Arab  we may expect to obtain the qualities our race horses boasted a century  and a half or two centuries ago, when they stood 14 hands to 14.3--the  famous Gimcrack is said to have measured 14 hands 0-1/4 inch.    There is much to be said in favour of the policy of returning to the  original Eastern stock to find suitable sires for our proposed breed of  ponies. While we have been breeding the Thoroughbred for speed and speed  only, Arab breeders have continued to breed for stoutness, endurance and  good looks. By going to Arab stock for our sires we might at the  beginning sacrifice some measure of speed: but what was lost in that  respect would be more than compensated by the soundness of constitution  and limb which are such conspicuous traits in the Eastern horse.  Furthermore, the difficulty of size which confronts us in the  Thoroughbred sire is much diminished if we adopt the Arab as our  foundation sire.    By crossing the Arab on mares of our forest and moorland breeds we shall  obtain the increased size and speed required, while it will be possible  to preserve the valuable qualities of the dam. Those qualities, the  hardiness, robustness of constitution, sureness of foot, and ability to  thrive on poor feed, are the natural outcome of the conditions under  which they have lived for centuries; and to preserve them in the young  stock, it will be necessary to rear the cross-bred foals under  conditions as nearly natural as their constitution will allow. What  those conditions should be circumstances must determine; but it is  possible to combine large measure of liberty with a certain amount of  shelter from the rigours of winter, such as the foal with Arab blood in  his veins would require. To take up the young stock as soon as weaned,  stable and feed them artificially, though this course would preserve  them from the risks of exposure, would produce failure in other  directions. It would encourage undue physical development while  undermining that capacity for endurance of hardship which is so  essential.      [Illustration: _From a drawing on stone by Gauci._ GIMCRACK]    Whether, by careful attention to mating and management, it would be  possible to establish a breed of small horses as a fixed type is a  question only prolonged experience will be able to answer. It is quite  certain that we shall never be able to reckon on getting stock which,  when fully grown and furnished, will neither exceed nor fall short of  the limit of 14 hands 2 inches, at which the breeder will aim with the  prizes of the polo pony market in his mind's eye. But there is sound  reason to think that we can build upon an Arab and Forest or Moorland  pony foundation a breed of small horses such as we need for mounted  infantry.    There are difficulties in the way; and not the least is the peculiar  care and watchfulness that must be exercised in order to hit the \"happy  medium\" between artificial life, with its attendant drawbacks of  probable overgrowth and certain delicacy of constitution, and the free,  natural existence, which may prove fatal to the cross-bred youngsters  and will certainly check their growth.    Having shown the great utility of small horses for work requiring  endurance, hardiness, and weight-carrying power, as proved by the  writings of authorities who, in several instances, employed them merely  because they could procure no other animals, and learned what their  qualities are by experience, we may briefly summarise what has been said  in regard to the foundation stock we possess.    (1) The pony dams of our Forest and Moorland breeds cannot be surpassed.    (2) The sire chosen should be a _small_ thoroughbred or an Arab. If a  half-breed sire is used his dam should be one not less than three parts  thoroughbred.    (3) Inasmuch as the forest and moorland ponies owe their small size and  soundness to the hardships of the free and natural conditions in which  they live, their half-bred produce should--    (_a_) Lead a similarly free and natural life as far as climate permits,  in order to inure them to the hardships of warfare and general work:    (_b_) Should exist, as far as possible, on natural herbage: as in all  cases artificial feeding tends to render them less hardy and enduring.          APPENDIX.      Since this little book was placed in the printers' hands, a work  published in 1836 has come under the writer's notice. This is entitled  _A Comparative View of the Form and Character of the English Racer and  Saddle Horse during the Past and Present Centuries_.[4] It was written  with the view of showing that the natural qualities of the  horse--endurance, weight-carrying power and speed maintained over long  distances, are found at their best in the horse which has been reared  under natural conditions and whose stature has not been increased by  \"selection\" in breeding and by artificial conditions of life. In the  opening words of the Introductory chapter;    [4] Illustrated by eighteen plates of horses.--Anon. Published by Thomas  Hookham, London.         \"The main object of these pages is to investigate the results       of that structural enlargement of animals which is unnatural,       to point out those properties which may be acquired by certain       of them when fully reclaimed, and those which they are likely       to lose in this condition.         \"The natural stature both of horses and cattle is small       compared with that which they acquire when domesticated. The       enlargement of their structure is effected by grass made by art       unnaturally rich, or by food yet more foreign to their nature.       Supplied plentifully with either throughout the year, horses       acquire an increase of stature in muscular power which enables       them to carry or drag a heavier weight....\"    The author proceeds to observe that in enlarging the structure we seem  to modify rather than improve the vital powers of the animal; and by way  of illustrating his meaning points out with great truth that--         \"In the human race any extent of skeleton or amount of muscle       which is unusually large is rarely allied with a full amount of       vital power. Still, the man who has most muscle can make the       greatest muscular exertion. If we change the nature of the       trial and render it one of time or privations, the greater       vital power of smaller but well-formed men is apparent.\"    Our author then proceeds to examine the properties which animals derive  from nature, comparing these with those they derive from art. In this  connection I have been much interested to observe that he cites the  greater strength, staying power and activity of the hare of the downs  over the hare of the park and low pasture-land. The same comparison was  made by me[5] as proof of the advantages to an animal of life-conditions  that compel the free use of limbs.    [5] \"Young Race Horses,\" pp. 21-2, by Sir Walter Gilbey, Bart. Vinton &  Co., Limited, 1898.    Nature, observes this author, erects her own standard for measuring the  constitutional power of her creatures, and the individuals who no longer  come up to this perish prematurely. In other words, the constitutional  strength of animals is so regulated by, and adjusted to, the conditions  of feed and climate under which those animals pass their lives, that  they thrive vigorously. We do not, for instance, find the ponies of the  Welsh hills or of Exmoor, a feeble and delicate race; the feeble  individuals die off without perpetuating their weaknesses, and those  which come up to the standard of vitality Nature has prescribed survive  to reproduce their kind.    The following, which has direct bearing on the subject matter of the  foregoing pages, must be noted:--         \"Many facts have been recorded showing the extraordinary power       of ponies for travelling fast and far, but these are so well       known as to make it unnecessary to specify them here.\"    Nevertheless on a subsequent page we find recorded a very striking  example of endurance, which compares favourably with any of those quoted  in the foregoing pages and in my little work on Ponies:[6]    [6] \"Ponies: Past and Present.\" By Sir Walter Gilbey, Bart Vinton & Co.,  Ltd.         \"The late Mr. Allen of Sudbury, in Suffolk, often during the       course of his life rode from that place to London and back (112       miles) in the course of a day upon a pony. This task was       performed by several which Mr. Allen had in succession. When he       returned home from these expeditions he was in the habit of       turning the little animal he had ridden at once into the lanes       without giving it a grain of corn. Mr. Allen, whose weight was       very light, rode at a smart canter. He always selected Welsh       ponies, saying that no others were so stout.\"    The author adds that if any one of our enlarged horses could be found  capable of performing this task it would certainly not be on a grass  diet; which is undoubtedly true.    At the date this book was published, 1836, the deterioration which our  race horses had undergone through the abolition of long-distance races  was a subject of comment."]]]
