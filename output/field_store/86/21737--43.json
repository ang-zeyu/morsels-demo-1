Whenever the  general disposition of the people is such that each individual regards  those only of his interests which are selfish, and does not dwell on,  or concern himself for, his share of the general interest, in such a  state of things good government is impossible. The influence of  defects of intelligence in obstructing all the elements of good  government requires no illustration. Government consists of acts done  by human beings; and if the agents, or those who choose the agents, or  those to whom the agents are responsible, or the lookers-on whose  opinion ought to influence and check all these, are mere masses of  ignorance, stupidity, and baleful prejudice, every operation of  government will go wrong; while, in proportion as the men rise above  this standard, so will the government improve in quality up to the  point of excellence, attainable but nowhere attained, where the  officers of government, themselves persons of superior virtue and  intellect, are surrounded by the atmosphere of a virtuous and  enlightened public opinion.    The first element of good government, therefore, being the virtue and  intelligence of the human beings composing the community, the most  important point of excellence which any form of government can possess  is to promote the virtue and intelligence of the people themselves.  The first question in respect to any political institutions is how far  they tend to foster in the members of the community the various  desirable qualities, moral and intellectual, or rather (following  Bentham's more complete classification) moral, intellectual, and  active. The government which does this the best has every likelihood  of being the best in all other respects, since it is on these  qualities, so far as they exist in the people, that all possibility of  goodness in the practical operations of the government depends.    We may consider, then, as one criterion of the goodness of a  government, the degree in which it tends to increase the sum of good  qualities in the governed, collectively and individually, since,  besides that their well-being is the sole object of government, their  good qualities supply the moving force which works the machinery. This  leaves, as the other constituent element of the merit of a government,  the quality of the machinery itself; that is, the degree in which it  is adapted to take advantage of the amount of good qualities which may  at any time exist, and make them instrumental to the right purposes.  Let us again take the subject of judicature as an example and  illustration. The judicial system being given, the goodness of the  administration of justice is in the compound ratio of the worth of the  men composing the tribunals, and the worth of the public opinion which  influences or controls them. But all the difference between a good and  a bad system of judicature lies in the contrivances adopted for  bringing whatever moral and intellectual worth exists in the community  to bear upon the administration of justice, and making it duly  operative on the result. The arrangements for rendering the choice of  the judges such as to obtain the highest average of virtue and  intelligence; the salutary forms of procedure; the publicity which  allows observation and criticism of whatever is amiss; the liberty of  discussion and cinsure through the press; the mode of taking evidence,  according as it is well or ill adapted to elicit truth; the  facilities, whatever be their amount, for obtaining access to the  tribunals; the arrangements for detecting crimes and apprehending  offenders-all these things are not the power, but the machinery for  bringing the power into contact with the obstacle; and the machinery  has no action of itself, but without it the power, let it be ever so  ample, would be wasted and of no effect. A similar distinction exists  in regard to the constitution of the executive departments of  administration. Their machinery is good, when the proper tests are  prescribed for the qualifications of officers, the proper rules for  their promotion; when the business is conveniently distributed among  those who are to transact it, a convenient and methodical order  established for its transaction, a correct and intelligible record  kept of it after being transacted; when each individual knows for what  he is responsible, and is known to others as responsible for it; when  the best-contrived checks are provided against negligence, favoritism,  or jobbery in any of the acts of the department. But political checks  will no more act of themselves than a bridle will direct a horse  without a rider. If the checking functionaries are as corrupt or as  negligent as those whom they ought to check, and if the public, the  mainspring of the whole checking machinery, are too ignorant, too  passive, or too careless and inattentive to do their part, little  benefit will be derived from the best administrative apparatus. Yet a  good apparatus is always preferable to a bad. It enables such  insufficient moving or checking power as exists to act at the greatest  advantage; and without it, no amount of moving or checking power would  be sufficient. Publicity, for instance, is no impediment to evil, nor  stimulus to good, if the public will not look at what is done; but  without publicity, how could they either check or encourage what they  were not permitted to see? The ideally perfect constitution of a  public office is that in which the interest of the functionary is  entirely coincident with his duty. No mere system will make it so, but  still less can it be made so without a system, aptly devised for the  purpose.    What we have said of the arrangements for the detailed administration  of the government is still more evidently true of its general  constitution. All government which aims at being good is an  organization of some part of the good qualities existing in the  individual members of the community for the conduct of its collective  affairs. A representative constitution is a means of bringing the  general standard of intelligence and honesty existing in the  community, and the individual intellect and virtue of its wisest  members, more directly to bear upon the government, and investing them  with greater influence in it than they would have under any other mode  of organization; though, under any, such influence as they do have is  the source of all good that there is in the government, and the  hindrance of every evil that there is not. The greater the amount of  these good qualities which the institutions of a country succeed in  organizing, and the better the mode of organization, the better will  be the government.    We have now, therefore, obtained a foundation for a twofold division  of the merit which any set of political institutions can possess. It  consists partly of the degree in which they promote the general mental  advancement of the community, including under that phrase advancement  in intellect, in virtue, and in practical activity and efficiency, and  partly of the degree of perfection with which they organize the moral,  intellectual, and active worth already existing, so as to operate with  the greatest effect on public affairs. A government is to be judged by  its action upon men and by its action upon things; by what it makes of  the citizens, and what it does with them; its tendency to improve or  deteriorate the people themselves, and the goodness or badness of the  work it performs for them, and by means of them. Government is at once  a great influence acting on the human mind, and a set of organized  arrangements for public business: in the first capacity its beneficial  action is chiefly indirect, but not therefore less vital, while its  mischievous action may be direct.    The difference between these two functions of a government is not,  like that between Order and Progress, a difference merely in degree,  but in kind. We must not, however, suppose that they have no intimate  connection with one another. The institutions which insure the best  management of public affairs practicable in the existing state of  cultivation tend by this alone to the further improvement of that  state. A people which had the most just laws, the purest and most  efficient judicature, the most enlightened administration, the most  equitable and least onerous system of finance, compatible with the  stage it had attained in moral and intellectual advancement, would be  in a fair way to pass rapidly into a higher stage. Nor is there any  mode in which political institutions can contribute more effectually  to the improvement of the people than by doing their more direct work  well. And reversely, if their machinery is so badly constructed that  they do their own particular business ill, the effect is felt in a  thousand ways in lowering the morality and deadening the intelligence  and activity of the people. But the distinction is nevertheless real,  because this is only one of the means by which political institutions  improve or deteriorate the human mind, and the causes and modes of  that beneficial or injurious influence remain a distinct and much  wider subject of study.    Of the two modes of operation by which a form of government or set of  political institutions affects the welfare of the community--its  operation as an agency of national education, and its arrangements for  conducting the collective affairs of the community in the state of  education in which they already are, the last evidently varies much  less, from difference of country and state of civilization, than the  first. It has also much less to do with the fundamental constitution  of the government. The mode of conducting the practical business of  government, which is best under a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5694"],[0,"The Harvard Classics Volume 38 (#6)"],[1," the soldiers and  citizens to do the like, which they did; even the ladies and  girls, and those who had not baskets, made use of cauldrons,  panniers, sacks, sheets, and all such things to carry the earth;  so that the enemy had no sooner broken down the wall than they  found behind it a yet stronger rampart. The wall having fallen,  our men cried out at those outside, \"Fox, fox, fox,\" and they  vented a thousand insults against one another. M. de Guise  forbade any man on pain of death to speak with those outside, for  fear there should be some traitor who would betray what was being  done within the town. After this order, our men tied live cats to  the ends of their pikes, and put them over the wall and cried  with the cats, \"Miaut, Miaut.\"    Truly the Imperials were much enraged, having been so long making  a breach, at great loss, which was eighty paces wide, that fifty  men of their front rank should enter in, only to find a rampart  stronger than the wall. They threw themselves upon the poor cats,  and shot them with arquebuses as men shoot at the popinjay.    Our men often ran out upon them, by order of M. de Guise; a few  days ago, our men had all made haste to enrol themselves in  sallying-parties, chiefly the young nobility, led by experienced  captains; and indeed it was doing them a great favour to let them  issue from the town and run upon the enemy. They went forth  always an hundred or six score men, well armed with cutlasses,  arquebuses, pistols, pikes, partisans, and halbards; and advanced  as far as the trenches, to take the enemy unawares. Then an  alarum would be sounded all through the enemy's camp, and their  drums would beat plan, plan, ta ti ta, ta ta ti ta, tou touf  touf. Likewise their trumpets and clarions rang and sounded, To  saddle, to saddle, to saddle, to horse, to horse, to horse, to  saddle, to horse, to horse. And all their soldiers cried, \"Arm,  arm arm! to arms, to arms, to arms! arm, to arms, arm, to arms,  arm\":--like the hue-and-cry after wolves; and all diverse  tongues, according to their nations; and you saw them come out of  their tents and little lodgings, as thick as little ants when you  uncover the ant-hills, to bring help to their comrades, who were  having their throats cut like sheep. Their cavalry also came from  all sides at full gallop, patati, patata, patati, patata, pa, ta,  ta, patata pata, ta, eager to be in the thick of the fighting, to  give and take their share of the blows. And when our men saw  themselves hard pressed, they would turn back into the town,  fighting all the way; and those pursuing them were driven back  with cannon-shots, and the cannons were loaded with flint-stones  and with big pieces of iron, square or three-sided. And our men  on the wall fired a volley, and rained bullets on them as thick  as hail, to send them back to their beds; whereas many remained  dead on the field: and our men also did not all come back with  whole skins, and there were always some left behind (as it were a  tax levied on us) who were joyful to die on the bed of honour.  And if there was a horse wounded, it was skinned and eaten by the  soldiers, instead of beef and bacon; and if a man was wounded, I  must run and dress him. Some days afterward there were other  sallies, which infuriated the enemy, that we would not let him  sleep a little in safety.    M. de Guise played a trick upon them: he sent a peasant, who was  none of the wisest, with two letters to the King, and gave him  ten crowns, and promised the King would give him an hundred if he  got the letters to him. In the one letter M. de Guise told the  King that the enemy shewed no of retreating, and had put forth  all their strength made a great breach, which he hoped to defend,  even at the cost of his own life and of all who were in the town;  and that the enemy had planted their artillery so well in a  certain place (which he named) that it was with great difficulty  he could keep them from entering the town, seeing it was the  weakest place in the town; but soon he hoped to rebuild it well,  so that they should not be able to enter. This letter was sewed  in the lining of the man's doublet, and he was told to be very  careful not to speak of it to any person. And the other letter  was given to him, wherein M. de Guise told the King that he and  all those besieged with him hoped to guard the town well; and  other matters which I leave untold here. He sent out the man at  night, and he was taken by the enemy's guard and brought to the  Duke of Alva, that the Duke might hear what was doing in the  town; and the peasant was asked if he had any letters. He said  \"Yes,\" and gave them the one; and they having seen it asked him  if he had not another. He said \"No.\" Then he was searched, and  they found on him that which was sewed in his doubtlet; and the  poor messenger was handed and strangled.    The letters were taken to the Emperor, who called his council,  where it was resolved, since they had been unable to do anything  at the first breach, the artillery should forthwith be set  against the place which they thought weakest, where they put  forth all their strength to make a fresh breach; and they sapped  and mined the wall, and tried hard to make a way into the Hell  Tower, but dared not assault it openly.    The Duke of Alva represented to the Emperor that every day their  soldiers were dying, to the number of more than two hundred, and  there was so little hope of entering the town, seeing the time of  year and the great number of our soldiers who were in it. The  Emperor asked what men they were who were dying, and whether they  were gentlemen and men of mark; answer was made to him \"They were  all poor soldiers.\" Then said he, \"It was no great loss if they  died,\" comparing them to caterpillars, grasshoppers, and  cockchafers, which eat up the buds and other good things of the  earth; and if they were men of any worth they would not be in his  camp at six livres the month, and therefore it was no great harm  if they died. Moreover, he said he would never depart from the  town till he had taken it by force or by famine, though he should  lose all his army; because of the great number of princes who  were shut up in it, with the greater part of the nobility of  France, who he hoped would pay his expenses four times over; and  he would go yet again to Paris, to see the Parisians, and to make  himself King of all the kingdom of France.    M. de Guise, with the princes, captains, and soldiers, and in  general all the citizens of the town, having heard the Emperor's  resolve to exterminate us all, forbade the soldiers and citizens,  and even the princes and seigneurs, to eat fresh fish or venison,  or partridges, woodcocks, larks, francolines, plovers, or other  game, for fear these had acquired any pestilential air which  could bring infection among us. So they had to content themselves  with the fare of the army; biscuit, beef, salt cow-beef, bacon,  cervelas, and Mayence hams; also fish, as haddock, salmon, shad,  tunny, whale, anchovy, sardines, herrings; also peas, beans,  rice, garlic, onions, prunes, cheeses, butter, oil, and salt;  pepper, ginger, nutmegs and other spices to put in our pies,  mostly of horses, which without the spice had a very bad taste.  Many citizens, having gardens in the town, had planted them with  fine radishes, turnips, carrots, and leeks, which they kept  flourishing and very dear, for the extreme necessity of the  famine. Now all these stores were distributed by weight, measure,  and justice, according to the quality of the persons, because we  knew not how long the siege would last. For after we heard the  Emperors words, how he would not depart from before Metz, till he  had taken it by force or by famine, the victuals were cut down;  and what they used to distribute to three soldiers was given to  four; and it was forbidden to them to sell the remains which  might be left after their meals; but they might give them to the  rabble. And they always rose from table with an appetite, for  fear they should be subject to take physick.    And before we surrendered to the mercy of the enemy, we had  determined to eat the asses, mules, and horses, dogs, cats, and  rats, even our boots and collars, and other skins that we could  have softened and stewed. And, in a word, all the besieged were  resolved to defend themselves valiantly with all instruments of  war; to set the artillery at the entry of the breach, and load  with balls, stones, cart-nails, bars and chains of iron; also all  sorts and kinds of artificial fires, as barricadoes, grenades,  stink-pots, torches, squibs, fire-traps, burning faggots; with  boiling water, melted lead, and lime, to put out the enemy's  eyes. Also, they were to make holes right through their houses,  and put arquebusiers in them, to take the enemy in flank and  hasten his going, or else give him stop then and there. Also they  were to order the women to pull up the streets, and throw from  their windows billets, tables, trestles, benches, and stools, to  dash out the enemy's brains. Moreover, a little within the  breach, there was a great stronghold full of carts and palisades,  tuns and casks; and barricades of earth to serve as gabions,  interlaid with falconets, falcons, field-pieces, crooked  arquebuses, pistols, arquebuses, and wildfires, to break their  legs and thighs, so that they would be taken from above and on  the flank and from behind; and if they had carried this  stronghold, there were others where the streets crossed, every  hundred paces, which would have been as bad friends to them as  the first, or worse, and would have made many widows and orphans.  And if fortune had been so hard on us that they had stormed and  broken up our strongholds, there would yet have been seven great  companies, drawn up in square and in triangle, to fight them all  at once, each led by one of the princes, for the better"]]]
