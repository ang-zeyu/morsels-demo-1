In vain. Well, thought I, it is because she  does not know how to begin. I then began a variation of the first  measure and told her to continue it in the same manner; that went  fairly well. When she had made an end I asked her to begin  something of her own,--only the first voice, a melody. She  thought a full quarter of an hour, and nothing came. Thereupon I  wrote four measures of a minuet and said to her: 'Now look what  an ass I am; I have begun a minuet and can't finish even the  first part; be good enough to finish it for me.' She thought it  impossible. At length she produced a little something to my joy.  Then I made her finish the minuet, i.e. only the first voice. For  her home work I have given her nothing to do except to alter my  four measures and make something out of them, to invent another  beginning, to keep to the harmony if she must, but to write a new  melody. We shall see what comes of it tomorrow.\"    (Paris, May 14, 1778, to his father. The pupil was the daughter  of the Duke de Guines, an excellent flautist. \"She plays the harp  magnificently,\" writes Mozart in the same letter; \"has a great  deal of talent and genius, and an incomparable memory. She knows  200 pieces and plays them all by heart.\" When it came to paying  Mozart for the lessons the Duke was anything but a nobleman.)    52. \"The Andante is going to give us the most trouble, for it is  full of expression and must be played with taste and accurately  as written in the matter of forte and piano. She is very clever  and learns quickly. The right hand is very good but the left  utterly ruined. I can say that I often pity her when I see that  she is obliged to labor till she gasps, not because she is unapt,  but because she can't help it,--she is used to playing so, nobody  ever taught her differently. I said to her mother and her that if  I were her regular teacher, I would lock up all her music, cover  the keyboard with a handkerchief, and make her practice both  hands at first slowly on nothing but passages, trills, mordents,  etc., until the difficulty with the left hand was remedied; after  that I am sure I could make a real clavier player out of her. It  is a pity; she has so much genius, reads respectably, has a great  deal of natural fluency and plays with a great deal of feeling.\"    (Mannheim, November 16, 1777, to his father. The pupil was Rose  Cannabich, to whom the sonata referred to is dedicated. Her  father, whom Mozart admired greatly as an able conductor, was  Chapelmaster of the excellently trained orchestra at Mannheim. He  lived from 1731 to 1798. [The Andante from which trouble was  expected was that which Mozart wrote with the purpose that it  should reflect the character of Rose Cannabich, a lovely and  amiable girl, according to all accounts. H.E.K.])    53. \"This E is very forced. One can see that it was written only  to go from one consonance to another in parallel motion,--just as  bad poets write nonsense for the sake of a rhyme.\"    (From the exercise book of the cousin of Abbe Stadler who took  lessons in thorough-bass from Mozart in 1784. It is preserved in  the Court Library in Vienna.)    54. \"My good lad, you ask my advice and I will give it you  candidly; had you studied composition when you were at Naples,  and when your mind was not devoted to other pursuits, you would,  perhaps, have done wisely; but now that your profession of the  stage must, and ought to, occupy all your attention, it would be  an unwise measure to enter into a dry study. You may take my word  for it, Nature has made you a melodist, and you would only  disturb and perplex yourself. Reflect, 'a little knowledge is a  dangerous thing;'--should there be errors in what you write, you  will find hundreds of musicians in all parts of the world capable  of correcting them, therefore do not disturb your natural gift.\"    (To Michael Kelly, the Irish tenor, to whom Mozart assigned the  parts of Basilio and Don Curzio at the first performance of \"Le  Nozze di Figaro\" in 1786. Kelly had asked Mozart whether or not  he should study counterpoint. [See No. 8. Three years later Kelly  returned to England, began his career as composer of musical  pieces for the stage. He was fairly prolific, but failed to  impress the public with the originality of his creative talent.  He went into the wine business, which fact led Sheridan to make  the witty suggestion that he inscribe over his shop: \"Michael  Kelly, Composer of Wines and Importer of Music.\" He was born in  1764 and died in 1826. H.E.K.])    55. \"This is generally the case with all who did not taste the  rod or feel the teacher's tongue when boys, and later think that  they can compel things to their wishes by mere talent and  inclination. Many succeed fairly well, but with other people's  ideas, having none of their own; others who have ideas of their  own, do not know what to do with them. That is your case.\"    (In a letter written in 1789 to a noble friend criticizing a  symphony.)    56. \"Do not wonder at me; it was not a caprice. I noticed that  most of the musicians were old men. There would have been no end  of dragging if I had not first driven them into the fire and made  them angry. Out of pure rage they did their best.\"    (Reported by Rochlitz. Mozart was rehearsing the Allegro of one  of his symphonies in Leipsic. He worked up such a fit of anger  that he stamped his foot and broke one of his shoe-laces. His  anger fled and he broke into a merry laugh.)    57. \"Right! That's the way to shriek.\"    (At a rehearsal of \"Don Giovanni\" the representative of Zerlina  did not act realistically enough to suit Mozart. Thereupon he  went unnoticed on the stage and at the repetition of the scene  grabbed the singer so rudely and unexpectedly that she  involuntarily uttered the shriek which the scene called for. [The  singer was Teresa Bondini, the place Prague, and the time before  the first performance of the opera which took place on October  29, 1787. H.E.K.])        TOUCHING MUSICAL PERFORMANCES        58. \"Herr Stein sees and hears that I am more of a player than  Beecke,--that without making grimaces of any kind I play so  expressively that, according to his own confession, no one shows  off his pianoforte as well as I. That I always remain strictly in  time surprises every one; they can not understand that the left  hand should not in the least be concerned in a tempo rubato. When  they play the left hand always follows.\"    (Augsburg, October 23, 1777, to his father. [We have here a  suggestion of the tempo rubato as played by Chopin according to  the testimony of Mikuli, who said that no matter how free Chopin  was either in melody or arabesque with his right hand, the left  always adhered strictly to the time. Mozart learned the principle  from his father who in his method for the violin condemned the  accompanists who spoiled the tempo rubato of an artist by waiting  to follow him. H.E.K.])    59. \"Whoever can see and hear her (the daughter of Stein) play  without laughing must be a stone (Stein) like her father. She  sits opposite the treble instead of in the middle of the  instrument, so that there may be greater opportunities for  swaying about and making grimaces. Then she rolls up her eyes and  smirks. If a passage occurs twice it is played slower the second  time; if three times, still slower. When a passage comes up goes  the arm, and if there is to be an emphasis it must come from the  arm, heavily and clumsily, not from the fingers. But the best of  all is that when there comes a passage (which ought to flow like  oil) in which there necessarily occurs a change of fingers, there  is no need of taking care; when the time comes you stop, lift the  hand and nonchalantly begin again. This helps one the better to  catch a false note, and the effect is frequently curious.\"    (Augsburg, October 23, 1777. The letter is to his father and the  young woman whose playing is criticized is the little miss of  eight years, Nanette Stein.)    60. \"When I told Herr Stein that I would like to play on his  organ and that I was passionately fond of the instrument, he  marveled greatly and said: 'What, a man like you, so great a  clavier player, want to play on an instrument which has no  douceur, no expression, neither piano nor forte, but goes on  always the same?' 'But all that signifies nothing; to me the  organ is nevertheless the king of instruments.' \"    (Augsburg, October 17, 1777, to his father.)    61. \"I had the pleasure to hear Herr Franzl (whose wife is a  sister of Madame Cannabich) play a concerto on the violin. He  pleases me greatly. You know that I am no great lover of  difficulties. He plays difficult things, but one does not  recognize that they are difficult, but imagines that one could do  the same thing at once; that is true art. He also has a  beautiful, round tone,--not a note is missing, one hears  everything; everything is well marked. He has a fine staccato  bow, up as well as down; and I have never heard so good a double  shake as his. In a word, though he is no wizard he is a solid  violinist.\"    (Mannheim, November 22, 1777, to his father.)    62. \"Wherein consists the art of playing prima vista? In this: To  play in the proper tempo; give expression to every note,  appoggiatura, etc., tastefully and as they are written, so as to  create the impression that the player had composed the piece.\"    (Mannheim, January 17, 1778, to his father. Mozart had just been  sharply criticizing the playing of Abbe Vogler. [See No. 66.])    63. \"I am at Herr von Aurnhammer's after dinner nearly every day.  The young woman is a fright, but she plays ravishingly, though  she lacks the true singing style in the cantabile; she is too  jerky.\"    (Vienna, June 27, 1781, to his father. Beethoven found the same  fault with Mozart's playing that Mozart here condemns.)    64. \"Herr Richter plays"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4060"],[0,"The Renaissance: studies in art and poetry (#6)"],[1,"in them.  The wicked popes, and the loveless tyrants,  who from time to time became its patrons, or mere speculators in  its fortunes, lend themselves easily to disputations, and, from this  side or that, the spirit of controversy lays just hold upon them.  But the painter of the Last Supper, with his kindred, lives in a  land where controversy has no breathing-place.  They refuse to  be classified.  In the story of Aucassin and Nicolette, in the  literature which it represents, the note of defiance, of the  opposition of one system to another, is sometimes harsh.  Let me  conclude then with a morsel from Amis and Amile, in which the  harmony of human interests is still entire.  For the story of the  great traditional friendship, in which, as I said, the liberty of the  heart makes itself felt, seems, as we have it, to have been written  by a monk--La vie des saints martyrs Amis et Amile.  It was not  till the end of the seventeenth century that their names were  finally excluded from the martyrology; and their story ends with  this monkish miracle of earthly comradeship, more than faithful  unto death:--    [28] \"For, as God had united them in their lives in one accord, so  they were not divided in their death, falling together side by side,  with a host of other brave men, in battle for King Charles at  Mortara, so called from that great slaughter.  And the bishops  gave counsel to the king and queen that they should bury the  dead, and build a church in that place; and their counsel pleased  the king greatly.  And there were built two churches, the one by  commandment of the king in honour of Saint Oseige, and the  other by commandment of the queen in honour of Saint Peter.    \"And the king caused the two chests of stone to be brought in the  which the bodies of Amis and Amile lay; and Amile was carried  to the church of Saint Peter, and Amis to the church of Saint  Oseige; and the other corpses were buried, some in one place and  some in the other.  But lo! next morning, the body of Amile in his  coffin was found lying in the church of Saint Oseige, beside the  coffin of Amis his comrade.  Behold then this wondrous amity,  which by death could not be dissevered!    \"This miracle God did, who gave to His disciples power to  remove mountains.  And by reason of this miracle the king and  queen remained in that place for a space of thirty days, and  performed the offices of the dead who were slain, and honoured  the said churches with great [29] gifts.  And the bishop ordained  many clerks to serve in the church of Saint Oseige, and  commanded them that they should guard duly, with great  devotion, the bodies of the two companions, Amis and Amile.\"    1872.

Return.      PICO DELLA MIRANDOLA    [30] NO account of the Renaissance can be complete without  some notice of the attempt made by certain Italian scholars of the  fifteenth century to reconcile Christianity with the religion of  ancient Greece.  To reconcile forms of sentiment which at first  sight seem incompatible, to adjust the various products of the  human mind to one another in one many-sided type of intellectual  culture, to give humanity, for heart and imagination to feed upon,  as much as it could possibly receive, belonged to the generous  instincts of that age.  An earlier and simpler generation had seen  in the gods of Greece so many malignant spirits, the defeated but  still living centres of the religion of darkness, struggling, not  always in vain, against the kingdom of light.  Little by little, as  the natural charm of pagan story reasserted itself over minds  emerging out of barbarism, the religious significance which had  once belonged to it was lost sight of, and it came to be regarded  as the subject of a purely artistic or poetical treatment.  But it was  inevitable that from time to time minds should [31] arise, deeply  enough impressed by its beauty and power to ask themselves  whether the religion of Greece was indeed a rival of the religion  of Christ; for the older gods had rehabilitated themselves, and  men's allegiance was divided.  And the fifteenth century was an  impassioned age, so ardent and serious in its pursuit of art that it  consecrated everything with which art had to do as a religious  object.  The restored Greek literature had made it familiar, at  least in Plato, with a style of expression concerning the earlier  gods, which had about it something of the warmth and unction of  a Christian hymn.  It was too familiar with such language to  regard mythology as a mere story; and it was too serious to play  with a religion.    \"Let me briefly remind the reader\"--says Heine, in the Gods in  Exile, an essay full of that strange blending of sentiment which is  characteristic of the traditions of the middle age concerning the  pagan religions--\"how the gods of the older world, at the time of  the definite triumph of Christianity, that is, in the third century,  fell into painful embarrassments, which greatly resembled certain  tragical situations of their earlier life.  They now found  themselves beset by the same troublesome necessities to which  they had once before been exposed during the primitive ages, in  that revolutionary epoch when the Titans broke out of the custody  of Orcus, and, piling Pelion on Ossa, scaled [32] Olympus.  Unfortunate gods!  They had then to take flight ignominiously,  and hide themselves among us here on earth, under all sorts of  disguises.  The larger number betook themselves to Egypt, where  for greater security they assumed the forms of animals, as is  generally known.  Just in the same way, they had to take flight  again, and seek entertainment in remote hiding-places, when  those iconoclastic zealots, the black brood of monks, broke down  all the temples, and pursued the gods with fire and curses.  Many  of these unfortunate emigrants, now entirely deprived of shelter  and ambrosia, must needs take to vulgar handicrafts, as a means  of earning their bread.  Under these circumstances, many whose  sacred groves had been confiscated, let themselves out for hire as  wood-cutters in Germany, and were forced to drink beer instead  of nectar.  Apollo seems to have been content to take service  under graziers, and as he had once kept the cows of Admetus, so  he lived now as a shepherd in Lower Austria.  Here, however,  having become suspected on account of his beautiful singing, he  was recognised by a learned monk as one of the old pagan gods,  and handed over to the spiritual tribunal.  On the rack he  confessed that he was the god Apollo; and before his execution  he begged that he might be suffered to play once more upon the  lyre, and to sing a song.  And he played so touchingly, and sang  with such magic, and was withal so [33] beautiful in form and  feature, that all the women wept, and many of them were so  deeply impressed that they shortly afterwards fell sick.  Some  time afterwards the people wished to drag him from the grave  again, that a stake might be driven through his body, in the belief  that he had been a vampire, and that the sick women would by  this means recover.  But they found the grave empty.\"    The Renaissance of the fifteenth century was, in many things,  great rather by what it designed than by what it achieved.  Much  which it aspired to do, and did but imperfectly or mistakenly, was  accomplished in what is called the éclaircissement of the  eighteenth century, or in our own generation; and what really  belongs to the revival of the fifteenth century is but the leading  instinct, the curiosity, the initiatory idea.  It is so with this very  question of the reconciliation of the religion of antiquity with the  religion of Christ.  A modern scholar occupied by this problem  might observe that all religions may be regarded as natural  products, that, at least in their origin, their growth, and decay,  they have common laws, and are not to be isolated from the other  movements of the human mind in the periods in which they  respectively prevailed; that they arise spontaneously out of the  human mind, as expressions of the varying phases of its  sentiment concerning the unseen world; that every intellectual  product must be judged from the point of [34] view of the age  and the people in which it was produced.  He might go on to  observe that each has contributed something to the development  of the religious sense, and ranging them as so many stages in the  gradual education of the human mind, justify the existence of  each.  The basis of the reconciliation of the religions of the world  would thus be the inexhaustible activity and creativeness of the  human mind itself, in which all religions alike have their root,  and in which all alike are reconciled; just as the fancies of  childhood and the thoughts of old age meet and are laid to rest, in  the experience of the individual.    Far different was the method followed by the scholars of the  fifteenth century.  They lacked the very rudiments of the historic  sense, which, by an imaginative act, throws itself back into a  world unlike one's own, and estimates every intellectual creation  in its connexion with the age from which it proceeded.  They had  no idea of development,"]]]
