The balance of the public works money, nearly all  of it intended for state or local projects, waits only on the  presentation of proper projects by the states and localities  themselves.  Washington has the money and is waiting for the proper  projects to which to allot it.    Another pillar in the making is the Agricultural Adjustment  Administration.  I have been amazed by the extraordinary degree of  cooperation given to the government by the cotton farmers in the  South, the wheat farmers of the West, the tobacco farmers of the  Southeast, and I am confident that the corn-hog farmers of the  Middle West will come through in the same magnificent fashion.  The  problem we seek to solve had been steadily getting worse for twenty  years, but during the last six months we have made more rapid  progress than any nation has ever made in a like period of time.  It  is true that in July farm commodity prices had been pushed up  higher than they are today, but that push came in part from pure  speculation by people who could not tell you the difference between  wheat and rye, by people who had never seen cotton growing, by  people who did not know that hogs were fed on corn--people who have  no real interest in the farmer and his problems.    In spite, however, of the speculative reaction from the speculative  advance, it seems to be well established that during the course of  the year 1933 the farmers of the United States will receive 33  percent more dollars for what they have produced than they received  in the year 1932.  Put in another way, they will receive $400 in  1933, where they received $300 the year before.  That, remember, is  for the average of the country, for I have reports that some  sections are not any better off than they were a year ago.  This  applies among the major products, especially to cattle raising and  the dairy industry.  We are going after those problems as fast as we  can.    I do not hesitate to say, in the simplest, clearest language of  which I am capable, that although the prices of many products of  the farm have gone up and although many farm families are better  off than they were last year, I am not satisfied either with the  amount or the extent of the rise, and that it is definitely a part  of our policy to increase the rise and to extend it to those  products which have as yet felt no benefit.  If we cannot do this  one way we will do it another.  Do it, we will.    Standing beside the pillar of the farm--the A.A.A.--is the pillar  of industry--the N.R.A.  Its object is to put industry and business  workers into employment and to increase their purchasing power  through increased wages.    It has abolished child labor.  It has eliminated the sweat shop.  It  has ended sixty cents a week paid in some mills and eighty cents a  week paid in some mines.  The measure of the growth of this pillar  lies in the total figures of reemployment which I have already  given you and in the fact that reemployment is continuing and not  stopping.  The secret of N.R.A. is cooperation.  That cooperation has  been voluntarily given through the signing of the blanket codes and  through the signing of specific codes which already include all of  the greater industries of the nation.    In the vast majority of cases, in the vast majority of localities--  the N.R.A. has been given support in unstinted measure.  We know  that there are chiselers.  At the bottom of every case of criticism  and obstruction we have found some selfish interest, some private  ax to grind.    Ninety percent of complaints come from misconception.  For example,  it has been said that N.R.A. has failed to raise the price of wheat  and corn and hogs; that N.R.A. has not loaned enough money for  local public works.  Of course, N.R.A. has nothing whatsoever to do  with the price of farm products, nor with public works.  It has to  do only with industrial organization for economic planning to wipe  out unfair practices and to create reemployment.  Even in the field  of business and industry, N.R.A. does not apply to the rural  communities or to towns of under twenty-five hundred population,  except in so far as those towns contain factories or chain stores  which come under a specific code.    It is also true that among the chiselers to whom I have referred,  there are not only the big chiselers but also petty chiselers who  seek to make undue profit on untrue statements.    Let me cite to you the example of the salesman in a store in a  large Eastern city who tried to justify the increase in the price  of a cotton shirt from one dollar and a half to two dollars and a  half by saying to the customer that it was due to the cotton  processing tax.  Actually in that shirt there was about one pound of  cotton and the processing tax amounted to four and a quarter cents  on that pound of cotton.    At this point it is only fair that I should give credit to the  sixty or seventy million people who live in the cities and larger  towns of the nation for their understanding and their willingness  to go along with the payment of even these small processing taxes,  though they know full well that the proportion of the processing  taxes on cotton goods and on food products paid for by city  dwellers goes 100 percent towards increasing the agricultural  income of the farm dwellers of the land.    The last pillar of which I speak is that of the money of the  country in the banks of the country.  There are two simple facts.    First, the federal government is about to spend one billion dollars  as an immediate loan on the frozen or non-liquid assets of all  banks closed since January 1, 1933, giving a liberal appraisal to  those assets.  This money will be in the hands of the depositors as  quickly as it is humanly possible to get it out.    Second, the Government Bank Deposit Insurance on all accounts up to  $2500 goes into effect on January first.  We are now engaged in  seeing to it that on or before that date the banking capital  structure will be built up by the government to the point that the  banks will be in sound condition when the insurance goes into  effect.    Finally, I repeat what I have said on many occasions, that ever  since last March the definite policy of the government has been to  restore commodity price levels.  The object has been the attainment  of such a level as will enable agriculture and industry once more  to give work to the unemployed.  It has been to make possible the  payment of public and private debts more nearly at the price level  at which they were incurred.  It has been gradually to restore a  balance in the price structure so that farmers may exchange their  products for the products of industry on a fairer exchange basis.  It has been and is also the purpose to prevent prices from rising  beyond the point necessary to attain these ends.  The permanent  welfare and security of every class of our people ultimately  depends on our attainment of these purposes.    Obviously, and because hundreds of different kinds of crops and  industrial occupations in the huge territory that makes up this  Nation are involved, we cannot reach the goal in only a few months.  We may take one year or two years or three years.    No one who considers the plain facts of our situation believes that  commodity prices, especially agricultural prices, are high enough  yet.    Some people are putting the cart before the horse.  They want a  permanent revaluation of the dollar first.  It is the government's  policy to restore the price level first.  I would not know, and no  one else could tell, just what the permanent valuation of the  dollar will be.  To guess at a permanent gold valuation now would  certainly require later changes caused by later facts.    When we have restored the price level, we shall seek to establish  and maintain a dollar which will not change its purchasing and debt  paying power during the succeeding generation.  I said that in my  message to the American delegation in London last July.  And I say  it now once more.    Because of conditions in this country and because of events beyond  our control in other parts of the world, it becomes increasingly  important to develop and apply the further measures which may be  necessary from time to time to control the gold value of our own  dollar at home.    Our dollar is now altogether too greatly influenced by the  accidents of international trade, by the internal policies of other  nations and by political disturbance in other continents.  Therefore  the United States must take firmly in its own hands the control of  the gold value of our dollar.  This is necessary in order to prevent  dollar disturbances from swinging us away from our ultimate goal,  namely, the continued recovery of our commodity prices.    As a further effective means to this end, I am going to establish a  government market for gold in the United States.  Therefore, under  the clearly defined authority of existing law, I am authorizing the  Reconstruction Finance Corporation to buy gold newly mined in the  United States at prices to be determined from time to time after  consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the President.  Whenever necessary to the end in view, we shall also buy or sell  gold in the world market.    My aim in taking this step is to establish and maintain continuous  control.    This is a policy and not an expedient.    It is not to be used merely to offset a temporary fall in prices.  We are thus continuing to move towards a managed currency.    You will recall the dire predictions made last spring by those who  did not agree with our common policies of raising prices by direct  means.  What actually happened stood out in sharp contrast with  those predictions.  Government credit is high, prices have risen in  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5770"],[0,"The Rover Boys in the Jungle; Or, Stirring Adventures in Africa (#6)"],[1,"the thing at Peleg Snuggers and played at firing  it.  Supposing it had gone off and killed somebody?\"    And he shivered again.    \"Dot vos almost as pad as von Indian's schalping,\" put in Hans  faintly.  \"I dink, Tom, you vos play no more such dricks, hey?\"    \"No, I've had enough,\" replied Tom very soberly.  \"If you had been  killed or seriously hurt I would never have forgiven myself.\"  And  it may be added here that for some time after this event  fun-making and Tom were strangers to each other.    At the proper time the feast which had been planned came off, and  proved to be an event not readily forgotten.  It was no easy  matter to obtain the good things required, and the boys ran the  risk of being discovered by George Strong and punished; but by  midnight everything was ready, and soon eating was \"in full  blast,\" to use Sam's way of expressing it.    A few of the boys from the other dormitories had been invited, and  the boys took turns in standing out in the hall on guard.    \"You see,\" explained Tom, \"Mr. Strong may come in, and I won't be  able to play nightmare again, as I did last year.\"    \"Say, but that was a prime joke,\" laughed Frank.    \"And Mumps!\" cried Larry.  \"I'll never forget the orange flavored  with kerosene,\" and a general laugh followed.    Somebody had spoken of inviting Jim Caven to the feast, but no one  cared particularly for the fellow, and he had been left out.    \"Perhaps he'll tell on us,\" suggested Larry, but Frank shook his  head.    \"He hasn't got backbone enough to do it.  He's a worse coward than  Mumps was.\"    Soon it came time for Sam to do his turn at guarding, and stuffing  a big bit of candy in his mouth, the youngest Rover stepped out  into the dimly lit hallway and sat down on a low stool which one  of the guards had placed there.    For ten or fifteen minutes nothing occurred to disturb Sam, and he  was just beginning to think that watching was all nonsense when he  saw a dark figure creeping along the wall at the extreme lower end  of the hallway, where it made a turn toward the back stairs.    \"Hullo, who's that?\" he muttered.  \"It doesn't look much like Mr.  Strong.\"    He continued to watch the figure, and now saw that it was dressed  in a black suit and had what looked like a shawl over its head.    \"That's queer,\" went on the boy.  \"What can that man or boy be up  to?\"    Presently the figure turned and entered one of the lower  dormitories, closing the door gently behind it.  Then it came out  again and made swiftly for the rear of the upper hallway.   By  this time Sam was more curious than ever, and as the figure  disappeared around the bend by the back stairs he followed on  tiptoes.    But as what light there was came from the front, the rear was very  dark, and the youth could see little or nothing.  He heard a door  close and the lock click, but whether or not it was upstairs or  down he could not tell.    For several minutes he remained in the rear hallway, and then he  went back to his post.  Soon Tom came out to relieve him, and Sam  re-entered the dormitory and told his story to the others.    \"That's certainly odd,\" was Dick's comment    \"Was it a man or a boy, Sam?\"    \"I can't say exactly.  If it wasn't a man it was a pretty big  boy.\"    \"Perhaps we ought to report the matter to Captain Putnam,\"  suggested Frank.  \"That person may have been around the hallways  for no good purpose.\"    \"Oh, pshaw! perhaps it was somebody who was trying to spy on us,\"  put in Fred.  \"If we tell the captain we will only be exposing  ourselves, and I guess you all know what that means.\"    \"It means half-holidays cut off for a month,\" said Dick.    \"Besser you vait und see vot comes of dis,\" said Hans, and after a  little more talk this idea prevailed, and then the boys went in to  clear up what was left of the feast.  Everything was gone but a  little ice-cream, and it did not take long to dispose of this.    Sam was bound to have some fun, and instead of eating his last  mouthful of cream he awaited a favorable opportunity and dropped  it down inside of Fred's collar.    \"Great Scott!\" roared Fred Garrison.  \"Whow!\"  And he began to  dance around.  \"Oh, my backbone!  That's worse than a chunk of  ice!  Oh, but I'll be frozen stiff!\"    \"Go down and sit on the kitchen stove,\" suggested Dick.    \"Sit on the stove?  I'll sit on Sam's head if I get the chance!\"  roared Fred, and made a rush for Sam.  A scuffle ensued, which  came to a sudden end as both sent a washstand over with a loud  crash.    \"Wow you've done it!\" cried Frank.  \"That's noise enough to wake  the dead.\"    \"Great Caesar, stop that row!\" burst out Torn, opening the door.  \"Do you want to bring the captain down on us at the last minute?\"    \"Clear up that muss, both of you,\" said Dick to Sam and Fred.  But  the latter demurred.  It was Sam's fault--he started the racket.    \"I won't touch it.\"  And Fred proceeded to go to bed.    \"I reckon we had best dust,\" said one of the boys from another  dormitory.    \"So you had!\" burst out Tom.  \"I hear somebody coming already,\"  and in a twinkle the outsiders ran for their various quarters,  leaving the occupants of Dormitory No. 6 to fix up matters as best  they could.    It was no easy job to straighten out the washstand, clear up the  general muss, and disrobe.  But the boys were on their mettle, and  in less than two minutes the light was out and all were under the  covers, although, to be sure, Sam had his shoes still on and Tom  was entirely clothed.    \"Boys, what is the row up here?\"  The call came from Captain  Putnam himself.  He was ascending the front stairs, lamp in hand,  and attired in a long dressing gown.    As no one answered, he paused in the upper hallway and asked the  question again.  Then he looked into one dormitory after another.    \"All asleep, eh?  Well, see that you don't wake up again as soon  as my back is turned,\" he went on, and soon after walked below  again, a faint smile on his features.  He knew that boys were  bound to be more or less mischievous, no matter how strict his  regulations.    \"I'll tell you what, the captain's a brick!\" whispered Tom, as he  began to disrobe noiselessly.    \"So he is,\" answered Frank.  \"You wouldn't catch old Crabtree  acting that way.  He'd have bad every cadet out of bed and sent  half a dozen of us down to the guard-room.\"    \"I guess the captain remembers when he was a cadet himself,\"  remarked Dick.  \"I've heard that they cut up some high pranks at  West Point.\"    \"George Strong would be just as kind,\" came from Tom.  \"But say, I  am growing awfully tired.\"    \"So am I,\" came from several others,    Then the good-night word was passed, and soon all of the cadets  were sound asleep, never dreaming of the surprise which awaited  them in the morning.          CHAPTER VII    WHO WAS GUILTY?      \"Boys, I've had my trunk looted!\"    \"And I've had my trousers' pockets picked!\"    \"And the half-dollar I left on the bureau is gone!\"    Such were some of the excited exclamations which the Rover boys  heard when they went downstairs the next morning.   The speakers  were the youths who occupied Dormitories Numbers 3 and 4, at the  rear of the main upper hall.  An inquiry among the lads elicited  the information that everybody had suffered excepting one boy, who  said he had not had any money on hand.    \"I spent my last cent for the spread,\" he grinned.  \"I guess I'm  the lucky one.\"    The news of the robberies created a profound sensation throughout  Putnam Hall, and both Captain Putnam and George Strong were very  much disturbed.    \"We never had such a thing occur before,\" said the captain, and he  ordered a strict investigation.    All told, something like thirty-two dollars were missing, and also  a gold watch, a silver watch, and several shirt-studs of more or  less value.  Among the shirt-studs was one set with a ruby  belonging to a cadet named Weeks.    The investigation revealed nothing of importance.  The robbery had  been committed during the night, while the owners of the money and  the various articles slept.    \"I must get at the bottom of this affair,\" said Captain Putnam.  \"The honor of the academy is at stake.\"    He talked to all of those who had lost anything and promised to  make the matter good.  Then he asked each if he had any suspicions  regarding the thief or thieves.  No one had, and for the time  being it looked as if the case must fall to the ground.    Those who had been at the feast hardly knew what to say or to do.  Should they tell the captain of the strange figure Sam had seen in  the hallway?    \"I'll tell him, and shoulder the blame, if you fellows are  willing,\" said Sam, after a long discussion.  \"Fun is one thing,  and shielding a thief is another.\"    \"But what can you tell?\" asked Fred.  \"You do not know that that  person, was the thief.\"    \"More than likely he was,\" came from Dick.    \"And if he was, who was he?\" went on Fred.  \"If you tell Captain  Putnam you'll simply get us all into trouble.\"    \"I vote that Sam makes a clean breast of it,\" said Frank, and  Larry said the same.  This was just before dinner, and immediately  after the midday meal had been finished the youngest Rover went up  to the master of the Hall and touched him on the arm.    \"I would like to speak to you in private and at once, Captain  Putnam,\" he said.    \"Very well, Rover; come with me,\" was the reply, and Captain  Putnam led the way to his private office.    \"I suppose I should have spoken of this before,\" said Sam, when  the two were seated. \"But I didn't want to get the others into  trouble. As it is, Captain Putnam, I want to take the entire blame  on my own shoulders.\"    \"The blame of what, Samuel?\"    \"Of what I am going to tell you about.  We voted to tell you, but  I don't want to be a tattle-tale and get the others into trouble  along with me.\"    \"I will hear what you have to say,\" returned the master of the Hall  briefly.    \"Well, sir, you know"]]]
