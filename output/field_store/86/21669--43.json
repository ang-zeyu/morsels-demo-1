[FN#14] [Greek text] \"Quid novi fert Africa?\" said the Romans. \"In the  same season Fayoles, tetrarch of Numidia, sent from the land of Africa  to Grangousier, the most hideously great mare that was ever seen; for  you know well enough how it is said, that Africa always is productive  of some new thing.'\"  [FN#15] Alexandria, moreover, is an interesting place to Moslems, on  account of the prophecy that it will succeed to the honours of Meccah,  when the holy city falls into the hands of the infidel. In its turn  Alexandria will be followed by Kairawan (in the Regency of Tunis); and  this by Rashid or Rosetta, which last shall endure to the end of time.  [FN#16] A Persian as opposed to an Arab.  [FN#17] A priest, elder, chieftain, language-master, private-tutor,  &c., &c.  [FN#18] The Persians place the Prophet's tomb at Susan or Sus,  described by Ibn Haukal (p. 76). The readers of Ibn Batutah may think  it strange that the learned and pious traveller in his account of  Alexandria (chap. 2.) makes no allusion to the present holy deceased  that distinguish the city. All the saints are now clear forgotten. For  it is the fate of saints, like distinguished sinners, to die twice.  [FN#19] The Mandal is that form of Oriental divination which owes its  present celebrity in Europe to Mr. Lane. Both it and the magic mirror  are hackneyed subjects, but I have been tempted to a few words  concerning them in another part of these volumes. Meanwhile I request  the reader not to set me down as a mere charlatan; medicine in the East  is so essentially united with superstitious practices, that he who  would pass for an expert practitioner, must necessarily represent  himself an \"adept.\"  [FN#20] Hence the origin, I believe, of the Chronothermal System, a  discovery which physic owes to my old friend, the late Dr. Samuel  Dickson.  [FN#21] The Persian \"Mister.\" In future chapters the reader will see  the uncomfortable consequences of my having appeared in Egypt as a  Persian. Although I found out the mistake, and worked hard to correct  it, the bad name stuck to me; bazar reports fly quicker and hit harder  than newspaper paragraphs.  [FN#22] Arab Christians sometimes take the name of \"Abdullah,\" servant  of Allah-\"which,\" as a modern traveller observes, \"all sects and  religions might be equally proud to adopt.\" The Moslem Prophet said,  \"the names most approved of God are Abdullah, Abd-al-rahman (Slave of  the Compassionate), and such like.\"  [FN#23] \"King in-the-name-of-Allah,\" a kind of Oriental  \"Praise-God-Barebones.\" When a man appears as a Fakir or Darwaysh, he  casts off, in process of regeneration, together with other worldly  sloughs, his laical name for some brilliant coat of nomenclature rich  in religious promise.  [FN#24] A Murshid is one allowed to admit Murids or apprentices into  the order. As the form of the diploma conferred upon this occasion may  be new to many European Orientalists, I have translated it in Appendix  I.  [FN#25] The Tarikat or path, which leads, or is supposed to lead, to  Heaven.    [p.16]CHAPTER II.    I LEAVE ALEXANDRIA.    THE thorough-bred wanderer's idiosyncracy I presume to be a composition  of what phrenologists call \"inhabitiveness\" and \"locality\" equally and  largely developed. After a long and toilsome march, weary of the way,  he drops into the nearest place of rest to become the most domestic of  men. For a while he smokes the \"pipe of permanence\"[FN#1] with an  infinite zest; he delights in various siestas during the day, relishing  withal deep sleep during the dark hours; he enjoys dining at a fixed  dinner hour, and he wonders at the demoralisation of the mind which  cannot find means of excitement in chit-chat or small talk, in a novel  or a newspaper. But soon the passive fit has passed away; again a  paroxysm of ennui coming on by slow degrees, Viator loses appetite, he  walks about his room all night, he yawns at conversations, and a book  acts upon him as a narcotic. The man wants to wander, and he must do  so, or he shall die.    After about a month most pleasantly spent at Alexandria, I perceived  the approach of the enemy, and as nothing hampered my incomings and  outgoings, I surrendered. The world was \"all before me,\" and there was  pleasant excitement in plunging single-handed into its chilling depths.  My Alexandrian Shaykh, whose heart    [p.17]fell victim to a new \"jubbah,\" which I had given in exchange for  his tattered za'abut[FN#2] offered me, in consideration of a certain  monthly stipend, the affections of a brother and religious refreshment,  proposing to send his wife back to her papa, and to accompany me, in  the capacity of private chaplain to the other side of Kaf.  [FN#3] I politely accepted the \"Bruderschaft,\" but many reasons induced  me to decline his society and services. In the first place, he spoke  the detestable Egyptian jargon. Secondly, it was but prudent to lose  the \"spoor\" between Alexandria and Suez. And, thirdly, my \"brother\" had  shifting eyes (symptoms of fickleness), close together (indices of  cunning); a flat-crowned head, and large ill-fitting lips; signs which  led me to think lightly of his honesty, firmness, and courage.  Phrenology and physiognomy, be it observed, disappoint you often  amongst civilised people, the proper action of whose brain upon the  features is impeded by the external pressure of education, accident,  example, habit, and necessity. But they are tolerably safe guides when  groping your way through the mind of man in his so-called natural  state, a being of impulse, in that chrysalis condition of mental  development which is rather instinct than reason.    Before my departure, however, there was much to be done.    The land of the Pharaohs is becoming civilised, and unpleasantly so:  nothing can be more uncomfortable than its present middle state,  between barbarism and the reverse. The prohibition against carrying  arms is rigid as in Italy; all \"violence\" is violently denounced; and  beheading    [p.18]being deemed cruel, the most atrocious crimes, as well as those  small political offences, which in the days of the Mamluks would have  led to a beyship or a bow-string, receive fourfold punishment by  deportation to Fayzoghlu, the local Cayenne. If you order your peasant  to be flogged, his friends gather in threatening hundreds at your  gates; when you curse your boatman, he complains to your consul; the  dragomans afflict you with strange wild notions about honesty; a  Government order prevents you from using vituperative language to the  \"natives\" in general; and the very donkey boys are becoming cognisant  of the right of man to remain unbastinadoed. Still the old leaven  remains behind: here, as elsewhere in the \"Morning-land,\" you cannot  hold your own without employing the voie de fait. The passport system,  now dying out of Europe, has sprung up, or rather has revived, in  Egypt, with peculiar vigour.[FN#4] Its good effects claim for it our  respect; still we cannot but lament its inconvenience. By we, I mean  real Easterns. As strangers-even those whose beards have whitened in  the land-know absolutely nothing of what unfortunate natives must  endure, I am tempted to subjoin a short    [p.19]sketch of my adventures in search of a Tazkirah, or passport, at  Alexandria.    Through ignorance which might have cost me dear but for friend  Larking's weight with the local authorities, I had neglected to provide  myself with a passport in England, and it was not without difficulty,  involving much unclean dressing and an unlimited expenditure of broken  English, that I obtained from H.B.M's Consul at Alexandria a  certificate, declaring me to be an Indo-British subject named Abdullah,  by profession a doctor, aged thirty, and not distinguished-at least so  the frequent blanks seemed to denote-by any remarkable conformation of  eyes, nose, or cheek. For this I disbursed a dollar. And here let me  record the indignation with which I did it. That mighty Britain-the  mistress of the seas-the ruler of one-sixth of mankind-should charge  five shillings to pay for the shadow of her protecting wing! That I  cannot speak my modernised \"civis sum Romanus\" without putting my hand  into my pocket, in order that these officers of the Great Queen may not  take too ruinously from a revenue of seventy millions! O the meanness  of our magnificence! the littleness of our greatness!    My new passport would not carry me without the Zabit or Police  Magistrate's counter-signature, said H.B.M.'s Consul. Next day I went  to the Zabit, who referred me to the Muhafiz (Governor) of Alexandria,  at whose gate I had the honour of squatting at least three hours, till  a more compassionate clerk vouchsafed the information that the proper  place to apply to was the Diwan Kharijiyah (the Foreign Office). Thus a  second day was utterly lost. On the morning of the third I started, as  directed, for the Palace, which crowns the Headland of Clay. It is a  huge and couthless shell of building in parallelogrammic form,  containing all kinds of public offices in glorious confusion, looking  with their glaring    [p.20]white-washed faces upon a central court, where a few leafless  wind-wrung trees seem struggling for the breath of life in an eternal  atmosphere of clay-dust and sun-blaze.[FN#5]    The first person I addressed was a Kawwas[FN#6] or police officer, who,  coiled comfortably up in a bit of shade fitting his person like a robe,  was in full enjoyment of the Asiatic \"Kayf.\" Having presented the  consular certificate and briefly stated the nature of my business, I  ventured to inquire what was the right course to pursue for a visa.    They have little respect for Darwayshes, it appears, at Alexandria.    M'adri-\"Don't know,\" growled the man of authority, without moving any  thing but the quantity of tongue absolutely necessary for articulation.

[FN#32] Alluding especially to their revengefulness, and their habit of  storing up an injury, and of forgetting old friendships or benefits,  when a trivial cause of quarrel arises.  [FN#33] The sentence is passed by the Kazi: in cases of murder, he  tries the criminal, and, after finding him guilty, sends him to the  Pasha, who orders a Kawwas, or policeman, to strike off his head with a  sword. Thieves are punished by mutilation of the hand. In fact, justice  at Al-Madinah is administered in perfect conformity with the Shariat or  Holy Law.  [FN#34] Circumcisio utriusque sexus apud Arabos mos est vetustissimus.  Aiunt theologi mutilationis hujus religiosae inventricem esse Saram,  Abrahami uxorem quae, zelotypia incitata, Hagaris amorem minuendi  gratia, somnientis puellae clitoridem exstirpavit. Deinde, Allaho  jubente, Sara et Abrahamus ambo pudendorum partem cultello abscissere.  Causa autem moris in viro mundities salusque, in puella impudicitiae  prophylactica esse videntur. Gentes Asiaticae sinistra tantum manu  abluentes utuntur; omnes quoque feminarem decies magis quam virorum  libidinem aestimant. (Clitoridem amputant, quia, ut monet Aristoteles,  pars illa sedes est et scaturigo venerisrem plane profanam cum Sonninio  exclamemus!) Nec excogitare potuit philosophus quanti et quam  portentosi sunt talis mutilationis effectus. Mulierum minuuntur  affectus, amor, voluptas. Crescunt tamen feminini doli, crudelitas,  vitia et insatiabilis luxuria. (Ita in Eunuchis nonnunquam, teste  Abelardo, suberstat cerebelli potestas, quum cupidinis satiandi  facultas plane discessit.) Virilis quoque circumcisio lentam venerem et  difficilem efficit. Glandis enim mollities frictione induratur, dehinc  coitus tristis, tardus parumque vehemens. Forsitan in quibusdam populis  localis quoque causa existit; caruncula immoderate crescente,  amputationis necessitas exurgit. Deinde apud Somalos, gentem Africanam,  excisio nympharum abscissioni clitoridis adjungitur. Feminina  circumcisio in Kahira Egyptiana et El Hejazio mos est universalis. Gens  Bedouina uxorem salvam ducere nolit.Shaykh al-Nawawi de Uxore ducenda, &c.,  &c.  [FN#35] A phrase corresponding with our beaute du diable.  [FN#36] This means consulting the will of the Deity, by praying for a  dream in sleep, by the rosary, by opening the Koran, and other such  devices, which bear blame if a negative be deemed necessary. It is a  custom throughout the Moslem world, a relic, doubtless, of the Azlam or  Kidah (seven divining-arrows) of the Pagan times. At Al-Madinah it is  generally called Khirah.  [FN#37] Among respectable citizens 400 dollars would be considered a  fair average sum; the expense of the ceremony would be about half. This  amount of ready money (£150) not being always procurable, many of the  Madani marry late in life.  [FN#38] Boys are allowed to be present, but they are not permitted to  cry. Of their so misdemeaning themselves there is little danger; the  Arab in these matters is a man from his cradle.  [FN#39] They are called the Asdikah; in the singular, Sadik.  [FN#40] From what I saw at Al-Madinah, the people are not so  unprejudiced on this point as the Cairenes, who think little of selling  a book in Wakf. The subject of Wakf, however, is an extensive one, and  does not wholly exclude the legality of sale.  [FN#41] This Shaykh is a Maliki Moslem from Algiers, celebrated as an  Alim (sage), especially in the mystic study Al-Jafr. He is a Wali or  saint; but opinions differ as regards his Kiramat (saints miracles):  some disciples look upon him as the Mahdi (the forerunner of the  Prophet), others consider him a clever impostor. His peculiar dogma is  the superiority of live over dead saints, whose tombs are therefore not  to be visiteda new doctrine in a Maliki! Abbas Pasha loved and respected  him, and, as he refused all presents, built him a new Zawiyah (oratory)  at Bulak; and when the Egyptian rulers mother was at Al-Madinah, she  called upon him three times, it is said, before he would receive her.  His followers and disciples are scattered in numbers about Tripoli and,  amongst other oases of the Fezzan, at Siwah, where they saved the Abbe  Hamiltons life in A.D[.] 1843.  [FN#42] Burckhardts Travels in Arabia, vol. ii. p. 174.  [FN#43] Of which I have given an account in chapter xvi.  [FN#44] The only abnormal sound amongst the consonants heard here and  in Al-Hijaz generally is the pronouncing of k (A[rabic]) a hard gfor  instance, Guran for Kuran (a Koran), and Haggi or Hakki (my right). This g,  however, is pronounced deep in the throat, and does not resemble the  corrupt Egyptian pronunciation of the jim (j, [Arabic]), a letter which  the Copts knew not, and which their modern descendants cannot  articulate. In Al-Hijaz, the only abnormal sounds amongst the vowels  are o for u, as Khokh, a peach, and [Arabic] for [Arabic], as Ohod for  Uhud. The two short vowels fath and kasr are correctly pronounced, the  former never becoming a short e, as in Egypt (El for Al and Yemen for  Yaman), or a short i, as in Syria (min for man who? &c.) These vowels,  however, are differently articulated in every part of the Arab world.  So says St. Jerome of the Hebrew: Nec refert atrum Salem aut Salim  nominetur; cum vocalibus in medio literis perraro utantur Hebraei; et  pro voluntate lectorum, ac varietate regionum, eadem verba diversis  sonis atque accentibus proferantur.  [FN#45] e.g., Ant Zarabtthou struckedstfor Zarabta. The final vowel,  suffering apocope, would leave Zarabt equally applicable to the first  person singular and the second person singular masculine.    [p.28]CHAPTER XXII.    A VISIT TO THE SAINTS CEMETERY.    A splendid comet, blazing in the western sky, had aroused the  apprehensions of the Madani. They all fell to predicting the usual  disasterswar, famine, and pestilence,it being still an article of Moslem  belief that the Dread Star foreshows all manner of calamities. Men  discussed the probability of Abd al-Majids immediate decease; for here  as in Rome,    When beggars die, there are no comets seen:  The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes:    and in every strange atmospheric appearance about the time of the Hajj,  the Hijazis are accustomed to read tidings of the dreaded Rih  al-Asfar.[FN#l]    Whether the event is attributable to the Zu Zuwabahthe Lord of the  Forelock,or whether it was a case of post hoc, ergò, propter hoc, I would  not commit myself by deciding; but, influenced by some cause or other,  the Hawazim and the Hawamid, sub-families of the Benu-Harb, began to  fight about this time with prodigious fury. These tribes are generally  at feud, and the least provocation fans their smouldering wrath into a  flame. The Hawamid number, it is said, between three and four thousand  fighting men, and the Hawazim not more than seven hundred: the latter  however, are considered a race of desperadoes who pride themselves upon  never retreating,    [p.29]and under their fiery Shaykhs, Abbas and Abu Ali, they are a  thorn in the sides of their disproportionate foe. On the present  occasion a Hamidah[FN#2] happened to strike the camel of a Hazimi which  had trespassed; upon which the Hazimi smote the Hamidah, and called him  a rough name. The Hamidah instantly shot the Hazimi, the tribes were  called out, and they fought with asperity for some days. During the  whole of the afternoon of Tuesday, the 30th of August, the sound of  firing amongst the mountains was distinctly heard in the city. Through  the streets parties of Badawin, sword and matchlock in hand, or merely  carrying quarterstaves on their shoulders, might be seen hurrying  along, frantic at the chance of missing the fray. The townspeople  cursed them privily, expressing a hope that the whole race of vermin  might consume itself. And the pilgrims were in no small trepidation,  fearing the desertion of their camel-men, and knowing what a blaze is  kindled in this inflammable land by an ounce of gunpowder. I afterwards  heard that the Badawin fought till night, and separated after losing on  both sides ten men.    This quarrel put an end to any lingering possibility of my prosecuting  my journey to Maskat,[FN#3] as originally intended. I had on the way  from Yambu to Al-Madinah privily made a friendship with one Mujrim of  the Benu-Harb. The Sinful, as his name, ancient and classical amongst the  Arabs, means, understood that I had some motive of secret interest to  undertake the perilous journey. He could not promise at first to guide  me, as his beat lay between Yambu, Al-Madinah, Mec[c]ah, and Jeddah. But  he offered to make all inquiries about the route, and to    [p.30] bring me the result at noonday, a time when the household was  asleep. He had almost consented at last to travel with me about the end  of August, in which case I should have slipped out of Hamids house and  started like a Badawi towards the Indian Ocean. But when the war  commenced, Mujrim, who doubtless wished to stand by his brethren the  Hawazim, began to show signs of recusancy in putting off the day of  departure to the end of September. At last, when pressed, he frankly  told me that no travellernay, not a Badawicould leave the city in that  direction, even as far as historic Khaybar,[FN#4] which information I  afterwards ascertained to be correct. It was impossible to start alone,  and when in despair I had recourse to Shaykh Hamid, he seemed to think  me mad for wishing to wend Northwards when all the world was hurrying  towards the South. My disappointment was bitter at first, but  consolation soon suggested itself. Under the most favourable  circumstances, a Badawi-trip from Al-Madinah to Maskat, fifteen or  sixteen hundred miles, would require at least ten months; whereas,  under pain of losing my commission,[FN#5] I was ordered to be at Bombay"]]]
