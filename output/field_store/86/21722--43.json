[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53370"],[0,"Wastralls: A Novel (#6)"],[1," Byron's initiating them while his  wife lay at death's door.  The trifling loan which the farmer succeeded  in raising did not do more than pay the wages of the extra workmen, the  carpenters and masons he was employing; and, as time passed, and his  agent at Wadebridge began to press for the money owing, Byron found  himself awkwardly placed.  Money he must have, but when he tried to  raise it on his expectations he discovered that the security was not  considered good.  The obvious course was to tell Liddicoat to send the  bills in to Sabina; but this, as he well knew, would entail on him  unpleasant consequences.  Meanwhile the injured woman was slowly gaining  ground.  Isolda's tale had roused in her, not only the will to live, but  the will to overcome, as far as might be, the disabilities of her  condition.  In the days when she was accounted handsome she had been  without self-consciousness; and she did not develop it now that she knew  herself to be \"a poor remnant.\"  What were looks when the heart was  beating warmly and the mind was clear?  Her mutilation being the result  of accident, it did not occur to her that any one--any one to whom she  looked for love and tenderness--might find her repulsive.    After the operation was performed Byron had inquired after her welfare,  but had not come to see her.  Although so happily occupied he felt at  times a little uneasy. Sabina's attraction for him had been her flawless  health and the amputation aroused in him, not pity, but a faint stirring  of repugnance.  He sent her a message that he \"must be on the spot to  see to things,\" and, undemonstrative herself and not yet instructed as  to the nature of the \"things,\" she had accepted his excuse.  A day came,  however, when he felt that he must overcome his unwillingness to see for  himself the difference in her which the operation had made.  Liddicoat  was pressing for payment, and he had other liabilities.  He rode into  Stowe, therefore, rode at his usual breakneck pace and, having stabled  his horse, called at the hospital.    Although his visit was unexpected, Sabina had had the long leisure of a  slow convalescence in which to arrange her thoughts and make plans for  the future.  Leadville had tried to take advantage of her being ill.  He  had thought that when she recovered she would accept the changes he had  introduced.  He had acted like a child without thought of the  consequences.  The foolish fellow! Sabina was not angered.  She had  always been an indulgent wife, and she could overlook this attempt to  steal a march on her, as she had overlooked his many efforts to get the  management of the farm into his hands.    Looking neither to the right nor to the left, Byron dragged his  reluctant feet up the ward.  Sabina, who disliked sewing, and did not  care to read, had been lying back on her pillows, her hands folded on  the white sheet.  As she caught sight of the well-known figure; a little  flush of surprised pleasure spread over her pale cheeks.  She was very  glad to see him.  In her eyes his breadth and heaviness, the strong  growth of his black hair, the jut of his square chin, were so many  attractions.  She had always admired his strength; and the evidences of  it in deep chest and hairy skin were to her taste.  She could have  wished, however, that he would look up, would answer her ready smile,  instead of staring before him like a bull who is not quite certain  whether the people he is encountering are friend or foe. She had no  suspicion that every step her husband took was more unwilling than the  last.    The moment came when he must look at her.  His furtive glance swept in  one unhappy second the bed and its occupant, then he bent forward and  gave her a clumsy kiss.  The truth was not as bad as he had feared. By  some deft arrangement of the clothes the bed gave a false impression.  As far as appearances went the woman in it might have been in possession  of her limbs. Byron, escaping the shock he had expected, experienced,  however, one of a different kind.  The face he touched was indeed that  of his wife, but it was changed.  Sabina's red-gold hair, which had been  rippling and abundant, the very symbol of her gay vitality, had lost its  colour. When he last saw her a bandage had concealed it, now, white as  that bandage, it framed a face lined and haggard.    \"Why--my dear life--\" he stammered, staring, \"'ow your 'air 'av  altered.\"    She put a hand to her head.  \"Yer didn't know? Well, can't be 'elped.\"    \"Yer 'air was awful pretty.\"  The change troubled him vaguely; he was  not pleased to find that his wife, who had kept her looks beyond the  average, should have aged.    \"I reckon I'm as God made me, but I was never one to trouble about my  looks.\"  She sought for words to express her thought.  \"Red 'air or  white, I'm the same.\"    \"Iss,\" he said and continued to look at her thoughtfully.    She might be the same woman, but her effect upon others, and in  particular on himself, would be different. \"'Ow be 'ee?\"    \"I've 'ad a prettily and draggin' time, but now I'm doin' grand.\"    He uttered a rough sound of no meaning, but she took it to be  congratulatory.    \"I shall be up afore long.\"    \"Up?\" he murmured, glancing sideways at the bed.    \"I shall get Raby Gregor to make me a little trolly so that I can get  about.\"    He pushed his chair farther away.  In spite of appearances she was not a  woman, but the distorted remnant of one.  A shiver ran down his spine.  \"You bain't thinkin' of--of tryin' to get about?\"    \"Me not gettin' about?  Iss.  You've never seen me settin' down wi' me  'ands folded.\"    \"But you'll find things'll be different now,\" he stammered. He thought  of the trolly as some sort of wheel-chair. He had no conception of his  wife's inventiveness or of her indifference to comment.  \"You've been a  strong woman, but you can't look to be that again.\"    The resolute look he knew so well came into Sabina's eyes, and for a  moment he doubted whether after all she would not conquer her  disabilities.  \"I bain't strong now,\" she said, \"but a month or two'll  make all the difference.  I'll soon be up and about again.\"    The momentary doubt passed.  \"I wouldn't make too sure of that, then,\"  he told her.  The fact that Wastralls had not so much flat land as would  make a football field was reassuring.  No wheel-chair, whatever the  power of its directing will, could climb up and down those fields.    \"I'm hopin',\" said Sabina obstinately, \"to teel Wastralls as I 'av  before.\"    \"We must see 'ow you do frame.\"    \"Bain't a matter of gettin' about,\" she continued, guessing his  thoughts.  \"I know Wastralls like the palm of my hand, every 'itch and  stitch of it, and the 'inds'll carry out my orders.  I can trust old  George Biddick to see as the others do their work.  I've planned it  all.\"    \"And me?\" asked Leadville grimly.    \"My dear feller, you don't like farmin', you wouldn't make no 'and at  it, you an' your old rigmaroles.\"    \"I c'd teel Wastralls so as it brought in double what you get now.\"    She shook her head.  \"You bain't goin' to try.\"    It was as well for her peace of mind that eyes cannot speak.  That this  mutilated trunk of a woman should still be in a position to withstand  him!  His great chest heaved with bitter emotion, but he did not answer.    \"Come,\" said Sabina peaceably.  \"Tell me how things is going.\"    He stared out of the window until he had mastered himself sufficiently  to speak.  \"I came to ask mun for what you aw Liddicoat.\"    \"Aw Liddicoat?\"  A smiling light came into her eyes.  \"How much do I  aw'n?\"    \"Couldn't tell 'ee for a pound or two; but if you was to draw out a  cheque for me I could full'n soon as I get 'ome.\"    \"You send me in the bill and I'll pay'n after I've checked'n.\"    Byron's face darkened.  He would not be able to hide from her much  longer the changes he had attempted. What did it matter?  She could only  be angry.  He thought he would be glad if she were.  \"There's the men's  money--three weeks 'awin'.\"    \"I give'n Isolda yesterday.  I expect she's paid'n by now.\"    \"You ought to 'ave give it to me and I could 'av paid'n.\"    \"So I should 'av,\" she answered peaceably, \"if you'd been in to see me.  But I give it to Isolda instead.\"    He was not to be placated.  \"Looks mighty queer you don't trust me with  the money.  I've to keep the place goin' and if I don't pay the 'inds  who's to know I'm maister?\"    \"There's no need, for you bain't maister.  You may blate morning till  night, you won't 'av Wastralls, no never for, come to that, I don't  trust 'ee.\"    \"S'bina!\"    She held up her hand.  \"You do take too much on your own 'ead.\"    He knew then that the tale of his imprudent labours had run before him  and that she was expressing her disapproval.  She was not angry with  him; a mother is not angry when she sequestrates a forbidden toy.  \"I  always thought,\" he stammered, making no further mystery of the matter,  \"that we should grow sugar-beet.\"    \"An' you was welcome to try it--at Polnevas.  Now come, it bain't too  late to put the li'l medder in dredge-corn.  You'd better see to't at  once, or I'll 'av Tom do't.\"    He cried out at that last humiliation and it was still the same cry, the  cry his wife thought so unreasonable. \"You'd put Tom Rosevear over me?  You'd take away what belong to me?\"    \"'Long to you?  I should like to know 'ow it come yours.\"    \"You give it me, you give it me when we married.\"    \"Never.\"    In his disappointment and rage he stumbled over his words.  \"You'll see,  you'll see!  Iss, you'll see whether I won't 'av it or no.\"    \"'Tis mazedness of 'ee to think so,\" she answered. \"Come, be sensible.  I'll pay for these old fads of yours and you can pile'n away where you  mind to.  I'll pay this once, but 'twas a fulish game for 'ee to play  and maybe you'll see that before you'm done.\"                                       *CHAPTER III*      Near St."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53372"],[0,"Star of India (#6)"],[1,"and throwing the skins about! It seemed he was collecting  them for Stella, who, bent double, was robbing the bushes--such an  ungainly attitude for a young lady.    \"Stella!\" called Aunt Ellen in reproof, \"you are tearing your frock!\"    The child looked a disgraceful object as she emerged from the nets; a  long rent in one of her sleeves disclosed a round white arm with a red  scratch in the flesh, her face was crimson, her hair in disorder, she  was covered with twigs and bits, and her mouth was sticky with  gooseberry juice. Laughing, she held out her skirt, like an apron, for  the fruit that filled Colonel Crayfield's large mahogany-coloured hands.    Ellen felt truly ashamed of her niece. What would Colonel Crayfield be  thinking of his goddaughter, and of the way in which she had been  brought up! Had Ellen observed the look in Colonel Crayfield's eyes at  the moment, she would probably have mistaken it for astonished  disapproval; as it was, she only observed that he gazed at Stella in  silence, at the shining hair that fell over her forehead, at the  wide-open brown eyes, thickly lashed and full of mischief, at the  flushed cheeks and parted lips, that showed a row of faultless little  teeth, and at the red scratch on the white forearm.    Stella, unabashed, proffered her skirt, full of fruit, to her aunt. \"Do  have some, Aunt Ellen,\" she cried joyously. \"They're ripping, especially  the big, hairy fellows.\"    \"You will spoil your dinner,\" said Aunt Ellen severely, \"as you have  already spoilt your frock.\"    \"Like little Miss Jane,\" and Stella chanted:           \"Greedy, greedy little Miss Jane,       I'll never give _her_ a present again.       She spent her sixpence on raspberry rock,       And spoilt her dinner as well as her frock.\"      Colonel Crayfield actually laughed; moreover, he accepted a gooseberry  from Stella's grubby fingers and ate it fastidiously, burying the skin  in the mould with the toe of his boot.    That evening grandmamma's hopes ran high. Augusta sent Stella to bed  early, and afterwards Colonel Crayfield listened, apparently entranced,  while Ellen played the piano--played \"Yorkshire Bells\" and \"The Village  Blacksmith.\"          CHAPTER III      Very early next morning Colonel Crayfield was awakened by a crash. His  bedroom was alight with the dawn; the lemon scent of magnolia blossom  floated in at the open window. What had aroused him? Involuntarily he  glanced at the tea-tray, at the big teapot and breakfast cup for which  he had Miss Ellen to thank; then he became aware of a curious sound, and  sitting up he beheld the milk-jug in fragments on the floor and a cat  complacently lapping the milk that had spread in a pool on the carpet.  In a fury he sprang from the bed, clapping his hands, shouting at the  thief; the cat, ears back, tail on end, made for the window and  disappeared in a flash; he could hear her scrambling down the magnolia  tree. What about his tea! He hated tea without milk, and probably the  household would not be astir for hours. He formed a bold project--he  would go downstairs and forage for more milk. No one need hear him; he  could explain, relate the disaster at breakfast. Slippers on his feet,  and a coat over his sleeping-suit, he crept into the long, low passage.  All was still. But the stairs! The stairs might have been actually alive  and the banisters too; how they did creak! It was a relief to arrive at  the foot of the staircase without having aroused the household. Now  there was a green baize door that evidently gave on to the kitchen  quarters; it yielded silently to his push, and he was confronted with a  short flight of stone steps. At any rate, _they_ could not creak.  Quickly descending them, he found himself in a large, old-fashioned  kitchen, stone-paved; beyond, surely, was the larder where milk might be  found, if the cat had not been there before him. How different it all  was from Indian establishments; in India, whether as a guest or in one's  own house, one could demand tea at any hour of the night or day, and it  was forthcoming as a matter of course; in India----    \"Hallo!\"    Colonel Crayfield jumped ingloriously, and only just saved himself from  swearing aloud. His goddaughter was standing in the larder doorway, a  cup in one hand, a crust of bread in the other. She had the advantage of  him in the matter of toilet, being fully dressed in a blue washing frock  that fell in straight lines from her neck to her ankles, and a wide  straw hat bound with a ribbon of the same colour.    They looked at each other, amazed. Colonel Crayfield drew his coat  closer about him, and passed his hand mechanically over his hair.    \"Good gracious!\" he said resentfully.    \"Did you hear me go down?\" she inquired.    \"No; but I wonder you didn't hear _me_! The stairs made such a  confounded noise.\"    \"Yes, I know; aren't they awful! I always expect Aunt Augusta to burst  from her room with a poker in her hand. Were you looking for something  to eat?\"    \"I was looking for some milk,\" he admitted; \"a cat got into my room and  knocked down the milk-jug. I don't like tea without milk.\"    \"I expect it was Granny.\"    \"_Granny?_\" repeated Colonel Crayfield, mystified.    Stella laughed. \"Not my grandmother! Was it an old black-and-white cat  with a very long tail?\"    \"I really did not notice. Anyway, the brute broke the jug and was  drinking the milk----\"    \"Here you are then,\" she handed him a jug.    He took it. \"But have you all you want yourself?\" he inquired politely.    \"Heaps,\" she replied, munching her crust. \"Have a piece of bread? It's  lovely--home made. I only wish I had an onion, too. Don't you love  onions?\"    \"I don't object to them----\" he began; then suddenly the unfitness of  the situation came home to him with something of a shock. Here was he,  the ruler of a vast area in India, accustomed to ceremony and  circumstance and state, pilfering a larder with a chit of a  girl--discussing onions, of all things; and further than that he was not  dressed! It might have been a silly dream.    \"And what are you doing down here at this extraordinary hour?\" he asked  of his goddaughter with what dignity was left to him.    \"Eating and drinking, as you can see,\" was her flippant reply. Then, as  though conscious that she was perhaps not treating Colonel Crayfield  quite with the respect that was his due, she added primly: \"I often get  up very early and go for a ramble\"; she hesitated, and continued with  diffidence, \"would you care to come for a walk instead of going to bed  again?\"    \"Well, I can't come as I am; but if you will wait till I've had my tea  and dressed----\"    \"Of course I'll wait! I'll leave the side door open and you'll find me  outside.\"    Later, when he joined her, his self-respect as Commissioner of Rassih  restored, he said: \"Indian life would suit you, since you are so fond of  early rising. In India I am nearly always out soon after daybreak.\"    Stella sighed. \"Oh! India--how I should love to go there!\"    \"Really? What about the heat and the exile and the insects?\"--and he  added playfully--\"not to speak of snakes and tigers!\"    \"I'm not afraid of anything!\" bragged Stella, and with the elimination  of grandmamma this was true enough. \"If it comes to exile, what could be  worse than life at The Chestnuts--where nothing ever happens, and  nothing will ever happen!\"    Now they were out of the garden, out on a common that was ablaze with  gorse--the spongy turf was silvered with dew, the air fragrant and  fresh; birds' voices, the distant lowing of cattle, echoed in the sweet  stillness.    \"But some day you will marry,\" prophesied Colonel Crayfield, in a tone  of encouragement.    \"Marry!\" derided Stella. \"Who is there for me to marry?\" She thought of  Miss Spurt and of the young porter at the railway station.    He made no answer; he was appraising the slim, young form beside him,  marking the grace of her limbs, the poise of the little head on the  long, round neck, the clean turn of ankle and wrist--every point was  good; in a couple of years she must be a magnificent woman.    \"What are you thinking about?\" inquired Stella. \"Here we are at the end  of the common and you've hardly spoken a word. Are you tired?\"    \"Tired? Certainly not! It would take rather more than a walk across a  common to tire _me_!\" He stepped out with vigour.    \"What long strides you are taking. Hadn't we better have a race while we  are about it? See that oak tree over there--at the edge of the wood? I  bet you I'll get there first. One, two, three--off!\"    And the Commissioner of Rassih, who could still hold his own at tennis  and rackets, accepted the challenge. The race ended in a dead heat.    Stella flung herself down beneath the oak tree, and Colonel Crayfield  took a seat, formed by the roots, beside her. The fact that he was  scarcely out of breath pleased him.    \"Anyway, you can run!\" pronounced Stella.    \"Why not?\" he demanded.    \"Oh, I don't know.\" She was politely evasive; it would hardly do to  explain that such agility in anyone of his age and bulk had surprised  her, and she hastened to change the subject. \"Now, do let us talk about  India\"--she looked up at him with eager, bright eyes--\"you don't know  how I long to see India. I suppose it's in my blood; all the Carringtons  did things in India, and if I had been a boy I should have gone out to  do things, too. I am the last young Carrington left--and I am only a  girl!\"    Colonel Crayfield took off his hat and ran his fingers through his  thick, grey hair; he was proud of its thickness; most men of his age in  India were hopelessly bald.    \"India isn't what it was; the spirit of romance and adventure has gone,  the pagoda tree is dead, prices are rising, and exchange is falling----\"    \"But haven't you lovely big houses?\" interrupted Stella, \"and heaps of  servants and horses, and the sun and gardens and fruit? What is your  bungalow"]]]
