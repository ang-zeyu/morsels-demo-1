As we have said, the first pigeon to hatch in the nest is almost  invariably a cock and the last one a hen. This rule is so constant that  it may be depended upon.    In selecting squabs for breeding stock, always select those from the  nests of pairs which produce squabs most regularly. Such squabs are more  likely to be good producers themselves.    Select the squabs which grow most rapidly and weigh the most at the time  they are ready for the market. Such squabs are from pairs which are good  feeders and will be most likely to become good feeders themselves.    Be sure to select squabs which have light-colored flesh, as these will  produce squabs like themselves and light flesh brings the highest price  in the market, unless they are sent in too soon.    When we say the light color in flesh of a squab denotes that it will  produce light-fleshed squabs, it is to be understood that this will be  the case if the parents are properly fed according to directions given  in a previous chapter. Pigeons which are kept confined and properly fed  always produce more and better squabs than those allowed to run at  large.    Having selected the squabs which are to be retained for breeding  purposes, band them at once. Open pigeon bands can be bought at about a  cent each. The best plan is to band the cocks right leg and the hens on  the left, using consecutive numbers for each pair.    Thus, 111 might be a cock and 112 hen. In making matings, the owner  would know at once that these two were not to be allowed to mate  together, as they would be brother and sister. If, in any case, nest  mates show inclination to mate together, they should be shut away from  each other, and forced to mate with non-related birds.    A forced mating is made by using a mating pen. This is a cage with two  compartments in it, separated by a wire screen, such as two-inch mesh  poultry netting. Put the cock in one side and the hen with which you  want him to mate in another, and leave them in the pen until they are  acquainted with each other. Then shut them in the same compartment and  usually they will mate up with each other all right.    Squabs which are to be kept for breeding should be taken away from the  older birds as soon as they have learned to eat for themselves. Feed  them well all the time, and at the age of about six months they will  begin to mate and then require regular attention, as they should be kept  under close supervision at this time.    As soon as a male bird is seen \"driving\" a female, both should be caught  and their bands examined. If they are nest mates they should be  separated as recommended in the beginning of this chapter and forced to  mate with other birds. It will only be necessary to remove the cock  bird, substituting another cock in his place.    If the cock and the hen he is driving are not nest mates, their band  numbers should be recorded in a book kept for this purpose. Such a  record gives the owner an opportunity to keep account of the number of  squabs a given pair produces and to pick squabs for breeding in the  future, knowing what the parents have done.    The record should give the number of the cock and hen and a brief  description of each. The following form is recommended: Cock 111--Red  Check, Hen 222--Blue Bar.    Each pair should have a space in which to keep account with it. After  the number and description may be a ruled space in which to keep account  of the number of squabs the pair produces month after month. If they  regularly produce and raise two squabs of good size and light color,  they are valuable as the parents of breeding stock and should be kept.    If a pair does not produce squabs, the chances are then the hen is  barren and she would be sold for what she will bring in the market and  the cock mated with another bird. If the eggs are infertile, the trouble  is likely with the cock and the matings should be broken and two birds  tried again. If the eggs still are infertile, the cock should be sold in  the market.    Usually there are more cocks than hens in a given lot of squabs and it  is easier to give a hen which lays infertile eggs a new mate and sell  the cock without experimenting further.    Barren hens and impotent cocks are not common in well bred birds, and  very little trouble may be anticipated from such causes.    When one of a pair of squabs dies, the chances are about nine out of ten  that the female of the pair dies. This is because she is two days  younger than her brother and has less chance to get a start. Thus it  happens that every loft produces more cocks than hens, a circumstance  which has led some of the hucksters who sell pigeons as squab-raisers to  send out lots of birds in which there were many more cocks than hens.  This is why we have insisted that the buyer should buy from a reliable  breeder and buy mated pairs.    In a loft containing fifty young cocks and fifty young hens it almost  always happens that the matings are not all made up, as some birds  refuse to mate with certain other ones, and there may be a few birds  which have not mated. In this case the odd birds may be put among other  young birds and so find mates that suit them.    In catching pairs at the time they are being recorded, or when they are  to be sold as breeders, two people should do the work. A catching net,  which is a netted bag the mouth of which is fastened to a hoop with a  long handle, is used. The pigeon breeder soon gets so expert that he can  trap a pigeon in such net without fail and without disturbing the other  birds in the loft.    When a couple of pigeons is found driving, the one who does the catching  traps one of them with the net while his helper keeps watch on the other  one of the pair. The captured pigeon is examined and its band number put  on the record. Then the helper takes the net and catches the one he has  been watching and the band number is taken, always remembering that a  bird with a band on the right leg is a cock and one with a band on the  left is a hen.    If the method here recommended is followed, the pigeon-keeper will be  able to know just what each pair of birds is doing and keep a pedigree  of every bird in his flock by a simple method of bookkeeping as follows:    When the squabs that are to be kept as breeders are being banded the  band numbers of the parent birds should be taken and set down in this  way:      Squab numbers       Parent numbers      Cock 111                84-67    Hen 112                 84-67    In making this record the number under the head \"Parent numbers\" is  always set down in the same way, the name of the father first and the  mother next.    It is but very little trouble to keep such records and the value of them  is very great, for the pigeon-keeper can refer to his records at any  time and find how any bird that was hatched in his lofts has been bred.    This enables him to select the best producers and feeders and improve  his stock all the time, selling off its inferior ones and keeping up a  high standard, which will in time give him a reputation for squabs or  breeding stock that will be valuable to him, as he will get higher  prices than he could get for ordinary stock.    On a large plant this method means an endless amount of bookkeeping work  so it has not been attempted. The largest breeders do not bother to band  their birds or keep a record of squab production for each individual  pair but usually have a pen of select breeders that have proven their  worth and from these are raised the new breeders to replenish or  increase the flocks.    When a bird dies out of the working flock it is dissected to determine  the sex and another of the same sex is placed in the fly to mate with  the odd bird. These two soon get together and the fly is once more  filled with mated, contented workers.          CHAPTER VI    MAKING A MARKET--PREPARING SQUABS FOR MARKET      We make one of the sub-heads of this chapter, \"Making a Market,\"  although the market for squabs is already established, and the demand  for them in the larger cities is constantly increasing.    Notwithstanding this, the enterprising squab-breeder will make his own  market and get better prices than he can get if he sends his squabs to  the larger cities.    In the beginning he may be obliged to ship to the cities, but he can  build up a home trade among those who like to have the best the market  affords and by degrees his home demand will grow until he will find a  ready sale nearby and will be saved freight and commission charges as  well as the cost and trouble of packing and icing for the longer  shipments.    We know of numerous cases where squab-breeders have built up a home  demand which takes all the squabs and brings them high prices the year  around.    Very often the enterprising beginner will turn his attention to raising  squabs to sell to others for breeding purposes, and finds this very  profitable, although a good market for squabs is about the same as a  good demand for breeding stock. Other squab breeders arrange to sell  their young stock to those who do breed pigeons to sell as breeding  stock and thus have a regular and constant demand for their young birds.    All these ways of disposing of the increase of the loft are open to the  beginner, but the food market is the one that should be cultivated. We  know of a case where a beginner started in with a view of selling  breeding stock only, as he thought he was not so located that he would  have any demand for his squabs in the handiest market, a small interior  city, where squabs had never been put on sale.    After he got started he found that he could sell a few pairs of squabs  to one or two restaurants and the best hotel in the town. He began  supplying orders from these places and others began to call on him for  squabs for special occasions, such as local banquets, receptions and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37904"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 4, No. 4, November 1, 1851 (#6)"],[1,"the  latter, we shall content ourselves with remarking, that even the  disposition to deny the existence of imperfection among us, redounds far  more to our credit, than the complacent exaltation of our weaker points to  virtues; while as to the former, we are certain that a higher feeling than  mere nervous, sensitive vanity, induces in us the desire        \"To see ourselves as others see us,\"    since there is no nation which more readily avails itself of the remarks of  others, even when by far too bitter or unjust to improve. True to our  national character of youthfulness, we are ever ready to act on every hint.  We are, _par excellence_, a _learning_ nation. Send even the _young_  Englishman on his continental tour, and the chances are ten to one that he  returns with every prejudice strengthened, and his vanity increased. But  the American--ductile as wax, evinces himself even at an advanced period of  life, susceptible of improvement, yet firm in its retention. That we  earnestly strive in every respect to improve is evident from many \"little  things\" which foreigners ridicule. For instance, the habitual use of \"fine  language,\" and the attempt to clothe even our ordinary trains of thought in  an elegant garb, which has been time and again cruelly ridiculed by Yankee  goaders, is to a reflecting mind suggestive of commendation, from the very  fact, that an attempt at least is made _to improve_. Better a thousand  times the impulse to progress, even through the whirlwinds of hyperbole and  inflated expression, than the heavy miasma of a patois, the lightest breath  of which at once proclaims the cockney or provincial.    For the entertainment of those who are willing to live, laugh, and learn,  we are induced to give our readers a few extracts from a recently published  work, by a German, entitled, _Skizzen aus den Vereinigten Staaten von Nord  Amerika: Von_ DR. A. KIRSTEN, (or, _Sketches of the United States of North  America_, by Dr. A. KIRSTEN,) a work in which the author, after exhausting  all the three-penny thunder of ignorant abuse, coolly informs his readers,  that he has by no means represented things in their worst light. The  American public at large are not aware that among the rulers of Germany,  emigration to America is sternly yet anxiously discouraged. Rejoiced as  they are to behold our country a receptacle for the sweepings of their  prisons and _Fuchthaueser_, or houses of correction, they still gaze with an  alarmed glance at the almost incredible \"forth-wandering\" which has at  times depopulated entire villages, and borne with it an amount of wealth,  which, trifling as it may appear to us, is in a land of economy and poverty  of immense importance. The reader who judges of Germany by Great Britain  and Ireland, is mistaken. That emigration which is to the government of the  latter countries health and safety, brings to the former death and  destruction. As a proof of this, we need only point to the tone of all the  German papers which are in any manner connected with the interests of their  respective courts. In all we find the old song: Depreciation of America, as  far as applicable to the prevention of emigration. To accomplish this end,  writers are hired and poets feed; remedies against emigration are proposed  by political economists, and where possible, even clergymen are induced to  persuade their flocks to nibble still in the ancient stubble, or among the  same old barren rocks.    Dr. Kirsten, it would appear, is either a natural and habitual grumbler, or  a paid hireling. If the former, we can only pity--if the latter, despise  him. Could our voice be heard by his patrons, we would, however, advise  them to employ a better grumbler--one who can wield lance and sword against  his foes, instead of mops and muddy water. A weaker lancer, or more  impotent and impudent abuser, has rarely appeared, even among our earlier  English decriers.    Like many other weak-minded individuals, the Herr Doctor appears to have  started under the fullest conviction that our country was, if not a true  \"_Schlaraffen Land_,\" or _Pays de Cocagne_, or Mahomet's Paradise, in which  pigeons ready roasted fly to the mouth, at least a realized _Icarie_, or  perfected Fourier-dom. All the books which he had read, relative to  America, described it in glowing colors, and inclined his mind favorably  toward it. Such was his faith in these books, or also so great his fear,  that these glorious dreams might be dissipated, that he did not even  ascertain or confirm their truth by the personal experience of those who  had been there, and we are informed naively enough in the preface, that  previous to his departure he had but once had an opportunity of conversing  with an educated German, who had resided for a long time in America. Such  weak heedlessness as this does not, to our ears at least, savor of the  characteristic prudence and deliberation of the German, and strongly  confirms us in the belief, that the doctor wandered forth well knowing what  he was about--in other words, that he went his way with his opinions  already cut and dried.    \"After an eight weeks' voyage I arrived in New-York. It was at the end of  August. Even in the vicinity of the Gulf Stream a terrible heat oppressed  us, which increased as we approached land; but it was in that city that I  became aware of what the heat in America really was. Many visits which I  was obliged to make, caused during the day a cruel exhaustion, while at  night I found no refreshment in slumber, partly because the heat was hardly  diminished, and partly from the musquitoes, and to me unaccustomed alarms  of fire, which were nightly repeated, from which I found that life in  America was by no means so agreeable as I had been led to infer from books  and popular report.\"    From the single, mysterious, educated German with whom the doctor had  conferred previous to his departure, he had learned that, in the United  States, any thing like marked distinction of class, rank, or caste, did not  exist; and that this was particularly the case among Germans living there.  \"The educated and refined knew how to draw into their society the less  gifted, and it was really singular to observe in how short a time the  latter rose to a higher degree of culture. People actually destitute of  knowledge and manners, in fact could not be found. Moreover, I there  anticipated a southern climate, for which I had some years longed.\"    How miserably the poor doctor was disappointed in these moderate and  reasonable anticipations, appears from the following lamentable account:    \"Ere long I, indeed, became acquainted with many Germans, who received me  in the kindest manner, and of whom recollections will ever be dear to me.  But this was not the case with the Americans, as I had been led to  anticipate, nor indeed with the Germans, generally. Among these I found  neither connection nor unity, and they mostly led a life such as I had in  Germany never met with, while nothing like social cultivation, in a higher  sense, was to be found. Led into the society of those who by day were  devoted to business, but in the evening scattered themselves, here and  there, without a point of union, I found myself in the noisy, but  pleasure-wanting city, forlorn and unwell. Many, to whom I complained of  what I missed in New-York, thought that it might be found in Philadelphia.\"    But even in Philadelphia our pilgrim found not the promised Paradise, where  there was no distinction of rank or family, and where the more educated and  refined would eagerly adopt him, the lowly brother, into their Icarian  circle. Neither did he discover the golden tropical region--the southern  heaven--for which his soul had longed for years. Alas! no. \"After a  residence of four weeks in New-York, I repaired to Philadelphia, and there  found that among the Germans, things were the same as in New-York--_in  fact, there was even less unity among them_.\" But although the doctor did  not discover any Germans inspired with the sublime spirit of harmony, he  certainly appears to have met with several who had acquired the American  virtue of common sense.    \"A German who had been for a long time resident in the United States  asserted that he had, as yet, met with no fellow-countryman, who had been  in the beginning satisfied with America. Others were of the opinion, that I  would first be pleased with the country when I had found a profitable  employment. _And some others, that I would never be satisfied._\"    And so the doctor, ever dependent on others for happiness, looked here and  there, like the pilgrim after Aden, or the hero of the Morning Watch, for  the ideal of his dreams. The so-called entirely German towns in  Pennsylvania were German only in name. The heat disgusted him with the  south--the cold with the north. After residing nine months in Poughkeepsie,  he returned to New-York, and there remained for some time, occupied, as it  would appear, solely with acquiring information. This residence at an end,  he returned to Germany.    We pass over the first chapters of his work, devoted to an ordinary account  of the climate, animals, and plants of the country, to a more interesting  picture, namely--its inhabitants. From this we learn that the American is  cold, dry, and monosyllabic, in his demeanor and conversation. During his  return to Germany he was delayed for a period of something less than nine  days at Falmouth, England, where, during his daily walks, he experienced  that in comparison with us the English are amiable, communicative, and  agreeable. Indeed, he found that when, during a promenade in America,  strangers returned his greetings, these polite individuals were invariably  Britons, \"which proves that while in more recent times, the English have  assumed or approached the customs of other nations, the Americans have  remained true to the character and being of the earlier"]]]
