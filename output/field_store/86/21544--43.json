Edmund therefore checked his footsteps and awaited the  arrival of the fugitive, who he now felt certain was his kinsman.    In a few minutes Egbert came up, having slackened his speed  considerably when he saw that he was no longer pursued. He was bleeding  from several wounds, and now that the necessity for exertion had passed  he walked but feebly along. Without a word he flung himself on the  ground by Edmund and buried his face in his arms, and the lad could see  by the shaking of his broad shoulders that he was weeping bitterly. The  great hound walked up to the prostrate figure and gave vent to a long  and piteous howl, and then lying down by Egbert's side placed his head  on his shoulder.          CHAPTER III: THE MASSACRE AT CROYLAND      Edmund wept sorely for some time, for he knew that his kinsman's  agitation could be only caused by the death of his father. At last he  approached Egbert.    \"My brave kinsman,\" he said, \"I need ask you no questions, for I know  but too well that my dear father has fallen; but rouse yourself, I pray  you; let me bandage your wounds, which bleed fast, for you will want  all your strength, and we must needs pursue our way well into the  forest, for with to-morrow's dawn the Danes will scatter over the whole  country.\"    \"Yes,\" Egbert said, turning round and sitting up, \"I must not in my  grief forget my mission, and in truth I am faint with loss of blood. It  was well the Danes stopped when they did, for I felt my strength  failing me, and could have held out but little further. Yes, Edmund,\"  he continued, as the lad, tearing strips from his garments, proceeded  to bandage his wounds, \"your father is dead. Nobly, indeed, did he  fight; nobly did he die, with a circle of dead Danes around him. He,  Algar, Toley, and myself were the last four to resist. Back to back we  stood, and many were the Danes who fell before our blows. Toley fell  first and then Algar. The Danes closed closer around us. Still we  fought on, till your father was beaten to his knee, and then he cried  to me, 'Fly, Egbert, to my son.' Then I flung myself upon the Danes  like a wild boar upon the dogs, and with the suddenness of my rush and  the heavy blows of my battle-axe cut a way for myself through them. It  was well-nigh a miracle, and I could scarce believe it when I was free.  I flung away my shield and helmet as soon as I had well begun to run,  for I felt the blood gushing out from a dozen wounds, and knew that I  should want all my strength. I soon caught sight of you running ahead  of me. Had I found we were gaining upon you I should have turned off  and made another way to lead the Danes aside, but I soon saw that you  were holding your own, and so followed straight on. My knees trembled,  and I felt my strength was well-nigh gone, when, looking round, I found  the Danes had desisted from their pursuit. I grieve, Edmund, that I  should have left the battle alive when all the others have died  bravely, for, save a few fleet-footed youths, I believe that not a  single Saxon has escaped the fight; but your father had laid his  commands upon me, and I was forced to obey, though God knows I would  rather have died with the heroes on that field.\"    \"'Tis well for me that you did not, my good Egbert,\" Edmund said,  drying his eyes, \"for what should I have done in this troubled land  without one protector?\"    \"It was the thought of that,\" Egbert said, \"that seemed to give me  strength as I dashed at the Danes. And now, methinks, I am strong  enough to walk again. Let us make our way far into the forest, then we  must rest for the night. A few hours' sleep will make a fresh man of  me, and to-morrow morning we will go to Croyland and see what the good  abbot your uncle proposes to do, then will we to the hut where we dwelt  before coming hither. We will dig up the chest and take out such  valuables as we can carry, and then make for Wessex. After this day's  work I have no longer any hope that East Anglia will successfully  oppose the Danes. And yet the Angles fought well, and for every one of  them who has fallen in these two days' fighting at least four Danes  must have perished. Have you food, Edmund, for in truth after such a  day's work I would not lie down supperless?\"    \"I have in my pouch here, Egbert, some cakes, which I cooked this  morning, and a capon which one of the monks of Croyland gave me. I was  tempted to throw it away as I ran.\"    \"I am right glad, Edmund, that the temptation was not too strong for  you. If we can find a spring we shall do well.\"    It was now getting dark, but after an hour's walk through the forest  they came upon a running stream. They lit a fire by its side, and  sitting down ate the supper, of which both were in much need. Wolf  shared the repast, and then the three lay down to sleep. Egbert,  overcome by the immense exertions he had made during the fight, was  soon asleep; but Edmund, who had done his best to keep a brave face  before his kinsman, wept for hours over the loss of his gallant father.    On the following morning Egbert and Edmund started for Croyland. The  news of the defeat at Kesteven had already reached the abbey, and  terror and consternation reigned there. Edmund went at once to his  uncle and informed him of the circumstance of the death of his father  and the annihilation of the Saxon army.    \"Your news, Edmund, is even worse than the rumours which had reached  me, and deeply do I grieve for the loss of my brave brother and of the  many valiant men who died with him. This evening or to-morrow the  spoilers will be here, and doubtless will do to Croyland as they have  done to all the other abbeys and monasteries which have fallen into  their hands. Before they come you and Egbert must be far away. Have you  bethought you whither you will betake yourselves?\"    \"We are going to the king of the West Saxons,\" Edmund replied. \"Such  was my father's intention, and I fear that all is now lost in East  Anglia.\"    \"'Tis your best course, and may God's blessing and protection rest upon  you!\"    \"But what are you going to do, uncle? Surely you will not remain here  until the Danes arrive, for though they may spare other men they have  no mercy on priests and monks?\"    \"I shall assuredly remain here, Edmund, at my post, and as my brother  Eldred and Earl Algar and their brave companions died at their posts in  the field of battle, so I am prepared to die here where God has placed  me. I shall retain here with me only a few of the most aged and infirm  monks, too old to fly or to support the hardships of the life of a  hunted fugitive in the fens; together with some of the children who  have fled here, and who, too, could not support such a life. It may be  that when the fierce Danes arrive and find nought but children and aged  men even their savage breasts may be moved to pity; but if not, God's  will be done. The younger brethren will seek refuge in the fens, and  will carry with them the sacred relics of the monastery. The most holy  body of St. Guthlac with his scourge and psalmistry, together with the  most valuable jewels and muniments, the charters of the foundation of  the abbey, given by King Ethelbald, and the confirmation thereof by  other kings, with some of the most precious gifts presented to the  abbey.\"    Edmund and Egbert set to work to assist the weeping monks in making  preparations for their departure. A boat was laden with the relics of  the saints, the muniments of the king, and the most precious vessels.  The table of the great altar covered with plates of gold, which King  Wichtlof had presented, with ten gold chalices, and many other vessels,  was thrown into the well of the convent.    In the distance the smoke of several villages could now be seen rising  over the plain, and it was clear that the Danes were approaching. The  ten priests and twenty monks who were to leave now knelt, and received  the solemn benediction of the abbot, then, with Edmund and Egbert, they  took their places in the boat and rowed away to the wood of Ancarig,  which lay not far from the abbey.    The abbot Theodore and the aged monks and priests now returned to the  church, and, putting on their vestments, commenced the services of the  day; the abbot himself celebrated high mass, assisted by brother Elfget  the deacon, brother Savin the sub-deacon, and the brothers Egelred and  Wyelric, youths who acted as taper-bearers. When the mass was finished,  just as the abbot and his assistants had partaken of the holy  communion, the Danes burst into the church. The abbot was slain upon  the holy altar by the hand of the Danish king Oskytal, and the other  priests and monks were beheaded by the executioner.    The old men and children in the choir were seized and tortured to  disclose where the treasures of the abbey were concealed, and were also  put to death with the prior and sub-prior. Turgar, an acolyte of ten  years of age; a remarkably beautiful boy, stood by the side of the  sub-prior as he was murdered and fearlessly confronted the Danes, and  bade them put him to death with the holy father. The young Earl Sidroc,  however, struck with the bearing of the child, and being moved with  compassion, stripped him of his robe and cowl, and threw over him a  long Danish tunic without sleeves, and ordering him to keep close by  him, made his way out of the monastery, the boy being the only one who  was saved from the general massacre.    The Danes, furious at being able to find none of the treasures of the  monastery, broke open all the shrines and levelled the marble tombs,  including those of St. Guthlac, the holy virgin Ethelbritha, and many  others, but found in these none of the treasure searched for. They  piled the bodies of the saints in a heap, and burned them, together  with the church and all the buildings of the monastery;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36764"],[0,"In the Track of the Bookworm (#6)"],[1,"of a  famous old binder. If there is any difference it is in favor of the  Grangerite, who improves the volume for the intelligent purposes of the  reader, as against the other who merely caters to \"the lust of the eye\".    I am willing to concede that the Grangerite is sometimes guilty of some  gross offenses against good taste and good sense. The worst of these is  when he extends the text of the volume itself to a larger page in order to  embrace large prints. This is grotesque, for it spoils the very book. He  is also blamable when he squanders valuable prints and time and patience  on mere book lumber, such as long rows of histories; and when he stuffs  and crams his book; and when his pictures are not of the era of the  events or of the time of life of the persons described; and when they are  too large or too small to be in just proportion to the printed page; and  when the book is so heavy and cumbersome that no one can handle it with  comfort or convenience. Above all he is blamable, in my estimation, when  he entrusts the selection of prints to an agent. Such agency is frequently  very unsatisfactory, and at all events the Illustrator misses the sport of  the hunt. Few men would entrust the furnishing or decorating of a house,  the purchase of a horse, or the selection of a wife to a third person, and  the delicate matter of choosing prints for a book is essentially one to be  transacted in person. The danger of any other procedure in the case of a  wife was illustrated by Cromwell's agency for Henry Eighth in the affair  of Anne of Cleves, the \"Flanders mare.\"    But when it is properly done, it seems to me that the very best thing the  Book-Worm ever does is to illustrate his books, because this insures his  reading them, at least with his fingers. Not always, for a certain  chronicler of collections of privately illustrated books in this country  narrates, how \"relying upon the index\" of a book, which he illustrated, he  inserted a portrait of Sam Johnson, the famous, whereas \"the text called  for Sam Johnson, an eccentric dramatic writer,\" etc. His binder, he says,  laughed at him for being ignorant that there \"two Sam Johnsons\" (there are  four in the biographical dictionaries, one of whom was an early president  of King's College in New York). But if done personally and conscientiously  it is a means of valuable culture. As one of the oldest survivors of the  genus Illustrator in this country, I have thus assumed to offer an apology  and defense for my much berated kind. And now let me make a few  suggestions as to what seems to me the most suitable mode of the pursuit.    In illustrating there seem to be two methods, which may be described as  the literal or realistic, and imaginative. The first consists simply in  the insertion of portraits, views and scenes appropriate to the text. A  pleasing variety may be imparted to this method by substituting for a mere  portrait a scene in the life of the celebrity in question. For example,  if Charles V. and Titian are mentioned together, it would be interesting  to insert a picture representing the historical incident of the emperor  picking up and handing the artist a brush which he had dropped--and one  will have an interesting hunt to find it. But I am more an adherent of the  romantic school, which finds excellent play in the illustration of poetry.  For example, in the poem, \"Ennui,\" in \"The Croakers,\" for the line, \"The  fiend, the fiend is on me still,\" I found, after a search of some years, a  picture of an imp sitting on the breast of a man in bed with the gout. In  the same stanza are the lines, \"Like a cruel cat, that sucks a child to  death,\" and for this I have a print from a children's magazine, of a cat  squatting on the breast of a child in a cradle. Now I would like \"a  Madagascar bat,\" which rhymes to \"cat\" in the poem. \"And like a tom-cat  dies by inches,\" is illustrated by a picture of a cat caught by the paw in  a steel trap. \"Simon\" was \"a gentleman of color,\" the favorite pastry cook  and caterer of New York half a century ago--before the days of Mr. Ward  McAllister. \"The Croaker\" advises him to \"buy an eye-glass and become a  dandy and a gentleman.\" This is illustrated by a rare and fine print of a  colored gentleman, dressed in breeches, silk stockings, and ruffled shirt,  scanning an overdressed lady of African descent through an eye-glass. \"The  ups and downs of politics\" is illustrated by a Cruikshank print, the upper  part of which shows a party making an ascension in a balloon and the lower  part a party making a descent in a diving-bell, and entitled \"the ups and  downs of life.\" To illustrate the phrase, \"seeing the elephant,\" take the  print of Pyrrhus trying to frighten his captive, Fabricus, by suddenly  drawing the curtains of his tent and showing him an elephant with his  trunk raised in a baggage-smashing attitude. For \"The Croakers\" there are  apt illustrations also of the following queer subjects: Korah, Dathan and  Abiram; Miss Atropos, shut up your Scissors; Albany's two Steeples high in  Air, Reading Cobbett's Register, Bony in His Prison Isle, Giant Wife,  Beauty and The Beast, Fly Market, Tammany Hall, The Dove from Noah's Ark,  Rome Saved by Geese, Caesar Offered a Crown, Caesar Crossing the Rubicon,  Dick Ricker's Bust, Sancho in His Island Reigning, The Wisest of Wild  Fowl, Reynold' Beer House, A Mummy, A Chimney Sweep, The Arab's Wind,  Pygmalion, Danae, Highland Chieftain with His Tail On, Nightmare, Shaking  Quakers, Polony's Crazy Daughter, Bubble-Blowing, First Pair of Breeches,  Banquo's Ghost, Press Gang, Fair Lady With the Bandaged Eye, A Warrior  Leaning on His Sword, A Warrior's Tomb, A Duel, and A Street Flirtation.    As the charm of illustrating consists in the hunt for the prints, so the  latter method is the more engrossing because the game is the more  difficult to run down. Portraits, views and scenes are plenty, but to find  them properly adaptable is frequently difficult. Some things which one  would suppose readily procurable are really hard to find. For example, it  was a weary chase to get a treadmill, and so of a drum-major, although the  latter is now not uncommon: and although I know it exists, I have not  attained unto a bastinado. Sirens and mermaids are rather retiring, and  when Vedder depicted the Sea-Serpent he conferred a boon on Illustrators.  \"God's Scales,\" in which the mendicant weighs down the rich man, is a  rarity. Milton leaving his card on Galileo in prison is among my wants,  although I have seen it.    As to scarce portraits, let me sing a song of      THE SHY PORTRAITS.      Oh, why do you elude me so--      Ye portraits that so long I've sought?    That somewhere ye exist, I know--      Indifferent, good, and good for naught.      Lucrezia, of the poisoned cup,      Why do you shrink away by stealth?    To view your \"mug\" with you I'd sup,      And even dare to drink your health.      Oh! why so coy, Godiva fair?      You're covered by your shining tresses,    And I would promise not to stare      At sheerest of go-diving dresses.      Come out, old Bluebeard; don't be shy!      You're not so bad as Froude's great hero;    Xantippe, fear no law gone by      When scolds were ducked in ponds at zero.      Not mealy-mouthed was Mrs. Behn,      And prudish was satiric Jane,    But equally they both shun men,      As if they bore the mark of Cain.      George Barrington, you may return      To country which you \"left for good;\"    Psalmanazar, I would not spurn      Your language when 'twas understood.      Jean Grolier, you left many books--      They come so dear I must ignore 'em--    But there's no evidence of your looks      For us surviving \"amicorum.\"      This country's overrun by grangers--      I'm ignorant of their christian names    But my afflicted eyes are strangers      To one I want whom men call James.      There's Heber, man of many books--      You're far more modest than the Bishop;    I'm curious to learn your looks,      And care for nothing shown at his shop.      And oh! that wondrous, pattern child!      His truthfulness, no one can match it;    Dear little George! I'm almost wild      To find a wood-cut of his hatchet.      Show forth your face, Anonymous,      Whose name is in the books I con    Most frequently; so famous thus,      Will you not come to me anon?    By way of jest I have inserted an anonymous portrait opposite an anonymous  poem, and was once gravely asked by an absent-minded friend if it really  was the portrait of the author. One however will probably look in vain for  portraits of \"Quatorze\" and \"Quinze,\" for which a print seller of New York  once had an inquiry, and I have been told of a collector who returned  Arlington because of the cut on his nose, and Ogle because of his damaged  eye. But there is more sport in hunting for a dodo than a rabbit.    It is also a pleasant thing to lay a picture occasionally in a book  without setting out to illustrate it regularly, so that it may break upon  one as a surprise when he takes up the book years afterward. It is a  grateful surprise to find in Ruskin's \"Modern Painters\" a casual print  from Roger's \"Italy,\" and in Hamerton's books some sporadic etchings by  Rembrandt or Hayden. It is like discovering an unexpected \"quarter\" in the  pocket of an old waistcoat. For example, in \"With Thackeray in America,\"  Mr. Eyre Crowe tells how the second number of the first edition of \"The  Newcomes\" came to the author when he was in Paris, and how he found fault  with Doyle's illustration of the games of the Charterhouse boys. He says:  \"The peccant accessory which roused the wrath of the writer was the group  of two boys playing at marbles on the left of the spectator. 'Why,' said  the irate author, 'they would as soon thought of cutting off their heads  as play marbles at the Charterhouse!' This woodcut was, I noticed,  suppressed altogether in subsequent editions.\" Now"]]]
