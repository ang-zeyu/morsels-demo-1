[39] The decision had been made. General  MacArthur was to return to the Philippine Islands in force.                  CHAPTER II    The Nature of the Target      The Philippine Islands, the largest island group in the Malay  Archipelago, were discovered by Ferdinand Magellan in 1521. They became  a Spanish possession in 1565 and remained so until 10 December 1898  when they were ceded to the United States by the Treaty of Paris as  a result of the Spanish-American war. In the spring of 1942 Japan  secured military domination over the Islands.    The Philippine Archipelago lay in the geographical heart of the Far  Eastern theater of war. As a pivotal point of control the Islands were  centrally placed in relation to Japan, China, Burma, French Indochina,  Thailand, British Malaya, and the Netherlands Indies. Being the most  northerly part of the Malay Archipelago, the Philippines were also  close to the vital areas of Japan and the Chinese-held areas of the  Asiatic mainland. Located southeast of the continent, they occupy  much the same position with respect to the mainland of Asia that the  West Indies do with respect to North America.    The Islands are among the remnants of a great continent that once  extended over the space now occupied by the entire East Indies. There  are some 7,100 islands and islets in the Philippine Archipelago, which  has a land area of 114,830 square miles. Of these, about 460 have an  area of one square mile or more and 2,773 are named. The Philippine  Islands are divided into three main groups--Luzon and adjacent islands  in the northern sector; the Visayan Islands in the central portion,  comprising Samar, Leyte, and numerous others; and finally, in the  southern part, Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago. The Philippines  had a prewar population of about 16,000,000, of whom 14,550,000 were  Christians, 678,000 were Mohammedans, 626,000 were pagans, and about  64,000 were Buddhists and Shintoists. [40]          Geography of Leyte    The northeastern Visayan group, which consists mainly of Leyte  and Samar, was selected as the point of entrance into the  Philippines. Leyte had the higher potential military value. The  air distance from the capital city of Tacloban to Manila is 295  miles. Leyte is a natural gateway to the rest of the Philippines, and  its possession would greatly facilitate and support further operations  to the north as well as expedite control over the remaining islands  in the Visayan group. [41]    Leyte roughly resembles a molar tooth with its crown toward Samar  and its roots pointing to Mindanao. The eighth largest island in the  Philippines, with an area of 2,785 square miles, it runs generally from  north to south, with an approximate length of 115 miles and a width  of 15 to 45 miles. It is situated on one of the principal submerged  shelves of the Philippine Archipelago, and the waters over the shelf  have an average depth of 22 fathoms. (Map 2--inside back cover)        The Terrain    The island is mainly volcanic in origin. A range of mountains, the  topographical backbone of the island, extends southeast from Biliran  Strait in the north to Cabalian Bay in the south and separates the  Leyte and Ormoc Valleys. All of southern Leyte is mountainous and,  militarily speaking, of little importance. The northwest coast is  also rugged, and except for the port of Palompon has little tactical  significance. The heavily forested central mountain range is composed  of numerous knifelike ridges and spurs and deep ravines and serves as  an effective natural barrier between the island's eastern and western  coastal areas. It is a major obstacle to the rapid movement of troops  and can be utilized very effectively in defending the island.    Leyte Valley, a broad and fertile plain, stretches across the  northeastern part of the island from Leyte Gulf to Carigara Bay. More  than twenty-five miles wide along the shore of the gulf, it is  gradually narrowed by the mountain ranges to the north and south to  less than ten miles as it reaches Carigara Bay. Most of the island's  population live in this valley, and here too are most of the principal  cities and airfields.    The main road net of the island runs through Leyte Valley, a  great number of streams interlacing it. The numerous rice paddies,  centuries old, disrupt the natural drainage of the valley. Rarely  is the water level more than a few inches below the surface. Even  in the drier months, vehicular movement is limited to the existing  roads. In 1944 these were poor, inadequate, and ill suited for heavy  military traffic. The best of them had only a light bituminous surface  and were neither wide enough nor strong enough for two-way military  traffic. [42] It was hoped that Leyte Valley could be developed into  a large air and logistical base to support further operations, but  it was not well suited for this purpose.    The shore line of Leyte Valley along Leyte Gulf and San Pedro Bay  affords the best landing beaches on the island. This coast is  dangerous for beach landings during northeast monsoon periods,  when heavy surf, high winds, and torrential rains imperil men,  equipment, and shipping. July, August, and September are the best  months for landing. In general there are good firm sand beaches,  onto which landing craft can go directly. A road parallels the shore  line, but there are few exit roads from the beach to this road and  beyond. In many places close to the shore there are swamps and rice  paddies which prevent rapid egress from the beach. There are other  good landing beaches on the east coast of Ormoc Bay, but they are  crossed by innumerable creeks and streams.    Leyte Gulf is large and open, offering an excellent anchorage  for a considerable number of vessels, including those of largest  size. Carigara Bay, to the north of the island, is twenty miles wide,  but shallow waters, swamps, and the hilly terrain of its eastern and  western sides restrict its value for military operations. A narrow neck  of the central mountain range separates the bay from the northern end  of Ormoc Valley. San Juanico Strait, which separates Leyte from Samar  in the north, connects Carigara Bay and San Pedro Bay, the latter being  a northern extension of Leyte Gulf. The strait is thirteen and a half  miles long with an average width of a quarter to a half mile. Small  landing craft can navigate the channel, but there are strong tidal  currents which cause violent rips and swirls at many points.    Wedged in between the central mountain range and the hill mass of the  northwest coast of Leyte, the Ormoc Valley, about five miles wide in  its largest part, extends from Ormoc Bay to the north for fifteen miles  where a narrow neck of the central ridge separates it from Carigara  Bay. Through the valley runs a narrow road, its northern portion marked  by steep grades and sharp curves. Halfway along, a branch road zigzags  its course to Port Palompon on the west coast. Although most of the  southern part of the valley is under cultivation, there are large  patches of forest, scrub growth, and cogon grass in the north. [43]    The largest city on the island, the provincial capital, is Tacloban,  which lies at the head of San Pedro Bay. As the only sizable port in  the area, it handles most of the outbound shipping, mainly from Leyte  and Samar. Its prewar population was about 31,000. Other important  towns are Carigara and Barugo on the north coast; Baybay and Ormoc,  the leading ports on the west coast; and Palo, Tanauan, and Abuyog  along the east coast. All the more significant towns are situated on  the main road system of the island, and the larger coastal barrios  (villages) have roads of a sort.    The road system is divided into a northern and a southern coastal  road net. The former, which is the better, was designed for the  transportation of agricultural produce from the northern interior areas  to Tacloban. The latter is composed of narrow, roundabout roads that  are constantly in need of repair. The two systems are joined by a road,  scarcely better than a trail, which runs west of Abuyog and corkscrews  its way through heavily forested mountains to Baybay. Another road,  long, narrow, and broken in parts, goes north from Baybay to Ormoc  and thence through the Ormoc Valley to Carigara.    The Tacloban airstrip, the principal airfield on the island, was  located on the Cataisan Peninsula, which lies just southeast of  Tacloban. The Japanese had constructed another airfield, known as  the Dulag airstrip, two miles west of Dulag; three others--the Buri,  Bayug, and San Pablo airstrips--near Burauen, five miles west of Dulag;  and still another at Valencia in the Ormoc Valley, eight miles north  of Ormoc.    Control of the island of Leyte is dependent upon control of the Leyte  and Ormoc Valleys and their adjacent hills and mountains. Thus, before  a successful movement into Leyte Valley could be assured, control of  the high ground in the vicinity of Palo would be essential. Continued  dominance over the valley is dependent upon control of the high ground  at its northwestern end in the vicinity of Pinamopoan on Carigara Bay,  possession of which would preclude infiltration from Ormoc Valley. The  control of Ormoc Valley and use of the excellent anchorage and harbor  facilities of Ormoc Bay is dependent upon control of the lowland in  the vicinity of Ormoc city and the commanding hills to the east.        The People    In 1939 the total population of Leyte was 915,853, of whom more  than 912,000 were native Visayans of Malaysian stock. The largest  other group consisted of 3,076 Chinese, half of whom were engaged  in retail trade. There was a sprinkling of other national groups--40  Spaniards, 20 Germans, 81 from other European countries, 56 Americans,  and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4907"],[0,"Moths of the Limberlost: A Book About Limberlost Cabin (#6)"],[1," of the body so that it can strike from side to side  when disturbed.  In the case of caterpillars that have a horn, as  Celeus, or sets of them as Regalis, in this attitude they really  appear quite formidable, and often I have seen them drive away  small birds, while many  people flee shrieking.    There are little tubes that carry air to the trachea, as  caterpillars have no lungs and can live with a very small amount  of air.    The skin may be rough, granulated, or soft and fine as silk, and  in almost every instance of exquisite colour: bluish green,  greenish blue, wonderful yellows and from pale to deep wine red,  many species having oblique touches of contrasting colours on the  abdominal rings.  Others are marked with small projections of  bright colours from which tufts of hair or bristles may grow.  In  some, as Io, these bristles are charged with an irritating acid  that will sting for an hour after coming in contact with the skin,  but does no permanent injury.  On a few there are what seem to be  small pockets of acid that can be ejected with a jerk, and on some  a sort of filament that is supposed to distil a disagreeable odour.  As the caterpillar only uses these when disturbed, it is safe to  presume that they  are placed for defence, but as in the case of  moths I doubt their efficacy.    Some lepidopterists have thought the sex of a moth could be  regulated by the amount of food given the caterpillar; but with  my numerous other doubts I include this.  It is all of a piece  with any attempt at sex regulation.  I regard it as morally certain  that sex goes back to the ovary and that the egg produced yields a  male or female caterpillar in the beginning.  I am becoming convinced  that caterpillars recognize sex in each other, basing the theory  on the facts that in half a dozen instances I have found cocoons,  spun only a few inches apart.  One pair brought to me as interwoven.  Two of these are shown in the following chapter.  In all cases a male  and female emerged within a few minutes of each other and mated as  soon as possible.  If a single pair of these cocoons ever had produced  two of a kind, it would give rise to doubts.  When all of them proved  to be male and female that paired, it seems to me to furnish  conclusive evidence that the caterpillars knew what they were  doing, and spun in the same place for the purpose of appearing  together.    At maturity, usually near five weeks, the full-fed caterpillar  rests a day, empties the intestines, and races around searching for  a suitable place to locate winter quarters.  With burrowing  caterpillars that winter in pupa cases, soft earth or rotting wood  is found and entered by working their way with the heads and  closing it with the hind parts.  At the desired depth they push in  all directions with such force that a hollow larger, but shaped as  a hen's egg, is worked out; usually this is six or more inches below  the surface.  So compactly is the earth forced back, that fall rains,  winter's alternate freezing and thawing, always a mellowing process,  and spring downpours do not break up the big ball, often larger than  a quart bowl, that surrounds the case of the pupa.  It has been  thought by some and recorded, that this ball is held in place by  spinning or an acid ejected by the caterpillar.  I never have  heard of any one else who has had my luck in lifting these earth  balls intact, opening, and photographing them and their contents.  I have examined them repeatedly and carefully.  I can find not the  slightest trace of spinning or adhesion other than by force.    With one of these balls lifted and divided, we decided what  happened underground by detaining a caterpillar on the surface and  forcing it to transform before us, for this change is not optional.  When the time comes the pupa must evolve.  So the caterpillar lies  on the earth, gradually growing shorter, the skin appearing dry  and the horns drooping.  There never is a trace of spinning or acid  ejected in the sand buckets.  When the change is completed there  begins a violent twisting and squirming.  The caterpillar skin opens  in a straight line just behind the head on the back, and by working  with the pointed abdomen the pupa case emerges.  The cast skin  rapidly darkens, and as I never have found a trace of it in an  opened earth ball in the spring, I suppose it disintegrates  rapidly, or what is more possible, is eaten by small borers that  swarm through the top six inches of the earth's crust.    The pupa is thickly coated with a sticky substance that seems to  serve the double purpose of facilitating its exit from the  caterpillar skin and to dry over it in a glossy waterproof  coating.  At first the pupa is brownish green and flattened, but as  it dries it rapidly darkens in colour and assumes the shape of a  perfect specimen.  Concerning this stage of the evolution of a moth  the doctors disagree.    The emergence I have watched repeatedly, studied photographically,  and recorded in the tabulated records from which I wrote the  following life histories.  At time to appear I believe the pupa  bores its way with the sharp point of the abdomen; at least I  have seen Celeus, and Carolina, Regalis and Imperialis coming  through the surface, abdomen tip first.  Once free, they press  with the feet against the wing shields, burst them away and leave  the case at the thorax.  Each moth I ever have seen emerge has been  wet and the empty  case damp inside.  I have poured three large  drops of pinkish liquid the consistency of thin cream from the abdominal  rings of a Regalis case.  Undoubtedly this liquid is ejected by  the moth to enable it to break loose from and leave the case with  its delicate down intact.  The furry scales of its covering are so  loosely set that any violent struggle with dry down would disfigure  the moth.    Among Cecropia and its Attacine cousins, also Luna, Polyphemus, and  all other spinners the process is practically the same, save that  it is much more elaborate; most of all with Cecropia, that spins  the largest cocoon I ever have seen, and it varies its work more  than any of the others.  Lengthwise of a slender twig it spins a  long, slim cocoon; on a board or wall, roomier and wider at the  bottom, and inside hollow trees, and under bridges, big baggy  quarters of exquisite reddish tan colours that do not fade as do  those exposed to the weather.  The typical cocoon of the species  is that spun on a fence or outbuilding, not the slender work on  the alders or the elaborate quarters of the bridge.  On a board  the process is to cover the space required with a fine spinning  that glues firmly to the wood.  Then the worker takes a firm grip  with the anal props and lateral feet and begins drawing out long  threads that start at the top, reach down one side, across the  bottom and back to the top again, where each thread is cut and  another begun.  As long as the caterpillar can be seen through  its work, it remains in the same position and throws the head  back and around to carry the threads.  I never thought of  counting these movements while watching a working spinner, but  some one who has, estimates that Polyphemus, that spins a cocoon  not one fourth the size of Cecropia, moves the head a quarter  of a million times in guiding the silk thread.  When a thin webbing  is spun and securely  attached all around the edges it is pushed  out in the middle and gummed all over the inside with a liquid glue  that oozes through, coalesces and hardens in a waterproof covering.  Then a big nest of crinkly silk threads averaging from three to  four inches in length are spun, running from the top down one side,  up the other, and the cut ends drawn closely together.  One writer  states that this silk has no commercial value; while Packard thinks  it has.  I attach greater weight to his opinion.  Next comes the  inner case.  For this the caterpillar loosens its hold and completely  surrounds itself with a small case of compact work.  This in turn is  saturated with the glue and forms in a thick, tough case, rough on  the outside, the top not so solidly spun as the other walls;  inside dark brown and worn so smooth it seems as if oiled, from the  turning of the caterpillar.  In this little chamber close the  length and circumference of an average sized woman's two top joints  of the first finger, the caterpillar transforms to the pupa stage,  crowding its cast skin in a wad at the bottom.    At time for emergence the moth bursts the pupa case, which is  extremely thin and papery compared with the cases of burrowing  species.  We know by the wet moth that liquid is ejected, although  we cannot see the wet spot on the top of the inner case of Cecropia  as we can with Polyphemus, that does not spin the loose outer case  and silk nest.  From here on the moths emerge according to species.  Some work with their mouths and fore feet.  Some have rough  projections on the top of the head, and others little sawlike  arrangements at the bases of the wings.  In whatever manner they  free themselves, all of them are wet when they leave their quarters.  Sometimes the gathered silk ends comb sufficient down from an  emerging Cecropia to leave a terra cotta rim around the opening  from which it came; but I never saw one lose enough at this time  to disfigure it.  On very rare occasions a deformed moth appears.  I had a Cecropia with one wing no larger than my thumb nail, and  it never developed.  This is caused by the moth sustaining an injury  to the wing in emergence.  If the membrane is slightly punctured  the liquid forced into the wing for its development escapes and  there is no enlargement.    Also, in rare instances, a moth is unable to escape at all and is  lost if it is not assisted; but this is precarious business and  should not be attempted unless you are positive the moth will die  if you do not interfere.  The struggle it takes to emerge is a"]]]
