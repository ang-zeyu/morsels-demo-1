After a little while she swims away with her wheels going, and her  tail, forked at the end, is found to be telescopic, or capable of being  pulled in and out. As the cilia play, the neighbouring water is  agitated, and the multitudes of small objects are brought by the  whirlpools within her ravenous maw. But the strangest thing of all is  that inside her body is seen a young one; in this case a large and fine  infant, which, like \"a chip of the old block,\" imitates the parental  motions, thrusts forth its cilia and works its gizzard.[3] In other  genera the eggs are hatched externally, but this one is ovoviparous, and  carries its nursery inside.    [3] This was met with in the summer, but is described here to avoid  repetition. I do not know whether the eggs are hatched in very cold  weather.    A very slight investigation is sufficient to show that in the  wheel-bearer we have made a great advance towards a higher organization  than we discovered in the preceding creatures. We witness what the  learned call a \"differentiation\" of parts and tissues, and a  \"specialization\" of organs. The head is plainly distinguishable from the  body, the skin or integument is distinctly different from the internal  tissues, behind the eyes we can detect a nervous ganglion or miniature  brain, the gizzard is a complicated piece of vital mechanism, such as we  have not met with before, and in various parts of the transparent inside  we see organs to which particular functions are assigned.    It was at one time thought that Rotifers were hermaphrodite--uniting  both sexes in one body--but that idea is now generally abandoned, for in  many species the males have been discovered, and the fair sex may be  gratified to hear that they are without doubt the \"inferior animals.\"  Their function is simply to assist the female in producing young, and as  this can be quickly accomplished, their lives are short, and they are  not supplied with the gizzard and digestive apparatus, which their  lady-loves possess. Much discussion has taken place as to the rank which  the Rotifers hold in the animal kingdom, some naturalists thinking them  relations of the crabs, and others believing them to belong to the  family of the worms. Professor Huxley, who adopts the latter view, which  has the most friends, groups the lower _Annulosa_ together under the  name of _Annuloida_, in which he includes _Annelides_, or worms of  various kinds, the _Echinodermata_ (or \"spine skins,\" among which are  the star-fish and sea hedgehogs), and some other families. He considers  the Rotifers to be \"the permanent forms of Echinoderm larvae.\" This does  not mean that they were ever produced by Echinoderms, and had their  development checked, but that they resemble them in organization, and  illustrate a general law, observable in animated beings, namely, that  the lower creatures are like the imperfect stages of higher animals, and  that all things are formed according to general principles, and exhibit  a uniformity of plan.    Mr. Gosse adopts a different view, and while admitting a connection  between the Rotifers and the worms, adduces important reasons for  associating them with the insects.    Leaving zoologists to settle their position, we may remark that the  Rotifers form a very numerous family, presenting very great diversities  of structure, some of the most interesting of which we shall meet with  in the course of our rambles; but they all possess a gizzard, which,  though differing in complexity, is throughout formed upon the same  principle, and that we must now explain.    We have called the masticatory apparatus of the Rotifers a _gizzard_;  but Mr. Gosse, who has done most to elucidate its structure, contends  that it is a _mouth_; and in some species it is frequently protruded,  and used like the mouth of higher animals. Taking one of the most  typical forms of this organ, and drawing our illustrations from Mr.  Gosse's admirable paper in the \"Transactions of the Royal Society,\" we  may describe it, when completely developed, as consisting of three  lobes, having a more or less rounded form. The eminent naturalist we  have named calls the whole organ the _mastax_, and states that it is  composed of dense muscular fibre. The tube which leads down to it he  designates the \"buccal (mouth) funnel,\" and the tube that issues from  it, and conveys the food to the digestive sac or stomach, he calls the  _oesophagus_, in conformity with the nomenclature applied to creatures  whose mouths are in the usual place. Inside the mouth-gizzard are placed  two organs, which work like hammers, and which Mr. Gosse therefore names  _mallei_. The hammers work against a sort of anvil, which is called  _incus_, the Latin for that implement. Each hammer consists of two  portions articulated by a hinge joint. The lower portion, the  _manubrium_, or handle, gives motion to the upper portion, which from  its shape is named the _uncus_, or hook. The _unci_ are furnished with  finger-like processes of teeth, which vary in number. There are five or  six in the best developed specimens. These hooks or teeth work against  each other, and against the _incus_, or anvil, which consists of  distinct articulated portions, of which the principal are two _rami_, or  branches, jointed so that they can open and close like a pair of shears.  These two rest upon the third portion, which is called the _fulcrum_.  Some faint idea of the working of the toothed hammers may be obtained by  rubbing the knuckles of both hands together, but the motion is more  complicated, and the _rami_ play their part in the trituration of the  food. Mr. Gosse states that when an objectionable morsel has got as far  as this mouth-gizzard, \"it is thrown back by a peculiar scoop-like  action of the _unci_, very curious to witness.\" The foregoing diagram  will help the reader to comprehend this description, but no opportunity  should be lost for viewing this remarkable organ busy at work in the  living animals.    [Illustration: Gizzard of Notomata.]    The respiration of the Rotifers is supposed to be effected by the  passage of water through vessels running round them, and called the  \"water vascular system,\" and in addition to their eyes, which often  disappear in adult specimens, the organ we described as standing out  like a pig-tail, as our acquaintance crawled along, is thought to act as  an _antenna_, or feeler, and brings its possessor in further relation to  the external world. It is also called the _calcar_, or spur, and is  furnished with cilia or bristles at its extremity.    Sometimes the particles swallowed by the Common Rotifer are large enough  for their course to be traced, but there is frequently a great commotion  and grinding of the gizzard, without any appreciable cause, although  doubtless something is taken in, and when the creature is tired, or has  had enough, we see both head and tail retracted, and the body assumes a  globular form. In another chapter, when viewing a Philodine, we shall  see how in the family to which the Common Rotifer belongs, the gizzard  departs from the perfect type.          CHAPTER III.

It has been a bitterly cold night, and as the sun shines on a clear keen  morning, and glistens in the hoar-frost which covers the trees, it might  seem an unpropitious time for visiting the ponds, in search of  microscopic prey. We will, however, try our luck, and take a brisk trot  to the top of Hampstead Heath, where the air is still keener, and the  ice more thick. Arriving at the highest point, London appears on one  side enveloped in its usual great coat of smoke, through which St.  Paul's big dome, with a score or two of towers and steeples, can be  dimly made out; while looking towards Harrow-on-the-Hill, or Barnet, we  see the advantage of country air in the sharpness with which distant  objects cut the blue sky. We leave the large ponds for another time,  and hunt out the little hollows among the furze and fern. One looks  promising from the bright green vegetation to be discovered under the  sheet of ice, which is almost firm enough to bear human weight.    Breaking a convenient hole we hook up some of the water-plants, and  place them in a wide-mouthed vial, which we fill with water, and  cursorily examine with a pocket-lens. Some water-fleas briskly skipping  about, and a beautiful little beetle, with an elegant dotted pattern on  his brown back, and a glistening film of air covering his belly, show  that we have not been unsuccessful, although we must wait till we get  home to know the extent of our findings, among which, however, we can  only discern the graceful spiral shell of a small water-snail, the  _Planorbis_.    Arriving at home the bottle was left undisturbed for some hours in a  warm light place, and then on being examined several specimens of that  beautiful polyp, the _Hydra viridis_, were seen attached to the glass,  and spreading their delicate tentacles in search of prey. One of the  polyps is carefully removed by the _dipping-tube_, a small glass tube,  open at both ends. The forefinger is placed upon the top, and when the  other end is brought over the object the finger is raised for an  instant, and as the water rushes in the little hydra comes too, and is  placed in a glass cell, about half an inch wide, and one tenth of an  inch deep.

The courage of these little birds is most remarkable and  admirable.    Our hut, being built on the rookery, could only be approached through  crowds of penguins. Those that nested near us seemed quickly to become  used to us and to take less notice of us than those farther off. One  thing, however, terrified them pitiably. We had to fetch ice for our  water from some stranded floes on the ice-foot, and this we did in a  little sledge. As we hauled this rattling over the pebbly rookery it  made a good deal of noise, and in its path nests were deserted, the  occupants fleeing in the greatest confusion, a clear road being left for  the sledge, whilst on either side a line of penguins was seen retreating  in the utmost terror. After about a minute, they returned to their  places and seemed to forget the incident, but we were very sorry to  frighten them in this way, as we endeavoured to live at peace with them  and to molest them as little as possible, and we feared that later on  eggs might be spilt from the nests and broken. As time went on, those on  the route of the sledge became accustomed even to this, and we were able  to choose a course which cleared their nests.      [Illustration: Fig. 18. ARRIVING AT THE ROOKERY. IN THE BACKGROUND IS    THE CLIFF UP WHICH MANY OF THE BIRDS CLIMB TO MAKE THEIR NESTS AT THE    SUMMIT (Page 28)]    Although squabbles and encounters had been frequent since their arrival  in any numbers, it now became manifest that there were two very  different types of battle; first, the ordinary quarrelling consequent on  disputes over nests and the robbery of stones from these, and secondly,  the battles between cocks who fought for the hens. These last were more  earnest and severe, and were carried to a finish, whereas the first  named rarely proceeded to extremes.    In regard to the mating of the birds, the following most interesting  customs seemed to be prevalent.    The hen would establish herself on an old nest, or in some cases scoop  out a hollow in the ground and sit in or by this, waiting for a mate to  propose himself. (Fig. 26.) She would not attempt to build while she  remained unmated. During the first week of the nesting season, when  plenty of fresh arrivals were continually pouring into the rookery, she  did not have long to wait as a rule. Later, when the rookery was getting  filled up, and only a few birds remained unmated in that vast crowd of  some three-quarters of a million, her chances were not so good.    For example, on November 16 on a knoll thickly populated by mated birds,  many of which already had eggs, a hen was observed to have scooped a  little hollow in the ground and to be sitting in this. Day after day she  sat on looking thinner and sadder as time passed and making no attempt  to build her nest. At last, on November 27, she had her reward, for I  found that a cock had joined her, and she was busily building her nest  in the little scoop she had made so long before, her husband steadily  working away to provide her with the necessary pebbles. Her forlorn  appearance of the past ten days had entirely given place to an air of  occupation and happiness.    As time went on I became certain that invariably pairing took place  after arrival at the rookery. On October 23 I went to the place where  the stream of arrivals was coming up the beach, and presently followed a  single bird, which I afterwards found to be a cock, to see what it was  going to do. He threaded his way through nearly the whole length of the  rookery by himself, avoiding the tenanted knolls where the nests were,  by keeping to the emptier hollows. About every hundred yards or so he  stopped, ruffled up his feathers, closed his eyes for a moment, then  \"smoothed himself out\" and went on again, thus evidently struggling  against desire for sleep after his journey. As he progressed he  frequently poked his little head forward and from side to side, peering  up at the knolls, evidently in search of something.      [Illustration: Fig. 19. Adelies arriving at the Rookery]      [Illustration: Fig. 20. A Cock carrying a Stone to his Nest (Page 21)]    Arrived at length at the south end of the rookery, he appeared suddenly  to make up his mind, and boldly ascending a knoll which was well  tenanted and covered with nests, walked straight up to one of these on  which a hen sat. There was a cock standing at her side, but my little  friend either did not see him or wished to ignore him altogether. He  stuck his beak into the frozen ground in front of the nest, lifted up  his head and made as if to place an imaginary stone in front of the hen,  a most obvious piece of dumb show. The hen took not the slightest notice  nor did her mate.    My friend then turned and walked up to another nest, a yard or so off,  where another cock and hen were. The cock flew at him immediately, and  after a short fight, in which each used his flippers savagely, he was  driven clean down the side of the knoll away from the nests, the  victorious cock returning to his hen. The newcomer, with the persistence  which characterises his kind, came straight back to the same nest and  stood close by it, soon ruffling his feathers and evidently settling  himself for a doze, but, I suppose, because he made no further overtures  the others took no notice of him at all, as, overcome by sheer  weariness, he went to sleep and remained so until I was too cold to  await further developments. On my way back to our hut I followed another  cock for about thirty yards, when he walked up to another couple at a  nest and gave battle to the cock. He, too, was driven off after a short  and decisive fight. Soon there were many cocks on the war-path. Little  knots of them were to be seen about the rookery, the lust of battle in  them, watching and fighting each other with desperate jealousy, and the  later the season advanced the more \"bersac\" they became.    A typical scene I find described in my notes for October 25 when I was  out with my camera, and I mention it as a type of the hundreds that were  proceeding simultaneously over the whole rockery, and also because I was  able to photograph different stages of the proceedings as follows:    Fig. 22 shows a group of three cocks engaged in bitter rivalry round a  hen who is cowering in her scoop in which she had been waiting as is  their custom. She appeared to be bewildered and agitated by the  desperate behaviour of the cocks.      [Illustration: Fig. 21. SEVERAL INTERESTING THINGS ARE TAKING PLACE    HERE (Page 43)]    On Fig. 23 a further development is depicted, and two of the cocks are  seen to be squaring up for battle. Close behind and to the right of them  are seen (from left to right) the hen and the third cock, who are  watching to see the result of the contest, and another hen cowering for  protection against a cock with whom she has become established.    Fig. 24 shows the two combatants hard at it, using their weight as they  lean their breasts against one another, and rain in the blows with their  powerful flippers.    Fig. 25 shows the end of the fight, the victor having rushed the  vanquished cock before him out of the crowd and on to a patch of snow on  which, as he was too brave to turn and run, he knocked him down and gave  him a terrible hammering.    When his conqueror left him at length, he lay for some two minutes or so  on the ground, his heaving breast alone showing that he was alive, so  completely exhausted was he, but recovering himself at length he arose  and crawled away, a damaged flipper hanging limply by his side, and he  took no further part in the proceedings. The victorious bird rushed back  up the side of the knoll, and immediately fought the remaining cock, who  had not moved from his original position, putting him to flight, and  chasing him in and out of the crowd, the fugitive doubling and twisting  amongst it in a frantic endeavour to get away, and I quickly lost sight  of them.    Scenes of this kind became so common all over the rookery, that the roar  of battle and thuds of blows could be heard continuously, and of the  hundreds of such fights, all plainly had their cause in rivalry for the  hens.    When starting to fight, the cocks sometimes peck at each other with  their beaks, but always they very soon start to use their flippers,  standing up to one another and raining in the blows with such rapidity  as to make a sound which, in the words of Dr. Wilson, resembles that of  a boy running and dragging his hoop-stick along an iron paling. Soon  they start \"in-fighting,\" in which position one bird fights  right-handed, the other left-handed; that is to say, one leans his left  breast against his opponent, swinging in his blows with his right  flippers, the other presenting his right breast and using his left  flipper. My photographs of cocks fighting all show this plainly. It is  interesting to note that these birds, though fighting with one flipper  only, are ambidextrous. Whilst battering one another with might and main  they use their weight at the same time, and as one outlasts the other,  he drives his vanquished opponent before him over the ground, as a  trained boxing man, when \"in-fighting\" drives his exhausted opponent  round the ring.      [Illustration: Fig. 22. Three Cocks in Rivalry (See page 38)]      [Illustration: Fig. 23. Two of the Cocks squaring up for Battle    (See page 38)]    Desperate as these encounters are, I don't think one penguin ever kills  another. In many cases blood is drawn. I saw one with an eye put out,  and that side of its beak (the right side) clotted with blood, whilst  the crimson print of a blood-stained flipper across a white breast was  no uncommon sight.    Hard as they can hit with their flippers, however, they are also well  protected by their feathers, and being marvellously tough and enduring  the end of a hard fight merely finds the vanquished bird prostrate "]]]
