The murmuring sound of many voices announced the  approach of this animated, varied, and glittering life-stream.    But the genius of hospitality, never deficient in high-born courtesy,  and which, even while preserving the touching simplicity of primitive  manners, inspired in Poland all the refinements of the most advanced  state of civilization,--how could it be exiled from the details of a  dance so eminently Polish? After the host had, by inaugurating the fete,  rendered due homage to all who were present, any one of his guests had  the right to claim his place with the lady whom he had honored by his  choice. The new claimant, clapping his hands, to arrest for a moment the  ever moving cortege, bowed before the partner of the host, begging her  graciously to accept the change; while the host, from whom she had been  taken, made the same appeal to the lady next in course. This example was  followed by the whole train. Constantly changing partners, whenever a  new cavalier claimed the honor of leading the one first chosen by  the host, the ladies remained in the same succession during the whole  course; while, on the contrary, as the gentlemen continually replaced  each other, he who had commenced the dance, would, in its progress,  become the last, if not indeed entirely excluded before its close.    Each cavalier who placed himself in turn at the head of the column,  tried to surpass his predecessors in the novelty of the combinations of  his opening, in the complications of the windings through which he led  the expectant cortege; and this course, even when restricted to a  single saloon, might be made remarkable by the designing of graceful  arabesques, or the involved tracing of enigmatical ciphers. He made good  his claim to the place he had solicited, and displayed his skill, by  inventing close, complicated and inextricable figures; by describing  them with so much certainty and accuracy, that the living ribbon, turned  and twisted as it might be, was never broken in the loosing of its  wreathed knots; and by so leading, that no confusion or graceless  jostling should result from the complicated torsion. The succeeding  couples, who had only to follow the figures already given, and thus  continue the impulsion, were not permitted to drag themselves lazily  and listlessly along the parquet. The step was rhythmic, cadenced, and  undulating; the whole form swayed by graceful wavings and harmonious  balancings. They were careful never to advance with too much haste, nor  to replace each other as if driven on by some urgent necessity. On they  glided, like swans descending a tranquil stream, their flexile forms  swayed by the ebb and swell of unseen and gentle waves. Sometimes, the  gentleman offered the right, sometimes, the left hand to his partner;  touching only the points of her fingers, or clasping the slight hand  within his own, he passed now to her right, now to her left, without  yielding the snowy treasure. These complicated movements, being  instantaneously imitated by every pair, ran, like an electric shiver,  through the whole length of this gigantic serpent. Although apparently  occupied and absorbed by these multiplied manoeuvres, the cavalier yet  found time to bend to his lady and whisper sweet flatteries in her ear,  if she were young; if young no longer, to repose confidence, to urge  requests, or to repeat to her the news of the hour. Then, haughtily  raising himself, he would make the metal of his arms ring, caress his  thick moustache, giving to all his features an expression so vivid, that  the lady was forced to respond by the animation of her own countenance.    Thus, it was no hackneyed and senseless promenade which they executed;  it was, rather, a parade in which the whole splendor of the society  was exhibited, gratified with its own admiration, conscious of its own  elegance, brilliancy, nobility and courtesy. It was a constant display  of its lustre, its glory, its renown. Men grown gray in camps, or in  the strife of courtly eloquence; generals more often seen in the cuirass  than in the robes of peace; prelates and persons high in the Church;  dignitaries of State aged senators; warlike palatines; ambitious  castellans;--were the partners who were expected, welcomed, disputed and  sought for, by the youngest, gayest, and most brilliant women present.  Honor and glory rendered ages equal, and caused years to be forgotten  in this dance; nay, more, they gave an advantage even over love. It was  while listening to the animated descriptions of the almost forgotten  evolutions and dignified capabilities of this truly national dance, from  the lips of those who would never abandon the ancient Zupan and Kontusz,  and who still wore their hair closely cut round their temples, as it had  been worn by their ancestors, that we first fully understood in what a  high degree this haughty nation possessed the innate instinct of its own  exhibition, and how entirely it had succeeded, through its natural grace  and genius, in poetizing its love of ostentation by draping it in the  charms of noble emotions, and wrapping round it the glittering robes of  martial glory.    When we visited the country of Chopin, whose memory always accompanied  us like a faithful guide who constantly keeps our interest excited,  we were fortunate enough to meet with some of the peculiar characters,  daily growing more rare, because European civilization, even where it  does not modify the basis of character, effaces asperities, and moulds  exterior forms. We there encountered some of those men gifted with  superior intellect, cultivated and strongly developed by a life of  incessant action, yet whose horizon does not extend beyond the limits of  their own country, their own society, their own traditions. During our  intercourse, facilitated by an interpreter, with these men of past  days, we were able to study them and to understand the secret of their  greatness. It was really curious to observe the inimitable originality  caused by the utter exclusiveness of the view taken by them. This  limited cultivation, while it greatly diminishes the value of their  ideas upon many subjects, at the same time gifts the mind with  a peculiar force, almost resembling the keen scent and the acute  perceptions of the savage, for all the things near and dear to it. Only  from a mind of this peculiar training, marked by a concentrative energy  that nothing can distract from its course, every thing beyond the circle  of its own nationality remaining alien to it, can we hope to obtain  an exact picture of the past; for it alone, like a faithful mirror,  reflects it in its primal coloring, preserves its proper lights and  shades, and gives it with its varied and picturesque accompaniments.  From such minds alone can we obtain, with the ritual of customs which  are rapidly becoming extinct, the spirit from which they emanated.  Chopin was born too late, and left the domestic hearth too early, to be  himself in possession of this spirit; but he had known many examples of  it, and, through the memories which surrounded his childhood, even more  fully than through the literature and history of his country, he found  by induction the secrets of its ancient prestige, which he evoked from  the dim and dark land of forgetfulness, and, through the magic of his  poetic art, endowed with immortal youth. Poets are better comprehended  and appreciated by those who have made themselves familiar with the  countries which inspired their songs. Pindar is more fully understood by  those who have seen the Parthenon bathed in the radiance of its limpid  atmosphere; Ossian, by those familiar with the mountains of Scotland,  with their heavy veils and long wreaths of mist. The feelings which  inspired the creations of Chopin can only be fully appreciated by those  who have visited his country. They must have seen the giant shadows  of past centuries gradually increasing, and veiling the ground as the  gloomy night of despair rolled on; they must have felt the electric and  mystic influence of that strange \"phantom of glory\" forever haunting  martyred Poland. Even in the gayest hours of festival, it appalls and  saddens all hearts. Whenever a tale of past renown, a commemoration of  slaughtered heroes is given, an allusion to national prowess is made,  its resurrection from the grave is instantaneous; it takes its place  in the banquet-hall, spreading an electric terror mingled with intense  admiration; a shudder, wild and mystic as that which seizes upon the  peasants of Ukraine, when the \"Beautiful Virgin,\" white as Death, with  her girdle of crimson, is suddenly seen gliding through their tranquil  village, while her shadowy hand marks with blood the door of each  cottage doomed to destruction.    During many centuries, the civilization of Poland was entirely peculiar  and aboriginal; it did not resemble that of any other country; and,  indeed, it seems destined to remain forever unique in its kind. As  different from the German feudalism which neighboured it upon the West,  as from the conquering spirit of the Turks which disquieted it on  the East, it resembled Europe in its chivalric Christianity, in its  eagerness to attack the infidel, even while receiving instruction in  sagacious policy, in military tactics, and sententious reasoning, from  the masters of Byzantium. By the assumption, at the same time, of the  heroic qualities of Mussulman fanaticism and the sublime virtues of  Christian sanctity and humility, [Footnote: It is well known with how  many glorious names Poland has enriched the martyrology of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4389"],[0,"Roughing It in the Bush (#6)"],[1,"country.    Girls, who were scarcely able to wash a floor decently, talked of  service with contempt, unless tempted to change their resolution by  the offer of twelve dollars a month. To endeavour to undeceive them  was a useless and ungracious task. After having tried it with  several without success, I left it to time and bitter experience to  restore them to their sober senses. In spite of the remonstrances  of the captain, and the dread of the cholera, they all rushed on  shore to inspect the land of Goshen, and to endeavour to realise  their absurd anticipations.    We were favoured, a few minutes after our arrival, with another  visit from the health-officers; but in this instance both the  gentlemen were Canadians. Grave, melancholy-looking men, who  talked much and ominously of the prevailing disorder, and the  impossibility of strangers escaping from its fearful ravages.  This was not very consoling, and served to depress the cheerful  tone of mind which, after all, is one of the best antidotes  against this awful scourge. The cabin seemed to lighten, and  the air to circulate more freely, after the departure of these  professional ravens. The captain, as if by instinct, took an  additional glass of grog, to shake off the sepulchral gloom  their presence had inspired.    The visit of the doctors was followed by that of two of the  officials of the Customs--vulgar, illiterate men, who, seating  themselves at the cabin table, with a familiar nod to the captain,  and a blank stare at us, commenced the following dialogue:--    Custom-house officer (after making inquiries as to the general  cargo of the vessel): \"Any good brandy on board, captain?\"    Captain (gruffly): \"Yes.\"    Officer: \"Best remedy for the cholera known. The only one the  doctors can depend upon.\"    Captain (taking the hint): \"Gentlemen, I'll send you up a dozen  bottles this afternoon.\"    Officer: \"Oh, thank you. We are sure to get it genuine from you.  Any Edinburgh ale in your freight?\"    Captain (with a slight shrug): \"A few hundreds in cases. I'll send  you a dozen with the brandy.\"    Both: \"Capital!\"    First officer: \"Any short, large-bowled, Scotch pipes, with metallic  lids?\"    Captain (quite impatiently): \"Yes, yes; I'll send you some to smoke,  with the brandy. What else?\"    Officer: \"We will now proceed to business.\"    My readers would have laughed, as I did, could they have seen how  doggedly the old man shook his fist after these worthies as they  left the vessel. \"Scoundrels!\" he muttered to himself; and then  turning to me, \"They rob us in this barefaced manner, and we dare  not resist or complain, for fear of the trouble they can put us to.  If I had those villains at sea, I'd give them a taste of brandy and  ale that they would not relish.\"    The day wore away, and the lengthened shadows of the mountains fell  upon the waters, when the Horsley Hill, a large three-masted vessel  from Waterford, that we had left at the quarantine station, cast  anchor a little above us. She was quickly boarded by the  health-officers, and ordered round to take up her station below the  castle. To accomplish this object she had to heave her anchor; when  lo! a great pine-tree, which had been sunk in the river, became  entangled in the chains. Uproarious was the mirth to which the  incident gave rise among the crowds that thronged the decks of  the many vessels then at anchor in the river. Speaking-trumpets  resounded on every side; and my readers may be assured that the  sea-serpent was not forgotten in the multitude of jokes which  followed.    Laughter resounded on all sides; and in the midst of the noise  and confusion, the captain of the Horsley Hill hoisted his  colours downwards, as if making signals of distress, a mistake  which provoked renewed and long-continued mirth.    I laughed until my sides ached; little thinking how the Horsley  Hill would pay us off for our mistimed hilarity.    Towards night, most of the steerage passengers returned, greatly  dissatisfied with their first visit to the city, which they  declared to be a filthy hole, that looked a great deal better from  the ship's side than it did on shore. This, I have often been told,  is literally the case. Here, as elsewhere, man has marred the  magnificent creation of his Maker.    A dark and starless night closed in, accompanied by cold winds and  drizzling rain. We seemed to have made a sudden leap from the  torrid to the frigid zone. Two hours before, my light summer  clothing was almost insupportable, and now a heavy and well-lined  plaid formed but an inefficient screen from the inclemency of the  weather. After watching for some time the singular effect produced  by the lights in the town reflected in the water, and weary with a  long day of anticipation and excitement, I made up my mind to leave  the deck and retire to rest. I had just settled down my baby in her  berth, when the vessel struck, with a sudden crash that sent a  shiver through her whole frame. Alarmed, but not aware of the real  danger that hung over us, I groped my way to the cabin, and thence  ascended to the deck.    Here a scene of confusion prevailed that baffles description. By  some strange fatality, the Horsley Hill had changed her position,  and run foul of us in the dark. The Anne was a small brig, and her  unlucky neighbour a heavy three-masted vessel, with three hundred  Irish emigrants on board; and as her bowspirit was directly across  the bows of the Anne, and she anchored, and unable to free herself  from the deadly embrace, there was no small danger of the poor brig  going down in the unequal struggle.    Unable to comprehend what was going on, I raised my head above my  companion ladder, just at the critical moment when the vessels were  grappled together. The shrieks of the women, the shouts and oaths  of the men, and the barking of the dogs in either ship, aided the  dense darkness of the night in producing a most awful and stunning  effect.    \"What is the matter?\" I gasped out. \"What is the reason of this  dreadful confusion?\"    The captain was raging like a chafed bull, in the grasp of several  frantic women, who were clinging, shrieking, to his knees.    With great difficulty I persuaded the women to accompany me below.  The mate hurried off with the cabin light upon the deck, and we  were left in total darkness to await the result.    A deep, strange silence fell upon my heart. It was not exactly  fear, but a sort of nerving of my spirit to meet the worst. The  cowardly behaviour of my companions inspired me with courage.  I was ashamed of their pusillanimity and want of faith in the  Divine Providence. I sat down, and calmly begged them to follow  my example.    An old woman, called Williamson, a sad reprobate, in attempting  to do so, set her foot within the fender, which the captain had  converted into a repository for empty glass bottles; the smash  that ensued was echoed by a shriek from the whole party.    \"God guide us,\" cried the ancient dame; \"but we are going into  eternity. I shall be lost; my sins are more in number than the  hairs of my head.\" This confession was followed by oaths and  imprecations too blasphemous to repeat.    Shocked and disgusted at her profanity, I bade her pray, and not  waste the few moments that might be hers in using oaths and bad  language.    \"Did you not hear the crash?\" said she.    \"I did; it was of your own making. Sit down and be quiet.\"    Here followed another shock, that made the vessel heave and  tremble; and the dragging of the anchor increased the uneasy  motion which began to fill the boldest of us with alarm.    \"Mrs. Moodie, we are lost,\" said Margaret Williamson, the youngest  daughter of the old woman, a pretty girl, who had been the belle  of the ship, flinging herself on her knees before me, and grasping  both my hands in hers. \"Oh, pray for me! pray for me! I cannot,  I dare not, pray for myself; I was never taught a prayer.\" Her  voice was choked with convulsive sobs, and scalding tears fell in  torrents from her eyes over my hands. I never witnessed such an  agony of despair. Before I could say one word to comfort her,  another shock seemed to lift the vessel upwards. I felt my own  blood run cold, expecting instantly to go down; and thoughts of  death, and the unknown eternity at our feet, flitted vaguely  through my mind.    \"If we stay here, we shall perish,\" cried the girl, springing to  her feet. \"Let us go on deck, mother, and take our chance with the  rest.\"    \"Stay,\" I said; \"you are safer here. British sailors never leave  women to perish. You have fathers, husbands, brothers on board, who  will not forget you. I beseech you to remain patiently here until  the danger is past.\" I might as well have preached to the winds.  The headstrong creatures would no longer be controlled. They rushed  simultaneously upon deck, just as the Horsley Hill swung off,  carrying with her part of the outer frame of our deck and the  larger portion of our stern. When tranquillity was restored,  fatigued both in mind and body, I sunk into a profound sleep, and  did not awake until the sun had risen high above the wave-encircled  fortress of Quebec.    The stormy clouds had all dispersed during the night; the air was  clear and balmy; the giant hills were robed in a blue, soft mist,  which rolled around them in fleecy volumes. As the beams of the sun  penetrated their shadowy folds, they gradually drew up like a  curtain, and dissolved like wreaths of smoke into the clear air.    The moment I came on deck, my old friend Oscar greeted me with his  usual joyous bark, and with the sagacity peculiar to his species,  proceeded to shew me all the damage done to the vessel during the  night. It was laughable to watch the motions of the poor brute, as  he ran from place to place, stopping before, or jumping upon, every  fractured portion of the deck, and barking out his indignation at  the ruinous condition in"]]]
