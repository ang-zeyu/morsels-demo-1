The course of study at this University has always included Natural  Philosophy, as well as Pure Mathematics.  To diffuse a sound knowledge  of Physics, and to imbue the minds of our students with correct  dynamical principles, have been long regarded as among our highest  functions, and very few of us can now place ourselves in the mental  condition in which even such philosophers as the great Descartes were  involved in the days before Newton had announced the true laws of the  motion of bodies.  Indeed the cultivation and diffusion of sound  dynamical ideas has already effected a great change in the language  and thoughts even of those who make no pretensions to science, and we  are daily receiving fresh proofs that the popularisation of scientific  doctrines is producing as great an alteration in the mental state of  society as the material applications of science are effecting in its  outward life.  Such indeed is the respect paid to science, that the  most absurd opinions may become current, provided they are expressed  in language, the sound of which recals some well-known scientific  phrase.  If society is thus prepared to receive all kinds of  scientific doctrines, it is our part to provide for the diffusion and  cultivation, not only of true scientific principles, but of a spirit  of sound criticism, founded on an examination of the evidences on  which statements apparently scientific depend.    When we shall be able to employ in scientific education, not only the  trained attention of the student, and his familiarity with symbols,  but the keenness of his eye, the quickness of his ear, the delicacy of  his touch, and the adroitness of his fingers, we shall not only extend  our influence over a class of men who are not fond of cold  abstractions, but, by opening at once all the gateways of knowledge,  we shall ensure the association of the doctrines of science with those  elementary sensations which form the obscure background of all our  conscious thoughts, and which lend a vividness and relief to ideas,  which, when presented as mere abstract terms, are apt to fade entirely  from the memory.    In a course of Experimental Physics we may consider either the Physics  or the Experiments as the leading feature.  We may either employ the  experiments to illustrate the phenomena of a particular branch of  Physics, or we may make some physical research in order to exemplify a  particular experimental method.  In the order of time, we should  begin, in the Lecture Room, with a course of lectures on some branch  of Physics aided by experiments of illustration, and conclude, in the  Laboratory, with a course of experiments of research.    Let me say a few words on these two classes of  experiments,--Experiments of Illustration and Experiments of Research.  The aim of an experiment of illustration is to throw light upon some  scientific idea so that the student may be enabled to grasp it.  The  circumstances of the experiment are so arranged that the phenomenon  which we wish to observe or to exhibit is brought into prominence,  instead of being obscured and entangled among other phenomena, as it  is when it occurs in the ordinary course of nature.  To exhibit  illustrative experiments, to encourage others to make them, and to  cultivate in every way the ideas on which they throw light, forms an  important part of our duty.  The simpler the materials of an  illustrative experiment, and the more familiar they are to the  student, the more thoroughly is he likely to acquire the idea which it  is meant to illustrate.  The educational value of such experiments is  often inversely proportional to the complexity of the apparatus.  The  student who uses home-made apparatus, which is always going wrong,  often learns more than one who has the use of carefully adjusted  instruments, to which he is apt to trust, and which he dares not take  to pieces.    It is very necessary that those who are trying to learn from books the  facts of physical science should be enabled by the help of a few  illustrative experiments to recognise these facts when they meet with  them out of doors.  Science appears to us with a very different aspect  after we have found out that it is not in lecture rooms only, and by  means of the electric light projected on a screen, that we may witness  physical phenomena, but that we may find illustrations of the highest  doctrines of science in games and gymnastics, in travelling by land  and by water, in storms of the air and of the sea, and wherever there  is matter in motion.    This habit of recognising principles amid the endless variety of their  action can never degrade our sense of the sublimity of nature, or mar  our enjoyment of its beauty.  On the contrary, it tends to rescue our  scientific ideas from that vague condition in which we too often leave  them, buried among the other products of a lazy credulity, and to  raise them into their proper position among the doctrines in which our  faith is so assured, that we are ready at all times to act on them.    Experiments of illustration may be of very different kinds.  Some may  be adaptations of the commonest operations of ordinary life, others  may be carefully arranged exhibitions of some phenomenon which occurs  only under peculiar conditions.  They all, however, agree in this,  that their aim is to present some phenomenon to the senses of the  student in such a way that he may associate with it the appropriate  scientific idea.  When he has grasped this idea, the experiment which  illustrates it has served its purpose.    In an experiment of research, on the other hand, this is not the  principal aim.  It is true that an experiment, in which the principal  aim is to see what happens under certain conditions, may be regarded  as an experiment of research by those who are not yet familiar with  the result, but in experimental researches, strictly so called, the  ultimate object is to measure something which we have already seen--to  obtain a numerical estimate of some magnitude.    Experiments of this class--those in which measurement of some kind is  involved, are the proper work of a Physical Laboratory.  In every  experiment we have first to make our senses familiar with the  phenomenon, but we must not stop here, we must find out which of its  features are capable of measurement, and what measurements are  required in order to make a complete specification of the phenomenon.  We must then make these measurements, and deduce from them the result  which we require to find.    This characteristic of modern experiments--that they consist  principally of measurements,--is so prominent, that the opinion seems  to have got abroad, that in a few years all the great physical  constants will have been approximately estimated, and that the only  occupation which will then be left to men of science will be to carry  on these measurements to another place of decimals.    If this is really the state of things to which we are approaching, our  Laboratory may perhaps become celebrated as a place of conscientious  labour and consummate skill, but it will be out of place in the  University, and ought rather to be classed with the other great  workshops of our country, where equal ability is directed to more  useful ends.    But we have no right to think thus of the unsearchable riches of  creation, or of the untried fertility of those fresh minds into which  these riches will continue to be poured.  It may possibly be true  that, in some of those fields of discovery which lie open to such  rough observations as can be made without artificial methods, the  great explorers of former times have appropriated most of what is  valuable, and that the gleanings which remain are sought after, rather  for their abstruseness, than for their intrinsic worth.  But the  history of science shews that even during that phase of her progress  in which she devotes herself to improving the accuracy of the  numerical measurement of quantities with which she has long been  familiar, she is preparing the materials for the subjugation of new  regions, which would have remained unknown if she had been contented  with the rough methods of her early pioneers.  I might bring forward  instances gathered from every branch of science, shewing how the  labour of careful measurement has been rewarded by the discovery of  new fields of research, and by the development of new scientific  ideas.  But the history of the science of terrestrial magnetism  affords us a sufficient example of what may be done by Experiments in  Concert, such as we hope some day to perform in our Laboratory.    That celebrated traveller, Humboldt, was profoundly impressed with the  scientific value of a combined effort to be made by the observers of  all nations, to obtain accurate measurements of the magnetism of the  earth; and we owe it mainly to his enthusiasm for science, his great  reputation and his wide-spread influence, that not only private men of  science, but the governments of most of the civilised nations, our own  among the number, were induced to take part in the enterprise.  But  the actual working out of the scheme, and the arrangements by which  the labours of the observers were so directed as to obtain the best  results, we owe to the great mathematician Gauss, working along with  Weber, the future founder of the science of electro-magnetic  measurement, in the magnetic observatory of Gottingen, and aided by  the skill of the instrument-maker Leyser.  These men, however, did not  work alone.  Numbers of scientific men joined the Magnetic Union,  learned the use of the new instruments and the new methods of reducing  the observations; and in every city of Europe you might see them, at  certain stated times, sitting, each in his cold wooden shed, with his  eye fixed at the telescope, his ear attentive to the clock, and his  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4912"],[0,"Wacousta : a tale of the Pontiac conspiracy (Complete) (#6)"],[1,"from his rooms into the open area of the parade, clad in  his dressing-gown, and bearing a lamp in one hand and a naked sword in  the other. His countenance was pale; and his features, violently  agitated, betrayed a source of alarm which those who were familiar with  his usual haughtiness of manner were ill able to comprehend.    \"Which way did he go?--why stand ye here?--follow--pursue him  quickly--let him not escape, on your lives!\"    These sentences, hurriedly and impatiently uttered, were addressed to  the two sentinels who, stationed in front of his apartments, had, on  the first sound of alarm from the portentous bell, lowered their  muskets to the charge, and now stood immovable in that position.    \"Who does your honour mane?\" replied one of the men, startled, yet  bringing his arms to the recover, in salutation of his chief.    \"Why, the man--the stranger--the fellow who has just passed you.\"    \"Not a living soul has passed us since our watch commenced, your  honour,\" observed the second sentinel; \"and we have now been here  upwards of an hour.\"    \"Impossible, sirs: ye have been asleep on your posts, or ye must have  seen him. He passed this way, and could not have escaped your  observation had ye been attentive to your duty.\"    \"Well, sure, and your honour knows bist,\" rejoined the first sentinel;  \"but so hilp me St. Patrick, as I have sirved man and boy in your  honour's rigimint this twilve years, not even the fitch of a man has  passed me this blissed night. And here's my comrade, Jack Halford, who  will take his Bible oath to the same, with all due difirince to your  honour.\"    The pithy reply to this eloquent attempt at exculpation was a brief  \"Silence, sirrah, walk about!\"    The men brought their muskets once more, and in silence, to the  shoulder, and, in obedience to the command of their chief, resumed the  limited walk allotted to them; crossing each other at regular intervals  in the semicircular course that enfiladed, as it were, the only  entrance to the Governor's apartments.    Meanwhile every thing was bustle and commotion among the garrison, who,  roused from sleep by the appalling sound of the alarm bell at that late  hour, were hastily arming. Throughout the obscurity might be seen the  flitting forms of men, whose already fully accoutred persons proclaimed  them to be of the guard; while in the lofty barracks, numerous lights  flashing to and fro, and moving with rapidity, attested the alacrity  with which the troops off duty were equipping themselves for some  service of more than ordinary interest. So noiseless, too, was this  preparation, as far as speech was concerned, that the occasional  opening and shutting of pans, and ringing of ramrods to ascertain the  efficiency of the muskets, might be heard distinctly in the stillness  of the night at a distance of many furlongs.    HE, however, who had touched the secret spring of all this picturesque  movement, whatever might be his gratification and approval of the  promptitude with which the summons to arms had been answered by his  brave troops, was far from being wholly satisfied with the scene he had  conjured up. Recovered from the first and irrepressible agitation which  had driven him to sound the tocsin of alarm, he felt how derogatory to  his military dignity and proverbial coolness of character it might be  considered, to have awakened a whole garrison from their slumbers, when  a few files of the guard would have answered his purpose equally well.  Besides, so much time had been suffered to elapse, that the stranger  might have escaped; and if so, how many might be disposed to ridicule  his alarm, and consider it as emanating from an imagination disturbed  by sleep, rather than caused by the actual presence of one endowed like  themselves with the faculties of speech and motion. For a moment he  hesitated whether he should not countermand the summons to arms which  had been so precipitately given; but when he recollected the harrowing  threat that had been breathed in his ear by his midnight visiter,--when  he reflected, moreover, that even now it was probable he was lurking  within the precincts of the fort with a view to the destruction of all  that it contained,--when, in short, he thought of the imminent danger  that must attend them should he be suffered to escape,--he felt the  necessity of precaution, and determined on his measures, even at the  risk of manifesting a prudence which might be construed unfavourably.  On re-entering his apartments, he found his orderly, who, roused by the  midnight tumult, stood waiting to receive the commands of his chief.    \"Desire Major Blackwater to come to me immediately.\"    The mandate was quickly obeyed. In a few seconds a short, thick-set,  and elderly officer made his appearance in a grey military undress  frock.    \"Blackwater, we have traitors within the fort. Let diligent search be  made in every part of the barracks for a stranger, an enemy, who has  managed to procure admittance among us: let every nook and cranny,  every empty cask, be examined forthwith; and cause a number of  additional sentinels to be stationed along the ramparts, in order to  intercept his escape.\"    \"Good Heaven, is it possible?\" said the Major, wiping the perspiration  from his brows, though the night was unusually chilly for the season of  the year:--\"how could he contrive to enter a place so vigilantly  guarded?\"    \"Ask me not HOW, Blackwater,\" returned the Governor seriously; \"let it  suffice that he has been in this very room, and that ten minutes since  he stood where you now stand.\"    The Major looked aghast.--\"God bless me, how singular! How could the  savage contrive to obtain admission? or was he in reality an Indian?\"    \"No more questions, MAJOR Blackwater. Hasten to distribute the men, and  let diligent search be made every where; and recollect, neither officer  nor man courts his pillow until dawn.\"    The \"Major\" emphatically prefixed to his name was a sufficient hint to  the stout officer that the doubts thus familiarly expressed were here  to cease, and that he was now addressed in the language of authority by  his superior, who expected a direct and prompt compliance with his  orders. He therefore slightly touched his hat in salutation, and  withdrew to make the dispositions that had been enjoined by his Colonel.    On regaining the parade, he caused the men, already forming into  companies and answering to the roll-call of their respective  non-commissioned officers, to be wheeled into square, and then in a low  but distinct voice stated the cause of alarm; and, having communicated  the orders of the Governor, finished by recommending to each the  exercise of the most scrutinising vigilance; as on the discovery of the  individual in question, and the means by which he had contrived to  procure admission, the safety of the whole garrison, it was evident,  must depend.    The soldiers now dispersed in small parties throughout the interior of  the fort, while a select body were conducted to the ramparts by the  officers themselves, and distributed between the sentinels already  posted there, in such numbers, and at such distances, that it appeared  impossible any thing wearing the human form could pass them  unperceived, even in the obscurity that reigned around.    When this duty was accomplished, the officers proceeded to the posts of  the several sentinels who had been planted since the last relief, to  ascertain if any or either of them had observed aught to justify the  belief that an enemy had succeeded in scaling the works. To all their  enquiries, however, they received a negative reply, accompanied by a  declaration, more or less positive with each, that such had been their  vigilance during the watch, had any person come within their beat,  detection must have been inevitable. The first question was put to the  sentinel stationed at the gate of the fort, at which point the whole of  the officers of the garrison were, with one or two exceptions, now  assembled. The man at first evinced a good deal of confusion; but this  might arise from the singular fact of the alarm that had been given,  and the equally singular circumstance of his being thus closely  interrogated by the collective body of his officers: he, however,  persisted in declaring that he had been in no wise inattentive to his  duty, and that no cause for alarm or suspicion had occurred near his  post. The officers then, in order to save time, separated into two  parties, pursuing opposite circuits, and arranging to meet at that  point of the ramparts which was immediately in the rear, and  overlooking the centre of the semicircular sweep of wild forest we have  described as circumventing the fort.    \"Well, Blessington, I know not what you think of this sort of work,\"  observed Sir Everard Valletort, a young lieutenant of the ----  regiment, recently arrived from England, and one of the party who now  traversed the rampart to the right; \"but confound me if I would not  rather be a barber's apprentice in London, upon nothing, and find  myself, than continue a life of this kind much longer. It positively  quite knocks me up; for what with early risings, and watchings (I had  almost added prayings), I am but the shadow of my former self.\"    \"Hist, Valletort, hist! speak lower,\" said Captain Blessington, the  senior officer present, \"or our search must be in vain. Poor fellow!\"  he pursued, laughing low and good humouredly at the picture of miseries  thus solemnly enumerated by his subaltern;--\"how much, in truth, are  you to be pitied, who have so recently basked in all the sunshine of  enjoyment at home. For our parts, we have lived so long amid these  savage scenes, that we have almost forgotten what luxury, or even  comfort, means. Doubt not, my friend, that in time you will, like us,  be reconciled to the change.\"    \"Confound me for an idiot, then, if I give myself time,\" replied Sir"]]]
