Of course, for hundreds of years there has been talk of the Jews  returning to Jerusalem, and from time to time societies have been  formed to keep alive that hope, and keep the Jew's face turned toward  the chief city and land of his forefathers; but little was achieved by  those societies, however, except to foster the hope of Israel's return  in the heart of a widely dispersed, persecuted and discouraged race,  who have waited long for the realization of the promises made to their  fathers. I say but \"little\" was accomplished by the various Jewish  societies existing before the Zionite movement began beyond fostering  the hope of Israel based on the predictions of their prophets; but that  \"little\" was much. It was nourishing in secret and through ages of  darkness that spark of fire which when touched with the breath of God  should burst forth into a flame that not all the world could stay. They  made possible this larger movement, now attracting the attention of the  world, and know as the \"Zionite Movement;\" which, in reality, is but  the federation of all Jewish societies which have had for their purpose  the realization of the hopes of scattered Israel.    \"Zionism\" is considered to have grown out of the persecution of the  Jews during the last eighteen years in such European countries as  Russia, France, Germany, and Romania. It held its first general {XXIX}  conference in August, 1897, in Basle, Switzerland; and since then has  continued to hold annual conferences that have steadily increased both  in interest and the number of delegates representing various Jewish  societies, until now it takes on the appearance of one of the world's  great movements. It is not so much a religious movement as a racial  one: for prominent Jews of all shades of both political and religious  opinions have participated in it under the statesmanlike leadership of  Doctor Herzel of Austria. Not to persecution alone, however, is due  this strange awakening desire on the part of the Jews to return to the  city and the land of their fathers; but to the fact of the restoration  of the keys of the gathering of Israel by Moses to the Prophet of the  Dispensation of the Fullness of Times. Under the divine authority  restored by Moses, Joseph Smith sent an Apostle of the Lord Jesus  Christ to the land of Palestine to bless it and dedicate it once more  to the Lord for the return of His people. This Apostle was Orson Hyde,  and he performed his mission in 1840-2. In 1872 an Apostolic delegation  consisting of the late Presidents George A. Smith and Lorenzo Snow  were sent to Palestine. The purpose of their mission, in part, is  thus stated in President Young's letter of appointment to George A.  Smith: \"When you get to the land of Palestine, we wish you to dedicate  and consecrate that land to the Lord, that it may be blessed with  fruitfulness, preparatory to the return of the Jews, in fulfillment  of prophecy and the accomplishment of the purposes of our heavenly  Father.\" [10]    Acting, then, under the divine authority restored to earth by the  Prophet Moses, this Apostolic delegation--as well as the Apostle first  sent--from the summit of Mount Olivet blessed the land, and again  dedicated it for the return of the Jews. It is not strange, therefore,  to those who look upon such a movement as Zionism in connection with  faith in God's great latter-day work, to see this spirit now moving  upon the minds of the Jewish people prompting their return to the  land of their fathers. It is but the breath of God upon their souls  turning their hearts to the promises made to the fathers. It is but  the fulfillment in part of one of the many prophecies of the Book of  Mormon relating to the gathering of Israel, viz: \"It shall come to pass  that the Lord God shall commence His work among all nations, kindreds,  tongues, and people, to bring about the restoration of the keys of His  people upon the earth.\" The spirit attendant upon the restoration of  the keys of authority to gather Israel from the four quarters of the  earth, and the exercise of that divine authority, though unrecognized  as yet by the world, is the real cause of this movement Palestine-ward  by the Jews.    _Elijah's Mission_.    The work accomplished by Elijah in giving to the Prophet Joseph the  particular dispensation of the Priesthood which should plant in the  {XXX} hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers--lest  the whole earth should be utterly wasted at His coming [11]--is  attended by evidences of virtue and power of God no less palpable than  those which bear witness to the virtue and power of God in the work  accomplished by Moses in giving to the Prophet the keys of authority  for the gathering of Israel. The work done by Elijah was to open the  door of salvation for the dead. From that event comes the knowledge of  the principles by which the saving power of the Gospel may be applied  to men who have died without receiving its benefits in this life. From  of old men had read in the scriptures that Messiah would bring out the  prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the  prison house; [12] that in addition to being given as a restorer of  the tribes of Jacob and a light to the gentiles, the Messiah should  have power to say to the prisoners, \"Go forth; to them that sit in  darkness, show yourselves;\" [13] \"to proclaim liberty to the captives,  and the opening of the prison to them that are bound.\" [14] From  the beginning of Christianity men had read in the New Testament how  Jesus had once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust; and how  that being put to death in the flesh He was quickened by the Spirit  by which He went and preached to the spirits in prison which were  disobedient when the long suffering of God waited in the days of Noah.  [15] Also they read how for this cause was the Gospel preached to  them that are dead that they might be judged as men are in the flesh,  but live according to God in the spirit; [16] also the reasoning of  Paul to the effect that if there was no resurrection of the dead,  why, then, were the Saints baptized for the dead; [17] also how the  fathers without those of later generations cannot be made perfect.  [18] All of which passages, however, have been regarded as among the  mysteries of the word of God, incomprehensible, dark. But touched by  the Prophet Elijah's hand, imparting to them their true import, how  bright they glow with spiritual light and life! and what a sense of  largeness and power is given to the Gospel of Jesus Christ when from  this mission of Elijah's there comes the power to apply the principles  and ordinances of salvation to all the children of men (save the sons  of perdition; and these, thank God! are but few) in all ages of the  world, and whether living or dead! How the horizon of things respecting  the Gospel of Christ is pushed back from the walled-in limits of that  pseudo-Christianity current among men, by this spirit and power of  Elijah that has come into the {XXXI} world! The fact that such a spirit  has come into the world is sustained by palpable evidences. The truth  of my statement will be recognized when I say that within the last  fifty years there has arisen throughout the world an increased spirit  of interest among men concerning their ancestors that scarcely stops  this side of the marvelous. In all lands men are earnestly seeking for  their genealogies, and many volumes are issued from the press annually  in which the pedigrees of men of all sorts and conditions are given.  Some may be said to be possessed almost of a mania, on this subject  so ardent are they in seeking for a knowledge of their fore-fathers,  and this all quite apart from any direct work that is being done  along the same lines by the Latter-Day Saints; though the work of the  Saints in the temples for their dead is greatly helped by this outside  circumstance to which I call attention. Why and whence this spirit  in the hearts of the children which turns the attention of men to  the fathers of former generations, if it is not a consequence of the  fulfillment of Elijah's predicted mission that before the great and  dreadful day of the Lord should come he [Elijah] would be sent to turn  the heart of the children to the fathers, and the heart of the fathers  to the children? [19]    Of the work done by the Latter-Day Saints in consequence of the  restoration of these special keys of the Priesthood by the hand of  Elijah I need scarcely speak. That the spirit which came into the world  by reason of Elijah's special dispensation of authority to Joseph Smith  is working upon the hearts of the Latter-Day Saints is evidenced by  the building of the beautiful temple at Nauvoo, and by the erection  of the world-famed temple in Salt Lake City; also by the erection of  magnificent temples in Logan, Manti, and St. George--all in Utah. These  temples have all been erected in response to the diffusion of that  spirit that attended upon Elijah's mission; and are evidences in stone  that the Saints have partaken of that spirit which turns the hearts  of the children to the fathers. Another palpable evidence to the same  great truth is seen in the throngs which daily visit these temples to  perform the ordinances of salvation for the dead; not only baptism  for the dead, but also the confirmations, ordinations and sealings by  which the fathers shall be prepared for the kingdom of God, and all the  families of men be set in order, united together by bonds, covenants  and established relations that shall be in harmony with that heavenly  kingdom which the redeemed of God shall inherit. The full importance of  this work--its height and depth--is not yet appreciated by the children  of men; but so great it is that the period of our Church History which  witnesses its beginning--even if it were the only achievement--must  ever be regarded as an important"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4723"],[0,"A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (#6)"],[1,"a mind, that their BEING (ESSE) is to be perceived  or known; that consequently so long as they are not actually perceived by  me, or do not exist in my mind or that of any other CREATED SPIRIT, they  must either have no existence at all, OR ELSE SUBSIST IN THE MIND OF SOME  ETERNAL SPIRIT--it being perfectly unintelligible, and involving all the  absurdity of abstraction, to attribute to any single part of them an  existence independent of a spirit [Note.]. To be convinced of which, the  reader need only reflect, and try to separate in his own thoughts the  being of a sensible thing from its being perceived.    [Note: \"To make this appear with all the light and evidence of an axiom,  it seems sufficient if I can but awaken the reflection of the reader,  that he may take an impartial view of his own meaning, and in turn his  thoughts upon the subject itself, free and disengaged from all embarrass  of words and prepossession in favour of received mistakes.\"--Edit 1710]    7. SECOND ARGUMENT.[Note.]--From what has been said it follows there is  NOT ANY OTHER SUBSTANCE THAN SPIRIT, or that which perceives. But, for the  fuller proof of this point, let it be considered the sensible qualities  are colour, figure, motion, smell, taste, etc., i.e. the ideas perceived  by sense. Now, for an idea to exist in an unperceiving thing is a  manifest contradiction, for TO HAVE AN IDEA IS ALL ONE AS TO PERCEIVE;  that therefore wherein colour, figure, and the like qualities exist must  perceive them; hence it is clear there can be no UNTHINKING substance or  SUBSTRATUM of those ideas.    [Note: Vide sect. iii. and xxv.]    8. OBJECTION.--ANSWER.--But, say you, though the ideas themselves do not  exist without the mind, yet there may be things LIKE them, whereof they  are copies or resemblances, which things exist without the mind in an  unthinking substance. I ANSWER, an idea can be like nothing but an idea; a  colour or figure can be like nothing but another colour or figure. If we  look but never so little into our thoughts, we shall find it impossible  for us to conceive a likeness except only between our ideas. Again, I ask  whether those supposed originals or external things, of which our ideas  are the pictures or representations, be themselves perceivable or no? If  they are, THEN THEY ARE IDEAS and we have gained our point; but if you say  they are not, I appeal to any one whether it be sense to assert a colour  is like something which is invisible; hard or soft, like something which  is intangible; and so of the rest.    9. THE PHILOSOPHICAL NOTION OF MATTER INVOLVES A CONTRADICTION.--Some  there are who make a DISTINCTION betwixt PRIMARY and SECONDARY  qualities. By the former they mean extension, figure, motion, rest,  solidity or impenetrability, and number; by the latter they denote all  other sensible qualities, as colours, sounds, tastes, and so forth. The  ideas we have of these they acknowledge not to be the resemblances of  anything existing without the mind, or unperceived, but they will have  our ideas of the primary qualities to be patterns or images of things  which exist without the mind, in an unthinking substance which they call  MATTER. By MATTER, therefore, we are to understand an inert, senseless  substance, in which extension, figure, and motion DO ACTUALLY SUBSIST.  But it is evident from what we have already shown, that extension,  figure, and motion are ONLY IDEAS EXISTING IN THE MIND, and that an idea  can be like nothing but another idea, and that consequently neither they  nor their archetypes can exist in an UNPERCEIVING substance. Hence, it is  plain that the very notion of what is called MATTER or CORPOREAL  SUBSTANCE, involves a contradiction in it.[Note.]    [Note: \"Insomuch that I should not think it necessary to spend more time  in exposing its absurdity. But because the tenet of the existence of  matter seems to have taken so deep a root in the minds of philosophers,  and draws after it so many ill consequences, I choose rather to be  thought prolix and tedious, than omit anything that might conduce to  the full discovery and extirpation of the prejudice.\"--Edit 1710.]    10. ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM.--They who assert that figure, motion, and the  rest of the primary or original qualities do exist without the mind in  unthinking substances, do at the same time acknowledge that colours,  sounds, heat cold, and suchlike secondary qualities, do not--which they  tell us are sensations existing IN THE MIND ALONE, that depend on and are  occasioned by the different size, texture, and motion of the minute  particles of matter. This they take for an undoubted truth, which they can  demonstrate beyond all exception. Now, if it be certain that those  original qualities ARE INSEPARABLY UNITED WITH THE OTHER SENSIBLE  QUALITIES, and not, even in thought, capable of being abstracted  from them, it plainly follows that they exist only in the mind.  But I desire any one to reflect and try whether he can, by any  abstraction of thought, conceive the extension and motion of a  body without all other sensible qualities. For my own part, I see  evidently that it is not in my power to frame an idea of a body  extended and moving, but I must withal give it some colour or other  sensible quality which is ACKNOWLEDGED to exist only in the mind. In  short, extension, figure, and motion, abstracted from all other  qualities, are inconceivable. Where therefore the other sensible  qualities are, there must these be also, to wit, in the mind and nowhere  else.    11. A SECOND ARGUMENT AD HOMINEM.--Again, GREAT and SMALL, SWIFT and SLOW,  ARE ALLOWED TO EXIST NOWHERE WITHOUT THE MIND, being entirely  RELATIVE, and changing as the frame or position of the organs of  sense varies. The extension therefore which exists without the  mind is neither great nor small, the motion neither swift nor slow,  that is, they are nothing at all. But, say you, they are extension  in general, and motion in general: thus we see how much the tenet  of extended movable substances existing without the mind depends on  the strange doctrine of ABSTRACT IDEAS. And here I cannot but remark how  nearly the vague and indeterminate description of Matter or corporeal  substance, which the modern philosophers are run into by their own  principles, resembles that antiquated and so much ridiculed notion of  MATERIA PRIMA, to be met with in Aristotle and his followers. Without  extension solidity cannot be conceived; since therefore it has been shown  that extension exists not in an unthinking substance, the same must also  be true of solidity.    12. That NUMBER is entirely THE CREATURE OF THE MIND, even though the  other qualities be allowed to exist without, will be evident to whoever  considers that the same thing bears a different denomination of number as  the mind views it with different respects. Thus, the same extension is  one, or three, or thirty-six, according as the mind considers it with  reference to a yard, a foot, or an inch. Number is so visibly relative,  and dependent on men's understanding, that it is strange to think how any  one should give it an absolute existence without the mind. We say one  book, one page, one line, etc.; all these are equally units, though some  contain several of the others. And in each instance, it is plain, the  unit relates to some particular combination of ideas arbitrarily put  together by the mind.    13. UNITY I know some will have to be A SIMPLE OR UNCOMPOUNDED IDEA,  accompanying all other ideas into the mind. That I have any such idea  answering the word UNITY I do not find; and if I had, methinks I could  not miss finding it: on the contrary, it should be the most familiar to  my understanding, since it is said to accompany all other ideas, and to  be perceived by all the ways of sensation and reflexion. To say no more,  it is an ABSTRACT IDEA.    14. A THIRD ARGUMENT AD HOMINEM.--I shall farther add, that, after  the same manner as modern philosophers prove certain sensible  qualities to have no existence in Matter, or without the mind,  the same thing may be likewise proved of all other sensible qualities  whatsoever. Thus, for instance, it is said that heat and cold are  affections only of the mind, and not at all patterns of real beings,  existing in the corporeal substances which excite them, for that  the same body which appears cold to one hand seems warm to another.  Now, why may we not as well argue that figure and extension are not  patterns or resemblances of qualities existing in Matter, because to the  same eye at different stations, or eyes of a different texture at the  same station, they appear various, and cannot therefore be the images of  anything SETTLED AND DETERMINATE WITHOUT THE MIND? Again, it is proved  that SWEETNESS is not really in the sapid thing, because the thing  remaining unaltered the sweetness is changed into bitter, as in case of a  fever or otherwise vitiated palate. Is it not as reasonable to say that  MOTION is not without the mind, since if the succession of ideas in the  mind become swifter, the motion, it is acknowledged, shall appear slower  without any alteration in any external object?    15. NOT CONCLUSIVE AS TO EXTENSION.--In short, let any one consider  those arguments which are thought manifestly to prove that colours  and taste exist only in the mind, and he shall find they may with  equal force be brought to prove the same thing of extension, figure,  and motion. Though it must be confessed this method of arguing  does not so much prove that there is no extension or colour in  an outward object, as that we do not know by SENSE which is the TRUE  extension or colour of the object. But the arguments foregoing plainly  show it to be impossible that any colour or extension at all, or other  sensible quality whatsoever, should exist in an UNTHINKING subject  without the mind, or in truth, that there should be any such thing as an  outward"]]]
