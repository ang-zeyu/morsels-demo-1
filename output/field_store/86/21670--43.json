The allegorical interpretation of the Book of Canticles was in truth  the source of, or at least the model for, a vast amount of  unwholesome and repulsive pietism. Not a word need be said for such  a paltry narrative of endearments and sickly compliments as the  \"Revelations of the Nun Gertrude,\" in the thirteenth century. Nor  are we concerned to deny that the artificially induced ecstasy,  which is desired on account of the intense pleasure which is said to  accompany it, nearly always contains elements the recognition of  which would shock and distress the contemplatives themselves.[29]  There are, however, other elements, of a less insidious kind, which  make the ecstatic trance seem desirable. These are, according to  Professor Leuba, the calming of the restless intellect by the  concentration of the mind on one object; the longing for a support  and comfort more perfect than man can give; and, thirdly, the  consecration and strengthening of the will, which is often a  permanent effect of the trance. These are legitimate objects of  desire, and in many of the mystics they are much more prominent than  any tendencies which might be considered morbid. As regards the  larger question, about the alleged pathological character of all  distinctively religious exaltation, I believe that no greater  mistake could be made than to suppose that the religious life  flourishes best in unnatural circumstances. Religion, from a  biological standpoint, I take to be the expression of the racial  will to live; its function (from this point of view) is the  preservation and development of humanity on the highest possible  level. If this is true, a simple, healthy, natural life must be the  most favourable for religious excellence--and this I believe to be  the case. Poor Suso certainly did not lead a healthy or natural  life. But in his case, though the suppressed natural instincts  obviously overflow into the religious consciousness and in part  determine the forms which his devotion assumes, we can never forget  that we are in the company of a poet and a saint who will lift us,  if we can follow him, into a very high region of the spiritual life,  an altitude which he has himself climbed with bleeding feet.    The simple confidence which at the end of the dialogue he expresses  in the value of his work is, I think, amply justified. \"Whoever will  read these writings of mine in a right spirit, can hardly fail to be  stirred to the depths of his soul, either to fervent love, or to new  light, or to hunger and thirst for God, or to hatred and loathing  for his sins, or to that spiritual aspiration by which the soul is  renewed in grace.\"    Sect. 7. RUYSBROEK    [Note: the Ruysbroek selection has not been reproduced in this  electronic edition. An electronic text of a larger collection of  Ruysbroek's works may be available.]    Sect. 8. THEOLOGIA GERMANICA    The \"Theologia Germanica,\" an isolated treatise of no great length  by an unknown author, was written towards the end of the fourteenth  century by one of the Gottesfreunde, a widespread association of  pious souls in Germany. He is said to have been \"a priest and warden  of the house of the Teutonic Order at Frankfort.\" His book is both  the latest and one of the most important productions of the German  mystical school founded by Eckhart. The author is a deeply religious  philosopher, as much interested in speculative mysticism as Eckhart  himself, but as thoroughly penetrated with devout feeling as Thomas   Kempis. The treatise should be read by all, as one of the very  best devotional works in any language. My only reason for not  translating it in full here is that a good English translation  already exists,[30] so that it seemed unnecessary to offer a new one  to the public. I have therefore only translated a few characteristic  passages, which are very far from exhausting its beauties, and a few  of the more striking aphorisms, which indicate the main points in  the religious philosophy of the writer.    Sect. 9. MODERN MYSTICISM    The revival of interest in the old mystical writers is not  surprising when we consider the whole trend of modern thought. Among  recent philosophers--though Lotze, perhaps the greatest name among  them, is unsympathetic, in consequence of his over-rigid theory of  personality--the great psychologist Fechner, whose religious  philosophy is not so well known in this country as it deserves to  be, has with some justice been called a mystic. And our own greatest  living metaphysician, Mr F.H. Bradley, has expounded the dialectic  of speculative mysticism with unequalled power, though with a bias  against Christianity. Another significant fact is the great  popularity, all over Europe, of Maeterlinck's mystical works, \"Le  Trésor des Humbles,\" \"La Sagesse et la Destinée,\" and \"Le  Temple Enseveli.\"    The growing science of psychology has begun to turn its attention  seriously to the study of the religious faculty. Several able men  have set themselves to collect material which may form the basis of  an inductive science. Personal experiences, communicated by many  persons of both sexes and of various ages, occupations, and levels  of culture, have been brought together and tabulated. It is claimed  that important facts have already been established, particularly in  connexion with the phenomena of conversion, by this method. The  results have certainly been more than enough to justify confidence  in the soundness of the method, and hope that the new science may  have a great future before it. Towards mysticism, recent writers on  the psychology of religion have been less favourable than the pure  metaphysicians. While the latter have shown a tendency towards  Pantheism and Determinism, which makes them sympathise with the  general trend of speculative mysticism, psychology seems just at  present to lean towards a pluralistic metaphysic and a belief in  free-will or even in chance. This attitude is especially noticeable  in the now famous Gifford Lectures of Professor William James[31]  and in the recent volume of essays written at Oxford.[32] But even  if the rising tide of neo-Kantianism should cause the speculative  mystics to be regarded with disfavour, nothing can prevent the  religion of the twentieth century from being mystical in type. The  strongest wish of a vast number of earnest men and women to-day is  for a basis of religious belief which shall rest, not upon tradition  or external authority or historical evidence, but upon the  ascertainable facts of human experience. The craving for immediacy,  which we have seen to be characteristic of all mysticism, now takes  the form of a desire to establish the validity of the  God-consciousness as a normal part of the healthy inner life. We may  perhaps venture to predict that the Christian biologist of the  future will turn the Pauline Christology into his own dialect  somewhat after the following fashion:--\"The function of religion in  the human race is closely analogous to, if not identical with, that  of instinct in the lower animals. Religion is the racial will to  live; not, however, to live anyhow and at all costs, but to live as  human beings, conforming as far as possible to the highest type of  humanity. Religion, therefore, acts as a higher instinct, inhibiting  all self-destroying and race-destroying impulses in the interest of  a larger self than the individual life.\" To turn this statement into  theological form it is only necessary to claim that the \"perfect  man\" which the religious instinct is trying to form is \"the measure  of the stature of the fulness of Christ,\" that that perfect humanity  was once realised in the historical Christ, and that the higher  instinct within us--ourselves, yet not ourselves--which makes for  life and righteousness, and is the source of all the good that we  can think, say, or do, may (in virtue of that historical  incarnation) be justly called the indwelling Christ. This is all  that the Christian mystic needs.    Sect. 10. SPECIMENS OF MODERN MYSTICISM    I conclude this introductory essay with a few extracts from recent  American books on the psychology of religion. It is interesting to  find some of the strangest experiences of the cloister reproduced  under the very different conditions of modern American life. The  quotations will serve to show how far Tauler and the \"Theologia  Germanica\" are from being out of date.    \"The thing which impressed me most\" (says a correspondent of  Professor William James)[33] \"was learning the fact that we must be  in absolutely constant relation or mental touch with that essence of  life which permeates all and which we call God. This is almost  unrecognisable unless we live into it ourselves actually--that is,  by a constant turning to the very innermost, deepest consciousness  of our real selves or of God in us, for illumination from within,  just as we turn to the sun for light, warmth, and invigoration  without. When you do this consciously, realising that to turn inward  to the light within you is to live in the presence of God or of your  Divine self, you soon discover the unreality of the objects to which  you have hitherto been turning and which have engrossed you  without.\"    The next quotation comes from a small book by one of the \"New  Thought\" or \"Mind Cure\" school in America. The enormous sale of the  volume testifies to the popularity of the teaching which it  contains.[34]    \"Intuition is an inner spiritual sense through which man is opened  to the direct revelation and knowledge of God, the secret of nature  and life, and through which he is brought into conscious unity and  fellowship with God, and made to realise his own deific nature and  supremacy of being as the son of God."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4667"],[0,"Seven Wives and Seven Prisons (#6)"],[1,"Sarah this way--head toward Water Gap.  When you're married fast and sure, you can come back here as leisurely  as you're a mind to, and nobody can lay a hand upon you or her.\"    We arranged some other minor details of our expedition and I went to  bed.    The next afternoon at four o'clock I was at the appointed place, and  Boston Yankee was with me. I did not look for Sarah before five o'clock,  so we tied our horse and kept a good watch upon the road. An hour went  by and no Sarah appeared. I told Boston Yankee I did not believe she  would come.    \"Don't be impatient; wait a little longer,\" said my friend.    In twenty minutes we saw emerge, not from Scheimer's house, but from his  eldest son's house, which was still nearer to the place where we were  waiting, three women, two of whom I recognized as Sarah and Mary, and  the third I did not know, nor could I imagine why she was with the other  two; but as I saw them, leaving Boston Yankee in the woods, I drove the  horse down into the road. As Sarah drew near she kissed her hand to me  and came up to the wagon. \"Are you ready to go with me?\" I asked. \"I  am, indeed,\" was her reply, and I put out my hand to help her into the  buggy. But the third woman caught hold of her dress, tried to prevent  her from getting in, and began to scream so as to attract attention at  Sarah's brother's house. I told the woman to let her go, and threatened  her with my whip. \"Get away,\" shouted Boston Yankee, who had come upon  the scene. \"Drive as fast as you can; never mind if you kill the horse.\"    We started; the woman still shouting for help, and I drove on as rapidly  as the horse would go. When we had gone on a mile or two, I asked  Sarah what all this meant? She told me that the woman was her brother's  servant; that Mary and herself left her father's house a little after  four o'clock to go over and call at her brother's; that just before  five, when she was to meet me, she and Mary proposed to go out for a  walk; that the whole family watched her constantly, and so her brother's  wife told the servant woman to get on her things and go with them.  \"You, may be sure,\" she, added, \"that the woman will arouse the whole  neighborhood, and that they will all be after us.\" I needed no further  hint to push on. We were going toward Water Gap, as Boston Yankee had  advised, and when we were about eight miles on the way, I deemed it  prudent to drive into the woods and to wait till night before going on.  We drove in just off the road, and tied our horse. We were effectually  concealed; our pursuers, if there were any, would be sure to go by us,  and meantime we could talk over our plans for the future. Sarah told me  that when Mary came to the house the night before, she was not at all  surprised to see her, as she occasionally came up from Easton to  make them a little visit, and to stay all night; that she went to the  summer-house with Mary to sit down and talk, and almost immediately saw  the ring on Mary's finger; that when she saw it she at once recognized  it, and asked her: \"O! Mary, where did you get that ring?\" \"Keep  quiet,\" said Mary: \"don't talk loud, or some one may hear you; don't  be agitated; your lover is near, and has sent me to tell you.\" It was  joyful news to Sarah, and how readily she had acquiesced in my plan for  an elopement was manifest in the fact that she was then by my side.    We bad not been in the woods an hour when, as I anticipated, we heard  our pursuers, we did not know how many there were, drive rapidly by.  \"Now we can go on, I suppose,\" said Sarah. \"Oh no, my dear,\" I replied,  \"now is just the time to wait quietly here;\" and wait we did till eight  o'clock, when our pursuers, having gone on a few miles, and having seen  or learned nothing of the fugitives, came by again \"on the back track.\"  They must have thought we had turned off into some other road. I waited  a while longer to let our friend's get a little nearer home and further  away from us, and then took the road again toward Water Gap.    We reached Water Gap at midnight, had some supper and fed the horse. We  rested awhile, and then drove leisurely on nine miles further, where we  waited till daylight and crossed the river. We were in no great hurry  now; we were comparatively safe from pursuit. We soon came to a public  house, where we stopped and put out the horse, intending to take  breakfast. While I was inquiring of the landlord if there was a justice  of the peace in the neighborhood, the landlord's wife had elicited from  Sarah the fact of our elopement, who she was, who her folks were, and so  on. The well-meaning landlady advised Sarah to go back home and get  her parents consent before she married. Sarah suggested that the very  impossibility of getting such consent was the reason for her running  away; nor did it appear how she was to go back home alone even if she  desired to. We saw that we could get no help there, so I countermanded  my order for breakfast, offering at the same time to pay for it as if we  had eaten it, ordered out my horse and drove on. After riding some  ten miles we arrived at another public house on the road, and as the  landlord come out to the door I immediately asked him where I could  find a justice of the peace? He laughed, for he at once comprehended the  whole situation, and said:    \"Well, well! I am an old offender myself; I ran away with my wife; there  is a justice of the peace two miles from here, and if you'll come in  I'll have him here within an hour.\"    We had reached the right place at last, for while the landlady was  getting breakfast for us, and doing her best to make us comfortable and  happy, the Old Offender himself took his horse and carriage and went for  the justice. By the time we had finished our breakfast he was back  with him, and Sarah and I were married in \"less than no time,\" the Old  Offender and his wife singing the certificate as witnesses. I never  paid a fee more gladly. We were married now, and all the Scheimers in  Pennsylvania were welcome to come and see us if they pleased.    No Scheimers came that day; but the day following came a deputation from  that family, some half dozen delegates, and with them a constable from  Easton, with a warrant to arrest Sarah for something--I never knew  what--but at any rate he was to take her home if necessary by force. The  Old Offender declined to let these people into his house; Sarah told me  to keep out of the way and she would see what was wanted. Whereupon she  boldly went to the door and greeted those of her acquaintances who were  in the party. The constable knew her, and told her he had come to take  her home. \"But what if I refuse to go?\" \"Well then, I have a warrant  to take you; but if you are married, I have no power over you.\" Well  married I am, said Sarah, and she produced the certificate, and the  Old Offender and his wife came out and declared that they witnessed the  ceremony.    What was to be done? evidently nothing; only the constable ordered a  whole barrel of ale to treat his posse and any one about tire town who  chose to drink, and the barrel was rolled out on the grass, tapped, and  for a half hour there was a great jollification, which was not exactly  in honor of our wedding, but which afforded the greatest gratification  to the constable, his retainers, and those who happened to gather to see  what was going on. This ended, and the bill paid, the Easton delegation  got into their wagons and turned their horses heads towards home.    We passed three delightful days under the Old Offender's roof, and  then thanking our host for his kindness to us, and paying our bill, we  started on our return journey for Oxford. We arrived safely, and staid  with Boston Yankee a fortnight. We were close by the Scheimer homestead,  which was but a few miles away across the river; but we feared neither  father nor brothers, nor even the woman who was so unwilling to let  Sarah go with me. The constable, and the rest had carried home the news  of our marriage, and the old folks made the best of it. Indeed, after  they heard we had returned to Oxford, Sarah's mother sent a man over to  tell her that if she would come home any day she could pack her clothes  and other things, and take them away with her. The day after we received  this invitation, Boston Yankee offered to take Sarah over home, and  promised to bring her safely back. So she went, was treated tolerably  well, at any rate, she secured her clothes and brought them home with  her.    It was now time to bid farewell to our staunch friend, Boston Yankee. I  had inducements to go to Goshen, Orange County, N. Y., where I had many  acquaintances, and to Goshen we went. We found a good boarding place,  and I began to practice medicine, After we had been there a while, Sarah  wrote home to let her family know where she was, and that she was well  and happy. Her father wrote in reply that we both might come there at  any time, and that if she would come home he would do as well by her as  he would by any of his children. This letter made Sarah uneasy. In spite  of all the ill usage she had received from her parents and family, she  was nevertheless homesick, and longed to get back again. I could see  that this feeling grew upon her daily. We were pleasantly situated  where we were; I had a good and growing practice, and we had made many  friends; but this did not satisfy her; she had some property in her own  right, but her father was trustee of it, and he had hitherto kept it  away from her from spite at her love affair with me. But now she was to  be taken into favor again, and she represented to me that we could go  back and get her money, and that I could establish myself there as well  as anywhere; we could live well and happily among her friends and old  associations. These things were dinged in my ears day after day, till I  was sick of the very sound. I could see that she was bound, or, "]]]
