Turning the shoulder of the hill,  Sanders had a full view of the scene.    Between the edge of the forest and slope of the hill was a broad strip  of level land. On the left was the river, on the right was swamp and  forest again.    In the very centre of the plain a huge fire burnt. Before it, supported  by its poles, on two high trestles, a square box.    But the people!    A huge circle, squatting on its haunches, motionless, silent; men,  women, children, tiny babies, at their mothers' hips they stretched; a  solid wheel of humanity, with the box and the fire as a hub.    There was a lane through which a man might reach the box--a lane along  which passed a procession of naked men, going and returning. These were  they who replenished the fire, and Sanders saw them dragging fuel for  that purpose. Keeping to the edge of the crowd, he worked his way to the  opening. Then he looked round at his men.    \"It is written,\" he said, in the curious Arabic of the Kano people,  \"that we shall carry away this false god. As to which of us shall live  or die through this adventure, that is with Allah, who knows all  things.\"    Then he stepped boldly along the lane. He had changed his white ducks  for a dark blue uniform suit, and he was not observed by the majority  until he came with his Houssas to the box. The heat from the fire was  terrific, overpowering. Close at hand he saw that the fierceness of the  blaze had warped the rough-hewn boards of the box, and through the  opening he saw in the light a slab of stone.    \"Take up the box quickly,\" he commanded, and the Houssas lifted the  poles to their shoulders. Until then the great assembly had sat in  silent wonder, but as the soldiers lifted their burden, a yell of rage  burst from five thousand throats, and men leapt to their feet.    Sanders stood before the fire, one hand raised, and silence fell,  curiosity dominating resentment.    \"People of the Isisi,\" said Sanders, \"let no man move until the  god-stone has passed, for death comes quickly to those who cross the  path of gods.\"    He had an automatic pistol in each hand, and the particular deity he was  thinking of at the moment was not the one in the box.    The people hesitated, surging and swaying, as a mob will sway in its  uncertainty.    With quick steps the bearers carried their burden through the lane; they  had almost passed unmolested when an old woman shuffled forward and  clutched at Sanders' arm.    \"Lord, lord!\" she quavered, \"what will you do with our god?\"    \"Take him to the proper place,\" said Sanders, \"being by Government  appointed his keeper.\"    \"Give me a sign,\" she croaked, and the people in her vicinity repeated,  \"A sign, master!\"    \"This is a sign,\" said Sanders, remembering the woman in labour. \"By the  god's favour there shall be born to Ifabi, wife of Adako, a male child.\"    He heard the babble of talk; he heard his message repeated over the  heads of the crowd; he saw a party of women go scurrying back to the  village; then he gave the order to march. There were murmurings, and  once he heard a deep-voiced man begin the war-chant, but nobody joined  him. Somebody--probably the same man--clashed his spear against his  wicker shield, but his warlike example was not followed. Sanders gained  the village street. Around him was such a press of people that he  followed the swaying box with difficulty. The river was in sight; the  moon, rising a dull, golden ball over the trees, laced the water with  silver, and then there came a scream of rage.    \"He lies! He lies! Ifabi, the wife of Adako, has a female child.\"    Sanders turned swiftly like a dog at bay; his lips upcurled in a snarl,  his white, regular teeth showing.    \"Now,\" said Sanders, speaking very quickly, \"let any man raise his  spear, and he dies.\"    Again they stood irresolute, and Sanders, over his shoulder, gave an  order.    For a moment only the people hesitated; then, as the soldiers gripped  the poles of the god-box, with one fierce yell they sprang forward.    A voice screamed something; and, as if by magic, the tumult ceased, and  the crowd darted backward and outward, falling over one another in their  frantic desire to escape.    Sanders, his pistol still loaded, stood in open-mouthed astonishment at  the stampede.    Save for his men he was alone; and then he saw.    Along the centre of the street two men were walking. They were clad  alike in short crimson kilts that left their knees bare; great brass  helmets topped their heads, and brass cuirasses covered their breasts.    Sanders watched them as they came nearer, then: \"If this is not fever,  it is madness,\" he muttered, for what he saw were two Roman centurions,  their heavy swords girt about their waists.    He stood still, and they passed him, so close that he saw on the boss of  one shield the rough-moulded letters:--      \"AUGUSTUS CAE.\"    \"Fever\" said Sanders emphatically, and followed the box to the ship.           *     *     *     *     *    When the steamer reached Lukati, Sanders was still in a condition of  doubt, for his temperature was normal, and neither fever nor sun could  be held accountable for the vision. Added to which, his men had seen the  same thing.    He found the reinforcements his pigeon had brought, but they were  unnecessary now.    \"It beats me,\" he confessed to Carter, telling the story; \"but we'll get  out the stone; it might furnish an explanation. Centurions--bah!\"    The stone, exposed in the light of day, was of greyish granite, such as  Sanders did not remember having seen before.    \"Here are the 'devil marks,'\" he said, as he turned it over.  \"Possibly--whew!\"    No wonder he whistled, for closely set were a number of printed  characters; and Carter, blowing the dust, saw--      \"MARIUS ET AUGUSTUS    CENT . . . . . . . . . NERO    IMPERAT . . . . . IN DEUS    . . . . . DULCE.\"    That night, with great labour, Sanders, furbishing his rusty Latin, and  filling in gaps, made a translation:      \"Marius and Augustus,    Centurions of Nero, Csar and    Emperor,    Sleep sweetly with the gods.\"        \"We are they who came beyond the wild lands which Hanno, the      Carthaginian, found . . .        \"Marcus Septimus went up into Egypt, and with him Decimus      Superbus, but by the will of Csar, and the favour of the gods,      we sailed to the black seas beyond. . . . . Here we lived, our      ships suffering wreck, being worshipped by the barbarians,      teaching them warlike practices.        . . . \"You who come after . . . bear greetings to Rome to Cato      Hippocritus, who dwells by the gate . . .\"    Sanders shook his head when he had finished reading, and said it was  \"rum.\"    [Footnote 1: There is a tremendous amount of free hydrocyanic acid  (prussic acid) in manioc.]            CHAPTER III.      BOSAMBO OF MONROVIA.      For many years have the Ochori people formed a sort of grim comic relief  to the tragedy of African colonisation. Now it may well be that we shall  laugh at the Ochori no more. Nor, in the small hours of the night, when  conversation flags in the little circle about the fires in fishing  camps, shall the sleepy-eyed be roused to merriment by stories of Ochori  meekness. All this has come about by favour of the Liberian Government,  though at present the Liberian Government is not aware of the fact.    With all due respect to the Republic of Liberia, I say that the  Monrovians are naturally liars and thieves.    Once upon a time, that dignity might be added to the State, a warship  was acquired--if I remember aright it was presented by a disinterested  shipowner. The Government appointed three admirals, fourteen captains,  and as many officers as the ship would hold, and they all wore gorgeous  but ill-fitting uniforms. The Government would have appointed a crew  also, but for the fact that the ship was not big enough to hold any  larger number of people than its officers totalled.    This tiny man-of-war of the black republic went to sea once, the  admirals and captains taking it in turn to stoke and steer--a very  pleasing and novel sensation, this latter.    Coming back into the harbour, one of the admirals said--    \"It is my turn to steer now,\" and took the wheel.    The ship struck a rock at the entrance of the harbour and went down. The  officers escaped easily enough, for your Monrovian swims like a fish,  but their uniforms were spoilt by the sea water. To the suggestion that  salvage operations should be attempted to refloat the warship, the  Government very wisely said no, they thought not.    \"We know where she is,\" said the President--he was sitting on the edge  of his desk at Government House, eating sardines with his fingers--\"and  if we ever want her, it will be comforting to know she is so close to  us.\"    Nothing more would have been done in the matter but for the fact that  the British Admiralty decided that the wreck was a danger to shipping,  and issued orders forthwith for the place where it lay to be buoyed.    The Liberian Government demurred on account of expense, but on pressure  being applied (I suspect the captain of H.M.S. _Dwarf_, who was a man  with a bitter tongue) they agreed, and the bell-buoy was anchored to the  submerged steamer.    It made a nice rowdy, clanging noise, did that bell, and the people of  Monrovia felt they were getting their money's worth.    But all Monrovia is not made up of the freed American slaves who were  settled there in 1821. There are people who are described in a lordly  fashion by the true Monrovians as \"indigenous natives,\" and the chief  of these are the Kroomen, who pay no taxes, defy the Government, and at  intervals tweak the official nose of the Republic.    The second day after the bell was in place, Monrovia awoke to find a  complete silence reigning in the bay, and that in spite of a heavy  swell. The bell was still, and two ex-admirals, who were selling fish on  the"]]]
