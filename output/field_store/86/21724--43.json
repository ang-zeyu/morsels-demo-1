When he  reached its southern boundary he flung himself down in a grassy corner  of the fence where another lilac bush grew, with ferns and wild blue  violets at its roots. From where he now was he got a glimpse of a house  about a quarter of a mile away, its gray gable peering out from a dark  spruce wood. It seemed a dull, gloomy, remote place, and he did not know  who lived there.    He had a wide outlook to the west, over far hazy fields and misty blue  intervales. The sun had just set, and the whole world of green meadows  beyond swam in golden light. Across a long valley brimmed with shadow  were uplands of sunset, and great sky lakes of saffron and rose where  a soul might lose itself in colour. The air was very fragrant with the  baptism of the dew, and the odours of a bed of wild mint upon which he  had trampled. Robins were whistling, clear and sweet and sudden, in the  woods all about him.    \"This is a veritable 'haunt of ancient peace,'\" quoted Eric, looking  around with delighted eyes. \"I could fall asleep here, dream dreams  and see visions. What a sky! Could anything be diviner than that fine  crystal eastern blue, and those frail white clouds that look like woven  lace? What a dizzying, intoxicating fragrance lilacs have! I wonder  if perfume could set a man drunk. Those apple trees now--why, what is  that?\"    Eric started up and listened. Across the mellow stillness, mingled  with the croon of the wind in the trees and the flute-like calls of the  robins, came a strain of delicious music, so beautiful and fantastic  that Eric held his breath in astonishment and delight. Was he dreaming?  No, it was real music, the music of a violin played by some hand  inspired with the very spirit of harmony. He had never heard anything  like it; and, somehow, he felt quite sure that nothing exactly like it  ever had been heard before; he believed that that wonderful music was  coming straight from the soul of the unseen violinist, and translating  itself into those most airy and delicate and exquisite sounds for the  first time; the very soul of music, with all sense and earthliness  refined away.    It was an elusive, haunting melody, strangely suited to the time  and place; it had in it the sigh of the wind in the woods, the eerie  whispering of the grasses at dewfall, the white thoughts of the June  lilies, the rejoicing of the apple blossoms; all the soul of all the old  laughter and song and tears and gladness and sobs the orchard had  ever known in the lost years; and besides all this, there was in it a  pitiful, plaintive cry as of some imprisoned thing calling for freedom  and utterance.    At first Eric listened as a man spellbound, mutely and motionlessly,  lost in wonderment. Then a very natural curiosity overcame him. Who in  Lindsay could play a violin like that? And who was playing so here, in  this deserted old orchard, of all places in the world?    He rose and walked up the long white avenue, going as slowly and  silently as possible, for he did not wish to interrupt the player.  When he reached the open space of the garden he stopped short in new  amazement and was again tempted into thinking he must certainly be  dreaming.    Under the big branching white lilac tree was an old, sagging, wooden  bench; and on this bench a girl was sitting, playing on an old brown  violin. Her eyes were on the faraway horizon and she did not see Eric.  For a few moments he stood there and looked at her. The pictures she  made photographed itself on his vision to the finest detail, never to  be blotted from his book of remembrance. To his latest day Eric Marshall  will be able to recall vividly that scene as he saw it then--the velvet  darkness of the spruce woods, the overarching sky of soft brilliance,  the swaying lilac blossoms, and amid it all the girl on the old bench  with the violin under her chin.    He had, in his twenty-four years of life, met hundreds of pretty women,  scores of handsome women, a scant half dozen of really beautiful women.  But he knew at once, beyond all possibility of question or doubt, that  he had never seen or imagined anything so exquisite as this girl of the  orchard. Her loveliness was so perfect that his breath almost went from  him in his first delight of it.    Her face was oval, marked in every cameo-like line and feature with  that expression of absolute, flawless purity, found in the angels and  Madonnas of old paintings, a purity that held in it no faintest strain  of earthliness. Her head was bare, and her thick, jet-black hair was  parted above her forehead and hung in two heavy lustrous braids over her  shoulders. Her eyes were of such a blue as Eric had never seen in eyes  before, the tint of the sea in the still, calm light that follows after  a fine sunset; they were as luminous as the stars that came out over  Lindsay Harbour in the afterglow, and were fringed about with very long,  soot-black lashes, and arched over by most delicately pencilled dark  eyebrows. Her skin was as fine and purely tinted as the heart of a white  rose. The collarless dress of pale blue print she wore revealed her  smooth, slender throat; her sleeves were rolled up above her elbows  and the hand which guided the bow of her violin was perhaps the most  beautiful thing about her, perfect in shape and texture, firm and  white, with rosy-nailed taper fingers. One long, drooping plume of lilac  blossom lightly touched her hair and cast a wavering shadow over the  flower-like face beneath it.    There was something very child-like about her, and yet at least eighteen  sweet years must have gone to the making of her. She seemed to be  playing half unconsciously, as if her thoughts were far away in some  fair dreamland of the skies. But presently she looked away from \"the  bourne of sunset,\" and her lovely eyes fell on Eric, standing motionless  before her in the shadow of the apple tree.    The sudden change that swept over her was startling. She sprang to her  feet, the music breaking in mid-strain and the bow slipping from her  hand to the grass. Every hint of colour fled from her face and she  trembled like one of the wind-stirred June lilies.    \"I beg your pardon,\" said Eric hastily. \"I am sorry that I have alarmed  you. But your music was so beautiful that I did not remember you were  not aware of my presence here. Please forgive me.\"    He stopped in dismay, for he suddenly realized that the expression on  the girl's face was one of terror--not merely the startled alarm of  a shy, childlike creature who had thought herself alone, but absolute  terror. It was betrayed in her blanched and quivering lips and in the  widely distended blue eyes that stared back into his with the expression  of some trapped wild thing.    It hurt him that any woman should look at him in such a fashion, at him  who had always held womanhood in such reverence.    \"Don't look so frightened,\" he said gently, thinking only of calming her  fear, and speaking as he would to a child. \"I will not hurt you. You are  safe, quite safe.\"    In his eagerness to reassure her he took an unconscious step forward.  Instantly she turned, and, without a sound, fled across the orchard,  through a gap in the northern fence and along what seemed to be a lane  bordering the fir wood beyond and arched over with wild cherry trees  misty white in the gathering gloom. Before Eric could recover his wits  she had vanished from his sight among the firs.    He stooped and picked up the violin bow, feeling slightly foolish and  very much annoyed.    \"Well, this is a most mysterious thing,\" he said, somewhat impatiently.  \"Am I bewitched? Who was she? WHAT was she? Can it be possible that she  is a Lindsay girl? And why in the name of all that's provoking should  she be so frightened at the mere sight of me? I have never thought I  was a particularly hideous person, but certainly this adventure has not  increased my vanity to any perceptible extent. Perhaps I have wandered  into an enchanted orchard, and been outwardly transformed into an ogre.  Now that I have come to think of it, there is something quite uncanny  about the place. Anything might happen here. It is no common orchard for  the production of marketable apples, that is plain to be seen. No, it's  a most unwholesome locality; and the sooner I make my escape from it the  better.\"    He glanced about it with a whimsical smile. The light was fading rapidly  and the orchard was full of soft, creeping shadows and silences. It  seemed to wink sleepy eyes of impish enjoyment at his perplexity. He  laid the violin bow down on the old bench.    \"Well, there is no use in my following her, and I have no right to do  so even if it were of use. But I certainly wish she hadn't fled in such  evident terror. Eyes like hers were never meant to express anything  but tenderness and trust. Why--why--WHY was she so frightened? And  who--who--WHO--can she be?\"    All the way home, over fields and pastures that were beginning to be  moonlight silvered he pondered the mystery.    \"Let me see,\" he reflected. \"Mr. Williamson was describing the Lindsay  girls for my benefit the other evening. If I remember rightly he said  that there were four handsome ones in the district. What were their  names? Florrie Woods, Melissa Foster--no, Melissa Palmer--Emma Scott,  and Jennie May Ferguson. Can she be one of them? No, it is a flagrant  waste of time and gray matter supposing it. That girl couldn't be a  Florrie or a Melissa or an Emma, while Jennie May is completely out of  the question. Well, there is some bewitchment in the affair. Of that I'm  convinced. So I'd better forget all about it.\"    But Eric found that it was impossible to forget all about it. The more  he tried to forget, the more keenly and insistently he remembered. The  girl's exquisite face haunted him and the mystery of her tantalized him.
