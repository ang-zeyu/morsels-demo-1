It is said that there  are only three months of the year when Granada is fit to live in, and  certainly February and March are not of these. But our delighted  spirits had no thought of surrender to our discomfited bodies. We  would not go away. It is better to ache in beautiful Granada than to  be at ease elsewhere.    At the first peep of convalescence, we fled out of doors in search of  a sunbeam and discovered, again to our surprise, this immemorial  Alhambra hill as young as springtime. The famous fragments of towers,  with their dim legends of enchantment, all those tumbled masses of  time-worn, saffron-lichened masonry, are tragically old, yet the  tender petals of peach blossoms, drifting through the fragrant air,  lay pink as baby touches against those hoary piles. We rested beside  many an ancient ruin overclambered by red rosebuds or by branches  laden with the fresh gold of oranges, where thrushes practised songs  of welcome for the nightingales. We were too early for these sweetest  minstrels of the Alhambra, who, like the Moors of long ago, were  yearning on the edge of Africa for the Vega of Granada.    One expects, shut in by the crumbling walls of the Alhambra, in shadow  of the ruddy towers, in sound of the Moslem fountains, to live with  dreams and visions for one's company, to have no associates less  dignified than the moonlight cavalcades of shadowy Arabian warriors,  whom the mountain caverns cast forth at stated seasons to troop once  more in their remembered ways, or lustrous-eyed, lute-playing  sultanas, or, at least, a crook-backed, snow-bearded magician, with a  wallet full of talismans, and footsteps that clink like the gold of  buried treasure. But here again the eternal fact of youth in the world  disconcerts all venerable calculations. The Alhambra dances and laughs  with children--ragamuffins, most of them, but none the less radiant  with the precious joy of the morning.    They are gentle little people, too. It became well known on the hill  that we were Americans, yet not a pebble or rude word followed us from  the groups of unkempt boys among whom we daily passed. Once a mimic  regiment, with a deafening variety of unmusical instruments and a  genuine Spanish flag, charged on me roguishly and drew up in battle  square about their prisoner, but it was only to troll the staple song  of Spanish adolescence: \"I want to be a soldier,\" and when I had  munificently rewarded the captain with a copper, the youngsters doffed  their varied headgear, dipped their banner in martial salute, and  contentedly re-formed their ranks. It was seldom that we gave money,  but we usually carried _dulces_ for the little ones, who, even the  dirtiest, have their own pretty standard of manners.    Some half-dozen _pequenitos_, not one of whom was clearly out of  petticoats, were scampering off one day, for instance, their thanks  duly spoken, and their bits of candy just between hand and mouth, when  they turned with one accord, as if suddenly aware of an abruptness in  their leave-taking, and trotted back to bow them low, their tatters of  cap sweeping the ground, and lisp with all Spanish gravity, \"Good  afternoon, senora.\" One chubby hidalgo tipped over with the  profundity of his obeisance, but the others righted him so solemnly  that the dignity of the ceremonial was unimpaired.    The habit of begging, that plague of tourist resorts, is an incessant  nuisance on the Alhambra hill. Half-grown girls and young women were  the most shameless and persistent of our tormentors. Age can be  discouraged, and babyhood diverted, while the Spanish boy, if his  importunities are met by smile and jest, will break into a laugh in  the midst of his most pathetic appeals and let you off till next time.    \"A little money for our Blessed Lady's sake, senora. I am starving.\"    \"Wouldn't you rather have a cigarette?\"    \"And that I would.\"    \"Then you are not starving, little brother. Run away. I have no  cigarettes.\"    \"But you have money for me, senora.\"    \"No, nor enough for myself, not enough to buy one tile of the  Alhambra.\"    \"Then may God take care of you!\"    \"And of you!\"      [Illustration: PLAYING AT BULL-FIGHT]    But the wild-haired, jet-eyed gypsy girl from the Albaicin is  impervious to mirth and untouched by courtesy. She would not do us the  honor of believing our word, even when we were telling the truth.    \"Five _centimos_ to buy me a scarlet ribbon! Five _centimos_!\"    \"Not to-day, excuse me. I have no change.\"    \"Hoh! You have change enough. Look in your little brown bag and see.\"    \"I have no change.\"    \"Then give me a _peseta_. Come, now, a whole _peseta_!\"    \"But why should I give you a _peseta_?\"    The girl stares like an angry hawk.    \"But why shouldn't you?\" Darting away, she hustles together a group of  toddlers, hardly able to lisp, and drives them on to the attack.    \"Beg, Isabelita! Beg of the lady, little Conception! Beg, Alfonsito!  Beg, beg, beg! Beg five _centimos_, ten _centimos_! Beg a _peseta_ for  us all!\"    And out pop the tiny palms, and the babble of baby voices makes a  pleading music in the air. It is for such as these that the little  brown bag has learned to carry _dulces_.    Before the month was over we had, in a slow, grippe-chastened fashion,  \"done our Baedeker.\" We had our favorite courts and corridors in the  magical maze of the Moorish palace; we knew the gardens and fountains  of the _Generalife_, even to that many-centuried cypress beneath whose  shade the Sultana Zoraya was wont to meet her Abencerrage lover; our  fortunes had been told in the gypsy caves of the Albaicin; we had  visited the stately Renaissance cathedral where, in a dim vault, the  \"Catholic Kings,\" Ferdinand and Isabella, take their royal rest; we  had made a first acquaintance with the paintings of the fire-tempered  Granadine, Alonso Cano, and paid our dubious respects to the convent  of Cartuja, with its over-gorgeous ornament and its horrible pictures  of Spanish martyrdoms inflicted by that \"devil's bride,\" Elizabeth of  England. We had explored the parks and streets of the strange old  city, where we possessed, according to the terms of Spanish  hospitality, several houses; but better than the clamorous town we  liked our own wall-girdled height, with its songful wood of English  elms, planted by the Duke of Wellington, its ever murmuring runlets  of clear water, its jessamines and myrtles, its Arabian Nights of  mosque and tower, and its far outlook over what is perhaps the most  entrancing prospect any hill of earth can show. The sunset often found  us leaning over the ivied wall beneath the _Torre de la Vela_, that  bell-tower where the first cross was raised after the Christian  conquest, gazing forth from our trellised garden-nook on a vast  panorama of gray city all quaintly set with arch and cupola, of  sweeping plain with wealth of olive groves, vineyards, orange  orchards, pomegranates, aloes, and cypresses, bounded by glistening  ranks of snow-cloaked mountains. From the other side of the Alhambra  plateau, the fall is sheer to the silver line of the Darro. Across the  river rises the slope of the Albaicin, once the chosen residence of  Moorish aristocracy, but now dotted over, amid the thickets of cactus  and prickly pear, with whitewashed entrances to gypsy caves. Beyond  all shine the resplendent summits of the great Sierras.    Yet it is strange how homely are many of the memories that spring to  life in me at the name of the Alhambra,--decorous donkeys, laden with  water-jars, trooping up the narrow footpath to the old Fountain of  Tears, herds of goats clinging like flies to the upright precipice, a  lurking peasant darting out on his wife as she passes with a day's  earnings hidden in her stocking and holding her close, with laughter  and coaxing, while he persistently searches her clothing until he  finds and appropriates that copper hoard, and our own cheery little  house-drudge washing our linen in a wayside rivulet and singing like a  bird as she rubs and pounds an unfortunate handkerchief between two  haphazard stones:--         \"I like to live in Granada,         It pleases me so well       When I am falling asleep at night         To hear the _Vela_ bell.\"    There is the proud young mother, too, whom we came upon by chance over  behind the Tower of the Princesses, where her pot of _puchero_ was  bubbling above a miniature bonfire, while the velvet-eyed baby boy  sucked his thumb in joyous expectation. She often made us welcome,  after that, to her home,--a dingy stone kitchen and bedroom,  unfurnished save for pallet, a few cooking-utensils, a chest or two,  and, fastened to the wall, a gaudy print of _La Virgen de las  Angustias_, the venerated _Patrona_ of Granada. But this wretched  abode, the remains of what may once have been a palace, opened on a  lordly pleasure-garden with walls inlaid with patterns of rainbow  tiles, whose broken edges were hidden by rose bushes. There were  pedestals and even fragments of images in this wild Eden, jets of  sparkling water and walks of variegated marble. In the course of the  month, English and Spanish callers climbed the hill to us and  encompassed us with kindness, but we still maintained our incorrigible  taste for low society and used to hold informal receptions on sunny  benches for all the tatterdemalions within sight. Swarthy boys,  wearied with much loafing, would thriftily lay aside their cigarettes  to favor us with conversation, asking many questions about America,  for whose recent action they gallantly declined to hold us  responsible. \"It was not the ladies that made the war,\" said these  modern cavaliers of the Alhambra.    Their especial spokesman was a shambling orphan lad of some fifteen  summers, with shrewd and merry eyes. Nothing pleased him better than  to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38777"],[0,"Lad: A Dog (#6)"],[1,"ing. That was enough. And the  yearning to show, in noise, his own wild relief, was all but  irresistible. Then the Master said:    \"Run on, Lad. You can come back by-and-by.\"    And the dog gravely made his way out of the room and out of the house.    The minute he was out-of-doors, he proceeded to go crazy. Nothing but  sheer mania could excuse his actions during the rest of that day. They  were unworthy of a mongrel puppy. And never before in all his  blameless, stately life had Lad so grossly misbehaved as he now  proceeded to do. The Mistress was alive. The Horror was past. Reaction  set in with a rush. As I have said, Lad went crazy.    Peter Grimm, the Mistress's cynical and temperamental gray cat, was  picking its dainty way across the lawn as Lad emerged from the house.    Ordinarily, Lad regarded Peter Grimm with a cold tolerance. But now,  he dashed at the cat with a semblance of stark wrath. Like a furry  whirlwind he bore down upon the amazed feline. The cat, in dire  offense, scratched his nose with a quite unnecessary virulence and  fled up a tree, spitting and yowling, tail fluffed out as thick as a  man's wrist.    Seeing that Peter Grimm had resorted to unsportsmanly tactics by  scrambling whither he could not follow, Lad remembered the need for  silence and forbore to bark threats at his escaped victim. Instead,  he galloped to the rear of the house where stood the dairy.    The dairy door was on the latch. With his head Lad butted it open and  ran into the stone-floored room. A line of full milk-pans were ranged  side by side on a shelf. Rising on his hind-legs and bracing his  forepaws on the shelf, Lad seized edges of the deep pans, one after  another, between his teeth, and, with a succession of sharp jerks  brought them one and all clattering to the floor.    Scampering out of the dairy, ankle deep in a river of spilt milk, and  paying no heed to the cries of the scandalized cook, he charged forth  in the open again. His eye fell on a red cow, tethered by a long chain  in a pasture-patch beyond the stables.    She was an old acquaintance of his, this cow. She had been on The  Place since before he was born. Yet, to-day Lad's spear knew no  brother. He tore across the lawn and past the stables, straight at  the astonished bovine. In terror, the cow threw up her tail and sought  to lumber away at top speed. Being controlled by her tether she could  run only in a wide circle. And around and around this circle Lad drove  the bellowing brute as fast as he could make her run, until the  gardener came panting to her relief.    But neither the gardener nor any other living creature could stay  Lad's rampage that day. He fled merrily up to the Lodge at the gate,  burst into its kitchen and through to the refrigerator. There, in a  pan, he found a raw leg of mutton. Seizing this twelve-pound morsel in  his teeth and dodging the indignant housewife, he careered out into  the highway with his prize, dug a hole in the roadside ditch and was  gleefully preparing to bury the mutton therein, when its outraged  owner rescued it.    A farmer was jogging along the road behind a half-dozing horse. A  painful nip on the rear hind-leg turned the nag's drowsy jog into a  really industrious effort at a runaway. Already, Lad had sprung clear  of the front wheel. As the wagon bumped past him, he leaped upward;  deftly caught a hanging corner of the lap-robe and hauled it free of  the seat.    Robe in mouth, he capered off into a field; playfully keeping just out  of the reach of the pursuing agrarian; and at last he deposited the  stolen treasure in the heart of a bramble-patch a full half-mile from  the road.    Lad made his way back to The Place by a wide detour that brought him  through the grounds of a neighbor of the Master's.    This neighbor owned a dog--a mean-eyed, rangy and mangy pest of a  brute that Lad would ordinarily have scorned to notice. But, most  decidedly, he noticed the dog now. He routed it out of its kennel and  bestowed upon it a thrashing that brought its possessor's entire  family shrieking to the scene of conflict.    Courteously refusing to carry the matter further, in face of a  half-dozen shouting humans, Lad cantered homeward.    From the clothes-line, on the drying-ground at The Place, fluttered a  large white object. It was palpably a nurse's uniform--palpably _the_  nurse's uniform. And Lad greeted its presence there with a grin of  pure bliss.    In less than two seconds the uniform was off the line, with three huge  rents marring its stiff surface. In less than thirty seconds, it was  reposing in the rich black mud on the verge of the lake, and Lad was  rolling playfully on it.    Then he chanced to remember his long-neglected enemies, the squirrels,  and his equally-neglected prey, the rabbits. And he loped off to the  forest to wage gay warfare upon them. He was gloriously, idiotically,  criminally happy. And, for the time, he was a fool.    All day long, complaints came pouring in to the Master. Lad had  destroyed the whole \"set\" of cream. Lad had chased the red cow till it  would be a miracle if she didn't fall sick of it. Lad had scared poor  dear little Peter Grimm so badly that the cat seemed likely to spend  all the rest of its nine lives squalling in the tree-top and crossly  refusing to come down.    Lad had spoiled a Sunday leg of mutton, up at the Lodge. Lad had made  a perfectly respectable horse run madly away for nearly twenty-five  feet, and had given the horse's owner a blasphemous half-mile run over  a plowed field after a cherished and ravished lap-robe. Lad had  well-nigh killed a neighbor's particularly killable dog. Lad had  wantonly destroyed the nurse's very newest and most expensive  uniform. All day it was Lad--Lad--Lad!    Lad, it seemed, was a storm-center, whence radiated complaints that  ran the whole gamut from tears to lurid profanity; and, to each and  every complainant, the Master made the same answer:    \"Leave him alone. We're just out of hell--Lad and I! He's doing the  things I'd do myself, if I had the nerve.\"    Which, of course, was a manifestly asinine way for a grown man to  talk.    Long after dusk, Lad pattered meekly home, very tired and quite  sane. His spell of imbecility had worn itself out. He was once more  his calmly dignified self, though not a little ashamed of his babyish  pranks, and mildly wondering how he had come to behave so.    Still, he could not grieve over what he had done. He could not grieve  over anything just yet. The Mistress was alive! And while the  craziness had passed, the happiness had not. Tired, drowsily at peace  with all the world, he curled up under the piano and went to sleep.    He slept so soundly that the locking of the house for the night did  not rouse him. But something else did. Something that occurred long  after everyone on The Place was sound asleep. Lad was joyously  pursuing, through the forest aisles of dreamland, a whole army of  squirrels that had not sense enough to climb trees--when in a moment,  he was wide awake and on guard. Far off, very far off, he heard a man  walking.    Now, to a trained dog there is as much difference in the sound of  human footfalls as, to humans, there is a difference in the aspect of  human faces. A belated countryman walking along the highway, a  furlong distant, would not have awakened Lad from sleep. Also, he knew  and could classify, at any distance, the footsteps of everyone who  lived on The Place. But the steps that had brought him wide awake and  on the alert to-night, did not belong to one of The Place's people;  nor were they the steps of anybody who had a right to be on the  premises.    Someone had climbed the fence, at a distance from the drive, and was  crossing the grounds, obliquely, toward the house. It was a man, and  he was still nearly two hundred yards away. Moreover, he was walking  stealthily; and pausing every now and then as if to reconnoiter.    No human, at that distance, could have heard the steps. No dog could  have helped hearing them. Had the other dogs been at home instead of  at the boarding-kennels, The Place would by this time have been  re-echoing with barks. Both scent and sound would have given them  ample warning of the stranger's presence.    To Lad, on the lower floor of the house, where every window was  shut, the aid of scent was denied. Yet his sense of hearing was  enough. Plainly, he heard the softly advancing steps--heard and read  them. He read them for an intruder's--read them for the steps of a man  who was afraid to be heard or seen, and who was employing all the  caution in his power.    A booming, trumpeting bark of warning sprang into Lad's throat--and  died there. The sharp command \"_Quiet!_\" was still in force. Even in  his madness, that day, he had uttered no sound. He strangled back the  tumultuous bark and listened in silence. He had risen to his feet and  had come out from under the piano. In the middle of the living-room he  stood, head lowered, ears pricked. His ruff was abristle. A ridge of  hair rose grotesquely from the shaggy mass of coat along his  spine. His lips had slipped back from his teeth. And so he stood and  waited.    The shuffling, soft steps were nearer now. Down through the trees they  came, and then onto the springy grass of the lawn. Now they crunched  lightly on the gravel of the drive. Lad moved forward a little and  again stood at attention.    The man was climbing to the veranda. The vines rustled ever so  slightly as he brushed past them. His footfall sounded lightly on the  veranda itself.    Next there was a faint clicking noise at the old-fashioned lock of one  of the bay windows. Presently, by half inches, the window began to  rise. Before it had risen an inch, Lad knew the trespasser was a  negro. Also that it was no one with whose scent he was familiar.    Another pause, followed by the very faintest scratching, as the negro  ran a knife-blade along the crack "]]]
