And she blushed a little, too!\"    \"Oh, what a cold kiss!\" cried Peony.    Just then, there came a breeze of the pure west wind sweeping through  the garden and rattling the parlour-windows. It sounded so wintry  cold, that the mother was about to tap on the window-pane with her  thimbled finger, to summon the two children in, when they both cried  out to her with one voice:    \"Mamma! mamma! We have finished our little snow-sister, and she is  running about the garden with us!\"    \"What imaginative little beings my children are!\" thought the mother,  putting the last few stitches into Peony's frock. \"And it is strange,  too, that they make me almost as much a child as they themselves are!  I can hardly help believing now that the snow-image has really come to  life!\"    \"Dear mamma!\" cried Violet, \"pray look out and see what a sweet  playmate we have!\"    The mother, being thus entreated, could no longer delay to look forth  from the window. The sun was now gone out of the sky, leaving,  however, a rich inheritance of his brightness among those purple and  golden clouds which make the sunsets of winter so magnificent.    But there was not the slightest gleam or dazzle, either on the window  or on the snow; so that the good lady could look all over the garden,  and see everything and everybody in it. And what do you think she saw  there? Violet and Peony, of course, her own two darling children.    Ah, but whom or what did she see besides? Why, if you will believe me,  there was a small figure of a girl, dressed all in white, with  rose-tinged cheeks and ringlets of golden hue, playing about the  garden with the two children!    A stranger though she was, the child seemed to be on as familiar terms  with Violet and Peony, and they with her, as if all the three had been  playmates during the whole of their little lives. The mother thought  to herself that it must certainly be the daughter of one of the  neighbours, and that, seeing Violet and Peony in the garden, the child  had run across the street to play with them.    So this kind lady went to the door, intending to invite the little  runaway into her comfortable parlour; for, now that the sunshine was  withdrawn, the atmosphere out of doors was already growing very cold.    But, after opening the house-door, she stood an instant on the  threshold, hesitating whether she ought to ask the child to come in,  or whether she should even speak to her. Indeed, she almost doubted  whether it were a real child, after all, or only a light wreath of the  new-fallen snow, blown hither and thither about the garden by the  intensely cold west wind.    There was certainly something very singular in the aspect of the  little stranger. Among all the children of the neighbourhood the lady  could remember no such face, with its pure white and delicate  rose-colour, and the golden ringlets tossing about the forehead and  cheeks.    And as for her dress, which was entirely of white, and fluttering in  the breeze, it was such as no reasonable woman would put upon a little  girl when sending her out to play in the depth of winter. It made this  kind and careful mother shiver only to look at those small feet, with  nothing in the world on them except a very thin pair of white  slippers.    Nevertheless, airily as she was clad, the child seemed to feel not the  slightest inconvenience from the cold, but danced so lightly over the  snow that the tips of her toes left hardly a print in its surface;  while Violet could but just keep pace with her, and Peony's short legs  compelled him to lag behind.    All this while, the mother stood on the threshold, wondering how a  little girl could look so much like a flying snow-drift, or how a  snow-drift could look so very like a little girl.    She called Violet and whispered to her.    \"Violet, my darling, what is this child's name?\" asked she. \"Does she  live near us?\"    \"Why, dearest mamma,\" answered Violet, laughing to think that her  mother did not comprehend so very plain an affair, \"this is our  little snow-sister whom we have just been making!\"    \"Yes, dear mamma,\" cried Peony, running to his mother, and looking up  simply into her face. \"This is our snow-image! Is it not a nice 'ittle  child?\"    \"Violet,\" said her mother, greatly perplexed, \"tell me the truth,  without any jest. Who is this little girl?\"    \"My darling mamma,\" answered Violet, looking seriously into her  mother's face, surprised that she should need any further explanation,  \"I have told you truly who she is. It is our little snow-image which  Peony and I have been making. Peony will tell you so, as well as I.\"    \"Yes, mamma,\" declared Peony, with much gravity in his crimson little  phiz, \"this is 'ittle snow-child. Is not she a nice one? But, mamma,  her hand is, oh, so very cold!\"    While mamma still hesitated what to think and what to do, the  street-gate was thrown open, and the father of Violet and Peony  appeared, wrapped in a pilot-cloth sack, with a fur cap drawn down  over his ears, and the thickest of gloves upon his hands.    Mr. Lindsey was a middle-aged man, with a weary and yet a happy look  in his wind-flushed and frost-pinched face, as if he had been busy all  day long, and was glad to get back to his quiet home. His eyes  brightened at the sight of his wife and children, although he could  not help uttering a word or two of surprise at finding the whole  family in the open air, on so bleak a day, and after sunset, too.    He soon perceived the little white stranger, sporting to and fro in  the garden, like a dancing snow-wreath and the flock of snowbirds  fluttering about her head.    \"Pray, what little girl may this be?\" inquired this very sensible man.  \"Surely her mother must be crazy, to let her go out in such bitter  weather as it has been today, with only that flimsy white gown and  those thin slippers!\"    \"My dear husband,\" said his wife, \"I know no more about the little  thing than you do. Some neighbour's child, I suppose. Our Violet and  Peony,\" she added, laughing at herself for repeating so absurd a  story, \"insist that she is nothing but a snow-image which they have  been busy about in the garden, almost all the afternoon.\"    As she said this, the mother glanced her eyes toward the spot where  the children's snow-image had been made. What was her surprise on  perceiving that there was not the slightest trace of so much  labour!--no image at all!--no piled-up heap of snow!--nothing  whatever, save the prints of little footsteps around a vacant space!    \"This is very strange!\" said she.    \"What is strange, dear mother?\" asked Violet. \"Dear father, do not you  see how it is? This is our snow-image, which Peony and I have made,  because we wanted another playmate. Did not we, Peony?\"    \"Yes, papa,\" said crimson Peony. \"This is our 'ittle snow-sister. Is  she not beau-ti-ful? But she gave me such a cold kiss!\"    \"Pooh, nonsense, children!\" cried their good honest father, who had a  plain, sensible way of looking at matters. \"Do not tell me of making  live figures out of snow. Come, wife; this little stranger must not  stay out in the bleak air a moment longer. We will bring her into the  parlour; and you shall give her a supper of warm bread and milk, and  make her as comfortable as you can.\"    So saying, this honest and very kind-hearted man was going toward the  little damsel, with the best intentions in the world. But Violet and  Peony, each seizing their father by the hand, earnestly besought him  not to make her come in.    \"Nonsense, children, nonsense, nonsense!\" cried the father,  half-vexed, half-laughing. \"Run into the house, this moment! It is too  late to play any longer now. I must take care of this little girl  immediately, or she will catch her death of cold.\"    And so, with a most benevolent smile, this very well-meaning gentleman  took the snow-child by the hand and led her toward the house.    She followed him, droopingly and reluctant, for all the glow and  sparkle were gone out of her figure; and, whereas just before she had  resembled a bright, frosty, star-gemmed evening, with a crimson gleam  on the cold horizon, she now looked as dull and languid as a thaw.    As kind Mr. Lindsey led her up the steps of the door, Violet and Peony  looked into his face, their eyes full of tears which froze before they  could run down their cheeks, and again entreated him not to bring  their snow-image into the house.    \"Not bring her in!\" exclaimed the kind-hearted man. \"Why, you are  crazy, my little Violet!--quite crazy, my small Peony! She is so cold  already that her hand has almost frozen mine, in spite of my thick  gloves. Would you have her freeze to death?\"    His wife, as he came up the steps, had been taking another long,  earnest gaze at the little white stranger. She hardly knew whether it  was a dream or no; but she could not help fancying that she saw the  delicate print of Violet's fingers on the child's neck. It looked just  as if, while Violet was shaping out the image, she had given it a  gentle pat with her hand, and had neglected to smooth the impression  quite away.    \"After all, husband,\" said the mother, \"after all, she does look  strangely like a snow-image! I do believe she is made of snow!\"    A puff of the west wind blew against the snow-child, and again she  sparkled like a star.    \"Snow!\" repeated good Mr. Lindsey, drawing the reluctant guest over  his hospitable threshold. \"No wonder she looks like snow. She is half  frozen, poor little thing! But a good fire will put everything to  rights.\"    This common-sensible man placed the snow-child on the hearth-rug,  right in front of the hissing and fuming stove.    \"Now she will be comfortable!\" cried Mr. Lindsey, rubbing his hands  and looking about him, with the pleasantest smile you ever saw. \"Make  yourself at home, my child.\"    Sad, sad and drooping, looked the little white maiden as she stood on  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3458"],[0,"Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures (#6)"],[1,"                   Moral victory    21:1    If Truth is overcoming error in your daily walk and          conversation, you can finally say, \"I have fought a  21:3    good fight . . . I have kept the faith,\" be-          cause you are a better man. This is having          our part in the at-one-ment with Truth and Love.  21:6    Christians do not continue to labor and pray, expecting          because of another's goodness, suffering, and triumph,          that they shall reach his harmony and reward.    21:9    If the disciple is advancing spiritually, he is striv-          ing to enter in. He constantly turns away from ma-          terial sense, and looks towards the imperishable things  21:12   of Spirit. If honest, he will be in earnest from the          start, and gain a little each day in the right direction,          till at last he finishes his course with joy.                             Inharmonious travellers    21:15   If my friends are going to Europe, while I am /en          route/ for California, we are not journeying together.          We have separate time-tables to consult,  21:18   different routes to pursue. Our paths have          diverged at the very outset, and we have little oppor-          tunity to help each other. On the contrary, if my  21:21   friends pursue my course, we have the same railroad          guides, and our mutual interests are identical; or, if I          take up their line of travel, they help me on, and our  21:24   companionship may continue.                                  Zigzag course            Being in sympathy with matter, the worldly man is at          the beck and call of error, and will be attracted thither-  21:27   ward. He is like a traveller going westward          for a pleasure-trip. The company is alluring          and the pleasures exciting. After following the sun for  21:30   six days, he turns east on the seventh, satisfied if he can          only imagine himself drifting in the right direction. By-          and-by, ashamed of his zigzag course, he would borrow  22:1    the passport of some wiser pilgrim, thinking with the aid          of this to find and follow the right road.                               Moral retrogression    22:3    Vibrating like a pendulum between sin and the hope          of forgiveness,- selfishness and sensuality causing con-          stant retrogression,- our moral progress will  22:6    be slow. Waking to Christ's demand, mortals          experience suffering. This causes them, even as drown-          ing men, to make vigorous efforts to save themselves; and  22:9    through Christ's precious love these efforts are crowned          with success.                                 Wait for reward            \"Work out your own salvation,\" is the demand of  22:12   Life and Love, for to this end God worketh with you.          \"Occupy till I come!\" Wait for your re-          ward, and \"be not weary in well doing.\" If  22:15   your endeavors are beset by fearful odds, and you receive          no present reward, go not back to error, nor become a          sluggard in the race.    22:18   When the smoke of battle clears away, you will dis-          cern the good you have done, and receive according to          your deserving. Love is not hasty to deliver us from  22:21   temptation, for Love means that we shall be tried and          purified.                            Deliverance not vicarious            Final deliverance from error, whereby we rejoice in  22:24   immortality, boundless freedom, and sinless sense, is not          reached through paths of flowers nor by pinning          one's faith without works to another's vicarious  22:27   effort. Whosoever believeth that wrath is righteous or          that divinity is appeased by human suffering, does not          understand God.                            Justice and substitution    22:30   Justice requires reformation of the sinner. Mercy          cancels the debt only when justice approves. Revenge          is inadmissible. Wrath which is only appeased is not  23:1    destroyed, but partially indulged. Wisdom and Love          may require many sacrifices of self to save us from sin.  23:3    One sacrifice, however great, is insufficient to          pay the debt of sin. The atonement requires          constant self-immolation on the sinner's part. That  23:6    God's wrath should be vented upon His beloved Son, is          divinely unnatural. Such a theory is man-made. The          atonement is a hard problem in theology, but its scien-  23:9    tific explanation is, that suffering is an error of sinful sense          which Truth destroys, and that eventually both sin and suf-          fering will fall at the feet of everlasting Love.                               Doctrines and faith    23:12   Rabbinical lore said: \"He that taketh one doctrine,          firm in faith, has the Holy Ghost dwelling in him.\"          This preaching receives a strong rebuke in  23:15   the Scripture, \"Faith without works is dead.\"          Faith, if it be mere belief, is as a pendulum swinging be-          tween nothing and something, having no fixity. Faith,  23:18   advanced to spiritual understanding, is the evidence gained          from Spirit, which rebukes sin of every kind and estab-          lishes the claims of God.                          Self-reliance and confidence    23:21   In Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and English, /faith/ and the          words corresponding thereto have these two defini-          tions, /trustfulness/ and /trustworthiness/. One  23:24   kind of faith trusts one's welfare to others.          Another kind of faith understands divine Love and how          to work out one's \"own salvation, with fear and trem-  23:27   bling.\" \"Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief!\"          expresses the helplessness of a blind faith; whereas the          injunction, \"Believe . . . and thou shalt be saved!\"  23:30   demands self-reliant trustworthiness, which includes spir-          itual understanding and confides all to God.            The Hebrew verb /to believe/ means also /to be firm/ or  24:1    /to be constant/. This certainly applies to Truth and Love          understood and practised. Firmness in error will never  24:3    save from sin, disease, and death.                             Life's healing currents            Acquaintance with the original texts, and willingness          to give up human beliefs (established by hierarchies, and  24:6    instigated sometimes by the worst passions of          men), open the way for Christian Science to be          understood, and make the Bible the chart of life, where  24:9    the buoys and healing currents of Truth are pointed          out.                                 Radical changes            He to whom \"the arm of the Lord\" is revealed will  24:12   believe our report, and rise into newness of life with re-          generation. This is having part in the atone-          ment; this is the understanding, in which  24:15   Jesus suffered and triumphed. The time is not distant          when the ordinary theological views of atonement will          undergo a great change, - a change as radical as that  24:18   which has come over popular opinions in regard to pre-          destination and future punishment.                             Purpose of crucifixion            Does erudite theology regard the crucifixion of Jesus  24:21   chiefly as providing a ready pardon for all sinners who          ask for it and are willing to be forgiven?          Does spiritualism find Jesus' death necessary  24:24   only for the presentation, after death, of the material          Jesus, as a proof that spirits can return to earth? Then          we must differ from them both.    24:27   The efficacy of the crucifixion lay in the practical af-          fection and goodness it demonstrated for mankind. The          truth had been lived among men; but until they saw that  24:30   it enabled their Master to triumph over the grave, his own          disciples could not admit such an event to be possible.          After the resurrection, even the unbelieving Thomas was  25:1    forced to acknowledge how complete was the great proof of          Truth and Love.                              True flesh and blood    25:3    The spiritual essence of blood is sacrifice. The effi-          cacy of Jesus' spiritual offering is infinitely greater than          can be expressed by our sense of human  25:6    blood. The material blood of Jesus was no          more efficacious to cleanse from sin when it was shed          upon \"the accursed tree,\" than when it was flowing in  25:9    his veins as he went daily about his Father's business.          His true flesh and blood were his Life; and they truly eat          his flesh and drink his blood, who partake of that divine  25:12   Life.                                Effective triumph            Jesus taught the way of Life by demonstration, that          we may understand how this divine Principle heals  25:15   the sick, casts out error, and triumphs over          death. Jesus presented the ideal of God better          than could any man whose origin was less spiritual. By  25:18   his obedience to God, he demonstrated more spiritu-          ally than all others the Principle of being. Hence the          force of his admonition, \"If ye love me, keep my com-  25:21   mandments.\"            Though demonstrating his control over sin and disease,          the great Teacher by no means relieved others from giving  25:24   the requisite proofs of their own piety. He worked for          their guidance, that they might demonstrate this power as          he did and understand its divine Principle. Implicit faith  25:27   in the Teacher and all the emotional love we can bestow          on him, will never alone make us imitators of him. We          must go and do likewise, else we are not improving the  25:30   great"]]]
