Seleucia, on the right bank of the  river, is little more now than a historic name, but the palace of  Tak-i-Kasr, with its superb archway 100 feet in height, has been even  in recent times magnificent enough in its ruin to recall the glories  of the Parthian kings, and the days when, according to Gibbon,  \"Khosroes Nushirwan gave audience to the ambassadors of the world\"  within its stately walls. Its gaunt and shattered remains have even  still a mournful grandeur about them, but they have suffered so  severely from the barbarous removal of the stones and the fall of much  of the front as to be altogether disappointing.    Soon after leaving Ctesiphon there is increased cultivation, and  within a few miles of Baghdad the banks of the river, which is its  great high road, become populous. \"Palatial residences,\" in which the  women's apartments are indicated by the blankness of their walls, are  mixed up with mud hovels and goat's-hair tents; there are large  farmhouses with enclosures for cattle and horses; date gardens and  orange groves fringe the stream, and arrangements for drawing water  are let into its banks at frequent intervals. Strings of asses laden  with country produce, companies of horsemen and innumerable foot  passengers, all moved citywards.    The frosty sun rose out of an orange sky as a disc of blood and flame,  but the morning became misty and overcast, so that the City of the  Arabian Nights did not burst upon the view in any halo of splendour. A  few tiled minarets, the blue domes of certain mosques, handsome  houses,--some of them European Consulates, half hidden by orange  groves laden with their golden fruitage,--a picturesque bridge of  boats, a dense growth of palms on the right bank, beyond which gleam  the golden domes of Kazimain and the top of Zobeide's tomb, the  superannuated British gun-boat _Comet_, two steamers, a crowd of  native craft, including _kufas_ or _gophers_, a prominent  Custom-house, and decayed alleys opening on the water, make up the  Baghdad of the present as seen from the _Mejidieh's_ deck.    As soon as we anchored swarms of _kufas_ clustered round us, and  swarms of officials and _hamals_ (porters) invaded the deck. Some of  the passengers had landed two hours before, others had proceeded to  their destinations at once, and as my friends had not come off I was  alone for some time in the middle of a tremendous Babel, in which  every man shouted at the top of his voice and all together, Hadji  assuming a deportment of childish helplessness. Certain officials  under cover of bribes lavished on my behalf by a man who spoke  English professed to let my baggage pass unopened, then a higher  official with a sword knocked Hadji down, then a man said that  everything would be all right if I would bestow another gold _lira_,  about L1, on the officers, and I was truly glad when kind Captain  Dougherty with Dr. Sutton came alongside in the _Comet's_ boat, and  brought me ashore. The baggage was put into another of her boats, but  as soon as we were out of sight it was removed, and was taken to the  Custom-house, where they insisted that some small tent poles in a  cover were guns, and smashed a box of dates in the idea that it was  tobacco!    The Church Mission House, in which I am receiving hospitality, is a  \"native\" house, though built and decorated by Persians, as also are  several of the Consulates. It is in a narrow roadway with blank walls,  a part of the European quarter; a door of much strength admits into a  small courtyard, round which are some of the servants' quarters and  reception rooms for Moslem visitors, and within this again is a  spacious and handsome courtyard, round which are kitchens, domestic  offices, and the _serdabs_, which play an important part in Eastern  life.    These _serdabs_ are semi-subterranean rooms, usually with arched  fronts, filled in above-ground with latticework. They are lofty, and  their vaulted roofs are supported in rich men's houses on pillars. The  well of the household is often found within. The general effect of  this one is that of a crypt, and it was most appropriate for the  Divine Service in English which greeted my arrival. The cold of it  was, however, frightful. It was only when the Holy Communion was over  that I found that I was wearing Hadji's revolver and cartridge belt  under my cloak, which he had begged me to put on to save them from  confiscation! In these vaulted chambers both Europeans and natives  spend the hot season, sleeping at night on the roofs.    Above this lower floor are the winter apartments, which open upon a  fine stone balcony running round three sides of the court. On the  river side of the house there is an orange garden, which just now  might be the garden of the Hesperides, and a terrace, below which is  the noble, swirling Tigris, and beyond, a dark belt of palms. These  rooms on the river front have large projecting windows, six in a row,  with screens which slide up and down, and those which look to the  courtyard are secluded by very beautiful fretwork. The drawing-room,  used as a dormitory, is a superb room, in which exquisitely beautiful  ceiling and wall decorations in shades of fawn enriched with gold, and  fretwork windows, suggest Oriental feeling at every turn. The  plaster-work of this room is said to be distinctively Persian and is  very charming. The house, though large, is inconveniently crowded,  with the medical and clerical mission families, two lady missionaries,  and two guests. Each apartment has two rows of vaulted recesses in its  walls, and very fine cornices above. It is impossible to warm the  rooms, but the winter is very short and brilliant, and after ulsters,  greatcoats, and fur cloaks have been worn for breakfast, the sun  mitigates the temperature.         I. L. B.          LETTER II           BAGHDAD, _Jan. 9_.    Baghdad is too well known from the careful descriptions given of it by  Eastern travellers to justify me in lingering upon it in detail, and I  will only record a few impressions, which are decidedly _couleur de  rose_, for the weather is splendid, making locomotion a pleasure, and  the rough, irregular roadways which at other seasons are deep in foul  and choking dust, or in mud and pestilential slime, are now firm and  not remarkably dirty.    A little earlier than this the richer inhabitants, who have _warstled_  through the summer in their dim and latticed _serdabs_, emerge and  pitch their tents in the plains of Ctesiphon, where the men find a  stimulating amusement in hunting the boar, but it is now the \"season\"  in the city, the liveliest and busiest time of the year. The cholera,  which is believed to have claimed 6000 victims, has departed, and the  wailing of the women, which scarcely ceased day or night for a month,  is silent. The Jewish troubles, which apparently rose out of the  indignation of the Moslems at the burial within the gates, contrary to  a strict edict on the subject, of a Rabbi who died of cholera, have  subsided, and the motley populations and their yet more motley creeds  are for the time at peace.    In the daytime there is a roar or hum of business, mingled with  braying of asses, squeals of belligerent horses, yells of  camel-drivers and muleteers, beating of drums, shouts of beggars,  hoarse-toned ejaculations of fakirs, ear-splitting snatches of  discordant music, and in short a chorus of sounds unfamiliar to  Western ears, but the nights are so still that the swirl of the Tigris  as it hurries past is distinctly heard. Only the long melancholy call  to prayer, or the wail of women over the dead, or the barking of dogs,  breaks the silence which at sunset falls as a pall over Baghdad.    Under the blue sunny sky the river view is very fine. The river itself  is imposing from its breadth and volume, and in the gorgeous sunsets,  with a sky of crimson flame, and the fronds of the dark date palms  mirrored in its reddened waters, it looks really beautiful. The city  is stately enough as far as the general _coup-d'oeil_ of the river  front goes, and its river _facade_ agreeably surprises me. The Tigris,  besides being what may be called the main street, divides Baghdad into  two unequal parts, and though the city on the left bank has almost a  monopoly of picturesque and somewhat stately irregularity in the  houses of fair height, whose lattices and oriel windows overhang the  stream from an environment of orange gardens, the dark date groves  dignify the meaner buildings of the right bank. The rush of a great  river is in itself attractive, and from the roof of this house the  view is fascinating, with the ceaseless movements of hundreds of boats  and _kufas_, the constant traffic of men, horses, asses, and caravans  across the great bridge of boats, and the long lines of buildings  which with more or less picturesqueness line the great waterway.    Without the wearisomeness of sight-seeing there is much to be seen in  Baghdad, and though much that would be novel to a new-comer from the  West is familiar to me after two years of Eastern travel, there is a  great deal that is really interesting. The _kufas_ accumulating at  their landing, freighted with the products of the Upper Tigris, the  transpontine city, in which country produce takes the foremost place;  the tramway to Kazimain constructed during the brief valiship of  Midhat Pasha, on which the last journey of the day is always performed  at a gallop, _coute que coute_; the caravans of asses, each one with a  huge fish, the \"Fish of Tobias,\" hanging across its back; the strings  of the same humble animal, carrying skins of water from the river  throughout the city; the tombs, the mosques, the churches, the great  caravans of mules and camels, almost monopolising the narrow roadways,  Arabs and Osmanlis on showy horses, Persians, Turks, Arabs, Jews,  Armenians, Chaldaeans,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38828"],[0,"Journeys in Persia and Kurdistan, Volume 2 (of 2) (#6)"],[1," seems much disturbed. We heard of bloodshed two days ago,  and to-day in the Kharba valley of fighting among the Kuh-i-Shahan  mountains with the loss of twelve lives, and horsemen passed us armed  with long guns and swords on their way to tribal war. I fear I shall  have to return to Isfahan. Things are regarded as looking very  precarious farther on, and every movement, retrograde or forward, is  beset with difficulties.    I. L. B.          LETTER XVII           CAMP GAL-I-GAV, KUH-I-RANG, _July 2_.    From Dima we ascended to high tablelands, having the snowy Zard Kuh  ever in sight, one nameless peak being at present pure white, and  descended into and crossed the Shorab, a fertile valley, on one side  of which is the famous cleft called Kar Kanun, an artificial gash  across a spur of the Kuh-i-Rang of the same name. After winding among  mountains we descended on the Karun, whose waters, clear, rapid, and  peacock-green, fertilise a plain of fine flowery turf lying at the  base of hills, with another branch of the Karun between them and the  Zard Kuh.    It is a lovely plain, bright and smiling, contrasting with the savage  magnificence of the Zard Kuh, which comes down upon it with its peaks,  chasms, and precipices, and glittering fields of unbroken snow. It was  given up to mares and foals, but green platforms high above, and  little hollows in the foot-hills were spotted with Ilyat tents, and in  the four days which we spent there the camps were never free from  Ilyat visitors. The Sahib came in the first evening with one man badly  hurt, and another apparently in the first stage of rheumatic fever. A  small tent was rigged for this poor fellow, who was in intense pain  and quite helpless, with a temperature of 104 deg., and every joint  swollen. The usual remedies had no effect on him. I had had a present  of a small quantity of _salol_, a newish drug, with directions for  its use, and his master Hadji undertook to make him take it regularly,  and hot tea when he fancied it, and at the end of twenty-two hours he  was not only free from fever but from pain, and was able to mount a  mule.[1]    There are two definite objects of interest close to the plain of  Chaman Kushan, the reputed source of the Karun and the great  artificial cleft of Kar Kanun. I visited the first on a misty day,  which exaggerated the height of the mountains, and by filling their  chasms with translucent blue atmosphere gave a rare loveliness to the  whole, for it must be said that the beauties of Persian scenery are  usually staring, hard, and unveiled. The fords of two or three rivers,  including the Karun, some steep ascents and descents, a rough ride  along a stony slope of the Zard Kuh, and the crossing of a very solid  snow-bridge took us to the top of a cliff exactly opposite the  powerful springs in which the Karun has its reputed origin.    Over this source towers the mighty range of the Zard Kuh,--a colossal  mountain barrier, a mass of yellow and gray limestone, with stupendous  snow-filled chasms, huge precipices, and vast snow-fields, treeless  and destitute of herbage except where the tulip-studded grass runs up  to meet the moisture from the snow-fields. It is the birthplace of  innumerable torrents, but one alone finds its way to the sea.    These springs are in a lateral slit in a lofty limestone precipice  below a snow-field, at one end of which, as if from a shaft, the  most powerful of them wells up, and uniting with the others in a sort  of grotto of ferns and mosses pours over a ledge in a sheet of foam, a  powerful waterfall, and slides away, a vigorous river of a wonderful  blue-green colour, under a snow-bridge, starting full fledged on its  course. The surroundings of this spring are wild and magnificent. A  few Bakhtiaris crept across the lower part of the face of rock, and  perched themselves above it. The roar of the water, now loud, now  subdued, made wild music, and the snow-bridges added to the  impressiveness of the scene.      [Illustration: SAR-I-CHESMEH-I-KURANG _To face p. 29, vol. II._]    Of course the geographical interest of this region is engrossing.[2]  This remarkable spring, called by the Bakhtiaris  Sar-i-Cheshmeh-i-Kurang (\"the head source of the Kurang\"), and until  this journey held to be the real source, is not, however, the actual  birthplace of the Karun or Kurang, which was afterwards traced up to  its headwaters in the magnificent Kuh-i-Rang.[3]    A few words on this, the one real river of which Persia can boast, and  which seems destined to play an important part in her commercial  future, will not be out of place. From its source it is a powerful and  important stream, full, deep, and flowing with great velocity for much  of its upper course between precipices varying in height from 1000 to  3000 feet. It is a perennial stream, fordable in very few places, and  then only in its upper waters. Varying in width usually from fifty to  a hundred yards, it is compressed at the Pul-i-Ali-kuh into a breadth  of about nine feet.    The steepness and height of its banks make it in general useless for  irrigation purposes, but some day it may be turned to account as a  great \"water power.\" Its windings, dictated by the singular formation  of the mountain ranges (for I reject the idea of it having \"carved\"  its channel), are almost phenomenal. After flowing south-east for a  hundred miles from its source, it makes an acute bend, flows for fifty  miles to the south-west, and then making another fantastic turn it  flows in an exactly opposite direction to that of its earlier course,  proceeding north-west to Shuster for a hundred miles.    It is calculated that the distance from the Kuh-i-Rang to Shuster as  the crow flies is seventy-five miles, but the distance travelled by  the waters of the Karun is 250 miles, with an aggregate fall of 9000  feet.    Besides being fed on its journey through the Bakhtiari country by many  mountain-side fountain springs of pure fresh water, as well as by salt  streams and springs, it receives various tributaries, among the most  important of which are the Ab-i-Bazuft and a stream which, though  known locally under various names, may be called from the Chigakhor  basin in which it rises the Ab-i-Chigakhor, which makes a course of  ninety miles to get over a distance of twenty; the Darkash Warkash  flowing in from the Chahar Mahals near Ardal, the Dinarud rising in  the fair valley of Gorab, and the Ab-i-Cherri or Duab.    This mountain range, the Zard Kuh, in whose steep side at a height of  over 8000 feet the Sar-i-Cheshmeh-i-Kurang wells up so grandly, is  rather a series of rock summits and precipices than a range of  mountains. In late June its naked shelves and battlements upbore great  snow-fields, and its huge rifts or passes--the Gil-i-Shah, nearly  11,700 feet in altitude, and the Pambakal, 11,400--were full of snow.  But even in four days it melted rapidly, and probably by August little  remains except a few patches, in the highest and most sunless of the  rifts. It is only on the north side that the snow lasts even into  July.      [Illustration: ZARD KUH RANGE. _To face p. 30, vol. II._]    The marked features of this range are its narrow wall-like character,  its ruggedness on both sides, its absence of any peaks rising very  remarkably above the ordinary jagged level of the barrier, its lack of  prominent spurs, and its almost complete nakedness. It is grand, but  only under rare atmospheric conditions can it be termed beautiful. Its  length may be about thirty miles. It runs from north-west to  south-east. Some of its highest summits attain an elevation of 13,000  feet. Its name is a corruption of Sard Kuh, \"cold mountain.\"    After fording various snow streams and taking a break-neck goat track,  we reached the great snow pass of Gil-i-Shah, by which the Bakhtiaris  come up from the Shuster plains on the firm snow in spring, returning  when the snow is soft in autumn by a very difficult track on the rocky  ledges above. In the mist it looked the most magnificent and  stupendous pass I had ever seen, always excepting the entrance to the  Lachalang Pass in Lesser Tibet, and an atmospheric illusion raised the  mountains which guard it up to the blue sky. I much wished to reach  the summit, but in a very narrow chasm was fairly baffled by a wide  rift in a sort of elevated snow-bridge which the mule could not cross,  and camped there for some hours; but even there nomads crowded round  my tent with more audacity in their curiosity than they usually show,  and Mirza heard two of them planning an ingenious robbery.    The heat was very great when I returned, 100 deg. in the shade, but rest  was impossible, for numbers of mares and horses were tethered near my  tent, and their riders, men and women, to the number of forty, seized  on me, clamouring for medicines and eye lotions. I often wonder at the  quiet gravity of Mirza's face as he interprets their grotesque  accounts of their ailments. A son of Chiragh Ali Khan came to tell me  that the \"Feringhi ointment\" had cured a beautiful young woman of his  tribe of an \"abscess in her nose\"! An instance of real benefit hardly  consoles for many failures, and any cure increases the exhausting  number of \"patients.\" On one day on that plain there was no rest  between eleven and five.    Small events occurred tending to show that the good order which the  Ilkhani's government secures is chiefly round the centre of rule.  Stories of tribal disputes with violence, and of fights arising out of  blood feuds came in daily, and recent sword cuts and bullet wounds  were brought to the _Hak[=i]m_. One day there was a disturbance in  camp owing to a man attacking Hassan for preventing a woman from  entering my tent in my absence. I learned very soon after coming into  this country that the Bakhtiaris are dangerously sensitive about their  women, although the latter are unveiled and have an amount of"]]]
