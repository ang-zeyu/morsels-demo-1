The defendant was convicted  on his own story, supplemented by the evidence of the witness who made  the tests.    The most obvious and first requirement is, as has been said, to find  the direct witnesses to the facts surrounding the crime, commit their  statements under oath to writing, so that they cannot later be denied  or evaded, and make sure that these witnesses will not only hold no  intercourse with the other side, but will be on hand when wanted. This  last is not always an easy task, and various expedients often have to  be resorted to, such as placing hostile witnesses under police  surveillance, or in some cases in \"houses of detention,\" and hiding  others in out-of-the-way places, or supplying them with a bodyguard if  violence is to be anticipated. When the proper time comes the favorable  witnesses must be duly drilled or coached, which does not imply anything  improper, but means merely that they must be instructed how to deliver  their testimony, what answers are expected to certain questions, and  what facts it is intended to elicit from them. Witnesses are often  offended and run amuck because they are not given a chance upon the  stand to tell the story of their lives. This must be guarded against and  steps taken to have their statements given in such a way that they are  audible and intelligible. A few lessons in elementary elocution are  generally vitally necessary. The man with the bassoon voice must be  tamed, and the birdlike old lady made to chirp more loudly. But all this  is the self-evident preparation which must take place in every case, and  while highly important is of far less interest than the development  of the circumstantial evidence which is the next consideration of the  district attorney.    The discovery and proper proof of minute facts which tend to demonstrate  the guilt of an accused are the joy of the natural prosecutor, and he  may in his enthusiasm spend many thousands of dollars on what seems, and  often is, an immaterial matter. Youthful officials intrusted with the  preparation of important cases often become unduly excited and forget  that the taxpayers are paying the bills. The writer remembers sitting  beside one of these enthusiasts during a celebrated trial. A certain  woman witness had incidentally testified to a remote meeting with  the deceased at which a certain other woman was alleged to have been  present. The matter did not seem of much interest or importance, but  the youth in question seized a yellow pad and excitedly wrote in blue  pencil, \"Find Birdie\" (the other lady) \"at any cost!\" This he handed  to a detective, who hastened importantly away. It is to be hoped that  \"Birdie\" was found speedily and in an inexpensive manner.    When the case against Albert T. Patrick, later convicted of the murder  of the aged William M. Rice, was in course of preparation, it was found  desirable to show that Patrick had called up his accomplice on the  telephone upon the night of the murder. Accordingly, the telephone  company was compelled to examine several hundred thousand telephone  slips to determine whether or not this had actually occurred. While the  fact was established in the affirmative, the company now destroys its  slips in order not to have to repeat the performance a second time.    Likewise, in the preparation of the Molineux case it became important  to demonstrate that the accused had sent a letter under an assumed name  ordering certain remedies. As a result, one of the employees of the  patent-medicine company spent several months going over their old mail  orders and comparing them with a certain sample, until at last the  letter was unearthed. Of course, the district attorney had to pay for  it, and it was probably worth what it cost to the prosecution, although  Molineux's conviction was reversed by the Court of Appeals and he was  acquitted upon his second trial.    The danger is, however, that a prosecutor who has an unlimited amount  of money at his disposal may be led into expenditures which are hardly  justified simply because he thinks they may help to secure a conviction.  Nothing is easier than to waste money in this fashion, and public  officials sometimes spend the county's money with considerably more  freedom than they would their own under similar circumstances.    The legitimate expenses connected with the preparation of every  important case are naturally large. For example, diagrams must be  prepared, photographs taken of the place of the crime, witnesses  compensated for their time and their expenses paid, and, most important  of all, competent experts must be engaged. This leads us to an  interesting aspect of the modern jury trial.    When no other defence to homicide is possible the claim of insanity is  frequently interposed. Nothing is more confusing to the ordinary juryman  than trying to determine the probative value of evidence touching  unsoundness of mind, and the application thereto of the legal test  of criminal responsibility. In point of fact, juries are hardly to be  blamed for this, since the law itself is antiquated and the subject one  abounding in difficulty. Unfortunately the opportunity for vague yet  damaging testimony on the part of experts, the ease with which  any desired opinion can be defended by a slight alteration in the  hypothetical facts, and the practical impossibility of exposure,  have been seized upon with avidity by a score or more of unscrupulous  alienists who are prepared to sell their services to the highest bidder.  These men are all the more dangerous because, clever students of mental  disease and thorough masters of their subject as they are, they are able  by adroit qualifications and skilful evasions to make half-truths seem  as convincing as whole ones. They ask and receive large sums for their  services, and their dishonest testimony must be met and refuted by the  evidence of honest physicians, who, by virtue of their attainments, have  a right to demand substantial fees. Even so, newspaper reports of the  expense to the State of notorious trials are grossly exaggerated.  The entire cost of the first Thaw trial to the County of New York was  considerably less than twenty thousand dollars, and the second trial  not more than half that amount. To the defence, however, it was a costly  matter, as the recent schedules in bankruptcy of the defendant show.  Therein it appears that one of his half-dozen counsel still claims  as owing to him for his services on the first trial the modest sum of  thirty-five thousand dollars. The cost of the whole defence was probably  ten times that sum. Most of the money goes to the lawyers, and the  experts take the remainder.    It goes without saying that both prosecutor and attorney for the defence  must be masters of the subject involved. A trial for poisoning means  an exhaustive study not only of analytic chemistry, but of practical  medicine on the part of all the lawyers in the case, while a plea of  insanity requires that, for the time being, the district attorney shall  become an alienist, familiar with every aspect of paranoia, dementia  praecox, and all other forms of mania. He must also reduce his knowledge  to concrete, workable form, and be able to defeat opposing experts  on their own ground. But such knowledge comes only by prayer and  fasting--or, perhaps, rather by months of hard and remorseless grind.    The writer once prosecuted a druggist who had, by mistake, filled  a prescription for a one-fourth-grain pill of calomel with a  one-fourth-grain pill of morphine. The baby for whom the pill was  intended died in consequence. The defence was that the prescription  had been properly filled, but that the child was the victim of various  diseases, from acute gastritis to cerebro-spinal meningitis. In  preparation the writer was compelled to spend four hours every evening  for a week with three specialists, and became temporarily a minor expert  on children's diseases. To-day he is forced to admit that he would not  know a case of acute gastritis from one of mumps. But the druggist was  convicted.    Yet it is not enough to prepare for the defence you believe the accused  is going to interpose. A conscientious preparation means getting ready  for any defence he may endeavor to put in. Just as the prudent general  has an eye to every possible turn of the battle and has, if he can,  re-enforcements on the march, so the prosecutor must be ready for  anything, and readiest of all for the unexpected. He must not rest upon  the belief that the other side will concede any fact, however clear  it may seem. Some cases are lost simply because it never occurs to the  district attorney that the accused will deny something which the State  has twenty witnesses to prove. The twenty witnesses are, therefore, not  summoned on the day of trial, the defendant does deny it, and as it is a  case of word against word the accused gets the benefit of the doubt and,  perhaps, is acquitted.    No case is properly prepared unless there is in the court-room every  witness who knows anything about any aspect of the case. No one can  foretell when the unimportant will become the vital. Most cases turn  on an unconsidered point. A prosecutor once lost what seemed to him the  clearest sort of a case. When it was all over, and the defendant had  passed out of the courtroom rejoicing, he turned to the foreman and  asked the reason for the verdict.    \"Did you hear your chief witness say he was a carpenter?\" inquired the  foreman.    \"Why, certainly,\" answered the district attorney,    \"Did you hear me ask him what he paid for that ready-made pine door he  claimed to be working on when he saw the assault?\"    The prosecutor recalled the incident and nodded.    \"Well, he said ten dollars--and I knew he was a liar. A door like that  don't cost but four-fifty!\"    It is, perhaps, too"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52819"],[0,"Defense of the Faith and the Saints (Volume 2 of 2) (#6)"],[1,"failure to distinguish between personal  knowledge and argumentative inferences is all readily understood  when the history of this statement is made known. It seems that two  preachers, named D. R. Austin and John Storrs, are responsible for this  letter. Mrs. Davidson never wrote it, but afterwards stated that \"in  the main\" it was true. [44] Even with her re-affirmance of the story as  published, we cannot give it evidentiary weight except in those matters  where it is plain from the nature of things that she must have been  speaking from personal knowledge.    [Footnote 44: _Quincy Whig,_ quoted in \"The Spaulding Story Examined  and Exposed,\" 5, to be read in connection with \"Gleanings by the Way,\"  261-7. On p. 22 of the \"Myth of the Manuscript Found\" this interview  appears with the statement that the Boston _Recorder_ article was _in  the main true_ carefully omitted. For still more gross dishonesty see  \"Apostle\" (afterward Prophet) John Taylor's lying perversion of this  alleged interview as reported in his \"Three Nights' Public Discussion,\"  pp. 45 and 56. The dishonesty of the original publication of this  interview is pointed out in \"Gleanings by the Way,\" 261-4.]    Upon the question as to whether or not Spaulding's rewritten  manuscript was in the possession of anybody but Rigdon at any time  after October, 1816, Mrs. Davidson's statement as published cannot  in any sense whatever be considered as evidence. And since Mrs.  McKinstry's unsupported evidence, for the reasons already given, must  be considered as of such very infinitesimal weight, I conclude that  there is no believable evidence upon which to base the conclusion that  the \"Manuscript Found\" was ever returned to Spaulding after its second  submission to Patterson, or was ever in the trunk at Sabine's, and  therefore, could not have been either copied or stolen by Smith. This  also answers one Mormon argument made against Rigdon's theft of the  manuscript from the printing office, which argument is always based  upon the assumption that the original manuscript of the rewritten story  was in the Sabine trunk long after the time of the alleged theft by  Rigdon.    II.    When we digressed from the main lines of our argument, Spaulding's  rewritten story had been traced into the hands of Robert Patterson, a  Pittsburg publisher, and this prior to Spaulding's death in October,  1816. If the manuscript was never returned to Spaulding after its  second submission to Patterson, then what became of it? John Miller,  who knew Spaulding at Amity, bailed him out of jail when confined  for debt, made his coffin for him, and helped lay him in his grave,  says Spaulding told him \"there was a man named Sidney Rigdon about  the office [of Patterson], and they thought he had stolen it\" [the  manuscript]. [45]    [Footnote 45: Gregg's \"Prophet of Palmyra,\" 442; (date, January 20,  1882.) See also _Times and Seasons._]    The Rev. Cephus Dodd, a Presbyterian minister of Amity, Pa.,  as well as a practicing physician, attended Spaulding at his last  sickness. As early as 1832, when Mormonism was first attracting general  public attention, and two years prior to the publication of Howe's  book, in which Spaulding's story was first ventilated, this Mr. Dodd  took Mr. George M. French of Amity to Spaulding's grave, and there  expressed a positive belief that Sidney Rigdon was the agent who had  transformed Spaulding's manuscript into the Book of Mormon. The date  is fixed by Mr. French through its proximity to his removal to Amity;  hence the date given is probably correct. [46]    [Footnote 46: \"History of Washington County, Pa.,\" by Patterson. \"Who  Wrote the Book of Mormon?\" p. 10.]    The conclusion thus expressed by Mr. Dodd in advance of all public  discussion or evidence is important, because of what is necessarily  implied in it. First, it involved a comparison between Spaulding's  literary production and the Book of Mormon, with a discovered  similarity inducing conviction that the latter was a plagiarism from  the former. This comparison presupposes a knowledge of the contents  of Spaulding's rewritten manuscript. The second and most important  deduction is to be made from the assertion that Sidney Rigdon was the  connecting link in the plagiarism. Such a conclusion must have had  a foundation in Mr. Dodd's mind, and could have arisen only if he  was possessed of personal knowledge of what he considered reliable  information creating a conviction in his mind of the probability of  Sidney Rigdon's connection with the matter. This conclusion, if not  made on independent evidence, in all human probability had no less  significant foundation than a confidence in the accuracy of Spaulding's  expressed suspicion to the effect that Rigdon had stolen the manuscript  from the printing office. Thus accounted for, Dr. Dodd's statement has  less force than if presumed to have been made on independent evidence,  yet it confirms Joseph Miller's statement that Spaulding suspected  Rigdon, and that suspicion must be accounted for by those who deny  Rigdon's presence in Pittsburg prior to 1821.    HOW ABOUT SIDNEY RIGDON?    Was Spaulding's expressed suspicion that Rigdon had stolen his  manuscript from the printing office well founded? We can never know  upon what evidence the accusation was made, but we may inquire into the  probative force of such new corroborative evidence as has been adduced  since Spaulding's death.    Sidney Rigdon was born February 19, 1793, in Piny Fork of Peter's  Creek, Saint Clair Township, Allegheny County, Pa., [47] which place is  variously estimated at from six to twelve miles distant from Pittsburg.  At least until 1810, that being the date of the death of, his father,  and his own eighteenth year, Rigdon remained on the farm with his  parents. [48]    [Footnote 47: \"The Spaulding Story Examined and Exposed,\" by John E.  Page, 7. Supplement 14, _Millennial Star,_ 42. \"Myth of the Manuscript  Found,\" 24.]    [Footnote 48: Supplement 14, _Millennial Star._ 42.]    According to the Mormon account, Rigdon was licensed as a Baptist  preacher fourteen years before becoming a Mormon. [49] This would make  the date 1816, the same year in October of which Spaulding died, it  being Rigdon's twenty-fourth year, and the same year in which he stole  from the publishing office of Patterson the manuscript of Spaulding,  if the latter's suspicions shall prove well founded. A very opportune  time, be it observed, for the giving of attention to religious subjects.    [Footnote 49: 35 _Saints' Herald,_ 130.]    According to another account, and perhaps the more accurate one, Rigdon  joined the Baptist Church May 31, 1817, [50] a Welsh clergyman, Rev.  David Phillips, being his pastor. [51]. This church was located near  where the neighboring hamlet of Library is now situated. Rigdon \"began  to talk in public on religion soon after his admission to the church,  probably at his own instance, as there is no record of his license.\" [52]    [Footnote 50: \"Who Wrote the Book of Mormon?\" 8. \"Myth of the  Manuscript Found,\" 24.]    [Footnote 51: Supplement 14, _Millennial Star,_ 42 and 43.]    [Footnote 52: \"Who Wrote the Book of Mormon?\" 9.]    The following year (1818) Rigdon left the farm and took up his  residence and the study of divinity with the Rev. Andrew Clark at  Sharon, Beaver County, Pa., [53] where, in March, 1819, he was licensed  as a Baptist. [54] I am informed by Sidney Rigdon's son that in 1818  his father made a lengthy visit to Pittsburg. In May, 1819, Rigdon  moved to Warren, Trumbull County, O., where, in July, he took up his  residence with the Rev. Adamson Bentley, later of \"Disciple\" fame, [55]  and was here ordained a regular Baptist preacher. [56] While thus  situated Rigdon met, and on June 12, 1820, married Phoebe Brooks, [57]  who was a sister to Mrs. Bently. [58] Rigdon continued his preaching  hereabouts, not appearing to have any regular charge until February,  1822. In November, 1821, he received a call from the First Baptist  Church of Pittsburg, which was accepted, active duties commencing  February, 1822, [59] and according to Joseph Smith ended August, 1824,  at which time Rigdon was expelled for doctrinal error. [60] Another  account fixes the date of his being deposed as October 11, 1823. [61]  Thereupon Rigdon, Alexander Campbell, and Walter Scott organized the  \"Christian Church,\" otherwise known as \"Disciples\"--and, with his  following, Rigdon secured the courthouse in Pittsburg in which to do  his preaching, at the same time working as a journeyman tanner [62] with  his brother-in-law, Mr. Brooks. [63] Mr. Lambdin, through whom Rigdon  is supposed to have secured access to the Spaulding manuscript, and of  whom more shall be written later on, died August 1, 1825, [64] and in  1826 Rigdon returned to Bainbridge, Geauga County, O. [65] Here he soon  met Orson Hyde, who became a student of divinity at Mr. Rigdon's, with  a view, as Hyde says, of entering the ministry. Except for a little  \"Campbellite\" preaching which he did under Rigdon's guidance, Hyde  never appears to have entered any ministry except the Mormon. In 1829  Hyde became a boarder of Rigdon's family, and in 1830 [66] he was almost  miraculously converted to Mormonism, and still later became one of the  first \"Quorum\" of apostles in the Mormon Church. Rigdon died July 14,  1876.
