With sanguine  expectation of this result, I received baptism and the ordinance of  laying on of hands by one who professed to have divine authority; and,  having thus yielded obedience to these ordinances, I was in constant  expectation of the fulfilment of the promise of the reception of the  Holy Ghost.    The manifestation did not immediately follow my baptism, as I had  expected, but, although the time was deferred, when I did receive it,  its realization was more perfect, tangible and miraculous than even my  strongest hopes had led me to anticipate.    Some two or three weeks after I was baptized, one day while engaged in  my studies, I began to reflect upon the fact that I had not obtained  a _knowledge_ of the truth of the work--that I had not realized the  fulfillment of the promise \"he that doeth my will shall know of the  doctrine,\" and I began to feel very uneasy. I laid aside my books, left  the house, and wandered around through the fields under the oppressive  influence of a gloomy, disconsolate spirit, while an indescribable  cloud of darkness seemed to envelop me. I had been accustomed, at the  close of the day, to retire for secret prayer, to a grove a short  distance from my lodgings, but at this time I felt no inclination to do  so. The spirit of prayer had departed and the heavens seemed like brass  over my head. At length, realizing that the usual time had come for  secret prayer, I concluded I would not forego my evening service, and,  as a matter of formality, knelt as I was in the habit of doing, and in  my accustomed retired place, but not feeling as I was wont to feel.    I had no sooner opened my lips in an effort to pray, than I heard a  sound, just above my head, like the rustling of silken robes, and  immediately the Spirit of God descended upon me, completely enveloping  my whole person, filling me, from the crown of my head to the soles  of my feet, and O, the joy and happiness I felt! No language can  describe the almost instantaneous transition from a dense cloud of  mental and spiritual darkness into a refulgence of light and knowledge,  as it was at that time imparted to my understanding. I then received  a perfect knowledge that God lives, that Jesus Christ is the Son of  God, and of the restoration of the holy Priesthood, and the fulness  of the Gospel. It was a complete baptism--a tangible immersion in the  heavenly principle or element, the Holy Ghost; and even more real and  physical in its effects upon every part of my system than the immersion  by water; dispelling forever, so long as reason and memory last, all  possibility of doubt or fear in relation to the fact handed down to us  historically, that the \"Babe of Bethlehem\" is truly the Son of God;  also the fact that He is now being revealed to the children of men,  and communicating knowledge, the same as in the Apostolic times. I was  perfectly satisfied, as well I might be, for my expectations were more  than realized, I think I may safely say in an infinite degree.    I cannot tell how long I remained in the full flow of the blissful  enjoyment and divine enlightenment, but it was several minutes before  the celestial element which filled and surrounded me began gradually to  withdraw. On arising from my kneeling posture, with my heart swelling  with gratitude to God, beyond the power of expression, I felt--I  _knew_ that He had conferred on me what only an omnipotent being  can confer--that which is of greater value than all the wealth and  honors worlds can bestow. That night, as I retired to rest, the same  wonderful manifestations were repeated, and continued to be for several  successive nights. The sweet remembrance of those glorious experiences,  from that time to the present, bring them fresh before me, imparting an  inspiring influence which pervades my whole being, and I trust will to  the close of my earthly existence.

Being present at a \"Blessing Meeting,\" in the Temple, previous to  his baptism into the Church; after listening to several patriarchal  blessings pronounced upon the heads of different individuals with  whose history he was acquainted, and of whom he knew the Patriarch  was entirely ignorant; he was struck with astonishment to hear the  peculiarities of those persons positively and plainly referred to in  their blessings. And, as he afterwards expressed, he was convinced that  an influence, superior to human prescience, dictated the words of the  one who officiated.    The Patriarch was the father of Joseph, the Prophet. That was the first  time Lorenzo had met him. After the services, they were introduced, and  Father Smith said to my brother that he would soon be convinced of the  truth of the latter-day work, and be baptized; and he said: \"You will  become as great as you can possibly wish--EVEN AS GREAT AS GOD, and you  cannot wish to be greater.\"    Unenlightened as his mind was at the time, the foregoing saying of the  Patriarch was a puzzle which my brother could not comprehend, as will  be seen by the following expression from his journal:    The old gentleman's prediction, that I should ere long be baptized,  was strange to me, for I had not cherished a thought of becoming a  member of the \"Mormon\" Church; but when he uttered the last clause, I  was confounded. That, to me, was a big saying, and, I then thought,  approaching almost to blasphemy. And why not? After years of study  and diligent search after knowledge, in that which most intimately  concerned me--\"From whence came I?\" \"Why am I here?\" \"What is my future  destiny?\" In all this, I was profoundly ignorant. As yet I had received  no key that could unlock those mysteries--that could make known, to my  satisfaction, my relationship to Him who controls the universe.    I looked at Father Smith, and silently asked myself the question: Can  that man be a deceiver? His every appearance answered in the negative.  At first sight, his presence impressed me with feelings of love and  reverence. I had never seen age so prepossessing. Father Joseph Smith,  the Patriarch, was indeed a noble specimen of aged manhood.    But with all my favorable impressions of the Patriarch, that _big  saying_ was a dark parable. The prediction that I should soon be  baptized was fulfilled in two weeks from the time it was spoken, and  in about four years from that time I was reminded of the foregoing  prediction by a very wonderful revelation on the subject in which the  principle, as well as the promise, was made clear to my understanding  as the sun at noonday.    My brother spent most of the winter of 1837-8 in Kirtland, where he  witnessed many marvelous manifestations of the power of God; also  exhibitions of the power and opposition of the adversary. During the  time he became intimately acquainted with Joseph Smith, the Prophet,  and with his father, the Patriarch--with the Twelve Apostles and  other leading men in the Church. In his journal he speaks of the fast  meetings, prayer and testimony meetings in the Temple, as follows:    There we had the gift of prophecy--the gift of tongues--the  interpretation of tongues--visions and marvelous dreams were  related--the singing of heavenly choirs was heard, and wonderful  manifestations of the healing power, through the administrations of  the Elders, were witnessed. The sick were healed--the deaf made to  hear--the blind to see and the lame to walk, in very many instances. It  was plainly manifest that a sacred and divine influence--a spiritual  atmosphere pervaded that holy edifice. Yes, indeed, for the Son of God,  in His glory, had honored it with His royal presence. His voice, like  the sound of many waters, was heard, saying:    _I am the first and the last, I am he who liveth, I am he that was  slain, I am your advocate with the Father. * * * Let the hearts of your  brethren rejoice, and let the hearts of all my people rejoice, who  have, with their might, built this house to my name_.    _For behold, I have accepted this house, and my name shall be here, and  I will manifest myself to my people in mercy in this house_, etc. (See  Doctrine and Covenants.)    No language can describe my feelings when, for the first time, I stood  up in one of those pulpits to address an audience--a pulpit on the  breastwork of which, only a short time before, this holy Personage  stood--\"_his hair as white as pure snow, his eyes as a flame of  fire_\"--where also Moses, Elias and Elijah came and committed the keys  of their dispensations to Joseph Smith. (Here the journal closes for  the present.)    Public meetings were regularly held in the Temple, after its  dedication, on Sundays; and on the first Thursday in each month a  fast meeting, commencing at or before 10 a.m., and closing at 4 p.m.  The Temple was so constructed, that with white canvas curtains, which  could be dropped and raised at pleasure, the lower story was, whenever  occasion required, divided into four sections or apartments. This  was invariably done at those fast meetings. The two sets of pulpits,  one on the east and the other on the west end of the building, were  intersected by the curtain extending from east to west, so as to  leave half their lengths in each apartment, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47730"],[0,"Defense of the Faith and the Saints (Volume 1 of 2) (#6)"],[1,"to pass that I looked and beheld the whore of all      the earth, and she sat upon many waters; and she had dominion over      all the earth, among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people.        48. And it came to pass that I beheld the church of the Lamb of      God, and its numbers were few, because of the wickedness and      abominations of the whore who sat upon many waters; nevertheless,      I beheld that the church of the Lamb, who were the saints of God,      were also upon all the face of the earth; and their dominions upon      the face of the earth were small, because of the wickedness of the      great whore whom I saw.        49. And it came to pass that I beheld that the great mother of      abominations did gather together multitudes upon the face of all      the earth, among all the nations of the Gentiles, to fight against      the Lamb of God.        50. And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the power of the      Lamb of God, that it descended upon the saints of the church of      the Lamb, and upon the covenant people of the Lord, who Were      scattered upon all the face of the earth; and they were armed with      righteousness and with the power of God in great glory.        51. And it came to pass that I beheld that the wrath of God was      poured out upon the great and abominable church, insomuch that      there were wars and rumors of wars among all the nations and      kindreds of the earth, and as there began to be wars and rumors      of wars among all the nations which belonged to the mother of      abominations, the angel spake unto me, saying, Behold, the wrath of      God is upon the mother of harlots; and behold, thou seest all these      things:        17. And when the day cometh that the wrath of God is poured out      upon the mother of harlots, which is the great and abominable      church of all the earth, whose foundation is the devil, then, at      that day, the work of the Father shall commence, in preparing the      way for the fulfilling of his covenants, which he hath made to his      people, who are of the house of Israel.    I understand the injunction to Oliver Cowdery to \"contend against no  church, save it be the church of the devil,\" to mean that he should  contend against evil, against untruth, against all combinations of  wicked men. They constitute the church of the devil, the kingdom  of evil, a federation of unrighteousness; and the servants of God  have a right to contend against that which is evil, let it appear  where it will, in Catholic or in Protestant Christendom, among the  philosophical societies of deists and atheists, and even within  the Church of Christ, if, unhappily, it should make its appearance  there. But, let it be understood, we are not brought necessarily into  antagonism with the various sects of Christianity as such. So far as  they have retained fragments of Christian truth--and each of them has  some measure of truth--that far they are acceptable unto the Lord;  and it would be poor policy for us to contend against them without  discrimination. Wherever we find truth, whether it exists in complete  form or only in fragments, we recognize that truth as part of that  sacred whole of which the Church of Jesus Christ is the custodian;  and I repeat that our relationship to the religious world is not one  that calls for the denunciation of sectarian churches as composing the  church of the devil. All that makes for untruth, for unrighteousness  constitutes the kingdom of evil--the church of the devil. All that  makes for truth, for righteousness, is of God; it constitutes the  kingdom of righteousness--the empire of Jehovah; and, in a certain  sense at least, constitutes the Church of Christ. With the latter--the  kingdom of righteousness--we have no warfare. On the contrary both the  spirit of the Lord's commandments to his servants and the dictates  of right reason would suggest that we seek to enlarge this kingdom  of righteousness both by recognizing such truths as it possesses and  seeking the friendship and co-operation of the righteous men and women  who constitute its membership.    Running parallel with these thoughts, I may be pardoned if I call your  attention to a remark I made in one of these general conferences some  time ago, to the effect that when misrepresentations are made of us,  or of our faith, or when persecution arises against us, it must not  embitter our minds, or make us feel hateful toward our fellowmen, or  lead us to regard the whole world as our enemies. We must keep the  sweetness of our own disposition. The language of the Savior wherein he  says, \"Marvel not if the world hate you: it hated me before it hated  you, if you were of the world, the world would love its own,\" etc., I  contended then and believe now that the truth of that declaration will  be more plainly seen if we read it in this way: \"Marvel not if the  worldly hate you.\" If the ungodly, if those who make and love a lie--if  such classes as these hate you, marvel not; for they were the classes  that hated the Christ and the light and truth that he brought into the  world, because their deeds were evil, and his light and truth were a  reproof to their evil ways. And as we say concerning the \"Kingdom of  Evil,\" so we say with reference to those who hate the truth and make  war upon the righteous, they are not of any one cult, or confined to  any one sect or division of the religious world, but, unhappily, are  found here and there among all classes of people, among all Christian  sects, among all religions and sects of philosophy. We ought to rightly  divide, not only the word of truth, but the wicked and the ungodly from  those who in common with us are seeking to know God and to keep his  commandments. And there are millions who are hungering and thirsting  for that knowledge; and we from time to time shall find them and lead  them into God's temple of truth, where they shall be satisfied at the  feast that the Lord is preparing for all those who hunger and thirst  after righteousness.    The purpose of the Lord in instituting his Church in the earth is very  beautifully set forth in one of the revelations in the D&C, as follows:        \"If this generation harden not their hearts, I will establish my      Church among them. Now I do not say this to destroy my Church, but      I say this to build up my Church. Therefore, whosoever belongeth      to my Church need not fear for such shall inherit the kingdom      of heaven. But it is they who do not fear me, neither keep my      commandments, but build up churches unto themselves to get gain,      yea, all those that do wickedly and build up the kingdom of devil;      yea, verily, verily, I say unto you, that it is they that I will      disturb, and cause to tremble and shake to the center.\"    From this it very clearly appears that the purpose of God in the  introduction of the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times was not to  destroy any truth that existed in the world, but to add to that truth,  to increase it, and to draw together all truth and develop it into a  beautiful system which men may rest contented, knowing God and their  relationship to him, knowing of the future and their relation to that  future.    We should present our message to the world in spirit of peace, charity  and longsuffering; and avoid contention; for as our Book of Mormon  tells us, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of God. I  would the world could understand the unselfishness of our motives in  presenting the gospel of Jesus Christ to them; if they could only know  that our only desire was that they should come to a knowledge of the  great principles of truth that are so comforting to us; that we desire  their repentance and acceptance of the fullness of the truth, only that  they might find favor with God, and share in our hopes of that eternal  life which God, who cannot lie, promised before the world began--if our  fellowmen could be made to understand that this is our only purpose,  it seems to me that many of the barriers that now separate us from  our fellowmen would be broken down, and we would be able to reach the  hearts of the people. I believe that as time passes and we become  wiser in the methods of work we adopt, we will do that more and more,  causing not only hundreds of thousands but millions of our Father's  children to partake of those great blessings that the Gospel has  brought to us. To make known these truths and cause the children of  men to participate in the blessings that we ourselves enjoy, we yearly  send hundreds of our Elders to the various nations of the earth. They  sacrifice the pleasant associations of home, the society of wives and  children, parents and friends; they sacrifice professional advantages  and business opportunities; and sometimes sacrifice health and even  life itself to proclaim to the world the truth which God has made known  to us--enduring the world's reproach and contumely, because the world  does not understand them nor their message; and there is still need,  of the prayer on our part, \"Father, forgive them, they know not what  they do.\" For the benefit of those who have passed away from the earth  without a knowledge of the great truths and saving power of the gospel  of Christ, we rear costly temples, whose spires pierce the skies of our  beloved Utah; and within them at great sacrifice of time and means, the  saints of God assemble to apply the principles and ordinances of the  everlasting gospel to those who have passed away without the privilege  of accepting them while upon the earth. A more completely unselfish  work than this does not exist among men. On every hand the work of God  bears the stamp of unselfishness upon it. Our Book of Mormon says:  \"The laborers in Zion shall labor for Zion; for if they labor for  money, they shall perish.\" So through all the communications of God to  his people shines the glorious"]]]
