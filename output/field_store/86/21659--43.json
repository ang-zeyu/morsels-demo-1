I began this thing, and shall go through with  it. I think, as you do, the cause is lost; but every blow we strike will  find an echo in Italy, and a harvest will grow from the seeds some day.  As to Mazzini and his two companions, I am not surprised. When you stir  up muddy water, the scum will at first rise to the top. So it was in the  first throes of the French Revolution, so it is here; the mob orators,  the schemers, come to power, and there they remain until overthrown by  men of heart and action. After Robespierre and Marat came Napoleon, a  great man whom I acknowledge I admire heartily, enemy though he was of  England; after Mazzini Italy may find her great men. I know you do not  like Cavour; I admire him immensely. He is obliged to be prudent and  cautious now; but when the time comes he will be regarded as the  champion of free Italy; and from what I have heard of him, the young  King Victor Emmanuel will be a sovereign worthy of him.\"    \"I hope it may prove so,\" Garibaldi said shortly; \"at present the  prospect does not seem to me a fair one. And you, professor?\"    \"I shall carry out my plans, and when Rome falls, as fall it doubtless  will, I shall, if I escape, join my wife at Leghorn, and go and  establish myself in England. I have friends and correspondents there,  and I have my son-in-law, who has promised me a home. Here I could not  stay--I am a marked man; and the day that the Pope enters in triumph I  should be consigned to a dungeon under St. Angelo.\"    \"There should be no difficulty in escaping,\" Garibaldi said. \"With  fifteen miles of wall it would need fifty thousand men to surround them;  and the French will want all their strength at the point where they  attack us.\"    It was evident that some time must elapse before there would be any  change in the situation at Rome. Mazzini was sending despatches to Ledru  Rollin and the French Assembly, imploring them to abstain from  interference that would lead to the destruction of the Roman Republic;  and until these could be acted upon, or, on the other hand, fresh troops  arrived from France, matters would be at a standstill. In the meantime,  danger threatened from another quarter; for the King of Naples was  preparing to move with ten thousand men to reinstate the Pope. This  force, with twenty pieces of cannon, had advanced as far as Albano.  Three days after the battle, Garibaldi told Captain Percival that he was  about to start that evening with four thousand men to meet the  Neapolitan army, and asked him to accompany him.    \"The troops will not be warned till an hour before we set out. It is  important that no whisper shall reach the enemy as to our intentions or  strength.\"    \"I shall be glad to go with you,\" the Englishman said. \"After the way  your men fought against the French, I have no doubt that they will make  short work of the Neapolitans, however great the odds against them.  Bomba is hated by his own subjects; and it is hardly likely that they  will fight with any zeal in his cause. They are very different foes from  the French.\"    Accordingly, at eight o'clock on the evening of May 4th, Captain  Percival mounted and joined Garibaldi and his staff, and they rode to  Tivoli, halting among the ruins of Adrian's Villa.    The next morning scouts were sent off towards Albano, and returned in  the evening with the news that the Neapolitans were still there, and  showed no signs of any intention to advance, the news of the defeat of  the French having, no doubt, greatly quenched King Ferdinand's ardour.    On the 8th the Garibaldians moved to Palestrina, and the general  despatched a body of men to drive back the scattered parties of  Neapolitans who were raiding the country. This was done with little  loss, the Neapolitans in all cases retiring hastily when approached.  Garibaldi had information that evening that orders had been given for  the main body of the enemy to advance and attack him on the following  day. The information proved correct; and before noon the Neapolitan  force was seen approaching, seven thousand strong. Garibaldi had no  cannon with him, having set out in the lightest marching order. He  distributed a portion of his force as skirmishers, keeping the rest in  hand for the decisive moment. The Neapolitan artillery opened fire, and  the main body advanced in good order; but as soon as a heavy fire was  opened by the skirmishers, much confusion was observed in their ranks.  Two other parties were at once sent out; and these, taking every  advantage of cover, soon joined in the fray, opening a galling fire upon  each flank.    Several times the Neapolitans attempted to advance, urged on by their  officers; but the skirmishing line in their front was strengthened from  the reserves whenever they did so, until the whole of the Garibaldians,  with the exception of a thousand of the steadiest troops, were engaged,  and an incessant fire was maintained against the heavy ranks of the  enemy, whose artillery produced but little effect against their almost  unseen foes. For three hours the conflict continued; then, as the  Garibaldian reserve advanced, the confusion among the enemy reached a  point at which it could no longer be controlled, and Ferdinand's army  fled like a flock of sheep. Garibaldi and his staff had exposed  themselves recklessly during the fight, riding about among their troops,  encouraging them, and warning them not to be carried away by their  impetuosity into making an attack, until the enemy were thoroughly  shaken and the orders issued for a general charge.    A heavy fire was maintained upon the staff by the Neapolitans; and it  seemed to them that Garibaldi had a charmed life, for although several  of the staff fell, he continued to ride up and down as if altogether  oblivious of the rain of bullets. He did not, however, escape unscathed,  being wounded both in the hand and foot. The fugitives did not halt  until they had crossed the frontier into Neapolitan territory. The  Garibaldians remained for two or three days at Palestrina; and seeing  that the Neapolitans showed no signs of an intention to advance again,  returned by a rapid march to Rome.    Mazzini's efforts had been to some extent successful. The French  Assembly declared that for France to aid in suppressing a people  determined to obtain their freedom was altogether in contradiction with  the condition on which the republic had been instituted, and sent M. de  Lesseps as an envoy to Rome. Napoleon, however, was of opinion that the  reverse to the French arms must be wiped out, and on his own authority  despatched large reinforcements to Oudinot.    To the indignation of Garibaldi's friends and of the greater part of the  population of Rome, it was found, on the return of the force to the  capital, that, in spite of the brilliant successes that had been gained,  Mazzini and the demagogues had superseded him in his command, and had  appointed Colonel Roselli over his head. This step was the result of  their jealousy of the popularity that Garibaldi had gained. His friends  advised him not to submit to so extraordinary a slight; but the general  simply replied that a question of this kind had never troubled him, and  that he was ready to serve, even as a common soldier, under any one who  would give him a chance of fighting the enemy of his country. On the  14th the Neapolitan army again advanced and occupied Palestrina; and the  Roman army, now ten thousand strong, marched out on the 16th. Garibaldi,  with two thousand men, moved in advance. Although Roselli was nominally  in command of the army, he was conscious of Garibaldi's greater  abilities, and deferred, on all points, to the opinion of the man who  was regarded by all as being still their Commander-in-chief.    When within two miles of Velletri Garibaldi met a strong column of  Neapolitans; these, however, after but a slight resistance, took to  flight, and shut themselves up in the town. Garibaldi sent back for  reinforcements, but none arrived until too late in the day for the  attack to be made; and in the morning it was found that the enemy had  evacuated the place, the soldiers being so cowed by their superstitious  fear of Garibaldi that the officers in vain attempted to rally them, and  they fled in a disorderly mob. The panic reached the other portion of  the army, and before morning the whole had again crossed the frontier.  Garibaldi, at the head of his division, followed them up; and receiving  authority to carry the war into the enemy's country, was marching upon  Naples, when he was recalled in all haste to aid in the defence of Rome,  Oudinot having given notice, in spite of a treaty agreed upon between M.  de Lesseps, on the part of the French Assembly, and Mazzini, that he  would attack Rome on Monday, June 4th.    Oudinot was, however, guilty of an act of gross treachery, for, relying  upon his intimation, the city was lulled into a sense of security that  no attack would be made until the day named, whereas before daybreak on  the 3rd his troops stole up and took possession of the buildings just  outside the gate of San Pancrazio, and, before the Roman troops could  assemble, captured the Porta Molle, after a desperate resistance by a  few men who had gathered together on the alarm being given. The firing  was the first intimation that Rome received of the treacherous  manoeuvre of Oudinot. Again the church bells pealed out, and the  populace rushed to defend their walls. Garibaldi felt that the  occupation by the enemy of two great villas, a short distance from the  wall, would enable them to place their batteries in such close proximity  to the San Pancrazio gate that it was necessary at all hazards to  recapture them; and, with his brave Lombard"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4558"],[0,"Barry Lyndon (#6)"],[1,"in secret. Mr. Mick came  to and fro from the regiment, and brought numerous of his comrades with  him. Their costume and swaggering airs filled me with grief, and Miss  Nora's unvarying attentions to them served to make me half wild. No one,  however, thought of attributing this sadness to the young lady's  score, but rather to my disappointment at not being allowed to join the  military profession.    Once the officers of the Fencibles gave a grand ball at Kilwangan, to  which, as a matter of course, all the ladies of Castle Brady (and a  pretty ugly coachful they were) were invited. I knew to what tortures  the odious little flirt of a Nora would put me with her eternal  coquetries with the officers, and refused for a long time to be one of  the party to the ball. But she had a way of conquering me, against which  all resistance of mine was in vain. She vowed that riding in a coach  always made her ill. 'And how can I go to the ball,' said she, 'unless  you take me on Daisy behind you on the pillion?' Daisy was a good  blood-mare of my uncle's, and to such a proposition I could not for my  soul say no; so we rode in safety to Kilwangan, and I felt myself as  proud as any prince when she promised to dance a country-dance with me.    When the dance was ended, the little ungrateful flirt informed me that  she had quite forgotten her engagement; she had actually danced the set  with an Englishman! I have endured torments in my life, but none like  that. She tried to make up for her neglect, but I would not. Some of the  prettiest girls there offered to console me, for I was the best dancer  in the room. I made one attempt, but was too wretched to continue, and  so remained alone all night in a state of agony. I would have played,  but I had no money; only the gold piece that my mother bade me always  keep in my purse as a gentleman should. I did not care for drink, or  know the dreadful comfort of it in those days; but I thought of killing  myself and Nora, and most certainly of making away with Captain Quin!    At last, and at morning, the ball was over. The rest of our ladies went  off in the lumbering creaking old coach; Daisy was brought out, and Miss  Nora took her place behind me, which I let her do without a word. But we  were not half-a-mile out of town when she began to try with her coaxing  and blandishments to dissipate my ill-humour.    'Sure it's a bitter night, Redmond dear, and you'll catch cold without a  handkerchief to your neck.' To this sympathetic remark from the pillion,  the saddle made no reply.    'Did you and Miss Clancy have a pleasant evening, Redmond? You were  together, I saw, all night.' To this the saddle only replied by grinding  his teeth, and giving a lash to Daisy.    'O mercy! you'll make Daisy rear and throw me, you careless creature  you: and you know, Redmond, I'm so timid.' The pillion had by this  got her arm round the saddle's waist, and perhaps gave it the gentlest  squeeze in the world.    'I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do!' answers the saddle; 'and I only  danced with her because--because--the person with whom I intended to  dance chose to be engaged the whole night.'    'Sure there were my sisters,' said the pillion, now laughing outright in  the pride of her conscious superiority; 'and for me, my dear, I had  not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single  set.'    'Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Quin?' said I; and  oh! strange delicious charm of coquetry, I do believe Miss Nora Brady  at twenty-three years of age felt a pang of delight in thinking that she  had so much power over a guileless lad of fifteen. Of course she replied  that she did not care a fig for Captain Quin: that he danced prettily,  to be sure, and was a pleasant rattle of a man; that he looked well in  his regimentals too; and if he chose to ask her to dance, how could she  refuse him?    'But you refused me, Nora.'    'Oh! I can dance with you any day,' answered Miss Nora, with a toss  of her head; 'and to dance with your cousin at a ball, looks as if you  could find no other partner. Besides,' said Nora--and this was a  cruel, unkind cut, which showed what a power she had over me, and how  mercilessly she used it,--'besides, Redmond, Captain Quin's a man and  you are only a boy!'    'If ever I meet him again,' I roared out with an oath, 'you shall see  which is the best man of the two. I'll fight him with sword or with  pistol, captain as he is. A man indeed! I'll fight any man--every man!  Didn't I stand up to Mick Brady when I was eleven years old?--Didn't I  beat Tom Sullivan, the great hulking brute, who is nineteen?--Didn't I  do for the Scotch usher? O Nora, it's cruel of you to sneer at me so!'    But Nora was in the sneering mood that night, and pursued her sarcasms;  she pointed out that Captain Quin was already known as a valiant  soldier, famous as a man of fashion in London, and that it was mighty  well of Redmond to talk and boast of beating ushers and farmers' boys,  but to fight an Englishman was a very different matter.    Then she fell to talk of the invasion, and of military matters  in general; of King Frederick (who was called, in those days, the  Protestant hero), of Monsieur Thurot and his fleet, of Monsieur Conflans  and his squadron, of Minorca, how it was attacked, and where it was; we  both agreed it must be in America, and hoped the French might be soundly  beaten there.    I sighed after a while (for I was beginning to melt), and said how much  I longed to be a soldier; on which Nora recurred to her infallible 'Ah!  now, would you leave me, then? But, sure, you're not big enough for  anything more than a little drummer.' To which I replied, by swearing  that a soldier I would be, and a general too.    As we were chattering in this silly way, we came to a place that has  ever since gone by the name of Redmond's Leap Bridge. It was an old high  bridge, over a stream sufficiently deep and rocky, and as the mare Daisy  with her double load was crossing this bridge, Miss Nora, giving a loose  to her imagination, and still harping on the military theme (I would lay  a wager that she was thinking of Captain Quin)--Miss Nora said, 'Suppose  now, Redmond, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge, and  the inimy on the other side?'    'I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.'    'What, with me on the pillion? Would you kill poor me?' (This young lady  was perpetually speaking of 'poor me!')    'Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do. I'd jump Daisy into the river,  and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.'    'Jump twenty feet! you wouldn't dare to do any such thing on Daisy.  There's the Captain's horse, Black George, I've heard say that Captain  Qui--'    She never finished the word, for, maddened by the continual recurrence  of that odious monosyllable, I shouted to her to 'hold tight by my  waist,' and, giving Daisy the spur, in a minute sprang with Nora over  the parapet into the deep water below. I don't know why, now--whether  it was I wanted to drown myself and Nora, or to perform an act that  even Captain Quin should crane at, or whether I fancied that the enemy  actually was in front of us, I can't tell now; but over I went. The  horse sank over his head, the girl screamed as she sank and screamed as  she rose, and I landed her, half fainting, on the shore, where we were  soon found by my uncle's people, who returned on hearing the screams. I  went home, and was ill speedily of a fever, which kept me to my bed for  six weeks; and I quitted my couch prodigiously increased in stature,  and, at the same time, still more violently in love than I had been even  before. At the commencement of my illness, Miss Nora had been pretty  constant in her attendance at my bedside, forgetting, for the sake of  me, the quarrel between my mother and her family; which my good mother  was likewise pleased, in the most Christian manner, to forget. And, let  me tell you, it was no small mark of goodness in a woman of her haughty  disposition, who, as a rule, never forgave anybody, for my sake to give  up her hostility to Miss Brady, and to receive her kindly. For, like a  mad boy as I was, it was Nora I was always raving about and asking for;  I would only accept medicines from her hand, and would look rudely and  sulkily upon the good mother, who loved me better than anything else  in the world, and gave up even her favourite habits, and proper and  becoming jealousies, to make me happy.    As I got well, I saw that Nora's visits became daily more rare: 'Why  don't she come?' I would say, peevishly, a dozen times in the day;  in reply to which query, Mrs. Barry would be obliged to make the best  excuses she could find,--such as that Nora had sprained her ankle, or  that they had quarrelled together, or some other answer to soothe me.  And many a time has the good soul left me to go and break her heart in  her own room alone, and come back with a smiling face, so that I should  know nothing of her mortification. Nor, indeed, did I take much pains to  ascertain it: nor should I, I fear, have been very much touched even had  I discovered it; for the commencement of manhood, I think, is the period  of our extremest selfishness. We get such a desire then to take wing  and leave the parent nest, that no tears, entreaties, or feelings  of affection will counter-balance this overpowering longing after  independence. She must have been very sad, that poor mother of  mine--Heaven be good to her!--at that period of my life; and has often  told me since what a pang of the heart it was to her to see all her care  and affection of years forgotten by me in a minute, and for the sake of  a little heartless jilt, who was only playing with me while she could  get no better suitor. For the fact is, that during the last four weeks  of my illness, no other than Captain Quin was staying at Castle Brady,  and making love to "]]]
