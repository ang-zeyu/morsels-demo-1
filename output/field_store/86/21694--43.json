Nora's prediction of rain proved true, for  just as they made their way across the campus the rain began to come  down in torrents, wetting them to the skin, but in no respect dampening  their joy over the fact that this shower had come just in time to save  their High School from further ravage by the flames.          CHAPTER V    NORA BECOMES A PRIZE \"SUGGESTER\"      \"The thing to do is to decide just what we want, and then go ahead with  it.\"    Grace Harlowe energetically addressed her remarks to the members of the  Phi Sigma Tau, who had taken possession of the Harlowe's comfortable  living room.    It was Saturday afternoon, and a special meeting had been called with  the object of discussing the best way to get money for the rebuilding of  the gymnasium, that the fire had completely destroyed, although the  splendid efforts of the firemen had prevented the flames from extending  to the main buildings, and the rain had completed their good work.    Grace had allowed no grass to grow under her feet, but had gone to the  root of the matter the day following the fire, and found that the school  could expect no assistance from the city or the state that year. She had  thereupon racked her usually fertile brain for money-making schemes, but  so far had settled on nothing, so she had called in her friends, and the  Phi Sigma Tau had been in council for the past half hour without having  advanced a single prolific idea.    \"Think hard, girls,\" begged Grace. \"We simply must do something that  will make Oakdale sit up and take notice, and incidentally spend their  money.\"    \"We might give a play or a concert,\" suggested Eva Allen.    \"Not original enough to draw the crowd,\" vetoed Nora O'Malley. \"Besides,  the sophomore class has already begun to make plans for a play. While  the other three classes are making plans we ought to go ahead and  astonish the natives. The early stunt catches the cash, you know,\"  concluded Nora slangily.    \"Well, what would you suggest as a cash-catching stunt?\" asked Anne.  \"You are generally a prize suggester.\"    \"We might have a bazaar,\" said Nora after a moment's thought, \"with ever  so many different booths. We could have a gypsy camp, and tell fortunes,  and we could have some Spanish dancers, and, oh, lots of things. We  could have it in Assembly Hall and have tents with all these shows going  on.\"    \"Oh, splendid!\" cried Grace. \"And we could get the High School mandolin  club for an orchestra. If we hurried we could have it week after next,  on Thanksgiving night.\"    \"And we could have a Mystery Auction,\" interposed Marian Barber eagerly.    \"What on earth is a 'Mystery Auction'?\" inquired Nora and Jessica in a  breath.    \"Why we write notes to every one in Oakdale, asking for some kind of  contribution, anything from a jar of pickles to hand-painted china. Then  all these things are tied up in packages and auctioned off to the  highest bidder. There is a whole lot of money in it, for people often  try to outbid each other, and the fun of the thing is that no one knows  what he or she is bidding on.\"    \"Marian Barber,\" exclaimed Grace, \"that's a positive inspiration! You  clever, clever girl!\"    \"Oh, don't think for a minute that I originated the idea,\" said Marian  hastily. \"A cousin of mine wrote me about it last winter. They had a  'Mystery Auction' at a bazaar that was held in the town she lives.\"    \"Well it's a brilliant idea at any rate, and I can see us fairly coining  money. Now we must all work with a will and put the affair through in  fine style,\" responded Grace warmly.    \"Oh, girls, the boys will be at home in time for it!\" exclaimed Jessica  in rapture.    \"Sure enough,\" said Nora, \"and won't I make Hippy work. He'll lose  pounds before his vacation is over. Grace, you must write and ask Tom  Gray to come.\"    Now that the question of the bazaar was settled, the Phi Sigma Tau went  to work with a will. The services of the majority of the seniors were  enlisted and notes were written to every one in Oakdale who was likely  to feel even a faint interest in the movement. Eva Allen's brother, who  was an artist, made a number of attractive posters and these were tacked  up in public places where they at once attracted attention.    The Oakdale National Guard loaned tents, and public-spirited merchants  willingly loaned draperies, flags, banners, and in fact, almost anything  they were asked for.    As for donations, they fairly poured in, and the girls watched the  growing collection with mingled rapture and despair.    \"We'll have to sit up every night this week in order to get all these  things wrapped,\" sighed Grace, on the Monday afternoon before  Thanksgiving, as she stood resting after a spirited rehearsal of the  dance that she and Miriam Nesbit were to do, and which was to be one of  the features of the gypsy camp.    \"And the decorating is only about half done, too,\" she continued. \"Thank  goodness school closed to-day. We'll just have to live here until  Thursday, and work, work, work.\"    \"'Clear the way for progress on the fly,'\" sang out a voice behind them,  and the group of startled girls turned to face a stout young man who  charged into their midst with a hop, skip and a jump.    \"Hippy!\" shrieked Nora in delight. \"And David and Reddy, and yes--Tom,  too!\"    \"'Oh, frabjous day, calloooh, callay,'\" cried Hippy shaking hands all  around. \"It seems ages since I saw you girls. How well you all look,  only you're not looking at me. These other good-for-nothing fellows are  getting all the attention. Hello, Miriam,\" he called to Miriam Nesbit,  who ran eagerly across the floor to meet the newcomers. \"There's a prize  package for you, too. It's outside the door shaking the snow off its  coat.\"    Miriam flushed and laughed a little, then hurried over to greet Arnold  Evans, who had just entered the hall.    \"Oh, boys, you don't know how good it seems to have you all here again,\"  said Grace, after the first greetings had been exchanged, as she beamed  on the young men. \"You're just in time to go to work, too. We've oodles  of things to wrap for the 'Mystery Auction,' and Hippy you must be  auctioneer. You can do it to perfection.\"    \"Tell us all about this affair. I received rather indefinite accounts of  it in the exceedingly brief letters that I have been favored with of  late,\" said Tom Gray, fixing a reproachful eye upon Grace.    \"Please forgive me, Tom,\" begged Grace, \"but really I've been so busy of  late that I just had to cut my letters short. Come on around the hall  with me, and I'll tell you about all the stunts we've planned. Come on,  everybody,\" she called, turning to the young people grouped about, \"and  remember, that I expect some original suggestions from you boys.\"    Around the hall they went, stopping before each tent, while the girls  explained its purpose.    \"What's this to be?\" asked Tom, as he stopped at one corner of the hall  that was closely curtained. \"May I enter?\"    \"Mercy, no,\" gasped Grace, catching him by the arm as he was about to  move aside one of the heavy curtains. \"That's Eleanor Savelli's own  particular corner. None of us know what is behind those curtains. You  see, Eleanor hasn't spoken to any of us since last year. When we first  talked about having this bazaar we decided to make it a senior class  affair. We didn't care to go to Eleanor and ask her to help, because she  hasn't been nice to any of the Phi Sigma Tau, but we asked Miss Tebbs  and Miss Kane, two of the teachers who are helping with this, to ask  Eleanor to do something. You know she plays so well, both on the violin  and piano, then, too, the greater part of her life has been spent  abroad, so she surely must have lots of good ideas.    \"When first Miss Tebbs asked her she refused to have anything to do with  it. Then she suddenly changed her mind and has been working like a  beaver ever since. Miss Tebbs says her booth is beautiful.\"    \"If I'm not mistaken here she comes now,\" said Tom suddenly. \"I never  saw her but once before, yet hers is a face not easily forgotten.\"    \"Yes, it is she,\" replied Grace. \"Let us walk on.\"    Eleanor Savelli, gowned in a tailored suit of blue and looking  particularly beautiful, walked haughtily by and disappeared behind the  heavy green curtain.    \"She is certainly a stunning girl!\" was Tom's low-voiced exclamation,  \"but, oh, what a look she gave you, Grace!\"    \"Did she?\" replied Grace, with an amused smile. \"That doesn't worry me.  She has repeated that performance so often that I have grown used to  it.\"    \"Look out for her just the same,\" advised Tom.    \"Where do we jollificate, to-night?\" asked Hippy, as Grace and Tom  joined them again.    \"Right here,\" said Nora with decision. \"No fudge, no hot chocolate, no  cakes, nothing except work until this bazaar is over, then we'll have a  spread that will give you indigestion for a week. Do you solemnly  promise to be good and not tease for things to eat, but be a ready and  willing little toiler?\"    \"I do,\" said Hippy, holding up his right hand. \"Do you assure me that  the spread you just mentioned is no myth?\"    \"I do,\" said Nora, \"also that the indigestion, shall be equally  realistic.\"    \"Lead me to it,\" said Hippy. \"I swear in this hour that--\"    But Hippy never finished his speech, for Eleanor Savelli suddenly darted  into the group with flashing eyes and set lips.    \"How dared you meddle with my booth during my absence!\" she cried,  looking from one to the other of the astonished young people. \"And what  have you done with my things!\"    There was a brief silence. Then Nora O'Malley spoke very coolly.    \"Really, Miss Savelli, we haven't the remotest idea of what you are  speaking.\"    \"You know perfectly well of what I am speaking,\" retorted Eleanor. \"I  might have expected as much, however.\"    \"I repeat,\" said Nora firmly, \"that we do not know what you mean, and I  am not used to having my word questioned."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49507"],[0,"Siegfried & The Twilight of the Gods (#6)"],[1,"ing, shall hold it.      More wouldst thou learn,      There Fafner lies,  Who, if warned of his death,  Gladly would give up the toy.  Come, I will wake him for thee.            [_He goes towards the cave, and, standing on the          rising ground in front of it, calls towards it._        Fafner! Fafner!      Wake, dragon! Wake!      ALBERICH [_With anxious amazement, aside._    Does the madman mean it?  Am I to have it?    FAFNER'S VOICE    Who troubles my sleep?    WANDERER [_Facing the cave._        A well-wisher comes      To warn thee of danger;  Thy doom can be averted,  If thou wilt pay the price  With the treasure that thou guardest.            [_He leans his ear towards the cave, listening._    FAFNER'S VOICE        What would he?    ALBERICH            [_Has come to the Wanderer and calls into the cave._        Waken, Fafner!      Dragon, awake!  A doughty hero comes  To try his strength against thine.    FAFNER'S VOICE        I want a meal.    WANDERER    Bold is the boy and strong; Sharp-edged is his sword.    ALBERICH        The ring he seeks,      Nothing besides.  Give me the ring, and so      The strife shall be stayed.      Still guarding the hoard,  In peace shalt thou live long!    FAFNER [_Yawning._        I have and I hold:--      Let me slumber!    WANDERER            [_Laughs aloud and then turns again to Alberich._    Well, Alberich! That ruse failed,  But call me rogue no more.      This one thing thou shouldst      Never forget:  Each according to his kind must act;  Nothing can change him.      I leave thee the field now;      Show a bold front,  And try thy luck with thy brother;  Thou knowest his kind perhaps better.      And things unknown      Thou also shalt learn!            [_He turns away, and disappears quickly in the          wood. A storm arises and a bright light breaks          forth; then both quickly cease._    ALBERICH            [_Looks after the Wanderer as he gallops off._        Away on his shining      Horse he rides,  And leaves me to care and scorn!      Laugh on! Laugh on,      Ye light-minded      And high-spirited      Race of immortals!      One day ye shall perish      And pass!      Until the gold      Has ceased to gleam,      Will wise Alberich watch,      And his hate shall prevail.            [_He slips into the chasm at the side. The stage          remains empty. Dawn._      _As the day dawns Siegfried and Mime enter. Siegfried carries his sword  in a sword-belt of rope. Mime examines the place carefully. At last  he looks towards the background, which remains in deep shadow, whilst  the rising ground in the middle becomes, after a time, more and more  brightly illuminated by the sun._    MIME        Our journey ends here;      Here we halt.    SIEGFRIED            [_Sits down under the lime-tree and looks about          him._    So here I shall learn what fear is?  A far way thou hast led me;  We have wandered lone together  A whole night long in the woods.      This is the last      Of thee, Mime!      Can I not master      My lesson here,  Alone I will push forward  And never see thee again.    MIME        Lad, believe me,      If thou canst not  Learn it here and now,      No other place,      No other time  Ever will teach thee fear.      Dost thou see  That cavern yawning dark?      Yonder dwells  A dragon dread and grim,      Horribly fierce,      Enormous in size,      With terrible jaws      That threaten and gape;      With skin and hair,      All at a gulp,  The brute could swallow thee whole.    SIEGFRIED            [_Still sitting under the lime-tree._    'Twere well to close up his gullet;  His fangs I will therefore avoid.    MIME        Poison pours      From his venomous mouth;      Were he to spue out      Spittle on thee,  Thy body and bones would decay.    SIEGFRIED    That the poison may not consume me,  I will keep out of its reach.    MIME        A serpent's tail      Sweeping he swings;      Were that about thee wound      And folded close,  Thy limbs would be broken like glass.    SIEGFRIED    That his swinging tail may not touch me,  Warily then I must watch.      But answer me this:      Has the brute a heart?    MIME    A pitiless, cruel heart.    SIEGFRIED        It lies, however,      Where all hearts lie,  Brute and human alike?    MIME        Of course! There, boy,      The dragon's lies too.  At last thou beginnest to fear?    SIEGFRIED            [_Who till now has been lying indolently stretched          out, sits up suddenly._        Nothung into      His heart I will thrust!  Is that what is meant by fearing?      Hey, old dotard!      Canst thou teach me      Nothing but this      With all thy craft,  Linger no longer by me:  No fear is here to be learnt.    MIME        Wait awhile yet!      What I have told thee  Seems to thee empty sound;      When thou hast heard      And seen him thyself,  Thy senses will swoon, overwhelmed!      When thine eyes grow dim,      And when the ground rocks,      When in thy breast      Thy heart beats loud,            [_Very friendly._    Thou wilt remember who brought thee,  And think of me and my love.    SIEGFRIED        Thy love is not wanted!      Hast thou not heard?      Out of my sight with thee;      Let me alone!  Begin again talking of love,  And on the instant I go!      The horrible winking,      The nods and blinking--      When shall I see      The last of them,  And rid be at length of the fool?    MIME        Well, I will off,  And rest there by the spring.      Thou must stay here,  And as the sun scales the sky      Watch for the foe:      From his cave      He lumbers this way,      Winds and twists      Past this spot,  To water at the fountain.    SIEGFRIED [_Laughs._    Liest thou by the spring,  Unchecked thither the brute shall go;      He shall swallow thee      Down with the water,      Ere with my sword      To the heart I stab him!  So heed well what I say:  Rest not beside the spring.      Seek somewhere else      A far-off spot,  And nevermore return.    MIME        Thou wilt not refuse      Cooling refreshment  When the fierce fight is over?            [_Siegfried motions him angrily away._        Call on me too      Shouldst thou need counsel,            [_Siegfried repeats the gesture with more violence._    Or if felled on a sudden by fear.            [_Siegfried rises and drives him away with furious          gestures._    MIME [_Aside, as he goes away._        Fafner and Siegfried--      Siegfried and Fafner--  Might each the other but slay!            [_He disappears in the wood on the right._    SIEGFRIED            [_Stretches himself at his ease under the          lime-tree, and looks after Mime as he departs._    He is no father of mine!  How merry of heart I feel!      Never before      Seemed the forest fair;      Never day      Wore as lovely a smile,  For the loathed one has gone at last,  To be looked on by me no more.            [_He meditates in silence._    My father--what was he like?--  Ha! like me, without doubt.  Had Mime by chance had a son,      He would have been      Mime's image:      Quite as disgusting,      Filthy and grey,      Small and bent,      Hunchbacked and halting,      With ears long and hanging,      Rheumy eyes running--      Off with the fright!  To see him makes me sick!            [_He leans further back and looks up through the          branches of the tree. Deep silence. Woodland          murmurs._        What could my mother,      I wonder, be like;      That is not      So easy to picture.            [_Very tenderly._    Her clear shining eyes      Must have been soft,  And gentle like the roe-deer's,      Only far fairer.            [_Very softly._    In fear and woe she bore me,  But why did she die through me?  Must then all human mothers      Thus die on giving      Birth to a son?  That would truly be sad!      Ah, if I only      Could see my mother!--      See my mother,      A woman once!            [_He sighs softly, and leans still further back.          Deep silence. Louder murmuring of the wood. His          attention is at last caught by the song of the          birds. He listens with growing interest to one          singing in the branches above him._        O lovely warbler,      I know not thy note;  Hast thou thy home in this wood?  If I could but understand him,  His sweet song might say much--  Perhaps of my mother tell me.      A surly old dwarf      Said to me once      That men might learn      To follow the sense  Of birds when they were singing;  Could it indeed be done?      Ha! I will sing      After him,  On the reed follow him sweetly.      Though wanting the words,      Repeating his measure--  Singing what is his language--  Perhaps I shall know what he says.            [_He runs to the neighbouring spring, cuts a reed          off with his sword, and quickly makes himself a          pipe out of it. He listens again._        He stops to hear,      So now for my song!            [_He blows into the pipe, breaks off, and cuts          it again to improve it. He resumes his blowing,          shakes his head, and cuts the pipe once more. After          another attempt he gets angry, presses the pipe          with his hand, and tries again. He ceases playing          and smiles._        That rings not right;      For the lovely tune  The reed is not suited at all.      I fear, sweet bird,      I am too dull;  Thy song cannot I learn.            [_He hears the bird again and looks up to him._        He listens so roguishly      There that he shames me;            [_Very tenderly._    He waits, and nothing rewards him.      Heida! Come hearken      Now to my horn;            [_He flings the pipe away._        All I do sounds wrong      On the stupid reed;      To a song of the woods      That I know,  A merry song, listen now rather.      I hoped it would bring      Some comrade to me,      But wolves and bears      Were the best that came.      Now I will see      Who"]]]
