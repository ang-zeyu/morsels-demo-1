And--\"    \"You needn't be afraid of Lad's doing any of those fool things,\"  bragged the Master. \"He behaves as well as any human. Better than most  of them. He--\"    \"That isn't the point,\" said his host, with growing uneasiness. \"You  see, Daylight Park is run as a club. Home government and all that sort  of thing. Well, these livestock fracases raised such a row that the  club's Board of Governors has passed an ordinance, forbidding the  keeping of any pet animals in the whole park. Nothing bigger than a  canary bird can be harbored here. It's a hard-and-fast rule. It seemed  the only way to save our whole summer colony from disruption. You know  a livestock squabble can cause more ructions in a small community  than--\"    \"I see,\" mused the Master, staring glumly after Lad who was just  vanishing into the house in the wake of the Mistress and the unhappy  Mrs. Harmon. \"I see. H'm!\"    He pondered for an instant, while his host shifted from foot to foot  and looked apologetic. Then the Master spoke again.    \"The only way out, that I see,\" he hazarded, \"is for me to drive back  home with Lad; and leave him there and come on here, tomorrow. I can--\"    \"Nothing of the sort!\" protested Harmon, \"There's an easier way than  that. Wittsville is only a mile or so from the Park gates. They've got  a fine boarding kennel there. Several of the Park's dogs were exiled to  it, when our ordinance went into effect. Jump into the car, and we'll  take your collie there in ten minutes. He'll be well treated. And you  and your wife can go to see him, every day you're here. Come along.  I--I hate to seem inhospitable about this thing. But you see for  yourself how it is. We--\"    \"Certainly,\" assented the Master. \"I'll go in and get him and explain  to my wife. Don't let it make you feel uncomfortable. We both  understand.\"    Which accounts for the fact that Lad, within the next half hour, was  preparing to spend his first night away from home and from the two  people who were his gods. He was not at all happy. It had been an  interesting day. But its conclusion did not please Laddie, in any  manner.    And, when things did not please Lad, he had a very determined fashion  of trying to avoid them;--unless perchance the Mistress or the Master  had decreed otherwise.    The Master had brought him to this obnoxious strange place. But he had  not bidden Lad stay there. And the collie merely waited his chance to  get out. At ten o'clock, one of the kennelmen made the night rounds. He  swung open the door of the little stall in which Lad had been locked  for the night. At least, he swung the door halfway open. Lad swung it  the rest of the way.    With a plunge, the collie charged out through the opening portal,  ducked between the kennelman's legs, reached the open gate of the  enclosure in two more springs; and vanished down the road into the  darkness.    As soon as he felt the highway under his feet, Lad's nose drooped  earthward; and he sniffed with all his might.  Instantly, he caught the  scent he was seeking;--a scent as  familiar to him as that of his own  piano cave; the scent of the Place's car-tires.    It had taken Harmon and the Master the best part of ten minutes to  drive through the park and to the boarding kennels. It took Lad less  than half that time to reach the veranda of the Harmon house. Circling  the house and finding all doors shut, he lay down on the mat; and  settled himself to sleep there in what comfort he might, until the  Mistress and the Master should come down in the morning and find him.    But the Harmons were late risers. And the sun had been up for some  hours before any of the household were astir.    If Lad had been the professionally Faithful Hound, of storybooks, he  would doubtless have waited on the mat until someone should come to let  him in. But, after lying there until broad daylight, he was moved to  explore this new section of the world. The more so, since house after  house within range of his short vision showed signs of life and  activity.    Several people passed and repassed along the private roadway in front  of the Harmons' door; and nearly all of these paused to peer at Lad, in  what seemed to the collie a most flattering show of interest.    At last, the dog got to his feet, stretched himself fore-and-aft, in  true collie fashion; and trotted down the paved walk to the road. There  for a moment, he stood hesitant. As he stood, he was surveying the  scene;--not only with his eyes, but with those far stronger sense  organs, his ears and his nostrils. His ears told him nothing of  interest. His nose told him much. Indeed, before he had fairly reached  the road, these nostrils had telegraphed to his brain an odor that not  only was highly interesting, but totally new to him. Lad's experience  with scents was far-reaching. But this smell lay totally outside all  his knowledge or memory.    It was a rank and queer smell;--not strong enough, out there in the  open, to register in a human-brain; but almost stingingly acute to the  highly sensitized dog. It was an alluring scent; the sort of odor that  roused all his curiosity and seemed to call for prompt investigation.    Nose to ground, Lad set off to trace the smell to its source. Strong as  it was, it grew stronger and fresher at every step. Even a mongrel  puppy could have followed it. Oblivious to all else, Lad broke into a  canter; nose still close to earth; pleasurably excited and keenly  inquisitive.    He ran along the private road for perhaps a hundred yards. Then, he  wheeled in at another paved walk and ran up a low flight of veranda  steps. The front door of a house stood invitingly open to the cool air  of the morning. In through the doorway went Lad; unheeding the gobbling  call of a maid-servant who was sweeping the far end of the veranda.    Lad did not know he was committing trespass. To him an open door had  always meant permission to enter. And the enticingly rank scent was  tenfold stronger indoors than out. Across a hallway he trotted, still  sniffing; and up a flight of stairs leading to the second story of the  house.    At the stairhead, a room door stood wide. And into this room led the  odor. Lad went in. He was in a large and sunlit room; but in the most  disorderly room he had ever set eyes on. The room needed airing, too.  For all its four windows were closed, except one which was open for  perhaps six inches from the top.    Lad circled the room, twice; from door to windows, and thence to center  table and around the walls; pausing at one window sill and again at the  threshold; picking his way daintily over heaps of litter on the floor.  Yes, the room was full of the scent. But, whence the scent emanated,  Lad could not, for the life of him, tell. The room gave him no clew.  And, after a few minutes of futile investigation, he turned to depart.    At the stairhead, he came upon the same servant he had seen sweeping  the veranda. She cried: \"Shoo!\" at him and brandished her broom. Lad,  in offended dignity, stalked past her and out of the house.    His quest having proven vain, he betook himself to the Harmons',  arriving there as the Mistress and the Master emerged upon the veranda  in company with their hosts. In wild delight, Lad scampered up to the  Mistress; his whole stately body wriggling in eager welcome, his tiny  white forepaws patting at her feet, his muzzle thrusting itself into  her cupped hand.    \"Why, Lad!\" she cried. \"Laddie! We were so worried about you. They just  phoned from the kennels that you had gotten away. I might have known  you'd find your way to us. We--\"    She got no further. Up the walk, from the road, came running an  apoplectically red and puffing man of late middle age;--a man whose  face bore traces of lather; and who was swathed in a purple bathrobe.  Flapping slippers ill-covered his sockless feet.    The Master recognized the fast-advancing newcomer. He recognized him  from many pictures in newspapers and magazines.    This was Rutherford Garretse, world-famed author and collector; the  literary lion and chief celebrity of the summer colony at Daylight  Park. But what eccentricity of genius could account for his costume and  for this bellicose method of bearing down upon a neighbor's home, was  more than the Master could guess.    Nor did the visitor's first words clear up the mystery. Halting at the  foot of the steps, Rutherford Garretse gesticulated in dumb anguish,  while he fought for breath and for coherent speech. Then, disregarding  Harmon's wondering greeting, the celebrity burst into choking staccato  speech.    \"That dog!\" he croaked. \"That--that--DOG! The maid saw him go into the  house. Saw him go up to my study. She was afraid to follow, at first.  But in a few minutes she did. She saw him coming out of my study!  COME!!! I demand it. All of you. COME!\"    Without another word, he wheeled and made off down the road, pausing  only to beckon imperiously. Marveling, the group on the veranda  followed. Deaf to their questions, he led the way. Lad fell into line  behind the perplexed Mistress.    Down the road to the next house, stalked Rutherford Garretse. At the  doorway, he repeated his dramatic gesture and commanded:    \"COME!\"    Up the broad stairs he stamped. Behind him trailed the dumfounded  procession; Laddie still pattering happily along with the Mistress. At  the open door of a large room at the stairhead, the author stood aside  and pointed in silent despair through the doorway.    \"What's up?\" queried Harmon, for perhaps the tenth time. \"Is  anything--?\"    His question ended in a grunt. And, like the others, he stared aghast  on the scene before him.    The room, very evidently, was a study. But much of its floor, just now,  was heaped, ankle high, with hundreds of pages of torn and crumpled  paper.    The desk-top and a Sheraton cabinet and table were bare of all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23922"],[0,"Dead Man's Land (#18)"],[1,"ily, and he dragged his blankets  over his head.  \"Hullo!  I say!  There's something the matter;\" and the  boy now rose to his knees.  \"Here, where are the guns?\"    \"I don't know.  Yes, I do,\" cried Mark, feeling about.  \"I have got  one--yes--here's yours.  Let's get to the door.\"    \"No, stop.  Listen!\" and Dean caught his cousin by the arm.  \"It's a  lion.  I'm sure of it.\"    \"So am I,\" cried Mark--\"a dozen of them.  Oh, Dean, Dean!  Hark at the  poor bullocks!  They are pulling them down, and they'll be killing those  ponies.  Here, let go.\"    \"What are you going to do?\"    \"Going outside to shoot.\"    \"No, no; don't do that, or we shall have them springing in here.\"    \"But--\"    \"There, you needn't go now.  There's somebody else shooting.\"  For a  couple of reports came from somewhere in the direction of where the fire  kept burning, and then another, followed by a confused noise of  bellowing oxen, trampling feet, and the deep-toned, barking roar of a  lion, which dominated everything else.    \"Here, Mark,\" cried Dean in a hoarse whisper, clinging to his cousin now  tightly, \"we are attacked by lions.\"    \"Seems like it,\" was the reply.  \"Where are father and the doctor?\"    \"I don't know.  I would say let's shout, only it would be like asking  the savage animals to come.\"    \"But we must do something.  Are you loaded?\"  And as Mark spoke there  was the sound of his raising the cocks of his piece.    \"No.  My hand shakes so.  That's better.  I could hardly do it.  I say,  don't you feel frightened, Mark?\"    \"Horribly.  But look sharp.  Are you ready?  Let's jump out together,  and then fire.\"    \"All right.  Ready now.  I wish I didn't feel in such a shiver.  Here,  I'm ready.  Perhaps it will scare the brutes.\"    \"Hope so,\" said Mark, as he drew aside the folds of the tilt and  crouched by the waggon chest ready to spring.  \"Hooray!  There's  somebody shouting.  Now then; take hold of my hand.  Let's jump  together.\"    There was a double thud, as the boys sprang out into the darkness.    \"Now then--ready?\"    \"Yes,\" cried Dean, firmly now, as soon as he had made his desperate  plunge into danger.    \"Fire!\"    _Bang!  Bang_!    \"Again!\" cried Mark, and directly after there was the repetition of the  reports and the rustling sound of replacing the empty cartridges.    \"Hi, there!\" came in a voice from out of the darkness, sounding distant.  \"Is that you boys?\"    \"Yes, doctor,\" cried Mark.  \"Where's father?\"    \"Here, my boy.  Where's your cousin?\"    \"I'm here, uncle.\"    \"Good.  But you two fellows ought to have stopped in the waggon.\"    Directly after Sir James and the doctor joined them, and a couple more  shots came from a distance, in the direction where the thundering beat  of hoofs was beginning to die away, and then shots again, followed by a  hideous snarling and roaring, as if very near at hand several lions were  quarrelling like angry cats over their prey.    \"Ahoy, there!\" shouted the doctor.    \"Ahoy!\" came from two places in the distance.    \"Rally here,\" cried the doctor, as loud as he could shout.  \"Up here by  the waggon!\"    This was followed by the beating of feet upon the thick grass, and all  the time the trampling of oxen grew more distant, while the savage  snarling went on and was punctuated in the darkness every now and then  by a deep-toned bark.    \"This way,\" cried the doctor.  \"Come on!\"    The boys' hearts beat hard at this, for the doctor's words were answered  by a chorus of snarls from what Mark judged now to be a portion of the  forest not many yards away; and involuntarily the boys raised their  rifles to their shoulders as they glanced to right and left, trying to  make out through the darkness whether the way was clear for a shot.    \"Hadn't we better fire again, father?\"    \"No,\" said the doctor sharply, from close at hand.  \"The men are  rallying, and we may hit somebody.\"    \"Yes,\" said Sir James quickly.    \"And besides,\" continued the doctor, \"if we fire at where that snarling  comes from it will be answered by a rush.  The brutes can see in this  horrid darkness.\"    \"What are they doing?\" asked Dean.    \"They have pulled down a bullock, boys, and they are quarrelling over  it.  Can't you hear?  Oh, this darkness!\" cried the speaker, and he  gave--so the sound indicated--a stamp of one foot.    \"Is the boss there?\" cried a gruff voice.    \"Yes, this way, Denham,\" said the doctor.  \"Mind the lions.\"    \"Oh, I hear them, sir.  Anyone hurt?\"    \"I hope not,\" replied the doctor, as the man came nearer, rustling  through the grass.  \"Where are your men?\"    _Oomph!  Oomph!  Oomph_! came in a deep-toned roar, followed by a chorus  of snarls.    \"Old 'uns and young 'uns,\" said Denham, subduing his voice a little.  \"They don't like our being so near.  I expect my chaps have shinned up  the trees somewhere.  That's what they would do, gentlemen; and old  Brown has used those long legs of his to put him miles away by this  time.\"    \"But have you heard anything of my two men?\" asked Sir James--\"Dance and  Bacon?\"    \"I've 'eard them letting go with their rifles, sir.\"    \"And what about Dan?\"    \"Oh, I haven't heard anything of him, sir.\"    \"Ahoy!\" came in the little sailor's well known voice, from somewhere in  the darkness.    \"Ahoy!\" cried the boys together.    _Roo--oomph_!  _Roo--oomph_!  _Roo--oomph_! issued from the spot that  had now grown familiar.    \"Steady, gentlemen--steady!  All cats have got the savage on strong when  they are at work at their grub.  Wait a bit.  Let's get the others  together, and then we'll give the brutes a volley as near as we can.\"    \"Cooey!  Cooey!\" came out of the darkness.    \"This way!  Here!\" shouted Buck Denham.    _Roo--oomph_!  _Roo--oomph_!  _Roo--oomph_! came now, with a fiercer  roar than ever, which roused the lion's companions to utter a furious  burst of snarls.    \"Cooey!  Cooey!\" came again.    \"All right, mate,\" said the big driver, in a low voice.  \"You must find  your own way now.  That last bit of tongue meant, look out for squalls.\"    \"Anybody hurt?\" came in a well known voice now from close at hand, and  Dan hurried up.    \"I think not, Dan,\" whispered Mark, and then he stretched out his hand  and felt for the little sailor.  \"Are you all right?\"    \"Yes, sir.  I fired off all my cartridges.\"    \"Here's someone else coming, gentlemen,\" said Denham, in a low, deep  tone.  \"They are your two lads, I think.\"    \"Yes,\" cried Dean eagerly.  \"Nobody else would have cried cooey, unless  it was little Dan.\"    \"Yes, I might, but I didn't to-night; I have been too busy.\"    \"That you, Peter.  Where's Bob Bacon?\"    \"Me, Mr Mark, sir?\" said the latter.  \"Here I am, as large as life.  We  have been at it pretty warm.  But I want it to grow light, to see if we  can retrieve any of the game.\"    \"Yah!  Ain't 'it anything,\" growled Buck Denham.    \"But where's Peter?  I heard two cooeys,\" said Mark.    \"Yes; that was me, sir.  I ain't seen him.\"    \"Well, now then, gentlemen,\" said Buck Denham; \"all loaded?\"    \"'Cept me,\" said Dan.    \"Take these.  Here are some cartridges,\" said Sir James.    \"Now then--ready?\" said Denham, quite loudly, and there was another  burst of roars and snarls.  \"Thank ye,\" said Denham; \"that's just let us  know where abouts to fire.  Now, all of you let them have it, as near as  you can guess; and fire low.  I'd kneel down.  I'll just give them a  rouse up with a shout.  That will make them roar again.  Then you,  doctor, give the word, and let 'em have it.\"    \"Right,\" said the doctor.    \"Ready, my lads?\" whispered Buck.    There was a low murmur of assent, and the driver put one hand to his  cheek.  \"Hullo, there, you!\"    _Er_--_rr_--_oomph_! came in a roar, followed by a snarl; and this time  there was a sharp crackling of bushes, as one of the savage beasts made  a bound towards them.    It was all guess work, but the volley fired at the advancing brute was  followed by a roar from several feline throats and a struggling plunge  and trampling amidst the undergrowth, with a fiercer snarling than ever.    \"Load again quickly,\" said the doctor, \"and stand firm, my lads.\"    \"Ay, we've got to,\" added Denham.  \"I was in hopes that those shots  would have scared them; but one of them has got it pretty warm.\"  For  the violent kicking and tearing amidst the bushes went on, supplemented  by the snarling and growling of the hidden beasts.    \"How long is it to morning?\" asked the doctor in a whisper.    \"Good two hours, I should say, sir.\"    \"Then we had better retreat to the waggons before the savage brutes take  courage and come on at us.\"    \"They won't attack, sir, as long as they have got that bullock there,  unless we go near.  Now, if we had only got a light we could rouse up  that fire--hullo!\"    For all at once, as if the man's words had been heard, there was a soft  crackling amidst the embers where the fire should have been blazing, and  faintly illuminated by a glow from the earth, the watchers caught sight  of the face of the Illaka, looking strange and ruddy, while as the black  stirred up the ashes with the haft of his spear there was enough life in  them to emit a bluish golden flame which caught the twigs he threw on.  The light cast upon him increased, and in a few minutes he had augmented  the fire by throwing on armfuls of wood, till there was a fierce blaze  which lit up the edge of the forest and made the waggons and their tilts  show up as if of gold.    \"Well done, Mak!\" cried Denham.  \"That will do more than all our  shooting.  More wood--all you can.\"    The black understood him, and as snarl after snarl came from out of the  forest the dry wood blazed up and the growling grew less and less.    \"They're a-sneaking off, sir,\" said the big driver, \"and I think you  might give them another shot or two to hurry them.\"    \"All together,\" said the doctor sharply.  \"Ready!  Fire!\"    The flashes from the mouths of the rifles looked slight in the glow of  the flames,"]]]
