Nature has not designed that a function of great moment to the human  race--one involving its very existence--should be attended with pain.  The presence of pleasure is indicative of health, its absence of  disease. But to a woman who has systematically displaced her womb by  years of imprudence in conduct or dress, this act, which should be a  physiological one, and free from any hurtful tendencies becomes a source  of distress and even of illness. The diseases of the womb which  sometimes follow matrimony are not to be traced to excessive indulgence  in many cases, but to indulgence _to any extent_ by those who have  altered the natural relation of the parts before marriage. A prominent  physician, Prof. T. Gaillard Thomas, of New York, has said that 'upon a  woman who has enfeebled her system by habits of indulgence and luxury,  pressed her uterus entirely out of its normal place, and who perhaps  comes to the nuptial bed with some marked uterine disorder, the result  of imprudence at menstrual epochs, sexual intercourse has a _poisonous_  influence. The taking of food into the stomach exerts no hurtful  influence on the digestive system; but the taking of food by a  dyspeptic, who has abused and injured that organ, does so.'    When excessive pain exists, and every attempt occasions nervous  trepidation and apprehension, it is absolutely certain that there is  some diseased condition present, for which proper advice should be  secured at once. Delay in doing so will not remove the necessity for  medical interference in the end, while it will assuredly aggravate the  trouble. Prompt intelligent aid, on the contrary, is usually followed by  the happiest results in such cases.      STERILITY.    Wives who never become mothers are said to be sterile or barren. This  condition is frequently a cause of much unhappiness. Fortune may favor  the married couple in every other respect, yet if she refuse to accord  the boon of even a single heir to heart and home, her smiles will bear  the aspect of frowns. It is then of some interest to inquire into the  causes of this condition, and how to prevent or remedy their operation.    Dr. Duncan, of Edinburgh, has shown, by elaborate research, that in  those wives who are destined to have children, there intervenes, on the  average, about seventeen months between the marriage ceremony and the  birth of the first child, and that the question whether a woman will be  sterile is decided in the first three years of married life. If she have  no children in that time, the chances are thirteen to one against her  ever having any. In those cases, therefore, in which the first three  years of married life are fruitless, it is highly desirable for those  wishing a family to ascertain whether or not the barrenness is dependent  upon any defective condition capable of relief.    The age of a wife at the time of marriage has much to do with the  expectation of children. As the age increases over twenty-five years,  the interval between the marriage and the birth of the first child is  lengthened. For it has been ascertained that not only are women most  fecund from twenty to twenty-four, but that they begin their career of  child-bearing sooner after marriage than their younger or elder sisters.  Early marriages (those before the age of twenty) are sometimes more  fruitful than late ones (those after twenty-four). The interesting  result has further been arrived at in England, that about one in  fourteen of all marriages of women between fifteen and nineteen are  without offspring; that wives married at ages from twenty to twenty-four  inclusive, are almost all fertile; and that after that age the chances  of having no children gradually increases with the greater age at the  time of marriage.    There are two kinds of sterility which are physiological, natural to all  women,--that of young girls before puberty, and that of women who are  past the epoch of the cessation of the menses. In some very rare cases,  conception takes place after cessation. In one published case, it  occurred nine months afterwards, and in another eighteen months. In some  very rare cases, also, conception has taken place before the first  menstruation.    The older a woman is at the time of her marriage, the longer deferred is  the age at which she naturally becomes sterile. She bears children later  in life, in order to compensate, as it were, for her late commencement.  But although she continues to have children until a more advanced age  than the earlier married, yet her actual child-bearing period is  shorter. Nature does not entirely make up at the end of life for the  time lost from the duties of maternity in early womanhood; for the  younger married have really a longer era of fertility than the older,  though it terminates at an earlier age.    A wife who, having had children, has ceased for three years to conceive,  will probably bear no more, and the probability increases as time  elapses. After the first, births take place with an average interval, in  those who continue to be fertile, of about twenty months.    Nursing women are generally sterile, above all, during the first months  which follow accouchement, because the vital forces are then  concentrated on the secretion of the milk. In a majority of instances,  when suckling is prolonged to even nineteen or twenty months, pregnancy  does not take place at all until after weaning.    Climate has also an influence upon the fertility of marriages. In  southern regions more children are born, fewer in northern. The number  of children is in inverse proportion to the amount of food in a country  and in a season. In Belgium, the higher the price of bread the greater  the number of children, and the greater the number of infant deaths.    The seasons exert a power over the increase of population. The spring of  the year, as has already been stated, is the most favourable to  fecundity. It is not known whether day and night have any effect upon  conception.    The worldly condition seems to have much to do with the size of a  family. Rich and fashionable women have fewer children than their poor  and hard-worked neighbours. Wealth and pleasure seem to be often gladly  exchanged for the title of mother.    But it is our more particular object now to inquire into the _causes of  absolute sterility_ in individual cases, rather than to discuss the  operation of general laws upon the fertility of the community at large,  however inviting such a discussion may be. When marriages are fruitless,  the wife is almost always blamed. It is not to be supposed that she is  always in fault. Many husbands are absolutely sterile; for it is a  mistake to consider that every man must be prolific who is vigorous and  enjoys good health. Neither does it follow, because a woman has never  given birth to a living child, that she has not conceived. About one  marriage in eight is unproductive of living children, and therefore  fails to add to the population. The seeds of life have, however, been  more extensively sown among women than these figures would seem to  indicate. If the life of an infant for a long time after birth is a  frail one, before birth its existence is precarious in the extreme. It  often perishes soon after conception. A sickness, unusually long and  profuse, occurring in a young married woman a few days beyond the  regular time, is often the only evidence she will ever have that a life  she has communicated has been ended almost as soon as begun. A tendency  to miscarriage may therefore be all that stands in the way of a family.  This is generally remediable.    It is a well-known fact that frigidity is a frequent cause of  barrenness, as well as a barrier to matrimonial happiness. Its removal,  so desirable, is in many cases possible by detecting and doing away with  the cause. The causes are so various, that their enumeration here would  be tedious and unprofitable, for most of them can only be discovered  and remedied by a practical physician who has studied the particular  case under consideration. So also in regard to the various displacements  and diseases of the womb preventing conception. Proper medical treatment  is usually followed by the best results.    While the fact that pleasure is found in the marital relation is a  favourable augury for impregnation, it has been long noticed that  Messalinas are sterile. It was observed in Paris, that out of one  thousand only six bore children in the course of a year, whereas the  ordinary proportion in that city for that time is three and a half  births for every one hundred of the population.    In some women, nothing seems amiss but too intense passion. Such cases  are much more rare than instances of the opposite extreme producing the  same effect.    A condition of debility, or the presence of certain special poisons in  the blood, may prevent conception, or, what is to all intents the same  thing, cause miscarriage. Many apparently feeble women have large  families. But in numerous instances a tonic and sometimes an alternative  constitutional treatment is required before pregnancy will take place.  On the contrary, there are well-authenticated cases of women who were  stout and barren in opulence becoming thin and prolific in poverty.    The stimulus of novelty to matrimonial intercourse imparted by a short  separation of husband and wife, is often salutary in its influence upon  fertility.    To show upon what slight constitutional differences infertility often  depends, it is merely necessary to allude to the fact, known to every  one, that women who have not had children with one husband often have  them with another. This condition of physiological incompatibility is  evidently not altogether one of the emotional nature, for it is observed  in animals, among whom it is by no means rare to find certain males and  females"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24003"],[0,"Confessions of a Book-Lover (#18)"],[1,"upside down; when death was the  only real thing in life, and pain as much a part of the daily routine as  the sunshine, and when joy seemed to have been inexplicably crushed from  the earth, because sorrow was ever so recurrent that it could not be  forgotten for a moment. Then \"Seventeen\" arrived.    Booth Tarkington may have his ups and downs in future, as he has had in  the past. \"The Gentleman from Indiana\" seemed to me to be almost one of  the most tiresome books ever invented, while \"Monsieur Beaucaire\" was  one of the most fascinating, charming. You can hardly find a better  novel of American life than \"The Turmoil,\" unless it is Judge Grant's  \"Unleavened Bread.\"    But the best novels of American life seem to be written in order to be  forgotten. Who reads \"The Breadwinners\" now? Or who, except the  professional \"teacher\" of literature, recalls \"Prue and I\"? Or that  succession of Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe's novels, almost unequalled as  pictures of a section of our life, each of which better expresses her  talent than \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\"? The English and the French have longer  memories. Mrs. Oliphant's \"Chronicles of Carlingford\"--some of us  remember \"Miss Majoribanks\" or \"Phoebe Junior\"--finds a slowly  decreasing circle of readers. And while \"Sapho\" is almost forgotten,  \"Les Rois en Exil['e]\" and \"Jack\" are still parts of current French  literature. But \"Unleavened Bread\" or \"The Damnation of Theron Ware\" or  \"Elsie Venner\" or the \"Saxe Holm's Stories\" are so much of the past as  to be unread.    To the credit of the gentle reader, Miss Alcott's stories perennially  bloom. And, for some strange reason, the weird \"Elsie Dinsmore\" series  is found under the popular Christmas tree, while nobody gives the Rollo  books to anybody. Why? One may begin to believe that that degeneracy  which the prevalence of jazz, lip-sticks, and ballet costumes adapted to  the subway is supposed to indicate, is a real menace when one discovers  that \"Penrod\" or \"Seventeen\" has ceased to be read!    We may read Mark Twain and wallow in vulgarity, but it is my belief that  Sodom and Gomorrah would have escaped their fate, if a Carnegie of that  time had made it possible to keep books like \"Penrod\" and \"Seventeen\" in  general circulation!    It was once said of Anthony Trollope that as long as English men and  women of the upper and middle classes continued to exist, he might go on  writing novels with ever-increasing zest. And the same thing might be  said of Booth Tarkington in relation to his unique chronicles of  youth--that is, the youth of the Middle West, with a universal Soul. His  types are American, but there are Americas and Americas. Usage permits  us to use a term for our part of the continent to which our Canadian and  South and Central Americans and Mexicans might reasonably object; but  while the young Americans of Booth Tarkington are typically American,  they personally could belong only to the Middle West. The hero of  \"Seventeen\" would not be the same boy if he had been born in  Philadelphia or New York or Boston. Circumstances would have made him  different. The consciousness of class distinction would have made him  old before his time; and though he might be just as amusing--he would  not have been amusing quite in the same way.    And this is one of the fine qualities of Mr. Tarkington's imaginative  synthesis. He is individual and of his own soil; he knows very well that  it is unnecessary to exaggerate or even to invent; he has only to  perceive with those rare gifts of perception which he possesses. It all  seems so easy until you try to do it yourself!    The state of mind of Penrod, when he is being prepared for the pageant  of the \"Table Round,\" is inexpressibly amusing to the adult reader; but  no child can look on it as entirely amusing, because every child has  suffered more or less, as Penrod suffered, from the unexplainable  hardness of heart and dullness of mind of older people. Something or  other prevents the most persecuted boy from admitting that his parents  are bad parents because they force impositions which tear all the fibres  of his soul and make him helpless before a jeering world. When Penrod  has gone through horrors, which are nameless because they seem to be so  unreasonable, he murmurs aloud, \"_Well, hasn't this been a day!_\"  Because of the humour in \"Penrod\" there is a pathos as true and real as  those parts in the \"Pickwick Papers\" where fortunately Dickens is  pathetic in a real sense because he did not strive for pathos. Everybody  admits now that Dickens becomes almost repellent when he wilfully tries  to be pathetic.    One could pick out of \"Seventeen\" a score of delightful situations which  seem to ripple from the pen of Booth Tarkington, one of the best being  the scene between the hero and his mother when that _esprit terrible_,  his sister, seems to stand between him and the lady of his thoughts. And  \"Penrod\" is full of them. The description of that young gallant's  entrance into society is of Mr. Tarkington's best. Penrod is expected to  find, according to the rules of dancing academies, a partner for the  cotillion. It is his duty to call on the only young lady unengaged, who  was Miss Rennsdale, aged eight. Penrod, carefully tutored, makes his  call.         A decorous maid conducted the long-belated applicant to her where       she sat upon a sofa beside a nursery governess. The decorous maid       announced him composedly as he made his entrance.         \"Mr. Penrod Schofield!\"         Miss Rennsdale suddenly burst into loud sobs.         \"Oh!\" she wailed. \"I just knew it would be him!\"         The decorous maid's composure vanished at once--likewise her       decorum. She clapped her hand over her mouth and fled, uttering       sounds. The governess, however, set herself to comfort her       heartbroken charge, and presently succeeded in restoring Miss       Rennsdale to a semblance of that poise with which a lady receives       callers and accepts invitations to dance cotillons. But she       continued to sob at intervals.         Feeling himself at perhaps a disadvantage, Penrod made offer of his       hand for the morrow with a little embarrassment. Following the form       prescribed by Professor Bartet, he advanced several paces toward       the stricken lady and bowed formally.         \"I hope,\" he said by rote, \"you're well, and your parents also in       good health. May I have the pleasure of dancing the cotillon as       your partner t'-morrow afternoon?\"         The wet eyes of Miss Rennsdale searched his countenance without       pleasure, and a shudder wrung her small shoulders; but the       governess whispered to her instructively, and she made a great       effort.         \"I thu-thank you fu-for your polite invu-invu-invutation; and I       ac----\" Thus far she progressed when emotion overcame her again.       She beat frantically upon the sofa with fists and heels. \"Oh, I did       want it to be Georgie Bassett!\"         \"No, no, no!\" said the governess, and whispered urgently, whereupon       Miss Rennsdale was able to complete her acceptance.         \"And I ac-accept wu-with pu-pleasure!\" she moaned, and immediately,       uttering a loud yell, flung herself face downward upon the sofa,       clutching her governess convulsively.         Somewhat disconcerted, Penrod bowed again.         \"I thank you for your polite acceptance,\" he murmured hurriedly;       \"and I trust--I trust--I forget. Oh, yes--I trust we shall have a       most enjoyable occasion. Pray present my compliments to your       parents; and I must now wish you a very good afternoon.\"         Concluding these courtly demonstrations with another bow he       withdrew in fair order, though thrown into partial confusion in the       hall by a final wail from his crushed hostess:         \"Oh! Why couldn't it be anybody but him!\"    Dickens would not have done the scene quite this way; he could not have  so conceived it, and he might have overdone it, but Booth Tarkington  gets it just right. He has created boy characters which will live  because they are alive. One of the most detestable books, after Mark  Twain's \"Yankee at the Court of King Arthur,\" is Dickens's \"Child's  History of England.\" The two books have various gross faults in common  and these faults are due to colossal ignorance. Mr. Gilbert Chesterton  says that one of Dickens's is due to         the application of a plain rule of right and wrong to all       circumstances to which it was applied. It is not that they wrongly       enforce the fixed principle that life should be saved; it is that       they take a fire-engine to a shipwreck and a life-boat to a house       on fire. The business of a good man in Dickens's time was to bring       justice up to date. The business of a good man in Dunstan's time       was to toil to ensure the survival of any justice at all.    It seems to me that if all the works of Dickens were lost we might do  very well with the \"Pickwick Papers\" and \"Nicholas Nickleby.\" To these,  one is tempted to add \"Our Mutual Friend.\"    When I was young enough to assist at meetings of Literary Societies,  where papers on Dickens were read, I was invariably informed that  \"Charles Dickens could not paint a lady or a gentleman.\" There was no  reason given for this censure. It was presumed that the authors of the  papers meant an English lady or gentleman. Nobody, to my knowledge, ever  defined what an English gentleman or lady was. When one considers that  for a long period an English gentleman's status was determined by the  fact that he owned land, had not even a remote connection with \"trade\"  or that he was instructed at Eton or Harrow, in Oxford or Cambridge, the  more modern definition would have been very different from what the  English of the olden time would have called a gentleman.
