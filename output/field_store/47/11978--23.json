[Sidenote: An \"Old Cow\" of a Horse]    But the point is that it is much better, oh, infinitely! to get an \"old  cow\" than a horse without these qualities. The \"old cow\" will carry you,  and will be there when wanted. That is the main thing in the mountains.  While as for the other horse, no matter how well bred he is, how  spirited, how well gaited, how handsome, how appealing in every way to a  horseman's eye--he will be worse than no horse if you have to keep your  hands on him, if he must be picketed at night, if he is likely to shy on  a bad trail, if he may refuse to tackle a rough place or to swim a  river.    [Illustration: In mid-day the shade of the pines is inviting]    [Sidenote: A Handsome Horse Not Necessary]    Of course it is nice to ride a good-looking horse; but in the mountains  most emphatically \"handsome is what handsome does.\" The horses I now own  are fine animals and fine mountain ponies; but some of the best I have  ever ridden, a horseman would not look at twice. On a time, being under  the absolute necessity of getting a pack quickly, I purchased a bay that  I promptly named Methuselah. He was some sixteen years old, badly stove  forward by hard riding, and not much of a horse anyway. For three months  he carried a pack. Then one day I threw a saddle on him to go a short  distance on some little errand. Methuselah, overjoyed, did his best. The  old horse was one of the best mountain saddlers in the outfit. He  climbed surely and well; he used his head in negotiating bad places;  would stay where he was put. The fact that he was not sound was  utterly unimportant, for not once in a week was he required to go faster  than a walk.    On the other hand I once owned a Bill-horse, mountain-bred and raised.  He was a beautiful beast, proud, high-stepping--one you would be glad to  be seen on. He would have been worth considerable money, and would have  afforded much solid satisfaction if I had wanted him for cow work, or  pleasure riding in the lower country. But it was absolutely impossible  to catch him, even hobbled, without a corral. One day I saw him leap  from a stand and with hobbles over a fence and feed trough. So I traded  him for another, not near so much of a horse, as a horse, but worth two  dozen Bill-horses.    [Sidenote: Gun Shyness]    [Sidenote: What One \"Sam Fat\" Did]    One other thing you must notice, and that is whether or not the beast is  gun shy. A great many stampede wildly at the report of firearms. I once  owned a pack horse named Sam Fat, on which for some time I  congratulated myself. He was a heavy animal, and could carry a  tremendous load; and yet he was sure-footed and handled himself well on  rough country. He was gentle and friendly. He took excellent care of his  pack, and he followed perfectly. No one needed to ride behind him to  keep Sam Fat coming. I used to turn him loose when I started, and pay no  more attention to him until I stopped. No matter how rich the feed  through which we passed, Sam Fat was always on hand when the halt was  called. And, very important point, he was a good rustler--he kept fat  and sleek on poor food where other horses gaunted. Altogether Sam Fat  was a find. Then one day one of the party shot off a harmless little  twenty-two caliber popgun. Sam Fat went crazy. He squatted flat, uttered  a terrified squeal, and departed through the woods, banging his pack  against trees and hanging limbs. We chased him a mile, and finally  brought him back, but all the rest of the day he was panicky. I tried to  get him accustomed to shooting by tying him near our target practice,  but it was no use. Finally, though reluctantly, I sold him.    So when the natives bring in their horses for your selection blind your  eyes to the question of looks and points until you have divided the  offering into two parts--those that are sure-footed, courageous, gentle,  tractable, easy to catch, good grub rustlers, and if pack horses, those  that will follow and will take care of their packs, and those that lack  one or more of these qualifications. Discard the second group. Then if  the first group contains nothing but blemished or homely horses, make  the best of it, perfectly sure that the others might as well not exist.    [Sidenote: Qualifications]    In general, a horse just from pasture should have a big belly. A  small-bellied horse will prove to be a poor feeder, and will probably  weaken down on a long hike. The best horse stands from fourteen hands to  fourteen two, and is chunkily built. There are exceptions, both ways, to  this rule. A pack horse is better with low withers on account of the  possibility of sore backs. Avoid a horse whose ears hang sidewise from  his head; he is apt to be stubborn. As for the rest, horse sense is the  same everywhere.    [Sidenote: What a Horse Should Carry]    [Sidenote: Sore Backs]    A pack horse can carry two hundred pounds--not more. Of course more can  be piled on him, and he will stand up under it, but on a long trip he  will deteriorate. Greater weights are carried only in text books, in  camp-fire lies, and where a regular pack route permits of grain feeding.  A good animal, with care, will take two hundred successfully enough, but  I personally always pack much lighter. Feed costs nothing, so it is  every bit as cheap to take three horses as two. The only expense is the  slight bother of packing an extra animal. In return you can travel  farther and more steadily, the chances of sore backs are minimized, your  animals keep fat and strong, and in case one meets with an accident, you  can still save all your effects on the other. For the last three years  I have made it a practice to pack only about a hundred to a hundred and  twenty-five pounds when off for a very long trip. My animals have always  come out fat and hearty, sometimes in marked contrast to those of my  companions, and I have not had a single case of sore back.    The latter are best treated by Bickmore's Gall Cure. Its use does not  interfere in the least with packing; and I have never seen a case it did  not cure inside ten days or two weeks if applied at the beginning of the  trouble.    [Sidenote: How Far a Horse Should Travel]    In the mountains and on grass-feed twenty miles a day is big travel. If  you push more than that you are living beyond your income. It is much  better, if you are moving every day, to confine yourself to jaunts of  from twelve to fifteen miles on an average. Then if necessity arises,  you have something to fall back on, and are able to make a forced march.    [Sidenote: Mountain Travel]    The distance may seem very short to you if you have never traveled in  the mountains; but as a matter of fact you will probably find it quite  sufficient, both in length of time and in variety of scenery. To cover  it you will travel steadily for from six to eight hours; and in the  diversity of country will be interested every step of the way. Indeed so  varied will be the details that it will probably be difficult to believe  you have made so small a mileage, until you stop to reflect that,  climbing and resting, no horse can go faster than two or two and  one-half miles an hour.    [Sidenote: Desert Travel]    On the desert or the plains the length of your journey must depend  entirely on the sort of feed you can get. Thirty miles a day for a long  period is all a fed-horse can do, while twenty is plenty enough for an  animal depending on his own foraging. Longer rides are not to be  considered in the course of regular travel. I once did one hundred and  eighty miles in two days--and then took a rest.    [Sidenote: Time to Travel]    In the mountains you must keep in mind that a horse must both eat and  rest; and that he will not graze when frost is on the meadows. Many  otherwise skillful mountaineers ride until nearly dark, and are up and  off soon after daylight. They wonder why their horses lose flesh and  strength. The truth is the poor beasts must compress their twenty-four  hours of sustenance into the short noon stop, and the shorter evening  before the frost falls. It is often much wiser to get a very early  start, to travel until the middle of the afternoon, and then to go into  camp. Whatever inconvenience and discomfort you may suffer is more than  made up for by the opportunities to hunt, fish, or cook afforded by the  early stop; and the time you imagine you lose is regained in the long  run by the regularity of your days' journeys.    [Sidenote: Desert Journeying]    On the desert or the plains where it is hot, to the contrary, you will  have better luck by traveling early and late. Desert journeying is  uncomfortable anyway, but has its compensations. We ordinarily get under  way by three in the morning; keep going until nine; start about six  again--after supper--and travel until nine of the evening. Thus we take  advantage of whatever coolness is possible, and see the rising and the  falling of the day, which is the most wonderful and beautiful of the  desert's gifts.    [Sidenote: Climbing]    Going up steep hills in high altitudes you must breathe your horse every  fifty feet or so. It need not be a long rest. Merely rein him in for  eight or ten seconds. Do the same thing _always_ before entering the  negotiation of a bad place in the trail. Do this, no matter how fresh  and eager your animal may seem. Often it spells the difference between a  stumble and a good clean climb. An experienced pack horse will take  these rests on his own initiative, stopping and also starting again with  the regularity of clockwork.    It does not hurt a horse to sweat, but if ever he begins to drip  heavily, and to tremble in the legs, it is getting time to hunt the  shade for a rest. I realize that such minor points as these may be  perfectly well known to every one likely to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3296"],[0,"The Confessions of St. Augustine (#18)"],[1,"way to life could not be found out.    Nor did I yet groan in my prayers, that Thou wouldest help me; but  my spirit was wholly intent on learning, and restless to dispute. And  Ambrose himself, as the world counts happy, I esteemed a happy man, whom  personages so great held in such honour; only his celibacy seemed to me  a painful course. But what hope he bore within him, what struggles he  had against the temptations which beset his very excellencies, or what  comfort in adversities, and what sweet joys Thy Bread had for the hidden  mouth of his spirit, when chewing the cud thereof, I neither could  conjecture, nor had experienced. Nor did he know the tides of my  feelings, or the abyss of my danger. For I could not ask of him, what  I would as I would, being shut out both from his ear and speech by  multitudes of busy people, whose weaknesses he served. With whom when he  was not taken up (which was but a little time), he was either refreshing  his body with the sustenance absolutely necessary, or his mind with  reading. But when he was reading, his eye glided over the pages, and  his heart searched out the sense, but his voice and tongue were at rest.  Ofttimes when we had come (for no man was forbidden to enter, nor was it  his wont that any who came should be announced to him), we saw him thus  reading to himself, and never otherwise; and having long sat silent  (for who durst intrude on one so intent?) we were fain to depart,  conjecturing that in the small interval which he obtained, free from the  din of others' business, for the recruiting of his mind, he was loth to  be taken off; and perchance he dreaded lest if the author he read should  deliver any thing obscurely, some attentive or perplexed hearer should  desire him to expound it, or to discuss some of the harder questions; so  that his time being thus spent, he could not turn over so many volumes  as he desired; although the preserving of his voice (which a very little  speaking would weaken) might be the truer reason for his reading to  himself. But with what intent soever he did it, certainly in such a man  it was good.    I however certainly had no opportunity of enquiring what I wished of  that so holy oracle of Thine, his breast, unless the thing might be  answered briefly. But those tides in me, to be poured out to him,  required his full leisure, and never found it. I heard him indeed every  Lord's day, rightly expounding the Word of truth among the people; and  I was more and more convinced that all the knots of those crafty  calumnies, which those our deceivers had knit against the Divine Books,  could be unravelled. But when I understood withal, that \"man created  by Thee, after Thine own image,\" was not so understood by Thy spiritual  sons, whom of the Catholic Mother Thou hast born again through grace,  as though they believed and conceived of Thee as bounded by human shape  (although what a spiritual substance should be I had not even a faint or  shadowy notion); yet, with joy I blushed at having so many years barked  not against the Catholic faith, but against the fictions of carnal  imaginations. For so rash and impious had I been, that what I ought by  enquiring to have learned, I had pronounced on, condemning. For Thou,  Most High, and most near; most secret, and most present; Who hast not  limbs some larger, some smaller, but art wholly every where, and no  where in space, art not of such corporeal shape, yet hast Thou made man  after Thine own image; and behold, from head to foot is he contained in  space.    Ignorant then how this Thy image should subsist, I should have knocked  and proposed the doubt, how it was to be believed, not insultingly  opposed it, as if believed. Doubt, then, what to hold for certain,  the more sharply gnawed my heart, the more ashamed I was, that so long  deluded and deceived by the promise of certainties, I had with childish  error and vehemence, prated of so many uncertainties. For that they were  falsehoods became clear to me later. However I was certain that they  were uncertain, and that I had formerly accounted them certain, when  with a blind contentiousness, I accused Thy Catholic Church, whom I now  discovered, not indeed as yet to teach truly, but at least not to teach  that for which I had grievously censured her. So I was confounded, and  converted: and I joyed, O my God, that the One Only Church, the body of  Thine Only Son (wherein the name of Christ had been put upon me as an  infant), had no taste for infantine conceits; nor in her sound doctrine  maintained any tenet which should confine Thee, the Creator of all, in  space, however great and large, yet bounded every where by the limits of  a human form.    I joyed also that the old Scriptures of the law and the Prophets were  laid before me, not now to be perused with that eye to which before they  seemed absurd, when I reviled Thy holy ones for so thinking, whereas  indeed they thought not so: and with joy I heard Ambrose in his sermons  to the people, oftentimes most diligently recommend this text for a  rule, The letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life; whilst he drew  aside the mystic veil, laying open spiritually what, according to the  letter, seemed to teach something unsound; teaching herein nothing that  offended me, though he taught what I knew not as yet, whether it were  true. For I kept my heart from assenting to any thing, fearing to fall  headlong; but by hanging in suspense I was the worse killed. For I  wished to be as assured of the things I saw not, as I was that seven and  three are ten. For I was not so mad as to think that even this could not  be comprehended; but I desired to have other things as clear as this,  whether things corporeal, which were not present to my senses, or  spiritual, whereof I knew not how to conceive, except corporeally. And  by believing might I have been cured, that so the eyesight of my soul  being cleared, might in some way be directed to Thy truth, which abideth  always, and in no part faileth. But as it happens that one who has tried  a bad physician, fears to trust himself with a good one, so was it with  the health of my soul, which could not be healed but by believing, and  lest it should believe falsehoods, refused to be cured; resisting Thy  hands, Who hast prepared the medicines of faith, and hast applied  them to the diseases of the whole world, and given unto them so great  authority.    Being led, however, from this to prefer the Catholic doctrine, I felt  that her proceeding was more unassuming and honest, in that she required  to be believed things not demonstrated (whether it was that they could  in themselves be demonstrated but not to certain persons, or could not  at all be), whereas among the Manichees our credulity was mocked by a  promise of certain knowledge, and then so many most fabulous and  absurd things were imposed to be believed, because they could not be  demonstrated. Then Thou, O Lord, little by little with most tender and  most merciful hand, touching and composing my heart, didst persuade  me--considering what innumerable things I believed, which I saw not, nor  was present while they were done, as so many things in secular history,  so many reports of places and of cities, which I had not seen; so many  of friends, so many of physicians, so many continually of other men,  which unless we should believe, we should do nothing at all in this  life; lastly, with how unshaken an assurance I believed of what  parents I was born, which I could not know, had I not believed upon  hearsay--considering all this, Thou didst persuade me, that not they who  believed Thy Books (which Thou hast established in so great authority  among almost all nations), but they who believed them not, were to be  blamed; and that they were not to be heard, who should say to me, \"How  knowest thou those Scriptures to have been imparted unto mankind by the  Spirit of the one true and most true God?\" For this very thing was  of all most to be believed, since no contentiousness of blasphemous  questionings, of all that multitude which I had read in the  self-contradicting philosophers, could wring this belief from me,  \"That Thou art\" whatsoever Thou wert (what I knew not), and \"That the  government of human things belongs to Thee.\"    This I believed, sometimes more strongly, more weakly otherwhiles; yet I  ever believed both that Thou wert, and hadst a care of us; though I was  ignorant, both what was to be thought of Thy substance, and what way led  or led back to Thee. Since then we were too weak by abstract reasonings  to find out truth: and for this very cause needed the authority of Holy  Writ; I had now begun to believe that Thou wouldest never have given  such excellency of authority to that Writ in all lands, hadst Thou not  willed thereby to be believed in, thereby sought. For now what things,  sounding strangely in the Scripture, were wont to offend me, having  heard divers of them expounded satisfactorily, I referred to the depth  of the mysteries, and its authority appeared to me the more venerable,  and more worthy of religious credence, in that, while it lay open to all  to read, it reserved the majesty of its mysteries within its profounder  meaning, stooping to all in the great plainness of its words and  lowliness of its style, yet calling forth the intensest application of  such as are not light of heart; that so it might receive all in its open  bosom, and through narrow passages waft over towards Thee some few, yet  many more than if it stood not aloft on such a height of authority, nor  drew multitudes within its bosom by its holy lowliness. These things  I thought on, and Thou wert with me; I sighed, and Thou heardest me; I  wavered, and Thou didst guide me; I wandered through the broad way of  the world, and Thou didst not forsake me.    I panted after honours, gains, marriage; and thou deridedst me. In these  desires I underwent most bitter"]]]
