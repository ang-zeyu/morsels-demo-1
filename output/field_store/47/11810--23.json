At the corners and centre artillery was placed.    The Zulus advanced steadily, in horn fashion, with their  characteristic coolness and courage. The deadly fusillade from our  guns had no perceptible effect. On and on they came, surging in a  dense brown crescent, till within twenty yards of the British lines,  when, with the hail and storm of bullets crashing and blinding them,  they hesitated! That moment's hesitation was fatal--their one chance  slipped! A few warriors rushed onwards, many wavered, and gradually  the powerful horns were broken and disorganised. Then our Lancers  with a gallant charge dashed into the fray, plunging into the black  swarm that still met fury with fury. Captain Edgell was killed, and  many other officers had miraculous escapes. Once the enemy strove to  rally, but the effort was hopeless, and the magnificent Zulu  warriors were forced at last to turn and flee. Their defeat was  signal. Though the enemy numbered 20,000 to 5000 of our troops, the  Lancers with the Irregular Horse did splendid work, and ere all was  over 1000 Zulus bit the dust.    Then came the final march to Ulundi. This place, wholly deserted,  was fired, and while the sky glowed with red and gold reflections of  the conflagration, the victorious forces, worn out yet triumphant,  returned to the laagered camp they had left at daybreak.    [Illustration: THE BATTLE OF ULUNDI--FINAL RUSH OF THE ZULUS. THE  BRITISH SQUARE IN THE DISTANCE.    Drawing by R. Caton Woodville.]    The first news of the victory was carried to the Colony by Mr.  Archibald Forbes, the war correspondent of the _Daily News_, who was  himself wounded in the struggle. Starting instantly after the  decisive battle, in fourteen hours he rode a distance of 110 miles  to the nearest telegraph station at Landman's Drift, on the Buffalo  River. In thus exposing his life in the interests not only of his  journal but his country, he for ever associated himself with one of  the most interesting and thrilling campaigns of the century.    Lord Chelmsford's despatch gives a concise description of the day's  work:--    \"Cetchwayo, not having complied with my demands by noon yesterday,  July 3, and having fired heavily on the troops at the water, I  returned the 114 cattle he had sent in and ordered a reconnaissance  to be made by the mounted force under Colonel Buller. This was  effectually made, and caused the Zulu army to advance and show  fight.    \"This morning a force under my command, consisting of the second  division, under Major-General Newdigate, numbering 1870 Europeans,  530 natives, and eight guns, and the flying columns under  Brigadier-General Wood, numbering 2192 Europeans, 573 natives, four  guns, and two Gatlings, crossed the Umvolosi River at 6.15, and  marching in a hollow square, with the ammunition and entrenching  tool carts and bearer company in its centre, reached an excellent  position between Nodwengu and Ulundi, about half-past 8 A.M. This  had been observed by Colonel Buller the day before.    \"Our fortified camp on the right bank of the Umvolosi River was left  with a garrison of about 900 Europeans, 250 natives, and one Gatling  gun, under Colonel Bellairs. Soon after half-past seven the Zulu  army was seen leaving its bivouacs and advancing on every side.\"    \"The engagement was shortly afterwards commenced by the mounted men.  By nine o'clock the attack was fully developed. At half-past nine  the enemy wavered; the 17th Lancers, followed by the remainder of  the mounted men, attacked them, and a general rout ensued.    \"The prisoners state that Cetchwayo was personally commanding and  had made all the arrangements himself, and that he witnessed the  fight from Gikarzi kraal, and that twelve regiments took part in it.  If so, 20,000 men attacked us.    \"It is impossible to estimate with any correctness the loss of the  enemy, owing to the extent of country over which they attacked and  retreated, but it could not have been less, I consider, than 1000  killed. By noon Ulundi was in flames, and during the day all  military kraals of the Zulu army and in the valley of the Umvolosi  were destroyed. At 2 P.M. the return march to the camp of the  column commenced. The behaviour of the troops under my command was  extremely satisfactory; their steadiness under a complete belt of  fire was remarkable. The dash and enterprise of the mounted branches  was all that could be wished, and the fire of the artillery very  good. A portion of the Zulu force approached our fortified camp, and  at one time threatened to attack it. The native contingent, forming  a part of the garrison, were sent out after the action, and assisted  in the pursuit.    \"As I have fully accomplished the object for which I advanced, I  consider I shall now be best carrying out Sir Garnet Wolseley's  instructions by moving at once to Entonganini, and thence to  Kmamagaza. I shall send back a portion of this force with empty  waggons for supplies, which are now ready at Fort Marshall.\"    All were rejoiced that Lord Chelmsford should have been able to gain  this victory before the arrival on the scene of Sir Garnet Wolseley,  and there were many among his friends who regretted when he  resigned.    The following quotation from the _London Gazette_ explains the most  conspicuous of the brave deeds that were done during this campaign,  though there were many more which came near to rivalling them, so  many, indeed, that it would have been impossible to have given  honours to all who deserved them:--                                                \"WAR OFFICE, _June 17_.    \"The Queen has been graciously pleased to signify her intention to  confer the decoration of the Victoria Cross on the undermentioned  officers and soldier of her Majesty's army, whose claims have been  submitted for her Majesty's approval for their gallant conduct  during the recent operations in South Africa, as recorded against  their names, viz.:--    \"Captain and Brevet-Lieutenant-Colonel Redvers H. Buller, C.B., 60th  Rifles, for his gallant conduct at the retreat at Zlobane on the  28th of March 1879, in having assisted, while hotly pursued, by  Zulus, in rescuing Captain C. D'Arcy, of the Frontier Light Horse,  who was retiring on foot, and carrying him on his horse until he  overtook the rear-guard; also for having on the same date and under  the same circumstances conveyed Lieutenant C. Everitt of the  Frontier Light Horse, whose horse had been killed under him, to a  place of safety. Later on Colonel Buller, in the same manner, saved  a trooper of the Frontier Light Horse, whose horse was completely  exhausted, and who otherwise would have been killed by the Zulus,  who were within eighty yards of him.    \"Major William K. Leet, first battalion 13th Regiment, for his  gallant conduct on the 28th of March 1879, in rescuing from the  Zulus Lieutenant A. M. Smith of the Frontier Light Horse, during the  retreat from Zlobane. Lieutenant Smith while on foot, his horse  having been shot, was closely pursued by the Zulus, and would have  been killed had not Major Leet taken him upon his horse and rode  with him, under the fire of the enemy, to a place of safety.    \"Surgeon-Major James Henry Reynolds, Army Medical Department, for  the conspicuous bravery during the attack at Rorke's Drift on the  22nd and 23rd of January 1879, which he exhibited in his attention  to the wounded under fire, and in his voluntarily conveying  ammunition from the store to the defenders of the hospital, whereby  he exposed himself to a cross fire from the enemy both in going and  returning.    \"Lieutenant Edward S. Browne, first battalion 24th Regiment, for his  gallant conduct on the 29th March 1879, when the Mounted Infantry  were being driven in by the enemy at Zlobane, in galloping back and  twice assisting on his horse, under heavy fire and within a few  yards of the enemy, one of the mounted men, who must otherwise have  fallen into the enemy's hands.    \"Private Wassell, 80th Regiment, for his gallant conduct in having,  at the imminent risk of his own life, saved that of Private Westwood  of the same regiment. On the 22nd of January 1879, when the camp at  Isandlwana was taken by the enemy, Private Wassell retreated towards  the Buffalo River, in which he saw a comrade struggling and  apparently drowning. He rode to the bank, dismounted, leaving his  horse on the Zulu side, rescued the man from the stream, and again  mounted his horse, dragging Private Westwood across the river, under  a heavy shower of bullets.\"          CHAPTER III    SIR GARNET WOLSELEY AT PRETORIA      Our disaster at Isandlwana caused enormous excitement in Pretoria.  Great and unconcealed rejoicing among the Boers took place; work was  suspended, all heads were put together to make capital out of Great  Britain's misfortunes. Notices were sent out on the 18th of March,  summoning the burghers to a mass meeting to be held some thirty  miles from the town. These meetings, it must here be noted, were  scarcely attended by invitation. A large number of the people  appeared on compulsion, brought \"to the scratch\" by threats. One of  the menaces, a favourite one according to Mr. Rider Haggard, was  that those who did not attend should be made \"biltong\" of when the  country was given back. Biltong is meat cut into strips and hung in  the sun to dry. The result of the notices, backed by threats, was a  meeting of some three thousand armed Boers, who evidently meant  mischief.    The threatening aspect of the Boers caused the corps known as the  Pretoria Horse, a corps raised for the purpose of acting as cavalry  on the Zulu border, to be retained for service in and around the  capital. While matters stood thus, and the general discontent seemed  to portend even further hostilities, Sir Bartle Frere"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23748"],[0,"History of the United States, Volume 3 (#18)"],[1," to be a profitable field for slavery, nor would  economic considerations ever have originated a slavery question  concerning it. But politically its character as slave or free was of the  utmost consequence to the South, where the resolution gradually arose  either to secure it for the peculiar institution or else prevent its  organization even as a Territory. A motion for such organization had  been unsuccessfully made about 1843, and it was repeated, equally  without effect, each session for ten years. None of these motions had  contained any hint that slavery could possibly find place in the  proposed Territory. The bill of December 15, 1853, like its  predecessors, had as first drawn no reference whatever to slavery, but  when it returned from the committee on Territories, of which Douglas was  chairman, the report, not explicitly, indeed, made the assumption,  unheard of before, that Kansas-Nebraska stood in the same relation to  slavery in which Utah and New Mexico had stood in 1850; and that the  compromise of that year, in leaving the question of slavery to the  States to be formed from these Territories, had already set aside the  agreement of 1820. These assumptions were totally false. The act of 1850  gave Utah and New Mexico no power as Territories over the debatable  institution, and contained not the slightest suggestion of any rule in  the matter for territories in general.    But the hint was taken, and on January 16th notice given of intention to  move an out-and-out abrogation of the Missouri Compromise. Such  abrogation was at once incorporated in the Kansas-Nebraska bill reported  by Douglas, January 23, 1854. This separated Kansas from Nebraska, and  the subsequent struggle raged in reference to Kansas alone. The bill  erroneously declared it established by the acts of 1850 that \"all  questions as to slavery in the Territories,\" no less than in the States  which should grow out of them, were to be left to the residents, subject  to appeal to the United States courts. It passed both houses by good  majorities and was signed by President Pierce May 30th. Its animus  appeared from the loss in the Senate of an amendment, moved by S. P.  Chase, of Ohio, allowing the Territory to prohibit slavery.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  Franklin Pierce.  From a painting by Healy, in 1852, at the Corcoran Art Gallery.      Thus was first voiced by a public authority Judge Douglas's new and  taking heresy of \"squatter sovereignty,\" that Congress, though  possessing by Article IV., Section iii., Clause 2 of the Constitution,  general authority over the Territories, is not permitted to touch  slavery there, but must leave it for each territorial populace \"to vote  up or vote down.\" At the South this doctrine of Douglas's was dubbed  \"nonintervention,\" and its real aim to secure Kansas a pro-slavery  character avowed. It was consequently popular there as useful toward the  repeal, although repudiated the instant its working bade fair to render  Kansas free.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  Stephen A. Douglas.      [1855]    This was soon the prospect. Organizations had been formed to aid  anti-slavery emigrants from the northern States to Kansas. The first was  the Kansas Aid Society, another a Massachusetts corporation entitled the  New England Emigrant Aid Society. There were others still. Kansas began  to fill up with settlers of strong northern sympathies. They were in  real minority at the congressional election of November, 1854, and in  apparent minority at the territorial election the next March. The vote  against them on the last occasion, however, was largely deposited by  Missourians who came across the border on election day, voted, and  returned. This was demonstrated by the fact that there were but 2,905  legal voters in the Territory at the time, while 5,427 votes were cast  for the pro-slavery candidates alone. These early successes gave the  pro-slavery party and government in Kansas great vantage in the  subsequent congressional contest. The first Legislature convened at  Pawnee, July 2, 1855, enacted the slave laws of Missouri, and ordered  that for two years all state officers should be appointed by legislative  authority, and no man vote in the Territory who would not swear to  support the fugitive slave law.    The free-state settlers, now a majority, ignored this Legislature and  its acts, and at once set to work to secure Kansas admission to the  Union as a State without slavery. The Topeka convention, October 23,  1855, formed the Topeka constitution, which was adopted December 14th,  only forty-six votes being polled against it. This showed that  pro-slavery men abstained from voting. January 15, 1856, an election was  held under this constitution for state officers, a state legislature,  and a representative in Congress. The House agreed, July 3d, by one  majority, to admit Kansas with the Topeka constitution, but the Senate  refused. The Topeka Legislature assembled July 4th, but was dispersed by  United States troops.    [1856-1857]    This was done under command from Washington. President Pierce, backed by  the Senate with its steady pro-slavery majority, was resolved at all  hazards to recognize the pro-slavery authorities of Kansas and no other,  and, as it seemed, to force it to become a slave State; but fortunately  the House had an anti-slavery majority which prevented this. The friends  of freedom in Kansas had also on their side the history that was all  this time making in Kansas itself. During the summer of 1856 that  Territory was a theatre of constant war. Men were murdered, towns  sacked. Both sides were guilty of violence, but the free-state party  confessedly much the less so, having far the better cause. Nearly all  admitted that this party was in the majority. Even the governors, all  Democrats, appointed by Pierce, acknowledged this, some of them, to all  appearance, being removed as a punishment for the admission. Governor  Geary, in office from September, 1856, to March, 1857, and Governor  Walker, in office from May, 1857, were just and able men, and their  decisions, in most things favorable to the free-state cause, had much  weight with the country.    Walker's influence in the Territory led the free-state men to take part  in the territorial election of October, 1857, where they were entirely  triumphant. But the old, pro-slavery Legislature had called a  constitutional convention, which met at Lecompton, September, 1857, and  passed the Lecompton constitution. This constitution sanctioned slavery  and provided against its own submission to popular vote. It ordained  that only its provision in favor of slavery should be so submitted. This  pro-slavery clause was adopted, but only because the free-state men  would not vote. The Topeka Legislature submitted the whole constitution  to popular vote, when it was overwhelmingly rejected. The President and  Senate, however, urged statehood under the Lecompton constitution,  although popular votes in Kansas twice more, April, 1858, and March,  1859, had adopted constitutions prohibiting slavery, the latter being  that of Wyandotte. But the House still stood firm. Kansas was not  admitted to the Union till January 29, 1861, when her chief foes in the  United States Senate had seceded from the Union. She came in with the  Wyandotte constitution and hence as a free State.    It was during the debate upon Kansas affairs in 1856 that Preston S.  Brooks, a member of the House from South Carolina, made his cowardly  attack upon Charles Sumner. Sumner had delivered a powerful speech upon  the crime against Kansas, worded and delivered, naturally but  unfortunately, with some asperity. In this speech he animadverted  severely upon South Carolina and upon Senator Butler from that State.  This gave offence to Brooks, a relative of Butler, and coming into the  Senate Chamber while Sumner was busy writing at his desk, he fell upon  him with a heavy cane, inflicting injuries from which Sumner never  recovered, and which for four years unfitted him for his senatorial  duties. Sumner's colleague, Henry Wilson, in an address to the Senate,  characterized the assault as it deserved. He was challenged by Brooks,  but refused to fight on the ground that duelling was part of the  barbarism which Brooks had shown in caning Sumner. Anson Burlingame,  representative from Massachusetts, who had publicly denounced the  caning, was challenged by Brooks and accepted the challenge, but, as he  named Canada for the place of meeting, Brooks declined to fight him for  the ostensible reason that the state of feeling in the North would  endanger his life upon the journey. A vote to expel Brooks had a  majority in the House, though not the necessary two-thirds. He resigned,  but was at once re-elected by his South Carolina constituency.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  Charles Sumner.      While the fierce Kansas controversy had been raging, the South had grown  cold toward the Douglas doctrine of popular sovereignty, and had  gradually adopted another view based upon Calhoun's teachings. This was  to the effect that Congress, not under Article IV., section iii., clause  2, but merely as the agent of national sovereignty, rightfully  legislates for the Territories in all things, yet, in order to carry out  the constitutional equality of the States in the Territories, is obliged  to treat slaves found there precisely like any other property. If one  citizen wishes to hold slaves, all the rest opposing, the general  Government must support him. It is obvious how antagonistic this thought  was to that of Douglas, since, according to the latter, a majority of  the inhabitants in a Territory could elect to exclude slavery as well as  to establish it.    The new southern or Calhoun theory assumed startling significance for  the Nation when, in 1857, it was proclaimed in the Dred Scott decision  of the United States Supreme Court as part of the innermost "]]]
