Now  lay the knife down and start the skin loose on the legs with the  thumb and finger; work the skin down the leg to the root of the tail  then take knife and cut the skin loose around the vent working the  skin free around the roots of tail until you can get your fingers of  the left hand around the tail bone. Now with the right hand near the  body of the mink pulling with the right and you will strip the tail  clean from the bone. With the knife make a slit on either fore leg  about one inch from the heel and around the leg. You are now ready to  strip the skin down the body to the fore legs and with the thumb and  finger work the leg out. Strip the skin down to the ears and with the  knife cut the ears close to the head, continue to strip the skin down  to the eyes, cut around the eyes close to the bone and use the knife  on down to the end of nose. That was a short job. Now we will put  this mink carcass in the back end of the pen and cut the balance of  the rabbit up and put it in the pen back about six inches from the  trap.\"    \"Don't you use any scent; I have heard people say that you use some  kind of scent?\"    \"I use none, only of the animal itself. It did not take long to take  the pelt off that coon; we will strip some of that fat from the  carcass and do it up in the skin and put it in the knapsack; hang the  carcass up on that sapling. We must be moving now. Our next trap is a  bear trap; it sets up in that little sag you see and in a spring that  comes out of the side of the hill. I like to set traps in those  springs for they never freeze up and the bait keeps much longer. No,  there is nothing in it, I can see the clog there all right. Yes,  there is something in it; it is a coon and it is dead. Look, there is  a fox in a trap.\"    \"Where was the trap set, I do not see any bait pen?\"    \"Fred, you take this stick and walk up slowly to him; go up close and  give him a sharp blow across the back of the neck--that will fix him.  You see that big mossy log laying on the bank over there? That was  where he was caught. We will now set the trap again. See this little  sink in the log? That is where the trap was set; this limb is what  the trap was fastened to, one end on the ground and the other comes  just up to the log where the trap is set and we will staple the trap  to it. We will now cover it with moss, just like on this log, but we  will get it from another log. No one could tell that there was a trap  there.\"    \"Will not the fox smell it?\"    \"He might if it was not for this fox carcass. We will skin the fox,  just as we did the mink. Look out there Fred, do not disturb the moss  or anything on that log where the trap is. Keep away from that. We  will put this carcass in the little hollow and will drive a crotched  stake straddle of its neck; drive it well down; now take this stick  and rake some leaves over it, cover the neck where the stake is quite  well, the rest of the carcass only slightly. You have done it very  well and the fox will not notice what scent there is on the trap as  long as that carcass is there.\"    \"But you had no carcass there when you caught this one and I have  heard that a fox was afraid of the scent of iron?\"    \"That is all bosh. Keep your traps free from all foreign scent and  you need not be afraid of the scent of the iron, but if you catch  some animal in the trap, then you should have some of the scent of  that animal around near the trap, this will overcome what scent there  is on the trap. This, however, is only necessary with shy animals  like the fox. Coon and skunk are not afraid of what they smell.\"    \"Do you ever wear gloves when setting your traps?\"      [Illustration: LOG SET FOR FOX.]    \"No, that is all nonsense. Get the clamps out of the knapsack and we  will set the bear trap. We set the trap this way so that the bear  goes in lengthways of the jaws, not crosswise of them. We will now  place the trap in this hole that we have dug out, so that the water  will be deep enough to cover the trap and be sure that the jaws rest  firmly on the ground, so that if the bear should step on the jaws,  the trap would not tip up. Some trappers do not do this and then they  think that the shy animal turned the trap over. We will now cover the  trap with those water soaked leaves after which we will take this  piece of moss as large as your hand, and with this forked stick put  the moss on it, and place it on the pan of the trap.\"    \"Would the bear smell it, if you put it on with your hands?\"    \"No, but if the trap should accidentally spring it would be better to  catch the stick than your hand. Now we will cut this coon carcass  into two or three pieces and put it back in the bait pen about three  feet from the trap. There we have it fixed all right. We will now go  over the ridge to where there is another bear trap set and will eat  our lunch as we go along.\"    \"How did you know that a fox would go on that log where that trap was  set?\"    \"By knowing the nature of the animal. When the fox smelled the bear  bait in the pen there, I knew that he would get on the highest point  near the pen to investigate and that point was that log.\"    \"Is this the only way you catch foxes?\"    \"No, that is only one of the many ways. Here we are; the trap is  right down in the head of this hollow; that is a dark place down  there, yes, that is the kind of a place that bears like to travel  through. I can see the pen, but I do not see the clog. Yes, the clog  is gone, I guess that Bruin has put his foot in it this time. Now go  still and look sharp and see if we can find him anywhere for a bear  will try hard and get away when they first see you. He has gone this  way, see how he has torn down the brush and has turned up those old  logs. He will not do that long and after a little we may be obliged  to circle in places to find the trail. Here he has gone up this steep  side hill but he will not go far that way. See how he has torn this  old tree top up and gnawed those logs and those trees, he has been  past here. He has gone straight back down the hill. Now he will keep  along this side hill, for he may cross this hollow back and forth  three or four times before we find him fast. Here is the trail again,  he has gone back up the hill. We will work up the hill so as to keep  on the highest ground.\"    \"You have followed these bear trails a good many times, haven't you?\"    \"Yes, in 1900 I followed one seven days that broke the chain and went  up with the trap, and then another party ran across the bear and  killed it. I did not even get my trap back. They said they hung the  trap up in a tree and some one stole it.\"    \"Hold on Fred, what is that away down there in the hollow?\"    \"That is the bear, he is trying to climb that tree, I do not think he  will make it, for the clog is fast between those two small saplings  that stand by the large tree. We will go a little closer, there now!  when he turns his head sideways take good aim and put the ball square  in the ear. A good job, Fred, he never knew what hurt him. Now make a  slit in the skin, right at the point of the breast bone, and then  stick him as you would a hog. Do not cut the skin too much. Now Fred  get the clamps out of the knapsack and we will see if we can get him  out of the trap. Now we will skin him as you would a beef with the  exception, we will leave the claws on, for the skins are a much  better price where the feet are left. We will be very careful not to  cut the hide, for they skin about as mean as a hog does. Well now we  will hang the foreparts up in this tree and take the skin and the  saddles and pull for camp.\"    \"Are you not going to set the trap?\"    \"No, it will be dark before we get to camp now and we have got a  heavy load to carry, in fact, if it was anything but bear, we would  think we could not carry it.\"    \"My, but this is getting heavy.\"    \"Yes, Fred, but this all goes in with trapping and besides it will  improve the appetite.\"    \"I guess so, for I am as hungry as a wolf.\"    \"Well, here we are at camp. Fred, you will find the lamp on that  shelf close up in the corner. You light it while I start the fire.  Now Fred you will find the key to the camp chest behind that ridge  post. Open the chest and take the blankets out so that they will be  airing. Now in the other part of the chest you will find some tin  cups, plates, knives and forks, also some crackers, cheese and ginger  snaps. The cheese is done up in waxed paper. You can put those things  on the table while I go to the spring and get a pail of water. Now,  Fred, you raise that lid and you will find a box sunk down in the  ground, where you will find potatoes and bacon. Get some out. You  will find the coffee in a sack in the chest and the coffee pot is  hanging on that nail. You put the coffee on while I get the  potatoes.\"    \"Oh, we cannot wait for potatoes to cook.\"    \"Yes, we can, I will pare three or four and slice them up and put  them in the spider with a little water and some bits of pork and by  the time the coffee boils, the potatoes will be ready. Fred, just  hand me that lid so I can cover these potatoes over. You will find a  can of condensed milk and the sugar in the chest. Please set them on  the table while I fix the fire.\"    \"You have plenty of good dry wood.\"    \"Yes, I always come over to the camp before the trapping season  begins and cut up a good lot of wood. And those old elevated stove  ovens make the best kind of a stove for a camp. Fred, you pour the  coffee while I take the potatoes up and we will partake of this  frugal meal. In the morning for breakfast we will have bear steak,  boiled partridge and buck-wheat cakes.\"    \"Well Fred, I feel better, how is it with you?\"    \"Oh, I feel like a fighting cock now, but I was too hungry for  anything. Well Fred, the dish water is hot in that pan on the stove,  if you will wash the dishes, I will stretch those skins and dress  those "]]]
