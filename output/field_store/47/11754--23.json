It tilted forward  and downward with a heart-stilling \"Ssssooo\"; the ladder disappeared; a  line of brass-rimmed port-holes flashed past; a jet of Steam puffed in  Harvey's helplessly uplifted hands; a spout of hot water roared along  the rail of the \"We're Here\", and the little schooner staggered and  shook in a rush of screw-torn water, as a liner's stern vanished in the  fog. Harvey got ready to faint or be sick, or both, when he heard a  crack like a trunk thrown on a sidewalk, and, all small in his ear, a  far-away telephone voice drawling: \"Heave to! You've sunk us!\"    \"Is it us?\" he gasped.    \"No! Boat out yonder. Ring! We're goin' to look,\" said Dan, running out  a dory.    In half a minute all except Harvey, Penn, and the cook were overside  and away. Presently a schooner's stump-foremast, snapped clean across,  drifted past the bows. Then an empty green dory came by, knocking on  the 'We're Here's' side, as though she wished to be taken in. Then  followed something, face down, in a blue jersey, but it was not the  whole of a man. Penn changed colour and caught his breath with a click.  Harvey pounded despairingly at the bell, for he feared they might be  sunk at any minute, and he jumped at Dan's hail as the crew came back.    \"The Jennie Cushman,\" said Dan, hysterically, \"cut clean in  half--graound up an' trompled on at that! Not a quarter of a mile away.  Dad's got the old man. There ain't any one else, and--there was his  son, too. Oh, Harve, Harve, I can't stand it! I've seen--\" He dropped  his head on his arms and sobbed while the others dragged a grey-headed  man aboard.    \"What did you pick me up for?\" the stranger groaned. \"Disko, what did  you pick me up for?\"    Disko dropped a heavy hand on his shoulder, for the man's eyes were  wild and his lips trembled as he stared at the silent crew. Then up and  spoke Pennsylvania Pratt, who was also Haskins or Rich or McVitty when  Uncle Salters forgot; and his face was changed on him from the face of  a fool to the countenance of an old, wise man, and he said in a strong  voice: \"The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the  name of the Lord! I was--I am a minister of the Gospel. Leave him to  me.\"    \"Oh, you be, be you?\" said the man. \"Then pray my son back to me! Pray  back a nine-thousand-dollar boat an' a thousand quintal of fish. If  you'd left me alone my widow could ha' gone on to the Provident an'  worked fer her board, an' never known--an' never known. Now I'll hev to  tell her.\"    \"There ain't nothin' to say,\" said Disko. \"Better lie down a piece,  Jason Olley.\"    When a man has lost his only son, his summer's work, and his means of  livelihood, in thirty counted seconds, it is hard to give consolation.    \"All Gloucester men, wasn't they,\" said Tom Platt, fiddling helplessly  with a dory-becket.    \"Oh, that don't make no odds,\" said Jason, wringing the wet from his  beard. \"I'll be rowin' summer boarders araound East Gloucester this  fall.\" He rolled heavily to the rail, singing.    \"Happy birds that sing and fly Round thine altars, O Most High!\"    \"Come with me. Come below!\" said Penn, as though he had a right to give  orders. Their eyes met and fought for a quarter of a minute.    \"I dunno who you be, but I'll come,\" said Jason, submissively. \"Mebbe  I'll get back some o' the--some o' the--nine thousand dollars.\" Penn  led him into the cabin and slid the door behind.    \"That ain't Penn,\" cried Uncle Salters. \"It's Jacob Boiler, an'--he's  remembered Johnstown! I never seed such eyes in any livin' man's head.  What's to do naow? What'll I do naow?\"    They could hear Penn's voice and Jason's together. Then Penn's went on  alone, and Salters slipped off his hat, for Penn was praying. Presently  the little man came up the steps, huge drops of sweat on his face, and  looked at the crew. Dan was still sobbing by the wheel.    \"He don't know us,\" Salters groaned. \"It's all to do over again,  checkers and everything--an' what'll he say to me?\"    Penn spoke; they could hear that it was to strangers. \"I have prayed,\"  said he. \"Our people believe in prayer. I have prayed for the life of  this man's son. Mine were drowned before my eyes--she and my eldest  and--the others. Shall a man be more wise than his Maker? I prayed  never for their lives, but I have prayed for this man's son, and he  will surely be sent him.\"    Salters looked pleadingly at Penn to see if he remembered.    \"How long have I been mad?\" Penn asked suddenly. His mouth was  twitching.    \"Pshaw, Penn! You weren't never mad,\" Salters began. \"Only a little  distracted like.\"    \"I saw the houses strike the bridge before the fires broke out. I do  not remember any more. How long ago is that?\"    \"I can't stand it! I can't stand it!\" cried Dan, and Harvey whimpered  in sympathy.    \"Abaout five year,\" said Disko, in a shaking voice.    \"Then I have been a charge on some one for every day of that time. Who  was the man?\"    Disko pointed to Salters.    \"Ye hain't--ye hain't!\" cried the sea-farmer, twisting his hands  together. \"Ye've more'n earned your keep twice-told; an' there's money  owin' you, Penn, besides ha'af o' my quarter-share in the boat, which  is yours fer value received.\"    \"You are good men. I can see that in your faces. But--\"    \"Mother av Mercy,\" whispered Long Jack, \"an' he's been wid us all these  trips! He's clean bewitched.\"    A schooner's bell struck up alongside, and a voice hailed through the  fog: \"O Disko! 'Heard abaout the Jennie Cushman?\"    \"They have found his son,\" cried Penn. \"Stand you still and see the  salvation of the Lord!\"    \"Got Jason aboard here,\" Disko answered, but his voice quavered.  \"There--warn't any one else?\"    \"We've f'und one, though. 'Run acrost him snarled up in a mess o'  lumber thet might ha' bin a fo'c'sle. His head's cut some.\"    \"Who is he?\"    The \"We're Heres'\" heart-beats answered one another.    \"Guess it's young Olley,\" the voice drawled.    Penn raised his hands and said something in German. Harvey could have  sworn that a bright sun was shining upon his lifted face; but the drawl  went on: \"Sa-ay! You fellers guyed us consid'rable t'other night.\"    \"We don't feel like guyin' any now,\" said Disko.    \"I know it; but to tell the honest truth we was kinder--kinder driftin'  when we run ag'in' young Olley.\"    It was the irrepressible Carrie Pitman, and a roar of unsteady laughter  went up from the deck of the \"We're Here\".    \"Hedn't you 'baout's well send the old man aboard? We're runnin' in fer  more bait an' graound-tackle. 'Guess you won't want him, anyway, an'  this blame windlass work makes us short-handed. We'll take care of him.  He married my woman's aunt.\"    \"I'll give you anything in the boat,\" said Troop.    \"Don't want nothin', 'less, mebbe, an anchor that'll hold. Say! Young  Olley's gittin' kinder baulky an' excited. Send the old man along.\"    Penn waked him from his stupor of despair, and Tom Platt rowed him  over. He went away without a word of thanks, not knowing what was to  come; and the fog closed over all.    \"And now,\" said Penn, drawing a deep breath as though about to preach.  \"And now\"--the erect body sank like a sword driven home into the  scabbard; the light faded from the overbright eyes; the voice returned  to its usual pitiful little titter--\"and now,\" said Pennsylvania  Pratt, \"do you think it's too early for a little game of checkers, Mr.  Salters?\"    \"The very thing--the very thing I was goin' to say myself,\" cried  Salters, promptly. \"It beats all, Penn, how you git on to what's in a  man's mind.\"    The little fellow blushed and meekly followed Salters forward.    \"Up anchor! Hurry! Let's quit these crazy waters,\" shouted Disko, and  never was he more swiftly obeyed.    \"Now what in creation d'ye suppose is the meanin' o' that all?\" said  Long Jack, when they were working through the fog once more, damp,  dripping, and bewildered.    \"The way I sense it,\" said Disko, at the wheel, \"is this: The Jennie  Cushman business comin' on an empty stummick--\"    \"He--we saw one of them go by,\" sobbed Harvey.    \"An' that, o' course, kinder hove him outer water, Julluk runnin' a  craft ashore; hove him right aout, I take it, to rememberin' Johnstown  an' Jacob Boiler an' such-like reminiscences. Well, consolin' Jason  there held him up a piece, same's shorin' up a boat. Then, bein' weak,  them props slipped an' slipped, an' he slided down the ways, an' naow  he's water-borne ag'in. That's haow I sense it.\"    They decided that Disko was entirely correct.    \"'Twould ha' bruk Salters all up,\" said Long Jack, \"if Penn had stayed  Jacob Bollerin'. Did ye see his face when Penn asked who he'd been  charged on all these years'? How is ut, Salters?\"    \"Asleep--dead asleep. Turned in like a child,\" Salters replied,  tiptoeing aft. \"There won't be no grub till he wakes, natural. Did ye  ever see sech a gift in prayer? He everlastin'ly hiked young Olley  outer the ocean. Thet's my belief. Jason was tur'ble praoud of his boy,  an' I mistrusted all along 'twas a jedgment on worshippin' vain idols.\"    \"There's others jest as sot,\" said Disko.    \"That's dif'runt,\" Salters retorted quickly. \"Penn's not all caulked,  an' I ain't only but doin' my duty by him.\"    They waited, those hungry men, three hours, till Penn reappeared with a  smooth face and a blank mind. He said he believed that he had been  dreaming. Then he wanted to know why they were so silent, and they  could not tell him.    Disko worked all hands mercilessly for the next three or four days; and  when they could not go out, turned them into the hold to stack the  ship's stores into smaller compass, to make more room for the fish. The  packed mass ran from the cabin partition to the sliding door behind the  fo'c'sle stove; and Disko showed how there is great art in stowing  cargo so as to bring a schooner to her best draft.

The sudden collapse of Turkey left a void      which has upset the entire scheme of things existing....    [Illustration: A BAGPIPER]        The passions which the war has engendered are only partly due to      lust for territorial aggrandisement. Mere thirst after conquest      would have never produced such perversions of moral sense had it      not been backed by the sentiment of fear and jealousy. This is      clearly proved by the fact that feelings have reached their      highest point of intensity where this latter element loomed      largest. The Bulgarians have exhibited a degree of self-control      which is in marked contrast with the conduct of other Allies.      This equanimity is the more surprising in view of the fact that      the position of Bulgaria is well-nigh desperate. For months      past, the brunt of the war has fallen almost entirely on her. On      every side she is surrounded by an atmosphere of open hostility.      By threats of invasion, Roumania has wrung from her a ransom for      the Balkan victories, while in Macedonia her allies are      preparing to dispute her lawful share and have massed against      her their whole armies. So long as peace with Turkey is not      signed she must remain immobilised in front of Chatalja and      Bulair. For a parallel case one must go back to the dark hours      of Prussia during the Seven Years' War. But in the midst of all      these difficulties Bulgaria has kept a cool head, whereas public      opinion in Servia and Greece has parted company with all      reason. It is not indifference to the issues at stake which      explains this placid demeanour. When the proper time arrives,      the Bulgarians will be found tough bargainers and determined to      claim their full due. They know, however, that the position of      their country as prime factor in the Balkans cannot be seriously      affected by the results of the allotment. Even before the war,      the supremacy of Bulgaria was hardly questioned, and the      formation of the Balkan League would have been impossible but      for this acquiescence in her right to leadership. With the      disappearance of Turkey, this predominance is bound to be      further accentuated and henceforth will have to be reckoned with      as a political axiom.        The reasons which have enabled Bulgaria to envisage the future      with tranquillity are for her allies a source of uneasiness.      Servia and Greece have long watched the rapid and uninterrupted      progress of their pushful neighbour with mixed feelings of fear      and envy. Her seniors in point of time, they have been      outdistanced in the race for Balkan hegemony. In 1885 Servia      made a desperate attempt at grappling with the problem, but had      no reason to be satisfied with the results. The doctrine of      Balkan equilibrium was buried at Slivnitza, and since then      Servia has had to rest contented with a secondary place. But the      galling memory of defeat had never died out and probably plays      in the present anti-Bulgarian agitation a larger part than most      Servians realise or would care to admit.        Antagonism between Greeks and Bulgarians is a legacy of the      past. Their history is a long record of ceaseless struggle. When      they could no longer war as freemen, the feud was transferred to      ecclesiastical ground and there continued under the mocking eye      of their new masters. Since their restoration to independent      life, they have not been able to revert to the old tradition      owing to Turkey's presence as buffer state. This involuntary      truce, however, has not turned hatred into love. They are once      more to have a common frontier and will thus be brought in      direct contact.        ... The war has widened the gulf between these races by adding      to the old stock of animosities a fresh supply of military      jealousies. It has let loose over the entire Peninsula a flood      of vanity which has upset the balance of a good many heads. A      year ago, no sane Servian would have dreamed of pitting his      country against Bulgaria, and this recognition of inferiority      stood for peace. Now, every Servian officer is convinced that      the result of such a trial of forces would be favourable to      Servia, just as he is persuaded that the issues of the war with      Turkey have been decided mainly by Servian valour....        If this is the way in which Servians are wearing their laurels,      it can be imagined what the effect of recent events has been on      impressionable Greece. To the trepidation with which the war was      entered has succeeded the feeling of boundless self-reliance.      All sense of reality and proportion has been banished, and there      is no exploit which seems beyond the reach of Greek effort.        The outbreak of a fresh Balkan war would, in the present      circumstances, prove little short of a world-wide calamity.      Should, however, Europe succeed in localising such a conflict,      its miseries will, to a certain extent, be compensated by one      very important advantage. A trial of forces between the various      Balkan competitors will clear the atmosphere and settle in the      only efficacious way the sore problem of Balkan hegemony, which      is at the bottom of Balkan unrest. It will fix for a long term      of years the respective positions of the parties. Just as the      Servo-Bulgarian War in 1885 proved a blessing in disguise, so      this time also the arbitrament of the sword might create      conditions more favourable to the political stability of the      Peninsula. And this will be a gain not only to the Balkan      nations, but to the whole of Europe.    The last thing of which that Bulgarian writer dreamt was the actual  result of the fresh Balkan war, which did break out and which ended in  the humiliation of Bulgaria. He contemplated the necessity of palliating  to European minds the enormity of a fratricidal war between allies who  had sanctioned their war against Turkey as a struggle of the Cross  against the Crescent; but he had no idea that there was the barest  possibility that Bulgaria would have to suffer complete defeat instead  of explaining victory.    The Conference of London which endeavoured to arrange a peace after the  first phase of the Balkan war met first in December 1913. I watched  closely its deliberations, had several friends among the delegates, and  was in a position to see at close hand the play of jealousies and  ambitions which made its work futile. From the first the very  desperation of Turkey raised a difficulty to quick peace negotiations.  She had lost so much as to be practically bankrupt, and was in the  position of a reckless man with no more possible losses to suffer,  anxious by any expedient to postpone the day of payment in the hope that  something would turn up in his favour. That anything should turn up  seemed in reason impossible, but Oriental fatalism despises reason; and  in this case Oriental fatalism was right judged by the final event.    The sessions of the London Conference found a vividly contrasting  setting in London. (In Constantinople the meetings would have had an  appropriate stage.) It was a contest of Oriental against semi-Oriental  diplomacy; and staid British officials, who had duties in connection  with the Conference, lived for weeks in an atmosphere of bewilderment,  wondering if they were still in the twentieth century or had wandered  back to the Bagdad of the Middle Ages.    The first effort of the Turkish delegates was to gain time. On any point  that arose they wanted instructions from their government and pressed  for an adjournment. When, after a few days, the Conference assembled  again, the instructions had not arrived, and there was need for another  adjournment. At the next meeting the instructions had arrived; but they  were written so illegibly that they could not be deciphered, and so  there was another adjournment. (This illegible despatches excuse had not  even the merit of being novel--it was used many years before in an  Egyptian negotiation.) To the desperate attempts of the Turks to waste  time the diplomats of the Balkan States replied with but little patience  or suavity. They did not recognise fully that they were present at a  death-bed, and that the patient had some excuse for taking an  unconscionable time in dying. Their patience was not increased by the  knowledge of the fact that the time secured by these evasive excuses was  being used in desperate attempts to sow dissensions among the allies and  to beat up support in some European capital for the forlorn Turkish  Empire.    It was over the question of the cession of Adrianople to Bulgaria that  the chief trouble arose, and the Turkish delegates made a great point of  the fact that at Adrianople was the parent mosque of Islam in Europe and  the burial-place of the first Sultans. This plea for their holy places  aroused some sympathy in Europe. I suggested to Dr. Daneff, the chief  Bulgarian delegate to the Conference, that he should allow me to  publish that Bulgaria would allow the Turks to retain the holy places in  Adrianople as an extra-territorial area under the control of the Moslem  Caliph. Dr. Daneff liked the proposal, but at first would only allow it  to go out as an unofficial hint that probably Bulgaria would consent to  such an arrangement. Then, finding that the concession was popular, he  fathered it directly, and it was made one of the terms of peace which  the Powers tried to force upon Turkey.    Peace seemed assured when finally the Turkish Porte agreed, under  pressure from the Powers, to a Treaty of Peace, which left to Turkey on  the European mainland only the territory lying south and east from a  line drawn between Media, on the Black Sea, to Rodosto on the Sea of  Marmora. But a revolution in Turkey upset this arrangement,"]]]
