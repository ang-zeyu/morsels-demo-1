He appears never to have quitted the child by night or day,  except when it was necessary to go for its food, and then he was always  seen running at full speed to and from the cottage.    The memory of the dog Gelert has been preserved by tradition, and  celebrated in poetry. In the neighborhood of a village at the foot of  Snowdon, a mountain in Wales, Llewellyn, son-in-law to King John, had a  residence. The king, it is said, had presented him with one of the  finest greyhounds in England, named Gelert. In the year 1205, Llewellyn  one day, on going out to hunt, called all his dogs together; but his  favorite greyhound was missing, and nowhere to be found. He blew his  horn as a signal for the chase, and still Gelert came not. Llewellyn  was much disconcerted at the heedlessness of his favorite, but at  length pursued the chase without him. For want of Gelert the sport was  limited; and, getting tired, he returned home at an early hour, when  the first object that presented itself to him at the castle gate was  Gelert, who bounded with the usual transport to meet his master, having  his lips besmeared with blood. Llewellyn gazed with surprise at the  unusual appearance of his dog.    On going into the apartment where he had left his infant son and heir  asleep, he found the bed-clothes all in confusion, the cover rent and  stained with blood. He called on his child, but no answer was made,  from which he hastily concluded that the dog must have devoured him;  and, giving vent to his rage, plunged his sword to the hilt in Gelert's  side. The noble animal fell at his feet, uttering a dying yell which  awoke the infant, who was sleeping beneath a mingled heap of the  bed-clothes, while beneath the bed lay a great wolf covered with gore,  whom the faithful and gallant hound had destroyed. Llewellyn, smitten  with sorrow and remorse for the rash and frantic deed which had  deprived him of so faithful an animal, caused an elegant marble  monument, with an appropriate inscription, to be erected over the spot  where Gelert was buried, to commemorate his fidelity and unhappy fate.  The place to this day is called Beth-Gelert, or the Grave of the  Greyhound.        \"Here never could the spearman pass,        Or forester, unmoved;      Here oft the tear-besprinkled grass        Llewellyn's sorrow proved.      And here he hung his horn and spear,        And oft, as evening fell,      In fancy's piercing sounds would hear        Poor Gelert's dying yell.\"    The bull-dog would appear the least likely to combat with a heavy sea,  and yet the following circumstances are well authenticated: On board a  ship, which struck upon a rock near the shore, there were three dogs,  two of the Newfoundland variety, and one a small but firmly-built  English bull-dog. It was important to have a rope carried ashore, and  it was thought that one of the Newfoundland dogs might succeed; but he  was not able to struggle with the waves, and perished; and the other  Newfoundland dog, being thrown over with the rope, shared the same  fate. But the bull-dog, though not habituated to the water, swam  triumphantly to land, and thus saved the lives of the persons on board.  Among them was his master, a military officer, who still has the dog in  his possession.    Among the instances of sagacity, mingled with an affection for its  master, may be mentioned those cases in which the dog notices or  detects thefts, and restores lost or stolen articles to its master. An  acquaintance of Lord Fife's coachman had put a bridle belonging to the  earl in his pocket, and would have abstracted it, had he not been  stopped by a Highland cur, that observed him, barked at him, and  absolutely bit his leg. This was unusual conduct in the dog; but the  wonder of the servants ceased when they saw the end of the bridle  peeping out of the visitor's pocket; and it being delivered up, the dog  became quiet. It is well known that in London, the other year, a box,  properly directed, was sent to a merchant's shop to lie there all  night, and be shipped off with other goods next morning, and that a  dog, which accidentally came into the shop with a customer, by his  smelling it, and repeatedly barking in a peculiar way, led to the  discovery that the box contained not goods, but a rogue who intended to  admit his companions and plunder the shop in the night-time.    A man who frequented the _Pont Neuf_ in Paris, and whose business it  was to brush the boots of persons passing by, taught his dog, which was  a poodle, to roll himself in the mud, and then brush by gentlemen so as  to soil their boots. In this way, the animal largely contributed to  support the trade of his master.    There were two friends--one living in London, the other at Guildford.  These were on terms of the greatest intimacy, and for many years it had  been the custom of the London family to pass the Christmas with the one  at Guildford. Their usual practice was to arrive to dinner the day  before, and they were always accompanied by a large spaniel, who was as  great a favorite of the visited as of the visitors.    At the end of about seven years, the two families had an unfortunate  misunderstanding, which occasioned an omission of the usual Christmas  invitation. About an hour before dinner, the Guildford gentleman, who  was standing at the window, exclaimed to his wife, \"Well, my dear, the  W.'s have thought better of it, for I declare they are coming as usual,  although we did not invite them; for here comes Caesar to announce  them;\" and the dog came trotting up to the door, and was admitted, as  usual, into the parlor.    The lady of the house gave orders to prepare beds; dinner waited an  hour; but no guests arrived. Caesar, having staid the exact number of  days to which he had been accustomed, set off for home, and reached it  in safety. The correspondence which subsequently occurred had the happy  effect of renewing the intercourse of the estranged friends; and as  long as Caesar lived, he paid the annual visit in company with his  master and mistress.    A terrier, belonging to the Marchioness of Stafford, having lost a  litter of puppies, was quite disconsolate, till, perceiving a brood of  young ducks, she immediately seized them, and carried them to her lair,  where she kept them, following them out and in, and nursing them in her  own way with the most affectionate anxiety. When the ducklings, obeying  their instinct, went into the water, their foster-mother exhibited the  utmost alarm, and as soon as they returned to land, she snatched them  up, one by one, in her mouth, and ran home with them.    The next year, the same animal, being again deprived of her puppies,  seized two cock chickens, which she reared with infinite care. When  they began to crow, their foster-mother was as much annoyed as she had  been with the swimming of the young ducks, and never failed to repress  their attempts at crowing.    A man engaged in smuggling lace into France from Flanders, trained an  active and sagacious spaniel to aid him in his enterprise. He caused  him to be shaved, and procured for him the skin of another dog of the  same hair and the same shape. He then rolled the lace round the body of  the dog, and put over it the other skin so adroitly that the trick  could not be easily discovered. The lace being thus arranged, the  smuggler would say to the docile messenger, \"Homeward, my friend.\" At  these words, the dog would start, and pass boldly through the gates of  Malines and Valenciennes in the face of the vigilant officers placed  there to prevent smuggling.    Having thus passed the bounds, he would await his master at a little  distance in the open country. There they mutually caressed and feasted,  and the merchant placed his rich package in a place of security,  renewing his occupation as occasion required. Such was the success of  this smuggler, that, in less than five years, he amassed a handsome  fortune, and kept his coach.    Envy pursues the prosperous. A mischievous neighbor at length betrayed  the lace merchant; notwithstanding all his efforts to disguise the dog,  he was suspected, watched, and discovered. But the cunning of the dog  was equal to the emergency. Did the spies of the custom-house expect  him at one gate, he saw them at a distance, and ran to another; were  all the gates shut against him, he overcame every obstacle; sometimes  he leaped over the wall; at others, passing secretly behind a carriage,  or running between the legs of travellers, he would thus accomplish his  aim. One day, however, while swimming a stream near Malines, he was  shot, and died in the water. There was then about him five thousand  crowns' worth of lace--the loss of which did not afflict his master,  but he was inconsolable for the loss of his faithful dog.    A dog belonging to a chamois-hunter, being on the glaciers in  Switzerland, with an Englishman and his master, observed the former  approaching one of the crevices in the ice, to look into it. He began  to slide towards the edge; his guide, with a view to save him, caught  his coat, and both slid onward, till the dog seized his master's  clothes, and preserved them both from inevitable death.    Dogs have a capacity to act upon excitements of an artificial nature. A  dog, in Paris, at the commencement of the revolution, was known to  musicians by the name of Parade, because he regularly attended the  military at the Tuileries, stood by and marched with the band. At night  he went to the opera, and dined with any musician who intimated, by  word or gesture, that his company was asked; yet always withdrew from  any attempt to be made the property of any individual.    The Penny Magazine furnishes a still more singular instance of the  desire of excitement, in a dog which, for several years, was always  present at the fires in London. Some years ago, a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33721"],[0,"The Barren Ground Caribou of Keewatin (#18)"],[1,". In the case of the Reindeer, the fly's eggs are laid (during  the summer) generally on the legs, belly, and tail region of the victim;  the larvae, on hatching, bore through the skin, travel widely through  the body, and finally (in the autumn) reach the place for further  development--beneath the skin of the back on both sides of the vertebral  column. Each one makes a breathing-hole through the skin, and uses this  as an exit when leaving the host in the following June. Only the younger  animals, from one to about four or five years old, are heavily infested;  those still older are spared, possibly having learned to guard  themselves better against the fly. Curiously enough, the fawns are said  to escape this parasitism entirely.    My own observations on the larvae were restricted to a few Caribou  specimens in June and in the autumn. As with the Reindeer, the Caribou  fawns in their first autumn showed no visible infestation, as I noted in  looking over some fresh hides on September 10, and as was noted again in  a fawn of September 26. Fred Schweder, Jr., made the remark that larvae  would be evident in the fawns by the following spring; this may indicate  that the larvae have not, in the autumn, completed their journey to  their final position on the Caribou's back. I learned of no immunity on  the part of old adults.    Fullgrown larvae still remained in bucks secured on June 3 (fig. 17) and  18. According to Charles Schweder, they drop out in June. In the buck of  June 3 there were perhaps several dozen warbles, each surrounded by a  mass of repulsive tissue; in another buck of June 18, there were  apparently more than 75. \"It may be assumed,\" says Johansen (1921: 24),  \"that the pupae lie on the ground for about a month before the flies  appear.\" He found (1921: 29) the adult flies abroad at Dolphin and Union  Strait by July 14.    In a buck of August 17 the new warbles (or perhaps merely warble scars  from the previous June--_cf._ Banfield, 1951a: 32) on the inside of  the skin were not very numerous. Some were medium-sized, but most were  so small that it was not deemed necessary to scrape them off; they had  comparatively little fatty tissue about them and were merely allowed to  dry up. The number of warbles (or warble scars) found in autumn  specimens varied considerably, up to a maximum of roughly 200. They were  situated mostly along the mid-dorsum, and more on the lower back or rump  than farther forward. The number appeared to be approximately 130 in the  skin of an adult doe that was nailed to the log wall of a cabin for  drying on September 15 (fig. 18). A doe of September 21 seemed to have  less than the usual number of warbles.    The nostril fly (_Cephenemyia_) is another serious dipterous parasite of  the Caribou. The life history of the European _C. nasalis_ (L.) (or  _C. trompe_ [L.]) and its effect on Reindeer are discussed by Bergman  (1917), Natvig (1918), and Jacobi (1931: 245) as follows.    This fly attacks the host from June to September, depositing its  viviparous larvae in the nostrils. The Reindeer attempts to fend off the  fly, striking at it with its hoofs and keeping its nostrils closed as  far as possible. Once deposited, the lively larvae crawl into the inner  nasal passages and as far as the larynx, where they fasten themselves  and live on the mucus. A Reindeer may harbor as many as 130 of these  parasites. They range from 6 to 26 mm. in length. Their particular  growth begins at the end of March, and they are ready for pupation up to  May. The host assists their exit by continual sneezing and snuffling. In  the last stages they are a great affliction for the host, and they  sometimes cause its death. Pupation takes place in or on the ground,  under some sort of cover, and it lasts for 15-19 days. The flies have  been found emerging from July 12 to 31.    The corresponding parasite of the Barren Ground Caribou is a similar or  perhaps identical species, with a parallel life history. Its chief  activity as an adult doubtless occurs in July and August. A number of  the mature larvae were found in the throat of the buck of June 3; two of  them that were preserved measure approximately 7 mm. in diameter and 27  and 30 mm. in length. A large mass of such sizable parasites in the  throat might easily become a serious obstacle to comfortable living or  even to survival on the part of the host. Presumably the larvae drop to  the ground at about the same period as those of _Oedemagena_. Fred  Schweder, Jr., remarked concerning the buck of August 17 that these  larvae are never found at that season, and Charles Schweder made the  same remark concerning a doe specimen of September 21. It would appear  either that they remain so small as to escape detection at this time or  that they do not reach the throat on their short journey from the  nostrils until some later period of the year. Johansen (1921: 24)  records larvae only 2-3 mm. long in the nasal passage at the end of May.    Since the bulk of the Caribou population has passed well to the  northward of the Nueltin Lake region by the time the larvae of  _Oedemagena_ and _Cephenemyia_ drop out of the bodies of their hosts to  pupate briefly on or in the ground (say in the latter part of June), one  is tempted to speculate on the possibility that the adult flies found  here in August may have followed their prospective victims for many  miles in their southward migration. However, Porsild remarks (1943: 386)  that they \"apparently do not travel very far.\"    Certain kinds of behavior exhibited by the Caribou in attempting to fend  off the parasitic flies are discussed in the section on _Shaking off  moisture and insects_.    The adults of _Oedemagena tarandi_ (L.) were determined by Mr. C. W.  Sabrosky, of the Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine; and the  larvae of _Oedemagena_ and _Cephenemyia_ by Dr. W. W. Wirth, of the same  bureau. The larvae of the latter genus are regarded as probably _C.  trompe_ (L.); they were new to the collection of the United States  National Museum.      _References._--Hearne, 1795: 197; Franklin, 1823: 241;    Richardson, \"1825\": 328-330, and 1829: 242; Godman, 1831, +2+:    284; Murray, 1858: 210; B. R.

The Schweder boys spoke of never having noticed  any such parasites. Seton (1929) mentions none, and Jacobi (1931: 243)  records only a louse (_Linognathus tarandi_) from the Reindeer. \"Lice  are not known from caribou according to Ferris (in conversation)\"  (Weber, 1950: 154).      _Relations to Reindeer_    Recent discussions of the possibility or advisability of introducing  domesticated Reindeer to replace, or to augment the diminishing supply  of, native American Caribou in various new localities prompt a brief  review of the subject.    It may be remarked at the outset that acclimatization attempts in the  Old World have generally been abortive. Wild Reindeer introduced from  Finmark into Iceland in the eighteenth century flourished for a time,  but by 1917 they were almost exterminated. A number of different  introductions into Great Britain, Denmark, Germany, Austria,  Switzerland, and Italy came to naught. On the other hand, the  introduction of Lapland Reindeer on the subantarctic island of South  Georgia in 1908 seems to have turned out successfully. (Jacobi, 1931:  158-165; Harper, 1945: 473-474.) A saving feature in each of the  above-mentioned cases was the absence of any native Reindeer whose  racial purity might have been destroyed by the newcomers.    Decrease of local American stocks of Caribou, and consequent suffering  of native populations who had in past generations depended upon these  animals for a major portion of their food supply, have led to  introduction of foreign Reindeer in several regions of North America,  from Newfoundland and Labrador in the east to Alaska in the west. The  persons responsible were doubtless inspired by high humanitarian  motives; but it is doubtful if they could have thoroughly considered or  foreseen the serious biological consequences of their efforts.    In Alaska, importation of domesticated Siberian Reindeer began in 1892.  By the 1930's the herds had increased to an estimated total of 600,000.  For various reasons, however, the industry has so far declined that by  1949 the total number of Alaskan Reindeer had become reduced to about  28,000 head. Disinclination of Eskimos for reindeer-herding and mixture  of their stock with wild Caribou were important reasons for this  decline. (Lantis, 1950.) From the biologist's point of view, the most  unfortunate result was the large-scale interbreeding with the native  Grant's Caribou (_Rangifer arcticus granti_) and the progressive  extermination of that fine animal in a pure form by dilution with  inferior alien blood. Among Alaskan Reindeer, \"constant inbreeding has  led to a noticeable "]]]
