Now the method of cleaning, is by \"rotting\"  rather than scraping or boiling. Take the skull (or whole head) and  fix it solid in some can or jar, then fill it, or cover with water  and put away for three or four weeks. At the end of that time, pour  off the water and the bulk of the flesh will go too. Fill in with  clear water again, and repeat as often as necessary. I have found  that twice will do the work, and leave the bone in good condition.    There is a market for most animal skulls, if not damaged, and it may  pay to preserve all. In the Hunter-Trader-Trapper, published at  Columbus, Ohio, usually will be found advertisements of parties who  buy them.      * * *    I have never had much luck with two-piece stretchers, but use thin  board stretchers in one piece with a \"sword stick\" on each side to  fully stretch and admit the air to both sides of the skin. This cures  the skin faster and better than when only one side is exposed to the  air, says a Maryland trapper.      [Illustration: POLE STRETCHERS.]    When off from home, I use stretchers made from saplings, as boards  suitable are not to be had everywhere, and cannot be bothered with  when going light. To make these, cut osier, willow or hickory  switches, straight and thick as the finger, about four feet long; cut  two short pieces for rats 4 and 6 inches long and carefully bending  the long piece. Nail these in with a small wire nail at each end. A  handful of shingle or lath nails and a clump of osier sprouts will  make a full outfit of stretchers for a temporary camp.      * * *    I know it is as much value in stretching your furs and preparing them  for market as it is in trapping, writes a trapper. If you have no  boards, go to your grocer or dry goods store and you can get all the  boxes you want for 5 or 10 cents apiece. They must not be over 3/8 of  an inch thick; if they are, plane them down smooth on both sides.    I make what I call the two piece stretcher with a wedge for muskrats.  Take a board 20 inches long, 3/8 inch thick, 6 inches wide large end,  2 1/2 inches small end. Taper back 5 inches from small end. Now take  block plane and chaffer off each side an inch or more up and round it  off. Round and chaffer small end the same, almost to an edge. Now  draw a line thru the center of the board and saw it thru.    Make a wedge the same length and thickness, 3/8 of an inch wide and  tapering down to 1/10 of an inch. If a large skin, push it in between  the halves. Bore a hole in large end and hang up in a cool ventilated  place to dry. After three days pull out wedge, and your fur will slip  right off without tearing. If the boards should warp over, tack a  strip across the large end.    The mink stretchers are made on the same plan. A board the same  thickness, 30 inches long, 3 1/2 inches wide, taper down 2 1/8 small  end round chaffer. For large mink insert wedge made one inch wide.  Taper down to 2/8. For skunk and coon they are also good, only they  are made on a larger scale.    Now a word about casing. Pull your hide on so the back is on one side  and the belly on the other. Pull nose over small end 1/2 inch. Put  two tacks on each side, now pull down tight to large end and put two  tacks each side, lay board on bench and take an old case knife,  scrape off all meat and fat and be careful not to scrape too thin, so  as not to cut the fibre of the skin. After you have scraped the flesh  off, insert the wedge and your skin will be tight. Do not stretch  your hide so it will make your fur look thin.      * * *    This is my way of stretching coon hide; use four-penny nails and use  either the inside or outside of some old building, inside is the  best. Drive the first nail thru nose. This holds the hide for  starting. Pull each forward leg up (not out) on a level with nose and  about seven or eight inches from nose according to size of the coon.  Drive next nail at root of tail, and pull down, moderately tight.    Now pull each hind leg out about one inch wider than the fore legs  and a little below the tail nail. Now use a nail every inch and pull  the hide up between the forward legs and nose, until it comes  straight across. Next, treat the bottom of the hide the same as the  top. Use plenty of nails. To finish down the sides, drive a nail  first on one side and then on the other until finished. You will find  when done that the hide is nearly square with no legs sticking out  the sides and no notches in the skin.        CHAPTER XXVI.    HANDLING AND GRADING.    MINK should be cased fur side in and stretched on boards for several  days or until dry.    SKUNK should be cased fur side in and stretched on boards for several  days. The white stripe cut out, blackened, etc., reduces the value.    RACCOON should be stretched open (ripped up the belly) and nailed on  boards or the inside of a building. Some dealers allow as much for  coon cased, from any section, while others prefer that only Southern  coon be cased.    FOXES of the various kinds should be cased and put on boards fur side  in for a few days, or until dry. As the pelt is thin they soon dry,  when they must be taken off and should be turned fur side out. In  shipping see that they are not packed against furs flesh side out.    LYNX should be cased and after drying properly are turned fur side  out, same as foxes.    OTTER are cased and stretched fur side in. The pelt being thick and  heavy, takes several days to dry properly. They are shipped flesh  side out. Sea otter are handled the same as fox, lynx and marten,  that is, fur side out.    BEAVER are split but stretched round and should be left in the hoop  or stretcher for several days.    BEAR should be handled open and stretched carefully. In skinning be  careful and leave nose, claws and ears on the hide.    WOLVES can be handled same as bear, also wolverine.    FISHER should be cased and stretched flesh side out, but may be sent  to market same as foxes or fur out.    MARTEN should be stretched and dried on boards, fur side in, but  turned as soon as dried.    OPOSSUM are stretched on boards fur side in and are left in that  condition after removing the boards. Cut the tails off when  skinning--they have no value.    MUSKRAT should be stretched fur side in and a few days on the boards  is sufficient. They are left as taken off, that is, fur side in. Cut  the tails off when skinning--they are worthless.    WEASEL should be cased, fur side in. The pelts are thin and soon dry.  Leave fur side in after taking off boards.    BADGER are split and should be nailed to the inside of a building to  dry.    CIVET CAT should be cased and stretched on boards fur side in. When  dry remove boards and leave fur side in.    RING TAIL CATS should be cased and after removing boards are  generally left fur side in for market.    WILD CAT are cased and stretched on boards. They may be turned fur  out or left as taken from the stretchers, fur side in.    HOUSE CAT are cased and stretched on boards fur side in. They are  sent to market usually fur side in.    RABBITS are cased fur in and, as the pelt is thin, soon dry. They are  shipped fur side in.    PANTHER are treated much the same as bear. Care should be taken in  skinning to leave claws, ears, nose, etc., on the skin for mounting  purposes.      * * *    My experience has been that the house which makes only four grades of  prime goods is the house that you will receive the largest checks  from for your collection, writes a Michigan collector of 50 years'  experience. So many grades quoted makes it possible for a firm to  successfully squelch you a little every time you ship and yet you can  have no reasonable excuse to complain for when you ship, you know  that in some houses there is a grade for nearly every skin you send.  So I, for one, would rather risk the fewer grades.    A trapper from Wisconsin says: For sample, say mink are worth from 25  cents to $3.00. There would be 275 prices between the extremes. Now  if he is a fur buyer I certainly pity the trappers that would have to  take those 275 different prices for their mink. A man should be able  to know the difference between grades No. 1, 2, 3 and 4, and when he  does he is then able to give a fair and honest price for every skin  he buys. If he doesn't know the difference then, he had better get a  job clerking in a hotel or sawing wood.      * * *    Many have requested that the difference in the various grades of  skins be explained and for their benefit, as well as others of little  experience, the following may prove instructive.    Raw furs are assorted into four grades, viz: No. 1, No. 2, No. 3 and  No. 4. With the exception of skunk and muskrat most houses subdivide  the No. 1 skins into large, medium and small. In addition to this  many firms quote a range of prices about as follows: Mink, Northern  New York, large $6.00 to $8.00. Would it not be more satisfactory to  quote one price only?    It is generally known that Minnesota mink are large. From that state  a No. 1 medium mink is as large as a No. 1 large from Maine, where  mink are rather small. But as the dealers on their price lists quote  the various states and sections, why not quote one price only as  follows:    MINK, NORTHERN NEW YORK, NO. 1.    Large,   Medium,  Small,  No. 2,   No. 3,   No. 4,  $7.00.   $5.00.   $3.00   $1.50.   $0.75.   $0.20    These figures, of course, are only given for illustration and are not  meant to show value.    Furs from the various parts of North America have their peculiar  characteristics and it is easy for the man of experience to tell in  what part of the country a pelt was caught. It may be shipped by a  collector hundreds of miles from where caught, but if there are many  in the collection the expert will soon detect it. This knowledge,  however, only comes with years of experience.    Prime skins are those caught during cold weather and the pelt after  drying"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34131"],[0,"Butterflies and Moths (British) (#18)"],[1," will be ready in a few days.' You can charge it yourself in a few  minutes if you can manage to keep a small supply of 'cyanide' in stock,  and it is ready for use very shortly after.    Here is the _modus operandi_.--Purchase an ounce or two of the cyanide  of potassium, and immediately put it into a stoppered or well-corked  bottle. Label it at once, not only with the name, but also with the word  POISON in very large and conspicuous letters. This dangerous chemical is  often sold in sticks that look much like certain 'sugar sticks' I was  acquainted with in my younger days; but whether this is or is not the  case with your cyanide, see that the bottle is kept quite out of the  reach of the inquisitive and sugar-loving juveniles of the house.    The quantity above mentioned is more than you will require for the first  'charge,' but you will soon experience the convenience of having a  supply always at hand for recharging when your cyanide bottle fails to  do its work expeditiously, or when an accident calls for the somewhat  sudden appearance of a new one.    Now procure a bottle for your work. Its mouth must be wide enough to  take the largest insect you hope to catch, and the widest part of the  bottle need not be much larger. Get a perfectly sound cork to fit it  tightly; and, to insure the more perfect exclusion of air, paint over  the top of the cork with melted paraffin wax.    Dissolve a few drams of the cyanide in a little water, using a glass rod  to stir up the mixture till the solid has all disappeared; and be  careful that neither the solid nor the solution touches the skin if it  should be in the slightest degree scratched or broken. Now sprinkle  plaster of Paris into the solution, a little at a time, and stir all the  while. As soon as the mixture begins to set, pour it into your bottle as  cleanly as you can--that is, without touching the sides--and press it  down with the flat end of a stick if it is not level. Now cork it, and  put the bottle away in a cool place till required for use.    This is, I think, the best way of charging the bottle; but there are two  other common methods that may, perhaps, be regarded as a little more  simple. One is this: put a few small lumps of the 'cyanide' into your  bottle, and then cover them with a stiff mixture of plaster of Paris and  water, and press down as before. The other plan is to cover the  'cyanide' with a few thicknesses of blotting paper, cut just a little  larger than the inside of the bottle. The first of these two methods is  fairly satisfactory, but I have always found that the charge, when made  in this way, has a tendency to become wet and pasty, in which condition  it will spoil the wings of the insects. The other is very objectionable,  especially for field work, for the blotting paper fails to keep its  place while you are on the chase. If the plaster is used, the mixing  must be done quickly and without hesitation, or the mixture will become  solid before you can press it into your bottle.    We will not enter now into the _pros_ and _cons_ of the cyanide bottle,  but will consider the advantages and disadvantages of the various  methods of killing the insects after we have noticed a few more.    The 'laurel box' has had many devoted advocates, although it does not  seem to be much in use now. It is a very good arrangement, however, but  is a little more troublesome than the cyanide bottle, as it requires  frequent replenishing.    A very good laurel box may be prepared as follows. Get a small tin box  of cylindrical form, measuring about five inches by two, and cut a  circle of perforated zinc or wood just the size to fit it snugly as a  false bottom without any danger of falling out of its place. Now gather  some of the young leaves of the green laurel bush, and beat them almost  to a pulp with a mallet or hammer. Place this in your tin box, and press  down the perforated false bottom on it. The bruised laurel leaves give  off a very powerful odour, which stupefies butterflies immediately.    [Illustration: FIG. 44.--SECTION OF THE LAUREL BOX.    _a_, space for insects; _b_, perforated partition; _c_, bruised laurel  leaves.]    Of course the reader may be able to think of various other ways in which  the laurel box may be made. Any arrangement will do providing the vapour  can come to the insects without allowing the leaves to touch their  wings; and any ingenious youth could manufacture a more satisfactory  article than the one I have mentioned. My desire is, as far as possible,  to give instructions that may easily be carried out by anyone, even if  he has not the slightest mechanical skill, leaving the clever youth,  sometimes, the opportunity of displaying his own inventive power. But in  this case I will give a few suggestions concerning other ways in which a  laurel killer may be constructed. A firm and _fixed_ false bottom is a  decided advantage. This is easily managed by fixing a circular piece of  perforated zinc or 'tin' by means of a little solder; or even a wood  partition may be used, fixed with a few brads, driven into it from the  outside. With the fixed partition, however, you must have a lid at each  end of the box. This is easily managed if you get two tins of the same  size, knock out the bottom of one, and fit the lid of the other in its  place.    I have heard of laurel boxes without any partition save a piece of rag  in which the bruised leaves are wrapped. The whole is _pressed_ into the  box so firmly that it is not likely to be displaced while you are on the  chase. I do not recommend this, for in addition to the chance of its  slipping there is a danger of the sap of the leaves exuding through the  rag and spoiling the insects' wings. But if the reader should prefer to  try this on account of its simplicity, it will probably occur to him  that a bottle may be used instead of a tin box.    A well-made laurel box, with a fixed metal partition, is a piece of  apparatus strongly to be recommended to all young entomologists who  desire to test the relative value of the various poisons that are used  by the different experts; for with it any one of these substances can be  used. In the poison compartment you can place pieces of 'cyanide'  wrapped in blotting paper, or any kind of porous substance moistened  with liquid ammonia, chloroform, benzole, or any other volatile liquid  insecticide. All the above-named substances are declared to be 'the  best,' so they must all be worth the trial.    'Cyanide' is valued on account of its lasting powers. A cyanide bottle  well charged will retain its efficiency throughout a whole season. I  always recharge two in the spring, one for active service in the field  and the other as a reserve force; and these kept in a cool place do good  execution throughout the year. If they should exhibit a slight failing,  a few minutes' warming before a fire will improve them; but for field  work it is better to recharge. At the same time see that the corks are  in good condition.    Next to the 'cyanide,' the bruised laurel takes the first rank for  permanency; but you must not expect this to last many days. For a few  days' continuous work one charge will suffice, but if the laurel box has  not been in use for some time you must have a fresh supply.    The liquid poisons, such as ammonia, chloroform, and benzole, are so  volatile that they are very powerful for a short time, but so much  vapour is lost each time the box is opened that it is absolutely  necessary to carry a bottle of the one you use into the field with you.  Also see that you have sufficient of the blotting paper or other  absorbent to prevent the liquid from leaking through the perforations of  the partition.    If you choose ammonia--a substance that is not regarded as a poison, and  is therefore easily obtained from any chemist--always get the strongest,  and see that it is labelled 'Liq. Ammonia, S.G. .880' as a guarantee. A  small bottle such as you can conveniently carry in the waistcoat pocket  will contain sufficient for a day's work. Use only a few drops at a  time, but renew frequently. Although the ammonia corrodes cork, yet a  good cork is far preferable for the pocket to a glass stopper, for its  elasticity prevents it from losing its hold, and the liquid from  saturating your pocket and its surroundings; but a glass stopper is  certainly better for the stock solution kept at home.    Most of the above remarks apply equally well to benzole and to  chloroform, but the latter is so powerful a poison that a very little is  required for a day's work, and consequently a very small bottle is more  convenient. The dealers in naturalist's appliances supply metal  'chloroform bottles' with screw stoppers and a small nozzle that will  allow the liquid to run out only in drops. This is a very good  arrangement, since it enables you to avoid the 'drop too much' which is  not only unnecessary and therefore wasteful, but saves you from  experiencing the disappointment of an empty bottle before your work is  half done.    [Illustration: FIG. 45.--THE CHLOROFORM BOTTLE.]    Some entomologists recommend the solid carbonate of ammonium instead of  liquid ammonia, but this is not so powerful. It must be remembered that  we have the butterflies to consider, as well as our own convenience, in  the selection of the poisons we use. It is the opinion of many  well-known entomologists that 'insects cannot feel pain,' and that we  are therefore at liberty to deal with them in any way we please. Still  it is as well to save all possible suffering, and be satisfied with no  killing box that is not practically instantaneous in its effects.    Among other poisons used by entomologists I may mention sulphur fumes  and tobacco smoke. The former may be obtained by burning a little  sulphur or a sulphured lucifer match under the perforations of a killing  box of the pattern described, and the latter--well, every smoker knows  that.
