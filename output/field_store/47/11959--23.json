Of course, it may be that, although they are      fine, tall, stalwart men, I am still a head and shoulders over the      tallest of them that I have yet seen.  I catch their eyes looking up      at me as though they were measuring me, even when they are keeping      away from me, or, rather, keeping me from them at arm's length.  I      suppose I shall understand what it all means some day.  In the      meantime there is nothing to do but to go on my own way--which is      Uncle Roger's--and wait and be patient and just.  I have learned the      value of that, any way, in my life amongst strange peoples.      Good-night.

MY DEAR AUNT JANET,        I am more than rejoiced to hear that you are coming here so soon.      This isolation is, I think, getting on my nerves.  I thought for a      while last night that I was getting on, but the reaction came all too      soon.  I was in my room in the east turret, the room on the      _corbeille_, and saw here and there men passing silently and swiftly      between the trees as though in secret.  By-and-by I located their      meeting-place, which was in a hollow in the midst of the wood just      outside the \"natural\" garden, as the map or plan of the castle calls      it.  I stalked that place for all I was worth, and suddenly walked      straight into the midst of them.  There were perhaps two or three      hundred gathered, about the very finest lot of men I ever saw in my      life.  It was in its way quite an experience, and one not likely to      be repeated, for, as I told you, in this country every man carries a      rifle, and knows how to use it.  I do not think I have seen a single      man (or married man either) without his rifle since I came here.  I      wonder if they take them with them to bed!  Well, the instant after I      stood amongst them every rifle in the place was aimed straight at me.      Don't be alarmed, Aunt Janet; they did not fire at me.  If they had I      should not be writing to you now.  I should be in that little bit of      real estate or the stone box, and about as full of lead as I could      hold.  Ordinarily, I take it, they would have fired on the instant;      that is the etiquette here.  But this time they--all separately but      all together--made a new rule.  No one said a word or, so far as I      could see, made a movement.  Here came in my own experience.  I had      been more than once in a tight place of something of the same kind,      so I simply behaved in the most natural way I could.  I felt      conscious--it was all in a flash, remember--that if I showed fear or      cause for fear, or even acknowledged danger by so much as even      holding up my hands, I should have drawn all the fire.  They all      remained stock-still, as though they had been turned into stone, for      several seconds.  Then a queer kind of look flashed round them like      wind over corn--something like the surprise one shows unconsciously      on waking in a strange place.  A second after they each dropped the      rifle to the hollow of his arm and stood ready for anything.  It was      all as regular and quick and simultaneous as a salute at St. James's      Palace.        Happily I had no arms of any kind with me, so that there could be no      complication.  I am rather a quick hand myself when there is any      shooting to be done.  However, there was no trouble here, but the      contrary; the Blue Mountaineers--it sounds like a new sort of Bond      Street band, doesn't it?--treated me in quite a different way than      they did when I first met them.  They were amazingly civil, almost      deferential.  But, all time same, they were more distant than ever,      and all the time I was there I could get not a whit closer to them.      They seemed in a sort of way to be afraid or in awe of me.  No doubt      that will soon pass away, and when we know one another better we      shall become close friends.  They are too fine fellows not to be      worth a little waiting for.  (That sentence, by the way, is a pretty      bad sentence!  In old days you would have slippered me for it!)  Your      journey is all arranged, and I hope you will be comfortable.  Rooke      will meet you at Liverpool Street and look after everything.        I shan't write again, but when we meet at Fiume I shall begin to tell      you all the rest.  Till then, good-bye.  A good journey to you, and a      happy meeting to us both.                                                                       RUPERT.    _Letter from Janet MacKelpie_, _Vissarion_, _to Sir Colin MacKelpie_,  _United Service Club_, _London_.                                                          _February_ 28, 1907.        DEAREST UNCLE,        I had a very comfortable journey all across Europe.  Rupert wrote to      me some time ago to say that when I got to Vissarion I should be an      Empress, and he certainly took care that on the way here I should be      treated like one.  Rooke, who seems a wonderful old man, was in the      next compartment to that reserved for me.  At Harwich he had      everything arranged perfectly, and so right on to Fiume.  Everywhere      there were attentive officials waiting.  I had a carriage all to      myself, which I joined at Antwerp--a whole carriage with a suite of      rooms, dining-room, drawing-room, bedroom, even bath-room.  There was      a cook with a kitchen of his own on board, a real chef like a French      nobleman in disguise.  There were also a waiter and a servant-maid.      My own maid Maggie was quite awed at first.  We were as far as      Cologne before she summoned up courage to order them about.  Whenever      we stopped Rooke was on the platform with local officials, and kept      the door of my carriage like a sentry on duty.        At Fiume, when the train slowed down, I saw Rupert waiting on the      platform.  He looked magnificent, towering over everybody there like      a giant.  He is in perfect health, and seemed glad to see me.  He      took me off at once on an automobile to a quay where an electric      launch was waiting.  This took us on board a beautiful big      steam-yacht, which was waiting with full steam up and--how he got      there I don't know--Rooke waiting at the gangway.        I had another suite all to myself.  Rupert and I had dinner      together--I think the finest dinner I ever sat down to.  This was      very nice of Rupert, for it was all for me.  He himself only ate a      piece of steak and drank a glass of water.  I went to bed early, for,      despite the luxury of the journey, I was very tired.        I awoke in the grey of the morning, and came on deck.  We were close      to the coast.  Rupert was on the bridge with the Captain, and Rooke      was acting as pilot.  When Rupert saw me, he ran down the ladder and      took me up on the bridge.  He left me there while he ran down again      and brought me up a lovely fur cloak which I had never seen.  He put      it on me and kissed me.  He is the tenderest-hearted boy in the      world, as well as the best and bravest!  He made me take his arm      whilst he pointed out Vissarion, towards which we were steering.  It      is the most lovely place I ever saw.  I won't stop to describe it      now, for it will be better that you see it for yourself and enjoy it      all fresh as I did.        The Castle is an immense place.  You had better ship off, as soon as      all is ready here and you can arrange it, the servants whom I      engaged; and I am not sure that we shall not want as many more.      There has hardly been a mop or broom on the place for centuries, and      I doubt if it ever had a thorough good cleaning all over since it was      built.  And, do you know, Uncle, that it might be well to double that      little army of yours that you are arranging for Rupert?  Indeed, the      boy told me himself that he was going to write to you about it.  I      think old Lachlan and his wife, Sandy's Mary, had better be in charge      of the maids when they come over.  A lot of lassies like yon will be      iller to keep together than a flock of sheep.  So it will be wise to      have authority over them, especially as none of them speaks a word of      foreign tongues.  Rooke--you saw him at the station at Liverpool      Street--will, if he be available, go over to bring the whole body      here.  He has offered to do it if I should wish.  And, by the way, I      think it will be well, when the time comes for their departure, if      not only the lassies, but Lachlan and Sandy's Mary, too, will call      him _Mister_ Rooke.  He is a very important person indeed here.  He      is, in fact, a sort of Master of the Castle, and though he is very      self-suppressing, is a man of rarely fine qualities.  Also it will be      well to keep authority.  When your clansmen come over, he will have      charge of them, too.  Dear me!  I find I have written such a long      letter, I must stop and get to work.  I shall write again.                                                        Your very affectionate                                                                      JANET.    _From the Same to the Same_.                                                              _March_ 3, 1907.        DEAREST UNCLE,        All goes well here, and as there is no news, I only write because you      are a dear, and I want to thank you for all the trouble you have      taken for me--and for Rupert.

Now that his two sons perished in one day,  Brother by brother murderously slain,  By right of kinship to the Princes dead,  I claim and hold the throne and sovereignty.  Yet 'tis no easy matter to discern  The temper of a man, his mind and will,  Till he be proved by exercise of power;  And in my case, if one who reigns supreme  Swerve from the highest policy, tongue-tied  By fear of consequence, that man I hold,  And ever held, the basest of the base.  And I contemn the man who sets his friend  Before his country.  For myself, I call  To witness Zeus, whose eyes are everywhere,  If I perceive some mischievous design  To sap the State, I will not hold my tongue;  Nor would I reckon as my private friend  A public foe, well knowing that the State  Is the good ship that holds our fortunes all:  Farewell to friendship, if she suffers wreck.  Such is the policy by which I seek  To serve the Commons and conformably  I have proclaimed an edict as concerns  The sons of Oedipus; Eteocles  Who in his country's battle fought and fell,  The foremost champion--duly bury him  With all observances and ceremonies  That are the guerdon of the heroic dead.  But for the miscreant exile who returned  Minded in flames and ashes to blot out  His father's city and his father's gods,  And glut his vengeance with his kinsmen's blood,  Or drag them captive at his chariot wheels--  For Polyneices 'tis ordained that none  Shall give him burial or make mourn for him,  But leave his corpse unburied, to be meat  For dogs and carrion crows, a ghastly sight.  So am I purposed; never by my will  Shall miscreants take precedence of true men,  But all good patriots, alive or dead,  Shall be by me preferred and honored.    CHORUS  Son of Menoeceus, thus thou will'st to deal  With him who loathed and him who loved our State.  Thy word is law; thou canst dispose of us  The living, as thou will'st, as of the dead.    CREON  See then ye execute what I ordain.    CHORUS  On younger shoulders lay this grievous charge.    CREON  Fear not, I've posted guards to watch the corpse.    CHORUS  What further duty would'st thou lay on us?    CREON  Not to connive at disobedience.    CHORUS  No man is mad enough to court his death.    CREON  The penalty _is_ death:  yet hope of gain  Hath lured men to their ruin oftentimes.  [Enter GUARD]    GUARD  My lord, I will not make pretense to pant  And puff as some light-footed messenger.  In sooth my soul beneath its pack of thought  Made many a halt and turned and turned again;  For conscience plied her spur and curb by turns.  \"Why hurry headlong to thy fate, poor fool?\"  She whispered.  Then again, \"If Creon learn  This from another, thou wilt rue it worse.\"  Thus leisurely I hastened on my road;  Much thought extends a furlong to a league.  But in the end the forward voice prevailed,  To face thee.  I will speak though I say nothing.  For plucking courage from despair methought,  'Let the worst hap, thou canst but meet thy fate.'    CREON  What is thy news?  Why this despondency?    GUARD  Let me premise a word about myself?  I neither did the deed nor saw it done,  Nor were it just that I should come to harm.    CREON  Thou art good at parry, and canst fence about  Some matter of grave import, as is plain.    GUARD  The bearer of dread tidings needs must quake.    CREON  Then, sirrah, shoot thy bolt and get thee gone.    GUARD  Well, it must out; the corpse is buried; someone  E'en now besprinkled it with thirsty dust,  Performed the proper ritual--and was gone.    CREON  What say'st thou?  Who hath dared to do this thing?    GUARD  I cannot tell, for there was ne'er a trace  Of pick or mattock--hard unbroken ground,  Without a scratch or rut of chariot wheels,  No sign that human hands had been at work.  When the first sentry of the morning watch  Gave the alarm, we all were terror-stricken.  The corpse had vanished, not interred in earth,  But strewn with dust, as if by one who sought  To avert the curse that haunts the unburied dead:  Of hound or ravening jackal, not a sign.  Thereat arose an angry war of words;  Guard railed at guard and blows were like to end it,  For none was there to part us, each in turn  Suspected, but the guilt brought home to none,  From lack of evidence.  We challenged each  The ordeal, or to handle red-hot iron,  Or pass through fire, affirming on our oath  Our innocence--we neither did the deed  Ourselves, nor know who did or compassed it.  Our quest was at a standstill, when one spake  And bowed us all to earth like quivering reeds,  For there was no gainsaying him nor way  To escape perdition:  _Ye_are_bound_to_tell_  _The_King,_ye_cannot_hide_it; so he spake.  And he convinced us all; so lots were cast,  And I, unlucky scapegoat, drew the prize.  So here I am unwilling and withal  Unwelcome; no man cares to hear ill news.    CHORUS  I had misgivings from the first, my liege,  Of something more than natural at work.    CREON  O cease, you vex me with your babblement;  I am like to think you dote in your old age.  Is it not arrant folly to pretend  That gods would have a thought for this dead man?  Did they forsooth award him special grace,  And as some benefactor bury him,  Who came to fire their hallowed sanctuaries,  To sack their shrines, to desolate their land,  And scout their ordinances?  Or perchance  The gods bestow their favors on the bad.  No! no! I have long noted malcontents  Who wagged their heads, and kicked against the yoke,  Misliking these my orders, and my rule.  'Tis they, I warrant, who suborned my guards  By bribes.  Of evils current upon earth  The worst is money.  Money 'tis that sacks  Cities, and drives men forth from hearth and home;  Warps and seduces native innocence,  And breeds a habit of dishonesty.  But they who sold themselves shall find their greed  Out-shot the mark, and rue it soon or late.  Yea, as I still revere the dread of Zeus,  By Zeus I swear, except ye find and bring  Before my presence here the very man  Who carried out this lawless burial,  Death for your punishment shall not suffice.  Hanged on a cross, alive ye first shall make  Confession of this outrage.  This will teach you  What practices are like to serve your turn.  There are some villainies that bring no gain.  For by dishonesty the few may thrive,  The many come to ruin and disgrace.    GUARD  May I not speak, or must I turn and go  Without a word?--    CREON                      Begone! canst thou not see  That e'en this question irks me?    GUARD                                     Where, my lord?  Is it thy ears that suffer, or thy heart?    CREON  Why seek to probe and find the seat of pain?    GUARD  I gall thine ears--this miscreant thy mind.    CREON  What an inveterate babbler! get thee gone!    GUARD  Babbler perchance, but innocent of the crime.    CREON  Twice guilty, having sold thy soul for gain.    GUARD  Alas! how sad when reasoners reason wrong.    CREON  Go, quibble with thy reason.  If thou fail'st  To find these malefactors, thou shalt own  The wages of ill-gotten gains is death.  [Exit CREON]    GUARD  I pray he may be found.  But caught or not  (And fortune must determine that) thou never  Shalt see me here returning; that is sure.  For past all hope or thought I have escaped,  And for my safety owe the gods much thanks.    CHORUS  (Str. 1)  Many wonders there be, but naught more wondrous than man;  Over the surging sea, with a whitening south wind wan,  Through the foam of the firth, man makes his perilous way;  And the eldest of deities Earth that knows not toil nor decay  Ever he furrows and scores, as his team, year in year out,  With breed of the yoked horse, the ploughshare turneth about.    (Ant. 1)  The light-witted birds of the air, the beasts of the weald and the wood  He traps with his woven snare, and the brood of the briny flood.  Master of cunning he:  the savage bull, and the hart  Who roams the mountain free, are tamed by his infinite art;  And the shaggy rough-maned steed is broken to bear the bit.    (Str. 2)  Speech and the wind-swift speed of counsel and civic wit,  He hath learnt for himself all these; and the arrowy rain to fly  And the nipping airs that freeze, 'neath the open winter sky.  He hath provision for all: fell plague he hath learnt to endure;  Safe whate'er may befall: yet for death he hath found no cure.    (Ant. 2)  Passing the wildest flight thought are the cunning and skill,  That guide man now to the light, but now to counsels of ill.  If he honors the laws of the land, and reveres the Gods of the State  Proudly his city shall stand; but a cityless outcast I rate  Whoso bold in his pride from the path of right doth depart;  Ne'er may I sit by his side, or share the thoughts of his heart.              What strange vision meets my eyes,            Fills me with a wild surprise?            Sure I know her, sure 'tis she,            The maid Antigone.            Hapless child of hapless sire,            Didst thou recklessly conspire,            Madly brave the King's decree?            Therefore are they haling thee?  [Enter GUARD bringing ANTIGONE]    GUARD  Here is the culprit taken in the act  Of giving burial.  But where's the King?    CHORUS  There from the palace he returns in time.  [Enter CREON]    CREON  Why is my presence timely?  What has chanced?    GUARD  No man, my lord, should make a vow, for if  He ever swears he will not do a thing,  His afterthoughts belie his first resolve.  When from the hail-storm of thy threats I fled  I sware thou wouldst not see me here again;  But the wild rapture of a glad surprise  Intoxicates, and so I'm here forsworn.  And here's my prisoner, caught in the very act,  Decking the grave.  No lottery this time;  This prize is mine by right of treasure-trove."]]]
