Lamb, veal, and pork require rather more boiling than other  meat, to make them wholesome. The hind quarters of most animals require  longer time to dress than the fore quarters, and all kinds of provision  require more time in frosty weather than in summer. Large joints of beef  and mutton are better a little underdone; they make the richer hash; but  meat that is fresh slain will remain tough and hard, in whatever way it  may be cooked. All meat should be washed clean before it is put into the  boiler, but salt meat especially. A ham of twenty pounds will take four  hours and a half in boiling, and others in proportion. A dried tongue,  after being soaked, will take four hours boiling: a tongue out of  pickle, from two hours and a half to three hours, or more if very large:  it must be judged by its feeling quite tender. Boiling is in general the  most economical mode of cooking, if care be taken to preserve the broth,  and apply it to useful purposes.      BOILED BACON. Soak it, and take off the rind before boiling. A pound of  bacon boiled without the skin will weigh an ounce heavier than a pound  boiled with it. Fat bacon should be put into hot water, and lean into  cold water, when it is to be dressed. Young bacon will boil in about  three quarters of an hour. Grate some toasted bread over it, and set it  near the fire to brown it a little, before it is sent to table.      BOILED BEEF. When the water boils put in the meat, whether beef or  mutton, and take off the scum as it rises. If the scum be suffered to  sink, it will stick to the meat, and spoil its colour. Turnips, greens,  potatoes, or carrots with the beef, and caper sauce with the mutton.      BOILED CUSTARD. Set a pint of cream over a slow fire, adding two ounces  of sugar, and the rind of a lemon. Take it off the fire as soon as it  begins to simmer; as the cream cools, add by degrees the yolks of eight  eggs well beaten, with a spoonful of orange water. Stir it carefully  over a slow fire till it almost boils, and strain it quickly through a  piece of thin muslin. Put it into cups, and serve it up cold.      BOILED DUCK. Choose a fine fat duck, salt it two days, and boil it  slowly in a cloth. Serve it with onion sauce, but melt the butter with  milk instead of water.      BOILED EELS. The small ones are best, provided they are bright, and of a  good colour. After they are skinned, boil them in a small quantity of  water, with a quantity of parsley, which with the liquor should be sent  to table with them. Serve chopped parsley and butter for sauce.      BOILED FOWL. For boiling, choose those that are not black-legged. Pick  them nicely, singe, wash, and truss them. Flour them, and put them into  boiling water: half an hour will be sufficient for one of middling size.  Serve with parsley and butter; oyster, lemon, liver, or celery sauce. If  for dinner, ham, tongue or bacon is usually served with them, and also  greens.--When cooked with rice, stew the fowl very slowly in some clear  mutton broth well skimmed, and seasoned with onion, mace, pepper and  salt. About half an hour before it is ready, put in a quarter of a pint  of rice well washed and soaked. Simmer it till it is quite tender,  strain it from the broth, and put the rice on a sieve before the fire.  Keep the fowl hot, lay it in the middle of the dish, and the rice round  it without the broth. The broth will be nice by itself, but the less  liquor the fowl is done with the better. Gravy, or parsley and butter,  for sauce.      BOILED HAM. Soak the ham in cold water the night before it is to be  dressed, scrape it clean, and put it into the boiler with cold water.  Skim the liquor while boiling; let it not boil fast, but simmer only,  and add a little cold water occasionally for this purpose. When the ham  is done, take it up, pull off the skin carefully, and grate a crust of  bread over it so as to cover it tolerably thick. Set it before the fire,  or put it into the oven till the bread is crisp; garnish it with  carrots, or any thing that is in season. A ham of twenty pounds will  require five hours boiling, and others in proportion.      BOILED LEG OF PORK. Salt it eight or ten days; and when it is to be  dressed, weigh it. Let it lie half an hour in cold water to make it  white: allow a quarter of an hour for every pound, and half an hour  over, from the time it boils up. Skim it as soon as it boils, and  frequently after. Allow plenty of water, and save some of it for  peas-soup. The leg should be small, and of a fine grain; and if boiled  in a floured cloth, it will improve the colour and appearance. Serve it  with peas-pudding and turnips.      BOILED SALMON. Clean it carefully, boil it gently, and take it out of  the water as soon as done. Let the water be warm, if the fish be split:  if underdone, it is very unwholesome. Serve with shrimp or anchovy  sauce.      BOILED TURBOT. The turbot kettle must be of a proper size, and in good  order. Set the fish in cold water sufficient to cover it completely,  throw a handful of salt and a glass of vinegar into it, and let it  gradually boil. Be very careful that no blacks fall into it; but skim it  well, and preserve the beautiful colour of the fish. Serve it garnished  with a complete fringe of curled parsley, lemon and horse-radish. The  sauce must be the finest lobster, anchovy and butter, and plain butter,  served plentifully in separate tureens.--If necessary, turbot will keep  two or three days, and be in as high perfection as at first, if lightly  rubbed over with salt, and carefully hung in a cold place.      BOILED TURKEY. A turkey will neither boil white nor eat tender, unless  it has been killed three or four days. Pick it clean, draw it at the  rump, cut off the legs, stick the end of the thighs into the body, and  tie them fast. Flour the turkey, put it into the water while cold, let  it boil gently half an hour or more, take off the scum, and cover the  kettle close. Make the stuffing of grated bread and lemon peel, four  ounces of shred suet, a few chopped oysters, two eggs, and a little  cream. Fill the craw with stuffing, and make the rest into balls, which  are to be boiled and laid round the dish. The stuffing may be made  without oysters; or force-meat or sausage may be used, mixed with crumbs  of bread and yolks of eggs. Celery sauce or white sauce is very proper.      BOILED VEAL. Dredge it with flour, tie it up in a cloth, and put it in  when the water boils. A knuckle requires more boiling in proportion to  its weight, than any other joint, to render the gristle soft and tender.  Parsley and butter, bacon and greens, are commonly eaten with it.      BOILERS. Copper boilers and saucepans are apt to become leaky, when they  have been joined or mended, or from bruises, which sometimes render them  unfit for use. In this case a cement of pounded quicklime, mixed with  ox's blood, applied fresh to the injured part, will be of great  advantage, and very durable. A valuable cement for such purposes may  also be made of equal parts of vinegar and milk mixed together so as to  produce a curd: the whey is then put to the whites of four or five eggs  after they have been well beaten, and the whole reduced to a thick paste  by the addition of some quicklime finely sifted. This composition  applied to cracks or fissures of any kind, and properly dried, will  resist the effects of fire and water.      BOLOGNA SAUSAGES. Cut into small pieces four pounds of lean beef, and  add to it a pound of diced suet, with the same quantity of diced bacon.  Season with allspice, pepper, bay salt, saltpetre, and a little powder  of bay leaves. Mix the whole together, tie the meat up in skins about  the thickness of the wrist, dry the sausages in the same manner as  tongues, and eat them without boiling.      BOLOGNA SOUP. Bind close with packthread, fifteen pounds of brisket of  beef, and put it into a pot with water sufficient to cover it. Then add  three large carrots, some good turnips, four onions, a bunch of sweet  herbs, and half a white cabbage sliced and fried in butter. The pot must  be well scummed before the herbs are put in. It must boil very slowly  for five or six hours; and when half boiled, prepare three or four  pounds of loin of mutton, with all the fat taken off, and put it into  the pot. Flavour the soup with whole pepper, and a head of celery; and  to make it of a good colour, draw the gravy from a pound of lean beef  over a slow fire, and add a ladleful to the soup, first carefully taking  off all the fat. Having cut and dried the crust of a French roll, lay it  in a stewpan with a little soup; and after stewing it over a slow fire,  place it with a slice in the soup tureen. The beef must be untied, and  served up with chopped parsley strewed over it; accompanied also with  gravy sauce, a few capers, and some chopped carrots, thickened with the  yolk of an egg. Add a little seasoning to the soup.      BOOTS. Persons who travel much, or are often exposed to the weather,  must be sensible of the importance of being provided with boots that  will resist the wet. The following is a composition for preserving  leather, the good effects of which are sufficiently ascertained. One  pint of drying oil, two ounces of yellow wax, two ounces of spirit of  turpentine, and half an ounce of Burgundy pitch, should be carefully  melted together over a slow fire. With this mixture, new shoes and boots  are to be rubbed in the sun, or at some distance from the fire, with a  sponge or brush. The operation is to be repeated as often as they become  dry, and until they are fully saturated. In this manner the leather  becomes impervious to the wet: the boots or shoes last much longer than  those of common leather, acquire such softness and pliability that they  never shrivel or grow hard, and in that state are the most effectual  preservation against wet and cold. It is necessary to observe,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29086"],[0,"The Mushroom, Edible and Otherwise (#18)"],[1,"cap is much darker in color.    Var. pallidifolia--gills much paler than usual.    Var. striatula--cap smooth, thin, so that shadowy lines are seen on cap,  radiating from near the center to the margin. This grows in damp places.  Some authors make Clitocybe laccata a type for a new genus and call it  Lacaria laccata.      _Collybia. Fr._    Collybia is from a Greek word meaning a small coin or a small round  cake. The ring and volva are both wanting in this genus. The pileus is  fleshy, generally thin, and when the plant is young the margin of the  pileus is incurved.    The gills are adnate or nearly free, soft, membranaceous. Many species  of Collybia will revive to some extent when moistened, but they are not  coriaceous.    The stem differs in substance from the pileus, cartilaginous or has a  cartilaginous cuticle, while the inside is stuffed or hollow. This is  quite a large genus, containing fifty-four American species.      _Collybia radicata. Rehl._    THE ROOTING COLLYBIA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Plate XIII. Figure 78.--Collybia radicata.]    This, in its season, is one of the most common mushrooms in the woods.  It grows in the ground, frequently around old stumps, sometimes on  lawns.    Those in Figure 78 were found in the woods on the ground. One plant, as  will be seen by the square, is a foot high.    It is easily recognized by its long root and flat cap. The root extends  into the ground and will frequently break before pulling up. This root  gives name to the species.    The pileus is fleshy, rather thin, convex, then plane, often with margin  upturned in old plants as in Figure 78, and frequently wrinkled at and  toward the umbo, smooth, viscid when moist.    The color is quite variable, from almost white to gray, grayish-brown;  flesh thin, very white, elastic.    The gills are usually snow white, broad, rather distant, broad in the  middle, joined to the stem by the upper angle, unequal.    The stem is frequently long, of the same color as the cap, yet sometimes  paler; smooth, firm, sometimes grooved, often twisted, tapering upward,  ending in a long tapering root, deeply planted in the soil.    The spores are elliptical, 15x10u.    They grow singly, but generally have many neighbors. They are found in  open woods and around old stumps. I seldom have any trouble in getting  enough for a large family and some for my neighbor, who may not know  what to get but does know how to appreciate them. Found from June to  October and from the New England states through the middle west. They  differ from C. hariolarum in the densely tufted habit of the latter.      _Colybia ingrata. Schum._    Ingrata means unpleasant; from its somewhat unpleasant odor.    The pileus is one to two inches broad, globose, bell-shaped, then  convex, umbonate, even, brownish-tan.    The gills are free, narrow, crowded, pallid.    The stem is twisted, subcompressed, sprinkled with a mealy tomentum  above, umber below, hollow, rather long, unequal.    I found this plant quite abundant on Cemetery Hill, growing under pine  trees, from the mass of pine needles. Found in July and August.      _Collybia platyphylla. Fr._    BROAD-GILLED COLLYBIA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 79.--Collybia platyphylla. One-third natural  size.]    Platyphylla is from two Greek words meaning broad and leaf, referring to  the broad gills. It is a much larger and stouter plant than Collybia  radicata. It is found in new ground on open pastures about stumps, also  in woods, on rotten logs and about stumps.    The pileus is three to four inches broad, at first convex, then  expanded, plane, margin often upturned, smoky brown to grayish, streaked  with dark fibrils, watery when moist, flesh white.    The gills are adnexed, very broad, obliquely notched behind, distant,  soft, white, in age more or less broken or cracked.    The stem is short, thick, often striated, whitish, soft, stuffed,  sometimes slightly powdered at the apex, root blunt. The spores are  white and elliptical.    It is easily distinguished from C. radicata by the blunt base of the  root and the very broad gills. Like C. radicata they need to be cooked  well or there is a slightly bitter taste to them. They are found from  June to October.      _Collybia dryophila. Bull._    OAK-LOVING COLLYBIA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._    Figure 80.--Collybia dryophila. Natural size. Caps bay-brown.]    Dryophila is from two Greek words, oak and fond of. The pileus is  bay-brown, bay red, or tan color, one or two inches broad, convex,  plane, sometimes depressed and the margin elevated, flesh thin and  white.    The gills are free with a decurrent tooth, crowded, narrow, white, or  whitish, rarely yellow.    The stem is cartilaginous, smooth, hollow, yellow, or yellowish, equal,  sometimes thickened at the base as will be seen in Figure 80. The color  of the stem is usually the same as the cap. This is a very common  plant about Chillicothe. They are found in woods, especially under oak  trees, but are also found in open places. I found them on the High  School lawn in Chillicothe. Some very fine specimens that were found  growing in a well marked ring, in an old orchard, were brought to me  about the first of May. Their season is from the first of May to  October.      _Collybia zonata. Pk._    THE ZONED COLLYBIA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._    Plate XIV. Figure 81.--Collybia Zonata.]    Zonata, zoned; referring to the concentric zones on the cap which show  faintly in Figure 81.    The pileus is about one inch broad, sometimes more, sometimes less;  rather fleshy, thin, convex, when expanded nearly plane, slightly  umbilicate, covered with fibrous down; tawny or ochraceous tawny,  sometimes marked with faintly darker zones; even in the very young  specimens the umbilicate condition is usually present.    The gills are narrow, close, free, white or nearly white, usually with a  pulverulent edge.    The stem is one to three inches long, rather firm, equal, hollow,  covered like the cap with a fibrous down, tawny, or brownish tawny. The  spores are broadly elliptical, .0002 inch long, .00016 broad.    This species closely resembles C. stipitaria, but is easily  distinguished from it because of its habits of growth, different gills,  and shorter spores. It is found on or near decaying wood in mixed woods.  I have found it frequently on Ralston's Run but always only a few  specimens in one place. It does not grow in a cespitose manner with us.  Found in August.      _Collybia maculata. Alb. & Schw._    THE SPOTTED COLLYBIA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 82.--Collybia maculata. Two-thirds natural size.  Reddish-brown spots on caps and stems.]    Maculata, spotted; referring to the reddish spots or stains both on the  cap and on the stem. The pileus is two to three inches broad, at first  white, then spotted (as well as the stem) with reddish brown spots or  stains, fleshy, very firm, convex, sometimes nearly plane, even, smooth,  truly carnose, compact, at first hemispherical and with an involute  margin, often repand.    The gills are somewhat crowded, narrow, adnexed, often free, linear,  white or whitish, often brownish cream, gills not reaching to the margin  of the cap.    The stem is three to four inches long, nearly solid, more or less  grooved, stout, unequal, sometimes ventricose, frequently partially  bulbous, lighter than the gills, usually spotted in age, white at first.  The spores are subglobose, 4-6u. The plant is a hardy one. It will keep  for several days. The plants in Figure 82 grew in the woods where a log  had rotted down.    Var. immaculata, Cooke, differs from the typical form in not changing  color or being spotted, and in the broader and serrated gills. This  variety delights in fir woods. September to November.      _Collybia atrata. Fr._    CHARCOAL COLLYBIA.    [Illustration: Figure 83.--Collybia atrata. One-half natural size. Caps  dull blackish-brown. Gills grayish-white.]    Atrata, clothed in black; from the pileus being very black when young.  The pileus is from one to two inches broad, at first regular and convex,  when expanded becoming, as a rule, irregular in shape, sometimes  partially lobed or wavy; in young plants the cap is a dull blackish  brown, faded in older specimens to a lighter brown, umbilicate, smooth,  shining.    The gills are adnate, slightly crowded, with many short ones, rather  broad, grayish-white.    The stem is smooth, equal, even, hollow, or stuffed, tough, short, brown  within and without, but lighter than the cap. The plant grows in  pastures where stumps have been burned out, always, so far as I have  noticed, on burned ground. Spores .00023x.00016.      _Collybia ambusta. Fr._    THE SCORCHED COLLYBIA.    Ambusta, burned or scorched, from its being found on burned soil.    The pileus is nearly membranaceous, convex, then expanded, nearly plane,  papillate, striatulate, smooth, livid brown, hygrophanous, umbonate.    The gills are adnate, crowded, lanceolate, white, then of a smoky tinge.    The stem is somewhat stuffed, tough, short, livid. Spores 5-6x3-4.    This species differs from C. atrata in having an umbonate pileus.      _Collybia confluens. Pers._    THE TUFTED COLLYBIA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 84.--Collybia confluens. Natural size, showing  reddish stems.]    Confluens means growing together; so called from the stems often being  confluent or adhering to each other.    The pileus is from an inch to an inch and a quarter broad,  reddish-brown, often densely cespitose, somewhat fleshy, convex, then  plane, flaccid, smooth, often watery, margin thin, in old specimens  slightly depressed and wavy.    The gills are free and in old plants remote from the stem, rather  crowded, narrow, flesh colored, then whitish.    The stem is two to three inches long, hollow, pale red, sprinkled with a  mealy pubescence. The spores are slightly ovate, inclined to be pointed  at"]]]
