Since 1895 Van  der Stucken has been conductor of the newly formed Cincinnati Symphony  Orchestra, as well as dean of the faculty of the College of Music in  that city. The influence of this man, who is certainly one of the most  important musicians of his time, is bringing Cincinnati back to its  old musical prestige.    As a composer, Van der Stucken shows the same originality and power  that characterize him as an organizer. His prelude to the opera  \"Vlasda\" (op. 9) is one long rapture of passionate sweetness, superbly  instrumented. An arrangement of it has been made for the piano for  four hands by Horatio W. Parker.    Van der Stucken's music to \"The Tempest\" (op. 8) is published in three  forms. Besides the orchestral score, there is an arrangement for piano  solo, by A. Siloti, of the \"Dance of the Gnomes,\" \"Dance of the  Nymphs,\" and \"Dance of the Reapers,\" the first and third being  especially well transcribed. For four hands, Hans Sitt has arranged  these three dances, as well as a short but rich \"Exorcism,\" some  splendid melodramatic music, and the rattling grotesque, \"The  Hound-chase after Caliban.\" All these pieces are finely imagined and  artistically handled.    For piano solo, there is a group of three Miniatures (op. 7). The  first is an Albumblatt of curious dun colors; the second is a  Capriccietto, a strange whim; the third is a beautiful bit called \"May  Blossom.\"    [Music:        Der Stunde sei geflucht,      wo ich dein Herz gesucht,      wenn in dir diese Liebe      statt milder Freudentriebe      soll tragen herbe Frucht!      Gesegnet ist die Stunde,      sprach sie mit suessem Munde,      mir ist kein Leid geschehn      den Himmel fuehl' ich stehn      in meines Herzens Grunde.        That hour with curse be fraught,      In which thy heart I sought,      If I, in love bestowing,      Instead of gladness knowing,      A bitter grief have bought:      \"My soul that hour e'er blesses,\"      A rosy mouth confesses,      \"Thy love is all I crave,      Then heav'n itself I have      Within my heart's recesses.\"    Copyright, 1892, by Friedrich Luckhardt, Berlin.

VAN DER STUCKEN'S \"DIE STUNDE SEI GESEGNET.\"]    Of Van der Stucken's songs I have seen two groups, the first a setting  of five love lyrics by Rueckert. None of these are over two pages long,  except the last. They are written in the best modern _Lied_ style, and  are quite unhackneyed. It is always the unexpected that happens,  though this unexpected thing almost always proves to be a right thing.  Without any sense of strain or bombast he reaches superb climaxes;  without eccentricity he is individual; and his songs are truly  interpreters of the words they express. Of these five, \"Wann die Rosen  aufgeblueht\" is a wonderfully fine and fiery work; \"Die Stunde sei  gesegnet\" has one of the most beautiful endings imaginable; \"Mir ist,  nun ich die habe\" has a deep significance in much simplicity, and its  ending, by breaking the rule against consecutive octaves, attains, as  rule-breakings have an unpleasant habit of doing, an excellent effect.  \"Liebste, nur dich seh'n\" is a passionate lyric; and \"Wenn die  Voeglein sich gepaart\" is florid and trilly, but legitimately so; it  should find much concert use. These songs, indeed, are all more than  melodies; they are expressions.    Of the second group of eight songs for low voice, \"O Jugendlust\" is  athrill with young ecstasy; \"Einsame Thraene\" has superb coloring, all  sombre, and a tremendous climax; \"Seeligkeit\" is big with emotion and  ravishing in harmony, \"Ein Schaeferlied\" is exquisite, \"Von schoen  Sicilien war mein Traum\" begins in the style of Lassen, but ends with  a strength and vigor far beyond that tender melodist. Besides these  groups, there is a rich lyric \"Moonlight;\" and there are many part  songs.    A work of considerable importance written many years before and  presented by Franz Liszt at Weimar had its first American production  in 1899, at Cincinnati and New York. It is a symphonic prologue to  Heine's tragedy, \"William Ratcliff.\" The different psychological  phases of the tragedy are presented by characteristic motives which  war among themselves. The Scottish locale is indicated vividly, and  the despair of the lovers presented in one place by the distortion and  rending of all the principal motives. A dirge with bells and a final  musing upon, and resignation before, implacable Fate give a dignified  close to a work in which passion is exploited with erudition and  modernity.      _W.W. Gilchrist._    The prize competition has its evils, unquestionably; and, in a place  of settled status, perhaps, they outnumber its benefits. But in  American music it has been of material encouragement to the production  of large works. In the first place, those who do not win have been  stimulated to action, and have at least their effort for their pains.  In the second place, those who manage to win are several hundred  dollars the richer, and may offer the wolf at the door a more  effective bribe than empty-stomached song.    In the city of Philadelphia lives a composer of unusual luck in  prize-winning. That large and ancient town is not noteworthy for its  activity in the manufacture of original music. In fact, some one has  spoken of it as \"a town where the greatest reproach to a musician is  residence there.\" The city's one prominent music-writer is William  Wallace Gilchrist; but he stands among the first of our composers. He  is especially interesting as a purely native product, having never  studied abroad, and yet having won among our composers a foremost  place in the larger forms of composition. He was born in Jersey City,  January 8, 1846; his father was a Canadian, his mother a native of  this country; both were skilled in music, and his home life was full  of it, especially of the old church music. After a youth of the usual  school life he tried various pursuits,--photography, law, business;  but music kept calling him. A good barytone voice led him to join  vocal societies, and at length he made music his profession, after  studying voice, organ, and composition with Dr. H.A. Clarke, of  Philadelphia. He was a successful soloist in oratorio for some years,  but gradually devoted himself to church work and conducting, and to  composition, though none of his music was published till he was  thirty-two, when he took two prizes offered by the Abt Male Singing  Society of Philadelphia.    Shortly after taking the Abt Society prize, he won three offered by  the Mendelssohn Glee Club of New York, and in 1884 he took the $1,000  prize offered by the Cincinnati Festival Association.    This last was gained by his setting of the Forty-sixth Psalm for  soprano solo, chorus, and orchestra. The overture opens with a noble  andante contemplatif, which deserves its epithet, but falls after a  time into rather uninteresting moods, whence it breaks only at the  last period. The opening chorus, \"God Is Our Refuge and Strength,\"  seems to me to be built on a rather trite and empty subject, which it  plays battledore and shuttlecock with in the brave old pompous and  canonic style, which stands for little beyond science and labor. It is  only fair to say, however, that A.J. Goodrich, in his \"Musical  Analysis,\" praises \"the strength and dignity\" of this chorus; and  gives a minute analysis of the whole work with liberal thematic  quotation. The psalm, as a whole, though built on old lines, is built  well on those lines, and the solo \"God Is in the Midst of Her\" is  taken up with especially fine effect by the chorus. \"The Heathen  Raged\" is a most ingeniously complicated chorus also.    The cantata, \"Prayer and Praise,\" is similarly conventional, and  suffers from the sin of repetition, but contains much that is strong.    Of the three prize male choruses written for the Mendelssohn Glee  Club, the \"Ode to the Sun\" is the least successful. It is written to  the bombast of Mrs. Hemans, and is fittingly hysterical; occasionally  it fairly shrieks itself out. \"In Autumn\" is quieter; a sombre work  with a fine outburst at the end. \"The Journey of Life\" is an andante  misterioso that catches the gloom of Bryant's verse, and offers a good  play for that art of interweaving voices in which Gilchrist is an  adept.    \"The Uplifted Gates\" is a chorus for mixed voices with solos for  sopranos and altos; it is elaborate, warm, and brilliant. In lighter  tone are the \"Spring Song,\" a trio with cheap words, but bright music  and a rich ending, and \"The Sea Fairies,\" a chorus of delightful  delicacy for women's voices. It has a piano accompaniment for four  hands. In this same difficult medium of women's voices is \"The  Fountain,\" a surpassingly beautiful work, graceful and silvery as a  cascade. It reminds one, not by its manner at all, but by its success,  of that supreme achievement, Wagner's song of the \"Rhinemaidens.\"  The piano accompaniment to Gilchrist's chorus aids the general  picture.    A thoroughly charming work is the setting of Lowell's poem, \"The  Rose,\" for solos and chorus. The dreariness of the lonely poet and the  lonely maid contrasts strongly with the rapture of their meeting. As  the first half of the poem is morose yet melodious, the latter is  bright with ecstasy; the ending is of the deepest tenderness.    By all odds the best of these choruses, however, is \"The Legend of the  Bended Bow,\" a fine war-chant by Mrs. Hemans. Tradition tells that in  ancient Britain the people were summoned to war by messengers who  carried a bended bow; the poem tells of the various patriots  approached. The reaper is bidden to leave his standing corn, the  huntsman to turn from the chase; the chieftain, the prince, mothers,  sisters, sweethearts, and the bards are all approached and counselled  to bravery. After each episode follow the words \"And the bow passed  on,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23860"],[0,"The Young Man's Guide (#18)"],[1,". We are not only allowed to charge  something for the _use_ of the money, but something additional for the  _risk_ of the loss which may frequently arise,--and most frequently  does arise--from the misfortunes of those to whom we thus assign our  goods on trust.    The man, therefore, who purchases on trust, not only pays for being  credited, but he also pays his share of what the tradesman loses by his  general practice of selling upon trust; and after all, he is not so  good a customer as the man who purchases cheaply with ready money. His  _name_, indeed, is in the tradesman's book, but with that name the  tradesman cannot buy a fresh supply of goods.    Infinite, almost, are the ways in which people lose by this sort of  dealing. Domestics sometimes go and order things not wanted at all; at  other times more than is wanted. All this would be obviated by  purchasing with ready money; for whether through the hands of the party  himself, or those of some other person, there would always be an actual  counting out of the money. Somebody would see the thing bought, and the  money paid. And as the master would give the steward or housekeeper a  purse of money at the time, _he_ would see the money too, would set a  proper value upon it, and would just desire to know upon what it had  been expended.    Every man, who purchases for ready money, will naturally make the  amount of the purchase as low as possible, in proportion to his means.  This care and frugality will make an addition to his means; and  therefore, at the end of his life, he will have a great deal more to  spend, and still be as rich as if he had been trusted all his days. In  addition to this, he will eat, and drink, and sleep _in peace_, and  avoid all the endless papers, and writings, and receipts, and bills,  and disputes, and lawsuits, inseparable from the credit system.    This is by no means intended as a lesson of _stinginess_, nor is it any  part of my purpose to inculcate the plan of _heaping up_ money. But  purchasing with ready money really gives you more money to purchase  with; you can afford to have a greater quantity and variety of  enjoyments. In the town, it will tend to hasten your pace along the  streets, for the temptation at the windows is answered in a moment by  clapping your hand upon your pocket; and the question; 'Do I really  want it?' is sure to recur immediately; because the touch of the money  will put the thought into your mind.    Now supposing you to have a fortune, even beyond your actual wants,  would not the money which you might save in this way, be very well  applied in acts of real benevolence? Can you walk or ride a mile, in  the city or country, or go to half a dozen houses; or in fact can you  open your eyes without seeing some human being, born in the same  country with yourself, and who, on that account alone, has some claim  upon your good wishes and your charity? Can you, if you would, avoid  seeing one person, if no more, to whom even a small portion of your  annual savings would convey gladness of heart? Your own feelings will  suggest the answer.      SECTION VII. _Of entrusting Business to others._    'If you wish to have your business done, go; if not, send.' This is an  old maxim; and one which is no less true than old. Every young man, on  setting out in the world, should make it a rule, never to trust any  thing _of consequence_ to another, which he can, without too much  difficulty, perform himself.    1. Because, let a person have my interest ever so much at heart, I am  sure I regard it _more_ myself.    2. Nothing is more difficult than to know, in all cases, the characters  of those we confide in. How can we expect to understand the characters  of others, when we scarcely know our own? Which of us can know,  positively, that he shall never be guilty of another vice or weakness,  or yield to another temptation, and thus forfeit public confidence?  Who, then, will needlessly trust another, when he can hardly be sure of  himself?    3. No substitute we can employ, can _understand_ our business as well  as ourselves.    4. We can change our measures according to changing circumstances;  which gives us those opportunities of doing things in the best way, of  which another will not feel justified in availing himself.    As for dependants of every kind, it should ever be remembered that  their master's interest sometimes possesses only the second place in  their hearts. Self-love, with such, will be the ruling principle of  action; and no fidelity whatever will prevent a person from bestowing a  good deal of thought upon his own concerns. But this must, of  necessity, break in more or less upon his diligence in consulting the  interest of his employers. How men of business can venture, as they  sometimes do, to trust concerns of great importance, for half of every  week in the year, (which is half the whole year) to dependants, and  thus expect others to take care of their business, when they will not  be at the trouble of minding it themselves, is to me inconceivable! Nor  does the detection, from time to time, of fraud in such persons, seem  at all to diminish this practice.    There is a maxim among business people, 'never to do that for  themselves which they can pay another for doing.' This, though true to  a certain extent, is liable to abuse. If every body, without  discrimination, could be _safely_ trusted, the maxim might be _more_  just; since nothing is more obvious than that laborers are often at  hand, whose time can be bought for a much less sum of money than you  would yourself earn in the meantime. I have often known people make or  mend little pieces of furniture, implements of their occupations, &c.  to save expense, when they could have earned, at their labor during the  same time, twice the sum necessary to pay a trusty and excellent  workman for doing it.    But, as I have already observed, persons are not always at hand, in  whom you can confide; so that the certainty of having a thing done  right, is worth much more than the loss of a little time. Besides, God  has never said _how much_ we must do in this world. We are indeed to do  all we can, and at the same time do it well; but _how much that is_, we  must judge. He is not necessarily the most useful man who does even the  greatest amount of good;--but he who does the most good, attended with  the least evil.    But we should remember that what _others_ do, is not done by  _ourselves_. Still, an individual may often do many little things  without any hindrance to his main object. For example, I would not  thank a person to make or mend my pen, or shave me; because I can write  as much, or perform as much business of any kind, in a week or  month--probably more--if I stop to mend my pens, shave myself daily,  make fires, saw and split wood, &c. as if I do not. And the same is  true of a thousand other things.      SECTION VIII. _Over Trading._    I have already classed this among the frauds into which business men  are in danger of falling; and I cannot but think its character will be  pretty well established by what follows.    Over trading is an error into which many industrious, and active young  men are apt to run, from a desire of getting rich more rapidly than  they are able to do with a smaller business. And yet profusion itself  is not more dangerous. Indeed, I question whether idleness brings more  people to ruin than over trading.    This subject is intimately connected with _credit_, for it is the  credit system that gives such facilities to over trading. But of the  evils of credit I have treated fully elsewhere I will only add, under  this head, a few remarks on one particular species of trading. I refer  to the conduct of many persons, with large capitals, who, for the sake  of adding to a heap already too large, monopolize the market,--or trade  for a profit which they know dealers of smaller fortunes cannot  possibly live by. If such men really think that raising themselves on  the ruin of others, in this manner, is justifiable, and that riches  obtained in this manner are fairly earned, they must certainly have  either neglected to inform themselves, or stifled the remonstrances of  conscience, and bid defiance to the laws of God.      SECTION IX. _Making Contracts beforehand._    In making bargains--with workmen, for example--always do it beforehand,  and never suffer the matter to be deferred by their saying they will  leave it to your discretion.    There are several reasons why this ought to be done. 1st. It prevents  any difficulty afterward; and does no harm, even when the intentions of  both parties are perfectly good. 2d. If you are dealing with a knave,  it prevents him from accomplishing any evil designs he may have upon  you. 3d. Young people are apt to be deceived by appearances, both from  a credulity common to their youth and inexperience, and because neither  the young nor the old have any certain method of knowing human  character by externals. The most open hearted are the most liable to be  imposed upon by the designing.    It will be well to have all your business--of course all contracts--as  far as may be practicable, in writing. And it would be well if men of  business would make it a constant rule, whenever and wherever it is  possible, to draw up a minute or memorial of every transaction,  subscribed by both, with a clause signifying that in case of any  difference, they would submit the matter to arbitration.    Nothing is more common than for a designing person to put off the  individual he wishes to take advantage of, by saying; _We shan't  disagree. I'll do what's right about it; I won't wrong you, &c._ And  then when accounts come to be settled, and the party who thinks himself  aggrieved, says that he made the bargain with the expectation of having  such and such advantages allowed him, _No_, says the sharper, _I never  told you any such thing_.    It is on this account"]]]
