McGregor (1910:604) describes       the species as: \"Common on Tawi Tawi, less so in Sulu. A deep woods       bird; tame and easily shot. Feeds on insects, and usually keeps       some distance above the ground.\"         The two specimens recorded above provide the first record of this       species from Borneo, the previously known range being confined to       the Philippine Islands. My material closely resembled the       subspecies found on Tawi-Tawi and here is assigned to _P. w.       homeyeri_.    _=Motacilla caspica melanope=_ Pallas: Gray Wagtail.--_Specimen_, 1:  Cocoa Research Station: [Female], October 4, 1962, MCT 2991.         I saw this migrant first at the research station on August 25,       1962, along a dirt road, and it was subsequently seen many times       along logging roads in secondary forest.    _=Artamus leucorhynchus leucorhynchus=_ Linnaeus: White-breasted  Swallow Shrike.--_Specimens_, 2: Tuaran: sex?, December 6, 1963, SCFC  F13; [Female], December 7, 1963, SCFC F15.    _=Lanius cristatus lucionensis=_ Linnaeus: Brown Shrike.--_Specimen_, 1:  Tuaran: [Male], January 12, 1963, MCT 3593.         One bird was observed near our sulap 12 miles north of Kalabakan on       October 22 and 26, 1962. The specimen was netted in a paddy field       and others were seen at Tuaran.    _=Lanius tigrinus=_ Drapiez: Thick-billed Shrike.--_Specimens_, 2: Tiger  Estate: [Male], November 25, 1962, MCT 3316. Cocoa Research Station:  [Female], November 29, 1962, MCT 3383.         The specimen taken on November 29, was netted in a small clearing       in primary forest.    _=Aplonis panayensis strigatus=_ (Horsfield): Glossy  Starling.--_Specimens_, 2: Tiger Estate: [Female], October 11, 1962, MCT  3001; [Female], November 25, 1962, MCT 3322. Tuaran: [Female], March 21,  1963, ADG 35; sex?, December 1, 1963, EJHB 616.         This species was in the lowlands around Semporna, Siamil Island,       Brantian Estate, and Tawau.    _=Gracula religiosa religiosa=_ Linnaeus: Talking Myna.--_Specimens_, 3:  Tiger Estate: [Female], October 11, 1962, MCT 3020. Cocoa Research  Station: [Male], May 28, 1963, ADG 114. Gum-Gum: [Female], September 9,  1963, ADG 277.         This was a common bird at Quoin Hill but was not seen elsewhere by       me. It frequented the dead trees in the cocoa.    _=Anthreptes simplex=_ (S. Mueller): Plain-colored Sunbird.--_Specimens_,  6: Cocoa Research Station: [Female] imm., 8.0 gm., August 11, 1962, MCT  2768; [Male] imm., 10.0 gm., August 11, 1962, MCT 2769; [Male], 7.0 gm.,  September 6, 1962, MCT 2878; [Male], September 25, 1962, MCT 2959;  [Female], November 27, 1962, MCT 3332; [Male], November 27, 1962, MCT  3343.         This common bird at Quoin Hill frequented flowers of the Tree       Cassava. Trees of that species were shade trees in the cocoa.    _=Anthreptes malacensis=_ ssp. (Scopoli): Brown-throated  Sunbird.--_Specimens_, 2: Tenom: [Male], January 3, 1963, MCT 3573;  [Male] testis 5 x 4 mm., January 4, 1963, MCT 3576.         One of the specimens (MCT 3576) was molting into adult male       plumage; the size of its testes suggests that this bird was also       coming into breeding condition, all of which seemingly lends       support to Chasen's (1939:401) suspicion that the species has an       eclipse plumage. Lacking specimens in breeding plumage, I was       unable to determine the subspecific affinities of the population at       Tenom.         This species was observed also on Siamil Island.    _=Anthreptes rhodolaema=_ Shelley: Rufous-throated  Sunbird.--_Specimens_, 14: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] testis 3 x 3  mm., 12.5 gm., August 9, 1962, MCT 2742; [Male] testis 5 x 3 mm., 15.0  gm., August 9, 1962, MCT 2743; [Female], 13.5 gm., August 9, 1962, MCT  2744; [Female] imm., 12.7 gm., August 9, 1962, MCT 2745; [Male] testis 3  x 2 mm., 13.5 gm., August 10, 1962, MCT 2749; [Male], 13.0 gm., August  10, 1962, MCT 2750; [Female], 12.0 gm., August 10, 1962, MCT 2751;  [Female] imm., 10.8 gm., August 13, 1962, MCT 2775; [Male], September 4,  1962, MCT 2869; [Female] largest ova 3 mm., oviduct enlarged, 12.0 gm.,  September 12, 1962, MCT 2905; [Female], November 27, 1962, MCT 3350;  [Male], November 27, 1962, MCT 3351; [Male], November 27, 1962, MCT  3355.         The Rufous-throated Sunbirds were the most common sunbirds at the       Cocoa Research Station. They seemed to prefer foraging about       flowers of the Tree Cassava. The stomachs of those examined       contained insects. The absence of _A. malacensis_ suggests that       these two species are mutually exclusive.    _=Anthreptes singalensis borneana=_ (Kloss): Ruby-cheeked  Sunbird.--_Specimens_, 3: Cocoa Research Station: [Male], 8.0 gm.,  August 23, 1962, MCT 2801; [Male], November 29, 1962, MCT 3385;  [Female], 8.4 gm., August 10, 1962, MCT 2752.         This species seemed to prefer secondary forest or cocoa as a       habitat and was an uncommon bird at Quoin Hill.    _=Nectarinia sperata=_ (Linnaeus): Van Hasselt's Sunbird.--Fred Dunn saw  a male in secondary forest near the Cocoa Research Station.    _=Nectarinia jugularis=_ (Linnaeus): Yellow-breasted Sunbird.--This  sunbird was abundant in the coconut palms at Siamil Island. The species  was observed also at exotic flowering plants in Tawau.    _=Nectarinia hypogrammica hypogrammica=_ S. Mueller: Purple-naped  Sunbird.--_Specimens_, 10: Cocoa Research Station: [Female], November  27, 1962, MCT 3334: [Male], July 7, 1963, ADG 167. 12 mi. N Kalabakan:  [Male] testis 3 x 5 mm., October 14, 1962, MCT 3035; [Male], October 15,  1962, MCT 3047; [Male], October 23, 1962, MCT 3133; [Male], October 24,  1962, MCT 3145; [Male], November 2, 1962, MCT 3203; [Female], November  15, 1962, MCT 3287. Oil Palm Research Station: [Female], August 16,  1963, ADG 247; [Male], August 27, 1963, ADG 262.         This common species of secondary forest at Quoin Hill seems to       prefer spiders and various insects for food. I saw one bird       removing dead leaves from a tree and picking out the spiders that       had taken over the curled leaves as shelters. I also saw birds of       this species hover before spiderwebs and remove the spiders.         A specimen taken on November 15, 1962, was in heavy molt.    _=Aethopyga mystacalis=_ (Temminck): Scarlet Sunbird.--_Specimen_, 1:  Cocoa Research Station: [Male], 6.0 gm., September 12, 1962, MCT 2903.         This specimen was molting from a drab to an adult type male       plumage. I saw this species only one other time at Quoin Hill, but       on December 26 I saw two males feeding among epiphytic plants in       the moss forest above Tenom. The condition of the specimen's       plumage prevented its identification to subspecies (presumably _A.       m. temmincki_).    _=Aethopyga siparaja=_ (Raffles): Yellow-backed Sunbird.--_Specimens_,  3: Tawau: [Male] testis 5 x 5 mm., September 2, 1962, MCT 2861. Tiger  Estate: [Male], October 11, 1962, MCT 2999. Oil Palm Research Station:  [Female], August 13, 1963, ADG 231.         This sunbird was common around flowers at Kalabakan and Brantian       Estate.         Unfortunately, I lack enough specimens to make a subspecific       identification. The specimen from Tawau differs from _A. s.       siparaja_, however, only in having darker wings; it closely       resembles the type and the series that Oberholser used when       describing _A. s. ochrapyrrha_.    _=Arachnothera longirostris buttikoferi=_ van Oort: Little  Spiderhunter.--_Specimens_, 58: Cocoa Research Station: [Male], 16.2  gm., August 13, 1962, MCT 2777; [Male], 15.6 gm., August 22, 1962, MCT  2796; [Male] testis 6 x 4 mm., 16.0 gm., September 13, 1962, MCT 2913;  [Female], December 1, 1962, MCT 3399; [Male] testis 4 x 3 mm., December  2, 1962, MCT 3431; [Male], November 27, 1962, MCT 3347; [Female],  November 27, 1962, MCT 3348; [Male], November 28, 1962, MCT 3366;  [Male], November 28, 1962, MCT 3367; [Female], November 28, 1962, MCT  3368; [Female], November 28, 1962, MCT 3369; [Male], November 28, 1962,  MCT 3370; [Female], November 28, 1962, MCT 3371; [Male], November 28,  1962, MCT 3372; [Male], November 29, 1962, MCT 3386; [Male], December 1,  1962, MCT 3397; [Male], December 1, 1962, MCT 3398; [Female], December  2, 1962, MCT 3430; [Female]?, November 30, 1962, MCT 3443; [Female],  April 26, 1962, ADG 60; [Male], April 27, 1963, ADG 70; [Male], April  27, 1962, ADG 73; [Male], April 18, 1963, ADG 78; [Male], April 28,  1963, ADG 80; [Male], April 29, 1963, ADG 86; [Male], April 29, 1963,  ADG 87; [Male], April 30, 1962, ADG 93. 12 mi.

With these exceptions the preparation of the land is everywhere very  crude, consisting in the felling of the timber and undergrowth, and  in burning it as completely as possible, so that its ashes enrich  the soil. After a single crop has been grown and gathered on land so  cleared, the weeds grow up very thickly, and there is, of course,  in the following year no possibility of repeating the dressing of  wood ashes in the same way. Hence it is the universal practice to  allow the land to lie fallow for at least two years, after a single  crop has been raised, while crops are raised from other lands. During  the fallow period the jungle grows up so rapidly and thickly that by  the third year the weeds have almost died out, choked by the larger  growths. The same land is then prepared again by felling the young  jungle and burning it as before, and a crop is again raised from  it. When a piece of land has been prepared and cropped in this way  some three or four times, at intervals of two, three, or four years,  the crop obtainable from it is so inferior in quantity that the  people usually undertake the severe labour of felling and burning  a patch of virgin forest, rather than continue to make use of the  old areas. In this way a large village uses up in the course of some  twelve or fifteen years all the land suitable for cultivation within  a convenient distance, I.E. within a radius of some three miles. When  this state of affairs results, the, village is moved to a new site,  chosen chiefly with an eye to the abundance of land suitable for the  cultivation of the PADI crop. After ten or more years the villagers  will return, and the house or houses will be reconstructed on the old  site or one adjacent to it, if no circumstances arise to tempt them  to migrate to a more distant country, and if the course of their life  on the old site has run smoothly, without misfortunes such as much  sickness, conflagrations, or serious attacks by other villages. After  this interval the land is regarded as being almost as good as the  virgin forest land, and has the advantage that the jungle on it can  be more easily felled. But since no crop equals that obtainable from  virgin soil, it is customary to include at least a small area of it  in the operations of each year.    Each family cultivates its own patch of land, selecting it by  arrangement with other families, and works as large an area as the  strength and number of the roomhold permits. A hillside sloping down  to the bank of a river or navigable stream is considered the choicest  area for cultivation, partly because of the efficient drainage,  partly because the felling is easier on the slope, and because the  stream affords easy access to the field.    When an area has been chosen, the men of the roomhold first cut down  the undergrowth of a V-shaped area, whose apex points up the hill, and  whose base lies on the river bank. This done, they call in the help of  other men of the house, usually relatives who are engaged in preparing  adjacent areas, and all set to work to fell the large trees. In the  clearing of virgin forest, when very large trees, many of which have  at their bases immense buttresses, have to be felled, a platform of  light poles is built around each of these giants to the height of about  15 feet. Two men standing upon this rude platform on opposite sides  of the stem attack it with their small springy-hafted axes (Fig. 11)  above the level of the buttresses (Pl. 55). One man cuts a deep notch  on the side facing up the hill, the other cuts a similar notch about  a foot lower down on the opposite side, each cutting almost to the  centre of the stem. This operation is accomplished in a surprisingly  short time, perhaps thirty minutes in the case of a stem two to three  feet in diameter. When all the large trees within the V-shaped area  have been cut in this way, all the workers and any women, children,  or dogs who may be present are called out of the patch, and one or  two big trees, carefully selected to form the apex of the phalanx,  are then cut so as to fall down the hill.[45] In their fall these  giants throw down the trees standing immediately below them on the  hillside; these, falling in turn against their neighbours, bring  them down. And so, like an avalanche of widening sweep, the huge  disturbance propagates itself with a thunderous roar and increasing  momentum downwards over the whole of the prepared area; while puny  man looks on at the awful work of his hand and brain not unmoved,  but dancing and shouting in wild triumphant delight.    The fallen timber must now lie some weeks before it can be burnt. This  period is mainly devoted to making and repairing the implements to  be used in cultivating, harvesting, and storing the crop, and also  in sowing at the earliest possible moment small patches of early  or rapidly growing PADI together with a little maize, sugar-cane,  some Sweet potatoes, and tapioca. The patches thus sown generally lie  adjacent to one another. If the weather is fine, the fallen timber  becomes dry enough to burn well after one month. If much rain falls  it is necessary to wait longer in the hope of drier weather. Choosing  a windy day, they set fire to all the adjacent patches after shouting  out warnings to all persons in the fields. While the burning goes on,  the men \"whistle for the wind,\" or rather blow for it, rattling their  tongues in their mouths. Some of the older men make lengthy orations  shouted into the air, adjuring the wind to blow strongly and so fan  the fire. The fire, if successful, burns furiously for a few hours  and then smoulders for some days, after which little of the timber  remains but ashes and the charred stumps of the bigger trees. If the  burning is very incomplete, it is necessary to make stacks of the  lighter timbers that remain, and to fire these again. As soon as the  ashes are cool, sowing begins. Men and women work together; the men go  in front making holes with wooden dibbles about six inches apart; the  women follow, carrying hung round the neck small baskets of PADI seed  (Fig. 12), which they throw into the holes, three or four seeds to  each hole. No care is taken to fill in the holes with earth. By this  time the relatively dry season, which lasts only some two months,  is at an end, and copious rains cause the seed to shoot above the  ground a few days after the sowing. Several varieties of PADI are in  common use, some more suitable for the hillsides, some for the marshy  lands. On any one patch three or four kinds are usually sown according  to the elevation and slope of the part of the area. Since the rates of  growth of the several kinds are different, the sowings are so timed  that the whole area ripens as nearly as possible at the same moment,  in order that the birds and other pests may not have the opportunity  of turning their whole force upon the several parts in turn. The men  now build on each patch a small hut, which is occupied by most of the  able-bodied members of the roomhold until harvest is completed, some  fourteen to twenty weeks after the sowing of the PADI, according to  the variety of grain sown. They erect contrivances for scaring away  the birds; they stick bamboos about eight feet in length upright in  the ground every 20 to 30 yards. Between the upper ends of these,  rattans are tied, connecting together all the bamboos on each area  of about one acre. The field of one roomhold is generally about four  acres in extent; there will thus be four groups of bamboos, each  of which can be agitated by pulling on a single rattan. From each  such group a rattan passes to the hut, and some person, generally a  woman or child, is told off to tug at these rattans in turn at short  intervals. Upon the rattans between the bamboos are hung various  articles calculated to make a noise or to flap to and fro when the  system is set in motion. Sometimes the rattan by which the system of  poles is set in movement is tied to the upper end of a tall sapling,  one end of which is thrust deeply into the mud of the floor of the  river. The current then keeps the sapling and with it the system of  bamboos swaying and jerking to and fro. The Kayans admit that they have  learnt this last \"dodge\" from the Klemantans. The watcher remains in  the hut all day long, while his companions are at work in the field;  he varies the monotony of his task by shouting and beating with a pair  of mallets on a hollow wooden cylinder. The watcher is relieved from  time to time, but the watch is maintained continuously day and night  from the time that the corn is about two feet above the ground until  it is all gathered in. In this way they strive with partial success  to keep off the wild pigs, monkeys, deer, and, as the corn ripens,  the rice-sparrow (MUNIA).    When the hut and the pest-scaring system have been erected, the men  proceed to provide further protection against wild pig and deer by  running a rude fence round a number of closely adjacent patches of  growing corn. The fence, some three to four feet high, is made by  lashing to poles thrust vertically into the ground and to convenient  trees and stumps, bamboos or saplings as horizontal bars, five or  six in vertical row. When this is completed the men take no further  part until the harvest, except perhaps to lend a hand occasionally  with the weeding. This is the time generally chosen by them for long  excursions into the jungle in search of rattans, rubber, camphor,  and for warlike expeditions or the paying of distant visits.    It is the duty of the women to prevent the PADI being choked by  weeds. The women of each room will go over each patch completely  at least twice, at an interval of about one month, hoeing down the  weeds with a short-handled hoe; the hoe consists of a flat blade  projecting at right angles from "]]]
