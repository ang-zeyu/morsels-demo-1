Elk meat can be produced in  many sections of this country at less cost per pound than beef, mutton,  or pork.\"    Mr. Russ thinks that large areas of rough lands in the United States not  now utilized, especially in localities like the Ozarks and the  Alleghanies, could be economically used to produce venison for sale,  and he regards the elk as especially suited for this purpose.    Another feature of Mr. Russ's report is of more than passing interest.  He says:    \"We find from long experience that cattle, sheep, and goats can be  grazed in the same lots with elk, providing, however, that the lots or  inclosures are not small; the larger the area the better. We know of no  more appropriate place to call attention to the great benefit of a few  elk in the same pasture with sheep and goats. An elk is the natural  enemy of dogs and wolves. We suffered great losses to our flocks until  we learned this fact; since then we have had no loss from that cause. A  few elk in a thousand-acre pasture will absolutely protect the flocks  therein. Our own dogs are so well aware of the danger in our elk park  that they can not be induced to enter it.\"    Judge Caton, in his Antelope and Deer of America, also remarks on the  animosity of elk toward dogs, and says that the does always lead in the  chase of dogs that get into the elk park. If elk will attack and  vanquish dogs and coyotes and thus help to protect domestic animals  grazing in the same pastures, a knowledge of the fact may be of great  advantage to stockmen who desire to give up herding sheep and resort to  fenced pastures instead. The addition of a few elk in the pasture may  be an efficient protection from dogs, coyotes, and wolves. However,  outside of fenced pastures elk do not always show themselves hostile to  dogs and coyotes.      _Management of Elk in Inclosures._    Lorenzo Stratton, of Little Valley, Cattaraugus County, N. Y., began  experiments in breeding elk about sixty years ago. His plan of  management consisted essentially in taming the calves when very young  and continuing the petting process with the entire herd. He visited the  animals daily in the pasture and always carried dainties to feed them.  As the bulls became old and developed signs of viciousness, they were  castrated, younger animals being used for breeding. He thus developed a  thoroughly domesticated herd.    For economic reasons, it is not always possible to follow Mr. Stratton's  plan. Those who grow the animals for venison and in large preserves  would find it impracticable to tame all the calves. However, if elk or  deer are grown for stocking parks or private preserves, the tamer they  are the easier it will be to handle and ship them.    RANGE.--In choosing a range for elk, the natural food supply is  important. They thrive best in preserves having a variety of food  plants--grasses, bushes, and trees. Rough lands, well watered with clear  streams and having some forested area, are well adapted to their needs.  About as many elk can be kept on such a range as cattle on an equal area  of fair pasture. There should be thickets enough to furnish winter  browse, but this should be supplemented by a supply of winter forage.    FOOD.--Except when deep snows cover the ground, elk will keep in good  condition on ordinary pasture and browse; but a system of management  that provides other food regularly will be found more satisfactory. Hay  and corn fodder are excellent winter forage; but alfalfa hay has proved  to be the best dry food for both elk and deer. A little oats or  corn--whole or chopped--may be fed each day. Elk are fond of corn, and  feeding it affords excellent opportunities for winning their confidence  and taming them. The same may be said of salt, which should be furnished  liberally to all deer kept in inclosures. Running water, although not  essential, is of great importance in maintaining elk in good condition.    FENCE.--Elk are much less nervous than ordinary deer, and less disposed  to jump fences. When they escape from an enclosure they usually return  of their own accord. If tame, they may be driven like cattle.  Ordinarily, a 5-foot fence of any kind will confine elk. Henry Binning,  of Cora, Wyo., writes us that a 4-foot woven-wire fence is ample for  these animals. A small enclosure in which a vicious bull elk is to be  kept should be higher and of stronger material. Mr. Russ's report,  already partly quoted, states that where lumber for posts is cheap a  good elk fence may be built for $200 a mile. But the actual cost will,  of course, vary greatly according to style, price of labor, nearness to  market, and other circumstances.    COST OF STOCK.--The cost of stocking an elk preserve is not great.  Usually surplus stock from zoological parks or small private preserves  may be obtained at low cost, varying with the immediate demand for the  animals. At times they have sold for less than $20 a head, and with the  present restrictions on sale, low prices are likely to continue. A few  years ago T. J. Wilson, of Lewisburg, Ohio, paid $165 for three animals.  A Michigan breeder recently offered to deliver a dozen head, sex and age  not given, all fine specimens, for $500. This is, of course, a low  price, not more than cattle would bring and less than the venison would  be worth if it could be sold. If restrictions on the sale and shipment  of venison from private preserves were removed, prices of the stock  would, of course, soon advance, and necessitate a greater outlay in  starting the business.    VICIOUS MALE ELK.--The male elk is ordinarily docile, but in the rutting  season the older ones often become ill-tempered and dangerous. Several  tragedies connected with attempts to domesticate elk are matters of  history. One was recorded by Judge Caton in his Antelope and Deer of  America as having occurred in his own park. Another took place at Bull  City, Osborne County, Kans., in October 1879, and resulted in the  instant death of Gen. H. C. Bull, the mortal wounding of two other men,  and the serious injury of another, from the attacks of an infuriated  bull elk that had previously been regarded as extremely gentle.    Wild and unconfined deer and elk flee from man under nearly all  circumstances, but when wounded and closely pressed they have been known  to attack hunters. It is unlikely that, even in the rutting season, a  wild bull elk would attack a human being. But the tame or partially tame  animals that have become familiar with man are to be feared and should  not be approached in that season without extreme caution. A male elk or  deer that has once shown viciousness can not again be trusted.    The remedy for viciousness in the male elk is castration. It is unsafe  to keep an uncastrated male elk over 4 years old, unless he is in a  strongly fenced inclosure from which visitors are excluded. The effects  of castration are to make the animal docile and to greatly enhance his  value for venison. This is in accord with observed results in the  production of beef, pork, and mutton. Venison grown in domestication  under a system in which the male animals intended for slaughter are  castrated should be uniformly of the highest grade and far superior to  that obtained in the wild state during the usual open season for  hunting. This consideration is of the greatest importance in fixing the  final status of venison grown under domestication.      _Breeding the Virginia Deer._    The Virginia, or whitetail deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) is the common  deer of the United States. Including the half dozen geographic races  that occur within our borders, it is distributed over most of the  country, except Nevada and the major portions of Utah, Arizona,  Washington, Oregon, and California. It is extinct in Delaware and  practically so in a number of States in the Middle West. South of our  borders a number of closely related species occur.    In view of the wide natural range of the whitetail deer, its  adaptability to nearly all sections of the United States can not be  doubted. Testimony as to its hardiness in parks and preserves is not so  unanimous as that concerning the wapiti; but the general experience of  breeders is that with suitable range, plenty of good water, and  reasonable care in winter, raising this deer for stocking preserves or  for venison may be made as profitable as any other livestock industry.  Not only do deer thrive on land unsuited for cattle or horses, but, like  elk, they may be raised to great advantage in brushy or timbered  pastures fully stocked with cattle or horses, as the food of deer rarely  includes grass.    Advocates of the Angora goat industry state that within the United  States there are 250,000,000 acres of land not suited to tillage or to  the pasture of horses, cattle, or sheep, which are well adapted to  goats. Much of this land is suited also to deer and elk, and can be  utilized for these animals with less injury to the forest cover than  would result from its browsing by goats.    The whitetail deer has often been the subject of experiments in  domestication. The beauty of these animals, especially the fawns,  appeals to every admirer of wild life, and early settlers of the country  soon learned how easily they could be tamed and how promptly they  attached themselves to the persons who fed them. The dangerous character  of the same pets, especially the males, when grown up was soon learned  also. It followed that the domesticating process usually ended with the  maturity of the first subject, which was soon disposed of or banished to  a safe inclosure.    The propagation of the Virginia deer has seldom been undertaken in a  systematic way. The animals have often"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33852"],[0,"British Butterflies: Figures and Descriptions of Every Native Species (#18)"],[1,"contrast between the pale whitish border  and the velvet depth of the colours it encloses. {122}    The inmost portion of all the wings is a deep rich chocolate brown, then  comes a band of black, including a row of large blue spots, and succeeded  by an outer border of pale yellow tint, partially dappled with black  specks.    The _caterpillar_ feeds on the _willow_ (which accounts for its former  appearance in Camberwell). It is thorny, black, with white dots, and a row  of large red spots down the back.    The _chrysalis_ is very angular, and blackish with tawny spots.    The butterfly comes out of the chrysalis late in the autumn, and is seen  from August till October; but a great proportion of those observed in this  country have survived the winter, and have been seen abroad again in the  spring. It has been frequently seen feasting on over-ripe or rotten fruit,  and at such times may be often surprised and captured with ease.    No spot can be pointed out where one can _expect_ to meet with this fine  insect; but it has appeared singly at intervals in the following localities  among others:--Scotland, Ayrshire; Durham; Scarborough; York; Darlington;  Sheffield; Manchester; Lake District; Appleby; Coventry; Peterborough;  Oxford; Burton-on-Trent; Norfolk; Lincolnshire; Suffolk; Bristol; Ely;  Shrewsbury; Plymouth; Teignmouth; Kent; Ashford; Bromley; Tenterden;  Ramsgate; various places in neighbourhood of London; Epping; Hampshire;  Isle of Wight; Lewes; Worthing. {123}    On the Continent this is a common butterfly, in many places being the most  abundant of all the _Vanessas_.           *       *       *       *       *    THE LARGE TORTOISESHELL BUTTERFLY. (_Vanessa Polychloros._)    (Plate IX. fig. 1.)    The beginner often has a slight difficulty in finding a good and permanent  distinction between this species and the next (_V. Urticae_). At the first  blush, the superior size of this seems to be a sufficient mark, and then  the orange of the wings has usually a much browner, or more tawny hue, than  that of _Urticae_; but as I have seen specimens of _Polychloros absolutely  smaller_ than some very large _Urticae's_, and as the colour of both  occasionally varies, so that they approach each other in this respect also,  it is evident we must look for some better mark of distinction; and here  _is_ one. In _Polychloros_, _all_ the light markings between the black  spots on the upper edge of the front wing are _yellow_, whereas in  _Urticae_ the _outer one next the blue and black border is pure pearly_  WHITE. The two other marks on the front edge are yellow. _Polychloros_ has  also, near the _lower corner of the front wing, an extra black spot_, not  found in _Urticae_.    The blue spots on the border are in this species almost confined to the  hind wings. {124}    The _caterpillar_ generally feeds on the elm, whence the butterfly is  occasionally called the \"Elm Butterfly,\" but it has also been found on the  willow, and on the white beam-tree. Mr. Boscher of Twickenham informs me  that the specimens he has bred from caterpillars fed on the _willow_ have  been all far below the average size. The caterpillar is thorny, and of a  tawny colour, broadly striped with black along each side.    The _chrysalis_ is of a dull flesh colour, with golden spots.    The _butterfly_ makes its appearance in July and August, _hybernated_  specimens being also frequently seen in the spring, from March till May.    In some places and seasons it is not rare, but is very uncertain in its  appearance, abounding most in the southern districts, and being almost  unknown in Scotland. It is fond of gardens and other frequented places.           *       *       *       *       *    THE SMALL TORTOISESHELL BUTTERFLY. (_Vanessa Urticae._)    (Plate IX. fig. 2.)    This pretty species is much commoner than the last, being, in fact, the  most plentiful of all the _genus_, and found everywhere, in gardens, by  weedy road-sides and waste grounds, &c.    Its markings are very similar to those of the last, but the colouring is  much more gay and brilliant. {125}    The distinguishing mark of this species--the possession of a pure _white_  spot near the upper corner of the front wing--has been already pointed out  under _V. Polychloros_.    The blue crescent-spots of the border are much more marked than in the  last, and extend along the edge of the front wing. The orange colour also  approaches a _scarlet_, and the yellow spots have a brighter hue than in  _Polychloros_.    The _caterpillar_, which is found feeding in large companies on the nettle,  is of greyish colour, with a black line on the back, and brown and yellow  stripes on the sides. Thorny, like rest of the genus.    The _chrysalis_ is generally of a brown hue, spotted with gold, but I have  seen it gilded all over, making a very splendid appearance.    Hybernated individuals of this butterfly are seen during the spring months,  but the first emergence from the chrysalis takes place in June, and the  insect is seen on the wing constantly from that time till October.    The following interesting notice of the capture of a swarm of these  butterflies in _mid-winter_, is quoted, from the _Zoologist_, p. 5000. The  writer is a Mr. Banning, resident near Ballacraine, in the Isle of Man:--    \"Whilst standing in my farm-yard on the day following Christmas-day (1855),  it being unusually fine and warm, I was suddenly astonished by the fall of  {126} more than a hundred of the accompanying butterflies (_V. Urticae_). I  commenced at once collecting them, and succeeded in securing more than  sixty. These I have fed on sugar spread over cabbage-leaves and bran until  now, and, to all appearances, those which still survive (more than forty in  number) are thriving well, and in good condition.\"           *       *       *       *       *    THE COMMA BUTTERFLY. (_Grapta C. Album._)    (Plate IX. fig. 3.)    The singularly jagged outline of this butterfly at once distinguishes it  from every other native species, though, did we not know it as a distinct  species, it might have been taken for one of the two previous species very  much stunted, deformed, and torn, so similar is it in colour and the plan  of its markings.    The upper surface is deep fulvous, or rusty orange, and marked with black  and dark brown. In different individuals, the under side varies greatly in  its tints and markings, especially near the border of the wings, which are  sometimes of a deep rich olive brown, sometimes pale tawny. They all agree,  however, in bearing in the centre of the hind wings the character from  which the insect takes its specific name, viz. a white mark in form of the  letter C, which has also been likened with less justice to a , whence its  English name of \"Comma.\" {127}    The female is of a paler tint than the male, and the edges of the wings are  less deeply scalloped and cut. The figure is that of a male.    The _caterpillar_ is tawny-coloured; but the back, for about the hinder  half its length, is whitish; head black. The body is armed with short  spines, and there are two ear-like tubercles projecting from the side of  the head. It has been found feeding on the elm, willow, sloe, currant,  nettle, and hop.    The _chrysalis_ is of the curious shape shown at fig. 24, Plate I.; of a  brownish tint, with gold spots.    The _butterfly_ appears in July and August, and hybernated individuals in  the spring, up till May. Its range seems to be nearly confined to the  Midland and Western districts. It was formerly found near London, and in  other places, whence it has now disappeared.    The following localities are given for it:--Carlisle and the Lake district,  York, Green Hammerton (Yorkshire), Doncaster, Broomsgrove (Worcestershire),  Warwickshire, Peterborough, Scarborough, Barnwell Wold (Northamptonshire),  Bristol, Gloucester, Dorchester. I found it very plentiful on the banks of  the Wye, in 1858; and in the following May I took one in South Wales, at  Pont-y-Pridd. In Scotland, Fifeshire has been mentioned as a locality.    This is a rapid flyer, and not very easily caught when fresh on the wing.           *       *       *       *       *    {128}    THE SILVER-WASHED FRITILLARY (_Argynnis Paphia._)    (Plate IX. fig. 4, Male; 4 _a_, Female.)    The beautiful genus to which this butterfly belongs is distinguished by the  adornment of silvery spots and streaks with which the under side of the  hind wings is bedight; while the upper surface is chequered with black,  upon a rich golden-brown ground, the device reminding one of those  old-fashioned chequered flowers called \"fritillaries,\" whence the common  name of these butterflies.    Of all the British Fritillaries, this is, perhaps, the loveliest, from the  exquisite softness and harmony of the silvery pencillings on the iridescent  green of the under side; though some of the others with bright silver  _spots_ are gayer and more sparkling.    The two sexes differ considerably on the upper surface; the _male_ being  marked with black (as in the engraving) upon a bright orange-brown ground,  while the _female_ is without the broad black borders to the veins of the  front wings, and the ground colour is suffused with an olive-brown tint,  inclining sometimes to green. The black spots are also larger. Beneath,  however, both sexes are marked nearly alike with _washy streaks of silver_,  and not with defined spots. {129}    The _caterpillar_ (fig. 7, Plate I.), as with all the Fritillaries, is  thorny, with two spines behind the head longer than the rest; black, with  yellow lines along the back and sides. It feeds on violet leaves, also on  the wild raspberry and nettle.    The _chrysalis_ (fig. 16, Plate I.) is greyish, with the tubercles silvered  or gilt.    The _butterfly_ is out in July and August, and is not rare in the woods of  the South and Midland districts, but it also extends its range into  Scotland. On the banks of "]]]
