[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28897"],[0,"The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication, Volume II (of 2) (#18)"],[1,"has been well known for at least 130 years: it breeds perfectly true,      as I have been assured by those who have long kept many birds: it is      characterised by a peculiar tuft of feathers over the beak, by a crest      on the head, by a most peculiar coo quite unlike that of any other      breed, and by much-feathered feet. I have crossed both sexes with      turbits of two sub-breeds, with almond tumblers, spots, and runts, and      reared many mongrels and recrossed them; and though the crest on the      head and feathered feet were inherited (as is generally the case with      most breeds), I have never seen a vestige of the tuft over the beak or      heard the peculiar coo. Boitard and Corbie[145] assert that this is the      invariable result of crossing trumpeters with any other breed:      Neumeister,[146] however, states that in Germany mongrels have been      obtained, though very rarely, which were furnished with the tuft and      would trumpet: but a pair of these mongrels with a tuft, which I      imported, never trumpeted. Mr. Brent states[147] that the crossed      offspring of a trumpeter were crossed {67} with trumpeters for three      generations, by which time the mongrels had 7-8ths of this blood in      their veins, yet the tuft over the beak did not appear. At the fourth      generation the tuft appeared, but the birds, though now having 15-16ths      trumpeter's blood, still did not trumpet. This case well shows the wide      difference between inheritance and prepotency; for here we have a      well-established old race which transmits it characters faithfully, but      which, when crossed with any other race, has the feeblest power of      transmitting its two chief characteristic qualities.        I will give one other instance with fowls and pigeons of weakness and      strength in the transmission of the same character to their crossed      offspring. The Silk-fowl breeds true, and there is reason to believe is      a very ancient race; but when I reared a large number of mongrels from      a Silk-hen by a Spanish cock, not one exhibited even a trace of the      so-called silkiness. Mr. Hewitt also asserts that in no instance are      the silky feathers transmitted by this breed when crossed with any      other variety. But three birds out of many raised by Mr. Orton from a      cross between a silk-cock and a bantam-hen, had silky feathers.[148] So      that it is certain that this breed very seldom has the power of      transmitting its peculiar plumage to its crossed progeny. On the other      hand, there is a silk sub-variety of the fantail pigeon, which has its      feathers in nearly the same state as in the Silk-fowl: now we have      already seen that fantails, when crossed, possess singularly weak power      in transmitting their general qualities; but the silk sub-variety when      crossed with any other small-sized race invariably transmits its silky      feathers![149]        The law of prepotency comes into action when species are crossed, as      with races and individuals. Gaertner has unequivocally shown[150] that      this is the case with plants. To give one instance: when _Nicotiana      paniculata_ and _vincaeflora_ are crossed, the character of _N.      paniculata_ is almost completely lost in the hybrid; but if _N.      quadrivalvis_ be crossed with _N. vincaeflora_, this later species,      which was before so prepotent, now in its turn almost disappears under      the power of _N. quadrivalvis_. It is remarkable that the prepotency of      one species over another in transmission is quite independent, as shown      by Gaertner, of the greater or less facility with which the one      fertilises the other.        With animals, the jackal is prepotent over the dog, as is stated by      Flourens who made many crosses between these animals; and this was      likewise the case with a hybrid which I once saw between a jackal and      terrier. I cannot doubt, from the observations of Colin and others,      that the ass is prepotent over the horse; the prepotency in this      instance running more strongly through the male than through the female      ass; so that the mule resembles the ass more closely than does the      hinny.[151] The {68} male pheasant, judging from Mr. Hewitt's      descriptions,[152] and from the hybrids which I have seen,      preponderates over the domestic fowl; but the latter, as far as colour      is concerned, has considerable power of transmission, for hybrids      raised from five differently coloured hens differed greatly in plumage.      I formerly examined some curious hybrids in the Zoological Gardens,      between the Penguin variety of the common duck and the Egyptian goose      (_Tadorna Aegyptiaca_); and although I will not assert that the      domesticated variety preponderated over the natural species, yet it had      strongly impressed its unnatural upright figure on these hybrids.        I am aware that such cases as the foregoing have been ascribed by      various authors, not to one species, race, or individual being      prepotent over the other in impressing it character on its crossed      offspring, but to such rules as that the father influences the external      characters and the mother the internal or vital organs. But the great      diversity of the rules given by various authors almost proves their      falseness. Dr. Prosper Lucas has fully discussed this point, and has      shown[153] that none of the rules (and I could add others to those      quoted by him) apply to all animals. Similar rules have been enounced      for plants, and have been proved by Gaertner[154] to be all erroneous.      If we confine our view to the domesticated races of a single species,      or perhaps even to the species of the same genus, some such rules may      hold good; for instance, it seems that in reciprocally crossing various      breeds of fowls the male generally gives colour;[155] but conspicuous      exceptions have passed under my own eyes. In sheep it seems that the      ram usually gives its peculiar horns and fleece to its crossed      offspring, and the bull the presence or absence of horns.        In the following chapter on Crossing I shall have occasion to show that      certain characters are rarely or never blended by crossing, but are      {69} transmitted in an unmodified state from either parent-form; I      refer to this fact here because it is sometimes accompanied on the one      side by prepotency, which thus acquires the false appearance of unusual      strength. In the same chapter I shall show that the rate at which a      species or breed absorbs and obliterates another by repeated crosses,      depends in chief part on prepotency in transmission.    In conclusion, some of the cases above given,--for instance, that of the  trumpeter pigeon,--prove that there is a wide difference between mere  inheritance and prepotency. This latter power seems to us, in our  ignorance, to act in most cases quite capriciously. The very same  character, even though it be an abnormal or monstrous one, such as silky  feathers, may be transmitted by different species, when crossed, either  with prepotent force or singular feebleness. It is obvious, that a  purely-bred form of either sex, in all cases in which prepotency does not  run more strongly in one sex than the other, will transmit its character  with prepotent force over a mongrelized and already variable form.[156]  From several of the above-given cases we may conclude that mere antiquity  of character does not by any means necessarily make it prepotent. In some  cases prepotency apparently depends on the same character being present and  visible in one of the two breeds which are crossed, and latent or invisible  in the other breed; and in this case it is natural that the character which  is potentially present in both should be prepotent. Thus, we have reason to  believe that there is a latent tendency in all horses to be dun-coloured  and striped; and when a horse of this kind is crossed with one of any other  colour, it is said that the offspring are almost sure to be striped. Sheep  have a similar latent tendency to become dark-coloured, and we have seen  with what prepotent force a ram with a few black spots, when crossed with  sheep of various breeds, coloured its offspring. All pigeons have a latent  tendency to become slaty-blue, with certain characteristic marks, and it is  known that, when a bird thus coloured is crossed with one of any other  colour, it is most difficult afterwards to eradicate the blue tint. A  nearly parallel case is offered by those black bantams which, as they grow  {70} old, develop a latent tendency to acquire red feathers. But there are  exceptions to the rule: hornless breeds of cattle possess a latent capacity  to reproduce horns, yet when crossed with horned breeds they do not  invariably produce offspring bearing horns.    We meet with analogous cases with plants. Striped flowers, though they can  be propagated truly by seed, have a latent tendency to become uniformly  coloured, but when once crossed by a uniformly coloured variety, they ever  afterwards fail to produce striped seedlings.[157] Another case is in some  respects more curious: plants bearing peloric or regular flowers have so  strong a latent tendency to reproduce their normally irregular flowers,  that this often occurs by buds when a plant is transplanted into poorer or  richer soil.[158] Now I crossed the peloric snapdragon (_Antirrhinum  majus_), described in the last chapter, with pollen of the common form; and  the latter, reciprocally, with peloric pollen. I thus raised two great beds  of seedlings, and not one was peloric. Naudin[159] obtained the same result  from crossing a peloric Linaria with the common form. I carefully examined  the flowers of ninety plants of the crossed Antirrhinum in the two beds,  and their structure had not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2892"],[0,"Irish Fairy Tales (#18)"],[1,"requirements at her hand.    Becfola pushed the door of the king's sleeping chamber and entered  noiselessly. Then she sat quietly in a seat gazing on the recumbent  monarch, and prepared to consider how she should advance to him when  he awakened, and with what information she might stay his inquiries or  reproaches.    \"I will reproach him,\" she thought. \"I will call him a bad husband  and astonish him, and he will forget everything but his own alarm and  indignation.\"    But at that moment the king lifted his head from the pillow and looked  kindly at her. Her heart gave a great throb, and she prepared to speak  at once and in great volume before he could formulate any question.  But the king spoke first, and what he said so astonished her that the  explanation and reproach with which her tongue was thrilling fled  from it at a stroke, and she could only sit staring and bewildered and  tongue-tied.    \"Well, my dear heart,\" said the king, \"have you decided not to keep that  engagement?\"    \"I--I--!\" Becfola stammered.    \"It is truly not an hour for engagements,\" Dermod insisted, \"for not  a bird of the birds has left his tree; and,\" he continued maliciously,  \"the light is such that you could not see an engagement even if you met  one.\"    \"I,\" Becfola gasped. \"I---!\"    \"A Sunday journey,\" he went on, \"is a notorious bad journey. No good can  come from it. You can get your smocks and diadems to-morrow. But at this  hour a wise person leaves engagements to the bats and the staring owls  and the round-eyed creatures that prowl and sniff in the dark. Come back  to the warm bed, sweet woman, and set on your journey in the morning.\"    Such a load of apprehension was lifted from Becfola's heart that she  instantly did as she had been commanded, and such a bewilderment had yet  possession of her faculties that she could not think or utter a word on  any subject.    Yet the thought did come into her head as she stretched in the warm  gloom that Crimthann the son of Ae must be now attending her at  Cluain da chaillech, and she thought of that young man as of something  wonderful and very ridiculous, and the fact that he was waiting for  her troubled her no more than if a sheep had been waiting for her or a  roadside bush.    She fell asleep.        CHAPTER V    In the morning as they sat at breakfast four clerics were announced, and  when they entered the king looked on them with stern disapproval.    \"What is the meaning of this journey on Sunday?\" he demanded.    A lank-jawed, thin-browed brother, with uneasy, intertwining fingers,  and a deep-set, venomous eye, was the spokesman of those four.    \"Indeed,\" he said, and the fingers of his right hand strangled and did  to death the fingers of his left hand, \"indeed, we have transgressed by  order.\"    \"Explain that.\"    \"We have been sent to you hurriedly by our master, Molasius of  Devenish.\"    \"A pious, a saintly man,\" the king interrupted, \"and one who does not  countenance transgressions of the Sunday.\"    \"We were ordered to tell you as follows,\" said the grim cleric, and he  buried the fingers of his right hand in his left fist, so that one could  not hope to see them resurrected again. \"It was the duty of one of  the Brothers of Devenish,\" he continued, \"to turn out the cattle this  morning before the dawn of day, and that Brother, while in his duty, saw  eight comely young men who fought together.\"    \"On the morning of Sunday,\" Dermod exploded.    The cleric nodded with savage emphasis.    \"On the morning of this self-same and instant sacred day.\"    \"Tell on,\" said the king wrathfully.    But terror gripped with sudden fingers at Becfola's heart.    \"Do not tell horrid stories on the Sunday,\" she pleaded. \"No good can  come to any one from such a tale.\"    \"Nay, this must be told, sweet lady,\" said the king. But the cleric  stared at her glumly, forbiddingly, and resumed his story at a gesture.    \"Of these eight men, seven were killed.\"    \"They are in hell,\" the king said gloomily.    \"In hell they are,\" the cleric replied with enthusiasm.    \"And the one that was not killed?\"    \"He is alive,\" that cleric responded.    \"He would be,\" the monarch assented. \"Tell your tale.\"    \"Molasius had those seven miscreants buried, and he took from their  unhallowed necks and from their lewd arms and from their unblessed  weapons the load of two men in gold and silver treasure.\"    \"Two men's load!\" said Dermod thoughtfully.    \"That much,\" said the lean cleric. \"No more, no less. And he has sent us  to find out what part of that hellish treasure belongs to the Brothers  of Devenish and how much is the property of the king.\"    Becfola again broke in, speaking graciously, regally, hastily: \"Let  those Brothers have the entire of the treasure, for it is Sunday  treasure, and as such it will bring no luck to any one.\"    The cleric again looked at her coldly, with a harsh-lidded, small-set,  grey-eyed glare, and waited for the king's reply.    Dermod pondered, shaking his head as to an argument on his left side,  and then nodding it again as to an argument on his right.    \"It shall be done as this sweet queen advises. Let a reliquary be formed  with cunning workmanship of that gold and silver, dated with my date and  signed with my name, to be in memory of my grandmother who gave birth to  a lamb, to a salmon, and then to my father, the Ard-Ri'. And, as to the  treasure that remains over, a pastoral staff may be beaten from it in  honour of Molasius, the pious man.\"    \"The story is not ended,\" said that glum, spike-chinned cleric.    The king moved with jovial impatience.    \"If you continue it,\" he said, \"it will surely come to an end some time.  A stone on a stone makes a house, dear heart, and a word on a word tells  a tale.\"    The cleric wrapped himself into himself, and became lean and menacing.  He whispered: \"Besides the young man, named Flann, who was not slain,  there was another person present at the scene and the combat and the  transgression of Sunday.\"    \"Who was that person?\" said the alarmed monarch.    The cleric spiked forward his chin, and then butted forward his brow.    \"It was the wife of the king,\" he shouted. \"It was the woman called  Becfola. It was that woman,\" he roared, and he extended a lean,  inflexible, unending first finger at the queen.    \"Dog!\" the king stammered, starting up.    \"If that be in truth a woman,\" the cleric screamed.    \"What do you mean?\" the king demanded in wrath and terror.    \"Either she is a woman of this world to be punished, or she is a woman  of the Shi' to be banished, but this holy morning she was in the Shi',  and her arms were about the neck of Flann.\"    The king sank back in his chair stupefied, gazing from one to the other,  and then turned an unseeing, fear-dimmed eye towards Becfola.    \"Is this true, my pulse?\" he murmured.    \"It is true,\" Becfola replied, and she became suddenly to the king's eye  a whiteness and a stare. He pointed to the door.    \"Go to your engagement,\" he stammered. \"Go to that Flann.\"    \"He is waiting for me,\" said Becfola with proud shame, \"and the thought  that he should wait wrings my heart.\"    She went out from the palace then. She went away from Tara: and in all  Ireland and in the world of living men she was not seen again, and she  was never heard of again.          THE LITTLE BRAWL AT ALLEN        CHAPTER I    \"I think,\" said Cairell Whiteskin, \"that although judgement was given  against Fionn, it was Fionn had the rights of it.\"    \"He had eleven hundred killed,\" said Cona'n amiably, \"and you may call  that the rights of it if you like.\"    \"All the same--\" Cairell began argumentatively.    \"And it was you that commenced it,\" Cona'n continued.    \"Ho! Ho!\" Cairell cried. \"Why, you are as much to blame as I am.\"    \"No,\" said Cona'n, \"for you hit me first.\"    \"And if we had not been separated--\" the other growled.    \"Separated!\" said Cona'n, with a grin that made his beard poke all  around his face.    \"Yes, separated. If they had not come between us I still think--\"    \"Don't think out loud, dear heart, for you and I are at peace by law.\"    \"That is true,\" said Cairell, \"and a man must stick by a judgement. Come  with me, my dear, and let us see how the youngsters are shaping in the  school. One of them has rather a way with him as a swordsman.\"    \"No youngster is any good with a sword,\" Conan replied.    \"You are right there,\" said Cairell. \"It takes a good ripe man for that  weapon.\"    \"Boys are good enough with slings,\" Confro continued, \"but except for  eating their fill and running away from a fight, you can't count on  boys.\"    The two bulky men turned towards the school of the Fianna.    It happened that Fionn mac Uail had summoned the gentlemen of the Fianna  and their wives to a banquet. Everybody came, for a banquet given by  Fionn was not a thing to be missed. There was Goll mor mac Morna and his  people; Fionn's son Oisi'n and his grandson Oscar. There was Dermod of  the Gay Face, Caelte mac Ronan--but indeed there were too many to be  told of, for all the pillars of war and battle-torches of the Gael were  there.    The banquet began.    Fionn sat in the Chief Captain's seat in the middle of the fort; and  facing him, in the place of honour, he placed the mirthful Goll mac  Morna; and from these, ranging on either side, the nobles of the Fianna  took each the place that fitted his degree and patrimony.    After good eating, good conversation; and after good conversation,  sleep--that is the order of a banquet: so when each person had been  served with food to the limit of desire the butlers carried in shining,  and jewelled drinking-horns, each having its tide of smooth, heady  liquor. Then the young heroes grew merry and audacious, the ladies  became gentle and kind, and the poets became wonders of knowledge and  prophecy. Every eye beamed in that assembly, and on Fionn every eye was  turned continually in the hope of a glance"]]]
