[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22606"],[0,"The Booklover and His Books (#18)"],[1," the right size  drawn to the right degree of tension without missing a sheet. After the  sewing the end papers are put in place, the back is glued and rounded,  and the mill boards are fitted. Into these last the ends of the cords  are laced and hammered. The book is then pressed to set its shape, being  left in the press for some days or even weeks. After it is taken out, if  the edges are to be treated, they are trimmed and then gilded, marbled,  sprinkled, or otherwise decorated. The head band--for which many French  binders substitute a fold in the leather--is now added. It was formerly  twisted as the book was sewn, but at present is too often bought  ready-made and simply glued on. The book is now forwarded.    The business of the finisher is to cover and protect the work already  done on the book, but in such a way as not to interfere with the  strength and flexibility that have been gained, and, finally, to add  such decoration as may be artistically demanded or within the means of  the purchaser. If leather is employed, it must be carefully shaved to  give an easily opening hinge, yet not enough to weaken it unnecessarily.  This is a most important process and one that must be left largely to  the good faith of the binder. If he is unworthy of confidence, his  mistakes may long escape notice, but, though buried, they are doomed to  an inglorious resurrection, albeit he may count on a sufficient lapse of  time to protect himself.    The next and last process of finishing is that of the decorator, whose  work passes out of the sphere of handicraft into that of art. His  problem is no easy one; it is to take a surface of great beauty in  itself, as of calf or morocco, and so treat it as to increase its  beauty. Too often, after he has done his utmost, the surface is less  attractive to the eye than it was at the beginning. He, therefore, has a  task quite different from that of the painter or sculptor, whose  materials are not at the outset attractive. This condition is so  strongly felt that many booklovers leave their bindings untooled,  preferring the rich sensuous beauty and depth of color in a choice piece  of leather to any effect of gilding or inlaying. This initial beauty of  the undecorated book does not, however, form an impossible challenge, as  witness the work of the Eves, Le Gascon, and the binders of such famous  collectors as Grolier and de Thou.    It may be well to consider more particularly what the problem of the  book decorator is. Though perfectly obvious to the eye and clearly  illustrated by the work of the masters, it has been sometimes lost sight  of by recent binders. It is, in a word, flat decoration. In the first  place he has a surface to work upon that is large enough to allow  strength of treatment, yet small enough to admit delicacy; then,  whatever in beautiful effects of setting, relief, harmony, and contrast  can be brought about by blind tooling, gilding, and inlaying, or by  rubbing the surface as in crushed levant, or variegating it as in \"tree\"  or marbled calf, all this he can command. He has control of an infinite  variety of forms in tooling; he has only to use them with taste and  skill. There is practically no limit to the amount of work that he can  put into the binding of a single book, provided that every additional  stroke is an additional beauty. He may sow the leather with minute  ornament like Mearne, or set it off with a few significant lines like  Aldus or Roger Payne; all depends upon the treatment. If he is a master,  the end will crown the work; if not, then he should have stopped with  simple lettering and have left the demands of beauty to be satisfied by  the undecorated leather. Above all, let every decorator stick to flat  ornament. The moment that he ventures into the third dimension, or  perspective, that moment he invades the province of the draftsman or  painter. One does not care to walk over a rug or carpet that displays a  scene in perspective, neither does one wish to gaze into a landscape  wrought upon the cover of a book, only to have the illusion of depth  dispelled upon opening the volume. Embossing is, to be sure, a literal  not a pictorial invasion of the third dimension, but its intrusion into  that dimension is very slight and involves no cheating of the eye. It  has now practically gone out of use, as has the heavy medieval  ornamentation of studs or jewels. In cloth covers, which are confessedly  edition work and machine made, the rules of ornament need not be so  sharply enforced. Here embossing still flourishes to some extent. But  the decorative problem is essentially the same in cloth as in leather  binding, and the best design will be one that triumphs within the  conditions, not outside them. The machines and the division of labor  have made sad havoc with binding as a craft. The men in America, at  least, who are masters of every process and of all the skill and cunning  of the early binders are few, and their thinning ranks are not being  filled. Will bookbinding, in spite of a high economic demand, share the  fate that has overtaken engraving, or shall we have a renascence of this  fascinating handicraft and delightful art, to take its name from the  present era?          PARCHMENT BINDINGS      There are certain things, the Autocrat informs us, that are \"good for  nothing until they have been kept a long while; and some are good for  nothing until they have been long kept and _used_. Of the first, wine is  the illustrious and immortal example. Of those which must be kept and  used I will name three--meerschaum pipes, violins, and poems.\" May we  present another representative of the class which gathers value with the  \"process of the suns,\" one as immortal and historic as wine and even  richer in associations--the parchment book cover? In this case it  matters not whether the object meets with use or neglect. So long as it  is not actually worn to pieces on the one hand, nor destroyed by mold on  the other, the parchment binding will keep on converting time into gold,  until after a few hundred years it reaches a tint far surpassing in  beauty the richest umber of a meerschaum, and approached only by the  kindred hue of antique ivory.    Here is a table full of old parchment-bound books, ranging from a tiny  twenty-fourmo, which will stay neither open nor shut, to thin, limp  folios that are instantly correspondent to either command. Those that  are bound with boards have taken on a drumhead quality of smoothness and  tension, especially the fat quartos and small octavos, while the larger  volumes that received a flexible binding resemble nothing in surface so  much as the wrinkled diploma on yonder wall, with its cabalistic  signature now to be written no more, Carolus-Guil. Eliot; but all agree  in a tint over which artists rave, the color that gold would take if it  were capable of stain. But there is no stain here, or rather all stains  are taken up and converted into beauty. Dust, dirt, smudges, all are  here, and each is made to contribute a new element of charm. Is the  resultant more beautiful than the spotless original? Compare it with the  pearly tint of the diploma, or turn up the folded edge of one of those  flexible bindings and note the chalky white of the parchment's protected  under-surface. The same three hundred years that have made over Europe  and made English America have, as it were, filled in the rhythmic pauses  between their giant heart-beats by ripening Dr. Holmes's wine and  touching with Midas caress these parchment bindings!    It is surely a crime to keep such beauty of tint and tone hidden away in  drawers or all but hidden on crowded shelves. Let them be displayed in  open cases where all may enjoy them. But let us go softly; these  century-mellowed parchments are too precious to be displayed to  unappreciative, perhaps scornful, eyes. Put them away in their  hiding-places until some gentle reader of these lines shall ask for  them; then we will bring them forth and persuade ourselves that we can  detect a new increment of beauty added by the brief time since last we  looked on them. I once heard an address on a librarian's duty to his  successors. I will suggest a service not there mentioned: to choose  every year the best contemporary books that he can find worthily printed  on time-proof papers and have them bound in parchment; then let him  place them on his shelves to gather gold from the touch of the mellowing  years through the centuries to come and win him grateful memory such as  we bestow upon the unknown hands that wrought for these volumes the  garments of their present and still increasing beauty.          LEST WE FORGET THE FEW GREAT BOOKS      One result of the stir that has been made in library matters during the  last two generations, and especially during the latter, is the enormous  increase in the size of our libraries. In 1875 the public libraries of  the United States contained a little less than 11,500,000 volumes. In  the five years from 1908 to 1913 the libraries of 5,000 volumes and over  added nearly 20,000,000 volumes, making a total of over 75,000,000  volumes, an increase of 35.7 per cent. In 1875 there were 3682 libraries  of more than 300 volumes each; in 1913 there were 8302 libraries of over  1000 volumes each. In 1875 there were only nine libraries containing  100,000 volumes or over. These were the Library of Congress, 300,000;  Boston Public Library, 300,000; New York Mercantile Library, 160,000;  Harvard College Library, 154,000; Astor Library, 152,000; Philadelphia  Mercantile Library, 126,000; House of Representatives Library, 125,000;  Boston Athenaeum, 105,000; Library Company of Philadelphia, 104,000. In  1913 there were in this class 82 libraries, or over nine times as many,  including 14 libraries of 300,000 to 2,000,000 volumes, a class which  did not exist in 1875.    Meanwhile the individual book remains just what it always was, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22607"],[0,"The Book-Hunter in London (#18)"],[1,"collection--it  was sold in four parts, 1822-23--and perhaps on the whole much more  generally interesting. Evans, the auctioneer, described it as 'an  extraordinary assemblage of curious books, Early English poetry, old  tracts and miscellaneous literature.' The _cheval de bataille_ of the  fourth part consisted of 'a most Curious, Interesting and  Extraordinarily Extensive Assemblage of Political and Historical  Pamphlets of the Last and Present Century.' This collection was  comprised in thirty-five bundles. Perry made a speciality of facetiae,  pamphlets on the French Revolution, and Defoe's works, but the two  cornerstones of his library were a copy of the Mazarin Bible and a First  Folio Shakespeare.    Among the many book-collectors whose careers link the past century with  the present, few are more worthy of notice than Francis Douce, who died  in the spring of 1834, aged seventy-seven. He was for a short time  Keeper of the MSS. in the British Museum. His fortune was much increased  by being left one of the residuary legatees of Nollekens, the  sculptor--to the extent, in fact, of L50,000. Dibdin, who was for many  years a near neighbour and intimate friend at Kensington, describes  Douce's library as 'eminently rich and curious . . . not a book but what  had its fly-leaf written upon. In short, no man ever lived so much with,  and so entirely for, his books as did he.' Douce is the Prospero of the  'Bibliomania.' His books he bequeathed to the Bodleian, and his MSS. to  the British Museum, the stipulation in the latter case being that they  are not to be opened until 1900! In manners and appearance Douce was  singular and strange, rough to strangers, but gentle and kind to those  who knew him intimately. He was of the old school as regards dress,  wearing as he did a little flaxen wig, an old-fashioned square-cut coat,  with what M. Jacob calls 'quarto pockets.' Several of his letters are  printed in Dibdin's 'Literary Recollections.'    Two other distinguished book-collectors, contemporary with Douce, and,  like him, benefactors to the Bodleian, may be mentioned here--Richard  Gough (1739-1809), the antiquary; and Edmond Malone (1741-1812), the  Shakespearian scholar. Gough's gift consisted of the topographical  portion of his library; the remainder, comprising 4,373 lots, realizing  the total of L3,552, came under the hammer at Leigh and Sotheby's in  1810, realizing what were then considered very fancy prices (a selection  of which are given in the _Gentleman's Magazine_, lxxx., part ii.). The  Malone collection, which became the property of the Bodleian through the  influence of Lord Sunderlin in 1815, comprised what the collector  himself describes as 'the most curious, valuable, and extensive  collection ever assembled of ancient English plays and poetry.' It would  probably be impossible now to form another such collection. Malone told  Caldwell, who repeats the remarkable fact, that he had procured every  dramatic piece mentioned by Langbaine, excepting four or five--the  advantage, observes that gentleman, of living in London. The number of  volumes amounts to about 3,200. As his biographer, Sir James Prior, has  pointed out, his collection in the Bodleian remains distinct, and is  creditable 'alike to the industry, taste, and patience by which it was  brought together.' And further: 'None of his predecessors have attempted  what he accomplished. Few of his successors have, on most points, added  materially to our knowledge.' Yet a third benefactor to the Bodleian may  be conveniently mentioned here. Thomas Caldecott, who was born in 1744,  and died in 1833, was a Fellow of New College, Oxford, and afterwards a  Bencher of the Middle Temple. He resided chiefly at Dartford, and formed  a choice library of black-letter books, and the productions of the  Elizabethan period. He attacked with considerable asperity and ability  Shakespearian commentators, such as Steevens and Malone; and his rivals  did not spare his edition of two of Shakespeare's plays when they came  out. He presented the gems of his library, the Shakespeare quartos, to  the Bodleian; but the remainder of his books, including many excessively  rare and several unique pieces, came up for sale at Sotheby's in 1833,  and realized a total of L1,210 6s. 6d.    The splendid library of John Dent, of Hertford Street, sold by Evans in  1827, producing the sum of L15,040, had a curious history. The nucleus  of it was formed towards the close of the last century by Haughton  James, who, in a moment of conviviality, and without a due consideration  of its true value, transferred it to Robert Heathcote,[68:A] who made  several additions, and from whose possession it passed about 1807 into  that of John Dent. The sale of the Dent library is described by Dibdin  as exhibiting the 'first grand melancholy symptoms of the decay of the  Bibliomania.' The chief attraction was the Sweynheym and Pannartz Livy,  1469, on vellum, which fell (in more senses than one) under the hammer  for L262, Dent having paid L903 for it at Sir Mark Sykes' sale. Both the  purchasers, Payne and Foss, and Dibdin, made strenuous efforts to  persuade the Earl of Spencer to purchase it, but unsuccessfully; it  subsequently became the property of Grenville, and passed with his  collection into the British Museum. Dent is the Pontevallo of the  'Bibliomania,' and Baroccio of the 'Bibliographical Decameron,' and does  not seem to have been an altogether amiable specimen of the fraternity.  Canning used to say that he once found Dent deep in the study of an open  book which was upside down!    A much more genial bibliomaniac, Sir William Bolland, calls for notice;  he was one of the original members of the Roxburghe Club, which, in  fact, was first suggested at a dinner-party at his house, June 4, 1812.  He died May 14, 1840, aged sixty-eight, and his library, which comprised  2,940 lots, and realized L3,019, was sold by Evans, and included many  choice books. One of the greatest bargains which this distinguished  collector secured during his career became his property through the  medium of Benjamin Wheatley, who purchased a bundle of poetical tracts  from the Chapter Library at Lincoln for 80 guineas. When the inevitable  sale came, one of these trifles, 'The Rape of Lucrece,' alone realized  100 guineas.    George Chalmers (1742-1825), who is described as 'the most learned and  the most celebrated of all the antiquaries and historians of Scotland,'  was also one of the giant book-collectors of the present century, and  differed from the majority of collectors in being a prolific and  versatile author. At his death his nephew became the possessor of his  extensive library, but on the death of the nephew the books were placed  in the hands of Evans, who sold them in two parts, September, 1841, and  February, 1842, and realized over L4,100. The second part was very rich  in Shakespeariana, and included the 'Sonnets,' 1609, L105; 'Midsummer  Night's Dream,' 1600 (second edition), L105; and many other important  items. In the first part of the sale, Marlowe's 'Tragedie of Richard,  Duke of York,' 1595 (believed to be unique), sold for L131; and the only  perfect copy then known of Patrick Hannay's 'Nightingale,' 1622, from  the libraries of Bindley, Perry, Sykes and Rice, L13 5s. The third part  of Chalmers' library, which consisted for the most part of works  relative to Scotland, particularly in illustration of the History of  Printing in that Country, was also sold by Evans in 1842. Among other  book-collectors of this period we may mention particularly the Rev.  Henry Joseph Thomas Drury, whose library was rich in classics, all for  the most part finely bound; it came under the hammer at Evans's in 1827  (4,729 lots); Dr. Isaac Gosset, who died in 1812, in his sixty-eighth  year, and whose library, comprising 5,740 lots, realized L3,141 7s. 6d.  at Leigh and Sotheby's in 1813; the Rev. Jonathan Boucher (1738-1804),  Vicar of Epsom, who, like George Chalmers, for many years resided in  America, was, also like him, an inveterate book-collector to whom  everything in the shape of a book was welcome: his sale occupied Leigh  and Sotheby thirty-nine days, in 1806, the total being over L4,510.      III.    The history of the second and third quarters of the present century  makes mention of very few collectors of the first rank. Among the more  important of those whose libraries came under the hammer within that  period, we may specially refer to the following: William Upcott, who  started early in life as an assistant to R. H. Evans, but who in 1806  became sub-librarian of the London Institution. He was one of the first  to take up autograph-collecting, of which, indeed, he has been termed  the pioneer. He certainly collected with great advantage and knowledge,  and his vast accumulations were sold at Sotheby's in four batches  during 1846, he having died in September, 1845; John Hugh Smyth Piggott,  whose library, in three portions, was sold at the same place, 1847-54;  W. Y. Ottley, the prolific writer of books on art, 1849; W. Holgate, of  the Post Office, whose library included a number of Shakespeariana,  June, 1846; Hanrott, 1857; Sir Thomas Bernard, 1855; Isaac D'Israeli,  the author of 'Curiosities of Literature,' in 1849, and his unsparing  critic, Bolton Corney, in 1871; S. W. Singer, in four parts, 1860; J.  Orchard Halliwell (afterwards Halliwell-Phillipps), in 1856, 1857, and  1859; and the Rev. Dr. Hawtrey, part of whose books were sold, far below  their worth, in 1853, and the rest nine years later. Many of the  foregoing were literary men, who aimed rather at getting together a  useful library than one of rarities. The sale of all such libraries  makes a very sorry show beside that of the more ostentatious  collections. For instance, the books which Macaulay used with such  brilliant effect, and including among them an extraordinary number of  tracts,"]]]
