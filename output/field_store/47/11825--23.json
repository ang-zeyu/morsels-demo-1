There's nothing to be  afeared about, and there's no danger at all.\"    John Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone,  but she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the  fastening of the doors that night, and that he carefully cleaned and  loaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom.          CHAPTER IV. A FLIGHT FOR LIFE.      ON the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet,  John Ferrier went in to Salt Lake City, and having found his  acquaintance, who was bound for the Nevada Mountains, he entrusted him  with his message to Jefferson Hope. In it he told the young man of the  imminent danger which threatened them, and how necessary it was that he  should return. Having done thus he felt easier in his mind, and returned  home with a lighter heart.    As he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to  each of the posts of the gate. Still more surprised was he on entering  to find two young men in possession of his sitting-room. One, with a  long pale face, was leaning back in the rocking-chair, with his feet  cocked up upon the stove. The other, a bull-necked youth with coarse  bloated features, was standing in front of the window with his hands in  his pocket, whistling a popular hymn. Both of them nodded to Ferrier as  he entered, and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the conversation.    \"Maybe you don't know us,\" he said. \"This here is the son of Elder  Drebber, and I'm Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the desert  when the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the true  fold.\"    \"As He will all the nations in His own good time,\" said the other in a  nasal voice; \"He grindeth slowly but exceeding small.\"    John Ferrier bowed coldly. He had guessed who his visitors were.    \"We have come,\" continued Stangerson, \"at the advice of our fathers to  solicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to  you and to her. As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has  seven, it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one.\"    \"Nay, nay, Brother Stangerson,\" cried the other; \"the question is not  how many wives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has now  given over his mills to me, and I am the richer man.\"    \"But my prospects are better,\" said the other, warmly. \"When the  Lord removes my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather  factory. Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church.\"    \"It will be for the maiden to decide,\" rejoined young Drebber, smirking  at his own reflection in the glass. \"We will leave it all to her  decision.\"    During this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway,  hardly able to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two visitors.    \"Look here,\" he said at last, striding up to them, \"when my daughter  summons you, you can come, but until then I don't want to see your faces  again.\"    The two young Mormons stared at him in amazement. In their eyes this  competition between them for the maiden's hand was the highest of  honours both to her and her father.    \"There are two ways out of the room,\" cried Ferrier; \"there is the door,  and there is the window. Which do you care to use?\"    His brown face looked so savage, and his gaunt hands so threatening,  that his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat. The  old farmer followed them to the door.    \"Let me know when you have settled which it is to be,\" he said,  sardonically.    \"You shall smart for this!\" Stangerson cried, white with rage. \"You have  defied the Prophet and the Council of Four. You shall rue it to the end  of your days.\"    \"The hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you,\" cried young Drebber; \"He  will arise and smite you!\"    \"Then I'll start the smiting,\" exclaimed Ferrier furiously, and would  have rushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm and  restrained him. Before he could escape from her, the clatter of horses'  hoofs told him that they were beyond his reach.    \"The young canting rascals!\" he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration from  his forehead; \"I would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than the  wife of either of them.\"    \"And so should I, father,\" she answered, with spirit; \"but Jefferson  will soon be here.\"    \"Yes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for we  do not know what their next move may be.\"    It was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and  help should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted  daughter. In the whole history of the settlement there had never been  such a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders. If  minor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this  arch rebel. Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no  avail to him. Others as well known and as rich as himself had been  spirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church. He  was a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors which  hung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip, but  this suspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his daughter,  however, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she,  with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease.    He expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from  Young as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an  unlooked-for manner. Upon rising next morning he found, to his surprise,  a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over  his chest. On it was printed, in bold straggling letters:--    \"Twenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then----\"    The dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been. How  this warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his  servants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been  secured. He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter, but  the incident struck a chill into his heart. The twenty-nine days were  evidently the balance of the month which Young had promised. What  strength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such  mysterious powers? The hand which fastened that pin might have struck  him to the heart, and he could never have known who had slain him.    Still more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to their  breakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the  centre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently,  the number 28. To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did not  enlighten her. That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and  ward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27 had  been painted upon the outside of his door.    Thus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that his  unseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some  conspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the  month of grace. Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls,  sometimes upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placards  stuck upon the garden gate or the railings. With all his vigilance John  Ferrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded. A  horror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of  them. He became haggard and restless, and his eyes had the troubled look  of some hunted creature. He had but one hope in life now, and that was  for the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada.    Twenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no news  of the absentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still there  came no sign of him. Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or a  driver shouted at his team, the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking  that help had arrived at last. At last, when he saw five give way to  four and that again to three, he lost heart, and abandoned all hope of  escape. Single-handed, and with his limited knowledge of the mountains  which surrounded the settlement, he knew that he was powerless. The  more-frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded, and none could  pass along them without an order from the Council. Turn which way he  would, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him.  Yet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life itself  before he consented to what he regarded as his daughter's dishonour.    He was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles, and  searching vainly for some way out of them. That morning had shown the  figure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the next day would be the last  of the allotted time. What was to happen then? All manner of vague and  terrible fancies filled his imagination. And his daughter--what was to  become of her after he was gone? Was there no escape from the invisible  network which was drawn all round them. He sank his head upon the table  and sobbed at the thought of his own impotence.    What was that? In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound--low,  but very distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from the door of  the house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There  was a pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound was  repeated. Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the  panels of the door. Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry  out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal? Or was it some agent  who was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived. John Ferrier  felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook  his nerves and chilled his heart. Springing forward he drew the bolt and  threw the door open.    Outside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars were  twinkling brightly overhead.

Skin the pistaches in warm water and grind them very fine with a  tablespoonful of the sugar, then put in a saucepan with the yolks and  the sugar, mixing everything together. Add the milk and put the mixture  on the fire stirring with the ladle and when it is condensed like cream,  let it cool and put in the freezer.      221    TUTTI FRUTTI    To make this ice a special ice cream mold is necessary, or a tin  receptacle that can be closed hermetically.    Take several varieties of fruits of the season, ripe and of good  quality, that is to say, strawberries, cherries, plums, apricots, a big  peach, a good sized pear, a piece of good cantaloupe. Peel, skin and  remove stones and cores of all these fruits. Then cut them into very  thin slices, throwing away the cores and stones.    When the fruit is prepared in this manner, weigh it, and sprinkle over  one fifth of its weight of powdered sugar, squeezing also one lemon.  Mix everything and let the mixture rest for half an hour.    Put a sheet of paper in the bottom of the mold that is to be filled with  the fruit pressed together, close, and pack in salt and ice, keeping it  for two hours or a little less.    This is not the =tutti frutti= ice cream as is known in America, but a  =macedoine= of fruits, that comes very pleasant to the taste in the  summer months.
