And she should  also tell of other girls who married into great families, and being  troubled by rival wives, became wretched and miserable, and were finally  abandoned. She should further speak of the good fortune, the continual  happiness, the chastity, obedience, and affection of the man, and if the  girl gets amorous about him, she should endeavour to allay her shame[51]  and her fear as well as her suspicions about any disaster that might  result from the marriage. In a word, she should act the whole part of a  female messenger by telling the girl all about the man's affection for  her, the places he frequented, and the endeavours he made to meet her,  and by frequently repeating, \"It will be all right if the man will take  you away forcibly and unexpectedly.\"      _The Forms of Marriage._    When the girl is gained over, and acts openly with the man as his wife,  he should cause fire to be brought from the house of a Brahman, and  having spread the Kusha grass upon the ground, and offered an oblation  to the fire he should marry her according to the precepts of the  religious law. After this he should inform his parents of the fact,  because it is the opinion of ancient authors that a marriage solemnly  contracted in the presence of fire cannot afterwards be set aside.    After the consummation of the marriage, the relations of the man should  gradually be made acquainted with the affair, and the relations of the  girl should also be apprised of it in such a way that they may consent  to the marriage, and overlook the manner in which it was brought about,  and when this is done they should afterwards be reconciled by  affectionate presents and favourable conduct. In this manner the man  should marry the girl according to the Gandharva form of marriage.    When the girl cannot make up her mind, or will not express her readiness  to marry, the man should obtain her in any one of the following ways:--    (1). On a fitting occasion, and under some excuse, he should by means of  a female friend with whom he is well acquainted, and whom he can trust,  and who also is well known to the girl's family, get the girl brought  unexpectedly to his house, and he should then bring fire from the house  of a Brahman, and proceed as before described.    (2.) When the marriage of the girl with some other person draws near,  the man should disparage the future husband to the utmost in the mind of  the mother of the girl, and then having got the girl to come with her  mother's consent to a neighbouring house, he should bring fire from the  house of a Brahman, and proceed as above.    (3.) The man should become a great friend of the brother of the girl,  the said brother being of the same age as himself, and addicted to  courtesans, and to intrigues with the wives of other people, and should  give him assistance in such matters, and also give him occasional  presents. He should then tell him about his great love for his sister,  as young men will sacrifice even their lives for the sake of those who  may be of the same age, habits, and dispositions as themselves. After  this the man should get the girl brought by means of her brother to some  secure place, and having brought fire from the house of a Brahman,  should proceed as before.    (4.) The man should on the occasion of festivals get the daughter of the  nurse to give the girl some intoxicating substance, and then cause her  to be brought to some secure place under the pretence of some business,  and there having enjoyed her before she recovers from her intoxication,  should bring fire from the house of a Brahman, and proceed as before.    (5.) The man should, with the connivance of the daughter of the nurse,  carry off the girl from her house while she is asleep, and then, having  enjoyed her before she recovers from her sleep, should bring fire from  the house of a Brahman, and proceed as before.    (6.) When the girl goes to a garden, or to some village in the  neighbourhood, the man should, with his friends, fall on her guards, and  having killed them, or frightened them away, forcibly carry her off, and  proceed as before.    There are verses on the subject as follows:--In all the forms of  marriage given in this chapter of this work, the one that precedes is  better than the one that follows it, on account of its being more in  accordance with the commands of religion, and therefore it is only when  it is impossible to carry the former into practice that the latter  should be resorted to. As the fruit of all good marriages is love, the  Gandharva[52] form of marriage is respected, even though it is formed  under unfavourable circumstances, because it fulfils the object sought  for. Another cause of the respect accorded to the Gandharva form of  marriage is, that it brings forth happiness, causes less trouble in its  performance than any other forms of marriage, and is above all the  result of previous love.    FOOTNOTE:    [Footnote 50: These forms of marriage differ from the four kinds of  marriage mentioned in Chapter I., and are only to be made use of when  the girl is gained over in the way mentioned in Chapters III. and IV.]    [Footnote 51: About this, see a story on the fatal effects of love at  page 114 of \"Early Ideas; a Group of Hindoo Stories,\" collected and  collated by Anaryan.

Burton's \"Vickram and the Vampire; or Tales of  Hindu Devilry.\" Longman, Green & Co., London, 1870. This form of  matrimony was recognised by the ancient Hindus, and is frequent in  books. It is a kind of Scotch Wedding--ultra-Caledonian--taking place by  mutual consent without any form or ceremony.

ON THE MANNER OF LIVING OF A VIRTUOUS WOMAN, AND OF HER BEHAVIOUR DURING  THE ABSENCE OF HER HUSBAND.      A virtuous woman, who has affection for her husband, should act in  conformity with his wishes as if he were a divine being, and with his  consent should take upon herself the whole care of his family. She  should keep the whole house well cleaned, and arrange flowers of various  kinds in different parts of it, and make the floor smooth and polished  so as to give the whole a neat and becoming appearance. She should  surround the house with a garden, and place ready in it all the  materials required for the morning, noon and even sacrifices. Moreover  she should herself revere the sanctuary of the Household Gods, for says  Gonardiya, \"nothing so much attracts the heart of a householder to his  wife as a careful observance of the things mentioned above.\"    Towards the parents, relations, friends, sisters, and servants of her  husband she should behave as they deserve. In the garden she should  plant beds of green vegetables, bunches of the sugar cane, and clumps of  the fig tree, the mustard plant, the parsley plant, the fennel plant,  and the xanthochymus pictorius. Clusters of various flowers, such as the  trapa bispinosa, the jasmine, the gasminum grandiflorum, the yellow  amaranth, the wild jasmine, the tabernamontana coronaria, the  nadyaworta, the china rose and others, should likewise be planted,  together with the fragrant grass andropogon schaenanthus, and the  fragrant root of the plant andropogon miricatus. She should also have  seats and arbours made in the garden, in the middle of which a well,  tank, or pool should be dug.    The wife should always avoid the company of female beggars, female  buddish mendicants, unchaste and roguish women, female fortune tellers  and witches. As regards meals she should always consider what her  husband likes and dislikes, and what things are good for him, and what  are injurious to him. When she hears the sounds of his footsteps coming  home she should at once get up, and be ready to do whatever he may  command her, and either order her female servant to wash his feet, or  wash them herself. When going anywhere with her husband, she should put  on her ornaments, and without his consent she should not either give or  accept invitations, or attend marriages and sacrifices, or sit in the  company of female friends, or visit the temples of the Gods. And if she  wants to engage in any kind of games or sports, she should not do it  against his will. In the same way she should always sit down after him,  and get up before him, and should never awaken him when he is asleep.  The kitchen should be situated in a quiet and retired place, so as not  to be accessible to strangers, and should always look clean.    In the event of any misconduct on the part of her husband, she should  not blame him excessively though she be a little displeased. She should  not use abusive language towards him, but rebuke him with conciliatory  words, whether he be in the company of friends or alone. Moreover, she  should not be a scold, for says Gonardiya, \"there is no cause of dislike  on the part of a husband so great as this characteristic in a wife.\"  Lastly she should avoid bad expressions, sulky looks, speaking aside,  standing in the doorway, and looking at passers-by, conversing in the  pleasure groves, and remaining in a lonely place for a long time; and  finally she should always keep her body, her teeth, her hair, and  everything belonging to her tidy, sweet, and clean.    When the wife wants to approach her husband in private her dress should  consist of many ornaments, various kinds of flowers, and a cloth  decorated with different colours, and some sweet-smelling ointments or  unguents. But her every-day dress should be composed of a thin,  close-textured cloth, a few ornaments and flowers, and a little scent,  not too much.

The little crowd which had stood in a compact mass round the table,  began to break up into sundry small groups: laughter and desultory talk,  checked for a moment by that oppressive sense of unknown danger, which  had weighed on the spirits of those present, once more became general.  Blakeney's light-heartedness had put everyone into good-humour; since he  evidently did not look upon the challenge as a matter of serious moment,  why then, no one else had any cause for anxiety, and the younger men  were right glad to join in that bowl of punch which their genial host  had offered with so merry a grace.    Lacqueys appeared, throwing open the doors. From a distance the sound of  dance music once more broke upon the ear.    A few of the men only remained silent, deliberately holding aloof from  the renewed mirthfulness. Foremost amongst these was His Royal Highness,  who was looking distinctly troubled, and who had taken Sir Percy by  the arm, and was talking to him with obvious earnestness. Lord Anthony  Dewhurst and Lord Hastings were holding converse in a secluded corner of  the room, whilst Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, as being the host's most intimate  friend, felt it incumbent on him to say a few words to ex-Ambassador  Chauvelin.    The latter was desirous of effecting a retreat. Blakeney's invitation to  join in the friendly bowl of punch could not be taken seriously, and the  Terrorist wanted to be alone, in order to think out the events of the  past hour.    A lacquey waited on him, took the momentous sword from his hand, found  his hat and cloak and called his coach for him: Chauvelin having taken  formal leave of his host and acquaintances, quickly worked his way to  the staircase and hall, through the less frequented apartments.    He sincerely wished to avoid meeting Lady Blakeney face to face. Not  that the slightest twinge of remorse disturbed his mind, but he feared  some impulsive action on her part, which indirectly might interfere with  his future plans. Fortunately no one took much heed of the darkly-clad,  insignificant little figure that glided so swiftly by, obviously  determined to escape attention.    In the hall he found Demoiselle Candeille waiting for him. She, too, had  evidently been desirous of leaving Blakeney Manor as soon as possible.  He saw her to her chaise; then escorted her as far as her lodgings,  which were close by: there were still one or two things which he wished  to discuss with her, one or two final instructions which he desired to  give.    One the whole, he was satisfied with his evening's work: the young  actress had well supported him, and had played her part so far with  marvellous sang-froid and skill. Sir Percy, whether willingly or  blindly, had seemed only too ready to walk into the trap which was being  set for him.    This fact alone disturbed Chauvelin not a little, and as half an hour  or so later, having taken final leave of his ally, he sat alone in the  coach, which was conveying him back to town, the sword of Lorenzo Cenci  close to his hand, he pondered very seriously over it.    That the adventurous Scarlet Pimpernel should have guessed all along,  that sooner or later the French Revolutionary Government--whom he had  defrauded of some of its most important victims,--would desire to be  even with him, and to bring him to the scaffold, was not to be wondered  at. But that he should be so blind as to imagine that Chauvelin's  challenge was anything else but a lure to induce him to go to France,  could not possibly be supposed. So bold an adventurer, so keen an  intriguer was sure to have scented the trap immediately, and if he  appeared ready to fall into it, it was because there had already sprung  up in his resourceful mind some bold coup or subtle counterplan, with  which he hoped to gratify his own passionate love of sport, whilst once  more bringing his enemies to discomfiture and humiliation.    Undoubtedly Sir Percy Blakeney, as an accomplished gentleman of the  period, could not very well under the circumstances which had been so  carefully stage-managed and arranged by Chauvelin, refuse the latter's  challenge to fight him on the other side of the Channel. Any hesitation  on the part of the leader of that daring Scarlet Pimpernel League would  have covered him with a faint suspicion of pusillanimity, and a subtle  breath of ridicule, and in a moment the prestige of the unknown and  elusive hero would have vanished forever.    But apart from the necessity of the fight, Blakeney seemed to enter  into the spirit of the plot directed against his own life, with such  light-hearted merriment, such zest and joy, that Chauvelin could not  help but be convinced that the capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel at  Boulogne or elsewhere would not prove quite so easy a matter as he had  at first anticipated.    That same night he wrote a long and circumstantial letter to his  colleague, Citizen Robespierre, shifting thereby, as it were, some of  the responsibility of coming events from his own shoulders on to the  executive of the Committee of Public Safety.    \"I guarantee to you, Citizen Robespierre,\" he wrote, \"and to the members  of the Revolutionary Government who have entrusted me with the delicate  mission, that four days from this date at one hour after sunset, the man  who goes by the mysterious name of the Scarlet Pimpernel, will be on the  ramparts of Boulogne on the south side of the town. I have done what has  been asked of me. On that day and at that hour, I shall have brought  the enemy of the Revolution, the intriguer against the policy of the  republic, within the power of the government which he has flouted and  outraged. Now look to it, citizens all, that the fruits of my diplomacy  and of my skill be not lost to France again. The man will be there at my  bidding, 'tis for you to see that he does not escape this time.\"    This letter he sent by special courier which the National Convention  had placed at his disposal in case of emergency. Having sealed it and  entrusted it to the man, Chauvelin felt at peace with the world and with  himself. Although he was not so sure of success as he would have wished,  he yet could not see _how_ failure could possibly come about: and the  only regret which he felt to-night, when he finally in the early dawn  sought a few hours' troubled rest, was that that momentous fourth day  was still so very far distant.          Chapter XIV: The Ruling Passion        In the meanwhile silence had fallen over the beautiful old manorial  house. One by one the guests had departed, leaving that peaceful sense  of complete calm and isolation which follows the noisy chatter of any  great throng bent chiefly on enjoyment.    The evening had been universally acknowledged to have been brilliantly  successful. True, the much talked of French artiste had not sung the  promised ditties, but in the midst of the whirl and excitement of  dances, of the inspiring tunes of the string band, the elaborate supper  and recherche wines, no one had paid much heed to this change in the  programme of entertainments.    And everyone had agreed that never had Lady Blakeney looked more  radiantly beautiful than on this night. She seemed absolutely  indefatigable; a perfect hostess, full of charming little attentions  towards every one, although more than ordinarily absorbed by her duties  towards her many royal guests.    The dramatic incidents which had taken place in the small boudoir had  not been much bruited abroad. It was always considered bad form in  those courtly days to discuss men's quarrels before ladies, and in this  instance, those who were present when it all occurred instinctively felt  that their discretion would be appreciated in high circles, and held  their tongues accordingly.    Thus the brilliant evening was brought to a happy conclusion without a  single cloud to mar the enjoyment of the guests. Marguerite performed a  veritable miracle of fortitude, forcing her very smiles to seem natural  and gay, chatting pleasantly, even wittily, upon every known fashionable  topic of the day, laughing merrily the while her poor, aching heart was  filled with unspeakable misery.    Now, when everybody had gone, when the last of her guests had bobbed  before her the prescribed curtsey, to which she had invariably responded  with the same air of easy self-possession, now at last she felt free to  give rein to her thoughts, to indulge in the luxury of looking her own  anxiety straight in the face and to let the tension of her nerves relax.    Sir Andrew Ffoulkes had been the last to leave and Percy had strolled  out with him as far as the garden gate, for Lady Ffoulkes had left in  her chaise some time ago, and Sir Andrew meant to walk to his home, not  many yards distant from Blakeney Manor.    In spite of herself Marguerite felt her heartstrings tighten as she  thought of this young couple so lately wedded. People smiled a  little when Sir Andrew Ffoulkes' name was mentioned, some called him  effeminate, others uxorious, his fond attachment for his pretty little  wife was thought to pass the bounds of decorum. There was no doubt that  since his marriage the young man had greatly changed. His love of sport  and adventure seemed to have died out completely, yielding evidently to  the great, more overpowering love, that for his young wife.    Suzanne was nervous for her husband's safety. She had sufficient  influence over him to keep him at home, when other members of the brave  little League of The Scarlet Pimpernel followed their leader with mad  zest, on some bold adventure.    Marguerite too at first had smiled in kindly derision when Suzanne  Ffoulkes, her large eyes filled with tears, had used her wiles to keep  Sir Andrew tied to her own dainty apronstrings. But somehow, lately,  with that gentle contempt which she felt for the weaker man, there had  mingled a half-acknowledged sense of envy.    How different 'twixt"]]]
