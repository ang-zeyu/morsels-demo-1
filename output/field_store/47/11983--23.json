Now, my  dear, why don't you throw yourself into your father's arms, and tell him  all your troubles, just as you have me?\"    \"I wouldn't dare,\" said Bee in such a tone of reverence that the lady  broke into a musical peal of laughter. \"You would understand if you  knew him, Mrs. Medulla. There is no one quite like him. He is so  learned, so reserved, so--\"    \"Tut, tut! He may be all that, but still he is a man. He may be just  waiting for some token of love and affection from you. Remember,  Beatrice, you know more of him than he does of you. You have been where  you could talk with your aunt and uncle about him, while he knows you  only by your letters. As you show yourself to him now, so he must judge  of you.\"    \"I see,\" mused Bee thoughtfully.    \"We are through with your mistakes, Beatrice. Did you know that you have  some claims to beauty yourself?\"    \"What?\" gasped Bee, so amazed that Mrs. Medulla laughed again.    \"Am I telling secrets?\" she asked.    \"But, but I am not fair. My hair is dark, and my eyes are almost black.\"    \"There are more kinds of beauty than one, Beatrice. Yours is the kind  that will increase with years. The Ugly Duckling sort which develops  into a beautiful Swan.\"    \"Is it true?\" asked the girl breathlessly. \"No one ever told me that  before. Aunt Annie used to say that my only claim to beauty lay in the  expressiveness of my face.\"    \"And in that very expressiveness lies the difficulty. When you are  bright and happy you are at your best. Sparkle and animation give you a  charm that is more than beauty of skin, or regularity of feature. Grief  robs you of this; so, if for no other reason, you should strive to put  unhappiness from you. Women who have been considered great beauties have  not always had perfect features, or flawless complexions; but they held  sway by grace of manner, and that indefinable thing called charm. You  are of this class. I am telling you this, little girl, not to make you  vain, but to give you confidence. Do you know why no one has told you  this before?\"    \"No,\" replied Bee. \"Why?\"    \"Because, while one feels it, there is a sort of carelessness in your  dress that detracts from your appearance.\"    Bee flushed scarlet, and put up her hand quickly to adjust her twisted  neck ribbon.    \"I do just throw my things on,\" she murmured.    \"A maiden should be exquisitely neat always. Even a scientific man will  be influenced by externals. Such a man might not be able to tell what  was wrong, but he would be conscious of some disturbing element. If you  are careless in your dress your father will unconsciously draw  comparisons between you and your cousin. No girl can afford to be dowdy  in appearance. She should make herself as neat and tidy as possible, and  then think no more of her dress. Just a few more remarks and I will have  finished my little sermon, if a talk on beauty may be called such. You  will not mind if I say now, that there is much, much truth in the homely  saying that you quoted: 'Handsome is that handsome does.' A winsome,  lovable personality is worth all the beauty in the world.    \"It is a fact that the girl who thinks kind thoughts, and does good  deeds is a great deal more attractive than the one who thinks only of  herself. The face reflects the mind far more than girls realize, and as  a matter of looks alone a girl cannot afford to be other than sweet and  loving. Unselfishness, kindness, thoughtfulness, all help to make the  plainest face beautiful, and years will not detract from its charm.\"    She paused a moment, and then added:    \"Not that I would decry loveliness of person child. It is a gift of  Heaven and should be valued as such, but that alone is not everything.  Cultivate exquisite neatness of person, and above all, be your own  bright self, and I feel sure that it will be but a short time until you  will be all in all to your father. And, child, when he looks at your  cousin, rise above any little hardness that you may feel toward her. He  looks at her as he would at some beautiful picture. It is the same  sensation, caused by the same appreciation of beauty. Do you do  likewise, and admire her with him. He will admit your good taste, and  end by admiring you. Put on your best dress for tonight, and make him as  proud of you as you did yesterday. You can do it.\"    \"I _will_ do it,\" said Bee with determination. \"I have been hateful  about the dinner. I have not ordered anything for tonight. Mrs. Medulla,  you are the sweetest woman that I have ever known.\"    \"Don't be too grateful, Beatrice. Wait and see how things turn out. I  know that you will succeed. Come tell me about it tomorrow.\"    \"I will.\" Beatrice tripped lightly away; no longer troubled and unhappy,  but full of the buoyancy of hope.          Chapter XV    The Arrival of Adele        \"If any loss thou hast to rue,      Act as though thou wert born anew;      Inquire the meaning of each day,      What each day means, itself will say;      Ne'er let thy breast with hate be supplied,      And to God the future confide.\"        --_Goethe._      There was a look of anxiety on Doctor Raymond's face as he drove up to  the house that evening. Adele's countenance, too, clouded as she glanced  about for her cousin, but no Bee was to be seen. The scientist assisted  his niece from the carriage, turned the vehicle over to Joel, and  started up the steps. All men dread scenes with their women folk, and he  was no exception to the rule.    \"Tired, Adele?\" he asked. \"I dare say we will run across Beatrice in the  hall.\"    At this moment Bee came flying out. There was a flower in her hair, and  another at her belt. She looked cool and sweet as only a girl can when  she is exquisitely neat in every detail.    \"I just heard you,\" she said brightly, giving Adele a kiss. \"I was  helping Aunt Fanny with the table when I heard your voices. How is Uncle  Henry?\"    \"Better, Bee. Is dinner ready? I am so hungry.\"    \"All ready,\" responded Bee. \"Come right in. Leave your hat in the hall,  and we will go to the table at once. Are you hungry, too, father?\"    \"I believe that I am,\" rejoined Doctor Raymond, whose face had cleared  wonderfully during this conversation. \"Have you repeated your success of  yesterday, Beatrice?\"    \"Adele is not a Lepidopterist, so I did not serve butterflies,\" laughed  Bee. \"I am giving her chocolate ice cream, which is her favorite. Do you  like it too?\"    \"Yes, indeed. I have not had any in years. Are you a housekeeper also,  Adele?\"    \"No;\" smiled Adele as they sat down to the table. \"Mamma and Bee  wouldn't let me muss round. To tell the truth, I don't care much about  such things. My tastes are not all domestic. Bee was always crazy on the  subject. At least when she could spare time from her butterflies.\"    \"Yet she does not strike me as being particularly on that order,\"  remarked the scientist musingly. \"How came you to take it up, Beatrice?\"    \"Why, you wrote Aunt Annie that you wished me to,\" answered Bee as  though that were sufficient reason.    \"I believe that Bee would learn Hottentot if she thought it would please  you, Uncle William,\" added Adele graciously. She was well pleased that  Bee had welcomed her so cordially. \"Now, papa is a lawyer, but I don't  know a thing about law. I couldn't tell an appeal from a--from a--What  do I want to say, Bee?\"    \"From a writ of habeas corpus,\" suggested Bee.    \"Have you studied law also, Beatrice?\" queried her father, glancing from  the beautiful face of his niece to the animated one of his daughter.    \"No, father. I have heard Uncle Henry talking about his cases, and  picked up a few terms. I don't care for law as I do for science.\"    \"What have you been doing to your hair, Bee?\" broke in Adele, suddenly.  \"I knew there was something odd about you, but I couldn't tell what it  was until this minute.\"    Bee's face flushed, but she answered good-naturedly:    \"I struck for gold, Adele, but it didn't pan out the pure article.\"    \"I didn't know that you cared about such things,\" observed Adele with an  involuntary touch to her own golden locks. \"You always seemed superior  to such things. It would not look so bad if you would keep it touched  up. It's being so dark at the roots and yellow the rest of the way is  what makes it look queer. Why don't you have it bleached again?\"    \"Because it's silly,\" answered Beatrice tersely. \"I was foolish to do it  in the first place, and now I shall wear it just as it is until it is  long enough to cut off all that horrid bleached part. It is a good  punishment for me.\"    \"Several of the girls do it, but it does seem strange for you to do such  a thing. Aren't you most finished? I am dying to get to that piano. I  want to play for Uncle William.\"    \"I am quite through,\" said Bee with a quick glance in her father's  direction, \"and so is father. We will go into the parlor now.\"    With stately, old-fashioned courtesy Doctor Raymond rose and opened the  door for them. Engrossed in his own meditations the scientist had not  paid much attention to the chatter of the girls. Had it been otherwise  he might have absorbed a few facts concerning the species girl that  would have enlightened his understanding considerably.    \"I am dreadfully out of practice,\" commented Adele, seating herself at  the instrument, and letting her hands flutter over the keys dreamily.  \"Since papa has been so ill I have not touched the piano. What do you  like, Uncle William?\"    \"Anything, child,\" replied Doctor Raymond, seating himself in a large  arm chair and preparing to be comfortable. \"I am fond of music of all  kinds. So let it be 'grave or gay, lively or severe,' it will please me.  Beatrice has not favored me with any music yet.\"    \"I don't play,\" said Beatrice quietly. \"You should hear Percival on the  violin, father. He is wonderful!\"    \"And who is Percival,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33504"],[0,"Opticks (#18)"],[1," the indico [Greek:  ilmk], and of the violet [Greek: l]GA[Greek: m]. And this Operation  being divers times repeated both in the same, and in several Papers, I  found that the Observations agreed well enough with one another, and  that the Rectilinear Sides MG and FA were by the said cross Lines  divided after the manner of a Musical Chord. Let GM be produced to X,  that MX may be equal to GM, and conceive GX, [Greek: l]X, [Greek: i]X,  [Greek: e]X, [Greek: e]X, [Greek: g]X, [Greek: a]X, MX, to be in  proportion to one another, as the Numbers, 1, 8/9, 5/6, 3/4, 2/3, 3/5,  9/16, 1/2, and so to represent the Chords of the Key, and of a Tone, a  third Minor, a fourth, a fifth, a sixth Major, a seventh and an eighth  above that Key: And the Intervals M[Greek: a], [Greek: ag], [Greek: ge],  [Greek: ee], [Greek: ei], [Greek: il], and [Greek: l]G, will be the  Spaces which the several Colours (red, orange, yellow, green, blue,  indigo, violet) take up.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.]    [Illustration: FIG. 5.]    Now these Intervals or Spaces subtending the Differences of the  Refractions of the Rays going to the Limits of those Colours, that is,  to the Points M, [Greek: a], [Greek: g], [Greek: e], [Greek: e], [Greek:  i], [Greek: l], G, may without any sensible Error be accounted  proportional to the Differences of the Sines of Refraction of those Rays  having one common Sine of Incidence, and therefore since the common Sine  of Incidence of the most and least refrangible Rays out of Glass into  Air was (by a Method described above) found in proportion to their Sines  of Refraction, as 50 to 77 and 78, divide the Difference between the  Sines of Refraction 77 and 78, as the Line GM is divided by those  Intervals, and you will have 77, 77-1/8, 77-1/5, 77-1/3, 77-1/2, 77-2/3,  77-7/9, 78, the Sines of Refraction of those Rays out of Glass into Air,  their common Sine of Incidence being 50. So then the Sines of the  Incidences of all the red-making Rays out of Glass into Air, were to the  Sines of their Refractions, not greater than 50 to 77, nor less than 50  to 77-1/8, but they varied from one another according to all  intermediate Proportions. And the Sines of the Incidences of the  green-making Rays were to the Sines of their Refractions in all  Proportions from that of 50 to 77-1/3, unto that of 50 to 77-1/2. And  by the like Limits above-mentioned were the Refractions of the Rays  belonging to the rest of the Colours defined, the Sines of the  red-making Rays extending from 77 to 77-1/8, those of the orange-making  from 77-1/8 to 77-1/5, those of the yellow-making from 77-1/5 to 77-1/3,  those of the green-making from 77-1/3 to 77-1/2, those of the  blue-making from 77-1/2 to 77-2/3, those of the indigo-making from  77-2/3 to 77-7/9, and those of the violet from 77-7/9, to 78.    These are the Laws of the Refractions made out of Glass into Air, and  thence by the third Axiom of the first Part of this Book, the Laws of  the Refractions made out of Air into Glass are easily derived.    _Exper._ 8. I found moreover, that when Light goes out of Air through  several contiguous refracting Mediums as through Water and Glass, and  thence goes out again into Air, whether the refracting Superficies be  parallel or inclin'd to one another, that Light as often as by contrary  Refractions 'tis so corrected, that it emergeth in Lines parallel to  those in which it was incident, continues ever after to be white. But if  the emergent Rays be inclined to the incident, the Whiteness of the  emerging Light will by degrees in passing on from the Place of  Emergence, become tinged in its Edges with Colours. This I try'd by  refracting Light with Prisms of Glass placed within a Prismatick Vessel  of Water. Now those Colours argue a diverging and separation of the  heterogeneous Rays from one another by means of their unequal  Refractions, as in what follows will more fully appear. And, on the  contrary, the permanent whiteness argues, that in like Incidences of the  Rays there is no such separation of the emerging Rays, and by  consequence no inequality of their whole Refractions. Whence I seem to  gather the two following Theorems.    1. The Excesses of the Sines of Refraction of several sorts of Rays  above their common Sine of Incidence when the Refractions are made out  of divers denser Mediums immediately into one and the same rarer Medium,  suppose of Air, are to one another in a given Proportion.    2. The Proportion of the Sine of Incidence to the Sine of Refraction of  one and the same sort of Rays out of one Medium into another, is  composed of the Proportion of the Sine of Incidence to the Sine of  Refraction out of the first Medium into any third Medium, and of the  Proportion of the Sine of Incidence to the Sine of Refraction out of  that third Medium into the second Medium.    By the first Theorem the Refractions of the Rays of every sort made out  of any Medium into Air are known by having the Refraction of the Rays of  any one sort. As for instance, if the Refractions of the Rays of every  sort out of Rain-water into Air be desired, let the common Sine of  Incidence out of Glass into Air be subducted from the Sines of  Refraction, and the Excesses will be 27, 27-1/8, 27-1/5, 27-1/3, 27-1/2,  27-2/3, 27-7/9, 28. Suppose now that the Sine of Incidence of the least  refrangible Rays be to their Sine of Refraction out of Rain-water into  Air as 3 to 4, and say as 1 the difference of those Sines is to 3 the  Sine of Incidence, so is 27 the least of the Excesses above-mentioned to  a fourth Number 81; and 81 will be the common Sine of Incidence out of  Rain-water into Air, to which Sine if you add all the above-mentioned  Excesses, you will have the desired Sines of the Refractions 108,  108-1/8, 108-1/5, 108-1/3, 108-1/2, 108-2/3, 108-7/9, 109.    By the latter Theorem the Refraction out of one Medium into another is  gathered as often as you have the Refractions out of them both into any  third Medium. As if the Sine of Incidence of any Ray out of Glass into  Air be to its Sine of Refraction, as 20 to 31, and the Sine of Incidence  of the same Ray out of Air into Water, be to its Sine of Refraction as 4  to 3; the Sine of Incidence of that Ray out of Glass into Water will be  to its Sine of Refraction as 20 to 31 and 4 to 3 jointly, that is, as  the Factum of 20 and 4 to the Factum of 31 and 3, or as 80 to 93.    And these Theorems being admitted into Opticks, there would be scope  enough of handling that Science voluminously after a new manner,[K] not  only by teaching those things which tend to the perfection of Vision,  but also by determining mathematically all kinds of Phaenomena of Colours  which could be produced by Refractions. For to do this, there is nothing  else requisite than to find out the Separations of heterogeneous Rays,  and their various Mixtures and Proportions in every Mixture. By this  way of arguing I invented almost all the Phaenomena described in these  Books, beside some others less necessary to the Argument; and by the  successes I met with in the Trials, I dare promise, that to him who  shall argue truly, and then try all things with good Glasses and  sufficient Circumspection, the expected Event will not be wanting. But  he is first to know what Colours will arise from any others mix'd in any  assigned Proportion.      _PROP._ IV. THEOR. III.    _Colours may be produced by Composition which shall be like to the  Colours of homogeneal Light as to the Appearance of Colour, but not as  to the Immutability of Colour and Constitution of Light. And those  Colours by how much they are more compounded by so much are they less  full and intense, and by too much Composition they maybe diluted and  weaken'd till they cease, and the Mixture becomes white or grey. There  may be also Colours produced by Composition, which are not fully like  any of the Colours of homogeneal Light._    For a Mixture of homogeneal red and yellow compounds an Orange, like in  appearance of Colour to that orange which in the series of unmixed  prismatick Colours lies between them; but the Light of one orange is  homogeneal as to Refrangibility, and that of the other is heterogeneal,  and the Colour of the one, if viewed through a Prism, remains unchanged,  that of the other is changed and resolved into its component Colours red  and yellow. And after the same manner other neighbouring homogeneal  Colours may compound new Colours, like the intermediate homogeneal ones,  as yellow and green, the Colour between them both, and afterwards, if  blue be added, there will be made a green the middle Colour of the three  which enter the Composition. For the yellow and blue on either hand, if  they are equal in quantity they draw the intermediate green equally  towards themselves in Composition, and so keep it as it were in  AEquilibrion, that it verge not more to the yellow on the one hand, and  to the blue on the other, but by their mix'd Actions remain still a  middle Colour. To this mix'd green there may be farther added some red  and violet, and yet the green will not presently cease, but only grow  less full and vivid, and by increasing the red and violet, it will grow  more and more dilute, until by the prevalence of the added Colours it be  overcome and turned into whiteness, or some other Colour. So if to the  Colour of any homogeneal Light, the Sun's white Light composed of all  sorts of Rays be added, that Colour will not vanish or change its  Species, but be diluted, and by adding more and more white it will be  diluted more and more perpetually. Lastly, If red and violet be mingled,  there will be generated according to their various Proportions various  Purples, such as are not like in appearance to the Colour of any  homogeneal Light, and of these Purples mix'd with yellow and blue may be  made other new Colours.      _PROP._ V.
