The way they take cover is       simply wonderful. All the prisoners were marched off at once       and sent by rail to Pretoria. It was a terribly hot day, and no       shade or water except what the Boers gave us. They were very       good about water, giving us all they had, and fetching more       from the bottom of the hill, one and a half mile away.\"    An officer of the Royal Irish Fusiliers, writing from Staatsmodel  Schule, Pretoria, said:--         \"We were all taken prisoners, together with the Gloucester       Regiment and a Battery of Mounted Artillery, which accounts for       us being in Pretoria so soon. As we were going up the hill in       the dark, a small party of Boers dashed through our ammunition       mules, causing them to stampede. By this move we lost all our       mules, 200 in all, and with them all our ammunition and       artillery.... You don't know what it means shooting a Boer; he       is behind a rock, and all you can ever see is his rifle       sticking out. For the last hour of the fight I had a rifle and       ammunition which I took from a dead man, and blazed away for       all I was worth. Then we fixed bayonets and prepared for a       rush, when the 'Cease fire' sounded. Our senior Captain has       told me that my name has been mentioned to our Colonel, who was       commanding the force, as having caused a lot of men to rally.       We were all then taken prisoners, except two officers killed       and eight wounded, and marched to the Boer laager, and sent off       that night to a station twenty miles distant in waggons. While       we were in their laager they treated us extremely well, and       gave us food and tobacco. All you read about the Boers in       England is absolutely untrue. They are most kind to the wounded       and prisoners, looking after them as well as their own wounded,       and anything they've got they will give you if you ask them,       even if they deprive themselves. We came up to Pretoria in       first-class sleeping-carriages, and the way they treated us was       most considerate, feeding us and giving us coffee every time we       stopped. The day we arrived we took up quarters on the       racecourse, but we have been moved into a fine brick building       with baths, electric light, &c. They provide us with       everything, from clothes down to tooth-brushes. They also feed       us, and we are constantly getting presents of vegetables and       cigars from private people. In fact, we can have everything we       like except our liberty; for some reason or other they won't at       present give us parole, and we are surrounded by sentries.       There are close upon fifty officers in this building, and they       have got any amount of wounded ones in different places. They       say they won't exchange the officers at any price.\"    As this letter had evidently to pass through the hands of the prison  censor, we may take the eulogies of the Boers for what they were worth!  However, it is but just to own that there are Boers and Boers. For  instance, it is a fact that Captain Gerard Rice, who was wounded in the  ankle and unable to move, offered a Boer half-a-sovereign to carry him  off the field. The man refused the money, but performed the action with  great kindness.    Father L. Matthews, chaplain of the Royal Irish Fusiliers, who was  captured at Nicholson's Nek on October 31 and subsequently released,  gave the following version of the disaster:--         \"We were sent out to occupy the position with the object of       preventing the two Boer forces from joining. We started at 8.30       on Sunday night, marched ten miles, and got to the hill at 1       A.M. The first mishap was that the mountain battery stampeded       and scattered the whole lot of mules. We formed up again and       gained the top of the hill. The guns were gone, but not all the       ammunition. I do not know what stampeded the mules. They       knocked me down. It was pitch dark.         \"We had one hour's sleep. Firing began just after daylight. It       was slack for some time, but the Boers crept round. Then the       firing became furious. Our men made a breastwork of stones.         \"After 12 o'clock there was a general cry of 'Cease fire' in       that direction. Our fellows would not stop firing. Major Adye       came up and confirmed the order to cease fire. Then the bugle       sounded 'Cease fire.' In our sangar there was a rumour that the       white flag was raised by a young officer who thought his batch       of ten men were the sole survivors.         \"We were 900 alive, having started perhaps 1000. I think that       many of the battery men escaped. Our men and officers were       furious at surrendering. The Boers did not seem to be in great       numbers on the spot, but I heard that the main body had       galloped off.         \"The men had to give up their arms. The officers were sent to       Commandant Steenekamp. The officers then ordered the men to       fall in. The officers were taken away from the men and sent to       General Joubert. On the same day the officers went in       mule-waggons and slept at some store _en route_, and next day       took the train at Waschbank for Pretoria. The officers are very       well treated, and so, I have heard, are the men. There has been       no unpleasantness in Pretoria. The officers are in the Model       School, and are allowed to walk as they please in the grounds.         \"I think that the surrender was a great blunder, and was caused       by a misunderstanding. Major Adye was much put out. The white       flag was not hoisted by the Irish Fusiliers.\"    Father Matthews puts the case mildly. Some of the officers of the Irish  Fusiliers were so exasperated at the exhibition of the white flag, that  they set to work and smashed their swords rather than give them up.    The final figures of the losses sustained at Nicholson's Nek were as  follows: The total of missing of the Gloucesters and Royal Irish  Fusiliers was 843. Thirty-two of the Gloucesters, 10 of the Fusiliers,  and 10 of the Mountain Battery were found dead on the field, while 150  wounded were brought into camp at Ladysmith. Between 70 and 100 of the  men escaped and got back to camp.                               THE SIEGE OF LADYSMITH    It was now found necessary to issue a proclamation giving all strangers  the option of leaving the town at twenty-four hours' notice. In spite of  this notice, however, many civilians remained. Meanwhile, shells  continued to drop uproariously, if harmlessly, into the town, while the  balloon corps worked steadily in their task of locating the hostile  guns. The enemy objected to that original form of spy, and aimed at him  many a shot, but, fortunately, without effect. The Naval Brigade, always  animated, active, and efficient, completed the mounting of the  long-range guns which were to add to the safety of the place and the  discomfiture of its besiegers. On the whole, the position was becoming  somewhat serious, particularly for those whose nerves were unaccustomed  to the uproar of diurnal thunderstorms. Lord Wolseley has somewhere said  that \"the effect of artillery fire is more moral than actual; it kills  but very few, but its appalling noise, the way it tears down trees,  knocks houses into small pieces, and mutilates the human frame when it  does hit, strikes terror into all but the stoutest hearts.\" It may be  imagined that the early days of this experience must have been somewhat  embarrassing, though later on, so attuned became the nerves, even of  women, that they engaged in shopping in the midst of bombardment, quite  unmoved.    On 2nd November at 2.30 P.M. the telegraphic communication with  Ladysmith was interrupted, but it was undecided whether the Boers had  got sufficiently far south to promote the interruption or whether the  wires had been cut by Dutch sympathisers or small scouting parties of  the enemy. The Boers applied for an armistice with a view to burying  their dead, their real object most probably being, as in many previous  cases of a similar nature, to obtain time for refitting their heavy  guns. This request was refused, but they were permitted to bury their  slain under a flag of truce. Meanwhile, General Joubert's force received  large reinforcements of Free State burghers under the command of Lucas  Meyer, and additional commandoes from the Middleburgh and Leydenburg  districts under Schalkburger were expected.    After this the siege of Ladysmith began in real earnest. \"Long Tom,\"  though temporarily incapacitated, soon resumed his volubility, and was  assisted by another of his calibre nicknamed \"Slim Piet.\" Curiously  enough, the first house hit during the siege was a commodious  bungalow-shaped residence with large verandah belonging to Mr. Carter,  the author of the now well-known \"Narrative of the Boer War.\" The owner  fortunately had left before the bombardment, and the premises were then  occupied by nurses.

Frederick Egerton, of the _Powerful_, who was wounded by a shell  in the left knee and right foot, was promoted to the rank of Commander  in Her Majesty's fleet for special services with the forces in South  Africa. But his promotion came too late. He expired after some hours of  suffering.[4]    The Boers by now had established batteries on Grobler's Kloof,  a commanding eminence from whence they could attack both Ladysmith on  the north and Colenso on the south. Women and children vacated the  place, and the trains coming in and out had to run the gantlet of the  Boer fire, both Nordenfeldt quick-firing guns and Mauser rifles being  brought to bear on the refugees.

Add one cupful of powdered sugar and cook until it will spin a thread.    Pour this upon the stiffly beaten whites of two eggs, and when well  blended add gradually a pint of boiling cream, a few drops of essence of  peppermint and a tiny pinch of baking soda.

Editress Suffrage Cook Book:              I have at hand your letter of the 16th inst.,            asking an expression from me regarding Woman            Suffrage in the State of Washington.              Replying, I desire to say that the women of the            State of Washington have had the right to vote for            something more than three years. I know of no one            who was in favor of giving them this right who            to-day opposes it, and large numbers of those who            were opposed now favor women having the ballot.            The results in the State of Washington certainly            indicate that women assist in public affairs,            rather than otherwise, by having the right to            vote.              Agreeable to your request, I am sending a            photograph of myself under separate cover; also            card carrying my autograph.                                           Yours very truly,                                               ERNEST LISTER,                                                   Governor.
