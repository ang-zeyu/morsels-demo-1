In everything but colours it is Eutamias  or Tamias of a more intensified type. Its tail is long in proportion and  carried differently, being commonly held straight up, so that the  general impression one gets is of a huge tail with a tiny striped animal  attached to its lower end.    [Illustration]    Its excessive numbers along the roads in the Park are due to two things:  First, the food, for oats are continually spilled from the freighting  wagons. Second, the protection of piles of pine trees cut and cast aside  in clearing the roadway.    There is one habit of the Eastern Chipmunk that I have not noted in the  mountain species, and that is the habit of song. In the early spring and  late autumn when the days are bright and invigorating, the Eastern  Chipmunk will mount some log, stump or other perch and express his  exuberant joy in a song which is a rapid repetition of a bird-like note  suggested by \"Chuck,\" \"Chuck,\" or \"Chock,\" \"Chock.\" This is kept up two  or three minutes without interruption, and is one of those delightful  woodland songs whose charm comes rather from association than from its  inherent music.    If our Western Chipmunk is as far ahead in matters musical as he is in  form and other habits, I shall expect him to render no less than the  song of a nightingale when he gives himself up to express his wild  exuberance in a chant.    I shall never forget the days I spent with a naturalist friend in an old  mill building in western Manitoba. It was in a pine woods which was  peopled with these little Chipmunks. They had hailed the mill and its  wood piles, and especially the stables, with their squandered oats, as  the very gifts of a beneficient Providence for their use and benefit.  They had concentrated on the mill; they were there in hundreds, almost  thousands, and whenever one looked across the yard in sunny hours one  could see a dozen or more together.    The old mill was infested with them as an old brewery with rats. But in  many respects besides beauty they were an improvement on rats: they did  not smell, they were not vicious, and they did not move by night.    [Illustration]    During the daytime they were everywhere and into everything. Our slender  stock of provisions was badly reduced when, by mischance, the tin box  was left open a few hours, but we loved to see so much beautiful life  about and so forgave them. One of our regular pleasures was to sit back  after a meal and watch these pert-eyed, four-legged birds scramble onto  the table, eat the scraps and lick all the plates and platters clean.    Like all the Chipmunks and Ground-squirrels, this animal has  well-developed cheek-pouches which it uses for carrying home seeds and  roots which serve for food in the winter. Or perhaps we should say in  the early spring, for the Chipmunk, like the Ground-squirrel, goes into  the ground for a long repose as soon as winter comes down hard and  white.    Yet it does not go so early or stay so late as its big cousin. October  still sees it active, even running about in the snow. As late as October  31st at Breckenridge, Col., I saw one sitting up on a log and eating  some grass or seeds during a driving snowstorm. High up in the  Shoshonees, after winter had settled down, on October 8, 1898, I saw one  of these bright creatures bounding through the snow. On a stone he  paused to watch me and I made a hasty sketch of his attitude.    [Illustration]    Then, again, it is out in the spring, early in April, so that it is  above ground for at least seven months of the year. Its nest is in a  chamber at the end of a long tunnel that it digs under ground, usually  among roots that make hard digging for the creatures that would rout  them out. Very little is known as yet, however, about the growth or  development of the young, so here is an opportunity for the young  naturalist who would contribute something to our knowledge of this  interesting creature.      A STRIPED PIGMY--THE LEAST CHIPMUNK    Closely akin to this one and commonly mistaken for its young, is the  Least Chipmunk (_Eutamias minimus_), which is widely diffused in the  great dry central region of the Continent. Although so generally found  and so visible when found, its history is practically unknown. It  probably lives much like its relatives, raising a brood of four to six  young in a warm chamber far underground, and brings them up to eat all  manner of seeds, grains, fruits, herbs, berries, insects, birds, eggs,  and even mice, just as do most of its kinsmen, but no one has proved any  of these things. Any exact observations you may make are sure to be  acceptable contributions to science.                 *       *       *       *       *    IX    The Rabbits and their Habits           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: XXVII.

To perfect this power he has consecrated all the  splendid energies of his vigorous frame, and he has magnified his  specialty into a success that is worth more to his race than could be  any other single gift.    [Illustration]    Rabbits are without weapons of defense, and are simple-minded to the  last degree. Most are incapable of long-distance speed, but all have an  exuberance of multiplication that fills their ranks as fast as foe can  thin the line. If, indeed, they did not have several families, several  times a year, they would have died out several epochs back.    [Illustration]    There are three marked types of Rabbits in the Rockies--the Cottontail,  the Snowshoe, and the Jackrabbit. All of them are represented on the  Yellowstone, besides the little Coney of the rocks which is a remote  second cousin of the family.      MOLLY COTTONTAIL, THE CLEVER FREEZER    [Illustration: Molly Freezing]    I have often had occasion to comment on the \"freezing\" of animals. When  they are suddenly aware of a near enemy or confronted by unexpected  situations, their habit is to _freeze_--that is, become perfectly rigid,  and remain so until the danger is past or at least comprehended.    Molly Cottontail is one of the best \"freezers.\" Whenever she does not  know what to do, she does nothing, obeying the old Western rule, \"Never  rush when you are rattled.\" Now Molly is a very nervous creature. Any  loud, sharp noise is liable to upset her, and feeling herself unnerved  she is very apt to stop and simply \"freeze.\" Keep this in mind when next  you meet a Cottontail, and get a photograph.    In July, 1902, I tried it myself. I was camped with a lot of Sioux  Indians on the banks of the Cheyenne River in Dakota. They had their  families with them, and about sundown one of the boys ran into the tepee  for a gun, and then fired into the grass. His little brother gave a  war-whoop that their \"pa\" might well have been proud of, then rushed  forward and held up a fat Cottontail, kicking her last kick. Another, a  smaller Cottontail, was found not far away, and half a dozen young  redskins armed with sticks crawled up, then suddenly let them fly. Bunny  was hit, knocked over, and before he could recover, a dog had him.    [Illustration]    I had been some distance away. On hearing the uproar I came back toward  my own campfire, and as I did so, my Indian guide pointed to a  Cottontail twenty feet away gazing toward the boys. The guide picked up  a stick of firewood.    The boys saw him, and knowing that another Rabbit was there they came  running. Now I thought they had enough game for supper and did not wish  them to kill poor Molly. But I knew I could not stop them by saying  that, so I said: \"Hold on till I make a photo.\" Some of them understood;  at any rate, my guide did, and all held back as I crawled toward the  Rabbit. She took alarm and was bounding away when I gave a shrill  whistle which turned her into a \"frozen\" statue. Then I came near and  snapped the camera. The Indian boys now closed in and were going to  throw, but I cried out: \"Hold on! not yet; I want another.\" So I chased  Bunny twenty or thirty yards, then gave another shrill whistle, and got  a fourth snap. Again I had to hold the boys back by \"wanting another  picture.\" Five times I did this, taking five pictures, and all the while  steering Molly toward a great pile of drift logs by the river. I had now  used up all my films.    The boys were getting impatient. So I addressed the Cottontail solemnly  and gently: \"Bunny, I have done my best for you. I cannot hold these  little savages any longer. You see that pile of logs over there? Well,  Bunny, you have just five seconds to get into that wood-pile. Now git!\"  and I shooed and clapped my hands, and all the young Indians yelled and  hurled their clubs, the dogs came bounding and Molly fairly dusted the  earth.    \"Go it, Molly!\"    \"Go it, dogs!\"    \"Ki-yi, Injuns!\"    The clubs flew and rattled around her, but Molly put in ten feet to the  hop and ten hops to the second (almost), and before the chase was well  begun it was over; her cotton tuft disappeared under a log; she was safe  in the pile of wood, where so far as I know she lived happy ever after.    [Illustration]      THE RABBIT THAT WEARS SNOWSHOES    The Snowshoe Rabbit is found in all parts of the Park, though not in  very great numbers. It is called \"Snowshoe\" on account of the size of  its feet, which, already large, are in snow time made larger by fringes  of stiff bristles that give the creature such a broad area of support  that it can skip on the surface of soft snow while all its kinsmen sink  in helplessness.

The external appeals to woman who comprehends easily and  quickly, and, therefore, does not penetrate beneath the surface. Man, on  the other hand, strives to pierce to the essence of things, apprehends  more slowly, but thinks more profoundly, and tests carefully before he  accepts. Hence we so rarely meet woman in the field of science, while  her work in the domain of poetry and the humanities is abundant and  attractive. Jewish women form no exception to the rule: a survey of  Jewish poetry will show woman's share in its productions to have been  considerable and of high quality. While there was little or no  possibility to prosecute historic or scientific inquiry during the  harrowing days of persecution, the well-spring of Jewish poetry never  ran dry. Poetry followed the race into exile, and clave to it through  all vicissitudes, its solacement in suffering, the holy mediatrix  between its past and future. \"The Orient dwells an exile in the  Occident, and its tears of longing for home are the fountain-head of  Jewish poetry,\" says a Christian scholar. And at the altar of this  poetry, whose sweetness and purity sanctified home life, and spread a  sense of morality in a time when brutality and corruptness were general,  the women singers of Israel offered the gifts of their muse. While the  culture of that time culminated in the service of love (_Minnedienst_),  in woman worship, so offensive to modern taste, Jewish poetry was  pervaded by a pure, ideal conception of love and womanhood, testifying  to the high ethical principles of its devotees.    Judaism and Jewish poetry know naught of the sensual love so assiduously  fostered by the cult of the Virgin. \"Love,\" says a celebrated historian  of literature, \"was glorified in all shapes and guises, and represented  as the highest aim of life. Woman's virtues, yea, even her vices, were  invested with exaggerated importance. Woman became accustomed to think  that she could be neither faithful nor faithless without turning the  world topsy-turvy. She shared the fate of all objects of excessive  adulation: flattery corrupted her. Thus it came about that love of woman  overshadowed every other social force and every form of family  affection, and so spent its power. The Jews were the only ones sane  enough to subordinate sexual love to reverence for motherhood. Alexander  Weill makes a Jewish mother say: 'Is it proper for a good Jewish mother  to concern herself about love? Love is revolting idolatry. A Jewess may  love only God, her husband, and her children.' Granny (_Alt-Babele_) in  one of Kompert's tales says: 'God could not be everywhere, so he created  mothers.' In Jewish novels, maternal love is made the basis of family  life, its passion and its mystery. A Jewish mother! What an image the  words conjure up! Her face is calm, though pale; a melancholy smile  rests upon her lips, and her soulful eyes seem to hide in their depths  the vision of a remote future.\"    This is a correct view. Jewish poetry is interpenetrated with the breath  of intellectual love, that is, love growing out of the recognition of  duty, no less ideal than sensual love. In the heart of the Jew love is  an infinite force. Too mighty to be confined to the narrow limits of  personal passion, it extends so as to include future generations.    Thus it happened that while in Christian poetry woman was the subject of  song and sonnet, in Jewish poetry she herself sang and composed, and her  productions are worthy of ranking beside the best poetic creations of  each generation.    The earliest blossoms of Jewish poetry by women unfolded in the  spring-like atmosphere of the Renaissance under the blue sky of Italy,  the home of the immortal trio, Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio. The  first Jewish women writers of Italian verse were Deborah Ascarelli and  Sara Copia Sullam, who, arrayed in the full panoply of the culture of  their day, and as thoroughly equipped with Jewish knowledge, devoted  their talents and their zeal to the service of their nation.    Deborah Ascarelli of Rome, the pride of her sex, was the wife of the  respected rabbi Giuseppe Ascarelli, and lived at Venice in the beginning  of the seventeenth century. She made a graceful Italian translation of  Moses Rieti's _Sefer ha-Hechal_, a Hebrew poem written in imitation of  the _Divina Commedia_, and enjoying much favor at Rome. As early as  1609, David della Rocca published a second edition of her translation,  dedicating it to the charming authoress. To put the highly wrought,  artificial poetry of the Hebrew Dante into mellifluous Italian verse was  by no means easy. While Rieti's poetry is not distinguished by the vigor  and fulness of the older classical productions of neo-Hebraic poetry,  his rhythm is smooth, pleasant, and polished. Yet her rendition is  admirable. Besides, she won fame as a writer of hymns in praise of the  God of her people, who so wondrously rescued it from all manner of  distress.        \"Let other poets of victory's trophies tell,      Thy song will e'er thy people's praises swell,\"    says a Jewish Italian poet enchanted by her talent.    A still more gifted poetess was Sara Copia Sullam, a particular star in  Judah's galaxy.[32] The only child of a wealthy Venetian at the end of  the sixteenth century, she was indulged in her love of study, and  afforded every opportunity to advance in the arts and sciences. \"She  revelled in the realm of beauty, and crystallized her enthusiasm in  graceful, sweet, maidenly verses. Young, lovely, of generous impulses  and keen intellectual powers, her ambition set upon lofty attainments, a  favorite of the muses, Sara Copia charmed youth and age.\"    These graces of mind became her misfortune. An old Italian priest,  Ansaldo Ceba, in Genoa, published an Italian epic with the Esther of the  Bible as the heroine. Sara was delighted with the choice of the subject.  It was natural that a high-minded, sensitive girl with lofty ideals,  stung to the quick by the injustice and contumely suffered by her  people, should rejoice extravagantly in the praise lavished upon a  heroine of her nation. Carried away by enthusiasm she wrote the poet, a  stranger to her, a letter overflowing with gratitude for the pure  delight his poem had yielded her. Her passionate warmth, betraying at  once the accomplished poetess and the gifted thinker, did not fail to  fascinate the old priest, who immediately resolved to capture this  beautiful soul for the church. His desire brought about a lively  correspondence, our chief source of information about Sara Copia. Her  conversion became a passion with the highstrung priest, taking complete  possession of him during the last years of his life. He brought to bear  upon her case every trick of dialectics and flattery at his command. All  in vain. The greatest successes of which he could boast were her promise  to read the New Testament, and her consent to his praying for her  conversion. Sara's arguments in favor of Judaism arouse the reader's  admiration for the sharpness of intellect displayed, her poetic genius,  and her intimate acquaintance with Jewish sources as well as philosophic  systems.    Ansaldo never abandoned the hope of gaining her over to Christianity.  Unable to convince her reason, he attacked her heart. Though evincing  singular love and veneration for her old admirer, Sara could not be  moved from steadfast adherence to her faith. She sent him her picture  with the words: \"This is the picture of one who carries yours deeply  graven on her heart, and, with finger pointing to her bosom, tells the  world: 'Here dwells my idol, bow before him.'\"    With old age creeping upon him with its palsy touch, he continued to  think of nothing but Sara's conversion, and assailed her in prose and  verse. One of his imploring letters closes thus:        \"Life's fair, bright morn bathes thee in light,        Thy cheeks are softly flushed with youthful zest.      For me the night sets in; my limbs        Are cold, but ardent love glows in my breast.\"    Sara having compared his poems with those of Amphion and Orpheus, he  answered her:        \"To Amphion the stones lent ear        When soft he touched his lute;      And beasts came trooping nigh to hear        When Orpheus played his flute.        How long, O Sara, wilt thou liken me        To those great singers of the olden days?      My God and faith I sought to give to thee,        In vain I proved the error of thy ways.      Their song had charms more potent than my own,      Or art thou harder than a beast or stone?\"    The query long remained unanswered, for just then the poetess was  harassed by many trials. Serious illness prostrated her, then her  beloved father died, and finally she was unjustly charged by the envious  among her co-religionists with neglect of Jewish observances, and denial  of the divine origin of the Law. She found no difficulty in refuting the  malicious accusation, but she was stung to the quick by the calumnious  attack, the pain it inflicted vanishing only in the presence of a grave  danger. Balthasar Bonifacio, an obscure author, in a brochure published  for that purpose, accused her of rejecting the doctrine of the  immortality of the soul, a most serious charge, which, if sustained,  would have thrown her into the clutches of the Inquisition. In two days  she wrote a brilliant defense completely exonerating herself and  exposing the spitefulness of the attack, a masterful production by  reason of its vigorous dialectics, incisive satire, and noble enthusiasm  for the cause of religion. Together with some few of her sonnets, this  is all that has come down to us of her writings. She opened her  vindication with the following sonnet:        \"O Lord, Thou know'st my inmost hope and thought,        Thou know'st whene'er before Thy judgment throne        I shed salt tears,"]]]
