It is  even probable that, as a rule, the development is even slower and that  the Oil-beetles, like the Sitares, for the most part spend the cold  season in the pseudochrysalid state, a state well-adapted to the  winter torpor, and do not achieve their numerous forms until the  return of the warm weather.    The Sitares and Meloes belong to the same family, that of the  Meloidae.[2] Their strange transformations must probably extend  throughout the group; indeed, I had the good fortune to discover a  third example, which I have not hitherto been able to study in all its  details after twenty-five years of investigation. On six occasions, no  oftener, during this long period I have set eyes on the  pseudochrysalis which I am about to describe. Thrice I obtained it  from old Chalicodoma-nests built upon a stone, nests which I at first  attributed to the Chalicodoma of the Walls and which I now refer with  greater probability to the Chalicodoma of the Sheds. I once extracted  it from the galleries bored by some wood-eating larva in the trunk of  a dead wild pear-tree, galleries afterwards utilized for the cells of  an Osmia, I do not know which. Lastly, I found a pair of them in  between the row of cocoons of the Three-pronged Osmia (_O.  tridentata_, DUF.), who provides a home for her larvae in a channel  dug in the dry bramble stems. The insect in question therefore is a  parasite of the Osmiae. When I extract it from the old  Chalicodoma-nests, I have to attribute it not to this Bee but to one  of the Osmiae (_O. tricornis_ and _O. Latreillii_) who, when making  their nests, utilize the old galleries of the Mason-bee.    [Footnote 2: Later classifiers place both in the family of the  Cantharidae.--_Translator's Note_.]    The most nearly complete instances that I have seen furnishes me with  the following data: the pseudochrysalis is very closely enveloped in  the skin of the secondary larva, a skin consisting of fine transparent  pellicle, without any rent whatever. This is the pouch of the Sitaris,  save that it lies in immediate contact with the body enclosed. On this  jacket we distinguish three pairs of tiny legs, reduced to short  vestiges, to stumps. The head is in place, showing quite perceptibly  the fine mandibles and the other parts of the mouth. There is no trace  of eyes. Each side has a white edging of shrivelled tracheae, running  from one stigmatic orifice to another.    Next comes the pseudochrysalis, horny, currant-red, cylindrical,  cone-shaped at both ends, slightly convex on the dorsal surface and  concave on the ventral surface. It is covered with delicate, prominent  spots, sprinkled very close together; it takes a lens to show them. It  is 1 centimetre long and 4 millimetres wide.[3] We can distinguish a  large knob of a head, on which the mouth is vaguely outlined; three  pairs of little shiny brown specks, which are the hardly perceptible  vestiges of the legs; and on each side a row of eight black specks,  which are the stigmatic orifices. The first speck stands by itself, in  front; the seven others, divided from the first by an empty space,  form a continuous row. Lastly, at the opposite end is a little pit,  the sign of the anal pore.    [Footnote 3: .393 x .156 inch.--_Translator's Note_.]    Of the six pseudochrysalids which a lucky accident placed at my  disposal, four were dead; the other two were furnished by _Zonitis  mutica_. This justified my forecast, which from the first, with  analogy for my guide, made me attribute these curious organizations to  the genus Zonitis. The meloidal parasite of the Osmiae, therefore, is  recognized. We have still to make the acquaintance of the primary  larva, which gets itself carried by the Osmia into the cell full of  honey, and the tertiary larva, the one which, at a given moment, must  be found contained in the pseudochrysalis, a larva which will be  succeeded by the nymph.    Let us recapitulate the strange metamorphoses which I have sketched.  Every Beetle-larva, before attaining the nymphal stage, undergoes a  greater or smaller number of moults, of changes of skin; but these  moults, which are intended to favour the development of the larva by  ridding it of covering that has become too tight for it, in no way  alter its external shape. After any moult that it may have undergone,  the larva retains the same characteristics. If it begin by being  tough, it will not become tender; if it be equipped with legs, it will  not be deprived of them later; if it be provided with ocelli, it will  not become blind. It is true that the diet of these non-variable  larvae remains the same throughout their duration, as do the  conditions under which they are destined to live.    But suppose that this diet varies, that the environment in which they  are called upon to live changes, that the circumstances accompanying  their development are liable to great changes: it then becomes evident  that the moult may and even must adapt the organization of the larva  to these new conditions of existence. The primary larva of the Sitaris  lives on the body of the Anthophora. Its perilous peregrinations  demand agility of movement, long-sighted eyes and masterly  balancing-appliances; it has, in fact, a slender shape, ocelli, legs  and special organs adapted to averting a fall. Once inside the Bee's  cell, it has to destroy the egg; its sharp mandibles, curved into  hooks, will fulfil this office. This done, there is a change of diet:  after the Anthophora's egg the larva proceeds to consume the ration of  honey. The environment in which it has to live also changes: instead  of balancing itself on a hair of the Anthophora, it has now to float  on a sticky fluid; instead of living in broad daylight, it has to  remain plunged in the profoundest darkness. Its sharp mandibles must  therefore become hollowed into a spoon that they may scoop up the  honey; its legs, its cirri, its balancing-appliances must disappear as  useless and even harmful, since all these organs can only involve the  larva in serious danger, by causing it to stick in the honey; its  slender shape, its horny integuments, its ocelli, being no longer  necessary in a dark cell where movement is impossible, where there are  no rough encounters to be feared, may likewise give place to complete  blindness, to soft integuments, to a heavy, slothful form. This  transfiguration, which everything shows to be indispensable to the  life of the larva, is effected by a simple moult.    We do not so plainly perceive the necessity of the subsequent forms,  which are so abnormal that nothing like them is known in all the rest  of the insect class. The larva which is fed on honey first adopts a  false chrysalid appearance and afterwards goes back to its earlier  form, though the necessity for these transformations escapes us  entirely. Here I am obliged to record the facts and to leave the task  of interpreting them to the future. The larva of the Meloidae,  therefore, undergo four moults before attaining the nymphal state; and  after each moult their characteristics alter most profoundly. During  all these external changes, the internal organization remains  unchangingly the same; and it is only at the moment of the nymph's  appearance that the nervous system becomes concentrated and that the  reproductive organs are developed, absolutely as in the other Beetles.    Thus, to the ordinary metamorphoses which make a Beetle pass  successively through the stages of larva, nymph and perfect insect,  the Meloidae add others which repeatedly transform the larva's  exterior, without introducing any modification of its viscera. This  mode of development, which preludes the customary entomological forms  by the multiple transfigurations of the larva, certainly deserves a  special name: I suggest that of _hypermetamorphosis_.    Let us now recapitulate the more prominent facts of this essay.    The Sitares, the Meloes, the Zonites and apparently other Meloidae,  possibly all of them, are in their earliest infancy parasites of the  harvesting Bees.    The larva of the Meloidae, before reaching the nymphal state, passes  through four forms, which I call the _primary larva_, the _secondary  larva_, the _pseudochrysalis_ and the _tertiary larva_. The passage  from one of these forms to the next is effected by a simple moult,  without any changes in the viscera.    The primary larva is leathery and settles on the Bee's body. Its  object is to get itself carried into a cell filled with honey. On  reaching the cell, it devours the Bee's egg; and its part is played.    The secondary larva is soft and differs completely from the primary  larva in its external characteristics. It feeds upon the honey  contained in the usurped cell.    The pseudochrysalis is a body deprived of all movement and clad in  horny integuments which may be compared with those of the pupae and  chrysalids. On these integuments we see a cephalic mask without  distinct or movable parts, six tubercles indicating the legs and nine  pairs of breathing-holes. In the Sitares the pseudochrysalis is  enclosed in a sort of sealed pouch and in the Zonites in a  tight-fitting bag formed of the skin of the secondary larva. In the  Meloes it is simply half-sheathed in the split skin of the secondary  larva.    The tertiary larva reproduces almost exactly the peculiarities of the  second; it is enclosed, in the Sitares and probably also the Zonites,  in a double vesicular envelope formed of the skin of the secondary  larva and the slough of the pseudochrysalis. In the Meloes, it is  half-enclosed in the split integuments of the pseudochrysalis, even as  these, in their turn, are half-enclosed in the skin of the secondary  larva.    From the tertiary larva onwards the metamorphoses follow their  habitual course, that is to say, this larva becomes a nymph; and this  nymph the perfect insect.

They  pet and tyrannize over Daisy by turns, and she is getting spoilt. Then  they must learn gentle ways, and improve their manners, and having girls  about will do it better than any thing else.\"    \"You are right, as usual. Now, who shall we have?\" asked Mr. Bhaer,  seeing by the look in her eye that Mrs. Jo had some one all ready to  propose.    \"Little Annie Harding.\"    \"What! Naughty Nan, as the lads call her?\" cried Mr. Bhaer, looking very  much amused.    \"Yes, she is running wild at home since her mother died, and is too  bright a child to be spoilt by servants. I have had my eye on her for  some time, and when I met her father in town the other day I asked him  why he did not send her to school. He said he would gladly if he could  find as good a school for girls as ours was for boys. I know he would  rejoice to have her come; so suppose we drive over this afternoon and  see about it.\"    \"Have not you cares enough now, my Jo, without this little gypsy to  torment you?\" asked Mr. Bhaer, patting the hand that lay on his arm.    \"Oh dear, no,\" said Mother Bhaer, briskly. \"I like it, and never was  happier than since I had my wilderness of boys. You see, Fritz, I feel a  great sympathy for Nan, because I was such a naughty child myself that  I know all about it. She is full of spirits, and only needs to be taught  what to do with them to be as nice a little girl as Daisy. Those quick  wits of hers would enjoy lessons if they were rightly directed, and what  is now a tricksy midget would soon become a busy, happy child. I know  how to manage her, for I remember how my blessed mother managed me,  and--\"    \"And if you succeed half as well as she did, you will have done a  magnificent work,\" interrupted Mr. Bhaer, who labored under the delusion  that Mrs. B. was the best and most charming woman alive.    \"Now, if you make fun of my plan I'll give you bad coffee for a week,  and then where are you, sir?\" cried Mrs. Jo, tweaking him by the ear  just as if he was one of the boys.    \"Won't Daisy's hair stand erect with horror at Nan's wild ways?\" asked  Mr. Bhaer, presently, when Teddy had swarmed up his waistcoat, and Rob  up his back, for they always flew at their father the minute school was  done.    \"At first, perhaps, but it will do Posy good. She is getting prim and  Bettyish, and needs stirring up a bit. She always has a good time when  Nan comes over to play, and the two will help each other without knowing  it. Dear me, half the science of teaching is knowing how much children  do for one another, and when to mix them.\"    \"I only hope she won't turn out another firebrand.\"    \"My poor Dan! I never can quite forgive myself for letting him go,\"  sighed Mrs. Bhaer.    At the sound of the name, little Teddy, who had never forgotten his  friend, struggled down from his father's arms, and trotted to the door,  looked out over the sunny lawn with a wistful face, and then trotted  back again, saying, as he always did when disappointed of the longed-for  sight,    \"My Danny's tummin' soon.\"    \"I really think we ought to have kept him, if only for Teddy's sake, he  was so fond of him, and perhaps baby's love would have done for him what  we failed to do.\"    \"I've sometimes felt that myself; but after keeping the boys in a  ferment, and nearly burning up the whole family, I thought it safer to  remove the firebrand, for a time at least,\" said Mr. Bhaer.    \"Dinner's ready, let me ring the bell,\" and Rob began a solo upon that  instrument which made it impossible to hear one's self speak.    \"Then I may have Nan, may I?\" asked Mrs. Jo.    \"A dozen Nans if you want them, my dear,\" answered Mr. Bhaer, who had  room in his fatherly heart for all the naughty neglected children in the  world.    When Mrs. Bhaer returned from her drive that afternoon, before she could  unpack the load of little boys, without whom she seldom moved, a small  girl of ten skipped out at the back of the carry-all and ran into the  house, shouting,    \"Hi, Daisy! where are you?\"    Daisy came, and looked pleased to see her guest, but also a trifle  alarmed, when Nan said, still prancing, as if it was impossible to keep  still,    \"I'm going to stay here always, papa says I may, and my box is coming  tomorrow, all my things had to be washed and mended, and your aunt came  and carried me off. Isn't it great fun?\"    \"Why, yes. Did you bring your big doll?\" asked Daisy, hoping she had,  for on the last visit Nan had ravaged the baby house, and insisted on  washing Blanche Matilda's plaster face, which spoilt the poor dear's  complexion for ever.    \"Yes, she's somewhere round,\" returned Nan, with most unmaternal  carelessness. \"I made you a ring coming along, and pulled the hairs out  of Dobbin's tail. Don't you want it?\" and Nan presented a horse-hair  ring in token of friendship, as they had both vowed they would never  speak to one another again when they last parted.    Won by the beauty of the offering, Daisy grew more cordial, and proposed  retiring to the nursery, but Nan said, \"No, I want to see the boys, and  the barn,\" and ran off, swinging her hat by one string till it broke,  when she left it to its fate on the grass.    \"Hullo! Nan!\" cried the boys as she bounced in among them with the  announcement,    \"I'm going to stay.\"    \"Hooray!\" bawled Tommy from the wall on which he was perched, for Nan  was a kindred spirit, and he foresaw \"larks\" in the future.    \"I can bat; let me play,\" said Nan, who could turn her hand to any  thing, and did not mind hard knocks.    \"We ain't playing now, and our side beat without you.\"    \"I can beat you in running, any way,\" returned Nan, falling back on her  strong point.    \"Can she?\" asked Nat of Jack.    \"She runs very well for a girl,\" answered Jack, who looked down upon Nan  with condescending approval.    \"Will you try?\" said Nan, longing to display her powers.    \"It's too hot,\" and Tommy languished against the wall as if quite  exhausted.    \"What's the matter with Stuffy?\" asked Nan, whose quick eyes were roving  from face to face.    \"Ball hurt his hand; he howls at every thing,\" answered Jack scornfully.    \"I don't, I never cry, no matter how I'm hurt; it's babyish,\" said Nan,  loftily.    \"Pooh! I could make you cry in two minutes,\" returned Stuffy, rousing  up.    \"See if you can.\"    \"Go and pick that bunch of nettles, then,\" and Stuffy pointed to a  sturdy specimen of that prickly plant growing by the wall.    Nan instantly \"grasped the nettle,\" pulled it up, and held it with a  defiant gesture, in spite of the almost unbearable sting.    \"Good for you,\" cried the boys, quick to acknowledge courage even in one  of the weaker sex.    More nettled than she was, Stuffy determined to get a cry out of her  somehow, and he said tauntingly, \"You are used to poking your hands into  every thing, so that isn't fair. Now go and bump your head real hard  against the barn, and see if you don't howl then.\"    \"Don't do it,\" said Nat, who hated cruelty.    But Nan was off, and running straight at the barn, she gave her head a  blow that knocked her flat, and sounded like a battering-ram. Dizzy, but  undaunted, she staggered up, saying stoutly, though her face was drawn  with pain,    \"That hurt, but I don't cry.\"    \"Do it again,\" said Stuffy angrily; and Nan would have done it, but Nat  held her; and Tommy, forgetting the heat, flew at Stuffy like a little  game-cock, roaring out,    \"Stop it, or I'll throw you over the barn!\" and so shook and hustled  poor Stuffy that for a minute he did not know whether he was on his head  or his heels.    \"She told me to,\" was all he could say, when Tommy let him alone.    \"Never mind if she did; it is awfully mean to hurt a little girl,\" said  Demi, reproachfully.    \"Ho! I don't mind; I ain't a little girl, I'm older than you and Daisy;  so now,\" cried Nan, ungratefully.    \"Don't preach, Deacon, you bully Posy every day of your life,\" called  out the Commodore, who just then hove in sight.    \"I don't hurt her; do I, Daisy?\" and Demi turned to his sister, who was  \"pooring\" Nan's tingling hands, and recommending water for the purple  lump rapidly developing itself on her forehead.    \"You are the best boy in the world,\" promptly answered Daisy; adding,  as truth compelled her to do, \"You hurt me sometimes, but you don't mean  to.\"    \"Put away the bats and things, and mind what you are about, my hearties.  No fighting allowed aboard this ship,\" said Emil, who rather lorded it  over the others.    \"How do you do, Madge Wildfire?\" said Mr. Bhaer, as Nan came in with  the rest to supper. \"Give the right hand, little daughter, and mind thy  manners,\" he added, as Nan offered him her left.    \"The other hurts me.\"    \"The poor little hand! what has it been doing to get those blisters?\" he  asked, drawing it from behind her back, where she had put it with a look  which made him think she had been in mischief.    Before Nan could think of any excuse, Daisy burst out with the whole  story, during which Stuffy tried to hide his face in a bowl of bread and  milk. When the tale was finished, Mr. Bhaer looked down the long table  towards his wife, and said with a laugh in his eyes,    \"This rather belongs to your side of the house, so I won't meddle with  it, my dear.\"    Mrs. Jo knew what he meant, but she liked her little black sheep all the  better for her pluck, though she only said in her soberest way,    \"Do you know why I asked Nan to come here?\"    \"To plague me,\" muttered Stuffy, with his mouth full.    \"To help make little gentlemen of you, and I think you have shown that  some of you need it.\"    Here Stuffy retired into his bowl again, and did not emerge till Demi  made them all laugh by saying, in his slow wondering way,    \"How can she,"]]]
