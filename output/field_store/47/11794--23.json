I stooped down, and raised some tea to his  baked lips (here and there upon the wharf were rows of little  pannikins containing this beverage). Then his hand touched mine, and  rested there, and I heard him mutter indistinctly, as though the  discovery had arrested his wandering senses--    \"Ha! this is surely a woman's hand.\"    I couldn't say much, but I tried to whisper something about hope and  trust in God; but all the while I think his thoughts were running on  this strange discovery. Perhaps I had brought to his poor mind  memories of his home, and the loving ones there, who would ask no  greater favour than the privilege of helping him thus; for he  continued to hold my hand in his feeble grasp, and whisper \"God bless  you, _woman_--whoever you are, God bless you!\"--over and over again.    I do not think that the surgeons noticed me at first, although, as  this was my introduction to Balaclava, I had not neglected my personal  appearance, and wore my favourite yellow dress, and blue bonnet, with  the red ribbons; but I noticed one coming to me, who, I think, would  have laughed very merrily had it not been for the poor fellow at my  feet. As it was, he came forward, and shook hands very kindly, saying,  \"How do you do, ma'am? Much obliged to you for looking after my poor  fellow; very glad to see you here.\" And glad they always were, the  kind-hearted doctors, to let me help them look after the sick and  wounded sufferers brought to that fearful wharf.    I wonder if I can ever forget the scenes I witnessed there? Oh! they  were heartrending. I declare that I saw rough bearded men stand by and  cry like the softest-hearted women at the sights of suffering they  saw; while some who scorned comfort for themselves, would fidget about  for hours before the long trains of mules and ambulances came in,  nervous lest the most trifling thing that could minister to the  sufferers' comfort should be neglected. I have often heard men talk  and preach very learnedly and conclusively about the great wickedness  and selfishness of the human heart; I used to wonder whether they  would have modified those opinions if they had been my companions for  one day of the six weeks I spent upon that wharf, and seen but one  day's experience of the Christian sympathy and brotherly love shown by  the strong to the weak. The task was a trying one, and familiarity,  you might think, would have worn down their keener feelings of pity  and sympathy; but it was not so.    I was in the midst of my sad work one day when the Admiral came up,  and stood looking on. He vouchsafed no word nor look of recognition in  answer to my salute, but stood silently by, his hands behind his back,  watching the sick being lifted into the boats. You might have thought  that he had little feeling, so stern and expressionless was his face;  but once, when they raised a sufferer somewhat awkwardly, and he  groaned deeply, that rough man broke out all at once with an oath,  that was strangely like a prayer, and bade the men, for God's sake,  take more care. And, coming up to me, he clapped me on the shoulder,  saying, \"I am glad to see you here, old lady, among these poor  fellows;\" while, I am most strangely deceived if I did not see a  tear-drop gathering in his eye. It was on this same day, I think, that  bending down over a poor fellow whose senses had quite gone, and, I  fear me, would never return to him in this world, he took me for his  wife, and calling me \"Mary, Mary,\" many times, asked me how it was he  had got home so quickly, and why he did not see the children; and said  he felt sure he should soon get better now. Poor fellow! I could not  undeceive him. I think the fancy happily caused by the touch of a  woman's hand soothed his dying hour; for I do not fancy he could have  lived to reach Scutari. I never knew it for certain, but I always felt  sure that he would never wake from that dream of home in this world.    And here, lest the reader should consider that I am speaking too  highly of my own actions, I must have recourse to a plan which I shall  frequently adopt in the following pages, and let another voice speak  for me in the kind letter received long after Balaclava had been left  to its old masters, by one who had not forgotten his old companion on  the sick-wharf. The writer, Major (then Captain) R----, had charge of  the wharf while I was there.        \"Glasgow, Sept. 1856.        \"Dear Mrs. Seacole,--I am very sorry to hear that you      have been unfortunate in business; but I am glad to hear      that you have found friends in Lord R---- and others,      who are ready to help you. No one knows better than I do      how much you did to help poor sick and wounded soldiers;      and I feel sure you will find in your day of trouble      that they have not forgotten it.\"    Major R---- was a brave and experienced officer, but the scenes on the  sick-wharf unmanned him often. I have known him nervously restless if  the people were behindhand, even for a few minutes, in their  preparations for the wounded. But in this feeling all shared alike.  Only women could have done more than they did who attended to this  melancholy duty; and they, not because their hearts could be softer,  but because their hands are moulded for this work.    But it must not be supposed that we had no cheerful scenes upon the  sick-wharf. Sometimes a light-hearted fellow--generally a  sailor--would forget his pain, and do his best to keep the rest in  good spirits. Once I heard my name eagerly pronounced, and turning  round, recognised a sailor whom I remembered as one of the crew of the  \"Alarm,\" stationed at Kingston, a few years back.    \"Why, as I live, if this ain't Aunty Seacole, of Jamaica! Shiver all  that's left of my poor timbers\"--and I saw that the left leg was  gone--\"if this ain't a rum go, mates!\"    \"Ah! my man, I'm sorry to see you in this sad plight.\"    \"Never fear for me, Aunty Seacole; I'll make the best of the leg the  Rooshians have left me. I'll get at them soon again, never fear. You  don't think, messmates\"--he never left his wounded comrades  alone--\"that they'll think less of us at home for coming back with a  limb or so short?\"    \"You bear your troubles well, my son.\"    \"Eh! do I, Aunty?\" and he seemed surprised. \"Why, look'ye, when I've  seen so many pretty fellows knocked off the ship's roll altogether,  don't you think I ought to be thankful if I can answer the bo'swain's  call anyhow?\"    And this was the sailors' philosophy always. And this brave fellow,  after he had sipped some lemonade, and laid down, when he heard the  men groaning, raised his head and comforted them in the same strain  again; and, it may seem strange, but it quieted them.    I used to make sponge-cakes on board the \"Medora,\" with eggs brought  from Constantinople. Only the other day, Captain S----, who had charge  of the \"Medora,\" reminded me of them. These, with some lemonade, were  all the doctors would allow me to give to the wounded. They all liked  the cake, poor fellows, better than anything else: perhaps because it  tasted of \"home.\"          CHAPTER XI.        ALARMS IN THE HARBOUR--GETTING THE STORES ON      SHORE--ROBBERY BY NIGHT AND DAY--THE PREDATORY TRIBES OF      BALACLAVA--ACTIVITY OF THE AUTHORITIES--WE OBTAIN LEAVE      TO ERECT OUR STORE, AND FIX UPON SPRING HILL AS ITS      SITE--THE TURKISH PACHA--THE FLOOD--OUR CARPENTERS--I      BECOME AN ENGLISH SCHOOLMISTRESS ABROAD.      My life in Balaclava could not but be a rough one. The exposure by day  was enough to try any woman's strength; and at night one was not  always certain of repose. Nor was it the easiest thing to clamber up  the steep sides of the \"Medora;\" and more than once I narrowly escaped  a sousing in the harbour. Why it should be so difficult to climb a  ship's side, when a few more staves in the ladder, and those a little  broader, would make it so easy, I have never been able to guess. And  once on board the \"Medora,\" my berth would not altogether have suited  a delicate female with weak nerves. It was an ammunition ship, and we  slept over barrels of gunpowder and tons of cartridges, with the by no  means impossible contingency of their prematurely igniting, and giving  us no time to say our prayers before launching us into eternity. Great  care was enjoined, and at eight o'clock every evening Captain S----  would come down, and order all lights out for the night. But I used to  put my lantern into a deep basin, behind some boxes, and so evaded the  regulation. I felt rather ashamed of this breach of discipline one  night, when another ammunition ship caught fire in the crowded  harbour, and threatened us all with speedy destruction. We all knew,  if they failed in extinguishing the fire pretty quickly, what our  chances of life were worth, and I think the bravest drew his breath  heavily at the thought of our danger. Fortunately, they succeeded in  extinguishing the firebrand before any mischief was done; but I do not  think the crew of the \"Medora\" slept very comfortably that night. It  was said that the Russians had employed an incendiary; but it would  have been strange if in that densely crowded harbour some accidents  had not happened without their agency.    Harassing work, indeed, was the getting our stores on shore, with the  aid of the Greek and Maltese boatmen, whose profession is thievery.  Not only did they demand exorbitant sums for the carriage, but they  contrived to rob us by the way in the most ingenious manner. Thus many  things of value were lost in the little journey from the \"Albatross\"  and \"Nonpareil\" to the shore, which had made the long voyage from  England safely. Keep as sharp a look out as I might, some package or  box would be tipped overboard by the sudden swaying of the boat, or  passing by of one of the boatmen--of course, accidentally--and no  words"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23033"],[0,"Classic French Course in English (#18)"],[1,"    understand a vacuum, and I much prefer subtile matter.         TRISS. I quite agree with Descartes about magnetism.         ARM. I like his vortices.         PHIL. And I, his falling worlds.         ARM. I long to see our assembly opened, and to distinguish       ourselves by some great discovery.         TRISS. Much is expected from your enlightened knowledge, for nature       has hidden few things from you.         PHIL. For my part, I have, without boasting, already made one       discovery; I have plainly seen men in the moon.         BEL. I have not, I believe, as yet quite distinguished men, but I       have seen steeples as plainly as I see you.         ARM. In addition to natural philosophy, we will dive into grammar,       history, verse, ethics, and politics.         PHIL. I find in ethics charms which delight my heart; it was       formerly the admiration of great geniuses: but I give the       preference to the Stoics, and I think nothing so grand as their       founder.    \"Les Precieuses Ridicules\" is an earlier and lighter treatment of the  same theme. The object of ridicule in both these pieces was a lapsed and  degenerate form of what originally was a thing worthy of respect, and  even of praise. At the Hotel de Rambouillet, conversation was cultivated  as a fine art. There was, no doubt, something overstrained in the  standards which the ladies of that circle enforced. Their mutual  communication was all conducted in a peculiar style of language, the  natural deterioration of which was into a kind of euphuism, such as  English readers will remember to have seen exemplified in Walter Scott's  Sir Piercie Shafton. These ladies called each other, with demonstrative  fondness, \"Ma precieuse.\" Hence at last the term _precieuse_ as a  designation of ridicule. Madame de Sevigne was a _precieuse_. But she,  with many of her peers, was too rich in sarcastic common sense to be a  _precieuse ridicule_. Moliere himself, thrifty master of policy that he  was, took pains to explain that he did not satirize the real thing, but  only the affectation.    \"Tartuffe, or the Impostor,\" is perhaps the most celebrated of all  Moliere's plays. Scarcely comedy, scarcely tragedy, it partakes of both  characters. Like tragedy, serious in purpose, it has a happy ending  like comedy. Pity and terror are absent; or, if not quite absent, these  sentiments are present raised only to a pitch distinctly below the  tragic. Indignation is the chief passion excited, or detestation,  perhaps, rather than indignation. This feeling is provided at last with  its full satisfaction in the condign punishment visited on the impostor.    The original \"Tartuffe,\" like the most of Moliere's comedies, is written  in rhymed verse. We could not, with any effort, make the English-reading  student of Moliere sufficiently feel how much is lost when the form is  lost which the creations of this great genius took, in their native  French, under his own master hand. A satisfactory metrical rendering is  out of the question. The sense, at least, if not the incommunicable  spirit, of the original is very well given in Mr. C. H. Wall's version,  which we use.    The story of \"Tartuffe\" is briefly this: Tartuffe, the hero, is a pure  villain. He mixes no adulteration of good in his composition. He is  hypocrisy itself, the strictly genuine article. Tartuffe has completely  imposed upon one Orgon, a man of wealth and standing. Orgon, with his  wife, and with his mother, in fact, believes in him absolutely. These  people have received the canting rascal into their house, and are about  to bestow upon him their daughter in marriage. The following scene from  act first shows the skill with which Moliere could exhibit, in a few  strokes of bold exaggeration, the infatuation of Orgon's regard for  Tartuffe. Orgon has been absent from home. He returns, and meets  Cleante, his brother, whom, in his eagerness, he begs to excuse his not  answering a question just addressed to him:--         ORGON (_to_ CLEANTE). Brother, pray excuse me: you will kindly       allow me to allay my anxiety by asking news of the family. (_To_       DORINE, _a maid-servant_.) Has every thing gone on well these last       two days? What has happened? How is everybody?         DOR. The day before yesterday our mistress was very feverish from       morning to night, and suffered from a most extraordinary headache.         ORG. And Tartuffe?         DOR. Tartuffe! He is wonderfully well, stout and fat, with blooming       cheeks and ruddy lips.         ORG. Poor man!         DOR. In the evening she felt very faint, and the pain in her head       was so great that she could not touch any thing at supper.         ORG. And Tartuffe?         DOR. He ate his supper by himself before her, and very devoutly       devoured a brace of partridges, and half a leg of mutton hashed.         ORG. Poor man!         DOR. She spent the whole of the night without getting one wink of       sleep: she was very feverish, and we had to sit up with her until       the morning.         ORG. And Tartuffe?         DOR. Overcome by a pleasant sleepiness, he passed from the table to       his room, and got at once into his warmed bed, where he slept       comfortably till the next morning.         ORG. Poor man!         DOR. At last yielding to our persuasions, she consented to be bled,       and immediately felt relieved.         ORG. And Tartuffe?         DOR. He took heart right valiantly, and fortifying his soul against       all evils, to make up for the blood which our lady had lost, drank       at breakfast four large bumpers of wine.         ORG. Poor man!         DOR. Now, at last, they are both well; and I will go and tell our       lady how glad you are to hear of her recovery.    Tartuffe repays the trust and love of his benefactor by making improper  advances to that benefactor's wife. Orgon's son, who does not share his  father's confidence in Tartuffe, happens to be an unseen witness of the  man's infamous conduct. He exposes the hypocrite to Orgon, with the  result of being himself expelled from the house for his pains; while  Tartuffe, in recompense for the injury done to his feelings, is  presented with a gift-deed of Orgon's estate. But now Orgon's wife  contrives to let her husband see and hear for himself the vileness of  Tartuffe. This done, Orgon confronts the villain, and, with just  indignation, orders him out of his house. Tartuffe reminds Orgon that  the shoe is on the other foot; that he is himself now owner there, and  that it is Orgon, instead of Tartuffe, who must go. Orgon has an  interview with his mother, who is exasperatingly sure still that  Tartuffe is a maligned good man:--         MADAME PERNELLE. I can never believe, my son, that he would commit       so base an action.         ORG. What?         PER. Good people are always subject to envy.         ORG. What do you mean, mother?         PER. That you live after a strange sort here, and that I am but too       well aware of the ill will they all bear him.         ORG. What has this ill will to do with what I have just told you?         PER. I have told it you a hundred times when you were young, that       in this world virtue is ever liable to persecution, and that,       although the envious die, envy never dies.         ORG. But what has this to do with what has happened to-day?         PER. They have concocted a hundred foolish stories against him.         ORG. I have already told you that I saw it all myself.         PER. The malice of evil-disposed persons is very great.         ORG. You would make me swear, mother! I tell you that I saw his       audacious attempt with my own eyes.         PER. Evil tongues have always some venom to pour forth; and here       below, there is nothing proof against them.         ORG. You are maintaining a very senseless argument. I saw it, I       tell you,--saw it with my own eyes! what you can call s-a-w, saw!       Must I din it over and over into your ears, and shout as loud as       half a dozen people?         PER. Gracious goodness! appearances often deceive us! We must not       always judge by what we see.         ORG. I shall go mad!         PER. We are by nature prone to judge wrongly, and good is often       mistaken for evil.         ORG. I ought to look upon his desire of seducing my wife as       charitable?         PER. You ought to have good reasons before you accuse another, and       you should have waited till you were quite sure of the fact.         ORG. Heaven save the mark! how could I be more sure? I suppose,       mother, I ought to have waited till--you will make me say something       foolish.         PER. In short, his soul is possessed with too pure a zeal; and I       cannot possibly conceive that he would think of attempting what you       accuse him of.         ORG. If you were not my mother, I really don't know what I might       now say to you, you make me so savage.    The short remainder of the scene has for its important idea, the  suggestion that under the existing circumstances some sort of peace  ought to be patched up between Orgon and Tartuffe. Meantime one LOYAL is  observed coming, whereupon the fourth scene of act fifth opens:--         LOY. (to DORINE _at the farther part of the stage_). Good-day, my       dear sister; pray let me speak to your master.         DOR. He is with friends, and I do not think he can see any one just       now.         LOY. I would not be intrusive. I feel sure that he will find       nothing unpleasant in my visit: in fact, I come for something which       will be very gratifying to him.         DOR. What is your name?         LOY. Only tell him that I come from Mr. Tartuffe, for his benefit.         DOR. (to ORGON). It is a man who comes in a civil way from Mr.       Tartuffe, on some business which will make you glad, he says.         CLE. (to ORGON). You must see who it is, and what the man wants."]]]
