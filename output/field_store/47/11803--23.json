To the men  of Penuel he also said, \"When I come back victorious, I will break down  this tower.\"    Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their forces were with them, in  all about fifteen thousand men. Gideon went up by the caravan road and  surprised the horde as it was encamped with no fear of being attacked.  He divided the three hundred men into three companies. Into the hands of  all of them he put horns and empty earthen jars. In each jar was a  torch. He also said to them, \"Watch me and do as I do. When I reach the  outside of the camp and those who are with me blow a blast on the horn,  then you also shall blow your horns on every side of the camp and cry,  'For Jehovah and Gideon!'\"    So Gideon and the hundred men with him reached the outside of the camp  at the beginning of the middle watch, when guards had just been posted;  and they blew the horns and broke in pieces the jars that were in their  hands. The two other companies also broke their jars, took the torches  in their left hands and their swords in their right, and cried, \"The  Sword of Jehovah and of Gideon.\" And as they stood where they were,  about the camp, the entire horde awoke, sounded the alarm, and fled.  Zebah and Zalmunna also fled; but Gideon followed and captured the two  kings of Midian and threw all the horde into a panic.    When Gideon returned from the battle, he captured a young man who lived  at Succoth. At Gideon's request he wrote down for him the names of the  rulers of Succoth and its leading men. There were seventy-seven in all.  When Gideon came to the men of Succoth, he said, \"See, here are Zebah  and Zalmunna about whom you mocked me, saying, 'Are Zebah and Zalmunna  already in your power that we should give bread to your men who are  weary?'\" Then he took desert thorns and briers, and with these he  thrashed the leading men of Succoth. He also broke down the tower of  Penuel and put to death the men of the town.    Then Gideon said to Zebah and Zalmunna, \"What kind of men were those  whom you killed at Tabor?\" They replied, \"They were just like you; each  of them looked like a prince.\" Gideon said, \"They were my own brothers,  the sons of my mother. As surely as Jehovah lives, if you had saved them  alive, I would not kill you now.\"    Then he said to Jether, his oldest son, \"Up and kill them.\" But the boy  did not draw his sword, because he was afraid, for he was only a boy.  Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, \"Get up yourself and fall upon us; for a  man has a man's strength!\" So Gideon rose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna,  and took the crescents that were on their camels' necks.    Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, \"Rule over us, and not only you  but your son and your son's son after you, for you have saved us from  the power of the Midianites.\" Gideon said to them, \"I will not rule over  you, nor shall my son rule over you; Jehovah shall rule over you; but  let me make one request of you: let every man give me the ear-rings from  his spoil\" (for they had golden ear-rings, because they were desert  dwellers). They answered, \"Certainly, we will give them.\" So they spread  out a blanket and each man threw into it the ear-rings from his spoil.  The weight of the golden ear-rings for which he had asked was nearly  seventy pounds of gold. Then Gideon made of the gold a priestly robe to  wear when asking questions of Jehovah, and placed it in his own city,  Ophrah.    Gideon died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of Joash, his  father, in Ophrah of the Abiezerites.      JEPHTHAH'S FOOLISH PROMISE    Jephthah, the Gileadite, was an able warrior, but he was the son of a  wicked woman, and had fled from his relatives and lived in the land of  Tob. There certain rascals gathered about him, and they used to go out  on raids with him.    After a time the Ammonites made war against the Israelites. Then the  elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah from the land of Tob, and they  said to him, \"Come and be our commander, that we may fight against the  Ammonites.\" But Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, \"Are you not the  men who hated me and drove me out of my father's house? Why then do you  come to me now when you are in trouble?\" But the elders of Gilead said  to Jephthah, \"This is why we have now turned to you, that you may go  with us and fight against the Ammonites, and you shall be our chief,  even over all the people who live in Gilead.\" Then Jephthah said to the  rulers of Gilead, \"If you take me back to fight against the Ammonites  and Jehovah gives me the victory over them, I shall be your chief.\" The  elders of Gilead replied, \"Jehovah shall be a witness between us; we  swear to do as you say.\"    Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him  chief and commander over them. Jephthah also made this vow to Jehovah:  \"If thou wilt deliver the Ammonites into my power, then whoever comes  out of the door of my house to meet me, when I return victorious from  the Ammonites, shall be Jehovah's, and I will offer that one as an  offering to be burned with fire.\"    So Jephthah went out to fight against the Ammonites; and Jehovah gave  him the victory over them, and delivered them into his hands. But when  he came home to Mizpah, his daughter was just coming out to meet him  with tambourines and choral dances. She was his only child; besides this  one he had neither son nor daughter. So when he saw her, he tore his  clothes and said, \"Oh, my daughter, you have stricken me! It is you who  are the cause of my woe! for I have made a solemn vow to Jehovah and  cannot break it.\" She said to him, \"My father, you have made a solemn  vow to Jehovah; do to me what you have promised, since Jehovah has  punished your enemies the Ammonites. But let this favor be granted me:  spare me two months that I may go out upon the mountains with those who  would have been my bridesmaids and lament because I will never become a  wife and mother.\" He said, \"Go.\"    So he sent her away for two months with her friends, and she mourned on  the mountains because she would never become a wife and mother. At the  end of two months she returned to her father, who did what he had vowed  to do, even though she had never been married. So it became a custom in  Israel: each year the women of Israel go out for four days to bewail the  death of the daughter of Jephthah, the Gileadite.      SAMSON WHO DID TO OTHERS AS THEY DID TO HIM    There was a certain man of Zorah, of the clan of the Danites, named  Manoah; and he and his wife had no children. But the angel of Jehovah  appeared to the woman and said to her, \"See, you have no children; but  now be careful not to drink any wine nor strong drink, and do not eat  anything unclean, for you are about to have a son. No razor shall be  used upon your son's head, for from birth the boy shall belong to God.\"  So the woman had a son and named him Samson.    Once Samson went down to Timnah and saw there a Philistine woman. When  he came back he said to his father and mother, \"I have seen a Philistine  woman in Timnah. Get her as a wife for me.\" But his father and mother  said to him, \"Is there no woman in your own tribe or among all our  people, that you must marry a wife from among the heathen Philistines?\"  But Samson said to his father, \"Get her for me, for she suits me.\"    So Samson went with his father and mother to Timnah; and just as they  came to the vineyards of Timnah, a full-grown young lion came roaring  toward him. The spirit of Jehovah came upon Samson and, although he had  nothing in his hand, he tore the beast in two as one tears a kid. But he  did not tell his father and mother what he had done.    Then he went down and talked with the woman, and she suited him. When he  returned after a while to marry her, he turned aside to see what was  left of the lion, and there was a swarm of bees and honey in the  carcass. He scraped the honey out into his hands and went on, eating it  as he went. When he came to his father and mother, he gave some to them,  and they ate; but he did not tell them that he had taken the honey out  of the carcass of the lion.    Then Samson went down to the woman; and he gave a feast there (for so  bridegrooms used to do). When the Philistines saw him, they provided  thirty comrades to be with him. And Samson said to them, \"Let me now  tell you a riddle. If you can tell me what it is within the seven days  of the feast, I will give you thirty fine linen robes and thirty suits  of clothes; but if you cannot tell me, then you shall give me thirty  fine linen robes and thirty suits of clothes.\" They said to him, \"Tell  your riddle, that we may hear it.\" And he said to them:            \"Out of the eater came something to eat,           And out of the strong came something sweet.\"    But for six days they could not solve the riddle.    On the seventh day they said to Samson's wife, \"Tease your husband until  he tells us the riddle, or else we will burn up you and your father's  house. Did you invite us here to make us poor?\" So Samson's wife wept  before him and said, \"You only hate me and do not love me at all! You  have told a riddle to my fellow countrymen and not told me what it is.\"  He said to her, \"See, I have not told it to my father or my mother, and  shall I tell you?\" So she wept before him as long as their feast lasted,  but on the seventh day he told her, because she kept asking him; and she  told the riddle to her fellow countrymen.    So the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23593"],[0,"Lectures on Architecture and Painting, Delivered at Edinburgh in November 1853 (#18)"],[1,"placed in what was then one of the loveliest districts  upon the earth, full of glorious vegetation, bounded on one side by the  sea, on the north by \"that goodly mountain\" Lebanon, on the south and  east by deserts, whose barrenness enhanced by their contrast the sense  of the perfection of beauty in their own land, they became, by these  means, and by the touch of God's own hand upon their hearts, sensible to  the appeal of natural scenery in a way in which no other people were at  the time. And their literature is full of expressions, not only  testifying a vivid sense of the power of nature over man, but showing  that _sympathy with natural things themselves_, as if they had human  souls, which is the especial characteristic of true love of the works of  God. I intended to have insisted on this sympathy at greater length, but  I found, only two or three days ago, much of what I had to say to you  anticipated in a little book, unpretending, but full of interest, \"The  Lamp and the Lantern,\" by Dr. James Hamilton; and I will therefore only  ask you to consider such expressions as that tender and glorious verse  in Isaiah, speaking of the cedars on the mountains as rejoicing over the  fall of the king of Assyria: \"Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and  the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since _thou_ art gone down to the grave,  no feller is come up against us.\" See what sympathy there is here, as if  with the very hearts of the trees themselves. So also in the words of  Christ, in His personification of the lilies: \"They toil not, neither do  they spin.\" Consider such expressions as, \"The sea saw that, and fled.  Jordan was driven back. The mountains skipped like rams; and the little  hills like lambs.\" Try to find anything in profane writing like this;  and note farther that the whole book of Job appears to have been chiefly  written and placed in the inspired volume in order to show the value of  natural history, and its power on the human heart. I cannot pass by it  without pointing out the evidences of the beauty of the country that Job  inhabited.[30] Observe, first, it was an arable country. \"The oxen were  plowing and the asses feeding beside them.\" It was a pastoral country:  his substance, besides camels and asses, was 7,000 sheep. It was a  mountain country, fed by streams descending from the high snows. \"My  brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks  they pass away; which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the  snow is hid: What time they wax warm they vanish: when it is hot they  are consumed out of their place.\" Again: \"If I wash myself with snow  water, and make my hands never so clean.\" Again: \"Drought and heat  consume the snow waters.\" It was a rocky country, with forests and  verdure rooted in the rocks. \"His branch shooteth forth in his garden;  his roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.\"  Again: \"Thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field.\" It was a  place visited, like the valleys of Switzerland, by convulsions and falls  of mountains. \"Surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the  rock is removed out of his place. The waters wear the stones; thou  washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth.\" \"He  removeth the mountains and they know not: he overturneth them in his  anger.\" \"He putteth forth his hand upon the rock: he overturneth the  mountains by the roots: he cutteth out rivers among the rocks.\" I have  not time to go farther into this; but you see Job's country was one like  your own, full of pleasant brooks and rivers, rushing among the rocks,  and of all other sweet and noble elements of landscape. The magnificent  allusions to natural scenery throughout the book are therefore  calculated to touch the heart to the end of time.    [Footnote 30: This passage, respecting the book of Job, was omitted in  the delivery of the Lecture, for want of time.]    80. Then at the central point of Jewish prosperity, you have the first  great naturalist the world ever saw, Solomon; not permitted, indeed, to  anticipate, in writing, the discoveries of modern times, but so gifted  as to show us that heavenly wisdom is manifested as much in the  knowledge of the hyssop that springeth out of the wall as in political  and philosophical speculation.    The books of the Old Testament, as distinguished from all other early  writings, are thus prepared for an everlasting influence over humanity;  and, finally, Christ himself, setting the concluding example to the  conduct and thoughts of men, spends nearly His whole life in the fields,  the mountains, or the small country villages of Judea; and in the very  closing scenes of His life, will not so much as sleep within the walls  of Jerusalem, but rests at the little village of Bethphage, walking in  the morning, and returning in the evening, through the peaceful avenues  of the Mount of Olives, to and from His work of teaching in the temple.    81. It would thus naturally follow, both from the general tone and  teaching of the Scriptures, and from the example of our Lord himself,  that wherever Christianity was preached and accepted, there would be an  immediate interest awakened in the works of God, as seen in the natural  world: and, accordingly, this is the second universal and distinctive  character of Christian art, as distinguished from all pagan work; the  first being a peculiar spirituality in its conception of the human form,  preferring holiness of expression and strength of character, to beauty  of features or of body; and the second, as I say, its intense fondness  for natural objects--animals, leaves, and flowers,--inducing an  immediate transformation of the cold and lifeless pagan ornamentation  into vivid imagery of nature. Of course this manifestation of feeling  was at first checked by the circumstances under which the Christian  religion was disseminated. The art of the first three centuries is  entirely subordinate,--restrained partly by persecution, partly by a  high spirituality, which cared much more about preaching than painting;  and then when, under Constantine, Christianity became the religion of  the Roman empire, myriads of persons gave the aid of their wealth and of  their art to the new religion, who were Christians in nothing but the  name, and who decorated a Christian temple just as they would have  decorated a pagan one, merely because the new religion had become  Imperial. Then, just as the new art was beginning to assume a  distinctive form, down came the northern barbarians upon it; and all  their superstitions had to be leavened with it, and all their hard hands  and hearts softened by it, before their art could appear in anything  like a characteristic form. The warfare in which Europe was perpetually  plunged retarded this development for ages; but it steadily and  gradually prevailed, working from the eighth to the eleventh century  like a seed in the ground, showing little signs of life, but still, if  carefully examined, changing essentially every day and every hour: at  last, in the twelfth century the blade appears above the black earth;  in the thirteenth, the plant is in full leaf.    82. I begin, then, with the thirteenth century, and must now make to you  a general assertion, which, if you will note down and examine at your  leisure, you will find true and useful, though I have not time at  present to give you full demonstration of it.    I say, then, that the art of the thirteenth century is the foundation of  all art--nor merely the foundation, but the root of it; that is to say,  succeeding art is not merely built upon it, but was all comprehended in  it, and is developed out of it. Passing this great century, we find  three successive branches developed from it, in each of the three  following centuries. The fourteenth century is pre-eminently the age of  _Thought_, the fifteenth the age of _Drawing_, and the sixteenth the age  of _Painting_.    83. Observe, first, the fourteenth century is pre-eminently the age of  thought. It begins with the first words of the poem of Dante; and all  the great pictorial poems--the mighty series of works in which  everything is done to relate, but nothing to imitate--belong to this  century. I should only confuse you by giving you the names of marvelous  artists, most of them little familiar to British ears, who adorned this  century in Italy; but you will easily remember it as the age of Dante  and Giotto--the age of _Thought_.    The men of the succeeding century (the fifteenth) felt that they could  not rival their predecessors in invention, but might excel them in  execution. Original thoughts belonging to this century are comparatively  rare; even Raphael and Michael Angelo themselves borrowed all their  principal ideas and plans of pictures from their predecessors; but they  executed them with a precision up to that time unseen. You must  understand by the word \"drawing,\" the perfect rendering of forms,  whether in sculpture or painting; and then remember the fifteenth  century as the age of Leonardo, Michael Angelo, Lorenzo Ghiberti, and  Raphael--pre-eminently the age of _Drawing_.    [Illustration: PLATE XIII. (Fig. 20., Fig. 21.)]    The sixteenth century produced the four greatest _Painters_, that is to  say, managers of color, whom the world has seen; namely, Tintoret, Paul  Veronese, Titian, and Correggio. I need not say more to justify my  calling it the age of _Painting_.    84. This, then, being the state of things respecting art in general, let  us next trace the career of landscape through these centuries.    It was only towards the close of the thirteenth century that figure  painting began to assume so perfect a condition as to require some  elaborate suggestion of landscape background. Up to that time, if any  natural object had to be represented, it was done in an entirely  conventional way, as you see it upon Greek vases, or in a Chinese "]]]
