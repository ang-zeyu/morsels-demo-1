It was plain he was disconcerted and uncertain as to how to proceed.    Mr. Donovan, however, came to his rescue, stepping tactfully into the  breach:    \"I was not needed for anything but to supply your address, sir; but I  was able to do that, so between us all we have contrived to return your  pocketbook to you as good as before it left your possession.\"    As he spoke Mr. Tolman drew forth the missing bill book and held it  toward its owner.    \"That looks pretty good to me!\" Mr. Ackerman exclaimed, as he took the  article from Mr. Tolman's outstretched hand and regarded it  reflectively. \"I don't know when I have ever done anything so careless  and stupid. You see I had got part way to the bank before I remembered  that I had left my glasses, on which I am absolutely dependent, at home.  Therefore, there being no taxi in sight, I hailed a passing bus and  climbed up beside this youngster. How the bill book happened to slip out  of my pocket I cannot explain. It seemed to me it would be safer to have  the securities upon my person than in a bag that might be snatched from  me; but apparently my logic was at fault. I was, however, so certain of  my wisdom that I never thought to question it until I had reached the  sidewalk and the bus had gone.    \"Your boy, Mr. Tolman, confided while we rode along this morning that he  was visiting in New York for a few days; but of course I did not ask his  name or address and so when I wanted his help in tracing the missing  pocketbook I had no way of locating him beyond assuming that he must be  staying at one of the hotels. Therefore when the omnibus company could  furnish no clue, I got into touch with an agency whose business it is to  hunt people up. If the pocketbook had been dropped on the bus I felt  sure your boy, who was almost the only other person on top of the coach,  would know about it; if, on the other hand, it had been dropped in the  street, my problem would be a different one. In either case the sooner I  knew my course of action the better. I hope you will believe, Mr.  Tolman, that when I called in the aid of detectives I had no suspicions  against your son's honesty.\"    Mr. Tolman waved the final remark aside good-humoredly.    \"We have not taken the affair as a personal matter at all,\" he declared.  \"We fully appreciate your difficulty in finding Stephen, for he was also  up against the problem of finding you. New York is a rather large city  anyway, and for two people who do not even know one another's names to  get together is like hunting a needle in a haystack. Our only recourse  to discovering the owner of the pocketbook would be through the  advertising columns of the papers and that is the method we should have  followed had not Donovan appeared and saved us the trouble.\"    He exchanged a smile with the detective.    \"The advertising column was my one hope,\" Mr. Ackerman replied. \"I felt  sure that any honest person who picked up the purse would advertise it.  It was not the honest people I was worrying about. It was the thought  that I had dropped the bill book in the street where any  Tom-Dick-and-Harry could run away with it that concerned me. Moreover,  even if your boy had found it on the bus, he might have turned it in to  an employee of the coach line who was not honest enough to give it in  turn to his superiors. So I wanted to know where I stood; and now that I  do I cannot tell you how grateful I am both to Stephen and to this  officer here for the service they have rendered me.\" Then, turning  toward Mr. Tolman, he added in an undertone, \"I hope neither you nor  your son have suffered any annoyance through this unfortunate incident.\"    \"Not in the least,\" was the prompt response. \"I confess we were a trifle  disconcerted at first; but Mr. Donovan has performed his duty with such  courtesy that we entertain toward him nothing but gratitude.\"    \"I am glad of that,\" Mr. Ackerman replied, \"for I should deeply regret  placing either you or your boy, even for a moment, in an uncomfortable  position, or one where it might appear that I--\"    But Mr. Tolman cut him short.    \"You took the quickest, most sensible course, Ackerman,\" said he. \"Too  much was at stake for you to risk delay. When a pocketbook filled with  negotiable securities disappears one must of necessity act with speed.  Neither Stephen nor I cherish the least ill-will about the affair; do  we, son?\"    \"No, indeed.\"    Then smiling ingenuously up into the face of the New York man, he said:    \"Don't you want to look in your pocketbook and see if everything is all  right, sir?\"    The steamboat financier laughed.    \"You are a prudent young man,\" declared he. \"No, I am quite willing to  risk that the property you have so kindly guarded is intact.\"    \"It ought to be,\" the boy said. \"I haven't even opened the pocketbook.\"    \"A better proof still that everything is safe within it,\" chuckled Mr.  Ackerman. \"No, sonny, I am not worrying. I should not worry even if you  had ransacked the bill book from one end to the other. I'd take a chance  on the honesty of a boy like you.\"    Mr. Tolman, however, who had been listening, now came forward and broke  into the conversation:    \"Stephen's suggestion is a good, businesslike one, Ackerman,\" he  declared. \"As a mere matter of form--not as a slam against our morals--I  am sure that both he and I would prefer that you examined your property  while we are all here together and assure yourself that it is all  right.\"    \"Pooh! Pooh! Nonsense!\" objected the financier.    \"It is a wise notion, Mr. Ackerman,\" rejoined Mr. Donovan. \"Business is  business. None of us questions the honor of Mr. Tolman or his son. They  know that. Nevertheless I am sure we should all feel better satisfied  if you went through the formality of an investigation.\"    \"Very well, just as you say. But I want it understood that I do it at  their and your request. I am perfectly satisfied to leave things as they  are.\"    Taking the now familiar red pocketbook from his coat he opened it  unconcernedly; then the three persons watching him saw a look of  consternation banish the smile from his face.    \"What's wrong, Ackerman?\" inquired the plain-clothes man quickly.    Without a word the other held the bill book toward him. It was empty.  Bonds, securities, money were gone! A gasp of incredulity came from  Stephen.    \"I didn't open it--truly I didn't!\" exclaimed he, in a terror-stricken  voice.    But Mr. Ackerman did not heed the remark.    \"I am afraid this looks pretty black for us, Ackerman,\" said Mr. Tolman  slowly. \"We have nothing to give you but the boy's word.\"    Mr. Donovan, however, who had been studying the group with a hawklike  scrutiny now sprang to his feet and caught up his hat.    \"I don't see how they dared put it over!\" he exclaimed excitedly. \"But  they almost got away with it. Even I was fooled.\"    \"You don't mean to insinuate,\" Mr. Tolman burst out, \"that you think  we--\"    \"Good heavens, no!\" replied the detective with his hand on the door  knob. \"Don't go getting hot under the collar, Mr. Tolman. Nobody is  slamming _you_. I have been pretty stupid about this affair, I'm afraid;  but give me credit for recognizing honest people when I see them. No,  somebody has tricked you--tricked you all. But the game isn't up yet. If  you gentlemen will just wait here--\"    The sentence was cut short by the banging of the door. The detective was  gone. His departure was followed by an awkward silence.    Mr. Ackerman's face clouded into a frown of disappointment and anxiety;  Mr. Tolman paced the floor and puffed viciously at a cigar; and Steve,  his heart cold within him, looked from one to the other, chagrin,  mortification and terror in his eyes.    \"I didn't open the pocketbook, Mr. Ackerman,\" he reiterated for the  twentieth time. \"I truly didn't.\"    But the steamboat magnate was too deeply absorbed in his own thoughts  and speculations to notice the high-pitched voice with its intonation of  distress.    At last Mr. Tolman could endure the situation no longer.    \"This is a most unfortunate happening, Ackerman,\" he burst out. \"I am  more concerned about it than I can express. My boy and I are utter  strangers to you and we have no way of proving our honesty. All I can  say is that we are as much amazed at the turn affairs have taken as  yourself, and we regret it with quite as much poignancy--perhaps more  since it reflects directly upon us. If there is anything we can do--\"    He stopped, awaiting a reply from the other man, but none came.    \"Good heavens, Ackerman,\" he cried. \"You don't mean to say you do not  believe my son and me--that you suspect us of double-dealing!\"    \"I don't know what to believe, Tolman,\" owned Mr. Ackerman with candor.  \"I want very much to credit your story; in my heart, I do credit it. But  head and heart seem to be at variance in this matter. Frankly I am  puzzled to know where the contents of that pocketbook have gone. Were  the things taken out before the bill book fell into your son's hands or  afterward? And if afterward, who took them? Who had the chance? Donovan  seems to think he has a clue, but I confess I have none.\"    \"Hadn't you looked over the bonds and stuff since you took them home?\"    \"No,\" Mr. Ackerman admitted. \"I got them from the broker yesterday and  as it was too late to put them into the safe-deposit vault, I took them  home with me instead of putting them in our office safe as I should have  done. I thought it would be easier for me to stop at the bank with them  this morning on my way to business.

The eldest became expert in the craft of the  forest, and he was very successful in procuring food. He was noted for  his skill in killing buffalo, elk, and moose; and he instructed his  brothers, so that each should become a master over a particular animal  which was assigned to him.    After they had become able to hunt and to take care of themselves, the  elder proposed to leave them and to go in search of the world, promising  to return as soon as he could procure them wives. In this intention he  was overruled by his brothers, who said that they could not part with  him.    Jeekewis, the second, was loud in disapproval of the scheme, saying:  \"What will you do with those you propose to get? We have lived so long  by ourselves, we can still do without them.\" This counsel prevailed, and  for a time the three brothers continued together.    One day they agreed to kill each a male of that kind of animal, which  each was most expert in hunting, for the purpose of making quivers from  their skins. When these quivers were prepared, they were straightway  filled, with arrows; for they all had a presentiment that something was  about to happen which called upon them to be ready.    Soon after they hunted on a wager to see who should come in first with  game, and have the privilege of acting as entertainer to the others.  They were to shoot no other beast or bird than such as each was in the  habit of killing.    They set out on different paths. Maidwa, the youngest, had not gone far  before he saw a bear, an animal he was not to kill, by the agreement.  He, however, followed him closely, and driving an arrow through and  through him, he brought him to the ground.    Although contrary to the engagement with his brothers, Maidwa commenced  skinning him, when suddenly something red tinged the air all around him.  He rubbed his eyes, thinking he was perhaps deceived; but rub as hard as  he would, the red hue still crimsoned the air, and tinged every object  that he looked on--the tree-tops, the river that flowed, and the deer  that glided away along the edge of the forest--with its delicate  splendor.    As he stood musing on this fairy spectacle, a strange noise came to his  ear from a distance. At first it seemed like a human voice. After  following the sound he reached the shore of a lake. Floating at a  distance upon its waters sat a most beautiful Red Swan, whose plumage  glittered in the sun, and when it lifted up its neck, it uttered the  peculiar tone he had heard. He was within long bow-shot, and, drawing  the arrow to his ear, he took a careful aim and discharged the shaft. It  took no effect. The beautiful bird sat proudly on the water, still  pouring forth its peculiar chant, and still spreading the radiance of  its plumage far and wide, and lighting up the whole world, beneath the  eye of Maidwa, with its ruby splendors.    He shot again and again, till his quiver was empty, for he longed to  possess so glorious a creature. Still the swan did not spread its wings  to fly, but, circling round and round, stretched its long neck and  dipped its bill into the water, as if indifferent to mortal shafts.    Maidwa ran home, and bringing all the arrows in the lodge, shot them  away. He then stood with his bow dropped at his side, lost in wonder,  gazing at the beautiful bird.    While standing thus, with a heart beating more and more eagerly every  moment for the possession of this fair swan, Maidwa remembered the  saying of his elder brother, that in their deceased father's  medicine-sack were three magic arrows; but his brother had not told  Maidwa that their father, on his death-bed, which he alone had attended,  had especially bequeathed the arrows to his youngest son, Maidwa, from  whom they had been wrongfully kept. The thought of the magic arrows put  heart in Maidwa, and he hastened with all speed to secure them.    At any other time he would have shrunk from opening his father's  medicine-sack, but something prompted him to believe that there was no  wrong now, and snatching them forth he ran back, not staying to restore  the other contents to the sack, but leaving them scattered, here and  there, about the lodge.    He feared, as he returned, that the swan must by this time have taken  wing; but, as he emerged from the wood, to his great delight the air was  as rosy as ever, and there, in her own serene and beautiful way, still  sat the glorious Red Swan.    With trembling hand he shot the first of his magic shafts: it grazed a  wing. The second came closer, and cut away a few of the bright red  feathers, which fluttered and fell like flakes of fire in the water. The  third, which he carefully aimed and drew home upon the string with all  his force, made the lucky hit, and passed through the neck of the bird a  little above the breast.    \"The bird is mine,\" said Maidwa, to himself; but to his great surprise,  instead of seeing it droop its neck and drift to the shore, the Red Swan  flapped its wings, rose slowly, and flew off with a majestic motion  toward the falling sun.    Maidwa, that he might meet his brothers, rescued two of the magic arrows  from the water; and although the third was borne off, he had a hope yet  to recover that too, and to be master of the swan. He was noted for his  speed; for he would shoot an arrow and then run so fast that the arrow  always fell behind him; and he now set off at his best speed of foot. \"I  can run fast,\" he thought, \"and I can get up with the swan some time or  other.\"    He sped on, over hills and prairies, toward the west, and was only  going to take one more run, and then seek a place to sleep for the  night, when, suddenly, he heard noises at a distance, like the murmur of  waters against the shore; as he went on, he heard voices, and presently  he saw people, some of whom were busy felling trees, and the strokes of  their labor echoed through the woods. He passed on, and when he emerged  from the forest, the sun was just falling below the edge of the sky.    He was bent on success in pursuit of the swan, whose red track he marked  well far westward till she was lost to sight. Meanwhile he would tarry  for the night and procure something to eat, as he had fasted since he  had left home.    At a distance, on a rising ground, he could see the lodges of a large  village. He went toward it, and soon heard the watchman, who was set on  a height to overlook the place, and give notice of the approach of  friends or foes, crying out, \"We are visited;\" and a loud halloo  indicated that they had all heard it.    When Maidwa advanced, the watchman pointed to the lodge of the chief.  \"It is there you must go in,\" he said, and left him.    \"Come in, come in,\" said the chief; \"take a seat there;\" pointing to the  side of the lodge where his daughter sat. \"It is there you must sit.\"    They gave him something to eat, and, being a stranger, very few  questions were put to him; it was only when he spoke that the others  answered him.    \"Daughter,\" said the chief, as soon as the night had set in, \"take our  son-in-law's moccasins and see if they be torn; if so, mend them for  him, and bring in his bundle.\"    Maidwa thought it strange that he should be so warmly received, and  married instantly against his own wishes, although he could not help  noticing that the chief's daughter was pretty.    It was some time before she would take the moccasins which he had laid  off. It displeased him to see her loth to do so; and when at last she  did reach them, he snatched them from her hand and hung them up himself.  He lay down and thought of the swan, and made up his mind to be off with  the dawn. He wakened early, and finding the chief's daughter looking  forth at the door, he spoke to her, but she gave no answer. He touched  her lightly.    \"What do you want?\" she said, and turned her face away from him.    \"Tell me,\" said Maidwa, \"what time the swan passed. I am following it;  come out, and point the way.\"    \"Do you think you can overtake it?\" she said.    \"Yes,\" he answered.    \"Naubesah--fool!\" retorted the chief's pretty daughter.    She, however, went out, and pointed in the direction he should go. The  young man paced slowly along till the sun arose, when he commenced  traveling at his accustomed speed. He passed the day in running, and  although he could not see anywhere on the horizon the Red Swan, he  thought that he discerned a faint red light far over in the west.    When night came, he was pleased to find himself near another village;  and when at a distance he heard the watchman crying out, \"We are  visited;\" and soon the men of the village stood out to see the stranger.    He was again told to enter the lodge of the chief, and his reception was  in every respect the same as on the previous night; except that the  young woman was more beautiful, and that she entertained him very  kindly. Although urged to stay with them, the mind of Maidwa was fixed  on the object of his journey.    Before daybreak he asked the young woman at what time the Red Swan  passed, and to point out the way. She marked against the sky with her  finger the course it had taken, and told him that it had passed  yesterday when the sun was between mid-day and its falling-place.    Maidwa again set out rather slowly, but when the sun had risen, he tried  his speed by shooting an arrow ahead, and running after it; but it fell  behind him, and he knew that he had lost nothing of his quickness of  foot.    Nothing remarkable happened through the day, and he went on leisurely.  Some time after dark, as he was peering around the country for a  shelter, he saw a light emitted from a small low lodge. He went up to it  very slyly, and, peeping through the door, he discovered an old man  alone, with his head down upon his breast, warming his back "]]]
