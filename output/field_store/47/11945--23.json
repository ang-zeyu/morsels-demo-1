The following characters may be compared with those of  the family preceding it:--    _Filamentous, threads free or only slightly felted, bearing vesicles,  which contain indefinite sporidia_ = PHYSOMYCETES.    [Illustration: FIG. 41.--_Mucor caninus._]    In the last family, the _Ascomycetes_, we shall meet with a very great  variety of forms, all agreeing in producing sporidia contained in  certain cells called asci, which are produced from the hymenium. In  some of these, the asci are evanescent, but in the greater number are  permanent. In _Onygenei_, the receptacle is either club-shaped or  somewhat globose, and the peridium is filled with branched threads,  which produce asci of a very evanescent character, leaving the  pulverulent sporidia to fill the central cavity. The species are all  small, and singular for their habit of affecting animal substances,  otherwise they are of little importance. The _Perisporiacei_, on the  other hand, are very destructive of vegetation, being produced, in the  majority of cases, on the green parts of growing plants. To this order  the hop mildew, rose mildew, and pea mildew belong. The mycelium is  often very much developed, and in the case of the maple, pea, hop, and  some others, it covers the parts attacked with a thick white coating,  so that from a distance the leaves appear to have been whitewashed.  Seated on the mycelium, at the first as little orange points, are the  perithecia, which enlarge and become nearly black. In some species,  very elegant whitish appendages radiate from the sides of the  perithecia, the variations in which aid in the discrimination of  species. The perithecia contain pear-shaped asci, which spring from  the base and enclose a definite number of sporidia.[R] The asci  themselves are soon dissolved. Simultaneously with the development of  sporidia, other reproductive bodies are produced direct from the  mycelium, and in some species as many as five different kinds of  reproductive bodies have been traced. The features to be remembered in  _Perisporiacei_, as forming the basis of their classification, are,  that the asci are saccate, springing from the base of the perithecia,  and are soon absorbed. Also that the perithecia themselves are not  perforated at the apex.    The four remaining orders, though large, can be easily characterized.  In _Tuberacei_, all the species are subterranean, and the hymenium is  mostly sinuated. In _Elvellacei_, the substance is more or less  fleshy, and the hymenium is exposed. In _Phacidiacei_, the substance  is hard or leathery, and the hymenium is soon exposed. And in  _Sphaeriacei_, although the substance is variable, the hymenium is  never exposed, being enclosed in perithecia with a distinct opening at  the apex, through which the mature spores escape. Each of these four  orders must be examined more in detail. The _Tuberacei_, or  subterranean _Ascomycetes_, are analogous to the _Hypogaei_ of the  _Gasteromycetes_. The truffle is a familiar and highly prized example.  There is a kind of outer peridium, and the interior consists of a  fleshy hymenium, more or less convoluted, sometimes sinuous and  confluent, so as to leave only minute elongated and irregular  cavities, and sometimes none at all, the two opposing faces of the  hymenium meeting and coalescing.[S] Certain privileged cells of the  hymenium swell, and ultimately become asci, enclosing a definite  number of sporidia. The sporidia in many cases are large, reticulated,  echinulate or verrucose, and mostly somewhat globose. In the genus  _Elaphomyces_, the asci are more than commonly diffluent.    The _Elvellacei_ are fleshy in substance, or somewhat waxy, sometimes  tremelloid. There is no peridium, but the hymenium is always exposed.  There is a great variety of forms, some being pileate, and others  cup-shaped, as there is also a great variation in size, from the  minute _Peziza_, small as a grain of sand, to the large _Helvella  gigas_, which equals in dimensions the head of a child. In the pileate  forms, the stroma is fleshy and highly developed; in the cup-shaped,  it is reduced to the external cells of the cup which enclose the  hymenium. The hymenium itself consists of elongated fertile cells, or  asci, mixed with linear thread-like barren cells, called paraphyses,  which are regarded by some authors as barren asci. These are placed  side by side in juxtaposition with the apex outwards. Each ascus  contains a definite number of sporidia, which are sometimes coloured.  When mature, the asci explode above, and the sporidia may be seen  escaping like a miniature cloud of smoke in the light of the mid-day  sun. The disc or surface of the hymenium is often brightly coloured in  the genus _Peziza_; tints of orange, red, and brown having the  predominance.    In _Phacidiacei_, the substance is hard and leathery, intermediate  between the fleshy _Elvellacei_ and the more horny of the _Sphaeriacei_.  The perithecia are either orbicular or elongated, and the hymenium soon  becomes exposed. In some instances, there is a close affinity with  the _Elvellacei_, the exposed hymenium being similar in structure,  but in all the disc is at first closed. In orbicular forms, the  fissure takes place in a stellate manner from the centre, and the  teeth are reflexed. In the _Hysteriacei_, where the perithecia are  elongated, the fissure takes place throughout their length. As a  rule, the sporidia are more elongated, more commonly septate, and more  usually coloured, than in _Elvellacei_. Only a few solitary instances  occur of individual species that are parasitic on living plants.    [Illustration: FIG. 42.--_Sphaeria aquila._]    In the _Sphaeriacei_, the substance of the stroma (when present) and of  the perithecia is variable, being between fleshy and waxy in  _Nectriei_, and tough, horny, sometimes brittle, in _Hypoxylon_. A  perithecium, or cell excavated in the stroma which fulfils the  functions of a perithecium, is always present. The hymenium lines the  inner walls of the perithecium, and forms a gelatinous nucleus,  consisting of asci and paraphyses. When fully mature, the asci are  ruptured and the sporidia escape by a pore which occupies the apex of  the perithecium. Sometimes the perithecia are solitary or scattered,  and sometimes gregarious, whilst in other instances they are closely  aggregated and immersed in a stroma of variable size and form.  Conidia, spermatia, pycnidia, &c., have been traced to and associated  with some species, but the history of others is still obscure. Many of  the coniomycetous forms grouped under the _Sphaeronemei_ are probably  conditions of the _Sphaeriacei_, as are also the _Melanconiei_, and  some of the _Hyphomycetes_. A very common fungus, for instance, which  is abundant on sticks and twigs, forming rosy or reddish pustules the  size of a millet seed, formerly named _Tubercularia vulgaris_, is  known to be the conidia-bearing stroma of the sphaeriaceous fungus,  _Nectria cinnabarina_;[T] and so with many others. The following are  the technical characters of the family:--    _Fruit consisting of sporidia, mostly definite, contained in asci,  springing from a naked or enclosed stratum of fructifying cells and  forming a hymenium or nucleus_ = ASCOMYCETES.    If the characters of the different families are borne in mind, there  will be but little difficulty in assigning any fungus to the order to  which it belongs by means of the foregoing remarks. For more minute  information, and for analytical tables of the families, orders, and  genera, we must refer the student to some special systematic work,  which will present fewer difficulties, if he keeps in mind the  distinctive features of the families.[U]    To assist in this we have given on the following page an analytical  arrangement of the families and orders, according to the system  recognized and adopted in the present volume.

We lost no time, but got the food out and started with it in the  night. On reaching Guantanamo we were met some distance out, called to,  and asked if any one on our ship had been on shore at Siboney within  four days; if so, our supplies could not be received. We took them away,  leaving the starving to perish.    The constantly recurring news of the surrender of Santiago was so well  established that we drew anchor, came up to the flag-ship, and sent the  following letter to Admiral Sampson:      \"State of Texas,    \"_July 16, 1898_.    \"ADMIRAL SAMPSON, Commanding U. S. Fleet off  Santiago, Flag-Ship New York.    \"Admiral: It is not necessary for me to explain to you my errand, nor  its necessity; both your good head and heart divine it more clearly  than any words of mine can represent.    \"I send this to you by one of our men who can tell all you wish to know.  Mr. John Elwell has resided and done mercantile and shipping business in  Santiago for the last seven years; is favorably known to all its people;  has in his possession the keys of the best warehouses and residences in  the city, to which he is given welcome by the owners. He is the person  appointed four months ago to help distribute this food, and did so with  me until the blockade. There seems to be nothing in the way of getting  our twelve hundred tons of food into a Santiago warehouse and giving it  intelligently to the thousands who _need_ and _own_ it. I have twenty  good helpers with me. The New York committee is urging the discharge of  the State of Texas, which has been raised in price to four hundred  dollars a day.    \"If there is still more explanation needed, I pray you, Admiral, let me  see you.    \"Respectfuly and cordially,    \"CLARA BARTON.\"      These were anxious days. While the world outside was making up war  history, we thought of little beyond the terrible needs about us; if  Santiago had any people left, they must be in sore distress; and El  Caney, with its thirty thousand homeless, perishing sufferers, how could  they be reached?    On that Sunday morning, never to be forgotten, the Spanish fleet came  out of Santiago Harbor, to meet death and capture. That afternoon  Lieutenant Capehart, of the flag-ship, came on board with the courteous  reply of Admiral Sampson, that if we would come alongside the New York  he would put a pilot on board. This was done, and we moved on through  waters we had never traversed; past Morro Castle, long, low, silent, and  grim; past the wrecks of the Spanish ships on the right; past the  Merrimac in the channel. We began to realize that we were alone, of all  the ships about the harbor there were none with us. The stillness of the  Sabbath was over all. The gulls sailed and flapped and dipped about us.  The lowering summer sun shot long golden rays athwart the green hills on  either side and tinged the water calm and still. The silence grew  oppressive as we glided along with scarce a ripple. We saw on the right  as the only moving thing, a long, slim yacht dart out from among the  bushes and steal its way up half-hidden in the shadows. Suddenly it was  overtaken by either message or messenger, and like a collared hound  glided back as if it had never been.    Leaning on the rail, half lost in reverie over the strange, quiet beauty  of the scene, the thought suddenly burst upon me--are we really going  into Santiago, and alone? Are we not to be run out, and wait aside, and  salute with dipping colors, while the great battle-ships come up with  music and banners and lead the way?    As far as the eye could reach no ship was in sight. Was this to remain  so? Could it be possible that the commander who had captured a city  declined to be the first to enter, that he would hold back his flag-ship  and himself, and send forward and first a cargo of food on a plain ship,  under direction of a woman? Did our commands, military or naval, hold  men great enough of soul for such action? It must be true, for the  spires of Santiago rise before us, and turning to the score of  companions beside me I ask: \"Is there any one here who will lead the  Doxology?\" In an instant the full rich voice of Enola Gardner rang out:  \"Praise God from whom all blessings flow.\" By that time the chorus was  full, and the tears on many a face told more plainly than words how  genuine was that praise, and when in response to a second suggestion \"My  Country 'Tis of Thee\" swelled out on the evening air in the farewell  rays of the setting sun, the State of Texas was nearing the dock, and  quietly dropping her anchor she lay there through the silence of the  night in undisputed possession, facing a bare wind-swept wharf and the  deserted city of Santiago.    Daybreak brought quiet to an end. The silence was no longer oppressive.  A hundred and twenty stevedores lined up on the wharf for work and  breakfast. The dock had tracks, and trucks running to its open  warehouses. Boxes, barrels, and bales, pitched out of that ship, thrown  onto the trucks and wheeled away, told the story of better days to come.  It was something to see the lank, brawny little army of stevedores take  their first breakfast in line, alongside of the ship.    Later in the day the flag-ship brought Admiral Sampson and Admiral  Schley, who spent several hours with us. They had every opportunity to  see how our work was done, and if we were equal to unloading our ship.  When they were about to leave Admiral Sampson was asked what orders or  directions he had for us. He replied: \"You need no directions from me,  but if any one troubles you let me know.\"    The amiable pleasantries of these two gallant officers during that visit  are a pleasure to recall. As I was, at an opportune moment, attempting  to express my appreciation and thanks to Admiral Sampson for the  courtesy of allowing us to precede him into Santiago, Admiral Schley,  with that _naivete_ and apt turn of expression so characteristic of him,  in a half undertone side-remark, cautioned me with \"Don't give him too  much credit, Miss Barton; he was not quite sure how clear the channel  might be. Remember that was a trial trip.\"    How sadly the recollection of that pleasant, memorable day has since  recurred to me; brave, gallant brothers in arms, and in heart; knowing  only a soldier's duty; each holding his country's honor first, his own  last; its glory his glory, and for himself seeking nothing more. Ah,  people, press, and politics! How deal ye with your servants?    A message was received from General Shafter, who telegraphed from his  headquarters; \"The death rate at El Caney is terrible; can you send  food?\" The answer was to send the thirty thousand refugees of El Caney  at once back to Santiago; we were there and could feed them; that the  State of Texas had still twelve hundred tons of supplies.    The thirty thousand inhabitants of Santiago had been driven to El Caney,  a village designed for five hundred. In two days all were called back  and fed, ten thousand the first day, twenty thousand the second. Then  came our troops, and Santiago was lived and is remembered. Its  hospitals, the ante-chamber to Montauk, are never to be forgotten.    A general committee was formed, the city districted into sections, with  a commissioner for each district, selected by the people themselves  living there. Every family or person residing within the city was  supplied by the commissioner of that district, and all transient  persons were fed at the kitchens, the food being provided by the Red  Cross.    The discharge of the cargo of the State of Texas commenced at six  o'clock Monday morning, July 18th. One hundred and twenty-five  stevedores were employed and paid in food issued as rations. Four days  later the discharge was completed.    Although the army had entered the city during the latter part of that  time, there had been no confusion, no groups of disorderly persons seen,  no hunger in the city more than in ordinary times. We had done all that  could be done to advantage at that time in Santiago. The United States  troops had mainly left. The Spanish soldiers were coming in to their  waiting ships, bringing with them all the diseases that unprovided and  uncleanly camps would be expected to hold in store. Five weeks before we  had brought into Santiago all the cargo of the State of Texas excepting  the hospital supplies, which had been used the month previous among our  own troops at Siboney, General Shafter's front, and El Caney during the  days of fighting.    These were the last days of General Shafter in Santiago, who was, as he  had at all times been, the kind and courteous officer and gentleman.  General Wood, who was made Governor of the Province of Santiago upon the  day of surrender--alert, wise, and untiring, with an eye single to the  good of all--toiled day and night.    The State of Texas steamed away to its northern home. Peace and plenty  came. The reconcentrados we went in search of were never reached. To  those who could not withstand, Heaven came. To those who could, _Cuba  Libre_.    Later on, general efforts were made for the protection of the thousands  of orphans over the island, in which efforts the Red Cross joined. But  the people of Cuba solved the question themselves--by a general adoption  in their own homes--and orphanages in Cuba became a thing of the past.    Thus our work on that distressful field closed, after nearly two years  of such effort as one would never desire to repeat. The financial  management of that field, so far as the Red Cross was concerned, was  done under the attorneyship of the Central Cuban Relief Committee of New  York, whose reports are models of accuracy and accountability, and to  which any person desiring information may be referred.    Cuba was a hard field, full of heart-breaking memories. It gave the  first opportunity to test"]]]
