This news was obtained by the allied  flying corps, which had made daring flights over the enemy's line.          CHAPTER XII    THE MARNE--GENERAL PLAN OF BATTLE FIELD      On September 4, 1914, the bugler of Destiny sounded the \"Halt!\" to the  retreat of the armies of the Allies from the Belgian frontier. The  marvelous fighting machine of the German armies, perhaps the most superb  organization of military potency that has been conceived by the mind of  man, seemed to reach its limit of range. Success had perched upon the  German eagles, and for two weeks there had been a steady succession of  victories. Nevertheless the British and French armies were not crushed.  They were overwhelmed, they were overpowered, and, under stern military  necessity, they were forced to fall back.    Day after day, under the swinging hammer-head blows of the German drive,  the flower of the forces of the Allies had been compelled to break. A  little less generalship on the part of the defenders, or a little more  recklessness behind that smashing offensive might have turned this  retirement into a rout. Even as it was, the official dispatches reveal  that, while occasional and local retirements had been considered, such a  sweeping retreat was far from contemplated by Generals Joffre and  French. German official dispatches bear testimony to the intrepid  character of the defenders sullenly falling back and contesting every  inch of the way, as much as they do to the daring and the vivid bravery  of the German attackers who hurled themselves steadily, day after day,  upon positions hastily taken up in the retreat where the retirement  could be partly repaid by the heaviest toll of death.    The great strategical plan of the Germans, which had displayed itself  throughout the entire operations on the western theatre of war from the  very first gun of the campaign, came to its apex on this September 3,  1914. If the allied armies could develop a strong enough defense to halt  the German offensive at this point, and especially if they could develop  a sufficiently powerful counteroffensive to strike doubt into the  confident expectations of the armies of the Central Powers, then the  strategical plan had reached a check, which might or might not be a  checkmate, as the fortunes of war might determine. If, on the other  hand, the stand made by the Allies at this point should prove  ineffective, and if the counteroffensive should reveal that the German  hosts had been able to establish impregnable defenses as they marched,  then the original strategic plan of the attackers must be considered as  intact and the peril of France would become greatly intensified.    It is idle, in a war of such astounding magnitude, to speak about any  one single incident as being a \"decisive\" one. Such a term can only  rightly be applied to conditions where the opposing powers each have but  one organized army in the field, and these armies meet in a pitched  battle. None the less, the several actions which are known as the  Battles of the Marne may be considered as decisive, to the extent that  they decided the limit of the German offensive at that point. The German  General Staff, taking the ordinary and obvious precautions in the case  of a possible repulse, chose and fortified in the German rear positions  to which its forces might fall back in the event of retreat. These  prepared positions had a secondary contingent value for the Germans in  view of the grave Russian menace that might call at any moment for a  transfer of German troops from the western to the eastern front.    The Battle of the Marne stopped the advance of the main German army on  that line, forcing it back.    [Illustration: Battle of the Marne--Beginning on September 5, 1914.]    The scene of the battle ground is one of the most famous in Europe, not  even the plains of Belgium possessing a richer historical significance  than that melancholy plain, the Champagne-Pouilleuse, upon whose  inhospitable flats rested for centuries the curse of a prophecy, that  there would the fate of France be decided, a prophecy of rare  connotation of accuracy, for it refrained from stating what that fate  should be. Yet the historic sense is amplified even more by remembrance  than by prophecy, for in the territory confronting that huge arc on  which 1,400,000 German and Austrian soldiers lay encamped, awaiting what  even the German generals declared to be \"the great decision,\" there  lies, on the old Roman road running from Chalons a vast oval mound,  known to tradition as \"the Camp of Attila.\" In that country, a Roman  general, Aetius, leading a host of soldiers of whom many were Gauls,  broke a vast flood wave of the Huns as those savage Mongol hordes hurled  themselves against Rome's westernmost possession. On that occasion,  however, the Visigoths, under their King Theodoric, fought side by side  with the Gauls. Then, the dwellers on the banks of the Rhine and on the  banks of the Seine were brothers in arms, now, that same countryside  shall see them locked in deadly conflict.    The morale of tradition is a curious thing, and often will nerve a sword  arm when the most impassioned utterance of a beloved leader may fail.  There were few among the soldiers of France who forgot that in the south  of this same plain of Champagne-Pouilleuse was the home of Joan of Arc,  the Maid of Orleans, patriot and saint, and more than one French soldier  prayed that the same voices which had whispered in the ear of the virgin  of Domremy should guide the generalissimo who was to lead the armies of  France upon the morrow. Here, tradition again found old alliances  severed and new ones formed, for the Maid of Orleans led the French  against the English, while in the serried ranks awaiting the awful test  of the shock of battle, English and French soldiers lived and slept as  brothers.    The topography of the region of the battle field is of more than common  interest, for modern tactics deal with vaster stretches of country than  would have been considered in any previous war. This is due, partly, to  the large armies handled, partly to the terrific range of modern  artillery, and also to what may be called the territorial perceptiveness  which aeronautical surveys make possible to a general of to-day. While  war has not changed, it is true that a commander of an army in modern  campaign is compelled to review and to take into account a far larger  group of factors. A modern general must be capable of grasping increased  complexities, and must possess a synthetic mind to be able to reduce all  these complicating factors into a single whole. The first factor of the  battles of the Marne was the topographical factor, the consideration of  the land over which the action was to take place.    Let the River Marne be used as a base from which this topography can be  determined. The Marne rises near Langres, which is the northwest angle  of that pentagon of fortresses (Belfort, Epinal, Langres, Dijon, and  Besancon), which incloses an almost impregnable recuperative ground for  exhausted armies. From Langres the Marne flows almost north by west for  about fifty miles through a hilly and wooded country, then, taking a  more westerly course, it flows for approximately seventy-five miles  almost northwest, across the Plain of Champagne, past Vitry-le-Francois  and Chalons, thence almost due westward through the Plateau of Sezanne,  by Epernay, Chateau Thierry, La Ferte-sous-Jouarre, and Meaux to join  the Seine just south of Paris. In the neighborhood of Meaux, three small  tributaries flow into the Marne--the Ourcq from the north, and the Grand  Morin and Petit Morin from the east. The Marshes of St. Gond, ten miles  long from east to west and a couple of miles across, lie toward the  eastern borders of the Plateau of Sezanne, and form the source of the  Petit Morin, which has been deepened in the reclamation of the marsh  country.    Once more considering the source of the Marne, near Langres, it will be  noted that the River Meuse rises near by, flowing north by east to Toul,  and then north-northwest past Verdun to Sedan, where it turns due north,  flowing through the Ardennes country to Namur, in Belgium. To the east  of the Meuse lies the difficult forest clad hill barrier, known as the  Hills of the Meuse; to the east extends (as far as Triaucourt) the  craggy and broken wooded country of the Argonne, a natural barrier which  stretches southward in a chain of lakes and forests.    West of this impassible country of the Meuse and the Argonne lies the  plain of Champagne-Pouilleuse, which is almost a steppe, bare and open,  only slightly undulating, overgrown with heath, and studded here and  there by small copses of planted firs, naught but a small portion of the  whole being under cultivation. Between the Forest of the Argonne and  this great plain, which is over a hundred miles long from north to south  and forty miles in width, lies a short stretch of miniature foothills,  with upland meadows here and there, but crossed in every direction by  small ravines filled with shrubs and low second-growth timber. Here lies  the source of the Aisne, a river destined to live in history; and on the  farther side begins the great plain.    On the west of the plain of Champagne rises, 300 feet, with a curious  clifflike suddenness, the Plateau of Sezanne. The effect is as though a  geological fault had driven the original plateau from north to south  throughout its entire length, and then as though there had been a  general subsidence of the plain, giving rise to the clifflike formations  known as Les Falaises de Champagne, at the foot of which runs the road  from La Fere-Champenoise to Rheims.    The disposition and arrangement of the German forces is next to be  considered. It can be assumed that their objective was Paris.

He uncurled  himself on the litter of withered grass-bents that formed his winter  couch, crept towards the nearest bolt-hole of his burrow, and peeped at  the fleecy clouds as they wandered idly overhead. He inhaled long, deep  breaths of the fresh, warm air; then, conscious of new, increasing  strength, he continued his way underground to the granary in which, some  months ago, his mother had stored the columbine seeds. But the earth had  been scratched away from the storehouse door, and nothing remained of  the winter supplies. Hungry and thirsty, yet not daring to roam abroad  while the sun was high, the vole moved from chamber to chamber of his  burrow, washed himself thoroughly from the tip of his nose to the tip of  his tail, then, feeling lonely, awakened his parents from their heavy  sleep, and spent the afternoon thinking and dreaming, till the sun sank  low in the glory of the aureolin sky, and the robin's vesper trilled  wistfully from the hawthorns on the fringe of the shadowed wood.  Becoming venturesome with the near approach of night, but still  remembering the danger that had threatened him before the last period of  his winter sleep, he lifted himself warily above the ground, and for a  little while stayed near the mound of earth beside the door of his  burrow. Cramped from long disuse, every muscle in his body seemed in  need of vigorous exertion, while with each succeeding breath of the cool  twilight air his hunger and thirst increased.    Determined to find food and water, Kweek started towards the copse. No  beaten pathway guided his footsteps; wind and rain, frost and thaw, and  the new, slow growth of the grass, had obliterated every trail. But by  following the scent of the parent voles that had already stolen into  the wood, he reached in safety the banks of the rill. Having quenched  his thirst, he scratched the soft soil from beneath a stone and  satisfied his hunger with some succulent sprouts of herbage there  exposed to sight. Soon, tired from his unwonted exertion, and feeling  great pain through having torn the pads of his feet--which, like those  of all hibernating animals, had become extremely tender from want of  exercise--he crept home to his burrow, and rested till the soreness had  gone from his limbs, and he felt active and hungry again.    For the vole, guided as he was by his appetite, the most wholesome  vegetable food was a ripe, well-flavoured seed. It contained all that  the plant could give; leaf and stalk were tasteless compared with it,  and were accepted only as a change of diet, or as a medicine, or as a  last resource. Next to a seed, he loved a tender root, or a stem that  had not yet thrust itself through the soil, and was therefore crisp and  dainty to the taste. But the vole did not subsist entirely on vegetable  food. Occasionally, when the nights were warm, he surprised some little  insect hiding in the moss, and pounced on his prey almost as greedily  as the trout in the stream below the hill rose to a passing fly. And  just as the cattle in the distant farm throve on grain and oil-cake, and  the pheasant in the copse near by on wood-ants' \"eggs,\" and the trout in  the Cerdyn brook on ephemerals hatched at the margin of the pool, so  Kweek, the field-vole, abroad in the nights of summer, grew sleek and  well conditioned on good supplies of seeds and grubs. But now, worn out  by long privation, he was tired and weak.    Gradually, from the bed of winter death, from the rotting leaf-mould and  the cold, damp earth, the fresh, bright forms of spring arose. The  purple and crimson trails of the periwinkle lengthened over the stones;  then the spear-shaped buds, prompted by the flow of pulsing sap, lifted  themselves above the glossy leaves and burst into flowers. The dandelion  and the celandine peeped from the grass; the primrose garlanded each  sunny mound on the margin of the wood; and the willow catkins, clothed  with silver and pearly grey, waved in the moist, warm breeze as it  wandered by the brook. The queen-ant, aroused by the increasing warmth,  carried her offspring from the deep recess where, in her tunnelled nest,  she had brooded over them while the north-east wind blew through the  leafless boughs, and laid them side by side in a roomy chamber  immediately beneath the stone that screened the spot to which, in the  autumn dusk, the father vole resorted that he might watch and wait  before the darkness deepened on the fields and woods. The bees from the  hives in the farm garden, and innumerable flies from their winter  retreats in the hedgerows, came eagerly to the golden blossoms of the  furze near the bank-voles' colony. The bees alighted with care on the  lower petals of the flowers, and thence climbed quickly to the hidden  sweets; but the flies, heedless adventurers, dropped haphazard among the  sprays, and were content to filch the specks of pollen dust and the tiny  drops of nectar scattered by the honey-bees. A spirit of restlessness,  of strife, of strange, unsatisfied desire, possessed all Nature's  children; it raised the primrose from amid the deep-veined leaves  close-pressed on the carpet of the grass, it tuned the carols of the  robin and the thrush, it caused the wild jack-hare to roam by daylight  along paths which hitherto he had not followed save by night. Kweek felt  the subtle influence; long before dark he would venture from his home,  steal through the \"creeps,\" which had now become evident because of  frequent \"traffic,\" and visit the distant colonies of his kindred beyond  the wood.    Of the flourishing community living in the burrow before the weasels'  raid none survived but Kweek and his parents. One night, however, the  father vole, while foraging near the hedgerow, was snapped up and eaten  by the big brown owl from the beech-wood across the valley. In the  woodlands the greatest expert on the ways of voles was the brown owl.  His noiseless wings never gave the slightest alarm, and never interfered  with his sense of hearing--so acute that the faint rustle of a leaf or a  grass-blade brought him, like a bolt, from the sky, to hover close to  the earth, eager, inquisitive, merciless, till a movement on the part  of his quarry sealed its doom.    The mother vole, feeling lonely and more than ever afraid, wandered far  away, and found another mate in a sleek, bright-eyed little creature  inhabiting a roomy chamber excavated in the loose soil around a heap of  stones on the crest of the hill. Kweek, nevertheless, remained faithful  to the place of his birth. Though most of his time was spent near the  colony beyond the wood, he invariably returned to sleep on the shapeless  litter which was all that now remained of the neat, round nest in which  he had been nursed.    Kweek's frequent visits to his kindred beyond the wood led to numerous  adventures. Every member of the colony seemed suddenly to have turned to  the consideration of household affairs, and a lively widow-vole flirted  so outrageously with bachelor Kweek that, having at last fallen a victim  to her persistent attentions, he was never happy save in her company.  Unfortunately a big ruffian mouse also succumbed to the widow's wiles,  and Kweek found himself awkwardly placed. He fought long and stubbornly  against his rival, but, unequally matched and sorely scratched and  bitten, was at last forced to rustle away in the direction of his burrow  as quickly as his little feet could carry him. He slept off the effects  of his exhaustion and the loss of a little blood and fur, then returned,  stealthily, to his well-known trysting place, but found, alas! that his  fickle lady-love had already regarded with favour the charms of the  enemy. Kweek caught a glimpse of her as she carried wisps of withered  grass to a hole in the middle of the burrow, and at once recognised that  his first fond passion had hopelessly ended.    Fortune continued to treat him unkindly: that night, while returning  homewards, he was almost frightened out of his wits by the shrieks of  some little creature captured by the cruel owl, and, immediately  afterwards, a rabbit, alarmed by the same ominous sounds and bolting to  her warren in the wood, knocked him topsy-turvy as he crouched in hiding  among the leaves. These adventures taught him salutary lessons, and  henceforth the confidence of youth gave place to extreme caution; he  avoided the risk of lying near a rabbit's \"creep,\" and was quick to  discern the slightest sign, such as a shadowy form above the moonlit  field, which might indicate the approach of the slow-winged tyrant of  the night.    Among animals living in communities it is a frequent custom for a young  male, if badly beaten in his first love episode by a rival, to elope  with a new spouse, and seek a home at some distance from the scene of  his defeat. Kweek suffered exceedingly from his disappointment; it was a  shock to him that he should be bullied and hustled at the very time when  his passion was strongest and every prospect in his little life seemed  fair and bright.    For a time he dared not match himself against another of the older  voles. But in an unimportant squabble with a mouse of his own age, he  soon proved the victor, and, finding his reward in the favour of a young  she-vole that had watched the quarrel from behind a grass-tuft, ran off  with her at midnight to his old, deserted burrow in the pasture. After  thoroughly examining the various galleries in the underground  labyrinth, the fastidious little pair dug out a clean, fresh chamber at  right angles to the main tunnel, and, contented, began in earnest the  duties of the year.    April came; and often, as he sat by his door, Kweek watched the gentle  showers sweep by in tall"]]]
