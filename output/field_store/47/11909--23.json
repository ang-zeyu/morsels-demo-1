But  that would be only giving one more proof of our heartlessness; and,  besides, unless a man is downright angry he can scarcely feel that he  has really cleared himself when he has done nothing more than to point  the finger and say, You're another. However, I am not set for the  defence of ornithologists. They are abundantly able to take care of  themselves without the help of any outsider. I only declare that, even  to my unprofessional eye, this rule of theirs seems wise and necessary.  They know, if their critics do not, how easy it is to be deceived; how  many times things have been seen and minutely described, which, as was  afterwards established, could not by any possibility have been visible.  Moreover, regret it as we may, it is clear that in this world nobody can  escape giving and taking more or less pain. We of the sterner sex are  accustomed to think that even our blue-eyed censors are not entirely  innocent in this regard; albeit, for myself, I am bound to believe that  generally they are not to blame for the tortures they inflict upon us.    Granting the righteousness of the scientist's caution, however, we may  still find a less rigorous code sufficient for our own non-scientific,  though I hope not unscientific, purpose. For it is certain that no great  enjoyment of bird study is possible for some of us, if we are never to  be allowed to call our gentle friends by name until in every case we  have gone through the formality of a _post-mortem_ examination.  Practically, and for every-day ends, we may know a robin, or a redstart,  or even a hermit thrush, when we see him, without first turning the bird  into a specimen.    Probably there are none of our birds which afford more surprise and  pleasure to a novice than the family of warblers. A well-known  ornithologist has related how one day he wandered into the forest in an  idle mood, and accidentally catching a gleam of bright color overhead,  raised his gun and brought the bird to his feet; and how excited and  charmed he was with the wondrous beauty of his little trophy. Were there  other birds in the woods as lovely as this? He would see for himself.  And that was the beginning of what bids fair to prove a life-long  enthusiasm.    Thirty-eight warblers are credited to New England; but it would be safe  to say that not more than three of them are known to the average  New-Englander. How should he know them, indeed? They do not come about  the flower-garden like the humming-bird, nor about the lawn like the  robin; neither can they be hunted with a dog like the grouse and the  woodcock. Hence, for all their gorgeous apparel, they are mainly left to  students and collectors. Of our common species the most beautiful are,  perhaps, the blue yellow-back, the blue golden-wing, the Blackburnian,  the black-and-yellow, the Canada flycatcher, and the redstart; with the  yellow-rump, the black-throated green, the prairie warbler, the summer  yellow-bird, and the Maryland yellow-throat coming not far behind. But  all of them are beautiful, and they possess, besides, the charm of great  diversity of plumage and habits; while some of them have the further  merit, by no means inconsiderable, of being rare.    It was a bright day for me when the blue golden-winged warbler settled  in my neighborhood. On my morning walk I detected a new song, and,  following it up, found a new bird,--a result which is far from being a  thing of course. The spring migration was at its height, and at first I  expected to have the pleasure of my new friend's society for only a day  or two; so I made the most of it. But it turned out that he and his  companion had come to spend the summer, and before very long I  discovered their nest. This was still unfinished when I came upon it;  but I knew pretty well whose it was, having several times noticed the  birds about the spot, and a few days afterwards the female bravely sat  still, while I bent over her, admiring her courage and her handsome  dress. I paid my respects to the little mother almost daily, but  jealously guarded her secret, sharing it only with a kind-hearted woman,  whom I took with me on one of my visits. But, alas! one day I called,  only to find the nest empty. Whether the villain who pillaged it  traveled on two legs, or on four, I never knew. Possibly he dropped out  of the air. But I wished him no good, whoever he was. Next year the  birds appeared again, and more than one pair of them; but no nest could  I find, though I often looked for it, and, as children say in their  games, was sometimes very warm.    Is there any lover of birds in whose mind certain birds and certain  places are not indissolubly joined? Most of us, I am sure, could go over  the list and name the exact spots where we first saw this one, where we  first heard that one sing, and where we found our first nest of the  other. There is a piece of swampy woodland in Jefferson, New Hampshire,  midway between the hotels and the railway station, which, for me, will  always be associated with the song of the winter wren. I had been making  an attempt to explore the wood, with a view to its botanical treasures,  but the mosquitoes had rallied with such spirit that I was glad to beat  a retreat to the road. Just then an unseen bird broke out into a song,  and by the time he had finished I was saying to myself, A winter wren!  Now, if I could only see him in the act, and so be sure of the  correctness of my guess! I worked to that end as cautiously as possible,  but all to no purpose; and finally I started abruptly toward the spot  whence the sound had come, expecting to see the bird fly. But apparently  there was no bird there, and I stood still, in a little perplexity.  Then, all at once, the wren appeared, hopping about among the dead  branches, within a few yards of my feet, and peering at the intruder  with evident curiosity; and the next moment he was joined by a hermit  thrush, equally inquisitive. Both were silent as dead men, but plainly  had no doubt whatever that they were in their own domain, and that it  belonged to the other party to move away. I presumed that the thrush, at  least, had a nest not far off, but after a little search (the mosquitoes  were still active) I concluded not to intrude further on his domestic  privacy. I had heard the wren's famous song, and it had not been  over-praised. But then came the inevitable second thought: had I really  heard it? True, the music possessed the wren characteristics, and a  winter wren was in the brush; but what proof had I that the bird and the  song belonged together? No; I must see him in the act of singing. But  this, I found, was more easily said than done. In Jefferson, in Gorham,  in the Franconia Notch, in short, wherever I went, there was no  difficulty about hearing the music, and little about seeing the wren;  but it was provoking that eye and ear could never be brought to bear  witness to the same bird. However, this difficulty was not insuperable,  and after it was once overcome I was in the habit of witnessing the  whole performance almost as often as I wished.    Of similar interest to me is a turn in an old Massachusetts road, over  which, boy and man, I have traveled hundreds of times; one of those  delightful back-roads, half road and half lane, where the grass grows  between the horse-track and the wheel-track, while bushes usurp what  ought to be the sidewalk. Here, one morning in the time when every day  was disclosing two or three new species for my delight, I stopped to  listen to some bird of quite unsuspected identity, who was calling and  singing and scolding in the Indian brier thicket, making, in truth, a  prodigious racket. I twisted and turned, and was not a little astonished  when at last I detected the author of all this outcry. From a study of  the manual I set him down as probably the white-eyed vireo,--a  conjecture which further investigation confirmed. This vireo is the very  prince of stump-speakers,--fluent, loud, and sarcastic,--and is well  called the politician, though it is a disappointment to learn that the  title was given him, not for his eloquence, but on account of his habit  of putting pieces of newspaper into his nest. While I stood peering into  the thicket, a man whom I knew came along the road, and caught me thus  disreputably employed. Without doubt he thought me a lazy  good-for-nothing; or possibly (being more charitable) he said to  himself, \"Poor fellow! he's losing his mind.\"    Take a gun on your shoulder, and go wandering about the woods all day  long, and you will be looked upon with respect, no matter though you  kill nothing bigger than a chipmunk; or stand by the hour at the end of  a fishing-pole, catching nothing but mosquito-bites, and your neighbors  will think no ill of you. But to be seen staring at a bird for five  minutes together, or picking roadside weeds!--well, it is fortunate  there are asylums for the crazy. Not unlikely the malady will grow upon  him; and who knows how soon he may become dangerous? Something must be  wrong about that to which we are unaccustomed. Blowing out the brains  of rabbits and squirrels is an innocent and delightful pastime, as  everybody knows; and the delectable excitement of pulling half-grown  fishes out of the pond to perish miserably on the bank, that, too, is a  recreation easily enough appreciated. But what shall be said of enjoying  birds without killing them, or of taking pleasure in plants, which, so  far as we know, cannot suffer even if we do kill them?    Of my many pleasant associations of birds with places, one of the  pleasantest is connected with the red-headed woodpecker. This showy bird  has for a good many years been very rare in Massachusetts; and  therefore, when, during the freshness of my ornithological researches, I  went to Washington"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28020"],[0,"History of Woman Suffrage, Volume I (#18)"],[1,"on woman's sphere. Ansel Bascom, who had been a member of  the Constitutional Convention recently held in Albany, spoke at length  on the property bill for married women, just passed the Legislature,  and the discussion on woman's rights in that Convention. Samuel  Tillman, a young student of law, read a series of the most  exasperating statutes for women, from English and American jurists,  all reflecting the _tender mercies_ of men toward their wives, in  taking care of their property and protecting them in their civil  rights.    The Declaration having been freely discussed by many present, was  re-read by Mrs. Stanton, and with some slight amendment adopted.                           DECLARATION OF SENTIMENTS.         When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one       portion of the family of man to assume among the people of the       earth a position different from that which they have hitherto       occupied, but one to which the laws of nature and of nature's God       entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind       requires that they should declare the causes that impel them to       such a course.         We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women       are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with       certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty,       and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights       governments are instituted, deriving their just powers from the       consent of the governed. Whenever any form of government becomes       destructive of these ends, it is the right of those who suffer       from it to refuse allegiance to it, and to insist upon the       institution of a new government, laying its foundation on such       principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them       shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.       Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established       should not be changed for light and transient causes; and       accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more       disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right       themselves by abolishing the forms to which they were accustomed.       But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing       invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under       absolute despotism, it is their duty to throw off such       government, and to provide new guards for their future security.       Such has been the patient sufferance of the women under this       government, and such is now the necessity which constrains them       to demand the equal station to which they are entitled.         The history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and       usurpations on the part of man toward woman, having in direct       object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over her. To       prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.         He has never permitted her to exercise her inalienable right to       the elective franchise.         He has compelled her to submit to laws, in the formation of which       she had no voice.         He has withheld from her rights which are given to the most       ignorant and degraded men--both natives and foreigners.         Having deprived her of this first right of a citizen, the       elective franchise, thereby leaving her without representation in       the halls of legislation, he has oppressed her on all sides.         He has made her, if married, in the eye of the law, civilly dead.         He has taken from her all right in property, even to the wages       she earns.         He has made her, morally, an irresponsible being, as she can       commit many crimes with impunity, provided they be done in the       presence of her husband. In the covenant of marriage, she is       compelled to promise obedience to her husband, he becoming, to       all intents and purposes, her master--the law giving him power to       deprive her of her liberty, and to administer chastisement.         He has so framed the laws of divorce, as to what shall be the       proper causes, and in case of separation, to whom the       guardianship of the children shall be given, as to be wholly       regardless of the happiness of women--the law, in all cases,       going upon a false supposition of the supremacy of man, and       giving all power into his hands.         After depriving her of all rights as a married woman, if single,       and the owner of property, he has taxed her to support a       government which recognizes her only when her property can be       made profitable to it.         He has monopolized nearly all the profitable employments, and       from those she is permitted to follow, she receives but a scanty       remuneration. He closes against her all the avenues to wealth and       distinction which he considers most honorable to himself. As a       teacher of theology, medicine, or law, she is not known.         He has denied her the facilities for obtaining a thorough       education, all colleges being closed against her.         He allows her in Church, as well as State, but a subordinate       position, claiming Apostolic authority for her exclusion from the       ministry, and, with some exceptions, from any public       participation in the affairs of the Church.         He has created a false public sentiment by giving to the world a       different code of morals for men and women, by which moral       delinquencies which exclude women from society, are not only       tolerated, but deemed of little account in man.         He has usurped the prerogative of Jehovah himself, claiming it as       his right to assign for her a sphere of action, when that belongs       to her conscience and to her God.         He has endeavored, in every way that he could, to destroy her       confidence in her own powers, to lessen her self-respect, and to       make her willing to lead a dependent and abject life.         Now, in view of this entire disfranchisement of one-half the       people of this country, their social and religious       degradation--in view of the unjust laws above mentioned, and       because women do feel themselves aggrieved, oppressed, and       fraudulently deprived of their most sacred rights, we insist that       they have immediate admission to all the rights and privileges       which belong to them as citizens of the United States.         In entering upon the great work before us, we anticipate no small       amount of misconception, misrepresentation, and ridicule; but we       shall use every instrumentality within our power to effect our       object. We shall employ agents, circulate tracts, petition the       State and National legislatures, and endeavor to enlist the       pulpit and the press in our behalf. We hope this Convention will       be followed by a series of Conventions embracing every part of       the country.    The following resolutions were discussed by Lucretia Mott, Thomas and  Mary Ann McClintock, Amy Post, Catharine A. F. Stebbins, and others,  and were adopted:         WHEREAS, The great precept of nature is conceded to be, that \"man       shall pursue his own true and substantial happiness.\" Blackstone       in his Commentaries remarks, that this law of Nature being       coeval with mankind, and dictated by God himself, is of course       superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over all the       globe, in all countries and at all times; no human laws are of       any validity if contrary to this, and such of them as are valid,       derive all their force, and all their validity, and all their       authority, mediately and immediately, from this original;       therefore.         _Resolved_, That such laws as conflict, in any way, with the true       and substantial happiness of woman, are contrary to the great       precept of nature and of no validity, for this is \"superior in       obligation to any other.\"         _Resolved_, That all laws which prevent woman from occupying such       a station in society as her conscience shall dictate, or which       place her in a position inferior to that of man, are contrary to       the great precept of nature, and therefore of no force or       authority.         _Resolved_, That woman is man's equal--was intended to be so by       the Creator, and the highest good of the race demands that she       should be recognized as such.         _Resolved_, That the women of this country ought to be       enlightened in regard to the laws under which they live, that       they may no longer publish their degradation by declaring       themselves satisfied with their present position, nor their       ignorance, by asserting that they have all the rights they want.         _Resolved_, That inasmuch as man, while claiming for himself       intellectual superiority, does accord to woman moral superiority,       it is pre-eminently his duty to encourage her to speak and teach,       as she has an opportunity, in all religious assemblies.         _Resolved_, That the same amount of virtue, delicacy, and       refinement of behavior that is required of woman in the social       state, should also be required of man, and the same       transgressions should be visited with equal severity on both man       and woman.         _Resolved_, That the objection of indelicacy and impropriety,       which is so often brought against woman when she addresses a       public audience, comes with a very ill-grace from those who       encourage, by their attendance, her appearance on the stage, in       the concert, or in feats of the circus.         _Resolved_, That woman has too long rested satisfied in the       circumscribed limits which corrupt customs and a perverted       application of the Scriptures have marked out for her, and that       it is time she should move"]]]
