In case of a tie the Senate  was to choose between the candidates and, if no one had a majority, the  Senate was to elect \"from the five highest on the list.\"    This method of voting would have given the large States a decided  advantage, of course, in that they would appoint the greater number  of electors, but it was not believed that this system would ordinarily  result in a majority of votes being cast for one man. Apparently no one  anticipated the formation of political parties which would concentrate  the votes upon one or another candidate. It was rather expected that  in the great majority of cases--\"nineteen times in twenty,\" one of the  delegates said--there would be several candidates and that the selection  from those candidates would fall to the Senate, in which all the States  were equally represented and the small States were in the majority. But  since the Senate shared so many powers with the executive, it seemed  better to transfer the right of \"eventual election\" to the House of  Representatives, where each State was still to have but one vote. Had  this scheme worked as the designers expected, the interests of large  States and small States would have been reconciled, since in effect the  large States would name the candidates and, \"nineteen times in twenty,\"  the small States would choose from among them.    Apparently the question of a third term was never considered by the  delegates in the Convention. The chief problem before them was  the method of election. If the President was to be chosen by the  legislature, he should not be eligible to reelection. On the other hand,  if there was to be some form of popular election, an opportunity for  reelection was thought to be a desirable incentive to good behavior. Six  or seven years was taken as an acceptable length for a single term and  four years a convenient tenure if reelection was permitted. It was upon  these considerations that the term of four years was eventually agreed  upon, with no restriction placed upon reelection.    When it was believed that a satisfactory method of choosing the  President had been discovered--and it is interesting to notice the  members of the Convention later congratulated themselves that at least  this feature of their government was above criticism--it was decided  to give still further powers to the President, such as the making of  treaties and the appointing of ambassadors and judges, although the  advice and consent of the Senate was required, and in the case of  treaties two-thirds of the members present must consent.    The presidency was frankly an experiment, the success of which would  depend largely upon the first election; yet no one seems to have been  anxious about the first choice of chief magistrate, and the reason is  not far to seek. From the moment the members agreed that there should be  a single executive they also agreed upon the man for the position.  Just as Washington had been chosen unanimously to preside over the  Convention, so it was generally accepted that he would be the first head  of the new state. Such at least was the trend of conversation and even  of debate on the floor of the Convention. It indicates something of the  conception of the office prevailing at the time that Washington, when  he became President, is said to have preferred the title, \"His High  Mightiness, the President of the United States and Protector of their  Liberties.\"    The members of the Convention were plainly growing tired and there  are evidences of haste in the work of the last few days. There was a  tendency to ride rough-shod over those whose temperaments forced them  to demand modifications in petty matters. This precipitancy gave rise to  considerable dissatisfaction and led several delegates to declare  that they would not sign the completed document. But on the whole the  sentiment of the Convention was overwhelmingly favorable. Accordingly  on Saturday, the 8th of September, a new committee was appointed, to  consist of five members, whose duty it was \"to revise the stile of  and arrange the articles which had been agreed to by the House.\" The  committee was chosen by ballot and was made up exclusively of friends of  the new Constitution: Doctor Johnson of Connecticut, Alexander Hamilton,  who had returned to Philadelphia to help in finishing the work,  Gouverneur Morris, James Madison, and Rufus King. On Wednesday the  twelfth, the Committee made its report, the greatest credit for which  is probably to be given to Morris, whose powers of expression were so  greatly admired. Another day was spent in waiting for the report to be  printed. But on Thursday this was ready, and three days were devoted to  going over carefully each article and section and giving the finishing  touches. By Saturday the work of the Convention was brought to a close,  and the Constitution was then ordered to be engrossed. On Monday, the  17th of September, the Convention met for the last time. A few of  those present being unwilling to sign, Gouverneur Morris again cleverly  devised a form which would make the action appear to be unanimous:  \"Done in Convention by the unanimous consent of the states present...  in witness whereof we have hereunto subscribed our names.\" Thirty-nine  delegates, representing twelve States, then signed the Constitution.    When Charles Biddle of Philadelphia, who was acquainted with most of  the members of the Convention, wrote his \"Autobiography,\" which was  published in 1802, he declared that for his part he considered the  government established by the Constitution to be \"the best in the world,  and as perfect as any human form of government can be.\" But he prefaced  that declaration with a statement that some of the best informed members  of the Federal Convention had told him \"they did not believe a single  member was perfectly satisfied with the Constitution, but they believed  it was the best they could ever agree upon, and that it was infinitely  better to have such a one than break up without fixing on some form of  government, which I believe at one time it was expected they would have  done.\"    One of the outstanding characteristics of the members of the Federal  Convention was their practical sagacity. They had a very definite object  before them. No matter how much the members might talk about democracy  in theory or about ancient confederacies, when it came to action they  did not go outside of their own experience. The Constitution was devised  to correct well-known defects and it contained few provisions which had  not been tested by practical political experience. Before the Convention  met, some of the leading men in the country had prepared lists of the  defects which existed in the Articles of Confederation, and in the  Constitution practically every one of these defects was corrected and by  means which had already been tested in the States and under the Articles  of Confederation.        CHAPTER VIII. THE UNION ESTABLISHED    The course of English history shops that Anglo-Saxon tradition is  strongly in favor of observing precedents and of trying to maintain  at least the form of law, even in revolutions. When the English people  found it impossible to bear with James II and made it so uncomfortable  for him that he fled the country, they shifted the responsibility from  their own shoulders by charging him with \"breaking the original Contract  between King and People.\" When the Thirteen Colonies had reached the  point where they felt that they must separate from England, their  spokesman, Thomas Jefferson, found the necessary justification in the  fundamental compact of the first settlers \"in the wilds of America\"  where \"the emigrants thought proper to adopt that system of laws  under which they had hitherto lived in the mother country\"; and in the  Declaration of Independence he charged the King of Great Britain with  \"repeated injuries and usurpations all having in direct object the  establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.\"    And so it was with the change to the new form of government in the  United States, which was accomplished only by disregarding the forms  prescribed in the Articles of Confederation and has been called,  therefore, \"the Revolution of 1789.\" From the outset the new  constitution was placed under the sanction of the old. The movement  began with an attempt, outwardly at least, to revise the Articles of  Confederation and in that form was authorized by Congress. The first  breach with the past was made when the proposal in the Virginia  Resolutions was accepted that amendments made by the Convention in the  Articles of Confederation should be submitted to assemblies chosen by  the people instead of to the legislatures of the separate States. This  was the more readily accepted because it was believed that ratification  by the legislatures would result in the formation of a treaty rather  than in a working instrument of government. The next step was to  prevent the work of the Convention from meeting the fate of all previous  amendments to the Articles of Confederation, which had required the  consent of every State in the Union. At the time the committee of detail  made its report, the Convention was ready to agree that the consent of  all the States was not necessary, and it eventually decided that, when  ratified by the conventions of nine States, the Constitution should go  into effect between the States so ratifying.    It was not within the province of the Convention to determine what the  course of procedure should be in the individual States; so it simply  transmitted the Constitution to Congress and in an accompanying  document, which significantly omitted any request for the approval of  Congress, strongly expressed the opinion that the Constitution should  \"be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3034"],[0,"The Anti-Slavery Crusade: A Chronicle of the Gathering Storm (#18)"],[1,"in Missouri was already approaching a  crisis. Southern leaders had long foreseen that the State would abolish  slavery if a free State should be established on the western boundary.  This was actually taking place. Kansas was filling up with free-state  settlers and, by the act of its own citizens, a few years later did  abolish slavery.    Republicans naturally made use of Helper's book for party purposes. A  cheap abridged edition was brought out. Several Republican leaders were  induced to sign their names to a paper commending the publication. Among  these was John Sherman of Ohio, who in the organization of the newly  elected House of Representatives in 1859 was the leading candidate of  the Republicans for the speakership. During the contest the fact that  his name was on this paper was made public, and Southern leaders were  furious. Extracts were read to prove that the book was incendiary.  Millson of Virginia said that \"one who consciously, deliberately, and of  purpose lends his name and influence to the propagation of such writings  is not only not fit to be speaker, but he is not-fit to live.\" It is one  of the ironies of the situation that the passage selected to prove the  incendiary character of the book is almost a literal quotation from the  debate in the Virginia Legislature of 1832.        CHAPTER X. \"BLEEDING KANSAS\"    Both the leading political parties were, in the campaign of 1852, fully  committed to the acceptance of the so-called Compromise of 1850 as a  final settlement of the slavery question; both were committed to the  support of the Fugitive Slave Act. The Free-soil party, with John P.  Hale as its candidate, did make a vigorous attack upon the Fugitive  Slave Act, and opposed all compromises respecting slavery, but  Free-soilers had been to a large extent reabsorbed into the Democratic  party, their vote of 1852 being only about half that of 1848. Though the  Whig vote was large and only about two hundred thousand less than that  of the Democrats, yet it was so distributed that the Whigs carried only  four States, Massachusetts, Vermont, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The other  States gave a Democratic plurality.    Had there been time for readjustment, the Whig party might have  recovered lost ground, but no time was permitted. There was in progress  in Missouri a political conflict which was already commanding national  attention. Thomas H. Benton, for thirty years a Senator from Missouri,  and a national figure, was the storm-center. His enemies accused him of  being a Free-soiler, an abolitionist in disguise. He was professedly a  stanch and uncompromising unionist, a personal and political opponent of  John C. Calhoun. According to his own statement he had been opposed  to the extension of slavery since 1804, although he had advocated the  admission of Missouri with a pro-slavery constitution in 180. He  was, from the first, senior Senator from the State, and by a peculiar  combination of influences incurred his first defeat for reelection in  1851.    Benton's defeat in the Missouri Legislature was largely the result of  national pro-slavery influences. In a former chapter, reference was  made to the Ohio River as furnishing a \"providential argument against  slavery.\" The Mississippi River as the eastern boundary of Missouri  furnished a like argument, but on the north not even a prairie  brook separated free labor in Iowa from slave labor in Missouri. The  inhabitants of western Missouri, realizing that the tenure of their  peculiar institution was becoming weaker in the east and north, early  became convinced that the organization of a free State along their  western boundary would be followed by the abolition of slavery in  their own State. This condition attracted the attention of the national  guardians of pro-slavery interests. Calhoun, Davis, Breckinridge,  Toombs, and others were in constant communication with local leaders.  A certain Judge W. C. Price, a religious fanatic, and a pro-slavery  devotee, was induced to visit every part of the State in 1844, calling  the attention of all slaveholders to the perils of the situation and  preparing the way for the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. Senator  Benton, who was approached on the subject, replied in such a way that  all radical defenders of slavery, both national leaders and local  politicians, were moved to unite for his political defeat.    David R. Atchison, junior Senator from Missouri, had been made the  leader of the pro-slavery forces. The defeat of Benton in the Missouri  Legislature did not end the strife. He at once became a candidate for  Atchison's place in the election which was to occur in 1855, and he was  in the meantime elected to the House of Representatives in 1852. The  most telling consideration in Benton's favor was the general demand, in  which he himself joined, for the immediate organization of the western  territory in order to facilitate the building of a system of railways  reaching the Pacific, with St. Louis as the point of departure. For a  time, in 1859, and 1853, Benton was apparently triumphant, and Atchison  was himself willing to consent to the organization of the new territory  with slavery excluded. The national leaders, however, were not of the  same mind. The real issue was the continuance of slavery in the  State; the one thing which must not be permitted was the transfer of  anti-slavery agitation to the separate States. Henry Clay's proposal  of 1849 to provide for gradual emancipation in Kentucky was bitterly  resented. It had long been an axiom with the slavocracy that the  institution would perish unless it had the opportunity to expand. Out of  this conviction arose Calhoun's famous theory that slaveowners had under  the Constitution an equal right with the owners of all other forms of  property in all the Territories. The theory itself assumed that the act  prohibiting slavery in the territory north of the southern boundary  of Missouri was unconstitutional and void. But this theory had not yet  received judicial sanction, and the time was at hand when the question  of freedom or slavery in the western territory was to be determined.  Between March and December, 1853, the discovery was made that the Act  of 1850 organizing the Territories of New Mexico and Utah had superseded  the Compromise of 1820; that a principle had been recognized applicable  to all the Territories; that all were open to settlement on equal terms  to slaveholders and non-slaveholders; that the subject of slavery should  be removed from Congress to the people of the Territories; and that they  should decide, either when a territorial legislature was organized or  at the time of the adoption of a constitution preparatory to statehood,  whether or not slavery should be authorized. These ideas found  expression in various newspapers during the month of December, 1853.  Though the authorship of the new theory is still a matter of dispute,  it is well known that Stephen A. Douglas became its chief sponsor and  champion. The real motives and intentions of Douglas himself and of  many of his supporters will always remain obscure and uncertain. But no  uncertainty attaches to the motives of Senator Atchison and the leaders  of the Calhoun section of the Democratic party. For ten years at least  they had been laboring to get rid of the Missouri Compromise. Their  motive was to defend slavery and especially to forestall a successful  movement for emancipation in the State of Missouri.    From early in January, 1854, until late in May, Douglas's Nebraska bill  held the attention of Congress and of the entire country. At first the  measure simply assumed that the Missouri Compromise had been superseded  by the Act of 1850. Later the bill was amended in such a way as to  repeal distinctly that time-honored act. At first the plan was to  organize Nebraska as a single Territory extending from Texas to Canada.  Later it was proposed to organize separate Territories, one west of  Missouri under the name of Kansas, the other west of Iowa under the name  of Nebraska. Opposition came from Free-soilers, from Northern Whigs  and a few Whigs from the South, and from a large proportion of Northern  Democrats. The repeal of the Missouri Compromise came like a thunderbolt  out of a clear sky to the people of the North. For a time Douglas was  the most unpopular of political leaders and was apparently repudiated by  his party. The first name designating the opponents of the Douglas bill  was \"Anti-Nebraska men,\" for which the name Republican was gradually  substituted and in 1856 became the accepted title of the party.    The provision for two territorial governments instead of one carried  with it the idea of a continued balance between slave and free States;  Kansas, being on a geographical parallel with the slave States, would  probably permit slavery, while Nebraska would be occupied by free-state  immigrants. Though this was a commonly accepted view, Eli Thayer of  Worcester, Massachusetts, and a few others took a different view. They  proposed to make an end of the discussion of the extension of slavery  by sending free men who were opposed to slavery to occupy the territory  open for settlement. To attain this object they organized an Emigrant  Aid Company incorporated under the laws of the State. Even before the  bill was passed, the corporation was in full working order. Thayer  himself traveled extensively throughout the Northern States stimulating  interest in western emigration, with the conviction that the disturbing  question could be peacefully settled in this way. California had thus  been saved to freedom; why not all other Territories? The new company  had as adviser and co-laborer Dr. Charles Robinson, who had crossed  the Kansas Territory on his way to California and had acquired valuable  experience in the art of state-building under peculiar conditions.
