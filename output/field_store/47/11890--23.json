But, I beg your  pardon, you said that all those letters are in that little room?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Did you not put them in a box?\"    \"Of course; in the same box where I put all the letters I received from  you, and where I put mine also when your business or your amusements  prevented you from coming to our rendezvous.\"    \"Ah, very good,\" said Malicorne.    \"Why are you satisfied?\"    \"Because I see there is a possibility of not having to run to Blois  after the letters, for I have them here.\"    \"You have brought the box away?\"    \"It was very dear to me, because it belonged to you.\"    \"Be sure and take care of it, for it contains original documents that  will be of priceless value by and by.\"    \"I am perfectly well aware of that indeed, and that is the very reason  why I laugh as I do, and with all my heart, too.\"    \"And now, one last word.\"    \"Why _last?_\"    \"Do we need any one to assist us?\"    \"No one.\"    \"Valets or maid-servants?\"    \"Bad policy. You will give the letters,--you will receive them. Oh!  we must have no pride in this affair, otherwise M. Malicorne and  Mademoiselle Aure, not transacting their own affairs themselves, will  have to make up their minds to see them done by others.\"    \"You are quite right; but what is going on yonder in M. de Guiche's  room?\"    \"Nothing; he is only opening his window.\"    \"Let us be gone.\" And they both immediately disappeared, all the terms  of the contract being agreed on.    The window just opened was, in fact, that of the Comte de Guiche. It  was not alone with the hope of catching a glimpse of Madame through her  curtains that he seated himself by the open window for his preoccupation  of mind had at that time a different origin. He had just received, as  we have already stated, the courier who had been dispatched to him by  Bragelonne, the latter having written to De Guiche a letter which had  made the deepest impression upon him, and which he had read over and  over again. \"Strange, strange!\" he murmured. \"How irresponsible are the  means by which destiny hurries men onward to their fate!\" Leaving the  window in order to approach nearer to the light, he once more read the  letter he had just received:--      \"CALAIS.    \"MY DEAR COUNT,--I found M. de Wardes at Calais; he has been  seriously wounded in an affair with the Duke of Buckingham. De Wardes  is, as you know, unquestionably brave, but full of malevolent and wicked  feelings. He conversed with me about yourself, for whom, he says, he  has a warm regard, also about Madame, whom he considers a beautiful and  amiable woman. He has guessed your affection for a certain person. He  also talked to me about the lady for whom I have so ardent a regard, and  showed the greatest interest on my behalf in expressing a deep pity for  me, accompanied, however, by dark hints which alarmed me at first, but  which I at last looked upon as the result of his usual love of mystery.  These are the facts: he had received news of the court; you will  understand, however, that it was only through M. de Lorraine. The report  goes, so says the news, that a change has taken place in the king's  affections. You know whom that concerns. Afterwards, the news continues,  people are talking about one of the maids of honor, respecting whom  various slanderous reports are being circulated. These vague phrases  have not allowed me to sleep. I have been deploring, ever  since yesterday, that my diffidence and vacillation of purpose,  notwithstanding a certain obstinacy of character I may possess, have  left me unable to reply to these insinuations. In a word, M. de Wardes  was setting off for Paris, and I did not delay his departure with  explanations; for it seemed rather hard, I confess, to cross-examine a  man whose wounds are hardly yet closed. In short, he travelled by short  stages, as he was anxious to leave, he said, in order to be present at a  curious spectacle the court cannot fail to offer within a short time.  He added a few congratulatory words accompanied by vague sympathizing  expressions. I could not understand the one any more than the other. I  was bewildered by my own thoughts, and tormented by a mistrust of this  man,--a mistrust which, you know better than any one else, I have never  been able to overcome. As soon as he left, my perceptions seemed  to become clearer. It is hardly possible that a man of De Wardes's  character should not have communicated something of his own malicious  nature to the statements he made to me. It is not unlikely, therefore,  that in the strange hints De Wardes threw out in my presence, there may  be a mysterious signification, which I might have some difficulty in  applying either to myself or to some one with whom you are acquainted.  Being compelled to leave as soon as possible, in obedience to the king's  commands, the idea did not occur to me of running after De Wardes in  order to ask him to explain his reserve; but I have dispatched a courier  to you with this letter, which will explain in detail my various doubts.  I regard you as myself; you have reflected and observed; it will be for  you to act. M. de Wardes will arrive very shortly; endeavor to learn  what he meant, if you do not already know. M. de Wardes, moreover,  pretended that the Duke of Buckingham left Paris on the very best of  terms with Madame. This was an affair which would have unhesitatingly  made me draw my sword, had I not felt that I was under the necessity  of dispatching the king's mission before undertaking any quarrel  whatsoever. Burn this letter, which Olivain will hand you. Whatever  Olivain says, you may confidently rely on. Will you have the goodness,  my dear comte, to recall me to the remembrance of Mademoiselle de la  Valliere, whose hands I kiss with the greatest respect.    \"Your devoted    \"DE BRAGELONNE.    \"P. S.--If anything serious should happen--we should be prepared for  everything, dispatch a courier to me with this one single word, 'come,'  and I will be in Paris within six and thirty hours after the receipt of  your letter.\"      De Guiche sighed, folded up the letter a third time, and, instead of  burning it, as Raoul had recommended him to do, placed it in his pocket.  He felt it needed reading over and over again.    \"How much distress of mind, yet what sublime confidence, he shows!\"  murmured the comte; \"he has poured out his whole soul in this letter.  He says nothing of the Comte de la Fere, and speaks of his respect for  Louise. He cautions me on my own account, and entreats me on his. Ah!\"  continued De Guiche, with a threatening gesture, \"you interfere in my  affairs, Monsieur de Wardes, do you? Very well, then; I will shortly  occupy myself with yours. As for you, poor Raoul,--you who intrust your  heart to my keeping, be assured I will watch over it.\"    With this promise, De Guiche begged Malicorne to come immediately to his  apartments, if possible. Malicorne acknowledged the invitation with an  activity which was the first result of his conversation with Montalais.  And while De Guiche, who thought that his motive was undiscovered,  cross-examined Malicorne, the latter, who appeared to be working in the  dark, soon guessed his questioner's motives. The consequence was,  that, after a quarter of an hour's conversation, during which De Guiche  thought he had ascertained the whole truth with regard to La Valliere  and the king, he had learned absolutely nothing more than his own eyes  had already acquainted him with, while Malicorne learned, or guessed,  that Raoul, who was absent, was fast becoming suspicious, and that De  Guiche intended to watch over the treasure of the Hesperides. Malicorne  accepted the office of dragon. De Guiche fancied he had done everything  for his friend, and soon began to think of nothing but his personal  affairs. The next evening, De Wardes's return and first appearance at  the king's reception were announced. When that visit had been paid, the  convalescent waited on Monsieur; De Guiche taking care, however, to be  at Monsieur's apartments before the visit took place.        Chapter XII. How De Wardes Was Received at Court.    Monsieur had received De Wardes with that marked favor light and  frivolous minds bestow on every novelty that comes in their way. De  Wardes, who had been absent for a month, was like fresh fruit to him.  To treat him with marked kindness was an infidelity to old friends, and  there is always something fascinating in that; moreover, it was a sort  of reparation to De Wardes himself. Nothing, consequently, could exceed  the favorable notice Monsieur took of him. The Chevalier de Lorraine,  who feared this rival but a little, but who respected a character and  disposition only too parallel to his own in every particular, with the  addition of a bull-dog courage he did not himself possess, received De  Wardes with a greater display of regard and affection than even Monsieur  had done. De Guiche, as we have said, was there also, but kept in the  background, waiting very patiently until all these interchanges were  over. De Wardes, while talking to the others, and even to Monsieur  himself, had not for a moment lost sight of De Guiche, who, he  instinctively felt, was there on his account. As soon as he had finished  with the others, he went up to De Guiche. They exchanged the most  courteous compliments, after which De Wardes returned to Monsieur and  the other gentlemen.    In the midst of these congratulations Madame was announced. She had  been informed of De Wardes's arrival, and knowing all the details of his  voyage and duel, she was not sorry to be present at the remarks she  knew would be made, without delay, by one who, she felt assured, was her  personal enemy. Two or three of her ladies accompanied her. De Wardes  saluted Madame in the most graceful and respectful manner, and, as a  commencement of hostilities, announced, in the first place, that he  could furnish the Duke of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27250"],[0,"What I Saw in America (#18)"],[1,"vigorous loungers, no doubt, in the rural  parts of America, but the idea of a walking stick would not especially  suggest them to Americans; it would not call up such figures like a  fairy wand. It would be easy to trace back the difference to many  English origins, possibly to aristocratic origins, to the idea of the  old squire, a man vigorous and even rustic, but trained to hold a  useless staff rather than a useful tool. It might be suggested that  American citizens do at least so far love freedom as to like to have  their hands free. It might be suggested, on the other hand, that they  keep their hands for the handles of many machines. And that the hand on  a handle is less free than the hand on a stick or even a tool. But these  again are controversial questions and I am only noting a fact.    If an Englishman wished to imagine more or less exactly what the  impression is, and how misleading it is, he could find something like a  parallel in what he himself feels about a fur coat. When I first found  myself among the crowds on the main floor of a New York hotel, my rather  exaggerated impression of the luxury of the place was largely produced  by the number of men in fur coats, and what we should consider rather  ostentatious fur coats, with all the fur outside.    Now an Englishman has a number of atmospheric but largely accidental  associations in connection with a fur coat. I will not say that he  thinks a man in a fur coat must be a wealthy and wicked man; but I do  say that in his own ideal and perfect vision a wealthy and wicked man  would wear a fur coat. Thus I had the sensation of standing in a surging  mob of American millionaires, or even African millionaires; for the  millionaires of Chicago must be like the Knights of the Round Table  compared with the millionaires of Johannesburg.    But, as a matter of fact, the man in the fur coat was not even an  American millionaire, but simply an American. It did not signify luxury,  but rather necessity, and even a harsh and almost heroic necessity.  Orson probably wore a fur coat; and he was brought up by bears, but not  the bears of Wall Street. Eskimos are generally represented as a furry  folk; but they are not necessarily engaged in delicate financial  operations, even in the typical and appropriate occupation called  freezing out. And if the American is not exactly an arctic traveller  rushing from pole to pole, at least he is often literally fleeing from  ice to ice. He has to make a very extreme distinction between outdoor  and indoor clothing. He has to live in an icehouse outside and a  hothouse inside; so hot that he may be said to construct an icehouse  inside that. He turns himself into an icehouse and warms himself against  the cold until he is warm enough to eat ices. But the point is that the  same coat of fur which in England would indicate the sybarite life may  here very well indicate the strenuous life; just as the same walking  stick which would here suggest a lounger would in England suggest a  plodder and almost a pilgrim.    And these two trifles are types which I should like to put, by way of  proviso and apology, at the very beginning of any attempt at a record of  any impressions of a foreign society. They serve merely to illustrate  the most important impression of all, the impression of how false all  impressions may be. I suspect that most of the very false impressions  have come from the careful record of very true facts. They have come  from the fatal power of observing the facts without being able to  observe the truth. They came from seeing the symbol with the most vivid  clarity and being blind to all that it symbolises. It is as if a man who  knew no Greek should imagine that he could read a Greek inscription  because he took the Greek R for an English P or the Greek long E for an  English H. I do not mention this merely as a criticism on other people's  impressions of America, but as a criticism on my own. I wish it to be  understood that I am well aware that all my views are subject to this  sort of potential criticism, and that even when I am certain of the  facts I do not profess to be certain of the deductions.    In this chapter I hope to point out how a misunderstanding of this kind  affects the common impression, not altogether unfounded, that the  Americans talk about dollars. But for the moment I am merely anxious to  avoid a similar misunderstanding when I talk about Americans. About the  dogmas of democracy, about the right of a people to its own symbols,  whether they be coins or customs, I am convinced, and no longer to be  shaken. But about the meaning of those symbols, in silver or other  substances, I am always open to correction. That error is the price we  pay for the great glory of nationality. And in this sense I am quite  ready, at the start, to warn my own readers against my own opinions.    The fact without the truth is futile; indeed the fact without the truth  is false. I have already noted that this is especially true touching our  observations of a strange country; and it is certainly true touching one  small fact which has swelled into a large fable. I mean the fable about  America commonly summed up in the phrase about the Almighty Dollar. I do  not think the dollar is almighty in America; I fancy many things are  mightier, including many ideals and some rather insane ideals. But I  think it might be maintained that the dollar has another of the  attributes of deity. If it is not omnipotent it is in a sense  omnipresent. Whatever Americans think about dollars, it is, I think,  relatively true that they talk about dollars. If a mere mechanical  record could be taken by the modern machinery of dictaphones and  stenography, I do not think it probable that the mere word 'dollars'  would occur more often in any given number of American conversations  than the mere word 'pounds' or 'shillings' in a similar number of  English conversations. And these statistics, like nearly all statistics,  would be utterly useless and even fundamentally false. It is as if we  should calculate that the word 'elephant' had been mentioned a certain  number of times in a particular London street, or so many times more  often than the word 'thunderbolt' had been used in Stoke Poges.  Doubtless there are statisticians capable of carefully collecting those  statistics also; and doubtless there are scientific social reformers  capable of legislating on the basis of them. They would probably argue  from the elephantine imagery of the London street that such and such a  percentage of the householders were megalomaniacs and required medical  care and police coercion. And doubtless their calculations, like nearly  all such calculations, would leave out the only important point; as that  the street was in the immediate neighbourhood of the Zoo, or was yet  more happily situated under the benignant shadow of the Elephant and  Castle. And in the same way the mechanical calculation about the mention  of dollars is entirely useless unless we have some moral understanding  of why they are mentioned. It certainly does not mean merely a love of  money; and if it did, a love of money may mean a great many very  different and even contrary things. The love of money is very different  in a peasant or in a pirate, in a miser or in a gambler, in a great  financier or in a man doing some practical and productive work. Now this  difference in the conversation of American and English business men  arises, I think, from certain much deeper things in the American which  are generally not understood by the Englishman. It also arises from much  deeper things in the Englishman, of which the Englishman is even more  ignorant.    To begin with, I fancy that the American, quite apart from any love of  money, has a great love of measurement. He will mention the exact size  or weight of things, in a way which appears to us as irrelevant. It is  as if we were to say that a man came to see us carrying three feet of  walking stick and four inches of cigar. It is so in cases that have no  possible connection with any avarice or greed for gain. An American will  praise the prodigal generosity of some other man in giving up his own  estate for the good of the poor. But he will generally say that the  philanthropist gave them a 200-acre park, where an Englishman would  think it quite sufficient to say that he gave them a park. There is  something about this precision which seems suitable to the American  atmosphere; to the hard sunlight, and the cloudless skies, and the  glittering detail of the architecture and the landscape; just as the  vaguer English version is consonant to our mistier and more  impressionist scenery. It is also connected perhaps with something more  boyish about the younger civilisation; and corresponds to the passionate  particularity with which a boy will distinguish the uniforms of  regiments, the rigs of ships, or even the colours of tram tickets. It is  a certain godlike appetite for things, as distinct from thoughts.    But there is also, of course, a much deeper cause of the difference; and  it can easily be deduced by noting the real nature of the difference  itself. When two business men in a train are talking about dollars I am  not so foolish as to expect them to be talking about the philosophy of  St. Thomas Aquinas. But if they were two English business men I should  not expect them to be talking about business. Probably it would be about  some sport; and most probably some sport in which they themselves never  dreamed of indulging. The approximate difference is that the American  talks about his work and the Englishman about his holidays. His ideal is  not labour but leisure. Like every other national characteristic, this  is not primarily a point for praise or blame; in essence it involves  neither and in effect it involves both. It is certainly connected with  that snobbishness which is the great sin of English "]]]
