It is manifest that, as the crops removed from the soil all contain a  greater or less amount of inorganic matters, they must be continually  undergoing diminution, and at length be completely exhausted unless  their quantity is maintained from some external source. In many cases  the supply of these substances is so large that ages may elapse before  this becomes apparent, but where the quantity is small, a system of  reckless cropping may reduce a soil to a state of absolute sterility. A  remarkable illustration of this fact is found in the virgin soils of  America, from which the early settlers reaped almost unheard-of crops,  but, by injudicious cultivation, they were soon exhausted and abandoned,  new tracts being brought in and cultivated only to be in their turn  abandoned. The knowledge of the composition of the ash of plants assists  us in ascertaining how this exhaustion may be avoided, and indicates the  mode in which such soils may be preserved in a fertile state.

THE SOIL--ITS CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL CHARACTERS.      No department of agricultural chemistry is surrounded with greater  difficulties and uncertainties than that relating to the properties of  the soil. When chemistry began to be applied to agriculture, it was not  unnaturally supposed that the examination of the soil would enable us to  ascertain with certainty the mode in which it might be most  advantageously improved and cultivated, and when, as occasionally  happened, analysis revealed the absence of one or more of the essential  constituents of the plant in a barren soil, it indicated at once the  cause and the cure of the defect. But the expectations naturally formed  from the facts then observed have been as yet very partially fulfilled;  for, as our knowledge has advanced, it has become apparent that it is  only in rare instances that it is possible satisfactorily to connect  together the composition and the properties of a soil, and with each  advancement in the accuracy and minuteness of our analysis the  difficulties have been rather increased than diminished. Although it is  occasionally possible to predicate from its composition that a  particular soil will be incapable of supporting vegetation, it not  unfrequently happens that a fruitful and a barren soil are so similar  that it is impossible to distinguish them from one another, and cases  even occur in which the barren appears superior to the fertile soil. The  cause of this apparently anomalous phenomenon lies in the fact that  analysis, however minute, is unable to disclose all the conditions of  fertility, and that it must be supplemented by an examination of its  physical and other chemical properties, which are not indicated by  ordinary experiments. Of late years very considerable progress has been  made in the investigation of the properties of the soil, and many facts  of great importance have been discovered, but we are still unable to  assert that all the conditions of fertility are yet known, and the  practical application of those recently discovered is still very  imperfectly understood.    It must not be supposed that a careful analysis of a soil is without  value, for very important practical deductions may often be drawn from  it, and when this is not practicable it is not unfrequently due to its  being imperfect or incomplete, for it is so complex that the cases in  which all the necessary details have been eliminated are even now by no  means numerous. In fact, the want of a large number of thorough analyses  of soils of different kinds is a matter of some difficulty, and so soon  as a satisfactory mode of investigation can be determined upon, a full  examination of this subject would be of much importance.    _Origin of Soils._--The constituents of the soil, like those of the  plant, may be divided into the great classes of organic and inorganic.  The origin of the former has been already discussed: they are derived  from the decay of plants which have already grown upon the soil, and  which, in various stages of decomposition, form the numerous class of  substances grouped together under the name of humus. The organic  substances may therefore be considered as in a manner secondary  constituents of the soil, which have been accumulated in it as the  consequence of the growth and decay of successive generations of plants,  while the primeval soil consisted of inorganic substances only.    The inorganic constituents of the soil are obtained as the result of a  succession of chemical changes going on in the rocks which protrude  through the surface of the earth. We have only to examine one of these  rocks to observe that it is constantly undergoing a series of important  changes. Under the influence of air and moisture, aided by the powerful  agency of frost, it is seen to become soft, and gradually to  disintegrate, until it is finally converted into an uniform powder, in  which the structure of the original rock is with difficulty, if at all  distinguishable. The rapidity with which these changes take place is  very variable; in the harder rocks, such as granite and mica slate it is  so slow as to be scarcely perceptible, while in others, such as the  shales of the coal formation, a very few years' exposure is sufficient  for the purpose. These actions, operating through a long series of  years, are the source of the inorganic constituents of all soils.    Geology points to a period at which the earth's surface must have been  altogether devoid of soil, and have consisted entirely of hard  crystalline rocks, such as granite and trap, by the disintegration of  which, slowly proceeding from the creation down to the present time, all  the soils which now cover the surface have been formed. But they have  been produced by a succession of very complicated processes; for these  disintegrated rocks being washed away in the form of fine mud, or at  least of minute particles, and being deposited at the bottom of the  primeval seas, have there hardened into what are called sedimentary  rocks, which being raised above the surface by volcanic action or other  great geological forces, have been again disintegrated to yield  different soils. Thus, then, all soils are directly or indirectly  derived from the crystalline rocks, those overlying them being formed  immediately by their decomposition, while those found above the  sedimentary rocks may be traced back through them to the crystalline  rocks from which they were originally formed.    Such being the case, the composition of different soils must manifestly  depend on that of the crystalline rocks from which they have been  derived. Their number is by no means large, and they all consist of  mixtures in variable proportions of quartz, felspar, mica, hornblende,  augite, and zeolites. With the exception of quartz and augite, these  names are, however, representatives of different classes of minerals.  There are, for instance, several different minerals commonly classified  under the name of felspar, which have been distinguished by  mineralogists by the names of orthoclase, albite, oligoclase, and  labradorite; and there are at least two sorts of mica, two of  hornblende, and many varieties of zeolites.    Quartz consists of pure silica, and when in large masses is one of the  most indestructible rocks. It occurs, however, intermixed with other  minerals in small crystals, or irregular fragments, and forms the entire  mass of pure sand.    The four kinds of felspar which have been already named are compounds of  silica with alumina, and another base which is either potash, soda, or  lime. Their composition is as follows, two examples of each being  given--    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------                    |  Orthoclase. |    Albite.  | Oligoclase. | Labradorite. |  ------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|  Silica            |  65.72| 65.00| 67.99| 68.23| 62.70| 63.51| 54.66|  54.67|  Alumina           |  18.57| 18.64| 19.61| 18.30| 23.80| 23.09| 27.87|  27.89|  Peroxide of iron  | traces|  0.83|  0.70|  1.01|  0.62|   -- |  --  |   0.31|  Oxide of manganese| traces|  0.13|  --  |   -- |   -- |   -- |  --  |    -- |  Lime              |   0.34|  1.23|  0.66|  1.26|  4.60|  2.44| 12.01|  10.60|  Magnesia          |   0.10|  1.03|  --  |  0.51|  0.02|  0.77|  --  |   0.18|  Potash            |  14.02|  9.12|  --  |  2.53|  1.05|  2.19|  --  |   0.49|  Soda              |   1.25|  3.49| 11.12|  7.99|  8.00|  9.37|  5.46|   5.05|  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------|                    | 100.00| 99.47|100.08| 99.83|100.79|101.37|100.00| 99.19 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------    It is obvious that soils produced by the disintegration of these  minerals must differ materially in quality.

He would have liked representative government  at once, but seemed satisfied with above.    'Secondly.--Whether a Boer would be able to have a rifle to protect him  from native? I said I thought he would be by a licence and on  registration.    'Thirdly.--He asked whether Dutch language would be allowed? I said that  English and Dutch would, I thought, have equal rights. He expressed hope  that officials dealing with farmers would know Dutch.    'Fourthly.--The Kaffir question. This turned at once on franchise of  Kaffirs, and a solution seemed to be that franchise should not be given  to Kaffirs until after representative government was granted to  Colonies. Orange Free State laws for Kaffirs were considered good.    'Fifthly.--That Dutch Church property should remain untouched.    'Sixthly.--Public trusts and orphan funds to be left intact. He asked  whether British Government, in taking over the assets of Republics,  would also take over legal debts. This he made rather a strong point of,  and he intended it to include debts legally contracted since the war  began. He referred to notes issued amounting to less than a million.    'Seventhly.--He asked if any war tax would be imposed on farmers? I said  I thought not.    'Eighthly.--When would prisoners of war return?    'Ninthly.--He referred to pecuniary assistance to repair burnt farms,  and enable farmers to start afresh. I said I thought some assistance  would be given.    'Tenthly.--Amnesty to all at end of war. We spoke of Colonials who  joined Republics, and he seemed not adverse to their being  disfranchised.    'I arranged with him that I should write and let him know the view of  the Government on these points. All I said during the interview was  qualified by being subject to confirmation from home. He was anxious to  get an answer soon.'    There followed some correspondence between Lord Kitchener, Sir Alfred  Milner, and Mr. Chamberlain upon the exact terms which could be given to  Botha. They ended in the following offer, which was submitted to him  upon March 7. That, in consideration of a complete military surrender,    '1. There should be a complete amnesty for all _bona fide_ acts of war  for all burghers of the Republics. In the case of Colonial rebels, if  they returned to their Colonies some inquiry must be held on their  conduct.    '2. All prisoners to be at once sent back.    '3. Crown Colony government to be given as soon as possible; this in  turn to change to representative government, as in all other free  British possessions. The courts of law to be independent of the  government.    '4. The Dutch and English languages to be put upon an equality.    '5. That the Government should help to replace the farmers on their  farms, to restore their buildings, should pledge itself not to specially  tax them, and should pay as an act of grace one million pounds to meet  the debt incurred by the Republican governments to their own people  during the war.    '6. That the burghers be allowed sporting fire-arms.    '7. That the Kaffirs should have the protection of the law, but should  not have the vote.    'In conclusion,' says Lord Kitchener, 'I must inform your honour that if  the terms are not accepted after a reasonable delay for consideration,  they must be regarded as cancelled.'    But the wise and chivalrous Botha was overruled by the men around him,  many of whom had little to lose by a continuance of the struggle. It was  evident that he did not himself consider independence vital, since he  had gravely discussed terms which were based upon loss of independence.  But other influences had been brought to bear upon him, and this was his  reply--a reply which has already cost the lives of so many of each side:    'I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Your Excellency's letter  stating what steps Your Excellency's Government is prepared to take in  the event of a general and total cessation of hostilities. I have  advised my Government of Your Excellency's said letter; but, after the  mutual exchange of views at our interview at Middelburg on 28th February  last, it will certainly not surprise Your Excellency to know that I do  not feel disposed to recommend that the terms of the said letter shall  have the earnest consideration of my Government. I may add also that my  Government and my chief officers here entirely agree to my views.'    It will be observed that in this reply Botha bases his refusal upon his  own views as expressed in the original interview with Kitchener; and we  have his own authority, therefore, to show that they were not determined  by any changes which Chamberlain may have made in the terms--a favourite  charge of that gentleman's enemies.    It is impossible to say how, short of independence, Great Britain could  have improved upon these terms, and it has already been shown that to  offer independence would mean having to fight the war over again. It has  been suggested that Great Britain might have offered a definite date  upon which representative institutions should come in force, but such a  promise must be disingenuous, for it must evidently depend not upon a  date, but upon the state of the country. The offers of loans to the  farmers towards the stocking and rebuilding the farms were surely  generous to our defeated foes, and, indeed, it is clear now that in some  respects our generosity went too far, and that the interests of the  Empire would have suffered severely had these terms been accepted. To  have given more would certainly seem not to have offered peace, but to  have implored it.    Whatever the final terms of peace may prove to be, it is to be earnestly  hoped that 40,000 male prisoners will not be returned, as a matter of  right, without any guarantee for their future conduct. It is also much  to be desired that the bastard taal language, which has no literature  and is almost as unintelligible to a Hollander as to an Englishman, will  cease to be officially recognised. These two omissions may repay in the  long run for weary months of extra war since, upon Botha's refusal, the  British Government withdrew these terms and the hand moved onwards upon  the dial of fate, never to turn back.    De Wet had said in reference to Kitchener's terms of peace, 'What is  the use of examining all the points, as the only object for which we are  fighting is our independence and our national existence?' It is evident,  however, that Botha did not consider this an absolute bar to renewing  the negotiations, for upon May 10, two months later, he wrote the  following letter to Lord Kitchener:                                 'Commandant-General's Camp, May 10, 1901.    'EXCELLENCY,--As I have already assured Your Excellency I am very  desirous of terminating this war, and its sad consequences. It is,  however, necessary, in order to comply with the \"Grondwet\" of this  Republic and otherwise, that, before any steps are taken in that  direction, the condition of our country and our cause be brought to the  notice of His Honour, State President Kruger, in Europe; and I therefore  wish to send two persons to him in order to acquaint him fully with that  condition.    'As speed in this matter is of great consequence to both contending  parties, and as such despatch without Your Excellency's assistance would  take a considerable time, I should like to hear from Your Excellency  whether Your Excellency is prepared to assist me in expediting this  matter by allowing such person or persons to journey there and back  unhindered, if necessary by the traffic medium within Your Excellency's  control.--I have, &c.,                                        'LOUIS BOTHA, Commandant-General.'    To this Kitchener answered:                 'Army Headquarters, South Africa, Pretoria, May 16, 1901.    'YOUR HONOUR,--I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your  Honour's letter of 10th instant, and, in reply, beg to state that I can  only deal with you and your superior officers in the field in regard to  the cessation of hostilities, and that I do not recognise the official  status of any other persons in the late Republics of the Orange River  and Transvaal.    'If, however, Your Honour desires, with the object of bringing  hostilities to a close, to consult with any person in Europe, I will  forward any telegram Your Honour desires on the subject, and let you  have the reply. Should, however, Your Honour still desire to send  messengers, and will inform me of their names and status, I will refer  the matter to His Majesty's Government for decision.--I have, &c.,                           'KITCHENER, General,     'Commanding-in-Chief, British Troops, South Africa.'    At this period, the second week of May, the Boer cause was in very low  water, as on the same date we have Botha reopening negotiations which he  had declared to be definitely closed, and Reitz (the man who used to  regard the whole matter as a great joke) writing a despairing letter to  Steyn to the effect that the game was up and that it was time to take  the last final step. A reply was received from Kruger encouraging the  Boers to continue their hopeless and fatal resistance. His reply was to  the effect that there were still great hopes of a successful issue of  the war, and that he had taken steps to make proper provision for the  Boer prisoners and for the refugee women. These steps, and very  efficient ones, too, were to leave them to the generosity of that  Government which he was so fond of reviling. There are signs that  something else had occurred to give them fresh hope and also fresh  material supplies. It looks, upon the face of it, as if, about that  time, large supplies"]]]
