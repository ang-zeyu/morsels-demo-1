But when he reached the  Rangitikei he found more peace-making work to do, for he was met by a  fighting party from Taranaki who were bent on attacking the settlements  which he had just left. They carried gospels as well as fire-arms, but  this seemed to make them insolent instead of reasonable. Their leader  was an ignorant person who, on the strength of having once been at a  Wesleyan mission station, posed as a prophet and had invented a new  sacrament. Williams gave this man a severe rebuke, both for his  demeanour and for his heresy. So potent was the influence of \"Wiremu\"  that, after much debate, the northern army turned homewards, and the  Otaki Christians were left in peace.    On arrival at the Whanganui, great eagerness was everywhere displayed  for books and teachers. In a native canoe Henry Williams ascended this  noted stream, whose banks were then clothed in all their primeval  beauty. Not bush-clad precipices, however, attracted his attention so  much as the villages which nestled at their foot. In all of these he was  astonished to find Christian worship maintained, though no white teacher  had yet passed by that way. These _kaingas_ are all vanished now, and  their very names are well-nigh forgotten; but Pukehika (a few miles  below Pipiriki) afforded the traveller a memorable experience. At  daybreak on Christmas Eve he records that \"_three bells for morning  prayers were heard from different hamlets in the neighbourhood._\" On  reading this astonishing statement, one's thoughts fly at once to  Kinglake's well-known experience in the Arabian desert, when on a Sunday  morning he heard distinctly the bells of his village church at Marlen.  But there was no illusion here. The bells were chiefly musket barrels,  and they hung in actual raupo chapels built by Maori hands!    On leaving the river the expedition had before them a week's march to  Taupo. For three days this meant climbing steep mountains and sliding  down precipices, creeping along the trunks of fallen trees, or worming a  way underneath them. On the fourth morning the travellers emerged into  the open country at the foot of Mt. Ruapehu, and took their way across  the pumice plateau. Their food was now nearly exhausted, and it was in a  \"tight-belted\" condition that, on the last day but one of the old year,  they saw the great lake glittering before them. Villages clustered round  its shores, and in most of them there stood a chapel erected at the  instance of Chapman and his Rotorua teachers. Williams enjoyed the  feeling of being once more on the track of other missionaries; nor did  he despise the evidences of their care which met him from time to time  on his way--tea and sugar in one place and a horse in another--until he  at last reached Rotorua in a somewhat exhausted condition, and was  thankful to rest once more on the island, in Morgan's quiet abode.    A still more pleasant surprise awaited the dauntless traveller on his  further journey to Tauranga. While pushing his way through wet bush, he  suddenly met Mr. William Williams, who in the midst of his migration to  the east coast had been blown into Tauranga by contrary winds. On  entering the village the brothers held a meeting, at which it was  resolved to send a missionary to Whanganui without delay, both for the  sake of the earnest enquirers in that district, and to afford some  companionship to Hadfield in his lonely post at Otaki. The man chosen  for this duty was the Rev. J. Mason, who had lately arrived in the  country. Henry Williams arrived at his home on Jan. 18th, 1840, in time  to negotiate the Treaty of Waitangi, which will fall to be considered in  a different connection.    Twenty-five years had elapsed since Marsden had brought the tidings of  Christianity to New Zealand, and his settlers had begun in fear and  trembling to lay the foundation stones of the Church in this new land.  Now, there was hardly a district of the North Island into which the  knowledge of the truth had not penetrated. We have watched its progress  in north and east and south-west and centre. The Wesleyan missionaries  were working down the west coast. Only the south-east had not been  touched. Its population was small and had been greatly reduced by  Rauparaha, but the readiness of the people was great, if we may judge  from one of the most pathetic passages from the old Maori days. The  events relate to a time a little later than that of those already  described, but they must look back to the early days of Hadfield's  residence at Kapiti. The speaker is an old chief who died in the  Wairarapa district between Eketahuna and Pahiatua in 1850. The old man  thus described to his sons his search for the new light of which he had  heard:    \"You well know that I have from time to time brought you much riches. I  used to bring you muskets, hatchets, and blankets, but I afterwards  heard of the new riches called Faith. I sought it; I went to Manawatu, a  long and dangerous journey, for we were surrounded by enemies. I saw  some natives who had heard of it, but they could not satisfy me. I  sought further, but in vain. I then heard of a white man, called  Hadfield, at Kapiti, and that with him was the spring where I could fill  my empty and dry calabash. I travelled to his place; but he was  gone--gone away ill. I returned to you, my children, dark-minded. Many  days passed by. The snows fell, they melted, they disappeared; the  tree-buds expanded; the paths of the forest were again passable to the  foot of the Maori. We heard of another white man who was going over  mountains, through forests and swamps, giving drink from his calabash to  the poor secluded natives, to the remnants of the tribes of the mighty,  of the renowned of former days, now dwelling by twos and threes among  the roots of the trees of ancient forests, and among the high reeds of  the brooks in the valleys. Yes, my grandchildren; your ancestors once  spread over the country, as did the quail and the kiwi, but now their  descendants are as the descendants of those birds, scarce, gone, dead.  Yes; we heard of that white man: we heard of his going over the snowy  mountains to Patea, up the East Coast, all over the rocks to Turakirae.  I sent four of my children to Mataikona to meet him. They saw his face;  you talked with him. You brought me a drop of water from his calabash.  You told me he would come to this far-off spot to see me. I rejoiced; I  disbelieved his coming; but I said, 'He may.' I built the chapel; we  waited, expecting. You slept at nights; I did not. He came; he came  forth from the long forests; he stood upon Te Hawera ground. I saw him;  I shook hands with him; we rubbed noses together. Yes; I saw a  missionary's face; I sat in his cloth house; I tasted his new food; I  heard him talk Maori. My heart bounded within me. I listened, I ate his  words. You slept at nights; I did not. I listened, and he told me about  God and His Son Jesus Christ, and of peace and reconciliation, and of a  Father's house beyond the stars: and now I, too, drank from his  calabash, and was refreshed. He gave me a book, too, as well as words. I  laid hold of the new riches for me and for you; and we have it now. My  children, I am old; my hair is white, the yellow leaf is falling from  the _tawai_ tree. I am departing; the sun is sinking behind the great  western hills; it will soon be night. But hear me: do you hold fast the  new riches--the great riches--the true riches. We have had plenty of sin  and pain and death; and we have been troubled by many--by our neighbours  and relatives; but we have the true riches: hold fast the true riches  that Karepa has sought for you!\"    [Illustration: RUINS OF ST. THOMAS'S CHURCH, TAMAKI.]    How can we account for all this? Must we not say that these were indeed  the \"_Years of the right hand of the Most High_\"?          CHAPTER VII.    RETROSPECT.    (1814-1841).      The native bent of the Maori mind caused the people, as they embraced    Christianity, gradually to place themselves as a matter of course    under the guidance of a sort of Christian theocracy. It was under the    auspices of this mild missionary regime--which, if a government, was a    very singular one, seeing that there were no laws, and an almost total    absence of crime--that the first British Governor set foot on the    shores of New Zealand.      --_Judge Wilson._      Hardly had Henry Williams returned to Paihia from his great journey  through the heart of the island, when a warship arrived in the Bay,  bearing Captain William Hobson with a commission from Queen Victoria,  authorising him to annex the country to the British Crown. A not very  friendly historian (Saunders) has summed up the situation at this point  by saying that, on his arrival, Hobson fell into the hands of the  Reverend Henry Williams, and obligingly admits that he might have fallen  into worse ones. As a matter of fact, the captain could have done but  little had he not secured the co-operation of this influential  missionary. Rusden speaks no more than the truth when he declares that  \"Henry Williams had but to raise his finger, and his _mana_ would have  weighed more with the Maoris than the devices of Colonel Wakefield or  the office of Hobson.\"    The first act of the new official was to gather the northern chiefs on  the lawn in front of the British Residency, on the other side of the  river from Paihia, and to lay before them the famous document known as  the Treaty of Waitangi. It is sometimes asserted that Henry Williams was  really the author of this treaty. That would seem to be an error, but he  may have been consulted in the drafting of the document; and there can  be no question but that it was his influence which induced the chiefs to  sign it. It was he who interpreted to the Maoris the provisions of the  treaty, and the speech in which Hobson commended"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31425"],[0,"Report of the Decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, and the (#18)"],[1,"of Illinois, and held him  there as a slave until the month of April or May, 1836. At this date,  Dr. Emerson removed, with the plaintiff from the Rock Island post to  the military post at Fort Snelling, situate on the west bank of the  Mississippi river, in the Territory of Upper Louisiana, and north of  the latitude thirty-six degrees thirty minutes, and north of the State  of Missouri. That he held the plaintiff in slavery, at Fort Snelling,  from the last-mentioned date until the year 1838.    That in the year 1835, Harriet, mentioned in the declaration, was a  negro slave of Major Taliaferro, who belonged to the army of the  United States; and in that year he took her to Fort Snelling, already  mentioned, and kept her there as a slave until the year 1836, and then  sold and delivered her to Dr. Emerson, who held her in slavery, at  Fort Snelling, until the year 1838. That in the year 1836, the  plaintiff and Harriet were married, at Fort Snelling, with the  consent of their master. The two children, Eliza and Lizzie, are the  fruit of this marriage. The first is about fourteen years of age, and  was born on board the steamboat Gipsey, north of the State of  Missouri, and upon the Mississippi river; the other, about seven years  of age, was born in the State of Missouri, at the military post called  Jefferson Barracks.    In 1838, Dr. Emerson removed the plaintiff, Harriet, and their  daughter Eliza, from Fort Snelling to the State of Missouri, where  they have ever since resided. And that, before the commencement of  this suit, they were sold by the Doctor to Sandford, the defendant,  who has claimed and held them as slaves ever since.    The agreed case also states that the plaintiff brought a suit for his  freedom, in the Circuit Court of the State of Missouri, on which a  judgment was rendered in his favor; but that, on a writ of error from  the Supreme Court of the State, the judgment of the court below was  reversed, and the cause remanded to the circuit for a new trial.    On closing the testimony in the court below, the counsel for the  plaintiff prayed the court to instruct the jury, upon the agreed state  of facts, that they ought to find for the plaintiff; when the court  refused, and instructed them that, upon the facts, the law was with  the defendant.    With respect to the plea in abatement, which went to the citizenship  of the plaintiff, and his competency to bring a suit in the Federal  courts, the common-law rule of pleading is, that upon a judgment  against the plea on demurrer, and that the defendant answer over, and  the defendant submits to the judgment, and pleads over to the merits,  the plea in abatement is deemed to be waived, and is not afterwards to  be regarded as a part of the record in deciding upon the rights of the  parties. There is some question, however, whether this rule of  pleading applies to the peculiar system and jurisdiction of the  Federal courts. As, in these courts, if the facts appearing on the  record show that the Circuit Court had no jurisdiction, its judgment  will be reversed in the appellate court for that cause, and the case  remanded with directions to be dismissed.    In the view we have taken of the case, it will not be necessary to  pass upon this question, and we shall therefore proceed at once to an  examination of the case upon its merits. The question upon the merits,  in general terms, is, whether or not the removal of the plaintiff, who  was a slave, with his master, from the State of Missouri to the State  of Illinois, with a view to a temporary residence, and after such  residence and return to the slave State, such residence in the free  State works an emancipation.    As appears from an agreed statement of facts, this question has been  before the highest court of the State of Missouri, and a judgment  rendered that this residence in the free State has no such effect;  but, on the contrary, that his original condition continued unchanged.    The court below, the Circuit Court of the United States for Missouri,  in which this suit was afterwards brought, followed the decision of  the State court, and rendered a like judgment against the plaintiff.    The argument against these decisions is, that the laws of Illinois,  forbidding slavery within her territory, had the effect to set the  slave free while residing in that State, and to impress upon him the  condition and status of a freeman; and that, by force of these laws,  this status and condition accompanied him on his return to the slave  State, and of consequence he could not be there held as a slave.    This question has been examined in the courts of several of the  slaveholding States, and different opinions expressed and conclusions  arrived at. We shall hereafter refer to some of them, and to the  principles upon which they are founded. Our opinion is, that the  question is one which belongs to each State to decide for itself,  either by its Legislature or courts of justice; and hence, in respect  to the case before us, to the State of Missouri--a question  exclusively of Missouri law, and which, when determined by that State,  it is the duty of the Federal courts to follow it. In other words,  except in cases where the power is restrained by the Constitution of  the United States, the law of the State is supreme over the subject of  slavery within its jurisdiction.    As a practical illustration of the principle, we may refer to the  legislation of the free States in abolishing slavery, and prohibiting  its introduction into their territories. Confessedly, except as  restrained by the Federal Constitution, they exercised, and  rightfully, complete and absolute power over the subject. Upon what  principle, then, can it be denied to the State of Missouri? The power  flows from the sovereign character of the States of this Union;  sovereign, not merely as respects the Federal Government--except as  they have consented to its limitation--but sovereign as respects each  other. Whether, therefore, the State of Missouri will recognise or  give effect to the laws of Illinois within her territories on the  subject of slavery, is a question for her to determine. Nor is there  any constitutional power in this Government that can rightfully  control her.    Every State or nation possesses an exclusive sovereignty and  jurisdiction within her own territory; and, her laws affect and bind  all property and persons residing within it. It may regulate the  manner and circumstances under which property is held, and the  condition, capacity, and state, of all persons therein; and, also, the  remedy and modes of administering justice. And it is equally true,  that no State or nation can affect or bind property out of its  territory, or persons not residing within it. No State, therefore, can  enact laws to operate beyond its own dominions, and, if it attempts to  do so, it may be lawfully refused obedience. Such laws can have no  inherent authority extra-territorially. This is the necessary result  of the independence of distinct and separate sovereignties.    Now, it follows from these principles, that whatever force or effect  the laws of one State or nation may have in the territories of  another, must depend solely upon the laws and municipal regulations of  the latter, upon its own jurisprudence and polity, and upon its own  express or tacit consent.    Judge Story observes, in his Conflict of Laws, (p. 24,) \"that a State  may prohibit the operation of all foreign laws, and the rights growing  out of them, within its territories.\" \"And that when its code speaks  positively on the subject, it must be obeyed by all persons who are  within reach of its sovereignty; when its customary unwritten or  common law speaks directly on the subject, it is equally to be  obeyed.\"    Nations, from convenience and comity, and from mutual interest, and a  sort of moral necessity to do justice, recognise and administer the  laws of other countries. But, of the nature, extent, and utility, of  them, respecting property, or the state and condition of persons  within her territories, each nation judges for itself; and is never  bound, even upon the ground of comity, to recognise them, if  prejudicial to her own interests. The recognition is purely from  comity, and not from any absolute or paramount obligation.    Judge Story again observes, (398,) \"that the true foundation and  extent of the obligation of the laws of one nation within another is  the voluntary consent of the latter, and is inadmissible when they are  contrary to its known interests.\" And he adds, \"in the silence of any  positive rule affirming or denying or restraining the operation of the  foreign laws, courts of justice presume the tacit adoption of them by  their own Government, unless they are repugnant to its policy or  prejudicial to its interests.\" (See also 2 Kent Com., p. 457; 13  Peters, 519, 589.)    These principles fully establish, that it belongs to the sovereign  State of Missouri to determine by her laws the question of slavery  within her jurisdiction, subject only to such limitations as may be  found in the Federal Constitution; and, further, that the laws of  other States of the Confederacy, whether enacted by their Legislatures  or expounded by their courts, can have no operation within her  territory, or affect rights growing out of her own laws on the  subject. This is the necessary result of the independent and sovereign  character of the State. The principle is not peculiar to the State of  Missouri, but is equally applicable to each State belonging to the  Confederacy. The laws of each have no extra-territorial operation  within the jurisdiction of another, except such as may be voluntarily  conceded by her laws or courts of justice. To the extent of such  concession upon the rule of comity of nations, the foreign law may  operate, as it then becomes a part of the municipal law of the State.  When determined that the"]]]
