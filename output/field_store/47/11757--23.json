Now, you know him--you know him quite well--but you don't know  him--naturally. Sounds paradoxical, I know.\"    \"I reckon the Cosmos is cracked,\" said Usher, and fell asprawl in his  round office chair.    \"Now, see here,\" vociferated the stranger, striking the table, but  speaking in a voice that was all the more mysterious because it was  comparatively mild and rational though still resounding. \"I won't let  you in. I want--\"    \"Who in hell are you?\" yelled Usher, suddenly sitting up straight.    \"I think the gentleman's name is Todd,\" said the priest.    Then he picked up the pink slip of newspaper.    \"I fear you don't read the Society papers properly,\" he said, and began  to read out in a monotonous voice, \"'Or locked in the jewelled bosoms of  our city's gayest leaders; but there is talk of a pretty parody of the  manners and customs of the other end of Society's scale.' There's been  a big Slum Dinner up at Pilgrim's Pond tonight; and a man, one of the  guests, disappeared. Mr Ireton Todd is a good host, and has tracked him  here, without even waiting to take off his fancy-dress.\"    \"What man do you mean?\"    \"I mean the man with comically ill-fitting clothes you saw running  across the ploughed field. Hadn't you better go and investigate him? He  will be rather impatient to get back to his champagne, from which he ran  away in such a hurry, when the convict with the gun hove in sight.\"    \"Do you seriously mean--\" began the official.    \"Why, look here, Mr Usher,\" said Father Brown quietly, \"you said the  machine couldn't make a mistake; and in one sense it didn't. But the  other machine did; the machine that worked it. You assumed that the  man in rags jumped at the name of Lord Falconroy, because he was Lord  Falconroy's murderer. He jumped at the name of Lord Falconroy because he  is Lord Falconroy.\"    \"Then why the blazes didn't he say so?\" demanded the staring Usher.    \"He felt his plight and recent panic were hardly patrician,\" replied  the priest, \"so he tried to keep the name back at first. But he was  just going to tell it you, when\"--and Father Brown looked down at his  boots--\"when a woman found another name for him.\"    \"But you can't be so mad as to say,\" said Greywood Usher, very white,  \"that Lord Falconroy was Drugger Davis.\"    The priest looked at him very earnestly, but with a baffling and  undecipherable face.    \"I am not saying anything about it,\" he said. \"I leave all the rest to  you. Your pink paper says that the title was recently revived for him;  but those papers are very unreliable. It says he was in the States in  youth; but the whole story seems very strange. Davis and Falconroy are  both pretty considerable cowards, but so are lots of other men. I would  not hang a dog on my own opinion about this. But I think,\" he went on  softly and reflectively, \"I think you Americans are too modest. I think  you idealize the English aristocracy--even in assuming it to be so  aristocratic. You see a good-looking Englishman in evening-dress; you  know he's in the House of Lords; and you fancy he has a father. You  don't allow for our national buoyancy and uplift. Many of our most  influential noblemen have not only risen recently, but--\"    \"Oh, stop it!\" cried Greywood Usher, wringing one lean hand in  impatience against a shade of irony in the other's face.    \"Don't stay talking to this lunatic!\" cried Todd brutally. \"Take me to  my friend.\"    Next morning Father Brown appeared with the same demure expression,  carrying yet another piece of pink newspaper.    \"I'm afraid you neglect the fashionable press rather,\" he said, \"but  this cutting may interest you.\"    Usher read the headlines, \"Last-Trick's Strayed Revellers: Mirthful  Incident near Pilgrim's Pond.\" The paragraph went on: \"A laughable  occurrence took place outside Wilkinson's Motor Garage last night.  A policeman on duty had his attention drawn by larrikins to a man  in prison dress who was stepping with considerable coolness into the  steering-seat of a pretty high-toned Panhard; he was accompanied by a  girl wrapped in a ragged shawl. On the police interfering, the young  woman threw back the shawl, and all recognized Millionaire Todd's  daughter, who had just come from the Slum Freak Dinner at the Pond,  where all the choicest guests were in a similar deshabille. She and the  gentleman who had donned prison uniform were going for the customary  joy-ride.\"    Under the pink slip Mr Usher found a strip of a later paper, headed,  \"Astounding Escape of Millionaire's Daughter with Convict. She had  Arranged Freak Dinner. Now Safe in--\"    Mr Greenwood Usher lifted his eyes, but Father Brown was gone.            SIX -- The Head of Caesar      THERE is somewhere in Brompton or Kensington an interminable avenue of  tall houses, rich but largely empty, that looks like a terrace of tombs.  The very steps up to the dark front doors seem as steep as the side of  pyramids; one would hesitate to knock at the door, lest it should be  opened by a mummy. But a yet more depressing feature in the grey facade  is its telescopic length and changeless continuity. The pilgrim walking  down it begins to think he will never come to a break or a corner; but  there is one exception--a very small one, but hailed by the pilgrim  almost with a shout. There is a sort of mews between two of the tall  mansions, a mere slit like the crack of a door by comparison with  the street, but just large enough to permit a pigmy ale-house or  eating-house, still allowed by the rich to their stable-servants, to  stand in the angle. There is something cheery in its very dinginess,  and something free and elfin in its very insignificance. At the feet of  those grey stone giants it looks like a lighted house of dwarfs.    Anyone passing the place during a certain autumn evening, itself almost  fairylike, might have seen a hand pull aside the red half-blind which  (along with some large white lettering) half hid the interior from the  street, and a face peer out not unlike a rather innocent goblin's. It  was, in fact, the face of one with the harmless human name of Brown,  formerly priest of Cobhole in Essex, and now working in London. His  friend, Flambeau, a semi-official investigator, was sitting opposite  him, making his last notes of a case he had cleared up in the  neighbourhood. They were sitting at a small table, close up to the  window, when the priest pulled the curtain back and looked out. He  waited till a stranger in the street had passed the window, to let the  curtain fall into its place again. Then his round eyes rolled to the  large white lettering on the window above his head, and then strayed to  the next table, at which sat only a navvy with beer and cheese, and a  young girl with red hair and a glass of milk. Then (seeing his friend  put away the pocket-book), he said softly:    \"If you've got ten minutes, I wish you'd follow that man with the false  nose.\"    Flambeau looked up in surprise; but the girl with the red hair also  looked up, and with something that was stronger than astonishment. She  was simply and even loosely dressed in light brown sacking stuff;  but she was a lady, and even, on a second glance, a rather needlessly  haughty one. \"The man with the false nose!\" repeated Flambeau. \"Who's  he?\"    \"I haven't a notion,\" answered Father Brown. \"I want you to find out;  I ask it as a favour. He went down there\"--and he jerked his thumb over  his shoulder in one of his undistinguished gestures--\"and can't have  passed three lamp-posts yet. I only want to know the direction.\"    Flambeau gazed at his friend for some time, with an expression between  perplexity and amusement; and then, rising from the table; squeezed his  huge form out of the little door of the dwarf tavern, and melted into  the twilight.    Father Brown took a small book out of his pocket and began to read  steadily; he betrayed no consciousness of the fact that the red-haired  lady had left her own table and sat down opposite him. At last she  leaned over and said in a low, strong voice: \"Why do you say that? How  do you know it's false?\"    He lifted his rather heavy eyelids, which fluttered in considerable  embarrassment. Then his dubious eye roamed again to the white lettering  on the glass front of the public-house. The young woman's eyes followed  his, and rested there also, but in pure puzzledom.    \"No,\" said Father Brown, answering her thoughts. \"It doesn't say 'Sela',  like the thing in the Psalms; I read it like that myself when I was  wool-gathering just now; it says 'Ales.'\"    \"Well?\" inquired the staring young lady. \"What does it matter what it  says?\"    His ruminating eye roved to the girl's light canvas sleeve, round the  wrist of which ran a very slight thread of artistic pattern, just enough  to distinguish it from a working-dress of a common woman and make it  more like the working-dress of a lady art-student. He seemed to find  much food for thought in this; but his reply was very slow and hesitant.  \"You see, madam,\" he said, \"from outside the place looks--well, it is a  perfectly decent place--but ladies like you don't--don't generally think  so. They never go into such places from choice, except--\"    \"Well?\" she repeated.    \"Except an unfortunate few who don't go in to drink milk.\"    \"You are a most singular person,\" said the young lady. \"What is your  object in all this?\"    \"Not to trouble you about it,\" he replied, very gently. \"Only to arm  myself with knowledge enough to help you, if ever you freely ask my  help.\"    \"But why should I need help?\"    He continued his dreamy monologue. \"You couldn't have come in to see  protegees, humble friends, that sort of thing, or you'd have gone  through into the parlour... and you couldn't have come in because  you were ill, or you'd have spoken to the woman of the place, who's  obviously respectable... besides, you don't look ill in that way, but  only"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22305"],[0,"The Naval History of the United States. Volume 1 (#18)"],[1,"fog  hung over the ocean; and the fleet Yankee, flying here and there, was  able to cut out and capture three of the vessels without alarming the  frigate, that continued unsuspectingly on her course. Two days later,  Jones snapped up a Liverpool privateer, that fired scarcely a single  gun in resistance. Then crowded with prisoners, embarrassed by prizes,  and short of food and water, the \"Alfred\" turned her course homeward.    Five valuable prizes sailed in her wake. Anxiety for the safety of  these gave Jones no rest by day or night. He was ceaselessly on the  watch lest some hostile man-of-war should overhaul his fleet, and  force him to abandon his hard-won fruits of victory. All went well  until, when off St. George's Bank, he encountered the frigate  \"Milford,\"--the same craft to whose cannon-balls Jones, but a few  months before, had tauntingly responded with musket-shots.    It was late in the afternoon when the \"Milford\" was sighted; and  Jones, seeing that she could by no possibility overtake his squadron  before night, ordered his prizes to continue their course without  regard to any lights or apparent signals from the \"Alfred.\" When  darkness fell upon the sea, the Yankees were scudding along on the  starboard tack, with the Englishman coming bravely up astern. From the  tops of the \"Alfred\" swung two burning lanterns, which the enemy  doubtless pronounced a bit of beastly stupidity on the part of the  Yankee, affording, as it did, an excellent guide for the pursuer to  steer by. But during the night the wily Jones changed his course. The  prizes, with the exception of the captured privateer, continued on  the starboard tack. The \"Alfred\" and the privateer made off on the  port tack, with the \"Milford\" in full cry in their wake. Not until the  morning dawned did the Englishman discover how he had been tricked.    Having thus secured the safety of his prizes, it only remained for  Jones to escape with the privateer. Unluckily, however, the officer  put in charge of the privateer proved incapable, and his craft fell  into hands of the British. Jones, however, safely carried the \"Alfred\"  clear of the \"Milford's\" guns, and, a heavy storm coming up, soon  eluded his foe in the snow and darkness. Thereupon he shaped his  course for Boston, where he arrived on the 5th of December, 1776. Had  he been delayed two days longer, both his provisions and his water  would have been exhausted.    For the ensuing six months Jones remained on shore, not by any means  inactive, for his brain was teeming with great projects for his  country's service. He had been deprived of the command of the  \"Alfred,\" and another ship was not easily to be found: so he turned  his attention to questions of naval organization, and the results of  many of his suggestions are observable in the United States navy  to-day. It was not until June 14, 1777, that a command was found for  him. This was the eighteen-gun ship \"Ranger,\" built to carry a  frigate's battery of twenty-six guns. She had been built for the  revolutionary government, at Portsmouth, and was a stanch-built, solid  craft, though miserably slow and somewhat crank. Jones, though  disappointed with the sailing qualities of the craft, was nevertheless  vastly delighted to be again in command of a man-of-war, and wasted no  time in getting her ready for sea.    It so happened, that, on the very day Paul Jones received his  commission as commander of the \"Ranger,\" the Continental Congress  adopted the Stars and Stripes for the national flag. Jones,  anticipating this action, had prepared a flag in accordance with the  proposed designs, and, upon hearing of the action of Congress, had it  run to the masthead, while the cannon of the \"Ranger\" thundered out  their deep-mouthed greetings to the starry banner destined to wave  over the most glorious nation of the earth. Thus it happened that the  same hand that had given the pine-tree banner to the winds was the  first to fling out to the breezes the bright folds of the Stars and  Stripes.    Early in October the \"Ranger\" left Portsmouth, and made for the coast  of France. Astute agents of the Americans in that country were having  a fleet, powerful frigate built there for Jones, which he was to take,  leaving the sluggish \"Ranger\" to be sold. But, on his arrival at  Nantes, Jones was grievously disappointed to learn that the British  Government had so vigorously protested against the building of a  vessel-of-war in France for the Americans, that the French Government  had been obliged to notify the American agents that their plan must be  abandoned. France was at this time at peace with Great Britain, and,  though inclined to be friendly with the rebellious colonies, was not  ready to entirely abandon her position as a neutral power. Later, when  she took up arms against England, she gave the Americans every right  in her ports they could desire.    Jones thus found himself in European waters with a vessel too weak to  stand against the frigates England could send to take her, and too  slow to elude them. But he determined to strike some effective blows  for the cause of liberty. Accordingly he planned an enterprise, which,  for audacity of conception and dash in execution, has never been  equalled by any naval expedition since.    This was nothing less than a virtual invasion of England. The \"Ranger\"  lay at Brest. Jones planned to dash across the English Channel, and  cruise along the coast of England, burning shipping and towns, as a  piece of retaliation upon the British for their wanton outrages along  the American coast. It was a bold plan. The channel was thronged with  the heavy frigates of Great Britain, any one of which could have  annihilated the audacious Yankee cruiser. Nevertheless, Jones  determined to brave the danger.    At the outset, it seemed as though his purpose was to be balked by  heavy weather. For days after the \"Ranger\" left Brest, she battled  against the chop-seas of the English Channel. The sky was dark, and  the light of the sun obscured by gray clouds. The wind whistled  through the rigging, and tore at the tightly furled sails. Great green  walls of water, capped with snowy foam, beat thunderously against the  sides of the \"Ranger.\" Now and then a port would be driven in, and the  men between decks drenched by the incoming deluge. The \"Ranger\" had  encountered an equinoctial gale in its worst form.    When the gale died away, Jones found himself off the Scilly Islands,  in full view of the coast of England. Here he encountered a  merchantman, which he took and scuttled, sending the crew ashore to  spread the news that an American man-of-war was ravaging the channel.  Having alarmed all England, he changed his hunting-ground to St.  George's Channel and the Irish Sea, where he captured several ships;  sending one, a prize, back to Brest. He was in waters with which he  had been familiar from his youth, and he made good use of his  knowledge; dashing here and there, lying in wait in the highway of  commerce, and then secreting himself in some sequestered cove while  the enemy's ship-of-war went by in fruitless search for the marauder.  All England was aroused by the exploits of the Yankee cruiser. Never  since the days of the Invincible Armada had war been so brought home  to the people of the tight little island. Long had the British  boastfully claimed the title of monarch of the seas. Long had they  sung the vainglorious song,--              \"Britannia needs no bulwarks,             No towers along the steep;             Her march is o'er the mountain waves,             Her home is on the deep.\"    But Paul Jones showed Great Britain that her boasted power was a  bubble. He ravaged the seas within cannon-shot of English headlands.  He captured and burned merchantmen, drove the rates of insurance up to  panic prices, paralyzed British shipping-trade, and even made small  incursions into British territory.    The reports that reached Jones of British barbarity along the American  coast, of the burning of Falmouth, of tribute levied on innumerable  seaport towns,--all aroused in him a determination to strike a  retaliatory blow. Whitehaven, a small seaport, was the spot chosen by  him for attack; and he brought his ship to off the mouth of the harbor  late one night, intending to send in a boat's crew to fire the  shipping. But so strong a wind sprung up, as to threaten to drive the  ship ashore; and Jones was forced to make sail, and get an offing. A  second attempt, made upon a small harbor called Lochryan, on the  western coast of Scotland, was defeated by a like cause.    But the expedition against Lochryan, though in itself futile, was the  means of giving Jones an opportunity to show his merits as a fighter.  Soon after leaving Lochryan, he entered the bay of Carrichfergus, on  which is situated the Irish commercial city of Belfast. The bay was  constantly filled with merchantmen; and the \"Ranger,\" with her ports  closed, and her warlike character carefully disguised, excited no  suspicion aboard a trim, heavy-built craft that lay at anchor a little  farther up the bay. This craft was the British man-of-war \"Drake,\"  mounting twenty guns. Soon after his arrival in the bay, Jones learned  the character of the \"Drake,\" and determined to attempt her capture  during the night. Accordingly he dropped anchor near by, and, while  carefully concealing the character of his craft, made every  preparation for a midnight fight. The men sat between decks,  sharpening cutlasses, and cleaning and priming their pistols; the  cannon were loaded with grape, and depressed for work at close  quarters; battle lanterns were hung in place, ready to be lighted at  the signal for action.    At ten o'clock, the tramp of men about the capstan gave notice that  the anchor was being brought to the catheads. Soon the creaking of  cordage, and the snapping of the sails, told that the fresh breeze was  being caught "]]]
