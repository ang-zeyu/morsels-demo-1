And they pass 'twixt the wood and the wain-burg within earshot of the     horn,     But over the windy meadows no sound thereof is borne,     And all is well amongst them.  To the burg I draw anigh     And I see all battle-banners in the breeze of morning fly,     But no Wolfings round their banner and no warrior of the Shield,     No Geiring and no Hrossing in the burg or on the field.\"    She held her peace for a little while, and no one dared to speak; then  she lifted up her head and spake:       \"Now I go by the lip of the wild-wood and a sound withal I hear,     As of men in the paths of the thicket, and a many drawing anear.     Then, muffled yet by the tree-boles, I hear the Shielding song,     And warriors blithe and merry with the battle of the strong.     Give back a little, Markmen, make way for men to pass     To your ordered battle-dwelling o'er the trodden meadow-grass,     For alive with men is the wild-wood and shineth with the steel,     And hath a voice most merry to tell of the Kindreds' weal,     'Twixt each tree a warrior standeth come back from the spear-strewn     way,     And forth they come from the wild-wood and a little band are they.\"    Then again was she silent; but her head sank not, as of one thinking, as  before it did, but she looked straight forward with bright eyes and  smiling, as she said:       \"Lo, now the guests they are bringing that ye have not seen before;     Yet guests but ill-entreated; for they lack their shields of war,     No spear in the hand they carry and with no sax are girt.     Lo, these are the dreaded foemen, these once so strong to hurt;     The men that all folk fled from, the swift to drive the spoil,     The men that fashioned nothing but the trap to make men toil.     They drew the sword in the cities, they came and struck the stroke     And smote the shield of the Markmen, and point and edge they broke.     They drew the sword in the war-garth, they swore to bring aback     God's gifts from the Markmen houses where the tables never lack.     O Markmen, take the God-gifts that came on their own feet     O'er the hills through the Mirkwood thicket the Stone of Tyr to meet!\"    Again she stayed her song, which had been loud and joyous, and they who  heard her knew that the Kindreds had gained the day, and whilst the Hall-  Sun was silent they fell to talking of this fair day of battle and the  taking of captives.  But presently she spread out her hands again and  they held their peace, and she said:       \"I see, O Wolfing women, and many a thing I see,     But not all things, O elders, this eve shall ye learn of me,     For another mouth there cometh: the thicket I behold     And the Sons of Tyr amidst it, and I see the oak-trees old,     And the war-shout ringing round them; and I see the battle-lord     Unhelmed amidst of the mighty; and I see his leaping sword;     Strokes struck and warriors falling, and the streaks of spears I see,     But hereof shall the other tell you who speaketh after me.     For none other than the Shieldings from out the wood have come,     And they shift the turn with the Daylings to drive the folk-spear     home,     And to follow with the Wolfings and thrust the war-beast forth.     And so good men deem the tidings that they bid them journey north     On the feet of a Shielding runner, that Gisli hath to name;     And west of the water he wendeth by the way that the Wolfings came;     Now for sleep he tarries never, and no meat is in his mouth     Till the first of the Houses hearkeneth the tidings of the south;     Lo, he speaks, and the mead-sea sippeth, and the bread by the way doth     eat,     And over the Geiring threshold and outward pass his feet;     And he breasts the Burg of the Daylings and saith his happy word,     And stayeth to drink for a minute of the waves of Battleford.     Lone then by the stream he runneth, and wendeth the wild-wood road,     And dasheth through the hazels of the Oselings' fair abode,     And the Elking women know it, and their hearts are glad once more,     And ye--yea, hearken, Wolfings, for his feet are at the door.\"          CHAPTER XII--TIDINGS OF THE BATTLE IN MIRKWOOD      As the Hall-Sun made an end they heard in good sooth the feet of the  runner on the hard ground without the hall, and presently the door opened  and he came leaping over the threshold, and up to the table, and stood  leaning on it with one hand, his breast heaving with his last swift run.  Then he spake presently:    \"I am Gisli of the Shieldings: Otter sendeth me to the Hall-Sun; but on  the way I was to tell tidings to the Houses west of the Water: so have I  done.  Now is my journey ended; for Otter saith: 'Let the Hall-Sun note  the tidings and send word of them by four of the lightest limbed of the  women, or by lads a-horseback, both west and east of the Water; let her  send the word as it seemeth to her, whether she hath seen it or not.  I  will drink a short draught since my running is over.\"    Then a damsel brought him a horn of mead and let it come into his hand,  and he drank sighing with pleasure, while the damsel for pleasure of him  and his tidings laid her hand on his shoulder.  Then he set down the horn  and spake:    \"We, the Shieldings, with the Geirings, the Hrossings, and the Wolfings,  three hundred warriors and more, were led into the Wood by Thiodolf the  War-duke, beside whom went Fox, who hath seen the Romans.  We were all  afoot; for there is no wide way through the Wood, nor would we have it  otherwise, lest the foe find the thicket easy.  But many of us know the  thicket and its ways; so we made not the easy hard.  I was near the War-  duke, for I know the thicket and am light-foot: I am a bowman.  I saw  Thiodolf that he was unhelmed and bore no shield, nor had he any coat of  fence; nought but a deer-skin frock.\"    As he said that word, the carline, who had drawn very near to him and was  looking hard at his face, turned and looked on the Hall-Sun and stared at  her till she reddened under those keen eyes: for in her heart began to  gather some knowledge of the tale of her mother and what her will was.    But Gisli went on: \"Yet by his side was his mighty sword, and we all knew  it for Throng-plough, and were glad of it and of him and the unfenced  breast of the dauntless.  Six hours we went spreading wide through the  thicket, not always seeing one another, but knowing one another to be  nigh; those that knew the thicket best led, the others followed on.  So  we went till it was high noon on the plain and glimmering dusk in the  thicket, and we saw nought, save here and there a roe, and here and there  a sounder of swine, and coneys where it was opener, and the sun shone and  the grass grew for a little space.  So came we unto where the thicket  ended suddenly, and there was a long glade of the wild-wood, all set  about with great oak-trees and grass thereunder, which I knew well; and  thereof the tale tells that it was a holy place of the folk who abided in  these parts before the Sons of the Goths.  Now will I drink.\"    So he drank of the horn and said: \"It seemeth that Fox had a deeming of  the way the Romans should come; so now we abided in the thicket without  that glade and lay quiet and hidden, spreading ourselves as much about  that lawn of the oak-trees as we might, the while Fox and three others  crept through the wood to espy what might be toward: not long had they  been gone ere we heard a war-horn blow, and it was none of our horns: it  was a long way off, but we looked to our weapons: for men are eager for  the foe and the death that cometh, when they lie hidden in the thicket.  A  while passed, and again we heard the horn, and it was nigher and had a  marvellous voice; then in a while was a little noise of men, not their  voices, but footsteps going warily through the brake to the south, and  twelve men came slowly and warily into that oak-lawn, and lo, one of them  was Fox; but he was clad in the raiment of the dastard of the Goths whom  he had slain.  I tell you my heart beat, for I saw that the others were  Roman men, and one of them seemed to be a man of authority, and he held  Fox by the shoulder, and pointed to the thicket where we lay, and  something he said to him, as we saw by his gesture and face, but his  voice we heard not, for he spake soft.    \"Then of those ten men of his he sent back two, and Fox going between  them, as though he should be slain if he misled them; and he and the  eight abided there wisely and warily, standing silently some six feet  from each other, moving scarce at all, but looking like images fashioned  of brown copper and iron; holding their casting-spears (which be  marvellous heavy weapons) and girt with the sax.    \"As they stood there, not out of earshot of a man speaking in his wonted  voice, our War-duke made a sign to those about him, and we spread very  quietly to the right hand and the left of him once more, and we drew as  close as might be to the thicket's edge, and those who had bows the  nighest thereto.  Thus then we abided a while again; and again came the  horn's voice; for belike they had no mind to come their ways covertly  because of their pride.    \"Soon therewithal comes Fox creeping back to us, and I saw him whisper  into the ear of the War-duke, but heard not the word he said.  I saw that  he had hanging to him two Roman saxes, so I deemed he had slain those  two, and so escaped the Romans.  Maidens, it were well that ye gave me to  drink again, for I am weary and my journey is done.\"    So again they brought him the horn, and made much of him; and he drank,  and then spake on.    \"Now heard we the horn's voice again quite close, and it was sharp and  shrill, and nothing like to the roar of our battle-horns: still was the  wood and no wind abroad, not even down the oak-lawn; and we heard now the  tramp of many men as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2888"],[0,"Yorkshire Dialect Poems (1673-1915) and traditional poems (#18)"],[1,"nean,          Ivvery neet an' all;       Thoo'll doan, doon tum'le towards Hell fleames,          An' Christ tak up thy saul.

The text of this version of the \"Lyke-wake Dirge\" follows, with slight       variations, that found in Mr. Richard Blakeborough's Wit, Character,       Folklore, and Customs of the North Riding (p. 123), where the following       account is given: \"I cannot say when or where the Lyke Walke dirge was       sung for the last time in the North Riding, but I remember once talking       to an old chap who remembered it being sung over the corpse of a distant       relation of his, a native of Kildale.  This would be about 1800, and he       told me that Lyke-wakes were of rare occurrence then, and only heard of       in out-of-the-way places. ... There are other versions of the song; the       one here given is as it was dictated to me.  There is another version in       the North Riding which seems to have been written according to the tenets       of Rome; at least I imagine so, as purgatory takes the place of hellish       flames, as given above.\"  In the Appendix to this volume will be found       the other version with the introduction of purgatory to which Mr.       Blakeborough refers.  I have taken it from Sir Walter Scott's Border       Minstrelsy (ed.  Henderson, vol. ii. pp.  170-2), but it also finds a       place in John Aubrey's Remains of Gentilisme and Judaisme (1686-7),       preserved among the Lansdowne MSS. in the British Museum.  Aubrey       prefixes the following note to his version of the dirge: The beliefe in       Yorkeshire was amongst the vulgar (perhaps is in part still) that after       the person's death the soule went over Whinny-moore, and till about       1616-24 at the funerale a woman came (like a Praefica) and sang the       following song.\"  Further information about this interesting dirge and       its parallels in other literatures will be found in Henderson's edition       of the Border Minstrelsy, p. 163) and in J. C. Atkinson's Glosary of the       Cleveland Dialect, p. 595.          Cleveland Lyke-wake Dirge         Traditional       Sir Walter Scott's version         From Appendix I of 1st Edition.
