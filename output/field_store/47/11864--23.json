Now we will change places, and you shall be my  servant. If you refuse you had better make your peace with God, for I  shall drown you.\"    \"Stop, faithful servant,\" cried the prince, \"you will not be so wicked  as to do that. What good will it do you? You will never be so happy as  you have been with me, and you know what dreadful tortures are in  store for murderers in the other world; their hands are plunged into  boiling pitch, their shoulders bruised with blows from red-hot iron  clubs, and their necks sawn with wooden saws.\"    \"You may cut and saw me as much as you like in the other world,\" said  the servant, \"but I shall drown you in this.\" And he began to let the  strap slide through his fingers.    \"Very well,\" said the prince, \"I agree to accept your terms. You shall  be the prince and I will be your servant, I give you my word.\"    \"I have no faith in words that are carried away by the first wind that  blows. Swear to confirm your promise in writing.\"    \"I swear.\"    The servant then let down paper and pencil, and dictated  the following:        \"I hereby declare that I renounce my name and rights in      favour of the bearer of this writing, and that I acknowledge      him to be my prince, and that I am his servant. Written in      the well.                                          (Signed) PRINCE SLUGOBYL.\"    The man having taken this document, which he was quite unable to read,  drew out the prince, took off the clothes in which he was dressed, and  made him wear those he himself had just taken off. Thus disguised they  travelled for a week, and arriving at a large city, went straight to  the king's palace. There the false prince dismissed his pretended  servant to the stables, and presenting himself before the king,  addressed him thus in a very haughty manner:    \"King, I am come to demand the hand of your wise and beautiful  daughter, whose fame has reached my father's court. In exchange I  offer our alliance, and in case of refusal, war.\"    [Illustration]    \"Prayers and threats are equally out of place,\" answered the king;  \"nevertheless, prince, as proof of the esteem in which I hold the  king, your father, I grant your request: but only on one condition,  that you deliver us from a large army that now besets our town. Do  this, and my daughter shall be yours.\"    \"Certainly,\" said the impostor, \"I can soon get rid of them, however  near they may be. I undertake by to-morrow morning to have freed the  land entirely of them.\"    In the evening he went to the stables, and calling his pretended  servant, saluted him respectfully and said, \"Listen, my dear friend, I  want you to go immediately outside the town and destroy the besieging  army that surrounds it. But do it in such a way that every one will  believe that I have done it. In exchange for this favour I promise to  return the writing in which you renounced your title of prince and  engaged to serve me.\"    The prince put on his armour, mounted his horse, and rode outside the  city gates. There he stopped and called three times to the Invisible  Knight.    \"Behold me, prince, at your service,\" said a voice close to him. \"I  will do anything you wish, for you saved my only daughter from the  hands of the giant Kostey; I shall always be grateful.\"    Slugobyl showed him the army he had to destroy before morning, and the  Invisible Knight whistled and sang:      \"Magu, Horse with Golden Mane,    I want your help yet once again,    Walk not the earth but fly through space    As lightnings flash or thunders race.    Swift as the arrow from the bow,    Come quick, yet so that none can know.\"    At that instant a magnificent grey horse appeared out of a whirlwind  of smoke, and from his head there hung a golden mane. Swift as the  wind was he, flames of fire blazed forth from his nostrils, lightnings  flashed from his eyes, and volumes of smoke came from his ears. The  Invisible Knight leapt upon his back, saying to the prince, \"Take my  sword and destroy the left wing of the army, while I attack the right  wing and the centre.\"    The two heroes rushed forward and attacked the invaders with such fury  that on all sides men fell like chopped wood or dried grass. A  frightful massacre followed, but it was in vain that the enemy fled,  for the two knights seemed to be everywhere. Within a short time only  the dead and dying remained on the battle-field, and the two  conquerors quietly returned to the town. On reaching the palace steps,  the Invisible Knight melted into the morning mist, and the serving-man  prince returned to the stables.    That same night it happened that the king's daughter, not being able  to sleep, had remained on her balcony and seen and heard all that had  taken place. She had overheard the conversation between the impostor  and the real prince, had seen the latter call to his assistance the  Invisible Knight, and then doff his royal armour in favour of the  false prince; she had seen and understood everything, but she  determined to keep silence for a little longer.    But when on the next day the king, her father, celebrated the victory  of the false prince with great rejoicings, loaded him with honours and  presents, and calling his daughter expressed a wish that she should  marry him--the princess could be silent no longer. She walked up to  the real prince, who was waiting at table with the other servants,  took his arm, and leading him to the king, said:    \"Father, and all good people, this is the man who has saved our  country from the enemy, and whom God has destined to be my husband. He  to whom you pay these honours is but a vile impostor, who has robbed  his master of name and rights. Last night I witnessed such deeds as  eye has never seen nor ear heard, but which shall be told afterwards.  Bid this traitor show the writing which proves the truth of what I  say.\"    When the false prince had delivered up the paper signed by the  serving-man prince, it was found to contain the following words:        \"The bearer of this document, the false and wicked servant      of the serving-man prince, shall receive the punishment his      sin deserves.                                          (Signed) PRINCE SLUGOBYL.\"    \"What? Is that the real meaning of that writing?\" asked the traitor,  who could not read.    \"Most assuredly,\" was the reply.    Then he threw himself at the king's feet and begged for mercy. But he  received his punishment, for he was tied to the tails of four wild  horses and torn to pieces.    Prince Slugobyl married the princess. It was a magnificent wedding. I  myself was there, and drank of the mead and wine; but they only  touched my beard, they did not enter my mouth.          THE SPIRIT OF THE STEPPES          [Illustration]    THE SPIRIT OF THE STEPPES      In ancient days there lived a king and queen; the former was old but  the latter young. Although they loved one another dearly they were  very unhappy, for God had not given them any children. They fretted  and grieved about this so deeply that the queen became ill with  melancholy. The doctors advised her to travel. The king was obliged to  remain at home, so she went without him, accompanied by twelve maids  of honour, all beautiful and fresh as flowers in May. When they had  travelled for some days, they reached a vast uninhabited plain which  stretched so far away it seemed to touch the sky. After driving hither  and thither for some time the driver was quite bewildered, and stopped  before a large stone column. At its foot stood a warrior on horseback,  clad in steel armour.    \"Brave knight, can you direct me to the high-road?\" said the driver;  \"we are lost, and know not which way to go.\"    \"I will show you the way,\" said the warrior, \"but only on one  condition, that each of you gives me a kiss.\"    The queen looked at the warrior in wrath, and ordered the coachman to  drive on. The carriage continued moving nearly all day, but as if  bewitched, for it always returned to the stone column. This time the  queen addressed the warrior.    \"Knight,\" said she, \"show us the road, and I will reward you richly.\"    \"I am the Master Spirit of the Steppes,\" answered he. \"I demand  payment for showing the way, and my payment is always in kisses.\"    \"Very well, my twelve maids of honour shall pay you.\"    \"Thirteen kisses are due to me; the first must be given by the lady  who addresses me.\"    The queen was very angry, and again the attempt was made to find their  way. But the carriage, though during the whole time it moved in an  opposite direction, still returned to the stone column. It was now  dark, and they were obliged to think of finding shelter for the night,  so the queen was obliged to give the warrior his strange payment.  Getting out of her carriage she walked up to the knight, and looking  modestly down allowed him to kiss her; her twelve maids of honour who  followed did the same. A moment later stone column and horseman had  vanished, and they found themselves on the high-road, while a perfumed  cloud seemed to float over the steppes. The queen stepped into her  carriage with her ladies, and so the journey was continued.    But from that day the beautiful queen and her maids became thoughtful  and sad; and, losing all pleasure in travel, went back to the capital.  Yet the return home did not make the queen happy, for always before  her eyes she saw the Horseman of the Steppes. This displeased the  king, who became gloomy and ill-tempered.    One day while the king was on his throne in the council chamber he  suddenly heard the sweetest warblings, like unto those produced by a  bird of paradise; these were answered by the songs of many  nightingales. Wondering, he sent to find out what it was. The  messenger returned saying that the queen and her twelve"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25568"],[0,"Domesticated Animals (#18)"],[1," larger measure than any of our  animals which are shorn. Yet this creature has never obtained the place  in relation to man to which it seems entitled. Only here and there is  it kept in considerable numbers or made the basis of extensive  industries. The reason for this seems to be that these animals cannot  readily be kept in flocks in the manner of sheep. They are only partly  gregarious, and tend to stray from the owner's keeping. There seems  reason also to believe that they cannot easily be made to vary in other  characteristics except their hairy covering at the will of the breeder,  and so varieties cannot be formed, as is the case with sheep, to suit  each peculiarity of soil and climate. Thus in Europe, where it would be  easy to name a score of distinct breeds of sheep, each peculiarly well  suited to the conditions of the country where it had been developed,  the goats are singularly alike. The original stock of these creatures  appears to have been adapted to feeding on the scant herbage which  develops in rocky and mountainous countries. They do not seem able to  make the perfect use of the resources of a pasture which sheep do.  These inherited peculiarities in feeding enable them to pick up a  subsistence where they may range over a considerable territory, even  where it seems to afford no forms of food for the hungriest animal.  Thus in that part of the city of New York known as \"Shanty town,\" goats  may be seen in fairly good condition, although the sole source of food,  besides a few stray weeds, appears to be the paste of the paper  advertisements which they pick from the rocks and fences.    Although goats appear to be characterized by invariable bodies, our  sheep are, in physical characteristics, among the most flexible of our  domesticated animals. They may by selection readily and rapidly be made  to vary as regards the character of their wool, the size and proportion  of their muscles, and the quantity and placing of the fat. In all these  features they may be fairly blown to and fro by the wind of favor.  Between the meagre-bodied merino, with its skeleton-like frame and  heavily wrinkled skin bearing a vast burden of long wool, and the heavy  Hampshire-downs or South-downs, there is really an immense difference in  bodily quality; yet these variations represent only a century or two of  careful experiment on the part of the breeders. It seems not improbable  that in the present state of this developing art it would be possible,  in a hundred years, to reverse the conditions of these two varieties.    Sheep and goats, like the other herbivorous species which are the  common tenants of our fields and forests, belong to the great class of  dull-witted mammals in which the intellectual processes appear to be  almost altogether limited to ancient and simple emotions, such as are  inspired by fear or hunger. They are characterized by little  individuality of mind, and although the needs of men have not led to  any experiment in developing their wits, as in the case of dogs, there  is no reason to believe that they afford much foundation for such  essays. The present rapid variations in the physical characteristics of  our sheep which are induced by the breeder's skill, make it evident  that we are far from having attained the maximum profit from these  creatures. The goats also give promise, when selective work is  carefully done upon them, of giving much more than they now afford to  the uses of mankind; but from neither of these forms is there reason to  hope, at least on our present lines of experiment, for any considerable  gain in the intellectual qualities.    [Illustration: The Great Caravan Road--Central Asia]    We have already noted the fact that the sheep is especially adapted to  serve man in high latitudes, where he has to provide against the  winter's cold. The camel is an even more striking instance in which the  value of the creature depends upon climatal peculiarities. It is  peculiarly fitted, by its ancestral training and development, for the  use of men who dwell in arid countries. In the olden days of the later  Tertiary epoch, creatures akin to the camels appear to have been widely  distributed, and were probably adapted to considerable variations of  environment. Within the time of which we know something by history,  these forms have been limited to the arid districts of southwestern  Asia and northern Africa. It is not certain that we know the originally  wild form of either of the two species, the double-humped or  single-humped camels. Wild members of each exist, but they may be the  descendants of the domesticated forms. It seems probable that long  before the building of the Pyramids the people of the deserts had  learned how to profit from the very peculiar qualities of this  strangely provided beast, which in several distinct ways is singularly  fitted to serve the needs of man in arid lands. The large and  well-padded foot of this creature is well adapted for treading a  surface unsoftened by vegetation. Its peculiar stomach enables it to  store water in such a manner that it can go for days without drink. In  the humps upon its back, as in natural pack-saddles, it may harvest a  share of the nutriment which it obtains from occasional good  pasturages, the store being laid away in the form of fat which may  return to the blood when the creature would otherwise starve. So  important have these peculiarities been found by men who have  domesticated the camel, that on them have rested many of the most  interesting features of race development in the history of our kind. In  the territories along the eastern and southern shores of the  Mediterranean, and in a large part of southern and central Asia, the  camel has done service to man which elsewhere has been performed by  sheep, cattle, and horses. In those parts of the world the share which  these domesticated animals have had in the development of man has been  relatively small. The camel has given the strength for burdens, hair  for clothing, and often flesh to the needy men of the desert.    [Illustration: The Halt in the Desert at Night--The Story Teller]    Although long a captive, and for ages, perhaps, the most serviceable of  all the creatures which man has won from the wilds, the camel is still  only partly domesticated, having never acquired even the small measure  of affection for his master which we find in the other herbivorous  animals which have been won to the service of man. The obedience which  he renders is but a dull submission to inevitable toil. The  intelligence which he shows is very limited, and, so far as I can judge  from the accounts of those who have observed him, there is but little  variation in his mental qualities. As a whole, the creature appears to  be innately the dullest and least improvable of all our servitors.  The fact is, this animal belongs to an ancient and lowly type of  mammals characterized by relatively small brains, and therefore of weak  intelligence; but, for its singular serviceableness in drought-ridden  countries, it would probably have been hunted off the earth by the  early men, as have been many other remnants of the ancient life.    [Illustration: Camels Feeding]    It is somewhat characteristic of the older forms of animals, those  which took shape in the earlier Tertiary periods, that they are less  variable than those which acquired their characteristics in times  nearer our own. It is a fact well known to the students of  paleontology, that species and genera which have been long on the  earth are apt to become in a way rigid as regards their qualities of  body and mind. It is an interesting fact that, although the camel can  readily be transplanted to many other parts of the world, where the  physiographic conditions are similar to those of the realm where he has  served man so well, he has never been thoroughly successful except in  the regions where he has been in use for ages. In the desert regions of  the Cordilleras of America, in South Africa, and in Australia, various  experiments go to show that the creature could be perfectly reconciled  to its environment. Many years ago a lot of camels were brought to the  valley of the Rio Grande with a view to their utilization in that  region, which closely resembles the desert countries about the  Mediterranean. These animals were thoroughly successful in meeting the  climatal conditions of the region. They proved as strong and as fertile  as in their natural realms. Although it is said they survive to the  present day, they have never been of any service to the people.    [Illustration: Carrying the Sugar Cane in Harvest--Egypt]    Although, as before noted, the camel has a certain value for other  purposes than conveying burdens, these subsidiary uses are so far  limited that the creature is not likely to retain a place in the world  after his service in caravans is no longer called for. The rapid  recivilization of northern Africa, leading as it does to the development  of a railway system in that region, promises to displace this creature  from his most trodden ways. It seems likely that the other portions of  the desert lands in the old world will soon be brought under the same  civilizing influences, the nomadic tribes reduced to a stationary habit  of life, and the commerce effected in the modern manner. When this  change is brought about, this old-time animal, which but for the care of  man would have probably long since passed away, will be likely, save  so far as it may be preserved through motives of scientific interest, to  join the great array of vanished species.    [Illustration: Camels along the Sea at Twilight]    It affords a pleasant contrast to turn from the consideration of the  camels to a study of the elephants. The difference in the measure of  attractiveness of the two forms is very great, and depends upon facts of  remarkable interest. Unlike the camel--which, as we have"]]]
